When the word appears in תנ\"ך (in three places) the canopy is understood by the commentaries to be arch shaped- i.e. bent. The connection from Kippa to hand, is indirect. What you are writing is very nice drush, but you should be aware that it's not literal/pshat. </p>\n\n<p>That being the case, I would suggest you consider the verse:</p>\n\n<p>יְראוּ אֶת ה'  קְדֹשָׁיו כִּי אֵין מַחְסוֹר לִירֵאָיו</p>\n\n<p>There is an implicit connection between that posuk and:</p>\n\n<p>פותח את ידיך ומשביע לכל חי רצון</p>\n\n<p>So the question you have to ask yourself, how is fear of heaven connected with the concept of God as Provider?

This raised three questions in my mind, which I was unable to find the answers to despite research attempts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is this still a rule practiced in modern times? If not, when did this change (and what justification was given for the change)?</p></li>\n<li><p>In the past, one could only guess if they were sterile or just hadn't yet had a child for whatever reason. But now we have science which can, in certain cases, confirm that it is impossible for a woman to have children. (The most extreme example: if she has had a hysterectomy.). \nIs there a difference between having trouble conceiving and <em>likely</em> being infertile, and knowing for an absolute fact that you cannot have children? </p></li>\n<li><p>If a woman is entirely certain that she cannot have children, does that mean she cannot marry? Or that she may, but the marriage can only last 10 years (dependent upon the answer to #1). </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(This seems silly though, as the 10 year period seems to exist to give enough time for the couple to try to conceive, and in this case they already know going into it that they can't. Of course the woman should disclose this fact to her future husband, but producing children is the husband's responsibility and that he flouts Jewish law if he has none. So would such a woman be barred from marrying because she would prevent her husband from carrying out his duty to have children? (Or could/should she marry a non-Jew, who has no such restrictions? Or could adoption fulfill this requirement?) I also read that the primary purpose of marriage is not procreation, but love and companionship and partnership for the married couple.

There is no prohibition of any severity for relations with one's self.  Every act of normal relations that is prohibited has a verse and explanation of what relationship between those two people forbids their relations.  Homosexual relations, which can be (hypothetically) violated with one's self, is prohibited without any consideration of who the individuals involved are, and therefore one's self could be (hypothetically) included.  However, relations with the female part of an androgynous is not considered homosexual relations (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5101.htm#15\">Rambam Isurei Biah 1:15</a>).  There is therefore no scriptual basis for such a prohibition - it does not fit into any of the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l5701.htm\">15 relations</a> for which the punishment is spiritual excision.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=55&format=pdf\">Sanhedrin 55a</a> is indicative of this - </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעא מיניה רב אחדבוי בר אמי מרב ששת המערה בעצמו מהו אמר ליה קבסתן אמר רב אשי מאי תיבעי לך בקושי לא משכחת לה כי משכחת לה במשמש מת למאן דאמר משמש מת בעריות פטור הכא פטור ולמאן דאמר חייב הכא מיחייב תרתי מיחייב אשוכב ומיחייב אנשכב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Summary: Rav Achdavuy: What is the halacha of one who commits sodomy with themselves?  Rav Sheshes: Stop bothering me with ridiculous questions! (See Rashi.) Rav Ashi: This case cannot exist with an erection.  <strong>You can only ask without an erection.</strong>  According to the opinion that there is a prohibition without an erection, it violates two prohibitions.  According to the opinion that there is no prohibition without an erection, there is no prohibition.  (Halacha follows the latter opinion.)</p>\n\n<p>So the Gemara was unable to find a case of someone violating themselves with an erection.  If the case of this post's question provided such a case, Rav Sheshes should not have scolded Rav Achdavuy and Rav Ashi should not have needed to resort to an opinion that is not normative halacha.  One is forced to conclude that either such a case is impossible, and an androgynous could not impregnate themselves naturally, or such a case is not an erva, as there is no verse in the Torah prohibiting the \"relative\" of one's self.  As opposed to the case the Gemara did ask about, in which the prohibition is sodomy which has nothing to do with the relationship between the individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the case of the question either does not exist or is not prohibited by the Torah (as a forbidden act of relations).</p>\n\n\n",

To my initial dismay I was sure that all our well meaning teachers may have transgressed a Gemoro (Temurah 14b). The Gemoro learns from psukim in the Torah that one may not 'write' the oral part of our torah - תורה שבעל פה אסור לכותבם.

In the times of the Tanoim when they had the minds and clarity to remember everything by-heart there was no risk to the Torah being forgotten even though it wasn't written. However, the last Tanoim [approximately 2000 years ago] realized that this was changing, and that the learners no longer had the capacity to remember everything by-heart, they understood that Hashems desire was to start writing done even the oral part of the torah. Hence the Mishnah, and afterwards that Gemoro was written and accurately passed from one generation to the next.</p>\n\n<p>However, does this allowance have any limitations?! It must be noted that the Shulchan Aruch makes no mention of the initial issur, nor any limitations to the permission we have to write the oral torah. </p>\n\n<p>[1] The Taz (YD 183 1) writes that the heter of עת לעשית לה' is only כדי להתלמד בו when done for the purpose of torah learning (see also Mishnah Berurah 638 24). [There may be a possibility that the Taz only said this referring to details pertaining to the teaching of תורה שבכתב that we don't find an explicit heter of עת לעשות. However regarding writing תורה שבעל פה, that the Gemoro explicitly writes the heter of עת לעשות it may possibly be more lenient].</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe of the Chasam Sofer - Harav Noson Adler - had a phenomenal memory, which never failed him, and from a very young age he never forgot anything he learnt. Harav Adler held that since he didn't need to write his chidushei torah to prevent him forgetting them, he never wrote any of them down, for fear that he is transgressing the issur of writing תורה שבעל פה. [This is not a ruling which was given for the public, and if this would have been a halocho, it would have to have been brought in the Shulchan Aruch].\nAccording to the Taz one can debate whether making a Rosh Chodesh decoration is indeed a \"need\" for which to use the exemption of עת לעשות לה'.</p>\n\n<p>[2] The Rambam (Responsa 5) writes that כתב אשורית - the letters as they are written in a sefer Torah - is holy and should not be used for mundane matters. The Remoh (Responsa 34) wonders why our seforim are not written with the Ashuris alphabet. The Remoh [quoted in Magen Avraham (334 17)] explains that the previous generations developed a new alphabet in order to write chidushei torah with. The Remoh suggests that the main issur of דברים שבעל פה אין לכותבם is against writing with the Ashiris letters, but with other letters it is somewhat more lenient. Hence, after the Gemoro told us that due to עת לעשות לה', they could write the oral torah, it become mutter with a non-Ashuris alphabet only.\nAccording to the Magen Avraham it seems that any תורה שבעל פה  not written in Ashuris is muttar. Accordingly the משנכנס אדר signs are ok.</p>\n\n<p>[3] Many Poskim hold that since the Gemoro allowed writing תורה שבעל פה, it is muttar irrespective of what one is writing for.</p>\n\n<p>According to these Poskim obviously we would have no reason to challenge the kindergarten teachers.</p>\n\n<p>[4] One teacher suggested to me that the don't mean to write a part of תורה שבעל פה rather they are simply writing that at the start of Adar one should increase ones level of simcha. [This sounds a bit of a weak excuse, since they are choosing the very wording of the gemoro].</p>\n\n<p>[5] If you look carefully you will even find some people who write משנכנס ... מרבים בשמחה which is not a complete phrase [3 words may be called a phrase] in-order to avoid the issue of תורה שבעל פה אין לכותבם.</p>\n\n\n",

[ילקוט יוסף, שבת כרך א עמוד יא].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an example see the Remas comment on the Shulchan Aruch (או\"ח שו-א) regarding ודבר דבר, the manner of speech on shabbos should be different than from the week:</p>\n<p>א. ודבר דבר שלא יהא דבורך של שבת כדבורך של חול הלכך אסור לומר דבר פלוני אעשה למחר או סחורה פלונית אקנה למחר ואפילו בשיחת דברים בטלים אסור להרבות. הגה: <strong>ובני אדם שסיפור שמועות ודברי חידושים הוא עונג להם מותר לספרם בשבת כמו בחול אבל מי שאינו מתענג אסור לאמרם כדי שיתענג בהם חבירו (תרומת הדשן סימן ס''א):</strong></p>\n<p>The Rema says that if one derives benefit from telling over  news and stories, it is permitted to speak about it on shabbos. However, if one does not enjoy this manner of speaking than it is forbidden.</p>\n<p>Regarding reading a book for enjoyment on shabbos, the Rabbi on <a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2014/04/04/reading-history-and-novels/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this site</a> seems to qualify enjoyment on Shabbos as to be only something that is constructive and positive eg. reading a history book in order to see the ways Divine provedence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Answer:</p>\n<p>The Pasuk reads (Devarim 32:7): “Remember days long gone by.\nPonder the years of each generation. Ask your father and let him tell\nyou, and your grandfather, who will explain it.” Clearly, then, the\nstudy of history is permitted where there is a positive purpose\ninvolved, such as understanding the ways of Divine providence,\ncomprehending our own place on the historical timeline, and\nunderstanding the Torah better by recognizing personal and historical\ncontext.</p>\n<p>Moreover,the study of some secular subjects, including literature, is\nable to develop a person’s abilities to write and discuss matters in\ndepth, to enhance our understanding of human interaction in many\nspheres, and to be part of a person’s self development.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the “history” referred to by the Shulchan Aruch\nrefers to trumped-up legends of kings and their glories, written by\nthe victors – and not to the deeper (and often critical) modern study\nof history. The idea is that a person shouldn’t waste his time on\nnothing-ness and nonsense, and should pursue productive goals and\nactivities.</p>\n<p>The reading of novels and sport books will depend on the value of\ndoing so. If this is an important part of a person’s recreation, and\nallows him to thrive in significant areas of his life, then its fine.\nIf a person spends his whole day on sports and novels, then this is\nobviously harming his general function, and he should consider how to\nfocus on the more productive.</p>\n<p>Best wishes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Mishna Berurah writes (ס' רמא) that when in Yeshaya it says \"Shabbos Shabbaton Mikra Kodesh...\" that Chazal understand this to mean that one must honor and enjoy shabbos.  One honors Shabbos through clean clothes and enjoys Shabbos through eating and drinking nice foods.  The M\"B continues to say that the typical food which one enjoys is meat and wine, and so there is a concept to have this at his meals.  He then mentions that oneg shabbos comes from the eating of \"dagim gedolim - big/great fish,\" and continues to say that one should eat fish at all three meals.  However, if one does not like fish, then he should not eat it since it would not bring him enjoyment. He continues to discuss that one fulfills the concept of \"oneg shabbos\" by having three meals (those who cannot afford 3, can have 2 and must spend other money on obtaining shabbos candles).  However, later on (a few simanim later -- in regards to neiros shabbos - shabbos candles) he writes that the main aspect of oneg shabbos is the candles at the meal.  So, so far we have discussed eating, drinking, and candles.</p>\n\n<p>In the book, Kitzur Hilchos Shabbos, it brings a nice idea that Shabbos (ש.ב.ת.) stands for שינה בשבת תענג - He will enjoy sleep on shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>There is also, though I can't remember where I've seen it, a concept to have relations on Shabbos.  Explained by the fact that the holiness of Shabbos is a suitable time to engage in the holy mitzvah \"to be fruitful and multiply\" as well as that this is something that brings both the husband and the wife enjoyment.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in regards to doing \"anything,\" obviously these things have to be within the framework of what is permissible on shabbos.  There are other things for which shabbos is a particularly appropriate time for doing them such as learning torah (I can't remember the source).</p>\n\n<p>All in all, we see that there are specific things that define oneg shabbos and contribute to it, but as whole it is a broad category which leaves room for individuality and one's own (kosher) taste.</p>\n\n\n",

R’ Eliezer Waldenberg (Tzitz Eliezer 4:6:3) compares plastic utensils to stone ones and permits kashering through hagalah.</p>\n<p>R’ Yitzchak Yaakov Weiss (Minchas Yitzchak 1:86; 3:67) writes that while one shouldn’t specifically buy non-kosher plastic utensils, if one’s plastic utensils became treif, one may kasher them. One should avoid doing this to kasher for Pesach.</p>\n<p>R’ Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC 2:92) wrote that while one may kasher natural rubber, one cannot kasher materials made from synthetic substances (See Igros Moshe EH 4:7 regarding Teflon). R’ Shimon Eider (Halachos of Pesach 13:n5; 10) writes that R’ Moshe told him that this only applied to kashering for Pesach. One may use hagalah to kasher during the year, however.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As to whether it 'swallows up taste' (<em>bolea</em>), is quite a discussion among the sources quoted above. In short, the reason that glass can't be kashered according to the Rema isn't because it is <em>bolea</em> but because it is made from sand like earthenware. (See beginning of article linked above). The general understanding is that plastic is similar to glass - it isn't <em>bolea</em> or <em>maflit</em> ('excrete it out like metal'), though follows the same argument as glass.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Yosef Henkin has this to say in Kisvei HaGria Henkin part two, page 60 siman 46.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning hagaala for rubber utensils and plastic utensils, it seems that it helps. Only with earthenware vessels where we see the abortion which never comes out completely, there hagaala does not work as per Pesachim 30. \nAlso as far as tevila goes it seems they don't need it. According to Torah law only metal items need tevila, and it helps. And glass items also being that they are created with fire and reformed with fire, we tovel.

To avoid all of this confusion it really should have written “from your dwelling places תקריבו לחם (you shall offer bread)”, but since the bread is not actually offered up but only accompanies the animal sacrifices that are brought together with it, it could not write this, and so it instead wrote תָּבִיאּוּ with a dagesh in the aleph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do not have his commentary on Job or Ezra (if he wrote one).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://www.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/OBP.0163.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">book on Tiberian Hebrew</a> (pp. 135ff), Geoffrey Khan suggests that in fact, the dot in the aleph is to be pronounced as a doubling of the consonant, not simply as a sign that the aleph should be read as a consonant.

R. Binymin Zilber in Shut Az Nidberu 14:60,69 understands that speaking evil about non-religious Jews is permitted (see below), but discourages it because we shouldn't be increasing negative feelings between ourselves and irreligious Jews. </p>\n\n<p>Exceptions to this rule are sinners who are heretics and sinners whom one is allowed to hate (see Klal 8 for details), and perhaps about people who are engaged in a fight. However, in the case of a heretic, one can only speak lashon hara if </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>the speaker has witnessed this person express heresy (or willingly violate the egregious sin), or the subject is well known as a heretic (8:6-7) AND</p></li>\n<li><p>one’s intent is to distance people from him or his actions, not merely to be cruel (8:7)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Similarly, in the case of speaking evil about two people fighting, lashon hara may only be said if three conditions are met: (1) the speaker was witness himself to what he's going to say (2) his intent is to stop the fighting, not to degrade the subject, and (3) he feels that there's no other way to end the fight. (See Beer Mayim Chayim 28, though, that lashon hara in such a case might still be prohibited to be believed)</p>\n\n<p>A final exception exists where speaking about a sinner will help others stop him from engaging in this sin, or otherwise help him do teshuva (see C.C. 4:5-6 and 10:4). However, the Chafetz Chaim lists 7 conditions (in 10:2), but <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2013/08/is-careful-language-possible/\" rel=\"nofollow\">each of them come with several caveats/complications</a>, so such an issue is probably best determined on a case by case basis (i.e. CYLOR) </p>\n\n\n",

If we are at the end of the month when the renter has already lived there rent free then he shall be the muchzak in the money that the owner wants to extract from him.</p>\n\n<p>Still the gemarah is not concerned about a renter which shall somehow get the dialogue to be pushed off until the end of the month which shall render him the muchzak. For were he to position the discussion in the end of the month we shall just let him be the muchzak. </p>\n\n<p>From this we may take out that arranging the circumstances to your favor is of no concern and is fine to do.  </p>\n\n<p>Therefore we shall consider this act moral.</p>\n\n<p>However let see, beezrat Hashem, that the entire payment of the rent he made, is null and void and the owner is still the muchzak.</p>\n\n<p>Someone paying his debt can do so even when the receiver does not want to accept payment at this time, except if the halacha states that the receiver has a right to say he does not wish to be paid at this time or place. Therefore a person who decides to pay with his collateral he may do so without his consent.</p>\n\n<p>However if the collateral was given to secure loan a' that this person owes him, he can not force him to take that as payment for loan b', since he has rights on his collateral to secure loan a', for him to pay loan b' with it would be equivalent to taking it back for himself which he certainly may not do.</p>\n\n<p>In our case, when the landlord discovers that there was damage done, he certainly regrets his consent to take that as rent, and here you need his consent to pay up with it being that this money was designated to pay for those damages if there were any and not for rent payment.</p>\n\n<p>(If the money was designated also for rent then too he may still say that it was designated for the next rent as well if he ends up staying.)</p>\n\n<p>The idea that such a consent may be considered a tauus (mistake)and invalid is found in c'm' 25'5' where the judge ruled that one has to swear which in turn caused him to rather make a pesharah and avoid swearing.Then the judge was found to be mistaken in his ruling and thus the pesharah was considered a mistake even when done with a kinyan since it was clear that he resigned to a pesharah due to the shevuah.</p>\n\n<p>By us as well it is clear that his consent was due to his not expecting damage which the money was set aside for.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore we conclude that this trick shall not work being that when he realizes he was tricked he retracts from his consent and that money shall again be designated for the damages.</p>\n\n\n",

I was quite skeptical but being a dutiful husband I agreed to take them to be inspected. There are only 3 mezuzahs as we have a small apartment.</p>\n\n<p>On inspection I was told that 2 of the 3 had a lot of letters touching each other, but he fixed them. I was immediately asked by the Rebbetzin if we have been having bad Mazel. I was shocked. Paid for the work done and left. Too shocked to ask anything further.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone explain to me if their is any fact behind this, or is it a superstition. \nI very much hope that this is an end to our bad luck.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/310889/jewish/The-Protective-Power-of-Mezuzah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.com</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now consider: The blood of the Passover sacrifice was but of little weight, for it was required but once, not for all generations, and by night only, not by day; yet He would ‘not allow the destroyer... to strike you.’ How much more will He not permit the destroyer into the house which bears a mezuzah, which is of greater weight, seeing that the Divine Name is repeated there ten times, it is there by day and night, and it is a law for all generations.</p>\n<p>We see in this biblical account and the above commentary the direct relationship between the mitzvah of mezuzah and Divine protection. A mezuzah affixed to the doorpost as commanded by G-d at Sinai still has the power to “not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to smite you”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See there for more details.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As you correctly state in your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a belief by some in a correlation between poor luck and unkosher Mezuzahs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, there is also opposition to this idea. Most notably, Rambam writes in Hilkhot Mezuzah (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2305.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">5:4</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מנהג פשוט, שכותבין על המזוזה מבחוץ... שדי... אבל אלו שכותבין בה מבפנים שמות מלאכים, או שמות קדושים, או פסוק, או חותמות--הרי הן בכלל מי שאין להן חלק לעולם הבא:  שאלו הטיפשים, לא דיי להם שביטלו המצוה; אלא שעושין מצוה גדולה, שהיא ייחוד שמו של הקדוש ברוך הוא ואהבתו ועבודתו, כאילו היא קמיע להנית עצמן, כמו שעלה על ליבם הסכל שזה דבר המהנה בהבלי העולם.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a widespread custom of writing 'Shaday' on the mezuzah from the outside [of the parchment]. However, those who write in the mezuzah names of angels, or sacred names, or a verse, or seals--they are included in those who have no share in the world to come. For these idiots--it is not enough that they failed the fulfillment of the mitzvah, but they [even] render a great mitzvah; [whose essence is] the unity of God's name, and love for him, and his service, into a [mere] amulet for personal benefit, as occurred to their foolish minds; that this [mezuzah] is something that yields benefit in this world. (translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, although the sentiment of the mezuzah as a protective amulet, to be checked in time of danger, was present even in Rambam's time, he was deeply opposed to it.</p>\n\n<p>Although some attacked Rambam for his stance in light of sources that indicate protective powers, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Qafih</a> z\"l writes (commentary to Hilkhot Mezuzah 6:13):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין כוונת חז\"ל לדעת רבנו שהמזוזה מהנה בעניני העולם הזה, אלא שבזהירות במזוזה ישווה ה' לנגדו תמיד, ובכך תהיה השגחת ה' עליו גדולה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To paraphrase : According to Rambam the mezuzah does not provide earthly gain. Rather, through attention to the mezuzah, one will set God in front of himself at all times, and through this God will watch over him more.</p>\n\n<p>This last point of R. Qafih brings Rambam a little closer to the others. Even though he does not believe that the mezuzah <em>directly</em> causes any physical benefits, R. Qafih suggests, that if one takes heed of the mezuzah's message, and allows it to keep God on his mind, he will merit a greater degree of divine intervention in his life, including, potentially, physical benefits.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Although there were some who were so entrenched in the belief that mezuzot provide physical protection that they even claimed that Rambam held this, this is not the implication of the aforementioned quote, or the understanding of R. Qafih, one of the greatest experts on Rambam (and Geonim and North African / Spanish Rishonim in general) of all time.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.balassagyarmatizsidosag.hu/en/boskowitz-benjamin-zeev-wolf\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Wolf Boskowitz</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא ודאי מוכח מזה דרבינו ז\"ל סובר דמצות מזוזה אין בו תועלת השמירה כלל בטבעה ובסגולתה, רק כי היא כמו אחת מכל מצוות ה' אשר צוה אשר אין בהם תועלת לעניני עולם הזה </p>\n  \n  <p>To paraphrase: It is evident form this that our master [Rambam] is of the opinion that the mitzvah of mezuzah accomplishes no protection at all. Rather, like all of the mitzvot, it does not provide physical benefit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The bull therefore replied that although it accepted Eliyahu's argument, it still wished that the prophet would be the one to actually pass him over to them, so that the entire act from beginning to end would be performed as a messenger from Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

Here's what I said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>B''H</p>\n<p>In most Ashkenazi communities, the custom is that bochurim do not wear a tallis.

Because he had already davened, he would not be wearing a tallis, and he would not put one on because there was no issue of kavod hatzibur, because in this case the majority of the minyan was not wearing one.</p>\n<p>On Shabbos, though, when the main minyan was the community minyan, bochurim receiving aliyahs then (usually a chosson the Shabbos before his wedding or on rare occasion a bar mitzvah boy) would most certainly wear a tallis.</p>\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n<p>All the best,</p>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer Zalmanov\nfor Chabad.org</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have also asked this question, and I was told by my yeshiva-educated fiancee who grew up going to a chabad shul because it was the only Orthodox shul within walking distance of his house the following.

He writes that not only did Mordechai not bow down to Haman, but he would actually make a point in showing him that did not wish to. Thus, if Haman happened to walk past while Mordechai was anyhow leaning over, he would specifically stand upright to demonstrate his unwillingness to bow down to him.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The <strong>Sfas Emes</strong> <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19061&st=&pgnum=183\">explains</a> that in every generation, the Jewish nation has one leader who has the soul of Moshe Rabeynu, and will remain steadfast in his belief no matter what tests the people face. This soul is called a \"נשמה כללית\" - a general soul - as it includes the entire Jewish people (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9949#v=21&showrashi=true\">Rashi to Bamidbar 21:21</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In the particular generation of the Purim story, the \"איש יהודי\" (the general soul of Jews) was named Mordechai, however the Megillah makes a point of mentioning that Mordechai of every future generation as well \"will never bow down\" to Haman. Therefore, as the Megilla continues, \"It seemed contemptible to him to lay hands on Mordechai alone, for they had told him Mordechai's nationality.\" Haman realised that just getting rid of Mordechai would never be enough, as such a soul will always exist, and his only hope was to try destroy all the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>(The Sfas Emes there also brings an alternative explanation that not only did he not bow down to Haman, but the possibility to do such a thing never even occurred to him).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>R' Levi Yitzchok of Berdichev</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50006&pgnum=103\">Kedushas Levi, Derush Lepurim</a>) offers another fascinating answer, by prefacing another question:</p>\n\n<p>The Megillah writes that Haman became upset, \"for they had told him Mordechai's nationality.\" Certainly Haman was aware that Mordechai was Jewish even prior to this (see there for several proofs)?</p>\n\n<p>He explains that although the king had decreed that all his servants had to bow down to Haman, he actually excluded Mordechai from the decree. The words \"מרדכי לא יכרע ולא ישתחוה\" are in fact not the narrative <em>after</em> the decree (that Mordechai did not bow), but actually a <em>continuation</em> of the decree (that he did not have to bow). Mordechai could have gotten away with not bowing down without causing any trouble, however he went around telling people that the reason he was not bowing down was not due to his unique exemption, but simply because he was Jewish. Even had he been included in the command, he would have disobeyed and not bowed down.

The OU discusses this machlokes and actually ties it to the the discussions of what type of \"os\" (sign) the tefillin represent. Since we have special mitzvos on chol hamoed, tosfos (as an example) would say that chol hamoed is a <strong>kind</strong> of os. Others would say that since the Yomim Tovim forbid melacha and chol hamoed does not, then chol hamoed is not enough of an os to prevent us from wearing tefillin. Thus, the machlokes is indeed based on the kind of os shown by the tefillin.</p>\n\n<p>There are those who would wear tefillin if they have to go to work on chol hamoed and refrain once they can stop working on chol hamoed. However, the normative minhag that I have seen is to do one or the other.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ou.org/life/torah/mm_tefillin/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tzav: Tefillin on Chol HaMoed</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reason we don’t put on tefillin on the holidays themselves, as\n  well as on Shabbat, is that the tefillin are referred to in the Torah\n  as an OT – a sign; but Shabbat and holidays are also considered a\n  sign, so on these days we don’t display the “sign” of tefillin\n  (Menachot 36b). What about chol hamoed?</p>\n  \n  <p>Tosafot suggest that there are two distinct kinds of “signs” on the\n  holidays. One kind of sign is refraining from labor, which is only on\n  the holiday itself; the second kind is the special observances of the\n  holidays, such as matza on Pesach and sitting in the sukkah on Sukkot,\n  which exists also on chol hamoed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aditionally</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Beit Yosef (OC 31) cites the Zohar Chadash which also likens the\n  two types of days to two aspects of tefillin. The Zohar Chadash refers\n  to the holidays as the “tefillin” of HaShem: Yom Tov itself the head\n  tefillin and the intermediate days the hand tefillin. On these days we\n  are adorned by the tefillin of HaShem, and so it would be superfluous\n  and even insolent to wear tefillin made by us (Zohar Chadash on Shir\n  HaShirim, vol. IV p. 64 column d).</p>\n  \n  <p>This distinction is closely related to that of the Tosafot. A common\n  explanation of tefillin is that the head tefillin represent sanctity\n  of thought, and those of the hand sanctity of deed. The Zohar likens\n  Yom Tov, whose theme is the frame of mind of inner joy, to the head\n  tefillin, and Chol HaMoed, with its special holiday observances, to\n  the hand tefillin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rema, who rules that tefillin are put on during chol hamoed,\n  holds that two berakhot are said on the head tefillin, and one of\n  these (l’haniach) exempts the hand as well. Based on the blessing, we\n  would view the head tefillin as the primary mitzva and the primary\n  sign. Based on the distinction of the Zohar, the difference of\n  approach regarding the blessings is parallel to that regarding\n  tefillin on chol hamoed (Orach Chaim 25:5; 26:2; 31:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the Mishna/Gemara so rarely mention the practical Halacha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna frequently mentions different opinions. Some opinions are generally rejected Halachicly (Rabbi Elazar, Beis Shammai). Why doesn't the Mishna mention who the Halacha follows (in general).</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara is much more complex, with many arguments going back and forth, and yet also has very few final rulings.</p>\n\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Yitchak Cohen from Yeshiva University explained this to me about 40 years ago when I asked him this question as a student in his class.</p>\n\n<p>He said that the purpose of the Gemarah is not to always tell you the answers. It is the questions that are the most important. The purpose of the Gemarah is <em>Torah Sheb'al Peh</em> - the Oral law. In that sense, it mimicks the written Torah, itself. The written Torah generally does not explicitly state how to do something. One main reason for that technique is to have you delve into it so that you can ask questions and delve further into discovering the answers.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemarah too, presents things in a question and answer style and offers various opinions with arguments and proofs and rebuttals. Why not just get to the point and tell you \"do this\"? Often the Gemarah doesn't know the answer which is what <em>taiku</em> is. But even if it did give you the final answer, which it frequently does, perhaps, more than you may realize, the purpose is really to appreciate the discussion and methodology and get you to ask the questions.</p>\n\n<p>In short, Rav Cohen explained, that the questions are far more important than the answers. And, it's also a disciplinary lesson, Rav Cohen explained. It teaches you the discipline of learning to accept unanswered questions in life. (FYI - this is a tough challenge for the average person, but Rav Cohen taught me that learning Gemarah really does train you in this discipline!)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Your question is essentially answered in the Mishna in מסכת עדיות פרק א:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משנה ה:</p>\n<p>ולמה מזכירין דברי היחיד בין המרובים, הואיל ואין הלכה אלא כדברי המרובין:  שאם יראה בית דין את דברי היחיד, ויסמוך עליו, שאין בית דין יכול לבטל את דברי בית דין חברו, עד שיהא גדול ממנו בחכמה ובמניין.  היה גדול ממנו בחכמה, אבל לא במניין, במניין, אבל לא בחכמה--אינו יכול לבטל את דברו:  עד שיהא גדול ממנו בחכמה, ובמניין.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All opinions are mentioned, so that nobody can claim that they have a tradition of another opinion that should be taken into consideration.</p>\n<p>There are rules how to Pasken from the Mishna and the Gemara. For example, we always follow the \"multitude\" רבים against an individual.</p>\n<p>Many, if not most (all, possibly?) sugyot in the Gemara have a מסקנה - a conclusion - and that מסקנה becomes the Halacha. (Many of us have simply never been trained to conclude each section with its halachic ramification.)</p>\n<p>When you find differences of opinions in Halacha, you will always be able to trace their origins back to different ways to learn the Sugya; if the opinion has no basis in the Gemara, how can it be a valid opinion?</p>\n\n\n",

But why? The use of money is not listed in Mishna Shabbat 7:2, nor does the act of commerce appear to constitute a subset of any of the prohibitions that <em>are</em> mentioned. Is it prohibited under the principle of <em>shevut</em>? If so, I note that it is nowhere mentioned in Mishna Beitzah 5:2 either.</p>\n\n<p>I would assume that the act of purchasing something is what is forbidden (or perhaps the act of earning money?), which makes handling money forbidden under the principle of כלי שמלאכתו לאיסור, although I would very much like to see that written down somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>What is the earliest source for the prohibition of spending/earning money, under what principle is the handling of money forbidden (<em>shevut</em> or <em>muqtzeh</em>), and were there any dissenting voices on this matter?</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The prohibition of trade already seems to be inferred by Nehemiah 13:15-21, although note that much of his objection concerns the use of animals, the travel to Jerusalem and the entering of a walled city. His prohibiting Tyrians from doing likewise would seem to presuppose a prohibition of <em>buying</em> as well as selling, since Phoenicians are not bound by the laws of Shabbat.

As for the origins of this edict (and as for the reasons behind it), there is more than one opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest reference to it that I have found is Beitza 37a, in which the prohibition on yontef of sanctifying objects, valuing them or proscribing them to all but priests (לא מקדישין ולא מעריכין ולא מחרימין) is explained as being that it may lead one to conduct business (גזרה משום מקח וממכר), although I've yet to find a source in the gemara that explains why the conducting of business should be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>According to Rashi (Beitza 37a, s.v. משום מקח וממכר), the problem is that conducting business might lead one to write out a receipt for the transaction (as per the comment of Annelise above). Lest anybody suppose that this would therefore be an edict on top of an edict (don't value objects lest it leads you to do business, lest that leads you to write a receipt), Rashi emphasises that both edicts are actually one and the same. This opinion is also recorded by the Rambam (MT, Hilkhot Shabbat 23:12), with no objection from the Raavad. I have not seen any explicit rejection of this notion in any of the Rishonim, which makes interesting the declaration of R' Yehoshua Yeshaya Neuwirth, disciple of Rav Auerbach:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש דברים שהם אסורים בשבת ובי\"ט, אף-על-פי שאינם דומים למלאכה, וגם אינם\n  מביאים לידי מלאכה</p>\n  \n  <p>Some things are forbidden on Shabbos and on yontef,\n  even though they are not at all similar to labour, <em>nor do they lead\n  to labour</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Shemirat Shabbat keHilkhatah</em> §29.1, which serves as an introduction to his discussion of the use of money on Shabbat, and other things that are \"מפי הקבלה\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As for the origin of this principle, Rashi traces it back to Isaiah 58:13 (Beitza 37a, s.v. משום מקח וממכר), and also back to Nehemiah 13:15-21 (Beitza 27b, s.v. אין פוסקין). Ramban, on the other hand, derives it from Exodus 12:17, via the Mekhilta on that passuk (Ramban, Leviticus 23:24). I cannot find anywhere in the gemara where the prohibition of using money on Shabbat is mentioned explicitly, although there are plenty of passages from which the prohibition can be inferred. Similarly, I have not found any explicit formulation of this prohibition in the Shulchan Arukh either, although it quite clearly underscores a number of the things that the Shulchan Arukh does say (eg: OC 306:3 and 323, etc).</p>\n\n\n",

Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are, in fact, a wide variety of variant forms of this passage in <em>Shoshanas Yaakov</em> (which is itself something of <a href=\"http://shesileizeisim.blogspot.com/2012/03/structure-of-shoshanas-yaakov.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">a synthesis of earlier sources</a>). The general assumption appears to be that this passage was modified, and even removed, due to \"censorship\" (which can mean actual censorship by non-Jewish authorities or self-censorship to avoid provoking the non-Jewish authorities). This censorship affected not only the text of the siddur but also the text of the basic sources, including the Tur, Shulchan Aruch, and even the Talmud Yerushalmi. (Thus we find variant texts in this regard in these works as well.) (See, in no particular order, the discussion <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46156&st=&pgnum=73&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14392&st=&pgnum=569&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30450&st=&pgnum=636&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=13064&st=&pgnum=117&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24419&st=&pgnum=79&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

Based on that Mishna Berura, if the item is \"really\" muktza, then it would still not be muktza, given that the person was sick before Shabbos. And as stated in the Shulchan Aruch even the healthy person is <strong>allowed to eat the meat</strong>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.308.92?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 38:91 can</a> also be a source for such a Heter</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(צא) או בבקעת וכו' - וה\"ה אם רוצה לסמוך בקורה את הדלת צריכה יחוד כמו בבקעת ואז איכא תורת כלי עליה [אחרונים]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The context of this Mishna Berura is the Shulchan Aruch who discusses how one can prepare a muktza item to be not muktza for Shabbat. The Mishna Berura writes that once it is prepared correctly it <strong>איכא תורת כלי עליה</strong> loosely translated, the item has the status of a vessel. Once an item is a vessel, it loses the status of muktza for everyone, as it wouldn't be any different to any other permitted vessel (for example, a cup).</p>\n\n\n",

According to this approach, a book published on a non-Torah subject that includes some divrei torah need not be placed in genizah when it wears out.

This approach explains the common practice of photocopying Torah quotations for one time use without exerting major effort to retrieve the items for genizah. I leave it to the reader to discuss with his rav whether he may follow this approach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Taking 3 sips before gulping a drink?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Whats the source for taking 3 separate sips before gulping a drink down? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (OC 170:8) writes that the proper way to drink a regular-sized drink is not to down it in one gulp (too glutinous) nor to sip it bit by bit (too pretentious), but rather to drink it in a couple of gulps (juuust right). The Aruch HaShulchan makes it clear that the general idea here is just to drink like a civilized person, however that may be for the drink that you're drinking (for example, hard liquor may be acceptably sipped).</p>\n\n<p>In order for a <em>bracha acharona</em> to be made on a drink, at least a <em>revi'is</em> must be drunk within a normal time span. This is fine regularly, but when it comes to hot drinks which are difficult to gulp, if one wants to make a <em>bracha acharona</em>, he would have to try and drink a <em>revi'is</em> quickly. How quickly? The normal amount of time it takes to drink a <em>revi'is</em> (כדי שתיית רביעית) (Shulchan Aruch OC 612:10). There are various opinions with regard to how long this is and in how many sips one may accomplish it. According to the popular halacha book <em>V'zos HaBracha</em> (p. 227) one who drinks a <em>revi'is</em> in three consecutive sips is obligated in a <em>bracha acharona</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, \"taking 3 separate sips before gulping a drink down\" would seem to have no benefit according to the above. If one will anyway proceed to gulp the drink down, there is no need for the sipping to obligate one's self in <em>bracha acharona</em>; in fact it may violate the Shulchan Aruch's view of proper drinking etiquette if it is a drink that should be gulped normally rather than sipped pretentiously. If one takes three sips of a <em>hot</em> drink (or other commonly-sipped drink) and then proceeds to sip at his leisure, then that has the benefit of obligating a <em>bracha acharona</em>, so long as he is able to imbibe a full <em>revi'is</em> (~3.8 fl. oz. according to the Chafetz Chaim) in the process.</p>\n\n\n",

As per <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5765/vayera.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Doniel Neustadt</a> a non Kosher Torah does not receive the same respect of a Kosher Torah. And it seems to me that he is talking about a Torah that can be Kosher and became non Kosher. You are questioning regarding a Tirah that was never Kosher and is impossible to become Kosher. (It is not on Klaf, It is not written Lishma, Letters are unclear, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>So your Sefer Torah would not make your china closet into an Aron, and not be of assistance when saying Tachanun. However as it has Hashem's name in it and complete Pesukim it should be treated like a Sefer, and not be thrown around, and put into Geniza if torn. <a href=\"http://www.shaimos.org/guidelines.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.shaimos.org/guidelines.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

That would mean God's kingdom has glory. And the glory has a name. And we're blessing the name of the glory, or saying it's blessed. That seems very… odd.</p>\n\n<p>So what does the sentence really mean?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The above is my question. More details follow, but you can skip it.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Isaac Moses and Monica Cellio (in <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/468/2014/2/20\">chat</a>), I have a few other translations handy:</p>\n\n<p>A slightly more palatable (to me) translation makes \"כְּבוֹד מַלְכוּתוֹ\" into \"His glorious kingdom\", as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi N. Scherman (ArtScroll):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blessed is the Name of His glorious kingdom for all eternity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi J. Sacks (Koren):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's more palatable, I say, because at least we're not claiming His kingdom's glory has a name — just that the kingdom itself does. It's still odd to me (that God's kingdom has a name), though, and that we're saying the name is blessed, or blessing it. Plus, we have the grammatical objection that \"כְּבוֹד מַלְכוּתוֹ\" shouldn't mean \"His glorious kingdom\": that'd be \"מַלְכוּת כְּבוֹדוֹ\".</p>\n\n<p>There is an even more palatable translation:</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi J. Hertz:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blessed be His Name, Whose Glorious Kingdom is for ever and ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi A. Davis (Metsudah):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blessed [is His] Name, Whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That makes the entire end of the sentence, \"כְּבוֹד מַלְכוּתוֹ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד\", into a description of God; \"Him whose glorious kingdom is forever\" (or, one could even say, \"Him whose kingdom's glory is forever\", to avoid the \"מַלְכוּת כְּבוֹדוֹ\" issue). This, as I say, is the most palatable of the bunch: we're not saying a name is or should be blessed, nor glory, nor a kingdom, but God. But if this is the correct interpretation of the sentence, I seek a source for it (besides Rabbis Hertz and Davis).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>שם - a name refers to reputation, or how something is known.  טוב שם משמן טוב (Koheles 7:1) means a good <em>reputation</em> is better than oil.  One who is מוציא שם רע - וְשָׂם לָהּ עֲלִילֹת דְּבָרִים, וְהוֹצִא עָלֶיהָ שֵׁם רָע (Devarim 22:14) - has created a bad reputation.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of a name is that which you use for others to relate to you - one does not identify themselves by their name, it is there for others to reference them.</p>\n\n<p>כבוד - Honor refers to a presence, the extent to which something is recognized.  The Gemara in Bava Basra 3a records a dispute about the verse גדול יהיה כבוד הבית הזה האחרון מן הראשון (Chagai 2:9) - The honor of the later Temple will be greater than the former:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רב ושמואל ואמרי לה ר' יוחנן חד אמר בבנין וחד אמר בשנים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which means: Rav and Shmuel, one said it means it was larger, and one said it means it stood longer.</p>\n\n<p>Both of them agree the greater \"honor\" refers to its physical presence, just was it in space or in time. (As the Gemara points out, they were both correct.)  This is also why \"seeing\" Hashem is often referred to as \"seeing\" His \"honor\" (e.g. Shemos 29:43, Vayikra 9:23). </p>\n\n<p>The idea of getting honor means you are acknowledged.  You get honor when you are recognized in some way.</p>\n\n<p>מלכות - Royalty refers to making something manifest.  Bringing something from the potential to the actual is the attribute of Malchus.  Rav Pinkus in Shabbos Malkisa explains that this is why malchus is always at the end of a list (i.e. in Nishmas, in \"לך ה' הגדולה,\" the list of middos in Yishtabach [not the praises], etc.), because malchus only comes after everything else, and brings it out to actualization.</p>\n\n<p>The role of a king is to actualize the potential of the individuals that make up the nation.  This is one explanation why מלך שמחל על כבודו אין כבודו מחול, a king does not have the right to forgo his own honor - because the honor is not really his, it is the projection of the nation as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>R' Tzaddok writes (Resisei Layla 25) that the world was created with מדת המלכות - bringing out the infinite potential of creation into a finite actual was accomplished through Malchus.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of ברוך שם כבוד מלכותו is that the perception of Hashem's Presence should be increasingly (ברוך means רבוי, increase - Rashba and Nefesh HaChaim) brought out from infinite potential into a perceptible reality. Thus, roughly: ברוך  (Increased [should be]) שם (the relationship to) כבוד (the physically-apparent aspect of) מלכותו (the manifestation of Hashem).</p>\n\n<p>In Nefesh HaChaim Sha'ar ג Chapter יד, in a gloss, he explains that Yaakov Avinu said ברוך  שם כבוד מלכותו and Moshe Rabbeinu did not (when each respectively said Shema), because Yaakov was still on the level of acknowledging the realness of a finite reality, and therefore his perception of ה' אחד relied on bringing it down to this world.  Moshe, however, was on the level of, to some degree, perceiving Hashem's essence, that there is no authenticity to finite reality (see the beginning of Sha'ar ג) and therefore did not <em>need</em> to relate to Hashem through translating His infinitude into finite manifestation.  Nefesh HaChaim also sees this line as relating to the relating to Hashem (שם) through the bringing out (מלכות) of His Presence (כבוד) into this world.</p>\n\n<p>We (and everyone except Moshe Rabbeinu, see Nefesh Hachaim immediately after above-quoted gloss) live in a reality in which we experience Hashem on the level of how He appears in this world, and that is the level on which our relationship with Him must function (see Maharal Nesiv HaAvoda ch. 12).  We therefore pray that His manifestation in this world should increase, in order that we have a greater experience of that relationship.  Baruch Shem Kevod is the Tefillah of asking for that increase.  (It is placed where it is, immediately following Shema, because Shema is the declaration of Hashem's oneness which supersedes finite existence and declares that His existence is the only real existence.  We have to \"mitigate\" that for ourselves into our realm of experience, which is the reality of this world.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Cislunar is basically right. It means 'Blessed is the name of His Royal Majesty for all eternity.' The term 'k'vod malchuto' is an honorific (His Royal Majesty) that refers to God himself.</p>\n\n<p>This phrase is not from the Bible, so why does it appear in the Sh'ma prayer? In the ancient Temple, when the cantor recited the Sh'ma prayer on the high holidays, he would actually pronounce God's Name (Y-H-W-H) when reading the first verse of the Sh'ma. After God's name was enunciated, the congregation would say, Blessed is the name of His Royal Majesty.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://a%20href=http://www.amazon.com/Ha-Siddur-Hashalem-Daily-Prayer-Book/dp/0884820459\">Birnbaum Siddur</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whatthebible.blogspot.com/2016/03/what-baruch-shem-kvod-malchuto-actually.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">What the Bible Actually Says</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>“Baruch shem kavod malchuto l’olam va-ed”  should translate to:     \"And be a witness to the world that God’s people are blessed”</p>\n\n<p>What all the traditional translations have in common is “l’olam va-ed”  gets translated to “Forever & ever” or “for all eternity”. L’olam va-ed is a modern Hebrew expression and is accepted to mean “forever and ever” mainly because the Shema is translated this way.  But this translation completely ignores the word “va-ed” and relies entirely on the word “l’olam” which does means “forever”.  The rest of the traditional translations flow from the error of ignoring the word “va-ed”. </p>\n\n<p>The word “olam” literally means “world”.<br>\nAdon Olam, Master of the World,<br>\nTikkun olam, repairing, healing, or perfecting the world.<br>\nOlam Haba,   the next world<br>\nOlam HaZeh, this world…  </p>\n\n<p>L’Olam is the word Olam with the letter lamed (לְ) in front of it.  A  lamed (לְ) in front of a word adds the preposition “to” (a point of limit in time), literally l’olam is “to the world” i.e. to the end of the world, hence “forever”. Forever is an acceptable common definition of the word L’Olam and thus we have the all the traditional translations of this phrase.</p>\n\n<p>However, if we translate the expression “l’olam va-ed” literally we must translate both words. </p>\n\n<p>L’olam is “to the world” and “va-ed” breaks down to  “ed”  עֶד  which means “witness”  with the letter vav (וָ) in front of it. In front of a word the letter “vav” is the conjunction “and”.<br>\nSo… “l’olam va-ed”  is literally translated “to the world and witness”, or “and (be) witness to the world”.<br>\nSo a literal translation consists of:<br>\nBaruch…  Blessed<br>\nShem…  God  (as in baruch hashem…  God is blessed…a commom expression)<br>\nKavod… honorable<br>\nMalchuto… his kingdom<br>\nl’olam va-ed… and (be) witness to the world</p>\n\n<p>“Baruch shem kavod malchuto l’olam va-ed”  should be translated  to mean… “And be a witness to the world that God’s honorable kingdom is blessed”.   OK, what does that mean?\nThe question to ask is what does “God’s honorable Kingdom” mean? \nA King’s Kingdom consists of 2 things, His lands and His people. In this case we are referring to his “honorable” kingdom. Land cannot be honorable only people can be honorable. Therefore God’s honorable kingdom means God’s people… Ysrael.<br>\nI.e. … Baruch shem kavod malchuto l’olam va-ed is a directive...  “And be a witness to the world that God’s people are blessed”..</p>\n\n<p>The concept that those who believe in the oneness of God are witnesses is re-iterated by the Tefillan.  In the head portion of the Tefillan, the Shema is enclosed in the box and it is traditional for the first sentence to be scribed with the letter ayin “עֶ” and the letter dalet “ד” in bold letters spelling the word  עֶד  i.e. witness. By Putting the tefillan on the forehead and between the eyes we reinforce the concept that we are witnesses… </p>\n\n\n",

To expose this very fact is the reason why the Torah wishes to elaborate on the process of construction rather than merely saying that it was done as commanded.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14386&st=&pgnum=354\">Abarbanel</a> extends the third of the Ralbag's reasons in that since the order of construction was changed from the order of commandment (for whatever reason) one may have thought that other details may also have been changed from those given at the time of commandment to build. Because of this, the Torah elaborated on the details of what was constructed to show that they are the same as what was commanded to be constructed.</p>\n\n<p>M. D. Cassuto, responding (as always) to the early Bible critics of his time, brings evidence to support Ralbag's first notion. That is, that in literature of the time period it was not uncommon to repeat the details of actions that have already been previously outlined. (Cassuto is also quoted, I think, by Nechama Leibowitz in her discussion on the topic.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Exodus.36.8.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויעשו כל חכם לב בעשי המלאכה את המשכן עשר יריעות הנה החזיר בתורה מלאכת\nהמשכן חמש פעמים, כי הזכיר את כולה בצואה בפרט ובכלל...... <strong>ועל הכלל כל\nזה דרך חבה ודרך מעלה, לומר כי חפץ השם במלאכה ומזכיר אותה בתורתו פעמים\nרבות להרבות שכר לעוסקים בה</strong>,</p>\n<p>כענין מה שאמרו במדרש יפה שיחת עבדי אבות\nלפני הקב''ה מתורתם של בנים, שהרי פרשתו של אליעזר שנים ושלשה דפין היא:</p>\n<p>The Torah has repeated the [description of the] work of the Tabernacle\nfive times....... <strong>In general, then, all this repetition in the\naccount of the Tabernacle is a sign of love and distinction, showing\nthat G-d desires the work, and He mentions it in His Torah many times\nin order to increase the reward of those who engage themselves in its\nstudy.</strong></p>\n<p>This is similar to what the Rabbis have said in the Midrash:\n“The ordinary conversation of the servants of the patriarchs’ homes is\nmore pleasing to the Holy One, blessed be He, than even the\nTorah-discourses of their children, for the section about Eliezer [as\nhe recounts his journey], comprises two or three columns in the Torah,\n[whereas many important principles of the Torah are derived from only\nslight references in the text].”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short then, Hashem wants to express how much He values the mishkan.

Clearly, the Mishkan is of utmost importance to the spiritual and physical well-being of the Israelites. The repetition of the details of its construction--first the specs and later as it's actually constructed--testify to its importance in maintaining the constancy of contact between God and the people. But it's also instructive to look at the order of events (even though Talmud teaches \"ayn mukhdam umukhar ba-torah,\" there is no before or after in the Torah). Moses receives the specifications for building the Mishkan; then he's called down the mountain to deal with the people's falling into corruption with building of a Golden Calf, at which point the tablets are shattered. Moses then ascends Mt. Sinai once again to receive the second set of tablets, after which the Mishkan is actually erected. Midrash Tanchuma teaches that \"the gold of the Mishkan comes to cover for (i.e. atone for) the gold of the Calf.\" Perhaps through such detailed repetition of the Mishkan specifications, the Torah is demonstrating how a space of receptivity (the space between the two cherubim on the cover of the Holy Ark), not a solid object/idol of gold, must lie at the very heart of our ability to connect with the Holy One. Thus the very order of Torah itself--a description of Mishkan, interrupted by the sin of the Calf (which must be destroyed, ground up, leaving an emptiness where there was once a solidity), followed by a description of Mishkan--mirrors this deep truth.</p>\n\n\n",

Does this also apply to a katan (minor)? I'm asking in general could a katan have the status of a \"m'chalel shabbos b'farhasia\"? Although it might be difficult to find something where this would make a difference I still want to know in general if the din would apply, why or why not. Obviously we are speaking in the case of a katan who is already somewhat of a bar-das (intelligent) and is able to understand that they are not allowed to be m'challel Shabbos. (My original thought is that it should be asking in the case of a child who is 9 and above.)</p>\n\n<p>The case of touching wine might not be such a good example of where we could say it makes a difference since I know the poskim say that a non-Jewish child can't make yain nesech (the particular case I saw was an Arab child which is perhaps better since they are not idol worshippers.

For some explanation, as I understand it:</p>\n<p>A minor is not liable for transgressions.  The Rema in OC 343:1 says (translation mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וקטן שהכה אביו או עבר שאר עברות בקטנותו אע״פ שאינו צריך תשובה כשיגדל מ״מ טוב לו שיקבל על עזמו איזה דבר לתשובה ולכפרה אע״פ שעבר קדם שנעשה בר ענשין</p>\n<p>A minor who struck his father, or performed other transgressions while a minor, even though he doesn't have to do repentence when he grows up, even still it is good for him to take upon himself some measure of repentance and atonement, even though he transgressed before he was subject to punishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The language of the Rema implies that although it is in many (all?) cases incumbent on the father (and mother, according to some; and the Beit Din, in some cases) to rebuke him, the minor himself is not liable. This is, the Mishna Berura mentions, only when the minor is able to understand what it means to transgress a particular commandment (when the minor is בר הבנה - Bar Havana).  The Mishna Berura uses the language (ad loc. s.v. tzrichim l'hafrisho):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דכיון דהגיע לחנוך מטל על כל אדם להפרישו מאסורא כמו על אביו והא דקימא לן דאין מצוין להפרישו בשלא הגיע לחנוך</p>\n<p>When a minor reaches the age of teaching, it is incumbent on every person to separate [the minor] from forbidden things, just as [it is incumbent] on the father, and that which we established that we are not commanded to separate [the minor] is a case of when the minor has not reached the age of teaching.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see that to rebuke the child is incumbent upon the father, mother, beit din, ... but there is nothing on the child himself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Reguardless of wether the minor is aware that it is ossur to do melacha on shabbat. since the minor isnt of an age of bar/bat mitzvah, they cant get the death penalty. However if they were to cook food they lose their trust in \"eid echad ne'eman bissurin.\" However the difference between a minor and a halachic adult, is that if there is an eid by the minor and is watching the cooking procedure then the food is kosher, while by an adult the food is forbidden. the reason is because by the case of the minor we are only worried about the validility of the kashruth. Reguarding an adult besides the validility of the kashruth, we also don't eat the food as to show that we want him to feel rejected and repent.</p>\n\n\n",

What seems to come together from those verses, as well as from the broad number of commentators on those sources (ranging from the Radak to Rav Kook, the Netziv to Ben Gurion and Jabotinsky) is that the concept of Or Lagoyim applies to the nation as a whole, and not specifically to any individual. We, as a nation following the moral precepts of the Torah, are to be a light unto the nations of the world, leading the way in devotion to morality. Being that it is something that functions on the national level, I don't believe that it would require you to necessarily feel responsible to defend or expound upon Judaism to any random inquirer.

Or what?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I tried my very best to research this question, and I sent the following email to two major Rabbinic bodies in England:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>Firstly, I apologize if this is the \"wrong address\" for these questions.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if there was (historically or currently) a standard form for Rabbinic Contracts in Great Britain.  I was specifically wondering if there was ever a clause stating that the Rabbi must arrive 15 minutes early to services, and if so, when was it removed, and why.  Would anyone at the office of the Chief Rabbi have information about this, or would you be able to provide me with another resource that may be able to help me?</p>\n<p>Thank you so much!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Office of the Chief Rabbinate of England responded with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for your further email.</p>\n<p><strong>Each community or synagogue body has its own arrangements and there is no standard form that applies across the UK.</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for getting in touch with our office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>(my emphasis)</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore, if we assume that Rabbi Rubin meant that there was a standard contract for Rabbis in England, this has changed, and is no longer the case.  They did not provide a time that this change happened, nor did they comment on the clause itself.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we can only speculate as to why such a contract was scrapped. Possible reasons may be that more smaller Shuls/Shteibels were opening that were not using the standard contract, or that Shuls themselves wanted more control over specifics or any number of possibilities.</p>\n<p>However, it is also possible that Rabbi Rubin was simply saying that in \"every\" contract, this was a standard request, in which case this does not add anything to the conversation.  There could be a number of possible reasons why such a clause may have been removed, possibly due to heshy's reason in his answer, possibly due to less people caring about that, but again, this is all speculation.</p>\n<p>(Note that I also reached out to the author on this <a href=\"http://theinformalproject.com/contact-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">internet contact form</a>, but received no response.  I would encourage others to do the same, in hopes of getting a response.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>it is difficult to conjecture on other people's behavior (but it would be interesting if a mi yodea user has actual data on the topic.)</p>\n\n<p>I would venture to guess that the 15 minute rule has to do with the availability of the rabbi to his congregents.</p>\n\n<p>This might have become moot with advanced technology, so the rabbi can avail himself to whoever might need his time, in a much more convenient way.</p>\n\n\n",

It would seem that we are taking a step backwards, and not evidencing our free will to perform Avodah Sh'balev.

The Avudarham says that we say כשם שמקדישים, \"like they [the angels] do\" in order to not use Kedusha as a means of glorifying ourselves, even though really we are first and primary.  Nefesh HaChaim (seemingly) takes it to refer to the nature of their Kedusha being immediately after ours, enough to be called \"at the same time.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is also why we say נקדש - let <em>us</em> be mekadesh.  <strong>Rabbeinu Yehuda Ben Yakar</strong> explains that in Yotzer and Uva Letzion we are just telling over what the angels do.

The people had thought the Temple would always be around -- and then they needed to cope when it wasn't. Jeremiah and Kings end the same way -- after all the talk, the exile happened.\n(Last year's YU Tisha-B'Av-to-go had a piece on this.)</p>\n\n<p>Chronicles was edited by Ezra. He had to give the people hope that they could return and build the second Temple. It thus has a whole lot more of a positive focus, and a lot more on the glory of King David -- the template for the future Jewish monarch who will redeem the people. Chronicles ends on a high note -- \"time to go back to the holy land!\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The generally accepted position in academic bible study is that the book of Kings was written first and gives more specifics for the time period from the death of David to the Babylonian conquest.</p>\n\n<p>The book of Chronicles is usually judged to be written later, around the time of Ezra the Scribe.  Some scholars claim that Ezra himself was the author due to continuities of style, but this is not universally accepted.  For evidence of this, compare the text of the two books regarding Cyrus's Edict (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25b36.htm#23\" rel=\"nofollow\">2 Chronicles 36</a>) and (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35a01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ezra 1</a>).  In substance, Chronicals differs from Kings in that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25a01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">starts its story</a> at Adam rather than at the death of David.</p></li>\n<li><p>It focuses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Kings#Kings_and_2_Chronicles\" rel=\"nofollow\">almost exclusively</a> on the southern kingdom of Judah, almost ignoring events in the northern kingdom of Israel.</p></li>\n<li><p>It does not reference other existing histories (now lost) like Kings does (\"Book of the Acts of Solomon\", \"Annals of the Kings of Judah\", \"Chronicles of the Kings of Israel\")</p></li>\n<li><p>Tells the biblical history with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Chronicles#Themes\" rel=\"nofollow\">different bias</a> than Kings, emphasizing the Davidic dynasty and the temple itself.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While neither Kings nor Chronicles is \"history\" by modern standards, Kings is closer to \"telling what happened\" whereas Chronicals is more like retelling the story to provide a long contextual arc glorifying the temple and the house of David.</p>\n\n\n",

There are situations in which salt may not be needed although there are mystical considerations to use it (see <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/06/salt-and-challah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Torah musings</a>). Again there is no difference between Shabbos and weekday. However as Torah musings says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>some have the custom to refrain from adding salt on Friday night\n  because no sacrifices were burned in the Temple at that time (see\n  Divrei Ha-Rav, p. 169; Piskei Teshuvos, vol. 2. 167:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Torah musings tries to deal with the fact that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>many people only salt their bread on Shabbos but not during the week?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The only answer I can think of is social. Nowadays, people tend to eat\n  bread during the week as part of a sandwich. Often, a sandwich is\n  already salty. Therefore, people are not used to eating plain bread\n  during the week and, when they do, they do not think to salt it.\n  However, this explanation is insufficient because according to the\n  Rema, even a sandwich requires salt. Perhaps only our Shabbos tables\n  are compared to an altar. Or maybe the Rema’s custom is just to have\n  salt on the tables and not necessarily to put it on bread. But then\n  why do we salt challah?</p>\n  \n  <p>The inconsistency is difficult to explain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/sh/ht/fn/48969636.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aish</a> instructs how to cut the bread on Shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>Step 4 is </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The leader picks up both challahs, with the bottom one slightly\n  closer to him. Some leave the challah cover on during the blessing,\n  while others remove it at this point. The bottom challah is grazed\n  lightly with the knife.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On a weekday, an incision should be made in the loaf before the blessing at the place where it is well baked and after the blessing the loaf should be cut at that place. On Shabbos, when we need two whole loaves, it is better not to make a deep cut that might decrease the wholeness of one of the loaves - hence the reference to \"grazing\" in the Aish article. See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14164&st=&pgnum=109\" rel=\"nofollow\">O Ch 167 (1) MB 10</a> for the details.</p>\n\n<p>See more detail from Aish <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Challah-Breaking-Bread-on-Shabbat.html?catid=907399\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. </p>\n\n\n",

See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Of course there are! In the מדרש הנעלם <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/35765/does-the-torah-tell-us-what-to-eat-at-the-purim-meal/35766#35766\">here</a> the Rabbis tell us that the Purim seudah should consist of five food items:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1) Challah - Naturally the first food item is bread, since every festive meal must have bread. But on Shabbos and Festivals it is not called bread, but Challah. The reason for the difference is because the *mispar katan mispari gematria** (MKMG) of the word for bread (לחם) is 6, a number which relates to six non-holy days of the week. But the MKMG of חלה is 7, which relates generally to the holiness of Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>*A method of gematria where the total numerical value of a word is reduced to one digit by adding up the gematria values of the letters. Should the sum of these numbers exceed 9, the integer values of the total are repeatedly added to each other to produce a single-digit figure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>   But the number 7 also specifically relates to the special day of Purim, because even though it is called פורים in the plural, we see from the verse in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3309.htm#26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 9:26</a> עַל-כֵּן קָרְאוּ לַיָּמִים הָאֵלֶּה פוּרִים עַל-שֵׁם הַפּוּר that this refers to the two days of Purim and Shushan Purim, but each individual day is called פור, and the MKMG of פור is 7.</p>\n  \n  <p>2) Wine - An essential part of every festive meal, but even more so on Purim, because the days of Purim are called days of מִשְׁתֶּה וְשִׂמְחָה (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3309.htm#17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 9:17</a>), and the word משתה relates the word שתיה (drinking), and so Purim are days of rejoicing with drinking. But whereas we start with wine (at Kiddush) before the challah on Shabbos and Festivals, because of the rule ונהפוך הוא (it was reversed) on Purim we have the wine after the challah. And it should be noted that the MKMG of יין is also 7!</p>\n  \n  <p>3) Fish - The Mazel (Zodiac sign) of the month of Adar, and therefore eating fish at the Purim seudah is a סימן טוב. And not surprisingly the MKMG of דג is 7.</p>\n  \n  <p>4) Liver - No festive meal could be considered complete without some <em>Fleishig</em> (at least for non-vegetarians), but on Purim we are told that this should be liver. The reason for this is that liver in Hebrew is כבד which relates to the word כבוד (honor) and another word for honor is יקר. Thus, liver alludes to the posuk in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3308.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 8:16</a> לַיְּהוּדִים הָיְתָה אוֹרָה וְשִׂמְחָה, וְשָׂשֹׂן וִיקָר - \"The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor\".</p>\n  \n  <p>   But there is a dispute about which liver is the best to use. One opinion is to use turkey liver, because turkey is called הודו (give thanks), and thus alludes also to the thanksgiving of the day to Hashem for saving us. But others disagree because bird meat is not really meat, as it says in the Torah <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 15:10</a> וְאֶת-הַצִּפֹּר לֹא בָתָר. Therefore, they hold that one should use beef liver.</p>\n  \n  <p>5) Soufflé - The last thing is a fluffy dessert which the Rabbis explain is made from flour, eggs, almond milk and sugar, and what we would nowadays call a soufflé. It is not clear what this dessert alludes to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These then are the five essential food items which we should have at our Purim seudah. And in order to make it easy for us to remember them, the Rabbis incorporated them into a song with a very catchy tune:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>♫Challah, Wine, Fish, Liver, Soufflé   ♪Liver, Soufflé   ♪Liver, Soufflé♫<br>\n  ♫Challah, Wine, Fish, Liver, Soufflé   ♪Liver, Soufflé   ♪Liver, Soufflé♫<br>\n  ♫Ad She, Ad Shelo Yoda   ♪Ad She, Ad Shelo Yoda   ♪Ad Shelo Yoda♫<br>\n  ♫Ad She, Ad Shelo Yoda   ♪Ad She, Ad Shelo Yoda   ♪Ad Shelo Yoda♫  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Since we all know from <em>Toras Imecha</em> - aka <em>Der yiddishe mama</em> - \"Drinking in the middle of a meal will fill you up!\".  Therefore the Rabbi's did not enact what we should eat by the Purim meal, since the main mitzva is to drink and they knew <em>der yiddishe mama</em> would get in the way were there certain traditional foods required to be to be eaten.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<ul>\n<li>One must eat Carobs (which sounds like swords in Hebrew)</li>\n<li>One must eat eyes (which see - Lirot - which also mean \"to shoot\")</li>\n<li>One must eat barbequed meat on a skewer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All to remember the battle</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One must also eat a young sheep to remember how Haman was hung.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

It has two heating elements: one heats from below the turntable, like a hot plate. A heating element above broils a section of the pizza at a time as it rotates. There are no enclosed spaces that would trap steam as in a traditional oven or <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14869/using-a-non-kosher-toaster-oven\">toaster oven</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Can a non-kosher pizza oven of this type (such as at a workplace or common area) be used for kosher food? If so, what steps would be necessary?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/pdfImages/d9/d9d73a9c-4eae-4563-81ca-54c83edab14f.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is a PDF of a manual with diagrams.</a></p>\n\n<p>(CYLOR)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The entire discussion hinges on certain assumptions, the primary ones being that steam or condensation is an issue in this case and that steel/aluminum is <em>boleya</em>. In addition to this, the discussion of steam being an issue is in an enclosed oven (both vented and non-vented models) which seems would not be an issue in this case, being that it is fully open (cf. `Arokh HaShulhan 92:55).</p>\n\n<p>While it is true that the Rama in the Shulhan `Arukh (92:8) is <em>mahmir</em> regarding steam (<em>zeyah</em>) relying on a <em>teshuvah</em> of the Rosh (20:26) [who quotes a Mishnah in Masekheth Makhshirim (2:2)], the fact is that the <em>sugya</em> in the <em>Gemara</em> which discusses the whole issue of an oven (b.Pesahim 76b, see also y.Terumoth 10:2) and kosher and non-kosher foods being cooked in it does not even mention <em>zeyah</em> as an issue, concludes that <em>reyha</em> (aroma) is <em>law miltha</em> (not a halakhic issue), and is only discussing kosher and non-kosher meat <strong><em>simultaneously</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Also, as is common in Ashkenazi <em>pesiqath halakhah</em>, there is an equivocation between the laws of <em>hekhsher/tumah wa-ttaharah</em> with the laws of <em>kashruth</em>. While there is some overlap, they are definitely separate, as anyone who reads <em>Hilkhoth Tumath Okhalin</em> and <em>Hilkhoth Ma'akhaloth Asuroth</em> will be able to easily ascertain. Thus, the reason why Rosh has to bring a proof from m.Makhshirim regarding the condensation in a bath house being <em>tamei</em> is because the whole idea of steam is not considered an issue within the scope of <em>kashruth</em> until the equivocation of the two areas of <em>halakhah</em> at a much later time in Jewish history. Hazal makes no such claim in the sources which they left to us.</p>\n\n<p>As for the types of materials which are subject to <em>beli`uth</em> (absorption), the <em>Gemara</em> is discussing <em>klei heres</em> (porous pottery/adobe) and not metal at all. Many today hold that metal (stainless steel/aluminum) is not <em>boleya</em> and thus not subject to these laws anyhow, except by those who feel it is necessary to be <em>mahmir</em>.</p>\n\n<p>All this being said, I would say that <em>le'aniyuth da`ati</em> that all that needs to be done to use this pizza oven is a thorough cleaning to remove outer food residue (particles, grease, oil, etc.), and perhaps a lining of the pan where the pizza actually sits with foil as a caution.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/82672/jewish/Koshering-Appliances-and-Utensils.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> on koshering utensils, it seem that your rotating pizza oven most nearly approximates a broiler (at least from on top). Certainly the steam etc. from the cooking pizza must reach the upper heater. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore I would think that the koshering method described there would be appropriate i.e. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Broiler</p>\n  \n  <p>As mentioned previously, the broiler pan and grill can be koshered\n  only by using direct heat, using a blowtorch, causing them to glow\n  red. This is necessary because non-kosher food may have been cooked\n  directly on the pan or grill. If this method is not feasible, the\n  simplest procedure is to replace the pan with a new pan and kosher the\n  empty broiler cavity by cleaning and setting it to broil for forty\n  minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The removable baking pan of your apparatus equates to the broiler pan and you will have to  get the lower element hot for 40 mins or use a blowtorch on it and as you say CYLOR. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The tray would require libun gamur because the heating element appears to be directly under the tray cooking the pizza.

Anyone keeping genuinely kosher peshutim in the market is, IMHO, doing a very good thing. That being said, one thing seems suspect to me.</p>\n\n<p>He bills this as a pre- Bar Mitzvah project. Having people under bar mitzvah make tefilin enters into controversial territory. While RaMBaM holds that anyone can make the leather for battim because untouched rawhide would be just as good, and any <i>ibbud</i> is therefore not essential, others including the mechaber disagree (O\"C 32). Furthermore, the kids are not making the leather, they are folding the parchment into battim, inserting the parshiyos, and sewing them up, all of which <em>are</em> essential so RaMBaM's argument would not apply. I recall a section in the Keset which touches on what pesulim can and can't do but I'm pretty sure inserting parshiyos and sewing battim is on the can't list (given that a qualified sofer is supposed to know Keset by heart, I should definitely start another chazara).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Per <a href=\"http://kesher-tefillin.com/Letters2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kesher Tefilins website</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My semi-original design has the halachic approval of Rabbi Nissim\n  Karelitz and his rabbinic court.

But Moshe feared the God of his forefathers and did not sleep with her, because he remembered the oath which Avraham made his servant Eliezer swear, saying: Do not take a wife for my son from the daughters of Canaan. And so too did Yitzchok when Yaakov fled because of Eisav - he commanded him and said to him: Do not marry from the descendants of Ham, because we remember that God gave the descendants of Ham as servants to the descendants of Shem and to the descendants of Yefes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Midrash continues that he ruled there for forty years, after which time his 'wife' complained to the ministers and the people:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Behold, for forty years this one has ruled over Cush, but he has never slept with me, and he has never worshiped our idols!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She advised them to instead make her son the king, and they agreed to this and sent Moshe away with a lot of gifts and with great honor.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, according to this Midrash, Moshe had been 'married' before he came to Midian and married Tzipporah, (although since he never consummated the first 'marriage' it could be argued that it should not be considered a real marriage) and the Targum Yonasan and the Rashbam on the posuk in parshas Beha'alosecha use this Midrash to explain that the Cushite woman mentioned to in the posuk there refers to this first Cushite wife.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch (among others) points out that the term used is \"Al Odos\" which would normally be translated as \"on behalf of\". Rav Hirsch also states that \"Isha Cushis\" is not being literal but is a complaint on behalf of Tzipporah that Moshe is treating her as if she was as separated or far apart from him as the Cushiyim are in the idiom in Amos 9:7. A marriage in which the partners live sexually apart is objected to and improper.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch (and others) state that this does not refer to the medrash of Moshe \"marrying\" the queen of Cush before he went to Midian. I assert that Rav Hirsch would have mentioned it if there were other wives mentioned in other places. Thus, the answer to your question would be that this is indeed Moshe having only marries Tziporah who was his only wife.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does a buyer owe a seller anything for a windfall that neither knew about at the time of the sale?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard recently that a man brought a silver certificate into a pawn store to sell it (it was the pawn store featured on a History Channel television show that documents its more interesting purchases).  Although silver certificates no longer can be used to purchase silver, they have value as collectors' pieces, as old coins and stamps do, and the value depends on their condition and how rare the item is.  The pawn store and the seller agreed to a price based on their joint belief that silver certificates from that era and in that condition are worth an approximate price, and then added to that amount money for the buyer's overhead and profit margin.  When the buyer took the silver certificate to be graded and appraised, the appraiser noticed that the back side of the certificate had been printed upside down, making the certificate worth 10 times more than originally thought.  Although neither the buyer nor seller were aware of the certificate's true collector's value, now that the facts are out, does the buyer owe the seller a share of his windfall?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Normally, in cases of significant underprice, the seller can demand a retraction of the sale (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>Choshen Mishpat</em> 237:2, q.v.), though he cannot demand that the sale remain intact but the buyer pay the difference in price (<em>S'ma</em> :6). Although that doesn't normally apply to documents (<em>SA</em> :29), it does when the underprice is by more than half (<em>Rama</em> :29 and <em>S'ma</em> :52). (Anyway, I suspect they would apply to this type of document, which is valuable not as a document but as personalty, so the reason documents are excluded normally probably wouldn't apply; see e.g. <em>Pische S'shuva</em> :22.) Although these rules don't normally apply to antiques, they do when there is a clear discrepancy between the price paid and the market value (<a href=\"http://www.businesshalacha.com/articles/valuable-oldie\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>). Finally, although the discussion of underpricing generally assumes the buyer did it on purpose, I see no one who says that that's a condition.</p>\n\n<p>However, if this is relevant to you, then don't rely on what you read here: consult your rabbi.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Notwithstanding msh210's comment, I spoke to Rabbi Dovid Rosenbaum (YI Shomrai Emunah, Silver Spring) about this. He said that usually merchants in this field would agree with the seller that the buyer would take any risk of loss, as well as benefit from any gain in value. Thus, it is in the seller's interest to have the item appraised first by an expert, because given the conditions set for the sale, he would not be able to protest the sale to the beis din. If, however, the parties did not agree to the condition, then the halacha would be <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/35900\">as msh210 stated</a>. The owners of this particular pawn store normally tell sellers that they assume the risk of loss (usually as a bargaining ploy), but that type of notice would appear to be sufficient, according to Rabbi Rosenbaum.</p>\n\n\n",

The Tur in the beginning of Hilchos Rosh Chodesh says that really the 12 Roshei Chadashim should have been Yomim Toivim, however, because of the Cheit Ha’eigel, Rosh Chodesh was turned from a Yom Tov to an almost ordinary day of the week. The Shulchan Aruch says that you should be Marbe K’tzas Simcha on Rosh Chodesh. However, it does not have a Din of Yom Tov. The women who did not sin by the Cheit Ha’eigel have a very special obligation and Mitzvah to treat Rosh Chodesh as a bit of a feeling as a Yom Tov. He suggests that on Shabbos Rosh Chodesh we retain the original aspect of Yom Tov. Since Shabbos is Mai’ain Oilam Haba, and is L’maila Min Hacheit, when Rosh Chodesh falls out on a Shabbos it has a higher level of Kedusha like a Yom Tov. Hence the change of nusach.

The <em>Bavli</em> says that these restrictions were rabbinic enactments. On 14 <em>amud</em> 2 it protests the inclusion of one item on that list:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"And one who immersed that day\"??

Thus, <em>t'ruma</em> is invalidated by touching, as, otherwise, why is it saying \"וטהר\", implying until then not completely <em>tahor</em>? And this <em>keli</em> is not subject to eating. But we do not say it has <em>tum'a</em>, for it is not called \"טמא\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explanation is very opaque.

The clear implication of that verse is that there's something missing in its <em>tahor</em> status before sunset; the only thing that can be wrong with a <em>keli</em> before sunset is that it can invalidate <em>t'ruma</em> by touching it. (We know it doesn't have <strong>real</strong> <em>tum'a</em>. Even though the verse says \"וטמא עד הערב\", it doesn't mean it: it doesn't say so in Lev. 22 (see below), so it can't mean it here either, as a <em>keli</em> won't have <em>tum'a</em> where a person does not; rather \"וטמא\" in Lev. 11 must be used for some exegesis somewhere.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0322.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow\">The verse cited by the <em>Bavli</em>, \"ובא השמש וטהר\" (Lev. 22:7),</a> is talking about someone who touched someone who touched a dead <em>sheretz</em>, not a <em>keli</em>. There, we wouldn't know it's talking about invalidating <em>t'ruma</em> by touch, as there are other reasons such a person may be called not-<em>tahor</em> before sunset. (Specifically, it could mean the man can't <strong>eat</strong> <em>t'ruma</em> — unlike a <em>keli</em>, which of course doesn't eat.) The verse in Lev. 11 thus sheds light on the verse in Lev. 22, telling us that it, too, is referring to a restriction on touching <em>t'ruma</em>, which is what the <em>Bavli</em> here refers to.</p>\n\n\n",

But your argument against saying that Hashem is the only Elohim is purely semantic. English also has words with multiple meanings, and we have no difficulty determining the intended meaning from context. That is how we know, for example, that when an object is stolen from an unpaid watchman, he is to appear before judges. You are right that sometimes the word could (at least logically) be read in a few different ways. However, if we are to say that Hashem is the only Elohim, it is obvious what we mean.</p>\n\n<p>There is one more big problem with your question. אלוהים (<em>elohim</em>) is <strong>not</strong> the generic Hebrew word for the word \"god\". It is a particular name for our God. That word is אל (<em>el</em>).  We could easily say that Hashem is the only <em>el</em>, and then there is no problem of strange seeming-pluralization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>By the way, before you comment on this. The plural of אל is אלים (<em>Elim</em>), <strong>not</strong> אלוהים (<em>Elohim</em>). It is a different (though obviously related) word.</p>\n\n\n",

David starts by noting that great and powerful people have persecuted him, including his own son, Absalom. Then he expresses his hopeful trust that God will deliver him from these travails. Then, in verse 7, he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא אִירָא מֵרִבְבוֹת עָם / I will not fear the myriads of people<br />\nאֲשֶׁר סָבִיב שָׁתוּ עָלָי.‏ / who drank a round on me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess he bought Absalom's people a round of drinks, and he's therefore not afraid of them. Is that a correct understanding? If so, this doesn't seem to fit in with the psalm's theme of trust in God; an explanation would be appreciated.

But he went one step further and had several thousand of his friends surround the vineyard drinking wine so that Absalom would have give the place a wide berth and thus not even get close to him.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the verse means \"I will not be afraid because of the tens of thousands of people who are around me, drinking for my sake.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Avshalom was a נזיר עולם - see Gemara Nazir 4b, three lines from the end of the amud.

For you have smitten all of my enemies, Lechi!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After ten thousand botched root canals, and equally many angry, wicked enemies, David had no hope but to trust in Gd. His prayer was answered speedily, though. Right in the middle of his reprimanding Lechi, Gd sent a skilled oral surgeon, named Selah, who sorted everything out, (with the help of plenty of anesthetic):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>!שני רשעים שברת! ...לד' הישועה על עמך ברכתך, סלה</p>\n<p><em>You've broken the teeth of these wicked men!

At the time that this episode took place, David was a minor warlord in the Judean desert and was so hard up that he couldn't even open up a tab at the seedy Philistine tavern.

At a Conservative synagogue, the kiddush would be cream herring and egg salad.  At a Catholic church, the kiddush would be beef rigatoni with Parmesan cheese (some hold of lasagna with sausage, but that is a minority opinion).  At a Lutheran church, the kiddush would be a green bean casserole with bacon bits.  At a Baptist church, the kiddish would be Kentucky Fried Chicken.

If you arrive somewhere after services are over and are unsure where you are (maybe there is no sign, or maybe you were blindfolded and dragged in, or maybe you are in Amish country and everyone looks like Jews in straw hats), you can use the food at the kiddush as a fairly reliable way to know who you are hanging out with and if you can trust their kashrut.</p>\n\n<p>If you are still not certain (maybe you are in a shul in New Mexico and the cholent looks like chili), make a bracha.

A prayer is when one talks to God (<a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/prayer\" rel=\"nofollow\">OED</a>, <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prayer\" rel=\"nofollow\">MW</a>); it need not contain a bracha. A piyyut is a style of a text (which may or not be a prayer) <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/piyyut\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar to poetry</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, there are selections which are prayers, piyyutim, both, or none. <em>Mi Sheberach</em> is a prayer (note the absence of a bracha), but not a piyyut. <em>Yigdal</em> is a piyyut, but not a prayer. <em>Veye'esayu</em> (on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) is a piyyut and a prayer.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the second part of Aleinu is a prayer (since we acknowledge God as the ruler of all, and pray that He be universally recognized as such soon). It can be argued that since part of it is a prayer, the whole thing is. It is not a piyyut.</p>\n\n\n",

This is the meaning of נר איש וביתו (shabbos <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.21b.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">21b</a>). When candles are lit for a household, all who are associated fulfill their obligation. A visitor is not considered to be a part of the household in which he is staying. He is considered a separate household. Therefore, he does not fulfill his obligation as part of the hosting household's lighting. If his wife or someone from his household is lighting, he fulfills his obligation with them. If not, he must light himself. If he can't or doesn't want to, he can fulfill his obligation by partial ownership of the candles being lit by his host. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.677\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishna berura</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aruch_HaShulchan.1.677\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">aruch hashulchan</a> in OC 677 for most of the above.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You are correct about the halacha about a guest contributing a perutah towards the Chanukah candles. And interesting enough there is a דעה in the גמרא (we don't paskin like this דעה) but there is a דעה in מסכת סוכה who says that a person isn't Yotzeh residing in his succah unless he owns it. So contributing to the succah would be like having a חלק of the succah. However since we don't paskin like this דעה we cannot use him as a proof to your question. However the answer I believe is that the guidelines for the mitzvah of נר חנוכה was set up strictly by the rabbis who said that a person has to sell the clothes off his back to be Yotzeh the mitzvah! Chazal doesn't say that about נר שבת or נר יום טוב. So if you have to go to that extent then surely you must have a חלק in the candles by contributing a perutah</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The halachah is that everyone, man or woman, must light a menorah. If you're a member of the household then you're included in the person lighting, if you're not, you can contribute a peruta to be included. By suka, the halachah is that you must live in a Sukah, not own a Sukah. I know you gave Sukah as an example, but that was the only example you gave. What's another example, to 'hear' the shofar?</p>\n\n<p>Just to note, some people, like Lubavitchers, have the minhag for all males to light their own menorah.</p>\n\n\n",

When reciting this line, one pauses after <em>elilim</em> (\"idols\") before saying va'Hashem (\"but Hashem\"), to make certain that Hashem is not being identified as one of the idols.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To try to answer the rest of your question, \"El\" appears relatively rarely in Tanach.  You can find it with Abraham in the name <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0117.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">El Shaddai</a>, presumably because he did not know the name Hashem (you know which name I mean without me spelling it) as that was not revealed until the time of Moses.</p>\n<p>It is far more common to find \"Elohim\" which can be used as one of God's proper names (very often) or as a concept of \"gods\" (as in the excerpt above).  I suspect that because of these two usages of \"Elohim\" (even not counting its usage as judges and rulers) and because we also have the proper name Hashem, means the the Tanach only rarely uses the shorter name \"El\".</p>\n<p>It also might be noteworthy that \"El\" was a name that was used by the Canaanites for the highest god in their pantheon. That would be a reason that the prophets prefer to stay away from that term. Similarly, while one could theoretically call God \"Baal\" (master), we do not because that is a polytheistic Canaanite usage that the prophets worked hard for hundreds of years to get us away from.</p>\n\n\n",

I understand why you would read this as an appeal to 'minhag', but it could be for a fundamentally different reason. R' Elchonon Wasserman (in Kuntras Divrei Sofrim) explains that the acceptance of all of Israel has the halakhic force of a fully functional Sanhedrin (which is binding as per the Torah in parshas Shoftim). He understands that the Sanhedrin itself is only given this power because it is meant to act as a representative body of the entire Jewish people, so when the Talmud was actually accepted by the entire religious community, following it is equally obligatory. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Rama (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.25.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Choshen Mishpat 25:1</a>) takes for granted that one can't argue on the Talmud, and the Gr\"a in his comment there provides the source for this rule: 'Ravina and Rav Ashi are the last of horaah' (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.86a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 86a</a>), implying that no one after Ravina/Rav Ashi can argue on them (and therefore the Talmud, assuming that they are the final editors of the Talmud Bavli like Rashi there and Rav Sheraira Gaon). However, he doesn't explain why all of the sudden after the deaths of Ravina and Rav Ashi no one could argue on their predecessors. The only explanation I know of for this sudden break is brought down in the name of Rav Y. D. Soloveitchik in Nefesh Harav (by Rabbi Hershel Schachter) who explains that once the main body of the Oral Law was written down (in the Talmud), then the nature of psak changed and cannot be undone. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(These are a bit complex; I'll explain in greater detail if you want me to)</p>\n\n\n",

As some married women choose to, for instance, <strong>never</strong> uncover their hair as it is seen to be meritorious. The question was asked if it were allowed for unmarried women to have a similar, but of course situational different, high standard. </p>\n\n<p>Consulting my local Orthodox rabbi is a given. However, I like hearing different perspectives.

And that in Yemen, Jewish unmarried girls cover their hair just like the Muslims.</p>\n\n<p>If done as a deliberate divergence from the normative standards of tznius, that is, Daas Yehudis, then even if technically within the realm of <strong>tznius</strong> the practice is allowed, hashkafically, it might be quite problematic. There are groups of women, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_burqa_sect\" rel=\"nofollow\">Burqa Babes</a>, who have formed their own sect and reject rabbinic authority. (And attract attention to themselves with their extremes of tznius, which in fact runs counter to tznius.)

He writes in (Issurei Biah 21:17)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יז לֹא יְהַלְּכוּ בְּנוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל פְּרוּעֵי רֹאשׁ בַּשּׁוּק. אַחַת\n  פְּנוּיָה וְאַחַת אֵשֶׁת אִישׁ.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jewish women should not walk in the marketplace with uncovered hair.\n  [This applies to] both unmarried and married women.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam rules that even an unmarried woman is obligated to cover her hair. </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh follows the Rambam's rulings regarding both matters – that the law that a woman's hair is a sexual incitement belongs to the laws of modesty and that the law regarding head covering applies even to an unmarried woman (Even Ha-Ezer 21:1-2).</p>\n\n<p>The Beit Yosef (Orach Chayyim 75) writes that the basic law is in accordance with the Rambam</p>\n\n<p>However, The Beit Shemuel (Even Ha-Ezer 21, no. 5) and the Chelkhat Mekokek (there, no. 2) interpret the Rambam and Shulchan Aruch differently and distinguish between \"unmarried women\" and \"virgins.\" </p>\n\n<p>In other words, when the Shulchan Arukh says in Even ha-Ezer that even unmarried women are obligated to cover their hair, he is referring to unmarried women who had once been married – that is, divorcees and widows.<a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/shiur-18-head-covering\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> However, single women who have never been married are exempt from covering their hair.</p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham (Orach Chayyim 75, no. 3) resolves the contradiction differently: The law of head covering applies only to a married woman, whereas the prohibition to walk about with \"wild hair,\" which the Shulchan Arukh codifies in Even Ha-Ezer, relates to wild hair in its plain sense. In his view, the Sages decreed that a single woman must gather her hair together and not let it fall wild.</p>\n\n<p>The accepted practice follows the Beit Shmuel and not the Magen Avraham. Thus, a single woman is not obligated to cover her hair, but a widow and a divorcee are obligated to do so (<a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/shiur-18-head-covering\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source)</a></p>\n\n<p>For different reasons altogether, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.il/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=yitzchak%20berkowitz&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwi135L5y5TGAhWBEywKHXblD28&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FYitzchak_Berkovits&ei=WEmAVbXTBoGnsAH2yr_4Bg&usg=AFQjCNHAUXfdFiTP3Xeslis6-WfqirIwCw&sig2=Q0cxKTIjq1xqEzSj_h3j1A&bvm=bv.96041959,d.bGg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yitzchok Berkowitz</a> ruled for a single woman; who was a teacher in a seminary teaching female students, that she is obligated to cover her hair. </p>\n\n<p>His reasoning was that she is in a position of respect, and the underlying principle of hair covering and tznius in general (he did not provide a definitive source), is dignity and self respect, therefore she should cover her hair. </p>\n\n\n",

He blames them for all of the problems in Israel.

My mother tells me that he cries at night, wondering what he did wrong as a parent, to make me turn out so bad.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is, last Saturday at bet keneset I heard about the isur of nekama.</p>\n\n<p>Do I have to stop keeping halacha now?  The only reason I did it was for nekama.  Every time that I keep shabat or wear tefilin, I am also doing the isur of nekama!</p>\n\n<p>What is the halacha of balancing keeping halacha against nekama?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After my father crushed my dreams, and refused to pay for my university in England, I wanted to take revenge on him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Serious problem right here. Basically at eighteen, you're on your own. It's normally a nice thing for parents to help out beyond that, but they are not obligated to do so. (See Maharik responsum #166.) If you were expecting a favor and didn't receive it, it's natural to feel disappointed, but \"I demand revenge because you hurt me\" is inaccurate.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the prohibition of revenge per se -- it applies if someone harmed you (or refused you a favor), and now you harm them (or refuse a favor) back. (See Yoma 23a.)  But if  I decide to succeed in life, and one motivation in the back of my mind is \"my dad said I'd never amount to anything, I'll show him\" -- well that's not healthy, but that's not revenge per se.</p>\n\n<p>So you should continue to keep kashrus, wear tefilin, and the like. <em>HOWEVER</em>, something is wrong here -- your father feels that religiously-observant people can exhibit parasitic behavior, and you respond by saying -- \"well I'm religiously observant and I demand you pay for my college, or else I want revenge!\" Can you see how that's reinforcing your father's belief?</p>\n\n<p>Religious growth is a process, and I hope you have a competent rabbi to help you with it. If you continue to keep shabbos, kashrus, and the like, but make it clear to everyone that you are a pleasant, <em>hardworking</em> person who strives for financial self-sufficiency (a value strongly stressed by the Talmud, e.g. Kiddushin 30b), then you've done your best. You can make it clear to your father that you understand his dismay, and yes sadly, some people use religion as an excuse for selfish means, but you are doing your best to keep the 613 while maintaining respect for him and keeping the lines of communication open.</p>\n\n<p>As for doing things with the wrong motivation -- on the one hand, we're told \"it's okay to do mitzvahs for ulterior motives, it will eventually bring to you to loftier motives.\" On the other hand, we're told that if someone studies Torah for ulterior motives, e.g. he wants recognition as a big-name rabbi, that's okay. But if it's done just to spite someone, then that's toxic. (See the first Tosfos on Taanis 7a.) I can't tell you to stop wearing tefilin, but at some point you should be thinking \"I am wearing these because God commanded me to do so to remember the Exodus\", not \"I am wearing these to get back at my dad.\" If you're doing your mitzvos in a spiteful manner, that's going to burn bridges with your father. If you do them sincerely, then at least you stand a chance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Your question shows that you care about the biblical commandment not to take revenge. Evidently, you are not simply putting on a show of religiosity to provoke your father, which would have only required displaying some of the more visible trappings of religion. </p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your original intent, you seem to have developed a positive motivation for <em>mitzva</em> observance. By conducting yourself as an exemplar of Torah observance both in areas between man and G-d as well as between man and his fellow, you will sanctify G-d's Name and hopefully exercise a positive influence on your father, too.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In order to properly answer this question, first we have to clarify what is Nekama. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37519&st=&pgnum=118&hilite=\">Minchas Chinuch 241:1</a> says one only transgresses Nekama with money not with causing Tzaar to another. Based on this you are not taking Nekama by keeping Mitzvos.</p>\n\n\n",

But what if the parent wants the child to not accept a <em>chumra</em> that the child feels very strongly about or that is widely accepted in the child's community?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is a difference between a child keeping his own chumros, and trying to force his parents to follow that chumro.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/110113/jewish/Some-Basic-Laws-Of-Kibbud-Av-Va-Em.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/110113/jewish/Some-Basic-Laws-Of-Kibbud-Av-Va-Em.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>This summary of hilchos kibud av v'em would seem to indicate that a child is forbidden from telling his parents directly that they're doing something wrong, halachically.  </p>\n\n<p>However, the question here cites the fact that kibud av v'em doesn't prevent any level of Torah observance for a child.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, (will try to find citation later) repeating a chumro on purpose on three different occasions, has the force of a neder.  As breaking a neder is a serious Torah offense, certainly a child cannot break a neder for the purpose of kibud av v'em.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the child should do everything possible to minimize inconvenience for the parents.</p>\n\n<p>In Shalom's scenario, the child could meet the father at a non-cholov yisroel restaurant, and order something pareve.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a daughter may choose to purchase longer skirts, or shirts that better cover the neckline etc - but the daughter can't force her parents to spend more than they would normally spend on her clothing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Willig has a piece in Beis Yitzchak highlighting the distinction between what's done in the parent's presence (over which the parent has a lot more say) and what's not.</p>\n\n<p>The Pischei Teshuva on shulchan aruch talks about if the parent says \"don't say kaddish for my recently-departed spouse, it spooks me!\" \"Don't wear black clothes as a sign of mourning for my recently-departed spouse, it spooks me!\" \"I know there's some nice custom to fast Behab, but don't do it, it worries me about your health.\" (On one foot -- ignore them, listen, listen.) This seems to be discussing saying kaddish <em>when the living parent is in the room</em>; if the child happens to be saying kaddish halfway around the world, why would the living parent know?</p>\n\n<p>Some of this will depend who you consult, but if the child is grown and on their own (paying for themselves, in their own space), then whether s/he drinks chalav yisrael (for instance) when he's home alone is his own business. (Now if his dad wants to meet him for lunch at a non-chalav yisrael place, that's trickier.) For the well-meaning teenager or college-age fellow who's still relying on his/her parents for support, putting aside all matters of the laws of kibbud av v'em, if your parents are asking you to keep baseline halacha, that's probably the healthiest thing.</p>\n\n\n",

If one is wearing tefillin and fell with them on, must one fast or give charity? Maybe, if the person fell and not the tefillin, they would not be required to.</p>\n\n<p>Would the halacha change if the tefillin itself touched the ground when the person fell?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Beis Halevi quoted in the Piskei Teshuva (Chelek 2 : Siman 157) discusses the question of when there are two people heading for the same entrance. We have a Halacha that applies to seforim and respectable people and holy objects in that that we allow them to enter first (kind of like ladies first. See Brachos 47a). The Beis Halevi's asks, what would the halacha be if one person was holding a pair of teffilin and one person was wearing the teffilin, who goes first? Basing himself on the Mishna in Negaim (chap. 13) which states that a person who entered a Beis Hamenugah - a house inflicted with tzaraas while holding objects, the objects become tamei. However, if a person was wearing those objects only he is tamei but the objects remain tahor. The Beis Halevi rules that the one holding the teffilin goes first instead of the one wearing the teffilin. He explains that wearing something is not considered as if you are holding it. Thus, based off this Beis Halevi, it follows that when falling, your not \"dropping\" the teffilin rather YOU are falling. And even if the teffilin touched the floor, for the teffilin are considered tafel - secondary and subsumed to your body</p>\n<p>Quoted Beis Halevi:</p>\n<h2>פסקי תשובה סימן קנ\"ז</h2>\n<h2>הגאון מהור\"ד ז\"ל מבריסק, נזדמן לפניו שני אנשים בדרך כניסתם לביהמ\"ד שאחד מהם היה לבוש טלית ותפילין. והשני נשא את הטו\"ת, ויהיה מבוכה בין הלומדים למי מהם יש דין קדימה לכבדו לכנוס ראשון והשיב הגז\"ל כי יש להוכיח זה ממשנה דנגעים (פי\"ג מ\"ט) דמבואר משם דהבגדים בדרך לבישתן אינם נקראין שבאו אל הבית, ואם נושאן ביד, קרינן גם עליהן, והבא אל הבית ולכן הנושא טו\"ת קודם לכנוס</h2>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>As far as I know (and it's not too far), if someone is sick, G-d forbid, he is allowed to put tefilin sitting or layed down. Maybe falling would fit in this category, of a quick sickness in wich it is allowed to wear tefilin during that short period of time. But ask your rabbi for a truly reliable answer. </p>\n\n\n",

Does it matter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I went looking for instances of \"hamentash\" (המן־טאַש) in Sholom Aleichem stories because I wanted to see it used in a sentence as singular and plural. In the story \"Two Shalachmones or A Purim Scandal\" the word is used 12 times, but every single usage is singular.  It is consistently spelled המן־טאַש or \"hamentash\".  You can find the first instance on <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/stream/nybc202588#page/n62/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow\">page 58 (page 62 of the file)</a> in the paragraph at the bottom of the page.

It looks like  the evidence so far confirms Wikipedia's assertation that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A hamantash (or hamentasch, see: Other names; Yiddish המן־טאַש, pl. hamantashen or hamentaschen) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wikipedia does not give a spelling for the Yiddish plural, but Google searches reveal two common spellings \"המן טאשן\" and \"המן-טאשן\" (with a space or with a hyphen).</p>\n\n<p>One story that I know has the plural hamantashen is \"Two Dead Men\" about Chlavne the drunk and his wife Gittel, but I cannot seem to find that in the original Yiddish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>For most words in Yiddish, the \"ן\" or \"en\" at the end of a noun makes it plural. So \"המן-טאשן\" means many hamentashen, and \"המן-טאש\" is the singular. (EX: I ate a hamentash. We ate 3 hamentashen each.)</p>\n\n\n",

The quote begins:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Hanina b. Papa — some say R. Simlai — expounded [the foregoing verse] thus: <strong>In times to come</strong>,10  the Holy One, blessed be He, will take a scroll of the Law in His embrace and proclaim: 'Let him who has occupied himself herewith, come and take his reward.' Thereupon all the nations will crowd together in confusion, as it is said: All the nations are gathered together, etc.11  The Holy One, blessed be He, will then say to them: 'Come not before Me in confusion, but let each nation come in with its scribes;' as it is said, and let the peoples be gathered together,'1  and the word le'om [used here] means a kingdom, as it is written, and one kingdom [u-leom] shall be stronger than the other kingdom.2  (But can there be confusion in the presence of the Holy One, blessed be He? — [No;] it is only that they be not confused, and so hear what He says to them.) Thereupon the Kingdom of Edom3  will enter first before Him...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, this is an event which is yet to happen, not a record of a claim in the past.</p>\n\n<p>This is a midrash, rather than a history. Soncino describes it (follow same link, see footnote 10) as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A typical example of consolatory Aggadah wherewith the Rabbis sought to sooth the people's present afflictions by depicting the glories which the future had in store for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And there may be some theological point to this, rather than a dry recounting of future history.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from all this, the other answer may well be true, that the kingdom of Edom refers to some representative, some angel appointed over their nation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This excerpt refers to a metaphysical event that occurs in heaven.

They will therefore ask G-d to reward them for the unanticipated effects of their actions. G-d derides them as \"world-class fools\", responding that they acted only for their own benefit and therefore do not deserve reward.</p>\n\n<p>So why don't they deserve reward? \"G-d does not withhold reward from any creation!\" Because they acted to harm, and only G-d's intervention created good from it. As you said, the Romans hated the Jews and did their utmost to prevent them from studying Torah, going so far as to make Torah study a capital crime. </p>\n\n<p>This can be compared to the case (brought in <em>What If</em>) of Reuvein who is angry at Shimon. He therefore tricks Shimon into visiting Sarah's house, saying that he set them up on a date. His intention is merely to embarrass Shimon by sending him to a random house. Shimon knocks on the door and they realize a trick was played on him. However, Sarah's father takes a liking to Shimon. They go out and get engaged. Then Reuvein impudently declares - I deserve the Shadchan's payment for setting you up! R' Zilberstein ruled that since Reuvein intended to harm, not help, he deserves no payment for the unintentional positive result he brought about.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus man can serve God with the very evil inclination itself. Even when he is exposed to the burning of the evil inclination, he can still strengthen himself even then and try to draw some of its passion into the service of God. If man had no evil inclination his service would be worth nothing. This is why God gives the evil inclination such power against men, especially those who genuinely seek to draw closer to Him. The onslaught of the evil inclination brings men to all manner of sin and devastation. But even so, in God's eyes all this is acceptable because of the preciousness of the gestures which people make when confronted by the full force of the evil inclination -- those gestures of fighting and escaping. In God's eyes this is more precious than if a person served him for a thousand years without the evil inclination. All the worlds were created only for the sake of man. The whole preciousness and greatness of man lies in the fact that he is confronted by this strong evil inclination. The more it arrays itself to attack, the more precious in God's eyes is every single gesture one makes to strengthen oneself against it. God Himself will send help, as it i s written: `The Lord will not abandon him into his hand' (Psalm 37:33) (Ibid.)\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.azamra.org/Advice/encouragement.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.azamra.org/Advice/encouragement.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud's example here is if I know I stole <em>this beam</em> from Mr. Smith, but I've now built a mansion centered on this beam. The strict principle of expungement would demand I tear down the mansion to get to this beam, but rabbinic policy wanted to give people a reasonable chance at repentance -- hence, just pay Mr. Smith the value of the beam.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Feinstein addresses questions of stealing from a known fund or organization, if decades later it has a different name, purpose, board, or the like; however, if there's no way to identify the recipient, then instead the money should be put into something of the public good. It has to be the <em>public</em>, not just the poor. (Assuming you didn't just steal from the poor.) The Talmud's example is to build public wells, and that way it's likely that your victims will at some point avail themselves of them. Rabbi Feinstein's recommendation (in 1950s America) was actually mikvah funds, a nifty twist on the Talmud's \"water systems.\" As I really doubt your local water utility would accept a donation, I would wonder if something like a volunteer fire department or a library might work too.</p>\n\n\n",

According to the father of history, Herodotus (485-420 BCE), the Arabs would shave the peyot of their heads as an example of their pagan beliefs: \"they say that the cutting of their hair is done after the same fashion as that of Dionysos himself; and they cut their hair in a circle round, shaving away the hair of the temples.\" (<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2707/pg2707.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Histories Book III:8</a>). Herodotus is referring to the confederation of Arabian tribes on the southern border of Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n<p>From Tanach an image arises of a Jewish settlement in the southeast of Eretz Yisrael and in Ever Hayarden, a settlement that had close ties with the Arabian tribes. Yericho, Tzo'ar, Eilat and in their surrounding areas were the northern side of this settlement, and from there to the south there was a line of Jewish settlements. From the testimony of Herodotus we may understand the reason for the prohibition of Bnei Yisrael to shave the peyot of their head.</p>\n<p>From Yirmiyahu it seems that this minhag of shaving the peyot wasn't just typical to the Arabs who lived on the southern border of Eretz Yisrael, but also the Arabian tribes who lived even further south, meaning, in the northern Arabian Peninsula...\"of Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all the desert dwellers who have the hair of their temples clipped.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.9.25?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 9:25</a>), \"Dedan, Tema, and Buz, and all those who have their hair clipped; all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed peoples who live in the desert\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.25.23-24?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 25:23-24</a>), \"...And I will scatter to every quarter Those who have their hair clipped...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.49.32?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 49:32</a>).\n...therefore \"those who have their hairs clipped\" settled southwest of the Kingdom of Edom, re: in the northern Arabian Peninsula...from the words of Herodotus and Yirmiyahu we see an image forming according to which the clipping of the peyot was popular among the Arabs from the southern border of Eretz Yisrael all the way to Khijaz. In this area lived Arab tribes and most of them were nomadic or partially nomadic. Qifakh wrote that already on the eve the destruction of the First Temple were exiled Jews with long peyot to the northern Arabian Peninsula, and that is the same area that Yirmiyahu mentioned...if we accept the traditions of the scholars of Teiman as reliable, we conclude that in 8th and 7th centuries BCE there were in the northern Arabian Peninsula two groups with opposite traditions: Jews who grew out their peyot, and Arabs who clipped them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, about the Jews of Arabia specifically: Mazuz brings two non-Jewish sources that even back in the time of Muhammad, Jews, at least those in Arabia, grew out their peyot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a. According to Islamic traditions, the Jews of Almedina lived by two Arab tribes, Awas and Khazraj. Zayid ben Thabit was originally an Arab, of the sons of Alnajar, one of the houses of Khazraj. According to Muslim sources he was a Jew with peyot who was educated by Jews, and since he was an Arab by birth, it is likely that he converted. However, some time after the rise of Islam, he converted to Islam...in the Hadith it is said that Abad Allah ben Mas'ud was asked if he reads the Quran like Zayid ben Thabit does, and replied: \"What is it to me and Zayid and the way he reads? I heard from the messenger of Allah seventy surahs even when Zayid ben Thabit was a Jew with two peyot.\"</p>\n<p>b. The Khanbalian jurist Ahmad ben Abad AlKhalim Taki Ibn Taymiah (1263-1328) wrote...in the book Ibn Taymiah attacked Jews, Christians, the Zoroastrians...according to a tradition brought in the book of Ibn Taymiah a short time after the death of Muhammad, his assitant Anas ben Malikh saw Alkhajaj ben Alkhassan, who was then a young man, who had on his head two peyot (qutzatan) and commanded him to shave them immediately for that is a tradition of the Jews. Per the tradition about Zayid ben Thabit and the one about Alkhajaj ben Alkhassan, we can assume that when Zayid...converted, he grew out his peyot, an  tradition that differentiated between the Jewish settlers and their Arab neighbors in Almedina, and after he became a Muslim, he shaved off his peyot, to differ from the Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If Aharon would complain about this it would show that he is arrogant and cares about his honour, and so he would not be not fitting.

Would it be wrong to wear a Star of David necklace, or would that offend people?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 28)\n\n<p>Thank you for your sensitivity in asking this question.</p>\n\n<p>As pointed out in comments, you are actually Jewish (whether you follow Judaism or not).  But as you say in your question, you've been raised with Christianity and it doesn't appear that you've rejected that.  You see Judaism as part of your cultural background, if I'm reading you correctly, the way Christians see some events in the Hebrew Bible as historically important but not personally, religiously relevant.  (That is, things like the lives of the patriarchs, the slavery in and exodus from Egypt, the 40 years in the wilderness, and most especially the laws given by God are not generally seen as part of one's core and personally binding; they are part of the background of Judaism from which Christianity formed.)</p>\n\n<p>You should therefore consider the context in which you wear the necklace.  In your day-to-day life, are you mainly in secular settings and religion doesn't tend to come up?  Sure, I doubt anybody's going to object to that.  Be prepared for the occasional person to ask you if you're Jewish.  Inoffensive answers there would include \"my family is\" or \"it's part of my background\" or \"not really, but I like the necklace\".  While saying \"yes\" is <em>halachically</em> correct (you are, because your mother is), I would advise against saying that in a setting where people would interpret that as a statement of belief.  If you don't follow the Jewish religion, you may confuse people.</p>\n\n<p>I would advise against wearing it in an overly-religious setting, such as when attending church.  That's bound to confuse some people, and since some Christian denominations are supersessionist, claiming that their religion replaces God's covenant at Sinai, you could be inadvertantly making a theo-political statement.  If you don't mean to it's confusing; if you do mean to, to Jews who know about it, it's somewhat offensive.  See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/13266/472\">this related question</a> about a necklace containing both a star of David and a cross; some of those issues could apply when wearing a (plain) star of David in a Christian setting.</p>\n\n<p>That must sound like a complicated and long-winded answer to what you may have thought was a simple question.  Sorry about that.  My bottom-line advice is: consider the message your wearing it might send <em>in the place where you're wearing it</em>, and then decide whether to wear it at that time.  I don't want to discourage you from being proud of your Jewish heritage, and I hope that you'll decide to learn more about it over time.</p>\n\n<p>(I don't have any sources.  This advice is based on many interactions, and some longer-term relationships, with both interfaith families and converts in training.  Figuring out the \"identity\" part of Judaism, and symbols that convey this identity, can be pretty confusing sometimes.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The only thing that would be offensive is if you posed as accepting the Jewish faith and then went around telling everyone that they have to believe in Jesus.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Do I have sufficient reason to investigate converting to Judaism?",
    "content": "# Do I have sufficient reason to investigate converting to Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>About 18 months ago, I began contemplating earnestly investigating converting to Judaism, which three years of casual thinking and reading about god had engendered. </p>\n\n<p>I regard this interest in converting as a consequence of reason and intuition. That said, in writing, I can express my rationale more effectively than I can convey my sentiments. For that reason, I've rendered that rationale below. In points one through five, I emboldened the important elements; please feel free to skip the rest. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A god, as commonly conceived, exists</strong>: Three years ago I read an argument for the existence of an omnipotent entity that created the universe. The arguments convinced me. </li>\n<li><strong>This god has preferences</strong>: Later, I reasoned that omnipotence depends on having preferences: Not all things are possible. For instance, without equivocating, I cannot exist and not exist. So an omnipotent thing can do anything, but not everything. Without preferences, a (pseudo) omnipotent thing might effect one set of mutually possible things. However, that entity does not have preferences, so it could never have preferred to do other than what it did, and so would only ever effect everything it effected, which necessarily excludes it from doing somethings. However, an omnipotent entity must have the capability to do all things. Accordingly, we cannot call an omnipotent entity that has no preferences <em>omnipotent</em>; at most we we might call it <em>maximally efficacious</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>This god intended to create us</strong>: Considering the entity's omnipotency and that we exist, he must have preferred to create us. So he created us, neither by accident, nor from necessity; rather, he must have chosen to create us.</li>\n<li><strong>It seems probable that this god prefers that we know about him</strong>: Considering that, and that we knew about this entity before we had arguments for his existence; that much of the world independently came to believe in a god similar to the one who I've described above. <em>(Note that I acknowledge that there are inconsistencies among the various conceptions of god, and that most people who believe in the god I described above have that belief because the Jews had that belief before them.)</em></li>\n<li><strong>It seems probable that Judaism has the most accurate conception of this god</strong>: As I wrote above, the various conceptions are inconsistent. So it seems implausible that one could derive an accurate conception of the concept of god from syncreticism. Maybe some minor religion has the most accurate conception of god, but for a number of considerations, that also seems implausible. So only the major religions remain. I spent an appreciable amount of time studying each of them. Buddhism does not believe in an omnipotent god; Hinduism believes in manifold gods. But the argument I referenced in my first point precludes the existence of multiple gods. That leaves the Abrahamic religions: Islam depends on rewritten scripture; accordingly, I doubt its fidelity. Much the Christian New Testament contradicts the Old Testament. However, the New Testament depends on the Old Testament; accordingly, either both, the Old Testament and the New Testament, are inaccurate, or only the Old Testament is accurate.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have read what a gentile must do to be regarded as righteous; needless to say, it's pages less than what a Jew must do to be regarded as righteous. While the former seems easier, it also strikes me as less fulfilling. </p>\n\n<p>Saying all that to say, I have thought about this. I'd really like to take the next step. What should I do?</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishnah Berurah mentions that one should not pause excessively by taking a breath in the middle of a verse, so as to read like an <em>iggeres</em>. I've seen <em>iggeres</em> translated as \"letter\", but these attributes don't seem to apply to a letter as I understand it. Perhaps letters were written completely differently back then, but in that case the translation \"letter\" is inaccurate. So what is an <em>iggeres</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>My understanding (which I'm half certain I saw in a sefer many moons ago) is that just as when one receives an important letter, one reads it avidly all the way through without pausing, so too should the Megillah be read. Therefore, it should be read without pausing unnecessarily.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for unfolding it before the reading is because the Megillah has to be in the form of a sefer, which in the language of the Torah means a scroll, and so all the pages are joined together to make a sefer. But the reading should be done like reading a multi-page letter (for the reason mentioned above), and since we can't separate the individual pages, we unfurl it and fold it page over page so that it becomes like a multi-page letter and not a sefer.</p>\n\n<p>An alternative explanation as to why we fold it is because the main thing is to unfurl the scroll completely so that appears to be a letter and not a sefer. But since the Megillah is very long this will usually result in it either touching the floor or at the very least hanging off the edge of the table, either of which is a disgrace to the sefer, as the MB writes in Se'if Katan 56, and therefore we fold it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It appears the Megillah is referred to as both a \"sefer\" and an \"iggeret\".

This would help to explain the Shulhhan Arukh referenced in the question.</p>\n\n\n",

I am also aware that non-Jews can receive a share of the world to come, and that they can have a perfectly fine (albeit, less developed) relationship with G-d by following the Noachide laws and being a good, moral human being. This is a general or hypothetical question, but I look forward to your answers!</p>\n\n<p>I have long been fascinated by Judaism, and I even like to think that I know more about Judaism than some Jews. I have always felt a strong connection to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and I believe I have felt his presence in my life as a non-Jew. However, I have long wanted to convert because I believe it would make my relationship with G-d closer, I love Jewish culture, and because I want to be a part of the Jewish community. </p>\n\n<p>However, I am having trouble with some of the fundamental aspects of whether or not conversion makes sense in a religion where followers are, by and large (with exceptions for Abraham and so on), \"Chosen\" by G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, my dilemma is essentially this:</p>\n\n<p>Though I feel deeply like I have a Jewish soul, and I love G-d, and I wish to be a full member of the Jewish tradition...I am stuck thinking that I should not convert because, if G-d had wanted me to have a Jewish soul, wouldn't He have had me born into a Jewish family? </p>\n\n<p>On some level, I have to ask myself if converting to Judaism would not almost be a rejection of G-d's plan for my life. Would I not be second guessing Him, if I was born into a non-Jewish family? Does not G-d direct who were are born into, and does He instead wish me to live as a righteous Gentile? Who is the pot to question the potter?</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate any insights you can share on this, and any real-life examples or sources to help me understand if conversion is the right thing to do.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 31)\n\n<p>Tosefos addresses a similar line of thought in Bava Kamma 85a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שנתנה רשות לרפאות - א\"ת והא מרפא לחודיה שמעינן ליה וי\"ל דה\"א ה\"מ מכה בידי אדם אבל חולי הבא בידי שמים כשמרפא נראה כסותר גזירת המלך קמ\"ל דשרי</p>\n<p>(Rough translation) - One may have thought that there is no right to seek healing from a sickness that comes from Heaven, as it seems like contravening the decree of the King [that this person should be sick].

This mold is derived from the configuration of the sefirot, which structure the worlds through which the soul descends on its journey down into the body.</p>\n\n<p>From the scientific point of view, the problem is: How do you measure or observe non-physical (spiritual) soul with physical scientific instruments? It's impossible!</p>\n\n<p>There is no official scientific proof yet, as there need to be enough evidence to support the claim (proof measures the level of evidence) and not everybody is keen to share that kind of evidences, as the topic is too powerful (e.g. soul can travel anywhere and access all the secrets of the world).</p>\n\n<p>If you looking for scientific proof, here are study areas in scientific community (majority call it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pseudoscience</a>) and these are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephirot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Remote Viewing</a>,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Wikipedia, remote viewing (RV) is the practice of\n  seeking impressions about a distant or unseen target using subjective\n  means, in particular, extrasensory perception (ESP) or \"sensing with\n  mind\".</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_self\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Consciousness</a>,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Consciousness is the quality or state of awareness.

Their idea stems from the notion of the brain as a biological computer, \"with 100 billion neurons and their axonal firings and synaptic connections acting as information networks\". Dr Hameroff, Professor Emeritus at the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychology and Director of the Centre of Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona, and Sir Roger have been working on the theory since 1996.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Vogel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Marcel Joseph Vogel</a> (research scientist working at the IBM) claimed to be able to duplicate the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleve_Backster#Primary_perception\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Backster effect</a>\" using plants as transducers for bio-energetic fields from the human mind, showing that they respond to human thought.

There are techniques to do it, and it can be done with practice, and with practice you'll be able to see for yourself if there's any validity to such experiences. Even the most skeptical person can have an out of body experience, if they practice sufficiently to succeed. This happened in the case of the neurologist who recently wrote a book about heaven being real, but it can happen for anyone. </p>\n\n<p>Ability to astral travel is enough evidence of separation of our brain and mind. I don't think there will be ever any scientific proof of the astral travel, generally speaking science can't proof much, that's why we still call them theories e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Big Bang theory</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_theory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Quantum theory</a>, etc. So I think the people experiences are the most convincing facts.</p>\n\n<p>There is also famous documentary called <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340425/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DMT: The Spirit Molecule</a> which is an investigation into the long-obscured mystery of dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a molecule found in nearly every living organism and considered the most potent psychedelic on Earth.

But it wasn't until the 1970's, when the U.S. discovered that Soviet Union was spending 60 million rubles annually on \"psychotronic\" research. Afraid of being left behind in a \"psychic arms race,\" the CIA funded a research proposal from two laser physicists at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). It was these two scientists—Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff—who developed the first protocols and coined the term \"remote viewing\" (RV). Proponents of the research said that a minimum accuracy rate of 65% required by the clients was consistently exceeded in the later experiments. In 1990 the program moved to Science Applications International Corporation (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Applications_International_Corporation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SAIC</a>), a major defense contractor and a Fortune 500 company with some 38,000 employees worldwide. In 1995, the project was transferred to the CIA and a retrospective evaluation of the results was done. A report by Utts claimed the results were evidence of psychic functioning. The CIA terminated the 20 million dollar project, because the government determined that even if there is some truth to the remote viewing claims, it is too unreliable to be of any military value and no practical value to the intelligence community. When the CIA hired the American Institute for Research—an intel-industry contractor—to conduct an evaluation of RV programs in 1995, the evaluators were only shown the results from the last few years of work at Fort Meade, much of which was frankly garbage; earlier work by viewers like Price and McMoneagle remained classified.</p>\n\n<p>Utts and Dr. Ray Hyman, a psychologist at the University of Oregon and a skeptic, issued separate reports on the Star Gate studies. Utts concluded that \"psychic functioning has been well established.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project#Major_General_Albert_Stubblebine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, a key sponsor of the research internally at Fort Meade, MD, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Stubblebine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MG Stubblebine</a> was convinced of the reality of a wide variety of psychic phenomena. He required that all of his Battalion Commanders learn how to bend spoons a la Uri Geller, and he himself attempted several psychic feats, even attempting to walk through walls. In the early 1980s he was responsible for the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), during which time the remote viewing project in the US Army began. He also confirms the stunning success of US Army remote viewing Project Stargate.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, The United States Government's involvement in remote viewing is real. At one time or another, the Army, the Navy, the CIA have all funded remote viewing projects. Many other branches of the military and the government—the Navy and Air Force, as well as NSA and NASA, invested in remote viewing. Their programs are less well known and classified. </p>\n\n<p>As Major General Ed Thompson, Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence from 1977 to 1981, once said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I never liked to get into debates with skeptics, because if you\n  didn't believe that remote viewing was real, you hadn't done your\n  homework.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Please check more scientific research papers: <a href=\"http://www.lfr.org/lfr/csl/media/publications.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">academic publications</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lfr.org/lfr/csl/academic/library.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">research library</a> at <a href=\"http://www.lfr.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cognitive Sciences Laboratory (CSL)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.csgrahambooks.com/remote.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Remote Viewing FAQ by former Army intelligence officer Steven Harris</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://skepdic.com/remotevw.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">'remote viewing' at the Sceptic's Dictionary</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>On April 17, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order Nr. 1995-4-17, entitled Classified National Security Information. In July 1995 the CIA declassified, and approved for release, documents revealing its sponsorship in the 1970s of a program at Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, CA, to determine whether such phenomena as remote viewing \"might have any utility for intelligence collection\".</p>\n\n<p>Official CIA Statements/Perspectives</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With regard to admission by the government of its use of remote\n  viewers under operational conditions, officials have on occasion been\n  relatively forthcoming. President Carter, in a speech to college\n  students in Atlanta in September 1995, is quoted by Reuters as saying\n  that during his administration a plane went down in Zaire, and a\n  meticulous sweep of the African terrain by American spy satellites\n  failed to locate any sign of the wreckage. It was then \"without my\n  knowledge\" that the head of the CIA (Adm. Stansfield Turner) turned to\n  a woman reputed to have psychic powers. As told by Carter, <strong>\"she gave\n  some latitude and longitude figures. We focused our satellite cameras\n  on that point and the plane was there.\"</strong> Independently, Turner himself\n  also has admitted the Agency's use of a remote viewer (in this case,\n  Pat Price). And recently, in a segment taped for the British\n  television series Equinox, Maj. Gen. Ed Thompson, Assistant Chief\n  of Staff for Intelligence, U.S. Army (1977-1981), volunteered \"I had\n  one or more briefings by SRI and was impressed....

If the remote viewer gets messages of a site by \"perceiving\" the site psychically, then it would be clairvoyance.</p>\n\n<p>Experiments combining clairvoyance and hypnosis go back for centuries. In 1849 the famous mathematician, Augustus de Morgan (1806–1871), wrote of his first experience with what came to be known as \"traveling clairvoyance.\" The early mesmerists (hypnotists) carried out many experiments during which the subjects would be asked to \"go somewhere\" mentally and to describe what they saw.</p>\n\n<p>It's common knowledge that gifted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairvoyance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">clairvoyants</a> (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RV</a>) who're cooperating with police, FBI, CIA, etc. and they're known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_detective\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">psychic detectives</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“To the present day, no one has come up with a persuasive experimental\n  design that can unambiguously distinguish between telepathy and\n  clairvoyance....Based on the experimental evidence, it is by no means\n  clear that pure telepathy exists per se, nor is it certain that\n  real-time clairvoyance exists.\" The evidence \"can all be accommodated\n  by various forms of precognition.\", Dean Radin</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ESP Researchers</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Tests of remote viewing often  involve having one person go to a remote site, while another tries to get impressions of the site. There is no way to distinguish telepathy from clairvoyance in such tests. Some tests have the one being tested try to get impressions from giving him coordinates on a map, for example. But even in those tests if someone is at those coordinates there is no way to know whether any impressions were coming from that person or from the site itself or from other unknown sources, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akashic record</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ingo Swann and Harold Sherman claim to have done remote viewing of Mercury and Jupiter. Targ and Puthoff reported that their remote viewing compared favorably to the findings of the Mariner 10 and Pioneer 10 research spacecraft. Isaac Asimov did a similar comparison and found that 46% of the observation claims of the astral travelers were wrong. Also, only one out of 65 claims made by the remote viewers was a fact that either was not obvious or not obtainable from reference books.</p>\n\n<p>McMoneagle was in the army for 16 years, apparently serving some or most of that time as a psychic spy. He claims he helped locate the U.S. hostages taken by Iran during Jimmy Carter's presidency.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>According to Courtney Brown (social scientist at Emory University), the remote viewing is the ability to accurately perceive information at great distances across space and time - longer needs depends upon a few gifted individuals because we know that SRV (<a href=\"http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/scientific_remote_viewing/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Scientific Remote Viewing</a>) can be taught and learned, and the reliability of trained individuals is \"generally much greater than that of the best natural psychics.</p>\n\n<p>Brown next informs us that he discovered SRV after making contact with several of the Pentagon's ex-psychic warriors who successfully spied on the Kremlin during the Cold War.</p>\n\n<p>Following a brief history of the U.S. Military Psychic Warfare Program, we are informed about the work of Robert Jahn and Harold Puthoff and Robert Monroe and Ingo Swann and how important meditation and the work of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is in teaching one to use SRV. After learning how one uses the mind and imagination to sail off into the wild blue yonder and how to master the seven stages of SRV protocols and the six different types of remote-viewing data.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Scientific historians of the next century will no doubt regard January\n  1996 as the period of the greatest scientific breakthrough in all of\n  human history. It was in this month that two of mankind's greatest\n  scientific accomplishments of all time were announced: the conquest of\n  space and the conquest of time! What is even more remarkable is that\n  these mind-boggling discoveries were made by two relatively unknown\n  individuals with doctorate degrees, but who chanced upon perhaps the\n  greatest scientific discovery of all time -- scientific remote\n  viewing! Using scientific remote viewing (SRV) to conquer space was\n  the discovery of one Courtney Brown, Ph.D., a political science\n  professor at Emory University. </p>\n  \n  <p>We must not nitpick, however. Dr. Brown informs us that the farthest\n  reaches of the universe are now open to us and can be reached in short\n  order using his rigorous and exacting remote-viewing protocols\n  developed by the US military for espionage purposes.

Collectively, they are referred to as psi, the\n  twenty-third letter of the Greek alphabet and the first letter in the\n  Greek word for “psyche”, meaning “mind” or “soul.” - Mitchell</p>\n  \n  <p>“Telepathy, for example, had been extensively studied and documented\n  for a century. The work of J.B. Rhine, Rene Warcollier, S.G.

At times, after a book, CD, or DVD hits the market, there is a proclamation banning it. Perhaps, instead, a book, CD, or DVD could have a Hashgacha certifying that it is Kosher for the soul. Similar to the case of food, there can be different Hashgachas with different standards, and everyone can follow the standard they deem proper. Why has this not been done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In order to give a Hashgacha for an item, you need to be able to determine if it is indeed Kosher or not Kosher.  There must be clearly defined rules.  For food, these clear rules exist in Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>However, for media and literature, there are no such rules - it's all a matter of opinion.  In other words, it's not Halacha, it's Hashkafa. Some would say that a book is Assur, others would say that it's not Assur, but not a good idea to read, and yet others, Muttar entirely, and in fact, valuable lessons can be learned from it.  (I refer you to the controversy concerning the Harry Potter books.)</p>\n\n<p>You mentioned that there should be different standards.  In practice, this would just lead to mass confusion, and probably fights whether people are \"frum\" enough.  Since it is so subjective anyways, why don't we just let people make their own decisions, based on the Hashkafa they've learned from their rabbis and community?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are <em>many</em> more books than there are foods, not to mention music and films.  It is simply not practical to review and certify every item.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It is possible that certain tight\\isolated communities could start certifying certain books as kosher <em>for their community,</em> but these communities tend to prohibit all outside literature to begin with...</p>\n\n\n",

It is about building a relationship with the Creator of the World. The reason for doing the <em>mitzvos</em> is that they are an expression of His Will, and we love Him very much, like one loves his father, and obey his will not because of the reward but because we want to do something nice for Him.</p>\n\n<p>Let me elaborate on this. One idea is that there is a tremendous element of <em>hakaras hatov</em> which is the basis for everything else. One cannot notice the kindnesses of the Creator towards himself, and it is natural to try to want to give something back, even a slight little bit. Like with your parents, you can never pay back fully what they gave you, but giving back what can be possible is the least a human being can do.</p>\n\n<p>The Creator does not need us to do anything for Him, but in His mercy, He created these <em>mitzvos</em> to give us an opportunity to give him something back.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea, is that the reward is not what it's really about at all. The argument is put forth by R' Moshe Chaim Luzzato in <em>Daas Tevunos</em> - if the world was about the reward, the free will (main instrument for achieving this) should have never been terminated. But we know free will at some point in the future will be abolished and the Creator will reveal Himself fully, so for Him, the purpose is in revelation, not in reward.</p>\n\n<p>A teacher of mine once pointed out that people believe life is like a video game - you collect some bonus points and some demerits, at the end of the level, the demerits get subtracted from the points and one (hopefully) gets to go to the next level. That's not what it is about. Life is a relationship. Like when you take the garbage out at home, it earns you favor with your wife, but the favor is not quantifiable. You take it out to make her feel good, to do something nice for her, not because she will cook you dinner afterwards.

That being the case, it's not so clear how to actually arrive at any given halacha lemaaseh.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I'm going to disregard your second paragraph, since a \"modern-day\" posek (your example was of the Mishna Berurah) doesn't go from the Talmud directly into halakha lema'aseh, but is already familiar with a great wealth of material that both predates the former and spans the two. For regular people, like ourselves, who want to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between Talmudic dicta and contemporary halakhot, there are ways in which one can do this.</p>\n\n<p>Let's assume that you are commencing with an individual sugya. The chances are that any Shas that you are using is going to have a useful index called Eyn Mishpat, which was compiled by a 16th century scholar named R' Yehoshua Boaz Barukh (known as the \"Shiltei haGibborim\"). That provides references to passages in the Rambam's Mishne Torah, R' Moshe of Coucy's Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (\"SMaG\") and R' Yaakov ben Asher's Arba'ah Turim. The latter work employs the same numbering system as R' Yosef Caro's Shulchan Arukh, giving you references to that corpus as well.</p>\n\n<p>How you proceed from there is up to you. Personally, I prefer to use the Arba'ah Turim, since the commentaries of R' Yosef Caro (\"Bet Yosef\") and R' Moshe Isserles (\"Darkhei Moshe\") will give you a wealth of information that you can then follow up separately. Furthermore, since it employs the same numbering system as the Shulchan Arukh, you can proceed next to the Arukh haShulchan (by R' Yehiel Michel Epstein, a 19th-20th century scholar) and find references there to an abundance of material published after the 16th century. Similarly, if the material that you are looking at is in Orach Chayim, you can check the Mishna Berurah for the author's Be'ur Halakha, which is similar in scope.</p>\n\n<p>If your interest leans more towards the Rishonim and the earlier period of Acharonim, I would advise checking the Mordekhai and (if what you are looking at is one of the masekhtas in which it appears), the Shittah Mequbetzet. The former was by the students of R' Mordechai ben Hillel (13th c.), and the latter by R' Bezalel Ashkenazi (16th c.). Where the former is a source for a large number of statements by Rishonim not recorded elsewhere, so too is the latter for early generations of Acharonim. Even more easily, you can follow Eyn Mishpat to the Rambam and check the commentaries there (Kesef Mishna, Hagahot Maimoniyot, etc).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>From the Gemara, one would learn the relevant Rishonim, Achronim, Teshuvah literature, and later Halakhic works... there's quite a lot to go through on any given 'sugyah' (Talmudic topic). </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the choice that a posek is faced with when there are differing opinions on the matter, there are a few general rules aptly referred to as 'kelalei hapsak' (general rules of paskening) which are scattered throughout the Gemara and Rishonim (like any halakha) and have been collected by certain Achronim, such as by the Peri Megadim, Knesses Hagedolah, and the Maharit Algazi, and more recently, Rav Ovadia and Rav Yitzchak Yosef (in the introductions to Yalkut Yosef, and in a major three volume work called 'Ein Yitzchak'). </p>\n\n<p>These rules are varied and detailed, but some major ones are: following the majority (not necessary a quantitative majority; some 'greater' earlier poskim might outweigh numerous others), following the Shulchan Aruch and Rama, and following well established customs. Different poskim will give different weights to these considerations, for example, Rav Ovadia Yosef gives much stronger weight to the Shulchan Aruch. Of course, there's also the question of what makes the most sense. Rav Moshe Feinstein was wont to argue on earlier poskim becuase he thought he had a better explanation of a Gemara than they did, for example. These 'shikulim' (measuring/weighing) aren't clear cut and different people feel differently about these rules, which is why we follow poskim (as opposed to making our own decisions) in the first place; only someone with the appropriate breadth and depth of knowledge can be assumed to have the proper instincts about when and how to apply these rules. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Chacham must first know the \"borders\" of the halacha to determine what is permitted or forbidden. In cases of doubt, the Chacham may rule according to the clalim; a major one being that in cases of doubt regarding a Torah law, be stringent, while in cases of Rabbinic law, be lenient. These clalim serve as keys to learning the final ruling in most sugyas and were taught by Ravina and Rav Ashi, the redactors of the Talmud Bavli. </p>\n\n<p>To further clarify, the Chacham may learn how the Rishonim understood or learned the final ruling of the Gemara and make his way towards the Acharonim to further strengthen his own conclusion or reject it for that of one of their conclusions, if his da'at accepts it. </p>\n\n<p>The fundamental key in paskening is that the Chacham absolutely believes that the conclusion he is holding is the correct ruling and he is able to explain why in a clear and concise manner, without a doubt. The more he is sure, the stronger he will be. </p>\n\n<p>However, most of us nowadays, don't have the yishuv hada'at or harchavat halev to \"stand the Din on it's feet\", unfortunately, due to the times after the Second Beit Hamikdash; so we rely on the rulings of the Shulchan Aruch and the poskim that came before us to decide halacha l'ma'aseh, generally. Even so, the Chachamim of each generation have the ability from Shamayim to guide the Jewish people through their times. One who doesn't accept this, without having the proper level of scholarship to disagree on issues of halacha, borders on heresy and apikorsut. </p>\n\n<p>So nowadays, almost no one is moreh halacha from the Talmud alone because it requires a high level of peace and scholarship that is almost unavailable due to the times(with the latter being available, baruch HaShem!); you get to halacha l'ma'aseh by having the simple explanation of the Talmud's conclusions and then referring to the Shulchan Aruch and it's commentators, with the fundamental key of believing that the conclusion you are holding is the true one and fits the case at hand, according to the rules of hora'ah.</p>\n\n\n",

Why specifically do we burn it instead of finding another way to dispose of it? Perhaps a lest wasteful way would be to feed it to fish or other ownerless animals.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Mishna in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=21&format=pdf\">Pesachim 2:1</a> records a dispute as to how Biur Chametz is to be done. Rabbi Yehuda, comparing the destruction of Chametz to the destruction of invalid Korbanot, rules that Chametz must be destroyed by burning. The Chachamim there argue and rule that any form of destruction (tossing into the sea, or crumbling it into the wind) is acceptable. The Rambam, a Sephardi, in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/3503.htm#11\">Chametz U'Matza 3:11</a> rules like the Chachamim, while Tosfot, an Ashkenazi, on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=27b&format=pdf\">Pesachim 27b</a> sv Ein rules like Rabbi Yehuda. The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49627&st=&pgnum=40\">OC 445:1</a>) rules like the Rambam and Chachamim, while the Rama notes that the custom in Ashkenaz is to destroy the chametz with fire, seemingly (and the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49627&st=&pgnum=41\">Mishna Berura sk 6</a> notes this at well) in order to fulfill the mitzva according to Rabbi Yehuda as well.</p>\n\n<p>Note that even without that custom, the Shulchan Aruch rules in OC 448:6 that you can't feed chametz to an ownerless animal based on Yerushalmi Pesachim 2:1. This would only apply after the 5th hour on Erev Pesach when benefit from chametz becomes prohibited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Kaf Hachayim 445:11 quotes that kabbalistically it is preferable to burn the chometz as it symbolizes the destruction of the Yetzer Harah.</p>\n\n<p>The Rashash (Pesachim 21b) suggests, according to one opinion, that eating chometz accomplishes burning it, since the heat of your body is like burning.  And אדם כי עץ השדה, a man is like a tree, so you even get the benefit of using a wood fire, which the Rashash in Shabbos 66 says is a necessary part of burning it. However, the Rashash only suggests this approach within Rashi's understanding of the Gemara.  Eating chometz in the days leading up to Pesach in order to get rid of it, in any event, would present no issues and fulfill the mitzvah of burning it according to this Rashash.</p>\n\n\n",

I would like to find this source, <em>and</em> any other practical results of this prayer's origin.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2209.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tefilah 9:9</a>) and Rashba (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1376&pgnum=91\" rel=\"nofollow\">Responsum 1:183</a>) write that Maariv's status as <em>reshut</em> is the reason there is no enactment for the leader to repeat the Amida aloud for those who don't know how to pray.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Besides what's already been mentioned, there are a few leniencies because of this, though I've never heard of your specific one. </p>\n\n<p>There's a much larger discussion in halakhic literature about how careful (or not) we are about davening maariv at the proper time, and the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2203.htm#7\">3:7</a>) believes that this is because Maariv is a reshut. </p>\n\n<p>The Beis Yosef (268:13) says that if one forget to mention Shabbos on Friday night davening, then it's enough to hear (or say with the chazzan, according to the Magen Avraham there s.k. 15) the 'Beracha Me'en Shalosh' because Maariv is a reshut. </p>\n\n<p>Another nafka minah (practical difference): the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2210.htm#6\">Hil. Tefillah 10:6</a>) believes that if one suddenly remembered in the middle of his prayer, even in the middle of a beracha, that he had already davened shemoneh esreh, than he should stop right away. However, when it comes to Maariv, since he didn't technically need to daven anyway, he can continue praying despite the fact that he had already davened maariv. In practice, however, the Raavad (there) argues, and therefore the Aruch Hashulchan (107:6) states that one should add something to his prayer as per the general rule of 'tefilat nedava' (optional prayer). (However, this isn't true according to Reb Chaim on the Rambam there). </p>\n\n<p>Another difference is that according to R' Yaakov of Lisa (Derech HaChaim) is that if one is unsure whether or not he has davened, he normally should daven (what may be a second time), but this is not the case for Maariv. However, the Aruch HaShulchan argues (107:10) so I wouldn't follow this lehalacha. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Rosh in Berachos ch. 4 siman 2 writes</p>\n\n<p>.וי\"ל  דנהי שהיא רשות אין לבטלה אם לא מפני צורך שעה כגון מפני מצוה עוברת ושרי המייניה דלא מטרחינן ליה בפ\"ק דשבת דף ט: וכן עלה על מטתו בירושלמי דאין מטריחין אותו לירד</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Granted that [maariv] is optional, [nonetheless] one may not omit it without a timely reason, such as a time-sensitive mitzvah, or [the case of] someone who loosens their belt who we do not trouble him, and also [we find in] the Yerushalmi <strong>someone who went into bed we do not trouble him to get back out of bed.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Rosh provides three examples, one of which, from the Yerushalmi, is basically the one mentioned in the question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is praising non-Jews actually prohibited?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemara Avodah Zara (20) explains that praising a non-Jew is a violation of \"lo sechaneim\", and this is quoted in the Rambam (Hil. Avodah Zara 10:6) and the Shulchan Aruch (Y\"D 151, and Shach s.k. 18 says that this applies to all non-Jews).</p>\n\n<p>However, it seems like we aren't so careful about this. After all, Chazal themselves praised Antoninus and Dama ben Nesinah, and it seems like no one, from Rishonim (such as the Rambam's praises of Aristotle) to today, has any serious issue with this. Does anyone know of a source that discusses these specific cases or has a list of 'kulos' that would cover the common practice?</p>\n\n<p>I know of a few exceptions (such the Shulchan Aruch there allows it if it's meant as a praise of Hashem or Jews) and the most widely applicable is probably that of R. Moshe Shterbach (Teshuvos Vehanhagos 4:197) who allows praising a non-Jew whom one doesn't know personally, but it seems like there must be more leniencies.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rambam in Hilchot Avodat Kochavim 10:1 states that the seven nations are included in the prohibition of lo techaneim, but Jews and Gerei Toshav are not. This seemingly leaves generic idol worship up in the air. The context of the verse in Deuteronomy is clearly restricted to the seven nations, although most Rishonim seem to extend it to all Idolators.</p>\n\n<p>Society today has few idolaters in the classical sense of the word, and with all the murkiness around the law, for the sake of peace (Eivah), like many other laws involving relationships with non-jews, many rabbanim I have come into contact with are lenient.

If so, was it only frowned upon in excess?\nPlease source from Chazal, Rishonim, and Acharonim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Just how many sources do you want? There are so many, like in almost any topic. Here are a few (limited to those specifically that indicate whether or not Chazal thought of drinking as favorable or frowned upon)</p>\n\n<p>A bit of Shas:</p>\n\n<p>Berachot 40a quotes an opinion that the Etz HaDaas was a grapevine, because we know that grapes cause sorrow to the world. Similarly, Yoma 76 says that wine is called יין because it brings moaning (יללה), though the Gemara continues that if one is worthy, the wine will make him happier or wiser. Similarly, later on in Berachot (57a), it says, 'some drink wine and it's good for them, and some drink wine and it's bad for them'. The Gemara in Bava Basra (90b) prohibits bringing foods outside of Eretz Yisrael, but allows exporting wine because less wine means less תפלות (levity). Sanhedrin (70), in discussing the Ben Sorer UMoreh, mentions to take lessons from Adam and Noach and that wine can cause destruction. Yoma 71, like the source you quoted, indicates that drinking wine was common, as it states that one who wants to do the equivalent of pouring wine on the mizbeach should fill the throats of talmidei chachamim (with wine). Also, Megillah 17 states that Yosef sent his father wine from Egypt because דעת זקנים נוחה ממנה, the minds of elders are bettered by it. Even more positive is the opinion in Nedarim (10) and Nazir (22) that a nazir is called a 'sinner' because he separated himself from wine. Pesachim 109 states, 'there is no happiness other than through wine', indicating that this is how one should fulfill the mitzvah of being happy on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>Rishonim:</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra on the pesukim by nazir (Bamidbar 6:2) says that nothing is more destructive to service of Hashem as wine. The Sefer Hachinuch similarly explains the concept of nazirus (Mitzvah 372) and kilei hakerem (Mitzvah 549). Radak, however, on the oft quoted pasuk יין ישמח לבב אנוש (Tehillim 104:15), writes that wine makes one happier by opening the mind, and he clearly understood wine-drinking (probably in moderation) to be a good thing. The Rambam in Hil. Deios (5:3) says that a righteous person drinks wine for health purposes but one who becomes drunk is a חוטא ומגונה ומפסיד חכמתו - a sinner, disgusting, and loses his wisdom. The Rambam is just as severe in Moreh Nevuchim (3:8). In Hil. Yom Tov 6:10 he points out that even in the context of holiday joy, it is impossible to serve Hashem while drunk. The Orchos Tzadikim says in Shaar HaSimcha that one needs to be happy to properly serve Hashem, and wine is a legitimate way to increase one's happiness if it's done in appropriately small amounts and not made into a habit. </p>\n\n<p>Maharal (on Sanhedrin 70a) discusses wine as something belonging to Olam Haba.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The rambam in de'os writes that it is <em>forbidden</em> to drink in the afternon (when you will get drunk) based of the Mishnah in avos (3: 10).\nThe Orchos Chaim is also in the Kol Bo, and their source is the Meoros to Megillah 7b who also writes that there is no greater sin than drunkenness.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Avraham Ben HaRambam writes (p. 556 in English Feldheim ed.) that although the Torah didnt forbid wine since it is sometimes useful, it didnt prohibit drunkenness since there is no way way to define the difference between too much and not too much.  However we are required to draw the line for ourselves, as we realize (from several passages in the Torah) that the Torah opposes drunkenness.\nThe Rashba says the same thing almost word for word in the maamar al Yishmael.</p>\n\n<p>The Malmad Hatalmidim (13th cent. Provence) similarly writes (parshas tazria) that when it comes to things which are logically inappropriate the Torah suffices with preventing us from doing them through hints in stories and the like, <em>such as drunkenness</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Orchos Chaim Hilchos Purim 38 writes that getting drunk is completely forbidden, and there is no greater sin, as it leads to illicit relationships, spilling blood, and many other sins.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Contradiction in the Bartenura regarding value to food added by firewood",
    "content": "# Contradiction in the Bartenura regarding value to food added by firewood\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There appears to be an interesting contradiction in the Bartenura's peirush on the Mishna. In Maaser Sheni 2:1, the mishna notes that if we improve the flavour of <em>maaser sheni</em> wine by adding honey or spices, the extent to which the wine increases in value must be reckoned against a calculation based on the value of the honey and the spices which were <em>chullin</em>. But if we heat <em>maaser sheni</em> dough over a fire, the value of the dough rises as a result and we need subtract nothing for the value of the wood. The Bartenura explains the difference between these two cases as follows (s.v. השבח לשני):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ופודה את הפת בשויו, ואין חולקין השבח לעצים של חולין, אלא כל השבח למעשר\n  שני, לפי שאין שבח עצים ניכר בפת </p>\n  \n  <p>We can redeem the bread at its full value, and need not apportion out\n  the value of the wood of <em>chullin</em>. Rather, all of the profit is <em>maaser\n  sheni</em> <strong>since the improvement conferred by the wood is not recognised\n  in the bread</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Contrast that with what he has to say on the mishna in 'Orlah 3:4! There, the mishna observes that if we cook a stew using husks of <em>'orlah</em>, the stew needs to be destroyed. The gemara (Pesachim 26b) understands this mishna to be referring to an oven that is lit with husks of <em>'orlah</em> and that the reason that it is forbidden is because the husks improve the taste. Note the Bartenura (s.v. ידלק):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דיש שבח עצים בתבשיל, וכן בפת</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Since wood confers an improvement on stew, and also on bread</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Am I to assume that the Bartenura recognises that the quality of the wood improves the taste of the bread, but in a manner incommensurate with the <em>value</em> of the wood? That makes little sense to me, since the cost of wood is a good indicator of its quality. How else might the contradiction between these two passages be resolved?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Tosfos Yom Tov (in both places) notes this apparent contradiction in the Mishnayos. His answer is that the improvement made by olrah wood is different because then the benefit came from something prohibited, as opposed to by Maaser Sheni where the wood was something permitted. </p>\n\n<p>I think that this answers your question, because the issue with orlah is not because of deriving <em>monetary</em> benefit from the orlah, but because the <em>taste</em> of the <em>food</em> is improved, and orlah is prohibited from being eaten, not just from an increase in value. (I think it's plausible to say that the difference of improvement in the bread's taste by being baked by a wood-fueled fire as opposed to a different fire isn't significant, but at the same time, there's still <em>flavor</em> given to the bread. This flavor is prohibited to be eaten if it came from orlah.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Removing fifth corner of Tallit\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Shuchan Aruch rules (OC 10:1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טלית שאין לה ד' כנפות פטורה יש לה יותר מד' חייבת ועושה לה ארבע ציציות בארבע כנפיה המרוחקות זו מזו יותר:‏<br>\n  Clothing that doesn't have four corners is exempt [from Tzitzit]. If it has more than four it is obligated and he makes four fringes on the four corners which are furthest from each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And (ibid. :5):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היו לה ג' כנפות ועשה בהם ג' ציציות ושוב עשה לה כנף ד' ועשה גם בו ציצית פסולה משום תעשה ולא מן העשוי:‏<br>\n  If it had three corners and he made three fringes, and then he made a fourth corner and made a fringe for it too, it is invalid because [one must make the fringes validly not have them become valid by an external action].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question: Does the same problem apply to a five-cornered garment whose fringeless fifth corner was removed after making the other four fringes, if the fringes were not originally placed on the corners furthest from each other?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Kanievsky <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_49173_26.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quotes the Mishnah Berurah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טלית שיש לה יותר מד' כנפות כגון בת ה' ... חייבת בציצית ... וי\"א דהוא מדאורייתא ויש להמחמיר אם אפשר אבל אם כבר נעשה בכנף הקרוב ואי אפשר לתקן ... יכול לסמוך על המקילין ולברך.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So some say that the requirement to keep them furthest apart is a Torah matter, so it is preferable, however if it isn't possible, the lenient opinion can be relied on, even to say a blessing.</p>\n<p>Applying that here, it seems the garment's tzitzis in your case would be Kosher according to the main opinion (since even if the fifth corner remained he relies on it to say a blessing) as removing the fifth corner isn't going to suddenly make it worse.</p>\n<p>In and of itself, that answers the main question (the issue with the furthest corner according to the controlling Halachic opinion is that this is not an issue which invalidates the Tzitzis, so if it was Kosher with a (non-fringed) fifth corner there kal-vechomer without the fifth corner there), and this opinion can be relied on to say a Bracha if other options are not available.</p>\n<p>However the question remains according to those that say the Tzitzis were posul, so that fourth corner was never obligated in Tzitzis. It seems to me that it is the logical equivalent of putting it on the side and then cutting the garment down to make that a corner. Such a case is like putting the Tzitzis further in than three thumbs from the proper corner and then cutting a hole to move the Tzitizis to move them closer. If you do that, it is considered מין העשוי. To quote the <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/4/11/15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם עשה הנקב למעלה מג' גודלין ואחר שהטיל הציצית בנקב חתך בנקב כדי שיתלו הציצית למטה מג' גודלין פסול משום שנאמר גדילים תעשה וגו' ולא מן העשוי כבר בפיסול</p>\n<p>If he made a hole higher than 3 Thumb-widths and after he tied the Tzitzis in the hole he cuts the hole in order that the Tzitzis hang below three thumbs it is invalid ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The description of the problem of מין העשוי from more at length in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/4/10/10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמתחלה כשהטיל הג' ציצית בבגד היתה עשייתן בפסול שעדיין לא היתה הטלית מחוייבת בציצית כלל שהרי לא היה בה עדיין ד' כנפות ואע\"פ שאח\"כ עשה בה גם הכנף הד' מכל מקום אין הג' ציצית הראשונים חוזרים להיות כשרים על ידי כך כיון שלא עשה בהם עצמן שום מעשה חדש להכשירן והתורה אמרה גדילים תעשה ולא מן העשוי כבר בפסול</p>\n<p>Originally, when he placed the three Tzitzis on the garment, they were made invalidly for the clothing was not yet obligated in Tzitzit at all for it still didn't have four corners, and even though afterwards he made a fourth corner, nevertheless the three Tzitzis don't return to being valid through this since he didn't do a any new action to validate them, and the Torah says \"You shall make fringes\" and not from what was already made <em>invalidly</em> (emp. added).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this the problem of מין העשוי applies when you make a Tzitzis in a place where either the whole garment does not (yet) require them or on a garment that does require them, but not the place that requires it, and do no further action on the strings to make them Kosher. According to the opinion that the Tzitzis are invalid on the non-furthest corner, that one was not made in a place that required Tzitzis (according to that opinion), so it is מין העשוי when you remove the 5th corner.</p>\n\n\n",

And since Chazal explained on the verse in Bamidbar (18,8) “Behold, I have given to you all the holy things of the children of Yisrael for distinction” - for greatness, like the kings eat, it is clear that the priesthood is considered like royalty, and thus the verse “there is no ruling on the day of death” applies to them also.</p>\n<p>Therefore, since on this day two of the sons of Aharon died - and in truth all of them were liable to be killed as the Midrash on this parsha teaches - for them this was a day of death, and so they were not referred to by their title of authority. And it is for this reason that the Torah commenced the parsha by saying “ויהי (an expression which Chazal taught indicates that a distressing event happened at that time) on the eighth day” in order to hint that it would be a day on which there was to be a distressing event, and therefore it was not fitting to refer to them as Kohanim in this parsha because there is no ruling on the day of death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Full text in English can be found <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Kluger-Books/Imrei-Shefer/Shemini.html#2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

He takes the view that Shmuel Hanavi was allowed to kill Agag because of the principle of 'Aseh docheh lo saaseh'. The mitzva to kill Amalek (particularly, as he was the last living Amalekite at the time,) superseded the aveira of becoming tamei. This is quite a novel answer. The Noda Beyehuda understands from Shmuel's actions that this principle applies even when it would be possible to fulfill both mitzvos. Shmuel could have had someone else kill Agag who had no transgression to become tamei, or as he suggests, Shmuel could have killed Agag by shooting arrows at him. The fact that he personally killed him by cleaving him into four pieces, (ND\"B citing Rashi) means that the mitzva overrode the issue of tuma.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Reisman in one of his shiurim said that Shmuel could have worn gloves in order to prevent tumas mes.

Is it considered appropriate to spell it as נטליה, which seems like the most correct transliteration? </p>\n\n<p>As a child in a yeshiva, I had teachers who would not write names ending in יה as it contained G-d's name. They would instead write it as just י or replace the ה with an apostrophe. I am wondering if, since the Ketubah is intended to be kept permanently and not destroyed / erased, this consideration would not apply?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If this question is relevant to you, consult your rabbi. (Indeed, if it's relevant to you, then you're getting married — <em>mazal tov</em>! — and should have someone officiating your wedding who knows the main rules, knows how to find out the other rules, and will be able to answer this question for you.)</p>\n\n<p>But for background information, here's a source: <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em>, <em>Even Haezer</em> 129, discusses, in general, the spelling of names in general and, in particular, the spelling of a number of specific names, including a number that end with <em>yod he</em>. He does not say to curtail the name before the <em>he</em> or to replace the <em>he</em> with an apostrophe. (Nor does he indicate that one should put a hyphen or apostrophe between the <em>yod</em> and the <em>he</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>However, I can think of two reasons this <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> may possibly not apply to your question: First, he's discussing <em>gitin</em> (bills of divorce), not <em>k'subos</em> (prenuptial agreements), and my impression is that the exactitude we enforce on writing names correctly is stronger for the former. Therefore, perhaps we wouldn't mind modifying a name slightly in a <em>k'suba</em>, if there is some benefit to doing so. Second, he does say that the spelling of a name often follows how it is used by the person (how, for example, the person signs that name); it may follow, then, that his not mentioning curtailing or replacing the final <em>he</em> in a <em>get</em> is because no one signed his name that way in his day (and place) and that it should be done now if the name's owner does so.</p>\n\n\n",

Aryeh Lebowitz, discussing the very similar case of purchasing a dish which has been pre-filled with candies to give as a gift, which I think addresses most of your questions.</p>\n\n<p>I am going to answer the questions in reverse order, as I think the logic is easier to see this way.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>If I don't immerse the dish, may the recipient use the dish for its function of holding/serving the brownies, or must they be transferred to another dish?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>From R. Lebowitz:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Hershel Schachter has ruled that candy dishes require tevilah even before the first usage. The recipient is obligated to empty out the contents and immerse the utensil before eating anything from the plate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Presumably, the same holds true here; the recipient may not use the dish for its function of holding/serving the brownies, but must instead transfer them to another dish.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>If I immerse the dish, is that sufficient for the recipient?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>One of R. Lebowitz' suggestions in the case of the pre-filled candy dish is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The author of Sefer Shiurei Halacha Al Purim writes that he asked Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach whether, in a situation in which the buyer has paid for the item but not yet done any formal acquisition, the store may then do the tevilah for the buyer. Rav Shlomo Zalman ruled that while payment alone does not effect a transaction, it suffices to turn the utensil into meal utensils. Similarly, Ohalei Yeshurun (p. 64 n. 212) cites the ruling of Rav Moshe Feinstein that as soon as a purchaser expresses clear intent to buy an item, it is classified as a meal utensil and is therefore ready for tevilah. A viable solution may be to have stores only sell glass and metal candy dishes with advance orders. Once the item is ordered and payment is made, the store can immerse the dish on behalf of the customer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication for your case is that the gifter himself may indeed <em>tovel</em> the dish, as it is \"classified as a meal utensil and is therefore ready for tevilah\". This is the key difference from the case under discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14213/tevilat-keilim-on-a-gift\">here</a>. The <em>tevilah</em> done by the gifter then works for the recipient.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Am I obligated to immerse the dish?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is not discussed directly in the linked article, but I think the gifter has an obligation to <em>tovel</em> the dish for two reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, because he has purchased it with intent to use it himself for food preparation, as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, as noted in R. Lebowitz' article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[I]t would seem to be a violation of lifnei iveir (placing a stumbling block in front of the blind) to sell a utensil that requires tevilah to a Jewish consumer who will likely not do so. Since the average recipient of a gift, even if normally scrupulous about immersing utensils, may not realize that the candy dish that came full of candies will require tevilah the store bears some responsibility to inform the consumer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I assume the same holds true for the gifter in your case - to avoid issues of <em>lifnei iver</em> he must either <em>tovel</em> it himself (which we established above that he is able to do) or at the very least inform the recipient that he needs to <em>tovel</em> it before (even a first-time) use.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Moshe told him the Mishnah Berurah 8:26 is commenting in response to the Mechaber (se'if 11) that \"the main mitzva is ON TOP of the beged...\" to which Mishnah Berurah 8:26 clarifies that it is a great disgrace to wear the beged OUT and the strings IN.

According to the simple understanding of Mishnah Berurah 8:26 this would have been a violation of \"U'reisem Oso\" ... it sounds crazy to us Americans, but the Chafetz Chayim should have cut little tzitzis holes, or at least worn his frock open.

    "content": "# What is the basic requirement for tzitzit knots?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pWaRH.jpg\" alt=\"different ways to tie tzitzit knots\"></p>\n\n<p>There seems to be a lot of different ways to tie tzitzit knots. From the little I understand this is based on various symolism and numeric value (see this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12291/tzitzit-tying-the-real-way\">question/answer</a>). I would like to know what the basic essential halacha is. Meaning, If I have 8 strings per corner and I tie 5 double knots is that sufficient?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Menahot 39a implies that the bare minimum Biblical obligation is only one knot. However, Tosfot there understand that this single knot mentioned by the Gemara is actually (what we would call) a double knot, because a single knot doesn't hold tight. However, there are other traditions of how to make this knot, such as in the example all the way to the right in your picture. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Rabbis have a tradition (quoted in that same place, Menahot 38b-39a) that there must also be 'chulyot', which is usually translated to mean 'windings', which is why you see in the picture that you have a combination of knots and windings. The Gemara (there) states that one should alternate windings and knots, and that there can be anywhere between 7 and 13 windings. (However, it isn't clear if each 'winding' refers to wrapping the string around once, or groups of a few windings, as in most of the examples in your picture.) This may imply that the minimum (Rabbinic) requirement is 7 knots.</p>\n\n<p>Another tradition, quoted by Rashi (Numbers 15:38) and the Midrash Tanhuma (Korach 12) is to make five knots on each corner. Therefore, the minimum Rabbinic requirement would be five knots, which is indeed followed by most Jewish communities, with a few variations on the number of windings (see Shulchan Aruch O.C. 11:14 and commentators there). Therefore, if you were to merely tie five knots, (separated by series of one string wound around the rest at least 7 times) that would almost certainly fulfill the mitzvah according to the Rabbinic requirements.</p>\n\n\n",

This is similar to the questions about relatives who convert and the various laws of inheritence. A man who has a child by a non-Jewish woman is not considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah of Pru U'Rvu and the child has no connection with him. This is analogous in the case of the person who blasphemed in the desert. The meforshim (Ramban, Rashi, Medrash) explain that he was the son of a Jewish woman (and so Jewish) but because his father was a nonJew he could not be a member of the tribe of Dan. A convert cannot be a member of a tribe (no matter who his father was) and this would also apply to being a 'descendant of Aharon'. </p>\n\n<p>Another example is that the Torah talks of someone who dies with 'no heirs'. Only a convert can be in this situation because even if he and his children (or other relatives) convert, they are not considered relatives.

Beer contains approximately 5%\n  alcohol and people who want a drink with a higher alcohol content do\n  the following. The grain is allowed to ferment until it reaches about\n  12-13% and then the alcohol is separated from (some of) the water\n  using a process called “distillation” to produce whisky which contains\n  30-95% alcohol. The consensus of the Poskim is that whisky produced\n  from one of the 5 grains is considered chametz even though it went\n  through the process of distillation (see Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 92:8 &\n  123:24, and Mishnah Berurah 442:4). Even if the whisky is made from\n  corn or another kitniyot grain, there are a number of other reasons\n  why it may be chametz:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>The watery liquid that remains after distillation is called “backset” and is often used in creating another batch of whisky. Thus,\n  even if the grain used in creating the whisky is kitniyot, the water\n  may be from a chametz whisky.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Before the yeast ferments the grain, the grain’s starch must be broken-down into individual glucose molecules, and this is\n  traditionally done with barley malt (discussed above). Since the\n  chametz barley malt plays such a crucial role in the creation of the\n  whisky (and also dramatically changes the taste of the grain before it\n  is fermented), the barley malt is considered a davar hama’amid and one\n  may not own such whisky on Pesach (see Shulchan Aruch 442:5 and\n  Mishnah Berurah 442:25).</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>As such, all types of whisky should be treated as chametz unless they\n  are specifically certified as kosher for Pesach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Most beer produced today is produced from barley. The barley is soaked in water to malt. Barley is one of the 5 major grains which become Chometz by exposure to water. Regarding the amount of Chometz that is forbidden, Chometz is forbidden B'Mashehu (even a minute amount). However there are grain-free beers that are Kosher for Pesach.</p>\n\n\n",

And\n  to weigh an immediate, fleeting pain, which is without permanence,\n  against a future pain, which is everlasting and without interruption.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding the pleasure (in the afterlife), it is written: \"And when\n  you see this, your heart shall rejoice\" (Isaiah 66:14), and \"the sun\n  of mercy shall rise with healing in its wings for you who fear My\n  Name. Then will you go forth and be rich as fatted calves\" (Malachi\n  3:20), while regarding the pain it is written: \"And they shall go\n  forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed\n  against Me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire\n  ever be quenched; [and they shall be an eternal abhorrence unto all\n  flesh]\" (Isaiah 66:24), and \"For lo, the day comes, that shall burn\n  like a furnace, and all the audacious sinners and all the perpetrators\n  of wickedness shall be stubble. And the sun that comes shall burn them\n  up so that it will leave them neither root nor branch, says the L-ord\n  of Hosts\" (Malachi 3:19). When the sinner puts this matter to heart,\n  he will deem it proper to take on himself not to repeat his sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and another one from Gate 3 <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=416#ch3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ch3</a> regarding one who neglects to follow the obligations dictated by his understanding such as an atheist who neglects his duty to fully investigate the truth as to whether there is a Creator and if yes, what does He want from me.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And when he does not accept the duties dictated by the\n  understanding with which he is endowed, and its rebuke, he loses the\n  character of a rational creature; and the cattle understand how to\n  improve their condition better than he does, as it is said, \"The ox\n  knows his owner, and the donkey his master's trough; but Israel does\n  not know; My people does not consider\" (Isaiah 1:3). Such a person's\n  fate will be like that of one, concerning whom it is said, \"But the\n  wicked shall perish; and the enemies of the L-ord shall be as the fat\n  of lambs, they shall be consumed; into smoke shall they be utterly\n  consumed\" (Psalm 37:20).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But if it is not one's fault for whatever reason, then the torah exempts one for liability of his actions,as the talmud derives in various places such as Nedarim 27a and as the Chovos Halevavos explains in Gate 5 <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=383#ch5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ch.5</a> regarding not considering yourself better than a seemingly bad person.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And even if his appearance is bad, it is possible that the reason is\n  because he is ignorant of his obligations to the Creator. Therefore he\n  is more pardonable than me, because my knowledge is greater than his.\n  <strong>For the Creator claims from a man only according to the extent of his</strong>\n  knowledge. Therefore, I am more deserving to be considered\n  reprehensible for my shortcomings in the Creator's service, despite my\n  knowledge compared, to this man whose shortcoming is due to his\n  ignorance. He rebels against G-d due to ignorance and error, while I\n  rebel against Him knowingly and deliberately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see it is not a single answer for everyone.

Since the Jewish G‑d cannot be seen or described, they considered this person to be without any god at all. Turns out that Judaism is closer to atheism than most people's theism.

But certain situations arise where a person needs to be stern or even confrontational at times to get people to get things done. I am aware of sefirah of gevurah, but everytime I am stern, I usually feel really bad. How does Judaism look at being stern with people, is it looked down upon or a necessary evil so to speak?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> himself addresses this. He writes in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1202.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot De'ot (2:6)</a> that although one should avoid anger, should the need for sternness arise, one should feign the emotions, while remaining cool, calm, and collected: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן הכעס, דעה רעה היא עד למאוד; וראוי לאדם שיתרחק ממנה עד הקצה האחר, וילמד עצמו שלא יכעוס, ואפילו על דבר שראוי לכעוס עליו.  ואם רצה להטיל אימה על בניו ובני ביתו, או על הציבור אם היה פרנס, ורצה לכעוס עליהם, כדי שיחזרו למוטב--יראה עצמו בפניהם שהוא כועס כדי לייסרם, ותהיה דעתו מיושבת בינו לבין עצמו, כאדם שהוא מידמה איש בשעת כעסו, והוא אינו כועס.</p>\n  \n  <p>And so to anger is an extremely negative character trait, and it is proper for a person to distance himself from it to the opposite extreme, and he should train himself to not get angry, and even on something that it is normal to get angry over. And should he want to impose fear on his children or household, or on the community, were he a communal leader, and he should he want to get angry at them so that they return to the proper way, he should make himself appear to them as though he is angry in order to chastise them, but inside he should remain calm, like a person who is imitating an angry person, but is himself not angry. (Translation my own)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His son <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Moses_ben_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Avraham</a>, similarly writes (HaMaspik L'ovdey Hashem ed. Wincelberg page 71) that anger is <em>always</em> inappropriate; even when it would seem normal in circumstances. External sternness however, <em>is</em> sometimes necessary. In fact, he writes that one [such as a ruler] who must administer punishment and does so with pure intentions and not out of anger is on a level of piety close to that of prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>Evidently, sternness is not only sometimes warranted, but in cases where it is, if it is with pure intentions, it is appropriate and praiseworthy.</p>\n\n\n",

So as you kill them you immediately causes the brain to die and hence no pain sensations!</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I can't agree with any Rabbi who says it is Ok for a Noahide to eat unclean foods like a pig. Because logically if the unclean animal feels pain when you slaughter it, that amounts to TORTURING THE ANIMAL!  That is just like taking its limb whilst it is alive!</p>\n\n<p>So yes ... yes indeed, I firmly believe a Noahide SHOULD NOT EAT an unclean animal!  It is violating one of the 7 Laws of Noah because the unclean animal feels pain before it dies even if you slaughter it the kosher way!</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, I will go as far to say, any CLEAN ANIMAL not slaughtered the Kosher way (such as in the slaughter houses in America, etc ...), is TORTURING the animal. They die in fear, and anyone who eats them, eats \"the fear\"!</p>\n\n<p>By the way, didn't G-d told Noah they entered in the Ark to separate the CLEAN from UNCLEAN animals ???

As such, it may follow that one who needs to eat non-kosher meat for whatever reason is not obligated to subsequently abstain from dairy. In other words, non-kosher meat does not render one <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fleischig\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>fleishig</em></a> insofar as this prohibition is concerned.</p>\n\n<p>But what about the prohibition of consuming meat together with fish (Yoreh De'ah 116:2)? In the event that one is required to eat non-kosher meat, can they eat it with fish as well, or is that still considered \"dangerous\"?</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>This is not a belated Purim question!</strong>]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As you stated, the Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 116:2 forbids the consumption of meat and fish products together, out of concern that it is unhealthy. Since this is a health issue, it should apply to all types of meat and fish. I say this because, if it only applied to certain types of fish and meat, then the Shulchan Oruch would have specified the cases in which it applied and those in which it did not.</p>\n\n<p>I found a full discussion of this subject in <a href=\"http://www.bknw.org/uploads/5/9/9/5/5995719/eating_fish_and_meat.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fish and Meat by Aryeh Leibowitz</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Regardless of the origin of the prohibition, gemara Chullin 9a states\n  explicitly that one must treat dangerous activities with greater\n  stringency than one would treat halachically prohibited activities</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus even though (as quoted below) the prohibition may not apply in our day, or may only apply to the specific fish mentioned in the gemoro, we still should refrain from mixing any type of meat and fish.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It should be noted that recent research has found that stearic acid\n  found in beef may actually lower LDL cholesterol (See American Journal\n  of Clinical Nutrition 1994;60 (Suppl) : 1044s). On the other hand fish\n  contains eicosapentaenoic acid which has been found (paradoxically) to\n  INCREASE lipid peroxidation (J invest dermatology 1994;103:151; Intl J\n  Vitamin Nutrition Res 1994;64: 144; Journal of Nutrition\n  1992;122:2190; Journal of Lipid Research 1991;32:79). In addition\n  there may be an interaction in the liver (P450) between stearic acid\n  and eicosapentaenoic acid. This being said, there is no evidence to\n  indicate that drinking some schnopps in between would in any way solve\n  this problem.</p>\n  \n  <p>The opinion of Magen Avraham. The Magen Avraham (Orach  Chaim 173)\n  writes that there are many natural phenomena  mentioned in the gemara\n  that simply no longer apply today. The  health concern of eating meat\n  and fish is simply another example  of something that used to be a\n  real concern, but is simply no  longer an issue. Perhaps this can be\n  supported by the fact that the  Rambam omits this concern from his\n  Mishnah Torah entirely.  The Chatam Sofer (Responsa 101) offers two\n  explanations for  the omission of the Rambam. First, he suggests, it\n  is possible that  the Rambam knew that the gemara was only concerned\n  with the  specific fish mentioned in Pesachim 76b, but all other fish\n  really  pose no danger when mixed with meat. Alternatively, Chatam \n  Sofer suggests, the Rambam knew that nature has changed and  although\n  there one was a legitimate health threat posed by  mixing fish and\n  meat, no such threat exists today. (It is important  to note that\n  Chatam Sofer does not recommend that we rely on  the Rambam’s opinion\n  in this area.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I can't find the text online to link, but his basic idea is the following:</p>\n\n<p>We generally have a broad intellectual awareness of Hashem and His greatness, which should lead us to righteousness, but does not because there is a block between our minds and our hearts, between our knowledge and the roots of our actions, and the knowledge is not firmly entrenched.  This is what is called טמטום הלב.  When the yetzer hara wants to entice us, it just has to get us to \"ignore\" our awareness of Hashem and convince ourselves that it isn't really bad, or isn't so bad.  The earlier generations did not have such a disconnect.  Their vast awareness directly impacted their way of life.  When the yetzer hara enticed them, its only option was to give them an incredible desire for the sin.  Like when we want something even when we know it is wrong, it looks good and you have a desire for it even with the knowledge that it is bad, the earlier generations were like that for all temptations - it was an act of giving in, not an act of self-deception.</p>\n\n<p>When you know something is bad, and you do it anyways, as soon as you do it and the temptation is removed, you regret it wholeheartedly and feel embarrassed.  Especially with the earlier generations, with their fuller appreciation of Hashem's greatness, felt an incredible regret immediately after giving in.  This is the meaning of ראשונים נתגלה עונם נתגלה קצם (Yoma 9b) - as soon as their sin became apparent, it was the end of the sin.

Isn’t it stated: “And the dead know nothing” (Ecclesiastes 9:5)? Rabbi Ḥiyya said to him: If you read the verse, you did not read it a second time, and if you read it a second time, you did not read it a third time, and if you read it a third time, they did not explain it to you properly. The meaning of the verse: “For the living know that they will die, and the dead know nothing and have no more reward, for their memory has been forgotten” (Ecclesiastes 9:5): For the living know that they will die, these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living. An allusion to this is as it is stated: “And Benayahu, son of Yehoyada, son of a valiant man of Kabze’el, who had done mighty deeds, he smote the two altar-hearths of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow” (II Samuel 23:20). He was referred to in the verse as son of a living man. The Gemara wonders: Is that to say, the fact that the Bible referred to him with that appellation, that all others are children of the dead? Rather, the verse should be explained as follows: <strong>The son of a living man</strong> who lives forever, <strong>who even in death is referred to as living</strong>. Man of Kabze’el who had done mighty deeds, as he accumulated and gathered many workers for the sake of the Torah. Who killed the two lion-hearted men [Ariel] of Moab, as after his death he left no one his equal, in either the First Temple or the Second Temple periods, as the Temple is called Ariel (see Isaiah 29:1), and the two Ariel refers to the two Temples. In contrast to the righteous, who are referred to as living even after their death, the verse states explicitly: <strong>“The dead know nothing.” These are the wicked, who even during their lives are called dead</strong>, as the prophet Ezekiel said in reference to a king of Israel who was alive: “And you are a slain, wicked prince of Israel” (Ezekiel 21:30). And if you wish, say instead that the proof is from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses the dead shall be put to death” (Deuteronomy 17:6). This is puzzling. As long as the accused has not been sentenced to death, he is alive. Rather, this person who is wicked is considered dead from the outset.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also (a bit later in the Sugya)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ש דזעירי הוה מפקיד זוזי גבי אושפזיכתיה עד דאתי ואזיל לבי רב שכיבה אזל בתרה לחצר מות אמר לה זוזי היכא אמרה ליה זיל שקלינהו מתותי בצנורא דדשא בדוך פלן ואימא לה לאימא תשדר לי מסרקאי וגובתאי דכוחלא בהדי פלניתא דאתיא למחר אלמא ידעי</p>\n  \n  <p>With regard to the deceased’s knowledge of what transpires, come and hear a proof, as it is told: Ze’iri would deposit his dinars with his innkeeper. While he was going and coming to and from the school of Rav, she died, <strong>and he did not know where she had put the money. So he went after her to her grave in the cemetery and said to her: Where are the dinars? She replied: Go and get them from beneath the hinge of the door in such and such a place, and tell my mother that she should send me my comb and a tube of eyeshadow with such and such a woman who will die and come here tomorrow.</strong> Apparently, the dead know what transpires in this world. </p>\n  \n  <p>ת\"ש דאבוה דשמואל הוו קא מפקדי גביה זוזי דיתמי כי נח נפשיה לא הוה שמואל גביה הוו קא קרו ליה בר אכיל זוזי דיתמי אזל אבתריה לחצר מות ... אדהכי והכי אתא אבוה חזייה דהוה קא בכי ואחיך אמר ליה מאי טעמא קא בכית אמר ליה דלעגל קא אתית מאי טעמא אחיכת דחשיבת בהאי עלמא טובא אמר ליה אי חשיבנא נעיילוה ללוי ועיילוהו ללוי אמר ליה זוזי דיתמי היכא אמר ליה זיל שקלינהו באמתא דרחיא עילאי ותתאי דידן ומיצעי דיתמי\n  The Gemara cites another proof: Come and hear, as it is told: They would deposit the money of orphans with Shmuel’s father for safekeeping. When Shmuel’s father died, Shmuel was not with him, and did not learn from him the location of the money. Since he did not return it, Shmuel was called: Son of him who consumes the money of orphans. <strong>Shmuel went after his father to the cemetery and said to the dead</strong>: ... Meanwhile, Shmuel’s father came and Shmuel saw that he was crying and laughing. Shmuel said to his father: Why are you crying? His father replied: Because you will come here soon. Shmuel continued and asked: Why are you laughing? His father replied: Because you are extremely important in this world. Shmuel said to him: If I am important, then let them grant Levi entry to the yeshiva. And so it was that they granted Levi entry to the yeshiva. <strong>Shmuel said to his father: Where is the orphans’ money? He said to him: Go and retrieve it from the millhouse, where you will find the uppermost and the lowermost money is ours, and the money in the middle belongs to the orphans.</strong> Shmuel said to him: Why did you do that? He replied: If thieves stole, they would steal from our money on top, which the thief would see first. If the earth swallowed up any of it, it would swallow from our money, on the bottom. Apparently, the dead, in this case Shmuel’s father, know when others will die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1859&pgnum=172\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchas Elazar</a> wrote that these Gemaras are practical Halacha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Torah forbids various superstitious and idolatrous activities including \"doresh el hametim\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְחֹבֵר, חָבֶר; וְשֹׁאֵל אוֹב וְיִדְּעֹנִי, וְדֹרֵשׁ אֶל-הַמֵּתִים</p>\n  \n  <p>or a charmer, or one that consulteth a ghost or a familiar spirit, or a consulter of the dead. (Deut. 18:11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shturem.net/index.php?section=news&id=29039\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yuval Cherlow is inclined towards forbidding the practice on these grounds</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי שאינו חלק מחסידי חב\"ד אינו מכיר כלל במושג הזה. אין אנו דורשים אל המתים, גם בשל העובדה שהתורה אסרה זאת, גם בשל העובדה שאין לנו שום סיבה לחשוב כי שימת דבר מה בתוך ספר הוא שנותן לנו אפשרות לקבל תשובות מלמעלה</p>\n  \n  <p>Somebody who is not a member of Habad does not recognise such a practice at all. We do not perform [such acts of] doresh el hametim. Both because the Torah has forbidden it, and also because we have no reason to think that putting something in a book will give us the ability to receive messages from on high.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[He does preface his statement by noting that: חסידי חב\"ד מאמינים באגרות הקודש – זו זכותם, that is that Habad people are entitled to believe in it. He doesn't seem to be saying that they can practice it, since they too are enjoined with the aforementioned verses. Perhaps he means that the belief itself isn't forbidden.]</p>\n\n<p>This could also be inferred from Rambam's definition of this prohibition in Hilkhot Avodah Zarah (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1411.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">11:14</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איזה הוא דורש אל המתים... כדי שיבוא המת בחלום, ויודיעו מה ישאל עליו.. כללו של דבר:  כל העושה מעשה כדי שיבוא המת ויודיעו--לוקה, שנאמר \"לא יימצא בך . . . ודורש אל המתים\"</p>\n  \n  <p>What is doresh el hametim...In order that the dead person come in a dream and convey information regarding his question...The general rule is: Anyone who performs an act in order that a dead person come to him and inform him [of something], is whipped, as it says: 'It should not be found amongst you...nor one who consults the dead.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is perhaps room to debate whether he would include a case where the spirit of the dead coneys the information indirectly though a book, rather than through other media such as dreams.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is an old age practice (brought in Shulchan Aruch) of asking a child what Posuk he learned that day, and from the content of the Posuk one could learn out what action to take.</p>\n<p>Regarding opening seforim of Tanach and “finding” answers in Pesukim, there is much discussion amongst Poskim whether it should be done or not.</p>\n<p>In any event, from the Rebbe it is clear that it is an accepted custom, and it may be done.

So we must conclude that we worry about repercussions of dreams <em>Lechumra</em> (to be strict on him) but we do not heed repercussios of dreams <em>Lekula</em> (to be lenient). So a dream where the excommunicator redeems his ban does not count as the Gemora then says:אמר ליה רב אחא לרב אשי שמתיה ושרו ליה בחלמיה מאי אמר ליה כשם שאי אפשר לבר בלא תבןכך אי אפשר לחלום בלא דברים בטלים.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>\n <strong>1.</strong>  So we see that we only take notice of a Dream <em>Lechumra</em> to be\n    mechayev the dreamer to separate from his wife for concern that she might\n    discharge blood.<br>\n <strong>2.</strong> However to Release her from a <em>vesset Kavua</em>  which she already had e.g a discharge sequence: 30 day gap 3 times followed by a dream\n    preceeding a discharge 3 times in the sequence 30, 30, 31 days, then\n    the next month she should separate on day 30 even though she hasn't\n    had the dream yet. Therefore it seams one cannot rely on dreams to\n    make a new <em>vesset Kavua</em> (fixed) to break a <em>vesset haguf</em> or\n    <em>vesset zman</em> that already exists.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There was once a woman who got her period every 1st of the secular month, and she realised this was not a veses hachodesh but she could not figure out what it was.\nEventually she realized that it was caused by her paycheck coming in every 1st of the month, this was paskened for her as a veses haguf without any physical sensations, so perhaps the same would apply for a dream.</p>\n\n\n",

This is a situation of 'safek yom' which we see from the discussion in the gemoro is to be treated as yom tov. That is why we daven the yom tov prayers, have the seder, etc. Once we do that, then we consider the brochos as not a safek.</p>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a15.htm#18\">verse 18</a>, Sh'mu'el says that Sha'ul was told to destroy אֶת-הַחַטָּאִים אֶת-עֲמָלֵק:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said: Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.

This seems to put the Rambam's opinion at odds with the position of the <em>M'chilta</em> (end of <em>B'shalach</em>): ר' אליעזר אומר נשבע המקום בכסא הכבוד שלו שאם יבא אחד מכל אומות העולם להתגייר שיקבלוהו ולעמלק ולביתו לא יקבלוהו.</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Please see the sources cited in this essay </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://arikahn.blogspot.co.il/2014/02/amalek-question-of-race-updated-2014.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://arikahn.blogspot.co.il/2014/02/amalek-question-of-race-updated-2014.html</a></p>\n\n<p>\"Rambam outlines a Jewish etiquette of war: Before the military option is exercised, the diplomatic option must be explored. The opposing side should be offered a non-violent resolution that would make co-existence possible, which includes acceptance of a basic code of moral behavior based on the seven Noachide Laws, and political status of a protected minority. This offer is extended to any and all other nations, including Amalek. This teaches us that when Amalek accepts the seven Noachide laws, they lose the status of Amalek and Jewish Law no longer requires their annihilation.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, there are three possibilities for an individual born of Amalekian blood: a) maintaining his initial status of Amalekite and thus being slated for obliteration; b) accepting the seven Noachide laws and political subjugation, at which point his status becomes that of a righteous gentile; and c) full-fledged conversion.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shaar Yichud - Unity of God\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According my understanding of the <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=398\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaar Yichud</a> of Chovot Halevavot, an Eternal being must be infinite and everywhere since whatever is finite is necessarily bounded and whatever is bounded is preceded by the framework which set its boundaries, hence it cannot be Eternal, because eternal by definition means nothing preceding it. (see. ch.7 with commentaries)</p>\n\n<p>If it is so that God must be everywhere, then how are we to understand the absolute unity of God?</p>\n\n<p>We cannot say \"part\" of Him is here and \"part\" of Him is there since that contradicts the Unity of God.</p>\n\n<p>Neither can we say that He is entirely here and entirely there since that would mean 1+1=1</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Spacial location is a property of physical matter. Because of the fact that matter is finite and cannot occupy two different places at the same time, it must occupy only a specific location. G-d is not limited by that restriction and can occupy all places at once. This does not mean that different parts or different copies of Him occupy different places, but that the same G-d occupies all those different places simultaneously. Other non-material things share this curious attribute. For example, the mathematical rule that 1 + 1 = 2 holds true in all places in the universe, but it is not a different rule in each place (so that we could add them together and say there are two rules) or a different part of the rule in each place. The same rule exists in all places simultaneosly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I question your assumptions, however:</p>\n\n<p>The idea of \"parts\" does not refer to things which are arbitrarily distinct within one whole.  A rubber bouncy ball is not made of parts just because it takes up space - it is all part of the same whole, as opposed to a basketball consists of the sphere which bounces, the hollow inside which maintains its firmness, and the piece that allows the pump needle to insert air without letting air out.  Hashem is One in that He does not have one \"part\" of Him responsible for kindness, one part for judgment, one part for mercy etc., rather Hashem is one in that all these behaviors are accomplished by one distinct \"faculty.\" This is how the Ramchal describes Hashem's oneness in Derech Hashem (1:1:5) - מציאות פשוט בלי הרכבה - a <em>simple</em> existence, one that does not consist of compounding.  This is the same use of simple that is commonly used in systems - simple and complex systems.  Even if we could refer to Hashem as \"being in all places\" this would not result in \"parts\" of Him in different places, as all places would be one \"big part.\"</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your assumption that Hashem's unity means that He is in all places, Sha'ar HaYichud never states this and I do not think it is a result of his intent: there are two distinct aspects when we discuss the Creator.  One is His עצם, His \"essence,\" and the other is His מדות, His \"attributes,\" the way He interacts with the world.  Hashem's manifestation in this world, the way He interacts, is very much not singular in having no distinct parts - there are 13 distinct elements of that interaction.  (The Kuzari explains that this itself is an expression of greater One-ness, that even apparent disparity comes from one unified source.)  When we discuss Hashem being One, we are referring to His \"essence\" - there is no physical location to Hashem's \"essence.\"  All of His actions come from one cohesive plan and purpose, but the actions are split into parts, as is all of the physical world.  Hashem does not have an \"essence\" in the physical world, and from the perspective of Hashem's \"essence,\" physical existence does not exist (see Nefesh HaChaim Sha'ar Gimmel ch. 2 - עד שתוכל לומר שאין כאן שום נברא ועולם כלל רק הכל מלא עצמות אחדותו הפשוט).  The discussion of His being one and having no parts is a discussion which precedes physical existence - thus the Rambam in several places (see for example Moreh 1:73) equates Hashem's one-ness with His being non-physical.  There was never an attempt to apply the Unity that is being described to physical existence - it is a discussion of qualities and domains, not of how large or old something is.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems, that your question arises from mixing two different aspects of Hashem's qualities which is a very common confusion. Let me elaborate it based on Rambam's <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yesodei-haTorah</a>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First aspect of Hashem is what we call Hashem is One. Some of Hashem's qualities you discuss (omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, eternity etc) relate to this aspect. Those qualities are purely theoretical (mental) and can not be observed or sensed by any human means (just like mathematical infinities). I would like to explain this Oneness a little bit.</li>\n<li>It is a misunderstanding to say \"Hashem is everywhere\", as the Sages said <strong>\"He is the Makom (place) of the world\"</strong>, not the vice verse. He IS the dimensions in which anything else possibly exists. His omnipresence is not a presence per se, but it is the base for the presence of all other stuff.</li>\n<li>It is also a mistake to talk about Hashem's Eternity, as the time is an attribute of what we call \"matter\". For spiritual things (think of particles or souls) time looses its meaning (see the problem of causality). Hence the world to come is called \"the eternal Shabbos day\" - once we disconnect from matter, time \"freezes\" if you will.</li>\n<li>Same with omnipotence, as our understanding of potency implies a force being applied to an external body. Hashem is the reason for all potency (forces) in our reality, so omnipotence means \"source for potency\" not \"a lot of it\".</li>\n<li>Needless to say, omniscience is a similar confusion. As nothing can be \"external\" to Hashem, and our understanding of knowledge is an external knowledge - one knows something that is external to him, this is inapplicable to Hashem. Therefor He IS the source for all the knowledge in our reality, not actually \"knows a lot\".</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As you can see, this understanding of Hashem's Oneness is very problematic for us. Because He can not be observed and perceived with senses, He can not interact with His \"space-time-matter limited\" creations, i.g. us. Therefore creation of the spacetime limited creatures \"obligates\" a simplified, \"scaled-down version\" of Him (we can call it the Shechina, for example) that can be \"impersonated\" and treated as He was an ultimate \"space-time\" being. This is the second aspect I was talking about, that's completely different from the first one. </p>\n\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><p>In this aspect G-d is not \"exactly\" one, as we and our world do exist in parallel to Him in our perception, and there's Earth and the Heaven etc. And therefore Torah is full of G-d's \"impersonated\" qualities, such as body parts (see Rambam), feelings (see Rambam), movement, forces etc, that allow our interaction with Him.</p></li>\n<li><p>Therefore your example of \"<em>\"part\" of Him is here and \"part\" of Him is there\"</em> applies to this aspect of Him, the practical implementation of Hashem, not the \"real\" One Hashem as described in #1-5.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I should admit, that this differentiation is not clear from Rambam's writings or all others and it took me some time to realize it, but once you grasp this idea you can clearly see, when Hashem is addressed in His unity and when in His \"spacetime\" implementation.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it helps.</p>\n\n\n",

The question arises when whisky has been matured in wine casks, such as the Macallan Sherry Oak. R’ Moshe Feinstein famously addresses this issue in 2 responsa: Igros Moshe YD 1:62-63. While the Shulchan Aruch (YD 134:13) forbids drinking a gentile’s beverage when it is customary to add non-Kosher wine to it, R’ Moshe follows the more lenient Rema. Providing the wine is nullified against 6 parts whisky (as opposed to the usual 1:60 ratio), the wine is Kosher. While R’ Moshe advises that a baal nefesh should best avoid such whisky, seemingly he was specifically referring to a scenario where wine had actually been added to whisky. As Scotch Whisky Regulations dictate that Scotch may only contain water, grain yeast and caramel colouring, we can be assured that wine is not added.</p>\n  \n  <p>Many American Poskim are concerned that as the entire sherry (or port, Madeira, etc.) cask is saturated with non-Kosher wine, the wine is no longer battul 1:6 in the whisky. Others, including R’ Akiva Niehaus (Sherry Casks, A Halachic Perspective) argue that R’ Moshe wasn't referring to Scotch, but to American or Canadian whiskey. Accordingly, they forbid Wine Cask Finishes, arguing that the wine adds a recognizable taste to the whisky.\n  Nonetheless, Rabbanim in the UK (including the London Beis Din) maintain that R’ Moshe’s rulings apply to Scotch, and follow Dayan Weiss’s permissive ruling, too (Minchas Yitzchak 2:28).</p>\n  \n  <p>Note, that distilleries outside of Scotland (including Ireland) are not bound by the same regulations, and their whiskies may be problematic. Thus one must consult their Kashrus authority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein was addressing blended whiskey, but the issues are basically the same with regards to a sherry-cask scotch as far as I know.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Feinstein said it was allowable, but not preferable; he personally made reasonable attempts to avoid such a product (as a <em>chumrah</em>) , and gave his blessing to those who would make a product certified as free of non-kosher wine. So authorities such as the cRc and Star-K who don't recommend \"sherry-finished scotches\" are following Rabbi Feinstein. They're not necessarily saying they're certifiably <em>not kosher</em>, just that they're not endorsed.</p>\n\n<p>The Star-K's position, for instance, is if it says on the label \"this contains sherry\" (in one language or another), then they don't recommend it. If you don't know, then you can rely on its permissibility if it happens to be there.</p>\n\n\n",

As a Noachide when we attend the local 'Temple' which is unaffiliated with any sect, I should not wear a kippah as it may cause someone to mistake me for being Jewish. I just wear normal clothing (modest) as does my wife but how should I cover my head in shuls? </p>\n\n<p>One source says in Noachides should wear a headcovering that s different such as a turban maybe or an Islamic style kufi. I am no good at turbans and I really would not like to wear a kufi if at all possible and be mistaken for a Muslim. What is something practical I can wear? Am I allowed a modest style hat in shuls? Or does it need to be a particular style of hat to be 'halachic' for noachides?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Because the Noahide phenomenon -- the practice of identifying onesself as a Noahide as a religion in itself rather than converting -- is fairly recent,  there is not yet a large body of halachic literature on what Noahides should do. </p>\n\n<p>However, there are some Orthodox rabbis who have written books about Noahides (some are only available in Hebrew), some rabbis who have published a siddur for Noahides, called Service of the Heart, and other rabbis who have advised or otherwise helped or supported Noahides or their organizations. I recommend contacting these rabbis and asking them what you should do about head coverings. </p>\n\n<p>This is not related to your question, but given your comment about the Temple, I should mention that they would probably tell you not to attend a non-Orthodox synagogue.</p>\n\n<p>It is normal and accepted for non-Jews visiting synagogues to wear a kippa while in the building (see this thread: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14679/should-one-ask-a-non-jew-attending-synagogue-to-wear-a-yarmulke\">Should one ask a non-Jew attending synagogue to wear a yarmulke?</a>).

But in this scenario does he have to stop his meal at <em>Tzeis HaKochavim</em> (which is presumably when the time for saying Shema begins) and appoint a shomer?

    "content": "# May one eat eggs purchased on Passover?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is a common practice for people to buy their Pesach eggs in advance of Pesach. I've seen different reasons for this, including: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The popular notion that some <em>chametz</em> might somehow get into the egg, and therefore the egg must be owned by a Jew in advance of Pesach when the <em>chametz</em> in the egg is nullified (<em>batel b'shishim</em>). A possible means for <em>chametz</em> getting absorbed into the egg is discussed and dismissed by R' Moshe Feinstein, although he recommends requiring people to clean the outside of their eggs before cooking (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=919&st=&pgnum=365\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Igros Moshe</em> OC vol. 3, § 61</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>The concern of benefiting from an animal derivative whose creation is partially due to <em>chametz</em> that the animal may have eaten during Pesach, as chicken feed typically includes some of the five types of grain that can become <em>chametz</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>If an egg is stamped, the ink sometimes includes grain-derived ethanol. To quote the <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-thirst-highspirits.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star-K website</a>: \"Most authorities are of the opinion that alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, which is derived from wheat, barley or rye, are chometz gamur, and a person must not own these products on Pesach (<em>Mishna Berurah Orach Chaim</em> 442 <em>Shaarei Teshuva</em> ibid.\n).\" According to the <a href=\"http://www.kosher.org.uk/article/pesach-faqs-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">London Beth Din</a>, such eggs can be permitted on the grounds that any trace of ethanol in the ink evaporates immediately after stamping.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The second point above is discussed by <em>acharonim</em>, mostly with respect to milk. A major point of debate is whether <em>zeh vazeh goreim</em> (something whose existence results from both prohibited and permissible causes) is permissible when one of the causes is forbidden <em>chametz</em> on Pesach. For example, the <em>Magen Avraham</em> (OC 445:5) rules it is forbidden, while the <em>Nishmas Adam</em> (vols. 2-3, § 119:9) permits it (and in fact permits drinking such milk on several grounds<sup>1</sup> and implies that <em>zeh vazeh goreim</em> exists even if an animal's diet is exclusively <em>chametz</em><sup>2</sup>). In the case of eggs, <a href=\"http://www.pelheat.com/Chicken_Feed_Pellets.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">commercial chicken feed</a> generally consists of both grain and non-grain ingredients, so presumably there are two <em>gormim</em> present.</p>\n\n<p>There is additional reason to be lenient with the milk of animals owned by non-Jews, as non-Jews are not subject to the prohibition against owning or benefiting from <em>chametz</em> on Pesach (see <em>Beis Efrayim</em> OC, end of responsum 35).</p>\n\n<p>While there seem to be strong halachic similarities between eggs and milk, I found only limited explicit discussion among the <em>acharonim</em> regarding eggs purchased on Pesach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Assume a Jew purchases eggs on Passover that were from a farm owned by non-Jews. Are there contemporary <em>poskim</em> that rule on whether a Jew may eat the eggs, and, if so, what do they say? Does it make a difference if it is <em>sha'as had'chak</em> (e.g. a person would have a very limited diet without those eggs, and his health may be affected by abstaining)? Does it make a difference whether the eggs are purchased during the first half of Pesach (or so), when they were most likely laid before the holiday?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub><sup>1</sup> One ground for leniency presented in the <em>Nishmas Adam</em> appears to be a novel ruling that milk from a kosher animal cannot technically become forbidden even via a single <em>goreim</em> due to the general <em>g'zerias hakasuv</em> permitting milk of kosher animals. If so, this reasoning might be extended to eggs based on the <em>Behag</em> (§ 67, see also § 63) and <em>Tosafos</em> (<em>Chullin</em> 64a, second s.v. <em>she'im rikmah</em>) who appear to say that a similar <em>g'zeiras hakasuv</em> exists for eggs.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sub><sup>2</sup> He considers the animal itself to be one of the <em>gormim</em>. R' Moshe Feinstein (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=916&st=&pgnum=249\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Igros Moshe</em> OC vol. 1, § 147</a>), in a complex <em>p'sak</em> that does not entirely rely on <em>zeh vazeh goreim</em>, permits drinking milk that was produced on Pesach even if the animal's diet consists solely of <em>chametz</em>. Rather than assume that the animal is a <em>goreim</em>, R' Moshe rules that even <em>echad goreim</em> is permissible in the case described.</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://shut.moreshet.co.il/shut2.asp?id=139305\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Avraham Yosef</a> says it is permitted L'chatchila to buy eggs on Pesach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I saw that <a href=\"http://kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=51745&highlight=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Abadi</a> said you may buy eggs on Pesach.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The KLBD (Kashrut Department of the London Beth Din) rules unequivocally - <a href=\"https://www.kosher.org.uk/article/pesach-faqs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see its FAQs</a> that all eggs may be used on Pesach.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are all eggs kosher for Pesach?</p>\n<p>Regular hens' eggs, both white and brown, may be used on Pesach.

For example, if other righteous people are left alive then the first explanation must be correct - that he was taken away to atone for the sins of the generation.

The Talmud in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=17&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 17a</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ל רב לר' חייא נשים במאי זכיין באקרויי בנייהו לבי כנישתא ובאתנויי גברייהו בי רבנן ונטרין לגברייהו עד דאתו מבי רבנן</p>\n<p>Rab said to R.

It does not say that the source of their merit is <em>tzniut</em>. If anything, this passage might imply that supporting Torah for women is the equivalent to studying Torah for men.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=21&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 21a</a> we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש זכות תולה ג' שנים כו': זכות דמאי אילימא זכות דתורה הא אינה מצווה ועושה היא אלא זכות דמצוה זכות דמצוה מי מגנא כולי האי והתניא את זו דרש רבי מנחם בר יוסי כי נר מצוה ותורה אור תלה הכתוב את המצוה בנר ואת התורה באור את המצוה בנר לומר לך מה נר אינה מגינה אלא לפי שעה אף מצוה אינה מגינה אלא לפי שעה ואת התורה באור לומר לך מה אור מגין לעולם אף תורה מגינה לעולם ואומר בהתהלכך תנחה אותך וגו' בהתהלכך תנחה אותך זה העוה\"ז בשכבך תשמור עליך זו מיתה והקיצות היא תשיחך לעתיד לבא משל לאדם שהיה מהלך באישון לילה ואפילה ומתיירא מן הקוצים ומן הפחתים ומן הברקנים ומחיה רעה ומן הליסטין ואינו יודע באיזה דרך מהלך נזדמנה לו אבוקה של אור ניצל מן הקוצים ומן הפחתים ומן הברקנים ועדיין מתיירא מחיה רעה ומן הליסטין ואינו יודע באיזה דרך מהלך כיון שעלה עמוד השחר ניצל מחיה רעה ומן הליסטין ועדיין אינו יודע באיזה דרך מהלך הגיע לפרשת דרכים ניצל מכולם ד\"א עבירה מכבה מצוה ואין עבירה מכבה תורה שנאמר מים רבים לא יוכלו לכבות את האהבה א\"ר יוסף מצוה בעידנא דעסיק בה מגנא ומצלא בעידנא דלא עסיק בה אגוני מגנא אצולי לא מצלא תורה בין בעידנא דעסיק בה ובין בעידנא דלא עסיק בה מגנא ומצלא מתקיף לה רבה אלא מעתה דואג ואחיתופל מי לא עסקי בתורה אמאי לא הגינה עלייהו אלא אמר רבא תורה בעידנא דעסיק בה מגנא ומצלא בעידנא דלא עסיק בה אגוני מגנא אצולי לא מצלא מצוה בין בעידנא דעסיק בה בין בעידנא דלא עסיק בה אגוני מגנא אצולי לא מצלא רבינא אמר לעולם זכות תורה ודקאמרת אינה מצווה ועושה נהי דפקודי לא מפקדא באגרא דמקרין ומתניין בנייהו ונטרן להו לגברייהו עד דאתו מבי מדרשא מי לא פלגאן</p>\n<p>AND ANOTHER FOR THREE YEARS etc. What sort of merit? If I answer merit of [studying] Torah, she is [in the category] of one who is not commanded and fulfils! — Rather must it be merit of [performing] a commandment. But does the merit of performing a commandment protect as much as that? — Surely it has been taught: The following did R. Menahem son of R. Jose expound: For the commandment is a lamp and Torah is light  — the verse identifies the commandment with a lamp and Torah with light; the commandment with a lamp to tell thee that as a lamp only protects temporarily, so [the fulfilment of] a commandment only protects temporarily; and Torah with light to tell thee that as light protects permanently, so Torah protects permanently; and it states: When thou walkest it shall lead thee etc. — 'when thou walkest it shall lead thee', viz., In this world; 'when, thou sleepest it shall watch over' thee, viz., in death; and when, thou awakest it shall talk with thee, viz., in the Hereafter. Parable of a man who is walking in the middle of the night and darkness, and is afraid of thorns, pits, thistles, wild beasts and robbers, and also does not know the road in which he is going. If a lighted torch is prepared for him, he is saved from thorns, pits and thistles; but he is still afraid of wild beasts and robbers, and does not know the road in which he is going. When, however, dawn breaks, he is saved from wild beasts and robbers, but still does not know the road in which he is going. When, however, he reaches the cross-roads, he is saved from everything. Another explanation is: A transgression nullifies [the merit of] a commandment but not of [study of] Torah; as it is said: Many waters cannot quench love! — Said R. Joseph: A commandment protects and rescues while one is engaged upon it; but when one is no longer engaged upon it, it protects but does not rescue. As for [study of] Torah, whether while one is engaged upon it or not, it protects and rescues. Raba demurred to this: According to this reasoning, did not Doeg and Ahitophel engage upon [study of] Torah; so Why did it not protect them? — But, said Raba, while one is engaged upon [study of] Torah, it protects and rescues, and while one is not engaged upon it, it protects but does not rescue. As for a commandment whether while one is engaged upon it or not, it protects but does not rescue.</p>\n<p>Rabina said: It is certainly merit of [the study of] Torah [which causes the water to suspend its effect]; and when you argue that she is in the category of one who is not commanded and fulfils, [it can be answered] granted that women are not so commanded, still when they have their sons taught Scripture and Mishnah and wait for their husbands until they return from the Schools, should they not share [the merit] with them?</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/sotah/sotah_21.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here again, the Talmud is looking for <em>the</em> thing that would protect women, and once again instead of suggesting <em>tzniut</em> it concludes that supporting the Torah of their husbands and children is the thing. Here especially, the equivalency is apparent. The Talmud here specifically says that a (mere) <em>mitzvah</em> would not protect like Torah study does. The fact that supporting Torah study does protect, then, seems to be indicative of it's equivalency to Torah study itself.</p>\n<p>It would therefore seem that for women the equivalent of Torah study is, at least as implied in these passages, support of Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://cross-currents.com/2023/04/30/the-book-youve-been-waiting-for/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Adlerstein's take</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>IMHO, all it means is that [the Vilna Gaon] told his mother that she\nwas not in any need of the details of his pep-talk about various\nmidos.

But in some cases, the first one being in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9915#showrashi=true&v=49\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vayikra 14:49</a>, the root belongs to a word that means \"to purify.\" The Targum there translates it into the same Aramaic root as it would a word based in t-h-r.</p>\n\n<p>When a word like \"k-d-sh\" is used to mean something other than \"holy\" there are commentators who explain both the linguistic/etymological (\"separateness\") and the stylistic (as a euphemism) but I was unable to find anyone in a Mikra'ot Gedolot who comments on that pasuk in Vayikra to explain why a word which means sin suddenly means \"make pure.\"</p>\n\n<p>Is there any commentary who explains the word and its use in this way?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>s a side note (edit) if the word is used to mean \"purify\" then the Gematria of 18 makes much more sense.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch to Bereishis 39:9 understands the word חטא to be related to the word חתה, which he says means to move something from it's place.  He goes on to explain the concept of חטא with the more contextual meaning of חתה, which is to remove something from a fire, but the central concept of חטא would be to remove. This could explain the verse in Vayikra, as it is removing the impurity.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The cases where it means purify are examples of \"privative piel\", where the form חִטֵּא implies that something (sin, guilt, etc.) is being removed, as opposed to the qal form חָטָא, which implies that something (sin, guilt, etc.) is being added (or incurred).  Another example of this phenomenon is וַיְסַקְּלֵהוּ (he cleared it from stones) in Isaiah 5:2, or לִבַּבְתִּנִי (you have taken my heart) in Shir HaShirim 4:9.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=U4btePgZO0IC&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Williams' Hebrew Syntax, 146</a> for information, and footnotes there for other references.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the Ibn Ezra on Vayikra 6:19 where he says, \"THE PRIEST THAT OFFERETH IT FOR SIN. Ha-kohen ha-mechatte (the priest that offereth it for sin) means the kohen who sprinkles the blood. Ha-kohen ha-mechatte is another way of saying the kohen that removes the sin of the sinner. *The word mechatte literally means “removes sins.” Many of the commentaries say that ha-mechatte means who washes or cleans. The word techatteni (purge me) in Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean (Ps. 51:9) is similar.</p>\n<p>Also look at the Malbim on the same pasuk where he says that it refers to sprinkling \"כבר אמרנו (בסימן הקודם) שפעל 'חטא' בכבד מורה על זריקת הדם.\"\nAlso see Ezra 4:12 where the word יַחִֽיטוּ means to fix or repair. And see Rashi on Shemos 29:36 where Targum translates the word וְחִטֵּאתָ֙ as ותדכי AND THOU SHALT PURIFY [THE ALTAR].\nAlso compare this with Bereishis 31:39 on the word אֲחַטֶּ֔נָּה.</p>\n<p>I believe that the word חטא can be related to the word חוט-thread or cord which can be either tied or loosened. These two opposite actions are similar to sin or purity. A person becomes tied or bound to their sin until they rectify this and then it becomes loosened or removed. This could also be one of the inner meanings and symbolism of Tzitzis. See Talmud, Menachot 44a.</p>\n<p>See R. Sampson Rafael Hirsch who translates this word as \"remove\" or \"sin.\"</p>\n\n\n",

A break between 9 and 10 <em>seems</em> to make sense to me; 10 is the beginning of a multi-verse speech by God.  Why is this verse included for the fast-day reading?

Eliyahu Katz</a> has a responsum where he was asked precisely (well not <em>precisely</em>) this question!</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that on fast days we want to read the next verse because it is a consolation, and we want to break at the end of a column. For the regular Shabbat reading when the next <em>aliyah</em> will continue on anyway, it is better to stop at the point where Moses's speech ends and God's begins. On Shabbat Chol Hamoed we follow the fast day version because even though there will be more read (like on a regular Shabbat), since the <em>haftarot</em> for Shabbat Chol Hamoed speak about exile and redemption we want to emphasize Verse 10 in the Torah which alludes to that as well. In order to give it emphasis we stop the <em>aliyah</em> right there.</p>\n<p>What follows is my translation of the question and the answer, with images of the original at the end:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Regarding the Reading on Shabbat Chol Hamoed</strong></p>\n<p>To the honorable:<br>Rabbi Eliyahu Katz, Be'er Sheva may it be rebuilt and reestablished.<br>Abundant peace.</p>\n<p>There is a question that I have been uncertain about for many years, and I have not found an answer.</p>\n<p>We read in the Torah in <em>parshat</em> Ki Tisa in Chapter 34 on three occasions: 1) The weekly <em>parshah</em>. 2) On Shabbat Chol Hamoed. 3) On a public fast day.</p>\n<p>Now on a public fast day we conclude with Verse 10, אשר אני עשה עמך, even though it is the middle of a speech, because they instituted to stop there. But on Shabbat Ki Tisa we stop with Verse 9, וסלחת לעוננו ולחטאתנו ונחלתנו (the sixth <em>aliyah</em>), because that is the end of Moses's speech and then begins the words of God.</p>\n<p>But on Shabbat Chol Hamoed the custom is to break as on a public fast day, [at] עמך, even though it is possible with ease to break at ונחלתנו which is — as mentioned —  the end of the topic. If so, why do we not parallelize the reading of Shabbat Chol Hamoed to the weekly reading of Ki Tisa?</p>\n<p>With blessing, Emanuel Wolf.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br>To the honorable Emanuel Wolf, may his light shine.<br>Peace and blessing.<br>On your question, here is my answer.<br>That which I answered, this is my assessment.<br>Let us hope that I have not erred<br>And that your bewilderment about the custom, I have removed.<br>The God of Jacob is the God of my salvation.<br>That your light should shine, this is my blessing.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>It seems that there were two customs about where to break —  either to break in the place where Moses's speech ends, with ונחלתנו, or to break at אשר אני עשה עמך which is consolation and [good] tidings for Israel that there will be wonders for them. There are also opinions that the next verse (Verse 11) [of] שמר לך has one of the letters ב י ה ש מ ו which start a column in a Torah scroll [and] therefore it is better to continue reading to the end of the column until אשר אני עושה עמך.</p>\n<p>Therefore, on public fast days they chose to decide in accordance with the custom to break at אשר אני עושה עמך because there the reading ends, and they wanted to conclude with words of consolation for those fasting and those in distress over the destruction and the [evil] decrees, that God has already promised us \"and all the people among you shall see etc.\", ans also to conclude the reading at the end of the column. But on Shabbat Ki Tisa when we [anyway] continue reading after these verses until the end of the <em>parshah</em>, we break at the place that is the end of Moses's words [namely] ונחלתנו. And afterwards the fifth [person] will go up and read the continuation.</p>\n<p>And it is possible that this reason applies on Shabbat Chol Hamoed as well, even though we continue to read onward until לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו, because on [Shabbat Chol Hamoed] the <em>haftorah</em> is about exile and redemption (on Pesach the vision of the dry bones in Ezekiel, and on Sukkot about the war of Gog and Magog). Therefore we precede and emphasize that already in the Torah there is mention of this in the verse \"and all the people among you shall see the work of God, that it is awesome, that I will do with you\" and therefore we break there to emphasize this matter.</p>\n<p>And with this I conclude,<br>Eliyahu Katz</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hZokM.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hZokM.jpg\" alt=\"Image of responsum\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tLStw.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tLStw.jpg\" alt=\"Image of responsum\" /></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.In the Hebrew, this introductory poem is an acrostic of the querant's name. </sup></p>\n\n\n",

What relevance does this have to the parsha?</p>\n\n<p>It would not have been so remarkable if these three verses were at the beginning of the section which talks about Na’aman, but when we look in the Tanach we see that these three verses are in a separate paragraph, so why was there any need to include them in the Haftorah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Absolutely nothing! The reason the three pesukim are added at the beginning is so that we don't have to add at the end.</p>\n<p>To explain, consider Shulchan Aruch, <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 284</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מפטירין בנביא מענינה של פרשה ואין פוחתין מכ\"א פסוקים אלא אם כן סליק ענינא בבציר מהכי כגון עולותיכם ספו על זבחיכם.</p>\n<p>\"We read the Haftarah from the Navi from the subject matter of the parasha. And we do not read less than 21 verses unless the topic has finished with less than that, such as [the haftarah of Tzav], עולותיכם ספו על זבחיכם [which starts in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14262&pgnum=69\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmeyahu 7:21</a> and extends to 7:34, then 8:1-3, and 9:22-23, which is less than 21 verses].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now the haftarah of Tazria, as mentioned in the question, runs from Kings Ⅱ 4:42-5:19. That is, three (seemingly) irrelevant pesukim from the end of the previous perek, about bringing loaves, and then 19 verses from perek 5.</p>\n<p>If there were only the 19 verses from perek 5, that would not yield the requisite 21 pesukim. With the three additional pesukim, the sum total is 22.</p>\n<p>Why not continue on in the story at the end? Because we end at a good place, with the kiddush Hashem. The navi had refused payment, and Naaman leaves, very impressed.</p>\n<p>It gets worse from then on... Looking at the Haftarah in English, here is the continuation, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15911\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pasuk 20 and on</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"20: And Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, \"Here my master has stopped Naaman, this Aramean, from giving, by not taking from his hand what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him and take something from him.\" 21: And Gehazi chased after Naaman; and Naaman saw him running after him, and he leaned over off the chariot toward him, and said, \"Is all well?\" 22: And he said, \"All is well. My master sent me, saying, \"Here, just now two youths have come to me from Mt. Ephraim, of the disciples of the prophets. Please give them a talent of silver and two suits of clothing. 23: And Naaman said, \"Please take two talents. And he urged him and he tied two talents of silver in two pockets, and two suits of clothing. And he gave his two servants, and they carried them before him. 24: And he came to a secret place, and he took [them] from their hands, and he deposited them in the house. And he dismissed the men, and they went away. 25: And he came and stood before his master, and Elisha said to him, \"Where are you coming from, Gehazi?\" And he said, \"Your servant has gone neither here nor there.\" 26: And he said to him, \"Did my heart not go when a man turned around off his chariot toward you? Is it time to take the silver, and to buy clothing and olive trees and vineyards and sheep and cattle and slaves and maidservants? 27:  Now Naaman's zaraath shall cling to you and to your children forever.\" And he went away from before him, stricken with zaraath, [white] as snow.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, we cannot just end at pasuk # 19 and say the topic is done, because the story absolutely does continue. And so, instead, we pad at the beginning, so that there are 21 verses, and so that we can stop in the place we desire.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R. Elishevitz (a very great Talmid Chacham from Russia who later moved to Israel about 80 years ago) in his sefer אלף המגן writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A similar question can be asked on the parsha itself which starts with the laws of a woman who gives birth. What relevance does this have to the main subject of the parsha?</p>\n<p>We can answer these questions with a parable about a soldier who returned home during his month’s furlough from the army, and who went around town boasting about the certificate that he carried with him testifying to his bravery, because once several of the enemy attacked and tried to take away his company’s standard (guidon/pennant), and had they succeeded it would have been a great source of shame to the company. But he managed to fight them all off and defend the standard, and hence his certificate of bravery.</p>\n<p>After a few days another soldier arrived on furlough, and he too boasted about the certificate that he carried with him testifying to his bravery, because he once went over to where the enemy were and successfully stole their standard after attacking several of the enemy, causing them great shame. Clearly the feat of the first soldier paled into insignificance compared to the feat of the second soldier!</p>\n<p>These two soldiers are the parsha and the Haftorah. The job of the woman is to raise her children to serve Hashem so that the afflictions mentioned in the rest of the parsha never come upon them. This is like the first soldier, who was able to defend but not attack.</p>\n<p>But the beginning of the Haftorah shows the greatness of the prophet who taught Torah to Yisrael and who taught and sustained many students. Not only is one such as him able to defend against afflictions, but he is even able to cure them as the rest of the Haftorah relates. This is like the second soldier.</p>\n<p>Thus there is a clear correspondence between the Torah and the Haftorah in their entirety, and the relevance of the first verses is now clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It sets the stage for the story afterwards. That G-d can bend and break all the rules of reality, okay big whoop. Three verses, done. You want to see what's <em>really</em> interesting?

    "content": "# Was Paltiel living with Michal sanctioned?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Michal, daughter of Shaul,  was King David's first wife.  However, after she later helped David escape from Shaul, Shaul gave her to Paltiel Ben Laish as a wife. The Talmud in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%99%D7%98_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 19b</a> has the account of how Paltiel, knowing that she was married to David, placed a sword between their beds and never consummated his marriage to her.  When she was eventually taken back by David as his wife, Paltiel wept for the loss of his mitzvah of withholding himself from her.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתיב פלטי וכתיב פלטיאל אמר ר' יוחנן פלטי שמו ולמה נקרא שמו פלטיאל שפלטו אל מן העבירה מה עשה נעץ חרב בינו לבינה אמר כל העוסק בדבר זה ידקר בחרב זה והכתיב (שמואל ב ג, טז) וילך אתה אישה שנעשה לה כאישה והכתיב (שמואל ב ג, טז) הלך ובכה על המצוה דאזיל מיניה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Was this really a mitzvah worth weeping over?  Wasn't he in constant violation of the prohibition of secluding himself with a woman forbidden to him?  Does the command of King Shaul to marry her justify this seclusion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The gemara earlier on the same page explains that there was actually a halachic dispute between King Shaul and Dovid whether Dovid's betrothal to Michal was valid, and since King Shaul held that it was invalid he married her off to Paltiel. Thus, Michal was not clearly forbidden to him.</p>\n\n<p>And as we have no way of knowing who else held like either Shaul or Dovid, we can only conjecture as to why he did not consummate the marriage but did seclude himself with her. For example, it could be that the majority of Rabbis held like Shaul, but he actly stringently according to the minority opinion with regards to the serious issue of the possibilty that she was another man's wife, but relied on the majority opinion for the less serious issue of seclusion. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the difference between sephardi and ashkenazi rituals?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was wondering about the difference between sephardim and ashkenazim. I know there is a difference in the pronunciation. What about rituals? Customs? Etc etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is a huge and unanswerable question... I'll take a stab at some general observations.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, while it's common colloquially to refer to anyone who is not Ashkenazi as \"Sephardi\", the term technically applies only to the communities of the Iberian peninsula (today Spain/Portugal) and their descendants (who ended up in places like Amsterdam, Turkey, Greece, and northern Morocco). Many other Jewish communities — for example, those of Yemen, Iran, Iraq, India, and much of North Africa — have no connection to Spain at all, and the use of \"Sephardi\" as an umbrella term often misleadingly implies that there is some unity or continuity between groups that have very little in common.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of rituals and customs: just as in Ashkenazi cultures, every aspect of Jewish life, from lifecycle celebrations to holidays to daily life, is surrounded by customs, practices, and other traditions which vary from community to community. Non-Ashkenazi groups developed unique traditions not found among Ashkenazim. For example, my own academic work focuses on the history of <a href=\"http://www.hennabysienna.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jewish henna traditions</a>. Without a specific question I can't really go into details; as an example, <a href=\"http://sephardijews.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/passover-booklet.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here's</a> a booklet I wrote for a former student about non-Ashkenazi Passover customs.</p>\n\n<p>Thus in my opinion, \"what are some Yemenite customs for Passover?\" for example, is a more manageable question that \"what are some Sephardi customs?\"</p>\n\n<p>If you can read Hebrew, a good resource for learning about different groups is a <a href=\"http://www.ybz.org.il/?CategoryID=481\" rel=\"noreferrer\">book series</a> published by the Ben-Zvi Institute on non-Ashkenazi Jewish communities in the 19th and 20th centuries; to date they've released Yemen, Iraq, Morocco, Tunisia, Iran, Libya, Ethiopia, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Algeria, and Italy, and a special volume focusing on lifecycle rituals. A good general English resource, if somewhat simplistic, is Herbert Dobrinsky's <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=9k4zHAAACAAJ\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Treasury of Sephardic Laws and Customs</a>, as is Marc Angel's <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=KMNz9oKJZAQC\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exploring Sephardic Customs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of halakha, the general halakhic paradigms of Sephardim, Mizrahim, and other groups, differed from the one that developed in the Ashkenazi world — for example, see Norman Stillman's <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=VH0-ye5jgrAC\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sephardi Religious Responses to Modernity</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This question is way too broad to really answer - as I will explain below.</p>\n\n<p>There are some \"classic\" differences between Sephardi and Ashkenazi rituals, like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Sefardi classic <strong>Sefer Torah</strong> is barrel-shaped, as opposed to the Torah-roll of the Ashkenazim.</li>\n<li>Sefardim start wearing a <strong>Tallit</strong> in shul from Bar Mitzva - or before - and Ashkenazim only after they are married.</li>\n<li>Sefardim eat legumes - <strong>Kitniyot</strong> - on Pessach, Ashkenazim do not.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm sure others will add to this list.</p>\n\n<p>But as I said, the question is too broad, as there are lots of different groups that are all called \"Ashkenazim\" - and the same for \"Sefardim\" - and each group has it's own rituals.</p>\n\n<p>Examples: \n- Ashkenazim only wear a Tallit after marriage, yet Yekkes (who originate from Ashkenaz = Germany) also wear a Tallit from Bar Mitzva - or even before.\n- Certain Sefardim don't eat kitniyot on Pessach.\n- Some Sefardim do not use the barrel-type Sefer Torah. </p>\n\n<p>To elaborate on the sub divisions. Almost every village had its unique customs. Every country had a few sub divisions. See Wikipedia's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethnic_divisions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish ethnic divisions</a> for more details.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a sample breakdown of some obvious sub divisions - each group having unique customs and rituals - and there own Sidurim with slight changes in Nussach.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ashkenazim\n<ul>\n<li>Misnaged\n<ul>\n<li>Yekke</li>\n<li>Yeshivish</li>\n<li>Mizrachi</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Chasidish<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Ger</li>\n<li>Lubavitch</li>\n<li>Belz</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Sefardim\n<ul>\n<li>Temanim (who are not Sefardim at all)\n<ul>\n<li>Dor Daim</li>\n<li>Iqshim</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Syrian - Chalabi</li>\n<li>Moroccan</li>\n<li>Tunisian</li>\n<li>Etc. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So it's almost as broad a question as asking \"what are the differences between Asian and European etiquette.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Since purification allows one to have contact with sanctified food, it is also called sanctification. Slaughtering of offerings and eating their meat in Yerushalaim required observing special purity laws. This is why beginning with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Chagigah.2.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Chagiga 2:5</a> and untill the end of the tractate, the masekhes Chagiga is dealing with laws of <em>Tumah</em> and <em>Taharah</em> - ritual purity. The last mishnayot in perek 3 describe that, around the time of the festival, areas close to Yerushalaim observe special stringencies in handling food, clothing, etc.</p>\n<p>Purification procedures can be complex and depend on the type of <em>Tumah</em> acquired. Most sources of Tumah are described in Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.1.1-5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keilim 1:1-5</a>, there is an additional one due to swallowing an egg amount of meat of non-kosher bird <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tahorot.1.3?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taharos 1:3</a>. There are also levels of <em>Tumah</em> introduced by the Rabbis to handle the sanctified Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Chagigah.2.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 2:5</a>. For weak types of tumah purification requires immersion in a mikveh during the day and purification starts in the evening. Stronger tumah, like zav, zava, and niddah require count of the days and immersion in a mikveh. Purification procedures for metzorah are described in parashas <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.14.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzorah</a>. Purification from contact with dead body is described in parshas <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.19.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chukas</a>.</p>\n<p>The small reminders for these purity restrictions that we keep today is the custom to immerse in a mikveh before holidays and the eating of <em>karpas</em> at the Pesach Seder, which can be explained based on mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tahorot.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taharos 2:1</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Urchatz Pesach Meal\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the Pesach Seder the Urchatz is the washing of hands without a bracha.\nAt the Pesach seder our table is like the altar, so since the Kohanim should wash their hands and feet in order to serve or make offerings, is the Urchatz symbolically referring to this washing? Or does it refers to another temple ritual? I wonder how it was established and by which basis we keep the urchatz ritual at the Pesach meal. Why don't we do Urchatz at for example the weekly Shabbat meal? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Good try, but no, not that washing.</p>\n\n<p>In the late Second Temple period, it became common practice for most Jews, even non-kohanim, to try to keep all food as non-tamei as possible, as if it were <em>terumah</em> or a sacrifice. (<em>Terumah</em> -- not just bread, but even wine or oil -- would <strong>require</strong> hand-washing before consumption.) Thus, they would wash before any vegetable-dipped-in-liquid.</p>\n\n<p>Over the next few centuries, we wound up in a situation where everyone is <em>tamei</em> anyhow, but the practice of washing stayed around for the staple -- bread -- while it was relaxed for all other foods. However on Seder night, we are reenacting what it would be like in Temple times, so we wash before eating vegetables-dipped-in-liquid. </p>\n\n<p>(A carrot growing in the ground can't become <em>tamei</em> because it's attached to the ground. Pull it out of the ground, still can't become <em>tamei</em> hence no washing required. It can only become tamei once you rinse it.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does Rav Saadia Gaon say to make a bracha by Orchatz and Borei Nephashot after Karpas?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Siddur of Rav Saadia Gaon on page 136, where he discusses the Pesach Seder, he says that when we do Orchatz we are supposed to make a bracha, and after Karpas to say Borei Nephashot. However, Ashkenazim and Sefaradim do either. If to do this was the norm then, why do Ashkenazim and Sefaradim deviate, and if what they are doing is correct, why does the Rasag deviate? And if there is an inconclusive machloket, what are rationales of each side?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As explained in <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/13/158/3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav</a> the majority opinion among Rishonim is to say a bracha on washing when dipping vegetables the way we are with Karpas. Tosfos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=115&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">כל שטיבולו</a> disagrees, and therefore we don't say a blessing (as it is a safek). There is a common practice to rely on this opinion completely and not wash at all for dipped vegetables.</p>\n\n<p>So in this one, Rav Saadia Gaon is well understood. The justification for the practice of not washing is a bit harder, but it has been discussed in Achronim (see e.g. the Magen Avraham on S.A. O.C. 158 s.q. 8).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Borei Nefashos after Karpas, <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh3/1/473/17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav</a> explains that this opinion is part of a larger machlokes rishonim if the blessing of Borei Peri Ha'Adama on the Karpas is needed to include the Morror later or not - in other words is the Morror anyway exempt because it is considered part of the meal, or not.</p>\n\n<p>According to the opinion that the Morror is part of the meal and does not require its own blessing of Borei Peri Ha'Adama, then the Borei Peri Ha'Adama on the Karpas is not connected to the Morror, so the Karpas requires its own, seperate Bracha Achrona - final blessing - and cannot be fulfilled with the blessing after the meal. This appears to be Rav Saadia Gaon's opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Here again we are concerned with the other opinion, and thus not saying a blessing (at least) out of doubt. Although Rav Saadia Gaon clearly expected that a person would eat a Kezayis of Karpas (as this is the standard amount of eating), I don't know if he holds that this is a requirement. There is a practice to eat less than a Kezaiyis of the Karpas in order to not be required to say an after blessing according to all opinions.</p>\n\n\n",

The Babylonian Talmud tells us a bit about Beis Hillel -- e.g. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=28&format=pdf\">Sukkos 28a</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=134&format=pdf\">Bava Basra 134a</a> record the number of Hillel's disciples as 80 (see also Yeurshalmi Talmud, Nedarim 39b), and both sources mention two of them by name, Yonasan ben Uzziel and Yochanan ben Zakkai, identified as the greatest and least of Hillel's students, respectively. Rabban Gamliel HaZaken, the Av Beis din in the period prior to the Temple's destruction, and a grandson of Hille, would be presumably in the ranks of Beis Hillel, although he is frequently cited by his own name.  No such traditions are recorded of the members of Beis Shammai.  We do know three names of the Shammaites -- Baba ben Buṭa (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=8&daf=20&format=pdf\">Betzah 20a</a>), Dositai of Kefar Yetma (Mishna <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%91_%D7%94\">Orlah 2:5</a>), and Tzadok (Tosef., Mishna Edyos 2:2); but the Talmud mentions them only because they voted to uphold the views of Beis Hillel in contradiction to their own school.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Bava Ben Buta was a student of Beis Shammai, however he accepted the ruling of Beis Hillel </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיה שם זקן אחד מתלמידי שמאי הזקן ובבא בן בוטא שמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=8&daf=20&format=pdf\">Beitzah 20a</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A couple of days ago I came across a particular version of <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%93%D7%A8_%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Tannaim ve'Amoraim</a>.

The first two may have been added as scribal error, but potentially perhaps they were considered spiritual precursors of Shammai and his school and therefore included in the list. Presumably the second listing of Rabbi Chalafta was indeed a scribal error. Notably, though, Baba ben Buta is missing from this list.</p>\n\n\n",

They voted and Beit Shammai was the majority over Beit Hillel, and they decreed eighteen things in that day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gemara: That day was as hard for Israel as the day the golden calf was made... Rabbi Joshua Onaya taught: The students of Beit Shammai stood at the bottom [of the stairs], and they killed the students of Beit Hillel. It was taught: Six of them went up [to the attic], and the rest of them attacked them with spears and swords. It was taught: For eighteen things they decreed, and in eighteen they were the majority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Korban HaEda, this passage neither means that Beis Shammai outnumbered Beis Hillel nor that, G-d forbid, Beis Shammai members actually committed murder.  But during a number of votes, they did block the access of Beis Hillel members to the beis midrash as votes were taken.  Over centuries there has remained much dispute as to the meaning of this passage, for example the Karaites took up the passage with Rav Sadia Gaon who denied it ever happened.

Hirsch writes that the story cannot be understood like this, because then the vote would be meaningless. He explains that Beis Hillel had been refusing a formal vote, and Beis Shammai on that day gathered outside the building and forcefully prevented Beis Hillel from leaving until a vote was held. Beis Hillel were the majority, but Beis Shammai were intellectually superior, and convinced Beis Hillel on many of the issues, which were carried on Beis Hillel's vote.\nSee the Collected Writings, Vol. 5, p. 84 </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>R.

The weekly sales are significant enough that he does not want to lose the profit or halt sales for the week of Passover.</p>\n\n<p>How would an agreement with a non-Jew be structured, to allow everything to stay as is, yet still not lose the profit from sales during this time?</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking to make an \"all-or-nothing\" package deal. Sell the goods to the non-Jew at a small percent above the actual final costs after fees (say $11,000), using a small deposit. The sale is immediate with the final amount due after Passover. When the non-Jew refuses to pay the balance, he \"reverts\" ownership back to the Jew. Even though the goods were in possession of the non-Jew over Passover, he loses his profit, since he refused to pay for the all the goods.</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a loophole and I have serious Hashkafic concerns with it, but the question is a technical Halacha issue regardless. There are Jewish franchise groceries that operate as usual during Passover and have valid certificates that they did not own their Hametz over Passover. I don't know how the technical aspects are handled. This case seems similar, with the added bonus of the goods being physically off the Jew's property.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the halachic definition of a blind person?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to secular American law a person can be legally blind even if that person is able to see to some small extent. I'd like to know what the halachic definition of blindness is. Is it someone who 100% cannot see anything at all or does it follow any other parameters?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The extent of ones blindness very much depends on the context. There are discussions of the obligation of blind people in terms of positive/negative mitzvot as well as d'orayta and d'rabbanan.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi translates 'סומא' as 'סגי נהור' (Bava Kama 87b), meaning that he cannot see light. However, this is a metaphoric/stylistic phrase since it really means the opposite. It is therefore difficult to extract a precise meaning from these two words.</p>\n\n<p>Tur (Orach chaim siman 53) says that a blind person can 'yored lifnei ha'teivah', as long as he doesn't read from the Torah by heart. This suggests that such a person cannot see the words he is reading.</p>\n\n<p>Tur (Choshen mishpat siman 7): \"blind in one eye is kosher to give judgement. But blind in two eyes he is pasul\".</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch (Choshen mishpat siman 35:12): \"Blind in two eyes, even though he recognises voices and people, and his testimony matches up, pasul\".</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch (Orach chaim siman 298 seiff 13) says that a blind person doesn't make a beracha on the candle of havdalah and explains (Magen Avraham), that he needs to gaze at the light, implying that only the blessing on the fire he cannot say, whereas the other berachot he can.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara in Chagigah (2a) brings a practical difference between sight with one eye in comparison with two:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סומא באחת מעיניו פטור מן הראייה שנאמר (שמות כג) יראה יראה כדרך שבא לראות כך בא ליראות מה לראות בשתי עיניו אף ליראות בשתי עיניו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that blind in one eye is enough to exempt you from (at least) this mitzvah. It is interesting that this is for the 'reiyah' (lit. 'sight') offering. I don't know whether the gemara means that (in this case) 'as long as you have partial sight that is considered 'reiyah' for this mitzvah' or not. I am not sure whether this is applicable in all cases of סומא</p>\n\n<p>It therefore seems that there is a spectrum of blindness, ranging from partial (light) sight, without recognising letters, to sight in one eye, to no sight in either eye, etc. Each with their own status in different contexts.</p>\n\n\n",

Since any\npaper upon which G-d's name was written might be discarded and thus\n\"erased\", the Rabbis forbade explicitly writing the name of G-d,\nexcept in Holy Books, with provisions for the proper disposal of such\nbooks.</p>\n<p>According to Jewish Folklore, G-d has 70 names. However, only one of\nthese names is the ineffable name, which cannot be erased or\npronounced. Further, of the 70 names, seven may not be erased but they\ncan be pronounced on certain occasions (such as when reading the\nTorah). The other names may be erased and pronounced, but still must\nbe treated with respect. The Talmud (Shevuot 35a-b) makes it clear\nthat this prohibition applies only to seven Biblical names of G-d and\nnot to other names or attributes of G-d, which may be freely written.\nThe prohibition was later codified by Maimonides (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904982/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah,\nYesodei HaTorah 6:1-2</a>). The practice of writing \"G-d\" is supported in\nShut Achiezer, 3:32, end, where it is endorsed and accepted as the\nprevailing custom. Rambam cites Deut. 12-03:04, which states \"and you\nshall destroy the names of pagan gods from their places. You shall not\ndo similarly to G-d your Lord.\" The intent of this is to create an\natmosphere of respect for G-d's name vs pagan gods' names.</p>\n<p>As a result of this, people acquired the habit of not writing the full\nname down in the first place. Strictly speaking, this only\napplies to Hebrew on a permanent medium, but many people are\ncareful beyond the minimum, and have applied it to non-Hebrew\nlanguages. Hence, \"G-d\". One explanation is that using G-d is a\nreminder that anything which we may say about G-d is necessarily\nmetaphorical. Spelling out the Name (even in a language other than\nHebrew) would imply that one could speak meaningfully (not just\nmetaphorically) about G-d.</p>\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%22%D7%9A_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%A2%D7%98#%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A3_%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shach (Yoreh De'a 179:11)</a> ruled that \"God\" spelled in a\nforeign language does NOT have the status of a \"shem\" and thus\nmay be erased, lehatkhila.

Most of these changes were not significant, but occasionally a small change makes a significant difference. [Of the Biblical textual differences, most of them are names of places, spelling differences, ages or heights of people.]  For example, by the time we reach the flood during the time of Noah, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PeJyVMTI19cC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=let%20us%20go%20out%20to%20the%20field%20dead%20sea%20scrolls&source=bl&ots=2imKTsUE1N&sig=pjRIeQ1wModP8KQvN4B2ZW6yLNI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimzIz9jZjPAhUD-2MKHVWHDKgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=let%20us%20go%20out%20to%20the%20field%20dead%20sea%20scrolls&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the \"Official\" Torah has existed for 1,656 years, whereas other ancient versions has the world having existed for 2,242 years.</a> Any differences that were theological in nature were very rare.<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=PeJyVMTI19cC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=let%20us%20go%20out%20to%20the%20field%20dead%20sea%20scrolls&source=bl&ots=2imKTsUE1N&sig=pjRIeQ1wModP8KQvN4B2ZW6yLNI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimzIz9jZjPAhUD-2MKHVWHDKgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=let%20us%20go%20out%20to%20the%20field%20dead%20sea%20scrolls&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a></p>\n<p>But what is also true that after a certain time in history, the Torah/Biblical text stopped changing, scribal practices started conforming to each other more, and every Jewish community ended up with the same text (minus incidental spelling differences of the same words). By the time of Muhammad, every [known] Jewish community had the same Biblical text [as in any differences between texts didn't change anything theologically].</p>\n<p>But the Dead Sea Scrolls predate Muhammad, and they predate any other known Biblical texts. These Dead Sea Scrolls have shown convincing evidence of corruptions in our received text which I will show below.</p>\n<p>The version of the text that Jews have been relying upon for the past 1,000 years is called the Masoretic text. This is the \"official\" version of the Biblical text for religious Jews. Unfortunately, this \"text\" in manuscript form is only 1,000 years old. The oldest [surviving and unfortunately not complete] manuscript we have of the Masoretic text is the Aleppo Codex, which has been digitized and can be viewed/read here: <a href=\"http://aleppocodex.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://aleppocodex.org/</a> Note that there are other types of Masoretic texts, but the Aleppo Codex was used by the <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/benAsher.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, and he claimed that all [scholars] relied upon it, and this codex was treasured and highly valued by all of world Jewry.</a></p>\n<p>However, we know that the Torah is more than 1,000 years old, so what about more ancient manuscripts? Well, we didn't have any older Hebrew manuscripts [before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls], but we had other manuscripts of ancient Greek, Aramaic, Samaritan, and Latin translations of the Hebrew Bible. The problem? There were lots of differences between these translations and the Masoretic Text. For example, the Greek translation, called the Septuagint, had extra verses in the Torah, had extra books (such as Ben Sirach, Ecclesiasticus, Maccabees, etc), and had extra chapters for books like Daniel. Rabbis in historical discourses between them and Catholics said those changes were caused by the process of the translation, or due to books being included for political reasons etc. But the problem is that most times, all these different ancient translations would agree with each other, and it was only our Masoretic text that would be different.</p>\n<p>An example would be Genesis 4:8. The Masoretic text says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ח  וַיֹּאמֶר קַיִן, אֶל-הֶבֶל אָחִיו; וַיְהִי בִּהְיוֹתָם בַּשָּׂדֶה,\nוַיָּקָם קַיִן אֶל-הֶבֶל אָחִיו וַיַּהַרְגֵהוּ.   8</p>\n<p>And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice something missing? The Masoretic text states \"And Cain said to Abel....and they were in the field.\" The Masoretic text doesn't state what Cain says. But the Greek Septuagint, the Samaritan Torah, the Aramaic Peshitta, and every other ancient manuscripts have these extra words: \"And Cain said to Able <strong>let us go to the field</strong>...\" So we have instances of every older translation of the Hebrew text being in agreement, and the Masoretic text being the only one that's different.</p>\n<p>And then the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. And while they are also missing the words of Cain, there are literally thousands of differences between the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Masoretic text. And many times, the Dead Sea Scrolls agrees with the older translations we've been talking about and disagrees with the Masoretic text we have received. A good example is this question: How tall was Goliath?</p>\n<p>1st Samuel 17:4\nMasoretic Text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ד  וַיֵּצֵא אִישׁ-הַבֵּנַיִם מִמַּחֲנוֹת פְּלִשְׁתִּים, גָּלְיָת\nשְׁמוֹ מִגַּת:  גָּבְהוֹ, שֵׁשׁ אַמּוֹת וָזָרֶת.  4</p>\n<p>And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named\nGoliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to the Masoretic text, Goliath was roughly 9 feet tall, which is quite miraculous. But The Septuagint, Josephus, other ancient texts and the newly discovered Dead Sea Scrolls read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named\nGoliath, of Gath, whose height was <strong>four</strong> cubits and a span.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goliath has shrunk from 9 feet tall to 6'9; which is definitely impressive...but not miraculous. So with the Dead Sea Scrolls we have strong corroborating evidence that our received Masoretic Text is corrupt with how tall Goliath was. And yet Jews disregard this very strong evidence and continue to teach their kids that Goliath was a 9 foot tall giant, when the reality is that he was probably about 6'9.</p>\n<p>Another famous example of where ancient translations and the Dead Sea Scrolls agree against the Masoretic text is Psalm 145, known as Ashrei, which is recited every Shabbat. The Psalm is an Acrostic, with every line beginning with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet, except for the letter Nun. The Babylonian Talmud discusses this:</p>\n<p>Berakhot 4b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But [Psalm Psalm 145 is selected] because it contains both features.\nR. Johanan said: Why is there no verse beginning with the letter Nun\nin that Psalm ? Because it would refer to the downfall of Israel's\nenemies; as it is written, \"Fallen (Naphelah) is the virgin of Israel,\nshe shall no more rise\" (Amos v. 2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the Septuagint, Peshitta, Vulgate, and Dead Sea Scrolls are in agreement that there should be a line with a Nun, and here it is:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0e21v.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0e21v.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n\"Faithful is the LORD in all His ways, and merciful in all His works\" (Hebrew: \"נאמן אלוהים בדבריו וחסיד בכל מעשיו\").</p>\n<p>But what about examples where all the older manuscripts agree, but we didn't find a copy of it in the Dead Sea Scrolls? Well, we have an example that appears to be a clear case of textual corruption:</p>\n<p>Masoretic Text: 1st Samuel 13:1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א  בֶּן-שָׁנָה, שָׁאוּל בְּמָלְכוֹ; וּשְׁתֵּי שָׁנִים, מָלַךְ\nעַל-יִשְׂרָאֵל.   1</p>\n<p>Saul was one years old when he began to reign; and two years he\nreigned over Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We all know that Saul had to be more than a year old when he became king, and we know that he reigned for more than 2 years. Yet Jewish tradition explains away these discrepancies rather than try to discuss possible corruptions. Take a look at Rashi's attempts to gloss over the textual corruption on that verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Saul was a year in his reign: (lit., a year old.) Our Rabbis of sainted memory said: Like a one year old, who did not experience the taste of sin (Yoma 22b). It may also be interpreted thus: Saul was a year in his reign, i.e., in the first year in which he was made king (and he reigned two years over Israel), and in the first year...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And yet the Septuagint, Vulgate, and every other ancient text has this text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign; and forty two years he\nreigned over Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately we didn't find a copy of the Dead Sea Scrolls that contains this verse, but considering our other examples thus far, it would more than likely match this text.</p>\n<p>All of these examples thus far have shown differences of little theological importance, so let's show one that has big implications.\nDeuteronomy 32:8\nMasoretic Version:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ח  בְּהַנְחֵל עֶלְיוֹן גּוֹיִם,  {ס}  בְּהַפְרִידוֹ בְּנֵי אָדָם;  {ר}\nיַצֵּב גְּבֻלֹת עַמִּים,  {ס}  לְמִסְפַּר בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל.  {ר} 8</p>\n<p>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when He\nseparated the children of men, He set the borders of the peoples\naccording to the number of the children of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dead Sea Scrolls:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ח  בְּהַנְחֵל עֶלְיוֹן גּוֹיִם,  {ס}  בְּהַפְרִידוֹ בְּנֵי אָדָם;  {ר}\nיַצֵּב גְּבֻלֹת עַמִּים,  {ס}  לְמִסְפַּר <strong>בְּנֵי אֱלֹהִים</strong>.  {ר}   8</p>\n<p>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when He\nseparated the children of men, He set the borders of the peoples\naccording to the number of the \"children of Elohim\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So while the Dead Sea Scrolls prove that there was a lot of differences in the Biblical text, we stop seeing these kinds of large changes after the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Dead Sea Scrolls are dated to be written around 100-300BCE, but after that, the texts seem to be much more fixed and stop having any relevant differences. Maybe the scribes got more oversight, or were better at their craft. Maybe differing manuscripts were destroyed or lost to history with the destruction of the Temple and therefore could no longer be copied or spread around. Either way, there is credibility to the claim that our text has not been a perfect transmission. But most of the \"changes\" wouldn't matter religiously, to Muhammad, or to Jews.</p>\n<p>Update: Some have brought up the point that most of the changes I brought up are not from within the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. I originally did not do a deep dive just in the Torah as not to drive up a lot of contention. But since there are those amongst you that believe that the Torah changes are not significant I will provide more evidence.</p>\n<p>35% of the scrolls found in the DSS collection are supposedly mostly masoretic in their tradition, then 5% align more with Samaritan, and another 5% aligns with the Septuagint (which takes from both Masoretic and Samaritan and other variants). The rest of the DSS variants don't align with another living tradition.</p>\n<p>Here are some differences between our Jewish Torah, and the Samaritan Torah, both of which are attested to in the DSS.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Samaritan Torah also offers a slightly different version of some\nstories. It includes parts of dialogues that are not found in the\nMasoretic text: For example, in Exodus chapters 7 through 11, the\nSamaritan Torah contains whole conversations between Moses, Aaron, and\nPharaoh that the Masoretic text does not.</p>\n<p>The other differences that are significant in narrative sometimes\nchange the story, and sometimes “fix” small sentences that appear\nincoherent.</p>\n<p>In Exodus 12:40, for example, the Masoretic text reads: “The length of\nthe time the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years,” a sentence that\nhas created massive chronological problems for Jewish historians,\nsince there is no way to make the genealogies last that long. In the\nSamaritan version, however, the text reads: “The length of time the\nIsraelites lived in Canaan and in Egypt was 430 years.”</p>\n<p>Earlier in Exodus, in 4:25, the Samaritan Torah offers an alternative\nnarrative to the slightly problematic story about Moses’ son not being\ncircumcised when an angel of God “sought to kill him.” The thought\nthat Moses did not circumcise his son, as the Masoretic text states,\nseems inconceivable to many Jewish commentators, Tsedaka noted. The\nSamaritan text, however, reads that it was Moses’ wife, Tziporah, who\nhad to “circumcise her blocked heart” by cutting off her belief in the\nidol-worshiping ways of Midyan, her homeland. A mention of an\n“internal circumcision” is later found in Deuteronomy 10:16 in both\nversions, which reads, “circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and\nstiffen your neck no longer.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most variant of texts within the two Torahs is the\ndifferences in the Ten Commandments.</p>\n<p>“The Commandments are all in the form of ‘do’ and ‘don’t do,’ ”\nTsedaka asserted. “The Masoretic version includes the intro of ‘I am\nyour God that took you out of Egypt,’ as a commandment, when we see it\nas an introduction. Our Ten Commandments start later, and we have our\nlast commandment to establish Mount Gerizim.”</p>\n<p>While an “extra” commandment to establish an altar on Mount Gerizim\nmight seem random in the Masoretic text, the part that follows the Ten\nCommandants in the Masoretic version talks about the forbidden action\nof building stairs to an altar. Some scholars believe that the\nMasoretic text would not be discussing steps to an altar without\ntalking about an altar first, and so some believe there might be a\npart of the text that is missing in the Masoretic version.</p>\n<p>“Finding the Dead Sea Scrolls proved that there were two versions, if\nnot more, of the Torah circulating within Judaism, but they were all\ndealt with with equal validity and respect,” said Ulrich, who served\nas one of the chief editors on the Dead Sea Scrolls International\nPublication Project. “The Samaritan Torah and Masoretic Torah used to\nbe studied side by side. The Masoretic text wasn’t always the\nauthoritative version. They were both seen as important during the\nSecond Temple time period.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/belief/articles/the-other-torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/belief/articles/the-other-torah</a></p>\n<p>And so the question of whose Torah is the correct one and which one has been changed is an open question. Most of the DSS match our Masoretic tradition, this proves nothing other than our tradition was the most popular for the Essene Community at that time. But that doesn't explain why they also preserved all the other traditions. More than likely the reason the Essenes preserved all these texts is because they could not prove which is the original, and therefore value comes from studying and understanding all of them. Much like even the Christian Scriptures quote books like Enoch/Jubilees, discuss them as being good to study, while also not officially canonizing the books.</p>\n\n\n",

My impression is that the term \"Jew\"/\"Yehudi\" is used today because the descendants of the Kingdom of Judah are all that remain after the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians, but does it retroactively apply to earlier Israelites who were not of the kingdom or tribe of Judah? For example, I'll often see people refer to Moses as a Jew, but if you had asked Moses if he was a <em>Yehudi</em>, he would have said no, right? So, rather than asking a direct semantic question to this forum, let me ask:  Are there any rabbinic sources that refer to the Children of Israel before the Assyrian captivity as Jews?  If not, what terms did the sages use to describe the people of that era?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The following is taken from the encyclopedia אוצר ישראל Vol. 5 by R.

And so too Yosef was referred to as “a Hebrew youth” (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0141.htm#12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 41:12</a>), and Jonah the Prophet said “I am a Hebrew” (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1701.htm#9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yonah 1:9</a>), and it says “And the Philistines said: Behold the Hebrews are coming out of the holes in which they hid themselves” (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a14.htm#11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel Ⅰ 14:11</a>).</p>\n<p>The sons/tribes of Yaakov/Yisrael and their descendants were called  בני ישראל - the Children of Israel. And after the Bnei Ephraim who were the ten tribes separated from the kingdom of the House of David in the days of Rechav’am ben Shlomo, and only the Bnei Yehudah and the Bnei Binyamin remained under his rule, the were called יהודים after the tribe of Yehudah who were the main group, and after the name of the land ארץ יהודה (the Land of Yehudah) in which they dwelt. And just as the offspring of Ephraim were called אפרתי, so too were the offspring of Yehudah called יהודי. And after the exile of the ten tribes only the descendants of Yehudah and Binyamin remained in Eretz Yisrael, and they were called יהודים and their language was called יהודית as in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1036.htm#11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 36:11</a>. And even after they too were exiled they were thus called.</p>\n<p>Mordechai who was from the tribe of Binyamin was also called “איש יהודי” (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3302.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 2:5</a>). In the writings of Chazal, the name Yehudi denotes not just a person’s Jewish roots, but also a person who only believes in the God of Israel, and R. Yochanan taught: Really, Mordechai came from Binyamin, so why did they call him Yehudi? Because he repudiated idol worship, because anyone who repudiates idol worship is called a Yehudi (<a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=megilah&daf=13a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 13a</a>).

Because she denied idol worship.</p>\n<p>However, in the Gemara and Midrashim Jews are still called by their old name ישראל or בן/בת ישראל, and only if the quote from foreign sources do they mention the name Yehudi. In the Gemara all customs which are to do with modest behavior which the daughters of Israel were accustomed in, even though they are not explicitly written in the Torah, are called  דת יהודית (<a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=kesuvos&daf=72a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesuvos 72a</a>).</p>\n<p>The word \"Yehudi\" was in former times was considered a term of insult when used by non-Jews, and therefore if they did not wish to insult a Jew they would call him a Hebrew or Israelite. Even now the name Zhid/Yid or Jude or Jew is considered an insulting term in many countries, but Jews in the enlightened countries try to make the name Jew a pleasant term, and many of the sages of the Jews use this name in reference to themselves.</p>\n<p>Those who write about the history of the Jews use the term \"Hebrew\" up until the time of Yaakov, and the name \"Yisrael\" from the time of the twelve tribes until the destruction of the first temple, and from then on they use the name \"Jew\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

From the smallest sub-atomic particle to the largest galaxies in outer space. Each instance, every element is only in existence because of it's life force from G-d. Reshoim included.</p>\n\n<p>The question you really need to ask is if everything in existence is only existence because of the life force from G-d, how can there exist bad things, suffering, and entities that go against G-d and deny G-d's existence?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the shaar bitachon of Chovos Halevavos <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=380#ch3\" rel=\"nofollow\">chapter 3</a> - all human beings including non-jews.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Four: He watches over and directs the lives of <strong>all men</strong>, He does not\n  abandon any of them nor neglects any of them . None of their matters,\n  small or great are hidden from Him, and no matter can distract Him\n  from remembering another matter, as written: \"Why should you say, O\n  Jacob, and speak, O Israel, 'My way has been hidden from the L-ord,\n  and my judgment is passed over from my G-d'?\" (Yeshaya 40:27), and \"Do\n  you not know-if you have not heard-an everlasting G-d is the L-ord,\n  the Creator of the ends of the world; He neither tires nor wearies;\n  there is no fathoming His understanding \" (Yeshaya 40:28)....)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it does not mean that a wicked person can trust that God will provide for him his livelihood as written later there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But, If one trusts in G-d and rebels against Him, how foolish is he,\n  how weak is his intellect and his understanding! For he can see in\n  this world that if an employer appoints a man to do something or\n  refrain from doing something and the man disobeys the instruction,\n  this will be the strongest factor in the employer's refusing to\n  fulfill his side of the deal. All the more so, for one who disobeys\n  the commandments of G-d, for which G-d Himself testified that one who\n  trusts in Him and disobeys Him will have his hopes foiled and his\n  trust will be considered hypocritical. Rather, he will be like that of\n  who it is written \"For what is the hope of the flatterer who deceives,\n  when G-d casts off his soul? Will G-d hear his cry when trouble comes\n  on him?\" (Iyov 27:8-9), and \"Will you steal, murder, commit adultery,\n  swear falsely, offer up to idols, and follow other gods that you know\n  not. And will you come and stand before Me in this house, upon which\n  My name is called, and say, 'We are saved,' in order to commit all\n  these abominations? Has this house upon which My name is called,\n  become a den of thieves in your eyes? I, too, behold I have seen it,\n  says the L-ord.\" (Yirmiyahu 7:9-11).</p>\n  \n  <p>(Marpe Lenefesh commentary: Even though G-d has compassion on all His\n  creations, including the wicked, as he explained earlier, even so, for\n  this, one should not think that G-d will forever tolerate him, and\n  trust that G-d will continue bestowing good to him always despite his\n  wickedness. And even though things are going well now, there is no\n  escape from His judgments, and eventually, when He wishes, He will\n  choose a time and place to collect His debt (of justice). Rather it is\n  proper for a man to endeavor to fulfill all of G-d's commandments.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>On the contrary, the most righteous people in this world often have been treated most harshly until only much later did they receive a great reward.  Look for example at Hevel whose greatest reward came after he was reincarnated to become Moshe.  But Kain and his seed were all destroyed except for his only remnant, because of her great compassion, who was Noah’s wife.</p>\n\n\n",

An example is the פרי עץ הדר being a citron. In Sefer Hamitzvos Shoresh Sheni, the Rambam explains that this was in order to \"להראות חכמת הכתוב\" to demonstrate the wisdom of Scripture.</p>\n<p>The second is discussed in the Introduction to the Yad Hachazaka.  Here he discusses derashos which are \"דברים שנתחדשו בכל דור ודור ... שלא למדו מפי השמועה\" - newly discovered in each generation, and were not learned by transmission.  In Shoresh Sheni, he qualifies that these derashos are limited to branching off of existing Mosaic laws - \"הם ענפים מן השרשים שמאמרו לו למשה\"</p>\n<p>Ohr HaChaim to Vayikra 13:34 implies all derashos are only conclusive with an independent tradition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין הכרח לדרשות הלל עד שעלה לא\"י וידע שכן באה ההלכה</p>\n<p>Hillel's derashos were inconclusive until he went up to Eretz Yisrael and knew that the tradition confirmed his conclusion (translation mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi in Pesachim 61a could be understood to mean that Chazal did not have the right to apply the rules of exegesis without a pre-existing tradition from their teachers, with the exception of Kal V'chomer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאין אדם דן גזירה שוה מעצמו אלא אם כן למדה מרבו, אלא קל וחומר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi contrasts Kal V'Chomer with Gzeira Shava as being allowed.

Rambam specifies in a responsum (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1731&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">159</a>) that the mitzvah is affixing it to the bicep, while further wrapping is just to \"complete the knot\" but doesn't sound mandatory:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קשירת הרצועה על האצבע היא אחרי הברכה ובה תהיה קשירה תמה ואין הקשירה על האצבע מוכרח</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh</a> too writes that wrapping the strap around the arm\"is not part of the mitsvah of tfillin) (responsa klal 3, ch. 2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כריכת הרצועה סביב הזרוע אינה ממצות הנחת תפילין </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, it appears that the wrapping around the hand/finger is not part of the mitsvah either, based on his context there.

Here is a very loose translation/summary of what he writes there.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a patient refuses to take (life-saving) medicine, it depends on\n  <em>why</em> he is refusing. If he still believes that he could be healed by this doctor, but is reluctant to do something which is painful for\n  him, which is a מעשה שטות ומעשה תינוקות, a juvenile/stupid thing to\n  do, then we force the patient to take the medicine, as much as we are\n  able to.<br>\n  However, if he does not think that this doctor will be\n  successful at healing him, then we have to find doctors that he\n  believes will be effective at healing him. But if there are no doctors\n  who the patient thinks will be effective, or if it is impossible to\n  make the patient understand that what we are doing is for his benefit,\n  then we force him to take the medicine, so long as all the present\n  doctors feel that this is beneficial for him.  </p>\n  \n  <p>However, the only cases where we force a patient to pursue healing are\n  those where the patient will not become upset (שלא יתבעת מזה); for if\n  the patient should get upset, this can be be harmful, even\n  life-threatening. Thus, in those cases, it is better to do nothing.<br>\n  Therefore, in every case where there is a patient that is unwilling to\n  undergo treatment, all of these variables need to be weighed\n  carefully, before forcing treatment on a patient; the only time\n  doctors should force treatment on a patient is when they do so לשם\n  שמים, with good intent.</p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, if there is any amount of סכנה, danger, in the pursuit\n  of this treatment, even if the doctors usually administer this\n  treatment, because the illness is more dangerous, the patient cannot\n  be forced into treatment.</p>\n  \n  <p>With regards to administering a treatment that is dangerous, but the\n  danger of the illness is still greater (i.e., in general, and not in a \n  case where the patient is refusing treatment) -- one should not always\n  administer this treatment, because even if the treatment was proven to\n  be safe <em>for healthy people</em>, there isn't necessarily proof that it's\n  safe for a very ill patient. A potentially dangerous treatment should\n  <em>never</em> be administered, unless there is proof that <em>more than half</em> of the people who are sick with this illness, to the degree to which\n  this patient is sick, have recovered from their illness.<br>\n  This calculation must be done carefully, because it is hard, even for very\n  great doctors, to calculate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the halacha in this case, according to Rav Moshe, is dependent on many factors -- the mindset of the patient, the chance of recovery, and the danger of the illness and the treatment. As with all halacha questions on Mi Yodeya, it's best to ask a knowledgeable rabbi for a final ruling.</p>\n\n\n",

I don't recall ever before seeing this book cited in an halachic discussion, and very rarely in a Jewish context at all. I wonder: What is its status? Specifically, (1) is it considered reliable<sup>[1]</sup> as a source of Jewish wisdom and outlook, and (2) can its pronouncements be used<sup>[1]</sup> to decide <em>halacha</em>?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[1] </sup>When I say \"reliable as a source\" and \"can be used\", I mean that the entire book is reliable or can be used. I do see that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiasticus#Influence_in_the_Jewish_doctrine_and_liturgy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> says that the <em>Bavli</em> quotes from <em>ben Sira</em>, but that may possibly be isolated excerpts that are considered valuable even if the book as a whole is not.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Ben Sira was a matter of dispute in the Talmud if it may be studied.</p>\n<p>Rebbi Akiva includes in the Mishna's list of those who have no portion in the world to come (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_90.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 90a</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר\"ע אומר אף הקורא בספרים חיצוניים</p>\n<p>Also someone who reads external books</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_100.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">100b</a>) quotes the opinion of Rav Yosef:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בספר בן סירא נמי אסור למיקרי</p>\n<p>It is also forbidden to read Ben Sira</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Abaye then questions what about the works of Ben Sira is objectionable, and cites a long list of possibly objectionable teachings of Ben Sira, all of which he finds parallel to in words of Chazal, until he finally finds a statement which is objectionable - Rashi explains the objection as follows (s.v. לא יכלי ליה)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל הני דברי רוח</p>\n<p>This is all nonsense</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara concludes with the statement of Rav Yosef:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מילי מעלייתא דאית ביה דרשינן להו</p>\n<p>The positive ideas in it, we expound</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>on which Rashi comments (s.v. דרשינן)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כלומר אמרינן להו בפרקא ומשמעינן להו לכולי עלמא</p>\n<p>Meaning, we say them in public discourse and teach them to the public</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this discussion, it seems that even Abaye, in his defense of the book of Ben Sira, is only because of external validation of it's ideas.  By implication,however, he finds all of the other ideas valid, and therefore one could draw on them.  Rav Yosef seems to maintain that there are objectionable ideas in the book, but if you happen to know which ones are valuable ideas, you can teach them.</p>\n<p>The Talmud does cite Ben Sira in various places (ex. <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Chagigah.pdf#page=48&zoom=auto,0,645\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagiga 13a</a>), seemingly validating it, however those could conform to Rav Yosef's conclusion that if you know it you can teach it.</p>\n<p>So as a reliable source of Jewish wisdom, it seems that it does not qualify.</p>\n<p>As far as halacha is concerned, it would be difficult to imagine why it would be more independently reliable for halacha, and it is not explicitly quoted in Sha\"s in a halachic discussion.  Rashi in Eruvin 65a s.v. בצר אל יורה attributes a seemingly halachic statement to Ben Sira</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב כל שאין דעתו מיושבת עליו אל יתפלל משום שנא' בצר אל יורה</p>\n<p>Anyone who is unsettled should not pray, as it says \"in sorrow do not shoot\"</p>\n<p>Rashi: ושמא בספר בן סירא הוא</p>\n<p>Maybe this is in the book of Ben Sira</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosefos offers alternative explanations of the source.  However, this statement is not codified in halacha, and from context of the Gemara there it seems it may be more of good advice than a statement of halacha.  Additionally, it happens to be that this sentiment is independently validated elsewhere - Berachos 31a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר אין עומדין להתפלל לא מתוך עצבות</p>\n<p>The Rabbis taught: one should not get up to pray in a state of sadness</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and would therefore fit into the aforementioned rule of Rav Yosef.</p>\n<p>So as a decider of halacha, it is at best tenuous.</p>\n\n\n",

An example would be regarding kosher: if I go to a friend's house and he serves me chicken, and he tells me it's kosher, I'm allowed to take his word for it. So if a restaurant owner is an observant Jew, must he have a kosher certificate?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I was told by R' Dovid Fink shlita that, speaking very generally, Ashkenazi poskim tend to require kosher certification, the reasoning being that the standards of kosher might be different from your own. Sefardi poskim, on the other hand, tend to consider a restaurant kosher if there is a visible observant Jew working there, exactly as you describe.

There is more than 60x as much meat cholent as there is milk, so the milk should theoretically be <em>batel b'shisim</em>. But <strong>does the fact that a non-negligible amount of milk fell into the pot</strong> (as opposed to a couple of drops into a smaller pot) <strong>change anything</strong>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rambam (MT <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/968265/jewish/Maachalot-Assurot-Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'achalot Asurot 9:10</a>) writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the milk fell into the sauce or onto all the pieces and\n  it was not known on which piece [the milk] fell he should stir the\n  entire pot so that all its contents will be mixed [thoroughly].

Generally Halacha tells about a drop of milk that falls in a pot of meat.e.g. Mishna Chullin 8, 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ח,ג  טיפת חלב שנפלה על חתיכה--אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה חתיכה, נוער <em>(יש גורסים ניער, וזה מדגיש דווקא בדיעבד ועיין ערוך השולחן סימן מ''ב סעיף ט''ז סיכום יפה של הנושא של ביטול איסור לכתחילה במקרה זה)</em> את הקדירה; אם יש בה בנותן טעם באותה הקדירה, אסור.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In such a case we must not evaluate if the quantity added by the isur leads to a gain. So the bitul is only done to avoid a loss.</p>\n<p>But when the quantity of isur actually present in the pot is valuable, e.g. it adds a piece to the meal, is it permitted to eat the extra piece of Tshulent.</p>\n<p>There is halachot about this when solid pieces of Isur are mixed with Heyter, e.g. Teruma 5, 7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה,ז  סאה תרומה שנפלה למאה, הגביהה ונפלה אחרת, הגביהה ונפלה אחרת--הרי זו מותרת, עד שתרבה תרומה על החולין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A din for Teruma, to extract the same quantity from the mixture.</p>\n<p>See Chullin 100a, see SA YD 109.1.</p>\n<h3>But here, the milk is allowed 100% because it's not able to give a perceptible taste in the meat (to prohibit we need taste of milk in the meat and taste of meat in the milk. See Chullin 111a). So, paradoxally we have <strong>allowed milk</strong> in the pot and <strong>allowed meat</strong>, even if the quantity of milk is great, there is no hanaa from bitul Isur, because <strong>no prohibited foods have ever been present</strong>. (This is different conceptually from the case in which a non Casher meat was annulled. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99726/9215\">here</a> the explanation of the Mahari Ben Chaviv).</h3>\n<p><em>See Gemara <a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A7%D7%97_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 108a</a>, and Rashi paragraph \"Amar Leh Rava\".</em></p>\n\n\n",

If you know that the person will refuse to do so, you may not give the food to begin with. Does the same apply to the bracha acharon or are we free to let people make or not make such a blessing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Poskim discuss whether there would be a prohibition of Lifnei Iver by feeding someone who will not make the appropriate blessings (before <em>or</em> after), or will eat in situations that are forbidden (for example, without washing his hands as prescribed by Halacha).</p>\n\n<p>Upon first glance, one could consider this 'one-side-of-a-river' (a registered limitation to the prohibition of Lifnei Iver, which dictates that the prohibition is only to <em>facilitate</em> (enable) a transgression, not to merely <em>assist</em> in something the sinner could have performed anyway [with the example of giving wine to a Nazir who is on the other side of the river and unable to reach the wine on his own, as opposed to being on the same side and therefore able to access it without your help]), as eating is something that people have the ability to do without you; as long as they would be able to source food of their own, this prohibition does not apply.</p>\n\n<p>However, it seems that this limitation does not apply when creating a situation which creates the desire. For example, a father may not hit his older son, because he is creating a scenario in which the son may hit his father back. In this case, the father is not <em>enabling</em> the hitting, but creating a motivation.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it would only be permitted if the person receiving the food would have eaten anyway.

In the second set of exceptions, we expect a <em>t'lisha-q'tanna</em>, and thus there must have been an <em>upgrade</em> (where a normally conjunctive <em>ta'am</em> gets replaced by a disjunctive one), and it becomes <em>munnaḥ-legarmeh</em>.  In <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.18.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2 Kings 18:17</a>, we see the expected conjunctive <em>mercha</em> before the <em>munnach-legarmei</em> (the <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/t2VBf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleppo Codex</a> has the expected <em>mercha</em> in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.36.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isa 36:2</a>).

Legarmeih is disjunctive (pausal), and the other three are conjunctive (connective).</p>\n<p>Legarmeih is always written with a vertical line after it. Unfortunately, that line serves two purposes in Tanakh: 1) indicating a short pause after a conjunctive note (usually called a \"Psik/Paseik\"), 2) indicating a preceding note that has multiple meanings is of the disjunctive type (sometimes itself called \"Legarmeih\"). Type two is used to distinguish Legarmeih from the others (as well as Shalshelet Gedola, Azla Legarmeih, and Mahpakh Legarmeih from their conjunctive doppelgängers in the three poetic books).</p>\n<p>How can we identify a disjunctive Legarmeih from a conjunctive Munach which has a pause after it? One giveaway is if the \"Munach\" in question is preceded by a Merkha. Then we know it's a Legarmeih because Merkha is the conjunctive note which serves it (like how Tevir is served by Darga). But that doesn't always work.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the Masoretes were aware of this issue and included lists in the Masorah of every Psik in Tanakh (eg. in the Leningrad Codex after each of <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Leningrad-codex-05-deuteronomy.pdf/page46-1275px-Leningrad-codex-05-deuteronomy.pdf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">T</a> <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Leningrad-codex-13-twelve-minor-prophets.pdf/page46-1275px-Leningrad-codex-13-twelve-minor-prophets.pdf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">N</a> and <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Leningrad-codex-25-mesorah.pdf/page1-1275px-Leningrad-codex-25-mesorah.pdf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">K</a>). If a line is not on that list, it must be a Legarmeih. So problem solved. The same technique can be used with the other notes above in the poetic books.</p>\n<p>As it happens (and this mnemonic is noted in many of the old grammatical works cited below <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=bIgrAAAAMAAJ&lpg=RA1-PA5&dq=William%20Wickes%20bible&pg=PA119#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">and is accepted by Wickes</a>), if you look through the lists you'll find that a \"Munach\" with a line is a Legarmeih whenever it precedes a Revi'i (except <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.42.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 42:5</a>) plus <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/71489/759\">a handful of other times</a> before other notes.</p>\n<p>A masoretic note to <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Leningrad-codex-10-isaiah.pdf/page32-1275px-Leningrad-codex-10-isaiah.pdf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 42:5 in the Leningrad Codex</a> confirms this, by noting explicitly that the line there is a Psik. A masoretic note in <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Aleppo-HighRes2-Neviim1-Joshua.pdf/page10-1240px-Aleppo-HighRes2-Neviim1-Joshua.pdf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Aleppo Codex to Joshua 9:12</a> also confirms this, as it notes the opening word appears thrice at the start of a verse with that Trop. This only makes sense if it is a Legarmeih not a conjunctive Munach, as there are more than three places that that word opens a verse with a Munach.</p>\n<p>(R Mordechai Breuer notes that in the 3 poetic books the parallel of Legarmeih-Munach-Revi'i is MahpakhLegarmeih-Munach-Tzinnor and again almost (exceptions Tehillim 68:21, Mishei 1:22) nowhere in those books do we find Munach-Psik-Tzinnor, yet MahpakhLegarmei-Tzinnor is common. A single Mesharet with a Psik apparently naturally converts to the Legarmeih.)</p>\n<p>Now, regarding the conjunctive ones:</p>\n<p>An Ilui serves three notes: Etnachta, Zakef, Zarka.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A \"Munach\" just preceding an Etnachta is an Ilui (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 1</a>:1). If the Etnachta has multiple \"Munachim\" only the last is an Ilui (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0140.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 40</a>:16).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A \"Munach\" just preceding a Zakef is an Ilui (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 1</a>:2) if it is not on the first letter of the word. If the Zakef has multiple \"Munachim\" only the last is an Ilui (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0140.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 3</a>:12).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A \"Munach\" just preceding a Zarka is an Ilui (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 1</a>:7). If the Zarka has multiple \"Munachim\" only the last is an Ilui unless the words are all monosyllabic when all are Iluyim (ex. <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0204.htm#:%7E:text=%D7%9E%D6%B4%D6%A3%D7%99%20%D7%A9%D6%B8%D7%82%D6%A3%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exo 4:11</a>). \"Munachim\" preceding a Telisha Ketana which serves a Zarka are also all Iluyim (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0217.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exo 17</a>:6) according to most, and some also include the \"Munachim\" between a Zarka and Segol. (Disclaimer: the rules of which notes serve a Zarka in general are complicated and subject to disputes and exceptions and disputes about exceptions, and this aspect of them is no different.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A Mekhurbal is found serving a Zakef either as the first of two \"Munachim\" (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0103.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 3</a>:12), or as the only \"Munach\" if on the first letter of a word (eg. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 1</a>:30).</p>\n<p>Any other \"Munach\" (such as before a Pazeir, Gershayim, Revi'i, Darga, Mahpakh, etc.) is a Munach (unless it's a Legarmeih, as above).</p>\n<p>At this point most of you are probably wondering if I'm making all this up, but you can see these rules discussed in classical grammatical works like Ibn Bilam's, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6507&st=&pgnum=77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Tam's Piyut</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44787&st=&pgnum=11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tuv Ta'am</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22118&st=&pgnum=176&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lechem HaBikkurim</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38534&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Darkhei HaNiggun</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36873&pgnum=64\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eit Sofer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6721&st=&pgnum=212\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Binyan Shelomo</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22734&st=&pgnum=124\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siach Yitzchak</a>, the Tijan, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7218&st=&pgnum=27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishpetei HaTa'amim</a>,  and more.</p>\n<p>So what do they say, you ask? Just look at their names: an Ilui goes up, a Munach stays down, and a Mekhurbal is something like <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16535/jewish/Chapter-15.htm#v=27&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrapped or twisted</a>. You already probably usually do an Ilui in the sequence \"Pashta-Ilui-Zakef\" and a Munach in the sequence \"Munach-Revi'i\". The Mekhurbal is probably the fancier sound you sometimes hear read for a \"Munach\" before a Mahpakh. (While according to the above that would be a mistake, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6721&st=&pgnum=212\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Binyan Shelomo</a> actually suggests that the tune there proves that a \"Munach\" before a Mahpakh is also a Mekhurbal not a Munach, but this is just his speculation and goes against the traditional grammarians.)</p>\n<p>Now all you need to do is to sing the right ones in the right places!</p>\n\n\n",

I don't remember the specific order in which he learned them. If he learned both versions, you can be sure his father did too. In fact, the Gri\"z stencil on Menachos does 'handel' with both Rashi's. It seems clear that the Rishonim had the csav-yad version, while the achronim had the upper Rashi. Both are good, of course; and both are important, because they were both used, each one in its own era. I personally had more gishmak in the csav-yad.

Tosfos seems to have had only the MS edition which would mean it is more authentic. There aren't any other rishonim (except perhaps the rashbo) but there is a wealth of achronim at least fifty on the otsar hachochma. I would suggest using the yad binyomin by R Elyashiv which is very well written and is often brought in the artscroll.\nThe Mishne berura in likutai halachos does not seem to use the MS edition but the standard one so that should answer your question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In most cases, you would learn the one that is on the top in the Vilna Shas.

However, for many years, the standard version was used, however different it was from the old manuscript. Therefore, I would advise on learning the first version, the one that appears closer to the top of the daf. If you want to learn more and use both girsaot, go ahead! It's great to learn any Torah.

(Interestingly, Rabbi Wieder only does this trope at the end of Ruth and Shir haShirim, but not at individual chapter breaks, and he doesn't do it at all for Eicha.)</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that the origin of the chapter breaks is Christian, and that there's no Jewish source for them, see e.g. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapters_and_verses_of_the_Bible#Jewish_tradition\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>. If this is correct, why do those who do an end of chapter trope mark these chapter breaks? If this is incorrect, where are the chapter breaks mentioned in Jewish sources?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The chapter breaks appear to stem in part from paragraph breaks in the Masoretic Text, which appear in the respective codices (Cairo, Aleppo, and Leningrad). Just like scrolls, these codices were written in columns (usually three per page, since a codex is a \"book\"). These columns contained paragraphs of verses, but the paragraphs were <strong>not</strong> indented (like modern English). Instead, the spacing between clumps of verses is what determined whether or not there were major or minor separations of thought, which is how we determine the paragraphs and chapters.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when groups of verses have minimal spacing between them, the ideas have their close connection. In the published form of the Masoretic Text (such as the <em>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</em>) the letter <strong>ס</strong> (<em>samekh</em>) will appear before the connecting paragraphs, which is the first letter of the Aramaic passive participle <strong>סתומא</strong> (determinative form), which means \"what is closed.\" </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, within the codices of the Masoretic Text, when one clump of verses did not have the close connection with the preceding paragraph(s), but were instead to be read as more independent than the preceding paragraph(s), then the these subsequent paragraphs began on their own line <em>with no attempt to minimize the spacing with the preceding paragraph</em>. Thus in the modern scholarly published form of the Masoretic Text (such as the <em>Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</em>) the letter <strong>פ</strong> (<em>pei</em>) will appear before the connecting paragraphs, which is the first letter of the Aramaic passive participle <strong>פתוחא</strong> (determinative form), which means \"what is open.\" </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wOofA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thus the Masoretic scholars developed a very simple system for paragraph divisions.</a> In English, indentation will mark the paragraph, but there is no way to group major and minor thoughts of paragraphs in English, unless further indentation occurs or by using sub-bullet statements. However, in the codices of the Masoretic Text, it is the spacing that counts.</p>\n\n<p>One excellent example from Megillot will illustrate.</p>\n\n<p>In the Song of Songs, the first paragraph of the text (1:1 - 1:4) is the major paragraph with all subsequent paragraphs in the book \"closed\" with the first paragraph -- and so the book is one big thought of \"close together\" paragraphs. However, in 8:11 there is an \"open\" paragraph break marked by the letter <strong>פ</strong> (<em>pei</em>), because in the codices of the Masoretic Text there is a distinct separation from the previous paragraph, and so the reader stops and reads the remainder of the book (8:11-8:14) as a separate thought, or coda, to the book. This coda is a shift of narration. That is, the third-person narrator takes over and closes the book with blessings upon Solomon and his beloved.</p>\n\n<p>In closing, the small letters <strong>ס</strong> (<em>samekh</em> for \"close together\") and <strong>פ</strong> (<em>pei</em> for \"open or far apart\") appear only in modern scholarly editions of the Masoretic Text so that we, the readers, will know when and where the spacing occurred between clumps of verses in the codices of the Masoretic Text, and therefore enable the reader to make the correct assessment as to where the major and minor breaks in paragraphs occurred throughout any given book. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does nullification mean something no longer exists, or just that it has no Halachic significance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><sup>[For the record, (I believe) I know the answer, but I saw someone post the question, as stated in the subject, on social media, and I am drawing it to its logical conclusion here.]</sup></p>\n\n<p>Say, for example, that someone makes a pot of Cholent on the stovetop, and, while the Cholent is at a low boil, some powdered milk, of less than 1/60 of the volume of the Cholent, is accidentally spilled into the Cholent and, because of the circumstances, it vanishes from sight almost immediately. A small amount of the Cholent is subsequently eaten, and the Cholent is refrigerated for later consumption.</p>\n\n<p>Let's now say that the chef adds some water to the Cholent, but accidentally adds too much, making it now very watery, and in order to reheat the Cholent, the chef decides it is best to bring it up to a boil and leave it uncovered to allow some of the water to evaporate, thereby thickening it somewhat.</p>\n\n<p>Somehow, another accidental powdered milk spill occurs, this time again with less than 1/60 the volume of the Cholent, but if combined with the first milk spill would now constitute more than 1/60 the volume of the Cholent.</p>\n\n<p>Do we say that it's as if the first milk spill never happened - that first bit of milk ceases to exist in Halachic reality? Or do we say that the first milk spill had no significance to the Cholent at the time of the spill, but with some liquid being boiled off and reducing the overall volume, and some more milk being added to the mixture, do we say that now the first milk and the second milk combine to take up a significant amount of the total volume and make the Cholent not kosher?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I asked my LOR and he showed me the mishnah in trumos (Perek 5 Mishnah 8) which is the original source of the machlokes. If 1 piece of chulin falls into a 100 pieces of chulin, it is batel. If a second piece of trumah falls in, then there is a machlokes as to whether it was now considered 2 in a 100 (1 in 50) and asur or 1 in 101 and batel again. This machlokes continues up through the rishonim and the Taz also mentions the machlokes. He (my rav) spoke of the situation as to why people get 18 minute matza because of the possibility of a small piece becoming chametz and being batel before Pesach and then the machlokes of chozeir v'neiur as to whether the mashehu would 'revive' and make the matza asur on Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>I found A reference in the Chazon Ish on Yorah Deah(Siman 16, Seif 3) which refers to the Shulchan Aruch Yorah Deah Siman 94.</p>\n\n<p>If a piece of meat falls into a milchig soup, we say that the milk absorbed by the piece of meat becomes batul as it comes out and new milk is absorbed. Otherwise, since milk is constantly being absorbed and replaced by new milk, eventually all of the milk would have cycled through the meat and there would be more than 60:1 that has become asur by being cycled through the meat and the milk in the pot would become asur.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if a second piece falls in, then there must be sixty times both pieces. The analogy to the drops of milk falling into the cholent. While they become batul, my LOR pointed out that all the drops that have fallen need to be added up. Otherwise, you can get drop by drop falling in and becoming batul even though there is a massive amount of milk in the cholent.</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish goes into detail as to the reasoning behind this.</p>\n\n\n",

Would that categorically permit healing on Shabbos?</p>\n\n<p>Are typical pills made of any ground material? Even if they were, would that be sufficient to prohibit, because private individuals don't grind?</p>\n\n<p>I am not interested in the Ketzos Hashulchan's similar argument to permit Refuah nowadays -that the decree is no longer applicable. I am interested in the argument that there never was a decree against treating illnesses not cured by ground herbs, a category which all illnesses may fit nowadays. </p>\n\n<p>Please provide all pertinent sources from the Gemara, Rishonim, Acharonim, and recent Teshuvos.   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Tzitz Eliezer in 8:15:15:4 suggests a novel approach to the prohibition of Refuah BaShabbos, which is prohibited so that one does not come to crush herbs on Shabbos. The teshuva is too long to translate, so here is my summary of the main points found there.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam claims that the reason it is permitted to perform certain types of Refuos is because, “They are not using herbs, and he has pain from the ailments.” The obvious question is that the Gemara prohibits standing in cold water if it is obvious that he is intending to cure an ailment, although that is not a cure which involves herbs. </p>\n\n<p>One answer might be that these ailments don’t fit the Rambam’s second criterion, that he has pain. However, this is not likely, because the guy is in pain…. Additionally, the Bach says that it is obvious that the decree of Chazal was not only on cures using herbs, but on all cures. </p>\n\n<p>A more convincing answer is suggested by Rabbi Dovid HaLevi in his monumental work, Turai Zahav. He suggests that the Rambam requires the illness to be treated commonly with herbs. The Gemaros which prohibit curing illnesses even with cures which don’t involve herbs do so because the illnesses were commonly treated with herbs. The Mishnah Berurah in 328:130 also adopts this approach, although he doesn’t mention that it comes from the Taz. </p>\n\n<p>This approach has radical implications for the laws of Refuah nowadays. Today, virtually no one crushes medicinal herbs at home (maybe for recreational use). Therefore, there may be no prohibition of Refuah nowadays at all, because all illnesses fall into the category of not being normally cured by herbs. </p>\n\n<p>However, what’s left is the Rambam’s second criterion, that it’s only permitted if the has pain from the illness. The question is why it would be prohibited if the decree against refuah isn’t applicable. Rabbi Joseph Cairo (Also brought by Rabbi Avrohom Gombiner in his beastly commentary Magen Avrohom) is his awesome Bais Yosef suggests that it’s prohibited because it’s uvdin dechol, weekday activity. Why this is uvdin dechol is a debate between authorities. The Bais Yosef himself says that the issue is that it’s a bother on Shabbos, so presumably when it’s not a bother, (like taking pills), it would be permissible even if he has no pain. The Rabbi Mordechai Yaffe, in his competition to the Bais Yosef, the Levush, says that the refuah itself is uvdin dechol, because it is a weekday activity. If so, refuah nowadays would be prohibited unless the patient is in pain. </p>\n\n<p>However, the entire heter is questionable, because although individuals don’t crush medicinal herbs, pharmaceutical companies do. The Tzitz Eliezer himself holds that because the reason of the gezairah has to do with the individual, it makes sense that Chazal’s gezairah would be based on the practice of individuals. This logic though isn’t certain, because it may be that chazal never foresaw the coming of industrial manufacturing of herbs, so they simply made their gezairah dependant on whether the illness was treated with crushed herbs, irrespective of who crushed them. The Tzitz Eliezer is somewhat vague when he addresses this issue. He just says “It is logical that it would go after the reason….”</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Contradictory Hechsherim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've noticed for some time that, especially on imported foods, there are often multiple Hechsherim, and that they sometimes contradict one another.  It might not surprise me if a foreign product were marked with a Hechsher that a certifier on the importing end were stricter about (eg., a Hechsher on the importing end might be stricter about the temperature required for wine to be considered Mevushal and put a caveat on its label warning people that it's only Mevushal according to some, although it's still Kosher, even though the Rav HaMachshir at the exporting end labeled it Mevushal).</p>\n\n<p>But I've seen many imported food products bearing Kosher for Passover certification from the Kashruth agency on the importing end, even though the Rav HaMachshir on the exporting end clearly marked the product \"Not for Passover Use\" (in the originating country's language).</p>\n\n<p>How can a Kashruth agency on the importing end certify something <em>more leniently</em> than the agent they are trusting to have done the inspection, when they themselves did not observe the food processing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There can be a few reasons for this, but predominantly, it can be one of two things:</p>\n\n<p>1) The original certifier certifies it year round, and did not do anything to certify it for passover, but the importing certifier actually did visit and make a passover run. The original packaging was left in place for the production, however.</p>\n\n<p>This especially can happen where products are imported into Israel, where in the originating country there was insufficient demand to justify a passover run, and only the import order justified it.</p>\n\n<p>2) The importing certifier reviewed the process with the original certifier and found that whatever concern lead the original certifier to not certify it for passover was not a stringency that the importing certifier holds was necessary.</p>\n\n<p>An example for number 2 would be that some certifiers require all passover ingredients to be certified, and will not rely on general industry practices, that lets, for example <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/52723/alert-the-shufra-baking-cocoa-crisis.html\">cocoa power</a>, without passover certification. Another example would be a certification that requires a Mashgiach for all passover certified productions, even if the ingredients and process are themselves not problematic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is very common on imports from Israel certified by the Edah Hachareidis. The Edah certifies only staples for Pesach use. It is very common to see Passover cookies (matza meal or the like) in Israel with multiple Passover hashgachot and an Edah stamp which specifically states \"For year round use.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# (How) can a minor sell his chametz?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Most of us who have <em>chametz</em> we don't wish to destroy (or consume) before <em>Pesach</em> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/tags/selling-mechirat-chametz/info\">sell it to a non-Jew</a>; after <em>Pesach</em>, he usually will sell it back to us instead of settling in cash.</p>\n\n<p>It's well known from the rules of the <em>arbaa minim</em> (<em>lulav</em> et al. that we use on <em>Sukos</em>) that a minor cannot transfer property. (This comes up on the first day of <em>Sukos</em>, when the one using the <em>arbaa minim</em> must own them in order to do the <em>mitzva</em>. An adult can't give the <em>minim</em> to a minor to own and expect them back, since a minor can't give anything away.)</p>\n\n<p>What, then, can a minor who owns <em>chametz</em> do before <em>Pesach</em>, if he doesn't want to consume or destroy it? That is, what advice have rabbis given over the years, or what have such minors done over the years? And what does such a minor do, in practice, today? I'd even be interested in theoretical answers — what such a minor <em>could</em> do — if well-reasoned or, especially, sourced.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Generally everything a child owns a father owns, so the father is selling his own Chametz on Pesach. For someone without a father, ר\"ל, a Katan has an אפוטרופס - a guardian appointed to him to deal with his property, and he can execute the sale.</p>\n\n<p>If there is no such guardian, or if he is unable to sell the Chametz, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4175&st=&pgnum=313&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Gedalia Felder</a> discusses at some length if there is any issue with the Chametz after Pesach, and finds only one opinion that there is, and many opinions that there is not. There are several cases he discusses situations where there is no non-Jew to sell the Chametz to (the local authority forbids it) or other extenuating circumstances even giving it to the minor in the first place is an option.</p>\n\n<p>So from this it would seem that in a case where there is no guardian, there would be no issue with the Chametz, and thus no real need to sell it, as that would be an extenuating circumstance. Perhaps it would be worth it to go through a \"sale\" for the purpose of Chinuch, but that is another question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I doublechecked with my LOR and he confirmed what I had thought. A katan cannot sell property. If he has a father, his father would own all the chametz and sell it. If he is, chas veshalom, an orphan, then he will have an apitropos who will sell the chametz for him. We see a basis for this in Maseches Sukkah were a person cannot give a lulav to a katan (al mnas lehachzir) because the katan cannot give it back. On the other days of succos, one can lend the lulav to the katan because it does not have to be shelo.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Basically, it is definitely possible for a katan to own chametz and it would not belong to his father. For example, if he receives money as a birthday present, his father would say that it is his (the katan's). The katan could then use it to buy chametz which would be his alone. \nThe only eitzah would be for the father to include the child's chametz in the sale of chametz that he does with the Rav. He would have to write this in SPECIFICALLY and not that it is automatically included. \nSimilarly, this would also apply to adult children living at home.</p>\n\n\n",

The second of each group (2, 5, and 8) are preceded by a warning issued to Pharaoh while sitting on his throne.

The first group is in the earth itself - water to blood, frogs from the water, and the dust being turned into lice.  The first had its warning by the Nile, outside of Pharaoh's seat of power.  The second was closer to home, with the warning at the throne itself.  The third did not even get a warning.</p>\n\n<p>The second group is on the land - plagues against man and animals, again with the same progression of intensity.</p>\n\n<p>The third group is the sky - hail which came from the sky, locusts which blocked out the heavenly bodies, and darkness which completely blocked out the light of the sun, with the same progression.</p>\n\n<p>The plagues were split into these groups of three to split them into their divisions of which part of existence they targeted.</p>\n\n<p>The final plague was a \"grand finale\" which also did not get a warning, but was the culmination of the entire display.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe said that this abbreviation answers the question of what Hashem meant when He said that He \"mocked\" the Egyptians when he rescued <em>B'nei Yisra'el</em> from their land.

Eleazar Rokeach of Worms (1176 – 1238). Here he does not say anything more about the manuscript, such as its age. However, this Beis Midrash is known to have burned in 1349, being rebuilt during the following five years, and one scholar assumed that if the manuscript existed in the original Beis Midrash then we can say that the song existed in the first part of the 14th century, if not as far back as the lifetime of the Rokeach himself (13th century). However, this is obviously a slender reed (who says it wasn't in the rebuilt Beis Midrash?). Weil writes elsewhere that he used a siddur written in 1406 as a help in writing his commentary. Thus, if this siddur was his source for the statement about Chad Gadya being in a manuscript in the Worms Beis Midrash, we can at least say that in 1406 there was such testimony (I'm given to believe that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Kasher\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi M. M. Kasher</a> discusses this in Haggadah Shelemah,<sup>2</sup> which I didn't see). This of course means that the song was known to exist in 1406.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>The first stanza of this folk song roughly translates to: \"Good friend, I ask you!/ Good friend, what do you ask me?/ Tell me what is oneness?/ Oneness and unity is the Lord God who lives there/ and hovers there/ in heaven and on earth\". Similar variants also exist.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>In chapter 36 of הגדה שלמה, R' Kasher cites <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehemiah_Br%C3%BCll\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nehemiah Brüll</a>'s <em>Jahrbücher für Jüdische Geschichte und Litterature</em>, IV, 1879, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=mlJFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">p.97</a>, which, in a footnote on a biographical digression about R' Weil and his writings, mentions both the <em>siddur</em> from 1406 and the recovered manuscript from the <em>beis midrash</em> of the Rokeach. R' Kasher appears to connect the two, saying that the former is the source for the latter: \"\nבסידור כ\"י משנת ה\"א קס\"ו (1406) נאמר כי נמצא כתוב על קלף בבית מדרשו של ר' אלעזר רוקח בגרמיזא\". Perhaps I missed something in מרבה לספר (or in <em>Jahrbücher</em>), but, from what I could tell, R' Weil simply attributed the story about the recovered manuscript from the Rokeach's <em>beis midrash</em> to a report that he heard (\"אמרו שמצאו גנוז\" and \"שמעתי שמצאו זה... גנוז\").</sub></p>\n\n<p><sub>R' Kasher does not discuss the issue further, but he does echo the EJ's comment (above) regarding differing liturgical practices among Jews (\"ובקהילות קוגין וסינגלי נהגו לזמרו בנוסח שונה בסעודת השבת שבשבעת ימי המשתה\"), citing the \"<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9653429655\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Goldschmidt Hagadah</a>, p. 76\".</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The following is a footnote from an as yet unpublished Haggadah Yalkut (compiled by me).\nIt discusses a possible 'origin' , or at least influence, on Echad Mi Yodea.</p>\n\n<p>Shmuel bet 24:1-14 tells us that the mageifa, a plague sent in the aftermath of David’s ill-advised census,  should have lasted for 72 hours. Meam Loez, based on Pesikta Rabbati, informs us that in response to David’s contrition, haShem reduced the plague’s duration to 36 hours and then announced He would consider further pleas for leniency. Immediately, sangerim tovim/effective advocates, come forward: mila, Shabbat, the Avot, the Aseret haDibrot, the luchot, and Torah (whose  numeric values are, respectively, 8+7+3+10+2+5 = 35), and the plague was reduced to a single hour.  (Another version of the midrash replaces the Aseret haDibrot and the luchot with the twelve shvatim.) I find it curious that here we have most of the numbers/identities that appear in Echad Mi Yodea, and that they are described as sangerim tovim shel Yisrael. Could those who composed this song have had this midrash in mind? (Consider, too, the fact that Divrei haYamim Alef 21:16,  the prooftext cited in Maggid linking zro’a netuyah to a sword, is taken from that sefer’s retelling of this census episode and describes the sword-bearing angel as a mashchit/destroyer, the same term used in Shmot 12:23 at makkat b’chorot.) So far, I have found only the Safrai haggadah and David Arnow’s Making Lively Seders sharing ‘my’discovery, with only the latter also musing on this as a source for Echad Mi Yodea.</p>\n\n<p>Related to this is another footnote:</p>\n\n<p>There is a curious comment in the Haggadah Tzuf Amarim (by R’ Moshe Kleinman). He cites Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer (28) which states that in the merit of nine, we were redeemed from Mitzrayim. These nine were comprised of the three avot, the four imahot, and the two sources of blood (circumcision and the korban Pesach) shed before the Exodus. Parallel to this, he writes, women spent their nine months of pregnancy in fear and trepidation lest their child be male and, if so, seized and drowned in the Nile. While this pair of nines is not a completely convincing rationale for the inclusion here of ‘nine months of pregnancy’, it has the advantage of a structural affinity with a midrash [cited above].  </p>\n\n\n",

It’s true that in the Prophets and the Writings we find כפרה used with עון many times, for example, בחסד ואמת יכופר עון and בזאת יכופר עון יעקב and והוא רחום יכפר עון, and so too we find כפרה used with פשע once in Tehillim - פשעינו אתה תכפרם, nevertheless, in the Torah we only find it used in connection with חטא.</p>\n<p>And סליחה we find in the Torah used with the word עון, as it says, סלח נא לעון העם הזה and וסלחת לעוננו and we also find סליחה used with חטא many times, for example, מחטאתו ונסלח לו, but with all of them כפרה us written beforehand. But we never find either כפרה or סליחה used with פשע. And even in the Prophets and the Writings we do not find סליחה used with פשע, except one time in Megillas Eichah - נחנו פשענו ומרינו, אתה לא סלחת, but there it is used negatively.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we should use the language of the Torah - כפרה with חטא, and סליחה with עון. But we never find that סליחה is used with פשע, and therefore we should use the word מחילה in connection with פשע since we cannot say it in the way that it is written in the Torah.</p>\n<p>And regarding what the Shelah wrote that the word  סלח signifies lengthiness, this is what I have to say: <strong>When I searched for some support for the word מחילה in לשון הקדש, I did not find the root of this word - it is not from the root חול, nor from the root חלה. Nor can it be compared to the root אחל which is an expression of requesting. The only support I found is that it might be from the root יחול which connotes \"looking forward to\", like יחל ישראל.</strong> If so, unlike what the Shelah says, it is the word מחילה which signifies lengthiness, but the word סלח is translated by Onkelos as שבוק - abandon.</p>\n<p>Thus, it would seem to me that we should say סליחה לעונות ומחילה לפשעים, but since the Shelah testifies in the name of the Rema to say מחילה לעונות וסליחה לפשעים, far be it from me to argue with him. Also, in the Piyut which we say after each סליחה the text is מחילה לחטאים וסליחה לפושעים, which implies that מחילה us more than סליחה, like the Shelah said. And indeed, in the gemara Yerushalmi at the end of mesechta Yoma the text is כפרה לפשעים, מחילה לעונות, סליחה לחטאים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.balashon.com/2006/09/mechila.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balashon</a>, the oldest usage is Mishnaic for \"remission of debt\" and says that according to Jastrow and Steinberg, it originates from a presumed root, \"to wipe, wipe out\". On the other hand, Klein states that the etymology is unknown (see above).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Nachal Eshkol at <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9063&st=&pgnum=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">the end of his introduction to Sefer HaEshkol</a> says that מחילה comes from the root חלל, which he says means to weaken or loosen:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טעמו להחליש ולרפה העוון כהוראת שורש חלל וחללה שטעמו נקוב וחלול, נתרוקן ונחלש, ונתגזר מזה שם כלי שיר 'חליל' בהיותו ריק וחלול ונקרא הגוף במותו חלל כשנתרוקן מנפש ורוח</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>מחילה is accordingly to minimize the sin, as opposed to wiping it out entirely.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why Hashem didn't win Randi's $1 million dollar challenge?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>By the way this question is NOT intended to be blasphemous in anyway. I am questioning what every agnostic is questioning. You can find a more sober article about this here <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8/religions_claim_to_be_nondisprovable/</a></p>\n\n<p>Randi gave  $1 million dollar for any paranormal activity. Detail is here <a href=\"http://www.skepdic.com/randi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.skepdic.com/randi.html</a></p>\n\n<p>In ancient time, Eliah demanded that the Baal priests perform some miracles.</p>\n\n<p>They failed and get killed.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair, Hashem did perform a miracle at that time in shark contrast. Also many of His prophet were slaughtered by followers of Baal.</p>\n\n<p>When I was a kid, I thought the killing of Baal's prophets are kind of just. I mean they claim that they worshiped some false gods that's proven to be worthless.</p>\n\n<p>But then again, may be Baal is not worthless. Maybe he, as Eliyah him self said, was on a quest, sleeping, etc. Maybe, had Elijah ask the priests to perform miracle with enough forward and public notice, then Baal would be \"on\" during the time and can do it.</p>\n\n<p>Or may be Hashem just happen to be around when Baal isn't? After all it's His prophets telling people to do certain things at specific time. So may be He is more well informed about the contest. Elijah himself, with his jokes, didn't dismiss the possibility.</p>\n\n<p>What about Hashem? What would happen if the same test is demanded out of me, for example, as one of Hashem's believers (I am a pretty liberal semi agnostic Christian)?</p>\n\n<p>Here is another one <a href=\"http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/02/450-religious-leaders-killed-in-prayer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.com/2010/02/450-religious-leaders-killed-in-prayer.html</a> asking for the same \"experiment\" to be done.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why doesn't anyone try this experiment today? (Skipping the slaughter\n  of the losers.) We could start with believers vs. non-believers,\n  Christians vs. Muslims, Catholics vs. Protestants, etc., until we\n  zoomed in on the correct religious belief. It'd be so simple!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It makes me wonder. What about if the same test is used against any Hashem's followers' now. I don't know, rabbis, priests, imams, whatever.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.skepdic.com/randi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.skepdic.com/randi.html</a></p>\n\n<p>None of Hashem's religious leaders can perform miracles either now. And, ugh, why not?</p>\n\n<p>How do we know that Hashem is not just like Baal?</p>\n\n<p>I mean, I know that many believes that Hashem did create tons of miracles in the past. However, there isn't a consensus there right? I am sure those Baal priests can claim some past miracles too.</p>\n\n<p>The Baal priests was told to perform a miracle at a specific place and time.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if some atheist guy, say Pol Pot, or Chinese Premier collect 500 rabbis to get some altar burned up. Would Hashem pass?</p>\n\n<p>Well we have something quite similar but far more humane and reasonable. Back to the question. We have this one million dollar challenge by Randi. Any paranormal activity would suffice. No time limit. Hell people can even win through fraud if they're smart enough to fool Randi. We don't have to burn altar on specific time and place.</p>\n\n<p>Any altar any time any place is fine. So we can wait to ensure that Hashem is not on a quest, or sleeping, and match His schedule. </p>\n\n<p>Why Hashem or one of his follower didn't win it yet by now?</p>\n\n<p>What would judaism's point of view on this?</p>\n\n<p>I know that almighty Hashem may not be able to create a puzzle so difficult he can't solve because that's logically absurd. What about some basic miracles? Something that could win $1 million?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you look in the Chumash, you'll see that even when people see miracles, they don't necessarily change their beliefs. Rambam explains that this is because the \"miracles\" are just very unusual natural phenomena. So, in other words, God's \"paranormal\" powers would just be perceived as \"normal,\" because he creates reality by becoming reality. Sorry. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Hashem cannot perform a miracle to win Randi's bet because by drawing attention to a specific discrete act as paranormal, he would be implying that the creation and current existence of the world is not based on divine fiat, which would run counter to God's position.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-manis-friedman/getting-to-know-g-d_b_2658182.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

The Acharonim (see Arukh Ha-Shulchan\n  166:2, for example) record that some are even careful to wash their\n  hands close to their table in order not to walk a long distance\n  between washing one’s hands and reciting ha-motzi. This may have been\n  more relevant before there was central plumbing. In any case, the\n  Arukh Ha- Shulchan (ibid.) writes, “Truthfully, each case should be\n  judged separately (ha-kol lefi ha-inyan), and in a situation in which\n  it is necessary, it is not considered to be an interruption. For\n  example, if the place for washing if farther than 22 amot … it is only\n  considered to be an interruption if he unnecessarily delays [saying\n  ha-motzi].” The Arukh Ha-Shulchan also rejects the practice of washing\n  near one’s table, “ve-eino ikkar klal.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rema talks about the <strong>time</strong> to walk 22 amot. But unless you are running, this implies that the distance should be less than 22 amot. So the Rema might be a source for not abandoning the washing station assuming that it is nearer to the table than 22 amot. (If the existing washing station is further than 22 amot, and the kitchen even further than that, the matter is open to discussion). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/200/gershon-gold\">Gershon Gold</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/47722\">reports</a> that a synagogue he once attended had installed a washing station in the prayer hall so as to avoid <em>kohanim</em> and <em>l'viyim</em>'s leaving the room during the <em>chazan</em>'s repetition of the <em>amida</em> (which could cut the number of men present to fewer than ten).</p>\n\n<p>That can be an argument against getting rid of the washing station in your synagogue.</p>\n\n\n",

I realize that there is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11008/5092\">no need to say any verses at all</a> however I was wondering if this practice violated the concept of breaking up verses as indicated in Megillah 22a - כל פסוקא דלא פסקיה משה אנן לא פסקינן ליה</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A similar question is also discussed in the context of the night time kiddush where many people have the custom to begin with the word \"yom hashishi\", which is also the last two words of a pasuk, without quoting the entire pasuk. The Chosam Sofer (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14663&pgnum=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orach Chayim 10, 4th paragraph here</a>) discussed this particular example, mentioning that some forbid this practice. He himself allows it, because (in short) the recitation of this half-verse is not meant to be a recitation of a verse, but merely an introductory phrase. </p>\n\n<p>This line of reasoning is followed by his student, the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1494&pgnum=87\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maharim Shik (Teshuvah 124)</a>, where he applies this same line of reasoning to the question at hand regarding 'al kein' before the day kiddush. He states that the phrase is merely a declaration of the sanctity of Shabbos, and 'בדרך צחות', as a way to be sharp, we use the biblical phraseology, but we are not reciting a verse qua verse. Similarly, the <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aroch Hashulchan (O.C. 289:3)</a> also allows this practice of starting with 'al kein', for the same reason: because the intent is not to state a verse qua verse, but merely to say a nice thing about Shabbos, there is no problem of splitting pesukim. This is also allowed by the Ben Ish Hai in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1401&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shu\"t Rav Pealim (1:11)</a> where he explains in detail all of the places where we seem to split pesukim in our liturgy. </p>\n\n<p>Despite all of the above, the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=134\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishnah Berurah (289:2)</a> prohibits saying this partial verse without saying the full verse (he does not quote a source for this stringency in the Shaar Hatziyun).</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Potential issue with Theory on Divine Origins of Judaism?",
    "content": "# Potential issue with Theory on Divine Origins of Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The core of a theory is that since Judaism is based on events witnessed by something like 3,000,000 Jews, it is true, while other religions rely on an individual or a few individuals who experienced a supernatural event that they then spread word of (which could be an uncheckable lie). </p>\n\n<p>There are many more details dealing with potential issues discussed in <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/proof-torah-true/\">an article by Rabbi Lawrence Kelemen</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEg_Oys4NkA\">this video</a> where he gives a thorough lecture on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>I was reading a portion of Kings II when I came to the life of King Josiah. According to the annotations of my ArtScroll Stone Edition Tanakh, there was a severe lack of Torah knowledge during this time because of what King Manasseh, Josiah's grandfather, had done. He had been bent on getting rid of all traces of Judaism from his society and filling it with idolatry. The Tanakh even says how the downfall of Judah into exile was directly caused by his actions. Not even Josiah's amazing attempts to right everything was enough. The Tanakh says there was no King like Josiah who followed the LORD with all his heart, soul and more. But that's getting ahead of myself.</p>\n\n<p>The issue comes from what sparked this change in Josiah. When he was 8 years old, he began seeking the God of his forefathers (II Chronicles 34). When he was 12 he began purging the land of idols. When he was 18 he sent his scribe Shafan to the temple, and while there to take care of some business, Shafan received the scroll of the covenant (The Torah), which had been found by the high priest. Shafan read the scroll to Josiah, who then proceeded to rend his garments. He got word from a prophetess who said the punishment for Israel's misdeeds would come no matter what, but he still went and did his best to get rid of idolatry and return the Torah and Judaism to Judah.</p>\n\n<p>So the potential issue here is, in the theory explained by Rabbi Kelemen above, one condition is that there is no person who fits as the seed who planted the Torah into the group of people who forgot who they were and became known as Jews.</p>\n\n<p>He calls this person \"Fred\" in his article, just for example's sake. Here's an excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fred could explain things, again with a smart (uncheckable) lie,\n  claiming that God spoke to him alone and revealed the Torah’s\n  long-lost text and the story of its original revelation at Mount\n  Sinai. Indeed, most modern skeptics gravitate toward a theory like\n  this.</p>\n  \n  <p>A major problem with this theory is we’ve never heard of Fred or his\n  heroic resurrection of Judaism. Certainly one of the most significant\n  events in Jewish history would have been the fumble, when world Jewry\n  forgot they were the three million prophets, and the recovery, when\n  Fred reminded the Jews about the national prophecy at Mount Sinai. Yet\n  in an otherwise comprehensive Jewish history we find no mention of\n  such a claim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He even mentions the issue of Josiah (Yoshiyahu):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Occasionally people try to pin the title “Fred” on minor players like\n  Hilkeyahu, Shafan, or Yoshiyahu. At best, such attempts are forced and\n  ask the reader to interpret texts with crowbar and mallet in hand.\n  They also require shamefully contrived rationalizations attempting to\n  explain (a) why not one Biblical verse explicitly mentions the key\n  point that the Jews forgot about the Torah and “Fred” reintroduced\n  them to it, and (b) why the name of the second most important Jewish\n  hero (next to Moses) appears in the Bible less often than the names\n  “Pharaoh,” “Yeravam,” and “Haman.”)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not sure that this sufficiently addresses the issue. Josiah is very obviously distressed and the scroll itself is obviously the Torah. (The section in II Chronicles directly says it's the Torah). Josiah began his fight against idolatry before he read the Torah, so he obviously knew that idolatry was forbidden. My guess is this was from an oral tradition. He sought God and found some answers. Then, when he read the source of it all and realized what the punishments for these sins were, he was distressed. He proceeded to gather all of Judah and Benjamin and read the scroll in front of them, making them accept the words again. In other words, it was like accepting the covenant again. This is what it seems like to me. The population was Torah ignorant and someone brought it to them again and had them accept it.</p>\n\n<p>Josiah seems like someone who could fit in the \"Fred\" role.</p>\n\n<p>I love this explanation for the truth of the Torah, but this issue has been bothering me for a while. If any of my fellow Jews can give any informed input, it would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I think you have to put this in context.</p>\n<p>We're talking about an age where long distance communication was almost non-existent.</p>\n<p>So while the King had absolute influence over Jerusalem - the further you traveled the less influence he had.</p>\n<p>So while it's possible that within walking distance of Jerusalem the Torah had all but been forgotten (and this is probably an exaggeration—and the Tanach tends to highlight certain aspects of a period) it's fair to assume that <em>up North</em> they knew nothing about this new trend and were still keeping and studying the Torah the way they always did.</p>\n<p>As the story itself says, there were prophets around; prophets had to know the entire Torah before they could attain prophesy. You didn't wake up one morning and become a prophet - as discussed by the Rambam in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1107.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הלכות יסודי התורה פרק ז</a>. Prophets had teachers, schools and a Torah-true support system.</p>\n<p>So had \"Fred\" been on the scene, he would have been <em>one of many</em> of The Old School who didn't abandon their faith, using the liberal-King as an excuse.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think maybe only some of the commandments and the details of Torah (especially the punishment for idolatry and what really constitutes idolatry) was forgotten in the absence of the text.\nHowever the greater part of the how to do a lot of stuff (as what was a Shabbat violation or the niddah rules) were not forgotten, because it was more cultural than anything - religion was part of the ancient Israel culture, so even if they were unaware of some very important details that could mean the difference between exile and staying in the land, and even if in the absence of Torah they didn't fulfill it properly they did not lose it all, and they definitely did not forget the events that took place in Egypt and at Sinai.\nSo yes Josiah retrieved a very important part of Torah that was lost, but this does not mean that the revelation R. Kellemen mentions was forgotten.\n Hope it helped.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a fundamental question that affects the authenticity of our entire mesorah. I have spent a long time researching this topic and believe that the approach I’ve developed is strong, clear, and self-evident.  Here are a few important points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Nowhere in the text does it say that the Torah had been lost and rediscovered</strong>. This is merely an interpretation that some have read into the narrative to explain the events. The pesukim themselves do not say that the Torah was missing or forgotten.</li>\n<li><strong>The Navi assumed that the readers were already familiar with the Chumash</strong>, and therefore did not feel the need to explain what would have been obvious to them. Anyone who has read Parshas Vayeilech (Devarim 31:19–29) knows that <strong>the Sefer Torah written by Moshe was to be kept in the Mishkan/Mikdash as a witness against the Jewish people, to warn them of the punishments that would come if they sinned</strong>. Therefore, it is entirely understandable that Yoshiyahu would be shocked and afraid if this very Sefer — the one designated as a witness of the consequences of national sin — suddenly emerged. The fear was not from the mere existence of the Sefer, but from the confrontation with its message.</li>\n<li><strong>This reading is clearly supported by the context</strong>. If you continue reading in Melachim II (22:13–16), it’s evident that the entire discussion following the discovery focuses on the tochacha (rebuke and warning in the Torah). Similarly, in Divrei HaYamim II (34:14), it tells us that Chilkiyahu HaKohen found \"the Sefer Torah of Hashem by the hand of Moshe,\" which fits very well with what we said above that this was the sefer that Moshe had commanded be kept in the Beis Hamikdash. (I believe that the Rashba and Abarbanel make these points)</li>\n<li><strong>Chazal also support this view</strong>.  The Yerushalmi tells us that the Sefer Torah was found rolled to the tochacha. Most Rishonim explain the episode accordingly: the Sefer was found rolled up to a terrifying section, which gave it an additional urgency and relevance.</li>\n<li><strong>From a historical perspective, it’s unlikely the Torah had been truly forgotten</strong>. During the reign of Chizkiyahu, it's clear that the Torah was known and observed — for example, see Divrei HaYamim II 30:16. He was succeeded by his wicked son Menashe, who ruled for 55 years but eventually did teshuvah and attempted to restore proper service of Hashem (Divrei HaYamim II 33:12–16). He was followed by Amon, who reigned for just two years, and then by Yoshiyahu, who began seeking out Hashem already in his eighth year (Divrei HaYamim II 34:3). The Sefer Torah was discovered in the eighteenth year of his reign. So, from the death of Chizkiyahu until the Torah was found was around 70 years. And that’s being generous. Realistically, the Torah would not have disappeared the moment Menashe took power, and he later tried to bring people back to it. Furthermore, Yoshiyahu had already begun a process of spiritual revival ten years before the Sefer was found. So the actual window of neglect was much shorter.  <strong>And even if it had been 70 years, that is not long enough for the Torah to be forgotten</strong>. Just as we see in Ezra 3:12 that elders remembered the First Beis HaMikdash after 70 years of exile, it’s entirely logical that elders in Yoshiyahu’s time still remembered Torah from the days of Chizkiyahu as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThe idea that the Torah was lost for generations and only rediscovered in Yoshiyahu’s time is not only unsupported by the text — it is deeply problematic for our understanding of Jewish history and mesorah. The context of the pesukim, Chazal, Rishonim, and historical context all point to a very different, far more compelling explanation: the Torah was never lost.  The Torah is an eternal relationship that we have been given with Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

The Ramban, noting the juxtaposition of the verse describing the sin of the golden calf (<em>D'varim</em> 9:21, ואת <strong>חטאתכם</strong> אשר עשיתם את העגל) with the verse recalling the transgression in the episode of the spies (<em>D'varim</em> 9:23, 'ותמרו את פי ה), writes (ibid. 9:22-24):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה החטא לנסות את השם הוא חטא גדול ואשמה רבה כאשר הזהיר ממנו (לעיל ו טז) לא תנסו את ה' אלהיכם כאשר נסיתם במסה על כן החזיר אותו להם בכאן. וכך הזכיר פעם אחרת <strong>חטא המרגלים</strong> בקצרה בעבור העון הגדול כי בו ישלים ממרים הייתם עם השם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bechaya uses this expression in commenting that the חטא המרגלים prevented the Israelites from being worthy of entering the Land of Israel immediately (<em>D'varim</em> 1:1, תיכף שקבלו ישראל התורה בסיני היו ראוים להכנס לארץ לולא חטא המרגלים שעכבם במדבר ארבעים שנה; see also commentary to <em>Sh'mos</em> 6:8). The Ralbag also refers to the חטא המרגלים in his commentary to <em>Y'hoshua</em> (14:6). </p>\n\n\n",

Does this mean that I need to be completely finished with kashering my home, and have all chametz out by 12:12PM? If I were to encounter chametz that was not seen prior to 12:12PM, could I still remove it after 12:12PM? </p>\n\n<p>Also, if the kashering of an oven or dishes hadn't quite reached the 24-hour mark since the physical kashering, would the appliance or dishes be considered treif and chametz by 12:12PM? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As explained in guides such as the OU guide and the shulchan Aruch (Siman 434) and Chayei Adam Klal 119 Seif 29, if you find chametz after the time, it should be destroyed immediately. If it is found on Yom Tov, then it is to be covered (because it is muktzah) and destroyed immediately after Yom Tov. I am not sure what you mean by 'kashering your home' as you should have found and removed all chametz by the bedikah the night before. If you mean that you need to wait 24 hours before kashering the sink, then as long as you get it done before you need to use it for Pesach, then you should be OK. Since kashering the oven is usually done by libun (burning - see the OU guide), which is nowadays normally done using the self clean feature of the oven, you do  not (in that normal case) have to wait for 24 hours after the last use before doing it.</p>\n\n<p>Dishes are not normally able to be kashered (because they are china), which is why we have Pesach dishes.

    "content": "# Why does the authorship of the Zohar matter?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen and heard a lot of controversy about the authorship of the Zohar, but it isn't quite clear to me that it matters. The nearest theory I can come up with is that if the Zohar is by Rashbi, then it's Tannaic, but if it's by de Leon, then it's Rishonic, which would obviously affect the way of poskining. Yet, I cannot think of a single example of halakha that would be affected by this: but this is of no consequence, since I'm not exactly the most learned person. Therefore, my question is twofold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What hilchos would be affected by the authorship question?</li>\n<li>Is there some other angle I'm missing here about authorship and why it matters?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<h2>Halakha</h2>\n\n<p>First of all, the question of authorship doesn't necessarily affect the Zohar's importance in halakha; I'm not sure why you think that this it would \"obviously affect the way of poskining\". The question of how Kabbalah affects Halacha is not a simple one, and does not really depend on the Zohar's authorship, because even if it were written by a Tanna, we don't just hold like any Tanna in halakha (after all, how many Toseftas are there that we don't hold of!). This is discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/3826/kabala-in-halacha\">on this site</a>, <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/802001/_Jonathan_Ziring/Halacha_and_Kabbala_-_Generally_and_in_the_Psak_of_R_Ovadiah_Yosef\" rel=\"noreferrer\">by this audio shiur</a> and in the book העד הגל הזה, where R. Yaakov Hillel has a great chapter on the topic. </p>\n\n<h2>Hashkafa</h2>\n\n<p>However, there is more to Judaism than halakha. The way that we understand certain views or 'hashkafos' to be 'Jewish views' or 'Jewish values' has a lot to do with the understanding of earlier Jewish sources. 'Jewish sources', though, are both vast in number and can vary widely vary in their positions, and equal weight isn't given to every Rabbi who happen to have written a book. There are a couple of factors, therefore, that would cause one source to be more 'weighty' than another, authorship and age being two of the major ones. </p>\n\n<p>If a particular person is a great Torah scholar or known to have a much deeper knowledge of Judaism, than his opinion of what the Torah's position is on a particular issue should be given more weight than that of a lesser scholar. Thus, the Tanna R. Shimon bar Yochai is well known to us as well as to the members of his own time period as a great scholar, a very high-ranking Talmid Chacham, so to speak, as well as an incredibly righteous person, so much so that the authors of the Gemara felt that it was fit to record (in Sukkah 45b) that R. Shimon bar Yohai felt that if there are only two great people at all, it would be himself and his son. The other contender for authorship, R. Moses de Leon, is not nearly as highly regarded, and therefore if the Zohar reflected <em>his</em> opinions, they wouldn't carry as much weight.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%93%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">for whatever the reason</a>, when it comes to evaluating the importance of a given viewpoint among the sea of Jewish authors, earlier sources are given more weight than later ones. This rule is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acharonim#Consequences_for_Halakhic_change\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fairly well-accepted to in halakha</a>, though of course <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acharonim#Consequences_for_Halakhic_change\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there are exceptions</a>, and so many<sup>[<em>who?</em>]</sup> apply the rule to hashkafa or theology as well<sup>[<em>citation needed</em>]</sup>. Thus, even disregarding the discrepancies in the scholarship level, then all else being equal, the relative importance of earlier sources is higher than that of later sources.</p>\n\n<h2>Context/Implications</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, there is the secondary issue of what it would mean <em>for kabbalah</em> that R. Shimon bar Yochai did not write the Zohar. The word <em>kabbalah</em> means '<em>a recieved [tradition]</em>', and the general authority (or authenticity, or general value) to kabbalah, as opposed to any other theosophic system that would be attributed to it by religious Jews is because it represents a <em>received tradition</em> that traces itself back to something revealed by God, which is why we value the Torah and deem it authoritative. Hence, while it's true that some have denied the Zohar's tannaitic authorship while maintaining it's essential nature as a text of authentic Jewish/divine presentation, (such as <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22067&st=&pgnum=39\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Eliyhu ben Amozeg</a>, and to an extent, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33319&st=&pgnum=39&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Emden</a>) overall, to say that a work of kabbalah which is so vast and attributes so many ideas to Tannaim is actually of a much later composition is anathema to the whole spirit of kabbalah, which is supposed to be grounded in 'received traditions'. </p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, R. Chaim Kanievsky is quoted as saying that someone who doesn't believe that the Zohar was actually authored by R. Shimon bar Yochai - seemingly, even if he believes in its authority as a Jewish text - is a heretic (Vayichtov Mordechai pg. 340). For further reading, I'd suggest <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9qDT_J6e1NHZjFiOTIzMDUtNDg0Zi00NTY3LWJhYjItOGViZDBmMzMxNWQ2/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> which details many Rabbinic opinions regarding the Zohar's authorship, without actually discussing any arguments for or against, while touching on these questions indirectly. Note especially footnote 8, where the point is made that disputes about the Zohar's authorship are really made against the backdrop of it's acceptance as an authoritative Jewish position.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The argument about the \"authenticity\" of the Zohar is usually part of a broader argument against the validity of kabbala. The teachings of Kabbala, as presented in the Zohar and related works, are generally accepted as an intrinsic part of Jewish tradition by the broad mainstream of Jewish tradition. As such it has had a profound impact on Jewish thought, as well as on Jewish practice (which is broader than just halacha).</p>\n\n<p>The role that kabbala in general, and the Zohar in particular, should play in halacha is also a matter of great debate, for reasons that have very little to do with their authenticity, which is generally accepted by both sides. This is similar to the debates over the halachic role played by many, unquestionably authentic works, such as the Jerusalem Talmud and the midrashim, and even the aggadic passages in the Babylonian Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>Given the great importance that kabbala, and the Zohar in particular, has in the world of Jewish thought, it is unsurprising that challenges to its authenticity are highly controversial.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is also the matter of accepting the conclusions of academic scholarship when they conflict with standard Jewish tradition. It is not just the authorship of the Zohar (and the Bahir, and the Sefer Yetzira, etc.) which have been called into question, even books in Tanach such as Yeshayahu HaNavi have, by academics, been proposed to have multiple authors to say nothing of the Chumash itself. </p>\n\n<p>Even if not a single halacha changes, to accept the various techniques proposed by academics to determine authorship as valid is not in keeping with the vast majority of orthodox Jewish authorities (with obvious exceptions such as Leon Modena, Shadal etc.). Once the door is opened to adopting such techniques it would be very hard to argue why they should be applied to certain accepted works and not to others. </p>\n\n\n",

Like the question on dipping, he cannot know what will be required throughout the meal in the future -- he should be asking only on what he has seen. However, he has seen one instance of dipping and sees the other ingredients for dipping and can infer that there will be another dipping (this is the answer I read in a Haggadah). But the child has not seen much eating (for Karpas we specifically eat less than the shiur so that doesn't seem like a substantial thing to infer from), only drinking so he can't infer that we will lean for ALL the eating.</p>\n\n<p>And, if he did infer that, he would be wrong. We don't recline when eating maror!</p>\n\n<p>Is the child saying that \"we all\" means that everyone reclines? The language conspicuously changes from \"anu\" (we) to \"kulanu\" (we all) so it might follow that this is about including all the people at the seder. This would make sense because he, the child, would have just reclined even in the presence of his father so that would seem unusual. But a student does NOT recline in the presence of his Rebbi so we don't \"all\" recline.</p>\n\n<p>It is easy (and common sense) to assume that the child would not know this intricacy of halacha, but the child already has shown that he knows laws of maror and dipping before they happen so it seems wrong to assume that he didn't learn the laws of heseiba  as well.</p>\n\n<p>To what does the \"kulanu\" refer and why is it presented as an absolute when it doesn't seem to be?</p>\n\n<p>Any insight would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Kulanu, as the others have said, means that everyone leans. How to square that with the fact that not everyone is required (or even allowed in some cases) to lean is asked by the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_46448_386.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Natai Gavriel</a>. In a nutshell, his answer is leaning is about showing the autonomy and freedom of liberation, and that we all participate in the action of showing the liberation of leaning, whether or not an individual person leans in that situation. The non-leaner's actions are part of the demonstration of freedom of the group which contains someone who's presence prevents the leaning.</p>\n\n<p>So we are all participating in the demonstration of freedom that leaning represents.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The term \"anachnu\" means \"we\" and \"kulanu\" means \"all of us\" (as it has the word \"kol\" meaning \"all\" or \"complete\" / \"everything\".)</p>\n\n<p>While these 2 terms may seem to have the same meaning, there is an important difference. \"Kulanu\" implies unity. For example, in parshat Miketz, when Yoseph accuses teh brothers of being spies, Yehuda says, \"Kulanu b'nai ish echod nachnu\" (Notice, than in the same sentence, Yehuda uses BOTH the terms \"kulanu\" and \"nachnu\" - (same as \"anachnu\"). Yehuda says, \"All of us (as a unit) are the sons of one man.</p>\n\n<p>Another nuance in the hagadah's phrase \"kulanu mesubin\" is that the term \"mesubin\" is a noun, not a verb. Thus the translation of \"kulanu mesubin\" means that \"All of us (a unit - whether you want to consider that unit the family members at the Seder or exten it to all of B'nai Yisra'el) - all of us are recliners (the noun form).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>כֻּלָּנוּ means \"we all\": he's asking about the fact that all the people recline. (Source: my knowledge of Hebrew.) That answers most of your question, and I hope others can answer the rest.</p>\n\n\n",

No one goes into your house to perform a kinyan on the chometz, do they?</li>\n<li>An item being returned during Pesach - the counter principle to the above is \"ayn chavin le'adam shelo bifanav\" - since the seller would not wish to be in possession of the object, as it entails a burden rather than a benefit, the returner does not possess the ability to acquire the object for the seller once he decides to return it. If the returned package shows up on your front door, don't do a kinyan on it such as picking it up. Zachta li sadi requires a declaration of intent - your property can only take possession of an object if you will it to do so.</li>\n<li>The buyer being Jewish - If the buyer was Jewish, you might run into some tricky issues like chametz she'avur alav et hapesach (especially if it was returned), but that wouldn't prevent the sale from taking place if it was finalized and shipped before Pesach. </li>\n<li>One consideration of a Jewish buyer is \"lifnei iver\" by causing another Jew to sin for being in possession of chametz.

In this case, Shmuel asked for natural means to protect himself because the danger was imminent and from a human being. </p>\n\n<p>Another point is that after the mission was completed, there would no longer be a reason for protection. Thus, Shmuel needed a 'legitimate' reason for going that would stand up to scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>An analogy is to Yoseph in the pit. Reuven suggested putting him in the pit because Hashem would save him from the natural dangers of the snakes and scorpiuons. However, because man has free will, the brothers could have killed him. Similarly, while he would be protected from natural danges (such as earthquake or flood), he would still be in danger from Shaul.</p>\n\n<p>Radak also says that Shmuel did make a public affair.</p>\n\n<p>Radak says that Hashem told him to bring a korban because this was the time that it was permissible to bring a sacrifice on a bamah while the mishkan was in Nov (after shiloh was destroyed and before the temple was built in Yerushalayim). The RZ'L (rabonnon zichronam levrachah) learn from this pasuk that it a mitzvah to change matters for the sake of peace because Hashem told Shmuel take the calf and this shows that it is not proper for a person to go into a place of danger and rely on a nes because \"You shall not test Hashem\". </p>\n\n<p>And there are those who say that Hashem said \"I told you to go quietly and you said perhaps Shaul will kill me, now I tell you to go publicly and take a calf to bring Shelamimon the day that you anoint him as king\". This is what it means \"Call Yishai to the sacrifice publicly and you will see who tries to kill you\" This is also what Hashem told Moshe Rabbeinu \"Go before the people\" because Moshe had said \"Only a little more and they will stone me\". Hashem said \"Go before the people and we will see who stones you\"</p>\n\n<p>We see that according to the first answer, this was not a deception, but was a normal way of giving a valid excuse in order to allow him to proceed \"bderech Teva\" (naturally). Since he normally would give a korban and could invite Yishai to attend (as a gadol of the city), he could then anoint whichever of his sons Hashem would point out.</p>\n\n<p>According to the second pshat, Hashem is telling Shmuel to go in public and nobody would dare do anything to him.</p>\n\n<p>The Alshich says that at that time it was not known where the Bais Hamikdash was going to be built. Many people thought it might be Bais Lechem and would sacrifice on the Bama there (which was allowed). Thus, Shmuel was allowed to go there and sacrifice in any event. This was not a deception as he indeed brought a sacrifice under the command of Hashem and invited the Yishai as the gadol of the city to join him. The fact that he then anointed David did not detract from the legitimacy of the Korban.</p>\n\n<p>The Ralbag says that (in the name of Rav Shlomo, a gadol of his city) that a report had come to Shmuel that Bais Lechem required an egla arufah. Once he got there, he found that a murdered person had <strong>not</strong> been found. As a result, he offered the calf as a Shelamim in thanks for the good news and was able to anoint David at that time.</p>\n\n<p>Again we see that this was not a deception but a real sacrifice.</p>\n\n\n",

I will add another quote <a href=\"http://koltorah.org/Volume%2014/30_Metzora.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">One-of-a-Kind Punishment</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>by Jesse Dunietz</p>\n  \n  <p>At the tail end of the numerous laws of Tzaraat specified by Parshiot\n  Tazria and Metzora, the Torah discusses the topic of Tzaraat on a\n  house. The Torah introduces this topic by saying, “Ki Tavo’u El Eretz\n  Kena’an…Venatati Nega Tzaraat Beveit Eretz Achuzatchem,” “When you\n  come to the Land of Canaan…I will put an affliction of Tzaraat in the\n  house of the Land of your inheritance” (14:34). Rashi on this Pasuk\n  quotes the famous Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 14:7) that when the owner of\n  a Tzaraat-stricken house would tear down his home, as per the Torah’s\n  instructions, he would find golden treasures. These riches had been\n  left by the previous Emori inhabitants of the houses, who, fearing\n  Bnei Yisrael’s impending invasion, had hidden their valuables in the\n  walls when Bnei Yisrael were wandering in the Midbar. Famous though it\n  may be, this is quite a puzzling comment; after all, Chazal in a\n  number of places clearly associate Tzaraat with major sins,\n  particularly Lashon Hara. What could possibly lead Rashi (and the\n  Midrash he quotes) to believe that Tzaraat on a house signifies\n  something positive? Many commentators (Mizrachi, Siftei Chachamim,\n  Yefei Einayim, Re’eim, and others) point to the difference between the\n  Torah’s language in this Pasuk and that which it uses to introduce the\n  other types of Tzaraat afflictions. In our Pasuk, Hashem specifically\n  says “Venatati,” “and I will give,” a word with an active and positive\n  connotation. In contrast, all the other Pesukim that describe the\n  presence of Tzaraat, such as 13:2, 13:42, and 13:47, simply use\n  “Yihyeh” or “Tihyeh,” “it shall be.” The Pasuk about houses is thus\n  the only one with the positive undertones. Some commentators, based on\n  the continuation of the Midrash, also bring support from the\n  parallelism between our Pasuk and a promise Hashem later makes in\n  Devarim (6:10). There we are told, “When He will bring you to the Land\n  which He swore…to give you, and houses full of all good things….” Both\n  of these Pesukim start by mentioning entrance into the Land, continue\n  with a reference to Hashem’s commitment to give it to us, and conclude\n  by discussing the houses of the Land. The fact that “houses full of\n  all good things” in Devarim corresponds to our Pasuk’s reference to\n  Tzaraat implies that the Tzaraat affliction on houses is actually a\n  fulfillment of the promise in Devarim. This explanation provides a\n  compelling textual basis for the assertion of Rashi and the Midrash\n  that house-Tzaraat is, at least to some extent, a positive experience.\n  However, this still leaves us with a philosophical conundrum: how\n  could the phenomenon that carries so many negative associations, and\n  which the Torah constantly calls a “Nega,” an affliction, have such a\n  positive aspect to it? Furthermore, the Gemara states explicitly in\n  several places (Yoma 11 and Arachin 16) that Tzaraat afflicts houses\n  because of the owner’s stinginess, particularly because of denying\n  that one has the means to aid others. This, according to the Gemara,\n  is why the owner of the house must clear his possessions out of his\n  house – he is being forced to publicly display the true extent of his\n  means, contradicting his stingy claims. According to these Gemaras,\n  Tzaraat on a house, like the other forms of Tzaraat, is clearly a\n  punishment for inappropriate behavior. How can we reconcile this with\n  the positive light in which Rashi seems to view this phenomenon? Rav\n  Y. Eiger suggests that this is a form of punishment through Chesed. He\n  brings the analogy of a king who has been insulted by a lowly peasant.\n  Such a king may decide, rather than punishing the peasant harshly, to\n  elevate him to a high position and give him gifts. Upon comprehending\n  the kindness and greatness of the man whom he so disrespected and\n  degraded, the peasant will become ashamed of the foolishness of his\n  actions. Similarly, Hashem acts kindly and positively towards the\n  homeowner afflicted with Tzaraat as part of his correction process –\n  He causes the sinner to understand what and Whom he spurned by\n  sinning, thus paving the way for shame, regret, and repentance. The\n  Tzaraat is a punishment of sorts, but punishment through Chesed. Rav\n  Eiger’s explanation, though quite clever, still leaves one gaping\n  hole. Why is it specifically the man who has Tzaraat, and particularly\n  Tzaraat on his house, who is given such treatment? We do not say, for\n  example, that one who violates Shabbat should be rewarded for such\n  behavior so that he will feel shame and repent! I would like to\n  suggest (with thanks to my father for his help with this idea) that\n  this model of reward combined with punishment is aptly suited to the\n  particular sin that causes Tzaraat on a house. As we mentioned before,\n  the Gemara states that such Tzaraat is a result of stinginess and\n  unwillingness to share one’s possessions. To counteract this attitude,\n  Hashem drives home to the offender the message of wholehearted\n  generosity. In the midst of forcing this man to clear out and tear\n  down his house, Hashem still showers him with gifts; even while\n  expressing His strong disapproval of the man’s actions, Hashem’s\n  generosity does not cease. To receive such a gift in the middle of\n  what he knows to be a punishment forces the owner of the house to\n  contemplate the concept of generosity. If Hashem is willing to grant\n  such gifts to a lowly sinner such as himself, how much more willing\n  should he be to lend and give to his worthy neighbors! Thus, because\n  of the context in which he is given these “golden treasures” hidden in\n  his walls, it is particularly the sufferer of house-Tzaraat who will\n  be compelled to feel shame about what he did, and hopefully to reshape\n  his mode of generosity and giving to fit the example that Hashem’s\n  gift to him provides. Finally, Rabbi Chaim Jachter has suggested that\n  we might understand Rashi’s approach to house-Tzaraat in light of a\n  general phenomenon in Rashi’s commentary to the Chumash. It appears\n  that Rashi hardly ever misses an opportunity to heap praise on the\n  Jewish people. Even passages in the Chumash that would on the surface\n  appear to be critical of Am Yisrael are often interpreted in a manner\n  that reflects Hashem’s love for His nation. Perhaps Rashi’s positive\n  spin on house-Tzaraat is one of the many expressions of the manner in\n  which Rashi lifts the spirit and pride of Am Yisrael to empower us to\n  resist the humiliations that many of our critics both past and present\n  relentlessly heap upon us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus the reason of finding the treasure is a third <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/kolhakollel/5765/metzora.html?print=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">reason</a> in order to both give a person a warning and to reward him because he does learn the lesson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein explains that although the plague came to\n  benefit the house owner with treasure, that objective was possible to\n  achieve without going through the ordeal of destroying their house.\n  The tzoraas experience was demanding and unpleasant, to alert the\n  recipient of his wrongdoing and need for change. The plague worked to\n  achieve both punishment and reward.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Avigdor Miller further elaborates that the Creator of the\n  World, in His infinite wisdom, has a master plan that our finite human\n  minds cannot fathom. This plan will materialize, and cannot be stopped\n  or frustrated by our decisions and actions. Certain events are\n  destined to occur regardless of our actions, but the sequence or\n  details of the events may be manipulated to teach us a Divine lesson.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menashe_Klein\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Menashe Klein</a> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33668&pgnum=148\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes in his מגיד משנה</a>, that the houses of both the righteous and the sinners (whether tattlers or misers) can be afflicted with צרעת.

(though, I have seen ground cumin which is from a seed.)\nSo 2 questions in one: - when / how did peanut oil which is a kitniyot \"derivative\" become prohibited?\nWhy are \"seeds\" included in the kitniyot prohibition. What is the definition of a \"seed\"? Almost every fruit and vegetable is from a seed. Are pumpkin \"seeds\" prohibited, too?</p>\n\n\n",

As a result, one should not invite a guest. A maid or waiter can be served because they will not expect extra food to be cooked for them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/ostroff/archives/shabbos3_29.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halachos Series on Hilchos Shabbos</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>May one invite a gentile on Yom Tov to eat at the Yom Tov table?</p>\n  \n  <p>There definitely is a serious problem in inviting a gentile, on Yom\n  Tov, to partake of your Yom Tov meal, for the following reasons:</p>\n  \n  <p>The possuk in (Sh’mos 12:17) states 'ach asher yochal l'chol nefesh hu\n  levado ya'aseh lachem', which teaches us that one may cook on Yom Tov\n  for the sake of Yom Tov. However, at the end of the possuk the word\n  לכם – for you, the gemora explains, means that one may not cook or do\n  any melacha for a gentile. This means that one may cook and roast\n  chicken for a Jew on Yom Tov, but not for a gentile.</p>\n  \n  <p>What could be wrong, if for example the food is prepared in a single\n  pot?</p>\n  \n  <p>Chazal prohibited preparing food for a gentile on Yom Tov even though\n  one is cooking it in the same pot without any extra effort. The\n  question becomes more difficult when the Shulchan Aruch HaRav [2]\n  points out that the halacha states that one may fill a pot of water\n  and boil it even though one only needs the amount of one cup and the\n  remainder will be used after Yom Tov. [3] (One may not say that the\n  excess is for after Yom Tov and it may only be filled in one\n  occurrence). If so, why is it ossur to cook extra for a gentile even\n  though there is no extra effort invested?</p>\n  \n  <p>The answer is that when one invites a guest over to eat, one makes\n  sure that there is ample food for one’s household and for the newly\n  arrived guest. Chazal were afraid that one would cook extra food for\n  the guest in a separate cooking pot and thus violate the issur of\n  cooking for a gentile. Therefore, even though one does not intend to\n  cook in a separate pot for the gentile, there is reason for concern\n  that it might lead thereto. [4] </p>\n  \n  <p>Does that mean that I may not give my Yom Tov food to my gentile maid?</p>\n  \n  <p>No, it is not the same. The reason for the distinction is because\n  one’s maid is not a “guest” and is not treated with the same honor.\n  One would not cook extra food in a separate pot for the maid and\n  therefore there is no room for concern. However, one may only add\n  extra to the pot in the first place before the initial cooking but not\n  add to the pot after it is already on the stove even for one’s maid.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are exceptions to the rule, for example, certain dishes have a\n  better taste when there is more food in the pot, which would permit\n  adding food to the pot even after it is on the stove, but a rav would\n  need to be consulted because this does not always apply. As mentioned,\n  the optimal is to add as much as necessary to the pot before cooking.</p>\n  \n  <p>May I invite the guest on Yom Tov after the food is prepared? It seems\n  that then there is no room to be concerned that I will cook more food.</p>\n  \n  <p>Even in this case it is forbidden to invite a gentile. [5]</p>\n  \n  <p>What if the gentile arrives uninvited?</p>\n  \n  <p>If the guest arrives after your meal is already prepared the person\n  may partake of the meal. If however the person is a VIP, there are\n  those who prohibit this unless you explicitly say to the guest that he\n  may share whatever you have prepared. Even if the person arrives of\n  his own accord, you may not coax and invite the guest, because that is\n  similar to an invitation. [6]</p>\n  \n  <p>[2] Simon 512:3.</p>\n  \n  <p>[3] Shulchan Aruch HaRav simon 503:4, Mechaber 503:2 and M”B 14-15.</p>\n  \n  <p>[4] Shulchan Aruch HaRav simon 512:3.  </p>\n  \n  <p>[5] M”B simon 512:3. See the Sha’ar Hatsiun 3 who argues with the M”A\n  who permits this, because from the Rambam one sees that even this is\n  ossur.</p>\n  \n  <p>[6] M”B simon 512:10.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Israeli making pizza on last day of Pesach in the Diaspora\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A Jew who lives in the U.S. own a pizza store. He wants to be sure that he has plenty of fresh pizzas ready to sell as soon as Pesach is over. So, before Pesach, he sells his chametz to his Israeli brother. The Israeli brother sells his chametz, including the batch brought from his U.S. brother, via his rav in Israel. Now the Israeli brother flies to the U.S. for Pesach. Since the Israeli does not celebrate the 8th day of Pesach, and the chametz has been bought back by the Israeli rav, the Israeli goes to the pizza store and bakes pizzas on our 8th of Pesach. Is there any problem with this procedure? Can one buy the pizza after Pesach?</p>\n\n<p>BTW - the gates to the pizza store are down so there is no problem of mares ayin if someone from the neighborhood passed by the store on the 8th day of Pesach and saw it open. There MAY be some questions when people come in after Pesach and wonder how so many pizzas were baked so quickly after the end of Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>We can also assume that even if there is a requirment for the Israeli to \"observe\" the 8th day of Yom Tov, the fire was lit from a pre-existing flame, so there is no melacha involved. We can further assume that he was not preparing for after Yom Tov since the Israeli ate some of the pizza, himself.</p>\n\n<p>Please focus your answers on the issue of the chametz problem only; not the melacha problem, as there is none involved. Food preparation is permitted on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9102&st=&pgnum=131\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aruch Hashulchan 496:5</a> says that it is forbidden for a Ben Eretz Yisrael to eat Chometz in Chutz L'Aretz on Acharon Shel Pesach.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש מי שאומר דבן ארץ ישראל הבא לחוץ לארץ – אסור לו לאכול חמץ באחרון של פסח בכל עניין, אפילו דעתו לחזור. ונכון הוא, דזה גריע ממלאכה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You could try to construe something odd and theoretical in which the question would come up [e.g. you have a commercial bakery in the middle of nowhere], but practically in the case you describe -- you could build a 20-foot brick wall surrounding your pizza store, but it's in a Jewish neighborhood (as kosher restaurants are), so there will be the smells, sounds, and indications of people going in and out. There's really no way to do this that will be completely unnoticeable to the Pesach-observing Jews nearby.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question has been edited to specify that this refers only to the Chametz problem alone. As a result, I have deleted most of my answer. I checked with my LOR (who is a rav at Ner Israel in Baltimore) and he said that the accepted general halacha is that an Israeli in chutz la'aretz for Pesach is <strong>not allowed</strong> to buy back chametz until after all eight days of Pesach. </p>\n\n<p>An Israeli who is chutz la'aretz on the Eighth day of Pesach is no more allowed to own chametz (and is subject to B'al yiraeh bal yimatzeh) than he is allowed to eat it. The question as asked has the Israeli in the (Jewish owned) pizza parlor and owning the chametz (and working with it) which as far as I am concerned causes him to violate bal yiraeh bal yimatzei. It is like the reason one must lock away chametz sold to the goy and rent him the space. Note that if the Israeli's brother owns the store, he (the brother) is in violation even if he does not own the chametz itself. The next set of posting goes into why I think this.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1156\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Tefilot of An Israeli On The Second Day Of Yom Tov When Visiting Outside of Israel</a> seems to imply that he would not be able to buy back chametz on the eighth day. Since this is mekach umemkar (if the Israeli brother is buying back the chametz), the action is forbidden in chutz la'aretz on that day. Additionally, he is not allowed to own chametz on that day just as a ben chutz la'aretz is not allowed to own chametz on that day. Thus, even if the rabbi in Israel buys it for him, ain shliach lidvar avaeirah. Note that I said earlier that the Israeli rabbi would not have bought the chametz for him and the Israeli brother would have had to tell him that he had chometz in chutz la'aretz. If he did not tell the rabbi that he would not be in Israel for Pesach, I do not know if the purchase would be valid. Even if someone holds that the Israeli does not have to keep the second day Yom Tov, he would be forbidden to do anything that is asur to the community in chutz la'aretz because of mar'is ayin <strong>even in private</strong>. Note that even speaking about the davening, he cannot wear tefilin where anyone can see him (kal vachomer buy back chametz or own chametz, or have chametz in his property). That is if he is not allowed to perform something that is a mitzvah for him in public, kal vachomer that he is forbidden to do something that is completely asur to the community and that he is not required to do.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemara in Masechet Pesachim (52) records that Rav Safra, who lived\n  in Eretz Yisrael and observed just one day, spent Yom Tov one year in\n  a community that observed two days of Yom Tov. Out of respect for the\n  community, which observed a second day of Yom Tov, Rav Safra, too,\n  refrained from Melacha (forbidden activity) on this day, even though\n  for him, as a resident of Eretz Yisrael, this was not Yom Tov.</p>\n  \n  <p>Accordingly, the Shulchan Aruch writes (Orach Chayim 496:3; listen to\n  audio for precise citation) that a resident of Eretz Yisrael who comes\n  to a community in Chutz La'aretz (the Diaspora) for Yom Tov must\n  abstain from Melacha on the second day of Yom Tov. The Shulchan Aruch\n  emphasizes that this applies even if the individual comes only for a\n  temporary visit and plans to return to Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n  \n  <p>It should be noted, however, that since for this person the second day\n  is not actually a Yom Tov, he would recite the weekday prayers, rather\n  than the Yom Tov prayers. Likewise, he should wear Tefillin on this\n  day, as he does on weekdays, though only in private, and not in the\n  view of those celebrating a second day of Yom Tov. (Mishna Berura,\n  496:3, Seif Kattan 13)</p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, this applies only if the individual comes to the Diaspora\n  for just a temporary visit. If he comes with the intent of residing\n  there permanently, then he is considered a full-fledged resident of\n  the Diaspora, and he observes a second day of Yom Tov with the special\n  Tefilot and without wearing Tefillin.</p>\n  \n  <p>Summary: <strong>An Israeli resident who visits a community in the Diaspora\n  during Yom Tov must abstain from forbidden activity on the second day\n  of Yom Tov</strong>, but he recites weekday prayers and wears Tefillin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, the daf yomi in Beitzah 9A points out that when something is forbidden because of Mar'is Ayin, <strong>it is forbidden even in a private area</strong>. This is especially true for a Torah violation. Tosafos to Kesubos 60a, Magen Avraham 301:56, Mishnah Berurah 301:56with Beur Halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

This issue is discussed at length by Prof. Richard C. Steiner of Yeshiva University, in an article titled, \"On the Original Structure and Meaning of <em>Mah Nishtannah</em> and the History of its Reinterpretation\" (JSIJ 7 [2008], 163-204). The article can be read online <a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/JS/JSIJ/7-2008/Steiner.pdf\">here</a>, and I summarise it below.</p>\n\n<p>There are at least three different ways of construing the number of questions in the <em>Mah Nishtanah</em>, at least one of which provides answers. The differences in interpretation boil down to three different ways of construing the word <em>mah</em> (מה), and three different ways of construing the particle <em>she-</em> (ש). Those different interpretations are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1) <em>Mah</em> (מה) = \"What?\"; <em>she-</em> (ש) = \"[such] that\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"What differentiates this night from all other nights, such that\n  [examples A, B, C, D]?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This interpretation of the two lexemes (<em>mah</em> and <em>she-</em>) has great precedent, and elicits a reading of the text in which there is a single question: what is it about this night to have produced these four differences between it and all others?</p>\n\n<p>2) <em>Mah</em> (מה) = \"Why?\"; <em>she-</em> (ש) = \"for\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Why is this night different from all other nights? For, [examples A?\n  B? C? D?]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the best attested interpretation of the text, although it too can be understood in three different ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Four questions: why is this night different in respect of example A? In respect of example B? In respect of example C? etc;</li>\n<li>Five questions: Why is this night different from all other nights? Why do we do example A? Why do we do example B? etc;</li>\n<li>One question, <strong>and four answers</strong>: Why is this night different from all other nights? Because of example A, because of example B, because of example C and because of example D.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>3) <em>Mah</em> (מה) = \"How!\"; <em>she-</em> (ש) = \"for\" (idiomatically, \"why\")</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"How different this night is from all other nights! Why, [examples A!\n  B! C!

Where the first (1) asks about the general nature of the evening, and the second (2.1) about the specific things that we are doing, the third (2.2) combines them both together.

The only dipping he observed so far was Karpas which was only so that he should ask.</p>\n\n<p>[Presumibly he means that the Matza and Morror he observes with Yachatz and on the Seder plate.]</p>\n\n<p>He then brings the Abarbanel's answer (Zevach Pesach on Avadim HaYinu) that the answer is that tonight we are making a remembrance for two times in the life of our forefathers in Egypt. At the beginning of the night, we were slaves, therefore we do remembrances of slavery - the Matzah and the Morror. Then Hashem took us out, so we dip twice and lean while eating to commemorate the freedom.</p>\n\n\n",

If you are going to spend the money, then that is defined as a loan and any fee for that 'rental' is 'ribis'. Renting property means that you return the same property that you rented, such as renting a tractor to plow your field. That is why there is a discussion as to borrowing flour to make a cake and when, if the price changes, returning the same amount of flour is or is not ribis. Trying to use English syntax and calling the use of the money 'rent' does not change the halacha.</p>\n\n<p>@Fred points to <a href=\"http://www.rarecoingallery.com/NewsResources/SmithsonianInstitution/SmithsonianExhibit.aspx\">Legendary Coins and Currency</a> as a valid use of coins that can be rented rather than loaned.

Thank you @DoubleAA for correcting it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It depends on what you mean by \"use,\" because the mode of use (both actual and contractual - see <em>Shach</em> YD 176:1) affects whether the money is considered \"loaned\" or \"rented.\" In a loan, the money is generally meant to be used financially and may be replaced with equivalent currency. In such a case, the laws prohibiting lending on interest apply.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the actual same (not merely equivalent) item of physical currency is to be returned, and if the borrower is using it for a non-financial, non-transactional purpose (e.g. displaying it for a museum show), then the money may be rented for a fee (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5151\"><em>Shulchan Aruch</em> YD 176:1</a>). </p>\n\n<p>See <em>The Laws of Ribbis</em> (<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=Awn9ldRs3mAC&pg=PA195#v=onepage&q&f=false\">pp. 195-196</a>) by R' Yisroel Reisman for more details.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chometz less than the size of a Kezayis\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>ב\"ה<br/>\nI've heard when cleaning for Pesach that chometz that is less than the size of a kezayis isn't significant enough to be considered chometz. I am talking only concerning chometz which one isn't eating on Pesach but may see. Is this a true idea? </p>\n\n<p>This question comes up certainly with cleaning one's car because there is always small crumbs found in the car and it is physically impossible to get it out. So is chometz less than a kezayis a problem after one has nullified all one's chometz? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the explicit specifications of the <em>halakhah</em>, the only amount which is required by law to be removed is that of a <em>kezayith</em>. Or, if there are several pieces of <em>hamess</em> that, when gathered together, would equal the amount of a <em>kezayith</em> or more - in the same room - then it is required to remove them. (cf. Rambam, <em>Mishneh Thorah</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Hamess Umassah</em> 2:1ff; <em>Arokh HaShulhan</em>, <em>Hilkhoth Ta^aroveth Hamess wa-Hamess Nuqshah</em>, <em>Siman</em> 442:27ff)</p>\n\n<p>This still leaves two questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>What is the size of an olive (kezayith)?</em></strong> - <em>le-^aniyuth da^ati</em>, the <em>shiur</em> of an olive (<em>kezayith</em>) is between <strong>2cc-4cc</strong>, as are the \"medium-size\" (i.e. <em>Suri</em>) olives of today. (cf. <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Kelim</em> 17:8). The Rambam, although he details the other halakhic measures of Hazal (cf. <em>Mishneh Thorah</em>, <em>Hilkhoth ^Eruvin</em> 1:12), he never gives a definition of a <em>kezayith</em>, which almost certainly indicates that he felt that it's measure was self-evident. [See <a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/RationalistJudaism/TheEvolutionOfTtheOlive.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">HERE</a> for a full explanation of all sources and issues involved in this definition]</li>\n<li><strong><em>Can't a lot of crumbs be gathered into a kezayith?</em></strong> - Although the crumbs on a smooth floor might be able to swept together (and probably should be removed if possible), there are several considerations: a) crumbs embedded in carpet (as in the floor of most cars) are usually not able to be gathered - even by hand, b) Only hamess which is still <em>raui le-akhilah</em> are of concern and must be destroyed (cf. <em>Hilkhoth Hamess Umassah</em> 4:8), and c) when <em>hamess</em> is destroyed the declaration is to have it be considered \"like dust\" (Ibid. 2:2) and one method which is given for destroying <em>hamess</em> is to <em>porer wa-zoreh la-ruah</em> (\"reduce it to crumbs and cast it to the wind\" - Ibid. 3:11). </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thus, it seems that the crumbs in the floor and crevices of your car would not be an issue. Nullification in your heart and declaring it ownerless will suffice.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why there is no prophet among anyone now even though humans nowadays are hollier than ancient humans?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>To summarize</p>\n\n<p>I think average righteousness/holiness (what's the different) should correlate positively with number of prophet and negatively with violent rate. I am not seeing that correlation. We have far less violent rate and also far less prophets compared to our ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>According to an answer here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36501/is-cain-a-prophet\">Is Cain a prophet?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We generally have a broad intellectual awareness of Hashem and His\n  greatness, which should lead us to righteousness, but does not because\n  there is a block between our minds and our hearts, between our\n  knowledge and the roots of our actions, and the knowledge is not\n  firmly entrenched. This is what is called טמטום הלב. When the yetzer\n  hara wants to entice us, it just has to get us to \"ignore\" our\n  awareness of Hashem and convince ourselves that it isn't really bad,\n  or isn't so bad. The earlier generations did not have such a\n  disconnect. Their vast awareness directly impacted their way of life.\n  When the yetzer hara enticed them, its only option was to give them an\n  incredible desire for the sin. Like when we want something even when\n  we know it is wrong, it looks good and you have a desire for it even\n  with the knowledge that it is bad, the earlier generations were like\n  that for all temptations - it was an act of giving in, not an act of\n  self-deception.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That answer seems to suggest that God grant prophecy automatically based on holiness level instead of arbitrarily based on unknown criteria.</p>\n\n<p>So basically we all have potential to be prophets. Yet evil inclination get us away from it.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's compare current generations with biblical generations</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Murder/Genocide rate per 1000 population is lower. During Cain era, it's around 250 (25%) guys killed per 1000 population. Now, it's less than 1 I think.</li>\n<li>Robbery rate is lower. In fact, robbery comes from the word robe which means taking people's rob. Which lead to another issue</li>\n<li>We're more prosper than our ancestors. So swords do turn into plow figuratively now</li>\n<li>We must have far more awareness of Hashem now than before. We got internet, miyodeya, bible translations to various different languages, hermeneutics. Torah is copied electronically without error whatsoever. That is a rate far faster than ancient Torah copying.</li>\n<li>Our justice system is more just because of DNA analysis, forensic science, trial by jury. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Yet, <strong>despite</strong> all those</p>\n\n<p>We have far less prophets. We have none now.</p>\n\n<p>Ugh, why?</p>\n\n<p>I thought holier is like IQ. The higher the average IQ, the higher the number of super geniuses. This explains why many nobel prizes are won by jews. That's because jews have higher IQ average, and hence higher number of people that break say 150 tress hold.</p>\n\n<p>The same way, the higher the average holiness of people the higher chance one is a prophet. It's like bell curves. If people are holier and holier the percentage that reach the outlier of \"super holy\" will be higher too. </p>\n\n<p>Yet humans nowadays are holier than their ancestors. Less murder. Less robbery. More economic productivity. Less war. More awareness of everything, including Hashem, due to internet. Yet, less prophet.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There are 3 mistakes that form this question.</p>\n\n<p>The first is a misunderstanding of the intent of R' Dessler that I quoted in the cited answer. The point of his idea is exactly that - knowledge alone does <strong><em>not</em></strong> lead directly to piety, and no matter how much one knows, we don't relate to that knowledge the same way.  As you quoted from my answer there, <em>despite</em> our <strong>broad intellectual awareness</strong> we have a block between that being in our mind and being in our hearts.  A Bar Ilan CD contains TONS of Torah knowledge, but it has no impact on the character of the Bar Ilan CD.  We are all like that - we may have great intellectual awareness, but it remains disconnected from becoming internalized into our hearts and our decisions.  In short, IQ != holiness.</p>\n\n<p>The second mistake is that Rav Dessler was describing qualifications for prophecy.  Rav Dessler was only explaining how prophecy could come to someone who had just committed a severe crime.  He was not saying that therefore he was a prophet, rather that his sin did not <em>detract</em> from his prophet qualification because of immediate and complete repentance.</p>\n\n<p>The third mistake is that our knowledge is greater than that of the earlier generations.  I seriously doubt our knowledge, even with Mi Yodeya, comes close to those who spent their entire lives solely focused on understanding Torah.  With all of our gadgets and amassed wealth, we have less time, not more. This is combined with an ever-more broken chain of tradition.  Note that when we want to know the will of Hashem, we turn to the words of <em>earlier</em> generations and attempt to discern their opinions. If we have a greater body of Torah material to turn to, it is more the result of <em>less</em> clarity than anything else.  We may be the beneficiaries of more Torah to learn, but this is not a sign of greater Torah knowledge.</p>\n\n\n",

I assume that some of these differences are descended from differences that existed in Europe.  I am referring here to differences that seem to be intentional, not those from a shiliach tzibbur that cannot carry a tune or doesn't know the correct nusach for the service.  You can also hear these differences when a shatz that was raised in a different community leads a service.  When asking once such person, his response was \"Well, you sing the melody that you learned as a kid, in my case in Chicago.\"</p>\n\n<p>My question is, can anyone recommend a good book that lists or explains the different melodies that are used in different communities, ideally with sheet music.  For example, I would like to learn that xxx prayer was sung with this melody in Vilna, but this melody in Volhynia, and this melody in Frankfurt.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to request some books like this on an interlibrary loan from a college or cantorial school.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

The Egyptian superstition was that when being judged after death, a person's heart was weighed against a feather (the feather of Truth IIRC). If the heart was lighter, he was judged innocent. Thus, Pharaoh hardening his own heart can mean that he was guilty <strong>even in terms of his own beliefs</strong>. Hashem hardening his heart can therefore mean that Pharaoh is now punished by those means or that his refusal (in his own terms) to repent causes him to lose the ability to repent, or by moving along the path of error he has that much farther to go to return, ...</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shimshon Rafael Hirsch prefers the idea that Hashem helped strengthen Pharaoh so that he had free will and could make a totally objective decision.

But poverty and freedom are not contraditory ideas; on the contrary.

Through the side by side contrast emerges a greater understanding of what slavery is (under the whims and emotions of man) and what freedom is (under the system of mitzvoth that guide a person to a life of חכמה which is true freedom from the enslavement of the emotions).  You need both in מצה to compare and contrast.</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps the contrast shows the praise of Hashem as to the degree he saved us from the situation of slavery to that of freedom.  It shows the terrible situation we were in (eating like a poor person) to the freedom we were brought to.  This highlights Hashem’s providential assistance.  The contrast highlights the degree of Hashem’s assistance.  </p>\n\n<p>According to both of the above answers, the essential idea of מצה is the “freedom” element, the Slavery element is merely there to contrast and accentuate the ideas of the “Freedom”.   This is why Rabbi Gamliel only mentioned the idea of “freedom”, because this is the essential one. </p>\n\n\n",

One of the sections in that code is “Hilchot shechita”, laws of kosher slaughter. So the reference given was: See Maimonides’ code, laws of kosher slaughter, ch. such-and-such, paragraph such-and-such.

The main issue, as I see it, is about influence - how the children will interact, and who will influence who, and how much. It is also highly dependent on the people in question.  For example, it is very different if the intermarried family intends to raise their children as Jews as opposed to Christian or secular.</p>\n\n<p>A similar situation can be found in our tradition: Rashi (Genesis 32:23) quotes a Midrash that says that Yaakov should have married his daughter Dina to Esau, in the hopes that Dina would be a good influence on Esav and cause him to repent. However, Yaakov did not do so, perhaps fearing that Esau would be a bad influence on Dina, and cause her to sin.  </p>\n\n<p>The lesson is that one needs to carefully evaluate the situation, and use their judgement to determine whether the interactions will be beneficial (hopefully for everyone).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is also the issue that suddenly cutting off all contact with one's sister and her family is likely to cause tension and strife, which will probably be worse than occasional interactions.  I'd recommend that the families get together every so often, perhaps on the holidays, which provide a good framework and potentially beneficial topic of conversation.  But again, this needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As this case is deals with intimate family issues, I highly recommend that a person is such a situation speak to a rabbi who knows the families well and can properly evaluate the relevant <em>halachic</em> literature in light of their particular circumstances.  It is unlikely that there is a clear-cut halachic ruling on this issue, and I'm very hesitant to start quoting rulings and responsa that will probably not address each family's exact circumstances.</p>\n\n\n",

The pasuk that you reference is due to another reason. Abarbanel says that the reference is because the tribe of Judah was always counted separately because of their strength and the fact that they would eventually produce the king of the Bnai Yisrael. Thus, the army of the tribe of Judah was counted apart from the rest of the nation.</p>\n\n<p>After King Solomon died there was a rebellion against his son Rechavam. The \"10 Northern tribes\" seceded from the kingdom and formed their own under Yeravam ben N'vat. Benjamin and Judah remained loyal to Rechav'am. The Kohanim and Levi'im did not own land and remained connected to the Temple, though a number of Levi'im who lived in the Northern Kingdom were unable to move. A number of members of the ten tribes, remaining loyal to G0d, moved to the southern kingdom. The Northern Kingdom became known as \"Samaria\" after the capital city built by Omri.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, the northern kingdom was destroyed by Assyria and, in order to avoid rebellion, Assyria forced the residents of areas that it had conquered to be relocated elsewhere and the knowledge of where they are was lost.</p>\n\n<p>The nonHebrews that replaced them became known as \"Samaritans\".</p>\n\n<p>Since a number of members of the 10 tribes relocated to the kingdom of Judah, there were people who claimed to trace their ancestry to the original tribes, however in most cases that information is lost.</p>\n\n\n",

If not, what is the reasoning why, if it is only used for water (i.e., not coffee).  Would the same reasoning hold for a SodaStream dispenser?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I checked with my LOR tonight about the tea urn and he said that while it would be good if no chametz has touched it during the year (and it was kept away from where there is chametz), it would be better to have a different urn for Pesach. The main reason is that it is quite easy for chametz to have gotten on the urn sometime during the year.</p>\n\n<p>I asked my LOR about the Soda Stream and he said that the seltzer (unflavored) is usable on Pesach. However, If any of the flavors were added, then the bottles would not be acceptable. As a result, I got new bottles for Pesach and store them with the Pesach dishes. This was the psak of my rav and I did not ask for his reasoning. I think that it is probably because the CO2 is not derived from chametz, but you must CYLOR.</p>\n\n<p>There is a discussion at <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/carbon_dioxide_for_pesach.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carbon Dioxide for Pesach</a> which explains how CO2 generation was originally chametz, but nowadays is no longer a problem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With this understanding, we can now address the question of whether\n  carbon dioxide recovered from a chametz fermentation should be\n  forbidden on Pesach.  It turns out that the technology of recovering\n  carbon dioxide has steadily progressed over the past 100 years.  At\n  first scientists figured out how to liquefy the carbon dioxide\n  escaping from these reactions but had no effective method of purifying\n  these vapors.  As such, in those days, the liquid carbon dioxide\n  likely did have a carryover of taste from the beer or whisky it was\n  made from, and for that reason, the Poskim of that era concluded that\n  the carbon dioxide was forbidden on Pesach.  </p>\n  \n  <p>However, in the past 50 years, the industry has developed 5 different\n  methods of purifying the carbon dioxide6 – four while it is in the\n  gaseous state, and a fifth after it is liquefied – to the point that\n  nowadays carbon dioxide recovered from beer or whisky bears absolutely\n  no taste of the original liquid it was created from.  We can surmise\n  that that this change of facts is why when the question was presented\n  to Rav Auerbach, he ruled that it is surely permitted!  Rav Auerbach\n  appears to have held that a vapor/condensate only retains the status\n  of the original liquid if it also retains the taste of that liquid,\n  and since nowadays the carbon dioxide has absolutely no taste of the\n  original beverage, it is not forbidden as chametz.  [See the footnote\n  for an alternate explanation of these halachos.]7  </p>\n  \n  <p>Of the kashrus agencies we conferred with, we found that many chose to\n  take a strict approach and not allow carbon dioxide from chametz or\n  even kitnios (but they took varying approaches to verifying the source\n  of the carbon dioxide)8 but others came to the conclusion outlined\n  above that one may be lenient nowadays.9  Due to the (commendable)\n  strictness with which people traditionally treat questions of chametz,\n  the cRc only certifies seltzer or soda after verifying that the carbon\n  dioxide is not recovered from chametz (but does accept it from kitnios\n  sources).  While this may not be required on strict halachic grounds,\n  it is within the spirit of חומרא דפסח to be machmir on this matter.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Postscript  </p>\n  \n  <p>The following are some relevant facts about the current carbon dioxide\n  market:  </p>\n  \n  <p>Nowadays, beer companies typically do collect the carbon dioxide\n  vapors escaping from their fermenters for reuse in their products, and\n  it is very rare for them to sell the carbon dioxide to others.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Most whisky and ethanol produced in the United States is kitnios, not\n  chametz. Due to an overabundance of carbon dioxide byproduct, it is\n  uncommon for a producer (e.g. a whisky or ethanol plant) to recover\n  the carbon dioxide unless they have a specific buyer in mind.  In\n  fact, typically the carbon dioxide resellers are the ones who install\n  the collection equipment in the producer of their choice, and then\n  remain with that producer for many years.  As such, although many new\n  ethanol plants have opened up in the USA in recent years, it may take\n  many years before the carbon dioxide produced in those plants is ever\n  used in seltzer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Before communication and printing became so widespread, things weren't always so uniform and variations like these were a fact of life. As an example, the influential <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikraot_Gedolot#Published_editions\">Ben Hayyim edition of the Mikraot Gedolot (1524)</a> has #1,2,3,5,8,9 from above written the \"Temoni\" way. Granted that edition wasn't without its share of typos, but it was being printed in Venice, far away from Yemen, and probably was reflective of some local practices.</p>\n\n<p>To bring the point home, R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\">Moshe Isserles</a>, perhaps the epitome of an Ashkenazi rabbi, himself wrote a Torah scroll from a rare and expensive manuscript. (The story goes he bought it from R Yosef Karo from Safed.) The scroll and manuscript were kept securely in Crackow and highly venerated, before apparently being burned by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In the journal <a href=\"http://web.nli.org.il/sites/JPress/Hebrew/Pages/Hamegid.aspx\">HaMaggid</a> on April 28, 1858, someone reports that the Rama's Torah had 14 letter-differences from the other Torah scrolls commonly used there (* indicates the variant is also found in the 1524 Mikraot Gedolot): *Gen 4:13 מנשא; *Gen 7:11 מעינת; *Gen 9:29 ויהיו; *Gen 36:15 תומן; *Gen 39:22 האסורם; *Gen 41:14 וירצהו; *Gen 46:6 מקנהם; *Exo 10:9 ובזקננו; *Exo 28:26 האפד; *Exo 29:15 אהרון; Num 1:17 בשמת; Deu 13:12 וייראון; *Deu 23:2 דכא; *Deu 32:34 הלוא. None of those variants are in modern \"Ashkenazi\" scrolls. (There might be reasons to think that parts of that list are inaccurate, but it seems clear the Rama's Torah scroll wasn't the same as ours.)</p>\n\n<p>The relative uniformity of our scrolls today (as well as the notion that there is such a thing as an \"Ashkenazi\" tradition or a \"Sefardi\" tradition; it used to be a scribe would just seek out the best most reliable texts available to copy from, as the Rama did) is a relatively modern phenomenon, growing largely out of widespread distribution of mass printings and the work of certain rabbis to fix errors in them (to oversimplify <em>just</em> a bit). When the Rama (!) rules (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%9E%D7%92_%D7%93\">OC 143:4</a>) that we don't put back a Torah scroll for having extra/missing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_lectionis\">matres lectionis</a> because who says one scroll is better than the other, he wasn't just stating a hypothetical.</p>\n\n\n",

If one forgot, or the fourteenth of Nissan\n  fell on Shabbos, one may roast or cook them at night (after Yom Tov\n  has begun) (5). One must, however, eat them on the first day of the\n  festival. Similarly, on the second [Seder] night, one should roast or\n  cook them at night, but one must eat them on the second day of the\n  festival.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason for this is that one is not allowed to cook on Yom Tov for the second day of Yom Tov, for Shabbos, or for a week day. Thus, if one did not eat the zeroa on Yom Tov, one would have cooked 'shelo letzorech' (if it was just thrown out and never eaten) or violated hachana (if it was eventually eaten).

    "content": "# Why are women obligated in maggid?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why are women obligated to say over the story of pesach on pesach if its a time bound mitzva? By matza there is a special derasha used. and the other mitzvos are Rabbinical, so you can say since they were involved in the miracle. But by maggid its a torah mitzva which is time bound. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The source of the obligation for women to say the Haggadah is from the Talmud in Pesachim 108a, which says that they are obligated in the four cups because they were part of the miracle.</p>\n\n<p>Although according to the Rashbam (Pesachim 117b) and the Meiri, the cups are an independent matter to show freedom, and therefore there is no clear derivation that women are obligated in the Haggadah, Tosfos (Sukkah 38a מי שהיה) says that the cups are there in order to say Hallel and the Haggadah on them. In other words, if they are obligated to drink the cups, it is because they are obligated in what the cups are connected to - Hallel and the Haggadah (See חידושי הגרי\"ז פ\"ז חו\"מ הלכה ז).</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (7:6) and the Rif have a different approach, which according to Rav Chaim Brisker is that there are two obligations in drinking the cups - freedom and as a cup of blessing on what is said on them. So again, from here women are obligated in both aspects of the cups.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch (472:4) says women are obligated in everything of the night, which, as the Mishna Brurah (:45) explains it, includes the Haggadah. The Ramo (473:6) says that the Haggadah should be translated so that women and children understand it. The Mishna Brurah (:64) explains again that the women are obligated to say the Haggadah.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for the obligation is that \"they were also part of the miracle.\" [This point is explicitly made in Shulchan Aruch HaRav 472:25]. The Rashbam (Pesachim 108b) explains that the miracle was in the merit of the righteous women, and in their merit all of Israel was saved. Tosfos (Megilah 4a) argues (because the word \"also\" implies something secondary - Sefas Emes Megila 4a שאף הן) and says that they were saved together with the rest of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>It is a Machlokes Rishonim if the reason of \"they were also part of the miracle\" can mean that they have a Torah obligation, or if that reason is only enough to say the obligation is Rabbinic. The Pri Megadim explains the two answers of Tosfos (Megilah 4a שאף הן) to why the Gemara learns that women are obligated in Matzah from a Posuk when there is the reason of \"they were also part of the miracle\" differ on if the obligation is from the Torah or is Rabbinic.</p>\n\n<p>Not to get sidetracked into the details of why, but some limiting principle needs to be applied to when this reason creates a Torah obligation. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It is limited to when women were saved as part of the miracle (so there is no obligation to sit in a Sukkah, even though they were protected by the clouds in the Midbar - מהר\"ם ב\"ר ברוך ח\"ג סימן תעג עמ' סו).</p></li>\n<li><p>If the Torah explicitly exempts women, this reason can't obligate them (so Sukkah and Tefillin [which are connected to the Exodus] have explicit exemptions associated with them - דבר שמואל להרה\"ג רבי שמואל אליעזרוב זצ\"ל פסחים קח, ב על תוס' ד\"ה היו באותו הנס). </p></li>\n<li><p>This only applies when the Mitzva involves telling over the miracle (מרומי שדה להנצי\"ב מגילה ד, א ד\"ה שאף היו - this opinion is explain at length by Rav Yosef Beir Soliveitchik in מבית מדרשו של הרב עמ' יא. מסורה חוברת ב,תשנ. וברשימות שיעורים סוכה עמ' יא.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another approach to say that this is a Torah obligation comes from the Maraham Shik on his book on the 613 Mitzvos (Mitzvah 21, #2) - because it is a branch of the Mitzvah of Matzah. Since women are obligated in Matzah as learned from a Posuk, and Matzah is called Lechem Oni <em>in this very posuk</em> - and Rashi says (Pesachim 36a) that this means complete hallel and say on it the Haggadah.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach to say that this is a Torah obligation comes according to the commentary of Rav Y. P. Perlow on Sefer HaMitzvos from the Rasag (Part 1 pg. 31) where he explains the Ramban's opinion (Kiddushin 34a) that Sefiras HaOmer is not a time bound positive Mitzvah - because the Torah doesn't say \"on this and this day of Nissan\" count the omer. Rather it attaches it to the Omer, which is in turn attached to a specific time. Similarly the Haggadah is said at the time of בעבור זה - when there is the obligation of the Pesach, Matzah and Morror.</p>\n\n<p>However according to the Chayei Adam (Hilchos Pesach 130:12) and implied in the Shulchan Aruch HaRav (472:25) as explained by the Lubavitcher Rebbe (Haggadah Shel Pesach סימן מגיד), the obligation is, in fact paskened to be Rabbinic.</p>\n\n<p><sup>Sources for this answer are quoted from הגדה כחלכה by הרב יסוף יצחק כ\"ץ.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Keeping Kosher and Leather\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would like to ask a question regarding something I am quite confused by. Why is it okay to wear leather from an animal slaughtered not in a kosher fashion yet you cannot eat that animal's meat? To simplify this question and keep it in context, let's keep this as our primary example. I think a cow would be the perfect jumpoff point for this question. If I understand correctly, the primary reason Jewish people cannot eat just any beef/meat from a cow is that it must be slaughtered in a humane way, according to certain laws, in order to spare the animal undue pain and suffering. Assuming this is the primary reason for this specific example, why is wearing the skin of this animal (cow) which may or may not have been slaughtered in a kosher way okay?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The short answer \"Because G0d said so\"</p>\n\n<p>The longer explanation, fills up volumes of books explaining \"why\" Hashem said so. You can start with Maimonides \"Moreh L'nivuchim' (Guide for the Perplexed), as well as all the books that comment on it. While one of the reasons for the laws <strong>may</strong> include the humane treatment, the laws of ritual slaughter are not just for humane reasons, or for health reasons, or for any other possible reason, but for raising the meat that we eat to the level of a sacrifice (again among others). The requirement to treat an animal humanely is a separate restriction and applies no matter if the animal is to be eaten or not. Thus the requirement not to cause \"tza'ar baalei chaim\" (pain to living creatures) would require one to kill an animal humanely, whether by kosher slaughter or some other means.</p>\n\n<p>Note also that there are many means of slaughtering humanely (although shechitah seems to be the most humane) none of which will allow a Jew to eat the meat. Additionally, if a person treats an animal inhumanely, but does not cause it to develop signs of treifus (such as lung lesions), then the meat would still be kosher after shechitah. On the other hand, if he treats it completely humanely and just misses cutting both the windpipe and the esophagus (to the 51% mark) by just a fraction (such as 49.99999% rather than 50.0000001%) the animal is not kosher.</p>\n\n<p>Given that the Torah does not forbid the use of an animal that has not been slaughtered by shechitah (it is mutar b'hana'ah) we see that if someone has violated the laws of \"humane treatment\", then he is the one who has done wrong. The sin does not attach to the object. Note that the Torah has to explicitly forbid the use of meat cooked in milk (for a non food purpose) (asur be-hana'ah) as well as forbidding the actual cooking itself. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Basically, the Bible says only eat it if it was killed properly. If it died any other way, you can feed it to your pet (i.e. you can derive benefit from it), just don't eat it. The same would apply to a cow that died of old age! There are only three categories of dead animals -- \"kosher slaughtered\"; \"kosher slaughtered but it was going to die soon anyhow of disease or injury\"; and \"died some other way.\"</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, eating something signifies a deeper connection.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Something which is surprisingly not mentioned by most of the commentators here is that the basic reason why do most of the complicated laws of kosher killing of animals exist is to get sure that the animal was really killed because of the human action, not died because of a unrelated disease. This follows from a general prohibition of eating meat of animals which died because of natural causes (see Shemoth 22:30, Dvarim 14:21).</p>\n<p>The test example is the following. Assume you find a corpse of a cow in a forest. Will you be allowed to eat its meat? Surely you won't.  Will you be allowed to use its leather for you clothes? Why, on Earth, not?!</p>\n<p>The explanation that shchita minimises animal's suffering is probably very modern (and, honestly speaking, a bit controversial).

I, of course want to enhance our 'Jewish' experiences and wouldn't want to retract from her avodah in this way. I don't feel that things should be overburdensome but I do understand that it is hard to change the ways in which we were brought up.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has advice that would be much appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Based on 45+ years of marriage, I can assure you that whatever you say to your wife (other than the two most important words in a marriage) would probably not help. Rabbi Moshe Heinemann in his pre-pesach shiurim will emphasize that you do not have to go overboard (and the women do not accept that). Rabbi Avigdor Miller in his tapes on the subject tries to explain that it is counterproductive to be paranoid about chametz and even more counterproductive for you to 'tell your wife what to do'. The then Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Yisroel once told us about a different matter (about 20 years ago) that when he told his about to be wed students that prewedding pictures are mutar, they would not listen to him.</p>\n\n<p>If your wife has a rav that she respects and listens to, you might try to get him to get her to ease off. However, this might just cause her to go to someone else for advice and would just make it more difficult for her to accept advice in other matters.</p>\n\n<p>One cannot change a person's character and the husband is often the last person a wife will listen to regarding the difference between \"Spring Cleaning\" and \"Getting Rid of Chametz\". Of course some women consider the prePasach time the best time for Spring Cleaning in any event.</p>\n\n<p>The only way I can suggest is to find the appropriate Avigdor Miller tape to play for her (without letting her think you are criticizing her) and remember what he says are the two most important words in a marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Oh yes, those two words?  <strong>Yes Dear</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/h/pes/l/48970611.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aish.com’s article on Passover Cleaning Made Easy</a> says in part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'd like to not only make Passover cleaning a little easier, but above\n  all to change the attitude once and for all to stop being frightened.\n  Passover is not a monster. It's the most beautiful time of the year.</p>\n  \n  <p>One crumb of edible chametz cannot remain in your house and you've got\n  to destroy it. Also, anything that contains ethyl alcohol, since it\n  can be distilled, is called \"edible chametz\" and must also be disposed\n  of.</p>\n  \n  <p>We are also looking for something that is more than a kezayit --\n  regardless of whether you would consider it food or not. If it's less\n  than a kezayit of non-edible chametz, you don't have to get rid of it\n  because you consider it dirt. Also, if it's something even a dog\n  wouldn't eat, then even more than a kezayit is not problematic.</p>\n  \n  <p>When you're cleaning for Passover, all the goodies in your freezer and\n  cabinets -- bread, cakes, crackers -- all of that is chametz. You have\n  to get rid of it one way or another. But aside from that, you probably\n  won't find much edible chametz in your house. Bedikat chametz,\n  therefore, is not so difficult. In the bedrooms, for example, you\n  don't have to sit with a pin scraping the corners!</p>\n  \n  <p>Even further: Let's say you have gook stuck to your chametz dishes. If\n  the stuff is non-edible, then you can forget about it -- as long as it\n  does not total a kezayit of gook. But there is no need sit there and\n  scrub the dishes with steel wool. Just make sure there is no edible\n  stuff on them, and no kezayit of gook -- and put them away.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>One important point: If you feel like going beyond the limit and scraping the walls and ceiling, go right ahead. Of course it's not\n  required, but the halacha is actually stated in Shulchan Aruch that no\n  one is allowed to laugh at you. In the words of the rabbis, Yisrael\n  kedoshim heim -- \"Jews are holy\" when they go beyond the letter of the\n  law.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Be careful, however, not to go so far that you develop an antagonistic\n  attitude toward Passover. If all this extra, non-required cleaning is\n  going to make you dread the holiday, then forget about it. And\n  certainly you should not clean so much that you're exhausted for the\n  Passover Seder. Part of being \"holy\" is appreciating the holiday, too!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This rational approach is for your wife with the paragraph in bold especially for you. </p>\n\n<p>Extracts from the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/77428/jewish/An-Easy-Life.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chabad article, “An Easy Life”</a> are for both of you:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Weeks of intense labor have brought us to this moment. There is so\n  much to do, so little time, and failure to finish not an option.</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is when the thought first occurs to me. What an incredibly\n  easy religion. I don't say it aloud; to do so would elicit hostile\n  stares from all the exhausted people in the room. They're all\n  thinking, \"I can't do this anymore, this is insane, remind me next\n  year to move to Antarctica.\" My body feels close to collapse as well,\n  but my mind is thinking, Man, He is one smart G-d. </p>\n  \n  <p>The forty minutes are drawing to a close and we gather around the fire\n  to see the final stage in the banishment of chametz from our homes,\n  and to recite the prayer banishing the chametz from our hearts. The\n  brief lull brings the realization of this as the apex of our labors,\n  and there is a light in the eyes of my family that isn't just a\n  reflection of the dying flames.</p>\n  \n  <p>And then there's Judaism, unchanged and unchanging for over three\n  millennia, that teaches theory and philosophy and inner journeys, but\n  demands action. Passover represents the freeing of the soul from the\n  things which clog it up and obstruct its brightness. How do we do\n  that? By meditating about it? Sure, that too. But mostly with\n  back-breaking, hand-chaffing labor. The physical kind.</p>\n  \n  <p>How does this replace the spiritual journey? It doesn't. It takes the\n  spiritual journey out of heaven, and makes it real by bringing it down\n  to this world. I can sit and contemplate for hours, but when all is\n  said and done (or rather, thought) I know I remain, essentially,\n  unchanged. But then I take a physical broom and chase the chametz from\n  my room, use my physical hands to clean, my physical body to do. And\n  day by day, I feel the chametz being chased from my heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If it is not impertinent to say, I think your relationship with your wife is all-important. </p>\n\n<p>I wish that we may all together free our souls from the things which clog them up!</p>\n\n\n",

Please consult the rabbi of that synagogue (or your rabbi, if you have one) to ask what it is proper for you to do; the community here at Mi Yodeya can't address personal <em>p'sak halacha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, it would be possible for your entire family to convert together if they are willing to take on that obligation.  You'll need to consult a rabbi about that, but don't rule it out just because you currently have a non-Jewish wife if she's open to changing that along with you.

For example, Orthodox typically avoid\n  use of an umbrella on Shabbat due to the prohibitions against erecting a tent (in miniature), and\n  carrying (where there is no eruv). Although opening an umbrella does not seem to have been\n  formally addressed by the Law Committee, it appears to me that most (but not all)\n  Conservative Jews use umbrellas, sometimes reflecting lack of knowledge or concern but\n  sometimes reflecting the view that it is not really erecting a tent. The point here is that there are\n  many Shabbat restrictions and other laws that have not been addressed by the Law\n  Committee, and my observation of prevalent practice among some observant Conservative\n  Jews indicates an implied lenient halachic view concerning many practices.

(Chagiga 2b)  However, determining whether a person is a <em>shoteh</em> must be done on a case-by-case basis.  Please see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14371/who-is-a-shoteh\">Who is a Shoteh?</a> and the sources below for more information.</p>\n\n<p>In particular,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a result of this characterization of the shoteh as one who lacks understanding, the shoteh receives a general exemption from all mitzvot. This exemption applies to both positive commandments as well as negative commandments. The gemara details particular examples of mitzvot from which the shoteh is exempted, including the reading of the megilla and pilgrimage to the Temple. Furthermore, the shoteh is exempt from participation in communal obligations such as zimun before Birkat Ha-mazon.

However, this is unclear, as their actions lack the necessary level of cognitive intent (see Chulin 12b).

The functionally impaired shoteh is not burdened unnecessarily by obligations which would only serve either to add a further stress to an already challenged psychological state of mind, potentially exacerbating the clinical picture, or to impede recovery from a current disabling psychotic illness.

Paraoh believed in many false gods the sun the mazalas(stars) especially the sign of Nissan the lamb, he believed he gained strength from these things. So Barad blocked the sun there was no sun by makka arbeh and by chosech as well. By makkas Bechoros it was at night, and the mazal for the month is the bechor of all mazalos.

This applies to <em>Writings.</em>  The third level includes secular works, which do not have any divine inspiration.</p>\n\n<p>Books written by great rabbis <em>on Torah subjects</em> are generally accepted to be on the second level, \"divinely inspired.\"  This is because they become part of the <em>Oral Law,</em> the grand tradition that interprets and explains the Word of God.  It is accepted that any work which interprets the Word of God itself has some divinity, and is thus \"divinely inspired.\"  Of course, depending on who you ask and the perceived stature of the rabbi in question, a work could be considered to have more or less divine inspiration.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides wrote many books.  Those which are secular in nature, such as his works on medicine, are considered <em>not</em> to have been composed with divine inspiration.  Those works, such as the Mishne Torah, which deal with Jewish law and tradition, <em>are</em> considered to have an element of divine inspiration.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Addendum:</em></p>\n\n<p>There are opinions which hold that <em>everything</em> is divinely inspired - every action, every object, etc, but these are a minority.</p>\n\n<p>There are differing opinions as to whether the writings and sayings of truly great rabbis, such as those in the Talmud, on secular subjects are also divinely inspired.  For example, please see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/30509/rabbinic-speculations-on-history/\">Rabbinic speculations on history</a> .</p>\n\n<p>Many Progressive Jews believe that the Torah and Prophets are not necessarily the literal Word of God, but are merely divinely inspired.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Maimonides, and his works, were quite controversial when they first came out.  Those who disagreed with him would have obviously assumed that they were not divinely inspired.  Since then, we've accepted his works as part of our tradition.</p>\n\n<p>(Divine inspiration is also considered to be at play in the determination of which works become part of the tradition.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>in Pirkei Avot <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/682522/jewish/English-Text.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ch.6</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Rabbi Meir would say: Whoever studies Torah for Torah's sake alone,\n  merits many things; not only that, but [the creation of] the entire\n  world is worthwhile for him alone. He is called friend, beloved, lover\n  of G-d, lover of humanity, rejoicer of G-d, rejoicer of humanity. The\n  Torah enclothes him with humility and awe; makes him fit to be\n  righteous, pious, correct and faithful; distances him from sin and\n  brings him close to merit. From him, people enjoy counsel and wisdom,\n  understanding and power, as is stated (Proverbs 8:14): \"Mine are\n  counsel and wisdom, I am understanding, mine is power.\" The Torah\n  grants him sovereignty, dominion, and jurisprudence. <strong>The Torah's\n  secrets are revealed to him, and he becomes as an ever-increasing\n  wellspring and as an unceasing river</strong>. He becomes modest, patient and\n  forgiving of insults. The Torah uplifts him and makes him greater than\n  all creations...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence any Jew who studies the torah diligently and in purity, following the 48 ways the torah is acquired as explained there in details. The degree that the divine secrets will be revealed to him is according to how high he has ascended the ladder of purity and diligence as explained there. see also the book <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/28786/1857\">Path of the Just</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam is to be viewed as a torah scholar who studied \"torah lishma\" with tremendous dedication and ascended this ladder to a high degree. Hence, his works in torah are to be viewed as torah-true.</p>\n\n<p>His other works in medicine though are to be viewed as following the science of his era. God has a plan in the world and He had a reason for withholding the technological and medical breakthroughs which we have seen in the past 200 years. (my guess is to limit man's destructive power. technology may seem good now, but in 100 or 200 years we may look back and conclude that it was not a good thing. it can really bring <em>tremendous</em> destruction.)</p>\n\n\n",

The idea is that God must have preserved his scripture. When later we found that popular copies and translations of the Bible are different from the original, people say that the original must be inerrant, whatever that means.</p>\n\n<p>However, some books in the Bible are not original.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28466/why-is-chronicles-so-similar-to-kings?noredirect=1#comment97550_28466\">Why is Chronicles so similar to Kings?</a>, Chronicles and Kings are definitely compiled books. That's why they have word-to- word similarity.</p>\n\n<p>The original is <em>gone</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What is Judaism’s view of this? Some books are definitely not original. They are compiled from older, lost, sources. Yet they are part of the Tanach.</p>\n\n<p>Before, we had the idea of divine inspiration wherein God inspired the Bible and hence made it inerrant. Now we have a divine compiler/redactor? Or what? What's next? Divine editor? Divine modifier? Divine sanctioner? Divine censurers? Divine translators? Divine error copiers? Divine tikune soferimer? </p>\n\n<p>How do we reconcile the idea that the \"original\" Bible is inerrant and complete with the fact that some books are not even original and the original is lost?</p>\n\n<p>Why didn't God tell people to write the final version of the holy book right from the beginning? Why the book has to \"evolve\" first into it's final form and somehow become holy. What? God didn't get it right the first time?</p>\n\n<p>If somebody latter \"compile\" Torah, and add Mickey Mouse story, how do we know that the latter compilation is the holy one instead of the original?</p>\n\n<p>The same way, what about if the original book that form chronicle should have been the holy one but lost? Then we would have trouble with God preserving tanach theory right? Or, do God preserve Tanach at all? Christians believe it.

This is part of kesuvim and not neviyim so it is \"inspired\" but not prophecy.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the psalms were compiled by King David but the individual psalms started from Adam and continued.</p>\n<p>Jeremiah wrote the book of Kings (using prophecy) as well as his own book and Lamentations.</p>\n<p>King Chizkiya and his bais din wrote Yeshayah (from the prophecies given and passed down by Yeshaya) and canonized Mishlai, Shir Hashirim, and Koheles (which had been passed down from King Solomon).</p>\n<p>The Anshei Kneses Hagedolah (Men of the Great Assembly) canonized the prophecies of Yechezkel, and the twelve \"minor prophets\" as well as Daniel (from his writings) and the Megilas Esther. Ezra whote his own sefer as well as the geneology in Divrei Hayamim, which was finished by Nechemiah.</p>\n<p>The \"question\" that you have about compilation misunderstands the situation. The original prophecies were written by the prophets and kept without change until they were canonized. There were no changes after the Anshei Kneses Hagedolah (at the start of the second temple era)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>We have a tradition that Psalms, for example, has multiple authors — as one might surmise from its incipits. Yet it has the imprimatur of holy men, who had divine inspiration in compiling it. Likewise for some other books of the Bible. There is no contradiction in that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many people believe that the Tanach is completely inerrant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Orthodox Jews (generally) believe that the <em>Torah</em> (Pentateuch), as the literal \"Word of God,\" dictated directly from God to Moses, is inerrant.  (I'm assuming \"inerrant\" means that everything is factually accurate. <strong>$</strong>)  The <em>Prophets</em> and <em>Writings</em> are the works of <em>people</em> - composed, edited, and compiled by people.  <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_15.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bava Basra 14b-15a</a> <strong>#</strong>) Therefore, even though they are written with \"Divine Inspiration,\" they are <em>not</em> inerrant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now we have a divine compiler/redactor? Or what? What's next? Divine editor?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, <em>Yes.</em>  Anything having to do with \"Torah\" and holy books are considered to have an element of \"divine inspiration\" involved in the process.  This is known as <em>ruach hakodesh,</em> and it is believed that God, in his mysterious ways, 'inspired' or had a hand in the composition of the book.

    "content": "# Selling chametz, and rotze b'kiyumo\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As codified in, e.g., <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 450:24, it's forbidden to put oneself in a situation that he desires the continued existence of <em>chametz</em> on <em>Pesach</em> because its nonexistence would cause him some loss.</p>\n\n<p>Most Jews nowadays sell our <em>chametz</em> at a fair market value (or so) before <em>Pesach</em> and buy it back after <em>Pesach</em>. Thus, if it is lost on <em>Pesach</em>, we will get paid for it by its owner; so we don't desire its continued existence. However:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Suppose someone has (<em>lo alenu</em>!) a house fire or other loss, and his <em>chametz</em> is destroyed on <em>Pesach</em>. Will he <em>really</em> be paid for it by the gentile purchaser: is that what's done in practice? (Surely such a situation has come up.) And if not, then it seems he's desirous of the <em>chametz</em>'s continued existence, since he'll incur loss if it's lost.</li>\n<li>What about <em>chametz</em> with sentimental value? Can one sell that before <em>Pesach</em>? After all, he seems to desire its continued existence.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Do any <em>pos'kim</em> discuss these issues?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The second question is discussed in a Teshuva <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49833&st=&pgnum=106&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> by Rabbi Yoel Brach. The question under discussion is a business that buys a bunch of Chametz inventory right before Pesach and then does the traditional Mechiras Chametz.</p>\n\n<p>On the question of that clearly the business wants that inventory to exist, he says a few points, prefaced by the fact that Chametz owned by a non-Jew, on the property of a non-Jew, is explicitly allowed in Shluchan Aruch to be under a Jew's responsibility (that is, if it is lost, the Jew has to pay for it - [this part actually address the first question, even though the Jew is responsible for losses, that is still OK, although as he goes into it, it is necessary to make the sale in such a way that the non-Jew rents the space where the Chametz is, which is pretty standard practice, AFAIK]), thus showing that the Jew wants the Chametz to remain:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>One answer is that it is only a problem if he benefits from the Chametz proper (unlike Idolotry issues), on Pesach (this has two variation, either because he is getting paid, or because the Chametz preserves his vessels).</p></li>\n<li><p>Others hold that as long as no action is taken with the Chametz, it is not a problem.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some hold explicitly that since the Chametz is sold before Pesach, there is no issue with HaRotzeh BeKiyumo (with some dispute if the sale can happen Erev Pesach - so that isn't of help for the standard Mechiras Chametz case except according to some).</p></li>\n<li><p>But there are still opinions that hold it is a problem. However, all agree that after Pesach it is not an issue of Chametz Sheavar Alav HaPesach.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>He then <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49833&st=&pgnum=110&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">goes on</a> to discuss Chametz of sentimental value.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>He brings reasons to say that a sale doesn't help, even according to the majority of Poskim who think a standard pro-forma sale of Chametz is completely legitimate.</p></li>\n<li><p>He brings opinions that this would run afoul of HaRotze BeKiyumo more so than standard Chametz.</p></li>\n<li><p>He brings a \"weak\" (his word) justification for selling such sentimental value Chametz in that the person has no intention of ever eating it, so it is already \"botul\".</p></li>\n<li><p>Along the lines of that justification he talks about sealing the Chametz away to the point where it wouldn't be accessible. Then, according to that idea, it wouldn't even need to be sold.</p></li>\n<li><p>(Not in this Teshuva, but I have heard of another solution to the sentimental value Chametz problem - leave it in a hefker place and make it hefker - and hope no one takes it - not sure how that would play out vis-a-vis Rotzeh BeKiyumo, I guess it isn't worse than selling it before Pesach (point #3 in the other section above)).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So the upshot is that the sentimental value Chametz is better off burnt and derive the sentiment from the ashes.</p>\n\n<p>(On the question in the Teshuva, he says to be strict and not do it unless there is a specific great loss or difficulty - comparing it more to the sentimental Chametz - because the business wants the inventory's immediate availability after Pesach and would not be happy if the sale actually completed).</p>\n\n\n",

It is simply adding another detail about the Seder, namely, that we invite poor people, not that this is the invitation. \nIn fact, if one does interpret it as an invitation, than there is a far more obvious question than why we do it after kiddush: Why do we do it where nobody will hear, inside our homes?

(As an aside, modern scholars generally believe that Jesus was born some years before \"year 1\".)</p>\n\n<p>Even if it is not a coincidence, there does not appear to be any significance to these dates.  And even if there was, and God indeed chose these dates, there are many more significant dates He could have chosen, such as the dates when the Israelites entered the Land of Israel, or were given the Torah at Mt Sinai, or the building of the Temple, etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Among Jews of a more mystical hashkafa, such as chassidim and many others, there is no such thing as a coincidence. This view -- that everything happens for a reason -- was strongly stated by the Baal Shem Tov, but is also discernible in previous sources (such as Rabbi Akiva's \"Gamzu L'Tovah\" story in the Gemara, and statements by rabbis such as Rabbeinu Bachya and R' Avraham ben Rambam.) </p>\n\n<p>In addition, the more specific idea that Hashem send us \"hints\" is also found in rabbinic literature (For example, \"Think about the thoughts, words and deeds that God sends you each day in order to understand His hints to you to draw closer to Him at every moment.\" Likutey Moharan I, 54.)</p>\n\n<p>To more rationalist Jews, of course, the 1948 parallelism between the founding of modern Israel and Avraham Avinu's birth would be nothing more than a coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>More mystically-inclined Jews could argue that it does in fact have a meaning. Since Hashem first promised the Land of Israel to Avraham, it may be a sign that the creation of the state is the fulfillment of His promise that the Jews would inherit the land.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that 1948 is on the Christian calendar may pose difficulty to some, who may have trouble understanding why G-d would send messages through another religion's calendar. Yet logically, since G-d is all-powerful, it is not beyond His power to send subtle messages to Jews through another religion's calendar. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the use of the Christian calendar was meant to hint that the mistreatment that Jews had suffered at the hands of Christians for 2000 years, culminating in the Holocaust, was now coming to an end, as the Jews returned to their divinely-promised homeland. In addition, the use of the Christian calendar could have been meant to hint to Christians that Hashem is still honoring His promises to the Jewish people, which could potentially induce Christians to become less anti-Semitic or more supportive of Israel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Reading the Bible literally, Genesis 9:28 explains that after the flood (which occurred in 1656), Noah lived for 350 years. Abraham was born in 1948. This is also the date for the modern state of Israel. Coincidence? Actually, the Bible never explicitly states the date of Abraham’s birth. </p>\n\n\n",

In this case, since I know that I am being referenced (even if no one else does) then it would indeed be <em>lashon Hara</em> and <em>malbin pnei chaveiro</em>. If you make up a name that no-one knows, then it is \"cursing a deaf person\".</p>\n\n<p>In either case both are asur and the person causing the embarrassment has violated the commandment in the Torah. The Chafetz Chaim points out that unless there is a necessity (such as preventing a crime) one must not speak <em>lashon hara</em> (which implies that the statement is true). Of course if the statement is not true, then it is <em>motzi shem ra</em> which is forbidden as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First, a look at the sources.</p>\n\n<p>You reference Sanhedrin 99b, as a source that it is forbidden to embarrass others. This is the relevant passage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אפיקורוס. רבי ורבי חנינא אמרי תרוייהו: זה המבזה תלמיד חכם. רבי יוחנן ורבי יהושע בן לוי אמרי: זה המבזה חבירו בפני תלמיד חכם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two opinions are cited regarding the identity of the epikoros. Either one who shames a talmid hakham, or one who shames someone else in front of a Torah scholar.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam (Hilkhot Teshuva 3:14) rules in accordance with the first view. (Although he does include other cases of embarrassing others, as well).</p>\n\n<p>However, this is all moot, since the issue of who is called an epikoros is independent of the question of what is and is not permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding what is and is not permitted, using words to hurt other people is forbidden whether or not it is in front of a Torah scholar. (cf. Leviticus 25:17, Sefer HaMitsvot neg. 251, Hilkhot Teshuva 7:8).</p>\n\n<p>This includes making someone feel stupid by emphasising his lack of knowledge (Perush HaMishna on Bava Metzia 4:10). While it is hard to prove the negative, these sources do not differentiate between whether the person ought to be offended by the jabs; they seem to forbidden regardless, if other person is hurt. (Incidentally it could be argued that having one's shortcomings highlighted is a reason for hurt, whether or not the one highlighting them, or others, are aware of the identity of the subject).</p>\n\n<p>However, there is an important exceptions to this. Rambam implies that this prohibition applies when <em>intending</em> to hurt someone in Perush HaMishna (ibid):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד שהאדם יכול לעשותה בתחבולה...או שיציע לאדם שאינו מלומד דבר חכמה ויאמר לו הסבר לי דבר זה <strong>כדי לביישו</strong>, ויאמר אני חשבתי שהוא מאנשי החכמה. או שיספר ספור ויכלול בו מגרעות איזה אדם ומומיו, ויאמר אני לא נתכוונתי למה שחשבתם. לפיכך אמר ויראת מאלהיך היודע כוונותיך ומחשבותיך, וזהו ענין אמרם כל דבר שהוא מסור ללב נאמר בו ויראת מאלהיך </p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, a person can do it underhandedly...Or he can present an unlearned person a matter of learning, and say: 'explain this matter to me' in order to shame him, and he could claim 'I thought he was one of the learned'. Or you could relate a story and include in it a person's shortcomings and flaws, and claim: 'I didn't intend for that [negative point] which you thought'. Therefore, God said: 'And you should fear your God', who knows your intentions and thoughts. And this is the intent of Hazal's statement: 'Regarding anything dependent one's thoughts, it is stated 'And you should fear your God'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, in Hilkhot Teshuva (7:8), he describes the prohibition of shaming others as specifically where it is intended to hurt them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וחטא גמור הוא לומר לבעל תשובה זכור מעשיך הראשונים...כדי לביישו...הכל אסור ומוזהר עליו בכלל הוניית דברים שהזהירה תורה עליה שנאמר ולא תונו איש את עמיתו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/81489/is-the-torah-lashon-harah/81491#81491\">like other interpersonal mitsvot</a>, the prohibition of shaming others intends on the intent. It is specifically prohibited if the goal is to hurt others.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in the case of a harsh comment, only the poster and God can know whether the intent was to shame the subject, and therefore prohibited, or for some ulterior purpose, such as emphasising a mistake to protect others from false information, and therefore permitted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>We use to divide Mitzvos into 2 types: interpersonal (I) and between us and Hashem (U&H). It is important to remember that every interpersonal Mitzvah (like stealing or assaulting or helping others) has a U&H part - which is <strong>person's intention</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As performing of an I-Mitzvah depends on other party response, if one forgives, or did not hear the embarrassment or did not want to be helped, <strong>the U&H part always counts</strong>, either as a negative or a positive commandments.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, even if the other party is not embarrassed, did not read it at all, <strong>the very intention to embarrass the other side is a transgression on its own (U&H)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rema argues and rules that pareve food cooked in a dairy ben yomo (i.e. used with hot dairy in the past 24 hours) vessel may not be eaten with meat, and vice versa, but that b’dieved, if such foods were mixed together, they may be eaten.

The gemara says that the descendants of Haman taught Torah in Bnei Brak. The discussion involves whether we are allowed to accept a convert even from Amalek to show that they can do Teshuvah. Even the Mitzriim are to be remembered for the fact that once they purge the evil that is in them (after three generations of having converted) are to be accepted as full Jews. Every other nation (except Amon and Moav) are to be accepted at once. Nevuzaraden the butcher was accepted after he did teshuvah.

Thus, we should accept that the Spaniards, the Germans, and other nations can do teshuvah and truly repent of the evil that their ancesters did.

There's also <a href=\"http://www.findabook.co.il/bookDetail.aspx?title=%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%20%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%94&book_id=308475\">a book on the topic</a> by Hugo (Chayim Dov) Mantel, but almost everything that I wrote below is from D. Sperber's <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0019_0_19428.html\">article in the Jewish Virtual Library</a>, with a couple of additions and clarifications.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who</strong></p>\n\n<p>Megilah 17b says (by referring to the people who established Shemoneh Esreh, not by calling them the Anshei Kenesset Hagedolah) that there were exactly 120 members, 'among them several prophets'. Interestingly, the Kuzari (3:65) says that there were many members, 'too many to count', so he might have believed it to be larger. There are no sources that contains a full list but we do have records of a few famous members. First of all, of all 120 members (that number comes from ),  120 members (that number comes from Megilah 17b), Avos Derebi Nasan (1:2) says that the Anshei Kenesses Hagedolah (henceforth AKH) received the Torah from Chagai Zecharya and Malachi, implying that those three prophets were not part of the AKH (unlike what some of the commentaries on Avos state). Vayikra Rabbah 2:11 calls them 'Ezra and his companions', implying that Ezra was their leader. The Targum to Shir Hashirim 7:3 mentions Mordechai, Ezra, Nechemia, Zerubbabel, Yehushua (Kohen Gadol) and Bilshan (mentioned Ezra 2:2) as members of this group, and, of course, the Mishnah in Avos 1:2 states that Shimon HaTzadik was among the last members. Historians prefer to identify him with Simeon II, see below. Rav Reuvain Margolios (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20976&st=&pgnum=6\">starting here</a>) actually believes that Shimon Hatzadik was among 70 members of 'remainders of the AKH', which was separate from the AKH itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When and Where</strong></p>\n\n<p>Assuming that they were led by Ezra, the AKH may have been formed in Persia, but their major locale of operation was Israel, probably Jerusalem, the center of Jewish life during Ezra's time. When it comes to fitting Jewish sources with outside sources we're going to run into some trouble: we know (from the people mentioned) the Anshei Kenesses Hagedolah lived during the Persian empire period and its conclusion through the building of the Second Temple, which Seder Olam Rabba (30) says was only 34 years, whereas secular historians believe the period to be significantly longer (see this Wikipedia article: \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_years_%28Jewish_calendar%29\">The Missing Years</a>\" which is part of the confusion). Besides for Seder Olam Rabba, Midrash Socher Tov (on Tehillim 36) and Yalkut Shimoni (Beraishis Ch. 9, 61) refer to them as being of <em>one</em> generation, which also implies that they didn't last for more than half a century or so. If Shimon Hatzadik was among its members though, and this is Simeon II who lived in around 200 B.C.E, the period of the AKH could be as long as 200 years. Rav David Zvi Hoffman, in המשנה הראשונה (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6804&st=&pgnum=33&hilite=\">linked here</a>, n. 29), also notes that much more time may have elapsed than implied by the first chapter of Maseches Avos, though he may not mean that the AKH spanned more time. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are unfortunately no 'outside' sources that mention such an institution, though something like that isn't really expected because the Persians etc. of the relatively short time period during which they lived weren't too concerned with internal Jewish religious affairs. From Chazal though, we find that they established 'ברכות ותפלות קדושות והבדלות' (Berachos 33a), wrote (the final versions?) of several books of Tanakh (Bava Basra 15), according to one opinion in Yerushalmi (Shekalim 5:1), established Midrashei Halakha and Agada, had a hand in instituting Purim (Megilah 2a) and are said to have killed the yetzer hara for idolatry (whatever that means, Yoma 69b). They were also the ones who determined that 'there are four people excluded from Olam Haba' in Perek Cheilek of Sanhedrin (Bamidbar Rabba 14:1). Many assume that they also canonized Tanakh (exaple: Gra on Mishlei 24:23), and even though secular historians believe this to have come significantly later (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon#Rabbinic_Judaism\">Wikipedia</a>, quotes Davies, puts it at the time of Chashmonaim) they agree that AKH took some part in formalizing Sifrei Tanakh. While they are not recorded as having any political power or function, the fact that they were able to establish a liturgy that was so widely accepted certainly bears testimony to the power of their influence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/judaism-101/glossary/anshei-knesset-hagedolah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</a> were the 120 sages set up by Ezra at the end of the Babylonian exile. According to shiurim that I have attendednce it was set up, no more members were added as the original members died until only Shimon Hatzadik was left. This is from a number of sources (including le'havdil Wikipedia) as well as a number of Jewish History sites and text books. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Berel Wein discusses them in \"<em>Echoes of Glory</em>\" pages 13-15. Rabbi Reuven Margolies in <em>Yesod Hamishnah V'Arichasa (Mosad Harav Kook, 1956)</em> suggests that there were never any replacements and Shimon was the sole survivor of the 120. Others interpret \"from the remnants\" in Pirkei Avos as meaning that he was the one who picked up the mesorah after the group disbanded. </p>\n\n<p>Pirkei Avos 1:2 shows that in the chain of tradition that Shimon Hatzadik was the \"from the remnants\" this group and was the next link in the chain.</p>\n\n<p>Note that there are disputes as to the precise date that the first temple was destroyed and the second temple rebuilt. This is a totally different matter than the actual existence of the Anshei Knesses Hagedolah as there are those who say that the first temple was destroyed in 586 BCE and others as late as 420 BCE. This is a question discussed by Rabbi Shimon Schwab and others. One reason for this difference is the fact that the second temple traditionally existed for 420 years with 70 years of exile. Counting back from 70 CE gives 420 BCE. The discussion depends on how the calendar was set up in the construction interval and when the 420 years is counted from. </p>\n\n<p>See @Matt in his answer as well for other citations for more details especially the Where and When section.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, those who say that it lasted from 520 BCE to 200BCE do not believe that it was a one generation organization and place Shimon Hatzaddik later would not agree with Rabbi Margolies.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a short description of this group. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/h/cc/48939022.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">History Crash Course #26: The Great Assembly</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Men of the Great Assembly -- in Hebrew, Anshei Knesset HaGedolah --\n  was an unusual group of Jewish personalities who assumed the reigns of\n  Jewish leadership between 410 BCE and 310 BCE. This time period\n  follows the destruction of the First Temple, and includes the early\n  decades of the Second Temple, up until the invasion of the Greeks, led\n  by Alexander the Great. Realizing that the Jewish people were growing\n  weaker spiritually, a group of wise leaders came together -- expanding\n  the Sanhedrin, the Jewish Supreme Court, from 70 to 120 members --\n  with a special aim of strengthening Judaism. Initially gathered\n  together by Ezra, they defined Judaism in this tumultuous time when\n  prophecy and kingship were all but gone from the Jewish people.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Today's Israeli Parliament, which is called \"the Knesset,\" also has\n  120 members in imitation of the Great Assembly although the Knesset of\n  today serves an entirely different function of the Great Assembly of\n  2,500 years ago.) </p>\n  \n  <p>Among them we count the last of the prophets Haggai,\n  Zechariah and Malachi, as well as the sages Mordechai, (of the Purim\n  story), Yehoshua, (the High Priest), Nechemia (the chief architect of\n  rebuilding of Jerusalem), Shimon HaTzaddik (also a High Priest).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/judaism-101/glossary/anshei-knesset-hagedolah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“<strong>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</strong>” – <strong>Men of the Great Assembly</strong>; founded by\n  Ezra in approximately 520 B.C.E., this institution of Torah Sages led\n  the Jewish People at the beginning of the Second Temple Era (ca. 520\n  B.C.E. – 70 C.E.). It included Mordechai and the last of the\n  prophetsChaggai, Zechariah and Malachi.</p>\n  \n  <p>Among the accomplishments of the “Anshei Knesset HaGedolah” were\n  finalizing the contents of the “Tanach,” the 24-Book Hebrew Bible,\n  instituting the “Shemoneh Esray” Prayer (recited at least three times\n  daily, and ultimately to serve as a substitute for the Temple\n  Sacrifices), and the enacting of many Laws to protect and bolster the\n  observance of the Torah Commands.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Pirkei Avot (1:1), they are the fifth link in the Chain\n  of Jewish Tradition: 1) Moshe receives it from Sinai and teaches it to\n  2) Yehoshuato the 3) Elders to the 4) Prophets to the 5) Anshei\n  Knesset HaGedolah, at the end of the Biblical Period (ca. 520 B.C.E.).\n  Pirkei Avot (1:2) also identifies “Shimon HaTzaddik,” Shimon the\n  Righteous, as “among the last of the Men of the Great Assembly,” at\n  the beginning of the Talmudic Period (ca. 200 B.C.E.).</p>\n  \n  <p>In truth, the “Anshei Knesset HaGedolah” was a transitional\n  institution, that over the approximately 320 years of its existence\n  guided the Jewish People from the Biblical Period to the Talmudic\n  Period, from the Period of “Nisim Niglim,” open, revealed miracles,\n  observed by the entire People, as were the miracles associated with\n  the Exodus from Egypt and the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, and the\n  Miracle performed by Eliyahu HaNavi in his contest with the Prophets\n  of the Baal, to the Period of “Nisim Nistarim,” to more modest and\n  hidden, concealed miracles; as were the Chanukah Miracle of the Oil\n  and the “hidden” miracle of Purim. From the period of “Nevuah,”\n  Prophecy, to the Period of “Tefilah,” Prayer. In Chassidic terms, it\n  was a transition from a Period of “Isarusa Mil’ela,” Arousal from\n  Above, to a Period of “Isarusa Mil’tatoh,” Arousal from Below.</p>\n  \n  <p>There was a sense among Chaza”l that the “Beit HaMikdash HaSheni,” the\n  Second Holy Temple, would not last, because the Divine Presence was\n  not as concentrated as it had been in the First Temple, and it would\n  be necessary to prepare the People for a long, uncharted journey in\n  theDiaspora, with only the guiding but unseen “Hand of HaShem,” and\n  His “Eyes,” watching from behind the curtain.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, this institution was called “Great” because it “restored the\n  Crown of the Torah” (Yoma 69b and Berachot 33a), served as the\n  spiritual center of Jewish Life for approximately 320 years, and\n  ensured the survival of the Jewish People through the coming harsh\n  conditions of the Diaspora until the arrival of Mashiach ben David,\n  soon and in our days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# “Terach, father of Avraham and of Nachor”—what about Haran?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As quoted in the Hagadah, Yehoshua 24:2 reminds the Jewish people that, “Your ancestors lived across the river: Terach, father of Avraham and of Nachor; and they served strange gods.” God then reminds the people how Esav’s descendants had been living comfortably on Mount Seir for centuries while “Ya‘akov and his sons went down to Mitzrayim.”</p>\n\n<p>But why is Haran not mentioned? Haran’s descendants through Lot, Ammon and Moav, should have been equally on the people’s minds—certainly much more so than than Nachor’s in distant Aram.</p>\n\n<p>[Or I might be misunderstanding the purpose of the mention of Nachor and Esav here—but no matter what the reason, why is Haran not mentioned?]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><em>Malbim</em> explains (and <em>M'tzudas David</em> alludes) that <em>Terach</em> and <em>Nachor</em> served idols, so that <em>Avraham</em> was surrounded on all sides, so to speak, by idolators: both his father and his brother. The sequel, describing his leaving that environment, is all the greater then. I suppose that either <em>Haran</em> didn't worship idols or, with one of <em>Avraham</em>'s brothers mentioned, we know he was surrounded by idolators, so there was no need for the verse to mention another brother.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When I learned Yehoshua the explanations were based on the continuation that Avraham had Yitzchak and Yishmael, and Yitzchak had Yaakov and Eisav.  That is this was a process of continuous refining until Yaakov had the twelve sons that were all worthy of becoming Am Hashem. Terach was the start of the process as shown by the fact that the Torah uses \"Toldos Terach\". to indicate the new beginning. Haran actually allowed himself to be killed as part of the fight against avodas zarah. It was Nachor and Avram who were actually the two who exemplified the refining process. Nachor continued in the path of idol worship (via Besuel and Lavan), while Avram  became Avraham and continued the process that eventually led to the creation of Am Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>Note that Yehoshua, based on Yitzchak yikareh lcha zerah, doe not mention Yishmael at all. At this point in the refining process, \"Avraham holid es Yistzchak\" is the establishment on the line. Yishmael was not a removal of pesolas from the line of Terach but a rejected mixture from outside. Yitzchak had to strengthen the development that Avraham took from Terach. Avraham married Sarah, who the medrash says was the daughter of Haran (Yiscah) and wove her traits into the family to create Yitzchak. Yischak married Rivkah the daughter of Besuel to weave the good traits that Nachar received from Terach into the family and then refine out the bad traits via Eisav. It was then that Yaakov was able to complete the weaving of the traits from Leah and Rachel into Am Yisrael and complete the \"three fold thread\" that would take the three sons of Terach and make them into the progenitors of the nation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tearing paper towels on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to one book tearing paper towels on Shabbat is not allowed.\nHowever, tearing a tea bag to open it for use is permitted as long as one\ndoes not destroy any letters and as long as the tearing is done in a destructive way so\nno mending would be possible. Why doesn't the same reasoning imply that one should be able to tear paper towel as long one does not tear along the perforation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You're on the right track, but there are some differences between paper towels and tea bags. Tea is food. You are allowed to tear open a package that contains food, so long as the action you do is not constructive (that is, you are not creating a new vessel by opening a sealed package). In the event that you are creating something new in the process of accessing the food, this action would be prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>With paper towels, there is no such benefit. Destroying in order to create something (a pre-set paper towel) is prohibited biblically as an act of building (or a derivative thereof).  Destroying for destruction's sake is prohibited by rabbinic injunction.</p>\n\n<p>Along the lines you suggested, however, toilet paper may be torn on Shabbath (for its intended purpose) so long as  one does not tear it on the perforation. In this way, one is not \"building\", and the rabbinic prohibition against destroying is waived for the sake of human dignity (ie., not to be forced to spend the day either in pain or covered in filth). But, again, no such leniency exists for (standard) paper towel use.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The difference between the tea bag and the towel is that when you tear the tea bag you want the food inside the bag, not the bag itself.  In the case of paper towels you want the paper towel from the roll.  This is called a melacha. The other case isn't because the tearing is only to get the food.</p>\n\n<p>The principle is discussed in the gemarrah, chagigah 10a,b. If you dig a hole for the dirt, but not to create a hole, this is not a biblical prohibition. Either you could say it's purely destructive or is a melacha she'aino tzricha le'gufo which are both permitted bibically. In the case of the tea bag, you can rip it because you want the tea, not the ripped bag. The towel you want to use the towel, so it's tzericha le'gufo. </p>\n\n<p>This is assuming of course that the paper towel is being used for constructive purpose.  There is ground to stand on and say that if the towel is being used only to get dirty and throw away, that this isn't really constructive purpose but rather it's just to clean something up and would not be melacha.  So I'm only answering what seems to be the book's reasoning, not to give you over what you should do in your case.  Of course for psak in your case you should ask someone in person to hear the whole case, can't paskin from a book but that appears to be the book's logic IMHO.</p>\n\n\n",

However, based on a simple (<em>p'shat</em>) reading of the relevant texts (in Genesis), neither he nor Esau nor Nimrod appear to do anything \"evil.\" <strong>#</strong> Why, then, do most assume that they were evildoers?</p>\n\n<p>Follow-up: Why do the Midrashim vilify them?  </p>\n\n<p>Follow-up to the follow-up: Does it have anything to do with the association of Edom with Rome?</p>\n\n<p>Third follow-up: Similar biblical characters, such as Yehuda and Shimon & Levi do things that seem pretty evil (sell their brother, kill an entire city), yet are considered \"righteous.\"  How can this be?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The short answer to this question is that the <em>midrashim</em> read history backwards.</p>\n\n<p>That is, since we know, for example, that Yishmael is not chosen over Yitzchak to be the \"carrier\" of God's blessing and promise to Avraham, the author of the <em>midrash</em> assumes that there must have been something undeserving in him or he must have done something wrong. Therefore, they will try to \"read into the text\" wrongdoings or flaws of Yishmael to justify his destiny.</p>\n\n<p>The same is true with Esav. We know that Esav was not chosen (or even \"co-chosen\", like the tribes) as Yitzchak's primary progeny; in fact, God even says, \" הֲלוֹא אָח עֵשָׂו לְיַעֲקֹב נְאֻם-יְהוָה וָאֹהַב אֶת-יַעֲקֹב וְאֶת-עֵשָׂו שָׂנֵאתִי\" (Malachi 1:2-3) - God hated Esav. \"But why?\", wonders the <em>midrash</em>. He must have been a bad person to deserve God's hatred. So the <em>midrash</em> will not hesitate to interpret slight nuances in the text or come up with back-stories that explain Esav's evildoing.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this holds in reverse as well. Yehuda is known to be one of the twelve tribes to inherit the promise of Avraham and all the blessings of God that came with it. In fact, history gives Yehuda's descendants a large slice of the pie of prosperity. Again, why? With the belief that God is just, the <em>midrash</em> needs to explain this. So it will judge Yehuda extremely favorably under the assumption that he must have been righteous. Anything that looks bad in the text is reinterpreted or downplayed, and anything good is emphasized and glorified.</p>\n\n<p>This sometimes leaves the uninitiated reader of the <em>midrash</em> perplexed or even put-off. But with this understanding, the <em>midrash</em> tends to make much more sense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>If you look in Rashi and the Gemara you will see that he did some very bad things on a very regular basis. Midrash does not make stuff up. Midrash is just a word to refer to parts of the Gemara. You are right that without the Oral Torah (shebaal peh) it makes no sense, but that is a foundation of our faith; God gave Moshe the Written Torah (shebichsav) and Oral Torah (shebaal peh), both are from God and you can't have one without the other. That is why not \"believing in\" the Oral Torah (shebaal peh) such as Midrash makes one a kofer, or heretic. You need both parts of God's word and in addition without the Oral Torah (shebaal peh) you get very wrong ideas such as Esav seeming not actually so bad at all. Midrash doesn't read backwards and make stuff up. Chazal have tradition from Moshe, and anything they \"extrapolate\" is based on very specific rules for reading the text which are also straight from god.</p>\n\n<p>As for yehuda and such, you are reciting questions straight out of Rashi and other Mefarshim; look there for the answers.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I must warn you Jakes answer which involved arbitrary \"downplaying\" and \"reinterpreting\" based on how  they wanted it to look is EGREGIOUSLY incorrect and very clearly tantamount to <em>kfira</em>, or heresy. If you look at the 13 principles of faith and the discussion thereof in the rambam and such, along with the FIRST MISHNA in Pirkei Avos Jake's so called \"answer\" contradicts several of the 13 core beliefs of Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

Huna as allowing \"beet and rice\" on the Seder plate in place of the lamb bone and the egg.  It seems to me that a ruling in the Talmud ought to have preempted the later Ashkenazi custom.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It is not the case that a ruling in the Talmud will always overcome any possible custom developed later.</p>\n\n<p>In Talmudic times, there was no customary prohibition of kitniyot. Rav Huna, in the quote, is giving an <strong>example</strong> of what may be used as the two cooked dishes, even though of course other simple dishes would be fine as well. And he specifies orez (which may very well be millet, rather than rice). And, the gemara explains, this is to the exclusion of the position of Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri, who maintained that this was a grain, which would present problems of Chametz.</p>\n\n<p>Later, with full knowledge that in previous generations, kitniyot was allowed, and with full knowledge of Rav Huna's statement, various Ashkenazi communities instituted a decree (gezeira) or accepted a custom (minhag) not to consume kitniyot, something which included rice. This, for reasons such as that wheat grains were still present in the fields from the previous harvest.</p>\n\n<p>You could similarly ask how Rabbenu Gershom could decree that a man couldn't give his wife a bill of divorce against her will, or marry multiple wives, when there are explicit Talmudic statements which allow these. The answer in all cases is that your assumptions of what the proper methodology should be is not the same as the methodology with which they were operating.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/jewish_action/03/2013/curious_about_kitniyot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curious about Kitniyot?</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While we don’t know exactly when this minhag began, one of the\n  earliest sources to mention the custom is the Sefer Mitzvot Katan,\n  written by Rabbi Yitzchak of Courville (France, 1210-1280). Rabbi\n  Yitzchak writes that some communities have the custom of not eating\n  kitniyot during Pesach, even though these items are clearly not\n  chametz.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are two main reasons why the custom was instituted:</p>\n  \n  <p>Firstly, kitniyot are often grown in close vicinity to the five grains\n  (wheat, oat, spelt, rye and barley). As such, it was not unusual for a\n  small amount of one or more of the five grains to be intermingled with\n  kitniyot. Thus, it was possible that one eating beans or rice on\n  Pesach could inadvertently eat actual chametz.</p>\n  \n  <p>Secondly, kitniyot can be easily confused with chametz for several\n  reasons. Raw kitniyot resemble the five grains in appearance.\n  Furthermore, kitniyot are processed in a similar manner to the five\n  grains. For example, mustard seeds are threshed and winnowed in a\n  manner similar to grains. Finally, kitniyot can be milled into flour,\n  made into dough, baked into bread or cooked into a porridge that may\n  resemble chametz. Because of the similarities between kitniyot and\n  actual chametz, the rabbis feared that people may mistakenly believe\n  that if they can eat kitniyot on Pesach, they can also eat chametz on\n  Pesach.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Vilna Gaon (1720-1790) and Peri Chadash (1586-1667) found a basis\n  for not eating kitniyot in the Talmud (Pesachim 40b). The Gemara\n  relates that Rava did not allow the use of lentil flour on Pesach in a\n  Jewishly unlearned community, as he feared it would lead to confusion\n  and cause one to mistakenly eat chametz on Pesach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/holidays/passover/kitniyos_the_next_best_thing_to_chometz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitniyos: The Next Best Thing to Chometz</a> actually has a complete podcast shiur going into the details as to how, when, and why this custom arose among Ashkenaz Jews.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Only five grains can ferment to become chometz (leavened); why are so\n  many more forbidden during Pesach? Join Rabbi Mintz, OU Kashruth\n  Rabbinic Coordinator charged with recording OU P’sak and Policy, in a\n  thorough exploration of the topic of Kitniyos (“legumes”). How did\n  such a custom start among the Ashkenazim? To what foods does it apply?\n  What about derivatives like citric acid and corn syrup? What if an\n  Ashkenazi is invited to his Sefardic in-laws for a Pesach meal?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

We also have all of the laws and traditions of our people that make up Jewish life, from the Pentateuch, and to a lesser degree from the other books of our biblical canon, as well as the measures we need to take to bring about Messianic times.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_12.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 12a</a>, (<a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=bava_basra&daf=12a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">original text</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Amemar said: A wise man is even superior to a prophet, as it says, \"And a prophet has a heart of wisdom\", (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t2690.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 90</a>:12).  Who is compared with whom?

    "title": "In a leap year, is the extra month Adar I or Adar II?",
    "content": "# In a leap year, is the extra month Adar I or Adar II?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm implementing support for the Hebrew calendar in <a href=\"http://nodatime.org\">Noda Time</a>, my date/time library for .NET. I think I'm mostly there aside from text support (although beta testers would be <em>very</em> welcome!) but one aspect still puzzles me.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar\">Wikipedia Hebrew Calendar entry</a> states that in a leap year, the extra month is inserted <em>before</em> the \"regular\" Adar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>During leap years Adar I (or Adar Aleph — \"first Adar\") is added before the regular Adar. Adar I is actually considered to be the extra month, and has 30 days. Adar II (or Adar Bet — \"second Adar\") is the \"real\" Adar, and has the usual 29 days. For this reason, holidays such as Purim are observed in Adar II, not Adar I.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So according to this, Adar I is the leap month. However, the Microsoft method of <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7ds1d2ff%28v=vs.110%29.aspx\"><code>Calendar.IsLeapMonth</code></a> returns <code>true</code> for year 5502, month 7 - which is Adar II (using civil month numbering instead of ecclesiastical). By my reckoning, it should return <code>true</code> for month 6 instead of month 7.</p>\n\n<p>This is also the way Microsoft handles Adar in Windows Store applications. From <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.globalization.calendaridentifiers.hebrew\"><code>CalendarIdentifiers.Hebrew</code></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>During leap years, Adar is replaced by Adar Alef with 30 days and Adar Beit with 29 days. Adar Beit is considered the leap month. The last day of Adar Alef and all the days in Adar Beit are considered leap days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Currently this doesn't impact my implementation, but I can see that it might in the future - and I'd rather get things right than just follow Microsoft if they've got it wrong. So, who's right in this case? And does it have impact beyond that mentioned in Wikipedia?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>There is some discussion in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jerusalem Talmud</a> (<em>M'gilla</em> <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r2a01.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">7a-b</a>) regarding which of the two Adars is considered the leap month (incidentally, <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/597\"><em>halachic</em></a> ramifications are discussed ad loc.). Medieval commentators interpret the Talmud as concluding that Adar I is the extra month (see Rashi to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=19b&format=text\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Rosh HaShana</em> 19b</a>, s.v. <em>kamma ibbur hashana</em>; see also Tosafos ibid., s.v. <em>Adar hasamuch l'Nisan l'olam chaseir</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, there is a separate debate over the meaning of an unqualified reference to \"Adar\" during a leap year. This debate traces from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannaim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tanaitic era</a> (with a difference in opinion between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Meir\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Meir</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_bar_Ilai\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehuda</a> mentioned in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraita\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>b'raisa</em></a> in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=16&daf=63&format=text\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>N'darim</em> 63a</a>) to the medieval era, with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosh</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42270&st=&pgnum=105\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>N'darim</em> 8:2</a>) ruling in accordance with R' Yehuda that an unspecified reference refers to Adar I, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=6&hilchos=31&perek=10&halocha=6\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Hil. N'darim</em> 10:6</a>) ruling in accordance with R' Meir that an unspecified reference refers to Adar II. Although some later authorities rule in favor of the Rosh (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1935\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tur OC 428</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40448&st=&pgnum=186\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rema OC 427:1</a>), multiple later decisors view this debate as unsettled and insist that important legal documents should explicitly specify which Adar is being referenced (see, for example, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7846\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Bach</em> EH 126:4</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40448&st=&pgnum=186\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Mishna B'rura</em> 427:3</a>).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>After some much Hebrew googling, it seems as though the rationale is the other way around. </p>\n\n<p>Adar was doubled because it was the last month of the calendar (which started at Nisan with Passover) back then. The decision was to celebrate Purim (and all the other events) in the second Adar as to keep both redemption celebrations close (Purim and Passover). Because of that the first Adar was treated as the \"extra\" month.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The extra month is Adar I. That's because Purim (the holiday) is in Adar II, in a leap year. As Purim is celebrated also in non-leap year, the conclusion is that Adar II is the month that is always present whereas Adar I is present only in leap years.</p>\n\n<p>My guess is that the MS implementation is wrong. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is \"Nishmat\" included in most copies of the haggadah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From recently reading <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9655240347\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Why We Pray What We Pray\"</a> by Rabbi Dr. Barry Freundel, I learned that the \"Nishmat\" prayer, usually associated with Shabbat and Festival morning services, was originally part of the Passover Seder and only got added to the morning services during the medieval period.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically it references the Mishnah <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishna_Pesachim.10.7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 10:7</a>.  The book translates this slightly differently from the linked website saying: \"They filled the third cup for him. He then recites grace after meals. Over the fourth cup he concludes the Hallel and recites the blessing of the song.\"  The Talmud Bavli then clarifies this with: \"What is the Blessing of the Song? Rav Judah said: 'They shall praise Thee, O Lord our God'; Rabbi Johanan said: 'The soul of all that lives' [i.e. Nishmat].\"</p>\n\n<p>My questions are:</p>\n\n<p>1) What prayer is Rav Judah referencing? It sounds like Hallel, but aren't we discussing what is immediately after that?</p>\n\n<p>2) Is Nishmat still commonly part of the haggadah? None of my printed haggadot list this prayer, even the ones that include a Birkat HaMazon and a complete Hallel. It can be found <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/661624/jewish/English-Haggadah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> a little past 3/4 of the way down the page. Is it commonly left out, or do I just have a collection of incomplete haggadot (some of them 50 years old)?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I did eventually find it in a <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0870685422\" rel=\"nofollow\">1966 haggadah</a> of mine from Rabbi Nathan Goldberg.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Nishmas is part of the haggadah according to Machzor Vitri, who was a talmid of Rashi.\nThe notes on bottom write that the shir mentioned in the gemara is nishmas kol chai.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Both Rav Judah's and Rabbi Johanan's opinions are followed nowadays. During Hallel at the Seder, we say various chapters of Psalms (115-118, specifically), followed by a paragraph beginning \"They shall praise Thee, O Lord our God\" (יהללוך ה׳ אלקינו in Hebrew). It is this paragraph that Rav Judah was referring to. We then continue with Psalm 136 and Rabbi Johanan's Nishmat, at which point we conclude Hallel with the fourth cup and the appropriate after-blessing. As mentioned in the comments, this is true of all versions of the haggadah nowadays, whether your 1958 and 1963 English translations like it or not. ;)</p>\n\n\n",

He informed me that I can keep attending, and then after a while we will speak more about the matter. I have happily accepted that plan, and will keep at it.

    "content": "# Discussing the Exodus in the Messianic Age\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna (Berakhot 1:5) records a disagreement between Shimon ben Zoma and the sages as regards the interpretation of a word in Deuteronomy 16:3. There, the verse says that one should recall the exodus from Egypt <strong>all</strong> the days of one's life (למען תזכר את יום צאתך מארץ מצרים <strong>כל</strong> ימי חייך).</p>\n\n<p>Either the word <strong>all</strong> refers to all of each day or to all of one's individual days; the first interpretation is adopted by Ben Zoma, who says that it includes the nighttime as well, while the second interpretation is adopted by the sages who say that it includes the days of the messianic era also:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ימי חייך - הימים, כל ימי חייך - הלילות. וחכמים אומרים ימי חייך - העולם\n  הזה, כל ימי חייך - להביא לימות המשיח</p>\n  \n  <p>[Ben Zoma says that] \"the days of your life\" would refer to the\n  daytimes, but <strong>all</strong> the days of your life refers also to the\n  nighttimes.

My question is, why?</p>\n\n<p>Of what benefit would a recollection of the original exodus be during the era of the moshiach? Was it the intention of the sages that we would continue conducting a seder every erev Pesach after the moshiach comes? What purpose would such recollection serve?</p>\n\n\n",

The other kind is stories, psychology-lite musings, and you can tell that the book would have worked just as well if it had been written as purely secular.

What exactly was difficult about Kriyas Yam Suf? Who was it difficult for? Us? Hashem? Can something really be difficult for Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The question is dealt with <a href=\"http://yhb.org.il/?p=580\">here</a> </p>\n\n<p>A brief summary of the article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why is it difficult to “tear” the Red Sea ?</p>\n  \n  <p>A medrash says that Moshe who saw all the plagues of Egypt, asked\n  Hashem, You have set a border to the sea and You have sworn never to\n  tear it up” </p>\n  \n  <p>The Maharal explains tearing the Red Sea breaks all the rules of\n  natural resources. Until then when there was a break of the use of\n  natural laws, it was local and specific. The Torah compares all the\n  plagues of Egypt to a finger and splitting the sea to a hand.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the words of the Maharal:</p>\n  \n  <p>All the seas are effectively one. It is not that part of the world has\n  undergone a change, but one of the basic elements  of the six days of\n  creation is undermined here. </p>\n  \n  <p>As Chazal say: ויבקעו המים - כל מימות שבעולם נבקעו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course nothing is difficult for Hashem. But the Torah speaks in our language. So the \"difficulty\" so to speak was indeed for Hashem in the sense that </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>He had set a boundary for the sea which He now changed and </li>\n<li>He did this on a global scale.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a matter of how can Bnei Yisrael merit Hashem \"<em>intervening</em>\" in the \"<em>natural</em>\" world to do things. Of course, Hashem can do anything He wants, but it is a matter of people seeing the nissim and meriting Hashgacha Pratis. Kriyas Yam Suf is the \"breaking\" of natural law as a one time event. Thus, people can see the miracle that is being done. As it says, \"A shifcha at the Yam Suf saw more than the navi Yechezkel was able to see\". However, the constant miracles that are required to provide the \"daily living\" or to continue for a lifetime with one's zivug. If we were to be left to \"natural law\" these things would be unable to continue. We must realize that it is only through hashgacha pratis that we are able to continue in the world and we must realize this and work to merit the constant nissim as well as understand that it is only through nissim that we can survive.</p>\n\n<p>For Example <a href=\"http://modzitz.org/torah/kisisa.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Ki Sisa Es Rosh B'nei Yisroel Lifkudeihem</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a person is at risk of drowning in the ocean, as long as his head is above the water and hasn't sunk below the surface, he is still alive and [at least temporarily] safe. His body may be fully submerged, but as long as the head is above water, he's breathing. Similarly, we are familiar with the Medrash that describes the efforts in earning a living as being as hard as \"crossing the Red Sea\" (kashe mezonosav shel adam k'kriyas Yam Suf). The problems and complexities of \"making an honest buck\" are the same as the waves of the ocean that threaten to overcome one who is at risk of drowning. The key is to keep one's head up, to keep from sinking under the relentless waves. This is done by reserving time for Torah study and Tefilla (prayer), which help us to lift our heads from the drudgery of the daily grind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/705643/Mrs._Yael_Goldfischer/Beshalach\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kriat Yam Suf</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chazal tell us that there are three things that are as difficult for the Ribbono Shel Olam, k'vayachol, as the performance of Kriyas Yam Suf: providing a person with food, finding a person's zivug, marital partner, and the keeping the functioning of a person's body in a proper manner. What does this mean? HaRav Drillman explained that if we work a little harder to see the miracles in these \"everyday\" occurrences then we will be better able to rise to the Madreigah of seeing HKB\"H in every aspect of our lives and being able to come closer to Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I once heard an interesting explanation of this by Rabbi Uziel Milevsky zt'l regarding marriage.

The splitting of the sea was going against gravity.</p>\n\n<p>So it is merely teaching us marriage is difficult in that it is going against the natural human tendency of selfishness, just like the waters went against the natural law of gravity.

    "content": "# The \"New Covenant\" in Jeremiah's Prophesy\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am certain there must be a great answer to this question. Please inform me, as my learning is not so great and I have only started on the study of the Scriptures. </p>\n\n<p>Many Christians use the text of Jeremiah 31.31-34 to support their perspective of the \"New Covenant\" that Jesus supposedly brought. Here is the text:</p>\n\n<p>\"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah. Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.\"</p>\n\n<p>My own conflicts with this are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1a) If G-d's Law was truly G-d's Law, then the possibility of a \"New Covenant\" that replaces the Law of Moses would be impossible, since it would undercut the entire reality of the Law to begin with. If G-d is unchanging, immutable, then His Law would be both unchanging and unalterable.</p>\n\n<p>1b) The Christian reading of this passage takes it out of the greater context of the Tanakh as a whole. It must be interpreted in light of all the Tanakh teaches. If G-d said certain institutions and ordinances were forever, then they cannot be changed or altered, forever (as the daily prayers clearly attest to; see <em>yig'dal</em>).</p>\n\n<p>2) Reading this within a Jewish context we can see the Messianic overtones. However, these do not point to the \"spiritual ministry\" of Jesus, but to the Messianic Age, when a true and <em>actual</em> peace will reign on the Earth, when all will truly know and understand Torah knowledge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The bottom line, the question, is whether or not my interpretive reading of the text is or is not in line with Jewish <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis\" rel=\"nofollow\">exegesis</a>. Am I understanding this text properly, from the appropriate Jewish point of view, and are my arguments against the Christian misinterpretation useful?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>You are correct that they are twisting what Jeremiah said in order to support their missionary efforts.</p>\n\n<p>Radak points out that the \"newness\" will be that the Bnai Yisrael will have grown to to the extent that they will no longer fall prey to the evil inclination (as occurred with the golden calf) and break it on their end. Malachi 3:22 points out that there will no longer be prophets and that the Torah as given at Horeb (Har Sinai) is everlasting. </p>\n\n<p>Malbim explains that when the Bnei Yisrael were taken out of Egypt, Hashem had to take them by the hand and pull them out before they fell below the 49th level of tum'ah and became totally lost. They had not yet reached the level of the Torah. They were like young children who had to be taught what to do and are too young to fully understand. As a result, since we have free will, we could and did break the covenant, but Hashem (as Metzudas David says) continued and maintained the covenant to save them from their enemies.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Nachmiash explains the Torah must always seem new and fresh, as if we have just accepted it. The only reason that it might <strong>seem</strong> old and boring are the actions of the evil inclination (as exemplified by the claims of other religions that the Torah has been \"replaced\").</p>\n\n<p>For example <a href=\"https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/is-jeremiahs-qnew-covenantq-jeremiah-3131-34-a-prophecy-fulfilled-by-the-new-testament\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Is Jeremiah’s “new covenant” (Jeremiah 31:31-34) a prophecy fulfilled by the New Testament?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Answer: The term “new covenant” would be meaningless unless what\n  Jeremiah meant by it was the renewing of the old covenant, which will\n  thereby regain its full original vigor. The covenant of old is of\n  eternal duration, never to be rescinded or to be superseded by a new\n  covenant (Leviticus 26:44-45). The covenant between God and Israel is\n  frequently referred to as everlasting (e.g., Genesis 17:7, 13, 19;\n  Psalms 105:8, 10; 1 Chronicles 16:13-18).</p>\n  \n  <p>The Christian position concerning Jeremiah’s covenant is the complete\n  opposite of what the Jewish Scriptures teach. Hebrews 8:13 states: “In\n  that he says, a new covenant, he has made the first obsolete. Now that\n  which is being made obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing\n  away.” In stark contrast to this statement, the Scriptures state: “The\n  works of His hands are truth and justice; and His precepts are sure.\n  They are established forever and ever, they are done in truth and\n  uprightness” (Psalms 111:7-8); “The grass withers, the flower fades;\n  but the word of our God shall stand forever” (Isaiah 40:8).</p>\n  \n  <p>Jeremiah’s “new covenant” is not a replacement of the existing\n  covenant, but merely a figure of speech expressing the reinvigoration\n  and revitalization of the existing covenant. The people of Israel\n  possess an old covenant yet a new covenant, truly an everlasting\n  covenant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Jeremiah did not say \"make a new Torah or new Tanach\", but make to make the same covenant refreshed, refreshing and renewing our understanding of the covenant we received thousands of years ago.

To you (and other fellow Jews), or to the Christians mentioned above ? If the former, yes; if the latter, no, because <strong>their understanding of change would significantly differ from yours.</strong> This is ultimately due to historical considerations preceding Christianity by centuries, and utterly unrelated to its very existence (which they eventually helped shape anyway); specifically, it is because of the drastic difficulties faced by many <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora#Pre-Roman_diaspora\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ancient Diaspora Jews</a> in efficiently implementing what one would call a kosher lifestyle whilst living in exile among the various Gentile nations.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>This can be seen both in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Babylonian era</a> book of Daniel, found among the canonical scriptures, as well as in the pious, though non-canonical, book of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Tobit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tobit</a>, penned in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hellenistic times</a>. In both cases, their main protagonists are presented as pious Jews, steadfastly holding on to ancestral customs, despite harsh realities; needless to say, this is done for a reason; namely, the steady decline in observance among the Hebrews in general, whose piety these texts were meant to revive in the first place.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>Granted, this can be (partially) explained by the general <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(narrative)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(leit)motif</a> reverberating throughout scripture as a whole, namely Israel's general disinterest in the Torah; but, this time, it goes even deeper, inasmuch as there is only a (very) limited amount of control that one can exercise over external realities independent of oneself, such as the provenance of meats sold at a marketplace, for instance, or the uncertainty surrounding their possible previous involvement in certain pagan feasts or sacrifices.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>These down to earth, day to day, practical and pragmatic issues marked the beginning of a major historical rift between Diaspora and Israeli Jews in terms of Torah observance, upon which, in Judaism, one's righteousness, and therefore one's share in the world to come, is ultimately predicated. Is it either just or right(eous) for two persons, equally strong in their desire to fulfill the commandments, to be either barred from or welcomed into eternal life because of ultimately geographic considerations, lying well beyond their power of control ?</sub></p>\n<p><sub>Therefore, to gain some sort of semblance of self-respect, the Hebrew Diaspora logically sought spiritual solace, comfort, and refuge in a righteousness whose attainment is unencumbered by the above-listed hindrances; this happened under the influence of (mainly Greek) <strong>philosophy</strong>, which saw in the physical, material, transient, and impermanent world <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">figures or symbols of eternal, unchanging realities</a>; one of its most accomplished exponents being <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Philo</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Egypt#Ptolemaic_and_Roman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alexandria</a>, a contemporary of early Christianity. Speaking of which, let us now finally turn our attention to the aforementioned quote from Jeremiah (31:31-34):</sub></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a <strong>new covenant</strong> with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah. [...] I will <strong>put my law in their inward parts</strong>, and write it in <strong>their hearts</strong>; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub>In light of the preceding paragraphs, let us now parse this passage through the eyes of an ancient Diaspora Jew, echoing Philo's Greek philosophical ideas, rather than the ones espoused by homeland Israelis of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple_period\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Second Temple period</a>, which have already been presented in the other answers. For starters, let us note that a very similar message is being conveyed elsewhere in scripture; namely, in Ezekiel (36:26-27), which reads as follows:</sub></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <strong>new heart</strong> also will I give you, and a <strong>new spirit</strong> will I put within you: and I will take away the <strong>stony heart</strong> out of your flesh, and I will give you an <strong>heart of flesh</strong>. And I will <strong>put my spirit within you</strong>, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub>So, how would such a Jew, living under the above-described circumstances, be tempted to interpret these sacred Hebrew texts ? Would he feel in any way inclined to render them as referring to, or even favoring a <em>literal</em> fulfilling of the divine commandments ? As literal as the literal stones upon which they were literally carved, and which Moses literally broke in anger, when witnessing their wayward hearts worship the golden calf ? Given that both seem to employ a metaphorical, rather than literal language (<em>write in their hearts</em>, <em>heart of stone</em>, and other similar expressions), an initial attempt would be to render them as describing spiritual, rather than physical realities (<em>I will give you a new spirit</em>, <em>I will put my spirit within you</em>, etc.), in concordance and conformity with the all-pervading Greek philosophical thought of their time; such a predisposition would then only have been further strengthened, apart from the vicissitudes hurdled in their day to day struggle (and failure) to literally keep the Torah, by yet other verses in the same vein, whether within Jeremiah:</sub></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><sup><strong>Jeremiah 4:4</strong></sup> <strong>Circumcise</strong> yourselves to the LORD, and take away <strong>the foreskins of your heart</strong>, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub>or even within the Torah itself:</sub></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><sup><strong>Deuteronomy 10:16</strong></sup> <strong>Circumcise</strong> therefore <strong>the foreskin of your heart</strong>, and be no more stiff-necked. <sup><strong>30:6</strong></sup> And the LORD thy God will <strong>circumcise thine heart</strong>, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou may live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub>Needless to say, similar echoes are found in early Christian literature; specifically, in Paul's letters (Romans 2:28-29), aimed particularly at captivating precisely such a Hellenized Jewish audience (following the persecutions against the then-new religious faith within the Hebrew homeland), and where the focus is, by the sheer virtue of necessity, shifted towards an inner, rather than an outer keeping of the commandments, since the <strong>same</strong> difficulties were faced by <strong>all</strong> Hebrews living in the Diaspora, <strong>regardless</strong> of their stance on Christianity.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>But how can the heart be circumcised ? Certainly not literally, least one's desire to fulfill or obey such a divine decree would inadvertently lead one to breaking one of the ten commandments, namely the sixth; as such, let us appeal to philosophy: What eternal, spiritual reality does the physical act of circumcision stand for ? The cutting away of one's lust, for instance ? Yes, the above-mentioned Hellenist would say, and the entire Tanakh appears to echo this view:</sub></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Within Genesis itself, Lamech and Esau, unlike Abraham or Jacob, for instance, took two wives for themselves, from the very beginning, without any need or provocation; we all know how their two stories would eventually end.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Moses himself prohibits various types of sexual immorality in his other four books, threatening to punish such transgressions by stoning, no less.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the books of Samuel and Kings, David looked upon Uriah's wife, Bathsheba, whilst she was having a bath, and Solomon married hundreds upon hundreds of wives and concubines; needless to say, their acts also had dire implications for everyone involved.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sub>It is in this manner that Hellenized Judaism (and Christianity, afterwards), would (re)interpret the Laws of the Mosaic covenant; even their Pharisaic, Talmudic, and Rabbinic counterparts would be ultimately forced to make certain concessions; such as, for instance, the traditional Jewish (re)interpretation of fasting as a sacrifice of (one's own) flesh and blood, in the absence of a Temple, due to the practitioner's inherent self-emaciation. What initially began as an unfortunate accident of fate would eventually, over millennia, imbue the various branches of Judaism with a deeply internalized philosophical outlook and enriched spiritual perspective, rivaling even that of the ancient Greeks; Solomon and Socrates, hand in hand, at times both wrestling and cooperating with one another.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>I sincerely hope that my humble effort, which can in no way substitute itself for a thorough incursion into the sinuous history of Jewish religious thought, nor meaningfully replace a serious reading of Philo, will help dispel at least some of your inner conflicts, mentioned in your question, over how Jews and Christians sometimes seem to approach the same biblical texts from widely different angles. When studying evolution, whether biological or ideological (and religious), the key lies in finding the missing (historical) link, tying together the wide diversity in variation exhibited by the various present-day species or specimens.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

If in the comfort of your own home, can you go topless during an exercise?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What about running in the park? Is a t-shirt and shorts outfit fine?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Regarding kipa - in a shiur I heard from R' Nissin Kaplan, he said that if you can't play a sport without taking off your kipa, then you can't play i.e. it's forbidden to remove your kipa for the sake of playing.  Swimming he said you could for sure take it off, however he said that the Chazon Ish wore a swim cap in the water.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding modesty in your own home - Shulchan Aruch O.C. 2:2, referring to getting dressed, says that a person should not say \"I'm alone in my room and no one sees me\" and then sit up without a shirt on (instead of putting the shirt on under the covers - 2:1), because Hashem sees everything.  So whatever is inappropriate in public seems to apply in private.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>R Anthony Manning, in his book on tzniut (<a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/reclaiming-dignity/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reclaiming Dignity</a>) has a section on Tzniut for men (pp. 503ff). He brings a number of sources showing that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tzniut is relevant for men just as for women</li>\n<li>it is relative concept depending on how other men dress locally</li>\n<li>it might also depend on the conditions on that day (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.31b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 31b</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As such, if all men run in shorts and T-shirt, it is very likely to be halachically permitted.

They were then categorized as such, and no new books were allowed to be added to them.</p>\n\n<p>This happened in several stages.  The first stage was for Torah, which was \"closed\" when the Jews entered Israel.  The second stage was for Neviim, which was closed with Churban Bayit Rishon (appx) and the end of Nevua.  And the third stage was Ketuvim, which was closed with Churban Bayit Sheini.  (This also explains why Daniel, for example, is part of Ketuvim and not Neviim.)  After the destruction of both Batei Mikdash, that era of holiness and prophecy was over, and no new books could be added to Torah sheBichtav at all.</p>\n\n<p><em>Source: Yeshiva University's Intro to Bible class</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16219#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi on Malacha 1:1</a> \"The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel in the hand of Malachi\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"in the hand of Malachi\" - [Rashi] It was already delivered into his\n  hand for many days.

Such would <em>seem</em> to defeat the immutability of G-d's Law. This issue of abrogation comes up a lot in both Christian and Muslim circles, since many interpreters of the Christian bible and the Quran posit some sort of abrogation of previous scriptures (the Christians often claim aspects of Torah Law were abrogated and the Muslims have, even within their own canon, laws that are <em>seemingly</em> abrogated, although different jurists rule variably on this latter case).</p>\n\n<p>Am I correct and, equally as important, what are the best verses in the Tanach which proclaim the changeless reality of G-d's Law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Textual indicators abound for the eternal and immutable nature of the Torah.

So shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is fairly clear from these verses that God will never change His commandment prohibiting idolatry.

The veal raising process consists of taking young calves (8 months old- they are babies), limiting their movements (they are raised in stalls that do not allow much space if any to move about) and deliberately feeding them a milk-based diet that contains little to no iron in order for the meat to acquire a beautiful white tinge. The lack of iron leads to anemia which can damage the immune system and cause the calves to feel sick.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Feinstein came out against this practice, citing (among other issues) that it did not actually improve the quality of the meat but only made the meat appear to be 'prettier' due to the white tinge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe in this teshuvah is not dealing with whether or not the animal is kosher, but with the question as to whether the animal may be raised under these circumstances. Since this does not actually improve the meat (Rav Moshe says it is appearance only), then it is forbidden to do so. On the other hand <strong>if</strong> the animal is kosher after slaughter, then it would be edible. The isur of tza'ar ba'alei chaim would not affect the kashrus.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding current practice, here is <a href=\"http://www.ask.com/wiki/Veal#Types\" rel=\"nofollow\">an article</a> that lists the different types of veal and raises the issue of how they are treated. Note that some types are carefully treated to avoid the problem.

    "content": "# What is Ya'aleh Veyavo about?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Ya'aleh Veyavo is said on three occasions: in the third blessing of Birchas Hamazon, in the third to last blessing of Shmoneh Esrei on Rosh Chodesh and Chol Hamoed, and in the Kedushas Hayom (middle blessing of Shmoneh Esrei) of Yom Tov. The common denominator is that it's said whenever you need something generic to say about the day.</p>\n\n<p>However, it's hard to figure out what it really is about. A summary might be: \"May HaShem remember us for good on this holiday and bless us.\" There is no mention of why the holiday is important, and in fact the holiday seems almost incidental to the rest of the prayer.</p>\n\n<p>ArtScroll explains that on holidays we think about Jerusalem, so we ask HaShem to remember it. But this only explains a few words in the prayer.</p>\n\n<p>So what exactly is Ya'aleh Veyavo all about?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rashi to Shabbos 24a s.v. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=24&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ואמר מעין המאורע בעבודה</a> says that Ya'aleh Veyavo is to request mercy on Israel and Jerusalem to return the Temple service to its place and to be able to do the sacrifices of the day.</p>\n\n<p>(I suppose you could try to push back a bit on if that is Rashi's exact intent, but that is how Encyclopedia Talmudis understands it in the entry of Ya'aleh Veyavo).</p>\n\n<p>It is said on days where there are extra sacrifices that are especially missed - Biblical Holidays, Rosh Chodesh and Chol HaMoed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>FWIW, I can give you an idea that I developed with a friend of mine. I don't have an actual source, though this idea is based (however loosely) on the Ramban. </p>\n\n<p>In short: <strong>Ya'aleh Veyavo is a prayer asking for God to judge us favorably</strong>, which is appropriate for the holidays and Rosh Chodesh because they are all mini-judgement days.</p>\n\n<p>By referring to Rosh Hashana as a day of זכרון תרועה, The Torah is telling us that, on this day, we need a זכרון before God, which we accomplish by blowing the shofar. According to the Ramban (Vayikra 23:24, and in his Drasha for Rosh Hashana), this is a reference to the judgement which occurs on Rosh Hashana, and the 'זכרון' that we are seeking refers to a favorable judgement on that day. Hence, this prayer of Ya'aleh Veyavo is using the Torah's terminology (זכרון) for asking God for a favorable judgement, for us, the Jewish people, Yerushalayim, Mashiach, etc. - a perfect prayer for Rosh Hashana. </p>\n\n<p>However, Rosh Hashana isn't the only time when this prayer is said, because Rosh Hashana isn't the only time when the world judged in some way, as the Mishna/Gemara Rosh Hashana states (daf 16a), that on Pesach we're judged for produce, etc. when, during the time of the Beis Hamikdash, we would have performed mitzvos to accomplish something similar to the זכרון as the shofar accomplishes on Rosh Hashana (Ramban in Drasha Rosh Hashana). Thus, the holidays are also a time appropriate for such a prayer. </p>\n\n<p>Rosh Chodesh as well is a mini day of judgement. There are several sources which indicate this, but just to quote one: the Levush (O.C. 422:3) writes that the reason why we don't say a full Hallel on Rosh Chodesh is because it is a day of forgiveness, and therefore הוי כמו ראש השנה \nויוה\"כ שהם ימי דין, \"it's like Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur which are <em>days of judgement</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>While it's true that there are other aspects of each holiday besides for the judgement that occurs on those days (such as the mitzvah of simcha), those also get their mention in the holiday prayer. But even if the דין is only tangential to the message of the holiday itself, it makes sense to be something that we'd want to daven about.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I have long understood ya'aleh v'yavo to be an application of the pasuk in Bemidbar 10:10, וּבְיוֹם שִׂמְחַתְכֶם וּבְמוֹעֲדֵיכֶם וּבְרָאשֵׁי חָדְשֵׁיכֶם וּתְקַעְתֶּם בַּחֲצֹצְרֹת עַל עֹלֹתֵיכֶם וְעַל זִבְחֵי שַׁלְמֵיכֶם וְהָיוּ לָכֶם לְזִכָּרוֹן לִפְנֵי אֱ-לֹהֵיכֶם אֲנִי ה' אֱ-לֹהֵיכֶם.\nThat is, the principal phrase of ya'aleh v'yavo is the first noun that appears after all the verbs, namely, zikhroneinu.  All of the paragraph is an expansion on that theme.  This is clearly why each \"yom simcha\" or mo'ed or rosh chodesh is mentioned in ya'leh v'yavo - it is precisely the point! (I don't think this idea is original with me, but I don't remember where I saw it...)</p>\n\n\n",

Here are some of the sources and arguments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Goren begins with two texts that seems to contradict each other:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Gemara in Yoma(4b) learns that you may not repeat something that you hear because it says (Lev. 1:1), “Now the Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of meeting, saying.” The last word — “saying” (leimor) — seems redundant because the next verse begins with “speak” (dabeir). The Gemara explains that “leimor” teaches us that you have to receive explicit permission in order to repeat something you are told. This is quoted in the Magen Avraham(156:2). Presumably, one would therefore not be allowed to publish a letter without permission.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>However, the Tosefta (Bava Kammach. 7) states that someone who “steals” (overhears) someone else’s teachings may go and repeat the teachings. The Shakh(Yoreh De’ah 292:35) rules, based on this, that you may copy Torah insights from someone else’s book even if he doesn’t want you to do so. Therefore, it would seem that one would be allowed to publish a letter of Torah insights without permission.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To explain the contradiction between the above two sources, Rav Goren posits that the Gemara in Yoma was referring to non-Torah related material while the Tosefta deals with Torah. You need permission to tell someone general information you hear. However, Torah belongs to the entire Jewish people. It is something for which we all have a mitzvah to learn and teach. You do not need permission to repeat a Torah insight that you hear from someone else – in fact, doing so is a mitzvah. <strong>Therefore, technically you are allowed to publish a letter of Torah insights without permission.</strong> However, as a matter of politeness, it is always best to obtain explicit permission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2019/01/publishing-without-permission/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a> with emphasis added</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have now seen that R Moishe Dovid Lebovits answered your question <a href=\"https://thehalacha.com/wp-content/uploads/Vol5Issue17.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> pp. 8-9. He writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One could argue that maybe since the person is not alive the many\nreasons of the cherem would not apply. In addition, one can say that\nif the letters do not say the Hebrew words on it mentioned above [\"pey\ngimmel yud nun daled reish gimel mem hey” which is an abbreviation of\nthe following posuk פרץ גדר ישכנו נחש, see p. 2] it may not apply.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a public figure may be dealt in a different way than an\nordinary person and if the letter is something that one can learn\nTorah from (i.e. a collection of teshuvas) then it may be permitted\nsince it will not be hurting the individual who wrote them. In\naddition if these letters were made public already by being placed in\na library then one may be able to print them all in one book.</p>\n<p>The above reasoning may not apply to writing a biography of a person\nif there will be derogatory information presented in the book.</p>\n<p>Some Gedolim did not want certain teshuovs of theirs printed.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there were those when they wrote teshuvos who did not\npublish the name of those who asked the question since the recipient\nof the letter was not sure if their sender wanted the name to be seen\nin the response if it would be published in a sefer. This was common\namong the writings of Harav Moshe Feinstein zt”l, in the Igros Moshe\nand other works of other Gedolim. [...]</p>\n<p>One who receives a letter is not allowed to publicize it without\npermission. However, if it is Torah it is permitted since we know that\nTorah belongs to everyone.

There are a number of opinions, from <em>rishonim</em> to <em>aharonim</em>, who strongly limit its scope and thereby explain why women are appointed or elected as shul presidents (the classical case in much of recent rabbinic literature), members of <em>Knesset</em> and other positions of leadership.</p>\n\n<p>R Howard Jachter provides a good summary <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/women-and-leadership-by-rabbi-howard-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rambam's major commentaries, the Kesef Mishnah and Radbaz, cite the Sifrei on the aforementioned verse, as the source for\n  the Rambam.  However, the Sifrei merely states, מלך ולא מלכה, that a\n  woman may not be appointed as the nation's leader.  The Rambam does\n  not have an explicit source for the extension of the Sifrei's rule to\n  any position of leadership.</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Although the Rambam rules that a woman may not be appointed to a\n  position of authority, Rav Moshe and Rav Chaim David Halevi (the\n  Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, in an essay published in Techumin\n  01:811-321) note that many Rishonim appear to disagree with the\n  Rambam.</p>\n  \n  <p>Tosafot in Baba Kama 51a (s.v. אשר) write that a woman is permitted to serve as a דיין (a rabbinic judge).  <strong>It is clear that\n  Tosafot believe that a woman can be appointed to a position of\n  authority.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Sefer Hachinuch (Mitzvah 794) cites the Sifrei that a woman may not be appointed as king, yet he does not write that a woman\n  may not be appointed to any position of authority.  Indeed, in the\n  next mitzvah, the prohibition to appoint a convert as king, the Sefer\n  Hachinuch writes that this law does apply to any position of\n  authority.  <strong>Rav Moshe Feinstein writes that this seems to clearly indicate that\n  the Sefer Hachinuch does not agree with the Rambam.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Moshe adds that it appears from both Rashi (s.v. כל) and the Ran (s.v. גרסינן) commenting on Kiddushin 67b that they do not\n  accept the Rambam's ruling.  Rashi and the Ran explain that the source\n  for the rule that a convert may not be appointed to any position of\n  authority is from an extra word in the Torah מקרב אחיך תשים עליך מלך\n  (Devarim 71:51).  The Torah could have merely stated \"שום תשים עליך\n  מלך מקרב אחיך.\"  The fact that the Torah adds another \"תשים\" teaches\n  that the rule forbidding appointment of a convert as king applies to\n  any position of authority.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>It can be readily inferred from this comment of Rashi and the Ran that\n  they disagree with the Rambam.

He explains that since it is a matter of dispute (over a Biblical prohibition) that has not been settled in the Shulchan Aruch, in ordinary circumstances the Rambam should be followed.  Thus, Rav Moshe writes, a woman should not be appointed as a president of a synagogue.  However, in a case of great need, Rav Moshe felt it appropriate to rely on the Rishonim who disagree with the Rambam.  For example, Rav Moshe permitted a poor widow to be appointed as a Kashrut supervisor, despite the fact that it is a position of authority</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayim_David_HaLevi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Chaim David Halevi</a></strong> writes that the Rambam would explain these historical phenomena by stating that women cannot be imposed as leaders over the people.  However, if the people accept her leadership, then the prohibition seems not to apply, Rav Halevi notes that this seems to follow what the aforementioned Rambam and Rashba said about Devora - she could serve as a ruler because the nation accepted her rulings.  According to Rav Halevi a woman is permitted to be elected to a position of authority. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Zion_Meir_Hai_Uziel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Ben-Zion Meir Uziel</a></strong> (former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel) adopts the same position (Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel Choshen Mishpat 6)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Amital\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Yehuda Amital</a></strong> adopted this ruling in practice.

This applies even though the question arose long after semicha ended, showing that we still consider the mesorah as continuing. Within this discussion, you will see that since birds are defined as not kosher based on a list, we consider that one should follow the mesorah as to which birds are kosher and which birds are not. The rabbonim discuss whether or not one can derive simanim as to whether or not an unknown bird is kosher (similar to fins and scales with fish or hoove and cud with animals) but most discussions nowadays rely on mesorah.

So if the person touches an open bottle of wine, that wine would become prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>If the wine is <em>mevushal</em>, though, there is no issue of <em>yayin nesech</em> because the wine is not considered fit for <em>avoda zara</em> libations. My experience is that most <em>shuls</em> use wine that is <em>mevushal</em> to get around the problem of someone attending <em>kiddush</em> who does not keep <em>shabbat</em>. Therefore, I would assume that your <em>shul</em> probably is also using <em>mevushal</em> wine and there is no problem.

Wine only becomes nesech when used for a ritual in the name of an  avoda Zara. However when a goy moves the wine it becomes yayin stam. There is a HUGE difference, yayin nesech is assure b'hana (forbidden to derive benefit), and nesech is forbidden on a biblical level.

For example the blasphemer in the Bible is the son of a Jewish woman of the tribe of Dan (so he was Jewish) and an Egyptian man. Part of the explanation of the dispute is that he was not considered a member of the tribe of Dan. This is explained by Rashi from the Medrash.</p>\n<p>Vayikra 24:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>י וַיֵּצֵא, בֶּן-אִשָּׁה יִשְׂרְאֵלִית, וְהוּא בֶּן-אִישׁ מִצְרִי,\nבְּתוֹךְ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל; וַיִּנָּצוּ, בַּמַּחֲנֶה, בֶּן<br />\nהַיִּשְׂרְאֵלִית, וְאִישׁ הַיִּשְׂרְאֵלִי.    10 And the son of an\nIsraelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the\nchildren of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of\nIsrael strove together in the camp.</p>\n<p>יא וַיִּקֹּב בֶּן-הָאִשָּׁה\nהַיִּשְׂרְאֵלִית אֶת-הַשֵּׁם, וַיְקַלֵּל, וַיָּבִיאוּ אֹתוֹ,   אֶל-מֹשֶׁה; וְשֵׁם אִמּוֹ שְׁלֹמִית בַּת-דִּבְרִי, לְמַטֵּה-דָן.<br />\n11. And the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed;\nand they brought him unto Moses. And his mother's name was Shelomith,\nthe daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A person who is not Jewish because his mother is not Jewish, cannot be considered a member of his father's tribe. For example, Shmuel hanavi wrote the book of Ruth in order to prove that Ruth was a valid convert. Thus, her son by Boaz was a legitimate member of the tribe of Judah and inherited the status of Boaz as being in the \"kingly line\". Otherwise, David could not have become king. Thus, a person descended from a Jewish father and a nonJewish mother is <strong>never</strong> considered part of the Jew's \"line\". Therefore a person <strong>cannot</strong> be considered a member of the Davidic line if he is not halachically Jewish (or a convert).</p>\n<p>The bible (Deuteronymy 17:15) also forbids a nonJew (or convert) from becoming king because he is not a born Jew.</p>\n<p>If a kohen has a child with a non-Jewish woman, none of their children are of the tribe of Levi. If a regular Yisrael has children with a non-Jewish woman, none of their children are members of his tribe or can inherit from him. See also the intermarriage statement in the book of Ezra that the men had to send away the non-Jewish wives and children.</p>\n\n\n",

MANY GEDOLIM (INCLUDING Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, the Novominsker Rebbe; four Roshai Yeshiva from Lakewood: Rabbis Malkiel Kotler, Yisroel Tzvi Neuman, Dovid Tzvi Schustal and Yeruchem Olshin as well as the Mashgiach Rabbi Mattisyahu Salamon; Rabbi Shmuel Birnbaum, Mirer Rosh Yeshiva, The Roshai Yeshiva of Philadelphia Rabbis Elya Svei and Shmuel Kaminetsky; Rabbi Aron Moshe Shechter, Rosh Yeshiva Chaim Berlin) SIGNED A LETTER THAT STATES, “THE HOSTS SHOULD INSIST THAT THE MUSIC AMPLIFICATION SHOULD RESPECT THE FACTORS OF GOOD HEALTH AND TASTE, AND NOT DETRACT FROM THE ESSENCE OF A YIDDISHE [SIMCHA].” SIMCHAS ARE MEANT TO CELEBRATE MITZVOS. IT WOULD BE HIGHLY INCONSISTENT TO CELEBRATE MITZVOS BY ALLOWING LOUD MUSIC THAT CAUSES PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THOSE PRESENT. THE SIMCHAS BEIS HA’SHOEIVAH IN THE BEIS HA’MIKDASH DID NOT HAVE LOUD AMPLIFIERS AND PROVOKED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SIMCHA THAN THE GREAT SIMCHAS WE ARE ZOCHEH TO HAVE TODAY. THOSE WHO DEMONSTRATE - LOVE OF A FELLOW JEW - אהבת ישרא-ל BY RESPECTING THE HEALTH AND HAPPINESS OF THOSE PRESENT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASE THEIR LEVEL OF SIMCHA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the following response (<a href=\"http://choshvei.blogspot.com/2006/05/bands-loud-music-and-torah-law-dont.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">posted on \"Choshvei Shemo\"</a>) further addresses the issue of loud music in the context of halacha (Jewish law):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>WHAT DOES THE TORAH SAY ABOUT LOUD MUSIC AND OTHER WAYS ONE CAN DAMAGE ANOTHER'S HEARING?</p>\n  \n  <p>1) In the Talmud, we learn as follows:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"...If he makes him deaf, he pays his (the victims') entire value\" (Bava Kamma 85b).</p>\n  \n  <p>RaSH\"I comments on the above that one who causes another deafness has to pay the entire market-value as a deaf person \"is not fitting for anything\". The Talmud discusses other types of bodily damage, listing the fine of the damager as significantly less than the punishment of one who inflicts deafness upon another. Rabbeinu Yonah says, the person is no longer worth anything when he is lacking his bodily function of hearing. Meaning, hearing is such an essential component in a person's existence that lacking it takes away a significant part of his value (assuming his value on the market, his total value).</p>\n  \n  <p>2) In Torah law, if one causes injury to oneself (as well as to another), they transgress \"bal tashchis d'gufo\". \"Bal tashchis d'gufo\" is the prohibition for one to cause any type of injury or damage to oneself or to another. Examples of transgressing this prohibition is smoking and playing loud music.</p>\n  \n  <p>3) \"Chovel B'Chavero\": This is the prohibition of one who \"causes damage to another\".</p>\n  \n  <p>4) \"V'Ahavta L'Reiacha Kamocha\": The Torah commandment to \"love your fellow as yourself\". One is obligated to act toward another in a way that demonstrates consideration for the other person. When one plays loud music that potentially damages another's hearing, he/she is transgressing the Torah commandment of \"love your fellow as yourself\".</p>\n  \n  <p>5) \"Chillul HaShem\": \"Profaning the Name of G-d\" - When a Jew transgresses the Torah by misrepresenting the Torah, especially in a way that potentially brings others (both Jew and non-Jew) to look upon them, and, consequently, at the Torah way of life in a disdainful way, they commit the severe sin of \"profaning the Name of G-d\". When Jewish bands play music at an unhealthily loud volume, they misrepresent the Torah. People may look down upon Torah law for \"allowing\" such loud music. The Torah actually prohibits such loud music for a number of reasons (at least some of them are mentioned here).</p>\n  \n  <p>6) Theft (according to the Torah): Aside from stealing by damaging hearing, a band can transgress the Torah prohibition of theft by refusing to lower the volume of their music. If the people who hire the band request the band to lower the volume and they refuse, only to walk out of the simcha (celebration) rather than play less loudly, they are stealing from those who hire them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I.e. - the light turns green only when it senses there is a pedestrian? Would it matter if it would be dangerous to cross anywhere else on that street other than where the light is?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This sounds like a case of p'sik reisha d'nicha lei - melacha that will surely happen, even though it's not one's purpose in whatever he's doing, which he wants to happen. (A similar case is walking up a path which has motion sensor lights; the <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/01-17-14/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">peninei halacha</a> says that that is a case of p'sik reisha d'nicha lei).</p>\n<p>A p'sik reisha d'nicha lei has the same status as doing the issur on purpose (see rambam shabbos 1:6), which means that this depends on whether <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12572/why-cant-electricity-be-manipulated-on-shabbat-and-yom-tov\">electricity on shabbos is an issur derabanan or de'oraysa</a>. If it's de'oraysa, there's very little wiggle room, outside of pikuach nefesh,to cause the light to change. If it's derabanan, there may be some possibilities that allow it; for example: if he's going to do a mtizva, or if otherwise there'd be tircha detzibura (time wasted for the community), or monetary loss, it may be allowed.</p>\n<p>If there's another derabanan involved, like having a goy change the light, then that would make it easier to allow (whether it's originally de'oraysa or derabanan).</p>\n<p>All in all, there is seemingly at least some level of issur in causing the light to change, and if possible it should be avoided (e.g. by waiting for a goyish pedestrian to change the light of his own volition, or crossing elsewhere). If that is not possible, then there are ways to limit the chumrah of the issur, thereby making extenuating circumstances easier to allow.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If one doesn't mind crossing on red, then this would be a case of p'sik reisha d'lo ichpat lei - a p'sik reisha whose effect he doesn't care for. There is a machlokes acharonim whether this is considered a \"regular\" p'sik reisha, which I've already talked about, or a p'sik reisha d'lo nicha lei - one whose effects he doesn't want to happen (the severity of which is in itself a machlokes rishonim whether it's completely muttar or an issur derabanan).</p>\n<p>If I remember correctly, the general consensus is that a \"d'lo ichpat lei\" is considered like a \"d'lo nicha lei\", which we hold is an issur derabanan. Therefore, if electricity is de'oraysa, the issur is now derabanan, and if electricity is derabanan, it's now a double derabanan, with all of the ramifications mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>(Because there are those who hold that a \"d'lo nicha lei\" is completely allowed, we may be allowed to use that as another point in favor of allowing to change the light, especially if we hold electricity is derabanan, as a sort of s'fek derabanan l'kula situation. When and how this can be used is outside the scope of this answer).</p>\n<p>As always, CYLOR for an actual p'sak in this matter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Changing the light <em>b'shinui</em> might also work to lower the level of the issur, but if I remember correctly, a shinui only works if the <em>actual issur</em> is done differently, which I didn't fully understand but apparently makes this case one where a shinui wouldn't work.</p>\n\n\n",

I, #43</em>) He ruled that the fruit belong to the owner of the vine. Rav Moshe explains that although the Gemara (B.B. 27b) debates whether bikkurim can be brought from a tree whose roots or branches extend into someone else's property, ownership of the fruit is determined solely by where the stem emanates from the ground. Since the vine's stem emanates from your neighbor's property, even the clusters of grapes over the fence are his. The Rama also rules that the branches follow the base of the tree.

The same would seem true of branches that interfere with someone else's private property. <strong>Nonetheless, despite your right to trim these branches, the fruit belong to their owner.</strong>\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Dayan and Mr. Adler washed and sat down for Seuda Shlishis. They helped themselves to some whitefish salad.</p>\n  \n  <p>Mr. Adler turned to Rabbi Dayan, \"Would it make a difference whether the neighbor is Jewish or not?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"No,\" replied Rabbi Dayan. \"Rav Moshe writes explicitly that since monetary ownership is determined solely by the stem, there is no difference between a Jew and a non-Jew. Stealing from a non-Jew is also prohibited.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Mr. Adler took a drink and thought for a moment of the grapes that fell to the ground. He turned again to Rabbi Dayan, \"What about individual grapes that fall onto the ground?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"In principle, there is no difference between whole clusters and individual grapes,\" said Rabbi Dayan. \"Both belong to your neighbor. However, in practice, we can assume that he is interested only in the whole clusters, not in individual grapes that fall into your yard. Therefore, you can typically take individual grapes that fall, since he most likely doesn't mind, but you cannot take the clusters without asking his permission.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Nor does the passage [on Eruvin 100b] stand alone. The wide-ranging concept of <em>derekh eretz</em> -- roughly the equivalent of what Coventry Patmore called \"traditions of civility\" -- points in the same direction.

(Leaving aside Ashkenzi vs Sephardi, which is mostly a matter of <em>minhag</em>.)  However, in recent years there has been an explosion of division among Jewry, and now we've got almost a dozen, not even including all the different Hassidic groups.  This appears to be a return to the situation at the end of Bayit Sheini, and that situation is reflected in the halakha and hashkafa from that time.  (For example, please see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/34509/880\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/34509/880</a>)</p>\n\n<p>What are the contemporary halakhic and hashkafic implications of this trend?</p>\n\n<p>(Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13788/what-is-the-orthodox-view-towards-the-existence-of-a-progressive-denomination\">What is the orthodox view towards the existence of a progressive denomination?</a>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There have been several different sects of Judaism almost since the beginning of the religion.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>The oldest movements were Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes and Zealots</li>\n  <li>Medieval movements included Karaites and Rabbinical Judaism</li>\n  <li>Rabbinical Judaism split into Chasidic, Orthodox, Reform and    Conservative in the US today</li>\n  <li>Other countries have similar movements differently named  </li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/movement.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there has always been a diversity of opinions and movements in Judaism.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The most recent splits are commonly recognized to be a result of\n  German Jews to assimilate and modernize the parts of Judaism that they\n  viewed as outdated.  </p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.reformjudaism.org/history-reform-judaism-and-look-ahead-search-belonging\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The complexity of the Jewish people and their practices has long been a part of our history and is in no way a new phenomenon. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question ignores the reality of the twelve shvatim. Each with its own personality, its own sanhedrin, in some instances a definable different pronunciation of words and according to the Arizal different nuschaos hatefila. </p>\n\n<p>Having separate smaller groups is not necessarily a bad thing. I will relate a drasha I heard from one of my rebbeim in beis medrash. While at Har Sinai, the Torah describes the state of the fledgling nation as being at the apex of unity, as one man with one heart. And yet the medrash tells us that when klal yisroel saw the angels parading in separate groups, each with their own flag, Klal Yisroel requested to be separated into tribes and Hashem agreed. What happened? Isn't this disharmony in action? And the answer given was that for each person to feel special and connected to Hashem they need a clearly defined role as part of a smaller microcosm, not to feel like one drop in an endless sea of 600,000, but rather to be part of the smaller group of the tens of thousands. As long as we all recognize each other right to worship Hashem in that person's group and associated style, than diversity can be beautiful. However, as far as interaction between various groups go, most orthodox denominations will not accept a group as being part of Jewish diversity if that group ignores the basic tenets of Judaism, such as adhering to halakha. And the vast majority of orthodox groups do not actively try to convince any other orthodox group that they are soley correct, and that the other needs to change.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is Adar 1 30 days long?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud Ta'anit 6b says אין בין אדר הראשון לאדר השני אלא קריאת המגילה ומתנות לאביונים\n\"There is no difference between the 1st Adar and 2nd Adar except for reading the Megillah and giving presents to the poor.\"</p>\n\n<p>If there are no other differences, then, since Adar 2 is 29 days long, why isn't Adar 1 also 29 days long?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The mishna is speaking on a halachic basis and not on the actual length. That is, we follow the same halachos except that Taanis Esther and Purim are pushed to the second Adar (which was the original month) in order to be close to Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>What I meant was the usage of ain bain in the mishnah as expressed talks about the halachos of the month and does not deal with the length of the month. Technically, the length of <strong>every</strong> month can be either 29 or 30 days based on when the witnesses arrive at the Sanhedrin. The fact that the fixed calendar was set up later is a separate matter and based on mathematics and designed to make the minimal change at the latest time possible in the year.</p>\n\n<p>The basic lunar cycle is 29.5 days (plus a fraction - 44 minutes + 1/1080 of an hour called a cheilek). As a result, the lunar year should (approximately) alternate 29 and 30 day months. The lunar year is therefore 353, 354, or 355 days long as opposed to the 365.25 day solar year. Since the difference builds up to a full month after three years, an extra month needs to be added to the year. In order to make up the difference, and keep the  relative new moon position (and keep Pesach after the spring equinox) we need to \"round up\" the 29.5 days to 30 days. This therefore makes a leap year 383, 384, and 385 days so that the net number of days over the 19 year cycle comes out even (lunar and solar). There are 7 leap years in a 19 year cycle. Had the intercalary month been 29 days, the 19 year cycle would have lost a full week and would have continued to get out of sync.</p>\n\n<p>The 19 year cycle is actually not quite completely accurate because the solar leap year is not rigidly every four years. Those \"century years\" which are not divisible by 400 are not leap year (no February 28) according to the Gregorian calendar (such as 1900). As a result, Pesach has been getting \"later\" in the solar year as the centuries go on. Eventually, the Sanhedrin will have to \"skip\" a leap year when the current fixed calendar says it should be one and make it the next year. I discuss this and the reasoning behind it at <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2013/12/what-will-happen-to-calendar-if.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">What will happen to the calendar if the Sanhedrin is re-instituted</a>. Of course the necessity for this is not for a long time and the Mashiach will have come before that happens, so the Sanhedrin will have been established and we will no longer be on the fixed calendar.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The rule is <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=27&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">אין למודין מן הכללות ואפילו במקום שנאמר בו חוץ</a> - we do not apply general rules absolutely, even if the rule list exclusions - there may be more exclusions.</p>\n\n<p>So the fact that there is a specific list of exceptions does not preclude there being others. This is why it is no issue that it doesn't list Meshalach Monos.</p>\n\n<p>In this case the <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%90_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">רע\"ב on the Mishna</a> says הכי קאמר אין בין ארבעה עשר וחמשה עשר של אדר ראשון לארבעה עשר וחמשה עשר של אדר שני, אלא מקרא מגילה ומתנות לאביונים, הא לענין הספד ותענית זה וזה שוין - that it is only talking about the differences on the 14th and 15th of Adar in Adar Rishon vs. Adar Sheini, not any other differences in the month.</p>\n\n\n",

However, other halakhic laws might still apply in theory, but R. Frank (Sheelos UTeshuvos Zeraim 2:43) extends this logic to say that all government or corporate owned buildings are exempt from mezuzah, removing chametz, and the like. Similarly, R. Moshe Shternbach holds that a person doesn't have a shared ownership in the company, he merely owns the shares, and so is allowed to own shares in a company that keeps chametz over Pesach, for example (Moadim UZmanim 1:54)</p></li>\n<li><p>The Minchas Yitzchak (1:3, 4:1) says that corporations with Jewish shareholders are subject to Jewish laws, but probably not biblically.

Rambam and Radak both explain that there was an actual difference: the prophet of <em>navi</em> would fall asleep and have a vision, while the author of <em>kesuvim</em> would write while 'inspired' while awake under divine inspiration. <strong>R. Bachya</strong> (Vayikra 8:8) develops this idea as well, that the prophet of <em>navi</em> was removed from physicality during his vision, which wasn't the case with authors of kesuvim. (And it's possible for higher-level prophets, even Moshe, to also sometimes receive lower level prophecy, which is how he can be credited with writing Iyov.) Radak also adds (in his intro) that Divrei Hayamim was added to <em>Kesuvim</em> because it's mainly about history. </p>\n\n<p><strong>R. Menachem Meiri</strong> (into to Tehillim):</p>\n\n<p>He rejects the Rambam, 1) because Tehillim and Daniel have real prophecies in them and 2) because the same people who were prophets also wrote <em>Kesuvim</em>. Therefore, he says that the difference is in purpose or context: <em>Neviim</em> were written by prophets who were specifically sent by God to admonish the people, and the <em>Kesuvim/'writings'</em> are just that; containing advice, poetry, and history (future history is also history).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abarbanel</strong> (Mayyanei Hayeshua 3:2)</p>\n\n<p>has a similar approach as that of the Meiri, as he states that the entire difference was in mission. Neviim were people whose mission it was to go out and prophecize among the people, and Kesuvim were prophecies that <em>God</em> instructed them to write down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Netziv</strong> (Haamek Sheilah, intro to Sheiltos no. 8)</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Neviim</em> were written in 'the language of God', and the <em>Kesuvim</em> were written in the language of man. (I think he means that the perspective of the author is different, but I'm not sure)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chiddushei HaGrach vehaGriz</strong> to Bava Basra 15a: </p>\n\n<p>R. Chaim of Brisk was recorded as saying that the Neviim were instructed to first state their prophecies orally, and then write them down, while the authors of Kesuvim were instructed in the reverse: to write their prophecies and then read them from a text. (I'm not sure what to make of the theological significance of this difference) However, R. Chaim's son R. Yitzchak Zev had several questions on this explanation discussed there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>R. Yitzchak Hutner</strong> (Pachad Yitzchak Shavuos 2)</p>\n\n<p>While the levels of the divinity of prophecy (and therefore their holiness) may be the same, Kesuvim represent a more 'hidden' form of prophecy, and Neviim are more openly revealed (which I believe means easier to understand). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The gemora in Meggila 3a states that Daniel was not considered a prophet whereas Chaggai Zecharya and Malachi were. Rashi s.v. Inhu Nevii explains that they were sent as God's messengers with a message for Israel, whereas although Daniel saw great prophetic visions, he was not sent as a messenger to Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the gemora in Meggila 7a seems to imply that in order for a book to cause one's hands to become ritually impure (Tameh), a condition which applies to all books in Kesuvim, it needs to have been written with Ruach Hakodesh.</p>\n\n<p>This would seem to imply that in order for a book to qualify for categorization as Prophets/Neviim it would need to contain prophesy sent as a message for eternity to Israel, and in order to qualify for Writings/Kesuvim it needs to have been written with (at least) Ruach Hakodesh.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In actuality, the neviim were those who were</p>\n\n<p>a.

That is why we constantly see that the Torah says \"Vayedaber Hashem el Moshe laimor\". That is, Hashem told Moshe something and then commanded him to repeat it to the people and later to write it down. The Neviim that we have were also commanded to be written down so that it would be passed down to future generations. An example is in Bava Basra 15a quoting Jereiah 36:18 where Baruch (Jeremiah's scribe) said that Jeremiah dictated the prophesies that were to be passed down to future generations and he (Baruch) wrote them in the scroll with ink.</p>\n\n<p>Those items that were not originally nevua, but were written down in order to pass down wisdom (such as Mishlei), or haskafa (such as Shir HaShirim), or for a psak (like Megilas Rus), or for historical reasons (such as Ezra or Divrei Hayamim) are part of kesuvim. The Anshei Kneses Hagedolah determined which writings actually were to be canonized and passed down to future generations. The particulars of who wrote what are discussed in Maseches Bava Basra 14b.</p>\n\n<p>A navi who revealed a prophesy without being commanded (even though Hashem had given him the prophesy) is actually a \"false prophet\" as I state <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2011/09/false-prophet-can-sometimes-tell-truth.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">False Prophet can sometimes tell the truth</a></p>\n\n<p>The explanation there includes the reference to Hananiah be Azzur, \"the prophet who was from Gibeon\" Rashi and others explain that he really was a prophet and that his sin was to make a deduction from the prophesy that was given to Jeremiah. Part of the explanation from some of the meforshim is that when Hashem would give a prophesy, every prophet would hear it, but also would know to whom it was directed and who was being commanded to pass it on or to perform an action. Only that prophet who was being commanded would be allowed to pass it on. Thus we see, that to be included in Neviim, the prophet had to be given a direct message from Hashem (at whatever level was appropriate as Rambam explains) and commanded to pass it on. </p>\n\n<p>Everything else that was canonized as appropriate for transmission by Anshei Knesses Hagedolah would be in the class of Kesuvim. The reason could differ as I said above, even though it was accepted by them as appropriate and to be included (at that lower lever).</p>\n\n\n",

The words of the Torah were specifically for the history, halachos, and hashkafa of Bnei Yisrael. Thus Moshe wrote it at the lower level of nevua set up for Kesuvim.</p>\n\n<p>The Chumash is like the Neviim in that they were given as a message by Hashem to the Navi with instructions to repeat them to Bnei Yisrael. They were then written down (also as instructed by Hashem. That is why we see Vayedaber Hashem el Moshe Laimor constantly. Just as Moshe was given the prophecy, he was explicitly commanded to tell everyone.

I realize that this is somewhat circular reasoning, but in this case we have to say that not finding them in the Torah is the evidence that they were not commanded to be there, since only those things that were explicitly commanded (and dictated) are to be found in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, only those things that are told by Hashem to a navi (such as Shmuel, Nasan, Gad, Yechezkel, Yirmiyahu, etc) and commanded to be passed on to Bnei Yisrael (and written) as nevua can be part of Neviim. Anything else, even if written with Ruach Hakodesh, can only rise to the level of Kesuvim. Note that Kesuvim are only those things that Anshei Knesses Hagedolah accepted as part of Kesuvim. There were other writing that were not accepted and nothing written after Anshei Knesses Hagedolah (that is after Megillas Esther) closed the canon can be accepted as such. The 120 members of Anshei Knesses Hagedolah included the last of the neviim. That is why the books of the Maccabees are not part of Kesuvim. For example, David Hamelech compiled all the songs of praise that had been sung since Adam and put them into a single document (Tehillim), or the wisdom of Solomon was compiled and put into a volume for future study (Mishlei) - and accepted by Anshei Knesses Hagedolah as part of Kesuvim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Gemara actually records several opinions as to who wrote Job, and when (or whether) he lived.

The reason for the redundancy, explains the Abarbanel, is that David could have still been a prophet (had reached the requisite level and have been shown visions of prophecy), but <em>while writing Tehilim</em>, could merely be writing through 'inspiration', <em>ruach hakodesh</em>. Thus, Moshe could have been the greatest of all prophets, but written Job with only divine inspiration, not divine instruction. </p>\n\n<p>However, your question is certainly a valid one; it was among the reasons why the Meiri (intro to Tehillim) rejected the position of the Rambam that the categorization of books depends on the level of prophecy with which they were written. </p>\n\n\n",

In Israel, I have recently encountered people who will not eat certain fruits or vegetables (strawberries, figs, cabbage, etc.) which they render 'uncheckable'. I was directed to the reputable <a href=\"http://www.kosharot.co.il/show_hadracha.asp?id=49674\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kosharot</a> website when trying to check a cabbage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פוסקי הדור מציינים שבגלל כמה סיבות שונות אין לאדם רגיל (שאין לו הכשרה מיוחדת  בבדיקת ירקות עלים) להשתמש בירקות עלים לא מפוקחים ומכונים בפי כל \"ירקות גוש קטיף</p>\n<p>The decisors of [halacha of this] generation mark that, for a number of different reasons, a regular person (who has no special preparation in checking leaf vegetables) is not to use leaf vegetables not supervised and nicknamed in everyone's speech \"Gush Katif vegetables\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found it strange that some vegetables are 'impossible' to be check for bugs, unless you are an expert. Certainly 'bug problems' now are no worse than the situations that our ancestors encountered. Why, nowadays, would some things be forbidden on the grounds that some bugs are impossible to be found/removed? Perhaps I am naive in thinking that all vegetables/fruits were eaten in the past as long as they were checked - perhaps they weren't, for this reason. If anyone can shed light on this it would be most appreciated.</p>\n<p>(As an aside I went on a tiyul in Israel where our tour guide pointed out a hefker fig tree, picked a fig, opened it, spent time checking it and ate it. Another member of the tour said that his Rosh Yeshiva forbids eating figs because they cannot be checked.

When in the relatively recent past it has been discovered that many fruits and vegetables formally thought to be bug free are actually bug-ridden, such as cabbage, strawberries etc. there was no longer a common tradition as to how to check them, and we did not grow up with the awareness of the bugs that we need to look for. As a result there are those that say that these fruits and vegetables are no longer able to be checked by untrained eyes.</p>\n\n<p>I can tell you from personal experience that checking a fig is extremely difficult. I was shown by someone who knows how to check them how similar the worms that infest them look to the seeds, and how without knowing what to look for it would be very easy to overlook them, thinking they are just another seed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is Vayikra 20:27 at the end of the chapter?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This verse in Parshat Kedoshim - Vayikra (Leviticus) <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0320.htm#27\" rel=\"nofollow\">20:27</a>, <em>\"A man or a woman who has a ghost or a familiar spirit shall be put to death; they shall be pelted with stones—their bloodguilt shall be upon them,\"</em> is the last verse of the chapter.  However, it appears to be in the <strong>wrong place.</strong>  This verse should be much earlier in the chapter, specifically after verse 6 (<em>\"And if any person turns to ghosts and familiar spirits...\"</em>).  In addition, the chapter has logically ended with the <em>previous</em> verse (<em>\"You shall be holy to Me, for I the Lord am holy...\"</em>).  <strong>#</strong></p>\n\n<p>I looked at all the usual commentators, and I didn't find an answer.</p>\n\n<p><sub><strong>#</strong> Additionally, there is a paragraph break after this verse, and the next chapter is a new topic starting with <em>\"The Lord said to Moses...\"</em></sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To my mind, it sums up an important idea -- that with all of the things that we have been taught to be forbidden in the quest for holiness, we might be tempted to justify them by attaching them to seemingly appropriate behavior. The final pasuk teaches that even if you try to justify improper behavior, it is still improper.</p>\n\n<p>What I wrote years ago follows:</p>\n\n<p>Kedoshim – Pasuk 27 indicates that if there is a man or woman “in whom there is” (asher bahem) “ov o yid’oni” – two types of necromancy as defined by Rashi and others on 19:31, the penalty is death. Rashi on 27 clarifies that the punishment is excision until there are proper witnesses and warning; this way, this pasuk is distinguished from 20:6. But why would Rashi find any connection between these 2 particular pesukim? In 20:6, the person involved (subject to Karet, excision or excommunication) was only turning to consult the necromancer whereas in 27, there was actual necromancy \"in\" the person deserving the punishment. Rashi could simply have invoked the Talmudic discussion (which references the same law in Devarim and is mentioned in Sanhedrin) which he alludes to in 19:31 about the difference between consulting and becoming a practitioner. A second point, though, is in the words ov and yid’oni. Both seem to refer to something which would be laudable – ov, similar to “av” or father (the [ancestral?] spirit/ghost consulted) or yid’oni (similar to the word “yode’a”, knowing). Looking for advice from a father or from a source of knowledge should be a commendable end, but if our means is through a forbidden necromancy, we cannot justify those ends and we cannot let even the quest for knowledge bind us to the abominable practices of the goyim.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Pure fancy on my part; take it for what it is worth.  </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Abarbanel</strong> asks this exact question (\"אין ספק שבא הפסוק הזה שלא במקומו\"), and appears to answer that the reason is because a practitioner of these magics does not belong among the nation of Hashem (\"ואין ראוי שישב בתוך עם ה\").  It's possible to understand this as saying that the reason the verse is outside the rest of the chapter is to emphasize the degree that such a person should be banished from among the people.</p>\n<p><sub> But he does <strong>not</strong> say this explicitly.</sub></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Seforno</strong> says that the reason is to emphasize the capital punishment given to such a person.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומאחר שהיתה הכונה בכל אלה לקדש את ישראל הנה מי שיסור מזה באוב או ידעוני אשר ענינם כולו ברוח טומאה על היפך כל המכוון ראוי שיסקל בלי ספק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub> However, I don't understand why this sin is singled out, as the beginning of the chapter talks about people who sacrifice their children to Molech, which seems to be much worse.</sub></p>\n<hr />\n<p>As noted in several places (ex. <a href=\"http://classic.net.bible.org/passage.php?passage=Lev%2020:6,27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), the fact that verse 27 is at the end forms a <em>chiasm \\ inclusio \\ envelope</em> around much of this chapter (between v.2-27 or v.6-27).</p>\n<p><strong>Daat Mikra</strong> writes <em>(my translation; paraphrased)</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The end of the chapter parallels the beginning (v. 6).  The reason is to emphasize against these sins. The paragraph ends with one detail after it concluded the general rules, similar to Deut 14:21.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of this structure, and the special significance of <em>Ov and Yidoni,</em> is explained by <a href=\"http://www.tanach.org/vayikra/kdosh3.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Leibtag</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From a thematic angle, based on Sefer Devarim, OV & YID'ONI takes on additional significance.  See Devarim 18:9-15 where the Torah forbids us to approach any type of 'future teller' or 'soothsayer' including the OV & YID'ONI.  Note how similar those psukim are to Vayikra chapter 18!!  There, the Torah explains how we must follow the guidance of a NAVI, and not look for guidance from those who use 'other methods'.</p>\n<p>Every nation has its spiritual leaders.  To become an AM KADOSH, we must be sure not to follow after these people who offer 'shortcuts' to spirituality by 'bringing up the dead' or 'reading palms' etc.  As God's nation, we must recognize that our fate is solely in the hands of God, and thus a direct function of our deeds.  Belief that certain events are pre-determined or believing that by bringing up the dead we can get an 'inside word' on what will happen, etc. negates the very basics of Judaism and our belief in 'hashgachat Hashem' as a function of our deeds. [see daily kriyat shma etc. / 've-akamal']</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Academic scholarship</strong> <em>(cf. Anchor Bible et al.)</em> offers the following opinions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Scribal error.  This verse was meant to be included earlier in the chapter, but it was accidentally skipped and got inserted at the end instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Added later.  This law was written later than the others, and was thus appended at a later date.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sub>However, there is no evidence for either of these answers, and the second is particularly problematic.</sub></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Another opinion I saw is that this verse is a transition to the next chapter, which talks about Kohanim and dead bodies.  <sub> (I don't see how, though. I get the dead connection, but don't see the leap to Kohanim.) </sub></p>\n\n\n",

However, there are those who state that in actuality, the announcement each Shabbos Mevorchim is the equivalent of our continuing to accept the fixed calendar by the bais din. As a result, if there were ever a month in which it was not declared, the calendar could become batel. There are also those who say that this applies only in Eretz Yisroel and that this is also the reason that the time announced is always Yerushalayim (Solar) time.

This commandment is of great importance because the dates of the festivals, including over 60 commandments, depend on it. In addition to sanctifying months according to the appearance of the New Moon, the Hebrew calendar depends on leap years (extended by an extra month) that depend on the position of the Sun, ripeness of grains, etc.\n  For over a thousand years, the Hebrew calendar has been fixed by calculation. Today, the Hebrew calendar does not match that fixed by observing the Moon. Even thought the gap between the two calendars continues to increase, we do not have the authority to alter the calendar until a new Sanhedrin (religious high court) is reestablished and is widely recognized. While sanctification of the month according to observation is not practiced today it is important to carry out calculations and practice observing the New Moon in order to be ready for when the Sanhedrin is reestablished. Likewise, there is increasing involvement in the Temple, red heifer, etc. Of course, we are not intending to change the current calendar (this is a task for an authorized Sanhedrin) but just to increase involvement in and embellish the Torah.<br>\n  In recent years, a number of individuals and groups have begun to observe the Moon each month to practice for the commandment of observing the Moon and for determining criteria for the limits of visibility. The is still plenty of room to improve on the existing criteria using observations and analyzing them in relation to physical, meteorological and physical parameters. We, the Israeli New Moon Society, are asking the public at large to join us by trying to observe the New Moon at the beginning of each month. The Israeli New Moon Society was founded for this purpose by Rabbi Dr. Nachum Rabinovitch, head of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe, Maale Adumim. The society works with the Institude for Kiddush Hachodesh Studies and includes scientists and rabbis from Universities, Yeshivot and elsewhere.<br>\n  The Israeli New Moon Society presents the subject from the point of view of Rabbinical Orthodox Judaism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>'Mevarchim Chodesh', by the way, is called in most mizrahi siddurim 'Hachrazat Hachodesh'</p>\n\n<p>Many count 'kiddush hachodesh' to be a mitzvah (Rambam Aseh 153, Chinuch 3).

But he doesn't say he's exempt from the lashes of cooking or eating meat and milk together.</p>\n\n<p>Doesn't this undermine RaMBa\"M's point that Kosher-species meat that is unKosher for other reasons is exempt from the added prohibitions of meat/milk mixtures?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam never permitted cooking Nevelah meat with milk. He only permitted deriving benefit from the mixture. Cooking Nevelah meat with milk is still prohibited (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5209.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maachalot Asurot 9:6</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Firstly, one must distinguish between Gid Hanasheh and Achilat Neveilah. Secondly one must distinguish between the Nekudah Hanifla'ah and the principle of Ein Issur Chal Al Issur. Finally we must deal with why the principle of Ein Issur Chal Al issur doesn't apply when cooking the Gid Hanashe with milk. This final question strikes me as extremely interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Gid Hanashe is a nerve found within the hindquarter of a kosher animal, while a neveilah is an animal which has not been killed with a kosher shechitah.</p>\n\n<p>The principle of Ein Issur Chal al Issur states that once something is prohibited, additional reasons for prohibiting it do not take effect. The Nekudah hanifla'ah says that milk and neveilah isn't an exception to Ein Issur Chal al Issur despite the fact that it seemingly falls under the category of issur mosif. This is explained more thoroughly in the link you provided.</p>\n\n<p>The reason Gid Hanasheh is prohibited to mix with milk despite ein issur chal al issur is in my opinion due to the fact that Gid Hanasheh has a Tzvei Dinim (dual nature) of being both meat and Gid Hanasheh. Although the prohibition to eat the Gid Hanasheh is already in place at the time of cooking the meat with milk, since any meat which wasn't part of the Gid Hanashe would become \"treif\" through the cooking process, we can apply the principle of Issur Kolel (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9849/issur-kolel-what-is-it\">Issur Kolel What is it?</a>) to extend this new prohibition to even the Gid Hanasheh. </p>\n\n\n",

He also does this in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/k/q/q0213.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 13</a>:14, And <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/k/q/q0506.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 6</a>:20, regarding hand. This is all in the context of the exodus, so their is a commonality as far as context. <strong>Why does he not use metaphor in this area?</strong> The only other use of arm that I am aware of in the Pentateuch is <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/u/u0504.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 4</a>:34, where it is translated the same way, in the same context. For hand, see <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/k/q/q0209.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 9:3</a>, and <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/t/k/q/q0207.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">7:4</a>, where Onkelos interprets hand to mean plague or strike.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it is widely felt that the character of Targum Onkelos (and all of the targumim, as a matter of fact) is inconsistent on this issue to a degree that defies generalisation or explanation. In the words of somebody considerably more familiar with them than myself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The targumim on many occasions soften anthropomorphic expressions used\n  of God... Since the time of Saadya it has been argued that such\n  translations are motivated by doctrine and arise from a desire to\n  defend the transcendence and spirituality of God. The problem is that\n  the targumim are not consistent: they also translate literally many\n  anthropomorphic terms.

Alexander, \"Jewish Aramaic Translations of Hebrew Scriptures\", <em>Mikra: Text, Translation, Reading and Interpretation of the Hebrew Bible in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity</em> (ed. Martin Jan Mulder; Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1988), 217-253 (226).</p>\n\n<p>Alexander goes on to remark that he is doubtful of dogma playing a role, since in rabbinic literature contemporary with the targumim, \"strikingly anthropomorphic language\" is employed to speak of God. So it sounds to me (in my humble opinion) that this is two different questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What <em>is</em> the reason for the inconsistency in Onkelos, so far as descriptions of God are concerned? Is there a pattern that can be identified?</p></li>\n<li><p>What is the reason that Rashi and Rambam (etc) considered Onkelos to have been motivated by a doctrine concerning the incorporeality of God, and how did they explain those instances in which he deviated from that perceived doctrine?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That these are two separate issues, and that a simple explanation of Onkelos as having been motivated by doctrine is insufficient, is threshed out more fully by the Ramban (Genesis 46:1), who goes through a lot of the evidence and who critiques the Rambam's position in detail. He doesn't provide an answer, claiming instead that none of this is a secret, and that the wise will understand. He does, however, demonstrate that Onkelos' \"inconsistency\" is not limited to descriptions of the exodus.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The sefer אוהב גר <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20619&st=&pgnum=16&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> writes that it was not the main intention of Onkelos in his Targum to distance any notion that G-d is corporeal, because he left several posukim unchanged from the Hebrew even thought they mention the finger, or hand or eyes of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Because the truth of the matter is that the Targum was not made for the Torah sages \nbut rather for the uneducated populace. Therefore, Onkelos did not flee from every case of corporeality, only where the notion of corporeality might debase the honor of Hashem in the eyes of the people.</p>\n\n<p>But where the use of anthromorphism is a lofty usage which will be good in the eyes of the listener, and not damage him but rather it will benefit him by making the superiority of the Torah greater in his eye, in those cases he left the expression in the Targum as it was in the original.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The phrase is clearly idiomatic. Imagine what it would mean assuming the (ch\"v) God <em>did</em> have a body and an arm: it would mean that a giant hand came from the sky and pulled each Jewish person out of Egypt. That is completely ridiculous and even a corporealist wouldn't read it as such (it would have been an important part of the story, no?), so the phrase is just an idiom, having nothing to do with any physical arm or hand. Onkelos must have thought this to be obvious as well. </p>\n\n<p>In certain other places, the idiom makes sense to be explained differently by the Targum. Here though, 'plague' doesn't make as much sense in context: God took us out with miracles, wonders, and <em>plagues</em>? In this context the idiom is clearly meant to represent might.</p>\n\n\n",

(See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/36689/5151\">this answer</a>.) However, this was written around 2000 years ago, and the way money works has changed drastically since then.</p>\n\n<p>[Update: As @DoubleAA pointed out in a comment, the concept is actually from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0514.htm#25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 14:25</a>, where it says \"וְנָתַתָּה בַּכָּסֶף\". However, because the mishna (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaser Sheini 2:6</a>) talks about redeeming onto <em>copper</em>, albeit <em>b'dieved</em>, we see that the pasuk is <em>lav davka</em> silver, but referring to money. Silver coins are still preferred though.]</p>\n\n<p>Back then, a coin had intrinsic value. They were made of precious metals. They were also the only real form of currency (no dollar bills, checks, bitcoins; trade was also used, but it wasn't a currency).<br>\nNowadays, most coins do not have intrinsic value. What makes a quarter worth 25 cents? The US government says so. Really, it's just a small copper circle with a coating.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's say you have a wheat field in Israel. For the sake of argument, i'll say it grows wheat valued at 1000 shekels per year. (I have absolutely no idea how much a field grows.) Maaser sheini is around 9%**, or 90 shekels. Granted, with the current situation of the highest coin denomination being 10NIS, it's not that much trouble to bring 112.5NIS (90 + 22.5 -- the chomesh [fifth] added when redeeming maaser sheini) in coins (11 * 10NIS + 2NIS + .5NIS = 14 coins). But what if you have 10 of these fields? Are you expected to take along over 1000NIS in coins? It would be a lot more practical to redeem it onto paper money.</p>\n\n<p>So is the mishna's ruling (and all who copied it) obsolete in light of current situations?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Ma'aser Sheini -- the second tithe taken from fruit/grain/etc. that must be taken to Yerushalayim or redeemed on coins, which are then used to buy food in Yerushalayim.</p>\n\n<p>**around 9% --  approximately 2% for trumah gedolah (98% left); then 9.8% of the total for maaser rishon (88.2% left); then 8.82% for maaser sheini. You're left with ~79% of what you bring in.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>See Chazon Ish (D’mai 3:12) proves that modern coins may be used even though they have no intrinsic value, and offers a possible explanation as to why that logic does not apply to \npaper money which traditionally has not been used for these purposes. (footnote 16 on article \"THE HUNT FOR THE PERUTAH CHAMURAH\" by Rabbi Dovid Cohen <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/Sappirim/Sappirim%2025%20%28Jul%202012%29.pdf\">http://www.crcweb.org/Sappirim/Sappirim%2025%20(Jul%202012).pdf</a> which is a great resource) </p>\n\n<p>See also Yoreh Death 305 Gra 4 which is the source of the Chazon Ish that with coins we consider the commetcial value and don't consider the intrinsic metalic value of the coin. See also Pischei Teshuvah 7 who discusses legal tender bank notes and suggests to differentiate between using them for hekdesh redemption which is commerce and therefore acceptable vs pidyon haben which is a transaction from Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Also, since nowadays there is no Bais HaMikdash, Maaser Sheni is not eaten in Jerusalem, the Geonim ruled that one may redeem many perutos worth of Maaser Sheni on a single perutah (Rambam Demai 2:2)</p>\n\n\n",

However, should I commit these to memory and do them each time?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch 7:1 writes that, throughout the whole day, if one uses the bathroom (gedolim or ketanim) one recites asher yatzar every time, but al netilas yadaim is said only one time in the morning (upon waking up). There are more intricate halachos concerning if one has the runs what should one do about asher yatzer: see Mishna Brurah 7:1.</p>\n\n<p>There is an opinion which holds that if when uses the bathroom (gedolim) and afterwards plans on davening then he would have to make an al netilas yadayim, however the Mishna Brurah writes we don't veer from the Shulchan Aruch's ruling and we recite al netilas yedayim only once daily.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I found another source, right under my nose.

Before we ever get to the point of performing mitzvot there is a need to develop our basic character. The traits that comprise our character determine the way in which we fulfill the mitzvot. We must spend our energy in perfecting these aspects of ourselves - once these are properly developed we can perform the mitzvot with relative ease.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: Overcoming anger is a foundation for the proper fulfillment of the entire Torah, and is therefore not counted as a separate mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Iggeres Haramban, one of the main points the Ramban is trying to get over to his son is not to get angry.

But as a man, he has his own failings. HaShem is not looking for personal perfection, but for achievements to restore Torah to the World.\nThis man will have a moment of realisation like that of the 'burning bush', and from that moment he will more clearly realise his role, destiny and duty.\nNothing about him should be taken literally as RaMBaM does. RaMBaN's approach is more correct.\nPeople will not recognise him for who he is although he will likely try to approach them. Consider Moshe's return to Mitzrayim, and even the zakeinim abandoned him. It is proverbially 'lonely at the top'.\nHe will not perform 'miracles' but what he will do will seem miraculous because it will disrupt past ways of thinking.\nThe future king's sheer kedushah will bring change to the world and the long domination by Esav/Edom will slowly lose its grip on the World.\n'Jews' even Torah observant 'Jews' will shun him because he will be telling them things they do not want to hear, despite beating their chests and screaming \"mashiakh mashiakh\". Rabbis will not listen and will commit avodot zarah despite being told. Rabbis will lie and steal and kill but profess to be 'Torah Jews'.\nHe will fight the war of Gog v'MaGog alone just like David fought the plishti & Goliath.\nHe will gather the tribes, resurrect the 'dead', offer korban parah adumah, and lead in building the 10th Altar (and the three minor altars) before building the Yhezkel Bet Hamikdash and his own palace.\nKing of Yisrael will be a great warrior and will end wars to create enduring World Peace.\nTorah will be learned on a previously unimagined level an depth by billions, and prophecy will be as common as capacity to learn.</p>\n\n\n",

The major views are summarized below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Unitary / Monistic:</strong> Man is a singular entity that cannot be further subdivided into 'partite' components.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Bipartite / Dichotomy / Mind-Body Dualism:</strong> Man is a a composite of two distinct 'partites,' material and immaterial (e.g. body and soul/spirit—'soul' and 'spirit' are here taken as synonyms referring to the same entity).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Tripartite / Trichotomy:</strong> Man is a composite of three distinct 'partites': body, soul, and spirit ('soul' and 'spirit' here refer to distinct entities—some use 'mind'/'psyche' in lieu of 'soul').</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Does Judaism have a perspective on these categories from philosophical anthropology?

The soul is intrinsically pure and averse to lowliness and physicality.  It only remains in the body due to a divine decree.</p>\n\n<p>There is the body, which is a purely physical entity.  It is intrinsically attracted to lowliness, and by it's nature pulls towards physicality.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there is a third entity, which is not autonomous from the first two, but is a new awareness which comes about from the fusion/union of the first two.  This is \"Adam\" - man.  Awareness, sense of autonomy and self, come from this union.  It comes about through an impossible combination of two entities which are by nature diametrically opposed to one another.</p>\n\n<p>For a concise but clear English synopsis of this idea, you could see Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg's Fundamentals and Faith pg. 126-127 who explains this view as the opinion of the Rambam in including Resurrection of the Dead into the 13 Principles of Faith.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>see the beginning of Genesis which states man was first formed then G-d \"breathed\" into the nostrils the soul of life.</p>\n\n<p>for more details see the books Nefesh Hachaim and Shaarei Kedusha.</p>\n\n<p>basically, the first man was a perfect one-to-one analogy and switchboard of the entire creation including all the mystical worlds.</p>\n\n\n",

We find  this concept by Korbonos. The Korbon Tomid\n  (daily  sacrifice) preceded the other Korbonos of the day  because it\n  was most frequent. A pracatical application  of this Halacha is that\n  one who upon finishing eating  becomes obligated to recite the beracha\n  “Asher  Yatzar”. At the same time he is also obligated to recite  the\n  Beracha Acharona on what he ate. Which Beracha  should he recite\n  first? The Maharshal1 , applying the  principle that the more frequent\n  mitzvah comes first,  rules that the Beracha of “Asher Yatzar”\n  precedes the  Beracha Acharona.    </p>\n  \n  <p>R’ Akiva Eiger2  questions what the\n  ruling would be if one  had to recite Birchas Hamazon and Asher\n  Yatzar. In this  instance perhaps Birchas Hamazon, which is a Mitzvah \n  D’oraysa, is considered a Mitzvah of greater sanctity and  therefore\n  can come before “Asher Yatzar”. Whether or  not a Mitzvah d’oraysa\n  precedes a Mitzvah D’rabanan is  subject to a dispute amongst the\n  Gedolei Acharonim.  The Noda B’Yehuda3  is of the opinion that a\n  Mitzvah  D’oraysa is considered a Mitzvah of greater sanctity than  a\n  Mitzvah D’rabanan and therefore will precede a  Mitzvah D’rabanan. The\n  Shaagas Aryeh4  disagrees with  this and holds that a Mitzvah D’oraysa\n  doesn’t  necessarily precede a Mitzvah D’rabanan.5  In this \n  situation, the Chavos Yair6  Paskins that “Asher Yatzar”  precedes\n  even Birchas Hamazon.    </p>\n  \n  <p>With regard to Birchas Hamazon and Sefiras\n  Haomer  according to the Noda B’Yehuda Birchas Hamazon  certainly\n  takes precedence since it is a Mitzvah D’oraysa  while Sefiras Haomer\n  is only a Mitzvah Mid’rabanan  (according to the majority of\n  opinions). According to the  Shaagas Aryeh one could actually chose\n  whichever he  would like to do first. Even though Birchas Hamazon is \n  recited more frequently than Sefiras Haomer, since one  is not\n  obligated to eat bread during the week it is not  considered by\n  Halacha to be a more frequent Mitzvah.7   However on Shabbos and Yom\n  Tov when one is required  to eat bread and therefore required to\n  bentch, the  Mitzvah of Birchas hamazon is considered to be a more \n  frequent Mitzvah than Sefiras Haomer and will therefore  precede it.8</p>\n  \n  <p>Consequently, returning to our original question, on  Friday night the correct order to perform the Mitzvos  would be:9<br>\n  1 - Krias\n  Shema(which is most frequent)<br>\n  2 - Birchas Hamazon<br>\n  3 - Sefiras Haomer\n  Despite what we have clarified, it seems that many  people are\n  accustomed to recite Krias Shema after  Birchas Hamazon, even though\n  Krias Shema is the more  frequent Mitzvah. The reason why many permit\n  this is  that one is not obligated to interrupt his meal to  perform\n  other Mitzvos. Birchas Hamazon is considered  by some to be a\n  component of the meal, and therefore  one is not obligated to recite\n  Krias Shema until  completion of the entire meal including Birchas \n  Hamazon.10 Still, Sefiras Haomer according to all  opinions is recited\n  last.11    </p>\n  \n  <p>Note: According to most Poskim, these rules only apply \n  when one is prepared to do all the Mitzvos  consecutively. But if one\n  is not yet ready to bentch he  may recite Sefiras Haomer during the\n  meal. Or if one is  not yet ready to recite Krias Shema until a later\n  point in  the evening he may bentch and recite Sefiras Haomer  first</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p>1  Quoted in M.B.

They are experts in fish production AND all the relevant Halachic sources AND clearly have excellent systems in place to ensure ONLY kosher fish is being processed and then packed with their seal. </p>\n\n<p>[Disclaimer: I am aware that this post is predicated on MY ASSUMPTION/ UNDERSTANDING of Dr. YSG's choice of words when posting his query. I may be guilty of misunderstanding his words. Hence, this may be entirely irrelevant. If so, I apologize.] </p>\n\n<p>---->>>> PERHAPS the reason why Dr. YSG couldn't find scales may very well be because the fish, after having been checked for <em>kaskeses</em> (scales) by a knowledgable, torah observant expert; drumroll please... was SCALED! <em>\"We picked up some halibut for Pesach directly from the packer.\"</em> Dr. YSG never said the fish, coming from the packer, came in before it was gutted, cleaned and turned into a nice piece of fillet (with the skin on.) \n(Did they buy it whole with the head, tail and and the pieces attached to the fins still intact? I doubt it. The spine was probably discarded, bones picked out etc.) </p>\n\n<p>One can assume that the mashgiach made sure to check the large cases of boxes storing the dozens of fish before he gave his approval to allow these fish to be cleaned, packed and sealed. (I've done work at a fish wholesale place and am aware of the way -- in certain places -- the fish is processed, and the general setup /layout of a medium scale fish production place.)</p>\n\n<p>In other words: just because <em>the skin is on</em>, doesn't mean the scales are STILL attached. Many pieces of salmon are sold with their skin on (for looks or taste; to keep the flavor locked in when seared/ grilled etc.) but the skins are smooth and clean = appetizing. They don't have the silver and black shiny (reflective) look that the scales give the fish when completely intact.\n(Compare this to poultry: you often buy chicken with its skin on, but, thank Heavens, it has been plucked of its feathers (hopefully) and washed/ scrubbed down.)</p>\n\n<p>So buying fish \"directly fom the packer,\" as Dr. YSG originally posted,  doesn't translate to having unprocessed, scales-attached-to-the-skin fish pieces/ fillets. Fish can be \"minimally processed\" or \"heavily processed\" from a packer/ distributor/ fisherman, and then left (the cleaned, large slabs/ fillets) to be further processed and/or divided according to the retailors' individual prefrences..</p>\n\n<p>[To reiterate: All fillet fish can be sold from the distributor, \"packer,\" wholesaler, fish producer AFTER they've been cleaned. Prepping/ cleaning MAY include: gutting; SCALING; cleaning/scrubbing; and de-boning the fish for later cutting down to size. That big cleaned up slab/piece (which can weigh a quite sizable many pounds) is then sent to a local (retailer) fish shop where the proprietor may further divide it into a specific thickness and width of individual pieces.]</p>\n\n<p>Finally, one last point. <em>\"Since the Mashgiach is Yotzei v'Nichnas and not Timidi, we would like to verify the skin itself has scales.\"</em> -- From what I know about mass fish production, including the layout of the individual warehouse (design can make a huge difference in keeping up reliable tracking of the unprocessed and processed fish), the system of how the fish is processed, the line used for each step of the processing (cleaning) and the system in place between the mashgiach and the fish production owners, I can tell you that if the Mashgiach has checked all the dozens of cases of fish (each day) before it goes to the area of the factory which deals with further processing (including: cutting them open and gutting, cleaning, filleting, de-boning, and cutting to size), then the system in place and the design of the wharehouse (including storage/ holding areas etc.) may well be more than adequate and very reliable. Again, this is why we rely on large, reputable hashgocho agencies who employ yirei shomayim AND have immense PRACTICAL knowledge of the particular industries/ fields they are involved in. </p>\n\n<p>-- The reason I wrote this response (nearly 4 yrs after the original post) is to prevent others from erroneously concluding, as some of the responders may have, that not finding scales on a piece of fish that has its skin attached = fish had no scales to begin with, so is <em>treif</em>.  This exchange comes up in google queries to specifically worded kosher fish questions. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>from <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/fishfaq/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kashrut.com</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are two ways to identify a kosher fish:</p>\n  \n  <p>1 - By removing a kosher scale from the skin. 2 - By recognizing the fish as\n  being from a kosher species.

The blessing may only be recited on trees of a type that grows edible fruit</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Hagiz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Ya'akov Chagiz</a> (<em>Halachot K'tanot</em> 2:28) writes that he demonstrated in <em>Lechem HaPanim</em> (his commentary on the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>)<sup>2</sup> that <em>Birkas HaIlanos</em> should only be recited on the blossoms<sup>3</sup> of a tree whose type grows edible fruit:<sup>4</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בפי' הש\"ע הוכחתי... ושם מוכח דאין לברך אלא על אילני מאכל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/37621/blessing-on-tree-nissan/37624#comment98919_37621\">DoubleAA mentioned</a>, the Mishna (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Ma'aseros</em> 1:4</a>) indicates that a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond#Sweet_and_bitter_almonds\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bitter variety of almonds</a>, while generally inedible (consumption can lead to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide_poisoning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cyanide poisoning</a>), is edible at some point before ripening. (<strong>Note:</strong> Although amygdalin and hydrogen cyanide levels <a href=\"http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/158/4/1916.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">have been shown to vary</a> as bitter almonds ripen, modern varieties of bitter almonds may indeed be dangerous to consume whether ripe or unripe. Consult a doctor or botanist). </p>\n\n<p>That said, I don't know whether the particular variety of almond you mention is the same as that discussed in the Mishna, but it sounds like it is not commonly consumed nowadays (particularly as food). <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CYLOR\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CYLOR</a> regarding whether the tree you mention is appropriate for <em>Birkas haIlanos</em>.<sup>5</sup></p>\n\n<h3>2. Reciting the blessing over an <em>orlah</em> tree</h3>\n\n<p>R' Dov Berish Weidenfeld (<em>Doveiv Meisharim</em> 3:5) rules that the blessing may be recited over an <em>orlah</em> tree since the <em>b'racha</em> is not related to the future enjoyment of those specific fruits but rather to the fact that fruit bearing trees are experiencing their annual renewal in Creation (and this phenomenon ultimately allows people to enjoy eating fruit in general). R' Weidenfeld supplements his position with a number of arguments. The <em>Tzitz Eliezer</em> (15:15:1) agrees with R' Weidenfeld and, defending his arguments, rules accordingly. The <em>Ben Ish Chai</em> likewise permits reciting the blessing over an <em>orlah</em> tree (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1402&pgnum=16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Rav P'alim</em> III, OC §9</a>).</p>\n\n<p>However, see R' Akiva Eiger (OC 226) who is unsure whether a person may recite the blessing on a blossoming <em>orlah</em> tree (and who implicitly rules out of doubt that one may not recite the blessing). He writes that, if a person is unsure whether a tree in the Diaspora is <em>orlah</em>, he may recite the blessing, since <em>safeik orlah</em> in the Diaspora is permitted. Likewise, R' Malkiel Tzvi Tenenbaum (<em>Divrei Malkiel</em> 3:2) rules stringently against reciting the blessing (despite advancing a possible argument permitting it). R' Nissan Kaplan (<em>Shalmei Nissan</em> on chapter <em>Keitzad M'varchin</em> §79) suggests an argument permitting recitation, but ultimately is inconclusive due to the opinion of his father-in-law Rabbi Avraham Gurwitz that the critical factor is whether the fruits will be permitted to the observer.</p>\n\n<p>Due to dispute over the matter, R' Ovadia Yosef (<em>Yabia Omer</em> vol. 5, OC §5), following the principle of <em>safeik b'rachos l'hakeil</em> (see for e.g. <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> OC 209:3), rules that the blessing should not be recited over <em>orlah</em> trees.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CYLOR\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CYLOR</a> regarding whether you should or may recite this blessing over trees that are still in the <em>orlah</em> stage.<sup>6</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>\nUnfortunately, this update comes just after the end of Nissan. However, we generally follow those poskim who allow the blessing to be recited at any point during the year (<em>Machatzis HaShekel</em> OC 226). Interestingly, R' Ya'akov Chagiz, one of the poskim who rules that the blessing may only be recited in Nissan, uses almonds as an example of a fruit tree that blossoms early and that therefore usually may not be used for the blessing (<em>Halachot K'tanot</em> 2:28, see also Rashi to <em>Koheles</em> 12:5: אילן של שקדים כלומר שתקפוץ הזקנה עליו כשקד זה הממהר להנץ לפני כל האילנות). Out of doubt, the <em>Kaf HaChayim</em> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9087&st=&pgnum=341\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 226:1</a>) recommends that someone reciting the blessing not during <em>Nissan</em> should omit <em>Shem u'Malchus</em>.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>Although R' Chagiz traveled to Constantinople intending to publish his manuscript of <em>Lechem HaPanim</em>, he passed away there, and the commentary is thought to be lost to posterity. </sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> <sub>R' Chagiz writes that the blessing may be recited even after the petals fall off in the <a href=\"http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/5/1523.full#sec-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fruit set</a> stage. There is a dispute among the <em>poskim</em> regarding whether the blessing may even be recited during the fruit enlargement stage (see <em>Bi'ur HaGra</em> OC 226:1 s.v. <em>v'im</em>, <em>Mishna B'rura</em> OC 226:4 for a survey of opinions; see also <em>Bach</em> OC 226:2 who suggests that the blessing may be recited if the person had not seen the blossom earlier). The <em>Mishna B'rura</em> indicates that it should not be recited once the fruit is mature.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> <sub>The prevailing position is that the blessing may only be recited on trees of an edible-fruit bearing species (or, according to some opinions, on trees that actually bear edible fruit, see the contemporary book <a href=\"http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?26715\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Ma'aseh Chemed</em></a> by Rabbi Eliyahu Cohen). However, there are opinions that disagree. R' Ya'akov Emden writes that the blessing may be recited on non-fruit-bearing species (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7920&st=&pgnum=193\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mor uK'tzi'ah</em> 225</a>), R' Avraham miBuczacz (<em>Eshel Avraham</em> OC 226) is in doubt as to whether the blessing may be recited over them. Partially in consideration of R' Ya'akov Emden's opinion, the <em>Shevet HaLevi</em> (6:53:4) suggests that someone should not repeat the blessing if they already recited it on a species of tree that does not bear edible fruit. </sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> <sub>Incidentally, R' Chagiz infers from the Rambam (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=2&hilchos=10&perek=10&halocha=13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hil. B'rachos</em> 10:13</a>) that the blessing should only be recited when multiple fruit-bearing trees are observed in bloom. It is unclear why R' Chagiz thought that the language of the Rambam implies this any more than does the language of the gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=43b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'rachos</em> 43b</a>). In any case, the Chida (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19596&st=&pgnum=40\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Moreh b'Etzba</em> ch. 7, §198</a>) indicates that <em>m'dakd'kim</em> are particular to follow this practice. </sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> <sub>For some contemporary internet rulings on the matter, see the opinions of: <a href=\"http://www.halachayomit.co.il/EnglishDefault.asp?HalachaID=1926\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ya'akov Sasson</a> (permitting), <a href=\"http://shut.moreshet.co.il/shut2.asp?id=22686\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi David Lau</a> (permitting), <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/1672\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliezer Melamed</a> (permitting if there is no other alternative, but see <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/10-15-08/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, where he seems to rule more stringently but mentions that the blessing may be recited unless the observer knows that the tree is <em>orlah</em>), and <a href=\"http://olamot.net/shiur/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ya'akov Yehudah Zilberlicht</a> (brings both sides, but perhaps seems inclined to permit).</sub></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Any Rules for Qamets Chatuph When Khaf Follows Chet?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my slow but constant pursuit of Hebrew knowledge, I have not yet resolved the rules for the Qamets Chatuph (the Qamets that produces an \"o\" sound as opposed to an \"a\" sound). Fortunately, some resources (like the Koren Siddur) make this obvious by enlargening the Qamets. To that end, I have noted that there are a good many occurrences of this sound when Khaf (כ) follows Chet (ח), such as in the word <em>chokh'mah</em> (חכמה), when pronounced with the \"o\" sound instead of the \"a\" sound.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, I want to be able to delineate these different forms so that I can read the Tanakh with certainty regarding my pronunciation.</p>\n\n<p>What is a good rule of thumb for this combination?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The rule is that in a closed syllable (that ends with a consonant) that is unaccented, the <em>qamets</em> will be <em>qamets chatuph</em>.  For example, in the noun חָכְמָה, the two syllables are חָכְ and מָה.  The second is accented, and so the first <em>qamets</em> is <em>chatuph</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The example in Zechariah 9:2 that @DoubleAA brings up above is not the noun, but a conjugation of the verb.  In this case, the syllable structure is first חָ, second כְ (with a <em>sheva na</em>), and third מָה.  Thus, the above rule does not apply.  In addition, to obviate confusion, there is a <em>meteg</em> (a small line) next to the <em>qamets</em> on the ח.  This is a secondary stress mark, and says that the <em>qamets</em> is pronounced fully, and is not <em>chatuf</em>.  There are exceptions to the effect of the <em>meteg</em>, and they're usually on words with a <em>makef</em> (eg. Deut 15:10 בכָל־מעשך).</p>\n\n<p>Every rule has a few exceptions, but the most common exception is the word בָּתִּים, where the accent is on the second syllable, and the <em>dagesh</em> in the ת indicates that the syllable structure is בָּת and תִים.  To avoid this seeming contradiction, some <em>tikkuns</em> will print the <em>dagesh</em> as <em>qal</em> (weak) instead of the <em>chazak</em> that it should be. The other exceptions to the rule are with <em>makefs</em>, like Num 34:3 (יָם־המלח).</p>\n\n<p>Support: second paragraph of <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=D1IpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gesenius' grammar</a> says that a <em>sheva</em> after an unaccented long vowel is <em>na</em>, hence in a closed syllable, the vowel can't be long.</p>\n\n\n",

In one place, the Talmud  states that\n  a person can swallow food up to the size of two olives:  The Sages\n  evaluated that the throat cannot hold more than two olives. (Talmud, \n  Krisus 14a)  Elsewhere, the Talmud states that a person can swallow\n  food up to the size of an  egg:  The Sages evaluated that the throat\n  cannot hold more than a chicken’s egg.  (Talmud, Yoma 80a)  These\n  passages indicate that an olive is half the size of an egg. However,\n  in a  third place, a different conclusion emerges. The Talmud (Eruvin\n  82b) discusses the  amount of food required for an eruv. Two of the\n  views cited express their opinion  in terms of kabin, which in turn\n  can be expressed in quantities of eggs (since 1 kav  is 24 eggs):  \n  Rabbi Shimon: Two meals are 2/9 of a kav, which is 5 1/3 eggs.  \n  Rabbi Yochanan ben Beruka: Two meals are ¼ of a kav, which is 6 eggs. \n  Elsewhere, the Talmud states that two meals are equal to 18 dried\n  figs.  Now, as we saw earlier, an olive is known to be smaller than a\n  dried fig. This results   in the following calculation:   Rabbi\n  Shimon: Two meals = 5 1/3 eggs = 18 dried figs; thus 1 olive is less\n  than  3/10 of an egg   Rabbi Yochanan ben Beruka: Two meals = 6 eggs\n  = 18 dried figs; thus 1 olive  is less than 1/3 of an egg  How are all these sources to be reconciled?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are several basic views as to the size of a kzayis:</p>\n\n<p>1) The most commonly accepted view in the modern works on hilchos brachos (V'zos Habracha, The Halachos of Kzayis by Rabbi Bodner, and others) is that of the Mishna Berura and many other Acharonim. They hold that a Kzayis is either 1/2 (or 1/3) of the volume of the average egg. That is about 1 fluid ounce. The assumption is that the size of an egg is more consistent over the centuries than the size of olives. (The Mishna Berura also recommends one avoid the grey area between 1/2 and 1/3 egg.) </p>\n\n<p>2) Another view, held by Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, Shlita, is that a kzayis is literally the volume of an olive. This view is generally not followed, partially due to the rule of \"safek brachos l'hakel\" - one should not say a Bracha unless it is clearly neccesary.</p>\n\n<p>3) The Noda B'Yehuda's view is that a kzayis is about 2 fluid ounces, using a finger-based measurement from the Talmud. This view is generally only followed when there is a Torah-based obligation to eat, like the kzayis we eat on Seder night.</p>\n\n\n",

Specifically, most of the verbs are in Hebrew, except for זבין (bought) and אתא (came), and most of the nouns are in Aramaic, except for HaKadosh Baruch Hu, Malach HaMaves (angel of death), and HaShochet (slaughterer).

It is thought by some to have been modelled on a German folk song, and thus composed at such a time as Aramaic was no longer being spoken. This may account for what some have seen as grammatical errors within the text (<a href=\"http://www.safa-ivrit.org/poems/hadgad.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">online source</a>).</p>\n\n<p>An example of a \"grammatical error\" (taken from that website, which is in Hebrew) is שונרא... דאכלה (\"the cat... which ate\"). Aside from possible problems with vocalisation, which may be found in other passages in Chad Gadya also, שונרא (cat) is a masculine noun, but אכלה (ate) is a feminine verb. Really, the text <em>should</em> say either שונרתא (which is the feminine word for \"cat\") or דאכל (which is the masculine verb, \"ate\").</p>\n\n<p>In any case, an admixture of Hebrew and Aramaic in mediaeval Jewish literature (a time when people are neither speaking Aramaic nor Hebrew outside of liturgical settings) is par for the course, and is the result of both languages being read with roughly equal frequency.

When the prices for good increase or decrease as a result of demand that is not inflation.  Inflation has to do with the system of fractal banking where the currency itself is devalued as a result of increased money supply.  Also, the currency, being that it is paper or digital, has no inherent value.  Currency that was printed on either gold, silver, copper, bronze had inherent value because of the metal used.  Today, the prices are not necessarily going up, rather the money's buying power is decreasing as a result of increased money supply - this is inflation.  This system of fractal banking is a new concept invented that started being used in the 1800's and then became institutionalized in 1910 with the creation of the FRB.

    "title": "How do different scholars define \"aggadah\"?",
    "content": "# How do different scholars define \"aggadah\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is common to conceive of Shas (Bavli and Yerushalmi) as being an admixture of halakha and aggadah, and I've no doubt that people have differed from one another on the precise delineations of each. Oftentimes, a story might get brought in the presentation of a law, or a law might be found to have influenced a detail of a story, and while there must surely be instances of aggadot entirely devoid of halakha (just as most halakhic literature is devoid of aggadah), the lines between the two genres are sometimes blurred.</p>\n\n<p>What I would like to know is the extent to which people have disagreed with one another on this issue. Did the compiler of Eyn Yaakov, for example, ever differ in his understanding of what is and what is not aggadah from various of his contemporaries and predecessors? Did anybody ever codify halakha from a passage thought by others to be aggadic? Were there any famous machlokot that centred on whether a passage was meant to be read halakhically? And, of course, a thousand other questions of this nature, all of which boil down to the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Has anybody ever conducted an overview of different scholars and their respective approaches to the definition of aggadah?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I'm not sure if \"anyone has ever conducted a study\" of what some scholars consider to be aggada and others do not. However, we should be wary of such black and white distinctions, and of assuming that just because a passage is quoted in the Ein Yaakov, R. Yaakov Chaviva thought it should fit squarely into the \"aggada\" box. There are passages that the Maharsha comments upon in both his chiddushei aggados as well as his chiddushei halakhos, because it is possible for a halakhic discussion to have aggadic/philosophical implications, and vice versa. Therefore, one cannot merely say that just because a passage was included in a list of aggados such as that of the Eyn Yaakov of Maharsha does it become non-halakhic. </p>\n\n<p>The distinction between halakha and aggadah was one that existed at least from the time of the Mishnah and Gemara. There are many sources to this affect, such as Sanhedrin 67b, Sotah 40a, Bava Kama 60b and others. This distinction seems to have major importance considering that there's a principle thrown around by poskim here and there (see Tos. Yom Tov to Brachos 5:4 and Maharal below) that we shouldn't make legal implication from aggadah. To list all of the places where these lines are blurred, and how others have viewed them, would take a book's length discussion (though I'm unaware of any such book as of yet). </p>\n\n<p>What I can do here is answer the title of the question, 'how do different scholars define aggada'. As far as I'm aware, everyone differentiates in pretty much the same way: halakha is anything that pertains directly to 'what to do', and aggada is everything else. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>R. Shmuel ben Chofni Gaon, in his intro to Talmud (that was attributed to R. Shmuel Hanagid) states that \"aggada is any explanation mentioned in the Talmud that does not explain a commandment\". He goes on to give another difference between them, that halakhos were received by tradition, and aggados are the personal opinions of the chachamim. (This second difference seems to be incidental rather than definitional)</p></li>\n<li><p>A very similar concept can be found in the Ramban's 'disputation', where he explains that the Jews have three types of books, the bible, the Talmud <em>which is an explanation of the commandments in the Bible</em>, and we have 'sermons', which were speeches that the Rabbis gave in public. It seems pretty clear that the Ramban is distinguishing between halakha and aggada, saying that halakha is anything that explains the commandments, and aggadah is everything else.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Maharal in Beer Hagoleh 6 also writes that there's no issue of having contradicting aggados because the whole principle of aggada is something that does not affect actionable commands. אבל באגדה שאין דין יוצא מזה אין להקשות ולסתור... ובשביל כך אמרו, אין למדין הלכה מתוך האגדה, כי לא נתברר על ידי קושיות ותשובות</p></li>\n<li><p>Gr\"a to Mishlei 25:21 compares halakha to fire and agada to water, inter alia saying that halakha pertains directly to actions (which are exacting, as fire has an immediate affect on what it combusts) and agada to mussar (which dissolves things slowly over time)</p></li>\n<li><p>R. Hirsch in his intro to Horeb reverses what was said by R. Shmuel (above), saying that halakha is called 'shmaatsa', because the emphasis is that it was <em>heard</em>, student from teacher in a chain extending back to Sinai, as opposed to 'aggada' which was just 'הוגד', <em>said</em>, without its author having heard it from his teacher. <em>Therefore</em>, says R. Hirsch, halakhos are legally binding as actions and aggados are merely ideas. </p></li>\n<li><p>R. Dessler (Michtav Meeliyahu vol 4 pg 353) makes the usual distinction, but has a very interesting conclusion: since the purpose of halakha is to tell us what to do, it's ok if we don't understand why we do it, as long as we do it, because it's function is 'to do'. Aggada, however, exists to be understood, and we therefore have an obligation to dwell on its meaning until we understand it, because it isn't something to be acted upon. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The questions of ambiguity appear when 1) aggadic concepts are used to drive halakhic conclusions, 2) when a passage in the gemara sounds clearly like a story, but nonetheless includes someone doing something that has halakhic implications, or 3) halakhos are recorded in the Gemara in a manner akin to aggados.  </p>\n\n<p>Tosfos in many places seem to take aggados seriously in terms of how to pasken halakha. Two instances that come to mind are Bava Basra 74a, where Tosfos conclude from a rather strange story that the dead should be buried while wearing their tzitzis. Another place is from Sanhedrin 74b which discusses the halakhic question of why Ester didn't allow herself to be killed, and Tosfos ask a question on the Gemara based on an aggada in Megilah. The Rashba, though, in Megilah 15a disagrees with Tosfos, and writes simply דברי אגדה הן ואין משיבין עליה. It sounds like the issue at hand is whether or not the difference between halakha and aggada can really be attributed to actionable statements vs. non-actionable statements. </p>\n\n<p>For a different discussion (an exploration of what's presented as three differing opinions), see this shiur from vbm-torah.org:  <a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/taggada/02taggada.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vbm-torah.org/archive/taggada/02taggada.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Litvaks/Yeshivish and Shulchan Aruch\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that non-Chasidic (Ashkenaz) haredim follow the Mishnah Berurah when it comes to Orach Chayim part of Shulchan Aruch. But Mishnah Berurah is only for Orach Chayim. What they do with other parts of S\"A (Yoreh De'ah, Even Ha-Ezer, Chosen Mishpat) do they just follow Rema or later commentaries printed in standard S\"A? </p>\n\n<p>I mean, Chabad Chasidim have S\"A Baal HaTanya which contains Yoreh De'ah and Chosen Mishpat.</p>\n\n<p>I can recapitulate my question: do Litvaks/Yeshivish learn Mishnah Berurah and then Shulchan Aruch with commentaries for other parts of halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>First of all, there's no rule that all of the litvishe Ashkenazim have to follow the Mishna Berura. It was very well accepted, but deciding on each halacha is a very complicated matter, and on every page of the Dirshu or Oz VeHadar versions of the Mishna Berurah you can find places where later poskim have disagreed and where certain rulings of the Mishna Berurah have not been widely accepted. In fact, in the introrduction to the Oz VeHadar Aruch Hashulchan, it states that Rav Moshe Feinstein would often pasken like the Aruch Hashulchan over the Mihnah Berurah (though finding all of those places isn't so easy since he doesn't always quote them) and there's a teshuvah by Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin's grandson which says that he also thought the Aruch Hashulchan wins over the Mishna Berurah, (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20022&st=&pgnum=30\">Shut Bnei Banim 2:8</a>). But again, halacha is complicated and great poskim decide these things on a case by case basis. </p>\n\n<p>Having said all that, I think it should be clear the first source for an authoritative, litvish, late European commentary on Shulchan Aruch, the Aruch Hashulchan would be the answer, but the Chayei Adam and Kitzur Shulchan Aruch are used often as well, and are much easier to read. Of course, there are many issues, teshuvos, and poskim who have come afterwords, so seforim that are now popular include the Badei Hashulchan (and more recently Divrei Sofrim) on Y.D. and the Pischei Choshen (which isn't a commentary on Shulchan Aruch but still very thorough and widely accpeted as far as I've seen) on C.M. and dayanim studying Even Haezer often use the Otzar HaPoskim.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I should point out that the Lubavitcher Rebbe's Shulchan Aruch on Y.D. and C.M. especially are far from comprehensive</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Actually the <em>non-Chasidic (Ashkenaz) haredim</em> follow the <strong>Shulchan Aruch with the Rema</strong>'s additions, as do other Ashkenazim.</p>\n\n<p>When more clarification is needed, they (and all frum Jews) will consult the <strong>Nosei Keilim</strong> (commentaries) printed on the page and the back of the volume. </p>\n\n<p>A deeper understanding of how the Halacha came to be, would require opening the Tur (of which the Shulchan Aruch is essentially a summary) and the Rambam, after learning the relevant Gemara with Rif, Ran and Rosh.</p>\n\n<p>If that fails - or they want a shortcut - they may consult popular classic works that use the Shulchan Aruch as a basis. Popular ones are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Mishnah Berura</strong> on Orach Chaim</li>\n<li>The <strong>Aruch Hashulchan</strong> on all 4 parts of Shulchan Aruch (with some omissions, some apparently got lost as it was originally published as small booklets.)</li>\n<li>The <strong>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</strong> (from the Ba'al HaTanya)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Alternately - or if the above doesn't solve their specific problem - they will consult compendiums like the <strong>Chayei Adam</strong> or <strong>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</strong>, or more recent works as described in an <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37657/501\">earlier answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays you can find Sefarim that deal exclusively with almost any topic, and they usually highlight Ashkenazi/Hassidich/Sefardi differences, when they exist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On Yoreh Daioh the most popular sefer today is Badai Hashulchan  by Rabbi Feival Cohen, although there are many, many more also written in the same style as the mishne berura.</p>\n\n<p>Some others include (although not on all of it) Chelkas Binyamin  Gufai Halochos. Maadanai hashulchan and Zer hashulchan.</p>\n\n<p>On Even Hoezer there is Otsar Haposkim which is used by all rabbonim which although started many years ago by the Israeli Chief rabbi is far from finished and contains many volumes.\nThere is nothing I am aware of in mishne beruru style.\nChoshen mishpat has only very little has  done on it in mishne berura style. The sefer mishnas hamishpot by R Y Shwartz on chapters 75-87 and 259-271 is the only one I am aware of.</p>\n\n<p>On Orach Chaim no one has yet copied the mishne berura but instead Oz V'hodor have brought out a mishne berura which includes all other and later opinions.</p>\n\n\n",

But this transference into the property of a Jew was the one and only salvation for anybody who, according to the prevailing laws of the nations, was stamped as a slave. The terribly sad experiences of even the last century (Union, Jamaica 1865) teach us how completely unprotected and liable to the most inhuman treatment was the slave who in accordance with the national law was not emancipated, and even when emancipated, wherever he was, looked upon as still belonging to the slave class, or as a freed slave.\"</p>\n\n\n",

I understand why one can drink mevushal wine in this sense, but why is it good enough for kiddush? Are the requirements for kiddush less stringent then that of idol worship? Furthermore, the mevushal wine we drink today isn't exactly poor-quality. I've heard that even Catholic churches buy Rashi wine for their communions. Isn't there a problem with mevushal wine, at least now? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Rosh ,based on the two sevaras given in Avoda Zara for the issur, explains that the issur of yayin nesech is not <em>solely</em> an issue of avoda zara but additionally an issue of mingling with non-Jews (משום בנותיהן). If this is so, he asks, why would mevushal wine be any less likely to cause mingling between jews and non-jews?</p>\n\n<p>He also asks even if one just focuses on the nesech issue (that mevushal wine is not good for avoda zara) one does not come out any better because mixed wine (יין מזוג) is also not good for avoda zara, yet there is still an issur if a goy touches it. </p>\n\n<p>His answer (to both questions) is that mevushal wine is not common and the Rabbis did not make a gezera on uncommon things. </p>\n\n<p>While this may not be the sevara given by the Shulchan Aruch it would answer your question... </p>\n\n<p>Also look here for a full discussion of the heter behind yayin mevushal(Gemara, rishonim etc) and their applicability today:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/10-halak/29nesech.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/10-halak/29nesech.php</a></p>\n\n\n",

This way, no one has the chutzpa to claim having permission, and we can rely on them.<br>\nFrom this we derive the ktav kabbala -- literally script of acceptance (of permission), or \"license to kill\". After granting permission, the rabbi will write a license, basically vouching for the reliability of the shochet. See Simla Chadasha <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:5</a>.<br>\nNow that ktav kabbala exists, one may not rely on rov metzuyin anymore, unless the shochet knows all the halachos EXCEPT for that of ktav kabbla (so that he is not rebelling against this rule) [sorry guys! ;)]<br><br></p>\n\n<p>To get this license, one must know all of Hilchos Shechita (in America, as defined by the Simlah Chadasha [see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/37554/halacha-of-shechita/37555#37555\">this answer</a>]), be tested on it by a rabbi (and know all of the common halachos, and some of the uncommon ones), and then kill three animals in front of the rabbi (in a row), to create a chazaka that he can actually shecht.

    "content": "# Why can the 1st day of Pesach never occur on Sunday in 2 consecutive years?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am doing a lecture on the math of the Jewish calendar. I understand the concepts of the 3 types of year lengths - maleh, chaser and kesidrah - \"full\", \"regular\" and \"deficient\" years. I also understand the 4 postponement rules for Rosh Hashannah. (I say this, to avoid answers or comments that attempt to just state the rules.) My question is specifically why if Pesach falls on Tues., Thurs., or Shabbat, these days can be repeated the following year (when the following year is a leap year - maleh), but Sunday is never repeated (i.e it is never followed by a leap year - maleh)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When Pesach falls on Sunday, the following Rosh Hashana will be Tuesday (163 days = 23 weeks + 2 days). When Rosh Hashanah falls on Tuesday that year will <em>always</em> be kisidran (Rambam Hilchos Kiddush Hachodesh 8:10)</p>\n\n<p>We now explain mathematically why that is true in your case when the next year is a leap year. When Rosh Hashanah falls on Tuesday, the molad must have fallen Monday afternoon through Tuesday afternoon (molad zaken rule). When adding 5:21:589 (the delta between RH molads for a leap year) the range of molads for the next year is Sunday 15 hours, 589 cheleks - Monday 15 h, 589 c. Thus the next RH will be on Monday and the current years has a shift of 6 days. </p>\n\n<p>Since a leap year has either 383, 384 or 385 days dependent on whether it is deficient, regular or full causing the following year to shift by 5,6 or 0 days, respectively, the year must be a 384 day year = regular (kesidran)</p>\n\n<p>See Peirush on Rambam ibid for a complete analysis of all legal combinations of days and year types. </p>\n\n\n",

In Tanach, we find a number of instances when prominent Jews bowed to kings, such as the prophet Natan bowing to David (Melachim 1:1:23) and Yosef's brothers bowing to Yosef (Bereishit 42:6). Yaakov even bowed to Eisav seven times.

However, it is not clear if one may bow if he is not under duress.</p>\n\n<p>(There is discussion in the Rishonim regarding this issue, based on Daniel chapter 3.

As such, bowing is assur (even without prostration - pishut yadaim veraglayim). Even removing one's hat in deference is assur (cf Yoreh Deah 150:3 Rema)</p>\n\n<p>If one is bowing down to a person who is not treated as a diety and is not wearing religious items to which he is also bowing, there is no problem.

However, a minhag like saluting the sefer torah during hagbah with the pinky does not conflict with any Ashkenazi minhag and thus \"importing\" it presents no problem. </p>\n\n<p>Let's take a more interesting case, though. Would it be permissible for an Ashkenazi synagogue to adopt the custom of the having the priestly blessing on every Sabbath? At first glance, this would appear to be acceptable under the reasoning I provided above, because the custom is to have the blessing on Yom Tov, and Ashekenazi synagogues in Eretz Yisroel have adopted this. However, in fact, the minhag, which like most very well-established minhagim is legalistically codified somewhere,[2] states that we are <em>only</em> to have birchas hakohanim on Yom Tov, and therefore, although it would seem that it is permissible, it is actually not so simple: this is why Chabad, for all their enthusiasm for Sefardi minhagim, did not adopt this one.[3] Minhagim can be annulled, of course, although doing so often requires the supervision of a rav and, in the case of adopting foreign minhagim, the hassle might not be worthwhile.</p>\n\n<p>[1] R' Dovid Fink shlita gave this over to me in a shiur where he also mentioned that one should specifically intend to NOT adopt any new minhagim, because they effectively create new halakha for one to follow and potentially violate. According to most poskim, following a valid new minhag even once with the kevanah that you are taking it on causes it to become your minhag: the Baal HaTanya uniquely holds that it requires three different instances.</p>\n\n<p>[2] It was just read to me out of a book. I believe it is <em>Sefer Minhagim</em>, which  is the Chabad codex morium.</p>\n\n<p>[3] Source: my LOR, a small-town Chabad shliach.</p>\n\n\n",

The <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%96%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beis Ephraim</a> in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=642&pgnum=236\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. #68</a> (paragraph starting מעתה) explains that it is a qualitatively lower level of learning, and there is such a thing as ביטול תורה באיכות - qualitative bittul Torah. (The Beis Ephraim has further proof to this from Berachos 10b and the Rashba there, among other proofs.) The glosses of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Strashun\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashash</a> to that Gemara, based on the Shulchan Aruch, says the same thing.  The Pele Yo'etz in Chelek 2, Erech Tehillim, 88b also writes that there is Bittul Torah in qualitatively \"lesser\" learning.  The <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%91%22%D7%A5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chassid Yavetz</a> (15th century) in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=5282&st=&pgnum=146\" rel=\"nofollow\">commentary to Avos 6:4</a> writes a similar idea - that the learning of Torah is measured according to the one learning, not the material learned.  The Shulchan Aruch HaRav (18th century) in Hilchos Talmud Torah 2:5 writes that anyone who reviews what they have already learned because it is easier (as opposed to in order to remember it) literally is responsible for their own life.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, even a mitzvah (even those who understand the Gemara is about the transit time of going to hear the Megillah will agree that the travel to do a <em>mitzvah</em> is also considered a level of <em>mitzvah</em> and even has the exemption from other <em>mitzvos</em> due to being involved in a current <em>mitzvah</em>) is called bittul Torah and requires justification (See the gemara there, which learns from a kal v'chomer that this particular Bittul Torah is acceptable). It seems that any act of not learning needs justification (I am making the assumption that the threshold of justification is more than \"I was having fun;\" otherwise the Gemara wouldn't very much need to tell us about reading Megillah being enough of a justification, nor to learn that it is a justification from a kal v'chomer).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rambam presents bittul Torah not as a bittul assei in the normal sense, but rather as an independent category of \"dvar Hashem baza\".</p>\n\n<p>This is doesnt seem to be a technical halachic legal entity, but rather a directive to our way of life.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason it is unsurprising that rather than writing that one transgresses this for missing a minute of learning, or even for some other technical violation, Rambam writes (Hil. Talmud Torah 1:13) that one \"violates\" this by completely disregarding Torah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי דְבַר ה' בָּזָה זֶה שֶׁלֹּא הִשְׁגִּיחַ עַל דִּבְרֵי תּוֹרָה כָּל עִקָּר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the extent of the obligation to study Torah, although Rambam lauds constant involvement with Torah and wisdom, he holds that the obligation is only to learn in the day and in the night; not every minute.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁמִּצְוָה לִלְמֹד בַּיּוֹם וּבַלַּיְלָה אֵין אָדָם לָמֵד רֹב חָכְמָתוֹ אֶלָּא בַּלַּיְלָה. לְפִיכָךְ מִי שֶׁרָצָה לִזְכּוֹת בְּכֶתֶר הַתּוֹרָה יִזָּהֵר בְּכָל לֵילוֹתָיו וְלֹא יְאַבֵּד אֲפִלּוּ אֶחָד מֵהֶן בְּשֵׁנָה וַאֲכִילָה וּשְׁתִיָּה וְשִׂיחָה וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן אֶלָּא בְּתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה וְדִבְרֵי חָכְמָה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(ibid)</p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of Rishonim understand that the Gemara in Nedarim (8a) accords it the view of R. Yochanan in Menachos (99a). According to his view one discharges his obligation to study Torah with the recitation of the shma. Assuming one has done so, according to their view there would be no bittul assei in studying other sciences (as there is in the view of R. Yishmael, R. Yochanan's disputant in Menachos).</p>\n\n\n",

He said that given the limited number of kosher 'outlets' available nowadays, we don't care as much about Avodah Zarah [especially given the lack desire nowadays to serve idols], so as long as the book is appropriate in other matters, it can be read.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that this answer would also apply to the book you mentioned in question 3, but I'm writing that separately, as the specific example of Percy Jackson was asked to my Rebbi, so I can confirm that question with certainty. It might even apply to your first question also, but that case might be different. I wouldn't be too surprised if there's a difference between informational purposes and entertainment purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Reb Moshe has a Teshuvah on a similar topic (Y.D. Chelek 2, Siman 53. It's a fascinating Teshuva, and relatively short too (only about a column and a half), if anyone's looking for a short, fun piece to read). A history teacher asked if he was allowed to teach about Greek history in public school, as it would necessarily include speaking about Avodah Zarah. Reb Moshe responded it was permitted, since everyone nowadays knows it to be false. He also mentioned that it might even be a good lesson for the students, to show them that it's possible for a majority of the world to believe in something false.</p>\n\n<p>It's interesting to note also that Reb Moshe wrote that if a textbook was written with the intent of glorifying the idol, it is forbidden to read it even nowadays, while if it was written with the intent of mocking the idol (i.e. describing the 'crazy things' that idolaters do), then it was permitted to read it even in the days when idolatry was prevalent. Yet it's curious that Reb Moshe doesn't directly address the case where a work was written for 'neutral' reasons, i.e. educational purposes.</p>\n\n<p>It's also important to note that Reb Moshe's Teshva was addressed to a teacher, who needed to teach that information as part of his livelihood (granted, Avodah Zarah is one of the big three sins that one would need to give their life for and not transgress, all the more so one would need to give up their job, but if Reb Moshe's question was dealing with a different transgression [and from the context of the Teshuva, it seemed like the issur in question was only a rabbinic decree to prevent 'Al Tifnu El Haelilim', which unfortunately I don't know enough about to explain it's relationship to 'Avodah Zarah], then the permission might only apply in the teacher's case).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Although there is a prohibition to read books about idolatry or even say their names (Rambam Avodah Zara 2:3), R. Moshe Feinstein (Y.D. II 53) has stated that, like in other halakhos of Avodah Zara, we need not be concerned if that form of idol worship has been annulled (which in this context means that nobody worships it anymore). However, <a href=\"http://5tjt.com/percy-jackson-and-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Yair Hoffman</a> believes that even Rav Moshe would prohibit reading about idols and idolatrous practices unless it is portrayed in a negative light. </p></li>\n<li><p>While there's no prohibition in reading about fictional 'gods' per se, reading novels is not a simple matter. The Yerushalmi (Sanhedrin 10:1) states that reading'books of Homer' is like reading letters and permissible, but most poskim imply otherwise. The Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 307:16) seems to prohibit reading all novels as does Tosfos and Rosh to Shabbos 116b, and the Rambam (Commentary to Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1) is particularly emphatic that one who reads books of stories, \"kings and their behaviors\", wastes time and doesn't deserve a share in the World to Come. These days, it seems that many Rabbis take it for granted that we need some form of entertainment, and it's probably better than doing nothing, as בטלה מביאה לידי זימה (idleness brings about lewdness - Kesubos 59b), but this is a sensitive matter and should probably be brought to your LOR (local Orthodox Rabbi). More importantly, contemporary novels (even ones written for teenagers) may contain what many b'nei Torah consider to be 'inappropriate material'. (I wouldn't know about this series as I've never read them, sorry).</p></li>\n<li><p>I'm not entirely sure if I understood from Wikipedia what's considered a 'novel of kefirah', but when it comes to books that one might suspect would lead one away from God there's the explicit prohibition of 'אל תפנו אל מדעתכם' - do not remove God from your minds (Shabbos 149, see Igros Moshe quoted above). While there may be dispensations in order to know how to respond to a heretic (Rambam, Rashbatz and R. Yakov Emden to Avos 2:2, Meiri to Sanhedrin 11:1), I would still ask your LOR here to: the answer may be different depending on the individual book as well as the personality (and possibly level of religious commitment) of the person asking the question. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

If you're tempted to check it or fiddle with it, or if it distracts you from Shabbos, then R. Ari advised me to leave it at home, even if there wasn't a definite halakic reason not to wear it. </p>\n\n<p>This consideration is my own: does your pedometer set off any lights or vibrations to tell you you met your goal? Progress lights? Could you set these lights off accidentally e.g. by tapping the device? These would probably violate prohibitions against measuring things and switching lights on/off. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>In Kistur Shulchan Aruch there is a paragraph about wearing watches on Shabat. As far as I remember, it is written that it's surely allowed for women to wear watches on Shabat because it's not only a practical object but also a beauty item. \nFor men, nowadays it is allowed based on the fact that it is an usual clothing item.</p>\n\n<p>Although in a footnote, it is stated: Blessed be he who is strict in this manner.</p>\n\n<p>The above said, is about watches. If this fitness tracker you talk about has internet acces or \"collects data\" it falls in the category of muctse. So its forbidden for another reason. Further, it is not an usual clothing item, mainly in those places we go at Shabbos such as the Synagoge and festive meals.</p>\n\n<p>Ps: If you wear digital watches, remember you cant press any of its buttons during Shabbos!\nPss: Ask your rabbi for his answer. Good luck there! Good Shabbos!</p>\n\n\n",

He clearly states that the level of scrupulousness required by each individual is dependent on their level of scholarship (5:11). </p>\n\n<p>It is well known that the Chafetz Chaim said that yeshiva boys are held to a higher standard than the general population and must act accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Hypocrisy is one of the most blatant forms of insincerity that often results in total disinterest and feelings of disgust by those who are exposed to it and causes people to have a negative attitude towards Torah, Mitzvos and Judaism which creates enormous Chillul Hashem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Serious Consequences for Hypocritical Acts Committed Even With the Command of a Navi</strong>\nSee Targum Yonasan (Hoshea 1:4) who explains that the reason Achav was killed was for serving Avodah Zarah. Yehu and his family also served Avodah Zarah. Because Yehu followed in Achav's ways, he had no right to carry out the prophecy about Achav, and he was found to be deserving of punishment for killing Achav <em>as if he spilled innocent blood</em>. </p>\n\n<p>This is found in much greater detail in Shmiras Halashon ch 17, a small snippet follows\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MkQq0.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While I cannot think of any overt prohibition, two Talmudic sources clearly convey that hypocrisy is frowned upon:</p>\n\n<p>1) The Gemara in Pesachim 113b describes that God despises three types of people. One of these is Echad b'Peh, v'echad b'Lev. This is someone who externally expresses something while he internally feels something different.</p>\n\n<p>2) The second principle is Tocho K'varo: The gemara in Yoma 72b states that a Talmid Chacham (scholar) whose inside does not reflect his outside is not a true Talmid Chacham.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Basically whatever you wouldn't want someone to conduct himself towards you, you should not conduct yourself towards G-d. This is not explicitly written in the torah because it can be easily derived from reason. See the Chovos Halevavos for many examples. Here's one from the Gate of Trust <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=380#ch3\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch.3</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But, If one trusts in G-d and rebels against Him, how foolish is he,\n  how weak is his intellect and his understanding! For he can see in\n  this world that if an employer appoints a man to do something or\n  refrain from doing something and the man disobeys the instruction,\n  this will be the strongest factor in the employer's refusing to\n  fulfill his side of the deal. All the more so, for one who disobeys\n  the commandments of G-d, for which G-d Himself testified that one who\n  trusts in Him and disobeys Him will have his hopes foiled and his\n  trust will be considered hypocritical. Rather, he will be like that of\n  who it is written \"For what is the hope of the flatterer who deceives,\n  when G-d casts off his soul? Will G-d hear his cry when trouble comes\n  on him?\" (Iyov 27:8-9), and \"Will you steal, murder, commit adultery,\n  swear falsely, offer up to idols, and follow other gods that you know\n  not. And will you come and stand before Me in this house, upon which\n  My Name is called, and say, 'We are saved,' in order to commit all\n  these abominations? Has this house upon which My Name is called,\n  become a den of thieves in your eyes? I, too, behold I have seen it,\n  says the L-ord.\" (Yirmiyahu 7:9-11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, one who prays hypocritically is closer to being \"real\" than the one who does not pray at all. For most people you have to start with ulterior motives and eventually work your way up to higher motives.</p>\n\n\n",

Long hair is here defined as shoulder-length or longer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>When I was learning in Israel, someone posted an article written by R' Aharon Lichtenstein about having long hair.  If I recall correctly, there were 3 issues he raised and evaluated:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Interruption for tefillin</strong>:\n       There is a dispute between the Machatzis Hashekel and the Pri Megadim as to whether hair is an interruption on the spot it is grown, or only if it is spread onto that part of the head from roots somewhere else on the head.  R' Lichtenstein concluded that the opinion of the Pri Megadim is reliable, although he pointed out that there is possibly the same issue of an interruption by the knot at the back, and it is very difficult for someone with long hair to not have it hanging down over the spot where the knot in the back will be.</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>Imitating the ways of non-Jews</strong>\n      The verse in Vayikra 18:3 says not to imitate the ways of the Egyptians or the Canaanites.  The Rambam in Hilchos Avodas Kochavim 11:1 writes that one should not resemble idolaters, and one example he gives is in their hair-styles.  The Maharik writes that the prohibition applies to anything the non-Jews do for a non-utilitarian purpose.  The Vilna Gaon writes that this prohibition applies to anything that a Jew does as an act of following non-Jewish culture, regardless of why the non-Jews do so.  Accordingly, R' Lichtenstein entertained that this would constitute a Biblical violation according to both the Maharik and the Vilna Gaon. However, this would depend on assessing whether this is done commonly enough within Jewish society to consider it a purely non-Jewish mode of dress.  But it is at least something to be concerned about.</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>Man wearing a woman's clothing</strong>:\n      Devarim 25:5 states that a man shall not wear a woman's clothing.  The Netziv, based off of the Sifri, says that there are two aspects of the prohibition, one of which is doing an act which is specific to the opposite gender.  Rabbi Lichtenstein was uncertain if this was definitively something gender-specific to women, but concluded that it was at least possibly included, and therefore, again, a man growing long hair should be avoided to avoid a possible Biblical prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>He concluded with a \"spirit of the Law\" type of discussion about the immoral roots the culture that spawned this hair-style (think Woodstock) and its association therewith.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it's not such a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>(If I find the article I will edit in more specific sources.  Anyone else is welcome to do so also.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See Rabbi Neustadt’s <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0XGwWdV8ZQsC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=tefillin+hair+chatzitzah&source=bl&ots=WgvtUxsK-t&sig=63PeMrgEsznAknXkMAFJqVAH-rE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cPFnU-T2OMTo7AbkyICYBw&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=tefillin%20hair%20chatzitzah&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">book</a> which quotes the Mishnah Berurah <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=72\" rel=\"nofollow\">27: 15</a> to say that long hair is not a natural outgrowth of the body and therefore constitutes a chatzitzah between the head and the head-tefila.

Rabbi Ovadia Yosef concludes that it is \n  worthwhile to give musar about this and remind people how a ben torah \n  should present himself. Rabbi Shternbuch reports that when he visited \n  Rav Ahron Rokeach (the Belzer Rebbe), the Rebbe asked him to tell  the\n  yeshiva boys that his father thought growing long hair was an issur\n  deoraiso, and he obviously thought it was something worth correcting. \n  Rabbi Shternbuch does note that when a boy comes from a family  where\n  he is expected to keep up with certain styles, and a sudden  change in\n  outward appearance is likely to upset the sholom bayis and may \n  discourage the parents from supporting the boy’s development as a ben\n  torah  , it is certainly ill advised for the boy to cut his hair.\n  However, even  in these circumstances the ben torah  should realize\n  that the ultimate goal  should be to appear as a ben torah  and avoid\n  the various concerns outlined  in this essay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fZwYW.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The Shulachan Aruch explains that on Rosh Hodesh we relive tefillin  at the time of Musaf, which is the Tefila of Keter, we say keter Yintu Lecha.

Klal Yisroel fed the Erev Rav with the left overs of the Mon and from water from within the camps of Klal Yisroel.\nThe Ba'al Haturim (Bigining of Parshas Masey) writes that from Ramses Klal Yisroel traveled on their own and the Erev Rav were no longer inter mingled with them. \nThe Ramban (Parshas Noso 5 5) understood that from when the Mishkan was set up, the Erev Rav were separated from Klal Yisroel. The Haflo'oh (Ponim Yofos) writes that he couldn't find a source that Klal Yisroel and the Erev Rav were separated. This Ramban can be understood in light of the words of the Vilna Goen (Shir Hashirim 1 4) that after the Egel, the ענני הכבוד disappeared, and only returned when the mishkan was set up. Since the ענני הכבוד returned, so did the separation between Klal Yisroel and the Erev Rav.\nThe Rogetchover Goen (Noso 5 4) held that even though they were outside the clouds, they were carried by the clouds and under their influence somewhat.</p>\n\n<p>[The Chidah (Rosh Dovid beginning of Parshas Emor) and Bney Yisoschor (Tisrey 10 15) quote a Rav Yehudah who addressed the famous question why we have a - זכר - a symbol to remember the miracle of the ענני הכבוד and not the nes of the באר or the מן. He explained that the מן and באר were shared with the Erev Rav, but the nes of the ענני הכבוד was unique to Klal Yisroel, hence the Torah wanted us to remember it].\n[The Ramban asks why Chazal learn from a special Possuk that gerim must also sit in the succah on Succos, why should this mitzvah be different than any other one. The Achronim explain based on the above mentioned Chazal, that the gerim were excluded from the ענני הכבוד so we would have thought that they are excluded from succah too, as succah symbolizes the ענני הכבוד, therefore a special possuk is needed].\n[The Meshech Chochmah (Parshas Beha'alosecho) writes that the point which intrigued Yisro so much with the מלחמת עמלק to the extent that it made him become a convert, was that Amalek could only threaten the people outside the ענני הכבוד - no stranger could enter the עננים (this is discussed in the Meforshim) - and when Amalek came to fight the Yiden they started killing the Erev Rav outside (see Pirkey DeRebbi Elozor ch 44) and nevertheless Klal Yisroel went to help the Erev Rav and fought Amalek, this show of care impressed Yisro tremendously].</p>\n\n<p>We have touched on a tip of the ice berg, and one could write volumes about the exact position of the Erev Rav in the midbar, but let this suffice for now!\n see also <a href=\"http://www.behindthedaf.com/articles/erev-rav/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.behindthedaf.com/articles/erev-rav/</a> for more on the erev rav</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sanhedrin 99a: אין להם משיח לישראל שכבר אכלוהו בימי חזקיה\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l4411.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 99a</a>, we find the phrase אין להם משיח לישראל שכבר אכלוהו בימי חזקיה.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' הילל אומר <strong>אין להם משיח לישראל שכבר אכלוהו בימי חזקיה</strong> אמר רב יוסף שרא ליה מריה לרבי הילל חזקיה אימת הוה בבית ראשון ואילו זכריה קא מתנבי בבית שני ואמר (זכריה ט) גילי מאד בת ציון הריעי בת ירושלים הנה מלכך יבא לך צדיק ונושע הוא עני ורוכב על חמור ועל עיר בן אתונות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is the sense of אכלוהו here, and is it (i.e., אכל) used elsewhere (in the same sense) in any contemporary Jewish writings or even in the Tanakh? </p>\n\n<p>I know אכל typically means \"to eat,\" but that doesn't seem to be the sense the author (ר' הילל) used it in that passage (since there are no extant accounts testifying that Hezekiah was ever literally eaten by his peers).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To the first point: \"Achluhu\" means, consumed rather than merely eaten. In this context it means that the Moshiach was consumed, used up, in the days of Chizkiyahu.</p>\n\n<p>To the second: One other example is Shemot 24:17 -\n  וּמַרְאֵה כְּבוֹד יְהוָה, כְּאֵשׁ אֹכֶלֶת בְּרֹאשׁ הָהָר, לְעֵינֵי, בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל. The term eish ochelet comes from the same root word achilah, but refers to a consuming fire rather than an eating fire.</p>\n\n<p>If you are still worried about R' Hillel seeming heretical, see this post by R' Gil Student that sheds some light on your aforementioned passage: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2010/06/was-rabbi-hillel-heretic.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2010/06/was-rabbi-hillel-heretic.html</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This means that all of the prophecies concerning Mashiach and how great things will be in his generation were already 'consumed' in the time of Chizkiyahu; that those prophecies were already used up and enjoyed. Examples abound (see <a href=\"http://www.morfix.co.il/en/%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow\">this dictionary</a> which gives 'use up' as a definition for אכל), many involving fire's consumption: see Shemot 3:2 וְהִנֵּה הַסְּנֶה בֹּעֵר בָּאֵשׁ וְהַסְּנֶה אֵינֶנּוּ אֻכָּל and Shemot 24:17 וּמַרְאֵה כְּבוֹד יְהוָה, כְּאֵשׁ אֹכֶלֶת בְּרֹאשׁ הָהָר לְעֵינֵי, בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>implication</em> is that there will therefore not be a future Mashiach, because after all, you can't eat your Mashiach and have it too. However, there are alternative interpretations. Rashi and Yad Ramah (there) say that Hillel believed in an era of redemption but that it wouldn't be led by a particular person. Sefer HaIkarrim (1:1) mentions an opinion that R. Hillel still believed that Mashiach would come, but that he knew that based on other verses, or as the Chasam Sofer (Teshuva Y.D. II no. 356) insists, he still believed in the Mashiach because of a tradition, but not because of any particular prophecies. Either, way, as both of those sources point out, it would be prohibited for someone to believe that today.</p>\n\n\n",

Similarly, Sefer Hachinuch refers to Mishpatim as \"ve'Elah hamishpatim\" parsha Bo as \"Bo el Paro\" and even adds a break in Mishpatim to have another Parsha! (The minhag of Barcelona was to sometimes divide Mispatim into 2 portions so that Parsha Metzora is read before Pesach. That is why sefer haChinuch has a parsha called \"Im Kesef Talveh\" (see Sefer HaChinuch, Machon Yerushalayim edition, pg 308 footnote 1))</p>\n\n<p>It is pretty clear that the standardized naming of parshas is of more recent vintage, perhaps when calendars with printed weekly parshios became popular.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, perhaps one has the right, as some do, to interpret the parsha names homiletically since \"minhag Yisrael Torah\" and the Hashgacha peratis that directs Israel through the years of exile has directed us in this direction.

    "content": "# Are There Any Good Sources for How \"Ancient\" (Pre-Talmudic) Prayer Was Done?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While reading this answer to another question about the development of the Siddur (<a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?cat=433\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, look specifically at the question about \"Modern Laws Vs. Shulcan Aruch\"), I came upon this question. Here is the selection that spurred the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rambam in hilchot tefila (Chap. 1) gives a brief history of Tefila. The beginning of structured Tefila began with Anshei Knesset Hagedola, who formulated the Shmoneh Esreh (Berachot 23a) which is the focal point of the Tefila... The first written siddur was edited in the 9th century , by one of the Ge'onim, Cohen Tzedek. <</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, the question is not about the Siddur part of the quote, but about the Shemoneh Esrei. </p>\n\n<p>What were the \"ancient\" Pre-Talmudic prayers like? </p>\n\n<p>Are there any great sources for this research?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rambam, Hilchos Tefillah 1:3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם היה רגיל, מרבה בתחינה ובקשה; ואם היה ערל שפתיים, מדבר כפי יוכלו ובכל עת שירצה.  וכן מניין התפילות, כל אחד ואחד כפי יכולתו--יש שמתפלל פעם אחת ביום, ויש שמתפלל פעמים הרבה.  והכול היו מתפללים נוכח המקדש, בכל מקום שיהיה.  וכן היה הדבר תמיד ממשה רבנו, עד עזרא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If someone was accustomed, they would increase in supplication and beseeching.  If he did not know how to speak fluently, he would do as much as he could.  And similarly with the number of prayers, each according to his ability - some would pray once a day, some many times.  And everyone would pray towards the Mikdash, no matter where they were.  This continued from the times of Moses until Ezra.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>A good source for how Kriat Shema developed over time is <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9655240347\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Why We Pray What We Pray\"</a> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Freundel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Dr. Barry Freundel</a>. I was quite surprised to learn of some of its earlier content (including the ten commandments, possibly Parshat Balak, why the section on tzitzit was added relatively late in its development).</p>\n\n<p>A good source for how the Shemona Esrai developed before its codification by Rabban Gamaliel is the chapter \"How the Amidah Began\" by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_A._Hoffman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Lawrence A Hoffman</a> contained in <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/187904580X\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"My People's Prayer Book, Volume 2, the Amidah\"</a>. It contains a discussion of how we got to <strong>nineteen</strong> blessings in a prayer usually called \"The Eighteen\", bringing in sources from the Talmud <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berakhot_%28Talmud%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tractate Berachot</a>, an early-modern textual study by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Zunz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leopold Zunz</a>, and a comparison of the fragments found in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Geniza\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cairo Geniza</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

If He created you out of nothing, then how can He do so out of loving kindness towards \"you\". The fact that He created you a human being instead of a frog is all just coincidence for \"you\" did not yet exist.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Human beings are limited in all their capacities. The very fact that we can't create something from nothing limits our ability to give to something that is non-existent. God, however, can create something from nothing, and therefore can give to a non-existent entity. To make this all more complicated, God is not constrained by time, and therefore everything exists in his presence even \"before\" he creates them. =\n[Personally, that part just makes me confused, being a human being with only an understanding of a chronological order of events.]</p>\n\n<p>To understand the concept of giving to a non-existent entity, imagine donating money to a gift fund for an unborn baby. Since you \"know\" it will be (hopefully) come, you can donate to it's future existence. God not only \"knows\" the person will be created, He actually currently exists in the future, where the not-yet-created person is existing.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to note, too, that God's creating of you is the biggest loving-kindness itself...</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>turns out the translation was wrong. it should have said \"as a kindness towards you\" not \"out of His loving kindness towards you\"</p>\n\n\n",

I am fond of a Sefaradi sidur (Bnei Tzion) where it says that Hallel (113-118) is said only with minian ...” <a href=\"http://halachahbyemail.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://halachahbyemail.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/</a>… says “In truth, the requirement is not for a minyan, per se; even having three people present, so that one leads \"Hodu\" and the others respond, may suffice. (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 422:2; Mishneh Berurah 422:18)”. –  Avrohom Yitzchok </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So now I'm wondering -- are there other credible opinions that <em>do</em> require a minyan (and my minyan may be following one of them), could there be some other custom at play here, or is this likely to be an error?  The minyan is not of Sephardic background.

In fact, the Pasuk (Shoftim 5:1) records that Devora the prophetess sang a song of praise to Hashem together with Barak the son of Avinoam.</p>\n<p>Rav Mosheh Lichtenstein argues that the ruling of the Divrei Cheifetz and Seridei Eish permits listening to a woman singing at official Tzahal events that are formal and serious. He first bolsters the opinion of the Divrei Cheifetz and the Seridei Eish by demonstrating that Rambam, Rashba and Ra’avyah agree that the Kol Ishah prohibition is not absolute but rather emerges from concern lest it lead to sin. Thus, in a context that concern for sin is not relevant, the Kol Ishah does not apply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It may be possible to extend R' Lichtenstein's reasoning to other formal and serious events, such as the one in the question, especially given that singing holy songs should not lead to concern for sin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Teshuvot Igrot Moshe O.C.1:26) and Rav Ovadia Yosef (Taharat Habayit 2:270) rule (based on the Mishna Berura 75:17) that in case of need, one may rely on the ruling that the prohibition of Kol Isha does not apply to girls who are not Niddot. Rav Moshe writes (in 1947) that one may assume that there is no question with girls below the age of eleven. Rav Moshe writes that men must be strict regarding girls older than the age of eleven, since there are girls who “nowadays” become Niddot at the age of eleven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.tabc.org/kol-torah/article/index.aspx?pageaction=ViewSinglePublic&LinkID=712&ModuleID=43&StartDate=4/5/2013&NEWSPID=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.tabc.org/kol-torah/article/index.aspx?pageaction=ViewSinglePublic&LinkID=712&ModuleID=43&StartDate=4/5/2013&NEWSPID=1</a> (alternate location: <a href=\"http://koltorah.org/ravj/The%20Parameters%20of%20Kol%20Isha.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://koltorah.org/ravj/The%20Parameters%20of%20Kol%20Isha.htm</a> )</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In theory you could skip it altogether!</p>\n\n<p>Aryeh Frimer and others posit that it's a bad idea to have someone who can't lead the mandatory parts of prayers \"lead services\" for the optional parts -- those lines will get blurred quickly.

Please, no jokes or derogatory remarks.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>the Talmud in Beitza 25b says:</p>\n\n<p>\"Why was the Torah given to the Jewish People? Because they are the most brazen of all nations.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>First of all, I think it's important to point out that, like all stereotypes, the proliferation of the stereotype is generally a result of bigotry and ignorance. One can just look at the overwhelming number of hospitals and community centers donated by Jews, disproportionate to other religions, as a proof that we aren't greedy. This is even with excluding 'Jewish' causes i.e. Yeshivos, Jewish orphanages, etc. as one can argue that those are intended to help 'only other Jews', which still shows a lack of greed, yet might nevertheless not be realized by the outside world as lack of greed. Granted, that might lead into an argument that Jews have all the money, but that's a different stereotype.</p>\n\n<p>But like with any effective lie, it's usually based on a grain of truth, so I'll try to give a reason why I believe some of the stereotypes you've mentioned exist.</p>\n\n<p>Rudeness: Historically, and possibly for good reason, Jews wanted to keep themselves separate from the rest of the world. We have always discouraged intermarriage, and there are many other laws designed to keep our interaction with non-Jews to a minimum. Examples include laws like Yayin Nesech* (wine that was handled by a non-Jew; must be discarded), Pas Akum (literally 'bread of a non-Jew'; Jews are forbidden from eating bread made by a non Jew), among others.</p>\n\n<p>In Megillas Esther (3:8-9), Haman argues to King Achashveirosh that it would be good to kill the Jews. One of his arguments (based on the commentary of the Vilna Gaon, I believe) was \"If a fly touches a cup of wine, the Jews would remove the fly and drink the wine, yet if the king touched the wine, they would discard the wine\". When examples like this are taken out of context and portrayed to the world in a disparaging light, it would spread the belief that Jews are rude and don't want to associate with 'other guys'.</p>\n\n<p>(On a similar note, I always found it amusing that Haman seems to contradict himself in two of his arguments against the Jews. At one point he says that Jews don't pay taxes anyways, so the king wouldn't lose out on money by killing them, yet he also says that he'll give 10,000 silver pieces to cover the tax money the king would lose by not having the Jews around. So which one is it, did the Jews pay taxes or didn't they? Like some stereotypes nowadays too, they seem to be contradicting themselves)</p>\n\n<p>Greed: In the middle ages in Europe, Jews were very limited in their job choices due to Christian persecution. They couldn't own land, and they were 'discouraged' discouraged from other businesses. However, there was one business that was open exclusively to the Jews. While Christians got rid of most of the commandments in the Torah (to them the Old Testament'), there were select few commandments that they kept. One of them was the prohibition against lending with interest. In this case, they followed the law according to Halachah, which says that you are not allowed to lend with interest to your 'brother'. They believed this meant that Christians couldn't lend money to other Christians. In truth, that is what the Halachah is, and similarly, Jews can't lend to other Jews with interest. But since banks are needed for society to exist, and Jews were locked out form other professions, Jews became the bankers for Christians.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of being the only ones 'legally' allowed to be bankers, the stereotype of 'greedy Jewish moneylender' began, and continues through to this day.</p>\n\n<p>To end off on a light note, I remember reading an article on The Onion a while back making fun of the stereotype that Jews control the world. It was titled 'Local Jew Feels Left Out of Worldwide Jewish Conspiracy'. I agree with that guy, I wouldn't mind the Jews that control the world throwing me a few bucks here and there :)</p>\n\n<p>*Disclaimer on the examples: I'm giving the really shorthand version of those laws. As with just about everything else, there are many more finer details in each case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As far as I am aware, there is no Jewish rabbinical or Torah source that Jews are any ruder or greedier than any other nation. On the contrary, the Talmud states that kindness is a fundamental characteristic of the Jewish people:</p>\n\n<p>\"The Jewish nation is distinguished by three characteristics: they are merciful, they are modest, and they perform acts of loving-kindness.\" (Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 79a).</p>\n\n<p>We even suspect someone is not Jewish, or not descended from Avraham Avinu, if he is cruel:  </p>\n\n<p>\"Whenever a person is cruel and does not show mercy, his lineage is suspect, for cruelty is found only among the gentiles, as [Jeremiah] 3:42] states: 'They are cruel and will not show mercy.'\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/986711/jewish/Matnot-Aniyiim-Chapter-10.htm#footnoteRef4a986711\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/986711/jewish/Matnot-Aniyiim-Chapter-10.htm#footnoteRef4a986711</a></p>\n\n<p>\"Whenever one does not show mercy to the created beings, it can be recognized that he is not from the seed of Abraham our patriarch\" (Beitzah 32b).</p>\n\n<p>As an empirical matter, it would be impossible to measure objectively whether Jews are ruder or greedier than average. Israelis are sometimes perceived as rude, but many disagree with this, and say that they are kinder in practice than non-Israelis. I have personally never heard the stereotype that Jews are rude, and in my own experience I think Jews (whether religious or non-religious) are if anything kinder than non-Jews, and at the very least are just as kind and generous as average non-Jewish Americans.</p>\n\n\n",

There are two facts which this modern tradition deny: 1) there is no atonement without blood; the act of personal repentance is not substitute to the sacrificial system, but both are two sides of same coin; both are necessary for forgiveness. (2) the sacrificial atonement covers all sins. However the scholars created exception for exceptional rebellious people. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Writing in the Encyclopedia Judaica, Anson F. Rainey, a professor at\n  Tel Aviv University and a foremost biblical and Semitic scholar,\n  provided these important insights: The prophets of the First Temple\n  period often spoke out against sacrificial ritual (Amos 5:21-27; Hos.\n  6:6; Micah 6:6-8; Isa. 1:11-17; Jer. 6:20; 7:21-22). Righteous and\n  just behavior along with obedience to the Lord are contrasted with the\n  conduct of rituals unaccompanied by proper ethical and more attitudes\n  (Amos 5:24; Micah 6:8; Isa. 1:16-17; Jer. 7:23). It has thus been\n  assumed by many scholars that the prophets condemned all sacrificial\n  rituals. [The Catholic biblical scholar Roland] De Vaux has shown the\n  absurdity of such a conclusion since Isaiah 1:15 also condemns prayer.\n  No one holds that the prophets rejected prayer; it was prayer offered\n  without the proper moral commitment that was being denounced; the same\n  holds true for the oracles against formal rituals. Similar allusions\n  in the Psalms which might be taken as a complete rejection of\n  sacrifice (e.g., 40:7-8; 50:8-15) actually express the same concern\n  for inner attitude as the prophets. The wisdom literature sometimes\n  reflects the same concern for moral and ethical values over empty\n  sacerdotal acts (Prov. 15:8, 21:3, 27). Certain other statements by\n  Amos (5:25) and Jeremiah (7:22) have been taken to mean that the\n  prophets knew nothing of a ritual practice followed in the wilderness\n  experience of Israel. De Vaux has noted that Jeremiah clearly knew\n  Deuteronomy 12:6-14 and regarded it as the Law of Moses. The prophetic\n  oracles against sacrifice in the desert are really saying that the\n  original Israelite sacrificial system was not meant to be the empty,\n  hypocritical formalism practiced by their contemporaries. The demand\n  by Hosea for “mercy not sacrifice…knowledge of God more than burnt\n  offerings” (Hos. 6:6; cf. Matt. 9:13; 12:7) is surely to be taken as\n  relative, a statement of priorities (cf. also I Sam. 15:22). The inner\n  attitude was prerequisite to any valid ritual expression (Isa. 29:13).\n  Foreign elements that had penetrated the Israelite sacrificial system,\n  were of course, roundly condemned by the prophets. Such was especially\n  the case with Israel (Amos 4:5; Hos. 2:13-15; 4:11-13; 13:2) but also\n  in Judah (Jer. 7:17-18; Ezek. 8; et al.). 124</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>also </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The rabbis (see b. Shevu’ot 2b; 6b-14a) comment specifically on the\n  words rebellion (transgressions in Hebrew) and sins, explaining that\n  “transgressions” refers to acts of rebellion – which are certainly\n  intentional – while “sins” refers to inadvertent acts. 232 And it is\n  the goat whose blood is sprinkled in the Most Holy Place that effects\n  atonement for the people, just as the blood of the bull offered up by\n  the High Priest effects atonement for him (m . Shevu’ot 1:7, following\n  Lev. 16:11, “Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to\n  make atonement for himself and his household, and he is to slaughter\n  the bull for his own sin offering.”). – Brown, Answering Jewish\n  Objections to Jesus, Volume 2, Theological Objections, p. 131  To\n  further emphasize the vital connection between blood and atonement,\n  let me cite the observations made by the two most important Talmud\n  commentaries (Rashi and Tosafot) to this Rabbinic dictum that “there\n  is no atonement without blood.” Rashi states that “the fundamental\n  principle (‘iqqar) of atonement is in the blood” (b. Yoma 5a).\n  Tosafot, also discussing the Talmudic statement that there is no\n  atonement without blood, makes reference to a passage found elsewhere\n  in the Talmud (b. Pesahim 59b) that indicated that the priests had to\n  eat certain specified sacrifices if those offering were to have their\n  atoning effect. 180 Tosafot then concludes, “But in any case, the\n  fundamental principle [again, ‘iqqar] of atonement doesn’t exist\n  without blood.” (b. Zevahim 6a). – Brown, Answering Jewish Objections\n  to Jesus, Volume 2, Theological Objections, p. 109-110</p>\n  \n  <p>The offense outline here [in Lev 5:17-19 , or 6:1-7 in most English\n  translations] were quite definitely intentional! A person\n  misappropriated property or funds entrusted to his safekeeping, or\n  defrauded another, or failed to restore lost property he had\n  located….If, subsequently, the accused came forth on his own and\n  admitted to having lied under oath – thus assuming liability for the\n  unrecovered property – he was given the opportunity to clear himself\n  by making restitution and by paying a fine of 20 percent to the\n  aggrieved party. Having lied under oath, he had also offended God and\n  was obliged to offer an ‘asham sacrifice in expiation….God accepts the\n  expiation even of one who swears falsely in His name because the\n  guilty person is willing to make restitution to the victim of his\n  crime. 224 – Brown, Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus, Volume 2,\n  Theological Objections, p. 128</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As codified and explained by Maimonides almost one thousand years later (Laws of Repentance, 1:2): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since the goat sent [to Azazeil] 229 atones for all of Israel, the\n  High Priest confesses on it as the spokesman for all Israel, as [Lev.\n  16:21] states: “He shall confess on it all the sins of the Children of\n  Israel.” The goat sent to Azazeil atones for all the transgressions in\n  the Torah, the severe and the lighter [sins]; those violated\n  intentionally and those transgressed inadvertently; those which [the\n  transgressor] became conscious of and those which he was not conscious\n  of. All are atoned for by the goat sent [to Azazeil]. This applies\n  only if one repents. If one does not repent, the goat only atones for\n  the light [sins]. Which are light sins and which are severe ones?\n  Severe sins are those which are punishable by execution by the court\n  or by premature death [karet]. [The violation of] the other\n  prohibitions that are not punishable by premature death are considered\n  light [sins]. 230 – Brown, Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus,\n  Volume 2, Theological Objections, p. 130</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>for more sources and details see <a href=\"http://www.biblestudying.net/rabbinic1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.biblestudying.net/rabbinic1.html</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Lev (16:5, 16) Since the goat sent [to Azazel] atones for all of Israel, the High Priest confesses upon it as a spokesman for all of Israel as [Leviticus 16:21] states: \"He shall confess upon it all the sins of the children of Israel.\"</p>\n\n<p>The goat sent to Azazel atones for all the transgressions in the Torah, the severe and the lighter [sins]; those violated intentionally and those transgressed inadvertently; those which [the transgressor] became conscious of and those which he was not conscious of.

This last leniency is particularly relevant to those ovens that are equipped with a pilot light that a Jew lit. In such a situation, when the non-Jew turns on the fire he is lighting the fire from a fire lit by a Jew.

He gave me two viewpoints:</p>\n\n<p>1 - Many health inspectors have egos. Sometimes, they cite things for violations that aren't actually there. Even if they do not want to wield their power, there are nuances between the itemized list that they must check on the violations sheet, and what actually exists. E.g. - the store owner was cited for not having cleaned his deep fryer. Of course not! The inspector came in the middle of the day while he was using the fryer.</p>\n\n<p>2 - The hashgacha agency's responsibility is to supervise the kashrut only. If they were to look for health violations, that could detract from their focus on teh kashrut. The owner explained, \"If your job is to analyze computer programs, would you want your boss asking you to do accounting, as well? It would detract from your computer analysis efforts.\"</p>\n\n<p>I am willing to accept this store owner's analysis as the answer as to why mashgichim don't revoke hashgachot based on health violations. This does not mean that I tolerate the problems that, inevitably, can occur with this system.

    "content": "# Are seemingly hashkafik texts like Pirkei Avot and Rambam Hilchot Deot halachikly binding?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A surface read of Pirkei Avot and Hilchot De'ot would suggest that their contents appears to be primarily advice as to how one <em>should</em> proceed over and above the minimal halachik requirements. Nonetheless, these two respective works are codified among primarily halachik series, the Mishna and Mishna Torah respectively. </p>\n\n<p>Do the instructions provided in these two volumes (and other volumes that fit my aforementioned criteria) contain halachik weight for anyone or everyone? Are they codes to teach us how to behave should we wish to go beyond the letter of the law? Are they simply there to enrich our lives?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The first Mishna in Pirkei Avot deals with the chain of Mesorah, how the Torah was passed down from generation to generation, starting with Moshe at Sinai. Rav Ovadiah MiBartenura asks what's the relevance of this Mishnah to the rest of the tractate, which seemingly deals with ethics? He answers that this Mishnah was given as an introduction to let us know that even these seemingly 'ethical' commandments were also given at Sinai, and as such must be treated just like any other commandment given at Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, your question is asking if these volumes 'contain halachik weight'. The short answer is yes, just like any other part of the Mishnah or Mishnah Torah. However, just like we don't conclusively rule Halachah directly from a Mishnah, we also don't conclusively rule 'ethical Halachah' directly from Pirkei Avot.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rambam Hilchos De'os is halachikally binding except where the Rambam specifically states that it is limited to a Talmid Chacham (e.g. chapter 5). Hilchos De'os contains the specification of no less than 11 Biblical mitzvos including the prohibitions against revenge and lashon hara and these commandments are certainly obligatory.</p>\n\n<p>The portions that deal with treating others properly like greeting others  pleasantly (sever panim yafos) are included in the mitzvah of emulating Hashem and are also binding. See 1:5 where this is explicitly stated by Rambam.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Pirkei Avos, in general, applies to everyone; note that the Ein Mishpat (found in Vilna Shas end of Maseches Avodah Zara) has numerous footnotes citing the passages in Rambam and Shulachan Aruch that are based on the referenced mishna. In addition, in many Halachic contexts Tosfos on the Gemara (e.g. Rosh Hashana 4a s.v. Beshvil) raises questions from Avos (but also see Tosfos Yom Tov ibid and rambam end of hilchos teshuvah) who clearly maintain that this is not required but is certainly optimal). (Of course, some mishnayos in Avos were intended for Talmidei Chachamim e.g. 1:1 Shimon Hatazdik etc) Some mishnayos are intended as not required advice (). One has to see how the Poskim (e.g. Rambam, Shulchan Aruch, etc) understood those comments to determine if they are binding or simply advice.(e.g. Avos 1:5 \"al tarbeh sichhah\" and Rambam Hulchos De'os 5:4)</p>\n\n<p>Your question is similar to the one raised by the Chofetz Chaim in his introduction to that sefer where he asks whether Rabenu Yonah's Shaarei Teshuva is halachically binding. Chofetz Chaim clearly understands that Rambam in Hilchos De'os is binding as he quotes from it extensively throughout his sefer. As a matter of fact, the issur for lashon hara is found in Hilchos De'os!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>the torah is written in a universal form so that every Jew is able to fulfill it.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, G-d's intent is that those who can do more should strive to. This is known as the urge of the understanding.</p>\n\n<p>The prescriptions in Pirkei Avot are in this category.</p>\n\n<p>Most people are not able to fulfill all the words of pirkei avot, so it is not to be looked as 100% halachically binding. Nevertheless everyone at his level of understanding must try to fulfill whatever he can.</p>\n\n<p>This is explained in the Chovos Halevavos, Gate 3 ch.3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Third, the intellectual urge cannot include equally all who are under\n  the obligation of service, because some human beings are of limited\n  intelligence, while some are superior in understanding. But the urge\n  of the Torah applies equally to all who have reached the status\n  subjecting them to this service, even though they vary in their\n  understanding of it, as we have noted at the close of the first\n  treatise of this book.</p>\n  \n  <p>It sometimes also happens that an individual falls short in some\n  duties and exceeds in others. The intellectual stimulus varies in\n  different individuals in accordance with their capacity of\n  recognition. But the urge of the Torah is not subject to variation.\n  Its form is the same for the child, the youth, one advanced in years\n  and the old man, the wise and the foolish, even though the resulting\n  practice varies in different classes of individuals. And so Scripture\n  says in regard to the all encompassing character of the instruction of\n  the Torah for all the people, \"Gather the people together, men and\n  women, and children, and the stranger that is within your gate, (that\n  they may hear and that they may learn and fear the L-ord your G-d . .\n  .)\" (Devarim 31:12). Further, it is said, \". . . you shall read this\n  law before all Israel in their hearing.\" (Devarim 31:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As one example, cabbage is usually eaten raw only when it is mixed with mayo, as in cole slaw, or other dressings as in red cabbage salad. I would assume, then, that you would say \"ha'admah\". (Let's assume the coleslaw has no carrots or other veggies, so the adamah is not for the carrots.) So, if I eat a plain piece of raw cabbage, should I say \"ha'admah\" as well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 202:16 reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On dried pepper and ginger… and anything that, like them, is not eaten except in a mixture, one says no <em>b'racha</em> at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>However</strong>, this seems not to be quite as broad in practice as it sounds. <em>Mishna B'rura</em> :79, for example, notes that the no-<em>b'racha</em> on dried pepper and ginger is because \"there's no pleasure from them at all\". In contrast, <em>SA</em> 204:1 includes plain salt as something a <em>b'racha</em> is said on (<em>Mishna B'rura</em> there says it's \"because one has a bit of pleasure\"), and <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 204:24 includes some vinegars.</p>\n\n<p>Those are some sources. For a practical ruling, as always, consult your rabbi.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It might be possible to infer this from the wording of the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.205.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Berura 205 (1) [4]</a> where he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלאטי\"ן מעורב עם שמן וחומץ בפה\"א אף בחיין. </p>\n  \n  <p>Lettuce mixed with oil and vinegar takes the blessing “borei pri\n  ha'adamah\" even when the lettuce is raw.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the MB says that the blessing \"ha'adamah\" applies when it is mixed with  oil and vinegar, we might deduce that if it is not so mixed, that blessing does not apply. </p>\n\n<p>A possible objection to this view might come from the fact that the bitter herbs eaten at the Passover Seder needs the blessing \"ha'adamah\".  Those who use lettuce for moror (as recommended by the Shulchan Oruch) do not eat it with oil and vinegar!</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14165&st=&pgnum=170&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beer Heiteiv in 475 (2) {12}</a> speaks about whether to make a blessing \"ha'adamah\" on moror which is not normally eaten raw. The Mogein Avrohom would not make a blessing \"ha'adamah\" and the ח״י says that on all moror we do make the blessing \"ha'adamah\". </p>\n\n<p>The moror is eaten after dipping it in charoses (and shaking the charoses off). So we might say that because of this it gets the blessing \"ha'adamah\". Or maybe not. </p>\n\n<p>On balance, IMHO, it is reasonable to say that if the vegetable is never eaten raw except when it is in a salad, then when eating it plain it should take the blessing “shehakol”.

They are not normally eaten by themselves - at the very least they are together with honey (ie sesame bars), and the brocha is haadama in such a case (unless they become tafel to something else). Yet, they still 'retain' the bracha of haadama even in the unusual case of being eaten by themselves (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/75360/what-bracha-should-one-make-when-eating-raw-sesame-seeds\">What bracha should one make when eating raw sesame seeds?</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

We finished our individual Shmoneh Esreh, when the 10th person appeared.

Certainly the preferable mode of reading from the Torah is during davening but the mitzvah lasts all day and when a minyan is available they should read from Torah. (Mishne Berurah 135:1, Shaar Hatziyun 3 and Aruch Hashulchan 135:6,7, Dagul Mervavah, Mahari Asad 58. However, some maintain that if mincha time has arrived, the Torah should not be read. See Mikraei Kodesh (Grodzinsky), Klal 13:5 and Shaarei Kedusha 10,11)</p>\n\n<p>Years ago I spent my afternoons in a kosher slaughterhouse and the shochtim started working before sunrise and continued until noon with breaks after their hourly shifts. They were unable to form a minyan when they davened Shachris but, during lunch hour, when all the shochtim were off duty and could form a minyan, they read from the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I checked with my LOR and he said that if someone makes the minyon after everyone else has davened, he can say borchu, shmoneh esrai with haiche kedusha, and the minyon can lain. The reason for this is that since a minyon is present, he can daven with what must be said in the presence of a minyon even though nobody else is davening. I am deliberately not dealing with duchening (for those whose minhag is to duchen every day) as I do not have the sources available or the time to go into it. My LOR did not discuss that case. The main question is leining if the tenth person comes after everyone else has finished davening (especially Shabbos Mincha when shmoneh esrai follows leining). Duchening does not apply for Shabbos Mincha in any case.</p>\n\n<p>Logic might seem to indicate that if everyone else can stay and no kohen has had kiddush (which would prevent the kohanim from duchening) then the kohanim should be able to go in front of the aron and duchen (during Shacharis). However, this is logic only based on the idea that a kohen who has davened already can duchen at a different minyon. I have not seen this explicitly in the various sources that I have read, but I have not seen anything to refute it either. This is the same logic that allows the Torah to be read at a separate time.</p>\n\n\n",

Accordingly, the Rav zt\"l was\n  absolutely adamant regarding the ban on attending an intermarriage.\n  Often we try to rationalize and justify attendance of such weddings.\n  We reason that if the Jewish partner comes from an assimilated\n  background and was never exposed to Yahadus, what right do we have to\n  judge him/her and boycott the wedding. Why should a ba'al teshuva\n  strain family relations by absenting himself/herself from a sibling's\n  wedding? After all, it is not the sibling's fault.</p>\n  \n  <p>But, of course, that line of reasoning is fallacious. In refusing to\n  attend an intermarriage we are not judging another individual. Only\n  the Rebbono Shel Olam can pass judgment on one's liability, and to\n  what extent extenuating circumstances should be taken into account.\n  But although we refrain from judging individuals and affixing\n  individual liability in such cases, we can and must judge actions and\n  courses of action. Unquestionably, intermarriage is anathema because\n  it destroys Jewish identity and destiny. Accordingly, it is nothing\n  less than a chilul Hashem to be present at such a marriage. One can\n  not attend a wedding as a conscientious objector. By attending, one eo\n  ipso joins in celebrating. A Jew can not under any circumstances\n  celebrate the partial destruction of Jewish identity.</p>\n  \n  <p>With this same compelling line of reasoning in mind, the Rav was also\n  equally adamant that subsequent to the wedding intermarried \"couples\"\n  must not be included in family gatherings or invited to family\n  semachos, and the like. Inviting the couple as such eo ipso\n  acknowledges and accepts their illicit marriage. Under no\n  circumstances may this acceptance be forthcoming. Let us not delude\n  ourselves into thinking that we would be simply maintaining relations\n  for purposes of kiruv. To the contrary, we are being m'sa'yai'a yedei\n  ovrei aveira, strengthening the hands of those living in sin and\n  creating a chilul Hashem.</p>\n  \n  <p>May Hakadosh Baruch Hu save us from nisyonos and guide us all along\n  His path of Torah u'mitzvos.</p>\n  \n  <p>Copyright © 2003 by The TorahWeb Foundation.

There is also an interesting opinion (Ramban) that while it's wrong either way, there is more of a sense of outrage when a Jewish man marries out than a Jewish woman, as at least in the latter case the children will still be Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>However generally speaking, there is a prohibition of <em>chanufah</em>, endorsing a prohibited action. If a gangster walks up to you and says \"I'm a nice guy, right?\", answering in the [very frightened] affirmative isn't endorsing one particular action per se. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein discusses giving synagogue honors to a sinner -- we're not condoning or endorsing any particular action of theirs. But attending an engagement party (or wedding) for an intermarriage really, really looks and sounds like you are offering your endorsement regarding a specific prohibited act. </p>\n\n<p>As always, ask your rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

Since they were speaking about this matter, it is not\nnecessary for him to be explicit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this halacha, as @DoubleAA pointed out it seems that as long as the context is one of marriage, we do not require an explicit declaration. This Rambam, however, might also be understood to mean that the speaking about the context in such a way that she acquiesces to his proposal replaces the formulation. This would explain why the Rambam groups the halacha with the idea of what constitutes a proposal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש לאיש לקדש האשה בכל לשון שהיא מכרת בו. ויהיה משמע הדברים באותה\nהלשון שקנאה כמו שביארנו.\nA man may consecrate a woman by making statements in any language that she understands, provided that, in that language, his statements mean that he is acquiring her, as explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have no proof that the Rambam requires their to be an actual acquiescence at the time of receiving the ring, but struggle to understand the 2nd and 6th halachot any other way. As such, it seems to me that even in the context of the wedding, until the bride actually acquiesces verbally, as the Rambam writes ורצתה, the marriage is incomplete. Unfortunately, this answer is mostly pilpul, and should most certainly not be relied on for any practical purposes (even more so than usual).</p>\n<p>The witnesses are also vital to the process and without them the marriage is problematic.

Taz (Y.D. 242:14), however, does quote this as the halacha. His father in law, the Bach (Y.D. 242:6) seems to believe that while such a practice is appropriate, it is not an absolute requirement, and therefore if one is having an extended conversation with one's teacher, the second person may be used after the first time the teacher is addressed.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, as noted in the comments, many languages, including German (and to some extent, Spanish, Portuguese, and Swedish) have an 'honorific' grammatical form which makes use of the third person even when the subject is being addressed directly. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction\">The Wikipedia article on the subject</a> includes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Hebrew\">Hebrew as an example</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Also the term \"six barley\" indicates a specific formal gift showing that he intended to marry her but only if it could be done fully legally as a \"redeemer\".

They responded that G-d was surely capable of saving them, but they didn't know if He would, and were prepared to sacrifice themselves regardless, rather than desecrate His Name. – Rashi</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another example is Avraham and his brother. Avraham was saved and his brother was not. There are commentators who say that Haran waited to see what happened to Avraham and when Avraham was saved he declared that he was ready to give up his life (without the expectation of being saved) for what Avraham had proved true. Haran was then thrown into the furnace and died.</p>\n<p>Nachshon ben Aminadav jumped into the sea when Hashem told the Bnei Yisrael to enter it without the expectation of (he himself) being saved.

    "content": "# What is a Literal Translation of Asher Yatzar?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have two similar English translations of Asher Yatzar. They both have something to the effect of \"many orifices and cavities.\" However, the Hebrew for these two is ,נקבים נקבים חלולים חלולים. </p>\n\n<p>What is a literal translation of this and how can the same word mean both orifice and many and another mean cavity and many?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In English, we often double a word for emphasis or to indicate volume. (\"miles and miles\" means \"many miles\") The practice of lashon kaful (doubling of language) is not limited to this prayer but is often found in biblical text on the level of the word (shamo'a tishma) and the phrase (\"Vieileh Toldot Yitzchak Ben Avraham, Avraham Holid Et Yitzchak\") and is a literary device also found in Shakespeare (Hamlet: Words, words, words).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This form of writing is often found throughout the Torah. In your example, the word נקבים means orifices, and while literally when it's doubled it should read 'orifices orifices', when a word is repeated it's used to stress the previous word. In your example, which I believe would apply to all nouns, repeating the word means 'many of the [word in question]. (while I know there are example in the Torah of this, I can't find them this moment. If I find them later, I'll try to edit them in)</p>\n\n<p>Another use of stressing repeated words, which I think applies to verbs, means 'I will surely do [word in question]'. Some examples of this are (Genesis 18:10) \"שׁוֹב אָשׁוּב\", which literally should mean 'return I will return', but in reality means 'I will surely return', and (Genesis 37:8) \"הֲמָלֹךְ תִּמְלֹךְ\", literally means 'rule will you rule', but actually means 'shall you indeed rule'.</p>\n\n<p>This is also used with adjectives also, quite commonly used with the phrase \"מְאֹד מְאֹד\", which appears numerous times in the Torah, which literally means 'much much', yet simply stresses that it's a lot.</p>\n\n\n",

However, Calev is not mentioned. Some commentators connect Dovid being called Efrati with Miriam (Efrat) and say that one of her descendants married into the family (possibly a wife of Nachshon, Salmon, Oved, or Yishai)</p>\n<p>As an example, <a href=\"http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.com/2007/07/illegitimate-origins-of-king-davids.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Illegitimate Origins of King David's Dynasty</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud says (Sotah 11b) that because Miriam aided her mother Jochebed in saving the Jewish babies in Egypt, Miriam merited that King David's dynasty should descend from her. The proves that Miriam was a foremother to King David by explaining that Miriam is called Efrat[23], after Caleb nursed her back to health following her deadly illness[24], and King David is known as an Efrati[25]. Rabbi Shmuel Eliezer Eidels (1555-1631) asks[26] that the lineage of King David is traced in the end of the book of Ruth (as mentioned above), yet neither Miriam nor her husband Caleb are listed as being ancestors of King David. Rabbi Eidels offers the possibility that Ram son of Chetzron, a great-grandson of Judah, was the same person as Caleb. However, he disproves such a possibility because Caleb was actually a brother of Ram, as is evident from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.2.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chronicles 1 2:9</a> which lists Yerachmiel, Ram, and Caleb–referred to there as \"Celuv\"—as the sons of Chetzron. Rabbi Eidels assumes that the Caleb referred to in that verse is identical with the Caleb who married Miriam, however this assumption is debatable[27], and so it is possible according to some explanations that Ram indeed is identical with Caleb and \"Celuv\" mentioned in the above-cited verse is another person. Rabbi Eidels concludes that since the family of Elimelech (the father of Machlon) is also called Efrati[28], it must be that Ram or one of his descendants (Aminadav or Nachshon) married a female descendant of Miriam and Caleb and the resulting offspring fathered the Davidic Dynasty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the sun \"Shemesh\" in hebrew\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand the word Shemesh comes from Shamash which means to serve. According to Jewish philosophy, why is the sun called a servant? Why is it more of a servant than the moon, or the wind, or even grass?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Zohar Chadash (Beraishis 518) states that the sun is so called because it 'serves' humanity and sustains all life - משמש את הכל. This is also quoted in the relatively obscure <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=midrash%20tadshe&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCgQFjAA&url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash_Tadshe&ei=YgptU7vQDbS2sASkwoGwCg&usg=AFQjCNHSWUQQ7KwC_qyd9UgR44wxV7XXeg&sig2=DBJC7e5ehwAZY5ua-JGaPA&bvm=bv.66111022,d.cWc\">Midrash Tadshe</a>, no. 20, and a similar reason is given by the Maharal (Chidushei Agados Nedarim 7b). I believe this theory better explains why the sun, as opposed to the stars or constellations, was given this name, as it literally does support all of life on earth more than any other astrological body. </p>\n\n<p>The theory that it needs to be emphasized that it's one of God's servants because people were wont to serve the sun (see Rambam Hil. Avodah Zarah 1:1) is one that I've heard as well, but cannot find a source for it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I had a nice thought, but of course no mekor, since I thought of it:\nThe sun is one of the most powerful forces that humans know of. Perhaps God knew that one day people would worship other forces in the world other than Him chas veshalom. He knew that the sun would be a prime candidate for such worshipping, because of it's tremendous force and clear beneficence to this world. Therefore, He gave it a name that contains the root \"servant\" in it to show very clearly that the sun is only a servant of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A personal theory: When Abraham grew up in Ur, he became familiar with the Babylonian myths. He rejected most of them along with the idols that his father made. But he kept some of the stories and names that he grew up with.</p>\n<p>Shamash was the <a href=\"https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Shamash\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akkadian name of the sun god</a>. In mythology, Shamash was the sun of the moon god Sin, and thus the sibling of the goddess Ishtar. In later Babylonian astral mythology, Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar formed a major triad of divinities, which still today plays an important role in astrological systems, though under different names: Moon, Sun and Venus.</p>\n<p>Whether because Abraham brought the name with him from Ur, or because of the linguistic connections between Akkadian and semitic languages generally, <em>Shemash</em> and Shamash are basically the same word for the same thing, except in Judaism the sun is just the sun, not a deity.</p>\n<p><em>Note: the following is speculative, but the linguistic connection is not.</em> In Canaanite myths, Shemesh appears several times as El's messenger. This could be a clue about why he is considered a servant. Also in the Babylonian myths, Shamesh is the son while Sin [the Moon] is the Father, so Shamash naturally takes the subordinate role. In Israelite tradition the moon was more important than the sun in terms of both festivals and the calendar. Finally, on the menorah, the Shamash is a sun-like candle that serves the others with its flame. About the grass: in science, the sun serves the grass, not vice versa.</p>\n\n\n",

If so, is God without wisdom before he created wisdom?</p>\n\n<p>Other Jewish texts ( though uninspired),also talks about God's wisdom as created by God.</p>\n\n<p>I want to know what is the interpretation of the Hellenistic Jews about Proverbs 8:22.Do these Jews believe that there is a point wherein God is not wise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The logic would appear to be that \"wisdom\" as something that exists within the universe and is knowable by human beings has to be a creation of Hashem. Since Hashem is outside the universe and basically not understandable and knowable by human beings, then \"wisdom\" as something within the universe has to be created just as the sun, the moon, the stars and the laws of the torah and of nature must be created. Similarly, the acquisition of knowledge means that after <strong>people</strong> acquire knowledge, they can then acquire wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>What the Hellenists might or might not understand about Hashem does not really matter in this respect. The Hellenist understanding of \"gods\" is more on the line of superpowerful people with magic powers (such as the Greek myths) rather than our understanding of what Hashem \"is\". In that respect, Hashem could have created such beings or people could have developed powers that later people thought made them \"gods\". Just as primitive people regarded the chiefs or shamans of the tribes (or like the Egyptians regarded Par'oh).</p>\n\n<p>This is actually from what I have learned about the pagan myths and the descriptions of the \"gods\" from the Greek, Norse, and other writings. A typical example would be the Iliad and the description of the actions of the \"gods\" in the original \"beauty\" contest that led to it.</p>\n\n<p>Of course more details of this would not really be appropriate for this site.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Explanations from חז״ל for Noah's ark?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Today, a very learned friend of mine and I were discussing the difficulty of the literal interpretation of Noah's ark. That is, we could not fathom how multiple samples of every animal on earth could have fit on a boat.</p>\n\n<p>We got very creative in our interpretation, but we still were forced to admit that it would have to have been an open miracle for it to work.</p>\n\n<p>We were also surprised to realize that neither of us could remember having ever heard of anything from חז״ל seeking to explain the phenomenon. We assume that they must have been aware of the vast number of animals in the world, even if they did not know to the extent we know today just how vast that number actually is, and they must have also known that such a large number would be impossible under normal circumstances to fit under one roof, however large, not even accounting for food and waste.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any sources in חז״ל that attempt to address this difficulty?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Ramban deals with this and points out that it must be a miracle. <a href=\"http://www.tfdixie.com/parshat/noach/006.htm\">A WHOLE NEW WORLD</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.webyeshiva.org/ramban-on-the-torah-the-ark%E2%80%99s-size/\">Ramban on the Torah: The Ark’s Size</a> both show the explanation of this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God’s Instructions to Noah outline the ark’s dimensions: three hundred amot long, fifty amot wide and thirty amot high (Bereishit 6:15). Ramban (commentary on 6:19) notes that such a structure can not possibly hold the various items Noah brought aboard the ark. The animal kingdom includes a vast array of different species, some of considerable size. A pair from every species takes up an immense amount of space. Add a year’s supply of food for all those creatures and the ark as described will simply not do. Ramban explains that a miracle enabled the vessel to contain all things needed.</p>\n  \n  <p>If the ark’s mission depended upon a miracle, why did God make Noah\n  dedicate considerable effort to building such a larger structure?\n  Expand the miracle a bit and Noah need not work nearly as hard. Ramban\n  explains that God wanted Noah’s contemporaries to notice his efforts,\n  ask Noah about them, and learn about the impending deluge. Perhaps\n  they will repent. This idea has particular resonance in light of\n  Chazal’s portrayal of Noah as someone who did not try to save others\n  from calamity, in sharp contrast to Avraham who prays for Sodom.\n  According to Rambam, God set up such a role for Noah but Noah was\n  unable to achieve this goal.</p>\n  \n  <p>Ramban also suggests a different answer. The Torah prefers to minimize\n  the miraculous and demand mankind’s maximum input. Even when God must\n  bend the laws of nature to ensure the world’s survival, He still asks\n  that man give his utmost towards that goal.</p>\n  \n  <p>This point has significant implications. Many think of Ramban as a\n  rabbinic authority who emphasizes the miraculous component within\n  Judaism. Ramban’s analysis of the ark clarifies that he rejects a\n  notion of divine involvement which lessens the need for human effort\n  and initiative. God did not create world in which He miraculously\n  provides for all our needs. Rather, He created a world in which human\n  striving, sometimes enhanced by divine aid, can achieve amazing\n  results.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rambam teaches a dual message about righteousness.

Avimi, son of Rabbi Abbahu, taught: There are seven hundred types of non-kosher fish, and eight hundred types of non-kosher grasshopper, and there are countless birds. The Gemara protests: Are there countless non-kosher birds? But there are only twenty-four non-kosher birds mentioned in the Torah. Rather, Avimi must have meant: And there are countless kosher birds.” There is something called שורשי המינים, the primary type of animal, and that animal changed into different types of that animal after it left the teivah into many places of the world (a micro-evolution type thing).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'd like to argue that your assumption is not quite correct, namely, that Chazal <em>were not</em> aware of the vast number of animals in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Start by observing that animals whose habitat is outside of the near east were not known to Chazal as is evidenced by the known statements regarding the uniqueness of the non-kosher animals:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שליט בעולמו יודע שאין לך דבר מעלה גרה וטמא אלא גמל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In trying to estimate the number of animals known in the near east at the time, one could use Aristotle's classification of animals, which contained less than 600 species, of which quite a number were fish and other marine animals. </p>\n\n<p>If this is indeed representative, it would mean that only a few hundred animals (in Chazal's view) had to fit on the ark, a plausible number given the size of the ark described in Genesis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As late as the 1771 edition of Britannica, the entry on Noah's Ark contained the following: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...the number of species of animals will be found much less than is\n  generally imagined not amounting to a hundred species of quadrupeds\n  nor to two hundred of birds...

In explaining R' Yehuda's opinion, Kehati elaborates upon the nature of halakhic hours (being equal divisions of the day-time, rather than fixed units of time) and brings an example that commences as follows:</p>\n\n<p>למשל אם נקח יום מימי תמוז הארוכים, וכגון שעלה בו השחר ב-2 לפי שעוננו וזמן צאת הכוכבים היה ב-8, דהיינו שארכו של יום זה 18 שעות, נמצאת השעה הזמנית של אותו יום שעה ומחצה לפי שעוננו</p>\n\n<p>My paraphrastic translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By way of an example, if we were to take a day from the month of\n  Tammuz (in which the days are longer), in which the sun comes up at\n  2:00 by our watches and the stars come out at 8:00pm, then the length\n  of such a day would be 18 hours and an halakhic hour would be found to\n  be 1.5 hours in length (by our reckoning).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no problem with the calculation. What I do have a problem with is the assertion that the sun <em>ever</em>, anywhere, comes up at 2:00 in the morning.

Rabbah: All know for what purpose a bride enters the\nbridal canopy, yet against whomsoever who speaks obscenely [thereof],\neven if a sentence of seventy years' happiness had been sealed for\nhim, it is reversed for evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In light of the above, may one discuss explicit matters concerning sexual conduct in a public web forum like Mi Yodeya?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Please note that the following answer is not a halachik ruling and should not be read as such. It is a theoretical answer that explores the issue, examining the relevant issues.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to the Gemara in Shabbat 33a, it seems clear that the context of discouraging sexual discussion is only when it is done in banter and tastelessly. When it is done for the sake of Torah, it seems clear that the restriction of Nivul Peh would not apply. As such this would be no reason to prohibit discussions of this nature.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to the Mishna in Chagiga, the Rambam rules in Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah 22:17:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין דורשין בסתרי עריות בשלשה מפני שהאחד טרוד בשאלת הרב והשנים נושאין ונותנין זה עם זה ואין דעתם פנויה לשמוע שדעתו של אדם קרובה אצל עריות אם נסתפק לו דבר ששמע מורה להקל לפיכך אין דורשין אלא לשנים כדי שיהיה האחד השומע מפנה דעתו ויודע מה שישמע מן הרב.</p>\n  \n  <p>We do not relate the hidden matters concerning forbidden sexual\n  conduct to three students. [The rationale is that] one will be\n  absorbed in questioning the teacher, the other two will be debating\n  the matter back and forth and will not be free to listen. Since a\n  person's mind is aroused by sexual matters, if a doubt arises\n  concerning something he heard, he may [in error] rule leniently.\n  Therefore, we teach only to two. In this manner, the one listening\n  will focus his attention and recall what he will hear from the\n  teacher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This halacha indicates that the reason one may not relate these hidden matters to a small crowd is because when the teacher teaches, listeners might be so involved in their own discussions that they might miss something critical and rule leniently.</p>\n\n<p>Given the detail of Even Ha'ezer, Rambam Issurei Bi'ah and so many of our other critical sources, it seems that we are not worried about a student misreading something in a text written regarding the relevant laws. A forum like Mi Yodeya has the same advantage as a text, that since all the content is organized on the page, if one has a doubt, he could simply re-read more carefully.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, when the forum is abundantly clear that its mission is not to provide halachik rulings, and that none of its content should be taken as such, we should potentially not be worried that he will act without consulting a qualified rabbinic authority. (Unfortunately, one never knows who is relying on Mi Yodeya for halachik rulings, but this is a problem that applies to all halachik questions equally, even those of a non-sexual nature.)</p>\n\n<p>For these two reasons it seems to me that such discussions should be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, in <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/1982/1053/735664.pdf\">this journal article</a> Rav Hershel Shachter quotes Rav Moshe Feinstein as to broadening the definition of Arayot to include family planning and similar matters. In doing so, he prohibits discussing these matters in journals available to the public. Nonetheless, Rav Shachter writes that many of these articles have been published nonetheless, and that he published this essay of family planning on the insistence of several gedolim.</p>\n\n<p>In Igrot Moshe Even Ha'ezer 1:64, in his introduction, Rav Moshe Feinstein asserts that in this society, people are searching for any justification to be lenient in matters like family planning where people's emotions and desires overtake them. As such, he recommends viewing matters like these in the same light as forbidden sexual conduct as prohibited by the Mishna in Chagiga and in the Rambam in Issurei Bi'ah.</p>\n\n<p>He asserts shock at seeing such a strict matter appear in a monthly journal. He defends the publishing of Teshuvot about such matters on the basis that only wise sages who wish to clarify the truth of the halacha read these Teshuvot. Monthly journals, and to my mind certainly web forums like Mi Yodeya, are read by average folk who do not have the necessary fear of heaven to read these publications with the necessary fear of heaven.</p>\n\n<p>I have two primary objections to the line of logic taken by Rav Moshe Feinstein:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>These matters have appeared in many codes of Jewish law that have been accessible to the public for a long time, and not simply obscure Teshuvot. They have been discussed in regular halachic codes such as the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch in graphic detail.</li>\n<li>Neither the Rambam nor Shulchan Aruch describe written accounts of\nArayot to be prohibited. One has to ask why this is, if not for the fact that they are not worried about the mishna in Chagiga unless the discussion is a face to face discussion.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is also important to note that despite acknowledging and sympathizing with Rav Moshe Feinstein's position, Rav Shachter did in fact write a journal article intended for the public forum.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, in deference to Rav Shachter and Rav Moshe Feinstein, I cannot at this point encourage discussing Torah of this sort on websites like Mi Yodeya which are accessible to the public at large.</p>\n\n\n",

When I looked up the Rif in Shabbat, his commentary ended a daf before 68B.

What is wrong if the true God  as well as some other person\\Object is worshipped along with him as long as he is not leaving the worship of the God of Israel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You make it sound like somebody declared idolatry to be a cardinal sin.</p>\n\n<p>But it was G-d Himself who declared so - nobody made up the rules, we got them from G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the first 2 of the 10 commandments are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>To believe that only He runs the world (so it makes no sense to worship anything else)</li>\n<li>One may not worship anything else besides for G-d Himself.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>By worshiping anything else you are trying to degrade the Uniqueness and Power of G-d, by equating him - at some level - to the other item(s) you worship. This is affront to G-d which He declares (in the 10 commandments) that he will punish severely.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The reason God considers it a capital offense is because it is incompatible with Judaism. i.e. Once you start worshipping other than God, the foundations of torah observance falls apart. You now have several masters. You cannot fully place your trust and hopes in God and therefore cannot worship Him properly </p>\n\n<p>Here's a quote from the shaar yichud of chovos halevavos (start of intro)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After investigating after what is the most necessary of the\n  cornerstones and fundamentals of our religion, we found that the\n  wholehearted acceptance of the unity of G-d is the root and foundation\n  of Judaism. It is the first of the gates of the torah, and it\n  differentiates between the believer and the heretic. It is the head\n  and front of religious truth, and one who strays from it - will not be\n  able to perform religious deeds and his faith will not endure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even so, some sins are actually worse than idolatry but are nevertheless not capital offenses. Being hypocritical in one's service is in some sense worse, but at least it is not totally incompatible with Judaism. You have to start somewhere. Here's a quote on this from Chovos Halevavos gate 5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Similarly we can say for the idol worshipper, that ignorance of G-d is\n  what brings him to this (he hopes to get benefit or protection from\n  the idol). However, the idol worshipper is to be preferred over the\n  flatterer (hypocrite) in the following four ways:</p>\n  \n  <p>(1) In our times, there are no prophets which can perform miracles to\n  clarify to the idol worshipper his faulty outlook, but the flatterer\n  in G-d's torah (who performs the service of G-d to impress people, as\n  above), there are grounds for a claim against him, since he undertook\n  the commandments to serve G-d alone and undertook the prohibitions not\n  to serve someone else (than G-d).</p>\n  \n  <p>(2) The idolater worships something which does not rebel against G-d\n  (sun, moon, stars), but the flatterer in G-d's torah worships a human\n  being who rebels against G-d as well as one who does not rebel against\n  Him.</p>\n  \n  <p>(3) The idolater worships one thing alone, whereas for the flatterer,\n  there is no limit to those he worships.</p>\n  \n  <p>(4) The idolater's status is visible for all to see, and people guard\n  themselves from him due to public knowledge of his denial of G-d's\n  existence. But the flatterer's denial is not visible, and people trust\n  in him, therefore he is more likely to damage them (influence them\n  with his false beliefs) than the idol worshipper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One can apply the same idea to explain the capital punishment incurred for adultery or incest. These things are incompatible with a torah society and if left to go rampant will irreparably ruin it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To make the question stronger, the Rambam writes (Hilchos Akum 2:1) that the primary belief of idolaters was/is that G-d is in charge and the idolatry gets its power from Him.  So, if we still believe that G-d is the Boss, what's the problem?</p>\n\n<p>I once heard an explanation that the problem is that if you have an intermediary, all you will care about is what the intermediary wants.  If there is someone \"directly\" in charge of you, you won't care about what the \"superior officer\" orders, as long as the entity you are dealing with is happy.  So you essentially sever your relationship with G-d by relating to some other entity as having jurisdiction over you.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, a baby under the age of three could never become divorced as she can not accept a get and understand the entire matter just like a shoteh. See the Rambam on the halachos of marriage of a ketana and that a ketana leaves by miun (refusal) and not divorce. Thus, she could never have been divorced until she is an adult (above bas mitzvah).</strike> </p>\n\n<p>I had remembered the Rambam incorrectly. Rambam Sefer Nashim Hilchos Geirishin (divorce) Perek 2 Halachos 18, 19</p>\n\n<p>18:\nIf the father married off an underage daughter and she was divorced while still a ketana, the father accepts the get on her behalf and when the get \"reaches his hand\" she is divorced. If she is divorced while she is a na'arah, whether the get \"reaches her hand or her father's hand\" she is divorced. A na'arah who is betrothed cannot become a shaliach to accept her get from her husband while her father is still alive. However, the father can become a shaliach to accept the get for his daughter who is betrothed whether she is a ketana or a na'arah.</p>\n\n<p>19:\nIf her father married her off while she was a ketanah and then died. If she can tell the difference between the get and something else she is divorced as soon as it comes into her hands and if not, she is not divorced until she is capable of distinguishing, and if she was divorced (received a get while too young) she is not divorced.</p>\n\n<p>Thus if the father is available to receive the get while the daughter is under three, she is divorced and asur to marry a cohen even if she is still a besulah. If the father died while she is still too young to accept a get and know what is happening, then she must wait until she is old enough to understand the entire concept of divorce and what the get is.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam speaks of the halacha of miun in Hilchos Ishus Perek 4 Halachos 7, and 8. If a ketanah is an orphan or the father no longer has the authority to marry her off (because he has already done so and she was divorced or widowed) then she must be old enough to have the daas to accept the marriage. Betwee the ages of 6 - 10, we test her to see if she is mature enough to understand what is happening. If she is, then she is married but can \"refuse\" when she becomes a na'arah and cancel the marriage (as he explains in Hilchos Geirishin). She must state in front of two witnesses that she refuses to stay with the husband and she leaves without requiring a get. The reason for this is that the marriage was not a \"complete marriage\" from the Torah but only through \"divrei sofrim\" (rabbinical decree) which is only valid if she stays with the husband after she becomes a gedolah and they \"finalize\" the marriage completely. They do not require getting \"married\" once she is adult but if she does not want to stay married to him she must perform the refusal and leave without a get.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if the mother and brother marry her off after the father dies (and she is a ketana) she can leave with miun.</p>\n\n<p>Also if she ended the marriage by miun (refusal) then she is not a gerushah and it is as if she had never married. Miun occurs when she becomes a na'arah (12 - 12.5). Note that she would probably be asur to a kohen gadol as not a besulah even though she had \"never\" been married.</p>\n\n\n",

However, we know that, typically at least, a reform conversion process is not valid according to halacha. However, if such a person were to wish to become a full ba'alat teshuva, would s/he be able to be considered Jewish?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There is room to discuss the validity of most aspects of a Reform conversion - if the Mikvah was a kosher Mikvah, then that would be fine.  If the person had in mind to be responsible and accountable for mitzvos, even if they did not intend to keep them, then it would be a matter of dispute if that is valid, but it is possible.  The main problem is the attending Rabbis who are \"performing\" the conversion.  The halacha is that גר צריך שלשה כמשפט - a convert needs a court of 3 eligible \"overseers,\" as judgment does (Kiddushin 62b).  Whether this is necessary for the point of acceptance of Mitzvos or for the Mikvah immersion, it is definitively required at some point.  As your standard reform Rabbi is a public Sabbath desecrator, they are not valid even as witnesses, let alone as a standard of \"Judges.\"  Therefore, the conversion itself was flawed, and nothing done later can fix that original conversion which lacked a basic requirement.  There is, however, no reason that it could not be repeated now that she wishes to do it correctly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>If her mother's conversion was valid, then she is Jewish. If her mother's conversion was invalid, then she is not Jewish. That's all there is to it. She can proceed from there however she wants.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A Reform conversion is not considered valid, certainly not by Orthodox Jews, and in most cases not even by Conservative Judaism. (I saw Conservative Judaism, rather than Conservative Jews, since Conservative-affiliated Jews in many cases may have a more Reform view of halacha.) So to be considered Jewish by the general Jewish community, Orthodox conversion would be required. </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that a convert is not required to advertise the fact that he or she is a convert (though the matter should not be concealed if it is relevant, as in relationships with kohanim). So if someone is raised Jewish, later realizes they are not halachically Jewish and converts Orthodox, it is possible that the person could refer to (or think of) themselves as a ba'al teshuvah, rather than, or in addition to, being a ger (since in some sense s/he is both.) I mention this not because there is anything wrong with being a convert -- far from it -- but only because you mention the term ba'alat teshuvah.</p>\n\n\n",

This title evokes the verse (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2687.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>T'hillim</em> 87:2</a>): אהב יהוה שערי ציון מכל משכנות יעקב - \"The LORD loveth the <strong>gates of Zion</strong> more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\" However, R' Kramer intended to invest the title with multiple meanings. One meaning refers to the marking/documenting of sources that is the purpose of the book, as indicated by the description on the title page (\"בו יצוינו כל המקומות...\"; see fn. 2 below). Additionally, the title hints that the book should serve as a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35313&st=&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">memorial to R' Kramer's father</a> (\"ציון לנפש מר אבא\"). It is therefore unclear which pronunciation of the title R' Kramer would have preferred.</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>The name <em>Sha'ar HaTziyun</em> derives from the phrase \"sh'arim hamtzuyanim b'halacha\" (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=8&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'rachos</em> 8a</a>, אמר רב חסדא... אוהב ה' שערים המצויינים בהלכה יותר מבתי כנסיות ומבתי מדרשות), translated as \"gateways distinguished in (or marked in) Jewish Law.\" (This phrase in the Talmud involves a play on words from the verse in <em>T'hillim</em> mentioned in fn. 1 above). The Chafetz Chaim likely chose the title as a pun, hinting at the distinction of scholarship referenced in his work, but primarily referring to the function of Sha'ar HaTziyun in marking sources of <em>halacha</em>.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

The only thing special about it was that it produced water like a well, which lasted only as long as Miriam was alive.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, it wasn't the rock of Miriam, since she had nothing to do with it being a rock. It is the well of Miriam, since she caused it to be a well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Bamidbar 21 it's referred to as a well, multiple times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טז וּמִשָּׁם, בְּאֵרָה:  הִוא <strong>הַבְּאֵר</strong>, אֲשֶׁר אָמַר יְהוָה לְמֹשֶׁה, אֱסֹף אֶת-הָעָם, וְאֶתְּנָה לָהֶם מָיִם.   יז אָז יָשִׁיר יִשְׂרָאֵל, אֶת-הַשִּׁירָה הַזֹּאת:  עֲלִי <strong>בְאֵר</strong>, עֱנוּ-לָהּ.  יח <strong>בְּאֵר</strong> חֲפָרוּהָ שָׂרִים, כָּרוּהָ נְדִיבֵי הָעָם, בִּמְחֹקֵק, בְּמִשְׁעֲנֹתָם; וּמִמִּדְבָּר, מַתָּנָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My guess is that as a result it's called the Well of Miriam, though the Ibn Ezra on that Pasuk says that it does not refer to Be'er Miriam.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזאת הבאר גם היא היתה פלא ואיננה הבאר הנקרא באר מרים לפי דעתי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Perhaps because it wasn't just a rock - first and foremost it served the function of a well.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.9a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 9b</a> clearly states that it was brought in Miriam's merit and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.9a.9?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> writes over there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...בארה של מרים - סלע וזבין ממנו מים והיה מתגלגל והולך עם ישראל</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Well of Miriam</strong></em> - <em>a rock and water flowed from it and it would roll and (lit.) go (i.e. travel) with the Jewish People.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem whilst it was indeed a rock, it was a miraculous feature within the Jewish peoples' existence in the desert.

As such, there are now a number of Swedish Jewish communities, the largest of which is in Stockholm. In mid-Summer, Stockholm can get over eighteen hours of sunlight a day, and in the middle of winter might receive as few as six. Looking at <a href=\"http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/Sweden-Facts/Worth-knowing-about-Sweden/Time--daylight-hours/\">this chart</a>, I see that in July the sun rises at 3:40am and doesn't set until 10:00pm, while in January it won't rise until it's almost 9:00am, and will set only a couple of hours into the afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Since the times at which various things can be done depend largely upon sunrise and sundown, how might a Jew in Stockholm conduct his day?</p>\n\n<p>If the sun has risen before one could reasonably have awoken, and will remain in the sky until after one has gone to bed, what might be the earliest and latest times at which a person could recite the Shema in the morning and the evening?

Or to determining the length of a fast day?</p>\n\n<p>If the sun has descended below the horizon only shortly after lunchtime, such that it's no longer possible to recognise things from a short distance, would the obligation of wearing tzitzit be affected? Would such an afternoon be considered \"nighttime\" in every respect, such as to prevent one from reciting qorbanot, or delivering judgment in the Bet Din?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As long as we stay well (Stockholm is 7°/800 km/500 mi) south* of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_circle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">polar circle</a>, there will always be a <em>sh'kia</em> and a <em>netz</em> . Therefore, all <em>zmanim</em> can be calculated. Even a <em>tzeis</em> and an <em>alos</em> can be calculated by relying on the opinion that they occur a fixed number of minutes* (e.g. 72) after <em>shkia</em> and before <em>tzeis</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take some practical examples:</p>\n\n<p>On <strong><em>shabbos korach</em></strong>, sunrise is at 3:31 and sunset at 10:08. This gives us until 7:34 to say <em>Sh'ma</em>, and <em>sh'mone esrei</em> has to be before 9:43. There is of course plenty of time for <em>mincha</em>, and <em>ma'ariv</em> could be said after <em>p'lag</em>, at 8:12, and then one could go to bed. The only real difficulty is waking up to repeat <em>sh'ma</em> after 11:21. <em>Havdallah</em> can be said then, or Sunday morning before breakfast, as <em>havdallah</em> over a cup of wine is only necessary before eating or drinking.</p>\n\n<p>On <strong><em>shivah asar b'tammuz</em></strong> sunrise is at 3:57 and sunset at 9:50. One may of course begin fasting the night before, or take a mid-night snack. The usually lenient opinions actually come out later than 72 minutes, so eating can certainly be resumed at 11:02. Obviously, one may go to sleep in the evening, and eat in the middle of the night or the next morning.</p>\n\n<p>For <strong><em>shabbos mikeitz</em></strong>, candles for <em>chanukah</em> and <em>shabbos</em> have to be lit before 2:30. Some choose to study before the meal, which also serves to push it off to a more normal hour. <em>Shacharis</em> can in fact be scheduled for a normal 8 o'clock the whole year, as <em>neitz</em> is 8:43. That <em>shabbes</em> is over at 4 o'clock should not pose any problems, but it is a good idea to limit the morning meal so that <em>shalos seudos</em> can be eaten in time. This gives an excellent opportunity to make <em>melave malka</em> something extra special!</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>winter weekdays</strong> pose special problems, as many have to begin work before the earliest chance for <em>shacharis</em>. Being that the situation is temporary, one can be lenient and pray between <em>misheyakir</em> and <em>neitz</em>. Relying on opinions that specify <em>alos</em> by the sun's angle under the horizon, <em>shacharis</em> can be over around 7 o'clock. Otherwise, one would have to take a \"tea\" break in the morning, just as is universally done for <em>mincha</em> in the afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>There are even more northern congregations, like Fairbanks in Alaska and Arkhangelsk in Russia, but their halachic times do not differ substantially. To my knowledge, the only permanent polar community is that of <a href=\"https://fjc.ru/centers/russia/murmansk/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Murmansk</a>, and I hope to add some information when I get a response from the local <em>Chabad sh'liach</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Since we keep <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/14180/3073\">both opinions</a> about <em>tzitzis</em>, this mitzva is not affected. Actual halachic processes in <em>batei din</em> are probably rare in these locations, but there are plenty of daylight hours available.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Experience – this is where I come from.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>* Everything here assumes that one chooses definitions so that (<em>tzeis</em> – <em>sh'kia</em>) + (<em>netz</em> – <em>alos</em>) > (<em>netz</em> – <em>tzeis</em>). E.g. if <em>tzeis</em> is 60 minuttes after <em>sh'kia</em> and <em>alos</em> is 72 minuttes before <em>netz</em>, then there must be at least 132 minutes between <em>sh'kia</em> and <em>netz</em>. This is the case for all locations well south of the polar circle.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# \"Masekhtot Banayikh\": The Origins of an Expression\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently found out that four of the masekhtot in the Bavli conclude with the same drosh by R' Elazar, and that those four masekhtot are known by a special name as a result. The drosh concerns the fact that Torah scholars bring peace to the word, and hinges on the pronunciation of the word בניך. The key part of the drosh is Isaiah 54:13 - particularly the phrase, ורב שלום בניך (\"great shall be the peace of your children\"). The four masekhtot are Berakhot, Yevamot, Nazir and Keritot.</p>\n\n<p>Although these four masekhtot are not the <em>only</em> masekhtot in which this drosh appears (it also appears in Tamid 32b), they <em>are</em> the only ones that conclude with this drosh, and were singled out by the Lubavitcher Rebbe in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadran_%28Talmud%29\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>hadran</em></a> that was delivered in 1980 and published in <em>Torat Menachem: Hadranim al-haRambam veShas</em> (1992).</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe referred to them as מסכתות בני״ך (Masekhtot Banayikh), the acronym standing for \"Berakhot, Nazir, Yevamot, Keritot\", and alluding to the word on which the drosh itself hinges.

Either that means that the Lubavitcher Rebbe invented it, or it means that it was so widely known that accreditation was unnecessary (and impossible). The Rebbe's <em>hadran</em> is based closely on a Maharsha on Yevamot 121b (the drosh is brought on 122b, but the Maharsha's remarks are on the previous daf), but the Maharsha himself doesn't use the expression.</p>\n\n<p>So: does anybody know of a source prior to the Lubavitcher Rebbe for this beautiful expression (\"Masekhtot Banayikh\") - or, alternatively, is there anybody who already knew that the Lubavitcher Rebbe invented it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It is brought in the name of the Vilna Gaon in the sefer Kol Eliyohu <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14227&st=&pgnum=68\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The notion that Tamid also concludes with the same ending was mentioned by a handful of authors.

    "content": "# Can someone who possibly already did a mitzva cover another such person with the b'racha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As codified in <em>Mishna B'rura</em> 592 and elsewhere, we allow someone who has already fulfilled a <em>mitzva</em> to exempt another in the <em>b'racha</em> recited for it — though we try to avoid it where feasible. For example, someone who has read or heard the <em>m'gila</em> (<em>Ester</em>) already can recite the <em>b'rachos</em> over the <em>m'gila</em> for someone else about to hear the <em>m'gila</em>, though we prefer the latter recite them instead. The same is true<sup> [citation needed]</sup> for a <em>b'racha</em> which <strong>is</strong> a <em>mitzva</em>, such as <em>kidush l'vana</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose someone, call him <em>R'uven</em>, is <strong>unsure</strong> whether he's fulfilled his obligation, say of reading <em>m'gila</em> or saying <em>kidush l'vana</em>. Then common practice is that he not recite the <em>b'rachos</em> himself but listen to another who is <strong>surely</strong> still obligated and fulfill his obligation that way. Now suppose <em>Shim'on</em> is also unsure whether he's fulfilled his obligation (and his doubt is independent of <em>R'uven</em>'s). Consider: There's uncertainty about <em>R'uven</em>'s obligation to recite the <em>b'racha</em>, and there's uncertainty about <em>Shim'on</em>'s; there's a double uncertainty (<em>s'fek s'feka</em>) whether <strong>both</strong> are not obligated to recite the <em>b'racha</em>, so we should be able to assume at least one <strong>is</strong> obligated. In that case, one of them should be able to recite the <em>b'racha</em> for the both of them, in accordance with the principle outlined in my first paragraph. (This, assuming there's no one around who is surely obligated and can say the <em>b'racha</em> for <em>R'uven</em> and <em>Shim'on</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>I wonder whether there's anything wrong with that argument, and whether any <em>pos'kim</em> have used or rejected it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Although in <em>Hilchos Sefiras Ha'Omer</em> we find that one makes a bracha based on a sfek sfaka (Mishne Berura 489:38), in general one may not rely on a sfek sfakah to make a bracha (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%98%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishne Berura 215:20</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Rav S.Z.

    "content": "# Are there any types of questions that Eliyahu (Elijah) cannot answer?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemarrah often lists disputes that end in \"Teiku\". I understood that this term was an acronym that meant that Eliyahu will eventually answer such questions and problems. Are there any types of questions mentioned in the Gemarrah or elsewhere that Eliyahu cannot answer? (Please don't say \"this one\", LOL :-)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Eliyahu HaNavi is found along the chain of the mesorah from Moshe Rabenu and received the entire tradition (Introduction To Mishne Torah) and as such would be capable of answering any Halachic question. (At this point in history there were no disagreement among scholars - בראשונה לא הייתה מחלוקת בישראל אלא על הסמיכה בלבד‏ -ירושלמי, חגיגה פרק ב דף עז.) It is implied by Mishna Eduyos (8:7 and commentaries) that Eliyahu will answer Halachic questions at the end of days and resolve all scholarly disputes (Raavad ibid and Shoshanim LeDovid (Fardo)).</p>\n\n<p>For non-Halachic matters, we find that no Navi (Eliyahu included) truly understood the nature of the reward in Olam Habah - only G-d knows it (Sandehrin 99a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי חייא בר אבא א\"ר יוחנן כל הנביאים כולן לא נתנבאו אלא לימות\n  המשיח אבל לעולם הבא (ישעיהו סד, ג) עין לא ראתה א---ם זולתך יעשה למחכה\n  לו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We now discuss some cases where Eliyahu HaNavi either would not be followed <em>if</em> he would issue a ruling on a matter or he would not act on some matter.</p>\n\n<p>It is tacitly implied that Eliyahu's authority is generally binding in Halacha since the Talmud writes that his opinion is followed except where it contradicts accepted Halachic practice </p>\n\n<p>ר' בא רב יהודה בשם רב אם יבא אליהו ויאמר שחולצין\n במנעל שומעין שלו.  שאין חולצין בסנדל אין שומעין לו.  שהרי הרבים נהגו לחלוץ בסנדל</p>\n\n<p>(Bavli Menacos 32a, Yerushami, Yevamos 12,1)</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna (Eduyos ח,ז) writes that Eliyahu will not not distance families that have already been accepted into the Jewish community. The Mishna does not say that he does not personally know those families. rather, he won't act on that knowledge.   </p>\n\n<p>אמר רבי יהושוע, מקובל אני מרבן יוחנן בן זכאי ששמע מרבו ורבו מרבו, הלכה למשה \nמסיניי, שאין אלייהו בא לטמא ולטהר, לרחק ולקרב, אלא לרחק את המקורבין בזרוע, ולקרב \nאת המרוחקין בזרוע.</p>\n\n<p>A common misconception is that תיקו literally means \"תשבי יתרץ קושיות ובעיות\" - Eliyahu Ha'Navi will answer questions and queries. That is not correct. It literally means the question will stand unanswered. \"תשבי יתרץ קושיות ובעיות\" is a <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">derush</a> and is found in early sources ( Shla Torah She bal Peh, Tosfis Yom Tov Eduyos ibid)</p>\n\n<p>For a discussion as to whether Eliyahu's authority is based on <em>Nevuah</em> or <em>Chachmah</em> see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14145&pgnum=85\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sdei Chemed Ma'arechet Mem, Klal Lamed Chet</a>, sh\"ut Chsssam Sofer 6:98 and introduction to Sh\"ut Min Hashamayim R Margolios edition</p>\n\n<p>For an extensive discussion on this and related issues see Encyclopedia Talmudit entry on Eliyahu.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Kedushah says the angels ask each other, \"Where is the place of HaShem's glory?\" and do not answer, since there are limits to what anyone can understand about HaShem - even angels and even Eliyahu.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, while Eliyahu might be able to answer any <em>halachic</em> questions, there are some theological/philosophical questions which only HaShem can answer and understand.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Elchonon Waserman seems to have assumed that Eliyahu Hanavi had the same power as any other eid echad could theoretically have, not more.

Mossad HaRav Kook apparently also has versions of them; all I could glean was that they were from the Cairo genizah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>There's a significant amount of literature on this which I'm not going to look up right now, so please excuse the lack of sources; I'll try to edit them in later (they were all found by following the footnotes to introductions to the Mosad Harav Kook editions of the relevant mesechtos, even though the most thorough introduction I believe is that on Eiruvin which includes a short biography of the Ritva) </p>\n\n<p>First of all, it's well known that the Ritva wrote two versions of his commentary on most masechtos, an earlier long one and then a shortened version. For examples, see his comments on Shavuos 26b and Avodah Zara 67b, where he refers to an earlier version of his work. The Nimukei Yosef to Nedarim 40b even implies that the Ritva wrote three versions of his commentary! Almost all of the published Ritvas are from his later edition, but for this reason, it could even be the case that both sets were written by the Ritva (see below).</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few of the masechtos with important Ritva notes (other masechtos with Ritva that I haven't discussed are basically confirmed actual Ritva as everyone has/had them):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Berachos</strong> commentary was published under R. Yehudah Hachasid and then later under the title 'Shita LeR\"A Ashbieli', as it was thought that it might be the Ritva's father, but today it's fairly well accepted that this work is by the Ritva himself. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shabbos</strong> the version published in Sloniki called 'Chidushei Haritva' is actually the Ran, which was already noticed and accepted by several achronim, among them the Shita Mekubetzes, Chida, Sokotchover Rebbe, and R. Elchanan Wasserman. Instead, the 'real' Chiddushei HaRitva was known to many of these achronim and published by R. S. Z. Reichman and later by Mosad Harav Kook.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Nedarim</strong> is today published with almost every version of Chidushei HaRitva, though its true author is the subject of controversy among the Achronim and scholars. It's written in a bit of a different style and sometimes doesn't fit with how the Nimukei Yosef quotes the Ritva, but the reason for this may be that the chiddushim were meant to be a halakha sefer (see the long intro in Mosad Harav Kook version).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Gitin</strong> what used to be published as Chidushei Ritva to Gitin has been pretty conclusively shown to actually have been written by Rabbeinu Kreskas Vital, a contemporary of the Ritva. However, we have another manuscript of the Ritva's commentary to this masechta as well, and they might be referred to as Ritva Hachadash. (Some people believe that this newer version is also not actually the Ritva - see intro to Mosad Harav Kook Ritva on Chullin). </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Kiddushin</strong> also has (in the Mosad Harav Kook edition) two versions, both of which are a bit unusual. One, the one ironically called 'Mahadurah Basra' because it was published later, is believed (by the editor) to be an earlier version. However, this version has passages in it that seem to have been written by the Ramah (R. Meir Abulafia), and the style is different than that of the Ritva's commentaries that we know of. The one that was published many more times and more well known is also slightly unusual in that he doesn't seem to quote the Rashba at all (though this isn't so unusual) and also because parts of the commentary are actually Tosfos Rid that was together in the same manuscript. Additionally, some things quotes by the Nimukei Yosef from the Ritva don't appear in this commentary. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Bava Metsia</strong> has two versions, the 'old' one that was known to all of the achronim, and another newly published one, sometimes called the <em>Chidushei Ritva Hachadash</em>, which is the version that is quoted in the Shitah Mekubetzes. Several Achronim have noticed that the Ritva quoted in the Shitah and the Ritva which they had were very different, but none of them (including the Devar Avraham and R. Y.Y. Weinberg) concluded that they were written by different people. The Mosad Harav Kook version published this newer one with Chidushei HaRitva on Bava Metzia, plus the first eleven blatt of the new version. The author of the introduction to that version believes that <em>both</em> of these peirushim were written by the Ritva, one being his earlier version and the other is the later version. However, not all scholars agree with his assessment (again, see intro to Ritva on Eiruvin).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shvuos</strong> also has two versions, and like in the case of Bava Metsia, some believe that both versions were written by the Ritva, one being the earlier edition and the other being the later edition. However, I again defer to the editor of the Mosad Harav Kook version of Shvuos, who does not believe that to be the case, and he thinks that only the known version is the authentic (meaning actually written by the Ritva) one. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Nidah</strong> is indeed the Ritva, but only up until the seventh perek - everything afterwords is actually part of Chidushei HaRashba, and there are very obvisous proofs to this. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why not count 50 days of the omer instead of 49?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The verse in Vayikra (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0323.htm#16\">23:16</a>) says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד ממחרת השבת השביעית תספרו <strong>חמישים</strong> יום<br>\n  even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number <strong>fifty</strong> days (OJPS, emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my experience the omer is only counted for 49 days. Is that accurate? In light of the above verse, why is that so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>For a start, the words before the ones you mention are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שֶׁבַע שַׁבָּתוֹת, תְּמִימֹת תִּהְיֶינָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seven complete weeks are only 49 days.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we see other times in Chumash that a number means <em>\"until, but not including\" that number.</em> For example in Devarim (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0525.htm\">25:3</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַרְבָּעִים יַכֶּנּוּ, לֹא יֹסִיף</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We only strike him 39 lashes; all the up to - but not including - 40.</p>\n\n<p>That's also the simple explanation for the 70 souls that came down to Egypt with Yaakov: Breishith (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0146.htm\">46:27</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל-הַנֶּפֶשׁ לְבֵית-יַעֲקֹב הַבָּאָה מִצְרַיְמָה, שִׁבְעִים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you count them you only get to 69; all the up to - but not including - 70. (And yes, there's a known Medrash that the 70th was Yocheved born as they came through the gates.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>We do count 50 days. On day 50 we say in Kiddush \"This day of Shavuot\" which essentially means \"Today is 50 days\" since by definition <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=8634\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Shavuot\" is the 50th day of the Omer count</a> (not unlike counting in some other language or using a slang word for a number). The Rokeach 294 writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צריך לספור מ\"ט יום אבל ביום נ' אין צריך לספור שהרי נזכר בברכה ובתפלה<br>\n  One must count 49 days but on day 50 one need not count since it's mentioned in the blessing[s] and prayer[s].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moreover, we count 50 days since we mark the 50th day on our calendars, just like a Zav (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0315.htm#13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">וספר לו</a>) or Zavah (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0315.htm#28\" rel=\"noreferrer\">וספרה לה</a>) counts 7 days. Sefira doesn't have to mean counting orally. As the Netziv (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14022&st=&pgnum=191\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Haamek Davar Vayikra 23:15</a>) writes: סתם ספירה משמעו בלב the word <em>Sefirah</em> by default means in one's heart.</p>\n\n<p>While it's true that we are careful to count 49 days orally, some Rishonim (see some opinions in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tur OC 489</a> though this isn't a full survey of that issue) think that this only (or <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/8600.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">primarily</a>) applies to counting weeks (eg. on day 8 you'd just say \"Today is one week and one day\"). Arguably the 7 weeks (and perhaps <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=8630\" rel=\"noreferrer\">their constituent days</a>) are required to be counted orally, while the 50 days are only required to be calculated. Indeed the Netziv (ibid.) argues that [the Talmud Menachot 65-66 (cf. Rabbenu Gershon there) implies that] the requirement to count orally is derived from the repetition of the command to count weeks in Devarim 16 (and note there is no repetition of the command to count days). See a similar line of reasoning in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50860&st=&pgnum=369\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד ממחרת השבת השביעת תספרו חמשים יום</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Ralbag</em> (ad loc.) and <em>Tosafos</em> (<em>Menachos</em> 65 <em>amud</em> 2 s.v. \"<em>Kasuv</em>\", first explanation) explain this as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>until the day after the seventh week you should count — which is day fifty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, you count 49.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the point of a hechsher on Cholov Stam?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I assume that the widespread custom of eating/drinking Cholov Stam products (products using milk in which the milking was not observed by a Jew) is relying on the leniency of R' Moshe Feinstein that the government supervision and FDA oversight is enough to assume the kosher status of the milk.  If so, why are there some brands of milk that have a hechsher, which is not a Cholov Yisroel hechsher?  If you aren't being stringent for Cholov Yisroel and the hechsher is not accomplishing that, what is the purpose of the hechsher?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is that there is no purpose, is it dishonest of Kashrus agencies to take money for a useless hechsher?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/38158/21\">Yoni is correct</a>, companies ask for kosher certifications for all sorts of reasons. (I know a rabbi who had his phone ringing off the hook from two American sugar companies begging for certification. Neither needed it from the laws of kosher per se, but both were hoping to sell to a confection company that had made a simple blanket rule, \"all our suppliers must have kosher certification.\") But there are actually other issues (at least in the USA) besides the milk per se. Vitamin D can be synthesized from mineral ingredients, or can be \"all natural\" from marine creatures. (After-the-fact it would be <em>batel</em> as it's not a flavor or enzyme.) The line could also produce chocolate milk or the like. Most of these problems would likely be <em>batel</em> after the fact, but many prefer to follow the Rashba's opinion that <em>bitul</em> is only relied upon in cases of mistakes. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Kashrus Agencies are often asked by food and other product companies for certification, even when halachically no certification is required. The companies are told that there is no technical need for certification but many proceed with obtaining certification nonetheless for a variety of reasons: their competition has certification, the belief that the product has a broader appeal to the Jewish market and appeal to other religious consumers (e.g. Muslim and Hindu).</p>\n\n<p>Before certifying such products the kashrus agency will inspect the plant and may require the plant to upgrade certain aspects of their process.

Granted, it is probably better than assuming such of a product that does not have hashgachah.  Yet, there have been plenty of instances where a specific \"kosher\" supervision either proved to be a sham [in Monsey, several years ago in the kosher meat scandal; as well as one that happened in Florida over a decade ago] or breaking laws related to [if I understand it correctly] price gouging [and are, consistently, fined by the government for breaking the law] as in what happens with at least 1 certain unnamed company during Pesach [yearly].</p>\n\n<p>I have seen it reported that the reason why cholov yisrael milk [and in some milk products] goes bad faster than cholov stam is because of shipping and storage malpractice.</p>\n\n<p>bottom line: the halacha is that you can't drink milk from an unkosher animal.  the point of Cholov Yisrael is to ensure that the milk is not from an unkosher animal.  Yet, if you are familiar with the kashrut supervision at companies in areas where Jews do not live, or at least are not in close proximity, around the clock, on site supervision is not guaranteed.  Thus, how do you know that the company doesn't sneak something unkosher into their product when the mashgiach is not at the plant, in the same way you question the possibility that a company doesn't sneak non-kosher milk into their product when the government isn't there?</p>\n\n<p>If a company is willing to be, potentially, caught for violating a government food law that will cost it its right to either operate or produce a certain profitable product, that is foolish business practice.</p>\n\n<p>A final related note: in the Shulchan Aruch it says that, when it comes to shechitah, what matters is that it is done according to the halachah, not the shochet's yirat shamayim.  This concept would seem to apply here as well. </p>\n\n<p>PS As a note of clarification, brought to my attention by mevaqesh...my underlying point is that I believe that kashrut certification is designed to make it easier for a Jew to purchase Kosher food, and thus it is appropriate for cholov stam to have a heksher, even if it is not necessary in the USA in the present time.</p>\n\n\n",

He suggested that\n  all 70 of Gidon’s sons would become rulers over the nation and\n  wouldn’t it be better if there was just one (i.e., him)? The people of\n  Shechem were from Avimelech’s mother’s side of the family. They gave\n  Avimelech 70 pieces of silver with which he hired mercenaries who\n  killed all the other sons of Gidon, except for Yosam, the youngest,\n  who hid. (Avimelech had them killed at a particular rock, a fact that\n  will become important later on.) The people of Shechem then crowned\n  Avimelech king.</p>\n  \n  <p>Yosam then called out to the people of Shechem. He used a parable\n  likening the great leaders Osniel, Devorah and Gidon to an olive tree,\n  a fig tree and a grape vine, all of whom refused to be monarch over\n  the nation, but Avimelech is like a thornbush – no fruit, only fuel\n  for fire and destruction. Since the people of Shechem acted with\n  malice against Gidon’s family, they would be repaid in kind.</p>\n  \n  <p>Avimelech ruled for three years, after which time the people of\n  Shechem rebelled. Gaal son of Eved stirred up opposition against\n  Avimelech and offered to depose him. Z’vul, a loyal city leader, sent\n  word to Avimelech warning of the mutiny and asking him to put it down.\n  Avimelech’s army went forth and battled Gaal’s forces. <strong>Avimelech set\n  fire to the tower of Shechem and killed about a thousand people.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Proceeding to Teibeitz, Avimelech started to lay siege to another\n  tower, but a woman dropped a millstone on his head, mortally wounding\n  him. Avimelech asked his armorbearer to kill him so that history would\n  not record that he was killed by a woman. After Avimelech’s death, his\n  army dispersed. Both Avimelech and the people of Shechem were repaid\n  for their treachery against Gidon’s family.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, remember that Avimelech had his brothers killed at a particular\n  rock? He was repaid in kind by being killed by a rock. Furthermore, we\n  see the power of ego. Avimelech was so vain that with his dying breath\n  he was worried that history would record that he was killed by a\n  woman. In the end, not only does the Bible record that a woman killed\n  him, but that he was so worried about his ego, even in death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, the Bible expressly mentions the curse in Judges chapter 9 verse 20.  Jotham, Gideon's lone youngest son that survived the slaughter of being killed on the one rock; he stood up like a man and gave them a lecture about the trees and the vines. Jotham stated in  verse 9:20,  \"But if not, let  fire come out from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem  and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo and devour Abimelech .\" So Abimelech was slain by a woman throwing the stone from the tower before it burned and then he was also burned  when the tower fell from the burning . And in Judges chapter 9 verse 52 -57, shows that the fire that appears to be started by man; apparently the curse was fulfilled and that the fire was really from from Jehovah. So Jotham told the curse and it was fulfilled 3 years later. He was killed by a stone or rock, the same object that Gideon's sons were slain by.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How is the land appeased regarding Shemittah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshas Bechukosai (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9927#v=34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 26:34</a>), the verse states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָז תִּרְצֶה הָאָרֶץ אֶת שַׁבְּתֹתֶיהָ כֹּל יְמֵי הָשַּׁמָּה וְאַתֶּם בְּאֶרֶץ אֹיְבֵיכֶם אָז תִּשְׁבַּת הָאָרֶץ וְהִרְצָת אֶת שַׁבְּתֹתֶיהָ</p>\n<p>Then, the land will be appeased regarding its sabbaticals. During all the days that it remains desolate while you are in the land of your enemies, the Land will rest and thus appease its sabbaticals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In what sense is the land appeased? Is the land angry that it has been denied its rest and worked too much? Does the land have emotions in some way?</p>\n<p>(I am aware that <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9927#v=34&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> understands the verse to mean that HaShem will be \"appeased\" regarding the land. However, I am looking for an explanation for the common translation that land itself is appeased.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Although man has free will, God has a world plan and one way or another his plan will succeed. Similarly God has set  into Creation that just as scientific laws must not be violated, so too the laws of the Torah are inviolable.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to shmittah the land must rest either through the choice of those in the land of Israel or through some other means... But rest it will!</p>\n\n<p>The entire Creation was created to be part of God's grand world plan. When man uses the earth to violate God's mitvos he lowers the holiness of not only himself but the earth as well.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the earth as a component of creation that is not fulfilling its purpose for being created is <strong>unsatisfied</strong> and only becomes satisfied when that injustice is redressed.</p>\n\n<p>Sources mesilas yesharim 1, daas tevunos , horeb, also see a remarkable Shaar Hatziyun along these lines (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&st=&pgnum=167\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orach Chaim 622:6</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>When speaking of the effect that people have on nature as a result of activities, we often use anthropomorfication as a method of expressing the viewpoint. For example, we have the reference to the land \"vomiting out\" its inhabitants when abominations are performed in it. Similarly, when shemittah is not adhered to, the spiritual nature of the land is sullied and it is as if it is being constantly abused. In order to express this idea, we say that the exile must last one year for every shemittah that was not fulfilled. Thus, for the 70 shemittos that were abandoned, the land will receive a \"shemittah\" year by having its inhabitants forced to abandon the land.</p>\n\n<p>This shows the idea of middah kneged middah and that Hashem has caused the physical world to mirror the spiritual world.</p>\n\n<p>People need to hear things in a way that they can conceive of or understand. It is like the way we visualize traits of Hashem in a physical way (as a strong arm and outstretched hand for example) when we know Hashem has no physical traits. Similarly we speak of nature as a being with human thoughts and emotions even though we know it has no independent existence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To provide an answer specific to Shemita:</p>\n<p>Kli Yakar's commentary to Vayikra 25:2, after explaining that the purpose of Shemita is to entrench firm emunah in the Jewish people, and the failure to observe it's laws results in a lack of Emunah</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וגם הארץ עצמה תקפיד על זה מאד כי רצונה שיתגלגל זכות זה על ידה לחזק האמונה בה' על ידה, ועוד שעל ידי זה יאמינו כי כולם אינן רק אריסים בקרקע והקב\"ה בעל השדה ובדבר הזה הארץ חפיצה שיהיה הקב\"ה בעצמו בעלה ואדונה</p>\n<p>(Translation mine) And the land itself will take issue with this greatly, since it's desire is that this merit should come about through it, to strengthen Emunah in Hashem through it.  And furthermore, through this they would come to believe that they are all mere sharecroppers in the land, and Hashem is the owner of the field, and this is the desire of the land that Hashem Himself should be its owner and master.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The land is not upset at lack of time off, but at being deprived of the opportunity to bring about Emunah in Hashem, and in not being seen as under the direct jurisdiction of Hashem.</p>\n<p>We find many examples of inanimate objects desiring to fulfill a spiritual purpose or mission, such as the rocks that wanted to be under Yaakov's head when he lied down.  The Sefer Leshem writes that every creation that is a part of bringing about Kavod Shamayim and revelation of Hashem's rule will be a part of Olam Habah, because it has reached a measure of fulfillment by playing a part in this purpose.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Issurei arayos worse than rape\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why does the Torah treat forbidden relationships, even when consensual, more seriously, from our perspective, than it treats rape?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Although all mitzvos are commandments from Hashem whose ultimate rationales are not known to us, Rambam writes (Hilchos Temurah 4:13) that we may nevertheless speculate on the reasons of the mitzvos. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the act of sin that is between man and G-d (e.g. gilui arayos) is <strong><em>intrinsically sinful</em></strong> and the consensual aspect does not mitigate its severity. However, the act of a sin that is interpersonal (e.g. rape) is not intrinsically sinful. It is, instead, <strong><em>extrinsically sinful</em></strong> -- for if there was consent it would not be sinful at all; it is only due to the lack of consent that the impact of the act is sinful.</p>\n\n<p>A similar concept is that claims or mitzvos that may be waived are not treated with the same severity and weight as those that may not be waived (איתיהב למחילה or ניתן למחילה)</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=kiddushin&daf=19a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kiddushin 19b</a> בדבר שבממון, Tosfos Shvuos 30b sv Aval (end), <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=8M1EAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PT278&ots=vmCk4Yp-kx&dq=%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%9F%20%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94&pg=PT277#v=onepage&q=%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%9F%20%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Turei Even, Megillah Chapter 4 s.v. ve'ha'amar</a>  and more) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>first of all, rape is in some ways more stringent. in that one is allowed to kill a rapist even without a beis din (he has the status of a rodef in some cases). so the premise here is not correct.</p>\n\n<p>furthermore, rape can be rectified. Deut. 22:29 \"he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives\"</p>\n\n<p>whereas an erva makes mamzerim or forbids a wife to her husband, etc. , i.e. destroys a society if left to go rampant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>In the society of those days, rape or seduction would usually happen only if the woman was somewhere outside of her house. Rashi in Devarim 22:23 says, \"A man finds her in the city - if she had stayed at home, this wouldn't have happened.\" And in the city we assume it's seduction unless she cries out (Rambam, Hilchos Naara Besula 1:2), and it would be even rarer for her to be in the field, where we assume it's rape. (Also consider how Amnon was able to rape Tamar only by tricking her into coming to his house.)</p>\n\n<p>So rape of non-relatives must have been rare (since most women stayed home) and sort of made possible by her being out and about. But relatives are at home with you, so arayos with them could have been more common, and not something they could have done anything to prevent - Ramban to Vayikra 20:17 says that's why the Torah uses the word \"kicha\" about them, and why it has to add with a sister \"and she sees his erva\", because it could happen without her even knowing about it.</p>\n\n\n",

If it is clearly for food, such as if it is already cooked, then it is אסור. If there is a food that was cooked with eggs, it is still אסור, because גויים do not have ביטול, even in 1,000 (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29574/can-non-jews-utilize-the-princple-of-bittul-berov\">this question</a>, which leaves it unresolved whether or not ביטול may be used for גויים, the Chasam Sofer assumes that it may not), and even if it is a נותן טעם לפגם.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>[We do not פסקן like the Rambam that does not hold of ליכא מידי due to the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35269&st=&pgnum=114\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Simla Chadasha</a> mentioned above, but all the same, according to Chasam Sofer one would not be allowed to sell ביצי טריפה\\טמאה, and one might argue that when he is the only egg vendor (=not מצוי) it would be אסור as well]<hr></p>\n\n<p>Credit for the Rambam, Shach and Chasam Sofer go to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/5247/yoni\">Yoni</a>.

He said, \"then avail yourselves of raiding camps.\" At that point they would seek advice of Achitofel, check with the Sanhedrin, and ask the Urim Ve-Tumim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note they're going through the same precautions -- Sanhedrin and Urim Ve-Tumim -- as if they were going to all-out war. But basically, take this Gemara and put it on water, and ... <em>argh! shiver me timbers!</em></p>\n<p>The other approach would be if we treated this like civilian life, and ask how the pirate (with some sort of governmental approval) compares to the Roman tax collector. Bava Kamma 113a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומוכסין והאמר שמואל דינא דמלכותא דינא אמר רב חנינא בר כהנא אמר שמואל במוכס שאין לו קצבה דבי ר' ינאי אמרי במוכס העומד מאליו</p>\n<p>\"And the tax payers [should be treated as thieves].\" But didn't Shmuel say that the law of the kingdom is the law?! Rabbi Chanina son of Kahana said in the name of Shmuel -- [\"taxpayers are thieves\"] was discussing the tax collector who has no fixed amount [i.e. he takes whatever he wants]. The academy of Rabbi Yannai said -- it was discussing the self-appointed tax collector.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You'd have to check the commentaries there, I'd almost wonder if the pirate in this case meets the latter criterion (his letter of marque means he's not \"self-appointed\") but not the former (he takes whatever he wants -- okay he gives half to the monarch, but he takes whatever he wants from you).</p>\n<p>My gut reaction is that European piracy at the time was effectively a form of war, no matter what it was called, and halacha recognizes that nations go to war -- similarly, there are problems selling armaments to individuals, but one is allowed to sell to nation-states. (Now ask me if piracy was a job for a nice Jewish boy or girl, I'm not so sure...)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0767919521\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean: How a Generation of Swashbuckling Jews Carved Out an Empire in the New World in Their Quest for Treasure, Religious Freedom – and Revenge</a></em> by Edward Kritzler, not only did such pirating actually take place by Jews, but some of those Jews were ordained Rabbis or acting under rabbinical sanction.</p>\n\n\n",

It would seem redundant to say it twice.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>With regard to Shema, you should say at least the first verse with the tzibur even if you've already said it (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=196&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 65:2</a>), and preferably all three paragraphs (ibid. 65:3 with Rama, see Mishnah Berurah 65:10).  Similarly, if one did not yet recite Shema, one should recite it with the congregation, having in mind not to fulfill one's obligation by doing so (Mishnah Berurah 65:8), since it is better to fulfill the obligation when reciting the Shema together with its blessings. [This implies that you need to repeat the Shema when you reach the correct place.]</p>\n\n<p>The reason is that if you don't say it with the tzibur, it may seem like you don't agree with what they're saying, ח\"ו. Hence, even if you're unable to join them in the recital (e.g. if you're in the middle of reciting another blessing), you should try to use the same tune as them so it seems like you're joining them (S.A. O.C. 65:2).</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah (65:9) writes that you should also recite other prayers with the tzibur, such as Ashrei and Aleinu, presumably for the same reason (so you make it clear that you agree with what they're saying).

    "content": "# Why is resurection of the dead a fundamental of faith according to the Rambam?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam defines the resurrection of the dead as a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37945&st=&pgnum=467\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fundamental of Judaism</a>. However, unlike the Ramban, the Rambam <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9340/440\">holds</a> that first there is Moshiach, then resurrection, and then the final result of souls' return to Olam Habah.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Ramban, I can understand resurrection being a fundamental of faith - it is the end game of the whole creation and its purpose, according to the Ramban.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Rambam doesn't count a belief in Olam Habah as fundamental, rather the intermediary stage of the resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>If it is just a reward and punishment thing (that this is the way the ultimate reward and punishment will be melted out, and don't think punishment will only be spiritual or exists in this world, or something like that), it would seem to be subsumed into the fundamental of believing in reward and punishment. Why does it get its own fundamental, and not even as a continuation of the one of reward and punishment?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R' Yaakov Weinberg in Fundamentals and Faith explains that the resurrection of the dead implies a profound and fundamentally necessary understanding of the relationship between the body and the soul.  The body could be viewed as a vessel, which is shed at the end of your life and is now a thing of the past, while your soul is \"you.\"  Resurrection is what shows that \"you\" is the combination of the soul and the body, and your existence as an \"entity\" is defined by that combination.  Therefore, the soul must be reunited with the body to meet the \"person's\" final destiny.</p>\n\n<p>He uses Chazal's analogy (Sanhedrin 91b) of the blind man and the lame man who join forces, by the lame piggybacking on the blind, to steal fruit from an orchard and then each claim innocence, as each of them individually was incapable of committing the act independently.  The owner of the orchard puts them back together and punishes them that way. So too, the soul and the body do not make up an entity with free will until they are together, and so too do they receive their reward.</p>\n\n<p>R' Weinberg understands the Rambam in Hilchos Teshuva 8:2, where he writes that there will be no guf in the World to Come, in the context of the continuation of that halacha, in which he states that there will be no eating or drinking or physical pleasures, rather it will be a purely spiritual reward.  R' Weinberg understands this to mean that the body will cease to be bound by physical restrictions, but it will still exist.  The Rambam goes on to explain which part of the soul will be present - in 8:3 the Rambam is explaining that the Neshama, the part of the soul which is necessary for the interaction and interface between the body and the Nefesh (the spiritual soul)(see Yesodei HaTorah 4:9 where the Rambam makes this distinction), is not the part of the soul that will exist in that time period.  The part of the soul that will be there is only the nefesh.  This further fits in with R' Weinberg's approach, in that the entire purpose of this part of the soul is to interface with the <em>physical</em> aspects of the body in order to act.  But in Olam Haba where the body itself will not be physical, there will be no need for the Neshama to enable the \"connection\" between the two. </p>\n\n<p>R' Weinberg asserts that it is a misunderstanding of the Rambam's position to think the body will be resurrected and then die.  The only dispute with the Ramban, according to R' Weinberg, is whether the body will remain phsyical.</p>\n\n<p>I heard from a close talmid of R' Ruderman that he understood the Rambam the same way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Before discussing why or why not something should be an ikkar/principle, we first need to know what the principles <em>are</em> in the first place. I answer that here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13091/what-are-rambams/38254#38254\">What are Rambam's \"עיקרים\"?</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Discussion of this question should begin with noting that the Gemara itself asks this very question in the very beginning of Perek Cheilek (Sanhedrin 90a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל כך למה? תנא, הוא כפר בתחיית המתים - לפיכך לא יהיה לו חלק בתחיית המתים, שכל מדותיו של הקב\"ה מדה כנגד מדה</p>\n<p>Why should his punishment be so severe? He denied Resurrection, therefore he should have no share in the Resurrection, for all the manners of God are measure for measure</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This Gemara, however, poses a severe difficulty for the Rambam, because the Mishna (that this Gemara is referring to when it asks why the denier of Resurrection is punished so severely) is discussing having a portion in Olam Haba, the afterlife, which according to the Rambam is very different than Resurrection! The Ran (chiddushim there) asks this on the Rambam, and answers that there are actually two opinions in the Gemara as to whether Olam Haba and Resurrection are equal, and this represents an alternative view than the one to which the Rambam ascribes. This is answer is also a bit difficult though, because it implies that the Mishna itself follows an opinion other than the Rambam's, despite the fact that the Rambam paskens like this mishna.</p>\n<p>Another explanation for the Rambam is given by the Sefer HaIkkarim (4:31), that the Gemara freely refers to two different things as 'Olam Haba', both the Resurrection as well as the afterlife. Despite the fact that they are two different things, they can both accurately be described as worlds that are 'to come'. However, this would leave the question of the Gemara either unanswered (because the 'Olam haba' of the answer isn't the same one as the question), or it would mean that the Rambam understood the Gemara and Mishna to be referring to the Resurrection, in which case he has no basis for saying (as he does in Hil. Teshuva 3:6) that the denier of Resurrection has no share in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>An alternative solution (I thought this myself for a while, and discovered today that <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/he-il/kitveyet/sinai/shtigliz-haikarim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I'm not the only one who does</a>) is that the Rambam does believe that Resurrection is <em>some</em> form of divine reward, even if it isn't the ultimate reward. Someone who denies the Resurrection is symbolic of the fact that he denies God's ability (or willingness) to provide a person with reward, and therefore he deserves no reward in the ultimate sense: the afterlife. Admittedly, this too is rather weak, both because it doesn't sound like that in the Gemara, and because it's perfectly plausible that someone believe that God wouldn't perform a miracle as radical as resurrection of the dead, but He does provide a non-miraculous from of reward: spiritual afterlife.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Rambam himself addressed this issue in his Letter on Resurrection, which was written mainly as a response to the claim that the Rambam didn't believe in physical resurrection of the body (because after all, as the question notes, why should he?). Inter alia, he gives an explanation for the importance of the principle of Resurrection:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שזאת ההכחשה מביאה להכחשת הנפלאות והכחשת המופת, כפירה בעיקר ויציאה מן הדת</p>\n<p>Denial of this (Resurrection) brings one to deny the miracles and signs, denial of the principle [of Judaism] and removal from religion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that the importance of the Resurrection for the Rambam has nothing to do with reward, but because the act of resurrection is crucial to the acceptance of miracles. The only reason to deny resurrection, the Rambam is saying, is because he doesn't believe in miracles, which is a belief that is absolutely required for religion. Such an answer does have its difficulties (as theoretically a person could believe that God performs miracles but not such a radical overhaul of natural laws, or that there's no need for such a miracle, etc.) but that seems to me to be the most straightforward reading of the Rambam. I unfortunately have no good explanation (or any explanation at all, really) as to how he fits this ide with the Gemara in Sanhedirin quoted above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer is, of course, going to depend on what makes something an Ikar, but I have a suggestion:</p>\n<p>The Ramban in Sha'ar Hagemul explains why it is according to the Rambam that resurrection is at all necessary if the body won't be there for long anyways:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל אחרי כן יגזור הרב ז\"ל מיתה על המשיח ועל דורו, ויהיו נפשותיהם בטוב העולם הבא, בלא גוף, כמו שהיו מתחילה, במעלה גדולה ממנה, ויזכו בו למעלה עליונה ממעלתם הראשונה, שזכו לה במצוות שעשו בזמן התחייה, וזה יתקיים להם לנצח</p>\n<p>(paraphrased) Their souls will enter Olam Haba with the merit of the mitzvos that they did during resurrection, and that merit will be what lasts eternally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of resurrection, according to how the Ramban understands the Rambam, is that in that elevated state they will do mitzvos, and the mitzvos of that perfected state will be eternal.</p>\n<p>This would explain how the Rambam understands the Gemara in Sanhedrin (90a) to be talking about denying resurrection leading to not getting into Olam Haba while they are two different things according to the Rambam, because one is a prerequisite for the other - if you deny resurrection, you will be denied resurrection, and ipso facto you will not access Olam Haba.</p>\n<p>This is palatable assuming that the significance of the Ikarim are prerequisites to the afterlife.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems quite obvious that that verse must have been written many years after the event of the mahn happened, so I assume that this fact must have been written, later. If G-d conveyed to Moses to write this in the Torah immediately, people then would have known future events.</p>\n\n<p>Did Moshe write this verse at the beginning of the 40 year travel in the desert, perhaps with God revealing when the mahn would stop, or did Joshua write it at the point or just after the man actually did stop? In short, who wrote Shmot 16:35?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The discussion as to whether Yeshoshua wrote the last eight lines or Moshe wrote them \"bedimah\" (either with tears or \"confused\") applies only to those lines. </p>\n\n<p>And Moshe the servant of HaShem died in the land of Moav by the word of HaShem.[Devarim 34:5]</p>\n\n<p>On this verse Rashi quotes a famous debate regarding the last eight verses of the Tora; is it possible that Moshe died and wrote <em>“and Moshe died”</em>? Rather, up to here Moshe wrote and from here on Yehoshua wrote. Rebbe Meir says “is it possible that the Sefer Tora is deficient, for it says <em>‘take this Sefer Tora’</em> ”? Rather G-d dictated and Moshe wrote in tears (‘b’dima’).</p>\n\n<p>Also note that the Pasuk of the 40 years (Shmos 16:35) is before the sin of the meraglim when the 40 years in the desert was decreed. Thus, it could not have been put in until after the chait hameraglim in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>The statement about the mann could have been dictated when Moshe Rabbeinu wrote the entire Torah just before he died. Thus, since the man was now scheduled to stop immediately thereafter, Moshe Rabbeinu would have been able to write it as part of the final dictation without any problem.</p>\n\n<p>Another point is that since Moshe Rabbeinu gave every shevet a sefer Torah, Yehoshua could not have added extra pesukim in the middle of the Torah. Only the end pesukim could have been added to each already written sefer torah. If Yehoshuah had added pesukim in the middle, the entire torah would have had to be written from scratch (or at least from sheet of parchment with the new pasuk all the way to the end). That is, adding the extra words to the appropriate sheet would have caused words at the end of the sheet to be pushed to the next sheet which would have to be written anew all the way to the end. The torah would have to be taken apart and resewn together as well.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, we see from the discussions in the Bava Basra 15 that only those pesukim (minor differences in which pesukim do not matter to this inyan) were being discussed. In fact, Rabbi Meir and Rabb Shimon Shezuri (menachos 30) refuse to accept that Yehoshua wrote the last pesukim because they say that the torah that Moshe Rabbeinu gave to the shevatim had to have been complete.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Who_Wrote_the_Torah.html\">Who Wrote the Torah?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Who Wrote the Torah?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>How did we get the Torah?

Some suggest that the Rebbe himself didn't do enough to discourage his followers to stop thinking that he was moshiach. It could be that he simply didn't know if he was or not. He did however, make attempts to admonish the practice (Sichos Kodesh, Parshas Noach 5752):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Schneerson responded by writing \"It has come to pass that because of his [Wolpo's] activities ... hundreds of Jews have stopped learning Chassidus, and now oppose the Baal Shem Tov and his teachings in actuality. It appeared to some that the Rebbe finally approved of the declaration of the Rebbe as Messiah at a public talk on the 6th of Iyar 1991 when young Rabbi Dovid Nachshon and others repeated Yechi also on the hebrew date of the 15th of Iyar the Rebbe for the first time encouraged the singing of \"Yechi\", the slogan about the Rebbe being the Messiah.\"\n  In fact, however, several months later on the 4th Cheshvan 5752, at a farbrengen (Chassidic gathering) on Shabbat Parshat No'ach, the Rebbe publicly admonished those who were singing that song. He threatened to leave the farbrengen, and only stayed so that it would not dissipate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After having been given some texts (see images below, from Davar Malchut, Mishpatim) of the 'messianic rhetoric' it appears that there are heavy references to the Rebbe (throughout his sichot) that gives the impression that he is not only a prophet but the 'chosen one of Hashem'. Other literary examples include: \"the shofet, yoetz and navi of our generation\", \"we are obliged to listen to him [as a prophet]\", \"we are not allowed to doubt his prophecy\", \"they are not only the words of a navi, rather the words of the Lord through this prophet!\", \"all people in this generation must recognise, that we have merited that Hashem has chosen…\", etc.</p>\n\n<p>Although not mentioning it explicitly, the sicha strongly suggests that he is the chosen messiah. (Whether this is considered normative Judaism is not the scope of this question, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18785/teachings-of-chabad-lubavitch-controversial-or-not\">related</a>). These books were written in his lifetime and purportedly endorsed and checked by the Rebbe himself (source needed! I heard this from a Chabad chasid that I was discussing this with).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Does this mean that he agreed that he was a prophet and the messiah? Or were his followers over zealous in this claim?</strong></p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27767/relations-with-messianists\">related</a> 'relations with messianists')</p>\n\n<p>(related wiki article, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad_messianism\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chabad messianism</a>)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AnfPv.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y3MmN.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/O7qrA.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to a number of biographers who have carefully sifted through his writings and researched into private conversations, R. Schneerson never explicitly stated that he was a prophet or the messiah. As Simon Dein has stressed, however, in <em>Lubavitcher Messianism</em>, the Lubavitcher Rebbe made many statements during his life, particularly reiterated by followers before the end of it, that were interpreted by a growing branch of Chabad as hinting of his messianic identity:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Among such statements were these: that his father-in-law, whose soul he was believed to have shared and who was consequently understood as a surrogate or code for the Rebbe himself, was the prince (<em>nasi</em>) of this generation and would redeem us; that the prince of the generation was the Messiah of the generation; that this was the generation of the Redemption; that the metaphysical process of separating the sparks of holiness from the domain of evil had been completed; that the Messiah had already been revealed, and all that remained was to greet him; that the messiah was coming right away; that 'the time of your redemption has arrived'; that the final Temple would descend from heaven to a spot in Crown Heights adjoining Lubavitch headquarters, and that only then would the two buildings be transferred to Jerusalem; and finally, that the messiah's name was Menachem. (Dein 55)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, when discussing the messianic fervor others had for him, the Lubavitcher Rebbe seems to have responded disparagingly and/or dismissively of the movement. Chaim Miller, in his biography <em>Turning Judaism Outward</em>, cites multiple letters and speeches from the Lubavitcher Rebbe denouncing Chabad adherents who claimed that he was the messiah. This includes, for example, the <em>farbrengen</em> incident cited in the question, in addition to his threatening to close the <em>Kfar Chabad</em> magazine for wanting to publish an article on the identity of the messiah; additionally, he gave a sermon lambasting <em>meshichist</em> \"overzealous Chabadniks (<em>shpitz Chabad</em>)\" for being antithetical to Chabad Chassidut (cf. Miller 404-407). </p>\n\n<p>While the Lubavitcher Rebbe was deeply devoted to learning about and and bringing in the messianic era, the evidence available suggests that he did not agree with Chabad messianics claiming that he was the messiah. It is important to remember that Chabad messianism also escalated after the Lubavitcher Rebbe's paralyzing stroke, when his passivity to \"Yechi\" chants was seen by some as approval of their beliefs. As to Chabad messianics' claims before his stroke, Yehuda Avner's memoir <em>The Prime Ministers</em> offers a potential insight into the Lubavitcher Rebbe's otherwise acquiescent approach: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Relaxing, he fixed me with those eyes, and with a surprisingly sweet smile, said, \"Now tell me, Reb Yehuda, you visit us so often yet you\n  are not a Lubavitcher. Why?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Still trying to absorb what he had said, I sat back, stunned at the\n  directness of the question. It was true. This, probably, was my fifth\n  or sixth meeting with the Rebbe. Over the years I had become a sort of\n  unofficial liaison between the various prime ministers I served and\n  the Lubavitch court.</p>\n  \n  <p>Swallowing thickly, I muttered, \"Maybe it is because I have met so\n  many people who ascribe to the Rebbe powers which the Rebbe does not\n  ascribe to himself.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Even as I said this I realized I had presumed too much, and I could\n  hear my voice trailing away as I spoke.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rebbe's brows knitted, and his deep blue eyes grayed again, into\n  something between solemnity and sadness, and he said, \"Yesh k'nireh\n  anashim hazekukim l'kobayim\" [There are evidently people who are in\n  need of crutches]. The way he said it conveyed infinite compassion. (Avner 445)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As a Lubavitcher, I just want to clarify some things about the sources you are quoting.\nThe sicha you have in the picture is the Rebbe's own teachings. <strong>Likkutei Sichos, Sefer Hasichos 5747-5752 (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/15986\" rel=\"nofollow\">5750</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/16035\" rel=\"nofollow\">5751</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/15971\" rel=\"nofollow\">5752</a>) - are all considered purely the Rebbe's chassidus.

Some examples would be Sichos Kodesh, Hisvadios)</p>\n\n<p>The sicha you have in the picture is what the Rebbe endorsed to be printed.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know what the Rebbe's opinion is:\nBased on the approved (\"muggah\" in Chabad terminology) sources, the Rebbe himself pretty clearly states that the Nossi of the generation is the Moshiach of the generation (for example <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?sits=1&req=47387&st=%25u05DE%25u05E9%25u05D9%25u05D7%20%25u05E9%25u05D1%25u05D3%25u05D5%25u05E8\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> - Parshas Mishpatim 5752), \nthat our generation is the one that will actually bring the Final Geulah, \nand that the Rebbe is considered a Novi (see the sicha you quoted).</p>\n\n<p>I need to link the sources.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding those instances you mention- that is true. However, based on my understanding - it is clear that the Rebbe says that he is a prophet, and almost explicitly says that he is Moshiach, but what is argued is that it is not our task to go telling the world that the Rebbe is Moshiach. If you know it for yourself, or if someone figures it out themself - fine, but no mitzva to publicize it if that will turn yidden away from Yiddishkeit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One of the answers above mentioned Rabbi David Berger; here is his well-known article: <a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/berger-rebbe-messiah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/berger-rebbe-messiah</a>.

Like converting a Christian without making it public, not even to rabbis thus doing the conversion rituals on our own?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Yes and no. The only way to convert to Judaism is to follow the procedures provided by Jewish law, which require a beis din of three Jews. However, in practice, the three Jews are rabbis, since there are a limited number of widely-recognized batei din, all of which are composed solely of rabbis, and few Orthodox rabbis will recommend or arrange a conversion that is not going to be widely accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Note that it would be possible to \"convert\" them to Noahidism (since no procedure is required to become a Noahide.) Noahides believe in Judaism but only follow those commandments required of non-Jews.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Adel, this is a question near and dear to my heart as I am a convert.  See my bio and the links thereto by clicking on my signature line below.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental requirements for Orthodox Jewish conversion are (according to my own experiences and in accordance with the text of Rabbi Maurice Lamm's book, Becoming a Jew, (Jonathan David Publ. 1991), p 119):\n •  The conversion candidate, after a peeriod of study with an Orthadox rabbi, goes before a beis din -- an ad hoc \"court\" made up of three observant adult males who qualify as judges; Usually the beis din is made up of rabbis.  The beis din will question the would-be convert on motives, knowledge, secular/family impact, and other topics.  In my experience, the rabbis will show a high level of deference to their colleague's assertions that the candidate is ready and worthy of conversion.  In my experience, a rabbi will not take someone to the beis din until they demonstrate working knowledge of Hebrew, the kosher dietary laws, and Sabbath observance and sufficient understanding to know when they need to ask questions of a rabbi when they don't know what to do.\n •  Male candidates approved by the beis din then undergo circumcision or, if already circumsized, hatafat dam b'ris, which is the drawing of a symbolic drop of blood from there.\n •  Everyone accepted for conversion must be immersed in a mikvah (ritual bath).  The rabbis personally supervise the immersion of the male converts and, in the case of female converts, they stand outside the door and rely on a female attendant's testimony that the convert immersed herself in accordance with the law.</p>\n\n<p>When the temple is rebuilt, the convert will be liable for a korban (offering) before being able to take part in any other Temple-related ceremonies.  Talmud Kerisos 8b.</p>\n\n<p>The big issue that divides Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews, and even among Orthodox rabbis, are (a) the requirements related to the convert's personal commitments to observe Jewish law and (b) the make-up of the beis din.  Whereas once upon a time, when Jewish communities were more compact and stable, it was practicable to have members of the beis din include non-rabbis who were widely known to be knowledgeable of Jewish law and particularly observant and G-d fearing.  Another factor that made that possible and practical was the fact that the convert would stay in the community where he or she converted, and there was no particular benefit in converting, so it was assumed that anyone who wanted to convert was sincere.</p>\n\n<p>Times change.  Conversion to Judaism now has advantages with the reestablishment of the state of Israel -- e.g. any Jew (including converts accepted as Jewish by the government) have financial incentives to immigrate, and non-Jews living in Israel can become citizens if they convert.  Accordingly, the Israeli rabbinate -- even back when I converted 34 years ago -- have not been happy with the non-permanent, local beis dins accepted for conversions in the US and some other countries.  The Israeli rabbinate felt that it was impossible for them to know every rabbi overseas, much less observant lay persons, and therefore they could not rely on the signatures that might appear on a certificate of conversion.</p>\n\n<p>To make American conversions more acceptable within Israel, the Rabbinical Council of America has set up standardized policies and procedures for conversions, and a system of regional courts to substitute for the ad hoc local beis dins.  See the RCA article on the topic <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=105519\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So, to summarize, my answer to your question is that while there is, in theory, a method available for converting without rabbis, it is not practical.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Technically, <strong>yes,</strong> but this is highly discouraged.</p>\n\n<p>The conversion process requires 3 things, all of which need to be done in the presence of 3 observant Jews (<em>beit din</em>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Circumcision (for men)</p></li>\n<li><p>Immersion in a <em>mikvah</em> (ritual bath)</p></li>\n<li><p>Acceptance of Jewish Law</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As the 3 Jews on the <em>beit din</em> don't need to be formally ordained, it is possible to convert without involving a rabbi.  However, in practice, the conversion would likely not be accepted by the general Jewish public nor by any Rabbinate or synagogue.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I don't understand the reason for not \"making it public.\"  One of the primary purposes of conversion is to join the Jewish People.  Becoming part of this community and tradition necessitates making your entrance (ie. conversion) public.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sub> An analogous case would be a private wedding. Technically, in order to get married, all I need are two observant Jews to witness it (and a ring, and ketubah, and an empty room for 10 minutes), and we'll be halachically married. But just because it can be done doesn't mean it's a good idea. </sub></p>\n\n\n",

My suspicion is that it refers to Midrash Tehillim 119:99. The quote in Tehillim (Psalms) to which the midrash refers reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכל מלמדי השכלתי כי עדותיך שיחה לי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Depending on your understanding of the context, that could mean something like,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>I have gained more insight than all my teachers</strong>, for Your decrees are my study (JPS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>From all my teachers I grew wise</strong>, for Your testimonies are a conversation for me (Artscroll)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That second interpretation is the one adopted by Midrash Tehillim, which reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכל מלמדי השכלתי. מהו מכל מלמדי, צריך אדם שיהיו לו חברים ותלמידים\n  בתורה שאם שכח דבר אחד שואל לחבריו ומזכירים אותו. וכן הוא אומר טובים\n  שנים מן האחד. וגם אם ישכבו שנים וחם להם. כי אם יפלו האחד יקים את חברו.\n  לכך נאמר מכל מלמדי השכלתי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"From all my teachers I grew wise\". Why, \"from <em>all</em> my teachers\"?\n  Because one needs to have friends and students in Torah, so that if he\n  forgets something he can ask one of his friends [or one of his\n  students] and they can remind him. This is why it says, \"Two are\n  better than one\" (Qohelet 4:9).  \"And if two lie together they will be\n  warm\" (Qohelet 4:11). \"Since if one falls his friend will lift him up\"\n  (Qohelet 4:10). Thus it says, \"from all my teachers I grew wise\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication here, as per what I added in parentheses, is that one can also ask one's students and that they provide the same degree of educational assistance as do one's colleagues. This sentiment can be found in numerous other places within the rabbinic literature, including other midrashim, Masekhet Avot, Sefer Avot deRebi Natan and the Talmud. It perhaps <em>implies</em> that as one teaches, so one learns, but it doesn't use those words.</p>\n\n<p>If you wanted to say those words in Hebrew, you might say something like, \"בזמן שאדם מלמד אחרים כן הוא לומד מהם\", but I will leave it to somebody with a poetic bent to come up with a better translation. It's not a phrase that I've personally seen.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mezuzah on deck door\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The mezuzah is supposed to be placed on the right side of the entrance when going into the house. Yet I have seen a number of people who place the mezuzah of their door going to the deck in the back of their house on the right side of the exit <em>leaving</em> the house. Since the deck does not have a roof it is not considered a room and therefore should not require a mezuzah going into it. Only the house is required to have a mezuzah so shouldn't the mezuzah be on the right side going in?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The explanation that I was given is that many decks do not have full (or normal) access from the yard. Even if they do, the normal access is from the house. As a result, people put the mezuzah on the right in the direction that the normal access uses (going out).</p>\n\n<p>The question is, what is the deck considered. An enclosed deck means that he deck does not have a way of of going from the deck to the yard. Thus, it is the equivalent of entering a room with only one door into the rest of the house. In that case, the mezuzah goes on the right going from the room that is mainly used (the house) to the room that cannot be used for anything else (the deck). An unenclosed deck or a deck with stairs into the yard, is the equivalent of a porch, which is treated as part of the outside. As a result, it is treated as coming into the house from the outside. Thus, the mezuzah should be on the right as you enter the house.</p>\n\n<p>Of course each house is different and needs to be checked. We have some beams in the middle of a room (along the ceiling and on one side) that required a mezuzah (as an example).</p>\n\n<p>I discussed it with my LOR this shabbos and he said that if the deck does not have a set of stairs to the yard, then he would hold that it should have the mezuzah on the right going out. He also said that there are rabbonim who hold that it goes on the right coming in in any case. He needs to discuss it with some others to determine a final psak. We also have a door to the shul that is normally locked and only opened with a safety bar from the inside. The door is at the bottom of a ramp to the basement so that handicapped people (who have the key to the door) can use the ramp rather than the stairs (on the inside). Since people do have the key and use it, then the mezuzah is set going in. The shul also has an emergency door that can be opened only from the inside. The rav wants to put the mezuzah going out, but is going to discuss it with others first. He says that he does not understand why people would say that it should be put as if it were an entrance, but is going to study the matter further.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I put in what my rav says in order to show the logic behind what different people do. Obviously, I cannot expect others to blindly accept this.</p>\n\n<p>I found a reference to a machlokes on the matter which cited She'arim Metzuyanim Ba'Halacha 11:3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In modern times, HaGaon HaRav Moshe Feinstein zt\"l (Igros Moshe ibid., 181) held that in completely enclosed balconies and yards the mezuza should be fixed on the right side of the doorway as you exit to your yard. The Chazon Ish zt\"l (Yoreh De'ah 168:7) held the opposite - the mezuza should be fixed on the right side of the doorway as you enter your house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mezuzah.net/sofer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mezuzah.net</a> found on a google search. <strong>Disclaimer</strong> I am not familiar with this site and am pointing to it only to show the logic being dicussed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Question:</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>On which side of the doorway leading into the garden should a mezuzah\n  be fixed (doors open from inside the house into the garden, not really\n  possible to open them from the garden side, and not really possible to\n  enter the garden other than from the house) – on the garden side or in\n  the house on the right hand side?</p>\n  \n  <p>Many thanks  Polina</p>\n  \n  <p>Answer:</p>\n  \n  <p>Dear Polina,</p>\n  \n  <p>There are two views about which side to put the mezuzah on.</p>\n  \n  <p>Here's the logic: The rule is that you put a mezuzah on the right, as\n  you enter a room. Is an enclosed yard as a kind of \"room\"?</p>\n  \n  <p>Opinion 1: An enclosed yard is like a room. So the mezuzah would go on\n  the right as you enter the yard.</p>\n  \n  <p>Opinion 2: An enclosed yard is not like a room, so it doesn't require\n  a mezuzah. However, the room which leads to the yard does require one.\n  So you would put the mezuzah on the right as you enter that \"inside\"\n  room. In other words, it would go on the left as you enter the yard.</p>\n  \n  <p>Conclusion: You can put it on either side.</p>\n  \n  <p>Best wishes, Eliyahu</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the deck is enclosed, meaning that it doesn’t serve as an\n  alternative entrance to the house, then the mezuzah should be placed\n  on the right of the door as one leaves onto the deck.

    "content": "# Why don't most American orthodox Jews send their kids to public school?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Given the benefits of a public school education over private day school education, such as $0 tuition and technology and extra curriculars which many schools do not have, why <a href=\"http://avichai.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Census-of-JDS-in-the-US-2008-09-Final.pdf\">don't most orthodox American Jews send their kids to public school</a> for their secular education and then hire tutors for Jewish studies? Is this an entirely socio-cultural phenomenon or are there halachic reasons as well?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 40)\n\n<p>I graduated from public school. My comments are not a result of the caliber of the education or even the environment - my school won national competitions in academic competitions, and was a very clean and safe environment.  But I would never think of sending my child to the best public school.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>My school (which ended a bit earlier than the schools around it, except for senior early dismissal) ended at 2:30 in the afternoon.  Elementary and middle school ended later.  That means that you want to now add in the equivalent of a day-school Jewish education (I can't speak for every school, but in my town that means about 5 hours).  So this child will be finishing school when most kids are in the middle of dinner.  On top of that, a planned double-curriculum will be designed so that homework is balanced for both halves of the curriculum, and the Jewish part of the curriculum could be supplemented at home, whereas a public school will not be factoring in time for another curriculum, and if you want to add on additional study or work, it will be on top of a full curriculum not designed to accommodate such.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Rambam writes in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1206.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos De'os 6:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דרך ברייתו של אדם--להיות נמשך בדעותיו ובמעשיו אחר ריעיו וחבריו, ונוהג במנהג אנשי מדינתו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The nature of man is to be drawn after the ideas and actions of his peers and friends, and to act like the people of his surroundings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My peers did not have the same values as me.  These were people who were legitimately my friends (I was invited to some of their weddings years later), as you would expect to happen with people who are spending hours together every day, and they were having social interactions on Shabbos and Yom Tov, which involved things which were objectively forbidden by the Torah, and I had to just miss out on that part.  I had to be in a position where I couldn't be completely \"part of the gang\" but I couldn't just pretend they weren't my social groups.  (I happened to have very good friends who did not make me feel outcast, but that didn't mean I enjoyed missing the parties.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ולא תתורו אחרי לבבכם ואחרי עיניכם - There are certain things which a Jew is not allowed to see (e.g. a woman's thigh, breasts).  The dress code at my school was that a young lady's shorts or skirt had to reach at least below her fingers when they hung at her side.  This was made more lenient before my younger sister graduated.  A shirt had to have straps, but cleavage and stomach below the belly button was allowed to be exposed.  A strap could also go around the neck (i.e. a shirt with a very low or absent back, held up by straps from the front).  So hormonal 14-18 year old boys are going to be expected to keep their eyes on their toes the whole day?  Additionally, phys-ed is a required part of curriculum in virtually all public schools, and they aren't offering separate swimming hours any time soon.  I <em>had</em> to play sports with the opposite gender, and go mixed swimming. I actually had an English teacher who occasionally wore mini-skirts, and it's hard to ignore the teacher.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the Yeshiva school in my town, the role models for the students are rabbis and qualified women who represent Torah values.  The secular teachers are vetted by the school, and are not espousing viewpoints contrary to the Torah.  A young mind is especially vulnerable to the opinions of adults perceived as authority figures, and mixed messages are at best confusing for them.  My Art teacher was a Jew for Jesus and wanted to talk to me about it, since I was the only one around with a yarmulke.  It's hard to tell your teacher (who determines your grade) that his beliefs are heretical and you aren't interested in discussing it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Public school follows a secular calendar.  I had to make up all the work that I missed over a Thursday-Friday Holiday, which is made more difficult when often quizzes and tests are scheduled for Fridays.  Tishrei has 7 days of Yom Tov, plus you have to go to school on Chol Hamoed to not exacerbate the issue.  Shavuos was always a fun one, since Finals are right around that time.  I actually missed the entire review period for AP Statistics because of Pesach.  Jewish schools have calendars arranged around the Jewish calendar.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sticking out is not always easy.  Sometimes, it was fun being the only guy with a lulav in his car. But I remember someone loudly declaring in the hallways (in protest of the no head-coverings allowed dress code) \"how come <em>he</em> gets to wear one\"? (I actually had to get special permission from the principal and show a note to my teachers stating I was allowed to wear my \"skull cap.\") Another day, there was a kid who followed me down the hall chanting \"yamika yamika yamika.\" I never felt threatened, thank G-d, but I wasn't always so comfortable either.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On top of all of this, for many the secular education is just not important.  Your average \"right-wing Orthodox\" family is objectively more concerned about the par of the religious education, and the secular education is at best a second consideration.  Look at many \"right-wing Orthodox\" Yeshiva high schools and you will see that they, and the parents in many cases, are just not bothered that their children won't be getting in to Ivy League schools.  The value system expressed in the question is simply not the correct hierarchy in their eyes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a postscript, the challenge that public school poses to observance is not something that we look forward to or take lightly.  The fact that it is a nisayon, a trial which tests your mettle, is not something we invite.  It's nice to say that we would hope our children will be strong enough to withstand the questions and the tests, but we do not go looking to be tested.  The Talmud (bava basra 57b) describes someone who chooses to go down a path on which he knows he will see women immodestly dressed, and describes him as an evil person even if he doesn't look, as Rashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רשע הוא - ואף על פי שעוצם עיניו שלא היה לו לקרב אלא להרחיק מן העבירה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is an evil person even if he closes his eyes because he should have distanced himself from the opportunity of a sin.  We do not put ourselves into trying situations and hope we do well. Avoiding the test is an objective value, and Jewish schools present that option.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 24)\n\n<p>I write as an Orthodox Jew, a parent and a teacher. The answer is both simple and complex.</p>\n\n<p>First, the money. Yes, public school is cheaper. Can't get around that.</p>\n\n<p>Next however is the contention that Jewish schools lack \"technology and extra curriculars\" -- this is not true for a huge chunk of Jewish schools out there. From teams to clubs and from iPads and Smartboards to coding classes and Engineering programs and everything in between, many Jewish schools offer curricular and extra-curricular perks on par with non-sectarian prep schools. The education presented is very often top notch and the decision more often hinges on money and not a sense of \"you get more at public school.\"</p>\n\n<p>But beyond the courses and quality educators there is the question of environment. I believe that education incorporates an awareness of religion and spirituality across the board. The integration of a Jewish identity into a young person's identity is a constant and consistent process. It cannot be done in fixed hours on Sunday or in the afternoons without being undone during the class time. Judaism is a life and not just a basic set of rules. The public schools MAY NOT (by law) include the kind of sensitivity to and training in history and ritual that I want my children to have.</p>\n\n<p>Mix in the concern over the potential for conflict (games on Shabbos, treif food at school events, no days off for Yom Tov) and the position you put impressionable children in either having defend/explain their own religious position or be influenced by what they see around them (peer pressure isn't always intentional or malicious), the decision to help nurture a rounded, religious child in a sheltered environment which make them stronger educationally is not an unusual one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 16)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The child attending public school knows that his attendance is\n  compulsory, because his parents and the government consider his\n  education of the utmost importance. Together with this comes the\n  recognition that what is really important and essential to his\n  education is taken care of in the school. The child’s instinctive\n  feeling and inference from this is that anything that is not included\n  in the school curriculum is of secondary importance if, indeed, of any\n  importance at all. Hence, if religion (prayer) is excluded from the\n  school, the child would inevitably regard it in the same category as\n  an extra foreign language, or dancing, or music lessons, which are not\n  required by the school but are left to the parents’ free choice, and\n  which the child, not illogically, considers a burden or even a\n  nuisance. In other words, the present system of the public school\n  education is such that it impresses upon the pupil the belief that\n  everything connected with religion, such as knowledge of G‑d’s\n  existence, etc., is of little consequence, or of no importance\n  whatever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/2051611\">Rabbi Menachem M.

It is dead because it has no expression, yet it is not turned over to good because the Tzaddiks love for Hashem is not complete, thus not completely transformative. Turning it to good (as described in the Yerushalmi, a quality of Avraham Avinu) means that the connection to evil is completely removed and therefore the energy of the Yetzer Harah is dedicated to good completely.</p>\n\n<p>(See also particularly footnote <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7889/jewish/Chapter-10.htm#footnote3a7889\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a> in the above link.)</p>\n\n<p>So the fundamental answer of how did he slay his evil inclination is by arousing such a great love for Hashem that it completely removed any desire for evil, but wasn't quite enough to turn that energy towards good.

    "content": "# A computer file that I emailed you has a virus. Am I responsible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My rav frequently discusses contemporary halachic questions. He quotes a general rule from the Gemarrah (I assume it's from Baba Kama or one of the \"Baba's\") that a person who causes damages is always responsible, even if accidental (Excuse me if I may not be paraphrasing this rule, correctly.)</p>\n\n<p>With this context, the rav claims that if I email you a file that has a virus, you open it, and the file damages your computer, (e.g. - destroys the hard disk or O.S.), I am responsible. My argument is that the sender is probably NOT responsible because:</p>\n\n<p>1 - All computers, these days, are expected to have virus and security protection, and it is the receivers responsibility to scan all potential email viruses.</p>\n\n<p>2 - There is no way to verify that the sender DIDN'T scan the file before uploading it. If we assume that he did, and there was no virus, a virus could have still been picked up during web trasnfer. It's quite posible...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In terms of actual damages the general discussion of this concept is around <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%90_%D7%95%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%99\">Grama and Garmi</a>. A person is always responsible for their direct actions (except in an Ones - when forced). However, if the damage is indirectly related, then they are not, as a matter of Beis Din (G-d still holds you responsible). This is a disagreement between Rabbi Meir and the Chachamim (Bava Kama 100a). The conclusion is that at least some form of indirect damages is liable in Beis Din.</p>\n\n<p>How, exactly, you define indirect damages is a matter of lengthy discussion. If the action itself is damaging, just not directly, like burning someone's loan documents, the loss of the paper is not the damage, it is the inability to collect the loan. That is the classic example of Garmi and the Halach is that it is liable.</p>\n\n<p>However, if the damage was contributory - say someone thew something down from a roof and the damager came and quickly removed the cushion - this is a large discussion in terms of if the person is liable or not (most likely not, it is a very minority opinion otherwise) and exactly how you distinguish this from Garmi. This is called Grama.</p>\n\n<p>Exactly how you apply that to this case is a question for a Rav/Beis Din and will most certainly be decided on a case by case basis, based on the totality of the facts.</p>\n\n<p>[It seems to me that the fact that the person had to actively open the attachment to be damaged is going to make it hard to make the case that this was Garmi, but nothing in this Sugia is open and shut.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Nailed it. This is the last question in Rabbi Dovid Lichtenstein's <em>Headlines: Halachic Debates of Current Events.</em> (This entire discussion is summarized from pages 449-462 from that book.)</p>\n\n<p>The first angle he approaches the question from is the Mazik of Eish. As recorded in the first several blatt of Bava Kamma, each Av of Nezek has its own characteristic, from which we may derive Toldos, other types of damage. A practical difference between which type of damage a particular Toldah is considered is its halachos: the times for which one is obligated for when their fire damages is very different than when their pit damages. To my knowledge, the only reason for this distinction is a Gezeiras HaKasuv.</p>\n\n<p>The characteristic of Eish is that another force - namely, the wind - is responsible for the damage spreading (BK 3b). Likewise, one might argue that a computer virus is sent using a second force known as the Internet. Thus, it should be liable to the rules of Eish.</p>\n\n<p>At  this point in his discussion, R' Lichtenstein brings an argument that a virus might be subject to the dispute between Rashi and Tosfos regarding Tzeroros that I don't fully understand, but ultimately he concludes that even Rashi would agree it should be considered Eish.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now, there's a dispute between R' Yochanan and Reish Lakish (BK 22a) regarding why one is chayiv to pay for Eish: Mishum Chetzyo, that Eish is considered Adam HaMazik, and thus one is liable to pay Chamishah Devarim (R' Yochanan); and Mishum Mamono, that Eish is considered one's property damaging, and thus you're only chayiv Nezek (both views). Since we pasken like R' Yochanan, we'll need to figure out which category computer viruses fall under.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (BK 23a) brings a case of a fireproof wall that stood between the two properties at the time the fire was lit that had fallen afterwards, allowing the fire to spread. One can't say that it's Adam HaMazik, since there's no way for the person to have damaged in such a scenario. Thus, one can only be liable because his property damaged.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, one might distinguish between a virus that infects the computer upon arrival versus one that requires the user to open the email. If it just needs to be on the computer's hard drive, it could be considered Mishum Chetzyo. If the user needs to open the email and let the malware inside, it could be considered Mishum Mamono.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, perhaps one can say that since it's to be expected that people regularly check their emails, the potential for damage occurred as soon as the email was sent, and thus, even if the email hadn't been opened yet, it's still called Mishum Chetzyo. This is comparable to a wall surrounding the fire that can topple in a normal wind; it's only to be expected that the fire will escape, and thus it's called Mishum Chetzyo (Chazon Ish, BK 2:2). </p>\n\n<p>On the third hand, one could distinguish between the wall that will topple, a natural occurrence, versus checking your email, a human act. The possibility of damage can't be said to be in place at the time the virus was sent if human intervention is required. After all, if you throw a fragile object at a cushion, you're absolved of damages that occur if someone removes the cushion, since when you threw the object, no damage was going to occur (BK 26b).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>R' Lichtenstein now focuses on practical differences between Mishum Chetzyo and Mishum Mamono in our case of a computer virus:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Sheves: Say that the virus is of a type that the computer exploded as soon as he opened the email, or the virus otherwise prevented him from doing his job and he therefore lost his income for the time being. If you hold that a virus is considered Eish Mishum Chetzyo, you would be liable to reimburse him for that, whereas if the virus is considered Mishum Mamono, you would be patur.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tamun: Another little piece I don't quite understand. There's a heter by Eish that you're not liable for things that are hidden, but you're still liable if their location can easily be made known. Since either way we're dealing with Eish, I'm not sure what the Nafka Minah is here.</p></li>\n<li><p>Your point that it's quite possible that the sender didn't know that the virus existed: if it's considered Eish Mishum Chetzyo, we pasken Adam Muad L'Olam and he would be liable (see SA CM 421:2). If it's considered Eish Mishum Mamono, he would be patur.</p></li>\n<li><p>Is it his virus, or is it one that he picked up from somewhere else and passed along to your computer? If it's not his virus, then according to Rashi (BK 22a), if it's Mishum Mamono, you would only be liable if you own the virus; if it's Mishum Chetzyo, you would be liable either way, since, as we said before, Adam Muad L'Olam.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There's one other aspect we need to consider: the victim had to participate for the damage to occur. The Gemara (BK 47b) absolves one who put poison in front of an animal, and the animal then ate it. After all, the animal didn't have to eat it. Most Rishonim explain that the culprit is not liable if the animal brought it upon itself. The Rosh (BK 6:3) explains slightly differently, saying that the <em>owner</em> of the animal should have taken measures to ensure that the animal didn't harm itself. It's not because of the indirect nature of the damage, the Rosh argues; it's because the owner didn't live up to a very reasonable expectation that he should have protected his animal. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, if you hold it's an issue of indirect \"you did it to yourself\" damage, the sender should be absolved, whereas since one should not be expected to not open any email they receive, the Rosh would obligate the sender to pay. However, perhaps the rest of the Rishonim would agree you should have to pay, since it's not just an issue of indirect damage, but one of Garmi, common cases of indirect damage. Since viruses are more common than poison, perhaps they should be held liable, even where poison isn't.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As a final note, R' Lichtenstein points out that certain viruses could be considered hezek she'eino nikar and thus, in cases of viruses sent unintentionally, there's a question of whether one has to pay or not. If you sent this kind of virus intentionally, you are liable to pay d'Rabbanan.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you sent a virus intentionally, then you are certainly liable to pay for Nezek, but there's a question if you have to pay for Sheves. </li>\n<li>If you sent a virus unintentionally, then you are liable if the virus would have infected the computer as soon as it was sent, and perhaps you would be liable even if it needed the victim's participation to infect his computer. In the event that you are liable, you might also be liable for Sheves. Depending on the situation, it might be called Hezek She'eino Nikar and you may be exempt on those grounds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>My problem with this approach:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Gemara at the beginning of BK (5b) discusses learning out Avos from a combination of multiple Avos. Why don't we learn out the Toldah of a computer virus from the combination of Eish, as explained above, and Bor, whose attribute is that its sole purpose of existence is to damage (BK 3a)? Since a computer virus has both of these attributes, it should have both of their halachos. This could mean that you're entirely patur on havoc wreaked by malware, just like you're patur when keilim are damaged by a Bor.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>No, you're not responsible, just as you aren't responsible if you send your friend a bottle of wine that gets poisoned somewhere along the way. As long as you didn't knowingly infect his computer, you're OK.</p>\n\n\n",

He explains that the understanding of the prophet went according to his individual makeup, and that all prophets except Moses saw a vision that was not entirely clear.</p>\n<p>As to the second questions, in siman 190, he explains why this system was the way prophecy worked.</p>\n<p>The first point he says is that Hashem wanted to reveal Himself to mankind according to the nature of mankind, which is that the form which is assumed \"below\" (in this world) is a representation of the spiritual flow which is its source.  So too the prophecy would be presented as a manifestation, with a form, of its source.  In this way prophecy parallels the rest of creation, in that the supernal matters are not directly revealed, but are perceived through their relationship to the creations.</p>\n<p>The second point he makes is that certainly everything that exists is the way it is in order to reflect some aspect of spiritual reality.  Therefore, for example, man was created with eyes in order to reflect Hashem's providence.  And everything is exact in that way, and if not that Hashem wanted to reflect some concept in this way, it wouldn't be created this way.  Therefore, the prophecy, by using images, is shown to the prophet in order that he understand how this flow is connected from the spiritual to the physical world.  (See there at length for greater detail)</p>\n<p>The Malbim in Parshas Beha'aloscha, on the words במראה אתודע אליו, explains this with a different approach.  He explains that all prophets grasped Hashem through His emanation into this world - they perceived this world as having a reality to it, and they related to Hashem from within the world (as opposed to Moshe, who, to a degree, was able to grasp Hashem as He exists beyond the confines of finite existence).  Therefore, when they receive a Divine message, it is through the medium of this world and its tools that they receive the message.  Thus the verse describes that \"regular\" prophets see Hashem במראה (with a komatz), which means a mirror - they can only see the side of the vision that they are standing on.  Moshe on the other hand, sees במראה (with a segol), which means a lens - he is able to see through to the other side.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Abarbanel, <strong>No.</strong> He writes (Intro to Yirmiyahu) that one of the reasons there are so many Kri\\Ktiv in Jeremiah is because Yirmiyahu was young when he started getting Nevua and didn't know Hebrew spelling and grammar, and Chazal corrected all of his mistakes later.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, as is clear from Jeremiah chapter 1, God presents images to the prophet, who then has to interpret it himself.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Gemara (Baba Batra 15a) says that Hezekiah's people \"wrote\" the book of Yishaya (Isaiah), and that the Anshei Knesset haGedolah \"wrote\" Yechekzel (Ezekiel) and Trei Asar.

In <a href=\"http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/moshiach_chap4.pdf\">Chapter 4</a>, Rabbi Student quotes Rambam's Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Melachim 11:4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a king will arise from the House of David who delves deeply into the study of the Torah and, like David his ancestor, observes its mitzvos as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law; if he will compel all of Israel to walk in [the way of the\n  Torah] and repair the breaches [in its observance]; and if he will fight the wars of G-d –he is presumed to be Moshiach. If he succeeds in the above, builds the Beis Hamikdash on its site, and gathers in the dispersed remnant of Israel, he is definitely the Moshiach. He will then perfect the entire world, [motivating all the nations] to serve G-d together, as it is written (Zephaniah 3:9), \"I will make the peoples pure of speech so that they will all call upon the Name of G-d and serve Him with one purpose.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/moshiach_chap4.pdf\">Hilcohos Melachim 11:5</a>, Rambam says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But if he did not succeed in all this or was killed, he is definitely not the Moshiach promised in the Torah... and G-d only appointed him in order to test the masses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Student's book also cites the Ramban's famous disputation of Christian belief that their Jesus was the Moshiach by simply pointing to the fact that the ultimate proof that someone was or is the Moshiach would be the fact that we're living in the Messianic Age with no wars and 100% of the world believing in the G-d of Abraham.  See Kisvei HaRamban vol. 1 p. 311).  The presumption of Ramban's view is that once the claimant to the title of Moshiach dies, the claim dies with him.  Using this analysis, all authorities are agreed that it is heresy for a Jew to accept Jesus as the Moshiach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.  Have the rabbis specifically declared that Chabad meshichists are guilty of heresy that would, for example, make it inappropriate for one to rely upon the shkitah of a meshichist Chabadnik? (quesiton restated)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Short answer:  So far, while there have been rabbis who have declared the view to be wrong and not a part of Judaism, see e.g. Rav Aaron Feldman's <a href=\"http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/feldman.pdf\">view</a> with respect to removing oneself from a minyan where the prayer leader inserts meshichist phrases into the avodah.  But, as Rabbi Student points out, and which collections of statements on the subject agree, there is no organized effort to declare Chabad meshicists as heretics; rather the rabbis appear to have left the door open for meshicists to comeback into the Orthodox Jewish mainstream as their views soften. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://moshiachtalk.tripod.com/moshiach_chap6.pdf\">Chapter 6</a> of Rabbi Student's book, generally, demonstrates how one could argue today  seeks to make the case that belief that a dead man can be moshiach, still, is apikorus.  Go to the link I've provided for the details of his analysis which, again, relies on the Rambam -- specifically his commentary to the Mishna in Sanhedrin 10:1 where he lays out his 13 principles of faith.  He concedes that there is no organized effort to declare meshicists to be heretics.</p>\n\n<p>The opinions of various contemporary gedolim -- before and after the Rebbe's death -- can be found at Wikipedia under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabad_messianism\">Chabad Messianism</a>. There you can see condemnation of the concept, but reluctance to expel the Jews who hold mistaken views.</p>\n\n<p>The language you use, that Rabbinic sources suggest that belief that the Rebbe could still be the Moshiach is not \"beyond the pale,\" has been attributed by meshichists to 1996 statement by Rav Aaron Solovechik in contradiction to his view stated two years ealier that the Rebbe cannot be moshiach because he's dead.  A subsequent letter resolves the conflict.  In it, he states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"To my great dismay. . . publications affiliated with the Lubavitch movement have persisted in stating that I validate their belief that a Jewish Messiah may be resurrected from the dead. I completely reject and vigorously deny any such claim. As I have already stated publicly. . . such a belief is repugnant to Judaism and is the antithesis of the truth. My intent in signing the original letter . . . was merely to express my opinion that we should not label subscribers to these beliefs as heretics. Any statements in that letter which imply an endorsement of their view were not shown to me at the time I signed and I once again repudiate any such ridiculous claim.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>3.  Additionally, what do they purport to do about the prevalence of Chabad shochtim who do hold this belief? Do they hold their shchita to be invalid? Would they not join them in a minyan?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some rabbinic organizations have taken a strict view with respect to giving hashgacha to restaurants that promote the view that the Rebbe will return as Moshiach.  A New York restaurant supervised by Rabbis Marc Angel and Avi Weiss in 2002 threatened to withdraw hasgacha from the restaurant for describing the Rebbe in its menus as \"MHM\" (i.e. Melech HaMoshiach).  However, I haven't heard or seen any cases like this thereafter.</p>\n\n\n",

One such proof, as described in <a href=\"https://leimanlibrary.com/texts_of_publications/95.%20New%20Evidence%20on%20the%20Emden-Eibeschuetz%20Controversy%20The%20Amulets%20from%20Metz.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article by Rabbi Dr. Leimann</a>, is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yonasan Eibeshitz engaged in practical kabbalah, writing amulets, with the instruction that people should not open them. He wrote such an amulet to a woman, but it did not work; she died. The husband gave the amulet over to Rav Yaakov Emden who was also a master of kabbalah. He read it and saw Sabbatean messages in it, such as \"Yeled Yulad Lanu, Ben Nitan Lanu\" combined with Shabtai. Rav Emden published this in the sefer Sefat Emet.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yonasan Eibeshitz's response to this was that they were misreading the amulet. E.g., what Rav Emden said was a tav was really a chet, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>What the article then documents is that Rav Yaakov Emden went to a French court together with two of Rav Yonasan Eibeshitz's talmidim. The French court copied over the amulet and the two talmidim signed an admission that this was the accurate text of the amulet.</p>\n\n<p>Since Rav Yonasan Eibeshitz's response was shown to be false, and without that explanation, the amulets are properly understood as Sabbatean, this is evidence that he was a closet Sabbatean.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In addition to the accurate and conclusive proof cited in prof.

In brief the author argues that Rabbi Yehezkel Landau (the Noda Beyehuda) found convincing evidence that R' Eibshitz was a Sabbatean but sought to either downplay or mitigate that fact, perhaps due to R' Eibshitz's greatness in Torah study. In one example R' Landau examined the controversial materials and concluded they were Sabbatean in nature but offered R' Eibshitz a way out by saying that they were falsified by others</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Landau admitted that if not for the fact that the amulets were ascribed\nto Eibeschuetz, he would have concluded that their author could only\nhave been a Sabbatian Landau suggested the possibility that either he - Landau - had misread them, or else they were partially falsified between the time Eibeschuetz had written them and the time they were shown to Emden. In any event, all the amulets were to be returned to Eibeschuetz and were to be withdrawn permanently from circulation. Moreover, Eibeschuetz was proscribed from writing and distributing amulets ever again. No less embarrassing for Eibeschuetz was the stipulation that since numerous allegedly Sabbatian works - aside from the amulets - were circulating under Eibeschuetz' name, Eibeschuetz had to publicly condeirculating imder Eibeschuetz' name, Eibeschuetz had to publicly condemn them...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# After the first plague, where did Paro's magicians get water to turn to blood?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sh'mot chapter 7 describes the first plague, with the Nile and all other water turning to blood (except the Israelites' water).  Paro's magicians then turn water into blood, which convinces Paro that it's just a trick so he hardens his heart.  The text <em>seems</em> to describe a pretty rapid set of events: Paro was immersing in the Nile, Moshe and Aharon turned it to blood, the magicians did the same, and then Paro went to his house.  It doesn't sound like Paro's magicians had time to send to Goshen for water for their trick.</p>\n\n<p>The text does tell us that the Egyptians dug around the Nile looking for water for seven days, which seems to be later than these events.  Did the magicians figure that out right away?</p>\n\n<p>How did the magicians have water?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra said that only the above ground water (such as in the river) turned to blood, but water that was underground before the plague stayed water.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"And all of Egypt dug around the river to find water to drink\" (7:24)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus , when the Egyptian magicians needed water to emulate the plague, they dug a new well See Ibn Ezra on <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/7.22#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vaeira 7:22</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש שואלים: הלא כל המים נהפכו לדם, ואנה מצאו החרטומים מים והפכום.\n  והתשובה: אמת, כי כל המים הנראים למעלה נהפכו לדם. והעד: כי היו שותים\n  מהמים שחפרו (שמות ז׳:כ״ד), גם כן חפרו הם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The medrash Rabbah states that the Egyptians were able to buy water from the Bnei Yisrael and it would remain clear. Thus, the magicians could buy water and use their magic to turn it into \"blood\".</p>\n\n<p>I am sure that someone asks how the Egyptians survived for seven days without water. Besides to answers above, we can say the following. Note that Egypt was a major beer producer so that they could drink beer for seven days. Also, the Masai tribe of Africa drink blood from their herd animals. Thus, if the Egyptians got thirsty enough, they could drink the blood and survive.  However, that has nothing to do with this particular question.</p>\n\n<p>There are commentators  such as Rabbeinu Bachya that say that actually it should be read \"had shown that they could turn water into blood\". This means that it was already known that the magicians could do this and that Par'oh pointed this out. Thus, he claimed that Moshe and Aharon were merely super powerful wizards. This is analogous to the medrash about the staffs in which Par'oh laughs and says \"this is a common trick that even children can do\". According to this, they did not need to change water into \"blood\" at that time because it was already known that they can do so. One point is that if Moshe had shown the second sign to the Egyptians (the Torah does not mention him showing any sign other than the staffs to the Egyptians), they would have demonstrated their ability to duplicate it then.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya says that they took advantage of the gap between the warning and the actual plague to show Par'o that they could do it also.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim cites Sa'adiah Gaon that only drinkable water was turned into blood. Thus, they took contaminated water (such as salty from the sea) and changed it into <em>blood</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>\nI checked Rabbi Sorotzkin and he brought up the possibility that they got the water from Goshen or that they stepped beyond the border of Egypt into another country to get the water to change. Other meforshim ask why they changed water to blood since it was just making things worse. They point out that if they could have changed a little bit of blood to water and back, that would have given Par'oh a \"reason\" to think that his magicians were more powerful than Moshe and Aharon. Thus, they had to find water that had not changed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Shir Maon writes they turned blood into \"water\" (looked like it) and then turned it back into its original state which is blood. Magic cannot work on water (see Sanhedrin) but could on blood.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>R. Yosef Bekhor Shor (Tosafist) uses this as a proof that the water only turned into blood for long enough to kill the fish, then the fish polluted the water rendering it undrinkable.\nHe is in turn quoted by Hizkuni, Moshav Z'keinim, Riva al Hatorah, and others.</p>\n\n<p>This is the wording of Hizkuni (Exod. 7:20):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא נעשה היאור דם כי אם לפי שעה ומיד מתה הדגה מחמת הדם ואח\"כ חזר היאור לקדמותו</p>\n  \n  <p>The river only became blood for a moment whereupon the fish died as a result of the blood, and afterwards the river returned to its original state. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Shadal (7:22) suggests that originally the plague only struck the river (see 7:20), and only later did it spread to all the other water in the land (see 7:21).</p>\n\n\n",

(Who started it?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Pilpul is not so much a method of learning as it is a method of applying one's learning. It is thought to have started with R' Yaakov Pollak in the 15-16th century, and involves the linking together of disparate texts on the basis of lexical and thematic similarities. It has its detractors, but chiefly because it has been taken to illogical extremes by those who would use it to <em>demonstrate</em> their learning, rather than to apply it.</p>\n\n<p>Its most frequent application is in the realm of drash. Rabbonim who have employed it include R' Yonasan Eybeschütz and the Beis haLevi, among others. The extent to which it can be employed in the development of <em>halakha lema'aseh</em> has long been the subject of some controversy. In fact, R' Mordekhai Yoffe (the Levush) writes in his introduction that he had once subscribed to this method but that he now rejects it wholeheartedly. Other famous opponents to pilpul include the Maharal of Prague, the Vilna Gaon and the Netziv.</p>\n\n<p>Sources for the above:</p>\n\n<p>Menachem Elon, <em>Jewish Law: History, Sources, Principles</em> (4 vols; trans.

Brown, \"Orthodoxy and the Search for Spirituality in Jewish Adult Education\", <em>Jewish Spirituality and Divine Law</em> (ed. Adam Mintz and Lawrence Schiffman; Yeshiva University Press, 2005), 271-295 (288 n32).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To add to Shimon's answer, a prime example of Pilpul is any sefer written by <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"R' Yosef Engel\">R' Yosef Engel</a>. His entire way of learning is collecting various sugyos and basically smashing them together to prove his point. Often, he starts off with a חקירה, a theoretical/conceptual inquisition, which has two possible answers. He then collects all the sugyos that he can find (which are usually very numerous) to show that the Tanaim/Amoraim hold one way or another, or that his חקירה is really a מחלוקת between them.</p>\n\n<p>R' Yosef Engel does not avoid the problem of bizarre outcomes. He will sometimes take his חקירה to it's logical extreme, with strange results. (For example, in סימן כד of ספר אתוון דאורייתא, he concludes that a זר should be חייב מיתה בידי שמים for destroying תרומה. This is a basically unheard-of חומרה with no proof whatsoever, other than the fact that it is the product of R' Yosef Engel's assumptions.) </p>\n\n<p>This derech halimud is basically out of style. Those who are not learning for in-depth analyzation will not be learning anything at all like this. For those who are looking for in-depth analyzation, the derech of R' Chaim Soloveichik has basically taken over many Yeshivos, and he had a totally different way of learning, usually not involving smashing several sugyos together but taking one sugya/concept and breaking it down into its theoretical components.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# At what point can you assume senility?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my experience it is rare to see a Rosh Yeshiva or other prominent Rabbi declared to be senile and no longer working at full mental capacity. Recently such a proclamation was made about one Rosh Yeshiva however this was <a href=\"http://forward.com/articles/183786/norman-lamm-s-mental-health-prompts-yu-abuse-jud/?p=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">due to a legal situation</a>. I think it is fair to assume that there are other Gedolim or older Roshei Yeshiva who are in a similar situation. I understand these things are not made public out of respect, but halachically I would guess that a person who no longer has all his faculties cannot be relied upon for psak. At what point can/should an assumption be made by the general public that a certain Rav is senile and can no longer be relied upon, even absent a medical diagnosis?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# (Ki) Ani Hashem Elokeihem\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Twenty-seven times (by my count) in Torah and in Ezekiel, we find the phrase אני ה׳ אלקיכם or אני ה׳ אלקיהם at the end of a <em>pasuk</em> (for example, Lev 25:55).  In eight of these cases, the phrase is preceded by the word כי (for example, Lev 26:1).</p>\n\n<p>Whenever the word כי is present, the trope is: כי - <em>tevir</em>, אני - <em>merkha</em>, ה׳ – <em>tippekha</em>, אלקיהם/כם - <em>siluq</em>.  Whenever the word כי is not present, the trope is: אני - <em>tippekha</em>, ה׳ - <em>merkha</em>, אלקיהם/כם - <em>siluq</em>.  The main difference to notice is that the main disjunctive in the phrase, the <em>tippekha</em>, is in different places.  Note that this shouldn't be an effect of the word כי, because the <em>tevir</em> disjunctive is a lower lever disjunctive than <em>tippekha</em>, and so the placement of the <em>tippekha</em> should occur before the placement of the <em>tevir</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, in five verses in Ezekiel, we have כי אני אדני ה׳ (Ezek 13:9, 23:49, 24:24, 28:24, and 29:16), which follows a very similar word pattern (although with different names of God and without the final suffix), yet the trope here splits כי אני from אדני ה׳ (unlike either of the cases in the preceding paragraph).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know what the implications are of the different <em>teamim</em> choices, or the inclusion/lack of כי?  Is there a reason why changing the names of God and omitting the possessive suffix should change the parsing of the verse?  Are there any commentators (or grammarians/explicators of <em>teamim</em>) who discuss a difference in meaning between these cases?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Nehama Leibowitz, in the first volume of New Studies in Shemot (pp. 306-7), discusses the distinction between two possible syntactic structures of the first three words in Exodus 20:2.</p>\n\n<p>(a)\nאנכי ה׳        אלהיך,<br>\n(b)\nאנכי        ה׳ אלהיך.</p>\n\n<p>She cites <em>Ibn Ezra</em> and <em>Shadal</em> who discuss the two readings (they focus on Ex 20:2, the details of which aren't relevant to the question at hand).  The distinction, as summarised nicely <a href=\"http://www.ottmall.com/mj_ht_arch/v17/mj_v17i14.html#CCY\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>(a) \"I, Whom you already know as Adoshem, am to be\nyour God\",<br>\n(b) \"Let me introduce myself: I am the Lord your God\".</p>\n\n<p>(This answer doesn't address possible implications of כי introducing the phrase.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_Lonzano\" rel=\"nofollow\">Menachem Di Lonzano</a> writes in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6473&st=&pgnum=217\" rel=\"nofollow\">Derekh Chayim 108b</a> that the Tipcha is on \"Ani\" so as to not sound like \"I am God, your god, [and not that other god who is also your god]\". He concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולכן בכל אני ה' אלהיכם יש טרחא במלת אני לבד כשיבא מלת כי בתביר קודם לה לפי שאי אפשר לטרחא לבא אחר תביר אם לא במאריך באמצע.‏<br>\n  And therefore in all \"Ani Hashem Eloheikhem\" there is a Tipcha on the word \"Ani\" except when the word \"Ki\" with a Tevir precedes it, for it is impossible for a Tipcha to come after a Tevir without a \"Ma'arikh\" in between.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A Ma'arikh might be what we call a Merkha or it could be what we call a Meteg/Gaya. Either way though the rule is odd because we find Tevir-Tipcha sequences all the time. Possibly what he means is Tipcha can't come straight after a Tevir when the Tevir also has no Meshareit, a rule which (if Ma'arikh is taken as a Meteg/Gaya) would have only a couple exceptions (the only two I see in Torah where you have Mafsik-Tevir-Tipcha with no Metagim/Makkafim on the latter two are Lev 11:9 and Deu 7:20).</p>\n\n<p>So it seems according to this simply that the Tipcha-Tevir combo is impossible for technical reasons (whatever they may be exactly), and so when the word \"Ki\" is introduced the Tipcha shifts to the also-reasonable position on \"Hashem\".</p>\n\n<p>(If I had to guess about the examples from Yechezkeil, I'd say that the name-combo אדני-יהוה is thematically too joint to split, and we prefer to lose entirely the syntactical division of the Tevir than to split up those names.)</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Asi probably means that in all worldly achievement, (accomplished by physical action, such as walking), Samson was hindered.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Nahman is emphasizing when Samson gained this strength, his hair and what it represented was the cause of this prodigious change.</p>\n<p>Samson's hair was what made him fit to receive supernatural strength, by way of divine bestowal. It was a core tenant of his nazirite oath to disregard the physical, and the only overt testament to that oath on his person, (as opposed to drinking wine, which is a mannerism, not a feature). Thus it was said to stand on end a lightning rod for miraculous feats, whose renown traveled throughout his tribe's territories, from Zorah to Eshtaol.</p>\n<p>His hair crashed together, sounding like a bell, as the bells on the high priest's overcoat would sound as he walked to perform service in the temple, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0228.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verses 33-34</a>). Just as the bells served as a constant reminder of the High Priests lofty services, and the reverence they demanded, so did Samson's hair. It reminded reminding him that, even though he was to infiltrate the Philistines under licentious pretenses, developing relationships with many Philistine women, he was always to remember his purpose for doing so. Only that would protect him from harm, (and his hair did, until he parted with it).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the medrash with Yehuda, it would seem to me that its referring to veins as they bulge when ones 'blood boils'.

In addition, the description of Mashiach's  ability to simply sense the guilty party in a case (Rava in Sanhedrin, 93b) and other characteristics unique to Mashiach (see Verses 1 - 5) provide clear guidelines of some of what is necessary for one to be Mashiach and should give pause to those who wish to proclaim any individual the Mashiach.

Since during <em>shmitah</em> or <em>yovel</em>, the fruit tree owner must declare the fruit that grows on his tree to be <em>hefker</em> (abandoned) and permit the citizens to take fruit to the extent of their personal needs.  Accordingly, whould a tree be exempt from the mitzvah of <em>revai</em> if its fourth year fell on a <em>shmitah</em> or <em>yovel</em> year?</p>\n\n<p>Also, since we do not have the Temple anymore, but we still observe shmitah and yovel (well at least some farmers do), what is the practice for dealing with the fruit of a four-year-old tree in a normal year?

    "content": "# Has the minhag regarding weddings during the Omer changed recently?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My father in law was a musician. He explained that other than Lag Ba'Omer and beginning 3 days before Shavuot, there were no weddings at all during the Omer. Even though, there are two versions of the Omer mourning period, apparently, anyone who wanted to plan a wedding after Lag Ba'Omer or betwwen the end of Pesach and Lag Ba'Omer respected the other custom and didn't make weddings. (This was his reasoning - can't vouch if that reasoning is true or not.)</p>\n\n<p>I noticed during the past 15 - 20 years, that weddings have been popping up not just on Lag Ba'Omer, but during the days afterwards. My understanding is that for those for whom the mourning ends at Lag Ba'Omer, this is not a problem. But, I am curious as to what and why things changed from what it was.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The various discussions show that farther in the past, there were a number of different minhagim. It was not always the case that weddings were not held for the entire period (though that is one minhag as shown by Rabbi Kaganoff).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/the-mourning-period-of-sefirah-what-are-the-guidelines-of-the-aveilus-observed-during-the-sefirah-weeks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Kaganoff</a> points out that no matter what minhag is being observed, it is still basically a method of counting 33 days.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein points out that although these customs differ which days are considered days of mourning, the premise of most of the customs is the same: Thirty-three days of sefirah should be observed as days of mourning in memory of the disciples of Rabbi Akiva. In Rav Moshe’s opinion, these different customs should be considered as one minhag, and the differences between them are variations in observing the same minhag (Igros Moshe 1:159). This has major halachic ramifications, as we shall see. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The minhag of the \"entire\" period was actually the 33 days excluding Shabbos, Chol Hamoed, and Rosh Chodesh.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This approach is based on an early source that states that Rabbi Akiva’s disciples died only on the thirty-three days of sefirah when tachanun is recited, thus excluding the days of Shabbos, Yom Tov, Chol HaMoed, and Rosh Chodesh (Bach, quoting Tosafos). If one subtracts from the forty-nine days of sefirah for the days of Pesach, Chol HaMoed, Rosh Chodesh, and the Shabbosos, one is left with thirty-three days. It is on these days that the mourning is observed. (This approach assumes that in earlier days they recited tachanun during the month of Nisan and during the several days before Shavuos.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://matzav.com/customs-during-sefirah-part-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attending a Wedding during one’s Sefira</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One who is during his sefira may still attend a wedding of someone who is making a wedding when the bal simcha is not holding sefira. This is even if he wants to dance and listen to music there.[Divrei Yoel 1:26:1, Natei Gavriel Pesach 3:page 214:footnote 17 (minhag in Skver), see Lag B’omer page 178:footnote 31.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=2262\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marriage During the Omer Counting Period</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is the opinion of some authorities that only \"optional\" marriages\n  are to be avoided - i.e., marriages wherein the groom was previously\n  married and has fulfilled the Torah obligation to have children. One,\n  though, who has not yet fulfilled this commandment, say these\n  authorities, can marry during the Omer counting period. This is\n  because the commandment to marry outweighs the custom to mourn (Pri\n  Chadash). In practice, however, later authorities agree that the\n  custom calls upon even those who have not yet fulfilled the\n  commandment to reproduce to refrain from marrying during this period\n  (Mishnah Berurah 493:1).</p>\n  \n  <p>If an individual is invited to a wedding on one of the days which,\n  according to his own custom, it is forbidden to marry, he is permitted\n  to attend the wedding, to partake in the meal, and to make the bride\n  and the groom happy by dancing in their honor (Iggrot Moshe, Orach\n  Chaim 1:159; see also Piskei Teshuvot 493:13).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/the-mourning-period-of-sefirah-what-are-the-guidelines-of-the-aveilus-observed-during-the-sefirah-weeks\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Kaganoff says</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Can One Change From One Custom to Another?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>We would usually assume that someone must follow the same practice as\n  his parents – or the practice of his community –­­ because of the\n  principle of al titosh toras imecha, “do not forsake the Torah of your\n  mother (Mishlei 1:8)”. This posuk is understood by chazal to mean that\n  we are obligated to observe a practice that our parents observed.\n  However, Rav Moshe Feinstein contends that since the different customs\n  that are currently observed are all considered to be one minhag,\n  changing from one custom to another is not considered changing one’s\n  minhag, and it is therefore permitted. There is ample evidence that\n  other, earlier poskim also agreed that a community may change its\n  custom how it observes the mourning days of sefirah (see Shut Chasam\n  Sofer, Orach Chayim #142). According to this opinion, the specific\n  dates that one observes are not considered part of the minhag and are\n  not necessarily binding on each individual, as long as he observes\n  thirty-three days of sefirah mourning.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Attending a Wedding During One’s Sefirah Mourning</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>If a friend schedules a wedding for a time that one is keeping\n  sefirah, is it permitted to attend? One is permitted to attend and\n  celebrate a wedding during his sefirah mourning period, even listening\n  to music and dancing there (Igros Moshe 1:159).</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, although I am required to have a mourning period during sefirah\n  of at least thirty-three days, I may attend the wedding of a friend or\n  acquaintance that is scheduled at a time that I keep the mourning\n  period of sefirah. However, Rav Moshe rules that if one is going to a\n  wedding on a day that he is keeping sefirah, he should not shave,\n  unless his unshaved appearance will disturb the simcha (Igros Moshe\n  2:95).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

For it is possible to appoint or hire a person to assist the blind person to come to the synagogue, and even if he comes with the dog up until the synagogue, it is possible to leave the dog outside and it will be easily possible for people to help him inside.

If, however, they can know or feel every time they were relieved they should recite it each time. The receptacle may be present as long as it is enclosed and does not emit a foul odor.

Please daven for Yosef ben Rachel.\"  Someone in my Yeshiva received the text message, and showed it to the Gabbai at the end of seder, who proceeded to go to the bima and lead recitation of Tehillim on behalf of this boy.  The \"joke\" was that no one was kidnapped, and Parshas Vayeishev is when Yosef (ben Rachel) was sold through Yishmaelim down to Mitzrayim.</p>\n\n<p>The inappropriateness of it notwithstanding, does this jokester get schar (reward) for having been the catalyst of the sincere recitation of many people?

Not deceiving others has to take precedence over all else whenever possible. \"Sheker ain lo raglayim\". There is nothing beloved to Hashem about a boy bringing others to daven extra through deceit. Judaism is not Machiavellian- it's not only the end that matters but the means as well. </p>\n\n\n",

Sure, they're no gadol, and they might have not even learned an extensive volume of halacha, but the way their challenge is treated is odd.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of explaining why the reasoning is wrong for disagreeing with this gadol, often a learned frum individual will just say, \"Who are <strong>you</strong> to disagree with a gadol?\" In nearly any discipline, study, or area of thought, this is never an appropriate response to a challenge. Nobody is told that they cannot disagree with Keynes on economics, or with Newton in physics, or Herbert Spencer in sociology, et cetera. Challenges are welcomed, and if they're novice challenges, then they're rejected with logic and explanation quite quickly. However, I've seen this poor attitude in the frum community where legitimate challenges towards poskim are met with, \"You haven't studied halacha your entire life, so how can you possibly challenge a great posek?\" Why is this acceptable? Is this not just an argument from authority? I'm confused here.

Would you refuse surgery based on your own self declared expertise or would you defer to the world renowned physician?</p>\n\n<p>In Torah, even more than in other disciplines, one must approach the discipline with humility and recognition that questions should be labelled simply as questions, not as disagreements.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I believe, we must be open to all kinds of questions and not be afraid to ask any question.

Their choice of life stye is thus affronted and personally attacked, (in their minds). The appropriate response would be to answer, or to admit they don't know, but that they are sure there is an answer.

In chapter 3 Rus and Boaz keep talking about Boaz being a גֹאֵל, but גֹאֵל of what? Boaz is the uncle of Machlon and Kilyon and as such he doesn't have an obligation to do yibum (Yevamos 17b). So why the use of גֹאֵל in that conversation, why not just talk about plain old marriage? </p>\n\n<p>Then, in chapter 4 גֹאֵל is used to describe redeeming an ancestral field. That makes sense to me, but then suddenly in pasuk 5 we read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר בֹּעַז בְּיוֹם קְנוֹתְךָ הַשָּׂדֶה מִיַּד נָעֳמִי וּמֵאֵת רוּת הַמּוֹאֲבִיָּה אֵשֶׁת הַמֵּת קָנִיתָ לְהָקִים שֵׁם הַמֵּת עַל נַחֲלָתוֹ:\n  And Boaz said, \"On the day that you buy the field from the hand of Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the deceased, you have bought [it], to preserve the name of the deceased on his heritage.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesn't sound like any field-redeeming גֹאֵל transaction I've ever heard of. How is Rus involved in this land sale? And how is Boaz able to add in these conditions? If Naomi is really selling the field why isn't she having a conversation directly with Mr. גֹאֵל (Ploni Almoni)? </p>\n\n<p>Then it gets even more difficult. The pasuk (7) sounds like it is talking about chalitzah, but also about monetary transactions</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְזֹאת לְפָנִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל עַל <strong>הַגְּאוּלָּה</strong> וְעַל הַ תְּמוּרָה לְקַיֵּם כָּל דָּבָר שָׁלַף אִישׁ נַעֲלוֹ וְנָתַן לְרֵעֵה וּ וְזֹאת הַתְּעוּדָה בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל:\n  Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redemption and exchange, to confirm anything, one would remove his shoe and give [it] to his fellow, and this was the attestation in Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So does גֹאֵל mean marry, redeem a field or both, and how and why does it seem to be used in these confusing ways in the narrative?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Note that in Kesuvos 104 we see that a widow can sell her husband's property to cover the kesuvah. The laws of inheritance are such that the land would have gone to Elimelech's brother and down through the line. Since there were no brothers left, Rus was not subject to yibum (see the Rambam on this) and could have married anyone that she wanted (or who would have her). As a result, the redemption of the land and the marriage to Rus would be \"lifnim mishuras hadin\".</p>\n\n<p>Boaz probably arranged this with Naomi as she had not wanted to sell the property to cover her kesuvah (and that of Rus if her initial marriage had been legitimate) originally. Thus, he could then present the entire package and marry Rus, relying on his status as the head of the bais din to ensure the psak would be accepted by future generations.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, questions were raised about the legitimacy of Dovid hamelech and the navi Shmuel had to write the book of Rus to publicize his psak.</p>\n\n<p>Since this \"lifnim mishuras hadin\" procedure was designed to emulate the yibum procedure and redemption, the same terms are used. The phrase וְזֹאת לְפָנִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל implies that this was a normal procedure at that time for verifying transactions rather than bringing to mind chalitzah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Regarding the performance of Yibum, several Rishonim (Ramban and Rashba), in the context of Tamar's relationship to Yehuda, discuss the idea that Yibum has an intrinsic value, and that it is not intrinsically limited to only a brother, but would have a value, albeit lesser, through even more distant relatives.  When the Torah forbade the marriage of relatives, it only left an exception for Yibum in the case of the greatest spiritual benefit.  But in the event that there is no prohibition, the intrinsic value of Yibum would still be relevant.  So Boaz being a Go'el in terms of marriage could still be understood according to its simple Yibum implications.  Indeed, the Malbim explains, Boaz chose to do Yibum in order to spiritually reincarnate Rus's deceased husband, Machalon, which is the Zohar's approach to what happens in Yibum - the soul of the deceased is reincarnated into the son born of the Yibum union. (See Malbim to 4:14, for example.)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding buying the field, along the same lines, he may have chosen to acquire the field through Yibum instead of acquiring it separately in order that it be the nachala (inheritence) of Machalon, and not his own unrelated property, as the Malbim explains at the end of verse 4:5 that the field acquired through Yibum will be associated with the deceased.</p>\n\n<p>The implication of the Malbim is, however, that Tov had no option to buy the field, and it was not merely a choice to acquire it through Yibum instead of purchasing it, but rather this was the only option of how to get the field belonging to Rus, as is clear in his commentary to the first part of verse 4:5. This could possibly be because (my own suggestion) Rus was unwilling to sell the field in order that it be a \"bargaining chip\" to have Yibum, especially once she knew that Boaz was willing to do Yibum once Tov stepped out of the way (verse 3:13).</p>\n\n\n",

Why is Naomi not present (or at least not speaking) during the sale?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I remember reading that Ploni Almoni was Elimelech's brother.  <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16454#v=1&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi 2:1</a> says that Boaz  was the son of Salmon, a deceased brother of Elimelech and Ploni Almoni was Tov another brother of Elimelech. Rashi 4:1 explains why the name was changed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>a kinsman</strong>: Heb. מוֹדַע, a kinsman. He was the son of Elimelech’s brother. Our Sages said: Elimelech and Salmon the father of Boaz and\n  So-and-So the near kinsman were all sons of Nahshon the son of\n  Amminadab, but the merit of their fathers did not avail them when they\n  left the Land to go abroad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note laws of inheritance are such that Naomi could not have inherited the property of Elimelech. Since his children were dead, the land would then go back to Elimelech's brother (Ploni Almoni) and then down through that line. In Kesuvos 104, we see that a woman can arrange to have her husband's property sold to pay for the kesuvah. Naomi did not wish to do this for as long as she could avoid it. The implication as well is that Boaz arranged this beforehand so that he could then insist that the redeemer also marry Rus.</p>\n\n<p>Since she was selling the land to cover the kesuvah, the actual redemption and the marriage to Rus was \"lifnim mishuras hadin\". Only the brothers of the dead husband could be considered in the category of Yibum. As explained by RAMBAM, since none of Elimelech's children were alive, Rus was not subject to the halachos of yibum and could have married anyone she wanted (or who would have her).</p>\n\n<p>There are meforshim who say that Ploni Almoni refused to marry Rus because he knew that there would be a dispute. He considered that she would have to marry a gadol (like Boaz) so that the psak of \"Moavi vlo Moaviah\" (a female Moabite <strong>could</strong> marry and be accepted) would be accepted in future generations. Indeed, Dovid was originally rejected by people who did not want to accept that psak and Shmuel Hanavi wrote the book of Rus to emphasize the ruling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Malbim on that verse explains that he knew the sale was taking place because she had decided to sell it, and it was publicly announced that the field was on the market.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, the Malbim explains that she had told Boaz that she intended to sell it, and he had told her that he would first approach Tov (Ploni Almoni).  The Malbim finds support for this in verse 4, where Boaz is seemingly referring to a prior conversation which he is now merely relating to Tov.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The fact that Naomi waited and did not make this claim until Ruth was recognized as being worthy of marriage (to Boaz) suggests that she was planning this from the start of her return to Eretz Yisrael. The claim that she had on the marriage of her son-in-law Ploni Almoni to Ruth was biased by the land rights too (even though this land was not directly hers). However she could not insist that this land was included with Ruth until the Leverite marriage law had been set aside.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# No mention of Korban Tamid in Amida\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During Musaf, the specific sacrifices that were brought for Musaf are always mentioned, quoting the specific verses in the Torah that involve those sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p>However, even though תפי­לות במקום קרבנות תיקנום - The Amida prayer was established to be at the time of the sacrifices in order to replace the Korbanos with prayer (Tur, O.C. 98), there is no mention of the sacrifices brought every morning and afternoon (or what was done in the evening to merit Ma'ariv).</p>\n\n<p>Instead the practice is to say these pesukim before Shacharis, and some say them before Mincha as well. But they are not part of the actual Amida.</p>\n\n<p>Why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1497&pgnum=13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Node Beyehuda (V1, OCH §4)</a> discusses this question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואשר בדק לן מעלתו <strong>למה פסוקי המוספין קבעו בתפלת המוסף ופרשת התמיד לא\nתיקנו לומר בתפלה פסוקי התמיד</strong>.</p>\n<p>Loosely translated: Why are the verses of the Mussaf established within the Mussaf prayer, yet the verses of the <em>Tammid</em> were not fixed into Shacharis/Mincha prayer?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He begins be stating that no-one in his generation (and, obviously, ours) is really qualified to answer this question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה בדבר זה היה לי למנוע מלהשיב כי מי\nהוא ואיזה הוא שיאמר מלבו טעם על דברים העומדים ברומו של עולם ואנשי כנסת\nהגדולה להם לבדם נפתחו שערי שמים וקבעו הכל בטעם ידוע להם ואין אתנו יודע\nעד מה.</p>\n<p>Regarding this issue, I should really refrain from answering, for who among us can say from his heart a reason for something which stands at the centre of the Universe; the Men of the Great Assembly alone opened the Gates of Heaven and established everything with rationale known only to them, and we know not from them...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He continues to suggest a reason:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואעפ\"כ ע\"פ פשוטן של דברים נלע\"ד <strong>משום שהתפלות שנקבעו בכל יום נקבע בהם\nכל צרכי האדם וכל אחד בעת הצורך יפרוש כפיו בתפלה להתפלל אפילו כמה פעמים\nביום</strong> וכמ\"ד הלואי שיתפלל כל היום. ואפילו לדעת החולק עכ\"פ אם אירע לו\nלחדש דבר יכול הוא לחזור ולהתפלל. <strong>ואם היו מזכירין התמיד בפירוש בתפלה לא\nהיה אפשר להתפלל אלא שחרית וערבית</strong> ולמי שהיה נולד איזה דבר להתפלל עליו\nלא היה יכול להתפלל ואין כל אדם ביכלתו לחדש נוסח תפלה מלבו. ולקבוע תפלה\nאחרת חוץ מתפלה שבמקום התמיד לא רצו להטריח בכל יום. ולכן אף  שתפלתנו\nנגד תמידין תקנו לא קבעו זכרון התמיד בפירוש בתפלה משא\"כ בתפלת  המוסף\nשהיא לפרקים קבעו פרשת המוספין מפורש</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Summary: Tefillos, apart from being in the place of <em>korbonos</em>, are also 'רחמים נינהו' - prayers for mercy. They were designed to be prayed all day, every day - at any point when necessary, one should be able to pray the 'default prayer' designed by the <em>Anshei Knesess Hagedola</em>. If there was mention of the <em>korbonos</em>, one would only be able to say them during the times when the <em>korbon</em> was sacrificed (basically, the times we have for Shacharis and Mincha). <em>Mussaf</em>, however, is solely in place of the sacrifice (see Tosfos Berachos 26a, that <em>mussaf</em> has no <em>tashlumin</em> for this reason).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The 17th blessing reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רצה השם אלקינו בעמך ישראל ובתפילתם <strong>והשב את העבודה לדביר ביתך ואישי ישראל</strong> ותפילתם באהבה תקבל ברצון ותהי לרצון תמיד עבודת ישראל עמך... ותחזינה עינינו בשובך לציון ברחמים ברוך אתה השם המחזיר שכינתו לציון:‏</p>\n<p><sup>Favor, God our Lord your nation Israel and their prayers, <strong>and return the service to the sanctum of your temple, and the fire offerings of Israel</strong> and their prayers with love accept with favor, and may it be for perpetual favor the service of Israel your nation... And may our eyes see your return to Zion with mercy, blessing are you God who returns His Presence to Zion</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every day, in every prayer, we ask for a general restoration of the Temple service, of which the Tamid continual offerings were a daily part. The sprinkling of the morning offering's blood preceded the completion of the lighting of the Candelabra, and the afternoon offering concluded the service for the day, (see <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=yoma&daf=33a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 33a</a>). It is thus included in \"the service\", and requires no special mention.</p>\n<p>\"Fire offerings\" includes sacrifices that were not routine, such as those outlined in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h51.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevahim 5</a>. They are mentioned broadly to accommodate the disparate obligations of each individual or community.</p>\n<p>The Mussaf additional offerings had designated times when they were always to be brought, and as they were not always a part of the service, they were outliers from the general prayer, so they needed specific mention. They also comprise their own separate prayer in our liturgy that does not contain any other prayers, (unlike the first amidah, which also focuses either on personal requests or on the holiness of a special day). This format allows for a more focused meditation.</p>\n\n\n",

And we already expounded on that Ezra made an enactment such that anyone who has had a seminal emission should not read words of Torah until he has immersed.  And the courts which stood after that time enacted this also for prayer, that someone who has had a seminal emission should not pray until he has immersed.  And this not due to issues of purity or impurity, but such that Torah Scholars should not be busy with their wives all the time in the way roosters; and because of this immersion was enforced after a seminal emission alone, as opposed to other impurities.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, at the time the enactment was in force, that even a zav who had a seminal emission and a niddah who had a seminal emission and a woman who copulates and see's that she's become niddah, they require immersion prior to reciting the Shema prayer or regular prayers due to the emission, even though they are impure.  And we see that this immersion is not for purities sake, but due to the enactment, such that they should not constantly be with their wives.  And also even this enactment regarding prayer has been canceled, since it did not spread to all of Israel, and the public didn't have the strength to abide by it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just ran across <a href=\"http://www.etzion.org.il/vbm/archive/beshiv/27tevila.rtf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this very detailed article</a> on the subject from the Virtual Beit Midrash in Har Etzion.

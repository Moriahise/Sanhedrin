Is there any list available that shows the Rishonim and Achronim that pasken like Rabbeinu Tam? On the same night is there an opposing list of those that normally pasken like the \"shitas hagaonim\" as it's often known (the opposing view to Rabbeinu Tam in regards to shkia/nightfall</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R. Ovadya Yosef has a (characteristically) lengthy responsum analysing the views of numerous authorities (Yabi'a Omer vol. 2 OH 21).</p>\n\n<p>He writes (ibid: 5) the following summarising the Rishonim  and major Aharonim who concur with R. Tam:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>. נמצא שדעת רובא דרבוותא קמאי שמשעת שקיעת השמש מעינינו עד צאת הכוכבים הוי שיעור ד' מילין, וקודם לזה אסור מה\"ת לעשות מלאכה במוצ\"ש. (הלא הם רבינו האי גאון. ור\"ת. והראב\"ד. והרז\"ה. והרמב\"ן. והרשב\"א. והרא\"ה. והריטב\"א. והר\"ן. והרב המגיד. והמאירי. וה' אהל מועד. והסמ\"ג. והרוקח. והמרדכי. ורבינו פרץ. והרא\"ש. ור' ירוחם. ועוד.) ולזה הסכימו מרן והרמ\"א בש\"ע. והמבי\"ט. והרדב\"ז. ומהר\"י קולון. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes further (ibid 8) regarding the Aharonim: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה רבים מגדולי האחרונים ס\"ל ג\"כ כד' ר\"ת. וכמ\"ש בשו\"ת הבית חדש (סימן קנד) וז\"ל: ולענין הלכה רוב המחברים תפסו פי' ר\"ת, וכן פסק הב\"י בהל' שבת, וכן מנהג כל ישראל. ע\"ש </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding those who disagree with R. Tam, he references (ibid 10):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאחר שכבר נהגו להחמיר בזה כסברת כמה פוסקים. ומהם רב נסים גאון, ור\"א בן הרמב\"ם, והובאו להלכה בתשו' מהר\"ם אלשקר. ולזה הסכים רבינו הגר\"א (סי' רסא). וכ\"כ בס' חידושי רז\"ה (דכ\"ט ע\"א והלאה). עש\"ב וכן האריך בזה המשנ\"ב בבאה\"ל (סי' רסא). והעלה שח\"ו להקל באיסור סקילה לדעת כמה רבוותא. והבא /והביא/ שכן פסקו עוד הראב\"ן, ומהר\"ל מפראג, והש\"ך ביו\"ד (סי' רסו ס\"ק יא). ע\"ש </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, he notes (ibid 11) that in practice the view of the disputants of R. Tam held much sway, and that likely reflected the views of numerous other authorities, whose views are not extant in our records:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איברא דחזי הוית להגאון בתי כהונה ח\"ב (ס\"ס ד) שכתב, שאע\"פ שלפי הספרים הנמצאים עמנו נראה שרוב הראשונים תפסו לעיקר כשיטת ר\"ת. מ\"מ הואיל ובמספר הדורות סוגיא דעלמא דלא כוותיה, ונראה שפשטה הוראה בכל תפוצות ישראל כדעת החולקים. אית לן למימר שמאז ומקדם גמרו אומר רוב הראשונים דלא כר\"ת, אלא שלא זכינו לדבריה' בכתובים. ע\"ש. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He notes (ibid) that this was also the view of the Ben Ish Hai, and the custom in Baghdad:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן העד העיד בנו הגאון החסיד רי\"ח ז\"ל בבן איש חי ש\"ב (ר\"פ ויצא) שהמנהג להמתין במוצ\"ש עד כ' דקים /דקות/ אחר המגרב. ומר אביו הרב החסיד ז\"ל היה מחמיר להמתין חצי שעה. ע\"ש. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is perhaps seen in the atypical offerings brought - barley, which is animal food, for the korban omer at the beginning of the count, and chametz, representative of physical man (including the \"seor sheba'isa\"-leavening midrashically identified with the <em>yetzer hara</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Shem MiShmuel (Lag BaOmer 5671) seems to suggest that Lag BaOmer represents the transcendent third* of the Omer count when Rabbi Akiva's students would have reached a level of mutual respect reflective of the ideal of the Torah, which is why this is when they ceased to die.  Thus Lag BaOmer is the beginning of the 3rd <em>ashmora</em> which culminates with the giving of the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>We perhaps find similar themes regarding Purim which also reflects man from within his constraints in this physical and chaotic world, transcending and acknowledging the divine.  Accordingly, the Maharal explains the halacha of drinking <em>ad d'lo yada</em> as a way of serving G-d with one's physical self.  We also find the unique <em>mitzvah</em> of the day of <em>mishloach manot</em> to create a camaraderie and to overcome the baser, selfish instincts.  Finally, we see on Purim the \"<em>kiymu ma shekiblu kvar</em>\" - the willing fulfillment from within this world's constraints - of the Torah that was accepted at the culmination the <em>ashmorah</em> that begins on Lag BaOmer.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*paralleling the Talmudic view about the night being broken up into three <em>ashmorot</em> - watches.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Knowing when Someone will die\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There seems to be an idea that it is possible to be able to divine when a person will die. The Chizkuni mentions (on Vayikra 16:21, \"בְּיַד־אִ֥ישׁ עִתִּ֖י הַמִּדְבָּֽרָה׃ \") [from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.16.21?lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sefaria]\n</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“by the hand of a man especially (temporarily) appointed for this task.”According to a Midrashnot found) the word: עתי, “which could be translated as: “whose time had come,” this is someone who was destined to die before this year is out. This would account for the fact that it was noticed that the man who had been entrusted with this task never lived out that year. [A well known commentator, author < of k’lee yakar, written several hundred years after that of our author, by the name of Shlomoh Efrayin ben Aharon, quotes this commentary, but attributes it to our author. Ed.] We must assume that in those days people used astrology to determine who was not destined to live out the year. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Esther, 1:13, the Malbim comments that the men who were \"yod'ei ha'itim\",</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היו יודעי העתים רוצה לומר שהיו בקיאים בחכמת המזלות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>though he doesn't connect the mazalot to death, one of the ones named is Memuchan, whom the Gemara in Megilla 12b identifies as Haman, and Haman was an astrologer (<a href=\"http://www.koshertorah.com/PDF/purim.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.koshertorah.com/PDF/purim.pdf</a> page 5). So there seems to be an idea that one can figure out when someone is suitable for death or when one will die.</p>\n\n<p>If that is the case, then what value is there in praying to be inscribed in a \"book of life\"? If someone knows that X will die this year, wouldn't it be better to let X know this (in fact, one could suggest that being chosen to be the one who accompanies the se'ir into the wilderness might be such a notification)? But then that would contravene Kohelet 9:12 כִּ֡י גַּם֩ לֹֽא־יֵדַ֨ע הָאָדָ֜ם אֶת־עִתּ֗וֹ  .</p>\n\n<p>This is supported by Shabbat 153a (via dafyomi)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Mishnah - R. Eliezer): Repent one day before your death.\n  (m) Question (Talmidim): One does not know when he will die!\n  (n) Answer (R. Eliezer): Therefore one should repent today, lest he die tomorrow - this way, he repents every day - \"B'Chol Es Yihyu Vegadecha Levanim v'Shemen Al Roshcha Al Yechsar\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are there any sources which discuss the idea of others' knowing when a person will die and how that should affect how he is dealt with, or how he should behave?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר לפניו רבש\"ע נסתכלתי באיצטגנינות שלי ואיני ראוי להוליד בן אמר ליה צא מאיצטגנינות שלך שאין מזל לישראל מאי דעתיך דקאי צדק במערב מהדרנא ומוקמינא ליה במזרח</p>\n  \n  <p>‎Avraham said to HaShem, Master of the Universe! I've read the stars, and I am not destined to have a son. HaShem said to him, go out from your astrology, for astrology does not apply to the Jews. Why do you say thus? Is it because Jupiter is in the west? I will move it to the east. (Shabbos 156a-b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whatever an astrologer sees in the stars is how things may be now, but not how they must remain. Avram was destined not to bear children. HaShem told him to ignore the stars. He would change them to his favor. At some point in the future he would indeed bear a son - nine, in fact (Yishmael in Bereishis 16, Yitzchak in Bereishis 21, and Keturah's seven sons in Bereishis 25), as well as possibly a daughter (disputed in Tosefta Kiddushin 5:14).</p>\n\n<p>The above Gemara in Shabbos brings three cases in point: that of Shmuel, who predicted - correctly - that the Jews destined to be killed by snakebite would survive (in the merit of their charity they ended up killing the snake); that of R' Akiva's daughter, who, in the merit of feeding a pauper whom everyone else was too busy to notice, accidentally poked out the eye of the snake that was supposed to kill her on her wedding day; and that of R' Nachman bar Yitzchak, who, as long as he davened for success and kept Yiras Shamayim on his mind, would overcome his natural tendencies to steal. </p>\n\n<p>So, to more directly answer your question. If one is slated to live for, say, 50 years, he is able to extend that if he merits or diminish that if he does not. The fact that his fate today is to die then does not mean he must remain that way tomorrow, for better or for worse. </p>\n\n<p>(By the way, this general principle is stated explicitly in Rosh Hashanah 17b. Tefillah works even after one's fate has been decided.)</p>\n\n\n",

As such, Non-jews (Who fall under the 7 noachide laws) are not to be circumcised.</p>\n\n<p>Is this his rhetoric, or is this discussed anywhere in Jewish literature?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2603.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Milah 3:7</a>), not only is it permissible for a gentile to circumcise himself, it is a mitsvah!</p>\n\n<p>As he writes in a responsum (ed. Blau # 148), this is in the category of <em>eino metsuveh v'oseh</em>; one who performs a mitsvah in which he is not obligated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מותר לישראל למול הגוי אם רוצה הגוי לכרות הערלה ולהסירה, לפי שכל מצוה, שהגוי עושה, נותנין לו עליה שכר, אבל אינו כמי שהוא מצווה ועושה </p>\n  \n  <p>It is permissible for a Jew to circumcise a gentile...since [for] every mitsvah that a gentle does, he is given reward, but not [to the same degree] as one who is commanded and does it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Horowitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Pinhas Horowitz</a> writes in Panim Yafot (Genesis 17:1) that Abraham didn't circumcise himself before being commanded to, since it is forbidden for even a gentile to wound himself.</p>\n\n<p>This is somewhat similar to the answer given by R. Yehoshua ibn Shu'aib (quoted <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53790/8775\">here</a>), but the latter notably does not state that there is an actual prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, however, the claim that a non-Jew may not injure himself is quite dubious. See R. Pinchas Zvichi's lengthy responsum in Ateret Paz (1:3:HM Ha'arot 7:3) who questions this. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, not every injury is included under the rubric of \"wounding\". I am not aware, for example, of any sources the prohibit ear piercing for this reason. (R. Yitshak Yosef writes explicitly that it is permitted in Yalkut Yosef YD 182:11). It seems very reasonable to assume that if one has some reason to perform a circumcision, (<a href=\"https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/newborn-male-circumcision.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a procedure whose merits can be argued (at least in certain cases) on health grounds</a>) that it wouldn't be considered a wound at least for a Jew. The parameters of wounding for a non-Jew may or may not be identical. It is difficult to know, since almost no sources indicate that it exists at all). </p>\n\n<p>In summary, the answer to: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is this his rhetoric, or is this discussed anywhere in Jewish literature?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is 'yes'.</p>\n\n<p>In the main elements of the question: that non-Jews are prohibited from injuring themselves and that circumcision counts as a forbidden injury are indeed found in Jewish literature. However both points appear to be minority views. Whether or not referencing an obscure writer and ignoring the views of classical writers can be considered \"rhetoric\" is up to you to decide.</p>\n\n\n",

That is why when there were too many murderers in the land, they moved from the Lishka so they wouldn't have to kill too much (the reason is unclear, perhaps they were afraid of the Roman empire, or because they didn't want to kill so many people as we will see later). In any case, it is clear that Dinei Nefashos cannot be applied only through a proper Sanhedrin in its proper place!</p>\n\n<p>Then there is the other problem with Semicha. The ruling body of the Sanhedrin needs to be ordained by others who were themselves ordained.... til Moshe Rabeinu (see rambam hilchos sanhedrin 4:1). Semicha is lost to us since the times of the Chachmei hatalmud when it fell into disuse, and since then was never recovered.</p>\n\n<p>As for your other question why Chazal were against killing too many murderers? from the Mishna in Makkot (7a) it is evident that Chazal had an aversion to the death penalty and thus tried to limit it as much as possible. R Akiva was so reluctant to apply the death penalty that he declares that had he been in the Sanhedrin no one would've been killed (by finding loopholes as described in the Gemara). By adding lots of Dinim and requirements (see Sanhedrin 40b) as to when the Sanhedrin is allowed to kill they effectively limited the Dinei Nefashos. But as i already said that is not \"the\" reason we don't do Dinei Nefasos anymore. It is because we don't have Sanhedrin!  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a woman lead davening/bentching in a family setting?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can a woman lead davening or bentching (zimmun) if all the people present are her immediate family? Or is it assur? I understand that it would for sure be assur if the people were not her family. </p>\n\n<p>As for the zimmun, there would be three men present.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a discussion in a number of places when women form their own <em>zimmun</em>,  if men (less than a <em>zimmun</em>) can remain and answer or not.  That is, if there are one or two men present, then there is a question if they can remain and answer the (three or more) women or not. However, if there are three or more men present (as well as three or more women), then the men must form their own <em>zimmun</em> and the women <strong>are allowed</strong> to form their own <em>zimmun</em>. If there is a minyan of men present, then the women must join the men. There are other commentaries on the matter, but the majority appears to be that an individual woman cannot lead a <em>zimmun</em> <strong>unless</strong> the men are too ignorant to be able to say birchat hamazon themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The citations below imply that a woman <strong>cannot</strong> lead a <em>mezuman</em> of men. The individual articles are too long to summarize completely, so I have just included the conclusions. I have also shown the halachos as the Rambam brings them down.</p>\n\n<p>I also saw in the cited articles, that since ten women do not form a minyan, then they cannot add the <em>extra</em> word <em>elokeinu</em> and must join with the ten men, rather than form their own <em>zimmun</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Mishna Brurah Orach Chaim 199 No. 16</em> explains that it is a reshus for three women to join together and not a chov. This is also a reason why a woman cannot lead a <em>zimmun</em> of men.</p>\n\n<p>A summary of this can be seen in <a href=\"http://www.kolhamevaser.com/2012/02/womens-zimmun-an-addendum/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Women’s Zimmun: An Addendum</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What remains clear from all of these sources is that, at the very\n  least, women can form a zimmun; according to many, they are in fact\n  obligated in zimmun. Despite the simple understanding of Berakhot 45b,\n  Halakhah does not permit women to be counted with men to make up the\n  requisite number for a zimmun of three or ten. A woman who eats with\n  three men must remain and share in the zimmun obligation by answering\n  with the men’s zimmun. Women may, however, separate from presence of a\n  men’s zimmun and perform their own, provided that there are fewer than\n  ten men present. Although there are many rishonim who maintain that\n  women have an obligation in zimmun, normative Halakhah has not adopted\n  this view. Nonetheless, zimmun provides an easy opportunity to perform\n  a mitsvah and find greater meaning in Jewish practice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can see this from the Rambam who explicitly says.</p>\n\n<p>As an example <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/927673/jewish/Berachot-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Holchos Berachos chapter five</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Halacha 1</em> Women and slaves are obligated to recite grace. There is a doubt whether their obligation stems from the Torah, since [this is a\n  positive mitzvah] that is not linked to a specific time, or whether\n  their obligation does not stem from the Torah. Therefore, they should\n  not fulfill the obligation of grace on behalf of others.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Halacha 7</em> Women, servants, and children are not included in a zimmun.\n  They may, however, make a zimmun among themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.edah.org/backend/coldfusion/search/document.cfm?title=%27Women%C2%92s%20Zimmun%20and%20Whether%20Men%20%5BWho%20Are%20Present%5D%20Must%20Leave%27&hyperlink=womenzimmun.htm&type=Document&category=Women%20in%20Halachah&authortitle=Rabbi&*QUERYSTRINGPII_REMOVED*&*QUERYSTRINGPII_REMOVED*&pubsource=She%27Elot%20UTeshuvot%20Bnei%20Banim%2C%20Volume%203%2C%20Number%201&authorid=351\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Women’s Zimmun and Whether Men [Who Are Present] Must Leave</a> goes into detail on the subject. This article is too long to give all the details. However, the final summary and conclusion of this article is ...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The result [of all this] is, in my opinion: According to our [the\n  accepted] halakhic ruling that women are only doubtfully [biblically]\n  obligated in birkat ha’mazon, then the stated reason of licentiousness\n  does not refer to the joining together of men and women – unlike the\n  Ritva’s opinion; and since the Sefer Ha’Meorot and the Ohel Moed\n  permit [a man to say the zimmun for women], and we do not find anyone\n  who prohibits this besides the Ritva -- therefore, we can conclude\n  that it is permissible for a man who dined with three women to fulfill\n  their obligation in zimmun for them. The halakhic results, in my\n  opinion, are as follows: (1) One woman and two men, or the opposite\n  [one man and two women] do not join together for zimmun. (2) If three\n  women ate with one or two men, then the women recite the zimmun\n  together and the men may answer, or a man may recite the zimmun to\n  fulfill the women’s obligation. (3) Three women who ate with three men\n  fulfill their obligation through the zimmun of the men, or they may\n  separate and recite a zimmun for themselves provided there are less\n  than ten men. If there are ten men, the men recite the zimmun ba’Shem\n  and the women respond. (4) One woman who ate with three men may not\n  recite the zimmun to fulfill their obligation, but she fulfills her\n  own obligation through the men’s zimmun. (5) Ten women may not recite\n  the zimmun ba’Shem [extended form of zimmun said in the presence of a\n  minyan], in accordance with the ruling of the Rambam and the Shulhan\n  Arukh, and not in accordance with the opinion of the Sefer Ha’Meorot;\n  and also a man who is saying the zimmun for ten women should not\n  recite the zimmun ba’Shem. (6) Women have the option of reciting the\n  zimmun for themselves, and a woman who is not accustomed to doing so\n  is still permitted to say the zimmun; if she followed this custom\n  three times in succession, not counting meals where women were not\n  present [separately] to form a zimmun, then she has established a\n  [permanent] obligation for herself if she did not make a condition\n  that she is saying the zimmun b’li neder [\"without a vow\" for the\n  future].</p>\n  \n  <p>Yehuda Herzl Henkin</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.199.7?lang=bi&with=Biur%20Halacha&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O Ch 199 (7) and the Biur Halocho ויוצאות בזמון שלנו </a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נָשִׁים מְזַמְּנוֹת לְעַצְמָן, רְשׁוּת. אֲבָל כְּשֶׁאוֹכְלוֹת עִם\n  הָאֲנָשִׁים, חַיָּבוֹת וְיוֹצְאוֹת בַּזִּמּוּן שֶׁלָּנוּ. </p>\n  \n  <p>Biur Halocho<br>\n  <strong>ויוצאות בזמון שלנו</strong> - ומשמע מדברי היד הקטנה דהיא אסורה\n  לברך ברכת הזימון ולהוציא את האנשים אלא שצריכה לשמוע ולצאת מהזימון\n  שמברכין האנשים: </p>\n  \n  <p>Women may make zimmun together but when they eat with men, they are\n  obliged to be included in zimmun and do their duty through the zimmun\n  of the men. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Biur Halocho: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and do their duty through the zimmun of the men</strong> - and from the Yad Ketana we see that they may not make zimmun and acquit men of their\n  obligation but they must listen and fulfill their duty through\n  listening to the men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that a woman cannot lead zimmun for men.

Maybe Maimonides believed that the Resurrection of the Righteous won't happen in the Resurrection Era? Will the resurrections will begin immediately after Moshiach's arrival or after an unspecified period of time?\nOr maybe there will be two resurrection periods, one for the righteous and one other  for the rest? Leshem seems to think that the resurrection period will be one but, simply, the righteous will be the first to resurrect in that period. Can someone bring more sources?

However I'm trying to find a \"proof\" for either this reasoning or the other side of the argument.)</p>\n\n<p>The reason why they wouldn't need to pray again is because even though chazal required a special request in this bracha, that's only during the winter where we need rain and for the rest of the year we only ask for \"bracha\" which was really already said at the beginning of the bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a proof for this question either way?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(1) I realize that not everyone says \"v'sain bracha\". However having looked at many nuschos (including the famous \"Nusach Eretz Yisrael\") I see that in this bracha there is a special nusach for the summer months and special nusach for the winter months.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As a straight Halakhic argument, it's clear that \"ותן ברכה\" isn't needed from these two sources:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x255\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur (OC 117)</a> supports the usage of \"ותן ברכה\" with no reference to dew from the fact that the Bavli speaks of adding in a request for rain in the winter, which implies there is no expected special request in the summer. Clearly \"ותן ברכה\" is not a special necessary request.</p></li>\n<li><p>The summary of the 9th blessing of the Amida in the shortened Havinenu prayer is ודשננו בנאות ארצך and while the Bavli (Berakhot 29a) wonders about adding \"ותן טל ומטר לברכה\" in the winter, it never wonders about adding \"ותן ברכה\" in the summer. (This is especially noteworthy as the Yerushalmi does propose an addition about dew for the summertime.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>From a comparative Nusach perspective, it's also obvious that it's not needed since the majority of Jews don't say it. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%97_%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%97#.D7.AA.D7.A4.D7.99.D7.9C.D7.AA_.D7.A2.D7.9E.D7.99.D7.93.D7.94_2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefardim</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1508042/jewish/Order-of-Prayers-Text-of-the-Blessings-of-Shemoneh-Esreh.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yemenites</a> all have a different version of the blessing which does not include anything resembling \"ותן ברכה\", though it does have a different request for dew. Italians to this day say \"ותן טל לברכה\" and such was also said in old Nusach <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9377&st=&pgnum=274&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzorfat</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14615&st=&pgnum=27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Provence</a>. Bukharians have a line at the end \"ותן ברכה והצלחה בכל מעשה ידינו\" (cf. Ta'anit 8b and Devarim 28:12) but not \"ותן ברכה\" on the land. In fact, if you look at the oldest Babylonian Nusach (ie. one which doesn't request dew in the summer), that <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20685&st=&pgnum=77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">of Rav Saadya Gaon</a>, you'll expect to find a precursor of the Ashkenazi practice mentioned in the Tur (not requesting dew by just saying \"vetein berakha\") but instead you'll see he simply skips the line entirely: ברך עלינו יי אלהינו את השנה הזאת לטובה בכל מיני תבואתה וברכה כשנים הטובות בא״י מברך השנים. Thus, it's basically impossible to say that \"ותן ברכה\" is an essential component of the blessing since nearly no one has it, and in the worst case you are essentially just saying the Nusach of Rav Saadya Gaon which ought be no worse than any other Nusach change Bedieved.</p>\n\n<p>Finally we have to wonder, if \"ותן ברכה\" is really a specific essential request, then <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/80103/759\">what at all is it a request for?</a> Without compelling answers to that, the clear allusion to a description/request for precipitation (Kings 1:18:1 or Job 5:10), and the evidence from Rav Saadya Gaon, we have to consider the possibility that \"ותן ברכה\" isn't even an \"original\" phrase at all, but just somebody's way of adapting \"ותן טל לברכה\" to a rite that didn't request dew in the summer.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there a \"second chance\" afforded by sincere repentance for EVERY sin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If I summarize your questions to \"does Teshuva always erase all traces of a sin?\", the answer seems to be \"no, according to the Mishna in Chagiga and Rashi.\" Here are 3 cases:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>A missed Mitzva</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Mishna in Chagiga (<a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01139.html#HtmpReportNum0014_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">9a</a>) mentions sins that leave a trace. Based on the verse in Koheleth (<a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00792.html#HtmpReportNum0000_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:15</a>) that says  מְעֻוָּת לֹא יוּכַל לִתְקֹן וְחֶסְרוֹן לֹא יוּכַל לְהִמָּנוֹת - something deformed that cannot be fixed, and something missing that cannot be replaced.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna brings this with regards to somebody who didn't bring that Chagiga sacrifice during the Chag; once the Chag is over, he can no longer make amends; he has lost the opportunity to do the Mitzva.</p>\n\n<p>While this isn't an active sin, it's a missed Mitzva. <strong>The Mishna seems to imply there is no way to make amends for a missed Mitzva.</strong><br/><br/></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Leaving behind physical evidence</strong> </p>\n\n<p>R' Shimon ben Menasya says that the verse refers to having illicit relationships from which a Mamzer is born.

(As opposed to sins like theft for which one can make monetary reparations.) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>נטרד מן העולם</strong>. אין לו עוד תשובה לפי שעשה דבר שאין לו רפואה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi seems to say that <strong>Teshuva can't change reality, and therefore cannot be effective if the sin cannot be remedied</strong>, like causing a divorce. Assumedly this would apply to murder also.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>IIRC, there are more cases, like missing a Tefila, that are considered something missing that cannot be replaced. And the Mishna seems to bring Rashbi who may be presenting another case: a Talmid Chacham who abandons his learning.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the relevant snippets of the Gemara:</p>\n\n<p>Chagiga 9a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מתני'</strong> מי שלא חג ביו''ט הראשון של חג חוגג את כל הרגל ויו''ט האחרון של חג עבר הרגל ולא חג אינו חייב באחריותו על זה נאמר {קהלת א-טו} מעוות לא יוכל לתקון וחסרון לא יוכל להמנות <br/>‏<strong>ר' שמעון בן מנסייא</strong> אומר איזהו מעוות שאינו יכול להתקן זה הבא על הערוה והוליד ממנה ממזר א''ת בגונב וגוזל יכול הוא להחזירו ויתקן <br/>‏<strong>ר''ש בן יוחי</strong> אומר אין קורין מעוות אלא למי שהיה מתוקן בתחילה ונתעוות ואיזה זה תלמיד חכם הפורש מן התורה:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מתני' מי שלא חג</strong>. שלא הביא חגיגתו ביום הראשון של חג: ויו''ט האחרון של חג. חוגג שמיני עצרת ואע''ג דרגל בפני עצמו הוא הוי תשלומין לראשון: <strong>והוליד ממזר</strong>. שהביא פסולין בישראל ויהא זכרון לפיכך אין עונותיו נמחקין בתשובה: <strong>יכול להחזיר</strong>. דמי גניבתו וגזלתו לבעלים: <strong>ויתקן</strong>. ויהא מתוקן מן החטא: <strong>מעוות</strong>. מקולקל:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosafoth: (I'm not sure he agrees)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>זה הבא על הערוה</strong>. דטפי בושתו ניכר שהממזר נראה לעולם אבל שאר עבירות רוצח וגזלן אין עדיו לפניו. דטפי בושתו ניכר שהממזר נראה לעולם אבל שאר עבירות רוצח וגזלן אין עדיו לפניו‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gemara 9b</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' שמעון בן מנסיא אומר אי זה הוא מעוות לא יוכל לתקון זה הבא על הערוה והוליד ממנה ממזר וכו': הוליד אין לא הוליד לא והא תניא רבי שמעון בן מנסיא אומר גונב אדם אפשר שיחזיר גנבו ויתקן גוזל אדם אפשר שיחזיר גזלו ויתקן אבל הבא על אשת איש ואסרה לבעלה נטרד מן העולם והלך לו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>:נטרד מן העולם</strong>. אין לו עוד תשובה לפי שעשה דבר שאין לו רפואה\n  <br/>\n  <strong>באשת איש</strong>. בלא הוליד נמי יש זכרון לעונו שאסרה על בעלה לא שנא אחותו ולא שנא נכרית: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Maimonides pretty much devotes his <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911888/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">entire first chapter of the Laws of Repentance</a> to your question (particularly law 4).  Basically, the short answer is: no. In fact, according to Maimonides, <em>teshuva</em> alone only atones for violations of most positive commandments, not biblical prohibitions. When the Temple and/or Sanhedrin are around, <em>teshuva</em> acts as a necessary co-requisite with biblically mandated offerings or punishments.  Without the Temple and Sanhedrin, Yom Kippur, suffering, and/or death are necessary to atone for violations of most commandments.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ד</strong>\n  אע\"פ שהתשובה מכפרת על הכל ועצמו של יוה\"כ מכפר יש עבירות שהן מתכפרים לשעתן ויש עבירות שאין מתכפרים אלא לאחר זמן כיצד עבר אדם על מצות עשה שאין בה כרת ועשה תשובה אינו זז משם עד שמוחלין לו ובאלו נאמר שובו בנים שובבים ארפא משובותיכם וגו' עבר על מצות לא תעשה שאין בה כרת ולא מיתת בית דין ועשה תשובה תשובה תולה ויום הכפורים מכפר ובאלו נאמר כי ביום הזה יכפר עליכם עבר על כריתות ומיתות בית דין ועשה תשובה תשובה ויוה\"כ תולין ויסורין הבאין עליו גומרין לו הכפרה ולעולם אין מתכפר לו כפרה גמורה עד שיבואו עליו יסורין ובאלו נאמר ופקדתי בשבט פשעם ובנגעים עונם במה דברים אמורים בשלא חילל את השם בשעה שעבר אבל המחלל את השם אע\"פ שעשה תשובה והגיע יום הכפורים והוא עומד בתשובתו ובאו עליו יסורין אינו מתכפר לו כפרה גמורה עד שימות אלא תשובה יוה\"כ ויסורין שלשתן תולין ומיתה מכפרת שנאמר ונגלה באזני ה' צבאות וגו' אם יכופר העון הזה לכם עד תמותון: </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>4</strong> Even though Teshuvah atones for all [sins] and the essence of Yom\n  Kippur brings atonement, [there are different levels of sin and hence,\n  differences in the degree of atonement.] There are sins that can be\n  atoned for immediately and other sins which can only be atoned for\n  over the course of time. What is implied?</p>\n  \n  <p>If a person violates a positive command which is not punishable by\n  karet and repents, he will not leave that place before he is forgiven.\n  Concerning these sins, [Jeremiah 3:22] states: \"Return, faithless\n  children! I will heal your rebellious acts.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>If a person violates a prohibition that is not punishable by karet or\n  execution by the court and repents, Teshuvah has a tentative effect\n  and Yom Kippur brings atonement as [Leviticus, loc. cit. states \"This\n  day will atone for you.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>If a person violates [sins punishable by] karet or execution by the\n  court and repents, Teshuvah and Yom Kippur have a tentative effect and\n  the sufferings which come upon him complete the atonement. He will\n  never achieve complete atonement until he endures suffering for\n  concerning these [sins, Psalms 89:33] states: \"I will punish their\n  transgression with a rod.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>When does the above apply: When the desecration of God's name is not\n  involved in the transgression. However, a person who desecrated God's\n  name, even though he repented, Yom Kippur arrived while he continued\n  his repentance, and he experienced suffering, will not be granted\n  complete atonement until he dies. The three: repentance, Yom Kippur,\n  and suffering have a tentative effect and death atones as [Isaiah\n  22:14] states: \"It was revealed in my ears [by] the Lord of Hosts,\n  surely this iniquity will not be atoned for until you die.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Over and above the concept of <em>Adam Muad Leolam</em>. This means that even if halacha were to say <em>patur</em> in a particular case, the fact that a person gets a drivers license and insurance, means that he is <strong>voluntarily</strong> subjecting himself to the secular law of the state. </p>\n\n<p>In the case of dozing behind the wheel, one <strong>can</strong> argue that he is chayav galus for an accidental <strong>death</strong> which would be subject to <em>kam leh b’drabbah mineih</em>. Indeed, the argument can be expanded to consider him a <em>Rodef</em> and <em>chayav misa</em> from the time he falls asleep until he is stopped after the accident. In that case <em>kam leh b’drabbah mineih</em> <strong>could</strong> apply, though the argument can also be made that as long as he has not caused a death, this would not apply. Additionally, one can argue that having <strong>voluntarily</strong> submitted himself the the traffic laws of the country, he would be chayav for damages under that category of halacha and therefore not subject to <em>kam leh b’drabbah mineih</em> (in this particular case).</p>\n\n<p>[A Driver’s Liability in Halacha and Civil Law](<a href=\"http://matzav.com/a-drivers-liability-in-halacha-and-civil-law-rav-mendel-shafran-and-the-dan-bus-company/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://matzav.com/a-drivers-liability-in-halacha-and-civil-law-rav-mendel-shafran-and-the-dan-bus-company/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Mishnah Bava Kama 26a teaches:</p>\n  \n  <p>“Adam muad l’olam, bein shogeg bein meizid, bein er bein yashen. A\n  person has liability for all of his actions, both accidental, and\n  intentional” Consequently, one is liable for damage caused through\n  unsafe driving and Halachah clearly deals with damages caused by users\n  of the public thoroughfare as will be discussed below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition to this, the concept of <em>dina demalchusa</em> also applies.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In addition, under American Law, driving is a privilege not a right.\n  Each state allows a driver to use  public roads on the condition that\n  he agrees to abide by all applicable traffic laws. Thus, it may be\n  argued that by driving on public roads, one submits himself to these\n  laws, and agrees to pay for damages he inflicts according to the law\n  of the land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the very fact that one is required to get insurance and a drivers license, means that he has submitted himself to the laws of the country as far as his ability to drive <strong>at all</strong> is concerned.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Furthermore the halachos of damages inflicted through car accidents\n  are dependent on whether the mazik – damager and nizak – damaged party\n  were acting “birshus” or “not birshus” (permitted and predictable\n  manner or in a unpredictable manner). Traffic laws play an important\n  role in determining what is considered birshus</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we see</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Accidents caused by the violation of traffic laws are the most common\n  instance of negligence-per-se. For example, from a legal standpoint it\n  is easy to prove the liability of one who rear-ends another vehicle\n  while following the other vehicle too closely. Similarly, one will\n  likely be liable for damages caused while speeding.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Halachah incorporates a concept similar to negligence-per-se as\n  well. One who causes damage in the public thoroughfare while acting in\n  an unanticipated manner will be liable, provided that the damaged\n  party was not behaving in an unusual or unanticipated manner. See\n  Shulchan Aruch C.M. 378-8 which rules that one who damages his fellow\n  while running in the public domain will be liable if he damaged\n  someone who was not running.</p>\n  \n  <p>While the Halachos of the Shulchan Aruch operate independently of\n  secular law,  applicable traffic laws define what constitutes an act\n  that is Birshus and what is Shelo birshus on the roads. <strong>In essence the\n  traffic laws dictate what is considered normal behavior on the roads.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another point would be if he is chayav misa or galus for a death caused by his actions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It bears mentioning that, according to Halachah, if one were acting in\n  a manner that was completely reckless, to the point of being a danger\n  to life, he takes on the status of being a <em>Rodef</em>. As a <em>Rodef</em> he is\n  considered <em>chayav misa</em> for the duration of time that his actions\n  present a direct threat to the lives of others. In this case the\n  principle of <em>kam leh b’drabbah mineih</em> applies. If the matter were\n  being tried in a Halachic court he would essentially not be liable for\n  damages incurred during this time because he faced the possibility of\n  capital punishment. However, there are opinions that <em>kam lei b’drabbah\n  mineih</em> does not apply in this situation because when one gets behind\n  the wheel on today’s public roads he accepts upon himself all the\n  rules of the road which would include the liabilities applicable under\n  secular law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef (יביע אומר חלק ט חושן משפט ה)  wrote about the liability of a driver who fell asleep behind the wheel and caused serious injuries to the passengers. </p>\n\n<p>He invokes the Talmudic concept of techila'so b'p'shiah v'sofo b'ones that a person whose negligence brought on a situation where the damage was beyond his control is still liable. Similarly, when the driver dozed off, it was obviously unintentional and beyond his control. However, getting behind the wheel with the knowledge that he had not sufficiently slept the night before is clearly negligent. Therefore, based on this concept, the driver's dozing off is viewed as negligence.\" </p>\n\n<p>A ruling of the Ohr zaruah, supports this approach. The Ohr Zaruah ruled that a man who fell asleep on the job and allowed the item he was to be guarding to be stolen is considered negligent and liable. He explains that while fall a may be uncontrollable, the watchman knew that his job was to be awake and should have sufficiently slept before. Similarly, Rav Ovadia points out that the driver should have also made sure to have sufficient sleep before getting behind the wheel. Therefore, he is considered negligent and is liable for damages.</p>\n\n<p>While falling asleep may be out of a person's control, it is only if the situation was unavoidable. However, if a person has the ability to avoid the situation where falling asleep could cause damage or death, he is fully responsible for his actions</p>\n\n<p><strong>Based on <a href=\"http://mosaicapress.com/healing-in-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Healing in Halacha</a> Page 107</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also available <a href=\"http://www.thehalachacenter.org/journal-links/5775/bamidbar/behaaloscha/texting-talking-and-driving-a-dangerous-combination.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Differences of Timing of Se'udah for Brit and Pidyon Haben\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Last night, I attended a <em>pidyon haben</em> - a somewhat rare occasion to attend because of various \"regulations\" on who qualifies for a pidyon.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed during the approximately 10 times I have attended a pidyon that the <em>seudah</em> (meal) for a pidyon occurs before the actual <em>pidyon</em> ceremony. I know, whereas, for a brit, that the <em>seudah</em> takes place after the brit. Why is there this difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <em>sefer</em> <strong>Pidyon HaBen KeHilchaso</strong> 8:37 brings two customs. One is as you described.</p>\n\n<p>The custom of starting the meal first and then performing the <em>pidyon haben</em> is brought by the <strong>Maharil</strong>, <strong>Shu\"t Mahari Bruna</strong> § 121, <strong>Be'er HaGoleh</strong> 305:10, <strong>Migdal Oz</strong> 9:5, and <strong>Chochmas Adam</strong> 150:7, amongst others.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Mahari Bruna</strong> gives the following reason for the custom: If the <em>pidyon haben</em> is done before the meal, there won't be a publicization of the <em>pidyon</em>, which is the whole point of the meal. It's also brought there to specifically break bread, do the <em>pidyon</em>, and only then continue the meal. The <strong>Mahari Bruna</strong> says this is to make the remainder of the meal part of the <em>seudas mitzvah</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pidyon HaBen KeHilchaso</strong> says there are more reasons brought in <strong>Likutei Pinchas</strong> § 53. There we find three other explanations (see there for the sources):</p>\n\n<p>One is that the firstborns were saved from the Tenth Plague in Egypt at Midnight, while they were in the middle of their <em>Pesach seder</em> meal. Since they already started the meal, so too we start the meal before the <em>pidyon haben</em>, which is connected to the firstborns being saved.</p>\n\n<p>Another is that the 10 Tribes sold Yosef after sitting down to eat a meal (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.25?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 37:25</a>), and the amount of money that a <em>pidyon haben</em> requires is the same as what they sold him for (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.28?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>ibid</em> v. 28</a> says 20 silver coins, which is 5 <em>selaim</em> X 4 <em>dinarim</em>, see <strong>Rabbeinu Bachaye</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.28?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.37.28.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad. loc.</a>). Since <em>pidyon haben</em> is a redemption for their sin, and they sold him after they started their meal, we do the same.</p>\n\n<p>A third explanation addresses your very issue: why is the meal only after a <em>bris</em> yet by <em>pidyon haben</em> the meal starts first. He says that a person can't eat the <em>korbon Pesach</em> until they first had a <em>bris milah</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.48?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 12:48</a>). So the <em>bris milah</em> precedes the meal. However, the <em>korbon Pesach</em> has to be eaten before Midnight. Since Midnight is when the firstborns were saved (as stated above), and the meal was already finished, we start the meal before the <em>pidyon haben</em>. According to this, it would be best to finish the meal before the <em>pidyon haben</em>, but there's a concern people will get drunk and forget the laws. Therefore it was established to have the <em>pidyon haben</em> at the beginning of the meal.</p>\n\n\n",

If the pillar never actually existed and Josephus was lying and/or mistaken on this point, that is, of course, an answer!</p>\n\n<p>As suggested by @mevaqesh, I am looking for any Jewish sources that discuss the idea that the family of Seth constructed a monument of stone to preserve pre-Flood knowledge for the benefit of those living after the Flood. A source could be a commentary on Josephus, but could also be an independent source that discusses the concept or idea or even an older source that Josephus summarized in his book.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware that this passage is sometimes cited by fringe archaeologists and fringe historians as evidence of their theories, but I am interested in how <em>Judaism</em> understands or has understood this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are a couple of questions here to respond to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Regarding the fate of the tablets, as you cited from Josephus, it \"remains in the land of Siriad to this day.\" To my limited knowledge we don't have other testimony to its fate. In Louis Ginzberg's reference of this quote (Legends Of The Jews, vol. V p.150) he paraphrases that \"these tablets with their Hebrew characters could still be seen on some island in India in the time of Alexander the Great.\" The latter may have been referring to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Surat</a> (\"בארץ סיריד\"?)*. </li>\n<li>On the face of things one would not suspect Josephus of \"lying and/or mistaken on this point\" since the legend of a fiery deluge, which occasioned the erection of the tablets, was also reported by his slightly younger contemporary, Philo (The Life Of Moses, <a href=\"http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book25.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Part II Ch. 48</a>) as well as in the (contemporaneous) Vita Adæ et Evæ (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/apo/adamnev.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ch. 59</a> with some differences in the legend; for a description of the book see <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/759-adam-book-of\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>). However, after a close and critical analysis of the sources Prof. Louis Ginzberg demonstrates (Mabul Shel Eshh, HaGoren 1912, reprinted in Al Halachah VeAggadah, Tel Aviv 1960, 205ff.) that Josephus conflated two legends, the inscribing of the tablets & the fire deluge, thence details were tweaked to fit the storyline and ultimately assumed a Jewish identity. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>*The legend about the tablets Ginzberg traces to the chronicle of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berossus\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berossus</a> the Chaldean. In the latter's version of the event, it is stated that after the flood the tablets were found \"בעיר סיפרא\", the same place where they were instructed beforehand to be buried at. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Could Isaiah 19:19-20 be related to this pillar?  Pyramids are also called pillars and trees (which are books). Giza means border. Great Pyramid of Giza has unacknowledged builder as it was pre-flood of Noah. Probably Enoch and/or his sons according to C. Staniland Wake in his Great Pyramid book from 1880's. It is also said (think it was Plato? Or maybe Mad Arab?) that there were once writings on the lower outer white limestone casing stones (now gone) and that a learned man of 110 (or maybe 120?) came from Canaan and taught them the meaning of the words on the pyramid because it was his family's language.  Abram, a wandering Aramian, visited Egypt seeking a city at this same age. I'm commenting from memory of books read over many years so hope this will lead to others filling in the details.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I was reading this passage from Antiquities last night as translated by Sefaria, and found myself googling today. I was struck by the fact that Josephus states the pillars are still standing in his day. Josephus is known to prize historically acuracy and it seems unlikely he would indicate  something exists that could easily be shown to not exist in his own time. However, as discussed here and in Thomas Churton's Lost Pillars of Enoch, the pillar's whereabouts are not known.<br />\nEntering the internet rabbit hole, I learned about the town of Sisian located in southern Armenia today. I was struck by the similarity in sound to Siriad. Amazingly, I learned of Zorats Karer, often referred to as the Armenian Stonhenge. Wikipedia cites a 2000 South Armenian survey evidencing Hellenistic settlement nearby. <a href=\"http://www.biainili-urartu.de/Armenia/2000/Armenia-2000-Eng.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.biainili-urartu.de/Armenia/2000/Armenia-2000-Eng.html</a>.<br />\nThis chat is all could find actively discussing the topic. So, I felt compelled to share. Could these prehistoric Bronze Age pillars of Zorats Kara or the very nearby Godedzor pillars be what Josephus is referencing?<br />\nIt is theorized that they were built to preserve astronomical knowledge,and that is precisely what Josephus describes, erected in a commensurate time of Enoch according to our Jewish calendars.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems to mean \"remembrance\" (gleaning that from Rash\"i's translation.) However, another word used to mean remembrance is זכרון .</p>\n\n<p>I ran a word search on אזכרה and related forms to see where this appears in Tana\"ch. Indeed, it is rare.

In fact, he says that the concept of אזכרה is the whole purpose of the Mincha offering.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the term אזכרה refers, in this verse, specifically to the handful of the offering that is to be burnt on the Altar. As the אזכרה, the handful stands in as the representative of the whole offering. From the way the verse is phrased, R' Hirsch infers (in a way I don't quite follow) that the whole offering is in the same way an אזכרה - a small subset that symbolically stands in for something larger. In particular, the flour, oil, and spice of the offering represent all of the material resources we need and have for, respectively, survival, comfort, and satisfaction.</p>\n\n<p>The אזכרה function this offering performs is to get God to \"remember\" or apply \"special care and attention\" to that which it represents. That is, by offering the Mincha, we are praying to God to pay special attention to our physical needs. In so doing, we are acknowledging that for everything we need on every level, we are utterly dependent on God.</p>\n\n<p>Based on all this, I think we can understand אזכרה as something like \"a representative portion of a whole, which is used to pray for special attention to be payed to the whole.\" The remembrance/attention aspect is also present in the term זכרון. (Indeed, in this comment, R' Hirsch calls the אזכרה a \"זכרון לפני ה\".) However, I think the aspect of a part that stands in for the whole for this memorial purpose is unique to אזכרה.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does a killer with permission lose his צלם אלקים?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Haamek Davar</em> (ad loc.) explains that צלם אלקים (in Genesis 1:26–27) refers to an angel, also called a person's מזל, which envelops each of us and protects him from harm. He (to 4:14) explains further that \"ההורג נפש אפי׳ בשגגה אובד צלמו\", someone who kills a person, even accidentally, loses that צלם אלקים‎.<sup>[1]</sup> Does the same apply to someone who kills a person with permission, or even who is required to do so? (Some examples may include a soldier in battle, a king killing a rebel, an agent of a court executing a criminal, or someone acting in self-defense. But don't get hung up on my examples: I'm asking about any case in which someone was allowed to kill a person.) (On the one hand, he doesn't explicate that such are excluded from his rule; on the other, he only says \"בשגגה\", by accident; on the third, שגגה, accident was the context there, so maybe he didn't mean to exclude cases like those in asking about. Also, on the one hand, maybe the very act of killing a human is what caused the loss of one's angel; on the other, maybe it's the fault involved; or maybe it's something else.) Knowing what others who hold a killer loses his צלם אלקים or מזל hold about a killer with permission would be satisfactory, since the <em>Haamek Davar</em> author himself may not address the issue.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>[1] I don't quote here his entire commentary to 4:14, but it clarifies that the quotation above is referring to the צלם אלקים as in 1:26–27.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Why tuft of hair at all as opposed to any other siman?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You are referring to Shulchan Aruch OC 32:44</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קְצָת שֵׂעָר זֶה צָרִיךְ שֶׁיֵּרָאֶה חוּץ לַבָּתִּים. </p>\n  \n  <p>A little bit of this hair needs to be visible from the outside of the compartments. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The SA doesn't explain why.</p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham Seif Katan 61 writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתב של\"ה דף קי\"ו י\"א שהשער צריך לצאת מפרשת קדש ואני קבלתי מפ' והיה אם שמוע ונ\"ל שטוב להניחם אצל פ' והיה אם שמוע בצד הפונה לפ' קדש עכ\"ל: </p>\n  \n  <p>The Shlah writes: \"The hair needs to emerge out of the compartment with the parsha \"Kadesh\". However​ I have a tradition I received that it should emerge from the parsha of \"Vehaya Im Shamoah\", and it appears to me it's good to place the hair next to parshas \"Vehaya Im Shamoah\" on the side towards parshas \"Kadesh\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not sure where the SA got the halacha from (I don't have access to the Beis Yosef), but the discussion about where it should come out from seemingly is related to Kabbalah. First, he's quoting the Shlah, a sefer with a lot of Kabbalistic teachings. As well, the MA quotes the Zohar, saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא יצא השער כשעורה חוץ לבתים</p>\n  \n  <p>The hair protruding from the boxes shouldn't be the size of a grain of barley</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps the SA got this halacha from the Zohar. Either way there is no mention of using it to distinguish between Rashi and RT tefillin.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless it can be used as a Siman to distinguish them, since depending on which tefillin you are using is where the hair will come out from. It doesn't seem to be the motivation, as your question suggests, yet it does end up serving that purpose.</p>\n\n\n",

Does the Gemara elsewhere ever fault her explicitly for this? If not, why not, as she was already commanded in it (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.58a.7-8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 58a</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 2:24</a>).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are two possible issues here:</p>\n\n<p>1) Did Chava commit adultery against Adam by having relations with the snake?</p>\n\n<p>2) Did Chava commit bestiality by having relations with the snake?</p>\n\n<p>Now of course she did commit these things according to Gem' A\"Z 22b. However, the question is if she can be faulted for breaking the law when she did?</p>\n\n<p>1) Adultery did not take place since the law of adultery is only broken when the wife cheats with another man, not an animal. In other words, the guy might be a snake, but he has to at least be a guy. Here the snake is simply an animal so adultery doesn't legally count.</p>\n\n<p>2) Bestiality? This may be more complicated, but she seems to not have violated the \"commandment\" of bestiality either.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara on the bottom of Sanhedrin 56a tells us that the sons of Noach were commanded in 7 mitzvos. Sexual transgressions is one of them. The Gemara on 56b then goes on to explain that Genesis 2:16 is the source. Each word is explained by R' Yochonon to apply to one of the 7 in general. In the next verses, Adam names the animals and after meeting Chava says (Gen. 2:23)\"This time\" it is... flesh of my flesh etc. Rashi brings the Gemara of R' Elazar from Yevamos 63a, which explains that the words \"This time\" means that Adam first had relations with the animals in an effort to seek a mate, but it did not satisfy him.</p>\n\n<p>If so, Adam was not phased at all that Hashem had told him the animals were forbidden for relations??!</p>\n\n<p>It certainly seems, that the verse in 2:16 as well as the verse expounded in Sanhedrin 57b and 58a (Gen.2:24) are Drashah to provide sources for prohibiting sexual transgressions for B'nei Noach. However, we do not know when those 7 prohibitions took effect upon Adam and his descendants. They certainly did not all take effect at the moment of the verse, since one of the laws is not to eat the limb from a living animal. This was not in effect until Noach earned the right to eat meat. Therefore Adam was a vegetarian. Also, the verse (2:24) \"Therefore man should leave his father and his mother...\", (which the Gemara explains to forbid one from marrying their mother etc.) does not apply to Adam and Chava, as Adam and Chava had no father or mother!</p>\n\n<p>But we do have the language of the Medrash Rabbah 19:6, on Genesis. \"And they perceived that they were naked: Even the one mitzvah that they had was stripped from them...\"</p>\n\n<p>As we see, Adam and Chava only had 1 mitzvah in the garden, not 7 plus 1.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the verses expounded in the Gemara are sources but do not create prohibitions upon Adam in the garden. Even if you did say that they did create such prohibitions, we do not find anywhere that Hashem warned them what the punishment would be. However, Hashem does warn them about the punishment for eating the fruit. So they only had one mitzvah in the garden.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, The Gemara in Sanhedrin 74b says that Esther was not guilty of having relations with Achashverosh since a woman is considered \"karka olam\" (ground of the world = passive surface) in the act of relations. She is passive and does not perform an act. She could be culpable if she entices the man or if she physically brings the man etc. But if she was passive, then there is no act on her part to make her guilty.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi to Gemara Shabbos 146a says that the fact the snake cohabited with Chava is learned from Gen. 3:13 \"הַנָּחָשׁ הִשִּׁיאַנִי וָאֹכֵל..\" (\"The snake enticed me and I ate.\") Rashi explains that the Hebrew \"hishiani\" is related to \"nisuin\" or marriage. Therefore the word teaches us a drashah for a double meaning. The snake enticed her to eat the fruit, and the snake \"married\" her. Since the verb has the snake doing an act upon her, we can assume that Chava did not wish to perform adultery or bestiality, and was passive or even resisting. If so, she is \"karka olam\" and not responsible.</p>\n\n\n",

Aptekar</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are the laws of the Torah eternal?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Torah is eternal and - since it's Gcd-given - it knows how to keep up with the times.</p>\n\n<p>For example: While electricity wasn't known about until <em>recently</em>, Torah scholars have figured out from the Torah what the laws of electricity are, say for Shabbat observance. Same for space travel, wireless communication, and all modern inventions.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Torah does not <em>change its mind</em> to adapt to new norms that society continuously redefines. The laws are the laws and they need to be kept.</p>\n\n<p>That said, Torah scholars will occasionally forbid (or strongly recommend against) certain things that have become socially taboo. For example, marrying multiple wives is allowed by the Torah but strongly discouraged by the Rabbis in the Western world.</p>\n\n<p>The examples you bring all have the same answer, in essence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Observing Shabbath ---- It is written in Exodus 35:2 that one who does work on Shabbath shall be put to death. Is it followed?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is still in force, but since we don't have a Bet Din as prescribed by the Torah, there is no way to implement it. Only a Bet Din with specific requirements can execute. Technical problem prevent us from implementing this law.</p>\n\n<p>That said, for a person to be executed by Bet Din, he needs to be warned by 2 kosher witnesses that his action will get him executed, and then immediately respond that he is aware of that fact and that he's going to do the crime anyway and then immediately do the crime. </p>\n\n<p>So it was extremely rare for somebody to be actually executed by Bet Din. (That's besides for the extensive cross-examination that Bet Din was required to do.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cursing one's parents --- It is written in Exodus 21:15/17 that one who curses his parents shall be put to death. Will any parent do it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was not up to the parents to kill their kids; only a Bet Din could do that - with the same conditions as mentioned above; warning, witnesses, etc.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Adultery - It is written in Leviticus 20:10 that the adulterer and adulteress shall be put to death, so is it done?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Same story as Shabbat - technical problems prevent us from implementing it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gay relationship - It is written in Leviticus 20:13 that gays/lesbian shall be put to death. So do we follow it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gays who have <em>actual sex with each other</em>: Law is still in force; technical issues prevent it from being implemented, as above.</p>\n\n<p>Lesbians: There is no such a law in Leviticus 20:13 or anywhere else. Though the Rabbis strongly discouraged such behavior. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Excommunication - Do we boycott those that intermarry?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not Torah law, it's a Rabbinic advisory to prevent such behavior. Many communities still shun those who intermarry. Others may find it more productive to keep the lines of communication open.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, any Mitzva requiring a Bet HaMikdash (Temple) cannot be done, since we don't have one. Technical issue; nothing to do with being eternal.</p>\n\n<p>And your last question: <strong>Do we cling to the letter of the law or in the spirit of it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The short answer is <strong>the letter of the law</strong>. But the written Torah without the Oral Torah (documented in the Mishna, Talmud and other places) is only half the story.</p>\n\n<p>So \"an eye for an eye\" is not taken literally; the Oral law teaches us that it means monetary repatriations. It's the letter of the law, once you know what the actual law is.</p>\n\n\n",

From my initial reading of Dikdukai Shai (Shmuel Mandelbaum) it seems that the discrepancy is between the customs of Ashkenaz and Sefardim (see footnote 73 - p.191) I believe that is the reason you'll see differences between Tikun Simanim and Artscroll and others.</p>\n<p>That being said, I have been researching the conclusive details of this elusive issue for many years and have spoken with a great deal of gedolei Torah with nothing to show for it...yet.</p>\n<p>[UPDATE] The word הַלְוִיִּם is always missing a Dagesh.

Even if there is, one could still wonder whether or not in a given case, the benefit outweighs the loss.</p>\n\n<p>Although intuitively, I would strongly assume that there is no benefit in making study artificially difficult, there are some sources that indicate the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding walking to praying in a more distant place, the Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.107a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metsiah 107a</a>) cites R. Yohanan as opining that one is fortunate to have a nearby bathroom, but not a nearby synagogue, since one receives reward for going to a further synagogue. Although he just says that one is fortunate if circumstances leave him in a position where he is forced to walk a greater distance; not that given the choice one should actually walk further.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.22a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 22a</a>) cites an anecdote (apparently approvingly) of someone doing just that; deliberately praying in a further location. Although this is about extra effort expended on prayer, rather than study, it provides some theoretical background for the idea that study too benefits from artificial attempts at making it more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi there (s.v. v'kibbul) summarises the upshot of that passage as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>למדנו שיטריח אדם עצמו במצוה לקבל שכר יותר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which seems to say that there is value in doing a mitsvah in a more difficult way. This would presumably include Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, referring to Torah study in particular, R. Yeshaya di Trani writes in his <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_Rid_on_Megillah_First_Recension.3a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot to Megillah 3a</a>, that the problem with translating Prophets into the vernacular was that it would allow people to learn it without expending as much effort. This would seem to indicate that it is preferable to study Torah in a more difficult manner, even if one would be able to otherwise more easily (he says nothing, for example, about a decreased quality in the study).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, according to the above, it would seem likely that there would be a benefit, even to the point if being preferable, in finding information in a more difficult way, rather than in an easier way.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding whether this Midrash reflects a formal mitsvah with formal parameters, or a mere exhortation, note that the classical <em>monei hamitsvot</em> such as Rassag, Rambam, Ramban, Yereim, Semag, Semak, Hinnukh, and R. Yeroham Fischel Perlow, do not discuss it as even a possible mitsva. Accordingly, it would likely not necessarily have technical parameters and guidelines like an actual mitsvah. Either way, all of the above stands regarding preferences in Torah study options.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Looking up a text on Google or a computer program will usually return the search result very quickly. In terms of efficiency, that is valuable.</p>\n\n<p>If one thinks of <em>toiling in Torah</em> as ones occupation like is found in Shabbat 11a, then doing so is like running an efficient business. The profit margin is high when the expenditure is efficient. Efficient use of time means <em>potentially</em> more of every hour spent has profit.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, when actually going through seforim, one usually sees along the way, other commentaries on the same subject, the context of surrounding material and possible additional references for even deeper understanding that would be missed with the Google search. Although not as efficient in terms of time usage, the return can be much greater. It's like refining ore. The process of refinement is much more thorough so more gold is refined per ton of ore.</p>\n\n<p>Each method is beneficial in its own way. But success in either path is often dependent upon the inherent nature of the individual applying it. Certain individuals are better adapted at one style over the other. So the <em>better choice</em> depends on the capability of that particular individual.</p>\n\n<p>In the final analysis, based upon the concept that כל ישראל ערבים זה לזה as found in ספרא בחוקותי פרק ז, ה, the full benefits of both individual styles are maintained through the unity of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n",

I mean there is a difference between interrupting your <strong>meal</strong> and interrupting your <strong>bircat hamazon</strong>)\nI do not know the answer.</p>\n\n<p>I \"guess\" you will not say the addition as this one is not essential for the normal weekday bircat hamazon except in the rare situation that shabbat has ended during one's prayer (the case one has to interupt his bracha for an urgent reason). But I am not sure at all.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the help.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>At shalosh seudos in our shul we say bircat hamazon with R'tzei because we have not yet davenned Ma'ariv. The main difference can be seen when Sunday is Rosh Chodesh.  Our rabbi's psak is to say R'tzei and not Ya'ale v'yavo before Ma'ariv. </p>\n\n<p>I should emphasize that this psak is because one has not yet started Ma'ariv, even though the clock time for saying ma'ariv has been reached. We are careful to actually bentsch before saying borchu and beginning ma'ariv.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>\nRabbi Kaganoff also deals with the question at <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/do-i-say-yaaleh-veyavo-retzei-or-both/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Do I say Yaaleh Veyavo, Retzei or both?</a> and goes into more detail on the subject.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/bensching-in-the-dark-on-rosh-chodesh/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RabbiKaganoff.com Bensching in the Dark on Rosh Chodesh</a> deals with the question and goes into detail on the reasons.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rosh (Shu’t HaRosh 22:6; Pesachim 10:7) asserts that once Shabbos\n  is over, one cannot say Retzei. </p>\n  \n  <p>A disputing opinion is quoted in the name of the Maharam (see Hagahos\n  Maimaniyos, Megillah 2:14:1), which states that a meal begun on a\n  holiday maintains its special mention, even when one bensches after\n  the day is over. Thus, when one bensches on seudah shelishis after it\n  is dark, one still recites Retzei. Similarly, if one’s Purim seudah\n  extends into the night, one still recites Al Hanissim in the\n  bensching. These laws apply, as well, on Yom Tov, Rosh Chodesh and\n  Chanukah (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 188:10). The practice, already\n  cited in earlier authorities, of completing the Purim seudah after the\n  day is over and then reciting Al Hanissim is based on this position of\n  the Maharam (Rema, Orach Chayim 695:3).</p>\n  \n  <p>As we just explained, the Maharam rules that one recites Retzei on\n  motza’ei Shabbos for a meal that began on Shabbos. <strong>However, if someone\n  recited havdalah and has not yet bensched for seudah shelishis, he\n  must omit Retzei, since recital of havdalah ends Shabbos. The same is\n  true not only regarding havdalah, which clearly ends Shabbos, but even\n  when one does anything implying that Shabbos is over – such as\n  davening maariv or even simply answering Borchu, since these\n  activities occur only after the conclusion of Shabbos (Shu't Maharil\n  56).</strong> The Magen Avraham (188:17) notes that someone who davened maariv before Shabbos is over (which is halachically permitted under\n  extenuating circumstances) does not say Retzei when he subsequently\n  bensches, even though he is still required to observe Shabbos (since\n  it is before nightfall). This ruling is followed by the Mishnah\n  Berurah (188:32) and other authorities. The Magen Avraham (263:33) and\n  other authorities are uncertain whether one who said hamavdil bein\n  kodesh lechol after Shabbos is over, but has as yet not bensched after\n  seudah shelishis, may still say retzei. </p>\n  \n  <p>The Rema consistently follows the position of the Maharam (Orach\n  Chayim 271:6; 695:3). However, it is a bit unclear how the Shulchan\n  Aruch rules. </p>\n  \n  <p>The Bach (188 and 695) views the Shulchan Aruch as being inconsistent,\n  arguing that this last decision contradicts the position of the\n  Maharam, which the Shulchan Aruch himself follows in 188 and 695. The\n  Bach understands, as do other authorities (e.g., the Aruch Hashulchan\n  188:23), that, according, to the Maharam, the essential factor is when\n  the meal began, whereas, according to the Rosh, the determining factor\n  is what day it is at the moment of bensching. According to the Bach’s\n  understanding of the Maharam, someone who began a meal before Shabbos\n  and continued it into Shabbos should omit Retzei, which contradicts\n  the conclusion of the Shulchan Aruch. The Bach’s approach is\n  consistent with the ruling of the Rema.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, other authorities contend that the Shulchan Aruch is\n  following the Maharam consistently, but they understand the Maharam’s\n  position differently from the way the Bach did. Whereas the Bach\n  understood the Maharam to be saying that the sole determinant is when\n  the meal began, they understand that either the beginning of the meal\n  or the time of bensching determines whether we recite the special\n  holiday prayer. In their opinion, if one began a meal on a holiday but\n  bensched only after the holiday was over, one recites the appropriate\n  holiday passage (Taz 188:7; Elyah Rabbah 188:20).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As long as it is still Shabbos for the person, namely he has not yet done havdala, he should recite the Shabbos addition of 'Retzei'.

Lineage follows the paternal (male) line. Thus, moving up the line of inheritance, if his \"brothers\" cannot redeem him, the next closest line are the brothers of his father (his uncle) and the uncle's descendants (his cousins). </p>\n\n<p>For example see the halacha of the ancestral portion in pesukim 23-24 which deals with returning the ancestral land to the original owner (and tribe). Also Pasuk 10 </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @DanF for pointing out that that the discussion of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9964#v=4&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mas'ei 36:4-9</a> shows that the <em>yovel</em> is connected to the inheritance and follows the <em>shvatim</em>. Similarly a <em>person</em> is considered as part of his shevet and the redemption spoken of traces along back to the closest relative to the person being redeemed <strong>within the shevet</strong>. Normally, the yovel returns property to its owner or his heirs. If he has no sons (or daughters), then it moves back up the male line. In the normal case all heirs (or yovel return recipients) are male in this way. That is why the uncles and cousins are the ones mentioned as the nearest kinsman in the absence of brothers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>you shall return, each man to his property,_ and you shall return,\n  each man to his family.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that this means that it must return to the tribe (at the least) and to the appropriate owner of the land (which is the sons, brother, uncles, cousins, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>The Art scroll chumash summarises as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>47 - 55 <strong>Jews owned by non-Jews</strong>. The ultimate degradation is for a\n  Jew to be sold as a slave to a non-Jewish resident of <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.\n  In that unpleasant case, the Torah places a responsibility upon his\n  <strong>knsmen</strong> to redeem him, but they must do so without depriving the owner of his legitimate rights.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the definition of <em>kinsmen</em> is through the paternal line and it is analogous the the land (as part of the shevet) the Torah here refers to the closest (non-immediate) relatives. That is pasuk 48 had brothers as the most immediate, and then pasuk 49 is the next level away from his father (his father's brother) and his immediate heirs.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>@DanielF hinted correctly. The previous verse explicitly says, \"One of his brothers\". The end of the current verse includes everyone by saying, \"Or one of his kin from his family\".</p>\n\n<p>Also, see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9754&st=&pgnum=355\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Da'at Zekenim commentary</a> - \"uncle\" is a metaphor for G-d himself, and \"cousin\" is a metaphor for the Messianic King.</p>\n\n\n",

Upon hearing this, Abaye said to himself: I will go and accompany them and prevent them from violating the prohibition that they certainly intend to violate. He went after them for a distance of three parasangs in a marsh among the reeds, while they walked on the road, and they did not engage in any wrongful activity. When they were taking leave of each other, he heard that they were saying: We traveled a long distance together, and the company was pleasant company.</p>\n  \n  <p>אמר אביי אי מאן דסני לי הוה לא הוה מצי לאוקומיה נפשיה אזל תלא נפשיה בעיבורא דדשא ומצטער אתא ההוא סבא תנא ליה כל הגדול מחבירו יצרו גדול הימנו</p>\n  \n  <p>Abaye said: In that situation, if instead of that man it had been one whom I hate (a euphemism for himself), he would not have been able to restrain himself from sinning. (After becoming aware of so great a shortcoming) he went and leaned against the doorpost, thinking and feeling regret. A certain Elder came and taught him: <strong>Anyone who is greater than another, his evil inclination is greater than his</strong>. (Therefore, Abaye should not feel regret)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does this principle mean? It can't be understood literally, it defies logic. The more righteous a person is, the more lusts he feels for women and murder and stealing etc.? Usually we see the opposite...</p>\n\n<p>I once heard an explanation that \"greater\" means more sophisticated. Instead of immature desires like food and pleasure the temptations are more refined.

His conclusion is that the urge towards sins whose impropriety is generally intuitive is indicative of a character flaw with the person. Accordingly, it would be better to not have such an urge at all. The urge to commit sins which are not intuitive, however, is not indicative of a shortcoming and it is better to have them and overcome them.</p>\n<p>In this scheme, the intent of the Gemara suggesting that greater people have greater urges towards sin, would be speaking specifically of sins which are not intuitive; commonly referred to as <em>hukkim</em>.</p>\n<p>This category of <em>hukkim</em> includes forbidden sexual relationships, as is evident from his entire discussion there. For example, he cites a Tannaic teaching (Sifra Kedoshim 4:9:12)  that a person shouldn't say that he doesn't yearn to commit various sins, including forbidden sexual relations, but rather that he yearns for them, but nevertheless resists and desists. Rambam explains this statement, as referring to <em>hukkim</em> in particular.</p>\n<p>However, the passage does not, as you suggest, refer to murder and stealing, which Rambam specifically lists as sins which ought to be intuitive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seforno\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

He equates the greater urge towards sin that the great have, with a greater capacity for imagination; picturing and fantasising about the act of sin. (Accordingly, presumably he understood the \"great\" in the sense of intellectual giftedness). Importantly, accordingly, it is not righteousness which leads to the urge to sin, as the question presumes, but rather intellectual and emotional gifts.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it seems likely that not every sort of sin would be included. For example, within the example of murder, the greater, i.e. more imaginative person would perhaps be more likely to become obsessed with a scenario in which involves killing someone, but not necessarily be any likelier (and perhaps even less likely) to commit a crime of passion, in the heat of the moment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I see it as meaning righteous people tend to put guardrails in place so not tempted.

In fact, there was a time where even the gutterals were geminated. Resh eventually became unable to receive dagesh (in the Tiberian tradition), like the gutterals. Yeivin says \"This lack of  gemination is a rather late phenomenon. It ﬁrst affected r and ʾ, later ʿ and h, and ﬁnally ḥ\" (2010:82, <em>Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew</em>, Joshua Blau)</p>\n<p>The Septuagint has gemination of Resh, as you note, e.g. Γομορρα עֲמֹרָ֛ה and Χαρραν חָרָ֖ן. Cuneiform transliterations from the 9th-4th centuries BCE also show gemination of resh, e.g. am-qar-ru-na עֶקְרוֹן, za-kar-ri-ya-ma זְכַרְיָה and gir-re-e-ma גֵּרְיָה (Resh: Pre-Modern Hebrew, Encyclopedia of Hebrew Language and Linguistics).</p>\n<p>Resh is dropped out of words occasionally in the Dead Sea Scrolls, indicating the weakening of Resh in the Second Temple Period (Qimron 1986:26–27, <em>The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls</em>).</p>\n<p>Some modern pronunciation traditions have geminated Resh in their reading of rabbinic literature.

Most post-Talmudic grammarians take presently the opposite view,  and state that the Resh never take a Dagesh. Not only is there no verbal distinction between the hard and soft Resh, but modern Hebrew grammar does not even recognize such a difference in the written form.</p>\n<p>There are, however ten different words, appearing in fourteen places in the Bible, which are written with a Resh containing a Dagesh.</p>\n<p>See Table 28, containing: 1. haRimah Shmuel A 1:6, 2. haR'item Shmuel A 10:24, 17:25, Melachim B 6:32; 3. Ra Yirmiyahu 39:12, Mishlei 11:21, 20:22; 4. Karat Yechezkel 16:4; 5. Sharekh Yechezkel 16:4; 6. Rosh Habakuk 3:13; 7. LeSharekha Mishlei 3:8; 8. Marat Mishlei 14:10; 9.

The hard Resh was either lost or deliberately concealed after destruction of the Temple. In earlier times, its use was standard, and there is evidence from their transliteration of names, that its pronunciation was known to the authors of the Septuagint (which used double for Sarrah). By the 10th century, however the double Resh was only used by the members of the small Mazya community in Tiberias. Tiberias had been the last city in which the Sanhedrin, the great court which preserved the tradition, had flourished. This was one of the mysteries that the Sanhedrin had entrusted to the community of Tiberias.</p>\n<p>According to the Sefer Yetsira 2:3, Resh is in the group of Dentals (זסשרצ). Alon with letters Zayin, Samekh, SHin, Tzadi, it is pronounced with teeth. According to Long Version (of Sefer Yetsira) 2:1, it is sounded \"<em>between teeth with the tongue lying down, spread out</em>.\" We cannot say that it is a rolled /r/ sound, since this involves the tip of the tongue. It would then be closest to the /l/ sound, and should be included among the Linguals (דטלנת). Furthermore, the hard Resh should be a plosive, like all other hard doubles.</p>\n<p>There is no /r/ sound in use today that meets these criteria. Furthermore, there is no plosive sound pronounced with the teeth that could be a candidate for the hard Resh. The original pronunciation of this letter therefore remains a mystery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people believe that pronunciation of /ř/ in Czech language as well as /rz/ in Polish language is the original pronunciation of Resh with dagesh.</p>\n\n\n",

One of the sources brought is from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0427.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'nos Tzelofchad</a> who say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>27:4 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he had no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication being that had their father possessed a son, that son would receive the inheritance due to the father and not the daughters. The gemara disposes of this proof by stating that we cannot learn from them because \"nitnah Torah v'nitchadsha halachah\" - we cannot learn halachic proofs from situations occurring before the giving of the Torah. The commentary on the page states that this is referring to the later parshas nachalos <strong>in that very chapter</strong> (and disposed of as a proof earlier on the daf). However, that parshah is clearly stated as a direct response to the claims of B'nos Tzelofchad and <strong>confirms</strong> their understanding of how the inheritance process should operate.</p>\n\n<p>On its face, the concept of \"nitnah Torah v'nitchadsha halachah\" seems to be a strange response. According to <a href=\"http://www.mnemotrix.com/metsudah/v09r.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi at the beginning of Parshas Behar</a> (quoting Toras Kohanim), Chazal understand that all particulars of the Torah were transmitted at Sinai. The story in question clearly took place at the end of the 40 years in the wilderness, and thus long after Matan Torah. </p>\n\n<p>One option that remains is that while the corpus of law was given orally at Sinai, the completion of the narrative happened only upon the death of Moshe, which has implications regarding how the written Torah was given (whole vs. piecemeal). It would also mean that NO story in Chumash can be considered halachically definitive, since they all take place before the canonization of the written Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone provide a clarification of the concept of \"nitnah Torah v'nitchadsha halachah\" that grapples with some or all of the above points?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9926#v=1&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Behar 25:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְדַבֵּר יְהֹוָה אֶל משֶׁה בְּהַר סִינַי לֵאמֹר:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>RASHI</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>on Mount Sinai: What [special relevance] does the subject of Shemittah\n  [the “release” of fields in the seventh year] have with Mount Sinai?\n  Were not all the commandments stated from Sinai? However, [this\n  teaches us that] just as with Shemittah, its general principles and\n  its finer details were all stated from Sinai, likewise, all of them\n  were stated-their general principles [together with] their finer\n  details-from Sinai. This is what is taught in Torath Kohanim (25:1).\n  [And why is Shemittah used as the example to prove this rule,\n  especially since the very fine details are not even specified here\n  (Sefer Hazikkaron)?] It appears to me that its explanation is as\n  follows: [At the plains of Moab, Moses reiterated the majority of the\n  laws of the Torah to the Israelites before their entry into the land\n  of Israel, this reiteration comprising most of the Book of\n  Deuteronomy. Now,] since we do not find the laws of Shemittah\n  [“release”] of land reiterated on the plains of Moab in Deuteronomy,\n  we learn that its general principles, finer details, and explanations\n  were all stated at Sinai. Scripture states this [phrase] here to teach\n  us that [just as in the case of Shemittah,] every statement [i.e.,\n  every commandment] that was conveyed to Moses came from Sinai,\n  [including] their general principles and finer details [and that the\n  commandments delineated in Deuteronomy were merely] repeated and\n  reviewed on the plains of Moab [not originally given there].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>According to the Art Scroll Bava Basrah 110b1 note 9. נתנה תורה ונתחדשה הלכה means that even after the tora was given at הר סיני, Moshe Rabbeinu had not yet explained that area of halacha to Bnei Yisrael. Technically then, Bnai Yisrael did not know the full halacha. An analogy can be brought to the halacha of פסח שני which was not told to בני ישראל until after some of the people could not bring the קרבן פסח the following year.</p>\n\n<p>נתנה תורה - The Torah was given on Har Sinai</p>\n\n<p>ונתחדשה הלכה - the halacha was learned in the bais medrash and announced to Bnei Yisrael when needed.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, we can say that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Historically the daughters of Tzelaphchad stated their claim before\n  the laws of inheritance were handed down. Thus perhaps it was later\n  revealed that when both a son and a daughter survive the deceased, the\n  estate is divided between them (<em>Rashbam</em>)</p>\n  \n  <p>Although the Torah states that Hashem concurred with the words of the\n  daughters of Tzelaphchad, this merely indicates that their general\n  claim was just. It does not prove that all their underlying\n  assumptions were correct. Thus, it is <strong>possible</strong> that the daughters\n  were mistaken in assuming that had there been a son, they would have\n  received nothing. See also <em>Tosfos</em> to 119b ד\"ה אילו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another point is that incidents in the torah did not happen until the time they were written. The halacha would have been given at Har Sinai, but the incidents that caused Moshe Rabbeinu to write about particular halachos (and explain them to Bnai Yisrael) did not occur until later when they were required.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Rashbam</em> cited above shows that the halacha before Har Sinai was the way that Bnos Tzelaphchad sted it. However, it <strong>could</strong> have been changed at matan torah, similar to the way you cite Yaakov marrying two sisters. Thus the phrase נתנה תורה ונתחדשה הלכה could have applied (though it did not and the halacha had not changed.</p>\n\n\n",

In any case, I am under the impression that Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, <em>z\"l</em>, who originally held like Rav Chaim Ozer, <em>z\"l</em>, retracted after in-depth consultations with scientific experts in the field, though he was unwilling to reverse the popular stringent view of electricity in general.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did they learn Torah before everything was taught in its entirety?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Halachos are spread throughout the Torah. Many times the Gemara uses pesukim that are scattered all around to figure out the true application of pesukim. So if, for example, we only had the section about topic X that was discussed in one place, we wouldn't have the correct picture because we need to take into account things said in another place. Also, the Torah tells us that Moshe said \"These words\" to the Jews--thus implying that those were the actual words he taught.</p>\n\n<p>My question is that in the Torah it seems like some of the halachik sections are very separate from each other. For example, things that were given in Egypt. There are several sections about the moadim. A whole bunch of halachos are taught in Devarim right before entering Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>How did they learn the correct halacha before they had all the pieces of the puzzle? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9926#v=1&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Behar 25:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְדַבֵּר יְהֹוָה אֶל משֶׁה בְּהַר סִינַי לֵאמֹר:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>RASHI</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>on Mount Sinai: What [special relevance] does the subject of Shemittah\n[the “release” of fields in the seventh year] have with Mount Sinai?\nWere not all the commandments stated from Sinai? However, [this\nteaches us that] just as with Shemittah, its general principles and\nits finer details were all stated from Sinai, likewise, all of them\nwere stated-their general principles [together with] their finer\ndetails-from Sinai. This is what is taught in Torath Kohanim (25:1).\n[And why is Shemittah used as the example to prove this rule,\nespecially since the very fine details are not even specified here\n(Sefer Hazikkaron)?] It appears to me that its explanation is as\nfollows: [At the plains of Moab, Moses reiterated the majority of the\nlaws of the Torah to the Israelites before their entry into the land\nof Israel, this reiteration comprising most of the Book of\nDeuteronomy. Now,] since we do not find the laws of Shemittah\n[“release”] of land reiterated on the plains of Moab in Deuteronomy,\nwe learn that its general principles, finer details, and explanations\nwere all stated at Sinai. Scripture states this [phrase] here to teach\nus that [just as in the case of Shemittah,] every statement [i.e.,\nevery commandment] that was conveyed to Moses came from Sinai,\n[including] their general principles and finer details [and that the\ncommandments delineated in Deuteronomy were merely] repeated and\nreviewed on the plains of Moab [not originally given there].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>The question the OP is asking applies only in the desert, as the entire Torah had been written by the time they entered the land.</p>\n<p>Thus, the question would be about any question that is brought up in the desert as i explain below. It is not only a question that is answered in different parts of the Torah, but questions that exist before the command is written.</p>\n<p>Moshe Rabbeinu was taught the whole torah. He told parts to Bnei Yisrael as needed and as commanded. Much of what he said was not written down. The word לאמר is a command to repeat the command and to put the words into the torah. I deal with this question at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/82710/bnos-tzelofchad-yerushah-and-nitnah-torah-vnitchadshah-halacha/82712#82712\">B'nos Tzelofchad, Yerushah and \"Nitnah Torah V'Nitchadshah Halacha\"</a></p>\n<p>As an example of this case, I explain</p>\n<p>According to the Art Scroll Bava Basrah 110b1 note 9. נתנה תורה ונתחדשה הלכה means that even after the tora was given at הר סיני, Moshe Rabbeinu had not yet explained that area of halacha to Bnei Yisrael. Technically then, Bnai Yisrael did not know the full halacha. An analogy can be brought to the halacha of פסח שני which was not told to בני ישראל until after some of the people could not bring the קרבן פסח the following year.</p>\n<p>Thus, we can say that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Historically the daughters of Tzelaphchad stated their claim before\nthe laws of inheritance were handed down. Thus perhaps it was later\nrevealed that when both a son and a daughter survive the deceased, the\nestate is divided between them (<em>Rashbam</em>)</p>\n<p>Although the Torah states that Hashem concurred with the words of the\ndaughters of Tzelaphchad, this merely indicates that their general\nclaim was just. It does not prove that all their underlying\nassumptions were correct. Thus, it is <strong>possible</strong> that the daughters\nwere mistaken in assuming that had there been a son, they would have\nreceived nothing. See also <em>Tosfos</em> to 119b ד\"ה אילו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another point is that incidents in the torah did not happen until the time they were written. The halacha would have been given at Har Sinai, but the incidents that caused Moshe Rabbeinu to write about particular halachos (and explain them to Bnai Yisrael) did not occur until later when they were required.</p>\n<p>A similar point is that all halchos were established from the beginning by Hashem. In many cases, any drasha that might be made, such as with a <em>gzeirah shave</em> would only reestablish a halacha that is already known from the mesorah. The chachamim use these drashot to enable them to remember or recover the halachot that Mosh Rabbeinu was taught.</p>\n<p>For example, we see from Tosfos in Succah 31a <strong>ור\"י סבר לא מקשינן לולב לאסרוג</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאין דן אלא למדה מרבו</p>\n<p>we do not learn a <em>gzeirah shave</em> unless there is a mesorah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Rambam couples together with the law that a gentile is not permitted to study Torah or keep shabbos, even if he kept it during the week (as a regular shabbos) he is culpable. Furthermore he is not allowed to make his own festival. Says the Rambam, a general rule: <strong>A Noahide is not permitted to create his own religion for himself, and to perform commandments from his own ideas. Either he should convert and become a full fledged Jew or he should remain with the 7 laws given to him, and he cannot add or subtract from them</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The question here is, if the Ben Noach were to \"create a religion\" from the 7 laws would that be problematic? Or because he is neither adding or subtracting from the 7 laws it is not \"creating\" a religion. </p>\n\n<p>I believe that the simple reading of the Rambam indicates that because the Noahide is not \"creating\" a new religion, but is merely identifying with the 7 Laws it would be permitted to call it a religion.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to point out that earlier in the Rambam (8:12) he rules that while a gentile who accepts the 7 laws will receive a share in the world to come, this is only if the gentile accepts it as a decree from G-d, and that these are the laws that were commanded by Him through Moshe, and that the children of Noach were commanded to keep these laws.

Just as there is hidur mitzvah by using aesthetically pleasing objects (such as a beautiful pair of tefillin or a beautiful esrog – see Shabbos 133b) so too there is a hidur mitzvah by sporting longer peyos, which demonstrate our pride in the mitzvah. This is evident from the fact that Jews throughout the centuries, living in many different countries, have grown longer peyos than are halachically mandated. (Shulchan HaLevi p. 124)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think the following question stands whether or not that which I have said till now is true, but this was how the question came to mind. </p>\n\n<p>The source of hiddur mitzvah is shabbos 133b which a list of things that you can make beautiful. They all refer to mitzvos asei. Is there a source (as early as possible) for the idea of beautifying a la'av?</p>\n\n<p>In case you ask, the logic for distinguishing between an asei and a la'av is compelling. You are commanded to do something so you do it nicely. If you are commanded not to do something, you just don't do it... you don't 'not do it beautifully.'</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>First, a parallel to the idea behind the question: The Maharal in Gur Aryeh writes that the Avot fulfilled only positive mitzvot but not negative ones because there is no value in refraining from something without having been commanded. Another parallel may be the comment of Tosfot in Niddah (66b) that there is no preferred method to perform something which is not a mitzvah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וי\"ל דאין סברא גבי טבילה שלא הקפידה תורה אלא שיטהר האדם ואין לומר\nדלכתחילה לבעי דכיון דבדיעבד טהור לכתחלה נמי לא בעי ותעלה לו טבילה אבל\nבילה ומקרא בכורים וחליצה מצות נינהו הלכך לכתחלה ליעבד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With regard to this particular mitzvah, R. Yechezkel Rubin (Noam vol. 6, p. 320) suggests that there is no mitzvah of hiddur since it is a lo ta'aseh.</p>\n<p>However, the concept of hiddur mitzvah in mitzvot lo ta'aseh is not unprecedented. The Bnei Yissaschar (Kislev/Tevet, no. 5) quotes the Rama mi-Fano to establish that hiddur mitzvah applies to mitzvot lo ta'aseh--because refraining can be a positive as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש מהם שאפילו בהרחקת הלאוין יקרא עושה טוב לאסור בזיקים וכבלי ברזל\nהמתעה בהן וצבאו ופקודיו תחת שלטנותא דקוב\"ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With regard to the specific mitzvah of לא תקיפו פאת ראשכם, R. Yosef Chaim of Baghdad in his Torah Lishmah (no. 389) writes  that there is a hiddur mitzvah to leave one's payot longer than required:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה כאן צריך להחמיר להשאיר שיעור כדי לכוף ראשן לעיקרן וסגי בהכי כפי\nהדין מיהו ודאי אם יהיו יותר ארוכים עדיף טפי כדי שיהיו ניכרים יותר וזהו\nנוי שלנו שאנחנו מתנאים במצות השי\"ת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea of hiddur for payot is cited as well in the name of the Chazon Ish.\nR. Tzvi Fromer (Eretz Tzvi, no. 3) claims that this is hiddur akin to that of eating additional matzah on the first night of Pesach--although not required, the additional matzah is also a mitzvah. However, R. Binyamin Zilber (Az Nidberu vol. 3, p. 92) argues that the two cases are not comparable, inasmuch as leaving hairs that are not part of the פיאות הראש is not part of the mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

Anyway nowadays could get a glass jar (whether it be a different one or the one normally used for the gefilte fish) and print a label on it with the relevant markings of the kashrus organization (along with any other branding, ingredients, other details, etc?)</p>\n\n<p>2) How can the fact that you hear a \"click\" when opening the jar showing that it is vacuumed sealed be considered a proper \"chosem\" (seal?) Whether it be going out and buying my own jar, giving it a label and then closing it and using a vacuum sealer <a href=\"http://www.foodsaver.com/deals/25-off-accessories/foodsaver-wide-mouth-jar-sealer/T03-0023-01P.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bought online</a> (for only $9.99!), it would be fairly easy to do this? Someone could even take the regular jar with the original label, empty it out, put in the non-kosher gelfite fish and then seal it with a cheap vacuum sealer in ones own home.</p>\n\n<p>How are these 2 things realiable chosemes for gefilte fish sold in a jar?

Did we have to throw in some details that were forgotten in previous passages?

Although many commentators do make such an assumption, it shouldn't necessarily be taken for granted.</p>\n<p><strong>Ramban and Rabbeinu Bachayei:</strong> in reality, the section on reward and punishment should not be seen as a conclusion to Sefer Vayikra, but rather as an extension of the prior discussion regarding the land and its resting years. Thus, the Torah went from discussing <em>shemittah</em> and <em>yovel</em>, to what happens if those <em>shemittah</em> laws are violated, to discussing more details about the <em>yovel</em>'s consequences for evaluating land.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>רמב\"ן:</strong> גם זו הפרשה דבוקה, שהיתה בהר סיני מחוברת אל התוכחות, כי היא במשפטי היובל כמו שהזכיר במקדיש שדה מקנה (להלן פסוקים כג-כד) ושדה אחוזה (שם יז יח), אלא שכלל משפטי כל הנודרים בפרשה אחת. ולכך אמר בסוף (פסוק לד) אלה המצות אשר צוה ה' את משה אל בני ישראל בהר סיני, על כל הנאמרות למעלה, כי מכאן ואילך ידבר במצות אהל מועד</p>\n<p><strong>רבינו בחיי:</strong> פרשה הזו בדיני הערכין מדיני היובל היא, וכן הוא מזכיר ענין היובל במקדיש שדה מקנה ובשדה אחוזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Midrash (in Rabbeinu Bachayei and Baal HaTurim):</strong> dedications based upon the evaluation of people atones or protects from the curses listed in the previous section.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>רבינו בחיי:</strong> וע\"ד המדרש בערכך נפשות, אמר הקב\"ה לישראל אם אתם מביאין לפני ערכין מעלה אני עליכם כאלו הקרבתם נפשותיכם לפני, אמר הקב\"ה לישראל בזכות הערכין אני מציל אתכם מעריכות גיהנם, שנאמר (ישעיה ל) כי ערוך מאתמול תפתה, ואערוך לפניכם שלחן לעתיד לבא, שנאמר (תהלים כג) תערוך לפני שלחן</p>\n<p><strong>בעל הטורים:</strong> בפרשת ערכין יש נ' שקלים ול' שקלים וכ' שקלים וי' שקלים וה' שקלים וג' שקלים וט\"ו שקלים וי' שקלים בין זכר לנקבה, שהוא סך הכל קמ\"ג שקלים, לכפר על מ\"ה קללות שבת\"כ וצ\"ח שבמשנה תורה שהם בין הכל קמ\"ג, ולכך סמך ערכין לקללות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Kli Yakar:</strong> it is the way of Jews to swear dedications to God in times of trouble, such as the times of curses detailed in the previous section.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סמך פר' זו לקללות לומר שישראל נודרים בעת צרה כיעקב שהיה נודר בעת צרה ליתן מעשר מכל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch seems to understand that the Sefer up to this point focuses on one general concept, while these last passages, beginning with Arachin, are fundamentally different – hence their position at the end, almost as an afterthought. In his own words (as <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/the-hirsch-chumash\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">translated by Feldheim</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The book of Vayikra teaches us our duty to the Sanctuary of the Torah. We are to symbolize through offerings and to realize in practice the sanctification of our lives as individuals and as a nation. And, finally, the preceding chapter states that the חוקים משפטים ותורות — which tell us what we must do in order to hallow our lives as individuals and as a nation — are the sole intermediaries of the covenant between ourselves and God, and the sole means for assuring our welfare. </p>\n  \n  <p>Scripture now adds a concluding chapter on voluntary donations to the Sanctuary. A person feels the need or has the desire to give to the Sanctuary an object or its equivalent value, in order to demonstrate his special interest in the Sanctuary, or to signify the special relationship that — in his view — exists between the object and the Sanctuary. </p>\n  \n  <p>These donations to the Sanctuary are called here הפלאת נדר (v. 2 כי יפליא נדר). They are not required by law, and do not stem from the requirements of the law. Rather, they spring purely from one’s own feelings. </p>\n  \n  <p>It is characteristic that this chapter, which deals with donations to the Sanctuary, appears — by its position — merely as a supplementary concluding chapter. Scripture thus explicitly states that this chapter is not included among the חוקים משפטים ותורות, which God has set as the condition בינו ובין בני ישראל, and whose fulfillment will result in the fullness of blessing, and whose violation will bring about all the misery described in the preceding chapter. The donations to the Sanctuary are clearly separated from the חוקים משפטים ותורות, and this teaches us an important point:</p>\n  \n  <p>תורת כהנים, the Jewish priestly code, does not attach special value to Sanctuary donations, and does not see in them special piety, especially pleasing to God. Certainly, then, it does not ascribe to them the power to atone for a sinful life. The Sanctuary of the כהנים sees its mission not in gaining possessions, but in gaining hearts and souls. It seeks to gain the whole of our lives — as individuals and as a nation — for the fulfillment of the חוקים, the משפטים, and the תורות. The sanctification of morality, the safeguarding of justice in society, the enlightenment of the mind and the ennoblement of the heart — the חוקים, the משפטים, and the תורות — they are the sole means of attaining God’s grace. It is they that mediate בינו ובין בני ישראל, and only they bring man closer to God, and God closer to man. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R. Menachem Leibtag suggests the following approach <a href=\"https://tanach.org/vayikra/bchuk/bchuks1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (emphases mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recall that Parshat Vayikra itself, the first parsha of the Sefer, is also not located where it should be (i.e. it is not recorded according to its chronological order).</p>\n<p>[Recall that the mitzvot of Parshat Vayikra were given to Moshe from the Ohel Moed (see 1:1), and hence only after the Sh'china had returned to the Mishkan on the Yom HaShmini. Therefore, it should have been recorded only after the story of the seven day miluim and Yom HaShmini (chapters 8-10). Furthermore, the Torah states explicitly that laws in Parshat Tzav were given on Har Sinai (see 7:37-38), and hence they also should have been recorded before Parshat Vayikra.]</p>\n<p>Thus, we find even though both the opening and concluding parshiot of Sefer Vayikra belong within the sefer, the Torah records them as a 'header' and 'footer' instead. Why are specifically these two parshiot chosen to serve as the 'bookends' of Sefer Vayikra?</p>\n<p>Parshat Vayikra and parshat \"erchin\" share a common theme. They both deal with an individual dedicating an object to 'hekdesh.' Both begin with cases where a person offers a voluntary gift (n'dava), and they both close with obligatory offerings: Parshat Vayikra begins with olah and shlamim (voluntary) followed by chatat and asham (obligatory). Parshat \"erchin\" begins with the voluntary offering of the value of a person, animal or field, followed by the obligatory mitzvot of 'b'chor' and 'ma'aser.'</p>\n<p>[Vayikra deals with korbanot actually offered on the mizbayach (kodshei mizbayach) while Erchin deals with the value of objects that cannot be offered; their value is given instead to the 'general fund' of the Temple - \"kodshei bedek ha'bayit.\"]</p>\n<p>One could suggest that the Torah intentionally chose parshiot dealing with the offerings of an individual, primarily the voluntary offerings, to form the 'bookends' of Sefer Vayikra for the following reason.</p>\n<p><strong>As we have seen, Sefer Vayikra focuses on the kedusha of the Mishkan and of the nation. These lofty goals of the Sh'china's dwelling upon an entire nation can easily lead the individual to underestimate his own importance. Furthermore, the rigid detail of the mitzvot of Vayikra may lead one to believe that there is little room for self-initiated expression in his own relationship with God, as our covenantal obligations could be viewed as dry and technical.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To counter these possible misconceptions, the Torah may have placed these two parshiot at the opening and conclusion of Sefer Vayikra in order to stress two important tenets of \"avodat Hashem.\" First, that despite the centrality of the community, the individual cannot lose sight of the value and importance of his role as an integral part of the communal whole. Second, the rigidity of \"halacha\" should not stifle personal expression. Rather, it should form the solid base from which the individual can develop an aspiring, dynamic and personal relationship with God.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Then, singles weekends were the common way that people met. Granted, at the weekend, one of my friends suggested the idea of meeting this wonderful girl, so, in a sense it was a \"shidduch\" - match-making, but nowhere close to the formalized \"shidduch\" process we have now. We hit it off immediately and were engaged about 2 weeks after we met, and married 2 months later. Everyone thought we were crazy, and, a few tried to break us up. I won't delve into what eventually happened to most of the people that suggested the break up, but you can figure it out, probably.</p>\n\n<p>While the idea of singles weekends is rare in the Orthodox Jewish community, and there are few mixed social events around, mainly because many community rabbis discourage mingling, I would still encourage boys and girls to meet informally rather than go through a shadchan (matchmaker). My reasoning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I've seen these shidduch \"resumes\" and \"forms\". Many of the questions are bizarre and the resumes are even stranger, frequently. \"What color table cloth does your mom use on Shabbat?\" - Why is that fact important to know BEFORE couples meet? Why is the shape, size, color and type of yarmulke important? I am surprised that often the one question that <strong>should</strong> be on a form for male applicants is \"What occupation do you have?\" or better \"How do you plan to support your family?\" isn't there at all. Do so many shadchanim expect mom and dad to support the newly married couple?</li>\n<li>I feel that match-makers interfere a bit too much in the process. Almost everything has to go through them. If I dated a nice girl and I want to date her again, I pick up the phone (and, yes, I mean using my voice - not text, fax or email) and I call her to ask. If she hesitates too much and can't give me a straight \"yes\" or \"no\" - well, what should I think? I think the answer should be obvious to someone who thinks it through. If I'm not sure, then maybe I'll get a mutual friend to pry some additional info from her. The point is, that the intermediary should be a back-up choice, not the main method.</li>\n<li>Personal meeting is, overall cheaper than using a match-making service or a dating service. Believe me, things add up quickly. But, besides the cost, the main advantage is that I think couples get to know each other's best when a spontaneous situation arises. If I meet a girl at an event or a weekend, we're both under a bit of pressure. IN a way that's an advantage, because we both get to discover how we can handle ourselves and have a conversation under pressure. If you want to stay married, believe me, both you and your spouse will be tested numerous times. This is a good way to discover each other. It's very different than when a match maker has prompted each of you on the rules and boundaries of what to say and what not to say.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Having mentioned some of these ideas, I am assuming that the two people already know proper etiquette. If not, hopefully, parents, siblings, peers, or friends would give each other some advice beforehand. A shadchan can do that, but, seriously, a shadchan's goal is ultimately to personally profit from the match making. Yes, they'll give you advice if needed, but, really - it's not the same as getting it from a close friend or parent who has known you well for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>There are many who are shy or \"awkward\" and a shadchan may be the best route for them if they are uncomfortable going to events or single's weekends. I admit that blind dates and friend set-ups aren't for everyone. It really depends on the individual's personality.</p>\n\n\n",

France), offer something completely different. They point out that the Hebrew root “b-r-ch,” which almost always refers to “blessing” (as in “Baruch Atah…,” “Blessed are You…), also has a horticultural meaning, “to graft” one plant onto another. They translate the seventh promise, “All the families of the earth shall be grafted onto you.” Rashbam explains, “the families of the earth shall be mixed into your family.” The commentary Chizkuni (13th c. France) goes further: “The leading families of the land will be mixed with you, so that you won’t be considered foreigners or strangers among them.”</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible?! At the very moment when God singles out the family of Abram and Sarai to be distinct from all other clans and nations; in a Torah that is so concerned about assimilation, which legislates the separation of the Israelites from other peoples at every turn; and given hundreds if not thousands of years of Jewish anxiety about intermarriage in particular-can we imagine that the capstone promise of God’s first message to Abraham is precisely to be mixed with the other families of the earth?</p>\n\n<p>This radical possibility has its roots in a passage from the Talmud:</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Elazar said: “Why is it written, ‘All the families of the earth shall bless themselves by [shall be grafted onto] you?’ The Holy One said to Abraham, ‘I have two good shoots to graft onto you: Ruth the Moabite and Naamah the Ammonite.'” (Yevamot 63a)</p>\n\n<p>Upon joining herself to the Jewish people, Ruth the Moabite became the great-grandmother of King David. Naamah the Ammonite married King Solomon, and her descendants included the righteous kings Asa, Jehoshaphat, and Hezekiah.</p>\n\n<p>The metaphor is beautiful: Non-Jews who join us (not even necessarily by converting) are like living shoots: growing together with us, sharing in the strength and sustenance of our roots, bearing new fruit. The implication is profound: Mixing with the other families of the earth is not a tragedy or a threat to Judaism, but a blessing to all of us and a fulfillment of God’s ancient promise to Abraham.</p>\n\n<p>This is the true spirit of outreach, a grateful understanding of the opportunity to share the richness of Judaism with others. By welcoming and encouraging interfaith families and anyone seeking a spiritual home, we enable our community to grow in new directions.</p>\n\n<p>In taking up the story of our patriarchs and matriarchs, the Torah does not abandon the rest of humanity. God’s promise to Abraham reminds us that ultimately, our mission and destiny are joined with those of all the families of the earth.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi points out that Er wasted seed because he wanted to keep her beauty, but as we learn from her marrying Onan afterward, and waiting for his brother even after he died, she wanted a child. So for Er and Onan to waste seed, knowing she is only allowing this sexual act for the sake of that seed, means they are raping her. It's like the reverse of the rape scenario of a woman consenting to sexual relations with a condom, and the man removing the condom mid act.

Therefore G-d has the right to punish for the misdeed.</p>\n\n<h2>Option 2.</h2>\n\n<p>Your [commonsense] assumption that G-d only \"kills for punishment\" is disputable. G-d's could have them killed ONLY to allow Tamar to unite with Yehuda.</p>\n\n<p>As simple as that. Now you ask about the interpretors?

The \"cord,\" the soul— or as the verse has it— Jacob, drawn from the final hai in G‑d's Name, the Tetragrammaton, is severed, cut off. \"That soul shall be cut off from before Me, I am the Lord.\" The soul is cut off from before Me.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Other sins that do not incur excision do cause at least a defect in the soul, a \"defect\" being similar to the \"defect\" or nick that invalidates a blade for ritual slaughter.</p>\n  \n  <p>Returning to the analogy of the cord— a thick rope woven of 613 thin strands parallels the Scriptual \"cord,\" the downward flow from G‑d mentioned above, comprising 613 mitzvot. When man violates one of them, G‑d forbid, a thin strand is severed ...</p>\n  \n  <p>But even if one has incurred excision or death, there yet remains an impression within him of his divine soul, and through this he may live until fifty or sixty years and no more. (The statement attributed to the Ari, that the Encompassing enters him ... is irrelevant to the life of the physical body, and applies until fifty years, or to the contemporary period, as will be noted.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Kares is the cessation of G-dly light on one's soul. And when one runs out of G-dly light, he dies.</p>\n\n<p>So why are people who are Chayav Kares not passing away at 50 or 60*? </p>\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe answers in Chapter <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/tanya/3/5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם זהו בזמן שהיו ישראל במדרגה עליונה כשהיתה השכינה שורה בישראל בבהמ\"ק. ואז לא היו מקבלים חיות לגופם רק ע\"י נפש האלקי' לבדה מבחי' פנימי' השפע שמשפיע א\"ס ב\"ה ע\"י שם הוי' ב\"ה כנ\"ל. אך לאחר שירדו ממדרגתם וגרמו במעשיהם סוד גלות השכינה כמ\"ש ובפשעיכם שולחה אמכם דהיינו שירדה השפעת בחי' ה\"א תתאה הנ\"ל ונשתלשלה ממדרגה למדרגה למטה מטה עד שנתלבשה השפעתה בי\"ס דנוגה המשפיעות שפע וחיות ע\"י המזלות וכל צבא השמים והשרים שעליהם לכל החי הגשמי שבעוה\"ז וגם לכל הצומח כמארז\"ל אין לך כל עשב מלמטה שאין לו מזל וכו'. ואזי יכול גם החוטא ופושעי ישראל לקבל חיות לגופם ונפשם הבהמיות כמו שאר בע\"ח ממש כמ\"ש נמשל כבהמות נדמו. </p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>וזהו שאמרו רז\"ל אין בידינו לא משלות הרשעים וכו' בידינו דוקא כלומר בזמן הגלות אחר החורבן.</p>\n  \n  <p>However all this pertained when Israel was on a higher plane, when the Divine Presence dwelt among Israel in the Beit Hamikdash. Then the vitality of the body came only through the divine soul, from the internal of the life-giving power issuing from the Infinite, through the Tetragrammaton, as described above.</p>\n  \n  <p>But after that they had fallen from their estate, and through their actions caused the mystery of the exile of the Divine Presence. \"By your sins was your mother expelled,\" meaning that the benevolence flowing forth from the latter hai as mentioned descended far down, from plane to plane, until it entered into the Ten Sefirot of nogah. The benevolence and vitality proceed through the hosts of heaven and those charged over them to every living physical being in this world, even to vegetation. \"There is no blade of grass that has no spirit above...\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus even the sinful and deliberate transgressors of Israel may receive vitality for their bodies and animal souls, exactly as other living beings do, for \"They are compared and equal to beasts.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>Hence the statement, \"Not within bur hands is the reason for either the tranquility of the wicked ...\"— in our hands, in this time of exile after the destruction. This is the sense of the \"Exile of the Shechinah,\" as it were, His granting benevolent life-force to the chambers of the sitra achra that He despises.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer is that nowadays, people can live off the not-holy side, so one who is above 60 and Chayav Kares can live, but from impurity.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* Until that age, one lives off a \"battery\" of G-dly light, of sorts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I asked the Rabbi in question and this is the response he gave:  \"I am sorry but I really don't remember who I heard it from, but I am pretty sure it was from a reliable source and the idea makes sense that you cannot be mazid if you have no concept of the punishment as opposed to misa and malkos.\"</p>\n\n\n",

But subsequent books of the Torah seem to take place at later times.  So:  Am I wrong about Moses having gotten the entire Torah during the time period recounted in Exodus?  Or did the Torah, at the time of its giving, include detailed historical accounts of events that had not yet happened?  Or have I misunderstood things so totally that my question makes no sense?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>This is an excellent question and there is nothing to be embarrassed of. The traditional approach states that the entire Torah was given to \"Moses\" at Sinai (Rashi beginning of chapter 25 Vayikra). But as you already pointed out, how come other commandments weren't written down only later?</p>\n<p>The Ramban grapples with the question in his introduction to sefer Devarim. He suggests that even though Moses learnt everything at Sinai, the nation of Israel didn't receive everything at once, but was taught in the order of the Parshiyos.\nFurthermore, according to Ramban some Mitzvos weren't even taught to the yotzei mitzraim (the generation that witnessed the exodus) only to their children as these Mitzvos only applied to the generation that was about to enter the land of Israel, and was irrelevant to the previous generation.</p>\n<p>Regarding your other question when the entire Torah was written down (at Sinai or after the \"forty years\"). The traditional approach states it happened right before Moses's death, where at least most parts of the Torah were written down. The Ramban in his introduction to his commentary writes that according to the position of \"megila megila nitnah\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.60a.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 60a</a>), when Moses came down from Mt. Sinai he wrote from the beginning of the Torah til after the Mishkan (which means the end of Shmos). The rest he finished before he died. According to the other position that \"Torah chasumah nitnah\" (which means the Torah was written at once), everything from beginning to end was written before he died (see Ramban Dvarim 31:9. he takes the position of \"Torah chasumah nitnah\" and that the entire Torah was written after forty years). But note that according to both positions (according to the Ramban's understanding) none of the narratives were written before they had occurred. This strongly suggests that the biblical narratives were written <em>only</em> after they had occurred. See also Rashi Shmos 24:7 regarding the sefer habris and what it contained. Rashi seems to agree with this approach.</p>\n<p>There is no reason to say that Moses wrote down the bibilical stories prophetically before it happened. This idea is clearly stated in the Gemara (bava basra 15a), \"is it possible that Moses is dead and he writes 'And Moses died there' (Dvarim 34:5), but Moses wrote until here, from here on Joshua wrote.\" If we assume that Moses wrote the entire Torah at Sinai and predicted stories that have not happened yet, what is the big deal with Moses writing \"and Moses died there\"? This is a clear indication that Moses did not write down the biblical stories before it happened but only afterwards.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is not at all “the most ignorant question ever asked on this site”.</p>\n<p>Indeed, there is no simple universally agreed answer.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Anthony Manning has given several series of lectures on the topic.

As a minor, if he desecrates Shabbos, his inclination doesn't protest. If he murders, his inclination doesn't protest. If he commits arayos, his inclination doesn't protest. At 13, his good inclination is born and begins weaning him off of these sins, telling him, \"don't do that - you're liable to death.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why, indeed, does the good inclination come at 13, and not at birth? Would the decision between good and bad not be more of an even match if he had the inclinations both ways from birth? </p>\n\n<p>The reason I quote ADRN specifically is because of the way it poses the good inclination, not unlike a nagging little brother. It almost makes a person <em>want</em> to sin. Granted, that's the point - to listen to it anyway - but does it have to be so hard? Could HaShem not have made it a fair fight and accomplished the same thing? As it stands, without Hashem's help, the Yetzer Hara would kill us (Kiddushin 30b). Why wouldn't He help us in this manner?</p>\n\n\n",

Each one pleaded with him to sin with them, yet he merely spat at them and ignored them. In the morning, the ruler asked R' Akiva why he didn't sin. \"Are they not beautiful? Are they not human like you? Did the One Who made you not make them?\" R' Akiva replied, \"They smelled like treifos, neveilos, and sheratzim.\"</p>\n\n<p>They smelled bad. <em>That's</em> why he didn't sin? Not because he was prohibited from doing so? Not because he felt it beneath his dignity? That's what R' Tzadok said for why he didn't sin. R' Akiva died al kidush HaShem. He clearly didn't feel scared to stand up for Hashem's honor, so this wasn't just an excuse.</p>\n\n<p>At first glance, you might claim it's a metaphor, yet the Magen Avos and Binyan Yehoshua (see link above for the latter) say it refers to the treif food they ate. Okay, so R' Akiva's just saying that they smelled bad, and they should brush their teeth and then he would sin with them? Or else get beautiful vegans? What exactly was R' Akiva thinking when he said this?</p>\n\n<p>Note that I'm looking for an explanation that fits with the Binyan Yehoshua and Magen Avos' understanding that the Braisa is to be taken literally, not one that takes it metaphorically. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all, it is not clear to me that the Binyan Yehoshua is saying that he repulsed by the smell of them. I think he is explaining that when it says they stink of nevelah; this means that he was disgusted by the fact they would consume nevelah; not that he was physically repulsed or anything like that.</p>\n\n<p>It was the sin that he found repulsive; not the flavour, or smell.</p>\n\n<p>[Incidentally, this seems to presuppose that there is something intrinsically disgusting about <em>hukkim</em>, such as forbidden foods, which ostensibly goes against at least some statements in Hazal, (e.g. The Sifra to Kedoshim discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/82700/8775\">here</a>)]</p>\n\n<p>So, the Binyan Yehoshua is explains that the story is portraying R. Akiva as repulsed by their sinful activities. Would this Midrash describe a different story if they were vegan? We don't know, since it didn't choose to tell a story about vegans. However, I see no reason to assume that the sentiments indicated by the Midrash by actual consumption of these substances by those particular women. Indeed, isn't it rather strange that he just happened to get stuck with sherets eaters. </p>\n\n<p>It seems quite likely that the audience for this Midrash (or if one wishes to claim this Midrash is historically significant, R. Akiva himself) had a visceral negative association with non-kosher foods (or at least some of them) much like the ubiquitous taboo around pork in particular in the Jewish world.</p>\n\n<p>This would explain why the typical example of sin in numerous Hazalic works is the consumption of non-kosher foods, (for example the question of whether we force a minor to avoid prohibition is presented as the question of whether he may eat <em>nevalah</em> (Shabbat 121a) and the typical sinner (who does so not to anger God in particular) is presented as the one who eats <em>nevalah</em> for his pleasure (Hullin 3a, Sanhedrin 27a).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, (and perhaps because of this taboo), non-Jews are classically characterised in rabbininc literature as those who eat nevelah, (cf. e.g. Bava Metsia 111b). This association between non-Jews, and the archetypal sinful  forbidden foods they consume, seems to me to be the most likely understanding of this Midrash, and I see nothing in the Binyan Yehoshua to make me think otherwise. </p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it seems that that the Midrash would be just as coherent if the women were vegans, because the negative non-Jews in general were known as nevalah eaters, and this appears to be the case regardless of their diets (cf. Bava Metsia 111b).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in popular parlance, non-Jews; even circumcised ones were known as <em>arelim</em> (cf. Nedarim 3:11).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it seems likely that \"the stench of nevalah\" was basically the same as a general repulsion with non-Jews; particularly because of their activities, regardless of whether they were vegan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, given the above associations, it seems likely that the even if we don't say that R. Akiva meant that he was repulsed by the idea of committing a sin, and that they (by dint of their prohibition to him) seemed repulsive, (which seems like a perfectly fine explanation, but not the one the question is asking for), and rather explain that the emphasis was on the women's consumption of non-kosher food, according to all the above we can still explain that it was not the physical smell that so bothered R. Akiva as portrayed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First, I want to say that this seems to me a deep question for which I have rather slender qualification. I usually respond to more technical questions that don't involve introspection or contemplation of human nature. However your question didn't get very many responses here, and after I thought about it for a few days I began to feel that I had something to offer, even if something ultimately inadequate.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to start by considering the general attitude of Chazal toward temptations.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Ashi wondered about the fact that even great people in earlier times succumbed to a temptation that he easily resisted, a temptation to worship idols. When occasion somehow presented itself he communicated with the spirit of Menashe King of Yehudah, who had lived and died 25 generations earlier (in the times of Hosea, Amos, Isaiah and Micah), when the desire to worship idols was strong. Rav Ashi expressed wonderment that even great men of early times wished to worship idols. Menashe responded that if Ashi had lived during earlier times he would have lifted the hem of his skirt to run to the idols. See Sanhedrin 102b1; 2 Kings 15:16 to 22; and the Judaica Press introduction to 2 Kings.</p>\n\n<p>What is this story doing in Shas? Why is it helpful for us to know about Rav Ashi and King Menashe? Perhaps in this story Chazal ask us to bear in mind that when people face challenges, it is not easy for us to know whether those challenges are difficult for them; and this is especially true when our vantage is from a great distance.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in Shas, Abaye overheard a man and a woman planning a journey. He followed them, expecting to intervene if they came to sin. But they traveled together and then parted ways, saying, \"Our paths diverge now, but the company would have been pleasant.\" Abaye became despondent, reflecting that he would himself have been overcome by temptation, until he learned that whoever is greater than his fellow has a greater temptation than his fellow. See Succah 52a3.</p>\n\n<p>Would you say that Abaye was dissembling when he said that he would have been overcome by temptation? Whom was he trying to fool, and why? The gemara tells us directly that he was despondent because he would have failed. See also Shemonah Perakim 6 (of the Rambam); Akeidas Yitzchak, Parshas Nitzavim p. 104b ff; Or Yisrael 30. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly the story you quote, from Avois d'Rabbi Nosson, seems to ask to be taken at face value. While I agree that we should consider whether people in the Talmud are always candid, I see here no reason for misstatement; there is nothing to gain by it.</p>\n\n<p>Further, if the redactor had thought that R' Akiva's statement was not candid, there would seem to be no reason to include the story at all. The context seems to require it. First, AR\"N quotes a statement of Pirkei Avois: the evil inclination drives a man from the world. A series of reflections on the evil inclination, on the difficulty of overcoming, leads to the tale of Joseph the righteous; then to Zadok the greatest man of his generation; then to R' Akiva, who was greater than he; and then to R' Eliezer the great, who was more distinguished than he. Each rebuffed sexual overtures. Then there follow several more paragraphs on the fearsomeness of the evil inclination. If the point is not that these men were genuinely tempted, then what is the point?</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally the stories also contain ingredients that seem to make sin more bizarre. One involves a little girl who is the rabbi's sister's child; I would consider this an almost uniquely non-tempting situation. And yet the stories praise this degree of self-control.)</p>\n\n<p>R' Akiva's explanation involves the stench of carcasses. The only reason he refrained from disgraceful behavior is some detail that seems beside the point. What should our attitude be? Should we be disappointed in him for being a man of a certain nature? Or should we (perhaps like him) be glad for any contingency that helps us remain true to our goals? This whole world is a very narrow bridge, and the whole point of view of the story is that R' Akiva's level of self-control is remarkable. The jailer apparently sends women in to visit prisoners routinely because the need is widespread; he is as surprised as the women themselves when R' Akiva refuses this offer. For ourselves, we commonly manipulate circumstances (to make our own failure less likely) simply by avoiding seclusion and remaining in public view. I believe that this works, and if someone told me that the only reason he did not sin was that he would have been embarrassed to be seen sinning, I would say that he is no weaker than others, just more honest. So I would not dismiss a moral victory that is contingent. They're almost all contingent; but is this one really so small?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Some say that Yochanon Kohen Gadol was later called Yannai. See Berachos 29a1.</p>\n\n\n",

With two handles, the pure hand can take the cup from the unwashed hand by using the handle that the unwashed hand is not holding, and then the washed hand can pour water on the unwashed/impure hand so both hands are pure.

Eliezer holds that if one erred in the\n  performance of a mitzvah and performed a mitzvah which does not\n  override Shabbath, he is liable. (\"and R. Yehoshua exempts him\":) He\n  holds that if one erred in the performance of a mitzvah and performed\n  a mitzvah which does not override Shabbath, he is exempt; for he felt\n  that he was operating under the sanction of beth-din. <strong>The halachah\n  is in accordance with R.

    "content": "# Is saying a bracha over non-Kosher food a sin or does it simply not count as a Mitzvot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question may sound strange but it came up in a discussion with someone. </p>\n\n<p>They're a Baal Teshuva in progress and are attempting to adjust to the lifestyle. He's getting there but he's doing so in layers. He currently doesn't have a Kosher household as he lives with family and they don't keep Kosher (nor will they allow him to take over their kitchen to do so)</p>\n\n<p>He plans on moving out and that will be settled then. <em>(Though I've suggested purchasing Kosher food that doesn't need to be cooked. Hasn't made the jump yet.)</em></p>\n\n<p>One of the things he said to me was he has been practicing the prayers over Non-Kosher food. He'll pray before a meal and do so with the food that everybody else in the house is eating.</p>\n\n<p>Now on instinct, I told him some stuff which I didn't actually know for sure was true or not. It just sort of came out and I regret saying it without knowing for sure if it's true or not. I'll correct him if it turns out I was wrong. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What I told him was the following:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You shouldn't do that because the prayer goes from being functional to\n  being more of a \"mock\" of the actual prayer. You're thanking hashem for bringing forth food while\n  consuming unclean food. That in itself is making a mockery of the\n  prayer because it's being misused for something you aren't supposed to\n  be eating. It's like a Jew praying over a pork sandwich. The act of thanking Hashem for it is worse than just eating it blindly because the fact you're praying means you're fully conscious that what you're doing isn't Kosher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suggested he purchase a kosher snack food which he could use as practice. This way he's still learning while not wasting the prayers.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now I totally pulled that out of thin air. I have no idea if that idea is legitimate or if I simply applied Torah logic in the wrong place.</p>\n\n<p>A part of me can't help but wonder if praying over unclean food isn't necessarily a sin but simply just doesn't count. Sort of like having a Minyan with nine people. Even if all of the prayers are said correctly and done as outlined, you didn't apply it correctly it doesn't count. </p>\n\n<p>Could someone clarify this one for me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As we see in the discussion below, the Rambam and others say that it would be a mockery of Hashem to make a bracha.

The Taz brings up case of sickness.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rambam writes \"When a person eats a forbidden food - whether\n  bemaizid (intentionally) or beshogeg (inadvertently) - he should not\n  recite a blessing beforehand or afterward\" (Brachot 1,19). This is\n  also found in the Talmud Yerushalmi, where it explains that such a\n  blessing would be \"na'atz Hashem\", as in Tehillim 10,3 which can be\n  read as \"the one who blesses and blasphemes Hashem\". What a chutzpah\n  to say a bracha on sinful eating!</p>\n  \n  <p>However, both the Ra'avad and the Rosh rule that a blessing must be\n  said before and after eating non-kosher food. The Mishna merely rules\n  that a non-kosher meal is not considered as important enough to\n  require a zimun on it – but in the words of the Ra'avad, \"why\n  shouldn't he say a bracha before and after eating, since he enjoyed\n  the food?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch (Orach Haim 196,1) rules in line with the Rambam,\n  that one does not say a bracha before or after eating non-kosher food.\n  However, the Taz raises an interesting point. The subsequent halacha\n  in the Shulchan Aruch states that if someone had to eat food because\n  they were in danger (such as someone seriously ill or starving), they\n  do in fact say a blessing. If so, asks the Taz, why shouldn’t someone\n  who ate non-kosher food by accident (shogeg) say an after-blessing?</p>\n  \n  <p>If the blessing is on the enjoyment of eating, then we would even say\n  a blessing over non-kosher food (like the Ra'avad and Rosh) because we\n  did in fact enjoy the food; or at least when such a blessing isn't a\n  blasphemy and an insult to Hashem (like the Taz). On the other hand,\n  perhaps blessings come to thank Hashem for creating the food we eat,\n  and not for the enjoyment of eating. If so, it makes no sense to thank\n  Hashem for creating the non-kosher food, which wasn't created for Jews\n  to eat at all, rather it becomes a stumbling block for the person who\n  inadvertently eats it. Alternatively we could say that blessings might\n  have been instituted in order to permit the food to be eaten – as the\n  Gemara says, it is forbidden to benefit from this world until one\n  recites a bracha. (This is especially true according to the\n  kabbalistic understanding that a bracha draws out the holy sparks from\n  the food). If so, it would make sense that brachot are only required\n  when the food is kosher or permitted, because otherwise the food\n  remains forbidden in any case, and the bracha is of no use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/927667/jewish/Berachot-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Brachot 1:19</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>19 When a person eats a forbidden food - whether consciously or\n  inadvertently - he should not recite a blessing beforehand or\n  afterward.</p>\n  \n  <p>What is implied?

See, <strong>the hierarchy of Mitzvos is never clearly defined and for every Halachah stating X an addition \"unless Y\" can be made</strong>.</p>\n<p>I had a first-hand experience with this kind of questions for B\"T, working for one of the biggest Teshuva movements (at least in Israel) Arachim.org for 7 years. B\"T always want (<em>and is very advisable</em>) to make the Teshuva gradual, but the Halachah is not (so) flexible.</p>\n<p><strong>Most Israeli Poskim</strong> that Arachim contacted on this type of questions, <strong>permitted (or did not oppose) cutting some corners especially on all deRabanan rulings</strong> (incl Brochos, Shaboos Muktzeh etc.) <strong>if one sticks to the B\"T path</strong>, and here's their reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Every Mitzvah has two constituent parts: <strong>Cheftzah</strong> (C) (object) and <strong>Gavrah</strong> (subject). The Cheftzah part acts on the subject of a Mitzvah, like a Succah, Teffilin or food when blessed. The Gavrah part changes the doer of the Mitzvah, increasing his spirituality, adherence to Hashem, belief in Torah, especially when using explicit intention for performing a Mitzvah (Kavanah).</p>\n<p>Usually it takes the two, but sometimes a contradiction rises, like when a Mitzvah is performed unintentionally (swallowing Matzah at the Seder) or acting on a non-kosher object, like sitting in a non-kosher Succah (on Succos of course). In this case, it is not perfect, but a decision must be made.</p>\n<p>When a person is a strong observer, we do not question the Gavrah part, thus rendering the option of acting on a non-kosher object invalid, or forbidden. However, <strong>when one's adherence and personal strength is our main concern, like in B\"T cases, we prefer to rule otherwise, allowing to act on a non-kosher object</strong> (e.g. blessing on a non-kosher food). Here's the Halachic basis for that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A kid (under 13) while learning Mitzvos is allowed to make blessings on non-kosher objects, like Lulav, or saying unneeded blessings (several times in a row).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Kashrut is not one of the 3 \"untrespassable\" prohibitions, and eating NK food is allowed by the Torah in several cases (like recruits in war) or when life is in danger.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Kashrut is a huge grey area between something that's clearly prohibited (non-kosher animals) to some BADA\"TZ signed Kosher food, most ruling dealing with different concerns and remote indirect dangers. So a food that's not \"Kosher\" for a frum Jew can be perfectly Kosher for a less observant one (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalav_Yisrael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cholov Isroel</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>\"אתי עשה ודחי לא תעשה\"</strong> (positive Mitzvos override negative ones) is a Talmudic principle, applied sometimes (see Yevomos 3b) to allow performing a positive Mitzvah (in our case blessing Hashem, or thanking for enjoying this world) at expense of overriding a negative one (saying G-d's name in vain). This might be especially true when the Halachic rigidity prevents a B\"T from advancing in his observance.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It must be noticed, that <strong>the person must be warned that this is not how it is meant to be</strong>, and it is a big \"beDieved\" (retrospectively), and he must strive to move on in his observance in all realms of Judaism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Hoffman is using the German word for business school: <em>Handelsschule</em>. The question thus raised is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A father told his son to write in business school on the holy Shabbat.\n  He does not want to and his mother told him that if he doesn't\n  listen to his father and they quarrel in the house, she will kill herself\n  (Lord help us). Should the boy obey his father to protect his mother's\n  life?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The highlighted word is not relevant to understanding the response from Rabbi Hoffman as can be seen from the content of his answer.</p>\n\n<p>He understands the question to be dealing only with the subject of whether a person threatening to kill themselves is considered a circumstance of danger to life that would warrant someone else to violate Shabbat. In the example from the question, the method of violation would be writing on Shabbat. Where that would take place is irrelevant from what appears in his answer.</p>\n\n<p>That said, it seems unlikely that a religiously observant Jewish family from late 19th century Germany would be sending their young son to attend a trade school that would require him to violate the Shabbat. And it seems even less likely that his father would be advocating for him to violate Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <em>trade/business school</em> would be spelled with Yiddish/Hebrew letters האנדלשול or האנדלשולע. Spelled in German <em>Handelsschule</em>. But this run-on typo is spelled בהאנרעלזשולע.</p>\n\n<p>Since the remainder of the question and answer are in Hebrew and only this phrase is in Yiddish, it suggests that the Yiddish phrase is clarifying how the father was telling his young son to write on Shabbat. The Yiddish ending of the phrase is זשולע, pronounced zhule, not shule. זשולע or זשעלע means <em>jelly</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It looks like it is a run on of the Yiddish phrase בהאנד על זשולע or בהאנט על זשולע.</p>\n\n<p>The more reasonable scenario is that the father is telling his young son to <em>write with his hand in jelly</em> (שרייבן מיט א האנד על זשולע) on Shabbat. Perhaps he was learning the laws of Shabbat with him over the Shabbat meal. The child refused because he thinks it is a violation of Shabbat and a quarrel ensues.</p>\n\n<p>This actually relates to the concept of what constitutes writing and erasing in connection with food on Shabbat like is discussed in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=379\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 340:15</a>. As is explained there, <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Food-with-Writing.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writing is defined as letters or pictures written with a separate substance, such as frosting on a cake. Shapes etched into a food (or if the food itself is made into a particular shape) are not considered “writing” and so may be destroyed</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The mother is objecting to her young son refusing to obey his father and says that if the child doesn't obey, she will kill herself.</p>\n\n<p>The question revolves around whether the child should potentially violate Shabbat in order to save the life of his mother when she threatens suicide.</p>\n\n\n",

Does this apply to one who endorses biblical criticism (both higher and lower) of the other books of the Tanakh--higher criticism being most commonly known as the historical-critical method?

Though the Mishna only addresses the question as to “who gets oilam habu”, the Rambam assumes that this Mishna has some bearing on the question regarding “who is a heretic” as well. So far we haven’t seen anything about belief in Mosaic authorship of the Torah. The Mishna merely states that a Jew must believe in the divine origins of the Torah or that תורה מן\" השמים\". The Gemara in Sanhedrin (99b) writes regarding the words of the Mishna “Torah min hashmayim” - “for he scorned the word of god’ (Bamidbar 15:31), this refers to one who says the Torah is not divine. Even if he says that the entire Torah is divine besides for one verse which god did not speak, but Moses said it on his own is included in the verse ‘for he scorned the word of god.” Here too we don’t find any mention of the Mosaic authorship being an ikar emuna, but the belief in the divine inspiration of the author/authors of the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam codifies this belief in his Mishna Torah and in his Perush hamishnayot (in the beginning of perek chelek), and makes the belief of “Torah min hashamyim”, an ikar. However he adds a few words (Hilchos Teshuva 3:8) that are not mentioned in the Gemara itself: “אם אמר משה”, “if Moses said it”. It is not clear if the Rambam is trying to say that the belief in Mosaic authorship is in itself an ikar (meaning that doubting this in itself constitutes heresy), or that the Rambam is merely giving an example of a prophet (Moses), saying that mere doubting that the author of the Torah was a prophet constitutes heresy, since that would be the equivalent of denying the divinity of the Torah altogether. The words of the Rambam in Perush Hamishnayot are too ambiguous to infer from them anything relevant to our question.   </p>\n\n<p>The first clear mention of Mosaic authorship of the Torah being an ikar emuna is found in the Ani Maamin[2] (article number 8), “I believe with perfect faith that the entire Torah presently in our possession is the one given to Moses.\" This clearly indicates that a Jew must believe that the Torah was written by Moses himself, and that the Torah was not tampered by anyone else besides for Moses. According to this position, one who doesn’t accept the Mosaic authorship of the Torah is a heretic. However, as we have already seen this is not evident from the words of Chazal or the Rambam, the only belief required of the Jew is that he believe that the Torah is of divine origin. That the Mosaic authorship is an ikar emuna (not merely a Jewish tradition) is an invention of the author of Ani Maamin. See also Tiferes Yisroel beginning of perek chelek ois vav, he seems to agree with the Ani Maamin that Mosaic authorship is an ikar. See also Shut R’ Moshe, YD 3 vol. 6, siman 114-116. From these teshuvos It is evident that he accepts Mosaic authorship for an ikar, though he doesn’t feel the need to defend this position as it is self-evident to him. </p>\n\n<p>Now the Ibn Ezra (the Tzafenat Panaeach also cites him in the end of Parshat Vayishlach) in a few places in his commentary hints that the Torah might have been edited by different people, and that certain words were added only after the Israelites conquered the land (see his commentary on Dvarim 1:2). See also the Tziyuni al haTorah Bamidbar 21:17. This supports the position that belief in Mosaic authorship is not an ikar emuna, and that dismissal of it is not heresy (unless we say that the Ibn Ezra himself was a heretic[3]).  There is also evidence from the Midrashic literature that the Torah was edited by other scribes. In a few places (see for example Rashi Breishis 18:22) the Rabbis point out that it would have been more appropriate for the Torah to write in different way, only that the scribes (Ezra and his assembly) edited it when they felt the need to “ תיקון סופרים הוא זה\". From this we see that the Rabbis themselves were comfortable with the idea that the Torah was edited by different people other than Moses, although they surely believe that they all did so with divine inspiration[4]. This gives credence to the idea that Mosaic authorship was never intended to be an ikar emunah, as the Rabbis themselves questioned this tradition. See also Rashi Dvarim 34:5 regarding the last eight verses of the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>(Note: nowhere does the Torah claim that it was written in its entirety by Moses . The Torah only states in a few places that the previous Parsha was written by Moses, but that never includes the whole book. After Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 24:4) the Torah makes such a statement. And the same claim we find by the Maso’es of the Israelites (Bamidbar 33:2). The only book that is claimed to be written (almost) in its entirety by Moses is sefer Devarim (31:9)[5]. [Indeed this is the only sefer that’s called “Toras Moshe” in the Tanach. See Joshua 8:32; 2 Melachim 14:6]. And even that doesn’t preclude small edits by other scribes).  </p>\n\n<p>Although we haven’t seen anything yet close to the study of biblical criticism and the belief in the documentary hypothesis (saying that small edits cropped in the text is different than saying that different portions were written by different authors and only compiled much later) some modern Rabbis stretch this argument and say, since we haven’t seen anything conclusive, in the Gemara or in the Poskim, regarding the belief in Mosaic authorship, and we found some Rabbinic literature (and Rishonim) supporting the idea that Mosaic authorship in the traditional sense is not an ikar, there is no reason to draw the line here and stop, for this would be an arbitrary distinction; we might as well say that belief in the documentary hypothesis is not heresy[6]. </p>\n\n<p>One might still argue and say, if we acknowledge the scholarly position that portions of the Torah were written by different authors, when they often contradict each other, then we are essentially denying the divinity of the Torah, since Hashem does not utter contradictions? This problem is easily solved through a Gemara in Eiruvin 13b, “three years the Bais Shammai and Bais Hillel argued, one would say the Halacha is like us and one would say the Halacha is like us, a heavenly voice came out and announced: both [schools] are the words of god, but the Halacha is like Bais Hillel etc.” The concept of \"אלו ואלו דברי אלהים חיים\" states that even two contradictory opinions can be true in the sense of them both being divinely inspired. In a similar vein, all of the different contradictory verses evident in the Torah can be said to be divinely inspired, as every author tries to derive new laws from the broad principles set forth by Moses which are the words of god. In light of this we can even say that all 613 Mitzvos are of Mosaic origin, though he didn’t command us to do all of them, all of the Mitzvos can be attributed to him since the authors of the Torah all derive their laws from his words. This theory is advanced by Jacob Milgrom in the introduction to his book Leviticus (a book of ritual and ethics) where he shows that even critical scholarship can believe in the Mosaic origin of the Mitzvos. </p>\n\n<p>This theory works for the biblical narratives as well, though we admit that they were composed by different authors each writing down his own version, they were all equally inspired by god to speak and write and enlighten the Jewish nation. Here, the conservative might argue that if we admit that there are different versions (of narratives) in the Torah, then we are essentially saying that some parts of the Torah are not true, since when we’re dealing with contradictory versions, obviously, only one can be true. However, one can still argue that the minimum requirement is that the Jew believes in the divine origin of the Torah, since it is sensible to believe in the documentary hypothesis and at the same time believe that the authors were divinely inspired (as we have proven from the Gemara in Eiruvin), this would suffice for the belief in “תורה מן השמים”.   </p>\n\n<p>If one accepts biblical criticism he must reject the notion that the words of the Torah were dictated by god to the author, since god cannot dictate contradictory laws and verses to different authors. He must say that the Torah is heavenly in the sense that it has been divinely inspired by its authors. However this does not deter some modern orthodox Rabbis to embrace such a belief, since nowhere is it mentioned that divine dictation is an ikar emuna, it is only required that he believe that Torah is a divine authority. The position that biblical criticism and Jewish belief are compatible is advanced by a few modern orthodox Jewish Rabbis including: Rabbi Louis Jacobs in his book “we have reason to believe”; Abraham Joshua Heschel professor at the JTS[7]; David Weiss Halivni[8]; Rabbi Jeremy Rosen[9].  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> though mainstream orthodoxy does not allow for any other authors for the Torah besides for Moses, and advances the minimalist position regarding the Mosaic authorship of the Torah, and considers this belief to be an ikar emuna, some Rishonim and some Rabbinic literature allows for some edits after Moses’s death by divinely inspired scribes. Since biblical criticism is a relatively new study we cannot know if the Rishonim and Rabbis would have endorsed such a radical view as the documentary hypothesis. However, since Mosaic authorship is not mentioned in the Gemara or the Rambam to be an ikar emuna (unequivocally), some modern orthodox Rabbis embrace biblical criticism and take the maximalist position regarding the definition of \"תורה מן השמים\".</p>\n\n<p>[1] Literally it translates as “Torah is not from heaven”.\n[2] A composition that is based on the Rambam’s ikarim, but was not composed by the Rambam himself, and has some significant differences with the Rambam’s original ikarim enumerated in his Perush hamishnayot. The author of the Ani Maamin is unknown.\n[3] Rabbi Mordechai Breuer in his debate with Professor Israel Knohl remarked, “I do not know if [ibn Ezra’s] words were to the liking of the rabbis. In any event, they were uttered by Ibn Ezra, and we can therefore not reject their legitimacy.”\n[4] However, see Tiferes Yisroel for different interpretation. Almost all the meforshim explain it similarly. But of course my interpretation of the Midrash is more straightforward. see also Dr. Marc Shapiro in \"Maimonides' Thirteen Principles: The Last Word in Jewish Theology?\". see also Natan Hokhmah li-Shelomo, p. 106 by R. Solomon David Sassoon.<br>\n[5] However see Ramban Devarim 31:9. But this is not the only way to read the verse. The simple interpretation is that it refers to sefer Devarim only.\n[6] However see Tzafenat Panaeach end of Vayishlach.\n[7] <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Judaism/We-Have-Reason-to-Believe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Judaism/We-Have-Reason-to-Believe</a>\n[8] in his books \"revelation restored\" and \"Peshat and \"Derash\". \n[9] <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/torah-misinai-and-biblical-criticism/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://thetorah.com/torah-misinai-and-biblical-criticism/</a>\nsee also <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/in-what-sense-did-orthodoxy-believe-the-torah-to-be-divine/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://thetorah.com/in-what-sense-did-orthodoxy-believe-the-torah-to-be-divine/</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

What is the significance of the Jewish people having a formation? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bamidbar Rabbah 2:3\n  בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁנִּגְלָה הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא עַל הַר סִינַי יָרְדוּ עִמּוֹ כ\"ב רְבָבוֹת שֶׁל מַלְאָכִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (תהלים סח, יח): רֶכֶב אֱלֹהִים רִבֹּתַיִם אַלְפֵי שִׁנְאָן, וְהָיוּ כֻלָּם עֲשׂוּיִם דְּגָלִים דְּגָלִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שיר השירים ה, י): דָּגוּל מֵרְבָבָה, כֵּיוָן שֶׁרָאוּ אוֹתָן יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁהֵם עֲשׂוּיִם דְּגָלִים דְּגָלִים, הִתְחִילוּ מִתְאַוִּים לִדְגָלִים, אָמְרוּ אַלְוַאי כָּךְ אָנוּ נַעֲשִׂים דְּגָלִים כְּמוֹתָן</p>\n  \n  <p>When the Jewish people stood at Mount Sinai they witnessed Hashem\n  descend with 22 revavos of malachim, and all of them were positioned\n  in degalim-formation. When the Jewish people saw this, they desired to\n  be arranged in degalim, as it says (Song of Songs 5:10) dagul mervava. When the Jewish people saw the malachim standing in formation they too desired to be in formation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why did they have such a passionate desire to stand in formation? </p>\n\n<p>The Midrash says that Hashem affixed His Name within ours and gave us a formation to stand in.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bamidbar Rabbah 2:2</p>\n  \n  <p>ובשם אלהינו נדגול, שקבע הקדוש ברוך הוא שמו בשמנו, ועשה אותנו דגלים, \n  שנאמר (במדבר ב): איש על דגלו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our standing in formation down on earth was a revelation of Hashem. Just as the angels in shamayim stood in a formation that revealed the glory of Hashem, so too when the Jewish people witnessed that at Mount Sinai, they desired to replicate that on earth. That was why we had our formation. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the formation of the tribes of Israel into four distinct camps containing three tribes each, and Levi in the centre is a direct revelation of Hashem's name. Each of the four camps corresponds to one of the four letters of Hashem's name YKVK. </p>\n\n<p>Yud - The camp in the East (consisting of Yehuda, Yissachar and Zevulun) </p>\n\n<p>Hei - The camp in the South (consisting of Reuven, Shimon and Gad) </p>\n\n<p>Vav - The camp in the West (consisting of Ephraim, Menashe and Ephraim) </p>\n\n<p>Hei - The camp in the North (corresponding to Dan, Asher and Naftali)</p>\n\n<p>The central camp (consisting of the fours parts of the Tribe of Levi and the Aron) corresponds to the kutzo shel yud. In that way, the function of the tribes formation was more than just a helpful way to stand or defend ourselves, it was in itself a revelation of YKVK (See Sha'arei Orah, Fifth Gate, Sixth Sefira, 80). </p>\n\n\n",

The Rebbetzin told me in a soft and polite way that wishing someone <em>mazel tov</em> in this kind of situation was not part of their tradition (Chasidic?). I was concerned that I had made a gaffe. This happened during a Friday-night <em>kiddush</em> at the <em>shul</em>, the mother and newborn still hospitalized, awaiting their hospital discharge.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this so? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I don't think this is specifically a Hassidic custom. My rav and another in my neighborhood have told me a few times that when I hear that a boy was born, one should wait until after the brit to say <em>mazal tov</em>. From what I understood, the reason is that the boy is not considered a \"full Jew\" (not that he's not Jewish, but they implied that the brit is a major Jewish event that enters the baby into the covenant) until the brit occurs.</p>\n\n<p>In light of what you mentioned, as well as knowing what I went through with my oldest son (His brit was significantly delayed), I can see that almost every parent wants to know that his son will at least make it to the brit. Until then, I don't think that anyone should assume that the birth of a baby means that things are automatically \"secure\", so it makes sense to hold off.</p>\n\n<p>None of the rabbis mentioned anything about girls, incidentally. My own thinking is that the same logic would apply, though. One should not assume that things are automatically fine upon birth. For girls, the best way is to keep in contact with the parents and inquire to the baby's health, to know when it's \"safe\" to say \"Mazal Tov\".</p>\n\n\n",

We do not say that the Aseh \"Motzei Sefasecha\n  Tishmor\" overrides a Lav, for he brought the Aseh upon himself.</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>Shulchan Aruch (YD 215:1): A Neder is Chal on Mitzvos. If one said\n  'Konam Sukah, I will not sit (in one), a Lulav, I will not take one',\n  he may not sit in a Sukah or take a Lulav.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rema: Some say that we lash him for vowing to Mevatel a Mitzvah, and\n  permit it, and he fulfills the Mitzvah. Some say that there are no\n  lashes for a vain vow, only for a vain oath.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shulchan Aruch (5): A Neder is Chal on a Mitzvah only regarding an\n  Aseh, whether or not there is a Lav for being Mevatel it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shulchan Aruch (6): Some say that the Neder is Chal. If he eats it, he\n  transgresses \"Lo Yachel.\" However, if he was Matfis something else in\n  it, it is not forbidden, for he intends for the initial Isur, which is\n  Davar ha'Asur. However, if something is forbidden mid'Rabanan and he\n  forbade it through a Neder and was Matfis something else in it, it is\n  forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/973882/jewish/Nedarim-Chapter-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Nedarim 3:6-7</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>6 What is meant by the statement that vows take effect with regard to\n  mitzvot as well as actions that are left to one's choice? When a\n  person says: \"Matzah is forbidden to me on Pesach night,\" \"Dwelling in\n  a sukkah on that holiday is forbidden to me,\" or \"I am forbidden to\n  take hold of tefillin,\" they are forbidden to him. If he ate matzah,\n  dwelled in a sukkah, or took tefillin, he is liable for lashes.<sup>11</sup>\n  Similar laws apply in all analogous situations. Needless to say, one\n  who says: \"I am obligated to bring a sacrifice if I eat matzah on\n  Pesach night,\" is obligated to bring a sacrifice.<sup>12</sup> Similar laws apply\n  in all analogous situations.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>11.</sup> For breaking his vow. The Rama (Yoreh De'ah 215:1)\n  mentions a view that maintains that the person should be given\n  corporal punishment for taking such a vow and should be compelled to\n  ask to have the vow released.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>12.</sup> For he can fulfill the mitzvah and bring the\n  sacrifice (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah, Nedarim 2:2).</p>\n  \n  <p>7 Why do vows take effect with regard to mitzvot and oaths do not take\n  effect with regard to mitzvot? Because when a person takes an oath he\n  forbids himself from [partaking of] the entity mentioned in the\n  oath.<sup>13</sup> When, by contrast, one takes a vow, he causes\n  the entity mentioned in the vow to be forbidden to\n  him.<sup>14</sup> Thus when a person takes an oath to nullify a\n  mitzvah, he is placing a prohibition upon himself and he is already\n  bound by an oath [to observe that mitzvah] from Mount Sinai, and one\n  oath does not take effect if another is already in effect. When, by\n  contrast, a person causes an entity to be forbidden through a vow, the\n  prohibition involves the entity itself and that entity is not under\n  oath from Mount Sinai.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>13.</sup> I.e., the prohibition involves the gavra, the\n  person himself. It cannot take effect if he is already bound to act\n  otherwise.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>14.</sup> I.e., the prohibition involves the cheftzah, the\n  article. Once it is forbidden, it is forbidden to fulfill the mitzvah\n  by partaking of it or using it, for a positive commandment does not\n  supercede a negative commandment. It would be a mitzvah fulfilled\n  through a transgression which is a forbidden act (the Rambam's\n  Commentary to the Mishnah, loc. cit.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Mishna in Nedarim (16a) states, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר קונם סוכה שאני עושה לולב שאני נוטל תפילין שאני מניח בנדרים אסור\n  בשבועות מותר שאין נשבעין לעבור על המצות:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that if someone makes a neder to annul a Mitzvah (in your words to abstain from something mandatory) it works, and he cannot do the Mitzvah until he annuls his neder. On the other hand, if he makes a Shvua to annul a Mitzvah it doesn't do anything since he is already \"מושבע ועומד מהר סיני\"; which means that since he has already accepted the vow at Sinai to do them, his shvua is null and void. The reason why the neder works in this case is because a neder is a \"איסור חפצא\" which means that it (the sacredness of the pledge) rests on the object not on the person, and since the object can become ussur to him he cannot do it. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Rambam (shvuos 5:18) states that in certain cases even a shvua can work to annul a Mitzvah, that is if he makes a general vow not to eat Matzah for a few years, he cannot eat Matzah even on Pesach. the reason why it is so is because \"מתוך שחלה שבועה על שאר הימים חלה על ליל הפסח\". </p>\n\n<p>In the case when the shvua was null and void (mentioned above) the Rambam states that he gets \"malkos\", since he made a \"שבועת שוא\" which means a \"useless vow\" that is explicitly forbidden to make (ibid 5:14). If this punishment applies by nedorim, see Rema and Shach beginning of siman 215 YD. Regardless of whether he gets malkos, everyone seems to agree that it is ussur to do. </p>\n\n<p>One more point: since nedarim are always negative (i will not do so and so) your first question is not sensible (If one makes a neder... to do something that is forbidden by Torah), since you can never make a neder to do something. Regarding a shvuah in such a case (i will do something forbidden) the previous din would apply in this case as well, and the shvuah would be null and void.</p>\n\n\n",

However, there is a specific aspect of the soul which is also referred to as Neshama, as we find in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.14.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the following Midrash:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חֲמִשָּׁה שֵׁמוֹת נִקְרְאוּ לָהּ: נֶפֶשׁ, רוּחַ, נְשָׁמָה, יְחִידָה, חַיָּה. נֶפֶשׁ, זֶה הַדָּם, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יב, כג): כִּי הַדָּם הוּא הַנֶּפֶשׁ. רוּחַ, שֶׁהִיא עוֹלָה וְיוֹרֶדֶת, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (קהלת ג, כא): מִי יוֹדֵעַ רוּחַ בְּנֵי אָדָם הָעוֹלָה הִיא לְמַעְלָה. נְשָׁמָה, זוֹ הָאוֹפִיָּא, דִּבְרִיָּתָא אָמְרִין הָאוֹפִיתָא טָבָא. חַיָּה, שֶׁכָּל הָאֵבָרִים מֵתִים וְהִיא חַיָּה בַּגּוּף. יְחִידָה, שֶׁכָּל הָאֵבָרִים מִשְׁנַיִם שְׁנַיִם, וְהִיא יְחִידָה בַּגּוּף.</p>\n  \n  <p>It [the soul] has five names: nefesh, neshamah, hayyah, ruah, yehidah. Nefesh is the blood: For the blood is the nefesh — E.V. 'life' (Deut. xii, 23). Ruah: this is so called because it ascends and descends: thus it is written, Who knoweth the ruah (E.V. 'spirit') of man whether it goeth upwards, and the ruah of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth (Eccl. in, 21) ? Neshamah is the breath; as people say, His breathing is good. Hayyah (lit. 'living'): because all the limbs are mortal, whereas this is immortal in the body. Yehidah (unique): because all the limbs are duplicated, whereas this is unique in the body. (Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the Midrash could be understood to merely refer to different names which all describe different aspects of the same thing, in Kabbalistic thought it is understood that the soul is actually comprised of different parts, and that each of these names refers to one of them. I've come across this concept many times, but I don't know the original source. </p>\n\n<p>I believe that there is also an idea found in Kabbalistic sources that the Nefesh part of the soul is the general life force, which is associated with the blood and can be said to reside in the entire body. The Neshama is the intellectual force, and is 'located' in the brain. I also believe that the proponents of this idea cite [the students of] Rabbeinu Yona's commentary on the Rif in Brachot (8a of the Rif, which corresponds to the Gemara at the end of 14b): \"The Neshama, which is in the brain\" - which is also the source of the S.A. you mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>So in summary, according to this view, the Gemara is using \"Neshama\" in its more broad sense, while the S.A. is using the more specific meaning of the term, the intellectual force which is connected to the mind. </p>\n\n\n",

This follows what the Rebbe writes in the Haggadah on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15703&st=&pgnum=47\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">page 38</a> beginning with the words: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ויאכלם</strong>. ואינו טובל במלח</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the later editions of the haggadah it mentions that the explanation for this is based upon the Chassidic discourse from the Alter Rebbe in Likkutei Torah, beginning with the words <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14963&st=&pgnum=41&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>ולא תשבית מלח וגו׳.</strong>, page 6c, chapter 8</a> which points to the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14268&st=&pgnum=280\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur, O.C. 455</a> beginning with the words והרבה נוהגים שלא ליתן מלח בפת בפסח. According to the Tur, this is also the custom of all Ashkenaz. And as he emphasizes, salt with matzah is not considered <em>enriched matzah</em>, like with egg matzah.</p>\n\n<p>In all of these places it is only discussing tasting the salt, not its presence on the table. The emphasis from the Rebbe, and what he says is the custom of the Rebbe's household, is not to dip the matzah in salt in order that no other taste is mixed with the taste of the matzah.</p>\n\n<p>Like the Alter Rebbe explains in the Chassidic discourse cited, the concept of matzah is that it is <em>Lechem Ani</em>, a poor persons bread, bread without taste (בלי שום טעם). This is a play on words for the idea of knowledge and reason (טעם ודעת). That faith, as in the matzah of the first night is also called the <em>bread of faith</em>, is service without knowledge and reason (בלי שום טעם ודעת). So it all is related to the actual tasting.</p>\n\n<p>If the custom in your particular community or family is not to have salt on the table until after making HaMotzi and eating, then that is what you should follow. But as it relates to the custom of the Rebbe's household, it is only about not actually tasting salt with the matzah. Presence on the table, by itself, is not forbidden.</p>\n\n\n",

So expect those questions to come up a lot; hopefully you and your wife have already had some of those conversations. </p>\n\n<p>These come up often in couples where both are born Jewish and over time, one decides to increase their level of observance; it can be done, but it takes a lot of clear communication, understanding, and patience.</p>\n\n<p>Most Orthodox conversion rabbis will expect the conversion candidate to move within walking distance of an Orthodox synagogue; even if your wife drives on Shabbos, can you make that work?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/GPSprotocol.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">RCA policy document</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At a minimum, the candidate must have ongoing, reasonable accessibility to the institutions of Orthodox life; e.g., a mikveh, an Orthodox day school through 12th grade, kosher food, and <strong>live within walking distance to an Orthodox minyan that meets regularly each Shabbat and Yom Tov.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would start off having some of these conversations with your wife; once you feel you have answers that satisfy both of you, I think you can explain your situation to a rabbi and it will be at least worth some serious consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Here's how the Rabbinical Council of America words <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/GPSprotocol.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">their policy</a> (note the nuance):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a candidate is previously intermarried or is converting for the sake of an individual Jew (as per above), <strong>the spouse’s observance level and attitudes must be consistent with the present and future Torah observance of the candidate and not be a source of conflict or opposition to the convert’s adopting a halachic lifestyle.</strong> The Beit Din should also consider whether other significant individuals in the candidate’s life such as parents, or any existing minor children, will have an impact on the success or failure of the process and the aftermath of conversion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So be prepared for some tough questions about how it will work ... but I wouldn't say it's impossible. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>When my husband inquired of the orthodox (RCA) Beit din, he was told that conversion would not be permitted unless I (a born Jew) agreed to become halachically observant as well. Truthfully, the Beit din appeared to be more concerned about my level of committment than his because I used to be frum and went \"off the derech\" and married a non-Jew. I agreed to return to the path, and my husband did convert and we are now both completely observant. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>you might have to convince te beis din that your conversion is not merely \"to keep your Jewish wife\" since this could prove problematic</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the deal with moral relativism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have heard and read from kiruv books, outreach speakers, pamphlets etc. that Orthodox Judaism doesn't like \"Moral Relativism\" (the position that moral or ethical propositions do not reflect objective and/or universal moral truths, but instead make claims relative to social, cultural, historical or personal circumstances)</p>\n\n<p>In my understanding, however, Judiasm DOES believe in Moral Relativism: Miriam got instant tzaarat and Moses was banned for life from Eretz Yisroel because their sins were magnified because they were at such high levels. (Also, Reuben didn't really sleep with his father's wife, rather his action should be considered to be so heinous because he was such a big tzaddik)</p>\n\n<p>Why does Judaism seemingly object to Moral Relativism yet seemingly hold by it? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Without quoting exactly what you've heard from these speakers it's hard to defend or disprove them. However I will still guess at what is bothering you and offer this.</p>\n\n<p>The laws of Judaism given by Hashem do not change based on moral relativism. </p>\n\n<p>The punishment meted out by Beis Din do not change based on moral relativism. Their judgment is supposed to be based on their human perception. </p>\n\n<p>Hashem's dealing with a person, however, can and does change based on what you are calling moral relativism.</p>\n\n<p>An example to illustrate this that I once heard from Rabbi Dovid Feinstein: Two people desecrated Shabbos, one for something worth very little, and the other the save a million dollars. Both desecrated the same commandment. Both would get killed in Beis Din under the right circumstances. However, Hashem when dealing with them will certainly take into account the driving motives that differentiate between the two. Both failed their test, but one had a much harder test and won't be held <em>as</em> culpable. </p>\n\n<p>Along these lines a great person can and will be held to a higher standard by Hashem when He personally judges them. </p>\n\n<p>As for the quoted idea regarding Reuven, we for no judicial purposes can assume a given holy person did not sin in the way mentioned. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Moral relativism is generally understood to be an ideology that claims to deny absolute moral truth.  (That claim itself can be a bit self-contradictory inasmuch as so-called \"moral relativists\", such as the ancient Greeks, the Communists, or the modern left, often, in the name of pluralism, end up persecuting moral absolutists, such as religious Jews, for their perceived immoral beliefs.) </p>\n\n<p>Judaism is based on absolute moral truths (such as Maimonides 13 principles of faith, the 613 commandments, etc.) and abhors moral relativism.  For example, moral relativism would argue that the Nazis were moral inasmuch as they were true to their convictions.  </p>\n\n<p>Your examples are not examples of moral relativism.  The moral truths that were violated are still absolute.  However, absolute moral truth does factor in different individual's strengths and weaknesses with regard to calculating the consequences for their violations.  That does not mean that if you chose to believe A then A is your truth, whatever A is.  It means that if A is true, not-A is false.  But you will be judged not just based on your keeping of A alone.  Your personal knowledge, weaknesses and strength, will <em>also</em> factor into the calculus.  That is not what is generally meant by the term \"moral relativism\".</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah adds therefore that his death should occur without humans touching him. This prohibition applies equally to the Israelites’ beasts. If you were to ask why ascending the mountain is a worse offense than killing such a person by stoning him while ascending?

First of all, the Rashbam mentions \"מבריך ומרכיב\". So the first word indeed sounds like \"ונברכו\". Second,  even the other word \"מרכיב\" - according to rashbam - comes from the shoresh \"ברך\", it is just a variation of the first word. We find words like these all over Tanach. Take for example the words \"כבש\" and \"כשב\", they both mean the same thing but sometimes its written like that and sometimes like that. And there are numerous other examples: \"שמלה\" \"שלמה\"; \"מלתעות\" \"מתלעות\"; \"עיף\" \"יעף\"; \"בהלה\" \"בלהה\". </p>\n\n<p>I think the Rashbam merely linked the word of \"ברך\" with the word \"מבריך\" (and its sister variant \"מרכיב\") found in the language of Chazal. see Ramban Vayikara 19:20, Rashi 20:17 for similar idea. The Chizkuni on \"ונברכו\" also adopts this interpretation.  </p>\n\n\n",

Thus, the phrase would seem to be translated as, \"for You are a Doctor Who does not charge.\" </p>\n\n<p>Why do we make this point here? HaShem, allow this treatment that I'm spending thousands on to work, because You work for free?

You raised an excellent point by using the term חונן, because this word is actually related to חנם !</p>\n\n<p>Rash\"i in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14085&st=&pgnum=48\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 3:23</a> says that the word חנון (a close form of חונן) always refers to מתנת חינם - a free gift/ Even the most righteous people, who could rely on their good deeds as being merit, still pray to G-d that He grants them a free gift. I.e., they don't assume that they are entitled to G-d's graciousness.</p>\n\n<p>Now, look at <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=284\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah on O.C. 230:4 #6</a> says. My loose translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One should say this prayer regarding all means of medication\n  (healing). [i.e the text talks only about saying this when letting\n  blood.] One should not think that it is specifically the medication\n  that is healing him, rather, that the healing comes directly from G-d.\n  Thus, by reciting this prayer, he will have faith in G-d, and that\n  faith will be the cause of the healing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, in brief, whether you named G-d רופא חונן or רופא חנם, it would amount to the same thing. The idea is not that you are saying that G-d isn't charging you. You are conveying the idea, that you are not automatically entitled to being healed by G-d, as G-d can do what he wills. However, even though you are not entitled, you are praying to G-d for a free gift.  </p>\n\n\n",

If a woman has a <strong>Hilchos Niddah vest</strong> on Friday such as <strong>Yom Hachodesh</strong> & accepts Shabbos early, does she still need to keep the Halachos of her <strong>vest</strong> until sunset or does early Shabbos make it the next day in regards to her vest?</p>\n\n<p>I know there are several questions on <strong>MY</strong> regarding early Shabbos and other Halachos (such as putting on Tefilin) but I don't know whether all cases would have the same answers.

Shaarei Teshuvah here (in the name of Shaarei Efraim and Machazik Beracha here) says that a father should not make this blessing on behalf of his son, and Piskei Teshuvos based on various Poskim, says that it is the universal Minhag for both Ashkenazim and Sefardim that parents do not make this blessing on behalf of their children. </p>\n\n<p>Edit:  </p>\n\n<p>However, Rav Yehuda Herzl Henkin in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20022&st=&pgnum=63\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Benei Banim 2:15</a> (h/t to DoubleAA) works his way thoroughly through the Poskim to prove that it is permissible for a father to make Birchas Hagomel, and says that he himself made Hagomel (albeit with slightly different wording), and published this Pesak.

Tzitz Eliezer (not quoted by Piskei Teshuvos) 14:20 quotes various Poskim (that say that this is Assur, and he concludes that it is <strong>obvious</strong> that a father may not make this Beracha on his son.  (At one point, he even says ולענין אבי הקטן מעלה גם הברכ\"י בעצמו בספרו מחזיק ברכה אות ו' כדעת ספר אהל יוסף דלא יברך אלא בלא הזכרת שם ומלכות, <strong>ובלי חולק</strong> ע\"ש ).

This is because they count seven days, plus the six nights between them, and the one before and the one after.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone who speaks Welsh count sefirah in Welsh after the first six days?  If you say \"today is 7 days which is one wythnos\" (according to google translate, \"Heddiw yw saith diwrnod, sy'n un wythnos, o'r Omer\", don't ask me how to pronounce that), you're not being accurate, since the eighth night is no longer part of the seventh day.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It seems from <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&pg=PA330&lpg=PA330&dq=wythnos%20welsh%20week%20eight%20nights&source=bl&ots=p0_zgeztZH&sig=9kURTNtUkJelrTeHkvGGpDlPXAQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHysiFk4zUAhUL7YMKHUJ2CmsQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q=wythnos%20welsh%20week%20eight%20nights&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that while the Welsh word literally meant \"eight nights\" and referred to an eight <em>day</em> week, it now just refers to a Judean seven-day week, and that's how it would be understood by the contemporary Welsh.   This should mean that it would be fine to count in Welsh.  Back when the meaning was actually an eight-day week, it should have been no better than using \"fortnight\" in English.  This is likely the case as well were the ancient Welsh to have had a a name for the 7.5-day unit you describe, since it is not the same as 7 days.</p>\n\n\n",

This is true if we compare something like mathematical amounts (like weight).</p>\n\n<p>However, it sometimes works out that A is greater than B; B is greater than C; and C is in fact greater than A!</p>\n\n<p>Scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. Now, shouldn't scissors beat rock, because it beats the thing that beats rock? NO! Rock blunts scissors. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara for instance asks that strangulation be considered more severe than burning. Burning was singled out for a daughter of a cohen; But strangulation was singled out for someone who strikes a parent. The Gemara was able to show that since a daughter of a cohen got her punishment upgraded from strangulation to burning, then obviously burning is the more severe punishment.</p>\n\n<p>If we didn't go through that logical step, we may have come to the conclusion that burning is more severe than the sword and the sword is more severe than strangulation, but perhaps strangulation is more severe than the sword?? The same logic applies to stoning if we didn't walk through the steps of proving it was more severe than each of the other three.</p>\n\n<p>The difference of course would be concerning someone who was convicted of two sins. One deserving of burning and the other deserving of strangulation. You can only give the condemned the death which is more severe. Which one?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was the use of the tallit instituted as halacha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.judaicawebstore.com/all_about_the_tallit.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> implies that the mitzvah of wearing tzitzit is required only when one wears a four-cornered garment. If one never wore such a garment, one need not wear tzitzit at all.</p>\n\n<p>Citation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The style of dress in those olden times was for people to wrap\n  themselves in rectangular garments, but over the centuries styles\n  changed, and in many parts of the Jewish world, this commandment and\n  ritual was faced with extinction.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rabbis decided, therefore, to make it a special duty for us to go\n  out of our way to continue wearing four-cornered garments in order to\n  obligate ourselves in this time-honored and deeply significant\n  mitzvah. They instituted two different garments for this purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why was this mitzvah considered so important that the rabbis had to introduce the wearing of a special garment? This is a \"situational\" mitzvah - i.e., if one doesn't encounter the situation, he doesn't need to perform the mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p>We have many similar \"situational\" mitzvot, such as <em>Shiluach Hakan</em> (sending away the mother bird before taking the chicks or eggs.) Its reward is long life - So, it seems important, in some way. Yet, we do not require people to plant a tree and coax a female bird to come there to build a nest. </p>\n\n<p>Why was the mitzvah of tziztzit considered that important?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Although he does not seem to agree with the full extent of your citation (i.e. that it is an actual duty), Rambam (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/2403.htm#12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Tsitsit 3:12</a>) writes that this mitsvah is particularly important, and therefore one should try to perform it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אף על פי שאין אדם מחוייב לקנות טלית ולהתעטף בה, כדי שיעשה בה ציצית, אין ראוי לאדם חסיד, לפטור עצמו ממצוה זו; אלא לעולם ישתדל להיות עטוף בכסות המחוייבת בציצית, כדי שיקיים מצוה זו.  ובשעת התפילה, צריך להיזהר ביותר; גנאי גדול הוא לתלמיד חכמים, שיתפלל והוא אינו עטוף</p>\n  \n  <p>Even though a person is not required to purchase a <em>tallit</em> and wrap himself in it, so that he [will be obligated] to make tsitsit for it, a pious person should not exempt himself from this mitsvah. Rather, he should always try to be covered with a garment that is required in tsitsit, so that he should fulfill this mitsvah. And during prayer, he needs to be particularly careful with this; it is a great disgrace for a talmid hakhamim to pray without being wrapped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The next halakha seems to provide the explanation for why this mitsvah is unique in that pious people should try to fulfill it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לעולם יהא אדם זהיר במצות ציצית, שהרי הכתוב שקלה ותלה בה כל המצוות כולן, שנאמר \"וראיתם אותו וזכרתם את כל מצוות ה', ועשיתם אותם\" (במדבר טו,לט).</p>\n  \n  <p>A person should always be careful with the mitsvah of tsitsit, for the verse (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0415.htm#39\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 15:39</a>) states: \"And you shall see it, and you will remember all the mitsvot of God, and perform them\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His son <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Moses_ben_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Avraham</a> elaborates upon this point in the halakhic portion of his HaMaspik L'Ovdey Hashem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין האדם מחויב לקנות כסות ולעשות לה ציצית...אולם..הנה רצוי ומומלץ...[ש]ישתדל לקנות טלית שהיא חייבת בציצית ויעשה בה ציצת, ויהא לובשה תמיד או במרבית זמניו כדי שתושג אצלו תכלית המצוה הנכבדת הזאת  שהיא וראיתם אתו וכו</p>\n  \n  <p>A person is not obligated to purchase a garment and make tsitsit for it...however...it is preferable and encouraged...to make an effort to purchase a tallit which is obligated in tsitsit, and to make tsitsit for it, and to wear it all the time, or much of the time, <strong>to achieve the objective of this exalted mitsvah, which is \"and you shall see it\", etc. [i.e. and you will remember all of God's mitsvot and do them, and you will not stray after your hearts and after your eyes which you lust after, so that you remember and perform all of my mitsvot, and be sanctified to your God</strong>]. (Dana's Hebrew translation pp. 270-271).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonah_Gerondi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yonah of Girona</a> writes (Sefer HaYirah) that one should make a point of wearing tsitsit since it will remind him of the mitsvot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויהיה לו טלית קטן וילבשנו...כי עיקר מצות ציצית לזכרון ללבשו תמיד</p>\n  \n  <p>And he should have a tallit kattan and wear it...For the root of the mitsvah of tsitsit is as a remembrance, he should always wear it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is paraphrased by the Tur (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Tur,_Orach_Chaim.24?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 24</a>) who writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טוב ונכון להיות כל אדם זהיר וזריז במצות ציצית שיהיה לו בגד קטן מצוייץ שילבש אותו כל היום כי עיקר מצותה על זכירת המצות ובכל שעה ובכל רגע צריך לכך</p>\n  \n  <p>It is good and proper for every person to be careful and proactive regarding the mitsvah of tsitsit, to have a <em>tallit kattan</em> with tsitsit to wear all day, for the main [purpose] of the mitsvah is to remember the mitsvot, and one needs this every hour and every moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is in turn cited by the Shulhan Arukh (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.24.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 24:1</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְטוֹב וְנָכוֹן לִהְיוֹת כָּל אָדָם זָהִיר לִלְבֹּשׁ טַלִּית קָטָן כָּל הַיּוֹם, כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּזְכֹּר הַמִּצְוֹת בְּכָל רֶגַע.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is good and proper for every person to be careful to wear a tallit kattan all day so that he remember the mitsvot all the time</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, neither Rambam, nor Rabbenu Avraham, nor Rabbenu Yonah, nor the Tur, not the Shulhan Arukh encourage making the effort to wear tsitsit because it is a situational mitsvah, such that you would ask about all other situational mitsvot. Rather, they explain that the particular emphasis on this mitsvh, is due to the unique role of this mitsvah; driving us to remember and perform all of the mitsvot.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In a different vein, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_ben_Moshe_Levi_Moelin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharil</a> writes (Shu\"t HaHadashot: 7) that one should wear tsitsit simply because it is a mitsvah and one should pursue mitsvot. He makes clear that one is not obligated to acquire a garment with tsitsit, but that it is good to pursue mitsvot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין מחוייב לקנות בת ד' אלא דמצוה להכניס עצמו לכלל חיוב כדילפינן ממשה רבינו ע\"ה וכי לאכול (מפיריה) [מפריה] כו' </p>\n  \n  <p>One is not required to acquire a four cornered garment, but it is a mitsvah to bring oneself into the realm of the mitsvah, as we learn from Moshe [who wanted to enter Israel to perform more mitsvot].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Torah mentions the Mitzva of Tzitzis in Parshas Shelach - Perek 15, Verses 37 - 41. Rashi (Pasuk 41) brings a P'shat from Rabbi Moshe hadarshan <a href=\"http://Rabbi%20Moshe%20hadarshan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_ha-Darshan</a> who says the reason why Tzitzis is mentioned next to Shabbos & Avoda Zara is because all 3 of these Mitzvos are equal to all the other Mitzvos (my interpretation - in importance), as the Pasuk by Tzitzis says ועשיתם את כל מצותי. Perhaps this is the reason why Chazal instituted we wear a garment that would require us to put on Tzitzis, so we can be get a zchus in a Mitzva equal to all the Mitzvos. </p>\n\n\n",

The custom amongst Ashkenazi Jewry is to get undressed from top to bottom.[10]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The footnotes which I shall quote below quote the sources and give an explanation, in some detail. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[3] See Toras Yekusiel 1/8 and 101 for a thorough discussion on this matter.</p>\n  \n  <p>Background:</p>\n  \n  <p>The Chassidim and Ashkenazim practice different orders in dress. The Chassidim get dressed starting from the top, while the Ashkenazim from the bottom. The order of getting dressed and undressed is discussed in Tractate Derech Eretz Zuta and Raba. It is also mentioned with regards to how the Kohanim would dress in their priestly garb when serving in the Temple. In Derech Eretz Zuta 8 it states to get undressed from bottom to top [and hence one is to get dressed from top to bottom]. In however Derech Eretz 10 it implies one is to get undressed from top to bottom, and so is the order of dress of the Kohanim. The following are the opinions and reasons behind the customs.</p>\n  \n  <p>[4] Miseches Derech Eretz Zuta chapter 8; Oar Tzaddikim 1/8; Toras Yekusiel 1/8 and 101; Mishneh Sachir 2/2; Minchas Yitzchak 4/60; Shulchan Hatahor Tznius 4; Kaneh Bosem 2/1; Shraga Hameir 1/24; Piskeiy Teshuvos 2/4</p>\n  \n  <p>The source: In Derech Eretz Zuta 8 it states to get undressed from bottom to top [and hence one is to get dressed from top to bottom]. The Sefer Oar Tzaddikim ibid of Rav Meir Papirish, a student of the Arizal, writes to precede the Tzitzis to the pants. The Minchas Yitzchak ibid writes this order as a tradition from the Tzaddik of Ziditchov. He then concludes that this is the “custom of all the G-d fearing”; The Shulchan Hatahor ibid writes that those that get dressed and undressed the opposite way are considered Perutzim [licentious].</p>\n  \n  <p>The reason: This order is followed in order so one precedes his Tzitzis which is a Mitzvah to other clothing. [Oar Tzaddikim ibid; Toras Yekusiel ibid]</p>\n  \n  <p>[5] Ben Ish Chaiy Vayishlach 16; Kaf Hachaim 2/9; Minchas Yitzchak 4/60</p>\n  \n  <p>[6] Toras Yekusiel ibid based on the order mentioned in Derech Eretz 10, and the order of dress and undress of the Kohanim mentioned in Yuma 23. The Kaneh Bosem ibid writes that the Ashkenazim misunderstood the wording in Derech Eretz 10 and in truth it is a source for the Chassidic custom and not the Ashkenazi custom, and so retracts also the Toras Yekusiel in a latter response that he made a mistake in the understanding. The dispute stands as with regards to if the word Pirkoso is understood to mean pants or shirt. Since it is the last item mentioned there to remove, therefore if it’s translated as pants it is a source for the Ashkenazim. If it is translated as shirt then it is a source for the Chassidim.</p>\n  \n  <p>The reason: This order is followed in order so one covers his Erva as soon as possible. [Toras Yekusiel ibid]</p>\n  \n  <p>[7] See previous footnotes</p>\n  \n  <p>[8] Toras Yekusiel 1/8 and 101; Mishneh Sachir 2/2; Minchas Yitzchak 4/60: “custom of all the G-d fearing”; Shulchan Hatahor Tznius 4; Kaneh Bosem 2/1; Piskeiy Teshuvos 2/4</p>\n  \n  <p>[9] Minchas Yitzchak 4/60; Piskeiy Teshuvos 2/12; See Shaareiy Teshuvah 2/3; Birkeiy Yosef 2</p>\n  \n  <p>[10] Toras Yekusiel ibid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If one forgets, he may count the next day without a blessing.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it is as you surmised. The congregation is doing it as a reminder. It would help, perhaps, if you stated what type of shul, congregation you attend. I'm guessing that it is not Orthodox. No Orthodox shul that I have attended does this congregationally, as many of their people have counted at night either by attending the minyan, or they assume that people have done it. Regardless, most shuls will have the Gabbai announce after davening, \"Last night we counted xx\", and that reminds someone who forgot to say it, himself. I.e., no Orthodox place I know of does a congregational counting during the day.</p>\n\n<p>It's possible that your shul may have less or non-educated people or travelers / visitors attending Shacharit who don't know the bracha and the rules that well. You're rav may be trying to cater to their needs.</p>\n\n\n",

The mishnah project was launched by Rabbi Aqiva. Many mishnayos were composed by his student Rav Meir, and the project was completed by Rav Meir's student, Rav Yehudah haNasi (\"Rebbe\"). This means that any mishnah that presents a position as settled law, rather than a given tanna's opinion, is in the vast majority of cases, Rav Meir's. (C.f. Sanhedrin 86b)</p>\n\n<p>2- \"Rav Meir\" appears in the mishnah 208 times, and 248 times in the Tosefta. Another 482 mentions in the two talmuds So, we do indeed call the tana \"Rav Meir\" quite often!</p>\n\n<p>3- The idiom \"Acheirim omerim\" (\"'Others' say\") only appears 5 (!) times in the mishnah, 11 times in the Tosefta, and 79 times in the Talmuds. Far from supplanting mention of \"Rav Meir\", it is far <strong>less</strong> used!</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, R' Meir is only called \"Acheirim\" when the quote is from the period of R' Meir's life when he was relating to Acheir and the provenance of the quote is suspect. Not so much a commentary on R' Meir -- since otherwise his name wouldn't be the mishnah's overwhelming choice (98% of the time), as a commentary on the specific quote. With negative implications about Rabbi Meir as someone capable of bringing questionable statements.</p>\n\n<p>But even though \"Acheirim\" is used in the minority of cases, it is true that we don't mention Rav Meir's name very often.</p>\n\n<p>Eruvin 13b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנא: לא \"רבי מאיר\" שמו, אלא \"רבי נהוראי\" שמו. ולמה נקרא שמו \"רבי מאיר\"? שהוא מאיר עיני חכמים בהלכה. ולא \"נהוראי\" שמו, אלא \"רבי נחמיה\" שמו; ואמרי לה: \"רבי אלעזר בן ערך\" שמו. ולמה נקרא שמו \"נהוראי\"? שמנהיר עיני חכמים בהלכה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.13b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Translation-commentary by R' Edin Steinzaltz</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>It was taught</strong> in a <em>baraita</em>: <strong>Rabbi Meir was not his name; rather, Rabbi Nehorai was his name. And why was he called by the name Rabbi Meir? It was because he illuminates [meir] the eyes of the Sages in</strong> matters <strong>of the halakha. And Rabbi Nehorai was not the name</strong> of the <em>tanna</em> known by that name; <strong>rather, Rabbi Neḥemya was his name, and some say: Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh was his name. And why was he called</strong>by the <strong>name Rabbi Nehorai? It is because he enlightens [<em>manhir</em>] the eyes of the Sages in</strong> matters of <strong>the <em>halakha</em>.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, \"Rabbi Meir\" was an honorific, and his real name was either \"Rabbi Nehorai\" -- which is a pretty close Aramaic equivalent to \"Meir\". Or that too was an honorific and his real name was Rabbi Nechemiah or Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Nehorai: 3 times\nRabbi Nechemia: 20 times\nR' Elazar ben Arakh: 3 times -- all in Avos (2:8-9), no halachic mentions</p>\n\n<p>So, whatever Rav Meir's real name was, the mishnah really doesn't mention it much!</p>\n\n\n",

But i will cite a few Jewish sources that deal with few of your issues.</p>\n<p>Your problem with how the Torah can command to kill \"all that breathes\" is already dealt with by the Rishonim. In the letters of the Remah (26-27) we find that he asked his Rabbis in Lunel how the Torah can command us to kill all the inhabitants of the Ir hanidachas, even the little ones that are innocent? The answer they give is,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לרדות הגדולים בהריגתן שהן חביבין עליהן</p>\n<p>it is done in order to threaten the adults with their execution, for\nthey cherish them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>another answer is given there by R Aharon of Lunel</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חומר הוא שהחמיר הקב\"ה בע\"ז ושבועה וחילול ה', להחרים ולהשמיד הכל למען\nישמעו ויראו הנשארים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of these explanations have their own difficulties, but i will not elaborate on them. The Rambam seems to offer a different explanation in his Moreh (1:54)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודע, כי אמרו, 'פוקד עון אבות על בנים' - אמנם חטא בחטא של 'עבודה זרה'\nלבד, לא\nבחטא אחר\n...\nוזאת המצוה, מצאנוה נמשך ב'תורה' בכל מקום, כמו שצותה ב'עיר הנדחת'\nהחרם אותה את כל אשר בה\" - כל זה למחות הרושם ההוא המביא להפסד הגדול,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over here the Rambam suggests that it is the verse 'פוקד עון אבות על בנים' that allows us to punish people who worship idols so severely, and to make an exception to the rule. However, it is not clear if we can apply this to pagans as well, since they never accepted the covenant at Sinai. In any case, we can infer from from this Rambam that when it comes to the sin - of worshiping idols - there are exceptions to the rule. This might be the answer to your question regarding the biblical contradiction. (Note also that the biblical prohibition not to kill sons for the sins of their fathers was said only regarding the killing of the Israelite's not Canaanites).</p>\n<p>The Rambam also writes in that chapter,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הלא תסתכל בכתובי ה'תורה' כאשר צוה לאבד 'שבעה עממים' ואמר, \"לא תחיה כל\nנשמה\", סמך לו מיד, \"למען אשר לא ילמדו אתכם לעשות ככל תועבותם אשר עשו\nלאלוהיהם, וחטאתם ליי אלוהיכם\". יאמר, לא תחשוב שזו אכזריות או בקשת\nגאולת דם, אבל הוא פועל שיגזור אותו הדעת האנושי, שיוסר כל מי שיטה מדרך\nהאמת ויורחקו המונעים כולם אשר ימנעו מן השלמות אשר הוא השגתו ית</p>\n<p>You have, no doubt, noticed in the Torah how the commandment to\nannihilate the seven nations, and \"to save alive nothing that\nbreatheth\" (Deut. xx. 16) is followed immediately by the words, \"That\nthey teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have\ndone unto their gods: so should you sin against the Lord your God\"\n(ib. 18); that is to say, you shall not think that this commandment\nimplies an act of cruelty or of retaliation; it is an act demanded by\nthe tendency of man to remove everything that might turn him away from\nthe right path, and to clear away all obstacles in the road to\nperfection, that is, to the knowledge of God.</p>\n<p>Maimonides, Moses. The Guide for the Perplexed (p. 57).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the war against the Midianites, it seems that the object of the war was to take revenge of the Midianites for luring the Israelites into their trap. Perhaps this is the reason for their harsh treatment. We find a similar attitude towards the Amalekites, in which we are commanded to kill all of them (even little ones) and to blot out their names and to avenge the blood of the innocents that were attacked for no obvious reason. See also Ramban bamidbar 31:6, who also makes this obvious connection.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Paskening Shlomo out of Shamayim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>R' Yehudah tells us in the name of Shmuel (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin_104b.13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 104b</a>) that the Anshei Kenesses HaGedolah wanted to include Shlomo HaMelech on the list of kings who lost their portion of Olam Haba. An image of David HaMelech had prostrated itself before them, beseeching them not to include him in his merit, but they ignored it. A fire came out of the Kodesh Kadashim, presumably invoking Shlomo's merit of having built the Beis HaMikdash, but they ignored that as well. A Bas Kol rang out, invoking the merit that Shlomo built the Beis HaMikdash before his own palace, and was much more diligent in building the former than the latter, but they still ignored it. Finally, a Bas Kol rang out, telling them that Shlomo would be welcomed into Olam Haba regardless of what they would say - the Chachamim can only decide Halacha, not whether a person should be welcomed into Olam Haba. At that point, the Anshei Keneses HaGedolah conceded and left Shlomo's name out of the Mishnah. </p>\n\n<p>What exactly is this back and forth? If the Chachamim can't determine whether a person should enter Olam Haba, why was that Bas Kol not the first proof? Why were Shlomo's merits not invoked before his father's? And why did the Chachamim reject each one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yosef Chaim of Baghdad</a> discusses this in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14476&st=&pgnum=98&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his commentary</a> to this Talmudic passage. His answer is that the whole thing was a mere ploy. The Sages actually knew that Shlomo was a worthy person and they never entertained the notion that he was in the same category as those who have no share in Olam Haba. </p>\n\n<p>However, the verse in I Kings 11:6 states that Shlomo did evil in the eyes of God. The Sages themselves knew that this merely referred to the fact that he did not protest to his wives. According to the Talmud elsewhere, one who can protest sin but does not is considered complicit in the sin. However, the fools do not know this, and when reading the verse they would think that Shlomo actually was himself a sinner no different from those who lost their share in Olam Haba. Therefore, the Sages decided to stand up for Shlomo's honor. They knew that if they would try to categorize Shlomo with the others, Heaven would defend him and it would become clear to everyone that Shlomo was <em>not</em> bad, thus silencing the aforementioned fools. </p>\n\n<p>The reason that they did not stop after the first response was that they wanted another response to reinforce the point even more. Thus, they \"ignored\" the image of Dovid, and again they ignored the fire, and yet again they ignored the first Bas Kol, so that God would have to furnish more and  more miraculous proof. Finally, after the second Bas Kol they stopped because at that point it was enough to silence anyone who would speak against Shlomo.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vK8Dc.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vK8Dc.jpg\" alt=\"Image of text of commentary\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are these the examples of HaShem abrogating nature?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 14:1) presents several expositions of the following verses (Tehillim 60:9-10):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To Me is Gilead and to Me is Menasheh. Ephraim is the stronghold of My head, and Yehudah is My lawgiver. Moav is My washbasin. On Edom will I cast My shoes. Acclaim Me, Peleshes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In one exposition, the Midrash interprets each clause as a proof against Hashem's critics. If you don't want to read through my paraphrase of the Midrash, a summary appears just before my question after the horizontal line below. </p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe that HaShem can revive the dead, \"To Me is Gilead\" - Eliyahu from Gilead already did so, and he can bear testimony that HaShem can do the same. </p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe that HaShem accepts ba'alei teshuvah, \"To Me is Menasheh\" - that is, King Menasheh, whose teshuvah was accepted in spite of such severe sins. </p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe that HaShem remembers barren women, \"Ephraim is is the stronghold of My head\" - go to Elkanah from Har Ephraim, whose wife Chanah was remembered. </p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe that HaShem abrogates nature for the righteous, \"Yehudah is My lawgiver\" - Chananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were saved from fire, and Daniel from lions, all of whom were descendants of Yehudah. </p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe HaShem can heal people, \"Moav is My washbasin\" - go to Na'aman, who was healed through water, or Moshe, who was saved through water. (The Midrash explains why each one is called \"Moav.\")</p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe HaShem can save from the gallows, \"Upon Edom do I cast my locks*\" - not only was Mordechai saved from the gallows, but it was thrown back at Haman, an Edomi. </p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe that HaShem can save a person without a sword or spear, \"Regarding Peleshes do they shout triumphantly**\" - David defeated Golias without such weapons. </p>\n\n<p>*The word \"na'al\" literally means \"shoe,\" but the Midrash homiletically interprets it as being related to the word for \"closing,\" and thus translates it as something which \"locks\" air out of one's lungs - a gallows. </p>\n\n<p>**The phrase is \"alei Peleshes hisro'a'i.\" On a simple level, the object is the speaker of the verse, and the subject is Peleshes, but the Midrash interprets the subject as an unspecified group of people and the object as Peleshes, based on a passuk in Shmuel Aleph. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>TL;DR, the Pesukim in Tehillim 60:9-10 are interpreted in this exposition as various proofs that HaShem can (a) revive the dead, (b) accept repentants, (c) allow barren women to give birth, (d) abrogate nature for the righteous, (e) heal people from disease, (f) save from the gallows - and, further, place that decree on the one who issued it, and (g) allow one to win a battle without ordinary weapons. </p>\n\n<p>To me, the common denominator is that HaShem can go against the usual nature of the world as He sees fit. Ordinarily, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/26237/9682\">the dead stay dead</a>, people must deal with the consequences of their actions, barren women don't give birth, fire burns and lions devour, the sickly die of disease, those decreed to die are killed, and the stronger of two combatants wins. The point of these Pesukim, it seems, is that HaShem can go against how the world normally runs as He sees fit. </p>\n\n<p>If so, why do the Pesukim leave out other fundamentals, such as that HaShem punishes people for their actions (s'char v'onesh), that ordinarily a field only produces according to that which one plants, yet the righteous can get significantly more, as proven by Yitzchak Avinu (Bereishis 26)? Or that an enslaved, lowly, downtrodden people can rise to be the grandest of all, as proven by Moshe Rabbeinu when he redeemed the Jews from Mitzraim? Of all of the examples that the Midrash/passuk could have brought that HaShem abrogates nature as He sees fit, why did it pick on these seven?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the Midrash imply that one should give up his life for \"smaller\" mitzvos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Midrash (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bemidbar_Rabbah.14.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 14:6</a>) expounds the Pesukim in Koheles (8:2-3):</p>\n\n<p>Based on several incidents, the Midrash interprets \"ani\" as indicating that one's awe should be over you. Thus, \"Ani, the king's command, obey\" means \"obey the king's command to fear him.\" I.e. don't rebel against him.</p>\n\n<p>You might think this is true even if he says to disobey the Torah; therefore the passuk continues, \"and above, the word of an oath of G-d.\" Just like one may not obey his parents if they tell him to disobey the Torah (specifically Shabbos is the example brought), so may one not obey a king if he tells him to disobey the Torah. Fine. </p>\n\n<p>The Midrash continues: \"Do not become flustered by his countenance and go\" - even if he becomes angry with you, do not sin. It brings a proof that \"countenance\" indicates anger from a passuk in Daniel and that \"going\" means sinning from a passuk in Tehillim. \"Do not stand because of an evil thing\" - do not sin because of his threats. In the Midrash's wording, \"that you should not be scared by his evil thing he says to you, that he'll burn you, that he'll kill you, that he'll torture you if you don't listen to him.\" </p>\n\n<p>Yet, the Gemara (Sanhedrin 74a) says that, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/26237/9682\">typically speaking</a>, one does not have to give up his life to fulfill mitzvos. So how can the Midrash say that one should not listen to the king's decree even on pain of death? From the comparison to parents ordering their children to disobey Shabbos, it sounds like that is the case of the king as well - ordering his subjects to disobey the \"lighter\" mitzvos. How can this be, when we have a rule that one shouldn't give up his life in such circumstances?</p>\n\n<p>Granted, the above Gemara also says that in a time of persecution (read: they want you to denounce Judaism), one should be killed even for a well-rooted minhag such as the order of tying one's shoes (see Rashi there). The discussion of a king being upset with his subject would seem to indicate that he simply wants him to violate the Torah, not that he wants him to give up Yiddishkeit. Must we deduce that a king's order is comparable to a time of persecution, and if so, why?</p>\n\n\n",

So it is appropriate to precede Ashrei with a request that \"Your house\" be rebuilt so we can all return there etc.</p>\n\n<p>Koh Keli is a \"pre-mussaf\" prayer because Ashrei is the usual pre-mussaf prayer/intro and Koh Keli introduces Ashrei. It was intended to get the community to keenly feel the lack of the Temple and the Land of Israel which is the only place to offer the real musaf korbanos. <strong>The one who wrote the piyut seemed to want the congregation to cultivate this in mind during the words of Ashrei so they would already have such a feeling flaming in their heart as Musaf started.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hinneni he'ani... means \"Behold I am a poor man...\". It is the Chazzan's job to be the people's representative to lead the Musaf prayer. This job starts with the Kaddish before Musaf (which is after Ashrei). You need a Chazzan to recite Kaddish and everyone answers. Ashrei doesn't need a Chazzan.</p>\n\n<p>So, right before the Chazzan begins his job, he declares how unworthy he is and begs Hashem that his and the congregation's prayers are accepted etc.</p>\n\n<p>That's the difference. :)</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishna Berurah continues & says if a child defecated in middle of Shemonah Esrei (which is a Biblical prohibition to Daven in front of), one cannot continue Davening there as is & one is even allowed to speak if necessary & tell the other Congregants around him they need to move.</p>\n\n<p>So in summary we see that even for a Rabbinic prohibition one is allowed to walk to a different spot during Shemona Esrei & this does not constitute a Hefsek in one's Davening.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Pirkei Avot 2:1 - What does “major” vs. “minor” mean in terms of Rabbinical vs. Torah mitzvot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Follow up to this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/80948/5275\">M.Y. question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Pirkei Avot says that we should not compare \"major\" vs. \"minor\" mitzvoth for we don't know the reward given to mitzvoth.</p>\n\n<p>Frequently, we actually DO equate two mitzvoth. If one is in a situation where he has to violate a mitzvah, one is Rabbinical and one is Torah-based, usually, one violates the Rabbinical one. Generally, less importance is placed on the Rabbinical mitzvoth than the Torah ones.</p>\n\n<p>My rav explained to me that because of this perceived lack of importance, there are many cases where the rabbis placed heavy or more emphasis on performing a rabbinical mitzvah over a Torah-based one.</p>\n\n<p>An example that I can think of - There are some opinions that state that the mitzvah of studying Torah is from the Torah. Reading the Megillah on Purim is Rabbinical. However, O.C. (I'll edit location, later, B\"N) says that one needs to stop studying Torah in order to read the Megillah when the time to do so has arrived.</p>\n\n<p>So, in general, if one has a choice (unlike, the above example, where no \"choice\" is given) between performing a Rabbinical or Torah mitzvah, does the adage of Pirkei Avot that one should not equate the two apply to this choice as well? Or should one favor the Torah-based one at all times? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>With regard to the specific example in the question--the Gemara Megilla 3a says that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כהנים בעבודתן ולוים בדוכנן וישראל במעמדן כולן מבטלין עבודתן ובאין\nלשמוע מקרא מגילה מכאן סמכו של בית רבי שמבטלין תלמוד תורה ובאין לשמוע\nמקרא מגילה קל וחומר מעבודה</p>\n<p>Priests at their [Temple] service, Levites\non their platform, lay Israelites at their station — all desist from\ntheir service in order to come and hear the reading of the Megillah.\nIt was in reliance on this dictum that the members of the house of\nRabbi were wont to desist from the study of the Torah in order to come\nand hear the reading of the Megillah. They argued a fortiori from the\ncase of the [Temple] service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a dispute between Ran and Taz how to understand the Gemara. According to  Ran (among others) this does not mean that if one must choose between the two, one reads the Megillah, but rather that one reads the Megillah <em>first</em>, and then performs the other mitzvah. If one could perform only one, it would be the <em>avodah</em>, and not Megillah. However, Taz (OC 687) disagrees and maintains that the Megillah has priority even when one can only perform one mitzvah. Even according to Taz, this is a special rule regarding Megillah, but it does not apply to other mitzvot derabbanan. Taz explains that Megillah has the status of a Biblical mitzvah because it is <em>mi-divrei kabbalah</em>--prophetically sanctioned--and not an ordinary rabbinic mitzvah. Thus, we see that in the case of an ordinary rabbinic mitzvah, one would not prioritize it over a biblical mitzvah.</p>\n<p>Seemingly, then, the Mishnah in Avot does not mean that one can prioritize rabbinic mitzvot over biblical ones. Rambam in his commentary on the Mishnah cites the rule of העוסק במצוה פטור מן המצוה, one who is involved in a mitzvah is exempt from another mitzvah, as a corollary of the principle of this Mishnah. With regard to העוסק במצוה, R. Elchanan Wasserman (Kovetz Shiurim 2:32) is unsure whether this applies to a mitzvah derabbanan as well. Even if we assume it does, though, this would not mean that one can give the rabbinic mitzvah priority when one is not yet involved in it.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Yosef_David_Azulai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chida</a>, in his commentary <a href=\"http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?10420&pageid=P0014L\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Z'roa Yemin</a> on the Mishnah suggests the following interpretation as well: הוי זהיר במצוה קלה--be scrupulous about a rabbinic mitzvah, such as the restriction about blowing shofar on Rosh Hashanah that falls on Shabbat, כבחמורה, as for a biblical mitzvah such as shofar itself; והוי מחשב שכר מצוה כנגד הפסדה, and keep in mind that the risk of violating the rabbinic command may be greater than the reward of fulfilling the biblical mitzvah...)</p>\n\n\n",

But it is eliminated on days when Yizkor is recited.</p>\n<p>What is the reason for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First it is worth noting that among communities that customarily recite it, it is not universally accepted that it is not to be said on days when Yizkor is recited. See R. Yosef Adler's Al Pi ha-Torah (Leviticus, p. 416) where he cites divergent practices on the matter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פיוט יה אלי וגואלי יש שאין אומרים אותו ביום שאומרים יזכור (סדור הגר\"א\nליקוטי  מהרי\"ח מנהגי יום א' דפסח ועוד) ויש שנוהגים לאומרו גם ביום\nשאומרים יזכור  (דברי אהרן קרלין עמוד רכ\"ב ועוד)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, R. Simha Rabinowitz (Pisqe Teshubhoth, 5:488) gives the following explanation for those that refrain on such days:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וביו\"ט שחל בחול לאחר ההפטרה אומרים פיוט יה אלי וכו וביום שמזכירין\nנשמות אין אומרים אותו כיון שכבר אומרים כל הציבור אב הרחמים' ואין\nמטריחין על הציבור יותר מדאי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That since the congregation has already said Abh ha-Rahamim during Yizkor, further reciting י-ה א-לי would constitute טרחא דציבורא (a burden on the congregation).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did HaShem \"need\" the punishment to be a day for a year by the Meraglim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi to Bamidbar 13:25 writes that since the punishment for the spies' false report was to be one year of wandering for each day in Eretz Yisrael, HaShem allowed them to finish miraculously in just 40 days so that they would only be in the desert for 40 years and not longer. </p>\n\n<p>HaShem can do whatever He wants. Why must the punishment have been a year for a day such that He was \"forced\" to do the above miracle? Why didn't he allow them to finish in, say, 80 days, and the punishment would have been a year for every two days?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would argue that the premise of your question is slightly flawed. Rashi doesn't say that God was <em>forced</em> to do anything. What he says is that God knew that he would decree a punishment of a year per day (אלא שגלוי לפני הקב\"ה שיגזור עליהם יום לשנה) and thus he shortened their travel time to 40 days. God wasn't <em>forced</em> to make the punishment a year for a day; theoretically it is conceivable that He could have made the punishment a day for a day, a week for a day, a month for a day, a decade for a day, etc. But — for whatever reason — God had <em>decided</em> that a year for a day would be the correct punishment. Therefore, He shortened the travel time so that the punishment should not exceed 40 years.</p>\n<p>So essentially there need not be any answer to this question, because we can simply reject the question as being invalid. God had simply decided that the correct punishment would be a year for a day, and as the prophet said (Isaiah 55:8-9):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the Talmud states explicitly that the appropriate punishment was a year for a day, because God considers one day of sin as akin to a full year of sin:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=13&daf=5b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 5b</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נפק ר' יוחנן לבי מדרשא ודרש ואותי יום יום ידרשון ודעת דרכי יחפצון וכי ביום דורשין אותו ובלילה אין דורשין אותו אלא לומר לך כל העוסק בתורה אפי' יום אחד בשנה מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו עסק כל השנה כולה <strong>וכן במדת פורענות דכתיב במספר הימים אשר תרתם את הארץ וכי ארבעים שנה חטאו והלא ארבעים יום חטאו אלא לומר לך כל העובר עבירה אפי' יום אחד בשנה מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו עבר כל השנה כולה</strong></p>\n<p>R. Johanan then went forth to the\nCollege and delivered the [following] exposition: Yet they seek Me day by day, and delight to know\nMy ways. Do they then seek Him by day, and do not seek Him by might? It comes to tell you.\ntherefore, that whoever studies the Torah even one day in the year, Scripture accounts it to him as\nthough he had studied the whole year through. <strong>And similarly in the case of punishment, for it is\nwritten: After the number of the days in which you spied out the land. Did they then sin forty\nyears? Was it not forty days that they sinned? It must come to teach you, therefore, that whoever\ncommits transgression even one day in the year, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had\ntransgressed the whole year through.</strong> (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Chagigah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once again, it is simply a statement of fact that one day of sin is viewed by God as a full year of sin, for whatever the reason may be. But, that being the case, in order to have the punishment be precisely 40 years it was necessary to expedite the journey to precisely 40 days.</p>\n\n\n",

Qafih</a> there), but does not specify that the danger is because of demons.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, as noted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mas%27ud_Hai_Rakkah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'aseh Rokeah</a> to Rambam there, according to Rambam's reason (concern for contaminants falling into food), the concern only applies to uncovered foods.</p>\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruch_HaShulchan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arokh Hashulhan</a> (YD 116:11) states that people are not generally stringent with this.[i] Similarly, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Danzig\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Binat Adam</a> (Issur V'heter 63 (82)) emphasises that people are not generally careful with this, and writes that perhaps it is not a concern once people don't worry about it (<em>d'dashi bah rabbim</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not one should do so in the first place, if one left food under a bed, it is permissible, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Joseph_Reischer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Jacob Reischer</a> (Shvut Ya'akov 2:105) cited in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Hirsch_ben_Jacob_Eisenstadt_of_Byelostok\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pit'hey Teshuva</a> (YD 116:4).</p>\n\n<p>Others are stringent, such as Hida (Shiurei Berakha 116) quoted in Yabia Omer 1 Y.D. 9:22 (who cites others who share that view), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Elijah of Vilnius</a> quoted by Binat Adam there (although we do not know if this was a personal stringency, or a universal ruling of his.))</p>\n\n<p>Whether one attributes this to demons, or to other damaging things that might end up in your food left in an unsanitary place, the problem described is not strictly speaking one of impurity. Nevertheless, later sources often compare or conflate various non-physical dangers (as our case may be), as does <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13303-schor-abraham-hayyim-ben-naphtali-hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Abraham Schor</a> in Torat Hayyim to Shavuot (15b) who uses the term 'impurity' in the context of demons.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, it should be clarified that neither the Bavli, nor the Yerushalmi, nor Rambam (nor the Tur  YD 116, nor the Shulhan Arukh YD 116:5) limit the halakha to a case where someone slept on the bed while the food was under it. Nevertheless, Yabia Omer (YD 1:9:5) cites <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Palachi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Hayyim Palagi</a> (Lev Hayyim 1:66) who infers from the Torat Hayyim to Shavuot, that the concern is only where one slept over the foods.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] It could be understood that he means that people are not careful with raw food in particular, but I don't think that is his intent, particularly given the fact that he is clearly basing himself on the Binat Adam.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Whose life comes first? Apparently contradictory Rabbinical statements\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There seem to be two contradictory statements of the Rabbis.</p>\n\n<p>One is: <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%93_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 74a</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי יימר דדמא דידך סומק טפי דילמא דמא דההוא גברא סומק טפי </p>\n  \n  <p>who knows whether your blood is redder than his blood, maybe  his\n  blood  is redder than  your blood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This refers to a case where one is told to kill another Jew on pain of death. One may not kill. So one has to give up one's life which implies precedence given to the life of the other person.</p>\n\n<p>The other is: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=62&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bovo Metzia 62a</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייך קודמים לחיי חבירך </p>\n  \n  <p>your life and your friend's life, your life comes first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This refers to the case of two people on a journey with sufficient water for only one  to get to his destination. Rabbi Akiva teaches that your life comes first.  </p>\n\n<p>At first sight the statements seem contradictory. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I just learned this in two different classes.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the two people in the desert, the one who drinks the water will live and the one who doesn't will die, but the one who drinks the water <em>is not actively killing the other</em> -- he's just drinking his water.  The other person isn't being murdered; he's dying of thirst.  R' Akiva's teaching is akin to the instruction anyone who's flown has heard: secure your own oxygen mask first before helping others.  You are required to protect your own life first, according to R' Akiva.  (Note: there are also cases where we're required to intervene, e.g. to save someone from a pursuer, which were addressed in the aforementioned classes but seem beyond the scope of this question.)</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the person who was ordered to kill another or be killed himself, however, saving himself would require <em>positive action to kill the other</em>.  That's murder and he must instead give up his own life.  It's not so much that the other's life takes precedence; <em>neither</em> life takes precedence over the other, but not violating the commandment against murder takes precedence over saving one's life.</p>\n\n<p>What about a case where the other person will be killed (not die of other causes) but you don't do it yourself?  Can you take <em>positive action</em> that leads to someone's death at another's hand? Yerushalmi Terumot 8:4 talks about this case.  If bandits set upon a group and say to them: \"give up one of your number for us to kill and we'll spare the rest of you\", they do not comply -- even though they are not actively doing the killing, they are still deciding whom to kill.  That's on the wrong side of the line.  If the bandits specified a particular person, however, the group can turn him over.  Reish Lakish says they can only turn him over if he's already liable for death (like Sheva ben Bichri in II Samuel 20), meaning that it's still not murder, but R' Yochanan says even if he's not already liable to death they can turn him over to the bandits to be murdered.  (I do not know which way <em>halacha</em> rules in the end; if this is a practical matter for you, please consult your rabbi.)</p>\n\n\n",

R’ Yehoshua ben Karchah sent him a message calling him “vinegar son of wine,” i.e. wicked son of righteous, and rebuked him for informing on G-d’s nation for them to be lead to their deaths. </p>\n\n<p>R’ Elazar responded that he was picking the thorns from the vineyard, i.e. he was only sending off those who truly deserved it. R’ Yehoshua responded that the Owner of the vineyard can take care of His vineyard just fine. </p>\n\n<p>One day, however, R’ Elazar had a man who insulted him be arrested, as only a wicked person would be insolent enough to act like that. Nevertheless, he regretted his decision later, but it was too late. His students assured him that it was okay; after all, this man was known to regularly spend his Yom Kippurs having intercourse with a Na’arah Me’orasah (two sins in one). R’ Elazar was calmed, and he said, “If my uncertainties are this accurate, certainly my certainties.” The story goes on to show that, just to be certain, he had a liposuction performed on himself and left the fats out in the sun in the heat of the summer, with the veins still in the fats (apparently requisite for them to dissolve?), yet the fats would not be dissolved.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Rambam and Shulchan Aruch</h2>\n\n<p>What we see from this story is that according to R’ Elazar, one is able to turn over criminals to the authorities, as HaShem doesn’t allow a righteous person to be killed; in contrast, R’ Yehoshua held that one should not take this upon oneself, but rather, he should let HaShem clear out His own vineyard. </p>\n\n<p>Rambam (Chovel U’Mazik 8:9) paskens like R’ Yehoshua to the extreme:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָסוּר לִמְסֹר הָאָדָם בְּיַד עַכּוּ''ם בֵּין בְּגוּפוֹ בֵּין בְּמָמוֹנוֹ. וַאֲפִלּוּ הָיָה רָשָׁע וּבַעַל עֲבֵרוֹת וַאֲפִלּוּ הָיָה מֵצֵר לוֹ וּמְצַעֲרוֹ. וְכָל הַמּוֹסְרוֹ בְּיַד עַכּוּ''ם בֵּין בְּגוּפוֹ בֵּין בְּמָמוֹנוֹ אֵין לוֹ חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא: </p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden for a person to hand over to the idolaters, whether his life or his money, even if he’s a wicked person who does many sins, and even if he is annoying and paining him. <strong>Anyone who hands over to idolaters, whether his life or his money, has no share in the World to Come.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (CM 388:9) rules similarly. The Rema adds a note about certain exceptions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור למסור לישראל ביד עכו\"ם בין בגופו בין בממונו ואפי' היה רשע ובעל עבירות ואפי' היה מצר לו ומצערו: הגה ודוקא בדברים בעלמא אבל אם מסרו מותר למוסרו דהרי יוכל להרגו בדין במקום שיש חשש שיחזור וימסרנו (הרא\"ש כלל י\"ו סי' א' וב' ותשו' רשב\"א סי' קפ\"א) או אם אי אפשר להציל עצמו בדרך אחר אבל אם אפשר להציל עצמו בדרך אחר הוי כשנים שמסרו זה את זה וכל מי שהפסיד חבירו יותר חייב לשלם המותר בנזק שלם (מרדכי פ' הנ\"ל ותשו' מיימוני הנ\"ל) וכל המוסר ישראל ביד עכו\"ם בין בגופו בין בממונו אין לו חלק לעולם הבא:</p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden for a person to hand over to an idolater, whether his life or his money, even if he is a wicked person who does many sins, and even if he is annoying and paining him. Rema: This is only in regard to Earthly matters, but if he had previously handed someone over to the authorities, one may hand him over, since according to the law one may kill him if there is room to worry that he will continue handing over. He may also hand him over if that’s the only way to escape; however, if he is able to escape in some other fashion, then it’s like two handing each other over, in which case whoever damages more pays the difference. Whoever hands a Jew over to the idolaters, whether his life or his money, has no share in the World to Come. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to address your questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Is there a Halachic obligation (besides for dinah d'malchuso) to report a crime to the non-Jewish (local/state/federal) authorities should one witness one?</strong> Forget dinah d’malchusa. Don’t report the crime. </li>\n<li><strong>Does it matter if the crime is something illegal according to Torah?</strong> No. Still forbidden. </li>\n<li><strong>Does it matter if the criminal is Jewish or not?</strong> Yes. All of the above sources discuss handing over Jews; there is no prohibition against handing over non-Jews; to them, we’re no different than any other law-abiding citizen, who would do the same. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>Thank you @DoubleAA for bringing this to my attention.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Does this apply to America?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/mesiralaw2.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apparently</a> there is a machlokes in the poskim as to whether this discussion remains in force today. </p>\n\n<p>In order to discuss this in respect to today’s society, though, we must first note a few things about today’s American government:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In general, the American government punishes exactly according to its legal code; there are no punishments given to one found innocent by the law, nor are there extra or different punishments given to one found guilty, beyond that which is stated in the relevant law codes. </li>\n<li>By the first amendment, punishments are given solely because one broke the law and not because of anti-Semitic motivations. </li>\n<li>In terms of American law, a Jew who refuses to go to Beis Din cannot be forced to go. </li>\n<li>Because of American law, Beis Din cannot enforce physical punishments, incarceration, or the like, nor can they exercise force in emergency situations. </li>\n<li>According to American law, there is no obligation to report a crime when one is not involved in it somehow. However, if one is summoned to testify, one must comply.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It should be emphasized at this point that, as per the above Rema, one must hand over someone who is a danger to society according to all opinions. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Aruch HaShulchan (CM 388:7) writes that in a government that gives right to property and where there is no fear of torture or death (unlike the Roman government discussed in the Gemara, which would seize property just because, and which would torture those that didn’t comply) one <strike>should</strike> may (thanks for the catch, @DovF) report crimes. R’ Elyashiv (the above article quotes Devar Sinai 45-46) writes similarly, but notes that Chillul HaShem could be a factor which must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. </li>\n<li>R’ Ezra Batzri in Dinei Mamonus 4:2:5n1 quotes the above Aruch HaShulchan and argues vehemently, that such opinions are set forth by naïve people. He holds that there are no just governments and no just prisons. So many problems can occur throughout the system that one must assume that injustices will occur, and so the rule that one may not inform still applies today. Pischei Choshen 5:12:5 in the notes there adds that prison today is such an awful place to be (studies show that 14% of inmates are assaulted in prison) that it would be forbidden to submit one to such treatment - and thus informing is forbidden. </li>\n<li>The issue at hand, if it’s one of fear of torture, is ultimately a question of being a rodef. According to Beis Yitzchak (YD 49:12), therefore, we can draw a distinction between cases of submitting one to a death penalty and submitting one to a monetary penalty. In the former case, it’s entirely forbidden; in the latter case, while it may be forbidden, he merely has to reimburse the fines. </li>\n<li>Rav Wozner (Shevet HaLevi YD 58) holds that one may inform the government when Jewish law accepts that part of secular law. For instance, one may be a tax collector, since Jews accept that they should pay taxes. In the above case in Bava Metzi’a, though, the issue is that handing them over is a life or death issue, and thus should be prohibited. It would come out, then, that according to this opinion, dinah d’malchusa is very relevant. </li>\n<li>R’ Moshe Feinstein, in Igros Moshe CM 1:8 and 5:9:11, writes that one may not inform, since he will be judged inconsistently with Jewish law. He notes further in CM 1:92 that one can work for the IRS since (presumably) the cheating will be detected in any event, and since there is no loss, there is no prohibition. Notice that in neither of these teshuvos does he discuss the justice of American law, clearly implying that the laws of informing still hold under today’s government. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Since everyone agrees that a danger to society may be turned over, seemingly the sources in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/86237/\">@mbloch’s excellent answer</a> can hold like any of these opinions.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>So, to readdress the questions in the OP:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Is there a Halachic obligation (besides for dinah d'malchuso) to report a crime to the non-Jewish (local/state/federal) authorities should one witness one?</strong> Depends on your posek: according to opinion 1, yes; according to opinions 2 and 5, no; according to opinions 3 and 4, it depends. </p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p><strong>Does it matter if the crime is something illegal according to Torah?</strong> According to opinion 1, no; it’s always permitted. According to opinions 2 and 5, no; it’s always prohibited. According to opinion 3, no; the distinction is whether it’s life-or-death or merely monetary; according to opinion 4, this depends on whether you consider dinah d’malchusa to be “illlegal according to Torah.”</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Does it matter if the criminal is Jewish or not?</strong> Yes. The answer to this question remains unchanged. </p></li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here are only two examples but see the following <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Chabad-leaders-call-for-reporting-child-abuse-to-secular-authorities-505513\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article from the Jerusalem Post</a>: <strong>Chabad leaders call to report child abuse to secular authorities</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Rabbinic leaders of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement have signed a\n  proclamation calling for the immediate reporting of child sexual abuse\n  and other kinds of abuse to secular authorities.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>“We recognize in light of past experiences that our communities could\n  have responded in more responsible and sensitive ways to help victims\n  and to hold perpetrators accountable,” reads the document.</p>\n  \n  <p>The proclamation outlines policies that all Lubavitch institutions,\n  including schools and synagogues, should adopt immediately. They\n  include educating staff in identifying, responding and reporting\n  sexual abuse, and teaching “body safety” to students. The document\n  also states that members of communities must be made aware when a sex\n  offender moves in to a community.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to child sexual abuse and other forms of child abuse, the\n  document includes domestic abuse, elder abuse and abuse of the\n  disabled.</p>\n  \n  <p>“The reporting of reasonable suspicions of all forms of child and\n  adult abuse and neglect directly and immediately to the civil\n  authorities is a requirement of Jewish law. There is no need to seek\n  rabbinic approval prior to reporting,” according to the document.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>In 2016, 300 Orthodox rabbis signed a proclamation</strong> [see bottom of this answer] <strong>urging those\n  suspecting child sex abuse to notify secular authorities and calling\n  on Jewish institutions to take preventative measures to prevent abuse.\n  The signatories included members of the Orthodox Union, Rabbinical\n  Council of America and Yeshiva University.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Members of Orthodox communities have traditionally hesitated to\n  involve outside authorities because of injunctions against “mesirah,”\n  or turning over a Jew to non-Jewish authorities, and publicly airing\n  allegations against fellow Jews, especially communal leaders.</p>\n  \n  <p>Abuse victims and their families in haredi Orthodox communities have\n  been expelled from religious schools and synagogues, shunned by\n  neighbors and targeted for harassment intended to destroy their\n  businesses or offered bribes to drop their cases.</p>\n  \n  <p>“Regardless of the standing of the abuser, accusers and their family,\n  members must be treated in an accepting, nonjudgmental manner so that\n  they feel safe and can therefore speak frankly and fully,” said the\n  Chabad statement. “This is necessary for them to receive suitable\n  therapeutic support, and in order to facilitate proper investigation\n  and pursuit of justice. Shunning or encouraging social ostracism of\n  victims, their families, or reporters is strictly forbidden.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Among those signing the document are Rabbis Yehoram Ulman and Moshe\n  Gutnick, senior dayanim, or judges, of the Sydney Beth Din, or\n  rabbinical court, in Australia; Rabbi Yosef Feigelstock, senior dayan\n  of the Beth Din, Argentina; Rabbi Baruch Hertz of Congregation Bnei\n  Ruven and the Chabad community of Illinois; Rabbi Yisroel Rosenfeld,\n  dean, Yeshiva Schools of Pittsburgh; Rabbi Yosef Shusterman, senior\n  Dayan and director, Chabad of Beverly Hills, California; and Rabbi\n  Mordechai Gutnick of the Melbourne Beth Din, Australia.</p>\n  \n  <p>The document concludes: “Ultimately, it is the halachic and moral\n  obligation of the entire Jewish community, individually and\n  collectively, to do all in our power to safeguard both children and\n  adults by preventing abuse and responding appropriately once instances\n  of abuse have occurred.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://crownheights.info/chabad-news/590817/7-chabad-rabbis-rule-abusers-may-reported/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more details and the official text including some sources.</p>\n\n<p>The \"Proclamation Regarding Child Safety in the Orthodox Jewish Community\" which the article also quotes is <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz4A_l7qN61RX1lWa3p2RUk2TXc/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Examples of oft-cited verses from Tanach that they use are:\n  “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?” (Isaiah\n  1:11); “For I spoke not unto your fathers . . . concerning\n  burnt-offerings or sacrifice. But this thing I commanded them: ‘Obey\n  My voice and I will be your God’” (Jeremiah 7:21); “For I [God] desire\n  mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than\n  burnt-offerings” (Hosea 6:6) and many others. But as is evident when\n  reading the verses in context, the prophets are not railing against\n  sacrifices per se, but rather against sacrifices that are not\n  accompanied by compassion for others and knowledge of God. In fact,\n  these very same prophets, Ezekiel in particular, prophesized about the\n  renewal of the sacrificial order.<sup>16</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>It is clear that animal sacrifices have deep spiritual value. Each one\n  of the Avot brought animal sacrifices. In numerous places throughout\n  Nach, the prophets express their longing for the restoration of the\n  Temple service. Finally, the Talmud takes it as a given that\n  sacrifices will be reinstated.</p>\n  \n  <p>So will there be sacrifices in the Third Temple? The overwhelming\n  majority opinion is that there will be. Rambam and Rav Kook seem to\n  share this view. It should be noted that while Rav Kook envisioned the\n  restoration of the sacrificial rite, in his view, that period would\n  also include a return of prophecy and the Divine spirit to the nation.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>16</sup> See <a href=\"http://jbq.jewishbible.org/assets/Uploads/362/362_Sacrifice.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jacob Chinitz, “Were the Prophets Opposed to\n  Sacrifice?,” Jewish Bible Quarterly 36 (April-June\n  2008):2,</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem was that people regarded korbanot in a way similar to the pagan idea of a magical action that would automatically bring <em>atonement</em> even if the halachos of the Torah were ignored. This is what the quoted citations in the question were referring to.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The context, the Soncino says, makes it evident that a contrast is\n  drawn between offerings on the altar and the moral laws enjoined in\n  the Decalogue. True, continual burnt-offerings were obligatory upon\n  the community, not upon the individual, but the prophet's scorn for\n  the misplaced emphasis upon sacrifice is not to be taken as a\n  rejection of the sacrificial system as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I assume that the concern is carrying the kite to the place where it will be flown and not whether \"flying\" is the same as \"carrying\" (though I may be wrong). It also begs the question if whether the kite strays by dint of its string's length over an area outside the eiruv if that is a problem but I am wondering something different:</p>\n\n<p>Can I walk outside (where there is no eiruv) on Shabbat holding a string attached to a <a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2011/01/25/helium-balloon-muktzeh/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">helium</a> balloon?</p>\n\n<p>While I am securing it, I am not keeping it UP and defying gravity (carrying) but holding it down. Is that hotza'ah? If I were to be holding 10 or 15 balloons, then controlling them and keeping them from escaping would take effort, but does that become a melacha?</p>\n\n<p>If the string unties, the balloon flies away (no fixing) but then I am carrying the string, so is the balloon actually keeping me from doing the melacha? If so, can I attach other things to the balloon and \"not carry\" them because the balloon is doing the work?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As per the comment of @doubleAA, the translation of <em>hotzaa</em> as \"carrying\" is misleading, and \"translating\" or \"transferring\" would perhaps be more precise translations.  The <em>melocho</em> essentially concerns translating a non-moving object from a static position to a halachically distinct static position.  If the balloon and/or objects attached to the balloon are in an initial state of rest in one of two halachically distinct domains (public and private) and you directly transfer them to a static position in the other of the two domains, that is the biblical prohibition of hotzaa.  The actual weight, effort, and work are not particularly relevant to the biblical concept of the <em>melocho</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

The possible reason for this postulation is that, unlike the basic halachic requirement the reason to divide between the heart and the genitals, the gartel is worn to divide between the upper more spiritual portion of the body and the lower part which is seen as connected to mundane (sexual) desires. This is the same reason the kushti is worn. I would like to know if there is any other information supporting or opposing this possible connection in Jewish academic or religious (responsa) literature. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>No, the Chassidic practice of wearing the gartel, which is properly called <em>Avnet</em> (אבנט) in Hebrew, was not influenced by the Zoroastrian practice.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth pointing out that after listening to the entire linked lecture, the premise of this question, that Dr. Shaya Secunda postulated a connection between the Chassidic practice and the Zoroastrian <em>kushti belt</em>, is not accurate. In the lecture, Dr. Secunda was recounting a discussion between a Babylonian Amorah of the 6th century CE named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amemar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amemar</a> and a Zoroastrian leader of Persia.</p>\n\n<p>This discussion can be likened to the religious contests that have been demanded of Jewish leaders over the millennia, like for example the disputations of Ramban in Spain.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Amemar, a story was recounted of a meeting between a Naggid of the Jewish community in Persia named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huna_b._Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Huna bar Natan</a> and a Persian King named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazdegerd_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yazdegerd II</a>. Huna bar Natan was primarily a political leader and not as knowledgable of proper Jewish behavior. When King Yazdegerd met with Huna bar Natan, he adjusted the placement of the Avnet worn by Huna bar Natan explaining to him that Jews are a nation of Priests and therefore he should wear his Avnet where Priests wear it and not too low (<em>meaning at or below the waist</em>) or too high (<em>meaning at the armpits or higher</em>). The King went on to explain to Huna bar Natan that this belt separates between the holy, upper portion of the body and profane, lower half, like is taught by the Zoroastrians in regard to the Kushti belt.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Secunda explained that this is based upon the idea from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.8.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 19:6</a> which recounts what G-d told Moshe to tell to the Jewish people:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאַתֶּ֧ם תִּהְיוּ־לִ֛י מַמְלֶ֥כֶת כֹּהֲנִ֖ים וְג֣וֹי קָד֑וֹשׁ אֵ֚לֶּה הַדְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר תְּדַבֵּ֖ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dr. Secunda went on to explain that Kohanim had as part of the Priestly garments a belt called Avnet and that most Jews today do not have a special belt but rely upon the belt in their pants.</p>\n\n<p>To this, a person in the audience commented that the Rabbi in her synagogue wore a special belt during prayers. And Dr. Secunda commented that today, among Jews, this practice is mostly limited to Chassidic practice. This last comment is not accurate. The Avnet is worn by Mekubbalim, Chassidim and many in the Sephardic and Mizrachi communities.</p>\n\n<p>He explained that the Zoroastrian speaking to the Amorah, Amemar tried to equate the function of the Kushti belt of the Zoroastrians to the function of the Avnet used by the Kohanim in the Temple service, meaning to separate the holy from the profane. That Zoroastrians believe in a kind of dualism with one deity ruling over the holy and one ruling over the profane. The Kushti belt marks the territorial boundary between the two. And in this way, showing how the beliefs are similar, the Zoroastrian would proselytize to the Jew. Dr. Secunda commented that as far as he was aware the belief that the belt separates the holy from the profane appears to be similar in both Jewish teaching and Zoroastrian teaching like is recounted in the story. This last comment is a common misconception found among many Ashkenazic communities.</p>\n\n<p>The Chassidic practice today is based upon the teaching found in the Torah  concerning the Priestly garments that are required as part of the avodah of a Kohen in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.28.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 28:4</a> and in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.8.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">VaYikra 8:13</a>. It has nothing to do with influences of Zoroastrianism.</p>\n\n<p>From the most obvious perspective, this explicit detail from the written Torah concerning the Avnet was commanded by G-d to Moshe shortly following the exodus from Egypt. The exodus occurred in the year 2448 of the Jewish calendar. Moshe Rabbeinu was 80 years old at that time and this was at the close of the 14th century BCE in 1312 BCE.</p>\n\n<p>The prophet Zoroaster (Zarathrustra) who was the originator of Zoroastrian worship lived according to most historians in the 6th or 7th century BCE. The earliest reliable dates mentioned on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> say he may have lived as early as the 10th century BCE or around 1000 BCE.</p>\n\n<p>Chronologically, the commandment from the Torah and the teachings associated with it preceded Zoroastrianism by more than 3 centuries.</p>\n\n<p>But more important than the chronological precedence, is that the Jewish teaching concerning the Avnet is precisely the opposite of the viewpoint attributed to Zoroastrianism.</p>\n\n<p>The Avnet is distinct among the garments of the Kohen in that it marks not a point of separation and division, but rather demonstrates the unity of everything as is found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30546&st=&pgnum=36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ערכים חבד No. 1 5731, page 58</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ענינו הרוחני של אבנט הוא דוגמת פעולתו בגשמיות:</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>> אבנט אינו עשוי לכסות ולהגן על גוף האדם (כמו לבוש), אלא לחבר ולהדק את\n  הלבושים שיהיו מהודקים היטב לגוף האדם.</strong> וכן ברוחניות: <strong>האבנט אינו כשאר\n  הבגדי כהונה</strong>, שהם בחינת מקיפים פרטים להכחות פנימיים (מצנפת מקיף לראש,\n  חב״ד. כתונת — לגוף, חג״ת. ומכנסים — לרגלים, נה״י), <strong>וענינו אינו אלא\n  לקשר המקיף בהפנימי</strong>, כי אין המקיפים מעמידים את הפנימיים, רק כשהם בקירוב\n  אליהם.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>הכח שיש באבנט לקשר</strong> את המקיפים פרטים בהפניניים <strong>הוא לפי ששרשו למעלה</strong> <strong>מהם,</strong>\n  <strong>שכל הלבושים שרשם מבחי׳ מקיף דחי׳ ואבנט ממקיף דיחידה</strong>, ולכן ביכולתו\n  לקשרם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It goes on to explain that, according to the teachings of Chassidut, the correct place to tie the Avnet (the gartel) is at the beginning of the breast (meaning the base of the sternum, opposite the heart) and not like those of us who tie it around the stomach. This last detail is because the heart is associated with the King, meaning G-d's Kingship like is found in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Melachim 2:1 and 2:5</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This concept of a unique element from the external, surrounding structures which reveals the unity of everything is again repeated in the construction of the Mishkan described in the Torah in regard to the <em>HaBriach HaTichon</em> (הבריח התיכן) in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=440\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 26:28</a>. This is the bar which ran through the center of every plank which made up the walls of the Mishkan.</p>\n\n<p>For a much more detailed and full explanation of this concept with extensive source citations, see the Chassidic discourse of the 2nd Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Dovber, who is also known as the Mittler Rebbe, in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15923&st=&pgnum=74\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'amarei Admor Ha'Emtzoei, volume 14 (Devarim-4) pp. 1236-1244</a> beginning with the words \"והנה להבין כל הנ״ל\". In particular pp,1239-1244.</p>\n\n<p>And this is part of the essential service of every Jew in being a <em>nation of Kohanim</em>, namely to reveal that G-d is one in the Heavens above and on the earth below. There is no <em>other</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'd suggest that the view of Zoroastrians that there are forces of \"good\" and \"evil\" is perfectly unobjectionable to Torah Jews. We have, for instance, what we call tumah and taharah (רוח טומאה ורוח טהרה). Our understanding, though (as Ameimar made clear in that gemara), is that Hashem rules both; they are all part of his oneness, not two deities fighting ח\"ו.<br />\nSo, I'm not hearing why some Jews doing something to use that idea were \"influenced by Zoroastrianism\". Any more than Jews using electricity are \"influenced by atheistic scientists\". They understand some things, and miss a lot.</p>\n<p>Since the topic of dualism came up, and it's almost Purim: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UnYRKAZ29NNiA-kZHO177QUL7MrSGjQ2/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim and the Role of Hashem</a></p>\n\n\n",

Thus, the use of an \"expert\" to represent the congregation in prayers. I gather that the primary usage of the chazzan was for the <em>amidah</em> as we still have the repetition of the amidah, now, even though we also have an individual, silent one.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that other parts of the prayer service such as <em>Psukei Dezimra</em> / the blessing before and after <em>shema</em>, etc. were all done by the chazzan, originally, and aloud, assuming that few spoke Hebrew (I'm uncertain about the verses of <em>Shema</em>, itself, as I don't think the shat\"z can fulfill another's obligation to recite <em>Shema</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, that much of the prayers are recited silently, Since when has the chazzan been used as a means of reciting the end of each Psalm, paragraph?

This isn't a universal method, though. Many shuls havethe shat\"z recite the end of each paragraph</li>\n<li>I assume that the reason fro having the shat\"z recite the <em>Shema</em> blessings aloud is so that the congregation can answer <em>Amen</em>. Is that the only reason?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please correct me and / or edit any incorrect assumptions that I've made.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>A Chazzan's job is to recite the Shema Blessings and Amida sections aloud for the congregation to fulfill their obligation with. (For the Amida, those who know how to pray themselves must also do so individually seemingly since prayer is inherently personal.) Congregations who choose to utilize a \"Chazzan\" during Pesukei Dizimra are essentially just using a glorified human <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kQKYBqRY2MU/hqdefault.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">page number sign</a> perhaps to give people a sense of community or recommended pace. The real Chazzan starts before Shema, which is why there are traditional grandiose entrances for him on special occasions (Shokhen Ad, HaMelekh, etc.) as well as opening with the formal call to prayer \"Barekhu\".</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/55756/759\">noted elsewhere</a> if one fears spacing out during the blessings surrounding Shema (or <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/36588/759\">during a Zimmun</a>) and not hearing every word, he should recite along with the leader in an undertone, but finish up a few seconds early so as to still say Amen.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question: <code>Why can't, say, everyone recite silently Psukei Dezimra or the Shema blessings silently and the chazzan should do aloud only Amidah and Kaddish?</code></p>\n\n<p>For Pesukei Dizimra you certainly can do that if you want, and some synagogues indeed do. For the Shema blessings you can't do that since the Chazzan needs to say them aloud for the congregation just like he does the Amida. Even if it happens that everyone in a particular synagogue fears spacing out and recites along themselves, we don't change the order of the prayers (just like we don't <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16965/759\">abolish the repetition of the Amida if everyone in the room knows how to say it themselves) since that is the traditional law, communal prayer has a special status, we'd need to say the Barekhu/Kedusha parts of it anyway, and people might show up one day who can't or merely don't want to say it themselves</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

By weddings however it's the opposite with men on the right & women on the left. What is the reason for this? I have noticed this at other funerals as well so it wasn't a fluke. I would appreciate a source for this custom.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I never paid attention to this until you mentioned this now.</p>\n\n<p>I think the reason for that funeral arrangement makes sense, having been to a few too many funerals, lately.</p>\n\n<p>Many funeral chapels have two sets of doors. The rows of benches face the front of the room. One enters the chapel from the \"lobby\", which would be to the right when facing the front of the room. The doors on the opposite side of the room usually lead to the parking lot where the hearse is waiting. These are the doors on the left side of the room when you would be facing the front of the room.</p>\n\n<p>As it is usually the men who escort the hearse, and they would be the ones leaving the chapel first, it makes sense to have them seated closest to these doors on the left side of the room.</p>\n\n<p>I'm unaware of any halacha that dictates any seating arrangement, so what I stated is based on what I have seen in chapels. On rare occasions, have I attended a funeral held in a shul. (Personally, I don't like the idea of doing this.) But, then, again, most Orthodox shuls have the women upstairs or in the back, anyway.</p>\n\n\n",

Shach (Y.D. 115:17)\n  cites the opinion of Issur V’Heter that indeed gevinas akum is batel\n  b’rov, which would presumably be based on comparing gevinas\n  akum to any other issur shehu’amad, but Shach rejects this position.\n  Chochmos Adam 67:5 writes regarding gevinas akum, that even\n  b’hefsed mirubah, one should not rely on Issur V’Heter and gevinas\n  akum should be treated like every other issur. However, regarding\n  chalav akum, which is more kal than gevinas akum, Chochmas Adam\n  writes that if it is a hefsed mirubah one may rely on Issur V’heter that\n  chalav akum is batel b’rov. Based on this Chochmos Adam, we can perhaps answer a perplexing question. What is the reason why some people who are makpid to only drink chalav Yisroel are not makpid when it comes to using keilim of chalav stam. We pasken ta’am k’ikar, so what rationale can there be to be machmir on the ikar and yet maikel on the ta’am? But according to Chochmos Adam, we see that b’makom hefsed mirubah, chalav akum is batel b’rov. This means that regarding chalav akum, perhaps Chazal did not pasken ta’am k’ikar. Since these people b’ikar pasken like Igeros Moshe that chalav HaCompanies is permitted, and\n  have only accepted chalav Yisroel as a chumra, regarding the keilim, where there is more room to be maikel, they have not accepted this chumra. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What was the attitude of Chazal towards abstinence (asceticism, stoicism)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Do Chazal have a positive or a negative attitude towards the person who abstains from worldly pleasures (pleasures that weren't prohibited by the Torah)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The gemara in Taanis 11a brings a Machloket between two sages on how we should view the Nazir who abstains from wine,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' אלעזר הקפר ברבי אומר מה תלמוד לומר {במדבר ו-יא} וכפר עליו מאשר חטא\n  על הנפש וכי באיזה נפש חטא זה אלא שציער עצמו מן היין והלא דברים קל\n  וחומר ומה זה שלא ציער עצמו אלא מן היין נקרא חוטא המצער עצמו מכל דבר\n  ודבר על אחת כמה. רבי אלעזר אומר נקרא קדוש שנאמר קדוש יהיה גדל פרע שער\n  ראשו ומה זה שלא ציער עצמו אלא מדבר אחד נקרא קדוש המצער עצמו מכל דבר על\n  אחת כמה וכמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R Eliezer Hakafer calls the Nazir a sinner because he abstains from wine (wine was a necessity in ancient times). R Elazar (without a surname) disagrees with him, and regards the Nazir as a holy man. However, the consensus of the Rabbis seems to concur with the former view that the Nair is a sinner (see Taanis 11b. see also Rambam Shemona Perakim chapter 4 where he completely disregards the opinion of R Elazar. In hilchot dayot 3:1 he paskens like R Elazar Hakafer as well. However, see Tur & SA OC siman 571. They seem to pasken like R Elazar). \nWe find the view of R Elazar Hakafer in other places in the Talmud as well, in the the Yerushalmi (Nedarim 29a) we find a similar saying, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רב דימי בשם רבי יצחק לא דייך מה שאסרה לך התורה אלא שאתה מבקש לאסור\n  עליך דברים אחרים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Dimi condemns the person that pledges not to eat certain foods, and argues that a person should not add prohibitions, since the Torah already prohibited enough things for us. The Bavli in Nedarim (22a) seems to endorse this view as well, it compares one who makes a Neder to one who builds a Bamah (a forbidden altar) and sacrifices on it (see Ran for clarification). From all this we can see that Chazal did not have a positive attitude towards the ascetic. </p>\n\n<p>The reason Chazal discourage us from abstaining from permitted necessary pleasures is stated in the gemara Taanis 11b,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי ירמיה בר אבא אמר ריש לקיש אין תלמיד חכם רשאי לישב בתענית מפני\n  שממעט במלאכת שמים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unnecessary abstinence drains the person and makes him unfit to worship Hashem properly. The Rambam in Shemona Perakim (chapter 4) adds another reason: a person that abstains from worldly pleasures thinks that god hates the mortal body and wants to destroy it, he thinks that by abstaining from worldly pleasures he becomes closer to god, this is unhealthy destructive thinking, Chazal are teaching us here that the Torah doesn’t stand for such behavior. He also adds that abstaining too much makes a person sick and incapable of doing what he needs to do. He explains that the wise pious men only abstained as a means to refinement of their characters, but the fools took it in the wrong way and thought that this is what god wants from them,    </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכאשר ראו הכסילים שהחסידים עשו אלו הפעולות ולא ידעו כונתן, חשבו שהן\n  טובות וכונו אליהן, בחשבם שיהיו כמותם ויענו את גופתם בכל מיני ענוי,\n  ויחשבו שהם הקנו לעצמם מעלה ומדה טובה ושעשו טובה ושבזה יתקרב האדם לשם\n  כאילו השם יתברך שונא הגוף ורוצה לאבדו, והם לא ידעו שאלו הפעולות רעות\n  ושבהן תגיע פחיתות מפחיתות הנפש... וזאת התורה התמימה המשלמת אותנו, כמו\n  שהעיד עליה יודעה (תהלים, י\"ט ח'), \"תורת ה' תמימה משיבת נפש עדות ה'\n  נאמנה מחכימת פתי\", לא זכרה דבר מזה. ואמנם כונתה להיות האדם טבעי הולך\n  בדרך האמצעית: יאכל מה שיש לו לאכול בשווי, וישתה מה שיש לו לשתות בשווי,\n  ויבעול מה שמותר לו לבעול בשווי, וישכון במדינות ביושר ובאמונה. ולא\n  שישכון במדברות ובהרים, ולא שילבש הצמר והשער, ולא שיענה גופו, והזהירה\n  מזה לפי מה שבא בקבלה ואמר (במדבר ו' י\"א), \"וכפר עליו מאשר חטא על\n  הנפש\", ואמרו רבנן זכרונם לברכה (תענית י\"א. נדרים י'. נזיר י\"ט - כ\"ב.\n  סוטה ט\"ו. בבא קמא צ\"א. שבועות ח'), \"וכי על איזה נפש חטא זה, אלא שמנע\n  עצמו מן היין, והלא דברים קל וחומר, מה זה שציער עצמו מן היין צריך כפרה\n  - המצער עצמו מכל דבר ודבר על אחת כמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another reason is mentioned in the Lechem Mishna (dayot 3:1) and the Yefay Mareh (Yerushalmi Kidushin 4:12) that the Nazir hurts his soul by abstaining from things that are permitted to him, and is oiver on the issur of Chovel, and as the gemara already states somewhere else (Bava Kama 91b) a person is not allowed to bruise oneself. See also Tosfos Taanis 11a. </p>\n\n<p>So far it was only proven that Chazal discouraged us from abstaining from necessary pleasures. But in another place (Yerushalmi Kidushin 4:12) it is implied that that not only should we not abstain but that there is a positive command to engage in worldly pleasures, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' חזקיה ר' כהן בשם רב עתיד אדם ליתן דין וחשבון על כל שראתה עינו ולא\n  אכל. ר' לעזר חשש להדא שמועתא ומצמית ליה פריטין ואכיל בהון מכל מילה חדא\n  בשתא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(R Yeruchem Fishel Perlow in his commentary on the Resa’g (mitzvah 95) explains that according to R Saadia it is a mitzvah to eat meat when the person yearns for it; that is the verse in Dvarim (12:20) כִּי יַרְחִיב יְדֹוָד אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת גְּבֻלְךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ דִּבֶּר לָךְ וְאָמַרְתָּ אֹכְלָה בָשָׂר כִּי תְאַוֶּה נַפְשְׁךָ לֶאֱכֹל בָּשָׂר בְּכָל אַוַּת נַפְשְׁךָ תֹּאכַל בָּשָׂר: is a positive command. He brings the above mentioned gemara to support the idea). </p>\n\n<p>If we take this saying of the Yerushalmi literally, then we must say that the Nazir is not a sinner only because he makes himself sick, he is a sinner because he rejects a gift that god gave to him. God created a world filled with pleasures because he wanted us to enjoy his world, which is why we must make a point to engage in worldly pleasures and not to abstain from them, a Nazir is doing the opposite of what god intended the world to be, this is why he is considered a sinner. </p>\n\n<p>However, we should not confuse abstinence with Perishus. Chazal encouraged Perishus which is abstaining from excessive pleasure and indulgence (see Ramban vayikra 19:2), what they condemn is abstinence from necessary pleasures only.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Kodoshim Tihu:</p>\n<p>• Mkadesh yourself by abstaining also from that which is permitted to you\" (Yevamot 20a)\nRamban counts it as a mitzvah.</p>\n<p>• Nedarim 10a - 2 Shittas, one says a Nasir is a Choteh (sinner).

Why, cause he abstained from wine?</p>\n<p>• Mishna In Avos Perek 6: This is the way of Torah: Eat bread with salt, drink water in small measure, sleep on the ground, and live a life of hardship.\"</p>\n<p>While - Rav Nachman In Baba Kama 72  that a point of Halacha can be properly understood after enjoying a juicy steak</p>\n<p>And also in yerushalmi kiddushin:\nRabbi Chizkiah's says \"A person will have to answer for everything that his eye beheld and he did not consume.</p>\n<p>So there's really two ways of looking at it.

In <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%99%D7%90_%D7%9C%D7%92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">11:33 many of the Jews were killed for complaining about the Man and their lack of meat.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הבשר עודנו בין שניהם טרם יכרת ואף יהוה חרה בעם ויך יהוה בעם מכה רבה מאד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, its not really clear what the punishment that happened before Vayehi Bineso'ah Ha'aron is. Many of the Meforshim such as <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%96_%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfos in Shabbos there</a> explains the Gemara there to be saying that it's the sin of running away from Har Sinai like a child running away from school.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פורענות ראשונה ויסעו וא\"ר חנינא שסרו מאחרי השם. פי'. בקונטרס שמאז התחילו לשאול בשר ואומר ר\"י דאין נ\"ל כן אלא פורענות ראשונה כדאמר במדרש (ילמדנו) ויסעו שנסעו מהר סיני דרך שלשת ימים כתינוק היוצא מבית הספר שבורח לו והולך לו כך היו בורחים מהר סיני דרך שלשת ימים לפי שלמדו הרבה תורה בסיני אמר הקב\"ה נסמוך פורענות לפורענות לאו. אלא נפסוק פרשת ויהי בנסוע הארון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But that isn't a punishment.

Meaning, <strong>away from Hashem</strong>, like a child running away from school. Thus did the Jews, they said: \"Maybe [Hashem] wants to add more Torah and more mitzvos\". What did they do? They travelled back eight journeys, and Hashem <strong>paid them back and many of them died</strong>. This was the punishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Chasam Sofer</strong> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21254&st=&pgnum=209\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derashos II p. 311b s.v. כתיב</a>, Sefer HaZicharon p. 52) gives another approach. He writes that unlike other sins, where the punishment awaits for a later time, a person who neglects Torah study is in fact directly hurting himself. Therefore, the sin itself is the punishment (see there where he goes into detail about what this means). He invokes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 3:5</a> that says whoever removes the yoke of Torah from himself is given the yoke of <em>malchus</em>. He interprets this to mean immediately, and it refers to foreign invaders. He uses this to explain why specifically these two verses were used to create the interruption. He writes that Moshe sensed that the Jews were in danger due to their lack of desire to learn Torah, so he immediately prayed “let your enemies scatter, etc.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Schwab\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Shimon Schwab</strong></a> in Maayan Beis HaShoaiva also offers a different approach. He asks why did the <em>Midrash</em> compare the Jews to children running from school? Because children don't appreciate the significance of what they learn. That's why they run, they view it negatively, and only in adulthood do they appreciate what they were taught. So too the Jews, they didn't appreciate the Torah being taught to them. This is the punishment that the gemarra is referring to. Not to feel full satisfaction and enjoyment from spirituality, there’s no worse punishment than that. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Criteria for obligation to obligate oneself in mitzvot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Certain commandments are automatically obligatory, e.g., praying, reciting shema, eating <em>matza</em> on the first night of Passover, etc.  Other commandments, however, seem to be obligatory only if one chooses to do a voluntary act.  For example, there is an obligation perform <em>shechita</em> (ritual slaughter) to allow the consumption of meat.  This is not generally assumed to mean that one is required to eat meat in order to fulfill the mitzva of <em>shechita</em>.  In contrast, the gemara in <em>Menachoth</em> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.41a.31?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">41a</a>) says that in a time of divine anger, people are judged for not wearing <em>tzitzith</em> even though they did not wear garments that are eligible for the mitzva:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מלאכא אשכחי' לרב קטינא דמיכסי סדינא אמר ליה קטינא קטינא סדינא בקייטא וסרבלא בסיתוא ציצית של תכלת מה תהא עליה אמר ליה ענשיתו אעשה אמר ליה בזמן דאיכא ריתחא ענשינן אי אמרת בשלמא חובת גברא הוא היינו דמחייב דלא קא רמי אלא אי אמרת חובת טלית הוא הא לא מיחייבא אלא מאי חובת גברא הוא נהי דחייביה רחמנא כי מיכסי טלית דבת חיובא כי מיכסי טלית דלאו בת חיובא היא מי חייביה רחמנא אלא הכי קאמר ליה טצדקי למיפטר נפשך מציצית </p>\n  \n  <p>For an angel once found R. Kattina wearing a linen wrap, and he exclaimed, ‘Kattina, Kattina, a wrap in summer and a cloak in winter, and what is to happen to the law of zizith?’ ‘And do you punish’, asked R. Kattina, ‘a person [who omits to perform] a positive precept?’ ‘In a time of wrath’, replied the angel, ‘we do’. Now if you hold that the law of zizith is an obligation incumbent upon the person then that is why one would incur guilt for not wearing a garment with fringes; but if you hold that it is an obligation attaching to the garment, then why [is any guilt incurred] seeing that these garments are exempt? What then do you hold? That it is an obligation incumbent upon the person? I grant you that the All — Merciful would punish one who wears [without fringes] a garment that is subject to fringes, but would the All-Merciful punish one who wears [without fringes] a garment that is not subject to it? — This is what [the angel] implied, ‘You find every excuse to free yourself from the law of zizith’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also the Rambam Hilchoth Tzitzith 3:11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאֵין אָדָם מְחֻיָּב לִקְנוֹת לוֹ טַלִּית וּלְהִתְעַטֵּף בָּהּ כְּדֵי שֶׁיַּעֲשֶׂה בָּהּ צִיצִית אֵין רָאוּי לְאָדָם חָסִיד שֶׁיִּפְטֹר עַצְמוֹ מִמִּצְוָה זוֹ. אֶלָּא לְעוֹלָם יִשְׁתַּדֵּל לִהְיוֹת עָטוּף בִּכְסוּת הַמְחֻיֶּבֶת בַּצִּיצִית כְּדֵי שֶׁיְּקַיֵּם מִצְוָה זוֹ. וּבִשְׁעַת הַתְּפִלָּה צָרִיךְ לְהִזָּהֵר בְּיוֹתֵר. גְּנַאי גָּדוֹל הוּא לְתַלְמִידֵי חֲכָמִים שֶׁיִּתְפַּלְּלוּ וְהֵם אֵינָם עֲטוּפִים </p>\n  \n  <p>Even though a person is not obligated to buy himself a <em>talith</em> and to wrap himself in it in order to make for it <em>tzitzith</em>, it is unfitting for a pious person to exempt himself from this commandment.  Rather, he should always put in the effort to be wrapped in a garment obligated in <em>tzitzith</em> in order to fulfill this <em>mitzva</em>.  And at time of prayer he should be exceptionally careful (to wear such a garment).  It is a great disgrace for scholars to pray without being wrapped (in such a garment).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Along similar lines, I believe Rav Moshe Feinstein, z\"l, wrote a responsum encouraging his grandson to wear wool <em>tzitzith</em> even in the summer in order to fulfill the biblical obligation even according to those (e.g. the Rambam) who hold cotton garments are biblically exempt from the obligation (as opposed to, e.g., the Rama who holds that even cotton garments are biblically obligated in tzitzith.</p>\n\n<p>What are the criteria by which a <em>mitzva</em> which is not automatically obligatory, still suggests at least an ideal to self-obligate in order to fulfill the commandment? For example, is one obligated to desire an egg in order to fulfill <em>shiluach haken</em>?  Is the idea expressed in <em>Menachoth</em> limited to <em>tzitzith</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In a long <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%91%D7%9C_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95_%D7%99%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">teshuvah</a> in his Chevel Nachalato, R. Yaakov Epstein cites many sources on this subject--it would seem from his citations that many Rishonim view the case in Menachot as anomalous for one reason or another: </p>\n\n<p>1) Rif, commentary attributed to Rashba on Menachot--the Gemara is referring to a case in which R. Kattina was wearing a garment obligated in tzitzit; according to this view, there is no source that one must go out of his way to obligate himself, because in this case, R. Kattina was already obligated. </p>\n\n<p>2) Maharsha--R. Kattina was punished because of his stature; according to this view, this Gemara can only be generalized to people like R. Kattina. </p>\n\n<p>3) Tosfot, Mordekhai, Rosh--this Gemara applies only in times when everyone usually wore four-cornered garments; according to this view, this can be generalized only when avoiding a mitzvah that one usually would have to perform. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, R. Yosef Gikatilla in his Klalei HaMitzvot writes as follows: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש מצות עשה שאדם חייב לרדוף אחריהם לקיימן כדי שלא יהא בכלל פושעי ישראל\n  בגופן, כגון תפלין וסוכה ולולב וכיוצא בהן, ואלו הן הנקראות חובה. ויש\n  מצות עשה שהם מצד אחד חובה ומצד שני דומות כמו רשות כגון מזוזה ומעקה\n  וכיוצא בהן, שאין אדם חייב לשכון בבית בהכרח כדי שיעשה מזוזה או לבנות\n  בית בהכרח כדי לעשות מעקה, ומ\"מ מצד קיום המצוה חייב אדם להשתדל לעשותה,\n  כדגרסינן בפרק התכלת (מנחות מג ב) ר' אליעזר בן יעקב אומר כל שיש לו\n  תפלין בראשו ובזרועו וציצית בבגדו ומזוזה בפתחו מוחזקני בו שלא יחטא\n  שנאמר והחוט המשולש לא במהרה ינתק, ואומר חונה מלאך ה' סביב ליראיו\n  ויחלצם\n  ומדרך זה חייב אדם לרדוף אחר המצות כולן ולקיים כל מה שאפשר לו מהן לקיימן, ולהיותו משתוקק וכוסף ומתאוה גם אחר המצות שאינו יכול לקיימן, ועל זה עתיד לקבל שכר, דגרסינן בסוטה סוף פ\"ק (סוטה יד א) דרש ר' שמלאי מפני מה נתאוה משה ליכנס לארץ ישראל כדי לאכול פירות ולשבוע מטובה הוא צריך, אלא אמר משה הרבה מצות נצטוו ישראל ואינן מתקיימות אלא בארץ ישראל, אמר אכנס לארץ כדי שיתקיימו על ידי, א\"ל הקב\"ה כלום אתה צריך אלא לקבל שכר הריני מעלה לך כאילו עשיתם שנאמר לכן אחלק לו ברבים, שאני מחלק לו שכר שלם וכו'. ולפיכך ראוי לו לאדם לחזור אחר כל מצוה שהיא תלויה בדבר אחר כדי שתתקיים על ידו ויהיה זוכה לשכר כולן, וכבר ביארנו זה במלת \"בטל\" ויתבאר במלת \"רשות\". </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this view, one is obligated to try to fulfill mitzvot such as mezuzah and maakeh. Similarly, R. Eliezer Azikri in his Sefer Charedim (hakdamah lemitzvot, 2) writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצות עשה שלא יתחייב אדם בהן כי אם בסיבה, כגון מזוזה... וכן מצות מעקה ... וכן ציצית ... ובתרומה ומעשר ...וכן מצות נתינת שכר שכיר ביומו, שאם לא ישכור אדם שכיר אין\n  כאן מצות נתינה, ופעמים שלא תבא הסיבה לאדם כל ימיו ונמצא שלא עשה אותה\n  מצוה לעולם. ועל כל כיוצא במצות אלו, אין בית דין של מטה מענישין את האדם\n  על מה שאינו משתדל להביא עצמו לידי חיוב כדי לקיים אותן, אבל בית דין של\n  מעלה מענישין עליהם כשיש חרון אף בעולם, כדאיתא במסכת מנחות (מא א) שנגלה\n  מלאך לרב קטינא ואמר לו אתה בלא ציצית בעבור שבגדיך פטורים, אם כן מצות\n  ציצית מה תהא עליה...ולשון הרב רבינו יונה גם על מצות כאלה אמרו ז\"ל ענוש יענש לעתות\n  בצרה על דבר אשר לא חמד בלבבו יופי המצוה ושכרה לבעבור סבב פני דבר חיובה\n  עליו (ש\"ג אות כב). ובפרק ערבי פסחים (דף קי\"ג ב) אמרו דמי שאין לו ציצית\n  בבגדו הוי מנודה לשמים, וכתבו על זה התוספות, ומיירי דיש לו ואינו מניחו.\n  אי נמי אפילו אין לו, יש לו לחזור ולהביא עצמו לידי חיוב, כדאשכחן במשה\n  שהיה תאב ליכנס לארץ ישראל כדי לקיים המצות התלויות בה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sefer Charedim too requires one to go out of his way to attempt to fulfill mitzvot in which he would not otherwise have been obligated, including hiring workers to pay them on time. </p>\n\n<p>[It is only according to the view of Sefer Charedim, that one is obligated to look for opportunities to become obligated in new mitzvot, that one might entertain the possibility that one who has never sinned may perform an aveirah so as to fulfill the mitzvah of teshuvah. (See, e.g., <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33602&st=&pgnum=91&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, no. 188.) Obviously, however, this is not a necessary conclusion of Sefer Charedim's view. Interestingly, in Klalei HaMitzvot, erekh \"Reshut,\" R. Yosef Gikatilla explicitly repudiates this approach: הנה יש מצות עשה הרבה כי מי יתן שלא יצטרך אדם לעשותם לעולם ולא הן ולא שכרן, כגון מקצת מצות הבאות בקרבנות על כפרת עבירות שאדם עושה כגון חטאות ואשמות וכיוצא בהן, כדגרסינן בפרק מי שמתו (ברכות כג א) שמור רגלך כאשר תלך אל בית האלקים, שמור רגלך שלא תחטא משתחטא ותביא קרבן לפני. ושמור עיקר זה במצות כי גדול הוא מאד. See also ch. 4 of <a href=\"http://www.kotar.co.il/KotarApp/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=98958684\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this book</a>.] </p>\n\n<p>The Darkei Teshuvah (beginning of hilkhot shechitah and hashmatot there) asks this question with regard to shechitah--should one attempt to perform shechitah in order to avoid punishment at a time of God's wrath? He cites Ibn Ezra's Yesod Mora which in turn relates that a certain pious individual looked to perform shechitah in order to fulfill the requirement of reciting 100 berakhot. The Darkei Teshuvah infers from this that one is not required to seek out to perform the mitzvah of shechitah, as the protagonist in Ibn Ezra's story was only concerned about the obligation of 100 berakhot. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this question only arises if we assume: 1) one is supposed to perform mitzvot even if he is not obligated to perform them; 2) shechitah is considered a mitzvah (against the view of Raavad, Ramban, Tosfot, Rosh, Tashbetz, Taz, Gra, etc.). Nevertheless, even if we make both of these assumptions, there may be a significant distinction between tzitzit and shechitah: Regarding shechitah there is never a situation in which one is obligated to perform the mitzvah. In the case of tzitzit, however, one who is wearing a four-cornered garment is obligated to place tzitzit on its corners. (See R. Barukh Shmuel Deutsch in his Birkat Kohen, Chullin.)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the mitzvah of shiluach ha-ken, the Pitchei Teshuvah (Yoreh Deah 292:1) cites Mishnat Chachamim (Tzofnat Paneach 5) who claims that one is only obligated to perform the mitzvah if one has already taken the birds (in which case one has already violated a negative commandment). Even so, if one encounters a nest and does not send away the mother bird, he is punished at a time of divine wrath. The aforementioned Darkei Teshuvah himself maintains that failure to perform shechitah does not warrant punishment because it entails destruction of a creature; I am not sure whether this logic would apply as well to shiluach ha-ken. </p>\n\n<p>A similar question arises with regard to doing something to avoid fulfilling a mitzvah. R. Hershel Schachter in his Be'Ikvei HaTzon cites Bekhorot 3b as proof that one is not allowed to exempt himself from a mitzvah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רב מרי בר רחל הו\"ל ההיא חיותא, הוה מקנה לאודנייהו לעובד כוכבים ואסר\n  להו בגיזה ועבודה ויהיב להו לכהנים, וכלאי חיותא דרב מרי בר רחל, וכו'\n  משום דמפקע להו מקדושתייהו </p>\n  \n  <p>R. Mari b. Rahel possessed a herd of animals. He used to transfer [to a heathen] possession of the ears [of the firstlings while still in the womb]... The herd of R. Mari b. Rahel died... Because he deprived them of their holiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, others note that this case may be different because: </p>\n\n<p>1) One is subverting the sanctity of the animal, not only exempting oneself from a mitzvah; perhaps only subversion of sanctity is problematic. </p>\n\n<p>2) According to one opinion in the Gemara, R. Mari was only punished because others who were ignorant of the relevant laws would learn from his example, but otherwise one would be allowed to exempt himself from a mitzvah (see R. Tzvi Pesach Frank, Har Tzvi al HaTorah, Ki Tisa; compare Maharsha cited above). \nIt would seem reasonable that this question is also related to the Gemara in Menachot 41a (and indeed R. Schachter cites this Gemara as well). </p>\n\n<p>A final passage that relates to this question is Berakhot 35b: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר רבה בר בר חנה אמר רבי יוחנן משום רבי יהודה ברבי אלעאי: בא וראה\n  שלא כדורות הראשונים דורות האחרונים; דורות הראשונים היו מכניסין\n  פירותיהן דרך טרקסמון - כדי לחייבן במעשר, דורות האחרונים מכניסין\n  פירותיהן דרך גגות דרך חצרות דרך קרפיפות - כדי לפטרן מן המעשר; דאמר רבי\n  ינאי: אין הטבל מתחייב במעשר עד שיראה פני הבית</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbah b. Bar Hanah further said in the name of R. Johanan reporting\n  R. Judah b. Ila'i: Observe the difference between the earlier and the\n  later generations. The earlier generations used to bring in their\n  produce by way of the kitchen-garden purposely in order to make it\n  liable to tithe, whereas the later generations bring in their produce\n  by way of roofs or courtyards or enclosures in order to make it exempt\n  from tithe. For R. Jannai has said: Untithed produce is not subject to\n  tithing until it has come within sight of the house, since it says.\n  I have put away the hallowed things out of my house. R. Johanan,\n  however, says that even [sight of] a courtyard imposes the obligation,\n  as it says, That they may eat within thy gates and be satisfied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Gemara seems to imply that it is a discredit to the later generations that they avoided the obligation. R. Kook in his Ein Ayah (on the Gemara in Berakhot) comments: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ההבדל שיש בין המכיר ערך המצות ותכליתן הנשגבה וחפץ בהן באמת ובין מי\n  שעבודתו היא רק מצות אנשים מלומדה הוכן להיות יוצא אל הפועל בהרבה מצות\n  מן התורה, שנמצאו בהם דרכים ע\"פ דין תורה להפקיע החיוב מעצמו. אמנם רק\n  בזה יוודע שלימות העובד מאהבה, בהיות לאל ידו לפטור עצמו ובהיותו מכיר את\n  ערך המצוה וקדושתה הוא נכנס להתחייב בה. ע\"כ במצות מעשרות, שהיא המצוה\n  הראשית המחזקת את כל אושר הכלל כולו, בהיותה לברית בין המיוחדים לעבודת\n  ד' שבט הלוי ובין כל העם כולו, דאגה החכמה האלהית ביותר שתהי' נעשיח ע\"פ\n  רוח נדיבה המכרת את ערכה הגדול. ע\"כ נתנה מקום להחלץ ממנה [ע\"י] הכנסה\n  דרך גגות חצירו' וקרפיפות, למען שתגיע הרגשת העושה לעשות המצוה מיקרת רוח\n  ונפש נדיבה, שבזה תצא אל הפועל תכליתה להשלים את הכלל כולו כחפץ האדון\n  השם יתברך.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=408&ArticleID=952\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a discussion of הערמה; and see Pesachim 48b: \nאמר רב יוסף הני נשי דידן נהוג למיפא קפיזא קפיזא [רש\"י: שלשת לוגין לחומרא לשומרו מן החימוץ] לפיסחא. א\"ל אביי מאי דעתיך לחומרא? חומרא דאתי לידי קולא הוא, דקא מפקע לה מחלה</p>\n\n\n",

Mishnah, it's a measure and they receive reward. Gemarra, there's no greater measure than that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi there explains that the main form of talmud torah is learning that brings you to a complete understanding of the laws of the torah. This is more likely accomplished through learning Gemarra as opposed to Mishnah alone or Tanach alone. (I admit this gemarra isn't a proof there is an issur of learning the lower quality material, but based on the next section I don't see a reason to distinguish between learning with less effort being called bittul and learning lower quality material).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quality of the act of learning</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Volozhin writes (found in Eitz Chaim § 36):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שתזדרז ללמוד בזריזות וחשק גדול, כי מה שלומדים בעצלות כל היום יכולים ללמוד בזריזות בשמה שעות</p>\n  \n  <p>A person should exert themselves to learn with alacrity and great passion, because what a person can learn laxly the whole day can be accomplished with exertion in a few hours</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there an issue with not learning to the best of one's ability?</p>\n\n<p>The Ran in Nedarim 8a writes that even though the gemarra says you fulfill the mitzvah of talmud torah by saying kriyas shema twice a day, you still have an obligation to learn whenever you can <strong>with all of your strength</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מסתברא לי דלאו דווקה דבהכי מיפטר שהרי <strong>חייב כל אדם ללמוד תמיד יום ולילה כפי כחו</strong> ואמרינן בפ\"ק דקידושין דף ל ע\"א ת\"ר ושננתם שיהו דברי תורה מחודדין בפיך שאם ישאלך אדם דבר שלא תגמגם ותאמר לו וכו' וק\"ש שחרית וערבית לא סגי להכי</p>\n  \n  <p>It makes sense to me that [the gemarra is] not to be taken literally when it says you exempt [your obligation to learn by saying kriyas shema], because a person is <strong>obligated to learn at all times, day and night, according to their strength</strong>, and it says in the first chapter of Kiddushin 30a: The Rabbis taught \"ושננתם\", that the words of Torah should be sharp in your mouth, such that if a person asks you something you don't stutter and respond, and kriyas shema of morning and evening don't satisfy this requirement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If a person learns not according to strength they have but rather in a lax way, they aren't fulfilling their obligation. <sub>(Rav Asher concedes that the obligation to constantly learn isn't the simple understanding of the verse and isn't a Torah obligation, rather Chazal made a drasha on the verse to teach you a worthy endeavor for a Jew to follow. He also points out that the Radvaz Volume 3 Simman 416 feels the Ran is a lone opinion that you don't fulfill your obligation with kriyas shema, but Rav Asher brings many Rishonim that sound like the Ran. He resolves the conflicting statements in his sefer).</sub></p>\n\n<p>The Achronim (Beis Efraim Orach Chaim Simman 68, Avnei Nezer Orach Chaim Volume 2 Simman 517, among others) ask on the gemarra in Megillah 3a that says we are mevatel talmud torah to read the megillah, yet reading the megillah is also talmud torah. You can ask similarly on the gemarra in Shabbos 11a that says we are mevatel talmud torah to say kriyas shema, yet kriyas shema is also talmud torah. Simply put you can say reading the megillah is talmud torah but all the effort required in going to shul and all that goes into that is what the gemarra is referring to (as @mevaqesh said in the name of the Ritvah and other Rishonim), but that doesn't resolve the issue with the gemarra in Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>The gemarra in Brachos 10a says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גדול הקורא קריאת שמע בעונתה יותר מהקורא בתורה</p>\n  \n  <p>Greater is one who recites shema at the designated time than one who reads from the Torah</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rashba asks on this that what is the chiddush? Reading the shema is also reading from the Torah, and besides that you accomplish the mitzvah of reciting the shema so this statement is obvious. He answers that קר\"ש גדול <strong>מהשונה</strong> בתורה, reciting shema is greater than one who is <strong>learning</strong> torah, not merely reading it. Rav Asher learns two things from this Rashbah:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Reciting shema has a mitzvah of talmud torah like one who <strong>reads</strong> from the torah, besides the mitzvah of shema itself</li>\n<li>Someone who <strong>learns</strong> torah is greater than one who only <strong>reads</strong> torah</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Using this Rav Asher explains the gemarra in Megillah and Shabbos. Even though there's a mitzvah of talmud torah when reciting the megillah and shema, this is just the level of reading torah. However, if someone is <strong>learning</strong> torah, getting a deep understanding of the laws of the torah, and he interrupts this to recite the megillah and shema, this is considered bittul torah, because learning torah is greater than reading it.</p>\n\n<p>In summary we see varying levels in the quality of one's talmud torah, and there seems to be an obligation to try one's best to maximize that quality, as well as a concept of bittul torah when one doesn't.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding your question about balancing one's talmud torah with other duties (such as chesed), the Rambam, Hilchos Talmud Torah 3:4 rules (based on the gemarra in Moed Katan 9b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היה לפני עשית מצוה ותלמוד תורה, אם אפשר לצמוה להעשות על ידי אחרים <strong>לא יפסיק תלמודו</strong>, ואם לאו יעשה המצוה <strong>ויחזר לתלמוד</strong>ו</p>\n  \n  <p>If there is before you a mitzvah opportunity and learning torah, if it's possible for the mitzvah to be done by another then <strong>don't interrupt</strong> your learning, otherwise do the mitzvah <strong>and return to your learning</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It sounds like from the Rambam that it would be considered bittul torah if one needlessly interrupted their learning, regardless of what the mitzvah is (besides megillah and shema, as above). However, if no one else can do the mitzvah, then one must stop their learning (and it shouldn't be considered bittul torah), and the Rambam adds something the gemarra doesn't mention, to <strong>return to your learning</strong>, which sounds like it would be a problem if one doesn't return to their learning.</p>\n\n<p>For further study on this last topic, see <a href=\"http://www.thejerusalemkollel.com/download/BerkowitzSheets/Bein_Adam_LaChaveiro/25_Mevatlin_Talmud_Torah.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for various sources regarding interrupting one's learning to do a mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

Such bread if made in a way that's ossur, would be ossur to eat even by itself. </p>\n\n<p>However what about the celim that the bread was baked in? Would those celim be \"ossur\" now just like the bread is? </p>\n\n<p>We find in Yoreh Deah Siman 113 that the celim that a non-Jew cooked food in would need to be kashered. While there is a maklokes Rishonim about this and the Shulachan Aruch brings down 2 opinions it seems that the accepted psak l'maseh is that the celim need to be kashered. The reason being is that since Chazal were gozer that the food is ossur, then just like any other issur, the blias also become ossur (granted though there are Rishonim that argue and the Gra over there says that the reason of the issur of bishul akum wouldn't be shayach by blias.)

If\npareve bread is to be baked in the oven, the oven will anyways need\nkashering so that the kosher bread can be labeled pareve. However, the\nquestion arises whether cakes or cookies, which are permitted to be\nlabeled dairy, can be baked in the oven without kashering. Do we view\ndairy breads just like every other ma’achalos assuros? Teshuvas\nTzemech Tzedek (Hakadmon) siman 80 writes that dairy bread is a full\nissur d’rabbanan and compares pas ha’nilush b’chalav to chicken cooked\nwith milk. Therefore, according to Tzemech Tzedek the keilim would\ndefinitely require kashering.</p>\n<p>However, Chavas Da’as (Y.D. 97:2) and\nYad Yehuda (Y.D. 97:5) disagree, and say that pas ha’nilush b’chalav\nis more kal, and will not give a bliyos issur into other foods. Yad\nYehuda compares dairy bread to bishul akum which likewise is batel\nb’rov. Although there are two opinions brought in Shulchan Aruch as to\nwhether one needs to kasher from bishul akum, and l’halacha we are\nmachmir, however Rav Schachter explains that regarding pas ha’nilush\nb’chalav there is even more reason to be maikel. Rav Schachter\nexplains (K-329), based on Ha’gos Issur V’heter (klal 39; brought by\nShach 97:2), that pas ha’nilush b’chalav is only a safek issur (i.e.\nmaybe it will be eaten with dairy, maybe it will be eaten with meat).</p>\n<p>This is more similar to eating milk after meat without waiting 6\nhours, since this might lead to eating milk and meat together. The\nissur is on the person eating the food, not on the food. Additionally,\nHa’gos Rebbi Akiva Eiger (O.C. 196:1) writes that one who ate pas\nha’nilush b’chalav may be included in a ziymun, since it is an issur\nkal. Rebbi Akiva Eiger explains that dairy bread is more kal than\nother issurim, since according to some poskim the issur can be removed\nby dividing up the dairy bread among many recipients so that each\nreceives a davar mu’at and there will be no leftovers. Although we\ndon’t pasken like this opinion, still Rav Schachter argues that we can\nrely on this opinion regarding kashering. However, Rav Schachter\ncautioned that although, m’ikar ha’din we may be maikel, but since\nmany poskim were machmir, lichatchila one should not permit dairy\nbread to be baked on kosher keilim, unless one will kasher. However,\nin situations where it will be difficult, perhaps one can be maikel,\nsince this is the ikar ha’din.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For further sources see also <a href=\"https://thehalacha.com/wp-content/uploads/Vol4Issue13.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/making-dairy-bread/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a>.

Would it make a difference if they did not receive a minhag from their family?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Follow up question to come.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>No, you are not allowed to invent your own minhag for wrapping the tefillin.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2017/07/11/are-you-permitted-to-invent-your-own-tefillin-minhag/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Din Online</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Are you permitted to invent your own tefillin minhag?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The method in which a man wraps the strap of the tefillin shel yad around his arm and hand is generally passed on from father to son. So in other words, one learns how to wrap the tefillin around the arm and hand from his father, who presumably learned it from his father, etc.\n  Ba’alei teshuva generally take on the minhag of their rabbi/community, or if the minhag of their father or grandfather is known, they take on that minhag. For gerim, the minhag of the rabbi/community is used.\n  My question is, is one allowed to invent their own method of laying tefillin? Would the answer change if one didn’t have a minhag from his ancestors?\n  If the answer is yes, then what are the regulations and guidelines for inventing one’s own way? For instance:\n  – Must the black side of the straps be showing to the outside at all times, including when the strap is wrapped around the underside of the hand?\n  – Is the forming of the shin (either on the hand or arm like Chabad) or other letters (dalet; yud) halacha?\n  – Can you make more than seven/eight wraps around the arm, such as thirteen wraps?\n  Obviously, it is usually not a wise idea to “invent ways” of performing mitzvot. But I want a minhag to pass onto my son, and since I did not receive a minhag from my father, I’d like to have something a little more “special” than a traditional, “general” minhag (such as the Ashkenazi method or Chabad method).</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>It is very nice and special that you want to be able to pass significant things to your children. However one should not invent his own minhagim. Minhagim are usually based on the halachic rulings, or customs of great Rabbis, generally who lived hundreds of years ago and have very solid basis, with great torah scholars. (There are many books written explaining the sources of the various minhagim). Although there are various rules when one may change from the customs of a certain communities minhag, we cannot just make up what we want to do. When doing so, we are likely to end up transgressing some rules that you may not be aware of.</p>\n  \n  <p>Besides this, there is another reason. If you pass down a minhag that has a tradition, then you are giving your children a connection to very deeply rooted traditions, and actions that have deep meaning to them. On the other hand if your children will get your original “home cooked” custom, that isn’t based on anything except for the desire to be original, different or “special”, it might be different etc., but in essence it will be shallow and meaningless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Yes you are allowed to invent your own custom for wrapping the Shel Yad.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Maharashdam (basing himself on the Ran) there is no such thing as a positively binding minhag.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בטורקיה נתקבל נוסח הספרדים. וקמו מערערים לומר שרוצים להתפלל כסדר מנהג אבותיהם. ז\"ל שו\"ת מהרשד\"ם (אורח חיים סימן לה), לא מצאנו ולא ראינו שאין לשנות מנהג אבותינו כי אם בדבר שיש בו נידנוד איסור. בכי-האי-גוונא דליכא צד איסור כלל ועיקר, ולא הרחקת עבירה -- בהא פשיטא דלא שייך ביה משום \"אל תטוש תורת אמך\". וכן יש לדקדק מלשון הר\"ן שכתב (פסחים פרק ד ד\"ה ונמצינו = דף יז ע\"ב בדפי הרי\"ף): נמצינו למדים בתורת המנהגות שכל מנהג איסור שהוא מעיר אחת -- כל שאינו מנהג בטעות אלא שהם החמירו על עצמן לעשות סייג לתורה או לדבר שהוא מחלוקת בין חכמי ישראל ונהגו כדברי האוסר כל בני העיר, חייבין בו מן הדין, ואפילו בצינעא, עד שיעקור דירתו משם ויקבענה בעיר אחרת, עכ\"ל הר\"ן. ומדאמר הר\"ן שכל מנהג איסור וכו', ולא קאמר שכל מנהג סתם, משמע דלא אמרינן הכי אלא בדבר איסור שנהגו במקומו הוא דאין לשנות. הא במידי דליכא צד איסור כלל -- פשיטא שאין קפידא כלל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Summary: Only minhagim which have a minud (a little bit of) prohibition in them are obligatory. And he states this is not his new idea, but rather it was taught by the Ran.</p>\n\n<p>A current Sephardic Rabbi named Rabbi Uri Nahum says explicitly you can wrap it however you want, even just to \"make it cool\":  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vun2OCL5vn0&feature=youtu.be&t=32m52s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vun2OCL5vn0&feature=youtu.be&t=32m52s</a></p>\n\n<p>So you can definitely make up your own wrapping, or decide to use one of the many beautiful minhagim from Jews all over the world.</p>\n\n\n",

In Bamidbar 12:10 Aharon \"turned\", and the Gemara there explains that he too had tzaraat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כיוצא בדבר אתה אומר (במדבר יב, ט) ויחר אף ה' בם וילך מלמד שאף אהרן נצטרע דברי רבי עקיבא אמר לו רבי יהודה בן בתירא עקיבא בין כך ובין כך אתה עתיד ליתן את הדין אם כדבריך התורה כסתו ואתה מגלה אותו ואם לאו אתה מוציא לעז על אותו צדיק</p>\n<p>On a similar note, Rabbi Akiva revealed an additional matter not explicitly articulated in the Torah. You say that when Aaron and Miriam spoke against Moses, both Aaron and Miriam were struck with leprosy, as it written: “And God became angry at them and He left, and the cloud departed from above the tent, and behold, Miriam was leprous like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous” (Numbers 12:9–10). The verse’s statement that God became angry at both of them teaches that Aaron, too, became leprous; this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira said to him: Akiva, in either case you will be judged in the future for this teaching. If the truth is in accordance with your statement, the Torah concealed Aaron’s punishment and you reveal it. And if the truth is not in accordance with your statement, you are unjustly slandering that righteous man.</p>\n<p>ואלא הכתיב בם ההוא בנזיפה בעלמא תניא כמאן דאמר אף אהרן נצטרע דכתיב (במדבר יב, י) ויפן אהרן אל מרים והנה מצורעת תנא שפנה מצרעתו</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: However, didn’t Rabbi Akiva derive this from the plural pronoun them, meaning that God was angry with both of them? The Gemara answers: God’s anger in that verse was manifest in a mere rebuke, not in leprosy. A baraita was taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, who said that Aaron also became leprous, as it is written: “And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous” (Numbers 12:10), and it was taught: This teaches that he turned, i.e., he was healed, from his leprosy, as he too had been afflicted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All quotes including translations from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.9?lang=bi&p2=Chizkuni,_Numbers.12.9.1&lang2=bi&p3=Shabbat.97a.2&lang3=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/avot/9-2.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avot DeRav Natan 9:2</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מתוך שעמדו שניהם ודברו בצדיק, בא עליהם את הפורענות. שנאמר: (שם) \"ויחר\nאף ה' בם וילך\". מה תלמוד לומר 'וילך'?  מלמד שנסתלק מאהרן ודבק במרים,\nמפני שלא היה אהרן עסקן בדברים,  אבל מרים שהיתה עוסקת בדברים מיד נענשה\nיותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Synopsis:</p>\n<p>Citing verse 9 \"G-d was angry with them and he went away\".

Secondly, we have Ms. Yad Harav Herzog, which is a 16th century Yemenite manuscript of Sanhedrin, Makkot and most of Ta'anit. Other 16th century Yemenites manuscripts include Ms. New York 1623, which contains Yoma and Pesachim, the 1546 Ms. Columbia X893, containing Pesachim and Megillah, Mo'ed Katan and Zevachim, and Ms. Oxford 2677, containing most of Sukkah. There's also Ms. Vatican 125, written either in Spain or in North Africa, and contains almost all of Pesachim. Ms. New York 218 is a 17th century Yemenite manuscript containing Yoma, Sukkah and parts of Rosh Hashanah. Ms. New York 108 is even older, a Yemenite manuscript from the 14th or 15th century, containing parts of Sukkah, Rosh Hashanah and Yoma. For more information on these manuscripts and others, see <a href=\"https://bavli.genizah.org/Content/pdfFile/Introductions_B/Introductions_Eng/Bbackground%20to%20complete%20mss%202019.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> [PDF link].</p>\n<p>The above is about the Bavli. Regarding the Yerushalmi, even less manuscripts, fragmentary or otherwise, have survived. Besides for the reasons stated above, which are also relevant for the Yerushalmi, the Yerushalmi's preservation was also minimal because it was much less studied. Therefore, it was less in demand and less copied.</p>\n\n\n",

This restriction applied only to the <em>mishkan</em>, because then the job of being a Levite included constructing and assembling the structure. But in the temple, the Levites' duties aren't so physical; they involve singing and assisting the <em>kohanim</em>. The talmud learns that this applied only in the wilderness from <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0404.htm#47\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Num 4:47</a> -- \"to do the work of service and the work of bearing burdens\".</p>\n\n<p>R. Moshe Shamah (Recalling the Covenant p. 694) adduces textual support for this resolution from the difference in description in the two verses. In (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.4.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">4:3</a>) it describes those from age 30 as those who come to perform the service: כָּל־בָּא֙ לַצָּבָ֔א <strong>לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת מְלָאכָ֖ה</strong> בְּאֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵֽד. However, in describing age 25 in (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.8.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">8:24</a>), the verse states:יָבוֹא֙ לִצְבֹ֣א צָבָ֔א <strong>בַּעֲבֹדַ֖ת אֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵֽד</strong>. Here is omits more active term מלאכה with the more generic עבודה, and more significantly replaces the prefix ל (to), as in \"those who gather <em>to</em> perform, with the prefix ב (in or around), as in \"those who gather around the service\", i.e. to learn from it, but not to perform it themselves.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.8.24?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Numbers.8.26&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra (8:24)</a> reconciles these contradictory verses by proposing that the age of twenty five was appropriate only for the work of the tent (עבודת אוהל) whereas thirty was appropriate for carrying the equipment (עבודת משא). The Ibn Ezra doesn't elaborate on the subject and leaves us wondering as to what constitutes עבודת אוהל?</p>\n<p>The interpretation of the Rashbam (ibid) may shed some light on this ambiguity (note that the Rashbam does not address the Ibn Ezra here, but gives his own interpretation, however it is possible that he saw his commentary and was influenced by him). According to him, the age of twenty five was appropriate for guarding the Mishkan (משמרת המשכן) only. When the Levite reached the age of thirty he was eligible for עבודת משא as well.</p>\n<p>Alternatively the Ramban explains that a Levite at the age of twenty five was eligible for עבודת משא as well. This is evident from the Parsha (8:24) where  עבודת משא is clearly included within the duties of the Levite, thus refuting the interpretation of the Ibn Ezra. Rather the Parsha in Behalotecha (8:24) is teaching us that the Levite is not able to become an overseer (פקיד ונגיד) until he reaches the age of thirty. The reason for this is explained by the Ramban (8:24)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והטעם בזה, כי כל אדם נותן לבו בעשרותיו, כי ישתנו בהן הטבעים וידע\nבהגיעו לעשרים\nאו לשלשים, כי ידעו בו שכניו וקרוביו ואביו ואמו וילדיו ויודיעוהו, אבל\nבהגיעו לכ\"ה לא ירגישו בו כל כך, ולכן לא צוה למשה שיטרח למנות רק מבן\nשלשים שהאיש נודע בהן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to explain that the reason why in the first temple they included Levites that were only twenty years old (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25a23.htm#24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Divrei hayumim 23:24-28</a>), is because since there was no more carrying to be done as in the times of the Mishkan (only  those chores enumerated in 1 Divrei hayumim 23:24-28) even the young Levites (from the age of twenty and on) were eligible for it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tent of meeting (אוהל מועד) in the camp or outside it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Bamidbar (11:26) we read,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּשָּׁאֲרוּ שְׁנֵי אֲנָשִׁים בַּמַּחֲנֶה שֵׁם הָאֶחָד אֶלְדָּד\n  וְשֵׁם הַשֵּׁנִי מֵידָד וַתָּנַח עֲלֵהֶם הָרוּחַ וְהֵמָּה בַּכְּתֻבִים\n   וְלֹא יָצְאוּ הָאֹהֱלָה וַיִּתְנַבְּאוּ בַּמַּחֲנֶה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this verse it seems like the אוהל מועד was situated outside the camp, since they had to \"go out\" from the camp (ולא יצאו האהלה) so they can be endowed with the spirit of god resting on Moses (However see Ibn Ezra 11:26 for variant reading). But from chapter 2 it is evident that the אוהל מועד was in the center of the camp and in their midst. How can we reconcile these two contradictory chapters?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The maharzav in his commentary to Shmos Rabbah 51:2 addresses this contradiction and comes to the conclusion that there were indeed two Tents of meeting: one situated in the center and one outside. The one in the center was the main אוהל מועד where the Ark was stored and was used for all the cultic purposes, while the outside tent was only used for Torah learning (similar to the function of a modern Beis Medrash) and possibly for oracular purposes as well. This is supported by the Midrash in Pekudai (Shmos Rabbah 51:2) and another Midrash brought in the Yalkut where it is clearly stated that two tents functioned simultaneously in the Midbar. According to the Midrah the Israelites gave too much money for the construction of the Mishkan, when Betzalel asked Moshe what to do with the surplus he dedicated it for another Mishkan (which refers to the outside tent according to the Maharzav). He also supports his thesis with the story of Moses, after the sin of the golden calf, erecting a tent outside the camp and calling it אוהל מועד related in Shmos 33,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ז) וּמשֶׁה יִקַּח אֶת הָאֹהֶל וְנָטָה לוֹ מִחוּץ לַמַּחֲנֶה הַרְחֵק\n  מִן הַמַּחֲנֶה וְקָרָא לוֹ אֹהֶל מוֹעֵד וְהָיָה כָּל מְבַקֵּשׁ יְדֹוָד\n  יֵצֵא אֶל אֹהֶל מוֹעֵד אֲשֶׁר מִחוּץ לַמַּחֲנֶה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though it was only used for a short period until the Mishkan was erected (see rashi Shmos 33:11), since it was used for the 'מבקשי ה - for those seeking Torah knowledge, they had to erect a new tent (after Moshe dismantled his own tent) so that the 'מבקשי ה can assemble and learn Torah regularly. According to this explanation, the אוהל מועד mentioned here is the one that was used for Torah learning and for oracular purposes (which was indeed the case here in 11:26).</p>\n\n<p>However, it is likely that Moshe never dismantled his tent but left it outside the camp all forty years. If such an interpretation is warranted, we can say that the tent mentioned in Bamidbar 11:26 is indeed this same tent which was also called tent of meeting. According to this explanation the אוהל מועד mentioned here is referring to a different kind of tent mentioned in Shmos as the tent of Moses, and we don't have to invent other tents that were not recorded in the Torah. see also Jacob Milgrom, The JPS Torah Commentary: Numbers, p. 386 for fuller discussion.    </p>\n\n\n",

This is not dispositive; they often talk about many areas of <em>halacha</em> as if these areas had current application regardless of whether they did in fact have current application. Still it’s interesting to see discussion of polygamy in which nobody suggests that polygamy is a dead letter. At Succah 27a4 someone asks R’ Eliezer about the correct way to fulfill the Succah obligations given that he (the one asking the question) has one wife in Tiberius and one in Tzipori; questions about polygamy arise at Kiddushin 50b3, Bava Basra 143a2, etc. In Tractate Yevamos (as for example Yevamos 65a3) the topic arises again and again; one of the major topics of the tractate is whether a given man and woman should perform a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levirate_marriage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">levirate marriage</a>, given various relationships among the parties that can include the other wives of the deceased or surviving brother.</li>\n<li>Where rabbis mention their own wives, the Gemara seems uncurious about the order of the marriages or how they ended. For example, we’re told (Avodah Zarah 20a3 #28, cf. Nedarim-50b Rishoinim) that Rabbi Akiva married the former Mrs. Turnus Rufus. The Gemara doesn’t seem to mind that elsewhere in Shas R’ Akiva married [Rachel] the daughter of a [Bar] Kalbua Savua (Nedarim 50a1, Kesubos 62b, Chagigah 12a5).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But I definitely agree that what's more striking is the seeming <em>scarcity</em> of polygamy during a period before the famous ban, with only a very few references in such an enormous record of life in the age of Chazal.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Some of my page numbers are ArtScroll-style, in which style the Vilna page number is followed by a digit reflecting the number of pages of translation. For example, Succah 27a4 refers to Vilna Succah 27a, but page 4 in ArtScroll's translation of that page. This specificity might sometimes be useful even to someone uninterested in ArtScroll's translation, as a way of identifying a place on the daf.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's seems that there  was such an instance . In Yevamos 15a that Abba had two wives.</p>\n<p>תָּא שְׁמַע: מַעֲשֶׂה בְּבִתּוֹ שֶׁל רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל שֶׁהָיְתָה נְשׂוּאָה לְאַבָּא אָחִיו, וּמֵת בְּלֹא בָּנִים, וְיִיבֵּם רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל אֶת צָרָתָהּ. וְתִסְבְּרָא, רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל מִתַּלְמִידֵי בֵּית שַׁמַּאי הוּא?\nThe Gemara suggests:</p>\n<p>Come and hear an incident involving Rabban Gamliel’s daughter, who was married to Abba, his brother, and Abba died childless, and Rabban Gamliel entered into levirate marriage with her rival wife.</p>\n\n\n",

Does the type of Aramaic used there support the view of the higher critics who assert that the book was composed in the second century BCE near the time of the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, and not in the sixth century BCE according to the traditional view?  The classic commentators do not address this issue which has arisen in modern times, and the few modern Jewish commentaries on <em>Daniel</em>, if they do address it, are not available in English on the Internet.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The question posed requires an expert in Aramaic.  One such expert was Sir Godfrey Rolles Driver.  In 1926, in an article in <em>Journal of Biblical Literature</em>, Volume 45, 'The Aramaic of the Book of Daniel,' he demonstrated that the Aramaic of <em>Daniel</em> is certainly later than the Aramaic of the Elephantine Papyri, which date from the end of the fifth century BCE: <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3260169\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jstor.org/stable/3260169</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since G. R. Driver's study, fragments of <em>Daniel</em> were discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran. These finds challenge the view that the book was composed in the time of the Maccabees in the late second century BCE, but they do not overthrow Driver's linguistically established later-than-the-fifth-century BCE view.\nSee Gerhard Hasel, 'New Light on the Book of Daniel from the Dead Sea Scrolls' (1992): <a href=\"http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2012/07/31/New-Light-on-the-Book-of-Daniel-from-the-Dead-Sea-Scrolls.aspx#Article\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2012/07/31/New-Light-on-the-Book-of-Daniel-from-the-Dead-Sea-Scrolls.aspx#Article</a></p>\n\n<p>Klaus Koch in <em>Das Buch Daniel</em> (1980) has attempted more precision.  He concluded that recent research (which he thoroughly documented) suggests that the Aramaic of <em>Daniel</em> is Imperial Aramaic which should be dated no later than 300 BCE.  He boldly asserted that higher critics and their Maccabean date have lost the battle (pp. 45-46).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Aramaic in the Book of Daniel has two purposes: (1) the Aramaic provided a perfect chiasm to the parallel Hebrew portions of the text; and (2) the Aramaic is special divine revelation to the Gentiles, who spoke Aramaic. </p>\n\n<p>First, there are two chiasms in the Book of Daniel: one in Aramaic and one in Hebrew. Both sets of chiasms appear to be parallel in content and meaning notwithstanding they are <strong><em>not</em></strong> in chronological order (and therefore the chiasms were easier to construct). For example, the first chapter of the Book of Daniel is an introduction (Hebrew), however chapters 2-7 (Aramaic) and 8-12 (Hebrew) appear to be in precise chiasmic order: that is, chapters 2-7 (Aramaic) appear to be one chiasm and chapters 7-12 (Hebrew) appear to be the second parallel chiasm. Both chiasms appear to be precise parallels in content and meaning.</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Chapter 1 - Introduction\n       Chapter 2 - Kingdom Rule (Four Gentile + 1 Jewish)\n            Chapter 3 - Tribulation & Testing from Gentile power\n                Chapter 4 - Divine deliverance by angel(s)\n                Chapter 5 - Divine deliverance by angel(s)\n            Chapter 6 - Tribulation & Testing from Gentile power\n       Chapter 7 - Kingdom Rule (Four Gentile + 1 Jewish)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As mentioned, chapters 2-7 are in Aramaic because the text indicates that the direct audience of the divine revelation were Gentile world rulers (Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the audience for the remainder of the book appears to be Jewish because there are seven mentions of the sacred Tetragrammaton, which would only resonate with devout Jews. Also, there are several allusions to the fulfillment of the prophecies of Jeremiah, which would only resonate with devout Jews. The second chiasm repeats (and amplifies) the earlier chiasm of the book in content and meaning, which is common to the dichromatic structure of all Hebrew narrative and poetry. </p>\n\n<pre><code>       Chapter 7 - Kingdom Rule (Four Gentile + 1 Jewish)\n            Chapter 8 - Tribulation & Testing from Gentile power\n                Chapter 9 -  Divine intervention by angel(s)\n                Chapter 10 - Divine intervention by angel(s)\n            Chapter 11 - Tribulation & Testing from Gentile power\n       Chapter 12 - Kingdom Rule (Jewish)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both chiasms describe events that are not in chronological order, because if the events were in chronological order, the chiasms would not work. For example, in the first chiasm the events of Chapter 7 occurred before the events of Chapter 5 (compare <a href=\"http://legacy.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%207%3A1&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dan 7:1</a> with <a href=\"http://legacy.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%205:30&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dan 5:30</a>); and in the second chiasm the events of Chapter 10 occurred before the events of Chapter 9 (compare <a href=\"http://legacy.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%2010%3A1&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dan 10:1</a> and <a href=\"http://legacy.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan%209%3A1&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dan 9:1</a>). This flipping and flopping of chronology therefore made the logical formation of the respective chiasms possible, because if the text reported the events in chronological sequence, the chiasms would have been fractured.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the Aramaic of this book was deliberate and had a twofold purpose: (1) the Aramaic provided a perfect chiasm to the parallel Hebrew portions of the text; and (2) the Aramaic was direct special divine revelation to the Gentiles, who spoke Aramaic. A third purpose now appears evident: the arrangement of Aramaic and Hebrew in chiasm was to preserve the text from later corruption. In other words, the brilliance of the Jewish author of this text was to write predictive prophecies in such a way that should later copyists corrupt the text, the chiasms would fracture. For example, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and many other ancient and modern translations of the Book of Daniel contain corrupt deutero-canonical elements, because the Aramaic and Hebrew chiasms are fractured. In other words, the Book of Daniel was written and structured with the subtle, nay, almost undetectable nuance of chiasm which later copyists failed to notice when they sought to corrupt the text with extraneous deutero-canonical elements. The deutero-canonical elements \"watered down\" the force of predictive prophecy and fulfillment found in the Book of Daniel. Finally, if the Septuagint is a corrupt form of the Book of Daniel, then the Masoretic Text preserves the original text, which would preexist the Septuagint, and therefore date the Book of Daniel years before the Septuagint ever appeared.</p>\n\n<p>Where did the author of the Book of Daniel get this subtle idea of using Aramaic in chiasm with Hebrew? The author may have derived the idea <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/4940/why-is-jer-1011-written-in-aramaic\">from the single verse in Jeremiah that is written in Aramaic</a>, which provides chiasm and parallel for its own immediate context.</p>\n\n\n",

The <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Birkat_Asher_on_Torah%2C_Numbers.13.30.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bircas Asher</a> earlier, contrasts the two sets of quail and brings many a source to say how great the first set were i.e. how it fell along with the Mann and descended in abundance etc. The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Birkat_Asher_on_Torah%2C_Numbers.11.31.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arachin 15b</a> mentions  both instances and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.15b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos</a> there notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פירש שפסק להם השליו ראשון והאספסוף אשר בקרבו התאוו תאוה לפי שלא היה להם שליו וירד להם שליו שני</p>\n<p>We can explain that the first set of quail stopped and the mob that was in their midst desired/hungered more since they didn't have any, and then the second set of quail descended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.15b.2?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Arakhin.15b.2.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> on Shemos 16:12 notes during the 40 years in the desert, the Mann fell consistently but the quail was intermittent i.e. since it was not frequent, you don't have to view it as two separate instances but as one incident that was periodic.</p>\n<p>So for those in the comments that view the quail mentioned by Rashi as going on the first set, it is possible to counter that this instance of quail was very much a continuation of the first time and as such still to be regarded as being miraculous. <strong>Therefore, either way you look at it, the quail was a miraculous occurrence and Calev was justified in mentioning it.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the late Lubavitcher Rebbe asked this exact question in his <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14931&st=&pgnum=96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likkutei Sichos (Vol. 8, pg. 85)</a>.

    "title": "Proofs that Hashem doesn't eat",
    "content": "# Proofs that Hashem doesn't eat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 21:16-19) brings several proofs that Hashem doesn't need to eat, and therefore the passuk that states that the Karban Tamid is \"my karban, my bread\" (Bamidbar 28:2) is not to be taken literally. It should be obvious that Hashem doesn't need food, and there are pesukim to that effect (see Tehillim 50), but the Midrash seeks logical proofs that it must be the case.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize these proofs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hashem is merciful, and man is naturally cruel. Why would Hashem give His food to man, and leave His satiation to man to decide whether He eats?</li>\n<li>If karbanos are for our benefit, it makes sense why the only animals used as karbanos are domestic ones. If they are for Hashem's, why wouldn't He ask for a wild animal as a delicacy every now and then?</li>\n<li>If Hashem's shechinah is able to sustain others (malachim, Moshe Rabeinu), certainly He is able to sustain Himself.</li>\n<li>No creation requires its produce to survive. Likewise, Hashem doesn't require His produce (i.e. anything) to survive.</li>\n<li>A person needs to drink several handfuls of water. If the entire world's water can fit in Hashem's Palm (Yeshaya 40:12), there's no way we could give Him enough to drink - and certainly our measly little lug (Bamidbar 28:7) wouldn't be enough. Along similar lines, the Behemoth requires an enormous amount of water to drink. Hashem, in theory, would certainly require at least that much. Also along similar lines, Shlomo and Nechemiah had an enormous feast befitting of their stature. Hashem would be impossible to feed!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The second and fifth proofs seem awfully flimsy. The Midrash later (21:22) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One verse says (Iyov 37:23), \"Shakai, He is not found full of strength,\" but it is [also] written (Iyov 36:22), \"Behold, G-d is beyond reach in His power; who can rule like Him?\" How can these two verses be reconciled? Rather, when He gives to [His creations], He gives to them according to His strength [and thus the verse in 36:22], but when He requests, He only requests according to their strength [and thus the verse in 37:23].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Midrash proceeds to record several instances of this dichotomy.</p>\n\n<p>Applying that to the earlier Midrash. Since Hashem only makes requests according to our means, of course He wouldn't ask us to go hunting for wild animals, or to feed Him the entire world's supply of water or food. How, then, can the Midrash claim that as a valid proof that Hashem doesn't need food or water? Perhaps He does, but, since He doesn't request beyond our means, He makes do with what He can?</p>\n\n\n",

Your link is to a text which abridges Rashi's commentary. The full text of Rashi is available (in Hebrew) <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14264&st=&pgnum=12\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, and (in English) <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15786#showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשה זונה • ת ״י פונדקייתא • מוכרת מני מזונות :</p>\n<p>Inkeeper: זונה. Targum Jon. renders: Innkeeper, one who sells various foodstuffs (מזונות).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi's point, in following Targum Yonasan's translation, is firstly to specifically avoid the translation of prostitute - thus he translates it as innkeeper. Secondly, he goes to show why the word zonah can indeed mean what Targum Yonasan translates it as.</p>\n<p>See though Radak (at the same Hebrew link) where he notes that Targum Yonasan, in employing this term, actually means prostitute. Even so, Rashi is following his own reading of Targum Yonasan, and therefore is NOT employing a euphemism.</p>\n<p>Radak goes on to explain why one would call a prostitute an \"inn\" -- שמפקרת עצמה לכל, that she makes herself free to everyone.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Open your Bible to Joshua chapter 2, cover the word harlot in verse one, reread the chapter and ask yourself if you are reading about a harlot or a Canaanite innkeeper who just happens to also be a weaver of fine cloth, a woman of great faith in the omnipotent G-d of Israel and a heroine who risked her very life for two men simply because they were Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>That is the context of the story, not the translation of the word zonah as harlot, a horrible translation in this context.

The Jericho authorities would not force their way into her home, instead requested she send the spies out, meaning she was a respected citizen of the community. If she were not they would have kicked in the door and put her and the spies to the sword. Finally, stop listening to the lies and gossip that have been the source of income for so many for centuries. </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Should Torah study exclude the performance of other mitzvos?",
    "content": "# Should Torah study exclude the performance of other mitzvos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Since the Mishnah teaches that \"talmud Torah kneged kulom\", and also given those who say that one should ideally learn Torah constantly, wouldn't it follow that Torah study should be performed basically to the exclusion of other mitzvos? For if studying Torah connects you to Hashem on a greater level (even qualitatively) than any other mitzvah, it wouldn't make sense to do anything else, except the bare minimumum of things that enable you to study more Torah (like practical  things such as eating/drinking or ensuring just enough livelihood to survive, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Are there any views to this effect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The reasoning on which the question is based is highly questionable and rejected by many many many sources.</p>\n\n<p>The question was whether Torah's superior status vis-à-vis other mitsvot should lead to its performance as opposed to other mitsvit.</p>\n\n<p>However numerous classical sources state that this unique status of Torah study, is specifically because, and by extension, inasmuch as it leads to performance of the mitsvot!</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly it would make no sense to sacrifice mitsvot in order to study Torah. </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.40b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 40b</a>) addresses the relative merits of Torah study and the performance of actions [other mitsvot]. The conclusion is that Torah study is greater...Since it leads to performance of the mitsvot.</p>\n\n<p>In this vein, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1303.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Talmud Torah 3:3</a>) explains the Mishna (Peah 1:1) that states that Torah is greater than all of the mitsvot -- Torah is so great, because it leads to them.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%93%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Ezriel Diena</a> writes in a responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21370&pgnum=167\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II:180</a>) that when it says that Torah study is greater than all the mitsvot, it doesn't mean that it itself is greater than mitsvot; rather that through it one will come to perform the mitsvot, which is itself the main thing that God wants from Man.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.40b.8?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot to Kiddushin (40b)</a> who suggest that it is only teaching that is superior to performing the mitsvot, but learning is not as great as performing the mitsvot. Alternatively, they suggest that only for the unlearned is study superior to an act, since they still do not know how to act. But, once a person is learned (and knows how to act), it is preferable for him to perform mitsvot. Similarly, see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40773&pgnum=56\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Meiri to Bava Kamma (17a)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Meiri</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38022&pgnum=50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on Moed Kattan 9b</a>) writes that the normal principle that engaging in a mitsvah exempts one from engagement in other mitsvot does not apply to Torah study, since the whole point of Torah study is the performance of other mitsvot.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Emden\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ya'akov Emden</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22301&pgnum=218\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Lehem printed with Lehem Shamayim to Pe'ah there</a>) leans towards saying that Torah is only so great when it leads to action, but when it does not lead to action, it is less praiseworthy than other mitsvot.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there is a version of the Yerushalmi Megilla (1:4) that states that the 10 people who refrain from their work and stay in the synagogue, are those like R. Yehuda who do not need to study. Rambam explains in a responsum (ed. P'er HaDor #10) that once one is learned like R. Yehuda, he should devote himself to communal affairs (in that case, conducted from the synagogue).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it makes sense that mitsvot are not ignored in toto in favor of learning Torah.</p>\n\n<p>However, although as noted the principle that engagement in one mitsvah exempts one from other mitsvot doesn't allow Torah study to exempt the performance of other <em>mandatory</em> obligations, if one nevertheless has a choice of studying Torah or performing an optional mitsvah (cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadok_HaKohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Zadok haCohen Rabinowitz</a>'s <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=2126&rid=183\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otsar Hamelekh to Hilkhot Talmud Torah 3:4</a>), one should generally prefer the former, as long as someone else will perform the mitsvah (cf. Rambam's <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1303.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Talmud Torah 3:3</a>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However, there is a dissenting view; the radical opinion of <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Hayyim Or Zarua</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=997&pgnum=136\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Responsum #183</a>) who applies the principle that one engaged in a mitsvah is exempt from other mitsvot, even to one studying Torah, and writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בחורים ההולכים ללמוד תורה פטורים מכל המצות כל זמן שהם בבית רבם </p>\n  \n  <p>Young people who go to study Torah are exempt from all the mitsvot the whole time they are in their teacher's house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This view seems to be basically what you asked for with two notable exceptions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Even R. Hayyim does not peg this on the superior nature of Torah, but instead employs the general rule of osek b'mitsvah pattur min hamitsvah.</li>\n<li>He does not say whether or not someone studying should ever do any other mitsvot. He merely states that one is exempt.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if studying Torah connects you to Hashem on a greater level (even qualitatively) than any other mitzvah, it wouldn't make sense to do anything else</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if Torah's greatness is as you claim, and even if your conclusion (that therefore it doesn't make sense to do other <em>mitzvos</em>) follows — neither of which I'm convinced of — still, our hands are tied: God commanded us to do those other <em>mitzvos</em>, and we have to obey.</p>\n\n<p>This reminds me of something I heard Rabbi Yisroel Reisman paraphrase from Rabbi <em>Tzadok</em>, the <em>kohen</em>, of Lublin. As well as I can remember it, Rabbi <em>Tzadok</em> said that someone can rise to such heights after <em>t'shuva</em>, returning from sin, that he would sin and do <em>t'shuva</em> just for that — except that his hands were tied: God had told him not to sin, so he couldn't.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam, in his introduction to this magnum opus, describes his book as being written:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כֻּלָּן בְּלָשׁוֹן בְּרוּרָה וְדֶרֶךְ קְצָרָה, עַד שֶׁתְּהֶא תּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה כֻּלָּהּ סְדוּרָה בְּפִי הַכֹּל.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>All written in a lucid language and with brevity, so that all people will be well versed in the totality of the Oral Law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Do we find praise of the Mishneh Torah among Rishonim (medieval scholars, generally 11th-16th century) that echo these sentiments: namely, its inclusivity of the entirety of the Oral Law, its profound brevity and precision of language, or further praise? Obviously, its acceptance into the canon of Jewish law is praise in of itself, but I am looking for articulated praise.</p>\n\n<p>This is relevant to Judaism because the Mishneh Torah is regarded as a central text of Jewish law, and the opinions of other Rishonim about it would seemingly carry weight in terms of its importance and application. It could also give us a new sense of appreciation of the depth and profundity of this work, assuming such praise exists.

Other than those three exceptions, they state that residents of those areas mustn't veer at all from the Mishenh Torah, whether leniently, or stringently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש מקומות מתנהגים עפ\"י הרמב\"ם ז\"ל ואינם נוטים מדעתו כמו מקומנו זה אלגזאי\"ר שהרבנים הראשונים שהיו בכאן מורינו הרי\"בש ז\"ל ומורינו הרשב\"ץ ז\"ל הסכימו שיתנהגו על משנה תורה זולתי בג' מקומות...ובזולתם אין לזוז ולא נטה ימין ושמאל מדעתו בין זכות בין חובה בין להקל בין להחמיר </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, writing in early 16th century Egypt, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_ben_Solomon_ibn_Abi_Zimra\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radvaz</a> writes in a responsum (II:424) that Rambam is considered the local authority and that his rulings have been accepted in \"all these regions\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרמב\"ם מאריה דאתרא הוא וכבר קבלו כל אלו הגלילות פסקי דינו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

R.

    "title": "Linking two sources on Ben Zoma and richness",
    "content": "# Linking two sources on Ben Zoma and richness\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EconTalker/status/874265129231278081\" rel=\"noreferrer\">recently came across</a> a report of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_ben_Zoma\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ben Zoma</a> being rich, and it made me wonder whether there's any relationship between that and his famous definition of \"richness\" in Avot.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraita\" rel=\"noreferrer\">baraita</a></em> quoted in the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.58a.3-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 58a</a>) tells us that Ben Zoma, contemplating a very large crowd of Jews in Jerusalem, blessed God for the fact that He \"created all these to serve me.\"<sup>1</sup> He went on to explain that unlike the original human (Adam), who had to produce all of his needs (e.g. food and clothing) entirely by himself, \"I wake up and find all of these prepared for me. All nations diligently come to the entrance of my home, and I wake up and find all of these before me.\" In other words, he has access to a multitude of goods that he didn't produce himself.</p>\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.58a.4?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">explains</a> \"all nations diligently come to the entrance of my home\" to mean \"He was rich, so they all came to him for trade.\"<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>I find this report that Ben Zoma was rich interesting both internally and with respect to another source. Internally, I wonder why it was necessary to say that Ben Zoma, personally, was rich, since one did not have to be personally rich, even 2000 years ago, to have much more access to trade goods than the original human did.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>But also, we know that Ben Zoma had his own definition for rich, as seen in the Mishna - <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avot 4:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵיזֶהוּ עָשִׁיר, הַשָּׂמֵחַ בְּחֶלְקוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.128.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">תהלים קכח</a>) יְגִיעַ כַּפֶּיךָ כִּי תֹאכֵל אַשְׁרֶיךָ וְטוֹב לָךְ. אַשְׁרֶיךָ, בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה. וְטוֹב לָךְ, לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא.‏</p>\n<p>Who is the rich one? He who is happy with his lot, as it says, \"When you eat [from] the work of your hands, you will be happy, and it will be well with you\" (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.128.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Psalms 128:2</a>). \"You will be happy\" in this world, and \"it will be well with you\" in the world to come.<sup>4</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes me wonder whether it's possible that when Rashi said that Ben Zoma was rich, he meant \"rich\" in Ben Zoma's sense - happy with his lot. Of course, it's not obvious how being \"rich,\" by this definition, would result, as Rashi says, in access to trade. However, the context there is Ben Zoma expressing a particular kind of happiness with his lot.</p>\n<p>Further complicating matters, the verse Ben Zoma quotes in Avot speaks of the virtue of consuming \"the work of your hands,\" while in Berachot, Ben Zoma was expressing particular happiness at <em>not</em> having to depend on the work of his own hands, as the original human had.</p>\n<p><strong>As I've demonstrated, there seems to be a significant amount of conceptual overlap, and possibly conflict, between these two sources. Do any commentaries explore this interaction?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1. Talmud translations from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/william-davidson-talmud\" rel=\"noreferrer\">William Davidson Talmud, via Sefaria</a>.

Pesachya Menkin appears to link the two statements in his commentary to the mishnah in Avot.</p>\n\n<p>He explains the statement in Berachot as commenting on the fact that so much work has to go into every thing you have and consume (e.g. plowing, planting, harvesting, etc. to make bread) and it is all done by others while you just get the final product. The statement in Avot is saying that when you have this awareness, you see how wealthy you really are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nachalat Avot 4:1</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל באמת המתבונן היטב יראה שכל אדם באשר הוא הוא עשיר שכל מלאכתו נעשית\n  על ידי אחרים הא לך חשבון צדק הפת שאדם אוכל כמה מלאכות דרושות לכך עד\n  שיהיה מוכשר לאכלו חרישה זריעה קצירה דישה ברירה טחינה לישה ואפיה ורדיה\n  וכן מלבוש האדם כמה מלאכות ראוי לזה עד שיהיה ראוי ללבישה גיזה טויה\n  שזירה אריגה נתיחה תפירה ומכונת התפירה כמה מלאכות דרושות לה כמה גלגלים\n  ואופנים וכלים מכלים שונים דרושות עד שתהיה ראויה לתפירה וכן הלאה כל מה\n  שהאדם משתמש בו כמה מלאכות שונות דרושות עד שיהיה ראוי לאותו תשמיש שהוא\n  משתמש בו והקב\"ה ברא את כל אלה שכולם כאחד ימלאו את החיסרון אשר יחסר לכל\n  אחד ואחד בהתבונן האדם אל כל אלה כמה ישמח לבו על עשירתו המופלגת את\n  הרעיון הזה כבר אמר בן זומא כמה יגיעות יגע אדם הראשון עד שמצא פת לאכול\n  חרש וזרע וקצר ועמר ודש וזרה ובירר וטחן ורקד ולש ואפה ואחר כך אכל ואני\n  משכים ומוצא כל אלו כשהוא מתוקן לפני כמה יגיעות יגע אדם הראשון עד שמצא\n  בגד ללבוש אני משכים ללבוש גזז ולבן ונפץ וטוה וארג ואחר כך מצא בגד\n  ומוצא כל אלו לפני </p>\n  \n  <p>זהו עומק כוונת דבריו כאן איזהו עשיר השמח בחלקו כי כל המלאכות ההכרחיות\n  לצרכי חייו כבר נעשו על ידי אחרים ומוכנות ועומדות לפניו לתשמישיו ואם כן\n  עשיר הוא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it possible to lodge an appeal for a soul that has gone to Gehenom?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Unsong is a work of online serial fiction by Scott Alexander which is based heavily on Judaism. (I highly recommend it to Jews and Gentiles alike.). As I discussed in my earlier question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/76685/11964\">here</a>, the Talmudic story of Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah, aka Acher, plays a prominent role.  Now the <a href=\"http://unsongbook.com/chapter-72-and-builds-a-heaven-in-hells-despair/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">last chapter</a> of Unsong presents a fictionalized account of the aftermath of  Acher's death.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[O]ne day Acher died, and the people said that it was not good, because he had never repented, and Rabbi Meir laughed and said that surely had had repented in his heart and was in Paradise. And then flames started coming out of Acher’s grave, and the people were like, we’re not rabbis, and we’re no experts in omens, but that doesn’t seem, to us, like the sort of thing that happens when you’re in Paradise. And Rabbi Meir said very well, but that God would relent and redeem him later. And the people said that, again, we’re no experts and you’re the one with the rabbinical degree, but a voice had very clearly rung forth from the holy places saying that wouldn’t happen. And Rabbi Meir said that very well, maybe He wouldn’t, but if God wouldn’t redeem Acher, then he, Rabbi Meir, would redeem Acher.  And the people said, what, that doesn’t even make sense, is redemption not reserved for God alone? And Rabbi Meir said that wasn’t exactly true. <strong>That what we do during our lives echoes forward into history, and that good deeds that seemed tiny when they happened might grow and grow until they consumed the entire world, and if the recording angels had discounted them when they first reviewed the case, an appeal might be lodged.</strong> And that one day, when he was studying Torah under Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah, Rabbi Meir had gotten something from him, some tiny spark of goodness, and that was what had inspired him to be good himself throughout his life. And so he would train his disciples to be good, and they would train their disciples to be good, until the world was safe and free, and all of it would be because of this one man, Acher, a wicked wicked man who would not repent, and God would be forced to credit those deeds to Acher’s name, and he would rise into Paradise, unrepentant still.  And the people asked, huh, how does that even work? and Rabbi Meir said that this was all playing out on hidden levels, that the point was to redeem the sparks of divinity that had gotten caught among the klipot of the world, and that each of our actions changes and redirects the flow of subtle currents upon which the sparks are borne. And even though Acher had died without repenting, even though everything he did seemed to the material eye to be evil and without merit, behind the scenes the sparks had been pushed into new configurations, whole fiery rivers of sparks, flowing through Rabbi Meir and through all the other people he had touched in his life, and that when all those rivers met and reached the sea, we would get Moschiach, the savior, and the whole world would be reconciled to God. Say not, he told the people, that anything has worked only evil, that any life has been in vain. Say rather that while the visible world festers and decays, somewhere beyond our understanding the groundwork is being laid for Moschiach, and the final victory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now as can be seen from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/76714/11964\">this answer</a>, this whole dialogue between Rabbi Meir and the people isn't present in the Talmud, it's just a literary creation.  Still, I'm interested in whether the content of what Rabbi Meir says here is based on Jewish beliefs, specifically the part in bold.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, is it true that it's possible to lodge an appeal for a soul that has gone to Gehenom, if the recording angels who made the decision to send the soul there failed to take into account tiny good deeds which later led to enormous good in the world?  Or is this whole concept just artistic license?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi's</a> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/41644\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">version</a> of that story has it that he saved him while Rabbi Meir was still alive.

    "content": "# Which foreign names did Jews associate with Hebrew names, and why?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A famous Medrash appears in slightly different versions in Lev Rabbah 32:05 and Songs Rabbah 4:12. The Medrah praises the Jews of the Egyptian slavery for certain attributes, such as their retention of their Hebrew names. It goes on to list several examples of Hebrew names retained (Reuvein, Shimon, Yehudah, Yoseif, Binyomin) and other foreign names (Alexandri, Leon, Lestes, Luliani, Rofeh or Rufus) for which they were not exchanged. The Hebrew and foreign names were paired inconsistently in the Hebrew and Soncino volumes that I saw. In the Hebrew Lev Rabbah, a commentary called something like <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chidushei Haradal</a> attempts to sort it all out.</p>\n\n<p>Now on the one hand, it makes no difference which Hebrew name is paired with which foreign name in the example; the point is not that any <em>particular</em> foreign name was avoided, but that <em>all</em> foreign names were avoided, as Hebrew names were retained. The Hebrew names in the example are some of the sons of Yisro'el, and there's a long tradition of using such names as hypothetical parties (for example at Pesachim 31a1 and in Rashi's comments to Lev 1:3). Perhaps these are simply arbitrary examples.</p>\n\n<p>Still, there's something funny about the examples. There's a finger-wagging tone: they didn't change their names, but what about you? Why can't you be more like your big brothers Reuvein and Shimon? Perhaps this tone derives partly from the use of classical names apparently more appropriate to the milieu of Chazal than to the period of Egyptian slavery supposedly under consideration. So I wonder: were these substitutions common in the period of Chazal, and if so, why?\n(It reminds me of American Jews born in the 1940's, amongst whom Morris was Moshe, and Isador was Yisro'el, and it all seemed to go without saying.) The aforementioned Chidushei Haradal speaks to the point at 21.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/awkZ0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/awkZ0.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\nOn his view of it, the contrasting pairs are Yehudah/Leoni, Reuvein/Rofe and Yosieif/Adatish.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Reuvein/Rofe</strong>\nRofe, he thinks, is a Latin nickname for Maruvein, or from Rubino, the Latin name for the color red and for the red stone known to us as Avnei Oidem [as at Ex 28:17 and Ex 39:10 to 13]... and Rufus is the Latin word for \"red.\"\nI'm a little confused what that is supposed to add up to. I guess that the Chidushei Haradal thinks of Rufus and Rofe as one name, used for Reuvein purely because it sounds a bit like it; and he thinks that the connections to colors or gemstones have nothing to do with it? The Living Torah notes at Ex 28:17 that Oidem represents Reuvein on the breastplate, and that it is red; and classical sources are cited. It feels like this is what the Chidushei Haradal was thinking, but I don't see that he says it. (And by the way, English dictionaries give a Latin word like Rubinus in the etymology of Ruby.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Yehudah/Leoni</strong>\nLeoni is the Latin word for Lion, used for Yehudah because of the passage (Gen. 49:9) in which Yisro'el calls Yehudah a lion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Yoiseif/Adatish</strong>\nAdatish is the Latin word for Yoiseif.\nNow what could this mean? How is there a Latin word for Yoiseif? The names don't sound alike -- do they? Could Adatish somehow mean \"gathered,\" apparently the meaning of the Hebrew name?</p>\n\n<p>And what of the remaining names?</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Lulianus</strong>\nAccording to Jastrow, Lulianus is a Latin nickname for Julius. Assuming that the J of Julius had a Y sound, perhaps it was perceived as similar to a Hebrew name with an initial Y, like Yehudah and Yoiseif. Those names are already paired, but perhaps one of them actually had two code words? </p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Binyomin/Alexander</strong>\nAll the books pair Binyomin to Alexander. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> explains that the name Alexander means \"Defender of the people,\"  \"Defending men\" or \"Protector of men.\"</p>\n\n<p>I don't see any Hebrew name on the list with that meaning; and I don't see any that sounds like Alexander, either. Binyomin has several senses amongst the Rishoinim. My hunch is that both names were taken to mean “Southerner,” partly because of the Egyptian city Alexandria, which is south of Israel and Bavel.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/233To.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/233To.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So to restate: I'm asking for historical evidence or logical reason to suppose that Jews in the world of Chazal used particular foreign names as the translation of certain Hebrew names (whether names mentioned here or any others).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for, but Prof. Yehoshua Meir Grintz wrote in his essay in Hebrew \"The long road home of the last of the Chashmonaim\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Matityah bar Yehudah is the Jewish name of Antigonos son of Aristobulos which is in Greek. In that form came Antigonos's name on his coins: Matityah Kohen gadol and friend of the Jews in contrast to \"Basilianus Antigono\" on the other side, in Greek. On the other hand, Yehudah is the the Jewish twin of the name Aristobulos in Greek, as we know from the name of Aristobulos II, son of Yochanan Hyrcanus, in the book of Josephus (Antiquities 20, 240-241) and from his coins, and if the hypothesis of the coin researcher Meshorer is correct, then so too Aristobulos II, father of Antigonos, was called on coins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to Prof. Grintz, Antigonos=Matityah and Aristobulos=Yehudah.</p>\n<p>Near as I can tell, there isn't an etymological connection between the two pairs of names (from a google search, Antigonos means \"like [an] ancestor\", while Matityah likely means \"gift from Hashem\"; Aristobulos means \"best intention\" or \"best counsel\" while Yehudah comes from giving thanks to Hashem), so I don't have any idea at the moment as to why Jews would associate these names with each other.</p>\n\n\n",

Just as the meraglim used the final part of their being, to destroy their complete existence, so to did the tongue reach to the beginning of their existence to show that they had become completely corrupt.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ben Yehoyada</em> connects the navel to Eretz Yisrael (<em>Sanhedrin 37a</em>) as the navel of the world.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They sinned with their tongues, i.e. by speaking slander; therefore,\n  their punishment came via their tongues (<em>Rashi</em> to the verse;\n  <em>Maharsha</em>).</p>\n  \n  <p><em>Maharal (Chidushei Aggados)</em> explains why this unusual punishment was appropriate for the spies. The navel is the place from which life\n  begins (see below, 45b). The tongue, as the organ of speech, sets Man\n  apart from other creatures; it thus represents the <em>completion</em> of\n  Man. Maggots represent corruption and decay. The stretching of the\n  tongue to the navel, and the passage of maggots between them,\n  signified that the corruption of the spies encompassed them fully.\n  They had become completely evil, from beginning to end, root and\n  branch (see there for two other explanations; see also <em>Gur Aryeh</em> to\n  the verse).</p>\n  \n  <p>Alternatively, since Eretz Yisrael, is considered the center, or\n  <em>navel</em> of the world (see <em>Sanhedrin 37a</em>), it is fitting that those who spoke against Eretz Yisrael be punished via their navels (<em>Ben\n  Yehoyada</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Essentially, the spies did this intentionally so that they could speak badly about the land, namely, that this was the only fruit that the land produces.</p>\n\n<p>(My thoughts, here:) This explanation is confirmed by what they said in the end of <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=164\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse 27</a> by saying \"...this is its fruit\", meaning \"its <strong>only</strong> fruit\".

You shall be courageous and take from the fruit of the land.\" It was the season when the first grapes begin to ripen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I discuss a related issue (why point to the ripening of the grapes if they also bring pomegranates and figs) in a blog post, <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2015/06/shelach-why-specifically-ripening-of.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, where I point to a chart from Agriculture in Iron Age Israel (Oded Borowski, 1987, page 7), which tries to fix the seasons in Ancient Israel on the basis of harvesting in modern Israel, under the theory that the climate in the same geographical location would be the same across eras:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/e7ntZ.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/e7ntZ.gif\" alt=\"table of harvest times of various produce in Israel\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This would address @DoubleAA's question / comment on @Ezra's answer, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If none were in season, then why did they bring pomegranates with the grapes?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart, figs and pomegranates were not yet ripe, but were almost there, and could be brought by the scouts to a waiting Hebrew populace eager to sample the fruits of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Olives only ripened months later.

This prefix means taking a part of something bigger while leaving something else behind. We find this in many places in Chumash. An example of this is also in Parshas Shelach 15:21 where the Pasuk says <strong>מ</strong>ראשית עריסתיכם. See Rashi <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=189&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> where he says it means to take Challah from <strong>part</strong> of the first dough but not the entire first dough.\nAnother place we find this concept is in the beginning of Varikra Perek 1 verse 2 where Rashi infers from the prefix <strong>from</strong> that it's to the exclusion of something else. There are other places this is true as well, such as by the Mitzva of Bikurrim in Devorim 26:2. See Rashi there.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, since Moshe Rabbeinu said to take <strong>from</strong> the fruit of the land and not from the entire fruit of the land, they didn't take from all 7 species. </p>\n\n\n",

But when they were about to enter the Land, is it not written\n  that, “the children of Reuben had much cattle” (Num. 32:1)? The answer\n  is that they were seeking a pretext. — [Sifrei Beha’alothecha 1:42:4]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is to say, they did not lack anything in themselves but they pretended to have a lack because they did not want to actually have to work for what they received or even have to go out and collect the manna. Additionally they did not want to have to <em>imagine</em> what taste the manna should have, but as said in verse 5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt free of charge, the\n  cucumbers, the watermelons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>which we ate in Egypt free of charge:</strong> If you say that the Egyptians gave them fish free of charge, does it not already say,\n  “Straw shall not be given to you” (Exod. 5:18)?

This was the \"puzzle\" of many commentators on Moses's question to G-d in Bemidbar 11:22 when he asks G-d, essentially, \"How will you feed 600,00 people with meat and fish for a month?\" The commentators are puzzled as to why Moses would wonder about G-d's abilities?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=135\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim</a> commentary (beginning near the bottom right column on the page) explains that the question wasn't a \"wonder\". He was trying to convince G-d that His solution would not help. Exactly as you said in your question - they had plenty of meat available, and the man certainly sufficed for the rest. But, the people were spoiled and wanted and endless supply of different kinds of meat and different kinds of fish. And each person has different tastes and preferences. Some want deer, some want rams, some want beef, some want birds, and some want fish. Yet, G-d said that that he would satisfy them with eating only one type of meat for a month.</p>\n\n<p>(Seforno commentary explains this in simpler terms. Moses was saying that these people are not complaining about the lack of food. They are finding a pretext to complain about something, namely that they want a LOT of food and they want more and more of it. And, even if G-d provided enough, they would still complain, because they would want even more.) </p>\n\n<p>Regarding your 2nd question \"having the manna taste like meat\", see Bemidbar 11:6 where they specifically complain that the man isn't doing the job for them.</p>\n\n\n",

What do you do about everything that comes after <em>shaḥarit</em> besides the <em>musaf</em> prayer itself?</p>\n\n<p>I see two main possibilities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You should not deviate from the usual order of the prayer service. You should stop at some point (<strong>where?</strong>) after <em>shaḥarit</em>, and continue from that point (without repeating anything) when about to pray <em>musaf</em>.  Motivation for this choice: this is how the service \"normally goes\".</li>\n<li>You should finish the prayer service as you would normally do, omitting <em>musaf</em>, and pray <em>musaf</em> (and only <em>musaf</em>) later. Motivation for this choice: most of the post-<em>shaḥarit</em> elements are also said on a day without <em>musaf</em>, so why should we omit them now?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Or perhaps some middle ground, where you still finish the service (whatever that means), but omit more than just <em>musaf</em> (say, <em>ein keloheinu</em> on <em>shabbat</em>, or <em>hosha'not</em> on <em>sukkot</em>), or perhaps where you repeat certain sections when praying <em>musaf</em> (eg. say <em>ashrei</em> again).</p>\n\n<p>Does the answer change depending on how long the gap is between <em>shaḥarit</em> and <em>musaf</em>? Does the answer change depending on what the day is (<em>shabbat</em>, <em>yom tov</em>, <em>rosh ḥodesh</em>, <em>ḥol hammo'ed</em>)?</p>\n\n\n",

Verse 15 says, in part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חֻקַּת עוֹלָם לְדֹרֹתֵיכֶם כָּכֶם כַּגֵּר יִהְיֶה לִפְנֵי ה׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pretty literally:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An eternal law for your generations; like you like the stranger shall be before God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> explains that last part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ככם כגר</strong> ― כמותכם כן גר וכן דרך לשון עברית כגן ה׳ כארץ מצרים כן ארץ מצרים כמוני כמוך כעמי כעמך</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>like you like the stranger</strong> ― [means] \"like you, so is the stranger\". That's the way of Hebrew, [as in] \"כגן ה׳ כארץ מצרים\", [literally \"like the garden of God like the land of Egypt\", means \"like the garden of God,] so is the land of Egypt[\". Likewise,] \"כמוני כמוך כעמי כעמך\", [literally \"like me, like you, like my nation, like your nation\", means \"like me, so are you; like my nation, so is your nation\".]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first quotation in <em>Rashi</em>, \"כגן ה׳ כארץ מצרים\", is from <a href=\"//he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%92_%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Lech L'cha</em> 13:10</a>. (The second is from Ⅰ <em>Melachim</em> 22:4, by the way.) The problem is that <em>Rashi</em>'s explanation here in <em>Sh'lach</em> doesn't really fit the verse there in <em>Lech L'cha</em>, and, especially, doesn't fit with his own explanation there. The verse there says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּשָּׂא לוֹט אֶת עֵינָיו וַיַּרְא אֶת כָּל כִּכַּר הַיַּרְדֵּן כִּי כֻלָּהּ מַשְׁקֶה לִפְנֵי שַׁחֵת ה׳ אֶת סְדֹם וְאֶת עֲמֹרָה כְּגַן ה׳ כְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם בֹּאֲכָה צֹעַר</p>\n  \n  <p>Lot looked up and saw the whole Jordan plain, that it was all moist, before God's destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, like God's garden like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, interpreting \"כְּגַן ה׳ כְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם\" as \"like God's garden, so is Egypt\" doesn't seem to make sense, since we're trying to describe not Egypt but the Jordan plain. And, indeed, <em>Rashi</em> interprets both \"כְּגַן ה׳\" and \"כְּאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם\" as comparisons to the Jordan plain, not to one another. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>כגן ה׳</strong> ― לאילנות<br>\n  <strong>כארץ מצרים</strong> ― לזרעים</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>like God's garden</strong> ― for trees<br>\n  <strong>like the land of Egypt</strong> ― for seeds</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why does <em>Rashi</em> cite that verse in <em>Lech L'cha</em> as an example of the linguistic phenomenon he's describing in <em>Sh'lach</em>? It isn't one, according to him.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I've looked in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40160&pgnum=531\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mizrachi</em></a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24855&pgnum=155\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>L'vush</em></a>, and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30845&pgnum=46\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Gur Arye</em></a> to no avail, so turn to you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The citation from Lech Lecha is referring to the idea that the valley around Sodom and Gomorrah, which is called HaShem's Garden, was irrigated from the river like the man made irrigation system used in Egypt.

Rashi quotes this Targum both ad loc. and on the 13 Attributes: כשאוחזים מעשה אבותיהם בידיהם.</p>\n\n<p>Although Rashi in Shelach does not quote this distinction, I believe it can be understood the same way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In his commentary to a similar verse in <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0220.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 20:4-5</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> explains that the punishment that God inflicts on children for the sins of their fathers is not a direct punishment, but it is a natural consequence. He explains this by giving an example wherein the fathers commit a sin which earns them the punishment of being exiled among the nations. Their children will thus be born into exile – not because God is \"punishing\" them, but because that is simply the natural state of affairs. If your parents are in exile then you will <em>nolens volens</em> be born in exile. If the children manage to attain high levels of perfection it is possible that God will intervene and rescue them from exile, but if they merely refrain from doing bad things that won't be enough to stimulate a Divine intervention.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, what the verse means when it says that children are punished for their fathers's sins is that the fathers' sins will indirectly cause the children's suffering, but not that God specifically exacts retribution on the children for sins that they haven't committed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה יסופק בזה המאמר ספק חזק  והוא  איך יתכן שיענוש ה' יתעלה בני החוטא  והנה אין להם אשם בחטא אביהם  ואנחנו מתירין זה הספק בזה האופן  והוא  שהעונש יביא ה' יתעלה לעוברים על דבריו  אם על צד ההשגחה על דרך התוכחת  אם על צד סור ההשגחה שיחולו עליהם הרעות הנכונות לבוא עליהם מצד המערכת  וכבר יהיו אלו הרעות באופן שיגיע בהם רע לזרעם לא היה מגיע להם לולא חטא אבותיהם  והמשל  כי כאשר מרו אבותינו חוייב להם מהעונש שיגלו בין האומות ויירשו גוים ארצם  והנה נמשך לזרעם אחריהם הגלות הזה בסיבת המצאם גולים בהולדם  עד שלא יתכן שימלטו מזה הרע אם לא בהיותם יוצאים ממנו על צד המערכת  או בשיהיו בתכלית השלמות שיתכן שיוציאם ה' יתעלה מהארצות אשר הדיחם שם על דרך המופת  ובזה האופן היה מה שאמר הנביא  אבֹתינו חטאו ואינם ואנחנו עונֹתיהם סבלנו וזה  שאם לא חטאו אבותינו היינו אנחנו נמצאים בארץ  ולא נצא ממנה אם לא בשנעשה מהפעולות המגונות מה שנתחייב עליהם כמו זה העונש  ואולם כשנמצאנו בגלות בחטא אבותינו  הנה לא יספיק לנו לשוב שם ההשמר מהפעולות המגונות  אבל יצטרך לנו שנקנה מהשלמות מה שנהיה בו דבקים בה' יתעלה באופן שיוציאנו מהגלות הזה על צד ההשגחה הנפלאה  ובזה האופן לא יהיה עוול אם יגיע עונש לבנים בעבור חטא אביהם  כי הוא במקרה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ralbag further notes that the Sages resolve the difficulty in a different manner, by asserting that God punishes children for the sins of their fathers when the children continue in the sinful ways. Ralbag agrees that this is true and explains it as follows: the punishment of God intended as a rebuke varies according to the severity of the sin. If someone merely did their own sin than a lesser rebuke would suffice to snap them out of it. But when children are entrenched in the sinful ways of their fathers it is much harder to return them to the straight path, and therefore  a greater rebuke is necessary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואולם רבותינו ז\"ל התירו זה הספק באופן אחר  וזה  שהם אמרו שה' יתעלה הוא פוקד עוון אבות על בנים כאשר יהיו הבנים אוחזים מעשה אבותיהם בידיהם  והוא בלי ספק מאמר אמיתי  כמו שביארנו ברביעי מספר מלחמות ה' וזה  כי הרע המסודר מה' יתעלה על צד התוכחת יהיה לפי המרי  רוצה לומר שמי שהסתבך במרי סיבוך מועט   תספיק לו תוכחת מעוטה  ומי שהחזיק בו באופן ששב לו קנין חזק   יצטרך לתוכחת יותר עצומה  ובהיות הענין כן  הנה כאשר חטא האדם לבדו   תספיק לו תוכחת יותר מעוטה מהתוכחת אשר תצטרך לו אם היה מחזיק אביו בזאת התכונה והיה הוא אוחז מעשה אבותיו  כי אז נסתבך בזה המרי סיבוך יותר חזק  ובזה האופן אמרה התורה  ואף בעונת אבתם אתם ימקו והנה מה שאמרנוהו בזה הוא יותר נאות לפי הפשט </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ralbag also discusses this extensively in Milchamot Hashem 4:6.</p>\n\n\n",

In the new printing there are tons of footnotes with sources. Read the first essay. \nIn very short the idea is, the only purpose of any endeavor is for a profit. Now hashem was doing pretty well before he created the world. So why would he do so? In order to have a \"separate\" being with its own opinions and yet be totally dedicated to hashem. The spirit world is too subservient by nature (or force, it's complicated) so this can't be where the purpose lies. Only the physical world feeling itself to be totally self sufficient (mirroring hashems true self sufficiency) fits hashems criteria. As well The soul before it came into this world as well was totally pure holy... so what gain would the soul have from this world? Moahiach when the true purpose and perfection of the physical world will be revealed. So to just live in an insular world, spend all day learning Torah would be very \"holy\" it would not accomplish hashems purpose in creating the world. </p>\n\n\n",

This being said, is it permissible to read the works from the Apocrypha? Is this any worse than reading secular fiction or would this be compared to learning from another religion?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sub><sup>1</sup> by which I mean books considered to be included in tanach but were rejected</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There is one place in the Talmud where Rabbi Akiva states that it is heretical to read from the \"outside works\"; this was understood by some to refer to the apocrypha.  Yet he may have been referring to other books, possibly even some of the books that later become part of the Tanakh [Hebrew Bible]  For more details consult the Encyclopedia Judaica's section on \"Apocrypha\".</p>\n\n<p>In either reading, his view was not accepted as law, and many other sages of the Talmud and midrash felt free to read and discuss the works of the apocrypha, especially the Wisdom of Ben Sira [aka Ecclesiasticus] and Maccabees.   Note that even one of Judaism's most beloved holidays, Chanukah, is based on the events described in I and II Maccabees. For some examples of rabbinic discussions of apocryphal works, see the following rabbinic sources:</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Yerushalmi: Hagigah 2;1, 47C; Berakhot 7:2, 11b </p>\n\n<p>Talmud Bavli: Hagigah 12b, 13a; Berakhot 48a; Shabbat 21b; Yevamot 63b, Ketubot 110b, Bava Batra 98b</p>\n\n<p>Midrash: Genesis Rabbah 91:3,</p>\n\n<p>Responsa of the Rishonim:  Tosfot Eruvin 65b;  Ritva Eruvin 65a; Rashba Eruvin 65a; Meiri Nidda 16b</p>\n\n<p>Nahmanides quotes \"The Wisdom of Solomon in the introduction to his commentary on the Torah.  \"The Wisdom of Solomon\" is also cited in \"Livnat HaSapir\", a Torah commentary attributed to David ben Judah HeHasid.  The midrash collection \"Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer\" makes use of the apocrypha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Sanhedrin (100b) explains that the Mishna refers to ספרי מינים, and that this is what the Chazal mean by ספרים חיצונים. R Yosef adds that Ben Sira is included in this prohibition, though it is unclear why it was banned (the gemara itself seems to ban it on the grounds that it contains folly and that reading it is a waste of time. However note that the quotations the gemara brings from Ben Sira to discredit the entire book (Sanhedrin ibid זלדקן קורטמן) are not found in our version of the Ben Sira. Some hold that the book of Ben Sira the Chazal were talking about was a corrupted version of the original one we have nowadays. Proof to this theory is that they are quoted in Aramaic whereas Ben Sira was written in Hebrew. If this is true our Ben Sira would not be problematic anyways, since it doesn't contain any folly, only words of wisdom). </p>\n\n<p>It would seem that according to the Gemara <strong>there is no problem with the Apocrypha, only with sifrei minim which include books that promote a certain Atheistic/Paganistic ideology</strong> (according to some even books on Christian ideology are banned). The only exception is Ben Sira which is explicitly prohibited by R Yosef (however see R Yosef's other statement that the good parts of the book may be publicized during one's lecture). Also see Tiferes Yisroel (ibid) that even Ben Sira is not problematic as long as its not read on regular basis (דרך קבע). The Ritva (Bava Basra 98b) seems to concur with this psak. </p>\n\n<p>(It is possible that the reason Ben Sira was prohibited [to read regularly], is because Chazal were worried it would enter the Jewish canon and become part of the holy scripture [Tanach]. In order to ensure that Ben Sira does not get the same respect as the other holy books, Chazal banned it [see Niddah 16b, Eiruvin 65a and Tosfos there. It seems like Chazal were well versed in Ben Sira and sometimes even learnt Halachos from it]. \nIn Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 11:1 we even find that the books of Ben Sira are worse than the books of Homer! This seems to be the only rational explanation as to why Chazal would be harsher with Ben Sira than with the Iliad).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In a lecture from Rabbi Ari Lamm (which I cannot currently find on yutorah.org) he explains that the gemarah is discussing reading in order to influence one's religious practice. </p>\n\n\n",

Thus we believe in the Creation, and yet need not\n  inquire what purpose is served by each species of the existing things,\n  because we assume that God created all parts of the Universe by His\n  will; some for their own sake, and some for the sake of other beings,\n  that include their own purpose in themselves.</p>\n  \n  <p>Maimonides, Moses.

The only exception to this rule are plants to which he clearly states (in the same chapter) that they only exist to serve the animals (since they cannot live without it). But since the animals are not included in this list, it is reasonable to assume that they too exist for their own sake (since they are all part of the universe. Am i being too analytical here?), thus contradicting what he wrote in his commentary to Mishnayot!</p>\n\n<p>How do we reconcile these contradictory sayings?   </p>\n\n\n",

If one can hold his hand on the roof longer than fifteen seconds, the microwave does not absorb, and therefore you can use one microwave for chametz and kosher for Pesach.<sup>The footnote</sup></p>\n\n<p>Is that measure not subjective? Let's say that my roommate has a higher heat tolerance than I do. The microwave is treif for me but kosher for him, because I can't hold my hand on for the requisite amount of time, but he can? It's for that reason that R' Moshe (OC 4:74) ruled that yad soledes bo is at least 110 degrees Fahrenheit, but certainly at least 160. It needs to be an objective measure, or else you can run into issues like this. How, then, can the Star-K pasken that one may simply place one's hand on the roof of the microwave and see how long he can hold it there?</p>\n\n<p>I have tried reaching out to the Star-K directly for an answer, but being that I have never heard back in any of my attempts I thought I would try my luck here. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To respond to comments regarding whether this is true of kashering microwaves for anything besides Pesach: First of all, if it absorbs, it absorbs, and if it doesn't, it doesn't. We don't say that it absorbs regarding ordinary kashrus but not regarding Pesach. Second, for those who still wish to argue, here is a quote from an email in a separate discussion with the Star-K:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are differences of opinion as to how to kasher microwaves.

Is it 15 on each side, or 30 in each foot and hand? See also #2. Note that in a human adult there are 13 carpal bones and 12 tarsal bones in each hand and foot in an adult. </li>\n<li>How are these 6 counted? Is it 6 in each individual toe, and would perforce be counting tarsals along with metatarsals, or carpals along with metacarpals? Or perhaps it means there are 6 in each <em>type</em> of toe, i.e., 3 in each toe and finger? In the former case, we are forced to use the feet and hands as a part of the respective fingers they branch into. Where does that leave us with the 30 mentioned earlier? Is the Mishnah to be read \"30 in the foot, which are part of the six in each toe\"? In the latter case, perhaps one should read the Mishnah \"30 in the foot which are six in each toe\"?</li>\n<li>The first question from #1 still stands for all of these - are they counted on one side of the body, or both? Some of these numbers aren't even, which leads me to believe it's referring to each side individually, but see #6 below. </li>\n<li>The above question gets slightly tweaked regarding the ribs. Are they considered one all the way around, or two? Which ultimately still comes down to, \"are there 13 ribs or 26\"?</li>\n<li>What are these vertebrae referring to? In an adult, there are <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column#structure\" rel=\"noreferrer\">26 vertebrae</a>, not 18. Further, 9+8+6+5 is much more than either 18 or even 26. Perhaps these are not meant to be a sublist, but rather a list unto themselves? That is, 18 vertebrae <em>plus</em> nine bones in the neck <em>plus</em> eight in the head, etc. With this reading, Chazal probably saw the 12 thoracic vertebrae, the 5 lumbar vertebrae, and the sacrum/coccyx as the 18 vertebrae, but that doesn't leave enough vertebrae for the other numbers: there are only 7 cervical vertebrae, yet the Mishnah lists 8 in the neck. Maybe it counts the base of the skull as a cervical vertebra? Further, what are the other three items? Calling the skull 9 bones for 9 in the head is doable, but where are the 6 and 5?</li>\n<li>The biggest problem of all in the Mishnah: What I see as the straightforward reading - 101 on each side plus 18 in the middle - makes only 220 bones. As far as I'm aware, 220 is less than 248. So what happened to the other 28? Further, still keeping with the way I have presented the Mishnah above, just the fingers and toes, at 6 apiece, gives 120, much more than 101 off the bat. Yet if you count them to both sides, you're left with half-bones to each side (see #3)!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Before this gets closed as too broad, I would just like to point out that for the purposes of this question, you don't need to address all of my points as above, though it would greatly improve the answer if it did. All I am asking is: <strong>Given that the list, as presented, does not seem to make intuitive, anatomical, or mathematical sense, how, indeed, are the 248 bones counted?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the final list comes out to be incompatible with modern anatomy to a degree that Chazal are making up bones, that will warrant an additional question at that time.</p>\n\n<p>I hope I've made my objections to the Mishnah clear.

If he were to say the Shema while he was standing, would he not be going against the words of Beis Shammai?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The basic halacha in disputes between Bais Hillel and Bais Shammai is according to Bais Hillel as we see in Eruvin 13b. The point is that he stopped and lay down (putting himself in saccanah) when he did not have to.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R'Abba stated in the name of Samuel: For three years there was a\n  dispute between Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel, the former asserting,\n  'The halachah is in agreement with our views' and the latter\n  contending, 'The halachah is in agreement with our views'. Then a bath\n  kol issued announcing, '[The utterances of] both are the words of the\n  living God, but the halachah is in agreement with the rulings of Beth\n  Hillel'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2013/05/why-halacha-is-like-beis-hillel.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">why halacha is like Beis Hillel </a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It sounds at first glance like this is some kind of mystical segulah,\n  that if you have good midos the schar is that you will hit the mark in\n  psak halacha.  I saw R’ Zalman Nechemya Goldberg explains it\n  differently. We know the general rule of thumb in psak is “hilchisa\n  k’basra’ah,” the halacha usually follows a later authority over an\n  earlier one.  This is because if you approach an issue after the fact,\n  you have the advantage of hindsight and can better weigh the different\n  options.  The halacha follows Beis Hillel because they reviewed Beis\n  Shamai’s opinion first; they first considered the counter-argument\n  carefully before arriving at their own view.  Therefore, their opinion\n  was always the “basra’ah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are only certain definite halachos in which Bais Shamai was accepted instead of Bais Hillel as we see at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77932/when-is-the-halacha-like-bais-shammai-and-not-bais-hillel\">when is the halacha like Bais Shammai and not Bais Hillel?</a></p>\n\n<p>This halacha was not one of those cases. Since the Halacha had been already determined, Rabbi Tarfon should not have followed Bais Shamai. Had the machlokes still been ongoing, then he would have been able to respond that he was following a valid psak and would not have been in danger. Since he did not have to lie down, doing so is a statement that he is going against the psak halacha, which puts him in danger.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the Mesilat Yesharim the pshat of our Gemara is linked to the fact that, at a certain point of our history, the existing of Tora did depend on a clear decision that everyone needs to follow Bet Hillel.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara quoted below in Yebamot illustrates that this point. The assertion of the Mesilat Yesharim wasn't clearly admitted by Rabbi Tarfon, at the time of his statement quoted in Yebamot. Following the first version, as a Bet Shammai talmid, he wanted to show that he follows Bet Shammai, even if this leads to mamzerut according to Bet Hillel. Following the second version, despite he was a Bet Shammai talmid, he wanted to show that now the halacha was definitely ruled as Bet Hillel despite that following Bet Shammai this is a yebama lashuk. This last version is congruent to the Gemara's conclusion in Berachot. The behavior of Rabbi Tarfon in Berachot was to be quite following the both shitot in keriat shema.</p>\n\n<p>Contextualization: There is a mahloket Bet Shamai - Bet Hillel about ptor from Yebum for tsarat erva if she is exempt and can marry a stranger, or needs Ybum/Halitsa by the Yabam the Mishna and Gemara analyses various problems regarding machlokets between BS and BH.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemara Yebamot 15a:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ש דא\"ר טרפון תאבני מתי תבא צרת הבת לידי ואשאנה אימא ואשיאנה</p>\n  \n  <p> Come and hear: Rabbi Tarfon said: Would that the rival of [my] daughter  were to fall to my lot so that I could marry her! - Read, 'that I could make her marry [another]'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong> explains that Rabbi Tarfon was a pupil of Bet Shammai. There are two options to decifer his statement. The first: he did want to show that he rules as Bet Shammai. The second: He did want to show that the halacha finally pasked following Bet Hillel.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>רבי טרפון</strong>\n    - מתלמידי ב\"ש היה: <strong>מתי תבא צרת הבת</strong> - מאחי לידי: <strong>ואשאנה</strong>  - אייבם אותה כדברי ב\"ש: <strong>ואשיאנה</strong>  - לשוק כדברי ב\"ה:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>About the Gemara Berachot, See  Mesilat Yesharim chapter 20.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומעשה דרבי טרפון יוכיח (ברכות י, ב)שהחמיר להטות כבית שמאי ואמרו לו כדאי היית לחוב בעצמך שעברת על דברי בית הלל, אף על פי שמחמיר היה, וזה שענין מחלוקת בית שמאי ובית הלל היה ענין כבד לישראל מפני המחלוקת הגדולה שרבתה ביניהם, וסוף סוף נגמר שהלכה כבית הלל לעולם, הנה קיומה של תורה שגמר דין זה ישאר בכל תוקף לעד ולעולמי עולמים ולא יחלש בשום פנים שלא תעשה תורה חס ושלום כשני תורות, ועל כן לדעת המשנה הזאת יותר חסידות הוא להחזיק כבית הלל אפילו לקולא מלהחמיר כבית שמאי.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The episode of R. Tarfon (Berachoth 10b) substantiates what has been said. Although he took \n  upon himself the more stringent decision of Beth Shammai, he was told, \"You would rightly have \n  been accounted the cause of your own death, for you violated the words of Beth Hillel.\" All this \n  because the controversy between Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel had become an area of difficulty \n  to Israel in view of the great contention that had grown up between them; and after it had finally \n  been ruled that the law should constantly be decided in accordance with Beth Hillel it was \n  essential for the very endurance of Torah that this ruling forever retain its force and not be \n  weakened in any way lest the Torah come to take on the semblance of two Torahs (G-d forbid). \n  Hence, the view of this Mishnah that it is Saintlier to hold with Beth Hillel even when more \n  lenient, than to be more stringent in accordance with Beth Shammai. This should serve us as a \n  guide to perceive the path where light resides with truth and faith for the doing of what is just in \n  the eyes of G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The flood somehow ruined the atmosphere and the people became weaker and the lifespan was shortened. After the Haflagah the lifespan became even shorter due to the excessive change in the atmosphere. He discredits the Rambam's understanding that not everyone (in the beginning) lived so long, only those mentioned in the Torah lived longer than others because they ate healthy diet (Rambam's altrnative: it was a miraculous phenomenon).  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kesubah when wife predeceases\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why is there no kesubah payment when the wife dies first.  Is it because it does not apply or is it because the husband is the only heir of his wife and he, therefore, inherits all her assets including her kesubah liens.  In other words, he was holding the kesubah money for her as a debt and now that the debtor has died he owes it to himself</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The kesubah is an agreement made, see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/477336/jewish/The-Ketubah-Marriage-Contract.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“which details the husband's obligations to his wife, showing that\n  marriage is more than a physical-spiritual union; it is a legal and\n  moral commitment. The ketubah states the principal obligations of the\n  groom to provide his wife with food, clothing and affection along with\n  other contractual obligations.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yMpyWEuUwDkJ:www.jewfaq.org/marriage.htm+&cd=13&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk&client=firefox-b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This site</a> also refers to the kesubah and says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The ketubah spells out the husband's obligations to the wife during\n  marriage, conditions of inheritance upon his death, and obligations\n  regarding the support of children of the marriage. It also provides\n  for the wife's support in the event of divorce.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that the  kesubah lists the obligations of the husband to the wife. The kesubah is payable on the death of the husband or upon divorce.  These obligations cease upon her death. So the kesubah ceases to have force after her death or as you put it “it does not apply”. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <em>gemara</em> contains the concept of כתובת בנין דוכרין, where in the case of the wife dying before the husband, the <em>kesuba</em> payout is to be remitted to the sons of that wife, rather than the man's sons from a different wife.</p>\n\n<p>This wording is not present in modern <em>kesubos</em>, as far as I know (although I seem to recall hearing that Yemenite <em>kesubot</em> do retain that phrase).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There's a lien created for the kesubah from when they're married which seems to suggest that he's already incurred an obligation albeit not payable until he ends the marriage (either via divorce or death).</p>\n<p>It is possibly payment for her besulim (see <a href=\"https://musingsonthetorah.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-value-of-womans-virginity.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) which she holds as a debt until he dissolves the marriage.</p>\n<p>According to the foregoing even when she predeceases him he's obligated to pay it but it happens to be that he inherits it back as her yoresh.</p>\n<p>Before a husband inherited a wife (if one holds that yerushas habaal is mdrabanan) it would have been payable to her yorshim.</p>\n<p>Even nowadays there are ways to opt out of yerushas habaal (Rambam, Ishut 23) with her yorshim inheriting.</p>\n<p>This question now takes on real world significance: if one assumes that the husband isn't obligated unless he ends the marriage then he would not be obligated in her kesubah if the marriage ends with her death, whereas if he's obligated in all cases it is just that he inherits her then he would indeed be required to pay the kesubah to her heirs.</p>\n<p>Should someone have a source regarding the halacha in this scenario it would speak to the core question as well.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I would just like to clarify with regard to the discussion between Ethan and Meir that there is an explicit disagreement amongst the tannaim (e.g. bavli kesubos 10a) regarding if the kesubah is biblical (a \"mohar\" payment) or rabbinic with the stated rabbinic reason as Ethan wrote. The fact that a lien is created from nissuin and that the kesubah is payable even when the husband dies would seem to come down on the side of it being biblical and yet the fact is that even those that hold that it is rabbinic agree with those halachos. Bpashtus the question should be dependent on if it is min hatorah or not. What I wrote works much better with kesubah being min hatorah.</p>\n\n\n",

As sabbalhillel already pointed out, there was no curse on Ham, but on a very specific nation called Canaan. But i disagree with his statement that the curse was not upon a specific nation; indeed there was a curse upon the Canaanites, but on the Canaanites only (that lived in the middle east)!</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban (Breishis 10:26) explains that the Torah here is justifying the mitzvah of conquering Israel. The moral of the story is that since Canaan messed up (7 nations: Canaan) his children became our slaves and subordinate to us (semites), thus we by divine rule must rule over them. The Torah is surely not saying anything about the entire black race (This is my take, not the Ramban's). The Torah never endorses this view, and never implies that the Egyptians or other African nations are cursed, or that their enslavement should be propogated; this idea/concept was invented much later, and has no biblical or Jewish basis. (but of course those who believe in the enslavement of the blacks will always use the Torah as evidence to support their claims).</p>\n\n\n",

Sephardic practice is to make whichever blessing is suitable to this particular spice; Ashkenazic practice is to say the all-purpose \"borei minei besamim\" on anything, to avoid confusing people. The Mishna Brurah recommends as an extra stringency to therefore purposely pick something whose weekday blessing is always \"minei besamim.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: That would leave Ashkenazim with a very slight preference to use cloves, musk, or potpourri rather than coffee, but it would still certainly be acceptable, and its bracha during Havdalah would be the usual <em>borei minei besamim.</em> A Sephardic Jew using coffee for Havdalah would recite <em>hanotein rei'ach tov bapeirot</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Some secular historians would say the captivity lasted from 605 BCE to 537 BCE. That would make 68 solar years, but that's 70 lunar years, or 841 lunar months. Maybe the Israelites at the time added an occasional leap month into their civil calendar, but maybe they also viewed a year as being twelve months.

In the case of Eisav that you mention, this speed was still not the appropriate reaction, since Chushim son of Dan was able to act in a more appropriate manner to short circuit the <em>lawfare</em> that Eisav attempted to use to prevent the burial of Yaakov.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The prompt for the question appears to be the pasuk in parashat Vaychi, that is, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8244#v=21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 49:21</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נַפְתָּלִי אַיָּלָה שְׁלֻחָה הַנֹּתֵן אִמְרֵי שָׁפֶר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea that this refers to extreme swiftness of the person Naftali can be found in a midrash appearing in <a href=\"https://halakhah.com/sotah/sotah_13.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 13a</a>, and the first part of the midrash is cited by Rashi on the pasuk. The gemara reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They replied to him, 'The document is in the land of Egypt. Who will go for it? Let Naphtali go, because he is swift as a hind'; for it is written: Naphtali is a hind let loose, he giveth goodly words10  — R. Abbahu said: Read not 'goodly words' (imre shefer) but imre sefer (words of a document). Among those present was Hushim, a son of Dan, who was hard of hearing; so he asked them, 'What is happening?' They said to him, '[Esau] is preventing (the burial) until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt'. He retorted: 'Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt!' He took a club and struck (Esau) on the head so that his eyes fell out and rolled to the feet of Jacob. Jacob opened his eyes and laughed; and that is what is written: The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, the words of the blessing to Naftali are interpreted, out of context, to mean:</p>\n<p>נַפְתָּלִי אַיָּלָה שְׁלֻחָה = Naftali is very fast\nהַנֹּתֵן אִמְרֵי שָׁפֶר = he will bring the words of the scroll</p>\n<p>Nothing in this midrash indicates that Yaakov miraculously granted Naftali super speed with his blessing. Rather, the brothers, using Yaakov's words, are saying that Naftali is very swift, and therefore, he should bring the scroll.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the other midrash, about the confrontation with Yosef, also based on the words נַפְתָּלִי אַיָּלָה שְׁלֻחָה, describes Naftali as very swift. This was not a result of Yaakov's blessing, for it occurred well before Yaakov's blessing. And other descendants of Yaakov, in that midrash, have other superpowers. For instance, the ability to shout and shatter all the teeth of the Egyptians; to roar and have chest hairs pierce through one's shirt like iron nails; to kick a boulder and have it shatter; to restrain Shimon.</p>\n<p>If so, the easy answer is that Yaakov gave him that <strong>descriptive</strong> blessing because, of the various brothers, he in fact possessed that super speed.</p>\n<p>By the way, Rashi on the verse (linked above) mentions this midrash as a matter of midrash, but takes the simple peshat meaning to be that if refers either to the quality of their land inheritance or to to future events regarding the tribe of Naftali. Thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a swift gazelle: This is the valley of Gennesar, which ripens its fruits swiftly, like the gazelle, which runs swiftly. אַיָלָה שְׁלֻחָה means a gazelle that runs swiftly. — [from Gen. Rabbah 99:12]</p>\n<p>[he is one] who utters beautiful words: As the Targum renders. [See below.] Another explanation: A swift gazelle: He (Jacob) prophesied concerning the war with Sisera: “and take with you ten thousand men of the men of Naphtali, etc.” (Jud. 4:6), and they went there with alacrity. And so it is stated there with an expression of dispatching, “into the valley they rushed forth with their feet” (ibid. 5:15).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why then is making tea/coffee not considered cooking?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Daily Halacha <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=440\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Preparing Instant Coffee, Hot Chocolate and Tea on Shabbat</a> explains the reasoning behind the discussion. There are two questions involved.</p>\n<p>Instant coffee has already been <em>cooked</em> so that pouring hot water on it, is not considered bishul.</p>\n<p>Tea leaves, would be <em>cooked</em> by putting them into hot water in a kli sheini, so that one may not put a tea bag into a cup and pour hot water on it from a kli rishon or put the tea bag into hot water in a kli sheni. See the details from the citation below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Is it permissible to prepare instant coffee, hot chocolate or tea on Shabbat, by pouring hot water on the powder or tea leaves?</strong></p>\n<p>A Halachic principle establishes that when hot water is poured onto\nraw food from a “Keli Rishon,” meaning, from the original utensil in\nwhich it had been heated, it cooks the first layer of the food.\nAccordingly, it is forbidden to pour water directly from an urn or hot\nwater kettle onto raw food. Seemingly, then, it should be forbidden to\npour hot water directly from an urn or kettle onto instant coffee or\nhot chocolate powder.</p>\n<p>However, there is another Halachic principle which states that one\ndoes not violate the Shabbat prohibition of cooking by cooking a food\nthat had already been cooked previously. If a food had already been\ncooked, cooking it a second time does not constitute “cooking” as\ndefined by Halacha. Therefore, it is permissible to pour hot water\ndirectly over instant coffee or chocolate powder. All powders made for\ninstant cooking had already been cooked as part of their processing.\nWhether it’s hot chocolate powder, milk powder or baby formula, the\nprocessing of the powder entails cooking. Likewise, instant coffee has\nalready undergone a process of roasting, and cooking a food that had\nbeen roasted does not violate the Shabbat prohibition of cooking.\nTherefore, it is permissible to pour hot water directly from an urn or\nkettle onto any instant powder or instant coffee on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>This Halacha does not, however, apply to preparing tea from teabags.\nThe leaves inside the bags are raw, and had not been previously\ncooked. As such, it is forbidden to pour hot water directly from an\nurn or kettle onto a teabag. One who wishes to prepare tea on Shabbat\nmust first pour the hot water from the urn or kettle into an empty\nutensil, and then pour the water from that utensil into the teacup.\nTea leaves are classified as “Kaleh Habishul” – a food that is easily\ncooked - and therefore one may not place them in the “Keli Sheni,”\nmeaning, in a utensil into which water had been poured from an urn.\nInstead, one should pour the water from that utensil into the teacup.\nHe may place the tea leaves into the teacup and pour the water onto the\nleaves from the “Keli Sheni,” or he can pour the water into the teacup\nand then place the tea leaves in the water in the teacup.</p>\n<p>Summary: It is permissible to prepare instant coffee, hot chocolate\nand other powders by pouring hot water on the powder directly from the\nurn or kettle. To prepare tea, one must pour the water from the urn or\nkettle into a utensil, and then transfer the hot water from that\nutensil into the teacup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As hot water is transferred from one utensil into another, it is considered as having lessened the <em>strength</em> of the hot water. Pouring from one vessel into another is considered <em>less</em> than the first vessel, but <em>more</em> than the second vessel. This means that the <em>cooking</em> of the tea leaves in the bag is permitted using <em>irui kli sheni</em> and therefore permitted by placing the tea leaves directly into a kli shlishi.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/making-tea-on-shabbat-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Making Tea on Shabbat</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kalei Habishul</p>\n<p>Although the aforementioned Mishna permits placing spices in a Kli\nSheni containing hot water, the Mishna that appears on Shabbat 145b\nindicates that one may not place uncooked salted fish in a Kli Sheni\nfilled with hot water. Similarly, one opinion recorded on Shabbat 42b\nasserts that salt is unlike spices and cooks even in a Kli Sheni. This\nopinion believes that since salt is easily cooked (Kalei Habishul), it\ncan be cooked even in a Kli Sheni. The Sefer Yereim (102) believes\nthat since we are not sure which items are similar to salt and can be\ncooked in a Kli Sheni, we must be concerned that virtually any item\nmay fall into the category of Kalei Habishul. Thus, he urges that\nvirtually no food be placed in a Kli Sheni containing hot water. The\nTur (O.C. 318), however, challenges the Yereim's expansion of the\nconcern for Kalei Habishul beyond the cases specifically mentioned by\nthe Mishna and Gemara. Moreover, the concern expressed by the Yereim\nis not even alluded to by any of the great Rishonim such as the Rif,\nthe Rambam, and the Rosh.</p>\n<p>The Rama (318:5) cites the opinions of both the Yereim and the Tur. He\nnotes, however, that common practice is not to place Challah even in a\nKli Sheni due to concern that Challah is classified as Kalei Habishul.\nParenthetically, we should explain that although the Challah was\nbaked, people were concerned for the opinion of the Yereim that\nalthough we believe Ein Bishul Achar Bishul, cooking may occur after\nbaking.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berura (318:42), citing the Magen Avraham, writes that the\nstringent practice applies to all items in accordance with the view of\nthe Sefer Yereim. Thus, we must be concerned that almost all food\nitems are Kalei Habishul. The Chazon Ish (O.C. 52:19), however,\nquestions the expansion of the concern of Kalei Habishul beyond bread,\nwhich is specifically mentioned by the Rama. He suggests that perhaps\nbread is more easily cooked than other items since it was already\nbaked. The Chazon Ish, nonetheless, honors the common practice to\nfollow the stringent views of the Magen Avraham and Mishna Berura.</p>\n<p>Is Tea Classified as Kalei Habishul?</p>\n<p>The Yereim's concern applies only to items that the Mishna or Gemara\ndoes not specifically mention. The Mishna, however, specifically\nstates that spices cannot be cooked in a Kli Sheni. Accordingly, why\ndo the Mishna Berura and Aruch Hashulchan reject Rav Chaim's ruling\nthat tea is a spice and we are permitted to prepare it in a Kli Sheni?\nRav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (cited in Shmeirat Shabbat Kehilchata 1:\nnote 152) explains that the spices in the Mishna were large and\nunprocessed. Today, commercially available spices are ground very\nfinely and present a concern for Kalei Habishul. Thus, one might argue\nthat since tea leaves are incomparable to the Mishna's unprocessed\nspices, they should be classified as Kalei Habishul. Indeed, the Aruch\nHashulchan notes that it is observable that tea cooks in a Kli Sheni.</p>\n<p>The Kli Shelishi Option - Rav Moshe Feinstein vs. Aruch Hashulchan</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Should you make one or two of each set of brachot during a hurricane and how often?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9639/5275\">this M.Y. question</a> regarding the brachot to say on witnessing a hurricane.</p>\n\n<p>Excerpt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Upon seeing/feeling uncommonly strong winds (a hurricane would\n  qualify), on feeling an earthquake, lightning, or thunder, the\n  Shulchan Aruch says to say Oseh Ma'aseh vereshit, and \"if you want\"\n  Shekocho u'gvurato malei olam. (OC 227) The nosei kelim there say that\n  the custom is to say Oseh Ma'aseh vereshit on lightning, and Shekocho\n  u'gvurato malei olam on thunder</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the same <em>bracha</em> or possibly both brachot that are said for the hurricane winds are also said for lightning and thunder. A hurricane includes winds and frequently lightning and thunder. If one has said the barchot on the wind, does this exempt saying the brachot when seeing the lightning and hearing the thunder?</p>\n\n<p>How often should one say these brachot? Every hurricane has an eye, which is an area of clear skies (usually) and calm winds in the center of the storm. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/3534/5275\">This M.Y. answer</a> says that if the sky clears, and then clouds return, one should make a new bracha. </p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/61126/5275\">this M.Y. answer</a> <em>proposes</em> that it may not apply if it's the same storm. The answer is vague, b/c O.C. only says \"if the sky clears.\" If the eye passes over your area, should you make a new set of brachot when the thunder & lightning and wind return? Is it considered a \"new\" storm, in terms of halacha? </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does a Chabad tallit katan have silk corners?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>All <strong>wool</strong> tallitot katanim I have ever seen have reinforced corners, usually made from a square of <strong>cotton</strong> cloth. This prevents the tzitziyot from tearing through the hole from daily \"wear and tear\" and rendering the tallit katan passul (unusable). </p>\n\n<p>However, aside from the usual differences that distinguish a Chabad tallit katan from others (two diagonal holes; tzitzit tying mehtod; round neck), a Chabad tallit katan has reinforced corners with <strong>silk</strong> squares, rather than cotton.

I am inclined to believe this is specifically a Chabad minhag, as I have never seen a non-Chabad tallit katan with silk corners, only with cotton corners. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is the Chabad minhag to have corners reinforced with silk?</strong> In the comments to this question before I edited, people didn't understand that I know that the silk is there to reinforce the corners and keep the hole from tearing through.

Chassidim began to wear silk because of their meticulousness about not wearing woolen clothing at all, because of a concern that a linen thread may have been sewn into the wool garment, thereby prohibiting it as sha’atnez. The Chida, living in Eretz Israel, was a witnesses to the beginning of the Aliya of the Chassidim, and he asked them about the practice of wearing silk. He reports the story in his flowery language:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Years ago a band of scribes came from a foreign land to settle in Eretz Israel. Two of them were Rabbis who sanctified and purified themselves in a meticulous manner. All could see that they dressed themselves from head to toe in silk, and I asked these Rabbis to explain the practice… The Rabbis said that in their opinion linen threads are woven into all the woolen garments in the world, and they are sha’atnez. Therefore they treat all woolen garments in all places as sha’atnez. This is what they said. From that point on a fire burned within me, but not one of the Rabbis or pious men of our holy city was concerned about this, for in all corners of the world Jews wear woolen garments from all places as is well-known. (Birkei Yosef, Yoreh De'a 299)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/philosophy/great-thinkers/vilna-gaon/mitnagdi-character-and-chassidic-character\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.etzion.org.il/en/philosophy/great-thinkers/vilna-gaon/mitnagdi-character-and-chassidic-character</a></p>\n<p>Why the corners are of different fabric than the main fabric of the tallis? Why not be an all woolen tallis like the sefaradim prefer?</p>\n<p>Because the main fabric is made entirely woven (at least historically), it isn't cut from a bigger piece of fabric so you don't need to sew a hem to avoid unraveling. Being entirely woven and also being imported from a place where it was forbidden to weave wool and linen together (the turkish tallis) then you would be safer knowing that you were not wearing shaatnez and still performing the mitzvah in the best way.</p>\n<p>The corners are definitely cut from a bigger piece of fabric. At that time the dominant fabrics especially in eastern Europe were wool and linen, no synthetics and  silk and even cotton were luxury items from distant lands. People would'nt buy another imported safe tallis-sized fabric just to cut 4 small squares from it, so to avoid shaatnez from the corners they would just buy a piece of fine silk (which isn't mixed with wool or linen and even if it were you could visibly recognize it) at the local store, the thread used to sew would also be silk.</p>\n<p>With the invention of synthetic fibers, their dominance along with cotton, and modern methods to identify fibers (e.g. microscopy) this isn't an issue anymore to chassidim and survives just as tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

Since there are indeed those who worship the dead, we ought to be extra careful to avoid this phrase.</p>\n\n<p>The Siddur Tzelusah D'Avraham has a commentary on the Siddur called \"Emek Bracha\". This Siddur is based on the practices of <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Avraham Landau</a> (1784 - 1875) and it was put together by his grandson Rav Menachem Mendel Chaim Landau.  It writes as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וממליכין את שם</strong> העולם נהגו להפסיק בין וממליכין לאת שם ולהמתין על הש\"ץ והוא על פי הטור שכתב בסימן ס\"א שלא לתכוף וממליכין את שם עיי\"ש והטעם כדי שיהיו כל הקהל עונין כאחת את שם האל הגדול כו' והא דרך שירה וכמו הקדושה עצמה</p>\n  \n  <p>We crown the name. People are accustomed to pause between \"וממליכין\" and \"את שם\", and to wait until the prayer leader. This is based on the Tur (OC 61) not to be too quick to say וממליכין and את שם. And [another] reason is so the whole congregation says together \"The Great Name etc.\" This is in the manner of a song of praise, like Kedushah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, besides attributing the reason to the Tur, as @DoubleAA suggested, he adds that there's an element of \"song\" to this custom.</p>\n\n<p>Like DoubleAA, I noticed many older siddurim don't have a paragraph break. Many had a period or colon before את שם, probably in deference to people pausing. We need more evidence how old this custom is, to compare to how siddurim print this line. From the above source, it's at least approximately 100-150 years old.</p>\n\n<p>What's ironic is this siddur is nusach Sefard, so they say וממליכי<strong>ן</strong>, making it a little less problematic to say the word את immediately after. Maybe that's why he suggests another reasoning.</p>\n\n\n",

They then came and stood before Moses and said to him, “Is a garment that is entirely of purple subject to the law of Zizith or is it exempt”? He replied to them: “It is subject to that law”. Whereupon they began to jeer at him: “Is this possible? A robe of any different coloured material, one thread of purple attached to it exempts it, and this that is entirely of purple should it not exempt itself (i.e. ipso facto be exempt) from the law of “Zizith”? (Midrash Tanchuma, Korach 2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why are Korach and his followers asking whether it is Chayav in Tzitzis? There is no reason why it shouldn't be Chayav in Tzitzis (strings at the corner). All that they've proved is that it should be Patur from Techeiles. Why don't they ask him whether a Beged that is completely Techeles should be Chayav in having Techeiles strings?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While it is impossible to know with certainty what the Tanhuma was thinking, I think that the following is a likely explanation.</p>\n\n<p>Numbers (15:38-9) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְעָשׂוּ לָהֶם צִיצִת עַל-כַּנְפֵי בִגְדֵיהֶם, לְדֹרֹתָם; וְנָתְנוּ עַל-צִיצִת הַכָּנָף, פְּתִיל תְּכֵלֶת: וְהָיָה לָכֶם, לְצִיצִת, וּרְאִיתֶם אֹתוֹ וּזְכַרְתֶּם אֶת-כָּל-מִצְו‍ֹת יְהוָה, וַעֲשִׂיתֶם אֹתָם</p>\n  \n  <p>That they make them throughout their generations fringes in the\n  corners of their garments, and that they put with the fringe of each\n  corner a thread of blue. </p>\n  \n  <p>And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and\n  remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After describing the tekhelet, verse 39 states that <em>it</em> shall be tsitsit, and you shall see <em>it</em> and remember all the mitsvot.</p>\n\n<p>This could be interpreted as saying that the tekhelet in particular serves as the reminder of all the mitsvot.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this remembering of the mitsvot is presented as being the reason for the mitsvah. It seems likely that the originator of the arguement regarding a garment fully dyed tekhelet, read the verses thusly. Accordingly, since the whole reason for the mitsva is remembering the mitsvot, and since it is particularly the tekhelet which serves this purpose, it follows that a fully dyed garment should be fully exempt from the entire mitsvah! Not just just from tekhelet.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is some corroboration for the above reading of the verses (although not evidence that this was the reading of the originator of the above argument) see the commentary of Rashbam <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.39?lang=he&p2=Rashbam_on_Numbers.16.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to verse 39</a>, who may be explaining that the singular <em>it</em> refers exclusively to the tekhelet:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיה לכם לציצית - [פתיל] הציצית הזה יהיה לכם לראייה שתראו אותו. כמו מציץ מן החרכים. וכן מצאתי בסיפרי. [וגם] פתיל תכלת פירשו רבותינו לפי שהתכלת דומה לים וים דומה לרקיע ורקיע לכסא הכבוד </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, I am not sure if that is his intent, and it is difficult to determine given different versions of this passage, (note Sefarias minor variations).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This interestingly phrased question of Korach appears in two other sources.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.18?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Badmibar Rabbah</strong> 18:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קָפַץ קֹרַח וְאָמַר לְמשֶׁה טַלִּית שֶׁכֻּלָּהּ תְּכֵלֶת מַהוּ שֶׁתְּהֵא פְּטוּרָה מִן הַצִּיצִית, אָמַר לוֹ חַיֶּיבֶת בְּצִיצִית. אָמַר לוֹ קֹרַח טַלִית שֶׁכֻּלָּהּ תְּכֵלֶת אֵין פּוֹטֶרֶת עַצְמָהּ, אַרְבָּעָה חוּטִין פּוֹטְרוֹת אוֹתָהּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As well as <a href=\"https://sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.50a.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Yerushalmi Sanhedrin</strong> 10:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עמד ועשה טלית שכולן תכלת אתא גבי משה א\"ל משה רבינו טלית שכלה תכלת מה שתהא חייבת בציצית אמר לו חייבת דכתיב גדילים תעשה לך וגו'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In both places as well it says Korach asked if this garment is obligated in <em><strong>tzitzis</strong></em>, where seemingly it being made of <em>techeiles</em> shouldn't make a difference to if it needs <em>tzitzis</em> or not.

Moshe responded that he still needed to make some of the strings <em>techeiles</em>. This explanation fits better with Korach’s subsequent question, which is similar in nature: Does a house full of <em>scrolls</em> need a <em>scroll</em> on the doorpost, i.e. a <em>mezuzah</em>. What they have in common is I have X, why would I need another X.

He seems to interpret it like @mevaqesh suggested, that Korach felt that a garment full of <em>techeiles</em> accomplished the purpose of the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>tzitzis</em>, so there was no point in adding <em>tzitzis</em> to it.</p>\n<p>Now, this sounds like Korach is <em>doresh ta'amah dekra</em>, that he applies the reason behind the <em>mitzvah</em> to its laws.

If the nonJew puts it down in your house, you should leave it until after Shabbos to open it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1592\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Handling Mail Received on Shabbat</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Is it permissible to open mail or packages that were delivered to one's home on Shabbat?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Shemuel Pinhasi (contemporary), in his work VeDaber Davar (p. 111),\n  rules that if mail was delivered to the mailbox outside the door to\n  one's home, he should Le’chatchila not bring it into his home until\n  after Shabbat. If the mail was delivered into his home, it is\n  forbidden to open any letters or packages. In fact, it appears from a\n  comment of the Peri Hadash (commentary to the Shulhan Aruch by Rav\n  Hizkiya Da Silva, 1659-1698), in Yoreh De'a (118), that opening\n  letters or packages on Shabbat constitutes a Torah violation. Although\n  many other authorities dispute this position, all agree that this is\n  forbidden on Shabbat, at least on the level of Rabbinic enactment.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, Rav Pinhasi rules (listen to audio recording for precise\n  citation) that one may ask a gentile to open a letter or package for\n  him on Shabbat, provided that he expresses his request in the form of\n  a \"Remez\" (a subtle allusion). He might say, for example, \"I would\n  like to read this letter but it's closed.\" Once the non-Jew opens the\n  package, it is permissible to make use of the items. Even though the\n  letter or package had been brought from outside the \"Tehum\" (area\n  beyond which one may not travel on Shabbat), Halacha nevertheless\n  allows one to handle these items on Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, this assumes that the material he would like to read is\n  permissible and appropriate for Shabbat, such as Torah educational\n  journals and the like. Furthermore, Rav Pinhasi notes, one must ensure\n  that the envelope or package does not contain any Mukseh items. But\n  assuming the items are not Mukseh, one may indirectly ask a non-Jew to\n  open the package on his behalf on Shabbat. Thus, for example, if a\n  person received food items or jewelry in the mail on Shabbat, and he\n  would like to use the product on Shabbat, he may allude to his\n  non-Jewish housekeeper that he wishes her to open the package for him.</p>\n  \n  <p>Summary: Mail delivered to an outdoor mailbox should not be brought\n  inside the home on Shabbat. If the mail was brought inside the home,\n  one may not open the envelope of package, but he may hint a request to\n  a non-Jew to open it for him, assuming, of course, that the contents\n  are not Mukseh or otherwise inappropriate for Shabbat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Given that @sabbahillel’s <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/83526/15571\">answer</a> to this question quotes a somewhat one-sided view it is only fair to present the opposing opinions. As always, CYLOR for practical guidance.</p>\n\n<p>The issues at play are 1) <em>muktzeh</em> 2) tearing [open the delivered item] and 3) <em>tehum</em>.</p>\n\n<p>1) Needless to say if the item delivered falls under one of the categories of <em>muktzeh</em>, say a computer, it is indeed prohibited. But if it’s a necktie (that one might want to wear for Shabbos) or a piece of mail which is permitted to read on Shabbos <em>muktzeh</em> is not at play (specially if the recipient was intentionally not <em>maktseh</em> the item <em>m’daato</em>), cf. Magen Avraham <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.307.20?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">307:20</a>.</p>\n\n<p>2) <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_da_Silva\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pri Hadash</a>, cited in the above linked answer, discussed the tearing of an item in order to get to its contents and, basing his argument on Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbath.10.11?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbos 10:11</a>) who writes that disconnecting papers on Shabbos is prohibited, explains that it’s because the splitting is not done for a destructive purpose (על מנת לקלקל) rather to get to the contents which is constructive (על מנת לתקן). <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzvi_Ashkenazi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hacham Zvi</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=829&st=&pgnum=41\" rel=\"noreferrer\">resp. §39, end</a>) disagreed with him (and added that he “refuted PH’s claims when they met and the latter didn’t retort”; although it should be noted that R. Yehoshua Perahia <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=520&st=&pgnum=46\" rel=\"noreferrer\">[Vayikra Yehoshua, 20b]</a> maintains that PH’s silence is not proof of acquiescence). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%92%27%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tel Oros</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21392&st=&pgnum=391&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mohek, p. 348</a> beginning on right column) also disagrees with PH arguing that this action (tearing) is not the doer’s primary purpose (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/28904\">melachah she’enah tzrichah legufa</a>) and no constructive result is being done to the item being torn. As a result he opined that such an act certainly isn’t a biblical transgression as PH would have. TO further attempts to demonstrate from a Tosefta (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Beitsah.3.9?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beitzah 3:9</a>) that tearing in such a fashion, for a different purpose, is permissible. In regards to Rambam, authorities explain his ruling that it is only when the papers were initially joined together to remain in a permanent state, not so when a letter, for example, is closed with intention to be unsealed, cf. MB (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.340.45?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">440:45</a>) and <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ROY</a> (Hazon Ovadiah - Shabbos vol. 6 62ff.) who cites all the above. </p>\n\n<p>Others argue from the Mishnah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.146a.3?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shab. 146a</a>) proving that such an act of tearing (opening) is permitted as it’s not considered constructive when intending to get to the item’s contents. Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Darke Moshe</a> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Darchei_Moshe%2C_Orach_Chaim.519.1.1?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">§519</a>) cites the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_ben_Moshe_Levi_Moelin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharil</a> who allowed opening a letter brought on a holiday by a gentile. <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Spira\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Elia Rabbah</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7767&st=&pgnum=233\" rel=\"noreferrer\">307:32</a>) notes that the Maharil permitted opening by [the Jewish recipient] himself. </p>\n\n<p>3) If the recipient were able to verify that the item delivered was already within the <em>techum</em> when Shabbos began then this issue would not be applicable. Standard USPS items, for example, are typically already at their local distribution center the day prior to their delivery. Not being familiar with all courier methods it’d be safer to suggest a simple solution: track the package/mail before Shabbos and check where it is located. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I intended this to be a comment on Oliver's excellent post, but it's too long.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to add a \"snif l'hakel\" regarding the issue of tekhumin that Oliver mentions in their post. Their advice to verify whether the item was within the tekhum before Shabbat implicitly assumes the halakha that an item brought from outside the tekhum on Shabbat is assur to use on Shabbat, at least for the item’s intended recipient (for the details of this halakha, see Tur/SA OC 307:13-14 and 515 with mefarshim). The Arukh Hashulkhan (307:5) explains that the issur applies only when the delivery is done specifically on behalf of the recipient, e.g., a Jew sending an item via a gentile messenger, or a gentile gifting an item to a Jew (SA OC 515). The Arukh Hashulkhan explains that for this reason, the issur does not apply to the modern mail system: in following their mail route, the mailperson is not a personal messenger for any specific item or person! If I am understanding the Arukh Hashulkhan correctly, there is no need to ensure that the item was within the tekhum before Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the relevant text of the Arukh Hashulkhan:</p>\n\n<p>גם בזמנינו כשמביאין מהבי דואר אין זה בכלל דבר הבא מחוץ לתחום בשביל הישראל, דהבי דואר הולכת שלא בשביל כונת מכתב זה</p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Shortly after I wrote this, I was happy to see this analysis employed <a href=\"https://collive.com/ups-packages-that-arrive-on-shabbos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">elsewhere</a>, apparently found in the Piskei Teshuvot (Shabbat Vol. 2, 307:20) though I have not verified this as of yet as I do not own the Sefer.</p>\n\n\n",

On each corner of a Jewish person’s garment with ritual fringes, ten people from each of the seventy nations will take hold. That totals seven hundred people on each corner; 2,800 people altogether.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.8.26?vhe=Wikitext&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berurah 8:26</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See them - Like it is written \"And you shall see it and remember\" etc.  And those people that put the ציצית into their pants, not only do they hide their eyes from (ie. ignore) what is written \"And you shall see it and remember\" etc... they also disgrace the mitzvah of השם יתברך, and they will have to make a reckoning over this.  And this that they say that [they must do that  because] they go amongst the non-Jews, for that it would be enough to tuck the ציצית into the corner.  <em>And if they had some gift from a king of flesh and blood which had the name of the king engraved in it... how much would they adorn themselves in front of other people constantly?; How much more so by ציצית, which is an allusion to the name of the King of all Kings, the Holy One Blessed Be He.</em>  And as is seen later in Siman 24, Se'if 5 - How honorable is the man who carries His Name on him!  And חז\"ל said: \"One who is careful with the מצוה of ציצית, he merits to see the Face of the שכינה\".  And it is inferred from the verses, that they Jews that are remaining at the time [of redemption] will be found with this מצוה, as it is written: \"And ten men from nations of every tongue will take hold of every Jew by a corner of his cloak\" etc (Zechariah 9, 23).

    "content": "# Gezer Calendar and Lunar calendar\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Do the paleo-Hebrew inscriptions of the Gezer calendar, dated around the 10th century BCE, suggest that at one time the ancient Israelites used a strictly lunar calendar?</p>\n\n<p>The calendar is written crudely in paleo Hebrew on stone. The inscription goes something like: </p>\n\n<p>\"Two months of harvest \nTwo months of planting \nTwo months are late planting \nOne month of hoeing \nOne month of barley-harvest\nOne month of harvest and festival\nTwo months of grape harvesting\nOne month of summer fruit\"</p>\n\n<p>The word \"month\" is translated to mean \"moon\", according to online sources. There's no indication of a possible 13th month; neither are any of the months named to give an indication as to when in calendar year did the harvest begin etc. This possibly suggests that the years were strictly lunar, with harvest time etc occurring in various months throughout a typical decade.</p>\n\n<p>If it doesn't indicate a strictly lunar calendar, would it point to the notion that a typical year would've been pictured as 12 lunar months?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I do not think it suggests that the ancient Israelites used a strictly lunar calendar for a number of reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There is no evidence that the Gezer calendar is meant to be a calendar in the sense of setting forth a normative year. It is a description or proscription of the farming that would take place over a year, broken down by months. It might very well be a farming plan for a specific farm for a specific year.</p></li>\n<li><p>A typical year in the Jewish calendar is 12 lunar months. And leap months \nin biblical and second temple times were added every few years but were not added until the end of the year, so any prospective statement would presume 12 months.</p></li>\n<li><p>The word for month ירח comes from the hebrew word for \"moon\" (just like the english word \"month\") but came to mean month in general, not just a lunar month. Therefore, the mere fact that the term used is ירח does not mean that it was strictly lunar at that time.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am editing this answer because I have come across a Baraisa quoted in Baba Metzia 106b that is astonishingly similar to Gezer calendar. The Baraisa quotes a three-way dispute about the agricultural seasons: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רשב\"ג משום ר\"מ אומר וכן היה רבי שמעון בן מנסיא אומר כדבריו חצי תשרי מרחשון וחצי כסליו זרע חצי כסליו טבת וחצי שבט חורף חצי שבט אדר וחצי ניסן קור חצי ניסן אייר וחצי סיון קציר חצי סיון תמוז וחצי אב קיץ חצי אב אלול וחצי תשרי חום רבי יהודה מונה מתשרי ר\"ש מונה ממרחשון</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel from Rabbi Meir said, and so to did Rabbi Shimon ben Menasia say like his words: Half of Tishrei, Marchesvan, and half of Kislev is the planting season; half of Kislev, Teves, and half of Shevat is the winter season (but the Gemara explains that this is the late planting season for barley and legumes); half of Shevat, Adar, and half of Nissan is the cold season; half of Nissan, Iyar, and half of Sivan is the harvesting season; half of Sivan, Tammuz, and half of Av is the summer season, and half of Av, Elul, and half of Tishre is the hot season. Rabbi Yehuda counts (the agricultural cycle) starting in Tishrei.  Rabbi Shimon counts (the agricultrual cycle) staring in Marcheshvan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To me this makes clear that the Gezer calendar--just like the Baraisa--is an agricultural calendar setting forth the ideal times for planting, harvesting, etc. in Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is disputed by scholars as to whether the Gezer Calendar is of Israelite origin in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>The calendar could very well be written in the Phoenician language, Proto-Canaanite, or Paleo-Hebrew, as all three languages share the same alphabet and root vocabulary. </p>\n\n<p>Since there is no definite proof that the calendar was written by the Israelites, we cannot determine for sure whether or not the Israelites once used a strictly lunar calendar. However, I would always trust thousands of years of tradition over an archeological discovery. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If \"yrh\" in the Gezer calendar means a lunar month, then the calendar must have been intercalated periodically or the agricultural activities would have fallen out of synchronization with the months.</p>\n<p>There is always the possibility that it describes a solar calendar like the Egyptian calendar.  This calendar did not have a fixed relationship to the seasons, but over a single human lifetime the relationship would have been stable.</p>\n\n\n",

(I'm unaware of any nusach that does <strong>not</strong> have this change.)</p>\n\n<p>Why does Shabbat get a different version for this first blessing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Summary of points from this <a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/Why_Is_The_Text_Of_Yotzer_Ohr_Different_For_Shabbat.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beurei Hatefillah article</a>:</p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that in general, one is not supposed to change the text of any <em>bracha</em> from the format that was created by אנשי כנסת הגדולה (Men of the Great Assembly). Thus, we find no mentioning of Shabbat in any brachot except for the middle part of the <em>Amidah</em> and the 3rd bracha of <em>Birkat Hamazon</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Sefer Ha'itim</em> is vehemently against making any changes to <em>Yotzer Or</em>, and thus says that if one wants to add anything extra for Shabbat, he should do so after saying <em>Barchu</em> and prior to starting <em>Yotzer Or</em>.</p>\n\n<p>No other source is bothered by making these changes, though. Siddur <em>Avodat Yisra'el</em> (Published by R' Seligmann Yitzhak Baer (1825-1897)), says that it has become custom to lengthen praises in <em>Yotzer</em> on Shabbat which is the most honored of all other days.</p>\n\n<p><em>Likutei Maharich</em> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Check the Zohar for Parshat Teruma and V’Yakhail and you find that it\n  is not mentioned there that one adds anything to the Bracha of Yotzair\n  on Shabbat except Ail Adon but H’Ail HaPoseach and L’Ail Shavas is not\n  mentioned there. In the Rambam, even Ail Adon is not mentioned as\n  being added to the Bracha of Yotzair Ohr. But you do find all these\n  paragraphs mentioned in the Siddur (sic.) Rav Amram Gaon, the Machzor Vitri,\n  the Avudrohom and the KolBo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>O.C. 68:1 makes a general statement that one should refrain from saying any <em>piyutim</em> in the blessings of Shema as this is considered an interruption.  It's curious that he stated this knowing that these <em>piyutim</em> said on Shabbat had already been in place as they were written in Siddur Rav Amram Ga'on. It's unclear as to whether Rav Kairo would have recited this version or not, based on that opinion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>On a simple level, it is stated by <a href=\"http://matzav.com/todays-yahrtzeits-and-history-9-nissan-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaacov Tzvi Yolles</a> in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=267\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Kehillat Yaacov, ערך שב: שבת:ב</a> that the change in the text for Shabbat is because we follow what the angels did on the first Shabbat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בשבת בראשית קרא הקב״ה אל המלאכים ומינה אותם על העולם פתחו כולם ואמרו הכל יודוך לכך אומרים בשבת הכל יודוך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The opening words of the weekday version emphasizes G-d's flow of blessing and maintenance into the creation, like with the phrase:</p>\n\n<p>המאיר לארץ ולדרים עליה, ברחמים כו׳</p>\n\n<p><em>The One who radiates to the earth and to those who dwell upon it, in mercy...</em></p>\n\n<p>The emphasis is the flow from <em>Above</em> to <em>Below</em>. In the language of kabbalah, this is referred to as אור ישר, <em>direct</em> light.</p>\n\n<p>In the text for Shabbat, the primary focus changes directions, like with the phrase:</p>\n\n<p><strong>הכל</strong> יודוך, ו<strong>הכל</strong> ישבחוך, ו<strong>הכל</strong> יאמרו כו׳</p>\n\n<p>Everything acknowledges You, and everything praises You, and everything says...</p>\n\n<p>The emphasis is from <em>Below</em> to <em>Above</em>.

It is worth pointing out that this idea of <em>sharing the same root</em> is not in the sense of common grammar, but as explained, for example, in ספר קל״ח פתחי חכמה by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in the section <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51283&st=&pgnum=93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ענין האותיות והשמות: פתח יח-כא</a>.

But the R Yonah himself holds that the Rabbis can do such a thing when they deem it necessary for the Mitzva (קיום המצוה עצמה), as he goes on and brings support to his answer from other places in the Talmud. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding your second question, see also (besides for the R Yonah that also addresses this question) first Mishna in Brachos, where it compares it to all sacrifices (כל הנאכלים ליום אחד).

The rule for dry solids that turn into liquids once heated (e.g., sugar, baby formula) is that they cannot be reheated above <em>yad soledet bo</em> (109-113 degrees F, 43-45 degrees C) because of the rule of <em>yesh bishul achar bishul bedavar lach</em> (see e.g., <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/163325/jewish/Bishul-Achar-Bishul-Cooking-After-Cooking.htm#footnoteRef4a163325\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>As such one should avoid putting chocolate where it might go over that temperature. But as R Daniel Braude writes (Learn Shabbos, p. 139)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>If</strong> [...] <strong>the liquid  will not reach 109/43 degrees</strong> even if it will\n  stay there throughout Shabbos, <strong>one may place it near a heat source</strong>.\n  For instance, one may place a container of ice cream far enough from a\n  <em>blech</em> or covered hot plate that it will soften slightly and be easier to serve, yet will never reach 109/43 [degrees].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now there is a question whether melting constitutes a prohibition of <em>molid</em> (creating a new entity). Shemirat Shabbat K'Hilchata (vol. 1, p. 99) writes one is allowed to melt ice cream so long as one does not place it where it could reach 113/54 degrees. Similarly one can freeze ice cream as it is generally thought of as food.</p>\n\n<p>With chocolate, it might depend whether you are trying to create liquid chocolate (which might transgress <em>molid</em>) or looking to soften up the chocolate chips to create soft chocolate (which would be permitted according to the sources above).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146\">consult your rabbi</a>\nbefore implementing anything <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1734\">you learn here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

But I find his words extremely perplexing, since the Torah clearly states (bamidbar 16:28-30) that the purpose of the miracle with Korach was to establish that Moses is a genuine prophet,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמֶר משֶׁה בְּזֹאת תֵּדְעוּן כִּי יְדֹוָד שְׁלָחַנִי לַעֲשׂוֹת אֵתו\n  כָּל הַמַּעֲשִׂים הָאֵלֶּה כִּי לֹא מִלִּבִּי (כט) אִם כְּמוֹת כָּל\n  הָאָדָם יְמֻתוּן אֵלֶּה וּפְקֻדַּת כָּל הָאָדָם יִפָּקֵד עֲלֵיהֶם לֹא\n  יְדֹוָד שְׁלָחָנִי  (ל) וְאִם בְּרִיאָה יִבְרָא יְדֹוָד וּפָצְתָה\n  הָאֲדָמָה אֶת פִּיהָ וּבָלְעָה אֹתָם וְאֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁר לָהֶם וְיָרְדוּ\n  חַיִּים שְׁאֹלָה וִידַעְתֶּם כִּי נִאֲצוּ הָאֲנָשִׁים הָאֵלֶּה אֶת\n  יְדֹוָד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How can the Rambam state that the motive behind this miracle was not to establish the veracity of his mission when the Torah clearly says that this was indeed his motive?\nAnd to add more confusion the Rambam contradicts himself in his commentary to the Mishna (beginning of Sanhedrin 10)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היסוד השמיני: היות התורה מן השמים, והוא שנאמין כי כל התורה הזאת הנתונה\n  ע\"י\n   משה רבינו ע\"ה שהיא כולה מפי הגבורה, כלומר שהגיעה אליו כולה מאת ה'\n  יתברך בענין שנקרא על דרך השאלה דבור ואין ידוע היאך הגיע אלא היה משה\n  ע\"ה שהגיע לו, וכי הוא היה כמו סופר שקוראין לו והוא כותב כל מאורעות\n  הימים הספורים והמצות ולפיכך נקרא מחוקק וכו'. והמאמר המורה על היסוד הזה\n  הוא מה שנאמר (במדבר טז) ויאמר משה בזאת תדעון כי ה' שלחני לעשות כל\n  המעשים האלה כי לא מלבי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Over here the Rambam clearly uses this verse to support the ikar that Moses did not invent his own Mitzvot as he already proved to Korach with his miracle that he is a genuine prophet! The Rambam brings this verse as evidence that Moses was not a false prophet. But in yesodei hatorah he seems to say that this miracle was just a practical way of getting rid of his opponents! What is going on here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First I will attempt to address the contradiction with the verses, as Rambam could theoretical change his opinion, or modify his view, but he cannot disagree with a verse. Therefore, an answer for the contradiction to the verse is more pressing.</p>\n\n<p>In summary two answers (discussed more below) are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In Yesodei HaTorah he says that miracles arent the reason to believe that someone is a prophet. The verse never says that the miracle was a reason to believe Moshe was  a <em>prophet</em>. Rather, it was meant to show that Moshe was the rightful <em>leader</em>.</li>\n<li>While a miracle is insufficient proof to <em>believe</em> someone is a prophet (or leader), it is a good reason to <em>doubt</em> someone. By process of elimination, Moshe was believed; not by dint of the miracle itself, but because Korah was disqualified, and he was left.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>First Answer</strong>: Let us carefully read his words in Yeosodei HaTorah. He says that the point of miracles was not as the ultimate confirmation, but to achieve some end, לפי הצורך עשאם. What then was the point of the Earth swallowing Korah et al. at all? He himself describes there כפרו בו עדת קרח בלעה אותן הארץ, that when they denied Moshe, that the solution was for the Earth to swallow them. So, Rambam himself in Yesodei HaTorah acknowledges that the event was meant to solve the problem of denial of Moshe; likely, by bolstering his credentials.</p>\n\n<p>The question is, what about Moshe were they denying. It appears form the simple reading of the verses (or at least the verses could be understood), that Korah wasn't making a theological point against the Torah, its way, a particular prophecy of Moshe, or even against Moshe's status as a prophet. After all, they already experienced Sinai, at which Moshe pretty clearly played a central role (See Yesodei HaTorah 8:1-2), rather, it was a fight over who the leader of the people was supposed to be.[i]</p>\n\n<p>Rambam's point is Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah (ch. 8) is that belief in a prophet and his prophecy, cannot be justified by a supernatural event alone. After all, maybe its just a magic trick. However, that is not what took place with the Korah affair. Prophet Moshe and his Torah were never under assault; it was Moshe Rabbenu; Moshe the leader, who was under assault, and it was to support his role as leader; not his status as a prophet, that the ground swallowed Korah. Note Moshe's words: ויאמֶר משֶׁה בְּזֹאת תֵּדְעוּן כִּי יְדֹוָד שְׁלָחַנִי לַעֲשׂוֹת אֵתו כָּל הַמַּעֲשִׂים הָאֵלֶּה כִּי לֹא מִלִּבִּי. The event is supposed to be evidence for Moshe's <em>activities</em>; no mention is made of proof for his statements, prophecies, or the Torat Moshe which he preached. The other verses imply this or can be read this way as well: לֹא יְדֹוָד שְׁלָחָנִי vs. כִּי נִאֲצוּ הָאֲנָשִׁים הָאֵלֶּה אֶת יְדֹוָד. Neither one focuses on the nature of the religion or prophecy or its teaching, but whether Moshe is the one sent by God, or whether Korah is a rabble rousing rebel. Accordingly, there is no contradiction between Yesodei HaTorah and the verse.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Second Answer</strong>: There is another reason which it may not be a contradiction, which is that in the Korah affair, there seems to have been two options; Moshe, or Korah. While a miracle is not sufficient proof to belief a supernatural claim; that God communicated a message to someone, and that we must act accordingly, in the case of Moshe vs. Korah, where Korah was swallowed by the ground, it is safe to assume that he is not the leader / prophet (even though a miracle isn't a positive proof). Accordingly, by process of elimination, Moshe was considered the messenger. A miracle isn't good proof in a vacuum, but here is was just meant to disqualify Korah.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding the PHM to Sanhedrin. We can suggest the fact that the Torah was given to the prophet Moshe is taken for granted. However, who says Moshe didn't tamper with things, adding or taking away. The focus of the ikkar isn't that Moshe was a prophet, or that he received the Torah, but rather that the whole Torah is holy, and doesn't have less important additions by anyone; namely Moshe. Note his words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שנאמין שכל התורה הזו הנמצאת בידינו היום הזה היא התורה שניתנה למשה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, the fact that Moshe received the Torah is taken for granted. The point is, as he goes on to say that Moshe faithfully transcribed the whole thing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושהוא במעלת לבלר שקורין לפניו והוא כותב כולה...וזהו ענין אין תורה מן השמים, אמרו שהוא האומר שכל התורה כולה מפי הקדוש ברוך הוא חוץ מפסוק אחד שלא אמרו הקדוש ברוך הוא אלא משה מפי עצמו...והוא רק מוביל שליחות נאמן במה שהביא, והדבור המורה על היסוד הזה השמיני הוא אמרו בזאת תדעון כי ה' שלחני וכו' כי לא מלבי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, this doesn't run afoul of his statement in Yesodei HaTorah, since in PHM the issue is not whether Moshe was a prophet, but whether he added less holy parts to the Torah. Regarding this issue, Rambam invokes the Korah incident. Moshe declares that his actions as a leader have been vindicated by the earth swallowing Korah. This credibility that he gained should be sufficient to quiet baseless conspiracies that he tampered with the Torah. This is different from establishing him as a prophet in the first place, or the Torah as true in the first place. Those monumental claims require a higher degree of proof.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] Although admittedly, Moshe was commanded (Exodus 28:1) to designate Aharon's sons as the priests; not Korah, and Korah clearly implies (Numbers 16:10) that this was of Moshe's initiative , his point wasn't that Moshe wasn't a Navi in general but that he shouldn't be in charge. He didn't care about the nature of the prophecy, but about the conclusion; who was in charge.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Cheilek the issue is not the idea of Nevu'as Moshe as ultimate, direct national revelation- which is itself addressed in the earlier Ikar/Yesod. It's \"Torah Min HaShamayim\"- and though it may seem as if some parts are Divine and others not, rather from Moshe himself, ironically such a claim does not give honor to God but rather \"D'var HaShem Bazah\". It is up to us to rediscover and appreciate the Divinity: Moshe added nothing.  </p>\n\n<p>Rambam's prooftext for his 8th article is \"B'Zos Teid'un\" by Korach. The fact that Korach et al.'s K'firah was seen to Moshe himself as necessitating he initiate an Os of having them swallowed by the Earth whole was because he, Moshe, was responsible for being the Moseir Ne'eman, therefore specifically, Moshe, not God originally, needed to respond to their K'firah in such a drastic way. Moshe could have left it up to God to punish them as He'd see fit, but Moshe didn't. </p>\n\n<p>This is the meaning of כל האותות שעשה משה במדבר לפי הצורך עשאם לא להביא ראיה על הנבואה... כפרו בו עדת קרח בלעה אותן הארץ   </p>\n\n<p>The Os wasn't meant to prove anything. Nothing short of another Maamad of mass national revelation by God himself, yet again would prove this- and \"Been there, done that!\" Korach and Co. decided to use Kushyos and allegations of nepotism to undermine \"V'Gam B'cha Yaaminu L'Olam\"!  </p>\n\n<p>They, and we, have the B'chirah to allow ourselves to doubt the Divinity of parts of the Torah that are Peleh to us, or just seem to indicate human interference and thus claim that Moshe's claimed prophecy indeed trumps all other purported claims of prophecy- but perhaps Moshe interfered and contaminated Torah with his own ideas, not God's.   </p>\n\n<p>The statement of Sh'mos 3:18 'V'Sham'u' is referring to 3:16-17- the Jews in Egypt will believe in Moshe's Sh'lichus. Earlier, 3:12, God mentioned the Os for the Sh'lichus would be the National communal 'Avodah on the mountain. This implies that there will be some kind of unique Maamad which will not allow for any other explanation but that Moshe is indeed God's Shaliach. Rambam claims Moshe understood this. However, when God claims they'll listen in Egypt, before any such Maamad, Moshe has a real Kashya.   </p>\n\n<p>Short of such a Maamad- why would they believe Moshe on his say-so alone?! Despite the legitimacy of the Kashya, God is angered at Moshe's Ch'shad that the Jews will lack Bitachon in God and Emunah in their Massores. God then gives Moshe 3 Osos to be both Mechazeik the Jews' Emunah and Bitachon- but not as Raayah, only Chizuk- as well as a Chizuk to Moshe that the Jews will indeed believe in his Sh'lichus even then. This is why Moshe only asks that they won't listen after God says they'll do so even in Egypt, though he didn't say anything after 'Ta'avdun'. </p>\n\n<p>Korach's rebellion proves that 'V'Gam etc.' is not exactly a Havtachah... </p>\n\n<p>It is saying that this Maamad will prove sufficient to establish Moshe's Sh'lichus and that it would also be sufficient to prove that since such a Maamad clearly demonstrates Moshe's Sh'lichus, even were Moshe to have B'chirah regarding his Nevuah (unlike Meshech Chochmah, Hakdamah to Sh'mos and elsewhere) God's demonstration of the truth of his Sh'lichus by having the people know firsthand that God was speaking to Moshe \"Moshe, Moshe- Go tell them...\" just could not be undermined by the possibility of Moshe's tampering with Torah.    </p>\n\n<p>That's why Rambam defines in Iggeres Teiman עמדו אבותיו על הר סיני as referring to those who, at hearing God speak to Moshe, committed themselves to the B'ris, committed to 'Na'aseh V'Nishma', and committed all their future generations. For them God committed Himself that the power of the Truth of the Maamad would remain throughout the generations of those select few at Har Sinai so described. It is these few descendants of the few who will make up the 'S'ridim Asher HaShem Korei'...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the yetzer hara a separate entity?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is something that's always bothered me about the classic \"yeshivish\" presentation of Judaism. </p>\n\n<p>Most \"yeshivish\" people will claim that the yetzer hara is an entity that is almost completely separate from a person. This bothers me, because it feels like it's just a cop-out, just an excuse so people can absolve themselves from being fully responsible their bad actions (\"It's not me, really; the yetzer hara made me do it!\").</p>\n\n<p>So i want to know if the yetzer hara is really something that can be considered separately from the human being. If my basic Hebrew skills aren't failing me, the word \"yetzer\" does actually mean something like \"Evil Inclination\" (how \"yetzer hara\" is usually translated) or \"nature,\" and doesn't necessarily refer to something external to the person, I think. Therefor, I don't think that just any reference to yetzer hara will suffice to establish \"yetzer hara as a separate entity.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is the yetzer hara a separate entity from a person? If so, what is the earliest reference to this in Judaic literature?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Bonus: If it is true that the yetzer hara is not a part of a person, how is this not somehow escapist?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Bava Basra 16a says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר\"ל הוא שטן הוא יצר הרע הוא מלאך המות הוא שטן</p>\n<p>Reish Lakish says: Satan, the evil inclination, and the Angel of Death are one</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara in Sukka 52a says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנו רבנן ואת הצפוני ארחיק מעליכם זה יצר הרע שצפון ועומד בלבו של אדם</p>\n<p>The Sages taught concerning the verse: “But I will remove the northern one [hatzefoni] far off from you,” that this is referring to the evil inclination.

They are the inner emotions, instincts and desires that drive the human being.  These at times cause us to make mistakes.  We are responsible for the decisions we make and the consequences of our actions.  These inner forces at times can cause us to make mistakes.  They are not inherently bad.  They can be directed to the good and towards correct decisions.  For example, aggression often causes us to make mistakes in how we treat others.  However, David Hamelech used this part of his nature to fight Milchamas Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

Hacohen author ofSemikhat Hakhamim quoted by Rabbi Greenwald, p. 169, note 19; Rabbi Shlomo Kluger (Brody, 1765-1869) instructed his son and his students that they should recite kaddish for him for 12 full months and, if he should die in a leap year, for 13 full months — see Beit Yitzhak, Yoreh Deah, No. 157, quoted by Rabbi Greenwald, ibid., and by Rabbi Gedalia Felder, p. 224; Rabbi Rafael Aharon ibn Shimon, Nehar Mitzrayim, Alexandria, 1908,Aveilut, parag. 161, says that this is the custom of both Egypt and Jerusalem; Rabbi Ya’akov Cohen, Divrei Ya’akov, Djerba, 1912, quoted by Rabbi Ya’akov Yosef, p. 214, note 6; Rabbi Yisrael Yaakov Algazi, Shalmei Tzibbur, fol. 190b quoted by Sedei Hemedand by Rabbi Yosef Hayyim of Baghdad, Responsa Rav Pealim, Part 3, Yoreh Deah, No. 32; Rabbi David Novak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The next two customs are late variations of the custom of reciting kaddish for 11 months:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>E) Twelve Months Except for the Last Week</p>\n  \n  <p>A number of rabbis tried to reconcile the requirement of reciting\n  kaddish for 12 months with the popular belief that the judgment of the\n  wicked in Gehinom is 12 months. These rabbis compromised by ruling\n  that a mourner should recite kaddish for twelve months less the last\n  week.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Hayyim Benveniste (Turkey, 1603-1673) wrote in Knesset Hagedolah\n  to Yoreh Deah end of parag. 403, Hagahot Beit Yosef17 (as quoted by\n  Rabbi Yitzhak Lampronti, Pahad Yitzhak and by Rabbi Yosef Hayyim of\n  Baghdad, Responsa Rav Pealim, Part 3,Yoreh Deah, No. 32):</p>\n  \n  <p>Said the editor: But I ruled to recite kaddish and prayer for all\n  twelve months less one week, since the reason is because the judgment\n  of the wicked in Gehinom is twelve months, as long as one day is\n  missing from the 12 months, it is enough.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Hayyim Yosef David Azulai, the Hida, concurred (Birkei Yosef to\n  Yoreh Deah 376, subparagraph 8):</p>\n  \n  <p>According to what the Ari [Rabbi Yitzhak Luria] ztz”l wrote that\n  kaddish also helps to elevate his soul [i.e. of the departed], it\n  seems that [the mourner] should recite kaddish for all twelve months.\n  But because of the masses [who think that this means that the\n  mourner’s parent was wicked], he should omit the last week…</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Abraham Samuel Sofer (1815-1871), author of the Ketav Sofer,\n  actually did this for his father, Rabbi Moshe Sofer (1762-1839),\n  according to Rabbi Yoel Roth, Responsa Beit Hayotzer,Orah Hayyim, No.\n  45 as quoted by Rabbi Greenwald, p. 369, note 19. Rabbi Tukechinsky,\n  p. 327, reports that some individuals follow the ruling of Rabbi\n  Benveniste and Rabbi Azulai. Rabbi Abner Weiss agrees with this custom\n  if the person reciting kaddish is nota son.</p>\n  \n  <p>F) Twelve Full Months Except for One Week at theBeginning of the\n  Twelfth Month</p>\n  \n  <p>According to this custom, one recites kaddish for 11 months, stops for\n  one week, and then continues until the yahrzeit. This was the custom\n  in Baghdad in the 19th century, according to Rabbi Yosef Hayyim of\n  Baghdad (d. 1909, Ben Ish Hai, First Year, Parashat Vayehi, parag.\n  14). After quoting the above-mentioned opinion of Rabbi Azulai to\n  recite kaddish for one week less than 12 months, he adds:</p>\n  \n  <p>And here in our city Baghdad this was their custom: At the end of 11\n  months they do extra learning… and they take a break [from reciting\n  kaddish] after this for one week at the beginning of the 12th month,\n  and even though the rabbi z”l [i.e. Rabbi Azulai] wrote that one takes\n  a break during the last week of the [12th] month, it doesn’t matter\n  for it’s all the same.</p>\n  \n  <p>He repeats this custom in his Responsa Rav Pealim, Part 3, Yoreh Deah,\n  No. 32, where he justifies it on the basis of mysticism. One must\n  recite the kaddish at the end of the 12 months because the main ascent\n  of the soul in the heavens is at that time.</p>\n  \n  <p>This custom is recommended by Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef on the basis of\n  Rabbi Hayyim Benveniste and Rabbi Hayyim Yosef David Azulay, but, as\n  we have seen, those two rabbis did not recommend this specific custom.\n  This is also the opinion of Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, Tzror Hahayyim,\n  parag. 263, as quoted by Rabbi Goldman, p. 132, note 50.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

That is, when he or she reaches <em>halachik</em> majority, he/she has the option to (retroactively) nullify the conversion. Accordingly, much a case may be subject to closer scrutiny by a <em>Beis Din</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Converting someone who will not be observant</strong> (\"Orthodox\"): Simply put, a non-Jew has no obligation to eat kosher or keep Shabbos, and suffers no liability from the lack of observance. A Jew, including a convert, does have these obligations, and is <em>halachikally</em> liable for their violation. <em>This is indeed the literal meaning of <strong>Bar Mitzvah</strong>: being responsible for the mitzvos</em>. Most (responsible) Rabbis would not perform such a conversion.</li>\n<li><strong>Autistic / Special needs</strong>: Depending on the level of disability or delay, an individual may be said to lack competence (the <em>halachik</em> term may be <em>shoteh</em> or <em>pesi</em>).

The Pri Megadim there explains the Taz understands when you daven Maariv it's considered the next day, so the previous day was shortened.</p>\n\n<p>While I realize this approach or minhag isn't unanimous (the Magen Avraham there only says to wait to say kiddush, but no problem to daven early), this sounds like it should be a problem the entire sefira period, not just the night of Shavuos. </p>\n\n<p>Why then is it permitted (for example) to do early shabbos during sefira? Many communities avoid early Maariv on Shavuos but don't avoid it during sefira. I'm assuming the Taz has no problem with doing this since he only says this halacha by Shavuos night.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Technically, one can accept Shabbos early, but must still wait to say <em>sefiras haomer</em> until it has become full night. The reason is that we start Shabbos earlier than the time that the <em>new day</em> has started as far as the halachos of sefirah is concerned. Thus, during the sefirah period, we actually do not say the sefiras haomer in shul. It is similar to repeating the krias shmah after the appropriate zman when one has gone home.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, one can still count for <strong>Thursday</strong> after davening Friday <em>night</em> and accepting Shabbos, while saying the count for Friday <strong>with a bracha</strong> after the correct time has passed.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that this is done, is that Sefira is based on the 24 hour period, starting after nightfall. </p>\n\n<p>Your mention of waiting to start Ma'ariv for Shavuos, is because once Shavuos has started, the Sefirah period has been ended. Thus, one must wait until one would have been able to count <em>day 50</em> having completed all 49 days in order for Shavuos to start.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/ask-the-rabbi/q-a-catching-up-on-sefirah-on-shabbat-eve/2015/04/09/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Catching Up On Sefirah On Shabbat Eve</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Question:</strong> What if someone forgot to count sefirah Thursday evening but only realized after he finished davening Friday evening?

    "content": "# Carrying under second story deck\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently spent Shabbos in an area where there was no community eiruv. The house I stayed in had a deck that one could walk out onto from the second story of the house. The deck was enclosed by walls which formed a reshus ha'yachid adjacent to the house. The deck was supported by four poles which were planted in the ground outside. A door from the first floor of the house led out to the region directly below the porch. My question is, is it permissible to walk out the first floor door and carry in the area under the porch? Specifically, can one argue that the walls of the porch above extend downward (gud achis) to create halachic walls that enclose the bottom region as well and permit me to carry in this region? </p>\n\n\n",

Rishon Letzion was also known as a Chacham Bashi. And carried many similar day to day tasks. </p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<p>My great-grandfather, although not the Rishon Letzion, was a Chacham Bashi, both for the Turkish Army, and later the Av Beis Din of his hometown under the Ottomans in Macedonia - later becoming the independent state of Yugoslavia. He was student of the first Rishon Letzion of Palestine HaRav Yaakov Meir. </p>\n\n<p>His responsibilities included presiding over money matters in his Beit Din, marriages and divorce. He also was empowered with imposing fines upon those who transgressed Torah prohibitions. For example, when one person opened their store on shabbos, my grandfather placed a Cherem upon him until he paid a fine to the local Gemachim of the town.</p>\n\n<p>The Government gave tremendous leeway for each religious court and leaders to preform their duties (Christian, Muslim sharia, and batei Dinim).</p>\n\n<p>The entire idea of a Chacham Bashi was started by Sultan Mehemt II.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually the office of Hacham Bashi and Rishon Letzion were combined. As opposed to the Chacham Bashi residing in Constantinople. </p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakham_Bashi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the Ottoman Empire, and as such, the Hakham Bashi was the closest\n  thing to an overall Exilarchal authority among Jewry everywhere in the\n  Middle East in early modern times. They held broad powers to\n  legislate, judge and enforce the laws among the Jews in the Ottoman\n  Empire and often sat on the Sultan's divan.</p>\n  \n  <p>The office also maintained considerable influence outside the Ottoman\n  Empire, especially after the forced migration of numerous Jewish\n  communities and individuals out of Spain (after the fall of Granada in\n  1492) and Italy.</p>\n  \n  <p>In 1842, the position of \"Hakham Bashi\", Chief Rabbi of Constantinople\n  who represented the Turkish Jews before the Sultan, and the position\n  of Rishon LeZion which at that time already represented the Old Yishuv\n  before the Sultan, were combined into one position called Rishon\n  LeZion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tips for sitting holding a Sefer Torah without hurting your shoulder?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm occasionally asked in shul to take out the second Sefer Torah, which also involves holding it until it's needed.  I usually sit holding it with one eitz chayim resting on the chair between my legs, the other eitz chayim on the other side of my left leg, the top resting on my right shoulder, and my right arm around it.  By the end of the second aliyah, my right shoulder is always sore.</p>\n\n<p>I generally won't accept this kavod anymore, except on Chol Hamoed Pesach or Rosh Chodesh Chanuka, because it's too painful.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way of holding it that works better?  (I'm right handed, if it matters.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This probably depends in part on the size (<em>eitz</em> to <em>eitz</em> length, I mean) and weight of the <em>sefer torah</em>, but here's what people in my minyan do (and what I do personally) with a medium-sized scroll.  My description is for a left-handed person, but you can reverse it.</p>\n\n<p>Sit with your back against the back of the chair.  Place your left hand in front of you and under the \"disks\" at the bottom end of the <em>eitz</em>, so you're supporting weight without being poked.  Let the weight of the <em>sefer</em> lean against your left shoulder.  The <em>sefer</em> is not vertical; it's leaning against your shoulder, bottom out a bit.  (It's also slightly slanted across your body.)  For our scroll this does not result in an <em>eitz</em> poking you in the thigh; the distance between you hand under the disk and the end of the eitz is short enough that the <em>eitzim</em> themselves don't rest on anything.  If you need more stability, place your right hand on the front near the center.</p>\n\n<p>Sitting like this, it's easy to shift from left to right -- start by replacing the bottom hand, then slide your now-free left hand up to the middle of the scroll and shift the scroll from your left shoulder to your right.  (This does assume that you don't have a book in your free hand at the time.)</p>\n\n<p>If you have any special medical conditions that affect your ability to bear weight in certain places, you should of course consult your local physician.</p>\n\n\n",

Even if a person\n  attempts to be careful not to bring it into unclean areas, it is very\n  difficult to assure that it is never taken to the bathroom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, there <em>might</em> be room for leniency based on one side of a difference of opinion quoted in the aforementioned article  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Yaakov Ariel (B’oholah shel Torah siman 42) argues that perhaps\n  there is room to be lenient that not only may one wear jewelry or rings\n  (or sweat shirts) with Torah verses on it, it may even be permitted\n  to bring them into the bathroom, since perhaps the verses are intended\n  not as Torah content, but rather simply as an expression of friendship.\n  For example, the phrase of “Ani L’dodi V’dodi Li,” “Iam to my beloved\n  as my beloved is to me,”found on a ring may not have been intended to\n  refer specifically to the verse in Shir HaShirim(6:3),but rather is\n  simply being used as a “catch phrase”to demonstrate a person’s\n  affection or friendship for another individual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reason for Ein Onshim Min HaDin\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a concept that אין עונשים מן הדין that appears a bunch of times throughout Shas (Makkos 5b for example). It basically means we don't learn out punishments the same way we learn out obligations. For example, the Torah forbids relations with a half sister (Leviticus 20:14), so <em>kal vachomer</em> a full sister. Therefore I'd say just like there's the death penalty with a half sister, there should be with a full sister. However, אין עונשים מן הדין, so there needs to be something more explicit to enact punishment (which there is, Leviticus 20:17). (FYI it seems to be a machlokes between the Rambam and Ramban if this is exclusive to <em>kal vachomer</em> or also other types of drashos. See Hasagos HaRamban to Sefer HaMitzvos Shoresh Sheni where the Ramban seems to understand the Rambam applying this rule to all drashos, and the Ramban says it's only <em>kal vachomer</em>)</p>\n\n<p>My question is about the reasoning behind this idea. I assume there's some logic to it, and it's not simply a gezeiras hakasuv (although Mizrachi Vayikra 11:8 says it is), because I've heard explanations by the Maharsha (Sanhedrin 64b) and the Halichos Olam (Shaar 4 Klal 12).  Halichos Olam says because one could err in their kal vachomers, the Maharsha says because who says the kaparah for one will help the other. I was wondering if there are any other reasons out there. Especially since it seems according to the Rambam it's not only <em>kal vachomer</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

This is because it is a <strong>mitzvah</strong> for all men and women to <strong>see the writing and bow</strong> and say vezos hatorah, toras Hashem temimah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch brings this in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.134.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Simman 134:2</a>.

I'll paste the relevant parts:</p>\n<p>He brings the Shiltei HaGiborim Kiddushin 14b quoting the Riaz to justify the practice of not bowing</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחייבים לעמוד מפני הס\"ת \"אם מפני לומדיה עומדים מפניה לא כ\"ש\" (קידושין ל\"ג ע\"ב). ונראה בעיני שלא אמרו אלא לעמוד מפני התורה ולא להשתחוות לה ולא נמצא בכל התורה שמשתחוין אפילו לארון הקדש כמב\"ה</p>\n<p>One is obligated to stand before a sefer Torah. \"If we have to in front of those who learn it, all the more so before it\" (Kiddushin 33b). But it appears in my eyes they only said to stand, but not to bow and in the whole Torah we never saw an idea to bow, not even to the <em>Aron Kodesh</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However Rav Weiss brings from the Mahari Algazi (Emes LeYaakov on Kriyas HaTorah) who deflects the words of the Riaz and says according to the Zohar it is fitting to bow.</p>\n<p>Rav Weiss then brings the Chidah in Birkei Yosef (Simman 134:3) who brings the Knesses Hagedolah who notes people don't bow, yet in the end also rejects the Riaz. You see even in his days people weren't bowing.</p>\n<p>Rav Weiss finishes by bringing the Respona Maharikash who also says to bow. The former's conclusion is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומ\"מ נראה פשוט להלכה דיש לנהוג כמפורש בשו\"ע ובמס' סופרים ולא כשיטת הריא\"ז</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That it sounds from all these sources that it's the proper thing to do.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, as with all matters pertaining to halacha, CYLOR.</p>\n\n\n",

Sometimes on any given Saturday, our neighbors knock on our door and ask us to turn on the air conditioning, etc. We've always helped them out, not understanding the full reasoning behind this tradition.</p>\n<p>We have a good relationship with them but we are curious as to how they must view us. Why is it okay for them to ask us to \"work\" during their Sabbath? Do they then consider us inferior because we are doing these neighborly favors?</p>\n<p><strong>The Aish Rabbi Replies:</strong></p>\n<p>You are describing a phenomenon which is colloquially called a “Shabbos Goy.”</p>\n<p>In essence, your neighbors should not be asking you to do things for them, which they themselves are not allowed to do on Shabbat. This is a Talmudic principle, as derived from the Torah which states that on Shabbat, \"creative activity should not BE DONE for you\" - i.e. even if you are only asking someone else to do it.</p>\n<p>The only exceptions are: when there is a commandment to be fulfilled, great monetary loss, or a health-related situation. Air conditioning is considered health-related, because if things get too hot, people (especially the elderly, etc.) could faint or be exposed to other dangers.</p>\n<p>Even in the above-mentioned cases, a Jew is only allowed to ask a non-Jew to do a rabbinic-level action. (Mishnah Berurah 307:19-24)</p>\n<p>They certainly do not consider you inferior. Rather it is simple pragmatics: they are obligated in observing Shabbat laws that you are not. You can consider it a great kindness to be helping them out, just as any good neighbor would.</p>\n<p>In recent times, Colin Powell, Mario Cuomo, Martin Scorsese, and an adolescent Elvis Presley assisted their Jewish neighbors in this way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1140867/jewish/The-Myth-of-the-Shabbos-Goy.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article from Chabad.org</a>.</p>\n<p>But all those things aside, you would need to contact the rabbi of the particular community you are interested in servicing. You should tell him everything you have told us here. Then, if he is in need of your assistance, he can instruct you as to what work a non-Jew may do for a Jew on the Sabbath. Believe me, the laws can get complicated. Many religious Jews do not even know them.</p>\n<p>Note that not everyone community is in need of a Shabbos Goy, and not everyone wants one either. You are correct when you say the idea is sort of out-dated.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sitting by kadosh in purpose?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have seen this in sefardi shuls but I am not sure as to what the reasoning behind it is. By kaddish, (yasom, to be exact) the entire congregation sits down. Usually by Ashkenazic shuls it is generally accepted that all will stand up for every kaddish? Why do the halachos by sefardim vary and why specifically by kaddish yasom? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Along the same lines you noted the contrasting customs between Ashkenazim and Sefardim, Rabbi David Sperling <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=5755\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are different customs about standing or sitting for Kaddish. The\n  Rema writes in his additions to the Shulchan Aruch (O.H. 56, 1) \"One\n  should stand when they answer Kaddish\". This is, as you wrote in your\n  question, because it is counted as \"words of holiness\" (\"dvar\n  sh'bekedusha\") which should all be stood up for (see the Rema ibid).\n  However the Mishna Brurah there writes that there are those who say\n  one does not have to stand for Kaddish, unless one was already\n  standing. So, for example, the Kaddish after Hallel, when one is\n  already standing because of Hallel, one should remain standing. This\n  is how many Sephardim rule (see Yalkut Yosef, volume 1, p. 95). The\n  Mishna Brurah rules that one should be strict and stand for every\n  Kaddish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apparently, the custom of sitting may stem from not being obligated to stand, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30843/13811\">Hacham Gavriel</a> quotes \"The Arizal was not Makpid to stand during Kaddish (Shaar Hakawanot Daf 16 Amud 4 based on the Kaf HaHaim 56:20 and the Sefaradi Aharonim all agreed to this Pesak).\"</p>\n\n<p>For more information which might shed more light in general, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9308/13811\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37019/13811\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Since some of us had travelled from different parts of the country and hadn't seen each other for decades, we celebrated for hours before the show, some of us drinking, some of us smoking a substance that had recently been made completely legal to enjoy in that state.</p>\n\n<p>Along come a couple of Chabad folks, who immediately zeroed in on a couple of Jewish members of the group, trying to get them to lay tefillin.  This was in the middle of a huge crowd of concertgoers.  They ended up concentrating on one of us, who was doing his best to decline for what he thought were valid reasons - he was intoxicated in various directions and explained he would not be able to concentrate with proper kavanah, it was over 90 humid degrees out and he was sweaty and dirty, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Didn't matter to these guys.  They just kept hounding him, slipping candles into his pocket(which of course got confiscated during the entry search), and saying it was just fine to lay tefillin(which they couldn't tell us the last time a sofer checked them to see if they were pasul) in the midst of a raging, wasted crowd, while intoxicated and dirty/sweaty.  They kept pushing that it didn't matter, it was the mitzvah alone that counted.  It wasn't until we physically walked away and through the entry gates, after the music started (coincidentally, a song called \"Samson & Delilah\"), that he was left alone and the situation ended.</p>\n\n<p>So - my question is - when presented with extremely pushy people, what is the most polite way of declining?  The non-Jewish members of the crowd were ready to politely but firmly turn them around and make sure they kept walking away from us, but we did not let that happen. What words work best in a situation like this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The most effective way is to simply firmly and politely refuse without providing any explanation. Giving a justification for your refusal invites the pushy people to refute your justification. If you just say \"no\", they might try a few more times but if after repeating \"no\" a few times you say, \"Sorry, I'm not interested,\" they will most likely move on. You can only argue with \"no\" for so long.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Each situation needs a different approach, so I don't know if there is a general rule.</p>\n\n<p>Let's address your specific story, instead. I like Chaba\"d, but, from reading your story, I agree that I don't understand their thinking, here. I see no purpose in their forcing tefillin on intoxicated people. Jews being intoxicated publicly is a <em>Chilul Hashem</em> as it is. Putting tefillin on such people - I don't know, might just add to that problem. It doesn't accomplish any appreciation of performing the <em>mitzvah</em> anyway, b/c you're too drunk to understand what's going on.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, you could have explained that aspect to them, i.e., there's no mitzvah really being accomplished, here.</p>\n\n<p>As far as \"pushy\" Chaba\"d people (I sometimes get them in the subway), I would just tell them, I'm too busy now, and I'm just not comfortable. Do you have a brochure or other info where I can find out more? In many cases, the mere fact that you're willing to accept even a brochure from them will keep them happy, and they'll leave you alone.</p>\n\n<p>If you're in a busy place (like that subway station) where there are sure to be other Jews walking by, you can always tell them to try that other stranger!</p>\n\n\n",

Pagans regard their <em>gods</em> as beings which manifest various powers, somewhat like comic book characters (like the X-Men). They regard the concept of Hashem as <em>too lofty</em> to be connected to human beings and therefore worship the <em>powers</em> that have direct control or connection with the physical universe (see the Chabad citation at the end of this post).</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the courts, they are a group of people who have been given the <em>power</em> by Hashem to enforce the rules of the Torah. Thus, their connection to Hashem gives them the name <em>powers</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ohr.edu/4514\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Elokim</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This name of G-d is based on the Hebrew word “el” which means simply\n  “power” or “strength”. An example of this usage is in the description\n  of Lavan’s pursuing and confronting Jacob during his return to the\n  Land of Israel. Lavan says, “Yesh b’el yadi [sic] - It is in my power to do\n  you harm, but the G-d of your father addressed me last night [in a\n  dream] saying, ‘Beware of speaking with Jacob either bad or good’”\n  (Gen 31:29). Rashi and Onkelus both explain “el” to mean power or\n  strength.</p>\n  \n  <p>The name “Elokim”, then, in reference to G-d, connotes His complete\n  mastership and control over everything. </p>\n  \n  <p>A third usage of this term refers to judges. For example, if on\n  account of poverty or theft a Jewish man was indentured to work for a\n  Jewish master, then chose to stay in servitude despite being given the\n  opportunity to be released, he was to be brought before the “elohim” –\n  judges – who would order that the man’s ear be pierced symbolically\n  stating, “G-d says the Children of Israel are My servants; and this\n  one chooses to be a servant of a servant!” (Ex. 21:6).</p>\n  \n  <p>However, regarding this last usage, the commentaries suggest a\n  relationship with “Elokim”. Namely, the Torah court of judges is\n  called by the word for G-d since it carries out G-d’s laws on earth\n  (Ibn Ezra). Alternatively, because G-d’s Presence and influence rests\n  upon the judges (Ramban). This is based on the Sages’ explanation of\n  the verse “in the midst of judges (elohim) G-d will judge” (Psalms\n  82:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/638043/jewish/Why-is-Gd-Called-Elokim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why is G‑d Called \"Elokim\"?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They knew of this concept of Havaya, but they considered it far too\n  lofty an idea, seemingly inaccessible and irrelevant to their lives.\n  Instead, they connected to the many forces of nature.

Similarly, while some authorities have been lenient with regard to whiskey aged in nonkosher sherry casks, the controversial reasoning presented was that the sherry cask did not improve the taste of the whiskey, and therefore was not halachically significant.  This argument is harder to make with regard to sour beer, where the taste difference is significant and desired by those who prefer it.  See, e.g., <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/01/food/fo-sourbeer1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Patrick Rue launched the Bruery, his Belgian-style brewery in Placentia, last year, and sours have been a focus from the start. At its first-anniversary party in May, it had a four-tap sour bar, including Cuvee Jeune, a young lambic aged in Chardonnay barrels for 10 months. White Zin is a sweeter variation on Cuvee Jeune, blended with a brew made with Zinfandel grapes. Gypsy Tart was Rue's limited-edition Flanders red that was untouched by wood, and plenty sour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the same article, at least one sour beer brand may be less problematic than others:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Very few American brewers take the time (and risk) to let natural bacteria take its course, but that's what brew master Ron Jeffries is doing at Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales in Dexter, Mich. America's only 100% oak-aged sour brewery uses wild yeasts that appeared in the brewery naturally and spread from barrel to barrel during transfers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The following paragraph in the article also seems to suggest that Allagash Brewing Co. of Maine also produces a sour beer without resorting to additives.</p>\n\n<p>(Notably, the Talmud [Avoda Zara 31b] also prohibits drinking beer in a pub or bar, though later authorities suggest leniencies in certain contexts.)</p>\n\n<p>See also: \n<a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.com/2013/07/kashrus-of-scotch.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.com/2013/07/kashrus-of-scotch.html</a>\n<a href=\"http://israelbrewsandviews.blogspot.com/2013/12/what-makes-beer-kosher.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://israelbrewsandviews.blogspot.com/2013/12/what-makes-beer-kosher.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

I will talk about Dayo in connection with the Kal Ve Chomer. It is not exactly your example, but I’m suggesting that your example is comparable to mine, and that counter-arguments (like the one you suggest) are more proper to legal arguments than to the homiletic example in your quotation.</p>\n\n<p>Dayo is the principal limiting a rule (derived Kal Ve Chomer) to its strength in the original case. For some applications of Dayo in legal arguments in Nezikin, see Bava Kamma 24b to 25a; Bava Kamma 37b4 #21; Bava Kamma 63b4 #44; or Bava Basra 111a1 #10.

Compare this with the Mishnah Avos 6:3. 1) Dovid was an extraordinary man and a king of Israel; 2) while we are not; 3) Dovid showed respect to someone who taught him a few matters of Torah; 4) so we should do likewise; 5) and even respect a person who teaches us a single matter of Torah.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that each of these violates the Principle of Dayo.

You're bringing in something that the kal doesn't have.</p>\n\n<p>2) Let's say this kind of pircha goes. Then לבנה תוכיח! In the aggada in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.60b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hullin 60b</a>, the moon, which presumably has as much free will as a rock, challenges and retorts Hashem's commandments.

Actually what is the meaning of not eating stuff with blood in it? Is it because you can't eat things when they are alive?</p>\n\n<p>To be more exact here</p>\n\n<p>Are we prohibited to eat</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Cooked blood</li>\n<li>Living animal</li>\n<li>Both</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As with all mitzvos, there are various reasons suggested.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah says in various ways כי דם הוא הנפש (Vayikra 17:11, Vayikra 17:14, Devarim 12:23), the soul is connected to the blood of a living creature.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer HaChinuch (#148) says the reason is the same as he gave for the prohibition against treifos (#73) and forbidden fats (#147) (that they are physically harmful to the body, and we need healthy bodies to serve Hashem).</p>\n\n<p>However, he adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מלבד רע מזגו, שהוא רע המזג, יהיה באכילתו קצת קנין במדת אכזריות, שיבלע האדם מבעלי-החיים שכמותו בגוף, אותו הדבר שבהם שהחיות ממש תלוי עליו, ונפשם נקשרת בו. </p>\n  \n  <p>Besides its evil nature (because [blood] is evil in nature), there will be in eating it a slight acquisition of the trait of cruelty. [Why?] This is from swallowing from living animals that which is similar to his own body, meaning that which his lifesource is dependent on and soul is bound to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He also brings the explanation of the Ramban (Vayikra 17:11) that everything we eat is converted into the body. If a person eats blood, there will be עובי וגסות הרוח (I'd translate that as haughtiness, although I'm not sure) which enters the soul of a person. This is because the נפש (which is in the blood) of animals is עבה וגסה. He also agrees with the Chinuch that it is not fitting for a נפש to eat a נפש</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Torah basically tells us the reason. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0317.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 17:10-12</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאִישׁ אִישׁ מִבֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל, וּמִן-הַגֵּר הַגָּר בְּתוֹכָם, אֲשֶׁר יֹאכַל, כָּל-דָּם--וְנָתַתִּי פָנַי, בַּנֶּפֶשׁ הָאֹכֶלֶת אֶת-הַדָּם, וְהִכְרַתִּי אֹתָהּ, מִקֶּרֶב עַמָּהּ. כִּי נֶפֶשׁ הַבָּשָׂר, בַּדָּם הִוא, וַאֲנִי נְתַתִּיו לָכֶם עַל-הַמִּזְבֵּחַ, לְכַפֵּר עַל-נַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶם:  כִּי-הַדָּם הוּא, בַּנֶּפֶשׁ יְכַפֵּר.   עַל-כֵּן אָמַרְתִּי לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, כָּל-נֶפֶשׁ מִכֶּם לֹא-תֹאכַל דָּם; וְהַגֵּר הַגָּר בְּתוֹכְכֶם, לֹא-יֹאכַל דָּם.‏<br>\n  And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set My face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life. <strong>Therefore I said unto the children of Israel: No soul of you shall eat blood,</strong> neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, the blood of an animal is designated for ritual purposes, so we shouldn't eat it. We see the same phenomenon by the prohibition on eating suet which is also designated for ritual use in the Temple, as earlier in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0307.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 7:23-26</a> it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דַּבֵּר אֶל-בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, לֵאמֹר:  כָּל-חֵלֶב שׁוֹר וְכֶשֶׂב, וָעֵז--לֹא תֹאכֵלוּ. וְחֵלֶב נְבֵלָה וְחֵלֶב טְרֵפָה, יֵעָשֶׂה לְכָל-מְלָאכָה; וְאָכֹל, לֹא תֹאכְלֻהוּ. כִּי, כָּל-אֹכֵל חֵלֶב, מִן-הַבְּהֵמָה, אֲשֶׁר יַקְרִיב מִמֶּנָּה אִשֶּׁה לַיהוָה--וְנִכְרְתָה הַנֶּפֶשׁ הָאֹכֶלֶת, מֵעַמֶּיהָ. וְכָל-דָּם לֹא תֹאכְלוּ, בְּכֹל מוֹשְׁבֹתֵיכֶם, לָעוֹף, וְלַבְּהֵמָה. כָּל-נֶפֶשׁ, אֲשֶׁר-תֹּאכַל כָּל-דָּם--וְנִכְרְתָה הַנֶּפֶשׁ הַהִוא, מֵעַמֶּיהָ.‏<br>\n  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it. For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note the prohibition on blood is repeated there in the same section.</p>\n\n<p>The remaining question is why is blood prohibited in all animals and birds while suet is only prohibited in animals offered as sacrifices in the Temple? The simple answer is suet only serves a ritual role in those animals, while the blood serves a ritual role (via slaughtering) in all animals and birds. (One could even argue that what we think of as ordinary slaughtering outside the Temple is really a type of quasi-Korban, cf. Deuteronomy 14.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question is very unclear, but since the others took it as a general question about the purpose of the prohibition of eating blood, i will provide the relevant sources.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Ramban</strong>: Blood is the force of life and the soul of the living, it belongs to god alone, that is why a human being should not eat blood: one who possesses a soul shall not eat a soul (ואין לבעל נפש שיאכל נפש). He adds that blood may be prohibited because it is reserved for the altar (or god), and is similar to the prohibition of the fats (according to this understanding, the blood of the wild animals are prohibited so that we don't come to eat the blood of the sacrificial animals. Apparently the Ramban wasn't comfortable with this reason alone so he added another. Ramban vayikra 17:11-12). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rambam</strong>: the pagans used to eat blood in order to connect to the demons believing that it enables them to see the future, that is why the Torah prohibited it (Rambam Moreh 3, 46).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chinuch</strong>: because the blood can physically harm the person that consumes it. The Ramban explains it similarly: the food that a person eats becomes part of him, if he eats the blood of the animal (which is the living force of the animal) he will become coarse/crude like an animal, and the blood will produce a thickness/coarseness within him (עובי וגסות Chinuch 148).   </p>\n\n<p><strong>C. M. Carmichael</strong>: Blood symbolizes life, the flesh symbolizes death (since it rots and disintegrates after death), That's why the Israelite's shall not mix them together in their food. The blood prohibition comes to emphasize the separation between life and death, and that they should choose life over death. In a similar vein he explains the prohibition of eating the kid and its mother's milk, and many others. The concept of choosing life over death is clearly expressed in Devarim 30:19. This may be the motive behind the prohibition of eating blood since it is mixing life and death together and blurring the distinction between them. (C. M. Carmichael, “On Separating Life and Death: An Explanation of Some Biblical Laws”, HTR 69 (1976), pp. 1-7). </p>\n\n\n",

They too are trying to be G-d fearing Jews and to serve HaShem even if according to many, they are misguided.</p>\n<p>The essence of the argument is that the final redemption is only supposed to be by G-d directly, unlike all the previous periods of redemption. There is no mitzvah currently to settle the land and that those Jews who have taken possession of the land have done this not to fulfill the Torah, but to deny it. The secular government of the state of Israel is viewed as a government that to a large extent is based upon apikorsus. So all the halachic ideas behind milchemet mitzvah (like a defensive war) for a halachically legitimate government do not apply, particularly with the danger to life by serving in the army. The argument of Bitul Torah only reinforces that position.

    "content": "# Do \"triple washed\" salad greens need to be inspected for bugs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen a few bags of salad greens marked \"triple washed\". I did a Google search and there seems to be some debate on whether it needs to be rewashed after you buy it. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/washing-bagged-salad-produce-triple-washed-2016-7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you've ever grown lettuce or been in a field of it, you know that\n  greens grow pretty close to the ground and can have a hefty amount of\n  dirt on them.</p>\n  \n  <p>So producers wash their greens before they bag them.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Many precut, bagged, or packaged produce items are prewashed and\n  ready to eat,\" according to the FDA. \"If so, it will be stated on the\n  packaging, and you can use the produce without further washing.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The triple-washed process doesn't just use water; it also uses\n  sanitizers to kill bacteria and other pathogens</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm uncertain what to make of this in terms of halacha. The washing kills bacteria. I'm assuming that if it kills bacteria, it must be killing the bugs, too, but it's unclear how thoroughly this washing is eliminating dead bugs.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know what actually happens, and if one can use these types of products without having to inspect the leaves yourself?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>From a lecture heard at the STAR-K, given by Rabbi Tendler, there is no qualification halacha-wise for what \"triple wash\" means since there is no industry guarantee regarding what triple wash is consistently and across companies. Technically, you could check the company's triple wash and see if there are bugs, but that might not even allow you to eat the produce next time as different crops in different fields have different levels of infestation.    </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/insect-checking/1754/why-check-for-insects/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article from Star K</a> categorises vegetables into groups -</p>\n\n<p>1) Permitted without washing or checking    </p>\n\n<p>2) Permitted only after peeling and/or washing    </p>\n\n<p>3) Permitted only after checking    </p>\n\n<p>4) Not recommended due to the difficulties inherent in checking properly.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/images/pdf/bugchecking_may17.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> shows that for lettuce and other leafy vegetables, checking is necessary (they recommend the \"thrip cloth\" method) and washing or rinsing well is insufficient. The article says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If insects are still found on the third try, the produce should not be\n  used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Star K seep to accept the possibility that after washing (with water and a non-bleach and non-toxic dishwasher detergent solution) insects can still be found (in which case the produce must be discarded). </p>\n\n<p>I conclude that triple-washing will not be sufficient at least for Star K. </p>\n\n<p>CYLOR.</p>\n\n<p>BTW the \"thrip cloth\" method does not require examination of the leaves only the wash water. </p>\n\n\n",

Thus the answer to your first question, if the Torah discusses how to put on tefillin, is no. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Oral Torah always has much more to say than the Written one. In Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, simanim 25 - 45, discusses the halachos of tefillin.

    "title": "Who inherits if a man and wife die together?",
    "content": "# Who inherits if a man and wife die together?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Bava Batra 158a talks in the mishna about the case where a man and his wife (with no children) die together. The heirs of the man claim that the woman died first so they inherit everything, while the heirs of the wife claim that the man died first so they inherit.  Beit Shammai says they divide the estate, while Beit Hillel says that the wife's heirs inherit what was hers (e.g. dowry) and the man's heirs inherit what was his.</p>\n\n<p>I've been taught that Beit Hillel almost always wins these disputes.  In the g'mara here (158b), Reish Lakish in the name of Bar Kappara says they divide -- he seems to be supporting Beit Shammai.  Nobody here says otherwise.  The daf then goes on to the next mishna. which talks about a related case (a man and his mother die together).  This made me wonder how the question is ultimately resolved.</p>\n\n<p>What is the <em>halacha</em> (assuming there have been no specific directives)?  Do they divide the estate per Shammai or do they resolve each part of the estate per Hillel?  The <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8114-inheritance\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jewish Encyclopedia article on inheritance</a> doesn't talk about this special case, nor does this <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/category/ask/monetary-law-and-charity/inheritance-and-wills/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">set of Q&A about inheritance law that I found</a>.  Those were the most-promising results I found in searching.  I don't yet know how to navigate Shulchan Aruch (where I would expect to find something).</p>\n\n<p>This is not a practical matter for me; I'm just curious after I came across this passage and tried unsuccessfully to follow it to an answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Your friend here is the commentary called \"עין משפט נר מצוה -- <a href=\"https://people.ucalgary.ca/%7Eelsegal/TalmudMap/EMNM.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ein Mishpat Ner Mitzva</a>\" located in the upper corner of any standard Talmud page that has a legal ruling on it which is brought by either Maimonides or the Shulchan Arukh. It should be right next to the page number. The mark in the text which references to it is a superscript non-rashi-script Hebrew letter right in the Gemara before the text being ruled like, starting with א for the first ruling on each page. In your case, we see the little א next to Beit Hillel's comment on 158a and next to Bar Kapara's comment on 158b. This is a strong indication that the Halakha is like them.</p>\n<p>Following up to the corner, we look at the note next to the א which was being referenced. On 158a we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מיי׳ פ״ה מהל׳ נחלות הל׳ ו סמג עשין צו טוש\"ע אה״ע סי׳ צ סעיף ו‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This looks cryptic, but if you remember a few abbreviations you can find what you need, and it helps that the format of these notes is very consistent as you'll quickly notice. מיי is short for מיימון AKA Maimonides. סמג is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_ben_Jacob_of_Coucy\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</a>. טוש״ע is short for טור שלחן ערוך ie. the Tur and Shulchan Arukh which use similar sectioning.</p>\n<p>Knowing this, the above comment becomes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מיימון פרק ה הלכות נחלות הלכה ו. ספר מצות גדול עשה צו. טור שלחן ערוך אבן העזר סימן צ סעיף ו<br />\nMaimonides Laws of Inheritance 5:6. Sefer Mitzvot Gadol positive command #96. Tur/ShA Even HaEzer 90:6.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And those are the places you can find that ruling of Beit Hillel's recorded. (Try yourself now understanding the note on 158b. It should be <em>very</em> similar since these are very related laws.)</p>\n<p>Here's Maimonides' ruling <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1170534/jewish/Nachalot-Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי שנפל הבית עליו ועל אשתו, ואין ידוע אם האישה מתה תחילה, ונמצאו יורשי הבעל יורשין כל נכסיה, או הבעל מת תחילה, ונמצאו יורשי האישה יורשין כל נכסיה--כיצד דינם:  מעמידין נכסי מלוג בחזקת יורשי האישה, והכתובה עיקר ותוספת בחזקת יורשי\nהבעל; וחולקין בנכסי צאן ברזל, יורשי האישה נוטלין חציין ויורשי הבעל חציין.‏<br />\nThe following rules apply when a house fell on a person and his wife and they both died. It is not known if the woman died first, in which instance the heirs of her husband inherit her entire estate, or the husband died first, and the woman's heirs inherit her estate.</p>\n<p>How is the issue resolved? We consider the nichsei m'log to be in the possession of the woman's heirs. The money due her by virtue of her ketubah - both the essential obligation and the additional amount - are considered to be in the possession of her husband's heirs. Her nichsei tzon barzel are divided, half are given to the woman's heirs and half to the husband's heirs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems (and you can see this in Rashbam's commentary on the Mishna) that the discussion in the Gemara was about whose Chazaka the Nikhsei Tzon Barzel are in, and the conclusion is a doubt so we split. But in principle we agree with Beit Hillel so for the Nikhsei Milog and the Ketubba which have a clear Muchzak, they win. (Of course there could be other ways other Rishonim understand the Mishna and Gemara, but this seems to resolve your confusion.)</p>\n\n\n",

The emphasis on “with you” suggests that only someone who was already presumed by you to be a valid convert should be accepted as a convert. If he came and brought witnesses to his conversion with him, from where is it derived that he is to be accepted?

The verse states “with you,” which indicates that in any place that he is with you, you should accept him. If so, what is the meaning when the verse states: In the land?

When Israel received the torah a few generations later, the tribe of Levi was set aside for service to God, and within the tribe of Levi, Aharon and his the descendants were designated exclusively as priests (<em>kohanim</em>).  The <em>kohanim</em> are the only legitimate priests in Judaism since the giving of the torah.  Anybody descended from or seeking to emulate Malkitzedek, who is not also a <em>kohein</em>, has no priestly status in Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>You asked how Paul's message would have been understood by Jews of his time.  Jews who read the entire verse you cited would have rejected the heresy wholesale.  I've bolded the parts that are especially problematic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>If perfection could have been attained</strong> through the Levitical priesthood—and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there <strong>still need for another priest</strong> to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, <strong>not in the order of Aaron</strong>?

There was no \"need\" for a new priest.  And a \"priest\" explicitly <em>not</em> descended from Aharon is not a priest.  In Paul's time Jews had already been keeping the torah for more than a thousand years; they knew this and would not have been swayed by his assertions that the torah could be superseded.</p>\n\n<p>Early Christianity, on the other hand, needed to explain how their non-<em>kohein</em> founder was salvivic, and there were other benefits to delegitimizing or superseding both torah and the priesthood.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_of_Melchizedek#In_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> has some interesting information about this subject (lightly edited):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Law of Moses stipulates that only the male descendants of Aaron be\n  commissioned to serve as Jewish priests before the God of Israel and\n  the Jewish nation. This commission is in Judaism \"a\n  covenant of everlasting priesthood\" (\"<em>berit kehunat olam</em>,\" Num. 25:13) and not eligible for replacement by other tribes of Israel... \n  Although the Book of Genesis affirms that Melchizedek was\n  \"priest of God Most High\" (Gen. 14:18), The Midrash and Babylonian\n  Talmud maintain that the priesthood held by Melchizedek, who pre-dated\n  Aaron by six generations (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehoth, Amram, Aaron),\n  was given in his stead to Abraham who in turn passed it on to his\n  descendants... Midrashic literature attributes this transition as a consequence due to Melchizedek preceding the name of Abraham to that of God, such as in the Midrash Rabbah to Genesis and Tractate Nedarim (<a href=\"http://halakhah.com/nedarim/nedarim_32.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32b</a>), while some Jewish commentators, such as Chaim ibn Attar, write that Melchizedek gave the priesthood to Abraham willingly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The other answer here has the basics on the Melchizedek in Genesis and the Kohanim as the only legitimate Jewish priests.</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 7 of Hebrews is an attempt by \"Paul\"(authorship of this particular letter by him has been disputed by some of the earliest church commentators, Eusebius, for example) to try and prove that Yeshu was the new, permanent High Priest, even though he was from the Tribe of Judah. I'm not going to go over it line by line, the whole chapter is <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%207&version=NIV\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, but the basic idea is that \"Paul\" writes that Melchizedek \"resembles the Son of God\", then tries to show that by Abraham's tithing to Melchizedek, and the quote of Psalm 110:4:</p>\n\n<p>\"The Lord swore and will not repent, you are a priest forever after the manner(JPS)/order(most non-Jewish translations) of Melchizedek\" </p>\n\n<p>that(as is usual in their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersessionism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">supercessionist</a> theology)the \"Old Covenant\", and the Levitical Priesthood, have been replaced by the \"New Covenant\", and that Yeshu is the new, permanent high priest, who offered himself as sacrifice for everyone's sins, etc.</p>\n\n<p>At Qumran in cave 11 they found a badly worn text 11QMelchizedek, in which he seems to have a priestly/Messianic role(hard to tell for certain from the condition of the manuscript), so there were extra-Biblical legends floating around about him in Late Second Temple times. Some Qumran texts also mention his direct opposite, Melchiresha. Melchizedek also appears a few centuries later on as the subject of one of the Gnostic Nag Hammadi tracts. </p>\n\n\n",

He answers that it is talking about someone who was mevatel Torah in order to do mitzvos, as per the general rule that performance of mitzvos overrides Torah study. Thus, the person has not sinned by shirking Torah study. However, since God desires his Torah study He afflicts him because one who is in pain is exempt from mitzvos. However, Torah study is the exception to this; one is never exempt from Torah study no matter his physical condition. As Rambam writes in Hilchos Talmud Torah 1:8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל איש מישראל חייב בתלמוד תורה בין עני בין עשיר בין שלם בגופו בין בעל\n  יסורין בין בחור בין שהיה זקן גדול שתשש כחו אפילו היה עני המתפרנס מן\n  הצדקה ומחזר על הפתחים ואפילו בעל אשה ובנים חייב לקבוע לו זמן לתלמוד\n  תורה ביום ובלילה שנאמר והגית בו יומם ולילה</p>\n  \n  <p>Every Jewish man is obligated to study Torah, whether he is poor or\n  rich, whether his body is healthy and whole or afflicted by\n  difficulties, whether he is young or an old man whose strength has\n  diminished.</p>\n  \n  <p>Even if he is a poor man who derives his livelihood from charity and\n  begs from door to door, even if he is a husband and [a father of]\n  children, he must establish a fixed time for Torah study during the\n  day and at night, as [Joshua 1:8] commands: \"You shall think about it\n  day and night.\" (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910973/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, by giving this person afflictions God exempts him from other mitzvos and he can now devote himself to Torah study. Had he not received the afflictions he would be stuck doing other mitzvos and would be unable to devote himself to Torah study. Thus, the Gemara means that if one cannot find any sins that he has committed he should assume that God is trying to enable him to learn more Torah by freeing him from other mitzvah obligations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה לי לפרש בזה מה שאמרו פ\"ק דברכות הרואה אדם יסורים באים עליו יפשפש\n  במעשיו פשפש ולא מצא יתלה בביטול תורה והדבר הקשה הוא וכי ביטול תורה\n  אינו חטא כלל עד שאמר פשפש ולא מצא ויראה לי על פי מה שאמרו כי טוב יום\n  בחצריך מאלף כי טוב יום שהי' דוד עוסק בתורה מאלף עולות שהקריב שלמה המלך\n  ע\"ה והיינו שחביב לימוד התורה לפני הקב\"ה יותר מכל המצות אמנם כל אדם\n  בריא חייב בכל המצות וכ\"ש דוד המלך ע\"ה שהי' מוטל עליו צרכי ציבור בהנהגת\n  המלכות והי' מוכרח לבטל קצת מעסק לימוד התורה לכן הקב\"ה חפץ דכאו כדי\n  שיהא פטור מכל המצות ויעסוק בתורה שאף חולה אינו פטור מזה וזהו שאמר טוב\n  לי כי עניתי למען אלמד חקיך והיינו שהי' מעונה כדי שיוכל לעסוק בתורה וכן\n  הוא אומר אשרי הגבר אשר תיסרנו יה ומתורתך תלמדנו דהיינו שלא באו היסורים\n  על עון רק כדי שיוכל לעסוק בתורה שהוא פטור משאר המצות וזהו שאמרו יפשפש\n  במעשיו אס לא באו היסורים על חטא פשפש ולא מצא יתלה בביטול תורה שהקב\"ה\n  חפץ דכאו כדי שיהא פטור מן המצות המבטלות אותו מלימוד התורה והביאו מן\n  הפסוק הזה אשרי הגבר אשר תיסרנו יה ומתורתך תלמדנו והיינו כמו שבארנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This question is also asked by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Each person, therefore, makes his own assessment of how many hours he should be learning and how many hours he should be working. However, it is possible that the person might err in his assessment, and assign more time for working than is actually necessary. In such a case, God will give him afflictions, and if he sees that he has no sins he should assume that God is telling him that he made a mistake in his assessment and he could really be devoting more time to Torah study.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מקשים כיון שיש בידו עון ביטול תורה שהיא חמור איך פשפש ולא מצא ונ\"ל\n  בס\"ד כי האדם אינו מחויב לעסוק כל היום בתורה כי הרבה עשו כרשב\"י ולא\n  עלתה בידם אך צריך לקבוע לו שעות לעסק התורה ושאר שעות יעסוק במלאכתו\n  להביא לחם ביתו אבל זה העסק באמת אין שיעורו שוה אצל כל אדם שיש אדם\n  יספיק לו לצורך פרנסתו עסק שתי שעות ויש ארבע ויש יותר אך כל אדם צריך\n  לשער כפי אומד דעתו כמה שעות ביום יספיקו לו לצורך פרנסתו ויעסוק בהם\n  ואפשר שהוא טועה באומד זה שיעשה אומד שעה או חצי שעה יותר ממה שצריך והוא\n  אינו מרגיש בזה לכך אם פשפש ולא מצא יתלה בביטול תורה כי יאמר ודאי טעיתי\n  באומד ואני עוסק שעה או חצי שעה יותר ממה שצריך לי ונמצא אני בטלתי עסק\n  התורה בהם שלא לצורך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If he examined his deeds and did not find anything, attribute it to Bitul Torah, as it is stated (Tehillim 94:12), 'Happy is the man whom You punish, Hashem, and teach out of Your Law.' And if he did attribute [it to Bitul Torah] but did not find [that to be so], it must be afflictions of love, as it is stated (Mishlei 3:12), 'For whom Hashem loves, He rebukes.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize: When one is suffering, he should (1) see if he has any sins. If he doesn't, (2) it must be Bitul Torah, and if that's not true, either, (3) it must be afflictions of love.</p>\n<p>What are \"afflictions of love\"? <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Berakhot.5a.14-17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Later down on the same amud</a>, the Gemara records a debate between R' Yaakov bar Idi and R' Acha bar Chanina (it's not sure who said which) that either it's afflictions that don't prevent Torah learning (but could prevent davening) or afflictions that don't prevent davening (but could prevent Torah learning). There is a third opinion brought there (R' Abba bar R' Chiya bar Abba in the name of his father in the name of R' Yochanan) that afflictions of love could prevent both.</p>\n<p>What if one is suffering, but able to daven and learn, and is unable to attribute it to any sin in particular? What kind of suffering is that? It's not an atonement for sin, nor is it an affliction of love, so what is it?</p>\n<p>To give an example of what I am talking about, say a person is in the hospital. He's able to daven, and he's able to learn, but he's not able to do much else.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your question appears to be based on an incorrect premise which is contadicted from your second paragraph (not counting the quote) to your third paragraph.</p>\n\n<p>The debate in the Gemara is about the maximum limit for \"afflictions of love\". One amora says that if the afflictions are so intense that they prevent Torah study they cannot be afflictions of love. But as long as the person can still study Torah the afflictions can be afflictions of love. The other amora says that the limit is whether the person is still able to engage in prayer. As long as he can, the afflictions can be considered afflictions of love.</p>\n\n<p>This is indeed how you seem to have understood it in your second paragraph. But then in your third paragraph you seem to have reversed it and you assume that afflictions of love are <strong>only</strong> if Torah or prayer is prevented, hence your question of what kind of suffering it is when Torah and prayer are not prevented.</p>\n\n<p>But as per your second paragraph, and the simple reading of the Gemara, this is precisely the case of afflictions of love. You did not find any sins to attribute it to and it's not affecting your Torah/prayer, which is exactly when the Gemara says בידוע שיסורין של אהבה הם.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Marasha learns that the point of the sugya is that really there is no one that doesn't have some sins, and there is no one that can learn 24 hours a day.  Even King David eventually stopped learning the day he died (see Shabbos 30).  But sometimes it seems like our suffering is disproportionate to what we feel we've done.  From this the gemarrah learns that \"whoever God desires he brings suffering on him\" - so that punishment comes in this world and not in the world to come.</p>\n\n<p>In more specific regards to your question, the gemarrah comes out throughout Taanis that we really don't understand suffering in this world, but we must do our best to stay connected to God and cry out when appropriate.  So I don't think you'll ever be sure if suffering that comes to you is an \"affliction of love\", but as long as you accept it, and you stay connected to God, even if you are angry with God and don't understand why things happen the way they do, you will אי\"ה get what you are supposed to get out of your experience, and your reward will be very great.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who did what at the story of the destruction of S'dom and Amorah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would like to ask two questions with regards to the context I applied with these questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Who is who?</li>\n<li>What happened to the third men/malach?</li>\n<li>Who did destroy S'dom and Amorah?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Genesis 18:1 tells us that <em>HaShem</em> appeared unto Avraham in the terebinth trees of Mamre.</p>\n\n<p>And then the story continues: \nGenesis 18:2 And Avraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and, hinei, <em>three man</em> (shloshah anashim) stood over against him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed down to the earth and said: '<em>My lord</em> (singular), if now I have found favour <em>in thy sight</em> (singular), pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant. </p>\n\n<p>After some lovely meal the story goes on:\nGenesis 18:16 And <em>the men</em> rose up from thence, and looked out toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. </p>\n\n<p>On this point in time HaShem is wondering wether He should inform Avraham of His plans with S'dom and Amorah, i.e. that He would go down and see whether they have done altogether according to the crying out [for punishment] of it, which has come unto Him, and if not HaShem would know.  </p>\n\n<p>And then this is what happens: Genesis 18:22 And <em>the men</em> turned their faces from thence, and went toward S’dom; <em>but Avraham stood yet before HaShem</em>. And after a conversation with HaShem the text reads: Genesis 18:33 And <em>HaShem</em> went His way, as soon as He had left communing with Avraham; and Avraham returned unto his place.</p>\n\n<p>The story picks up at Genesis 19:1 And <em>two malachim</em> came to S'dom, and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he fell down on his face to the earth (quite similar reaction as Avraham had). \nand he said: \"Behold now, my lords (plural), turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house..\"</p>\n\n<p>In Genesis 19:12 (and other verses before) these malachim are described as <em>men</em> and they tell Lot to take his family and bring them out of this place.\n(verse 13:) for they will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before the HaShem; and <em>HaShem hath sent us to destroy it</em>.' \nGenesis 19:14 And Lot went out, and spoke and said: 'Get up and go out of this place; <em>for HaShem will destroy</em> the city.' </p>\n\n<p>Genesis 19:15 And when the morning arose, then the <em>malachim</em> (heavenly messengers) hastened Lot, saying: 'Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here; lest thou be swept away in the iniquity of the city.But he lingered; and <em>the men</em> laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him. And they brought him forth, and set him without the city.</p>\n\n<p>Lot prays to HaShem and is heard. </p>\n\n<p>Genesis 19:24 Then <em>HaShem caused</em> to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire <em>from HaShem out of heaven</em></p>\n\n<p>Genesis 19:27 And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before HaShem. And he looked out toward S'dom and Amorah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace. And it came to pass, <em>when G-d destroyed</em> the cities of the plain, that G-d remembered Abraham (plead with Him), and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow (because of his rightousness?), <em>when He overthrew</em> the cities in which Lot dwelt. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer to your question, <strong><em>“What happened to the third men/malach?”</em></strong> is I suggest answered by Rashi to 18 (33).\nThe possuk says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the Lord departed when He finished speaking to Abraham, and\n  Abraham returned to his place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(And the Lord departed, etc.: Since the defender was silent, the Judge\n  left.)</p>\n  \n  <p>and Abraham returned to his place: The Judge left, the defender left,\n  and the prosecutor is accusing. Therefore: “And the two angels came to\n  Sodom,” to destroy (Gen. Rabbah 49:14). One to destroy Sodom and one\n  to save Lot, and he [the latter] is the same one who came to heal\n  Abraham, </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>but the third one, who came to announce [Isaac’s birth] to Sarah, since he had performed his mission, he departed</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Tan. Vayera 8).</p>\n\n<p>The answer to your question <strong><em>“Who did destroy S'dom and Amorah?”</em></strong> is Hashem. It's clearly stated in 19 (24 and 27) which you quote. But to understand it better look at the comment of Rashi to 19 (22). The Malach who thought he would destroy the cities says to Lot,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Hasten, flee there, for I will not be able to do anything until you\n  arrive there.\" Therefore, he named the city Zoar.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>on which Rashi says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hasten, flee there, for I will not be able to do: This is the angels’\n  punishment because they said (verse 13): “For we are destroying,” and\n  they attributed the matter to themselves; therefore they did not move\n  from there until they were compelled to say that the matter was not in\n  their power. — [based on Gen. Rabbah 50:9]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and Rashi clarifies the roles of the malachim saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>for I will not be able: [This expression is] in the singular. From\n  here you learn that one was to overturn [the cities] and one was to\n  save [Lot and his family], because two angels are not sent for one\n  mission. — [from Gen. Rabbah 50:2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your first question <strong><em>\"Who is who\"</em></strong> is at least partailly answered from the above.</p>\n\n\n",

This could involve any phrase or sign or action. Since most communication by people is verbal, that is the usual reference.</p>\n\n<p>An example of this is that people leave the shul for Yizkor if both parents are alive. This is not that they do not want to be present during the memorializing of the dead, but that it looks as though they are deliberately refraining from tefilah. This action is like <em>al tiftach peh lasatan</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen references to <em>do not smoke</em> as involving <em>al tiftach peh lasatan</em> because one is endangering ones health.

It is brought down\n  by the Talmud (Ketuvot 8b, Brachot 19a) and refers to the idea of not\n  inviting misfortune. In Brachot, it is part of a discussion on the\n  obligation to say the Shema Yisrael prayer (which is time related),\n  during a funeral, and the idea of mentioning how we ourselves have\n  sinned and not been punished. Abaye said “Don’t even say it since we\n  learned from Rav Jose ‘Leolam al yiftach adam piv lasatan’ - Never\n  open your mouth for the devil – which could invite punishment. This\n  phrase, by the way, is totally universal and can be found in dozens of\n  languages and cultures from Thai to Swedish to Irish. Similar to the\n  Hebrew idea of tempting fate, we find it in medieval English as \"Speak\n  of the devil and he doth appear.\" The idea behind this seems to be the\n  superstition that by mentioning the devil by name you can cause harm.\n  Today, in most cultures, the phrase is far more lighthearted,\n  referring to a person who shows up when you mention him. In Hebrew\n  that phase would be “Medabrim al ha-chamor, (ve-hinei hu ba)\" -\n  Talking about the donkey, (and here he comes).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, the article continues: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the pieces of potato or meat are large enough so that they are\n  consumed individually without any grains, they require their own\n  brachos both before and after consumption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I infer that since it mentions \"potato\", above, which is <em>adamah</em>, the rule should apply to beans which is also <em>adamah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, if one were to eat the beans separately, and they are large pieces such that no barley would be on the forkful, then one neds a separate bracha of <em>admah</em> on the beans.</p>\n\n<p>(FYI, this 2nd rule applies to all mixtures. Generally, one goes after the majority ingredient or \"main\" ingredient. However, if one intentionally eats each ingredient separately and enjoys each one separately, then, he must make separate brachot, despite the fact that it is a mixture. This scenario is quite common when eating a fruit \"salad\" that has mainly, e.g., assorted melons, but also some grapes and one eats and enjoys both separately. )</p>\n\n\n",

Nor could he afford to hire a shepherd in order to take care of his sheep. This is unlike Yisro who was being blackballed by the local shepherds so that his daughters were forced to take care of his sheep (which required all seven of them). Lavan had so few sheep that his youngest daughter was able to take care of them.

There are meforshim who say that since they had not been born before he came, they only saw the wealth that he had gained from Hashem and thought that their father had always been rich.</p>\n\n<p>Of course part of that was because Lavan kept complaining and refusing to acknowledge the <em>good fortune</em> that Yaakov had brought him, while at the same time scheming to prevent him from leaving in order that the <em>blessing</em> would continue.</p>\n\n<p>Art Scroll Chumash <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8224#v=9&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeitzei 29:9</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי רֹעָה הִוא <em>For she was a shepherdess</em>. Rachel tended the flocks\n  alone, for Lavan had no other shepherd. Leah did not share this chore,\n  either because the sun might have been harmful to her weak eyes [see\n  verse 17], or because she was older, and Lavan was afraid to let her\n  mingle with the shepherds. Rachel however, was still too young to\n  arouse the interest of the shepherd boys. (<em>Ramban</em>)</p>\n  \n  <p>The verse implies that Rachel came leading all of Lavan's sheep, which\n  indicates that the flock was small. Indeed, Lavan became prosperous\n  only after Jabob began working for him [see 30:30].

And thither were all the flocks gathered; and they rolled (withdrew) the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep, and put the stone back upon the well's mouth in its place.</em></p>\n\n<p>After asking the shepherds how Lavan is, the sheperds respond by saying: \"<em>It is well (shalom is with him); and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep</em>.\" </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is it that Ya'akov first repsonse is a question about drawing water?</strong>: \n\"<em>Behold, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together; water ye the sheep, and go and feed them</em>\"? </p>\n\n<p>And the story continues:\nThe shepherds answered Ya'akov: \"We cannot (draw water), until all the flocks be gathered together, and at the time we roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.\" While Ya'akov spake with them, Rachel came, with the flock of her father; for she was a shepherdess. And it came to pass, when Ya'akov saw Rachel the daughter of Lavan his mother's brother, and the sheep of Lavan his mother's brother, that Ya'akov went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Lavan his mother's brother. What happened here? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Is this story chronological?</strong> \nDidn't Ya'akov already knew Rachel was coming, and he had to wait till she would arrive? Or did the men told Ya'akov to wait because Rachel had yet to arrive, before they could water the sheeps, and while speaking to them there she already came, so at that point Ya'akov acted accordingly what was said?</p>\n\n<p>(p.s. translation are from Mechon Mamre - JPS translation - and my own interpretation of these verses).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems that these verses would be chronological. I think you may have gotten somewhat confused with the translation, here, of \"...and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\"</p>\n\n<p>I am summarizing some of Rashi\"s commentary on some of the verses.</p>\n\n<p>Ya'akov sees the shephereds sitting with their flock by the well. He thought that the day was done for them and they wouldn't shepherd anymore. So, he says, \"Hey! why are you just sitting here? The day is still great, and you haven't finished your day's work. Water your herd, and go back and continue shepherding! (In other words, Ya'akov is chastising the shepherds for sitting around.) (Keep in mind, that first he asked them about Lavan, if they knew him, etc.) </p>\n\n<p>In answer to Ya'akov's question, they say, effectively, \"We are not just sitting around wasting time. We want to water the sheep, but the stone is heavy, and we need all the shepherds here before we roll of the stone.\" (Probably a combination of the joint effort involved in rolling off the stone as well as consideration and practicality to have all the shepherds there. Most likely, they knew that Rachel was coming too, as she was also a shepherd, so they were waiting for her, too.) So they say, \"Oh, look. Here comes Rachel!\"</p>\n\n<p>Then, once Rachel was about there, Ya'akov, himself, rolls off the stone and feeds her sheep.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10493/why-is-this-wine-yayin-nesech/13307#13307\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/20208/food-cooked-by-a-non-jew-not-kosher?rq=1\">and here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>How is the status of <em>Shomer Shabbat</em> formally defined? For example:</p>\n\n<p>1) If Jew generally keeps Shabbat but slips up once in a while (maybe, once a month, or once every few months), is he still Shomer Shabbat or does any violation totally destroy his status?</p>\n\n<p>2) If a non-Shomer Shabbat Jew suddenly decides to begin keeping Shabbat, does he become Shomer Shabbat immediately by the very decision itself (ipso facto) as long as his intent was genuine (e.g. he can immediately begin supervising kashrut and, if he dies, dies as a Shomer Shabbat Jew, even if he repents on Wednesday morning and dies before the arrival of the next Shabbat)? Does he only become Shomer Shabbat after keeping a full Shabbat? Does he have to observe a specific <em>number</em> of Shabbats? Two? five? seven? ten? An entire year? A hundred weeks?</p>\n\n<p>As an analogy, the question could be considered similar to asking when a person who is in the process of quitting smoking officially becomes a non-smoker. For some insurance purposes, that has been defined as a year, but in many cases the social or medical definition may vary. Mark Twain infamously claimed that quitting smoking was so easy that he had done it a thousand times. Is <em>Shomer Shabbat</em> similar in that the exact determination of a person's status depends on social factors, or is there a sharp line in the sand? E.g. maybe Reuven has been faithfully keeping <em>Shabbat</em> for the past five years but is still not considered <em>Shomer Shabbat</em> by his synagogue and Rabbi because he had a forty year reputation as one of the most notorious, blatant, public, unrepentant, and generally in-your-face Shabbat violators in the Tri-State Area, even becoming world famous as the person who turned on and off the lights at the Saturday Morning Pork and Shellfish Cookout Competition and Idol-Worshiping Extravaganza every week for twenty years, and the Rabbi has ruled that he must complete ten whole years of observance to prove his repentance.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One can say that the question is how to know if someone did Teshuva.</p>\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.25b.4?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 25b</a>) says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואימתי חזרתן משישברו את פיספסיהן ויחזרו בהן חזרה גמורה דאפילו בחנם לא עבדי מלוה בריבית אחד המלוה ואחד הלוה ואימתי חזרתן משיקרעו את שטריהן ויחזרו בהן חזרה גמורה אפילו לנכרי לא מוזפי ומפריחי יונים אלו שממרין את היונים ולא יונים בלבד אמרו אלא אפילו בהמה חיה ועוף ואימתי חזרתן משישברו את פגמיהן ויחזרו בהן חזרה גמורה דאפי' במדבר נמי לא עבדי סוחרי שביעית אלו שנושאין ונותנין בפירות שביעית ואימתי חזרתן משתגיע שביעית אחרת ויבדלו וא\"ר נחמיה לא חזרת דברים בלבד אמרו אלא חזרת ממון כיצד אומר אני פלוני בר פלוני כינסתי מאתים זוז בפירות שביעית והרי הן נתונין במתנה לעניים\nAnd when is their repentance accepted, so that they may resume being fit to bear witness? Once they break their pispasim and repent of them completely, abandoning this occupation entirely, where they do not do this even for nothing, i.e., they do not play even without betting. The baraita continues: The expression: One who lends with interest, is referring to both the lender and the borrower. Both are disqualified. And when is their repentance accepted? Once they tear their promissory notes and repent of them completely, abandoning this occupation entirely, where they do not lend with interest even to a gentile. The expression: And those who fly pigeons, is referring to those who induce the pigeons to behave in this manner, i.e., they train them. And the Sages did not mean to say that only those who fly pigeons are disqualified; rather, even those who do this with a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or any type of bird are disqualified. And when is their repentance accepted? Once they break their fixtures [pigmeihen] upon which they stand the competing animals, and repent completely, abandoning this occupation entirely, where they do not do this even in the wilderness, where there is no one from whom to steal. The expression: Merchants who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year, is referring to those who do business with the produce of the Sabbatical Year. And when is their repentance accepted? Once another Sabbatical Year occurs and they refrain from selling its produce or from assuming ownership of such produce. The baraita continues: And Rabbi Neḥemya said: The Sages did not say that verbal repentance alone is sufficient for a merchant who traded in the produce of the Sabbatical Year to be reinstated as a valid witness; rather, returning the money is also necessary. How can one return the money he gained from selling produce of the Sabbatical Year? He says: I, so-and-so the son of so-and-so, gathered, i.e., profited, two hundred dinars from trading in the produce of the Sabbatical Year, and as I gained it improperly, this sum is hereby given as a gift to the poor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאפילו לנכרי - שישתכח שם ריבית מפיהם דתו ודאי לא הדרי לקלקולייהו:\nEven to a Non-Jew - That one should forget the concept of interest, so he won't come to sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא חזרת דברים - לומר לא נוסיף עוד אלא חזרה הנכרת שיפזרו פירות שביעית שבגנותיהן לעניים:</p>\n<p>Not verbal retraction - Not just saying that he won't stumble again, but a visible retraction, that he returns the (Shmittah) produce to the poor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that one has to do a repentative action with a loss of money.</p>\n<p>However, the Rama writes <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/he-il/toshba/shulchan_aruch/choshen-mishpat/edut/siman34.htm?printview=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Choshen Mishpat 34:22</a> that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מומר שחזר בו וקבל עליו תשובה כשר מיד אע\"פ שלא עשאה עדיין (מהרי\"ק שורש פ\"ה).\nAn apostate who repents, we accept his repentance immediately even if he didn't do any actions yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the Sema (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x8809\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34:44</a>) says the reason:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since they were surrounded by non-Jews (who have all the pleasures) and wants to separate himself from them, we don't act stringently with them and assume they fully repented.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, this implies that a declaration of repentance only works when one is losing out. However, the Shach writes that we <em>always</em> accept the word of an apostate coming back right away.</p>\n<p>The Piskei Teshuva says that he has to <em>start</em> repenting, and he should also do some self-mortification.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Lechorah I would answer your first question with the standard definition of a shomer shabbos, ie someone who is not mechalel shabbos befarhesiah, in open. That's the only way we know if he's a shomer shabbos. As far as I'm aware, there's no leeway given someone who \"slips up\". (Slipping up where a person is not aware its shabbos, or not aware that what he's doing is forbidden, assur, on shabbos is talked about and not considered chilul shabbos. It's a shogeg, mistake.) Slipping up as you are saying would be considered violating shabbos and if he does it in public, we dont consider him a shomer shabbos until he does complete teshuva and accepts completely to never do it again. (To be clear: Im saying in public, because in private we have no way of knowing what a person does, however, I'm not telling you you're keeping shabbos as long you cook your eggs undercover.) So, according to my own daas on this subject, not a psak, but anyone who ever \"slips up\" in public, even once in a lifetime, as long as he hasn't done teshuvah, is not trusted to be considered a shomer shabbos. A for what is considered teshuvah, see the other answer which quotes the gemara. The rambam quotes it as well. These are teshuvos for other public aveiros, forbidden activites.

    "content": "# How does one resolve/repent from cheating on a test (exam)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=921&pgnum=241\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Moshe Feinstein</a> as cited in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/69990/cheating-on-a-test/69992#69992\">this answer</a>, cheating on a school test/examination can be considered theft from a future employer. E.g. if you get the degree by cheating on a math test, you are tricking a future employer into thinking that you know math when you really don't.</p>\n\n<p>If a Jew is doing Teshuva for a prior instance of cheating on a test and wants to make sure that they avoid stealing from any employer in the future, what must they do to fix their situation? Is it sufficient for them to learn the missing material? Would they need to do more?</p>\n\n<p>E.g. suppose Reuven cheated on his high school exit exam on the section covering quadratic equations by using crib notes to cover up his abysmal algebraic competencies. He now wants to stop stealing from employers by tricking them into thinking that his high school diploma demonstrates that he knows quadratic equations. Which of the following (if any) would he need to do?</p>\n\n<p>1) Reuven just needs to learn quadratic equations.</p>\n\n<p>2) Reuven needs to learn quadratic equations <em>and</em> get his quadratic equation knowledge tested by a trustworthy external source (e.g. he could hire an independent teacher to test him).</p>\n\n<p>3) Reuven must pass the exam that he cheated on (or at least a substantially equivalent exam), but it can be graded by any reliable teacher, not necessarily the same teacher who originally gave the exam, one with authority to change Reuven's original grade or transcript, or even one affiliated with the educational system in which the cheating took place (e.g. if the exam was from New York, the exam could be re-taken in France and graded by a French teacher who happened to be competent in the subject matter of the original test but had no affiliation with any New York educational system or authority to act for them).</p>\n\n<p>4) Reuven must go back and formally re-sit the exam, possibly re-enrolling in high school math coursework if the coursework must be re-taken in order to formally re-sit the exam.</p>\n\n<p>5) Reuven must re-enroll in high school (or enroll in a high school equivalency program) and earn a new diploma, but he can apply for/accept prior learning credit for coursework and exams on which he did not cheat.</p>\n\n<p>6) Reuven must restart high school from the very first day and/or complete an equivalency program from start to finish with no credit for prior coursework.</p>\n\n<p>In response to DanF's comment, an answer could address whether the gravamen of the halachic issue is in falsely claiming mastery of academic material over which one does not actually have mastery (and which the solution would be to simply learn the material), or whether the issue is really a <em>procedural violation</em> with respect to the school that can only truly be rectified by going back to the school or instructor, confessing, and formally re-sitting the applicable exams/coursework?</p>\n\n<p>Obvious practical problems have been mentioned in the comments. This is not only a problem with the Regents' exams - the vast majority of school assessments cannot easily be \"retaken\" later <em>a la carte</em>. It seems that many English A-Levels can actually be re-sat as an adult, but that seems to be an exception to the general rule. If I called up the Baltimore public school system and said, \"Hi, I think I cheated on Unit Test #2 for Algebra 2 in 1985, could you guys have a copy ready when I arrive tomorrow so I can retake it?\" they would simply laugh at me and tell me to move on with my life, or possibly tell me to pick up a Teach Yourself Algebra book or register for a community college course if I was feeling <em>really</em> bad.</p>\n\n<p>This is also not solely a Jewish issue - see this related <a href=\"https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/96413/58912\">question</a> on Academia.SE, in which one of the answers mentions</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...trying to attain 100% of anything is an example of what is known as a category error -- the act of attributing a concept that is applicable to one realm of thought to another realm where it is no longer applicable. \"100% ethical standing\" is simply a meaningless concept.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which raises the question of whether this falls into one of those \"how the market works\" exceptions - that since employers already know (or should know) that most job applicants have previously engaged in some minor amount of cheating in school, then there is no גניבת דעת unless one's cheating was significantly greater than most.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a noun participle be in the past? [Beiza 7b]\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>the second part of the mishna in Beiza says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>השוחט חיה ועוף ביום טוב, בית שמאי אומרים: יחפור בדקר ויכסה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How do you translate this? I would just translate: „someone who slaughters an animal and a bird on yom tov...“ Because השוחט is a participle with an article used as a noun.</p>\n\n<p>But the Gemara on 7b writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>השוחט דיעבד - אין, לכתחלה - לא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We speak about a case in post factum. How does the gemara come to this conclusion? It seems, that the gemara understands השוחט beeing in the past: Someone who has slaughtered... But can this be? Can a participle be in the past?</p>\n\n<p>Now the Artscroll commentary says, that if the mishna would speak about a case לכתחילה it would write: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שוחט אדם חיה ועוף ביום טוב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the difference between them is only the article. But does the article change the time? I am a bit confused by that :) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>With the article, it's \"one who slaughters… should…\". As in English, this is grammatically present tense but refers to an action completed. In particular, it doesn't imply that the slaughtering was permissible. Without the article, it's \"one slaughters… [and should…]\". Again present tense, but now it signifies permissibility by stating generally that one does the action.</p>\n\n<p>Compare the English pair \"One who squares both sides of an equation loses information about the sign of the expression\" / \"One squares both sides of the equation as part of solving for <em>x</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>(I can't cite a source for this answer. It stems from some years' study of <em>mishna</em> and <em>g'mara</em>.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't think you understood this well, the difference between שוחט and השוחט lies in the letter ה. </p>\n\n<p>שוחט אדם means \"a person may slaughter\", while השוחט means \"one who slaughters\" thus hinting at a case of דיעבד. If the Mishna would've said \"a person may slaughter\" there would be no room for doubt (that he is allowed to do it on Yom tov(, but since the Mishna chose to say \"one who slaughters\", the gemara deduces that it wants to convey that it is not to be done לכתחילה. But the word השוחט is not necessarily to be understood as a past tense (one who slaughter<em>ed</em>).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does hamotzi need to be recited again if a meal is interrupted and resumed later?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let's suppose one recites <em>hamotzi</em>, eats some bread, has a few bites of the meal, and then is interrupted by some matter.  Some time later, one returns to the table to resume the meal.</p>\n\n<p>Is it necessary to recite <em>hamotzi</em> again?  My hunch is that the answer depends on how much time has elapsed during the interruption:  if several hours have passed, then one might argue that one is actually beginning a \"new\" meal, requiring new brachot, but if only a few minutes have passed, that would not be necessary.  Is that hunch correct?</p>\n\n<p>The general question of \"When does a meal 'expire'?\" seems related to the question of how long one has to recite <em>birkat hamazon</em>, but in that context the relevant fact is whether one is <em>still full</em>.  In the scenario I describe, one has not yet eaten enough to be sated.  (Also please note that I am <em>not</em> asking about an interruption between reciting <em>hamotzi</em> and eating the bread.)</p>\n\n<p>To clarify:  The question is <strong>not</strong> about reciting <em>birkat hamazon</em>.  It is about whether one needs to recite <em>hamotzi</em> again on returning to a meal that had been interrupted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Per Jay's answer, it seems that the critical factor is not the <em>duration</em> of the interruption, but rather the <em>nature</em> of the interruption, i.e. what exactly the person does during that interval.  So in order to sharpen the question, here are some of the kinds of interruptions that I am wondering about.  Are there any general principles that would help one distinguish which of these would require a new <em>hamotzi</em>?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Taking a phone call</li>\n<li>Chatting with a neighbor at one's own front door</li>\n<li>Chatting with a neighbor who comes to the front door, and is then invited in to sit in the living room</li>\n<li>Chatting with a neighbor at the neighbor's own house</li>\n<li>Getting more food from the fridge or oven</li>\n<li>Picking vegetables or fruit from the garden, to add to the meal in progress</li>\n<li>Getting a bandage for an accidental cut (either for oneself, or for someone else at the table)</li>\n<li>Using the restroom</li>\n<li>Being called away to complete a <em>minyan</em> at another location</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Some of these involve a \"change in location\", but others (e.g. #5) do so only nominally.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Most Poskim hold that the <em>hamotzi</em> bracha remains in effect indefinitely, unless there is some interruption (such as intentional napping). See <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.184.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Brurah 184 s.k. 17</a>. So it would seem that length of time is not a factor, and in your case one need not make a new bracha regardless of how much time has passed.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the new examples you've added - the Rema writes in O.C. 178:7 that 'divrei rshus' such as going to the bathroom or dozing off do not constitute an interruption. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9087&st=&pgnum=161\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Levush (quoted in note 41 of the Kaf Hachaim)</a> explains the Rema as follows [translation mine]: \"The general principle is, anything that a person does occasionally in middle of doing other things is considered minor and is not considered hesech hadaat\".</p>\n\n<p>If, however, there was a change of location (i.e. one left the building) <strong>and</strong> the eating session ends vis-a-vis <em>birkat hamazon</em> (i.e. one is no longer hungry), then it appears that one would need to recite a new <em>hamotzi</em> - see <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.184.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Brurah 184 s.k. 10</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think the issues of birkat hamazon after changing location and saying hamotzi are connected.</p>\n<p>Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.178.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 178</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָיָה אוֹכֵל בְּבַיִת זֶה וּפָסַק סְעוּדָתוֹ וְהָלַךְ לְבַיִת אַחֵר, אוֹ שֶׁהָיָה אוֹכֵל וּקְרָאוֹ חֲבֵרוֹ לְדַבֵּר עִמּוֹ וְיָצָא לוֹ לְפֶתַח בֵּיתוֹ וְחָזַר, הוֹאִיל וְשִׁנָּה מְקוֹמוֹ צָרִיךְ לְבָרֵךְ לְמַפְרֵעַ עַל מַה שֶּׁאָכַל; וְחוֹזֵר וּמְבָרֵךְ בִּתְחִלָּה הַמּוֹצִיא, וְאַחַר כָּךְ יִגְמֹר סְעוּדָתוֹ</p>\n<p>If one was eating at home and interrupted his meal by going to another house, or, while eating, was called by a friend and went to the door to speak with him - since he changed his location, he should retroactively bless [birkat hamazon] on what he ate, <strong>then recite Hamotzi</strong> and continue his meal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Blessings.4.3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MT Brachot 4:3</a>) says the same, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Blessings.4.3?lang=he&with=Hasagot%20HaRaavad&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Raavad</a> disagrees, of course.</p>\n\n\n",

As stated explicitly below, replacing equipment can be deducted, as long as it it not due to negligence on the part of the owner, but one would have to ask specifically if the depreciation of the original equipment should be considered as well as the expected lifetime of that equipment.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of being a nine-tenths <em>partner</em> with Hashem can be used in this consideration.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This reminds me of the old joke about the original name of the clothing store that shows this concept. <em>Hashem and Shneider</em> which translates into English as a famous modern store</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As we see in <a href=\"https://torah.org/learning/business-halacha-5757-vol1no37/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deducting Expenses From Our Maaser Obligation</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To quote Rabbi David Oppenheim (1664-1736. Author of Shaalos\n  U’Teshuvos Nishal L’Dovid. This quote can be found in Sefer Maaser\n  Kesafim, edited by Dr. Cyril Domb, page 61), “Regarding financial\n  Maaser, a person is a (9/10) partner with Hashem in his income. When\n  it comes to deducting expenses, a person may deduct any expenses or\n  losses that occur in his business as long as they are not due to his\n  negligence, for there is a mutual liability (between the business and\n  Maaser) …therefore any expenses incurred in earning the income,\n  including any clothing that must be purchased for a business related\n  journey, may be deducted”.</p>\n  \n  <p>This concept of a person being a partner with Hashem has direct\n  ramifications on what expenses may be deducted from our income before\n  setting aside Maaser, and on the distribution of Maaser funds. We are\n  only going to discuss the former in this class. </p>\n  \n  <p>Money spent by a person to enable him to earn an income, may be\n  deducted from his income before separating Maaser, even if it was used\n  for this purpose unsuccessfully. Any expenditures or losses that are\n  not for the purpose of producing more income are considered a person’s\n  private income, and Maaser must be separated from these funds.</p>\n  \n  <p>In light of the above, the following may be deducted from the gross\n  income before separating Maaser by a self employed business owner:\n  Wages paid to an employee, any inventory related expenses, cost of\n  leasing property or vehicles, advertising, and any business related\n  taxes.</p>\n  \n  <p>Any financial loss caused by theft, loss, or broken machinery may also\n  be deducted, as long as it is not due to negligence on the business\n  owner’s part.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, if property or vehicles were purchased for the business, the\n  money used for this purpose is not considered a business expense,\n  rather it is a capital investment, and Maaser must be paid on it.\n  Depreciation of these items due to normal wear and tear may be\n  deducted. Obviously, the cost of maintaining these items may also be\n  deducted. </p>\n  \n  <p>See the Shaalos U’Teshuvos Shaar Ephraim (84), Chut HaShoni (90),\n  Shvus Yaaakov (Vol. 2 Siman 86), and Avkas Roechel (3). See also the\n  Pischei Teshuva (Yoreh De’ah 249:1), Nodeh B’Yehuda (Yoreh De’ah Vol.\n  2 Siman 199), Chavos Yair (224), and Ahavas Chessed (Vol. 2 18:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

So they must have needed a lot of the spring water mixed with red heifer ashes. But the Mishna says only 9 heifers were processed in history, with 1,000 years between the first two. So they must have highly diluted the ashes to accommodate everybody. (Halacha does not specify a density.) In fact, I read that much water was left over and used after the Second Temple was destroyed. Why didn't they keep diluting it to make it last indefinitely?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1517305/jewish/Parah-Adummah-Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Parah Adumah 9:8</a> says that once the water has been mixed with the ashes, no further water can be added to further dilute the mixture. Once it has been made, an additional Parah Adumah is required to make more and add to the water. Thus, if any other water accidentally drops in, the entire mixture is pasul.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When even the smallest amount of other water – even water that was\ndrawn for the sake of the ashes of the red heifer – becomes mixed with\nsanctified water, it is disqualified. Similarly, if dew descends into\nsuch water, it is disqualified. If other liquids or fruit juices fall\ninto it, the entire quantity should be poured out. The container must\nbe dried; only afterwards can other sanctified water be placed in it.</p>\n<p>If ink, black earth, or dark earth, or any entity that leaves a mark\nfalls into such water, it must be poured out, but there is no need to\ndry the container. The rationale is that if any portion of the entity\nthat leaves a mark will remain, it will be apparent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna in Para (3:5) states that there were 9 para adumahs in history. The Mishna states that Moshe (really Elazar) made a Parah Aduma and that Para Adumah lasted until Ezra which is about 800 years and then Ezra made a Parah Aduma when they returned from Bavel. Then, in the period of the second Beis Hamikdash they made an additional 7 para adumahs.</p>\n<p>This means that for the first 800 years, they were able to use the water that Moshe made and keep putting the remainder (aside from the few drops sprinkled) back in the container. This is like the anointing oil used for the Kohen gadol that Moshe made. From Ezra to the destruction of the second temple, they used 8 such cows.</p>\n<p>It appears that either they were unable to keep the water completely pure during the second temple, or they decided to make more as they found a cow that could be used for Parah Adumah because of the fear that they might run out. Seven in 420 years is once every 60 years, so it might be once a yovel.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Hai Gaon</a>, cited by the Sefer HaEshkol (Hilkhot Sefer Torah) writes (as I cite in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53351/8775\">this</a> relevant post):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגדה ומדרש אף על פי שכתובין בתלמוד אם לא יכוונו ואם ישתבשו אין לסמוך עליהם, כי כללינו הוא <strong>אין סומכין על ההגדה</strong>...ומה שלא נקבע בתלמוד אין אנו צריכין לכל כך, אלא מעיינין בו אם נכון הוא ויפה, דורשין אותו ומלמדין אותו, ואם לאו אין אנו משגיחין עליו. </p>\n  \n  <p>Haggada and Midrash--even if they are written in the Talmud, if they do not make sense, do not rely \"lismokh\" on them. For our principle is, we do not rely on hagada...And that which is not established in the Talmud, we do not need all this [to try and explain it, where possible]. Rather, we study it: if it is correct and good, we explicate and teach it. If not, we do not pay attention to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even earlier Rav Sa'adya wrote (Otsar HaGeonim Hagigah p. 65) regarding the Seder Olam's views on dating Biblical events:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זהו אגדה ו<strong>אין סומכין על דברי אגדה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>This is an aggada, and we do not rely on words of aggada.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Significantly, there is no indication whatsoever that the principle means that legal conclusions cannot be drawn from aggadot, as the context of Rassag is not halakhic! Furthermore, Rassag gives no indication that he means that the aggada may have esoteric meaning, and indeed as it is simply a question of the date that an event occurred.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Abulafia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Meir Halevi Abulafiah</a> (cited there) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגאונים רבינו סעדיה ורבנו האי ז\"ל...והם אמרו <strong>אין סומכין</strong> ו<strong>אין מביאין ראיה מכל דברי אגדה</strong>, ו<strong>אין מקשין מדברי אגדה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Geonim Rabbenu Sa'adya and Rabbenu Hai OBM...And they said that we\n  neither rely on, nor bring proof from, nor ask on the basis of aggada.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the exact permutation you mention of אין משיבין, rather than אין מקשין, it is found in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simhah_ben_Samuel_of_Vitry#The_Vitry_Machzor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mahzor Vitry</a> (428), and in the writing of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> (Yevamot 61b).</p>\n\n<p>The context in the Mahzor Vitry regards the age of Bilam and divergent Midrashim about this, and the context of Ramban is the rejection of the Midrashic claim that Rivkah was three years old when she encountered Eliezer.</p>\n\n<p>It is clear from the Mahzor Vitry, just as the expression is used by the Geonim, that this doesn't mean that we don't learn halakha from aggada, since the context is entirely non-halakhic. Nor is there any indication whatsoever that the principle relates to the issue of literal or non-literal interpretation of aggada. If anything his usage indicates that the reason that one cannot ask on the basis of aggada is that aggada is not absolute and is subject to diverse views.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the context of Ramban fits the usage of the Geonim and provides no evidence that the problem with aggada is in its utility for halakha, nor that there is a problem with literal interpretation in particular.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Talmud Yerushalmi (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40734&st=&pgnum=149\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peah 2:4</a>) states that we do not derive laws from aggadah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר\"ז בשם שמואל אין למידין לא מן ההלכות <strong>ולא מן ההגדות</strong> ולא מן התוספתות\n  אלא מן התלמוד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Margolies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moses Margalit</a> in his commentary <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40734&st=&pgnum=149\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> explains that this is because only Talmud has been subjected to the thorough process of clarification and analysis:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין למדין. הלכה למעשה דבר מן דבר ולא מן ההלכות שהוזכר בהן הלכה למ\"מ\n  אין למדין מהלכה זו לדמות לדבר אחר כמוה <strong>ולא ממה שהוזכר באגדות</strong> ולא\n  מן התוספתות אלא מן התלמוד לפי שהאמוראים שבתלמוד הן הן שביררו הלכה\n  למעשה מתוך פלפולם ומתוך סברא שלהם ולפיכך אע\"פ שלפעמים הוזכר במשנה\n  ובברייתא הלכה כר' פלוני אין סומכין על זה כ\"א דוקא על הלכה שבגמרא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Naghrillah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

He cites many earlier sources that discuss this, and he mentions an idea that aggadah is unreliable for halacha because it might have been written simply to contain \"secrets\", and thus lacks the precision of halachic statements:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיון דלא נכתבו הלכה למעשה ואולי רק להסתיר בהם סודות התורה כתבום ולא\n  דקדקו בזה שיהיה המעשה להלכה כיון דהעיקר להם בזה להסתיר סודות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why must one give up his life to avoid idolatry, according to Rashi?",
    "content": "# Why must one give up his life to avoid idolatry, according to Rashi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 74a) derives that one must give up his life to avoid idolatry from the passuk in Va'Eschanan (Devarim 6:5): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואהבת את ה׳ אלקיך ... בכל נפשך</p>\n  \n  <p>You should love HaShem your G-d ... with all your soul</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One is enjoined to love HaShem - i.e. not to replace Him with another (Rashi) - to the point of giving up one's soul. </p>\n\n<p>According to the way Rashi seems to understand the Gemara, the derasha seems flawed, though: if one serves under duress, he's not \"replacing\" HaShem. He still loves Him; he's just doing what he can to live. His allegiance is still to the True G-d. Should V'chai Bahem not still apply in this case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>See Rambam's Sefer HaMitzvot, aseh 9:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמצוה התשיעית היא שצונו לקדש השם והוא אמרו (אמור כב) ונקדשתי בתוך בני\nישראל. וענין זאת המצוה אשר אנחנו מצווים לפרסם האמונה הזאת האמתית בעולם\nושלא נפחד בהיזק שום מזיק. ואע\"פ שבא עלינו מכריח גובר יבקש ממנו לכפור\nבו יתעלה לא נשמע ממנו אבל נמסור עצמנו למיתה ולא נתעהו לחשוב שכפרנו\nואע\"פ שלבנו מאמין בו יתעלה</p>\n<p>...The content of this mitzvah is that we are commanded to publicize this true belief in the world, and we should not fear the damage of anyone inflicting damage.

But as Sifrei Devarim 344:7 emphasizes this is actually emphasizing the acceptance of the Torah and it's commandments, commitment to fulfilling the commandments.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These are the souls of the righteous which are reposited with Him in the \"treasure-trove,\" as it is written (I Samuel 25:29) \"May my lord's soul <strong>be bound up in the bond of life</strong>, with the L-rd your G-d.\" \"And they planted themselves at Your feet\": Even though (at the giving of the Torah) they recoiled twelve mil and returned twelve mil,\" they bore (the yoke of) Your words — \"All that the L-rd has spoken, <strong>we shall do</strong> and <strong>we shall hear</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>לקדש</strong>, which means to sanctify or to manifest fidelity toward (<em>fidelity means demonstrating faithfulness, loyalty and support</em>) or to dedicate, as in להקדש ספר.</p>\n\n<p>And so, וחי בהם means to dedicate ones life to the fulfillment of the commandments which is the mitzvah of <strong>Sanctification of G-d's name</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So even if limiting the question to <em>Is וחי בהם one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah</em>, it would appear to be yes.</p>\n\n\n",

But how could anyone know about the third, anyway?</p>\n<p>I don't think there is a source for including <em>kashrus</em> or <em>taharas hamishpachah</em>. I think they are \"just\" included because they show a level of commitment, a willingness to shape how one lives, even curtail one's basic physical drives, around <em>halakhah</em>.</p>\n<p>As for Shabbos, that <strong>is</strong> well established. At least, public Shabbos observance. The gemara rules on Chullin 5a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מקבלין קרבנות מפושעי ישראל כדי שיחזרו בהן בתשובה חוץ מן המומר ומנסך את היין ומחלל שבתות בפרהסיא</p>\n<p>We accept sacrifices from Jews who are sinners so that they will thereby return in <em>teshuvah</em> -- except from someone entirely non-observant, one who anoints with wine [idolatrously] or who desecrates Shabbos in public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam explains the mishnah in Chullin 1:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמרו \"<strong>הכל שוחטין</strong>\", ואפילו ישראל משומד, ויש לכך תנאים ואז תהיה שחיטתו מותרת, האחד שלא יהא עובד עבודה זרה, לפי שאמרו משומד לעבודה זרה משומד לכל התורה כולה. והשני שלא יהא מחלל שבת בפרהסיא לפי שהכלל אצלינו מחלל שבת בפרהסיא הרי הוא כגוי לכל דבריו. ושלא יהיה מין.</p>\n<p>And they[, the <em>tannaim</em>, further say in the mishnah], \"all may slaughter\": Even an intentionally non-observant Jew, although there are preconditions to be met, and then [the meat] of his slaughter is permissible. (1) That he does not worship <em>avodah zarah</em> (polytheism, or worshiping G-d but in a pagan manner. Because they said that someone who is non-observant with regard to <em>avodah zarah</em> is an non-observant with regard to the entire Torah. (2) That he does not desecrate Shabbos in public. Because there is a principle with us that one who desecrates Torah in public is like a non-Jew in all his matter. And [3] that he not be a sectarian...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just to give a similar sample from the Ashkenazi side, Tosafos (BB 119a, \"שנאמר מחלליה מות יומת ...\") quote the above gemara and explains it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דדומה שבת לע\"ז דהיינו מחלל שבת בפרהסיא לעובד ע\"ז</p>\n<p>... for Shabbos is comparable to <em>avodah zara</em>; that is -- one who desecrates Shabbos in public to one who worships <em>avodah zarah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice the \"desecrates Shabbos <strong>in public</strong>\". There has to be a lack of shame about it. (For similar reasons, we aren't talking about someone raised in a non-observant home.) Also, as we homiletically say about the wicked son of the <em>seder</em> \"because he removed himself from the community, he denied the fundamental\" of our faith. Judaism is inherently communal, and so to be really outside the camp would require violating that camp.</p>\n<p>The reason why Shabbos is straightforward. Aside from being life-style changing and thus an indicator of commitment, as are <em>kashrus</em> and <em>taharas hamishpachah</em>, the Torah describes Shabbos as a sign of creation (commandment 5, Shemos 20:11) and a reminder of the Exodus (commandment 5, Devarim 5:11). Shabbos observance thus (see Rashi, Chullin 5a \"ela lav H\"Q\") denying Shabbos and thus that Hashem is the G-d of Creation and of History is akin to altogether worshiping something other than Him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>That said, I think that the ancient litmus test for who is a Jew in good standing was quite different.</p>\n<p>Look how the Torah describes Shavous, the anniversary of the giving of the Torah. Vayiqra 23:15,22:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וספרתם לכם ממחרת השבת מיום הביאכם את עמר התנופה שבע שבתות תמימת תהיינה ... ובקצרכם את קציר ארצכם לא תכלה פאת שדך בקצרך ולקט קצירך לא תלקט לעני ולגר תעזב אתם אני ה' אלקיכם</p>\n<p>And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the day of rest [ie the first day of Pesach], from the day you bring the <em>omer</em> wave offering, 7 complete weeks it shall be... And when you cut the crops of your land, do not finish off the corners [<em>pei'ah</em>] of your field when you harvest, and the gleanings  [<em>leqet</em>] of your harvest, do not collect; leave them for the poor and the stranger -- I am Hashem your G-d!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which ties into the reading of the narrative of Ruth on Shavuos. Also during harvest time, and also centering on the <em>mitzvos</em> of sharing one's crops with the poor.</p>\n<p>For that matter, the gemara Yevamos 47a (and similarly Rambam, Issurei Bi’ah 14:2) explains what we must teach a prospective convert:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומודיעין אותו מקצת מצות קלות ומקצת מצות חמורות, ומודיעין אותו עון לקט שכחה ופאה ומעשר עני. ומודיעין אותו ענשן של מצות, … וכשם שמודיעין אותו ענשן של מצות, כך מודיעין אותו מתן שכרן… לא רוב טובה ולא רוב פורענות. ואין מרבין עליו, ואין מדקדקין עליו.</p>\n<p>And we inform him about some minor <em>mitzvos</em> and some stringent ones, we inform him about the sins of [neglecting] <em>leqet</em>, <em>shikhechah</em> -- one or two forgotten when picking, <em>pei’ah</em> and <em>maaser ani</em> — the tithe to the poor.</p>\n<p>And we tell him the punishments of [violating] <em>mitzvos</em>… And just as we tell him the punishments of <em>mitzvos</em>, we tell them the giving of the reward… Not overly about the good, nor overly about the suffering. And we do not overwhelm him, and we do not become unduly meticulous with him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In sum, we give the prospective convert a \"30,000 foot level picture\" of what observance means with the exception of <em>leqet</em>, <em>shikhechah</em>, <em>pei'ah</em> and <em>maaser ani</em>. These are the important <em>mitzvos</em> we must make sure every convert knows about.</p>\n<p>While we today look at two or three <em>mitzvos</em> between ourselves and G-d as the bellwether <em>mitzvos</em>, that was not true of the Judaism in the days of Tanakh thought at least Chazal's day, if not significantly later. (The Rambam is not a data point, since he is basing himself on the gemara.)</p>\n<p>Originally, the definition of an \"observant Jew\" was measured by the <em>mitzvos</em> that impact how one makes their living.</p>\n<p>(I realize that everything below the line is tangential. <strong>But</strong> anyone aware of current events at the time of this writing will understand why this contrast is a point that needs making. And it <em>does</em> touch on the question of the source, since it argues against the age of the idea and thus the age of possible sources.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The source may be R. Chaim Ozer's teshuvah (Achiezer 3:26) about what is necessary for kabbalat mitzvot in conversion. This is what R. Chaim Ozer writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה\"ט נראה מה שחשש הרה\"ג מהר\"י פאזען לגייר לפי שלא ישמור דיני ישראל\n  כהלכה, אפ\"ל דאין לחוש לזה כיון דמקבל עליו כל המצות אף שחושב לעבור על\n  איזה מהמצות אח\"כ לתיאבון, מ\"מ אין זה מניעה לקבלת המצות, ודוקא היכא\n  שמתנה שלא לקבל עליו זהו חסרון בקבלת המצות דמעכב. <strong>אולם היכא שברור הדבר\n  שבודאי יעבור אחרי כן על איסורי תורה, חלול שבת ואכילת טריפות</strong> ואנו יודעים\n  בבירור כונתו שאינו מתגייר רק לפנים ולבו בל עמו, הרי אומדנא דמוכח שמה\n  שאומר שמקבל עליו המצות לאו כלום הוא א\"כ <strong>זהו חסרון בקבלת המצות דמעכב</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, he maintains that it is only necessary for a convert to accept the mitzvot in general, and if we know that he will violate the mitzvot subsequently, because of his yetzer hara, this does not invalidate the conversion. However, if he is not committed to even maintaining a kosher home and keeping Shabbat, then his entire commitment is called into question and the conversion is invalid. It would seem that these two mitzvot are the ones that most affect Jews in daily life, and not that there is some special halachic status to them (although Shabbat does in fact have a special status, that is not the emphasis here). </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Charlie Gard's parents from a Halachic Perspective\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As this question is somewhat extensive, I have divided the post into headers in order to make it easier to read and follow.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Background</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Gard_treatment_controversy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Charlie Gard</a> is a British baby who has a rare genetic disorder called MDDS, leaving him blind, deaf, and unable to breathe without outside support. He's terminally ill, but there is an experimental treatment available in the US that <em>could</em> save his life.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the hospital refuses to let him go, saying that prolonging his life will cause undue suffering; the best thing, in their opinion, is to take him off of life support. The parents sued the hospital, but they lost and were denied appeal. This has sparked an international controversy over whether the parents should be allowed to bring their child to the United States for treatment.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Sources</h1>\n<p>The Mishnah in Oholos (7:6) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האשה שהיא מקשה לילד, מחתכין את הולד במעיה ומוציאין אותו אברים אברים, מפני שחייה קודמין לחייו.\nיצא רבו, אין נוגעין בו, שאין דוחין נפש מפני נפש.</p>\n<p>[If] a woman is having a difficult time in labor, we may kill<sup>1</sup> the fetus inside her and bring it out limb by limb, for her life precedes his. [If] his majority<sup>2</sup> has exited, we may not touch him, for we do not push aside one life in favor of another.<sup>3</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Rashi to Sanhedrin 72a explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דכל זמן שלא יצא לאויר העולם לאו נפש הוא וניתן להורגו ולהציל את אמו אבל יצא ראשו אין נוגעים בו להורגו דהוה ליה כילוד ואין דוחין נפש מפני נפש</p>\n<p>For however long he has not exited into the air in the world, he is not considered alive, and he may be given to be killed to save his mother. However, \"[if] his head has exited, we may not touch him\" to kill him, for he is considered as having been born, and \"we do not push aside one life in favor of another.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason I bring down these sources is to prove that, barring any extenuating circumstances (see footnote 3), one may not kill a baby; even at birth, it is considered alive, and certainly once it passes the threshold of thirty days.<sup>4,5</sup></p>\n<p>Perhaps another thing to consider is that murder is an exception to the general rule that messengers don't obligate in their senders for sins performed in their service (ein shliach l'dvar aveirah) - that is, if I hire a mercenary, I'm liable for his murdering (Kiddushin 43a, Rambam Hilchos Retzichah 2:2-3). Even though the government is not Jewish, even non-Jews are halachically sheluchim if they could perform the agency on their own (Kiddushin 41b); as non-Jews are commanded in murder as well, this would seem to qualify.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The question</h1>\n<p>Let's return to the Charlie Gard case, and let's imagine if the family was Jewish. As we discussed above, a baby is unable to be killed once it's born; it has the status of being alive, just like anyone else.</p>\n<p>The logical extension of that is that when a baby needs to be put on life support, it should be forbidden to unplug it, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27007/resuscitation-of-aged-nursing-home-patients\">just as it is for anyone else</a> - if it's murder for the elderly, it should be murder for the baby as well, because, again, we saw above that we make no distinction in this regard.</p>\n<p>So <strong>what happens when the hospitals and courts refuse to allow treatment to a baby?</strong> At what point are the parents allowed - or, perhaps, obligated - to give up? To what extent must they fight the system before being satisfied knowing they did everything that they could? By consenting to the government putting the child down, are the liable for the government's murder, as per the latter discussion above in the sources?<sup>6</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\n<p><sup>1</sup>Literally translated, the word מחתחין means to cut. I have translated it as to kill based on the Rambam in Hilchos Rotzeiach 1:9 that one may kill the fetus in any manner in order to save the mother, based on the halacha of rodef. See note 3.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup>The version in Sanhedrin 72a has \"his head\" rather than \"his majority.\" For our purposes, this does not make a difference.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup>The Gemara in Sanhedrin ibid. notes that this seems to go against the halachos of rodef, but answers that משמיא קרדפי לה, literally translated as \"from Heaven she is being chased.\" The meaning of this cryptic line is beyond the scope of this discussion; the interested reader may refer to Rashi and Meiri ad. loc., and Rambam ibid.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup>See, for instance, Rambam, Hilchos Milah 1:13, where he discusses that a baby that lives for 30 days is considered viable.</p>\n<p><sup>5</sup>The reason I discuss that it's considered murder once the baby is born, rather than discuss that abortion is forbidden, is because it's <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Abortion#What_is_the_Prohibition.3F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">unclear what exactly the prohibition is</a>; with the exception of R' Moshe on that list, nobody holds it's murder, and even R' Moshe is uncertain whether it is considered full-fledged murder. To avoid this sticky case, I decided to stick with the sources that are more solid to set up my question.</p>\n<p><sup>6</sup>The reason I ask about a case with an infant rather than an older patient is because once a patient is 18 (in both US and UK law) the hospitals address such issues with the patient directly, as he or she is legally mature enough to make such decisions on their own. Even in the case of younger patients (I can only surmise based on my own medical experience) doctors will often discuss with the child what their wishes are, even if they decide it's in their best interest not to abide. However, with an infant, even that option is off the table; the parents are the only ones able to defend the child.</p>\n\n\n",

And he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man; and Zabdi was taken. 18 And he brought near his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Can anyone explain me which makes part of what?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You can glean a sense of the purpose and hence inherent meaning of the 3 terms that you mentioned, from the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar 1:2</a> - I've linked to the Rash\"I commentary page as I will focus on his and the accompanying <em>Siftei Cachamim</em> commentary.</p>\n\n<p>G-d tells Moses to count all the people למשפחותם לבית אבותם. Both terms are used.</p>\n\n<p>משפחה is what identifies your tribe. In other words, when we see, later (like in the more detailed listing in parshat <em>Pinchas</em> (See Bemidbar 26:5 - 50,) they list the tribes and then the families of each tribe. E.g. - Reuven has the Chanoch family, the Chetzron family, etc. So, the tribe consists of families.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what happens, if the mother is from, say, the Peretz family who is one of the Yehuda families, and the father is from the Palu family from Re'uven? Which tribe do the children belong to? That's the purpose of לבית אבותם - the father's household. In other words, the children are identified by the father's family, in this case, the children are considered Paluites and, thus, they are from the tribe of Reueven.</p>\n\n<p>So in short - the shevet includes multiple <em>mishpachot</em>. <em>Bet Av</em> is used to identify the <em>mishpacha</em>, and hence the <em>shevet</em> of the children that result from a marriage that has two different <em>shevatim</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Perhaps a better sense of these different terms can be gleaned from the end of the book of Bemidbar. See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=464&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar 36:1</a>. You see, here both terms - ראשי אבות - \"heads of the fathers\" and משפחת - \"the family of\".</p>\n\n<p>The verse says that the heads of the fathers from the family of Machir son of Gil'ad son of Menashe from among the families of the sons of Yoseph. </p>\n\n<p>The heads of the fathers that approached Moshe and Elazar and the heads of the tribes are discussing what happens to the portion of the land that was assigned to the daughters of Tzlafchad (Tzlafchad was Gilad's brother.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, why specifically did the \"Heads of the fathers\" approach and ask this question? Because, as explained above, the identity of the tribe follows that of the father. Now, what they asked was, \"Wait a second! You Moses said, previously that since Tzelafchad had no sons, nonetheless, the daughters inherit the land. Seems to be an exception to the \"father's inheritance\" rule. OK. But, if Tzlefchad's daughters marry someone from another tribe, and they have children, the land inheritance goes according to the <em>bet avot</em>, meaning the father. So that would mean that the daughters of Tzlefchad would lose their previous land inheritance. There seems to be a contradiction.\"</p>\n\n<p>So, from this story, we can also learn the same hierarchy and usage of the terms, as I mentioned, above.</p>\n\n\n",

In the cited Gemara in Avodah Zarah, they say, Rava's explaining that the Braisa works even according to R' Yishmael:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לכך נראה דרבא נמי אית ליה דרבי יוחנן והא דקא משני לתרוצי הברייתא אפילו אליבא דר' ישמעאל הוא דאתא וכן משמע נמי בפ\"ב דכתובות (דף יט.) דרבא אית ליה דרבי יוחנן דא\"ל רבא אילו אתו לקמן לאימלוכי אמרי' להו זילו חתומו וכו' דאמר מר אין לך דבר שעומד בפני פיקוח נפש אלא עבודת כוכבים וגלוי עריות ושפיכות דמים והתם נמי בצנעא מיירי דאין דרך שיאנס אותם בפני י'‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an alternative answer, they cite \"my beloved Rabbi, R' Moshe of Kotzi, in his Sefer HaMitzvos which he compiled\" who explains that Rava's statement in Avodah Zarah does not contradict R' Yochanan's position. What Rava means here is that there are two separate obligations involved: don't worship idolatry, and serve Hashem even if it comes to giving up your life. Neither the former prohibition, nor its punishment, apply if one was forced in private to worship an idol. The latter obligation would still apply, and one would still have to give up his life; nevertheless, this obligation is not punishable by the death penalty.</p>\n<p>It therefore comes out that there's no contradiction between the two Gemaras; they're merely addressing two different requirements. Rava still holds of R' Yochanan, and therefore we pasken accordingly, as recorded by Rav Achai Gaon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב בסוף פרק בן סורר ומורה וז\"ל רבא דפ' ר' ישמעאל לא פליג עליה דר' יוחנן אלא ה\"פ אמר רבא הכל היו בכלל לא תעבדם בין לאזהרה בין למיתה כשהוא אומר וחי בהם יצא אונס דצנעא מכל וכל בין מאזהרה בין ממיתה אבל הא מודי רבא דאיכא עשה דבכל נפשך שיש למסור עצמו אפילו בכל אונסא כדאמר ר\"א בברייתא כשהוא אומר לא תחללו אהדריה בכלליה והיינו אונס דפרהסיא בין לאזהרה בין למיתה והואיל ורבא שהוא בתרא לא פליג עליה דרבי יוחנן שריר וקיים פסק השאלתות שיש לאדם למסור עצמו למיתה ואפילו באונס ובצנעא עכ\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h1>How does this extend to murder and immorality?</h1>\n<p>The Rambam paskens like Tosfos' second answer in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.5.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Yesodei HaTorah 5:4</a> (though he chooses a different source than Tosfos), and he explicitly extends it to cases other than idolatry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכָל מִי שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר בּוֹ יֵהָרֵג וְאַל יַעֲבֹר וְעָבַר וְלֹא נֶהֱרַג הֲרֵי זֶה מְחַלֵּל אֶת הַשֵּׁם. וְאִם הָיָה בַּעֲשָׂרָה מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל הֲרֵי זֶה חִלֵּל אֶת הַשֵּׁם בָּרַבִּים וּבִטֵּל מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה שֶׁהִיא קִדּוּשׁ הַשֵּׁם וְעָבַר עַל מִצְוַת לֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁהִיא חִלּוּל הַשֵּׁם. וְאַף עַל פִּי כֵן מִפְּנֵי שֶׁעָבַר בְּאֹנֶס אֵין מַלְקִין אוֹתוֹ וְאֵין צָרִיךְ לוֹמַר שֶׁאֵין מְמִיתִין אוֹתוֹ בֵּית דִּין אֲפִלּוּ הָרַג בְּאֹנֶס. שֶׁאֵין מַלְקִין וּמְמִיתִין אֶלָּא לְעוֹבֵר בִּרְצוֹנוֹ וּבְעֵדִים וְהַתְרָאָה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר בְּנוֹתֵן מִזַּרְעוֹ לַמּלֶךְ (ויקרא כ ה) \"וְשַׂמְתִּי אֲנִי אֶת פָּנַי בָּאִישׁ הַהוּא\". מִפִּי הַשְּׁמוּעָה לָמְדוּ הַהוּא לֹא אָנוּס וְלֹא שׁוֹגֵג וְלֹא מֻטְעֶה. וּמָה אִם עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים שֶׁהִיא חֲמוּרָה מִן הַכּל הָעוֹבֵד אוֹתָהּ בְּאֹנֶס אֵינוֹ חַיָּב כָּרֵת וְאֵין צָרִיךְ לוֹמַר מִיתַת בֵּית דִּין. קַל וָחֹמֶר לִשְׁאָר מִצְוֹת הָאֲמוּרוֹת בַּתּוֹרָה.</p>\n<p>And anyone about whom it is said that he should he killed and not violate, and he violates and is not killed - this is a desecration of the Name. If it was amongst ten Jews - this is a public desecration of the Name. He has nullified the positive commandment to sanctify His Name and violated the negative commandment not to desecrate it. Nevertheless, since he violated it under duress, we don't give him lashes, and it goes without saying that we don't kill him in court, even if he murdered under duress. As it says regarding one who gives his children to Molech (Vayikra 20:5): \"And I will place My face against that man.\" From tradition we learn: \"That [man],\" and not one who was forced, did so by mistake, or did so by accident. If by idolatry, which is more severe than anything else, one who worships it under duress does not receive Kares, and it goes without saying [he doesn't receive] death in court, all the more so to all other prohibitions in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara in Avodah Zara 54 seems to imply that in private one is allowed to worship an idol while under compulsion and live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Tosfos' first answer, that's technically correct, but Rava's playing devil's advocate and doesn't actually hold of what he says here. According to their second answer, that's mostly correct: one can live after doing so, but that doesn't make it permissible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is this true regarding the other two in private?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Rambam, who paskens according to Tosfos' second answer: Yes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The distinction between public and private sins is only with regard to commandments other than all three of the major sins (including idolatry) and their correlaries (<em>abizrayhu</em>) and only at threat of death where the one making the threat has anti-religious intent. Idolatry, murder, and sexual sins are never allowed.</p>\n<p>See e.g. Maimonides' <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904980/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Laws of the Fundamentals of the Torah 5:1-2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל בית ישראל מצווין על קדוש השם הגדול הזה שנאמר ונקדשתי בתוך בני ישראל ומוזהרין שלא לחללו שנאמר ולא תחללו את שם קדשי כיצד כשיעמוד עובד כוכבים ויאנוס את ישראל לעבור על אחת מכל מצות האמורות בתורה או יהרגנו יעבור ואל יהרג שנאמר במצות אשר יעשה אותם האדם וחי בהם וחי בהם ולא שימות בהם ואם מת ולא עבר הרי זה מתחייב בנפשו</p>\n<p>במה דברים אמורים בשאר מצות חוץ מעבודת כוכבים וגלוי עריות ושפיכת דמים. אבל שלש עבירות אלו - אם יאמר לו \"עבור על אחת מהן או תהרג\" יהרג ואל יעבור. בד\"א - בזמן שהעובד כוכבים מתכוין להנאת עצמו, כגון שאנסו לבנות לו ביתו בשבת או לבשל לו תבשילו או אנס אשה לבועלה וכיוצא בזה. אבל אם נתכוין להעבירו על המצות בלבד - אם היה בינו לבין עצמו ואין שם עשרה מישראל - יעבור ואל יהרג, ואם אנסו להעבירו בעשרה מישראל - יהרג ואל יעבור, ואפילו לא נתכוין להעבירו אלא על מצוה משאר מצות בלבד</p>\n<p>The entire house of Israel are commanded regarding the sanctification of [God's] great name, as [Leviticus 22:32] states: \"And I shall be sanctified amidst the children of Israel.\" Also, they are warned against desecrating [His holy name], as [the above verse] states: \"And they shall not desecrate My holy name.\"</p>\n<p>What is implied? Should a gentile arise and force a Jew to violate one of the Torah's commandments at the pain of death, he should violate the commandment rather than be killed, because [Leviticus 18:5] states concerning the mitzvot: \"which a man will perform and live by them.\" [They were given so that] one may live by them and not die because of them. If a person dies rather than transgress, he is held accountable for his life.</p>\n<p>When does the above apply? With regard to other mitzvot, with the exception of the worship of other gods, forbidden sexual relations, and murder. However, with regard to these three sins, if one is ordered: \"Transgress one of them or be killed,\" one should sacrifice his life rather than transgress.</p>\n<p>When does the above apply? When the gentile desires his own personal benefit - for example, he forces a person to build a house or cook food for him on the Sabbath, he rapes a woman, or the like. However, if his intention is solely to have him violate the mitzvot, if he is alone and there are not ten other Jews present, he should transgress and not sacrifice his life. However, if he forces him [to transgress] with the intention that he violate [a mitzvah] in the presence of ten Jews, he should sacrifice his life and not transgress. [This applies] even if [the gentile] intended merely that he violate only one of the [Torah's] mitzvot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, if a government hostile to the Torah laws that forbid homosexuality were to make it a capital offense to refuse to cater a gay wedding, since the wedding is a public affair, the caterer would have to allow himself to be killed rather than cater the ceremony.  In fact, if catering qualifies as <em>abizrayhu</em> of the actual act, even privacy wouldn't preempt the obligation of martyrdom.</p>\n\n\n",

Why is the Torah inconsistent?

The verse says that the man shall bring his wife's קרבן, and \"he shall not pour on it (עליו) oil nor put on it (עליו) frankincense.\" The verse is thus already using a male pronoun, not in reference to the subject מנחת קנאת but rather to the word קרבן.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when one reaches the next clause of the verse, \"כי מנחת קנאת הוּא,\" one realizes that the male pronoun is referring to the same male subject, קרבן.

Bilaam is calling Bnei Yisrael <strong>the nation</strong> as oppose to what Balak said, which is just <strong>a nation</strong>. Rashi gives explanations for all the other differences between the wording of Balak and the wording of Bilaam, but he doesn't mention the reason for this subtle change. Why does Bilaam say this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein in Darash Moshe said that Balak thought that this was like any other people who had broken free and was now searching for a place to conquer and call home. As a result, he wanted to keep them away from his area as once they settled somewhere, they would assimilate and be a normal nation.</p>\n\n<p>Bil'am knew that as we have it in the haggada, the Bnai Yisrael would never forget what Hashem had done and could wind up affecting all the rest of the world. This was something he definitely did not want to happen</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to Rav Hirsch, Balak said the main situation was not that this was a particular people, but that a people who had been completely submerged in the power of the Egyptian Empire had wrested themselves free and were now going to completely destroy the surrounding nations (even if they are not going to attack Moav directly).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9950#v=5&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Balak 22:5</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הִנֵּה עַם יָצָא מִמִּצְרַיִם The repetition of הִנֵּה shows that with\n  עַם יָצָא מִמִּצְרַיִם a separate thought is given for his\n  consideration. The fact that עַם יָצָא מִמִּצְרַיִם, that a mass of\n  people politically and socially submerged in the power and nationality\n  of Egypt could go out of Egypt as a socially united people to freedom\n  and independence, marks this people as something unique. And it is to\n  the cause which could have effected this remarkable unheard-of event\n  which your mind must concentrate on, if you are willing to help my\n  purpose to be achieved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Bil'am knew who they were and what was occurring as a result of Hashem's specific will. He knew that it was not some random people showing the breakout from Egypt, but was <strong>the</strong> people, the specific people that Hashem had taken out <em>גוי מקרב גוי</em> and the answer to Balak's request <strong>as asked</strong> would be <em>Tell Balak not to worry, they are moving at my explicit command and will not invade you</em>. Bil'am, on the other hand wanted to see them destroyed and actually tried to get Balak to fight them. As Rashi says on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9950#v=11&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Balak 22:11</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>curse it</strong>: Heb. קָבָה לּי. [This expression used by Balaam] is stronger than\n  אָרָה לּי [used by Balak in verse 6], for it specifies\n  and details [the curse]- [Mid. Tanchuma Balak 5, Num. Rabbah 20:9]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>and drive it out</strong>: of the world. Balak said only, “and I will drive him\n  out of the land” (verse 6). [His intention was:] I want only to\n  get them away from me, but Balaam hated them more than did Balak. —\n  [Mid. Tanchuma Balak 5, Num. Rabbah 20:9]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, Bil'am referred to <strong>this</strong> people in order to avoid any possibility of it being someone or something other than Bnai Yisrael as well as to avoid the possibility of being told to reassure Balak that they would not invade Moav and would not need to be fought off.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Malbim (Numbers 22:5) explains that Bil'am's description of \"the nation\" is more natural, since the Jewish people and their exploits were well known. Balak, on the other hand, tried to downplay Israel's fame and greatness, referring to them as merely \"a nation\", so that Bil'am wouldn't be discouraged from confronting them.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, perhaps the changes are inconsequential. Perhaps, for example, Bil'am didn't remember the exact wording. That the changes are inconsequential is implied by the Akedat Yitshak (Shaar 82) who writes that Bilam and Balak said the exact same thing: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר בלעם וכו' הנה העם היוצא ממצרים וגו'. עם היות שהמאמרים הללו הן הן דברי בלק </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Our souls are also open and hidden, therefore the soul blesses\n  as if it is near and as if it is far as the verses state: “My soul\n  blesses G-d and all that is close to me , His holy name.; my soul\n  blesses G-d and G-d, my G-d, you have become very great; who covers\n  light like a garment; the deep, you covered it like with a garment; at\n  your rebuke they fled.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Perhaps the declaration of forgiveness is essentially the introduction to this request, as if to say, \"God, just as I forgive all who have acted against me, please forgive me for having acted against you\".</p>\n\n<p>2) The origin for this custom may be the Gemara Megilla 28a, which recounts Mar Zutra's declaration of forgiveness every night. According to the Bach's version of the text, it reads \"God should forgive all who have wronged me\". It was a plea to God to forgive them, in addition to being implicitly a declaration of his own forgiveness. Perhaps that is the implicit meaning of the words 'ribono shel olam' here.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The simple answer is that it is not a legal declaration. One does not have a legal right to exact retribution from those who have angered him, which he can formally waive. Rather, God may punish those who wrong others, but may not if the victims forgive the perpetrator. Unlike for example, when forgiving a monetary debt; a purely legalistic action, in which divine punishment is not on the line, here the whole thrust is that the perpetrator not be punished; hence the explicit request: ולא יענש שום אדם בסיבתי; that others not be punished on the speaker's account. This is a prayer, very different in nature from a legal declaration, and therefore addresses God. Nullifying hammets is a formal legal procedure, which does not require invoking God. Asking God not to punish a sinner, is a prayer which naturally invokes God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14081&st=&pgnum=261&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 19:17</a> says not to hate your neighbor in your heart.

It is common to address G-d in a tefillah prior to performing mitzvoth. (See, e.g. the declaration prior to waving the lulav.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Balak ending on a sad note\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The end of parshas Balak is the sin at Shitim with the Bnos Moav, culminating in the sin of Zimri and Cozbi. Pinchas kills them both, stopping the plague. That would have been a good place to stop, but the last verse says (Numbers 25:9):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּהְי֕וּ הַמֵּתִ֖ים בַּמַּגֵּפָ֑ה אַרְבָּעָ֥ה וְעֶשְׂרִ֖ים אָֽלֶף׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>Those who died of the plague numbered twenty-four thousand. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's a rather depressing note. The Rema in OC 138:1 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>. וִיכַוֵּן שֶׁיַּתְחִיל תָּמִיד לִקְרֹא בְּדָבָר טוֹב, וִיסַיֵּם בְּדָבָר טוֹב</p>\n  \n  <p>And one should aim to always begin to read on a good matter and to end on a good matter</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why does the parsha end in a way that doesn't fit this halacha? Better yet, stop before the whole story with Shittim. I must admit I haven't checked this Rema against every aliyah in the Torah, and for all I know there are other counter examples, but this one is pretty striking. Now I wonder if someone would argue that it's good the sinners died, but I think it's pretty bad that the sinning got to such a level that that many died.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><em>Baruch Hashem</em>, I'm not alone.

Why is there an inconsistency in the pesukim?</p>\n\n<p>This question is asked with the assumption that there is a difference between the use of the root words \"דבר\" and \"אמר\" in the Torah. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/35820/5323\">this question</a> for more information.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The change in wording is related to the intention of Bilaam. And this corresponds to a concept that appeared earlier in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>In Shemot 19:3 it says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כה תאמר לבית יעקב גו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi, borrowing from the Mechilta, explains that this expression of <em>saying</em> (root of אמר) means to speak gently.</p>\n\n<p>The expression of <em>speaking</em> (דבר) has a connotation of severity, like in ordering someone.</p>\n\n<p>In the first posuk, it is emphasizing that Bilaam's intention, which Balak followed out, was to curse harshly.</p>\n\n<p>But what they discovered in the first two attempts to openly curse was that it didn't work. G-d converted the words of the curses into blessings. And this is what Billam explained to Balak in BeMidbar 23:12 when Balak complained to him asking, Why, if he had intended to curse Israel, did he actually bless them? Bilaam explained:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הלא את אשר ישים הוי׳ בפי אתו אשמר <strong>לדבר</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But after two failed attempts to openly curse, Bilaam realized that G-d would not allow Israel to be openly cursed at that time like is stated in BeMidbar 24:1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וירא בלעם כי טוב בעיני הוי׳ לברך את-ישראל גו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And so Bilaam changed his strategy. He tried to bring a curse through gentle words like it states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא-הלך כפעם בפעם לקראת נחשים גו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is what is implied by Balak's action in BeMidbar 23:30, that he did as Bilaam <em>said</em> (אמר) with a more gentle expression.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Yoav considered a murderer regarding Uriah the Hittite?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Samuel I chapter 11, David commands Yo'av to place Uriah the Hittite in the middle of a battle so that, inevitably, the enemy would kill him while he is unprotected. Yo'av carries out the command.</p>\n\n<p>Is Yo'av considered a murderer, halachically?</p>\n\n<p>Considerations / Questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Yo'av himself did not kill Uriah, but he intentionally placed him in danger so that it was highly likely that he would have been killed. It was also clear, that Yoav's intent was to have him killed, but by someone else. In general, if someone intentionally places another in a place where death to that person is certain, does that make him liable for murder?</p></li>\n<li><p>David was the king. If the king commands you to kill someone and you disobey the king, the king has a right to kill you for being a rebel against the kingdom. Yo'av did not know why David wanted Uriah killed. He was just a messaneger. So, even if Yo'av had killed Uriah himself, would that excuse him from being a murderer, because he is carrying out the king's command?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Kiddushin 43a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האומר לשלוחו צא הרוג את הנפש הוא חייב ושולחיו פטור  שמאי הזקן אומר משום חגי הנביא  שולחיו חייב שנא' (שמואל ב יב, ט) אותו הרגת בחרב בני עמון</p>\n  \n  <p>One who says to his agent: \"Go and kill someone\" - he is liable, but his sender is not. Shamai the Elder said in the name of Chagai the prophet that his sender is liable, as it says (Shmuel 2:12:9), \"[Uriah] you (David) have killed with the sword of the Children of Amon.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara proceeds to do a technical analysis of the two opinions based on the preceding daf regarding the general principle that one is not liable for his agent's sins performed on his behalf (ein shliach l'devar aveirah). It presents several such expositions; I will quote just the last one, which is relevant to the passuk quoted above:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואיבעית אימא  שאני התם דגלי רחמנא אותו הרגת בחרב בני עמון</p>\n  \n  <p>ואידך  הרי לך כחרב בני עמון  מה חרב בני עמון אין אתה נענש עליו אף אוריה החתי אי אתה נענש עליו </p>\n  \n  <p>מאי טעמא מורד במלכות הוה דקאמר ליה (שמואל ב יא, יא) ואדוני יואב וכל עבדי אדוני על פני השדה חונים </p>\n  \n  <p>If you rather, I can say [to explain Shamai's opinion] that the passuk specifies \"he you have killed with the sword of the Children of Amon.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>And [the Tanna Kama]? [Uriah's murder] is to you like the sword of the Children of Amon - just as you are not liable for the sword of the Children of Amon, so, too, for Uriah the Chiti you are not liable. </p>\n  \n  <p>Why not? He rebelled against the kingdom, as it says (Shmuel 2:11:11): \"My master, Yoav, and all the servants of my master [are] encamped on the face of the field.\" [Uriah is speaking to David in this passuk - the second reference to \"my master\" is David, not Yoav. As he referred to Yoav as his master before David, it was considered an affront to the kingdom and was tantamount to rebelling. Thus explains Rashi.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short: everyone holds Yoav was liable. For further reading on David's liability, see Avodah Zarah 5a and Shabbos 56a. For practical halacha in case you want to hire a mercenary yourself, see the full Gemara in Kiddushin, 42b through the above Gemaras, then see Rambam, Hilchos Rotzeiach 2:2-3.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Good point Dan. Neither Yoav nor David can be sentenced to death by the sanhedrin since there was no act of murder (though there are some who disagree with the above thinking that there was a direct act of murder, but this is not the simple understanding of the narrative in Tanach), only an indirect cause of murder (גרמא), and there can be no death penalty. However, a person can be guilty of murder even in such a case (בדיני שמים). see rambam Rotzeach 2:2. </p>\n\n<p>From the gemara in kiddushin 43a it is evident that the agent is always guilty of murder and may be sentenced to death (provided that it was direct murder) but regarding the sender there is disagreement between the sages. So in our case Yoav the agent would be guilty of murder (but not sentenced to death since it was indirect), but regarding David there would be a disagreement between the sages if he is guilty as well. However, as you already pointed out, it is likely that Yoav was unaware of David's evil intentions. In such a case there would be no doubt that Yoav is a Shogeg at worst and not guilty of the crime. </p>\n\n<p>P.s. there is no indication in kiddushin whether Yoav was guilty or not, they only argue whether king David was guilty as a sender.   </p>\n\n\n",

This is just a synopsis of what I wrote, for my specific examples, I refer you to that essay.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Malbim offers two ways of differentiating between the terms. First, he argues that the word yerusha is related to the word reshut (“domain” or “charge”) and simply denotes the transfer of property from one party’s domain to another’s. Nachala, on the other hand, refers specifically to the transfer of property in the transgenerational continuum of parent to child. </li>\n<li>Malbim also explains that yerusha focuses on the inheritance as a legal transfer of property whether or not it was sanctioned by the inheritee, while nachala refers specifically to when the inheritor willingly bequeaths his belongings to his inheritee.</li>\n<li>Rabbi Shmuel Dovid Luzzatto (1800-1865), known as Shadal, posits a fundamental difference between the Hebrew words nachala and yerusha. He proposes that the word nachala denotes one who receives his inheritance as part of a greater undertaking of divvying up a specific estate. One who receives a nachala does so alongside others who also receive their portion. Shadal even contends that the word nachala is related to the word chelek (“portion”), as both words contain the CHET-LAMMED combination.</li>\n<li>Others explain that nachala refers specifically to the passage of inheritance from father to son, while yerusha denotes any form of inheritance between relatives, even if not to one’s direct descendants.</li>\n<li>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808-1888), in an almost-prophetic synopsis of current events, identifies the difference between yerusha and nachala as reflective of two opposing ways in which the younger generation may relate to the older generation. In one model, the younger generation views itself as primary, rejects its connection to the past, and takes for itself everything the elders had built up. In such a case, the inheritance of the younger generation may aptly be called a yerusha. In the second model, the younger generation views itself as the continuation of previous generations. Inheritance under this more conservative paradigm is called nachala because, like a river (nachal), it flows seamlessly and naturally. In this, preferred model, there is no disconnection or repudiation, as both the older and younger generations are of one continuum, and the young appreciate the old.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <em><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/whats-in-a-word\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's in a Word?</a></em>, \"<a href=\"https://ohr.edu/this_week/whats_in_a_word/7949\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A Heritage of Inheritance</a>\" by Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Partial answer:</p>\n\n<p>I love this question, because I have used it in a few of my Rosh Hashanna or Yizkor sermons in the past.</p>\n\n<p>I am quite certain that Art Scroll (Stone) Chumash explains this difference in the 2nd verse that you cited. I don't have access to the source before me now, so, I am summarizing from what I recall. I'll try to edit in later when I can locate this source.</p>\n\n<p>He explains that נחלה means \"inheritance\" and it comes from the root form נחל meaning a stream. When someone receives an inheritance, it is a gift that flows from one generation to the next, but as with any flow, it eventually stops at some point. For example, when one receives money as part of the inherited estate, one may use it as he wishes for himself. Once the money has been used, it's not around to pass to the next generation.</p>\n\n<p>I have to research the other usages. The last verse that you cited which has both is curious.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, מורשה  means \"heritage\". <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14085&st=&pgnum=430&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rash\"i and Ramba\"n</a> (among others) explain that a  מורשה  is an item that becomes a continuous endless \"gift\" that is required to be passed to all future generations until the end of time. This is why the Torah is called מורשה  .</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Judaism/Heritage-and-inheritance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Riskin</a> gives the same explanation of these two words but expands on the idea by claiming that an inheritance is given over easily. a heritage is given via much intensive work. he also emphasizes that together with the Torah, as mentioned in the verse that you cited, the land of Israel is also called a <em>Morasha</em> (Shemot 6:9.) These are the <strong>only</strong> two items that the Torah calls a <em>morasha</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Morasha is not an inheritance which the inheritor can dispose of if he wishes. It is more of an heirloom which he must hand over to future generations intact. The inheritor is not the owner but merely a trustee. \nThe Torah and Eretz Yisroel are the only two examples.</p>\n\n\n",

But nowadays we see that women do so, and yet we do not say anything to them. He said to him: And according to your reasoning, how do you explain that which Rava said: A person should not sit at the entrance to an alleyway, next to the side post that has been placed at the edge of an alleyway in order for it to be considered a private domain, as perhaps an object will roll away from him and he will come to carry it four cubits in the public domain, thereby transgressing a biblical prohibition? But don’t these women take their jugs, and go, and sit at the entrance to an alleyway, and we do not say anything to them? Rather, the accepted principle is: Leave the Jews alone; it is better that they be unwitting sinners and not be intentional sinners. If people engage in a certain behavior that cannot be corrected, it is better not to reprove them, as they are likely to continue regardless of the reproof, and then they will be sinning intentionally. It is therefore preferable for them to be unaware that they are violating a prohibition and remain merely unwitting sinners. Here, too, with regard to clapping and dancing, leave the Jews alone; it is better that they be unwitting sinners and not be intentional sinners. The Gemara comments: There were those who understood that this principle applies only to rabbinic prohibitions but not to Torah prohibitions, with regard to which the transgressors must be reprimanded. However, this is not so; it is no different whether the prohibition is by Torah law or whether it is by rabbinic law, we do not say anything to them. For example, on the eve of Yom Kippur, there is an obligation that one begin the fast while it is still day, before sunset, as the extension of Yom Kippur. During this time, one must observe all the halakhot. This mitzva of extending Yom Kippur is by Torah law, and yet people eat and drink until darkness falls but we do not say anything to them, as we know they will pay no attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This principle is used by later halachic authorities (such as by the Rosh and Ramo with regard to the already widespread consumption of <em>chodosh</em>) and is also mentioned by the <em>Maharatz Chiyus</em> in his <em>Darkhei Hahora'a</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

The Ba'eir Heitev seems to say that when he writes \"v'kubah melashon kavatah\".</p>\n\n<p>[The Ibn Ezra's first explanation, בקובה שהיתה שם עם אחי זמרי is that the second word, kavatah does NOT refer to the woman's organs but, again, to the tent.]</p>\n\n<p>Is this word play an extension of the words used in 23:8, \"מָ֣ה אֶקֹּ֔ב לֹ֥א קַבֹּ֖ה\" with the similar root meaning to curse or damn?</p>\n\n<p>Do the words indicate any significant interpretive distinction or is this simply a literary choice to echo other words?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is a hint that may explain why the text chooses קֻבָּה instead of אֹהֶל to mean 'tent' in Bilam's Blessings to the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>The text in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0424.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 24:5</a> reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה  מַה-טֹּבוּ <strong>אֹהָלֶיךָ</strong>, יַעֲקֹב; מִשְׁכְּנֹתֶיךָ, יִשְׂרָאֵל.</p>\n<p>How goodly are thy <strong>tents</strong>, O Jacob, thy dwellings, O Israel!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The word used for <strong>tent</strong> here is אֹהֶל (which is related to א-ה-ל = light), representing Am Yisroel's dwellings and its sanctity.</p>\n<p>While in the posuk describing the midianite's tent קֻבָּה is used (from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44107&st=&pgnum=325\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">קבב = to curse</a>) representing the sinner's dwelling and its immorality.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9953#v=8&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 25:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He went after the Israelite man into the chamber</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates it as <em>into the alcove</em>.

This is uniquely used by Bil'am</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1583304312\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew</em></a>, based on the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/83925/9682\">writings of R' Hirsch</a>, the root קבב simply means to \"hollow.\" Thus:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"to curse\" - לכה קבה לי (earlier in the Bilam passage - Bamidbar 22:11). Seemingly he views a curse as a cessation of blessing - a \"hollowing out\" thereof. He would not be alone in this view, but I cannot find others who say the same.</li>\n<li>\"to remove support\" - מה אקב לא קבה א-ל. Interesting that he does not view this as the same as a curse. Perhaps here he means not to curse but to \"remove Hashem's support\". Thus: how can I remove them from existence? Hashem will not remove His support from them.</li>\n<li>\"capacity measure\" - the ubiquitous measure known as a קב. Presumably because you measure things in a hollow container.</li>\n<li>\"alcove\" - your passuk of a קובה. It's simply called as such because it's a big, open space.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although he doesn't mention it, the similar wording of \"stomach\" (זרוע לחיים ו<strong>קבה</strong>, or your passuk of stabbing Kozbi in her קבה) now makes sense - it's a hollow cavity inside the body.</p>\n\n<p>I believe we can now answer our original question of why it uses the word of קבה instead of אהל. What do all of the other words on the list have in common? They're used for destructive purposes. To curse. To destroy. Even the wording of her stomach, Rashi to that passuk says that he stabbed them in the place where they sinned. As for קב? Maybe because \"one who loves money will never be satisfied with money\" (Koheles 5:9), and measures are often used to cheat people in business (see Vayikra 19:35-36).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, our passuk uses קבה instead of אהל in order to demonstrate that he was using it for a destructive purpose as well.</p>\n\n\n",

Shouldn't one try to attach himself to G-d?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Yes, one attaches oneself to G-d, but that is not in conflict with the comment of Rabbi Nachman.</p>\n\n<p>A better translation would be: Everyone needs to intend during their prayer, that he will bind himself to the <em>Saints of the generation</em>, because every Saint that is in the generation is the aspect of <em>Moshe/Moshiach</em>, like we find that the Saints call each other <em>Moshe</em>, like: <em>Moshe, you have spoken well...</em></p>\n\n<p>There are two aspects to the Jewish people, that of the individual (היחיד) and that of the whole (הצבור). The Moshe/Moshiach aspect mentioned by Rabbi Nachman is the צבור.</p>\n\n<p>This is part of the sentiment expressed in Avot 2:4 said in the name of Hillel, \"אל תפרוש מן הצבור\" (Do not separate from the <em>Tzibbur</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We learn that this aspect of Tzibbur pertains to Moshe from BeMidbar 11:21 which says:</p>\n\n<p>ויאמר משה שש-מאות אלף רגלי העם אשר אנכי בקרבו כו׳</p>\n\n<p>That at the innermost point of every individual from the Jewish people, they are considered as one through the inclusive, comprehensive aspect of soul, commonly called the <em>pintele Yid</em> which is the aspect we emphasize in the long Tachanun:</p>\n\n<p>שומר גוי אחד, שומר שארית עם אחד ואל יאבד גוי אחד המיחדים שמך כו׳</p>\n\n<p>This same idea is understood in connection to Moshiach from the prayer said before bringing out the Sefer Torah for the three festivals which includes the words from Isaiah 11:2:</p>\n\n<p>ויתקים בנו  מקרא שכתוב, ונחה עליו רוח הוי׳, רוח חכמה ובינה, רוח עצה   וגבורה, רוח דעת ויראת הוי׳ כו׳</p>\n\n<p>That posuk is referring specifically to Moshiach in Isaiah and so we are focusing on that aspect of Moshiach that exists within each and every individual.</p>\n\n<p>And so, in the part of Likkeutei Moharan which you quoted, it is emphasizing that all of the saints in a given generation share this quality of Moshe. To put this in context, the saints of the generation are equated with the <em>Eyes of the Congregation</em>, the Princes of the tribes. In Aramaic they are given the title, אמרכל which means literally <em>All say</em>. That they speak for the whole group which they represent.</p>\n\n<p>But Moshe is the one who unifies <em>them</em> (the Saints of the generation). He is the leader of all and is referred to in Aramaic as נשיא. That there is one individual who is the manifestation of this <em>Moshe quality</em> in each generation.This is what is described by Chazal as אתפשטותא דמשה שבכל דרא ודרא.</p>\n\n<p>All of these ideas are emphasized in the continuation of the paragraph in Likkutei Moharan, which you left out and the paragraph which follows it.</p>\n\n<p>Rebbe Nachman brings out that the gematria of Moshe (משה, 345) is also the gematria of Shilo (שילה, 345), the name used in the Prophets for Moshiach. He is explaining that this is talking about the underlying concept shared by Moshe Rabbeinu and Moshiach.</p>\n\n<p>In the paragraph which follows, he goes on to say that each prayer is equated with a piece of the Mishkan. That the sum total of all the prayers from all the individuals corresponds to all the individual parts for a complete Mishkan. But the Torah explains in Shemot 40:17-34, that only Moshe, distinct among all the Jewish people, has been given the unique ability to assemble all the parts together as one single unified structure.</p>\n\n<p>This uniqueness is based on the description of Moshe from the Torah (BeMidbar 12:7) which says, \"<strong>בכל ביתי נאמן הוא</strong>\", (In my whole house, he is faithful.)</p>\n\n<p>All the individual contributors to the Mishkan must <strong><em>bring their specific parts to Moshe</em></strong> for assembly in order to <strong><em>reveal</em></strong> G-d's presence below.</p>\n\n<p>And so, the intention to attach ones prayers to the Saints of the generation, and in turn to Moshe who is equated with Moshiach, is to follow that same procedure described in the written Torah.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Though having a different understanding of what a <em>Tzaddik</em> is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Noam_Elimelech,_Sefer_Devarim,_Eikev.3-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noam Elimelech</a> on <em>Parshas Eikev</em> provides an interesting insight on this concept.</p>\n<p>(<em>Source from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria.org</a></em>)</p>\n<p>(<em>Partial quote</em>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>או יאמר \"והיה עקב תשמעון כו'\", \"עקב\" הוא רמז לאנשים כאלה שאין להם שכל ובינה להשיג גדולת הבורא ועבודתו שלימה לעבדו באמת ובשלימות, רק שהם מחברים עצמם אל אנשי צדק ואמת היודעים ומכירים גדולת הבורא ב\"ה ועובדים באמת, אזי נחשב גם להם כאילו גם הם עשו עבודתם שלימה כהצדיקים השלימים</p>\n<p><em>\"And it will be (EIKEV) because of your listening etc.\" (Deut 7:12), \"EIKEV\" alludes to those who do not have the intelligence and understanding to perceive the greatness of the Creator and His complete task so as to serve him with honesty and perfection.

It depends on how the custom originated, as that would dictate some of the rules.</p>\n\n<p>I'm inferring from your question that the bar mitzvah boy inherited the custom from his father who did not wear a tallit until his marriage. The article says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Iggeros Moshe, Even Ha-Ezer 1:59) writes that\n  there is no such thing as a local custom in America. Everyone who\n  moves to America must keep their prior customs. Similarly, Rav Shlomo\n  Zalman Auerbach (quoted in R. Yerachmiel Fried, Yom Tov Sheini\n  Ke-Hilkhaso 19:5) rules similarly that Jerusalem has no single custom\n  and no one who moves there may change his customs, except for a few\n  unique customs accepted by all the communities there. However,\n  according to the Pri To’ar, there is also a concept of a family\n  custom. Even if you move to a place with an established custom, you\n  still have to follow your family customs. Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv\n  rules this way.2 Rav Hershel Schachter (“Hashbei’a Hishbi’a” in Beis\n  Yitzchak 39, 2007) explains that some customs are family-based and\n  some locale-based, although they are not always easy to differentiate.\n  You must follow a family custom even if you move to a place that has a\n  different custom. He adds that if you change families, you change\n  family customs. One example is a woman who marries and, generally\n  speaking, adopts the customs of her husband’s family. However,\n  sometimes a man with little knowledge of his lineage (e.g. a ba’al\n  teshuvah) marries a woman of prominent lineage and adopts her family’s\n  customs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later, in the article, it says that one who wants to change customs must perform <em>hatarat nedarim</em> - annulment of vows.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can tell, common practice is to follow Rav Schachter's ruling and stay with the family custom even when one moves to a different place. </p>\n\n\n",

Ovadyah Yosef (Yabia Omer VIII YD 30) discusses the topic and raises your issue from Rambam's description of the point of the encounter with Mezuzah. He points out the language of both Rambam and SA and their sources in Bavli (Menachos 31b and Rashi there) and Yerushalmi (Megillah 4:12; see Tos. to Menachos 33a \"Ha\") which communicate the practice of rolling the Mezuzah and how it should be done. However, he draws upon Menachos 34b that clearly indicates that rolling is not necessary, and therefore concludes that having it flat and visible would be technically completely acceptable. However, he notes that since throughout Halachic literature Mezuzah is always assumed and described as being rolled and covered it is definitely preferable to perform the Mitzvah as classically described.

Mind you, the scanned quality is not the greatest, but it is readable and represents what's on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>One thing you can try in the PDF reader is adjusting the scaling and / or the grey scale and some other settings. Maybe, that will fix the problem. Beyond that, there may be some other problem with your computer configuration that would leave us guessing, I'm afraid.</p>\n\n<p>You may want to pose your problem directly to them.

From the narrative, it seems that Hashem \"hid\" his grave. I have read and heard many interpretations as to why Hashem hid his grave, including that He didn't want Moshe's grave to become a shrine for avodah zarah, He didn't want the Bnei Yisrael to feel like they couldn't move on from where their leader was buried, etc.</p>\n<p>But one thing really stands out to me. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14384&st=&pgnum=180\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim Rabbah 3:16</a> says that Moshe will accompany Eliyahu HaNavi in the end of days.

If they are to come together, it would seem to make perfect sense that Moshe, like Eliyahu, did not die, but that he was taken up to Shamayim.</p>\n<p>This would explain why his grave spot is unknown.</p>\n<p>I suppose my question is, are there any sources that would support this claim?

Elsewhere, in Parshas Vaes’chanan 2:10, the Midrash states that Moshe was buried in the desert together with his people so that upon Resurrection he will lead them all to the Land. Combining these two Midrashim, it would seem that Moshe together with his whole generation will be resurrected and will appear with Eliyahu upon the arrival of Mashiach. (This opinion is cited in the Responsa entitled Lev Chaim, Vol. I, p. 32.)

I only found one relevant halacha.</p>\n\n<p>Hilchos Tisha Baav Simman 558</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּתִשְׁעָה בְּאָב לְעֵת עֶרֶב הִצִּיתוּ אֵשׁ בַּהֵיכָל וְנִשְׂרַף עַד שְׁקִיעַת הַחַמָּה בְּיוֹם עֲשִׂירִי, וּמִפְּנֵי כָּךְ מִנְהָג כָּשֵׁר שֶׁלֹּא לֶאֱכֹל בָּשָׂר וְשֶׁלֹּא לִשְׁתּוֹת יַיִן בְּלֵיל עֲשִׂירִי וְיוֹם עֲשִׂירִי. הַגָּה: וְיֵשׁ מַחְמִירִין עַד חֲצוֹת הַיּוֹם וְלֹא יוֹתֵר (הַגָּהוֹת מַיְמוֹנִי); אִם חָל תִּשְׁעָה בְּאָב בְּשַׁבָּת וְנִדְחָה לְיוֹם א', מֻתָּר לֶאֱכֹל בָּשָׂר וְיַיִן יוֹם ב', אֲבָל בַּלַּיְלָה אָסוּר מִפְּנֵי אֲבֵלוּת שֶׁל יוֹם (מַהֲרִי''ל). ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>In the evening of the 9th of Av, a flame engulfed the Heichal and burned until sunset of the 10th. Therefore the custom is to refrain from meat and wine on the night of the 10th and the day. Rema: some are strict until noon and no later. If Tisha Baav falls on Shabbos and is pushed off until Sunday, it is permissible to ear meat and drink wine the next day, but not the night after due to the mourning of the day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can infer from this that only after Tisha Baav a person shouldn't break their fast with meat, unlike other fasts. However you could argue that in general you shouldn't and after Tisha Baav is more strict since you can't have meat even after you break your fast.</p>\n\n<p>However the Rema's last halacha is telling. If Tisha Baav is pushed off to the next day, really there's no problem eating meat afterwards, if not for the problem of the mourning of the day.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah Seif kattan 5 infers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה) מפני אבילות של יום - משמע דרק בזה מפני אבילותו של ט\"ב מחמרינן גם בלילה שאחריו דהוא כמו בין המצרים דיש אנשים שמחמירין על עצמן מבשר ויין אבל בשארי תעניתים אין להחמיר בזה:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Because of the mourning. Sounds like it's only because of the mourning of Tisha Baav are we strict not to eat meat even the night after, since it's like the 3 weeks that there are those who are strict not to eat meat. However regarding other fasts a person shouldn't be strict.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the MB is discussing eat meat that night, not with what to break your fast.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anyone who actually prohibits breaking a fast with meat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This may be a matter of health rather than halacha.

Rather, when you open the bottle, you must pour the contents into another vessel before drinking. On the other hand, Rav Moshe (Igrot Moshe YD 2:40) writes that it is not an issue to drink from the Snapple bottle since the Jew who opens it is considered the one who created the vessel and then it would not require tevilah. Chacham Ben-Zion Abba Shaul (Or Litzion OC 1:24) agrees. Alternatively, R' Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg (Sridei Esh YD 2:29) suggests a different solution. He says when you buy the Snapple, just have in mind not to acquire the bottle and then you have no issue as you do not own the vessel and you can drink from the bottle. Rav Menashe Klein (Mishne Halachot 4:107) writes that it is permissible since one doesn’t have in mind to acquire the bottle because nobody wants to buy something prohibited. For a similar idea, see Yabia Omer 7:9:3.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notably, while it sounds like Rav Moshe Feinstein, zt\"l, as cited, might be lenient, the leniency of the Seridei Eish is unlikely to apply to your case.  Furthermore, if you are talking about a case where the manufacturer truly intends the utensil to be repeatedly reused, it may be that even Rav Moshe might not have included it in his lenient ruling, depending on whether his source case of wine barrels is interpreted as having been intended for reuse (see @doubleAA's comment on you question).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is it our responsibility to bring a Chatas for the Moon's sin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshas Pinchos (Bamidbor 28:15), in the obligation to bring a Korban Chatas (sin offering) on Rosh Chodesh, Rashi brings two explanations:</p>\n\n<p>1) It is to atone for \"טומאת מקדש וקדשיו\" (defiling temple vessels) without knowledge, and Rashi says: \"ללמדך שמכפר על שאין בו ידיעה לא בתחילה ולא בסוף, שאין מכיר בחטא אלא הקב\"ה בלבד\" - which makes senses because a Chatas is appropriate for a sin done b'shogeig (unintentionally). </p>\n\n<p>2) According to a Midrash Aggada, it is to atone for the fact that HKBH reduced the moon (different opinions on what exactly the punishment was, but probably reducing its glow, rather than its size, and also waxing/waning): - \"ומדרשו באגדה אמר הקב\"ה, הביאו כפרה עלי על שמעטתי את הירח\". (Incidentally, Rashi's loshon is a bit strange because it doesn't actually mention the Moon sinning?)</p>\n\n<p>According to the second opinion, <strong>why should the Bnei Yisroel be responsible for making up for the Moon's sin?</strong> And as this is an aggada, and presumably the moon didn't actually \"sin\", its pretty hard to understand this as a reason to bring a chatas.</p>\n\n<p>Also, why is the second answer needed? Is there something deficient in the first answer?</p>\n\n<p>TIA</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<h2>Why both ideas?</h2>\n<p>We can address your final question - why did Rashi cite both of these explanations - on a simple, structural level by looking at the Talmud passage Rashi got them from. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shevuot.9a.5-9?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shevu'ot 9a</a>, the Talmud deals with an apparent tension between these two concepts, each of whose transmitters derive them from the same textual point - the fact that this <em>korban chatat</em>, unlike all others, is described by the Torah as \"לַיהוָ֑ה\" - \"for God.\" The Talmud resolves this tension by concluding that the particular phrasing of this \"extra\" word is special in two ways, permitting both of these concepts to be derived simultaneously. As the Talmud's conclusion is that both ideas reside in this verse, it makes sense that Rashi echoes that position.</p>\n<h2>Korban for the moon?</h2>\n<p>To address your more fundamental question - what's going on with this strange-sounding idea of a sin offering for the moon - we need to delve deeper, with the help of some later commentaries. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Maharal</a> addresses this idea at length in his <em>Gur Aryeh</em> supercommentary <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.28?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.28.15.1&lang2=bi&p3=Gur_Aryeh_on_Bamidbar.28.15.2&lang3=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">on this comment</a><sup>1</sup> of Rashi, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> explains this idea as well in <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/R._S.R._Hirsch/Bemidbar/28.15#m7e1n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his commentary on this verse</a><sup>2</sup>. They each come at it from different angles, but their explanations complement each other.</p>\n<h3>Maharal</h3>\n<p>The Maharal says that to understand this point in the Talmud, we need to understand that some of the terms used there and in the Torah have different meanings than people typically assign them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Kapara</em> here doesn't mean \"atonement for wrongdoing,\" but \"removal\" or \"cleansing.\" (As seen in Rashi's comment <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.21?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">on Genesis 32:21.</a>).</li>\n<li><em>Korban</em> is not an \"offering\" or \"sacrifice\" to appease or pay back, but a \"means of getting close.\" (Note that its root, קרב, means \"close.\")</li>\n<li><em>Chatat</em> here doesn't mean \"sin\" so much as \"deficiency.\" (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.31.39?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 39:31</a>, where אנכי אחטנה means \"I will make good the loss.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, <em>chatat</em> here doesn't refer to the moon's sin or, as if it could be said, to God's, but rather, to the moon's diminishment. From the point of view of the moon, it had as much right to being the supreme luminary in the sky as the sun does. However, from the point of view of the natural order, it simply didn't make sense to have two co-equal rulers. As described in a story in the Talmud on Chulin 60b, God therefore demoted the moon to secondary status, and it \"took one for the team.\"</p>\n<p>As the moon is diminished (<em>chatat</em>) from its \"rightful\" status, there is an opportunity to draw closer (<em>korban</em>) to God in an act of cleansing for (<em>kapara</em>) that deficiency. In general, the opportunity to draw closer to God comes specifically when one diminishes one's sense of self rather than puffing it up.<sup>3</sup> Also in general, the קרבן חטאת is not \"paying back for a sin,\" but \"re-connecting with God in light of the deficiency created by sin.\"</p>\n<p>This monthly <em>chatat</em> is therefore the Jewish nation's way to collectively respond to the moon's relative deficiency by recalling self-diminishment as an opportunity to come closer to God.</p>\n<h3>R' Hirsch</h3>\n<p>R' Hirsch also talks about the <em>korban chatat</em> as a response to a deficiency. He says that one is included in the offerings for each of the holidays to respond to the inadequacy of reality, compared to the lofty ideals of total dedication expressed by the holidays' <em>korbenot 'ola</em>. On Rosh Chodesh, when the theme is renewal after back-sliding, this concept is especially pertinent.</p>\n<p>The diminishment of the moon, according to R' Hirsch, is symbolic of the very concept of imperfection in the world. He points out something striking: \"Sins which human beings do are after all, in truth, the only bad things in God's world.\" If there's deficiency, it's thanks to our own choices.</p>\n<p>But why, people ask all the time, does God let people make evil choices? Because without the freedom to choose sin or virtue, we'd be animals or angels, but not people, and we would not have our reason for being: to dedicate ourselves to God through free-willed good choices. So, like the moon's dimunition, the presence of evil in the world is a necessary part of the scheme of things, sub-ideal though it might look.</p>\n<p>This special <em>korban chatat</em> of Rosh Chodesh, then, is not atoning for any particular sin. It's atoning for the fact that sin has to exist - that the moon can't just light the sky all night like the sun does the day. It's also reframing that apparent negative as a positive, acknowledging the great gift of free will, and dedicating it to God.</p>\n<p>R' Hirsch also relates these ideas to the Talmud's first explanation of this <em>korban</em> - that it's for those who became <em>tamei</em> without realizing it and then contaminated the holy places. In general, R' Hirsch sees being <em>tamei</em> as living under the illusion that physical forces are all there is, with no room for free will.<sup>4</sup> Those contemplated by this <em>korban</em> are in particular danger, in that they are trapped in that illusion without even knowing it. Along comes this general <em>chatat</em> each month to jerk us all out of our unconscious spiritual depression and restore our sense of free will.</p>\n<p>R' Hirsch concludes that the two ideas in the Talmud are really two sides of the same coin - dealing with the fact that we are necessarily imperfect and subject to physical forces by bringing us back to realizing the sublime free will that our imperfections enable.</p>\n<h3>Synthesis</h3>\n<p>I'm not sure how literally we're supposed to take the Maharal's understanding of the moon's deficiency and our cleansing for it, but the symbolic point is at least also there: When we contemplate our own limitations, we are at the point where we have the best opportunity to draw closer to God. It seems to me that this concept fits well with R' Hirsch's idea of the <em>chatat</em> - turning contemplation of our own [potential for] evil deeds into a celebration and rededication of our free will. For both of them, we bring the special Rosh Chodesh <em>chatat</em> to come closer to God over the very concept of deficiency, which the poor darkened moon, perforce embodies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

But, this seems to be a minority. It seems, then, that there must be a halachic requirement to read from parchment for the Torah but, there is no unanimous agreement that one must use a parchment for the Haftarah. Why this difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>You aren't the first person to wonder about this. The Levush wrote \"All my days I wondered why I never saw in any place the practice to write the Haftarot like a proper book as we do for Esther\" (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A9_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%93\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 284</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In truth though having a full set of Neviim is expensive and already in the time of the Gemara (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=60&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gittin 60a</a>) they permitted writing out just the needed Haftarot (called a Sefer Aftarta) and not the whole books (even though in general it is prohibited to write incomplete potions of books of Tanakh) because עת לעשות לה׳ it is worth violating certain laws to avoid the practice being lost entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham (OC 284) writes that \"nowadays\" with the advent of the printing press (which he considered Kosher writing) complete books became cheaper so writing Sifrei Aftarta returned to being prohibited. He finds a minority opinion in Rishonim that doesn't require proper black ink (Dyo) for Neviim and extends that to allowing paper as well. Thus a printed book of Navi would be considered Kosher.</p>\n\n<p>Today books are printed from computers (not hand operated printing presses) so it's highly questionable if the Magen Avraham's reasoning would still apply, let alone that it's relying on extensions of certain minority views. Plus it's also highly questionable if bound books are considered complete books (recall originally it was one long continuos scroll written on one side, not multiple sheets of paper written on both sides) which was the whole advantage of the Magen Avraham's position anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Thus especially today it makes sense to prefer a properly written Sefer Aftarta over printed works as was the practice for centuries (Eliyah Rabba 284, Arukh haShulchan 284, Yechavveh Da'at 5:26, Nefesh HaRav pg 161, Shulchan Shlomo 284, Chazon Ish (Shabbat) 6:11, Chevel Nachalato 17:12).</p>\n\n<p>If you have the money to buy a full set and not rely on the leniency in the Gemara, all the better!</p>\n\n<p>If all you have is printed books, most are lenient to still do the Haftara, because the Gemara already allowed ignoring laws to allow the Haftara to be read. It should be stressed that עת לעשות לה׳ is literally the most <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/702/759\">Bedieved</a> justification that can be given to a practice.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna Berura (OC 284 Shaar HaTziyun 4) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דבעיקר הדין יש לדבר בזה הרבה עיין באליה רבא ומיהו אין למחות ביד הנוהגים להקל דהוא בכלל עת לעשות לה׳ שקשה לכל ציבור לכתוב נביאים בקלף כדין אבל בוודאי הציבור שהיכולת בידם יש להם לכתוב נביאים כדין ובפרט בימינו שמפזרים הרבה כסף על תכשיטי בהכ״נ שאין נחוץ וכונתם לשם שמים כדי לקיים \"זה אלי ואנוהו\" בוודאי מצוה להתנאות בכתיבת נביאים הקדושים. ‏<br>\n  ...however one should not protest those who are lenient for it is within עת לעשות for it is hard for every community to write Neviim on Klaf as proper, but certainly a community which has the ability should write Neviim as proper, and especially in our days when lots of money is strewn on ornaments for the synagogue which aren't of pressing need and their intention is towards heaven to fulfill the verse \"this is my God and I will glorify him\" certainly it's a Mitzva to glorify with writing the holy Neviim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It seems quite likely that this pamphlet would be desecrated.</p>\n\n<p>Is one allowed to place such pamphlets or similar material in this way where it is quite likely that eventually it will be \"mishandled\"? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>From the requirement to place Torah items, and especially the names of G-d, in <em>geniza</em>, it is clear that it is prohibited to leave them where they might come to disgrace.</p>\n\n<p>See, e.g., Maimonides Laws of the Fundamentals of Torah Chapter 6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתבי הקדש כולן ופירושיהן וביאוריהן אסור לשורפם או לאבדם ביד והמאבדן ביד מכין אותו מכת מרדות. במה דברים אמורים בכתבי הקדש שכתבם ישראל בקדושה אבל אפיקורוס ישראל שכתב ספר תורה שורפין אותו עם האזכרות שבו. מפני שאינו מאמין בקדושת השם ולא כתבו לשמו אלא שהוא מעלה בדעתו שזה כשאר הדברים והואיל ודעתו כן לא נתקדש השם. ומצוה לשורפו כדי שלא להניח שם לאפיקורוסים ולא למעשיהם. אבל עובד כוכבים שכתב את השם גונזין אותו. וכן כתבי הקדש שבלו או שכתבן עובד כוכבים יגנזו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also, e.g. here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The earliest responsum I have seen on the subject is printed in the sefer Be’er Sheva, authored by one of the great Torah leaders of the early seventeenth century, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Eilenburg. He was a talmid of the Levush, and his sefer includes a haskamah from the Maharal of Prague! The Be’er Sheva reports that in his day, it was not uncommon for people to burn the worn-out printed editions of sifrei kodesh. Those who burned the sifrei kodesh claimed that this was more respectful than burying them, because burial often resulted in the sifrei kodesh being unearthed and therefore becoming treated disgracefully.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Be’er Sheva takes strong issue with this approach, noting that it is prohibited to destroy any type of kisvei hakodesh, and that burning them certainly violateshalachah. The claim that burying the sefarim leads to their desecration is unfounded, he states, because the desecration is a result of not burying the genizahcorrectly. As we mentioned above, the Gemara describes burying in earthenware vessels. If, indeed, all genizah were to be buried this way, argues the Be’er Sheva, then the kisvei hakodesh would never be strewn about after their burial. He concludes that worn-out, printed Torah material must be buried in earthenware vessels, just as one is required to bury sifrei Torah this way. This responsum of the Be’er Sheva is subsequently cited authoritatively by the Magen Avraham (154:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also Halachipedia's <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Burying_Religious_Articles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> on the topic, which claims there may be some room for leniencies:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a dispute regarding printing a paper with Divrei Torah which was done for temporary use and without intent of making it Kadosh.\n  footnote 8: Rav Asher Weiss (quoted by Rabbi Aryeh Lebowitz on <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/739819/Rabbi_Aryeh_Lebowitz/Ten_Minute_Halacha_-_Assorted_Sheimos_Issues\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/739819/Rabbi_Aryeh_Lebowitz/Ten_Minute_Halacha_-_Assorted_Sheimos_Issues</a>) is lenient because of the expense. \n   They however also cite that:\n      Organizations should not send out advertisements with the name of Hashem written on them because people may unknowingly throw it out. [21]\n      Many poskim write that one should not write a pasuk on an invitation as most people simply throw these away. [22]\n      Pesukim should not be placed in newspapers since the people will throw them away. [23]\n  footnotes 21-23:  Iggerot Moshe YD 2:134-135. Ginzei Hakodesh 7:17:footnote 35 quotes Rav Elyashiv that it would be permitted if you do not write the complete name of Hashem.\n  Iggerot Moshe 2:135, Ginzei Hakodesh 9:5, Halichos Shlomo Tefilla 20:footnote 72. Rav Hershel Schachter in a shiur on yutorah.org (min 1-2) agrees.Rav Moshe Heinemann, however, writes that the pasuk of od yeshama is only a melitza and not written as a pasuk and is therefore permitted.\n  Rav Elyashiv in Kovetz Teshuvot 1:115. This is based on the Shach 283:4 who writes that the reason Shulchan Aruch 283:4 says one shouldn't write pesukim on a Tallit is because someone may come to throw it away. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a gentile lead the Passover Seder?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At a recent family gathering, my younger brother said he had led the Seder during Passover this year. He explained that he'd been present the last several years, but this was his first time leading. (I think it was also at his home.)</p>\n\n<p>My understanding (from reading here and elsewhere) is that he would need to have converted to Judaism before he could do that. But he (and his wife) also talked about a trip they're taking to Israel this summer, and specifically said they were doing it as non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Please help me understand where I might be wrong, where my assumptions lie, and/or what I'm missing.</p>\n\n<p>Edited to answer questions from the comments:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are we Jewish?</strong> No. We grew up attending a Presbyterian church, and as far as I know, he still attends.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did he mean by \"leading\"?</strong> He was somewhat vague about what \"leading\" meant; he said something like, \"It's really a whole ceremony. There are things you say and talk about, then you share that type of food, and then there are other things you say and talk about.\"</p>\n\n<p>Edited again to add:</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for the kind responses so far. I suppose my real question is whether he has become so devoted to the idea of Israel that he's discarded any respect for the Law. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There are several problems with a non-Jew attending the Seder at all. First of all, Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 512 forbids cooking for the non-Jew on any Yom Tov. Thus, unless the cooking was done for all the Jews together, and no additional food was added for the non-Jew, it was forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>I must reiterate that this does not separate Pesach from the other holidays and as long as the halachos of cooking are adhered to it is allowable to have a nonJew as a guest.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jewish law does not forbid hosting non-Jews for a Passover seder.</p>\n  \n  <p>“There’s no such law,” says Benny Lau, the rabbi of the Ramban\n  congregation in Jerusalem, adding, “My father was for years an Israeli\n  diplomat and we always had non-Jewish guests on seder night. My uncle,\n  the former Chief Rabbi Israel Lau, always hosted Muslim and Christian\n  clerics.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, attending is different from <em>leading</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1798425/jewish/Correcting-Halachic-Misunderstandings.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a> points out</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One may not invite a non-Jew to a Yom Tov meal unless Shabbat\n  coincides with that Yom Tov. The reason for this is that one may\n  inadvertently cook for the non-Jew on Yom Tov, which is forbidden. On\n  Shabbat when one may not cook in any case, it is permitted to invite a\n  non-Jew.<sup>11</sup> If the non-Jew comes without being invited, one\n  may feed him on a regular Yom Tov as well but may not cook or heat up\n  food for him. There is no distinction between the Pesach Seder and\n  other Yom Tov days in this regard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consider that unless the non-Jew is there as part of studying for conversion, the wording of the hagada is inappropriate for the non-Jew. As an example, the \"Avodim Hayinu\" refers to our ancestors who were redeemed from Egypt. A convert is considered to be Jewish in all respects (like Rabbi Akivah who was descended from a convert), but a non-Jew who is not converting is not part of this.</p>\n\n<p>A non-Jew may not say a blessing for a Jew as he is not commanded in the mitzvos and may not say the blessings. Even a Jew who is not commanded in a particular mitzvah, may not say the blessing for a Jew who is commanded in that mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, once the temple has been rebuilt and the Paschal sacrifice re-instituted (במהרה בימינו) then it would be forbidden for the nonJew to take part. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9873#v=43\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 12:43</a>. </p>\n\n\n",

(Note that this wasn't the subject of my question, itself, there.)</p>\n\n<p>Part of the answer cites O.C. 233:1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגה: וּלְדִידָן בִּמְדִינוֹת אֵלּוּ שֶׁנּוֹהֲגִין לְהִתְפַּלֵּל\n  עַרְבִית מִפְּלַג הַמִּנְחָה, אֵין לוֹ לְהִתְפַּלֵּל מִנְחָה אַחַר\n  כָּךְ; וּבְדִיעֲבַד אוֹ בִּשְׁעַת הַדַּחַק, יָצָא אִם מִתְפַּלֵּל\n  מִנְחָה עַד הַלַּיְלָה, דְּהַיְנוּ צֵאת הַכּוֹכָבִים (בֵּית יוֹסֵף\n  בְּשֵׁם אֹהֶל מוֹעֵד וְרַשְׁבָּ''א).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It says that in \"emergency situations\" if one davened Mincha after plag, and followed it immediately with Ma'ariv before <em>tzet hokachavim</em>, this is fine.</p>\n\n<p>Would this scenario be considered \"She'at Hadhcak\"?</p>\n\n<p>In my shul, we have trouble getting a minyan (sound all too familiar?) We prefer to daven Mincha before plag and follow it with Ma'ariv (an opinion expressed as \"common practice\" in O.C. paragraph mentioned). But often, we have 7 people, and the Gabbai calls or \"what's-apps\" (is that really a valid verb??) people to come to shul to help form the minyan. By the time we get the minyan, it is after <em>plag</em>, so we're following the other opinion that allows davening <em>mincha</em> after plag is over until night time.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, in such cases, according to O.C., when one davens <em>mincha</em> after plag, he must wait until the stars emerge before davening Ma'ariv. However, those that came early will defect and leave the shul because the late-comers made them wait, unnecessarily.</p>\n\n<p>In short, would not having a minyan for Ma'ariv qualify under the condition of <em>She'at Hadchak</em>, or would everyone be forced to wait until the stars emerge?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0069_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">70:1</a>) writes that the custom is to <em>daven Ma'ariv</em> immediately following <em>Mincha</em>, because it would be a burden to gather a <em>Minyan</em> again.</p>\n\n\n",

Yet v. 1 seems to indicate that the Jews sinned with Moav as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וישב ישראל בשטים ויחל העם לזנות אל בנות <strong>מואב</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>And Yisrael dwelled in Shittim, and the people debased themselves to commit harlotry with the daughters <strong>of Moav</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, if Moav was involved with the incident at Shittim as well, why was the command to attack directed only at Midian?</p>\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar (to v. 17) translates ויחל not as \"they debased,\" as I did above, but \"they began.\" Thus, the war was not with Moav, because the Jews started up with Moav and not the other way around. Midian, on the other hand, started up with the Jews, and therefore the Jews were able to retaliate.</p>\n\n<p>He cites and explains a Sifrei (Ki Seitzei 117), also in line with translating it as \"they began,\" insinuating that \"they began\" with Moav but concluded with Amon. The same way that Lot's elder daughter was more explicit in her illicit relations by naming her son Moav, \"from father,\" while his younger daughter hid the act behind the name Ben-Ami, \"son of my nation,\" so, too, Moav's involvement in Shittim was explicit but Amon's was hidden. We see this in Devarim 23:4-5, where the prohibition to marry Moavi and Amoni converts is explained as being because they did not give you bread and water and because they hired Bilam. Why didn't they give bread and water? In order to lure them to the shops set up in Shittim for food, which lead to the sin.</p>\n\n<p>The question remains: Moav <em>did</em> start up with the Bnei Yisrael - they hired Bilam to curse the Jews, and the whole Shittim incident was Bilam's idea when cursing the Jews failed (Rashi to v.1). Further, based on the Sifrei he quotes, Moav withheld food from the Jews in order that they sin at Shittim. So <strong>how can he say that Bnei Yisrael started up with Moav, when in fact Moav started up with Bnei Yisrael?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, you are misunderstanding the Keli Yakar's answer.  He is not saying that a nation \"started up\" with another nation as far as battle is concerned.  He is using the diyuk of Vayachel to show that the daughters of Moav were not sent by Balak and Moav in order to seduce the Jewish men, but rather that the Jewish men went of their own accord to sin with the Moavi women.  Therefore, it is unfair to punish Moav for a sin they did not commit.</p>\n\n<p>According to Keli Yakar, Midian, on the other hand, sent out their daughters to specifically cause the Jewish men to sin.  That was something worthy of punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, despite the fact that all of these terrible things may have been done by Moav, at the end of the day, when it comes to punishing them for this sin, the only ones that deserve punishment are the Midianim.</p>\n\n\n",

What would have arisen on Moshe's mind to do war with them without permission? Rather, Moshe reasoned to himself with an a fortiori argument. He said: If regarding the Midianim, who only came to help Moav, the Torah said, \"Distress the Midianim and attack them\" (Bamidbar 25:17), the Moavim themselves all the more so [should be attacked]! Hashem [therefore] said to him: That which arises in your mind is not that which arises in Mine; there are two fine pigeons I must extract from them: Rus the Moaviah and Na'amah the Amonis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My problem arises from the story told in Bamidbar 31, in which the command to attack Midian is actually carried out.</p>\n\n<p>The pesukim describe how the Bnei Yisrael killed all of the Midiani men, while capturing the women and children. Moshe was upset at the army, as it was the women who caused the sin at Shittim; why were they left alive? Rather, they should kill all male children, all women who had had relations, and <strong>all female children who had not previously had relations would be left alive</strong> (v. 7-9, 14-18).</p>\n\n<p>Presumably things would have been no different had Moav been included in the command as well; the fact that Moav was also to be attacked should not have impacted their decision to only kill the men and not the women, and Moshe's response would not have been different.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, <strong>Rus and Na'amah would still have been able to be born, if the Moavi children were left alive as well.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So <strong>how could Ulla claim this as a reason not to attack Moav?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Logically no. Naamah was from Amon so that she would have been born anyway. However, Rus would not have been born as she was descended from the royal house of Moav which would have been wiped out. If some other female descendant had taken her place, she would not have been considered as being from Moav as conversion erases the nonJewish relationship and she would be from whatever tribe her father was from.</p>\n\n<p>Since Boaz was generations later, the patrilineal descent would have been different and the entire story of Rus could not have happened. Remember part of the story involved Elimelech going to Moav during the famine. Had Moav been wiped out, that could not have happened.</p>\n\n\n",

There are many Christian sites that set out a priori to hunt for and trap such innocent but clueless Jews.

On verse 2:11 he says originally Mordechai didn't want Achashverosh to choose Esther, and tried very hard to avoid her getting taken. Once she was, Mordechai was terrified Achashverosh would be terribly insulted at these attempts. If he found out her nation, he could wipe them out. And if he found out she came from a prominent family, it might seem that they think they're too good for him, and he could wipe out Mordechai and his relatives. Therefore he commanded her not to reveal her nation or family. He commanded both because if for some reason she can't hide her nation, she should still try to hide her family. This is because Achashverosh would more likely take out his fury on her family than her nation, so it was the more important secret.</p>\n\n<p>However, by verse 2:20 this fear was gone. Esther was firmly established as queen. There was no longer any need to keep this information from Achashverosh. Nevertheless, Esther kept the secret (he says this shows her righteousness and piety, I assume he means she kept her word even when it was no longer necessary). The smaller novelty is she didn't reveal her family, since that had the bigger danger involved. Not only that, but she even didn't reveal her nation, which by this point had a very unlikely chance of being in danger. This is why the verse switches it: She didn't reveal, not only her family, but even her nation. </p>\n\n<p>The Malbim to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Esther.2.20.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:20</a> gives a different explanation. Originally Achashverosh wanted to know who she was, and the normal way to find out who a person is to first know their nation, and then their family. However at this point, Achashverosh wanted to benefit her family, so that's what he wanted to know first. He even wanted to do good for her nation, so he asked that afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>edit: I see @jay beat me to the Malbim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Esther.2.20.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Malbim</a> asks this question and answers that initially they just wanted to know who she was, and the social norm was to inquire about nationality first when getting to know someone.

In spite of\n  all this honor, Esther would not reveal her lineage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A second explanation is given at <a href=\"http://www.etzion.org.il/en/why-did-esther-hide-her-identity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why Did Esther Hide Her Identity?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would like to suggest another answer, based on a close examination\n  of chapter 2, and in particular the immediate context of the verses\n  originally quoted. We are told:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Esther did not reveal her nationality and her descent for Mordekhai\n  had commanded her not to tell. And each day Mordekhai would walk about\n  before the court of the women's house to know how Esther was faring\n  and what would be done with her.\" (2:10-11)</p>\n  \n  <p>After Esther finds favor and grace in the eyes of the king and is\n  selected to be his new queen, we read:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Esther would not reveal her descent and her nationality, as Mordekhai\n  had commanded her, and Esther carried out Mordekhai's word as she used\n  to when she was in his custody.\" (2:20)</p>\n  \n  <p>In both instances the text attributes Esther's actions to Mordekhai's\n  command, and in both cases the text goes on to describe the behavior\n  of one of them: in the first instance, Mordekhai's behavior (\"Each\n  day...\"), and in the second instance, Esther's behavior (\"And Esther\n  carried out Mordekhai's word...\"). Both times the verb used is derived\n  from the root a-s-h (to do): first \"what would be done (ye'aseh) with\n  her,\" and then \"Esther carried out ('osah)...\"</p>\n  \n  <p>This teaches us that Mordekhai was animated by two concerns. First,\n  Mordekhai treats Esther like a father who loves his daughter. He is\n  concerned for her well-being and what will become of her, and he is\n  also concerned for her own actions and behavior. It should be noted\n  that at first, before she becomes queen, Mordekhai's primary concern\n  is for her welfare lest she - as a foreign girl - be treated badly.\n  Later, when she takes the place of Vashti as queen, this possibility\n  no longer troubles him and he begins to be concerned about what she\n  herself will do and how she will act.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, the text at first (when she is taken to the women's house,\n  before becoming queen) describes Mordekhai as walking about before the\n  courtyard of the women's house to know how Esther was faring and what\n  would be done with her. (Note the parallel to the story of Moshe\n  Rabbeinu as a baby, and how his sister Miriam stationed herself nearby\n  to see what would become of him. Both stories involve the captive\n  becoming part of the royalty and eventually saving the Jewish nation.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Against this backdrop, Mordekhai felt it would be wise for Esther to\n  refrain from revealing her nationality and lineage, his concern for\n  her welfare was bound up with the fact that she was a Jewess, a\n  stranger and foreigner.</p>\n  \n  <p>As stated, Mordekhai - whose nationalistic Jewish orientation requires\n  no proof - believed that it was proper for him to continue serving as\n  a guide to Esther. For this reason, he thought it better that the\n  family connection between them not become known, in order that\n  Esther's actions for the benefit of her nation could be carried out\n  and would not appear to be serving anything other than the best\n  interests of the kingdom. Although any ruler has advisors, and such\n  was Mordekhai's position in relation to Esther, an advisor appointed\n  in accordance with state considerations and who acts accordingly is\n  not the same as an advisor who acquires his status through family\n  connections. The latter will always be suspected of improper personal\n  interests - and certainly if the person of power and the advisor\n  belong to a foreign nation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are some dates off by one day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Hebrew calendar works on a 19-year cycle of leap years and a 247-year cycle of varying types of years. This is discussed more fully in Shvili d'Rakia, printed in all Mishnayos containing Tiferes Yisrael at the beginning of Moed Aleph, and you can locate a chart of this 247-year cycle in the Tur, between OC Simanim 428 and 429.</p>\n\n<p>In theory, just the 19-year cycle keeps the Hebrew and English years in balance, such that Pesach and Sukkos don't drift too early (the Hebrew calendar is usually 10-12 days shorter than the English calendar, with the exception of leap years). Comparing any given year in the 247-year cycle with its corresponding year in the next or previous 247-year cycle will show that the moladim of those years differ from those of their corresponding years by less than an hour.</p>\n\n<p>In light of all of this, one would expect that if Hebrew date X and English date Y were the same in any given year, 19 years later, or at least 247 years later, they would coincide once more. And indeed, most Jews would tell you that this is indeed the case (at least in my experience).</p>\n\n<p>However, the test fails for Hebrew leap years. In most years except for a leap year (and some non-leap years), the above statement is accurate. But in leap years, every 19 years, the Hebrew date will toggle back and forth between one of two consecutive English dates. Sometimes it will stick to one of those two days for two years at a time, but it seems to alternate for the most part.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone explain this phenomenon? You can confirm it for yourself by going to <a href=\"http://www.hebcal.com/converter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.hebcal.com/converter</a> and plugging in any Hebrew date from last year (5776 was a leap year), then keep adding 19 to the Hebrew year and seeing what the corresponding Gregorian year becomes.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I think I may have discovered the answer. After mulling over the problem for a bit, I realized that not all cycles are created equally. The 19-year cycle just determines which years are leap years; it's the 247-year cycle which determines the lengths of Cheshvan and Kislev.</p>\n\n<p>To test out my theory, I built an Excel spreadsheet, then went, column by column, down the Tur chart cited in my OP, recording just the number of days in each year. </p>\n\n<p>The Tur codifies years by three criteria:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The starting date of the year: ב for Monday, ג for Tuesday, ה for Thursday, and ז for Shabbos</li>\n<li>The lengths of Cheshvan and Kislev: ח if they're both 29, כ if one is 29 and the other 30, and ש if they're both 30</li>\n<li>Whether Adar II exists: פ for non-leap years and מ for leap years</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As I don't care about the day of the week, I only looked at the latter two criteria, and listed each year by its length (353, 354, 355, 383, 384, or 385).</p>\n\n<p>This led to the following spreadsheet:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V6y33.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V6y33.png\" alt=\"Spreadsheet of years and their respective lengths\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Yes, it was more intuitive to me as well to do it left-to-right.

The next 19 rows are the lengths of those respective years, with the orange rows being leap years (3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19).</p>\n\n<p>The final row is what this spreadsheet leads to: the total sum of days in a 19-year cycle.</p>\n\n<p>The problem that leads to the phenomenon noted in the OP is that although most cycles are 6940 days long, there are a few 6939-day cycles (and cycle 6 confuses things with 6941 days).</p>\n\n<p>Well, you may ask, if years aren't the same length, then why should it be limited to Jewish leap years? Well, there's two calendars we're dealing with here, so let's figure out how long the corresponding Gregorian years are.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Tur's chart, 5549/1788-89 was the start of the current 247-year cycle, so I decided to use that one. (Besides, if an urban legend is circulating <em>now</em>, it probably surfaced from <em>recent</em> data.) I didn't feel like doing the math myself, so I <a href=\"http://www.hebcal.com/converter/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">took the Gregorian dates for RH of year 1 and 29 Elul of year 19</a> and <a href=\"https://planetcalc.com/274/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">outsourced</a> the calculations.</p>\n\n<p>Rosh HaShanah 5549 was October 2, 1788. 29 Elul 5567, the last day of the first 19-year cycle, was, uh, October 2, 1807. That's... 6938 days. One <em>less</em> than the corresponding Hebrew cycle. So the 19th birthday of anyone born in that first cycle would have been one off.</p>\n\n<p>Going through these calculations (read: making my computer go through these calculations) for these cycles yielded the following differences between the Gregorian cycle and the Hebrew cycle:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>-1</li>\n<li>0</li>\n<li>0</li>\n<li>-1</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At this point I realized that I just needed to compare the Rosh HaShanah dates, and I didn't need to go through the second website and then compare it to my spreadsheet. But that led to another realization: this just compares the first year of each cycle with each other. It doesn't address the <em>rest</em> of the cycle.</p>\n\n<p>But it did lead to an answer to the original question. It has nothing to do with being born specifically in a leap year that results in the 19 year cycle being off by a day. It's that the Gregorian leap year cycle doesn't follow the Hebrew 19 year cycle, which means that sometimes the 19-year cycles line up, while sometimes they don't.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It doesn't matter whether you're born in a leap year. It matters whether those 19 Gregorian years are the same length as the 19 Hebrew years.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I will have to look into the math at another time if Jewish leap years just happen to be more susceptible to being out of sync with the Gregorian calendar, and that's what led to the rumor I mentioned in the OP. However, this does explain the underlying phenomenon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Without getting into all of the intricacies of either the question or answer, there is a simple reason for the shift, and it has nothing to do with leap years. It has to do with the day of the week.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, let us understand what happens at the end of the 19 year cycle. It means that the molad will fall on the same day of the solar calendar. But that doesn't mean that the date will be the same, for the following reason.</p>\n\n<p>There is a rule if Rosh Hashana falls out on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, that it is pushed off to the next day, along with most of the year (from the end of cheshvan) preceding it. This is not dependent on the 19 year calendar, and the starting year or the ending year could be pushed off, or both, or neither. This results in the discrepancies mentioned by the OP's answer.</p>\n\n<p>The 247 year cycle comes back to the same day of the week (and hour of the day, approximately), so the date on the solar calendar should always match up at the end of that cycle. (Unless, of course, the year is one of those that are affected by the small discrepancy at the end of the 247 year cycle. In astronomy, no cycle is perfect.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does R' Yishmael require the fields to alternate in Kilayim 3:6?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Kilayim 3:6 poses the case of a field sown with onions, and one wishes to plant gourds in this field. There are three opinions as to how much one should uproot, and as they pose their opinions in very cryptic wordings, I will explain their opinions according to the Rambam, Bartenura, and Tiferes Yisrael, who all seem to agree on how the Mishnah should be read.</p>\n\n<p><strong>R' Yishmael</strong> says one should make alternating patches of 8 amos filled with the onions and 8 amos left fallow, then plant the gourds in the center 4 amos of the 8-amah fallow patches. This leads to an alternating pattern of 8 amos of onions, 2 amos fallow, 4 amos of gourds, and 2 amos fallow. </p>\n\n<p><strong>R' Akiva</strong> says that you don't need 2 amos fallow between the onions and gourds; you can just plant a row of flax (a minimal width) between them. Thus, the pattern is 8 amos onions, tiny little immeasurable gap, 8 amos gourds, tiny little immeasurable gap. </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Chachamim</strong> say that R' Yishmael is correct in that there must be 12 amos between patches of gourds (in R' Yishmael's view, that was 4 amos fallow and 8 amos of onions), but they agree with R' Akiva that you don't need 2 amos between the differing species. Thus, the gourds are still four amos wide, but the onions can be expanded to 12 amos. </p>\n\n<p>My question is: Why do the fields need to alternate?</p>\n\n<p>Let's take a field of 52 amos wide. According to R' Yishmael, we begin with 4 amos of gourds, then a 2 amah gap, then 8 amos of onions, then a 2 amah gap; this pattern repeats two times, followed by one last four-amah field of gourds. This is a total of 16 amos of gourds, and 24 amos of onions. </p>\n\n<p>If he simply requires that there be two amos between the gourds and onions, let the 24 amos of onions remain constant, add a 2-amah gap, and then plant the remaining 26 amos of field with gourd. By not alternating fields, he gains 10 amos of gourds!</p>\n\n<p>(According to R' Akiva and the Chachamim, where no gaps are lost by not alternating, this suggestion would have no impact on their opinions.)</p>\n\n\n",

Among those halachos taught are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A wall must be 10 tefachim tall. </li>\n<li>A ditch must be 10 tefachim deep and 4 tefachim wide. </li>\n<li>Reeds forming a wall must be within 3 tefachim of each other. </li>\n<li>A gap of 10 amos is an entrance and does not ruin a wall; more than that is a breach and ruins the wall. </li>\n<li>There must be more wall than gaps. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These are all rules taught in other places:\n1. Sukkah 1:1\n2. Later in Kilayim, 5:3\n2. Sukkah 1:9 is explained by the Gemara there as operating under the same principle, a Halacha L'Moshe MiSinai (which means this Mishnah is still unnecessary). This principle is called Lavud. See further Sukkah 4b and 5b. \n3. Eiruvin 1:1\n4. This is a general principle in Lavud, discussed in the sources above, in #2.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the masechta itself repeats itself when it says in 4:7 that a wall less than 10 tefachim allows for two fields to combine, but taller than 10 tefachim does not. </p>\n\n<p>Now, you might say the chiddush is that these rules apply to Kilayim as well. Well, the Mishnah makes clear the issue is that it's a מחיצה - a word used to split between domains. The Kehati emphasizes this point, that the Mishnah is trying to make each field a separate domain, and the Mishnah cited in 4:7 would seem to make that point as well by talking about \"combining\" fields. </p>\n\n<p>Principle #1 would seem to also be working behind the Halacha in Kilayim 5:4, that a house in a vineyard counts as a separation. </p>\n\n<p>So, then, why are these principles taught in so many places?

    "content": "# How can a Gentile buy chametz?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Bouncing off of the interesting question about <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/83633/how-can-i-become-a-shabbos-goy\">how to become a Shabbos Goy</a>, how can a Gentile purchase chametz? There is a <em>lot</em> of information here and everywhere on how Jews can sell their chametz before pesach by contacting a rabbi who will arrange the sale of it to a Gentile, but it is unclear as to how that Gentile is selected or how a Gentile can nominate themselves as a chametz purchaser.</p>\n\n<p>How can an interested Gentile purchase chametz? It can't be as easy as calling up a local rabbi and saying, \"Oh hai, I can haz chametz? I has lots moniez and I am teh goyish. Kthxbai!\" - or is it? Are there rules that a Gentile must fulfill to qualify as a purchaser (other than being a competent adult Gentile)? Are these rules <em>halachic</em> rules or are they more related to social practices or traditions? E.g. \"At this synagogue, our <em>minhag</em> is to sell to the parish priest of St. Peter's Catholic Church. If the priest is halachically Jewish, we sell to Gentile members of the local School Board, working forwards from age of first election to the board. Anyone not on this list can pound sand, no chametz for them.\"</p>\n\n<p>As it pertains to @msh210 's observation that communities tend to pick the same Gentile every year, that's my understanding too. I strongly suspect that there is no guarantee of an \"Equal Chametz Opportunity\" (with a logo of an equals sign inside a loaf of bread), but is the process for selecting the purchaser essentially hopelessly opaque, or are there ways for an interested Gentile to \"place themselves in the path of chametz\" as one might say? For example, are chametz purchasers generally selected from existing Shabbos Goys? Are they usually local clergy of other religions that the Rabbi meets at the local Interfaith Roundtable? Is it expected that the purchaser will be the mayor or a similar local politician? If a community's current chametz purchaser dies, disappears, converts to Judaism, or refuses to purchase chametz any more, how would a Rabbi generally go about finding a new purchaser? Does he hang a \"chametz for sale\" sign in the synagogue window? Is there an underground social network/pipeline already in place to connect the rabbi with another suitable Gentile? Does he post on Craigslist (\"For sale: LEAVEN. In various homes and businesses throughout the Tri-County Area. $5,000 OBO. Money back guarantee!\")? Does he cast lots over the phone book and cold-call candidates (\"Hello sir, are you a Gentile? Do you know what chametz is? Would you like to help us out by buying some for Passover this year?\")? Is it a best practice (or even a <em>minhag</em>) for him to recruit on a college campus, where presumably he is more likely to encounter someone who understands complex business transactions ( @msh210 mentioned the importance of finding someone like that)?</p>\n\n<p>As to <em>why</em> a Gentile would want to do this, I imagine it would be similar to why one might want to become a Shabbos Goy - to build relationships, help others, and have meaningful or interesting adventures.</p>\n\n\n",

The same should apply to the word Shevet.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מלבי\"ם פרשת שמות</p>\n<p>והמטה היה עשוי לכבוד, והיה בו ציון המעלה והמשרה וכבוד המשפחה כמו מטה לוי, מטה בית אבותם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Shelomo Wolbe, in his book on parenting, Zeri'ah uVinyan beChinukh (Title of English translation: Planting & Building in Education: Raising a Jewish Child), discusses the verse (Mishlei 13:24):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חוֹשֵׂ֣ךְ שִׁ֭בְטוֹ שׂוֹנֵ֣א בְנ֑וֹ וְ֝אֹהֲב֗וֹ שִֽׁחֲר֥וֹ מוּסָֽר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who spares his <em>sheivet</em> hates his son; but the one who loves him, disciplines him early.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The source of the English idiom, \"Spare the rod, spoil the child.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Wolbe's thesis in this book is that children are to be planted and/or built. All too often we try raising them by \"pruning\" unwanted aspects from the child. We should instead look to build up the positives.</p>\n<p>His explanation of this verse is that \"<em>sheivet</em>\" doesn't mean the kind of stick one would punish that child with. Rather, it's the staff of a leader. Like in Yaaqov's blessing of Yehudah. He phrases the fact that David's royal line will come from Yehudah with the words, \"לֹֽא־יָס֥וּר שֵׁ֨בֶט֙ מִֽיהוּדָ֔ה -- the <em>sheivet</em> will never leave Yehudah...\" (Bereishis 49:10) Note the phonetic relationship to <em>sharvit</em> - scepter. (E.g. Esther 4:11)</p>\n<p>Similarly, I would note that a \"<em>mateh</em>\" is a shepherd's crook. (Yehudah has one, Bereishis 38:18; and it's the term for Moshe's staff -- Shemos 4:20, etc...)</p>\n<p>The rod the translation presumes Mishlei is talking about would have been a \"<em>maqeil</em>\".</p>\n<p>So it makes sense that a unit of the leadership hierarchy of the Benei Yisrael would be a \"<em>sheivet</em>\" or a \"<em>mateh</em>\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/7444\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> essay, I offered three approaches to this question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Citing an explanation from Rabbi Shmuel Dovid Luzzatto (1800-1865),\n  Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg (1785-1865) writes that the words shevet\n  and mateh actually have different meanings, but because they are\n  conceptually related they became interchangeable. He explains that the\n  word shevet originally referred to the leader of a tribe, while mateh\n  originally referred to the other members of a tribe. The leader of a\n  tribe is similar to a mast upon which a flag is mounted because all of\n  the members of the tribe rally around the leader. In this way the word\n  for a leader of a tribe is homonymous with the word for stick. Since\n  all the members of a tribe are united behind their leader, references\n  to them can be subsumed under the word used for the leader. Thus, the\n  word shevet also came to mean members of a tribe because the leader of\n  the tribe embodies the entire tribe itself. In terms of sticks, he\n  argues that shevet and mateh can both refer to the exact same type of\n  stick, but they refer to different parts of the stick. The word shevet\n  refers to the top of the stick (just as the leader sits atop the\n  hierarchal structure of a tribe), while the word mateh — seemingly\n  related to the Hebrew word lematah (underneath) — refers to its bottom\n  (just as the other members of the tribe live under the leadership of\n  their clan chief).</p>\n  \n  <p>Malbim (to Gen. 49:28) writes that the word shevet does not literally\n  mean “stick”, rather it means “branch,” which was the most common item\n  used as a stick. Based on this, he explains that shevet means branch\n  and tribe because each of the Tribes of Israel is simply a branch of\n  the greater family tree of Jacob’s descendants.</p>\n  \n  <p>Using the synonyms in question as a springboard for discussion, Rabbi\n  Zev HaKohen Hoberman (1930-2012) sums up the dual role assumed by the\n  Tribes of Israel. On the one hand, they are called shevatim because\n  G-d has granted them certain forms of authority and responsibility\n  over the nations of the world. Yet, paradoxically, they are also\n  called matot (which he equates with the words mishenet and chutra)\n  because they serve as Jacob’s “cane” in death, upon whom he “leans” to\n  carry on his legacy. In that way they are not autonomous, but simply\n  follow the tradition of their illustrious forefather.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/this_week/whats_in_a_word/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's in a Word?</a>, \"Tribesmen Stick Together\"</p>\n\n\n",

I checked the Frankel Rambam and they wrote in a footnote that the <strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong> left out this <em>mitzvah</em>!</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Chinuch</strong> writes at the beginning that he based his sefer off the <strong>Rambam</strong>. He'll point out when the <strong>Ramban</strong> disagrees and sometimes will side with the <strong>Ramban</strong>, but will still write the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s <em>mitzvah</em>. This is the only exception that I'm aware of.</p>\n\n<p>Do any of the commentators explain why he left it out? Even the <strong>Ramban</strong> seems to agree with counting it, since he didn't write any objections. As well, which <em>mitzvah</em> did the <strong>Chinuch</strong> replace it with? The Frankel Rambam in the footnote I mentioned writes that in <code>דרך מצותיך ח\"ד סי' תפז</code> it's written which mitzvah replaces it.

The question is, why did the <strong>Chinuch</strong> include it, especially since he was so loyal to the <strong>Rambam</strong>? This in addition to the fact that the <strong>Chinuch</strong> doesn't even acknowledge his deviation from the <strong>Rambam</strong> (and <strong>Ramban</strong>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%A8\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Chaim Heller</strong></a>, in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38151&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">introduction</a> to his version of <strong>Sefer HaMitzvos</strong>, explains that soon after <strong>Sefer HaMitzvos</strong> was published and subsequently translated, mistakes began to appear. He cites the Responsum of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rabbeinu Avraham ben HaRambam</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=158148&pagenum=4\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Maaseh Nissim</strong> § 2</a>) to <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/daniel-ben-saadiah-ha-bavli\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Daniel HaBavli</strong></a> who asked why the <strong>Rambam</strong> counted the prohibition of bringing the Pesach offering on a private altar when the <em>mitzvah</em> wasn't for all time. <strong>Rabbeinu Avraham</strong> responded that there is no such <em>mitzvah</em> in the <em>sefer</em> of the <strong>Rambam</strong> and it's entirely a mistake. <strong>Rav Heller</strong> assumes that <strong>Rav Daniel HaBavli</strong> had a version of <strong>Sefer HaMitzvos</strong> with this mistake in it, and suggests that perhaps this mistake was also in the version the <strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong> had. This would explain why the <strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong> deviated from the <strong>Rambam</strong> that we have (although this is not a definitive explanation, it's the best I found).</p>\n<p>(Credit to the Frankel edition of the <strong>Rambam</strong> for providing a lot of the sources.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I subsequently found the <strong>ArtScroll</strong> version of <strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong> points to a different approach to this discrepancy, found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20823&st=&pgnum=232&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Mayan HaChochmah</strong></a> by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%99_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Noach Chaim Tzvi Berlin</strong></a>, which is as follows:</p>\n<p>The <strong>Chinuch</strong> noticed the <strong>Rambam</strong> left out all the laws of private altars, yet codifies the law prohibiting the Pesach offering on a private altar. This must mean that private altars are no longer relevant today as it is anyways forbidden to bring an offering outside the Temple. Since the <strong>Rambam</strong> specifically codified the law pertaining to the Pesach offering, that law must be relevant even today.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Chinuch</strong> must also hold like <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Zevachim.59a.37.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Tosafos</strong></a> in <strong>Zevachim</strong> 59a, who say everyone agrees that someone today who slaughters an offering outside the Temple is exempt from <em>kares</em>. Therefore, the prohibition pertaining to the Pesach offering would be a novelty, punished by <em>kares</em>, making it fitting to count in the 613 <em>mitzvos</em>. However, the <strong>Rambam</strong> disagrees with <strong>Tosafos</strong> and holds slaughtering an offering today outside the Temple does get punished with <em>kares</em>. That means there's nothing unique about the Pesach offering. It's just an extra prohibition, which isn't worth counting in the 613.</p>\n<p>All this explains why the <strong>Chinuch</strong> added this mitzvah, but not why he discounted a <em>zar</em> eating <em>kodshim</em>. The <strong>Mayan HaChochmah</strong> (I can't find where) says that the <strong>Chinuch</strong> held that that verse (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.29.33\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Exodus</strong> 29:33</a>) is referring to the <em>miluim</em>, the inaugural korbonos ceremony. Therefore, that prohibition was only for that time, and isn't to be counted in 613 (<strong>ArtScroll</strong> cites <strong>Maharam Schik</strong> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37469&st=&pgnum=85&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">#103</a> who also says this).</p>\n<p>However, <strong>ArtScroll</strong> points out this is hard to understand, as the first half of that verse <strong>is</strong> counted by the <strong>Chinuch</strong> as a <em>mitzvah</em>, meaning not exclusively about the <em>miluim</em>. Why wouldn't this part of the verse be treated the same. They subsequently point to <strong>Maharam Schik</strong> #103 for a possible resolution, although I don't get how he resolves it (he says it's just a ייתור דקרא so not worth counting).</p>\n<p>All of this fails to explain why the <strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong> in both locations doesn't notify us that he's deviating from the <strong>Rambam</strong>.</p>\n<p>Of course, the first explanation seems a lot simpler and is thus <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">more likely</a> to be correct.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Specific Breslov Nusach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that traditionally Breslov has not taken Nusach HaTefillah as seriously as other Chassidic groups when it comes to identifying the Sha'ar HaKollel. Although most Breslovers daven Nusach Sefard, through the teachings of Rebbe Nachman the concept of Sha'ar HaKollel has been interpreted as attachment to the Tzaddik, instead of an actual nusach. </p>\n\n<p>(There is an undocumented oral tradition about Rebbe Nachman saying that if he had grown up davening Nusach Ashkenaz he would have continued in that nusach. In other words, he would not have switched over to Nusach Sefard.) </p>\n\n<p>But like any Chassidic group, there are certain additions/omissions to the \"standard\" Nusach Sefard siddurim on the market these days that distinguish a Chassidic dynasty from others. For instance, Lubavitch has its own version of Nusach Sefard which was compiled by the Ba'al HaTanya in attempt to form a \"true\" Nusach Ari (if such a thing is possible).  My question is: are there any details that distinguish the nusach of Breslov from a standard Nusach Sefard? </p>\n\n<p>As an example for what I mean, is \"asher nasan lasechvi\" said or is \"hanosein lasechvi\" said? Is \"tze'etza'einu v'tze'etza'ei\" added in the Birkos HaTorah? Do Breslovers say \"mashiv haruach umorid hatal\" or just \"morid hatal\"? I'm sure you get what I mean by now. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I would be interested in knowing the ins-and-outs of Breslov nusach. In addition, does anyone know any online resources that have recordings of Breslover nusach, as in niggunim used by the chazzan in shul for the tefillos? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The only specific detail in nusach that I can think of for which the Rebbe made a particular point, was to say \"melech yachid chei ha'olamim\" in Yishtabach in order to mirror the text of \"Baruch Sheamar.\"   I suppose there are some other points in davening with a very strong attribution to the Baal Shem Tov (in whose house the Rebbe grew up) for which many Breslovers are particular, like \"hazan b’rachamav es hakol\" in bentching.</p>\n\n<p>As you indicated, there has always been a lack of emphasis on minhagim in Breslov, particularly in regards to nusach hatefillah.  Also, Breslov had long been regionalized with the Polish and the Russian/Ukrainian chassidim adhering to their local minhagim.  Furthermore, matters are \"confused\" by the fact that there were two or three different mesorahs that developed from Reb Noson’s talmidim. </p>\n\n<p>A great number of the Breslov manhigim of the last 100 years were first generation Breslovers, in many cases literally finding a Tikkun Haklali or a Likutei Moharan in some corner of their yeshiva and feeling compelled to seek out a teacher in the Rebbe's derech.  Many felt no need to change their customs, while some took on their teachers'.</p>\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, the Sternhartz/Kenig line has long been particular about recording their minhagim.   R’ Dovid Sears and R’ Dovid Zeitlin have done some excellent work in compiling these, with multiple articles in English available at <a href=\"http://breslovcenter.blogspot.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://breslovcenter.blogspot.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here is one on R’ Gedaliah Kenig’s personal nusach:  <a href=\"http://breslovcenter.blogspot.com/2012/05/reb-gedaliahs-nusach-for-shemoneh-esreh.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://breslovcenter.blogspot.com/2012/05/reb-gedaliahs-nusach-for-shemoneh-esreh.html</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Mohorosh z\"l (the Tzadik of yavnial) printed a siddur called \"Sidur eis rotzon\", and in a letter in his popular sefer (response) \"Asher banachal\" he states that this is exactly the nusach that Reb Nachmen of breslev used.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the last line of the first bracha in Birkas Hamazon, the minhag of Rebbe Nachman was to recite \"hazan b'rachamav es hakol\", including the word \"b'rachamav\" to the usual nusach.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Meaning of the Word \"Lechem\"",
    "content": "# Meaning of the Word \"Lechem\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One might think that the word “lechem” was a fairly general term. It seems to refer sometimes to animals' feed (Psalms 147:09), mannah (Ex 16:22), or sacrificial meat (Lev 03:16, Num 28:02). Rashi sometimes says that it means “food” in general: Gen 31:54, Gen 49:20, Lev 03:11, Lev 21:17, Lev 21:21, etc., sometimes citing Jeremiah 11:19, Daniel 05:01, or Ecclesiastes 10:19. See also Ramban at Ex 16:04.</p>\n\n<p>And yet at <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213/jewish/Chapter-18.htm#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 18:05</a>, Avraham offers to bring “pas lechem” to the angels. What do these words mean? By now, one might think that they mean “some food.” But here Rashi seems to think that they refer to bread; if they mean “food,” then what is the meaning of Rashi’s comment – that FOOD sustains life? Does he mean that “lechem” alone is food, while the expression “pas lechem” together refers to bread? If so, then how can Rashi cite the passage from Psalms, which does not say “pas lechem” but just “lechem”?</p>\n\n<p>Does the association of this story with the moral “Say little but do much” suggest some understanding of the words “pas lechem”? I always thought that the inference was that Avraham said little (I will bring bread) but did much (brought other foods too); is it rather that Avraham said \"I will bring just a little food” but instead brought a feast?</p>\n\n<p>And lastly, the whole conversation seems to be about the assumption that “lechem” means bread. If that’s wrong, then where did the impression arise? Are there places later in Tanach where it does clearly mean bread? Or that just a sense the word took on in later Hebrew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Partial answer for now:</p>\n\n<p>It seems that in Tanac\"h the word לחם is used to mean \"food\", \"bread\" or even \"meat / flesh\". It depends on the context.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.balashon.com/2006/03/lechem.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Balashon - The Hebrew Language Detective</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Well, first of all, it's not clear that it originally meant only\n  bread. In Arabic lahm means meat, and as Ruth Almagor-Ramon points out\n  <a href=\"http://msradio.huji.ac.il/wwwroot/INST/rega.doc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>: lechem meant\n  \"the main food\". When flour was the basis of the main food, then\n  lechem meant bread; for those who relied mainly on meat, then the same\n  root took on that meaning.</p>\n  \n  <p>Stahl explains the term similarly. He points out that Hebrew also\n  preserves some of the non-bread meaning of lechem, as in the verse\n  from Tzefania 1:17: וְשֻׁפַּךְ דָּמָם כֶּעָפָר, וּלְחֻמָם כַּגְּלָלִים\n  - \"their blood will be poured out like dust, and their flesh like dung\". Here l'chum refers to flesh, to meat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(It helps when I recall my own answers...)</p>\n\n<p>I am excerpting part of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/70431/5275\">my answer</a> to what the term פת means, as part of it addresses that verse from Gen. 18:05. (Good choice, BTW, as I believe that is that word's 1st appearance in Tana\"ch.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The word פת means \"piece\". (As I don't believe in coincidence, I think\n  the English word \"piece\" may have come from the Hebrew, in some way!)</p>\n  \n  <p>See Radak on Genesis 18:5:1 (Sefaria English translation) - Hebrew &\n  English excerpted by me:</p>\n  \n  <p>ואקחה פת לחם, כי הנה אברהם אמר פת לחם שפירושו חתיכת לחם ולא אמר לחם\n  כמו שאמר מעט מים כמו שפירשנו. ואקחה פת לחם</p>\n  \n  <p>Avraham spoke about a piece of bread, whereas in fact he served a\n  sumptuous meal. He had even understated the amount of bread he would\n  serve by not saying ואקח לחם, but ואקחה פת לחם, a reference to less\n  than a whole loaf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, when you see the term פת לחם it means, unambiguously, \"a piece of <strong>bread</strong>\". Even the word פת alone refers to a piece of bread. (You see this by itself frequently in Mishna and other halachic works.)</p>\n\n<p>(FWIW, I have little doubt that the modern word \"pita\" comes from פת . It is unambiguously a type of bread.)</p>\n\n\n",

[ב] מאחר שנתפרסם שהוא כופר בתורה שבעל פה--מורידין ולא מעלין, כשאר המינים והאפיקורוסין והאומרין אין תורה מן השמיים והמוסרים והמשומדים:  כל אלו אינן בכלל ישראל, ואינן צריכין לא עדים ולא התראה ולא דיינין; אלא כל ההורג אחד מהן, עשה מצוה גדולה והסיר מכשול.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How should this be understood? If a person (who isn't just ignorant) does not believe in the Torah, is it halachically permitted for anyone to kill them? (Excluding the fact that practically it would be legally forbidden by civil law.) Is it not the case that without a Sanhedrin and warnings, capital punishment is not halachically allowed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam is talking specifically about a person that violates the Torah to spite his creator (להכעיס), such a person, according to the rambam's understanding, is looking to undermine the Jewish nation and it is a Mitzvah to cause them death either directly or indirectly (rambam rotzeach 4:10),</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל מוסרי ישראל\n  והמינים והאפיקורסין מישראל מצוה לאבדן ביד ולהורידן עד באר שחת מפני שהן<br>\n  מצירין לישראל ומסירין את העם מאחרי ה' כישוע הנוצרי ותלמידיו וצדוק\n  וביתוס ותלמידיהם שם רשעים ירקב<br>\n  רמב\"ם יד החזקה - הלכות עבודת כוכבים\n  פרק י</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam adds that because they cause trouble to the Jewish people there a mitzvah to get rid of them. This might also be the answer to your second question, since they are looking to undermine the Jewish nation we view them as רודפים in which killing them is permitted even without a sanhedrin (since each one of us is viewed as a נרדף). Hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To answer both questions, the Rambam is written very clearly and precisely. When the Rambam wrote that מורידין ולא מעלין that means that it is a mitzva to kill him, or to prevent his recovery if he is in a position of danger.</p>\n\n<p>of course, unfortunately, we are in golus, and we practically cannot perform this mitzva, as we are not obligated to face capital punishment or even imprisonment or other dangers that come of such activity, in order to perform this mitzva.</p>\n\n<p>As to your question about all capital punishment requiring hasra'a, that is actually not a hard fast rule. But as to our case, the Rambam writes that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל אלו אינן בכלל ישראל, ואינן צריכין לא עדים ולא התראה ולא דיינין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>this means that since idol worshipers and the like are given non-jew status, they do not require hasra'a et al. (non-jews do not require hasra'a for violation of any of the seven Noahide laws.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You have to read the next two halachot where he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במה דברים אמורים באיש שכפר בתורה שבעל פה במחשבתו ובדברים שנראו לו והלך\n  אחר דעתו הקלה ואחר שרירות לבו וכופר בתורה שבעל פה תחילה כצדוק ובייתוס\n  וכן כל התועים אחריו אבל בני התועים האלה ובני בניהם שהדיחו אותם אבותם\n  ונולדו בין הקראים וגדלו אותם על דעתם הרי הוא כתינוק שנשבה ביניהם\n  וגדלוהו ואינו זריז לאחוז בדרכי המצות שהרי הוא כאנוס ואע\"פ ששמע אח\"כ\n  [שהוא יהודי וראה היהודים ודתם הרי הוא כאנוס שהרי גדלוהו על טעותם] כך\n  אלו שאמרנו האוחזים בדרכי אבותם הקראים שטעו לפיכך ראוי להחזירן בתשובה\n  ולמשכם בדברי שלום עד שיחזרו לאיתן התורה</p>\n  \n  <p>To whom does the above apply? To a person who denied the Oral Law\n  consciously, according to his perception of things. He follows after\n  his frivolous thoughts and his capricious heart and denies the Oral\n  Law first, as did Tzadok and Beitus and those who erred in following\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>The children of these errant people and their grandchildren whose\n  parents led them away and they were born among these Karaities and\n  raised according to their conception, they are considered as a\n  children captured and raised by them.

This\n  applies to those who we mentioned who follow the erroneous Karaite\n  path of their ancestors. Therefore it is appropriate to motivate them\n  to repent and draw them to the power of the Torah with words of peace.\n  (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1181854/jewish/Mamrim-Chapter-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This continuation greatly reduces the applicability of the part that you cited.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Germanic populations in Talmudic and other rabbinic texts?",
    "content": "# Germanic populations in Talmudic and other rabbinic texts?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the 11th century, Hai Gaon and Rashi refer to the country and language of “Ashkenaz” (referring to the area around the Rhineland, northern France and Germany). By the 12th and 13th centuries, equating Ashkenaz (and to a lesser extent Gomer) with the Germans/Germany becomes commonplace (eg, by Radak, Raaven, Rashba, Rosh, Tur, Rivash, the Machzor Vitry, etc), and it has remained the dominant term since. I’m interested in references prior to this time period.</p>\n<p>What do the Talmudim and other rabbinic writings say about Germans and/or Germany? In antiquity, Germanic populations were known by a variety of names (Goths, Vandals, Germans, Teutons, Getae, Franks, Varangians, barbarians, Cimbri? etc) and migrated through many locations throughout the Roman Empire and the European continent.</p>\n<p>There are a few rabbinic references that seem pretty indisputably to refer to Germans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The bodyguard of Roman soldiers provided to Rabbi by Antoninus (Emperor Marcus Aurelius) (b. Avodah Zarah 10a-b). During a debate on the ability of a beit din to bring the Nasi to judgement and punishment, R. Resh Lakish offered an opinion which “Rabbi heard about and was angered, and sent Goths to seize Resh Lakish, who fled” (y. Sanhedrin 19d). The most natural interpretation is that the soldiers were German recruits to the Roman army who operated as the Nasi’s equivalent of the Varangian Guard. This may be related to the stories of Rabbi’s slave: in y. Shabbat 6:9/8c, Rabbi had a courageous slave named “Germania” (possibly from the Latin name Germanicus?) who saved R. Ila from a rabid dog attack. In the parallel passage in y. Yoma 8:5/45b, the slave is called “Germani”, and he is bitten by a rabid dog and Rabbi is unable to heal him.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The word Germani also appears in m. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Negaim.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Negaim 2:1</a>, which asserts that the laws of negaim apply to people from “Germani” (גרמני) and Cush, as was pointed out <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70210/german-and-ethiopian-jews-in-the-time-of-the-mishna\">in this question</a>. It is highly likely that the text is following the common merism in the Greco-Roman and rabbinic worlds pairing Germans/Scythians with Ethiopians/Barbarians to describe the northern and southern extremes of the world, as described in <a href=\"https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dmg2/files/2016/10/scythian-barbarian_as_published-17jr2m5.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">“Scythian-Barbarian: The Permutations of a Classical Topos in Jewish and Christian Texts of Late Antiquity” by David Goldenberg</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In Midrash Tehillim 25:19 it distinguishes the Goths from Edom: “If Esav hated Yacov he had good reason – for Yacov had taken the birthright from him. But as for the barbarian, the Gontim [generally considered to mean “Goths”] and the other nations, what have I even done to them that they should ‘bear a tyrannous hate against me’?” Gontim also appears in a quote of this passage in Yalkut Shimoni 702.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Another example that seems clear is from the midrash which describes that “the Holy One, blessed by He, made a (horse-)bit for Esav,” which R. Hama b. Hanina explained as, “The barbarians and the Germans of whom Edomites are afraid” (Bereshit Rabbah 75:9). The natural reading is that the Edomites are the Romans and their ‘bit’ to restrain them are the various Germanic tribes that were fighting them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, much less clear are the references to a place/people called “Germamia” (גרממיא).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>B. Megilla 6b says, “R. Yitzaq says again: What is meant by the verse, ‘Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked man, do not further his plot, lest they exalt themselves, selah [Tehillim 140:9]? Yacov said before the Holy One, blessed be He: ‘Master of the Universe, grant not to Esav the wicked the desire of his heart, do not further his plot.’ This refers to Germamia of Edom, for should they but go forth they would destroy the whole world … R. Hama b. Hanina says: There are 300 crowned heads in Germamia of Edom and 365 chiefs in Rome; and every day one set go forth to meet the other and one of them is killed and they have all the trouble of appointing a king again.” Rashi interprets “Germamia of Edom” as the name of a kingdom that descends from Edom (although the Talmudic context seems to indicate that Germamia and Edom are enemies and not related to each other; cf. Bereshit Rabbah 75:9 and Midrash Tehillim 25:19 above). The Yaavetz in his commentary on Rashi suggested that “Germamia” refers to Germania.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In b. Yoma 10a, y. Megilla 71b and Bereshit Rabbah 37:1-8, the sons of Yefet are linked to contemporary lands/peoples, with Gomer, Ashkenaz, Riphath and/or Torgamah explained as “Germamia”. R. Berekiah says “Germanicia”. In massechet Yoma, the Vilna Gaon corrected “Germamia” to “Germania” (and in MS Munich 6  the text says “Gothia”).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Though Germani, Germamia and Germanicia sound very similar to Germany/Germans, it is not clear on its face that they are actually referring to the same thing. Some argue that Germamia refers to the province of “Kerman” in southern Persia, and Germanicia refers to the city of Germanicia Caesarea (modern Kahramanmaraş in Turkey), and so are not related to Germanic peoples at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Yerushalmi also mentions a place called “Gothia” which it associates with Magog (Bereshit 10; Yezeqiel 38-39), which does sound like a Latin word for “Goth-land” (y. Megilla 1:9, 1:11, 3:9, 71b). Though the parallel passage in the Bavli says Magog is “Kandia” (some suggest this is Crete) (Yoma 10a). (It may be relevant that the Church Father Ambrose of Milan [c. 390 CE] identified Gog and Magog with the Goths at around the same time period.) Gothia also appears in Targum Divrei haYamim 1:5 (135), which lists the children of Yefet.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>References to Ashkenaz in the Seder of Amram Gaon, Hasdai’s letter to the Khazars, and Saadia Gaon's commentaries are ambiguous, and the dating and authoriship of those portions of the texts are disputed. The Sefer Yosippon (21) in the 10th century seems to be the earliest extant text that explicitly links Ashkenaz with Germanic lands/tribes: describing the Roman general Vespasian’s campaigns, it states “he came to the land of the West and Ashkenaz and Britannia and Saxonia and Iskotia”. The Seder Malkei Romi speaks of when the “Ashkenazim began to rule over the Romans”, apparently referring to the Gothic invasions of the Western Roman Empire, though the date of composition is unknown. And there are the works of Hai Gaon and Rashi which I’ve described above.</p>\n<p>Have I missed any references? Are there any texts in the Tanakh or commentaries that are relevant?</p>\n<p>So my questions boil down to: what are the meanings of Germamia/Germania/Gothia in the rabbinic texts (and Gomer and Ashkenaz in the pre-10th century texts)? Do they refer to what we would now consider to be Germanic tribes or lands? Have any prominent authorities or scholars examined this issue and come to any conclusions?

However, I do not think it was a normal event as a <em>formal</em> adoption. In talmudic times, one or the other would stay with the in-laws during the year between <em>kiddushin</em> and <em>nisuin</em>, but again it was not a formal adoption. In the Torah, if somone \"purchases a Hebrew maidservant <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882#v=7&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishpatim 21:7-11</a> as a minor, she must marry either the <em>master</em> or his son when she comes of age or go completely free.</p>\n\n<p>The situation that you mention does not seem to be considered as a <em>formal</em> matter.

This is used as an allegory for the relationship of Hashem and Yisrael as the either <em>brother and sister</em> or <em>husband and new bride</em>. The use of the two gives context to the closeness and naturalness of the relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Note that since this is allegory it is not a formal legal relationship. However, people are to regard their in-laws with the respect due to parents.There are cases in which the husband of a daughter who has no brothers agrees to <strong>use</strong> the family name of her father so it would not be lost. However she inherits from her father by Torah law (Bnos Tzelafchad as an example).</p>\n\n\n",

The framework must necessarily include axioms from which we develop definitions, lemmas, theorems, and corollaries. Indeed, the Method of Gematria can be precisely defined as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Let V_1 and V_2 be two verses in the Bible. Let N_1 be the total gematria of a set of words in V_1. Let N_2 be the total gematria of a set of words in V_2. It is possible that V_1 and V_2 are contextually or thematically linked if and only if N_1=N_2.</p>\n\n<p>This definition refers to words or expressions in the verses that are contextual or thematic. By Collins English Dictionary, the context of a word, sentence, or text consists of the words, sentences, or text before and after it which help to make its meaning clear. So once the Method of the Gematria establishes the association (N_1=N_2) between the two verses, V_1 and V_2, then several verses before and after them may need to be consulted for a better understanding of the association. Also, by the same dictionary, in linguistics, the adjective thematic denotes a word that is the theme of a sentence. In grammar, it is of or relating to the stem or root of a word. Very often, there is a need to consult Strong’s Concordance and the Hebrew and Greek lexicons to fully understand the association between words that are thematic in the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>I am happy to expound further.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Easy: </p>\n\n<p>None of them are meaningful.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't a question of faith, but a question of mathematics.

My answer is marei mekomos and a <em>highly</em> simplified summary of the reasons behind each spelling. Several of the sources were cited in Dayan Raskin's <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/30450\" rel=\"noreferrer\">notes on the Chabad siddur</a>, an extremely helpful book in analyzing the Chabad nusach. </p>\n\n<p>As Noach MiFrankfurt <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/84204/adon-olam-yetzir-or-yetzur#comment262936_84204\">commented</a>, \"The Ba'al haTanya was from Lita, so he wouldn't have pronounced a shuruk/kubutz as a chirik,\" so the \"correction\" point is moot.</p>\n\n<p>The difference in spellings arises from a disagreement in grammar between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Hanau\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Hanau</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Emden\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Ya'akov Emdin</a>.</p>\n\n<p>R' Hanau composed a work on grammar entitled Sharei Tefillah, and in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19676&st=&pgnum=17\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Os Zayin</em></a> argues for the spelling יצור. He argues (and again this is simplified) that if the word was spelled יציר, it should still have its \"ה\", just like עמידה ,שמירה, הליכה, בריאה, יצירה, among others. He also brings proof from other places in Tefillah, such as ויבין כל <strong>יצור</strong> כי אתה יצרתו and ופוקד כל <strong>יצורי</strong> קדם and כל <strong>היצור</strong> לא נכחד ממך from Rosh Hashanah Tefilla, as well as **יפארו ויברכו לאל כל **יצוריו from Shabbos Tefilla. He also cites <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t2717.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Iyov 17:7</a> as proof (see Rashi on the possuk as well):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַתֵּכַהּ מִכַּעַשׂ עֵינִי; <strong>וִיצֻרַי</strong> כַּצֵּל כֻּלָּם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R' Hanau also has an intrinsic grammatical reason for his spelling, though I do not understand it, and interestingly, he argues with Ibn Ezra (Sefer Tzachos end of Sha'ar Hashemos) on a separate but related point. </p>\n\n<p>The 5502 version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Horowitz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">סידור השל\"ה</a> has יצור though the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22373&st=&pgnum=68\" rel=\"noreferrer\">earlier 5477</a> version has יציר. \nIn virtually all the early and modern editions of the Chabad Siddur, יצור is the spelling. The Ba'al Hatanya v'Hashulchan Aruch's followed R' Hanau's opinion in many cases (though in many he differed, most notably the case of tzeirei in Yisgadal v'yiskadash, and the word \"yisromom\") and therefore may have agreed with R' Hanau's rendering of the word. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16002&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sha'ar Hakollel</a> by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%95%D7%98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avraham David Lavut</a>, which explains the reasoning behind the Chabad nusach, does indeed associate the spelling with R' Hanau's reasoning. (Though in the Siddur published by the Mittler Rebbe's son and son-in-law, within which the cover page records that the compilation of this siddur was done \"with great care and with correct grammar,\" the version is indeed <strong>יציר</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Emden wrote \"Luach Eres\" as a rebuttal against R' Hanau, and wrote very strong remarks against R' Hanau, and even accused R' Hanau of forging a haskamah of  R.

He brings the example of the birchos eyrusin **כשמחך **יצירך, and the oft-used ma'mar Chazal יציר* כפיו של הקב\"ה*. He also defends the Ibn Ezra against R' Hanau's attack.

The analogy process continued in Rabbinic Hebrew where the form אָנוּ appears regularly (the <em>ketiv</em> of Jeremiah 42:6 is אנו, but <em>qere</em> is אֲנַחְנוּ, which was probably the original form). Noteworthy is the fact that all the instances of the term נַחְנוּ are in relatively early books.</p>\n<p>Consequently, נַחְנוּ is probably an archaism that was preserved in several places in Tanakh.</p>\n<p>See Blau's <em>Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew</em>, pg. 165-166.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To answer one of your questions: The Meam Loez says (Matos, 32:32) that the absence of the alef implies that someone or something is not included in the \"we\". Therefore, not everyone would take part in the battle (such as men unable to fight and the ones who were guarding their families). Perhaps this concept can be extended to other sources, such as bereshis 42:11, as Yosef and Binyamin were not included in the \"we\" and so on.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=548\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishit 42:11</a>. In this verse, you will see both forms with and without the <em>Aleph</em> used.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra says that the format without the <em>aleph</em> (נחנו) is an indication of \"truth\".</p>\n\n<p>I think what he means is that in the verse in Breishit, the brothers are indicating that what they are telling (or have) told Yosef is the full truth and it can be easily verified by their actions. (In their case by the fact that they all came down as brothers at one time - why would they risk all of them being discovered as spies.)</p>\n\n<p>I would think that applying that principle to the verse you cited, Gad and Re'uven are telling Moshe that what they are saying is the truth, and it can also be verified by the fact that they have offered to stay with the other tribes until after they inherited the land - beyond the request that Moshe suggested (Moshe suggested that they only need to stay until they defeated their enemies.) Thus, they were saying the truth that they would not remain in their land on the east of the Jordan and abandon their brethren. </p>\n\n<p>Compare <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=434\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra's</a> commentary in the verse that you cited. It's a similar idea. Here, he says that it means \"This is the main thing\". You can combine this explanation with Ibn Ezra's previous one, as they point to similar ideas. I.e., they say to Moshe, \"We are addressing your main concern, that we will not stay in our land, but we will send troops to help fight with our brothers. That was your main concern.\"</p>\n\n<p>See also Ramban's take on this that they were telling Moshe \"You don't need to command us twice.\" (Read previous verses. He already told them to help their brothers, when they first approached him. Then, he repeats the same request even after they had already told Moshe that they would send troops.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why can't we have challah in the oven with other food?",
    "content": "# Why can't we have challah in the oven with other food?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am talking about halachic challah -- the portion taken for the offering. I was taught several times that these days, what to do with it is to burn it to a char in the oven. I also learned that this should be done separately from other foods (source: Halacha section of the Bais Yaakov Cookbook). This is actually a big challenge erev Shabbos, when one is short on time and has a lot of food to cook.</p>\n\n<p>1) Is it true that mitzvah challah must be put in the oven alone?</p>\n\n<p>2) If so, why?</p>\n\n<p>I had thought that the reason for this was that the challah is treyf, but on second thought, that wouldn't make much sense (since we cover it completely anyway; plus, if there were in fact a problem of trefus, cooking it without other foods in the oven wouldn't help much for the kashrus of the kitchen--although there may be some nuance in that matter, possibly related to steam). But a rabbi at my seminary mentioned that it actually may be because we can't derive benefit from the challah, and if we kept it in the oven with other foods, it could be fuel for their cooking. </p>\n\n<p>I understand how that could be true if challah were put in a fire with other foods being cooked above. But how could it possibly be true in an oven? If it couldn't, and that's not true, then what is the explanation for why the challah must be in the oven alone? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/halachos-of-hafrashas-challah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OUKosher.org</a> website if the Challa is completely wrapped up one may bake other items in the same oven. This is based on Shach (Yoreh Deah 108:1) who quotes from the Issur V’heter that one may bake bread in the oven while the challah (even uncovered) is burning. However, the Aruch Ha’shulchan (108:9) and others disagree and feel that the oven should not be used at all if the challah is uncovered.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>May I use my oven while the Challah is burning? If the challah is\n  completely wrapped up, one may bake other items in the oven while the\n  challah is burning. However, if the challah is uncovered, it is best\n  to avoid baking anything else in the oven while the challah is\n  burning. If one accidentally did use the oven while the challah was\n  burning, one may eat the food.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>Challah</em> is one of the <em>matnas kehuna</em> - gifts given to the <em>Kohanim</em> in recognition of their holy, dedicated service; while this is a <em>mitzvah d'oraysa</em> within the borders of Eretz Yisrael (considered to be a <em>mitzvah talui ba'aretz</em>) there is a rabbinic extension to <em>chutz l'aretz</em> as well. Additionally, <em>kohanim</em> as well as foodstuffs are assumed to be <em>tamei</em> nowadays which is why we burn the <em>challah</em> entirely rather than giving it to the Kohen (Rambam Hilchos Yom Tov 3:8). </p>\n\n<p>interestingly, the <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> (35:1) actually records the practice of destroying the <em>challah</em> in the same oven that the bread is baking! I have to check again to see if that meaas covered or uncovered.</p>\n\n<p>However, the concern is that even while destroying the <em>challah</em> there will be some transfer of taste from the separated <em>challah</em> dough to the other foods in the oven. hence, the suggestion is to be cautious and either burn it alone in the oven entirely or to cover it up very well and leave it in there long enough for it to be rendered completely inedible.</p>\n\n<p>A practical suggestion: if you own a toaster oven, double wrap your lump of dough and place it in there at the highest setting until it's destroyed. This will free you from logistical issues of using your oven to prepare other foods while discharging your <em>challah</em> obligation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the purpose of Sefer Devarim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In an epic Rash\"i, the 1st one on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishit 1:1</a>, he says that technically, the entire book of Breishit would be unnecessary if we assume that the purpose of the Torah was to be a mitzvah guide and not a history book. The few mitzvot that are included in the book of Breishit could have been included in one of the other books together with the other mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that one could make a similar argument regarding the book of Devarim. It is referred to as <em>Mishneh Torah</em> which means \"a review of the Torah\". In fact, the book begins with Moshe speaking and reviewing the past events. We do see some mitzvot mentioned in Devarim that hadn't been mentioned previously like <em>Shiluach Hakan</em> and many mitzvot esp. in parshiot <em>Shoftim</em> and <em>Ki Tetze</em>. But, if the book is termed <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, it doesn't seem needed as all if the mitzvot in Devarim could have been included in the other books. At the least, it seems that until we arrive near the beginning of parshat <em>R'eh</em> Moshe discusses past events and offers a list of \"warnings\" and concepts of reward & punishments for obeying or not following all of the mitzvot. Perhaps, at least, that section could have been eliminated?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ramban describes the purpose of the book of Deuteronomy in his introduction to it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יבאר בו משה רבינו לדור הנכנס בארץ רוב מצות התורה הצריכות לישראל ולא\n  יזכיר בו דבר בתורת כהנים...שכבר ביאר אות' להם והכהנים זריזים הם לא\n  יצטרכו לאזהרה אחר אזהרה אבל בישראל יחזיר המצות הנוהגות בהם פעם להוסיף\n  בהם ביאור ופעם שלא יחזיר אות' רק להזהיר את ישראל ברוב אזהרות...ועוד\n  יוסיף...כמה מצות שלא נזכרו כלל כגון היבום...אבל לא נכתבו המצות בספרי'\n  הראשוני' שידבר עם יוצאי מצרים כי אולי לא נהגו באותן המצות רק בארץ אף\n  על פי שהן חובת הגוף...או מפני שאינן תדירות לא הזכיר רק בבנים נוחלי הארץ</p>\n  \n  <p>In the book of Deuteronomy, Moshe explained for the generation entering the land [of Israel] most of the commandments necessary for Israel and he didn't mention matters from Leviticus...for he already explained it to them, and the Kohanim were alacritous and dint require additional instructions after they were already instructed. But for the Jews, he repeated the mitsvot relevant to them, sometimes to add more clarification, and sometimes to caution them through a repetition of warnings...and he also added several mitsvot that were not previously mentioned at all, such as yibbum...[And Moshe was told them earlier] But they weren't written in the earlier books addressing the Egyptian emigres, since maybe they only practiced those mitsvot in the land [of Israel], although they are personal obligations [rather than obligations intrinsically dependent on the land]...Or because they weren't common[ly practised] it only mentioned them earlier in the context of those who would enter the land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ramban seems to be lumping together two issues: the order that Moshe conveyed different messages, and the nature and purpose of different books of Tanakh. Perhaps this conflation indicates that his general assumption is that the two are intertwined; if for whatever reason Moshe presented certain teachings later; whether as clarification of existing laws, as exhortations to keep existing laws, or as introduction of new laws, if now was when he taught it, then the place for it is Deuteronomy. The question of why include the whole book if it does not introduce new laws, however, doesn't exist in this scheme, for besides for the useful exhortations, he himself notes the existence of new legal information.</p>\n\n<p>In his last line, however, he considers the possibility that the commandments in Deuteronomy were actually instructed earlier, but not mentioned since they arent frequently practised. Accordingly, their placement in Deuteronomy is not the natural result of when they were commanded as he assumed until now. Rather it relates to the role of the Deuteronomy. Apparently, (and I stress that this line at the end of the introduction is only parenthetical, and seems to be developing a new approach to the nature of the work) Deuteronomy is a secondary work, to the primary legal books, and information that is not practiced as frequently is to be \"dumped\" there.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, Ramban seems to have no problem with the fact that passages that don't contain new legal information would be included in the Torah. This is perfectly consistent with his sentiments in Genesis (1:1) in which he rejects the (implication of the simple reading of) epic Rashi. There he is astonished at the idea that the Torah should have begun with the legal portion - after all, the creation narrative is central to the Jewish faith! Rather, he explains away that idea as emphasising not the central nature of strictly legal passages, as a reason to skip to them, but rather as emphasising the esoteric nature of the creation narrative as a reason to skip over them, and settle for the summary in the Decalogue stating that God created the world in six days, and rested on the seventh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: his first (and apparently primary approach) is that those mitsvot mentioned only in Deuteronomy wouldn't just be mentioned in earlier works, since that would be anachronistic. His second approach is that it could've theoretically been mentioned earlier, as it was already binding, but infrequently practised laws are relegated to Deuteronomy. Regarding the inclusion of passages that do not introduce new laws, Ramban does not seem bothered, likely because he never advanced that strictly legal-only vision of the Torah, in the first place.</p>\n\n\n",

Read this as though it stated sam tam, a perfect elixir. The Torah is compared to an elixir of life. There is a parable that illustrates this: A person hit his son with a strong blow and placed a bandage on his wound. And he said to him: My son, as long as this bandage is on your wound and is healing you, eat what you enjoy and drink what you enjoy, and bathe in either hot water or cold water, and you do not need to be afraid, as it will heal your wound. But if you take it off, the wound will become gangrenous.</p>\n<p>כך הקב\"ה אמר להם לישראל בני בראתי יצר הרע ובראתי לו תורה תבלין ואם אתם עוסקים בתורה אין אתם נמסרים בידו שנאמר (בראשית ד, ז) הלא אם תטיב שאת</p>\n<p>So too the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: My children, I created an evil inclination, which is the wound, and I created Torah as its antidote. If you are engaged in Torah study you will not be given over into the hand of the evil inclination, as it is stated: “If you do well, shall it not be lifted up?” (Genesis 4:7).

Moreover, all of the evil inclination’s deliberations will be concerning you, as it is stated in the same verse: “And to you is its desire.” And if you wish you shall rule over it, as it is stated in the conclusion of the verse: “But you may rule over it” (Genesis 4:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now it sounds like without learning Torah, there's no hope.

Behold, the yetzer hara, in truth , is very strong in a person. Without his knowledge it grows and overpowers him.

However, I have read in passing that use of a condom can constitute a heter for this circumstance (read in passing being mostly on blog posts and comment threads about being being questioned by a beis din about using one every time), but have not been able to find an actual halachic authority who is behind this heter, hence the question. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Ozer Grodinsky (Saifer Achiezer <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=634&pgnum=116\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:23</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=634&st=&pgnum=441\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:24,5</a>) proposes that the use of a condom should not be considered \"Derech Biah\" - the normal act of relations.

That by using a condom, and thus declassifying the act of relations as outside of the Halachic category of Biah, the act would not carry with it the same level of transgression as if one were to preform the act without a condom.

However I believe we still say the laws of the toda in 'eyzeh mekoman' in the section of the prayer known as korbanos (sacrifices).</p>\n\n<p>this is troubling because the psalm is merely an allusion to offering the sacrifice, whereas the laws of a sacrifice are supposed to be considered as if we offered the sacrifice itself when we don't have a temple and cannot offer them physically.</p>\n\n<p>so, how can we offer the toda sacrifice on pesach when it contains leaven loaves?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>We say the mishna of Eizehu Mekomon so that everyone should learn some mishnayos every day (Shulchan Aruch siman 50).

According to this view, your question is moot.</p>\n\n<p>Second, even according to the shitos that hold that the yetzer hara will be destroyed right when moshiach comes, it does not follow that a person will not be able to commit a sin. Indeed, even Adam Harishon was able to commit a sin, although there was no yetzer hara at that time. As the ramban and others explain, before Adam sinned, people had a natural inclination to do good; however, they still had the capacity to sin as Adam proved.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, even if people won't sin intentionally, they might still commit a sin unintentionally. Also as doubleAA already pointed out, the Sanhedrin not only decide if a punishment is required, but guide us in our ways, and tell us what is mutar and what is asur.</p>\n\n\n",

Incidentally, there are also some restricted activities with an <em>ervah</em> that are permitted with one's wife as a nidda. Most notably, the prohibitions of seclusion (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.37a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 37a</a>) and gazing (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5121.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Issurei Biah 21:4</a>). In general, those activities rabbinically forbidden with one's wife as a nidda, are unrelated to general prohibitions with <em>arayot</em> and the two should not be confused.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding touching a nidda</strong>: One is forbidden to touch his wife's body when she is a nidda. (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5111.htm#19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Issurei Biah 11:19</a>). This unique prohibition should not be confused with the general prohibition relating to <em>arayot</em> which likely includes nidda (see Hilhkot Issurei Biah 21:4, but cf. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/73765/harchakot-while-grieving-chv/77643#comment221213_73805\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding touching arayot in general</strong>, according to Rambam (Sefer Hamitsvot Lo Taaseh 353, Hilkhot Issurei Biah 21:1) there exists a discrete prohibition of \"<em>lo tikr'vu l'galot ervah</em>\". This includes sexual contact such as hugging and kissing in a sexually pleasing manner. This isn't a prohibition of touching per se, but on intimate contact. Rambam does not indicate that there exists some other rabbinic prohibition other than this. Accordingly, non sexual contact with any erva such as a nidda (other than one's wife) would be permissible.</p>\n\n<p>The one major dissenter in the ranks of the Rishonim, who extends this to contact that is not in and of itself overtly sensual, is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonah_Gerondi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Yonah</a> (cited in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_ben_Jacob_ha-Kohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orehot Hayyim</a> Vol II Hilkhot Biot Assurot: 13) who writes that any physical contact with a married woman (and I assume other arayot as well) is included in this Biblical prohibition:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איש אל כל שאר בשרו לא תקרבו וכן הלכה ברורה שהקריבה הזאת היא הנגיעה בידיה או בפניה או בכל אבר מאיבריה כדי ליהנות מן המגע </p>\n  \n  <p>A man may not approach any flesh of his flesh (Leviticus 18:6), and it is clearly the law that this 'approaching' is [even] touching of her hands, face, or any of her limbs, in order to enjoy the contact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: Contact with arayot (other than one's wife) such as a nidda who is not one's wife, may be Biblically included in the prohibition of <em>lo tikr'vu</em>. The Torah prohibited not just sexual acts, but other forms of contact that could lead to them. Such contact would not include mere touching according to Rambam, but would include touching according to Rabbenu Yonah if it is done for pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>While other touching would be strictly permissible, obviously everyone needs to employ common sense about what contact is prudent, and what risks leading to sin.</p>\n\n<p>[According to Ramban (hassagot to Sefer Hamitsvot Lo Ta'aseh 353) the prohibition on intimate contact is rabbinic. Accordingly, it would be the rabbis, not the Torah that enacted this fence].</p>\n\n\n",

Unfortunately I can't find a source for this explanation.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Afterwards in the Mesivtah gemarra I saw in their Yalkut Biurim that the Atzei Arazim (Even HaEzer Simman 4) asks who says she was an <em>oneis</em>, it's not clear from the verses. They write an answer in brackets (seems like it was the editors of Oz Vehadar) that since he was the king she couldn't have refused him.

Note 1 goes into details about this and discusses the machlokes between Rashi and Tosfos about whether it was a conditional divorce or not. Tosfos cites <em>Rabbeinu Tam</em> that it was unconditional and that since it was expected that she would remain faithful and remarry him when he returned, King David was castigated for abuse of authority for cohabiting with her.</p>\n\n<p>In either case, since it was a violation of halacha, she would not have been punished for disobeying authority as a king cannot (as an example) command someone to eat non-kosher food.

    "content": "# In Exodus 3:14 is there a linguistic relationship between the Tetragrammaton and the \"to be\" and what is that linguistic relationship?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In other words, is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 3:14</a> suggesting that the Tetragrammaton is a form of the verb \"to be\"? Can someone explain the linguistic path from the Tetragrammaton to the verb, \"to be\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The noun היה/הוה means \"to be\" (see <a href=\"http://www.morfix.co.il/en/%D7%94%D7%99%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>), if you add the prefix alef אהיה it means \"i will be\", if you add instead a yud יהיה it means \"he will be\". This is the the meaning of the Tetragrammaton according to the Rashbam exodus 3:15 (written in codes א\"ת ב\"ש). </p>\n\n<p>It seems that most interpreters took it as form of \"to be\", but they disagree as to what this expression is supposed to convey.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi (which almost always reflects the views of the Rabbis) interprets it meaning that <strong>i will always be with you Israel</strong>; i will take you out of egypt and even of other exiles. According to this explanation the Tetragrammaton is understood in the context of the exodus only, and the name is supposed to convey something about their condition in egypt and the exodus that will follow. </p>\n\n<p>However, Rashbam, Chizkuni and Sforno understood this more broadly, they interpret it meaning <strong>i will be or exist forever</strong>. The name reveals more about the nature of god himself, and the interpretation is more philosophical, and less focused on the condition in egypt, though it conveys something about their exodus as well. </p>\n\n<p>So you see that this linguistic relationship has not been lost to us, on the contrary it has been understood so by our Rabbis and later Jewish commentators for the past 2000 years.     </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes, very well-known. During prayers, upon encountering the Tetragrammaton, most Jewish prayer books note that the proper concentration is -- \"was, is, and will be.\" -- I.e., God is above time. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=3#C1029\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here's Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan commenting on Exodus just after 3:14</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>YHVH</strong>\n    This is the Tetragrammaton which may not be pronounced under any circumstances (cf. Sanhedrin 90a; Philo, De Vida Moses 3:519, 529). If this section is read out loud, this name should be read as 'Lord' (cf. Septuagint). This name denotes God's utter transcendence (Kuzari 2:2; Moreh Nevukhim 1:61). This name also denotes the creative power that constantly sustains the universe. God is telling Moses that not only is the initial purpose of creation now being fulfilled, but also the process that will insure its continual existence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Sorry about the long quote.  I didn't want to degrade N. M. Sarna's excellent coverage of this topic.  Please credit this answer to N. M. Sarna. However, an explanation of the meaning <em>cause to be</em> relates to names such as עבדיה Obadiah that contain the first syllable of יהוה.  For the 1st syllable to have that sound, the name would be hiphil rather than qal. The imperfect is because God didn't just cause in creation but continues to cause.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh</strong> This phrase has variously been translated, “I Am That I Am,” “I Am Who I Am,” and “I Will Be What I Will Be.” It clearly evokes YHVH, the specific proper name of Israel’s God, known in English as the Tetragrammaton, that is, “the four consonants.” The phrase also indicates that the earliest recorded understanding of the divine name was as a verb derived from the stem h-v-h, taken as an earlier form of h-y-h, “to be.” Either it expresses the quality of absolute Being, the eternal, unchanging, dynamic presence, or it means, “He causes to be.” YHVH is the third person masculine singular; ehyeh is the corresponding first person singular. This latter is used here because name-giving in the ancient world implied the wielding of power over the one named; hence, the divine name can only proceed from God Himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the course of the Second Temple period the Tetragrammaton came to be regarded as charged with metaphysical potency and therefore ceased to be pronounced. It was replaced in speech by ʾadonai, “Lord,” rendered into Greek Kyrios. Often the vowels of ʾadonai would later accompany YHVH in written texts. This gave rise to the mistaken form Jehovah. The original pronunciation was eventually lost; modern attempts at recovery are conjectural.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God’s response to Moses’ query cannot be the disclosure of a hitherto unknown name, for that would be unintelligible to the people and would not resolve Moses’ dilemma. However, taken together with the statement in 6:3, the implication is that the name YHVH only came into prominence as the characteristic personal name of the God of Israel in the time of Moses. This tradition accords with the facts that the various divine names found in Genesis are no longer used, except occasionally in poetic texts; that of all the personal names listed hitherto, none is constructed of the prefixed yeho-/yo- or the suffixed -yahu/-yah contractions of YHVH; that the first name of this type is yokheved (Jochebed), that of Moses’ mother. Ibn Ezra points out that Moses, in his direct speech. invariably uses the name YHVH, not ʾelohim, “God.” Without doubt, the revelation of the divine name YHVH to Moses registers a new stage in the history of Israelite monotheism.\n--\nSarna, N. M. (1991). <em>Exodus</em> (pp. 17–18). Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Gemara compares an eclipse to a king who leaves his guests sitting in the dark: not everyone can be left in the dark during an eclipse, as the eclipse cannot cover the entire Earth at once.</p>\n\n<p>Does this apply to all eclipses? Perhaps a total eclipse is a worse sign than a partial, like a king turning off the lights versus dimming them?</p>\n\n<p>What about the location? For instance, this August's solar eclipse crosses the continental US. Does that mean Americans should be worried, while Europeans are okay? In fact, it's impossible for the King to leave everyone in darkness if He abides by the laws of astrophysics: the moon has to be directly between the viewer and the sun, and the necessary angle changes based on where one stands. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The gemara in Sukah (29a) does mention that location matters.

So my question is, is this compatible with Jewish tradition, are there any Rabbinical sources that state that the book of Nehemiah was completed before that?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Beraita cited in Bava Batra (15a) asserts that \"עזרא כתב ספרו,\" Ezra wrote his own book (that is, the eponymous book of Ezra-Nehemiah), which certainly puts it before the days of Alexander the Great. \nThat being said, I don't know if this source precludes the possibility of later \"touching up\" of the biblical books. Later on, the Gemara comments upon various statements of the Beraita and explicitly claims that the stated authors did not write the entirety of their books. For example, the Beraita states that Yehoshua wrote Sefer Yehoshua, but the Gemara says that the last few Pesukim were written by Elazar or Pinchas. Similarly, the Gemara says that Shmuel only wrote the part of Sefer Shmuel which precedes his death, and thus the entirety of Shmuel B was written by Gad and Natan. So when the Beraita asserts that Ezra wrote his book, it need not imply that nothing therein postdates Ezra's life.</p>\n\n\n",

(Exod. 34:15)  But does not this apply to actual eating? — Said Raba: If that were so, the verse would have only said, And thou shalt eat of his sacrifice; why then say, And he will call thee? That extends the prohibition to the time of the participation. Hence </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam codifies this in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1409.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Avodah Zara (9:16)</a>. He writes that included in this is participating in a non-Jewish wedding feast. This prohibition includes any meals from when they begin preparing the wedding food, until 30 days after the festivities, plus any additional specifically wedding themed feasts.</p>\n\n<p>He explains (ibid 17) that this is motivated by the verse \"and he will call you and you will eat from his sacrifice\".</p>\n\n<p>Regarding some of these laws, Rambam writes (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1409.htm#2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">9:2</a>) that it does not apply if one knows that the gentile is not an idolater.

However, Rambam writes in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5217.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Ma'akhalot Assurot (17:10)</a> that there are various activities which the rabbis forbade lest they lead to intermarriage. One such prohibition is drinking at a non-Jewish party, even if the wine is kosher. Importantly, he specifies that \"a non-Jewish party\" is defined as a party at which most of the participants are not-Jewish. Thus, this prohibition would not apply to drinking at the same table with gentiles if there are more Jews at the party.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The halakhic sources discussed in the other answer only relate to the following situations: A Jew is invited to a wedding to a wedding of an idol worshiper, or a Jew is invited to a large party of mostly non Jews and therefore runs the risk of intermarriage. What isn't discussed is the situations in which a non Jew joins a group of Jews to eat or drink, or if one can invite a gentile to eat or drink with them.

The\n  [sages] said: [by adding honey] it becomes invalid for pouring on the\n  Mizbe’ach and become like all types of beer. And the main thing is\n  that (here, where they don’t) pour wine for Avodah Zarah, unless it is\n  wine that is suited to be brought on the Mizbe’ach. This is what Rabbi\n  Yosef Halevi of righteous and holy memory taught and this is what he\n  practiced himself on many occasions, him and all the great sages of\n  Spain.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He went to bring the high-quality pigs of Alexandria of Egypt. The Gemara asks: Is that so that he went to bring the pigs? But isn’t it taught in a baraita that Theodosius the doctor says: No cow or sow emerges from Alexandria of Egypt whose womb is not severed so that it will not give birth?

At this point, Chananya, Mishael, and Azarya are governors or councilmen or whatever similar position that has them included; Daniel is an advisor to the king, but is not in charge of any particular group.

If one converted to Orthodox Judaism, would he or she actually have to marry and have children? If so, is this a requirement across all branches of Orthodoxy (Haredi, Hasidic and Modern Orthodox), or only certain branches?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This answer is intended to paint the basic obligations in very broad strokes.

Our Sages interpret this as a positive commandment to bear children (Maimonides, Ishus 15:1). Now, in order to bear children one must first get married, which Maimonides classifies as a commandment (Ibid. 1:1) based on Deuteronomy 24:1: \"When a man will take a wife and marry her...\"</p>\n\n<p>Technically speaking, only a man is obligated in procreation (Ibid. 15:2), and he has not fulfilled his obligation until he has one son and one daughter, both of whom are capable of bearing children themselves (Ibid. 15:4).</p>\n\n<p>The reason for these commandments are so that the world will not remain empty (Gittin 41b). To quote the verse in Isaiah (45:18), \"He did not create [the world] for waste; He formed it to be settled.\"</p>\n\n<p>It's noteworthy that this instruction to bear children is the first thing G-d ever says to Adam, and that His next communication with him is regarding a mate (Genesis 2:18 - see in particular v. 24 there). </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one have a surgery during the Nine Days?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'll put the disclaimer right at the top for such a sensitive issue: See both your local orthodox Rav and local orthodox doctor if this Chas v'shalom becomes relevant to you.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Background</h1>\n<p>There are various restrictions in place from Rosh Chodesh Av for Ashkenazim and just during the week of Tisha B'Av for Sefardim. These are discussed in OC 551.</p>\n<p>The relevant portion is the final halacha in the siman, halacha 18:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צריך ליזהר מי״ז תמוז עד ט׳ באב שלא לילך יחידי מד׳ שעות עד ט׳ שעות משום שבהם קטב מרירי שולט ולא יכו התלמידים בימים ההם</p>\n<p>One must be careful from 17 Tammuz to 9 Av not to walk alone from the fourth to ninth hours of the day, when Ketev Meriri rules, and one should not hit his students during these days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(For the curious, Ketev Meriri is a demon discussed in Pesachim 111b, Midrash Tehillim 91, Eichah Rabbah 1:29, Bamidbar Rabbah 12:3, Yalkut Tehillim 842, and Tanchuma Nasso 23. The discussion about the existence of demons may be taken <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/55210/9682\">elsewhere</a>.)</p>\n<p>What's wrong with these activities that they are forbidden during this time of year? This is sourced in the above Eichah Rabbah and Tanchuma Nasso, which describe the havoc wreaked by Ketev during this time period. Accordingly, one should avoid doing things that are dangerous, lest one tempt Ketev to finish him off. The Midrash cites the example of a man being chased by another wielding a wooden stick. The latter was stopped by R' Avahu, who, seeing Ketev chasing <em>him</em> with an iron stick foresaw that were the man to beat his fellow with the wooden stick, even though he didn't intend to kill him, Ketev would continue the beating and kill him. For similar reasons, a teacher may not hit a student (which, before the government would arrest you for child abuse, was a perfectly normal form of rebuke), for fear of inciting the demon on the child.</p>\n<p>It's for this reason that one may not do anything dangerous during these days (R' Moshe in Shmaytsa d'Moshe, p. 428; R' Wozner in Kovetz MiBeis Levi, Bein HaMetzarim p. 11 sec. 12; et. al.).</p>\n<p>The Hisorerus Teshuvah (ironically, in Simon 348 - שמח) holds that the prohibition of one walking during high noon applies even in a city, something absolutely normal. The Chazon Ish (Dinim v'hanhagos 20:8) and Aruch HaShulchan (OC 551:39) argue, saying that it refers to things most people would consider dangerous, like walking alone <em>outside</em> of a city. R' Kanievsky (Nechamas Yisrael 8:161) was even concerned for one going to do a mitzvah, something even the Hisorerus Teshuvah said was okay. (All of the sources in the last two paragraphs may be found in the Dirshu Mishnah Berurah to 551:18.) <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/44056/9682\">Another question</a> quotes <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2010/07/air-travel-the-nine-days/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Shlomo Zalman</a> that one may do dangerous things for the sake of a mitzvah during this time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Question</h1>\n<p>What about a surgery? It seems obvious that a surgery which absolutely cannot be done after Tisha B'Av can and must be done before. But what about a necessary surgery which could be pushed off? Seemingly, this would be subject to the debate between the Hisorerus Teshuvah and the Chazon Ish/Aruch HaShulchan: Is the prohibition against doing things dangerous limited to things typically considered dangerous, or even more regular activities that could potentially be dangerous? The same way that the Hisorerus Teshuvah prohibits walking alone even in a city, would he prohibit a surgery?</p>\n<p>What about working backwards from Bris Milah? The Rema not once (OC 551:9) but twice (:10) discusses a se'udas mitzvah for a Bris during this time period, and the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (122:15) explicitly addresses the case and permits it, discussing what the ba'alei simchah may wear in light of the prohibition against laundry during this time. May one prove from here that a regular surgery is permissible? In general, if it's dangerous to the baby, we <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/78730/9682\">push off the Bris Milah</a>. From the fact that it is done anyway, may one prove that regular surgeries are not considered dangerous enough to be prohibited? Or perhaps there's no proof, as a Bris Milah is a mitzvah, and several commentaries (Taz, Mishnah Berurah) to the aforementioned OC 551:18 make clear that going for a mitzvah is permitted. Then again, there is the aforementioned R' Kanievsky who was concerned for one going to do a mitzvah...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The following are Poskim I found who touch on this subject (although they do no elaborate).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rabbi Felder in Shiurei Halacha page 21 bring ויש אומרים that advise to try and not have a surgery in this period.

    "content": "# Can time spent with others be counted as ma'aser, according to halacha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a question about tzedakah. In regards to the giving of 10 percent of one's income, it is my understanding that one can count the giving of resources and time spent helping others as part of the required 10 percent of income. Is this correct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Harav Melamed gives this exact answer on the website Yeshiva.org.il:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאלה : האם אפשר במקום לתת מעשר לבצע עבודות חשמל עבור ישיבה שאני\n  מעוניין לתרום לה? וכיצד להחשיב את עלות העבודה שלי, לפי התעריף הקבוע או\n  לפי תעריף מוזל? תשובה : אם זו עבודה שאותו מוסד היה צריך לשלם עבורה\n  כסף, הרי שעבודתך שווה כסף, ואפשר להחשיב את עבודתך כתשלום במקום המעשר.\n  ויש לחשב את עלות העבודה לפי התעריף המוזל, שכך מקובל בין אנשים שיש\n  ביניהם קשר טוב, שמבצעים זה לזה עבודות בתעריף מוזל. ועוד שיש לחוש שמא\n  היצר יטה את החשבון כלפי מעלה, כדי להיפטר מתשלום מעשר, וכדי להיות\n  בטוחים שהחשבון הוגן, יש ללכת לצד השני, על פי תעריף מוזל. עוד צריך\n  לציין, שכיוון שזו עבודה שהיה יכול לקבל עליה כסף, ממילא יש להחשיב כמעשר\n  רק תשעים אחוז מערך העבודה, שכן מעשר היה צריך ממילא לשלם על אותה עבודה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the answer is that if the work that is done is something that can be billed (like an electrician working on a poor person's house), you can use it as part or all of you 10%, since your work has monetary value. He states that in this case, you should use your discounted rate if you give discounts, and you can only consider 90% of that towards the 10% you owe, because had you have gotten paid for this work, you would have to give another 10% on top of that. </p>\n\n\n",

In verse 8, Moshe uses the phrase \"...that G-d has promised your fathers.\"</p>\n\n<p>What seems contradictory is that when delineating the land borders for 9 1/2 tribes (Levi doesn't get a portion; and 2 1/2 tribes took their portion East of the Jordan) the Torah marks the eastern border along the Kinneret and the Jordan River - not as far as the Euphrates (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=452\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar 34:10-12</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The conflict appears to be why G-d limited the eastern border for those remaining tribes to the west of the Jordan.

The Midrash also notes that we will get their territory in the future:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולמה נתן להם שבעה? פירשן לעתיד לבא</p>\n  \n  <p>And why did He [only] give them seven?

And this answers the unspoken second question as well. With any prophet, we expect what ge says about the future to come true. If it does not, we know he is a false prophet and must be put to death. We need not \"stand in dread\" of his wisdom or skill in performing a sign. If everything he says does come true, then we know he is \"trustworthy as a prophet of HaShem\" (1 Sam 3:20), and we must heed him. We must obey if he tells us to violate the Torah, if the situation calls for it, as with Eliyah offering sacrifice on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18). The prophet must confirm that he is \"like Moshe,\" either by performing signs (as Moshe did in Exo 4:30-31) or by accurately predicting the future (which itself is a sign). If he does so, then \"if anybody fails to heed the words he speaks in My Name, I myself will call him to account\" (verse 19); see talmidim discussion on B. Sanh. 89b. I don't think Rashi is correct when he says that such a prophet must be known to be \"perfectly righteous\". It is merely that his prophecies are considered trustworthy because up to now they have proven true. That is as much the\"sign\" by which a prophet proces himself as a sign performed in front of us. Perhaps Rashi meant what Maimonides (Rambam) says in the Mishneh Torah: when a prophet is sent, he is given a sign that will convince the people that G-d truly sent him. But not everyone who performa a sign is believed, unless he was already known to the people as someone whose wisdom and pious behaviour, greater than anyone else of his generation, made him worthy of receiving prophecy. If such a person performs a sign, we are commanded to heed him. Admittedly, not every such person really is a prophet: there may be something else going on. Nonetheless, if he is a man worthy of prophecy, we must take him at his word and heed him, just as we decide cases in court on the word of two qualified witnesses. They might indeed be lying, but since they are qualified witnesses, we give them the benefit of the doubt. As such matters fall under the category of \"concealed acts concern HaShem our G-d (29:28)\" and \"man sees only what is visible, but HaShem sees into the heart (1 Sam 16:7).\"</p>\n\n<p>Translation: The Commentators Bible - Deuteronomy - The Rubin JPS Miqra'ot Gedolot; by Michael Carasik. </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Would Yosef sleeping with the wife of Potifar have been a sin?",
    "content": "# Would Yosef sleeping with the wife of Potifar have been a sin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My understanding from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.82a.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 82a</a> is that there is no halachic construct of marriage by non-Jews and as such Potifar(a)'s \"wife\" should not have been forbidden to Yosef. It was only later during the times of the Chashmonaim that a decree was made against this type of adultery. Why then does Yosef say it would be a sin to God (Bereshis 39:9)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Yes, there is an issue of mitsvat asse  in bne noach from which we can say that it have been a sin. See <strong>Talmud Bavli Kiddushin 21b:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וראית בשביה ת\"ר וראית בשביה בשעת שביה אשת ואפילו אשת איש</p>\n<p>Our Rabbis taught: 'And thou seest among the captives' - when taking her captive; a woman - even married.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <strong>Tosfot</strong> there</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשת אפילו אשת איש. ואע\"פ דאין אישות בכותית כדאיתא פ' ד' מיתות (סנהדרין נב:) מ\"מ איכא עשה דכתיב (בראשית ב) ודבק באשתו ולא באשת חבירו.:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfot explains that despite that in Sanhedrin gemara says that there is no marrital status among bene Noach, there is a prohibition, derivated from a positive mitsva. The mitsva is \"Therefore shall a man l....... , and shall cleave to his wife\"</p>\n<p>So the gemara in Kiddushin taugh that the special situation of yefat toar, can counter this prohibition. Without this mitsva,  <strong>it remains a sin.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There's another side of a coin. Here's some reasons why it was not / could not be / could be not a sin:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>\"Sin\" is a matter of different perspectives. Remember Moses shattering the Luchot? Was it a sin? From our Halakhic perspective it was surely a sin of \"לא תעשון כן לה\"א\" - a branch of idolatry (we're forbidden to loose Divrey Kodesh). But for Moses - it was a great merit (some other times he, however, greatly \"failed\"). So the situation with Yossef could turn out either way - either Hashem was praising Yossef for this idea, or scolding him - about 50% chance.</p></li>\n<li><p>Before Matan Torah, the \"self-emerged\" Jews enjoyed a special status: they left the status of gentiles and did not yet reach the status of full Jews (hence the dispute on their status in Gemorah). This situation allowed them to be technically exempt from obeying the Mitzvot, as those were yet given in verbal and explicit form. So Yosef being a Jew was Potur of having relations with a married gentile woman, and he was yet to be commanded all the late prohibitions, like \"haBoel Aramis\", \"Le Titchatnu\", etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>We hold Yosef to be a Tzadik not only in his deeds, but his intentions also. However (according to Shmuel), he had clear intentions to have sex with this woman as he saw in prophecy the two tribes (of his sons) coming from her descendants. If so I can conclude two possible explanations: either he didn't hold it to be a sin (as we wouldn't expect him to readily sin), or he had a better Mitzvah to do (see Yaakov with the two sisters, Yosef not honoring Yaakov for years etc).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

(This is up to debate amongst the commentaries, and not for this discussion.) He writes that the lack of the י, whose value is 10, alludes to 10 commandments given over to judges. Although he does not list them, the Artscroll Ba'al HaTurim (Devarim, pg. 1813, note 41) quotes R' Chaim Kanievsky in his notes on Peirush HaRokeiach, who in turn quotes p. 140 of Otzar HaMidrashim, who in turn quotes Midrash Hashkeim.<sup>1</sup> That Midrash claims there are ten positive mitzvos and ten negative mitzvos given to the judges:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Don't show favoritism in judgement (Devarim 1:17)</li>\n<li>Don't tremble before any man (Ibid.)</li>\n<li>Don't pervert justice (Vayikra 19:15)</li>\n<li>Don't favor the impoverished (Ibid.)</li>\n<li>Don't honor the great (Ibid.)</li>\n<li>Don't pervert the judgement of the destitute (Shemos 23:6)</li>\n<li>Don't pervert the judgement of a convert or orphan (Devarim 24:17)</li>\n<li>Don't pervert judgement (Devarim 16:19)</li>\n<li>Don't show favoritism (Ibid.)</li>\n<li>Don't take bribes (Ibid.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Midrash concludes by saying that just as there are 10 commandments to judges, so, too, there are 10 <strike>Commandments</strike> Statements, which shows that Hashem values the judges as He does the Torah itself.</p>\n\n<p>Why does this Midrash list these particular mitzvos? The Rambam, at the beginning of Hilchos Sanhedrin (Sefer Shoftim), lists 30 mitzvos related to the judges. Once you narrow the list to those directed at the judges themselves, you get the following list:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>To follow the majority</li>\n<li>Not to convict until you have a majority of at least two</li>\n<li>Once a judge votes to acquit, he may not change his vote to convict</li>\n<li>To kill certain individuals by stoning</li>\n<li>To kill certain individuals by burning</li>\n<li>To kill certain individuals by beheading</li>\n<li>To kill certain individuals by choking</li>\n<li>To hang bodies that were killed in court</li>\n<li>To bury those killed in court on the day they were killed</li>\n<li>Not to leave those who were hung<sup>2</sup> for extended periods of time</li>\n<li>Not to let a witch live</li>\n<li>To give lashes to the wicked</li>\n<li>Not to give too many lashes</li>\n<li>Not to punish one who was forced</li>\n<li>Not to judge on assumptions</li>\n<li>Not to take pity on a murderer or damager</li>\n<li>Not to favor the poor</li>\n<li>Not to honor the great</li>\n<li>Not to tilt justice against known sinners</li>\n<li>Not to pervert justice</li>\n<li>Not to tilt the justice of an orphan or widow</li>\n<li>To judge righteously</li>\n<li>Not to be afraid of the litigants</li>\n<li>Not to accept bribes</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So if there are 24 mitzvos directed at the judges, why does the Midrash list these ten in particular? Further, the Midrash starts off by saying that there are ten positive and ten negative mitzvos. If you want to say that over the years we lost some of the text and we lost the part that lists the ten positive mitzvos, fine. But the Rambam only lists nine positive mitzvos!</p>\n\n<p>To sum up: <strong>How can the Midrash say that there are only ten negative mitzvos directed at judges, when there are much more? And how can the Midrash say that there are ten positive mitzvos directed at judges, when there are less?</strong></p>\n\n<p>(If someone can conjure up another Rishon's list of mitzvos that provides exactly 20 mitzvos, ten positive and ten negative, directed at judges, that would be an acceptable answer. We don't need to pasken a Midrash as Halacha, so there's no issue that the Rambam doesn't go like the Midrash; the question is which list the Midrash is using.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>If somebody can find that original source, that would be great, but not necessarily necessary to properly answer this question.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup><a href=\"http://grammarist.com/usage/hanged-hung/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hanged is only used when one was killed in that fashion.</a></p>\n\n\n",

G-d directs them,    <em><strong>through Divine Providence</strong></em>, through the various tests and circumstances of their life which their particular soul requires in order to arrive at the best possible moment, when they are motivated sufficiently, to enter <em><strong>or re-enter</strong></em> under the wings of the Shechinah. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.5?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Bereshit 12:5</a>.</p>\n<p>This can happen at different times, sometimes early in physical  life, sometimes quite late, even shortly before drawing their last breath at the end of life.</p>\n<p>But the overriding drive, like a salmon returning to the river in which it was spawned so many years before, is that such an individual is consumed with the desire to become Jewish, to be accepted by the entire Jewish people, as one of their own without exception and in all circumstances.</p>\n<p>And ultimately, the only way to accomplish this is to accept what the Torah (<em>that was given at Mount Sinai, meaning both the written and oral Torah</em>) requires, just like it happened to the entire Jewish people, literally and physically. (<em>The act is the primary thing!</em> המעשה הוא העיקר) This is what Moshe Rabbeinu meant in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.29.12-14?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 29:12-14</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>לְמַ֣עַן הָקִֽים־אֹתְךָ֩ הַיּ֨וֹם ׀ ל֜וֹ לְעָ֗ם וְה֤וּא יִֽהְיֶה־לְּךָ֙ לֵֽאלֹהִ֔ים כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּר־לָ֑ךְ וְכַאֲשֶׁ֤ר נִשְׁבַּע֙ לַאֲבֹתֶ֔יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹֽב</strong>׃\n<strong>וְלֹ֥א אִתְּכֶ֖ם לְבַדְּכֶ֑ם אָנֹכִ֗י כֹּרֵת֙ אֶת־הַבְּרִ֣ית הַזֹּ֔את וְאֶת־הָאָלָ֖ה הַזֹּֽאת׃</strong>\nכִּי֩ אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֨ר יֶשְׁנ֜וֹ פֹּ֗ה עִמָּ֙נוּ֙ עֹמֵ֣ד הַיּ֔וֹם לִפְנֵ֖י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֑ינוּ <strong>וְאֵ֨ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵינֶ֛נּוּ פֹּ֖ה עִמָּ֥נוּ הַיּֽוֹם׃</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That in order to make a legally binding covenant in this world, the parties must be alive, meaning a soul dressed in a physical body. There were root souls of the entire Jewish people physically present, souls dressed in their bodies, when this covenant was started by Moshe Rabbeinu between G-d and the nation then.</p>\n<p>But there were also present at that time, all the future souls, not yet dressed in a physical Jewish body. Those souls initiated at that time their future acceptance when they would eventually come to be dressed in a physical, Jewish body. This follows the explanation from <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20632&st=&pgnum=9&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Komarna Rebbe in his introduction to his commentary on the Chumash</a>, Heichal HaBracha and also <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20837&st=&pgnum=362\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the commentary Maskil David</a> by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pardo_(Italian_rabbi)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi David Pardo</a> there.</p>\n<p>When a potential Jewish convert follows the same procedure that all Jews followed in order to receive the Torah at Mount Sinai, their physical body is chosen by G-d, just like then and the Jewish soul that up until then had been dressed in a non-Jewish body, is then dressed in a new, Jewish body. This is the true meaning mentioned in the Torah of <em><strong>Gathering the Holy Sparks</strong></em> (those souls) that fell at the very beginning of Creation from the shattering of the vessels and that were dispersed among the various nations of the world. The status of that body becomes chosen by the Creator and that vessel is converted from its original status to a new and different thing.</p>\n<p>Like is taught by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, G-d's choice is not between the Jewish soul and the non-Jewish soul, which are categorically different, like is emphasized in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.24-27?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:24-27</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 2:7</a>. It is between the two things that are similar, meaning the body.</p>\n<p>This is why, after conversion, the Jewish convert is required to say the  Torah blessings at the start of each day, just like any other Jew, which includes the specific language:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, <strong>אֲשֶׁר בָּחַר בָּנוּ מִכָּל הָעַמִּים וְנָתַן לָנוּ אֶת תּוֹרָתוֹ.</strong> בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ. נוֹתֵן הַתּוֹרָה:</p>\n<p>Blessed are You, L-rd our God, King of the Universe <strong>Who chose us from among all the peoples and gave us His Torah.</strong> Blessed are You, L-rd, Giver of the Torah!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Otherwise, it would be an invalid blessing!</p>\n<p>This is also why a convert is compared to a young child. (כמו קטן שנולד בזה עתה) <em>Like a child that is born at that moment</em>, just like is stated in tractate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.22a.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 22a</a>.</p>\n<p>And in this context, it is important to note the precise choice of words from Yevamot, that the new convert is like a child (וְגֵר שֶׁנִּתְגַּיֵּיר <strong>כְּקָטָן שֶׁנּוֹלַד</strong> דָּמֵי.) That a child (קטן) <em>is not a newborn infant</em> (ילד) emerging from the womb of its Mother.</p>\n<p>And like is defined in tractate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.65a.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 65a</a>, there are three different stages for someone referred to as a child:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>When they are mature enough to know what they do and do not want for themselves. In actual children, this is approximately age 3 to 5. This age range is also related to <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/585406/jewish/At-what-age-does-Torah-education-begin.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the time to begin Torah education for a Jewish child</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When they mature enough to understand buying and selling. That when they sell something, it no longer belongs to them. This occurs in actual children at approximately age 6 to 9.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When they mature enough to make vows (nedarim), (which is one year before sexual maturity which Torah defines as 11 years old for girls and 12 for boys.) and to first enter into marriage (which Torah defines as up until age 20). It should be noted that this final threshold is in relation to being able to have children, reproduce and raise a family responsibly (reaching the age of majority).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this last context, it is appropriate to note that the Giving of the Torah (מתן תורה) at Mount Sinai is compared to and is the paradigm for Jewish marriage like Ramban Shimon ben Gamliel says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Ta%27anit.4.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Taanit 4:8</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר, צְאֶינָה וּרְאֶינָה בְּנוֹת צִיּוֹן בַּמֶּלֶךְ שְׁלֹמֹה בָּעֲטָרָה שֶׁעִטְּרָה לּוֹ אִמּוֹ בְּיוֹם חֲתֻנָּתוֹ וּבְיוֹם שִׂמְחַת לִבּוֹ (שיר השירים ג). <strong>בְּיוֹם חֲתֻנָּתוֹ, זֶה מַתַּן תּוֹרָה.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Their previous status of being a non-Jew ceases to exist and they are one of the Jewish people from that moment forward. For the true convert, the day of their conversion is the completion of the act that was started so long ago at Mount Sinai. In that sense, it is for them, their personal and very real moment of receiving the eternal Torah.</p>\n<p>And in summation from all the above, I would like to thank Avishai Tebeka for causing me to look more closely at what the Lubavitcher Rebbe has written in regard to the various customs for the observation and celebration of ones birthday like it appears in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15806&st=&pgnum=45\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaSichot 5748, volume 2, pages 406-47</a>.</p>\n<p>That the Rebbe enumerates that one celebrates the birthday because of the blessing of increased and continued life (meaning a soul dressed in a physical body), which would pertain to biological life. For the Jewish convert, that begins like it does with all living creatures.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe even says that where possible one should try to say the Shehechiyanu prayer on ones birthday (over new fruit or a new garment). Which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, <strong>שֶׁהֶחֱיָנוּ וְקִיְּמָנוּ וְהִגִּיעָנוּ לַזְּמַן הַזֶּה</strong>.</p>\n<p>Blessed are You, L-rd our G-d,\nKing of the Universe,\n<strong>who has given us life, sustained us,\nand brought us to this time.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also mentions starting to recite the new chapter of Psalms corresponding to ones biological age.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe also compares it to Rosh HaShanah and a time for personal reflection over the past year and how to improve oneself in the coming year. Rosh HaShanah relates to both Jews and non-Jews in accepting G-d as being King over all of creation and in that sense, for the Jewish convert, it would connect to the day of biological birth.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, the Rebbe suggests that one should reflect on one of the times when they had a private meeting with their Rebbe. To recall what they asked about, what answers they received and how they can improve in those areas to study his teachings, his Torah. That would seem to relate more to the actual day of conversion.</p>\n<p>But the Rebbe also says that with each new birthday, one should increase in their Torah study, both in the revealed aspects of Torah and the inner aspects of Torah and to increase in influencing others in particular with regard to <strong>Ahavat Yisrael</strong>, <em>loving you fellow Jew</em>. For the convert, that would specifically relate to the day of their actual conversion, when they became a Jew in physical, material reality.</p>\n<p>And finally, the Rebbe suggests arranging a festive gathering with family, friends and loved ones in order to praise and thank G-d in particular in regard to ones personal joy over Torah and the performance of the commandments. That relates to the idea of <strong>Matan Torah</strong>, <em>the acceptance of the Yoke of Heaven</em> and <em>the acceptance of the Yoke of the Commandments</em> and so would relate, for the Jewish convert, to the actual day of their conversion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <strong>The Rebbe in Igrot Kodesh 30:18 and in Hiskashrus 211:308</strong> says that it's reasonable to say a convert’s birthday is the day of their conversion based on Yevamot 22a that says, גר שנתגייר כקטן שנולד דמי.</p>\n<p><strong>According to <a href=\"https://minchasasher.com/he/shiur/uncategorized-he/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%90-%D7%92%D7%A8-%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%92%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A8-%D7%9B%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%9F-%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93-%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%99/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Asher Weiss</a></strong> it seems that he holds we only say גר שנתגייר כקטן שנולד דמי with regards קירבה, יחוס, דיני שמים so according to this, a convert would celebrate his birthday when he was actually, and one is considered the same age before he converted.</p>\n<p><strong>Rav Yitzchak Yosef in Yalkut Yosef Sefirat Haomer page 844-854 in the section called קונטרס דברי יוסף סימן ה</strong> seems to conclude like Rav Asher Weiss that only with regards to קירבה, יחוס, דיני שמים do we say גר שנתגייר כקטן שנולד דמי, and one is considered the same age before he converted.</p>\n<p>It is still recommended to celebrate the day of conversion, according to Rav Yitzchak Yosef and Rav Asher Weiss as it is a happy day.</p>\n\n\n",

I plan on trying to think about it myself as well as looking at some rishonim, most probably radak. Again, I am willing to receive advice as to what it will take to get a decent understanding of what is going on.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question is a good one although in terms of site guidelines, it may get a recommendation for closure because the answer will be mostly opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Resist the idea that you don't have enough time. Like with all types of Torah study, regular, fixed study, no matter how small or large, is the more important goal. Adding Navi to your seder should not diminish from whatever your current studies are.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of order, follow what Chazal have set up for you, meaning the order as the books appear in Tanach. The oldest authoritative Tanachs which we have access to are the Leningrad Codex which was written in the 11th century CE and the Keter Aram Tzovah, also known as the Aleppo Codex which was written in the 10th century CE. Rambam, along with many others, acknowledged the accuracy of the Aleppo Codex. They both list the order of the later prophets as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets. This is also the order followed by Rabbi Don Yitzchok Abarbanel in his commentary to the later prophets.</p>\n\n<p>There may be some question about this because the Tur in Yoreh Deah 283:5, and Shulchan Aruch 283:7 citing the beraita in Bava Bathra 14b place Isaiah after Jeremiah and Ezekiel. But Aruch HaShulchan 283:14 acknowledges that the order cited in Bava Bathra was not followed after their day. The order was set with Isaiah first.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible that the order from Bava Bathra is only relevant when the Tanach is bound in a scroll, like a Sefer Torah. This would relate to the view of the Rema cited in Aruch HaShulchan 283:6.</p>\n\n<p>But this doesn't answer the reasoning for the order found in these two early, authoritative sources from expert Soferim. To this one can look to the Tur, Yoreh Deah 275:11 which quotes Rambam saying there are many things that are required for sifrei kodesh which are not recorded in the Talmud but are the minhag of the Soferim passed down among them only orally.</p>\n\n<p>It is suggested that the reasoning of the Soferim is based upon how the content of each of the later prophets is described in Bava Bathra, that Jeremiah is about the destruction of the Temple, Ezekiel is a mixture of the destruction and the salvation, while Isaiah, the prophet of the redemption, is about salvation only, the geulah.</p>\n\n<p>The order used by the Aleppo and Leningrad Codexes, which is how most printed Tanachs are ordered, is based upon the teaching of Raba and Reish Lakish found in Megillah 13b. That G-d does not smite Israel before first creating the remedy. The remedy, the prophecy of salvation, comes first. And this principle also follows the teaching of Rashi to Esther 3:1 and parshat V'Etchanan 6:25 as well as Rabbi Chaim bar Avraham HaKohen of Aram Tzovah in his commentary Torat Chacham 311b on Esther 2:23 and the teaching of the Lubavitcher Rebbe in Torat Menachem Hitva'adiyut, vol. 47, pg. 244.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of commentaries, Rashi, Targum and Radak are a solid foundation. If you have them, Arbarbanel and Malbim are worth including, but it is extra. Again, try to make it a fixed study with additions when you are so motivated and circumstances permit.</p>\n\n<p>Try to keep in mind that the Navi'im chosen for the Tanach were selected from all those that were known because their prophecies applied to each and every generation. That means that there is a flexible/adaptive dimension to Navi in addition to the \"<em>correct</em>\" fixed intention.</p>\n\n<p>Another very important thing to keep in mind is that the language of the Prophets is largely allegorical/allusion/hints. It is possible that some of the language can be taken litererally, but that is more the exception than the rule. And like with all Torah study, the primary idea for each individual is that it lead to action. <strong>המעשה הוא העיקר</strong>. So ones personal study of Navi is intended to refine and improve their performance of the mitzvot and their service to HaShem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From personal experience I would recommend picking a book and going through it several times without any commentary just to know the basic content. The best way I have found to do this is to start with an audio shiur (I recommend yutorah and hatanakh.com) this way you can have a basic grasp of the material first and then go through the text with a single commentary so that you can grasp that commentator's approach. In terms of which commentary if you are looking for a conceptual understanding which generally tries to outline themes I would recommend Malbim. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding which Navi to learn you mention Yeshaya - I think that's the best one to start with as there is a lot of very fundamental material there. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The book of Jeremiah ties in very closely to — even, I would say, is part of — the story of the destruction of the first Temple, with which you may already be familiar. Unlike Isaiah and some of the Twelve, it's written mostly without flowery language or difficult-to-comprehend turns of phrase. And, if I recall correctly, it uses less metaphor than Isaiah or Ezekiel, though it does have prophecies about non-Jewish nations.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rashi's misquoting in Parashat Pinchas?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom everybody, \nWe read lately Parashat Pinchas. The parsha deals with the story of B'not Tzelofchad (Barmidbar 27:1-11). Rashi on verse 27:3 quotes the Gemara Shabbat 96b in order to identify who Tzelofrad was and what he did wrong. Rashi says that according this Gemara, there is a machloket between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Shimon. But if you go on Daf 96b of tractate Shabbat, the machloket is between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteirah. \nHow can we explain this discrepancy?\nRegards, </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Perhaps <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.27.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> attributed the position that Tzelofechad was not the \"collector of sticks\" (R' Akiva's position) but one of the \"<em>Ma'apilim</em>\" who prematurely stormed Cana'an in <a href=\"https://sefaria.com/Numbers.4.14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num 4:14</a> based on a source in the Midrash rather than on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.96b.19-97a.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 96b-97a</a>.</p>\n\n<p>First, it's not clear that the Gemara in Shabbat associates this position, in particular, with R' Yehuda ben Beteira. The direct quote from R' Yehuda there was about taking exception to R' Akiva's position that Tzelofechad was the stick-collector and implying a position of uncertainty on that score. The Gemara continues by offering the alternative, that he was one of the <em>Ma'apilim</em>, but that could be an anonymous follow-up, rather than the position of R' Yehuda himself. (This is how it's interpreted in the William Davidson Talmud on Sefaria, linked above.)</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion that Rashi's attribution comes from the Midrash is based on a partial match I found in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalkut_Shimoni\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shim'oni</a>, at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.773.14?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">773:14</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי אליעזר בן יעקב אומר נאמר כאן מדבר ונאמר להלן ויהיו בני ישראל במדבר מה כאן צלפחד אף להלן צלפחד. אמר ליה רבי שמעון אפשר לומר כן מקושש בשנה ראשונה שיצאו ממצרים בשנים ועשרים לחדש השני וכי אפשר שהיו בנות צלפחד בנות מלכים נאות וכשרות הקטנה שבהן יושבת ארבעים שנה ולא נשאת וכי באיזו שנה מת צלפחד בשנה שנאמר וישמע הכנעני.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There, we have the position that Tzelofechad was the stick-collector attributed to R' Eliezer ben Ya'akov and rejected by R' Shimon. R' Shimon doesn't object to the propriety of this association, like R' Yehuda in the Gemara, and assert uncertainty; he rejects the association based on how the timeline works out. So, while we don't see there that R' Shimon offers the <em>Ma'apilim</em> association as an alternative, we do see him as a strong opponent of the stick-collector association.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps Rashi had access to a statement in the Midrash where R' Shimon did provide the alternative association; the Yalkut Shim'oni quoted this statement partially, leaving out the alternative association; and the original statement is otherwise lost to us now.</p>\n\n\n",

He doesn't say the meat is not kosher (see e.g., <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37396/11501\">this answer</a> on MY). Nevertheless, some (e.g., R Moshe Dovid Tendler, the son-in-law of RMF) do not eat veal for ethical reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The questions you raise are nevertheless important and I have also become increasingly sensitive to the treatment of animals in industrial settings and how this impact a Jew's ability to eat meat.</p>\n\n<p>Heshy and Malky Zelcer wrote an excellent summary of the issues in Hakirah (vol. 24 Spring 2018, pp. 173ff, see <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol24ZelcerHandM.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> but also <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol25Zivotofsky.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this important response</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol25ZelcerHandM.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">its rejoinder</a>).</p>\n\n<p>They bring multiple opinions showing <strong>inhumane treatment of animals is prohibited because of <em>tzar baalei hayim</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>R Moshe Feinstein writes it is permissible to cause to pain to an animal when done for the fulfilment of a human need (which includes slaughtering them) but not if it is only for economic profit or to beautify the meat (e.g., keeping veal meat white)</li>\n<li>Sefer Hasidim prevents causing un-necessary pain to animals (p. 425, sec. 666)</li>\n<li>R Samson Raphael Hirsch writes one may hurt animals only for sensible human purposes and then only in the least painful manner (Horeb, p. 292-3, 60:416)</li>\n<li>Sefer Hakhinukh writes the animal must not be unduly pained. The Torah allows man to eat from them and use them for all his needs, but not to cause them needless pain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>However</strong> even if it is not proper to raise animals by making them suffer, <strong>their meat is nevertheless kosher and one is not forbidden to eat it</strong>. The authors bring a <em>tshuva</em> from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Kamenetsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Shmuel Kamenetsky</a> who writes</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>concerning actual practice (of raising animals in industrial settings), it is not proper for the descendants of Abraham to do so, whereas according to Igrot Moshe (above) there is even a possibility of an actual violation</li>\n<li>but as for buying eggs and the flesh of chickens that were raised in this manner described above, it appears from the Igrot Moshe that there is no possibility of a violation, for there is no reinforcement of cruel habits, and the purchaser has no part in the <em>tzar baalei hayim</em>, nor is there any fear of being an accessory to the <em>tzar baalei hayim</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That answers your third and fourth questions. Regarding your question of how kosher authorities consider this issue, R Menachem Genack, CEO and Rabbinic Administrator of the OU (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Union#Kosher_certification\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">largest</a> kosher supervision agency in the world) was <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/news/yated_interview_with_rabbi_menachem_genack_chief_executive_officer_and_rabb/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">interviewed</a> in Yated and said</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We don’t believe that it is the responsibility of the OU or\n  any kashrus agency to be the arbiters of those [worker and animal treatment] issues, because they\n  are all covered by different federal and state laws and regulations.\n  State and Federal agencies – the USDA, OSHA, FDA, and the EPA, which\n  handles environmental issues – have the authority and expertise to\n  handle these issues. We don’t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even though, the OU <a href=\"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/religious-revelations-from-the-slaughterhouse/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">recently decided</a> to remove its certification from any meat processing plants that use a method of inverting beef cows before <em>schechita</em> which is considered particularly stressful to animals.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, the solution to the ethical issues of animal treatment is small-scale (or family) farming where animals are left to grow on their own and not injected with antibiotics. However it is hard to imagine that this would scale to the quantities required by the market and would likely increase prices significantly.</p>\n\n<p>Some smaller-scale companies have developed \"humane treatment kosher meat\", e.g., <a href=\"https://www.growandbehold.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Grow & Behold</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kolfoods.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">KOL Foods</a>. In Israel there is also a <em>hekhsher</em> (certification) called <a href=\"http://haibari.co.il/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hai Bari</a> which guarantees to consumers that their meat and dairy products come from farms which implement the highest animal welfare standards. See also <a href=\"https://www.vosizneias.com/200963/2015/04/22/new-york-rav-moshes-veal-ban-to-be-lifted-in-the-future/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for evolving standards on raising veal that would enable R Moshe Dovid Tendler to remove his ban on eating veal.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in these issues, I would recommend <a href=\"http://podcast.headlinesbook.com/e/111817-kashrus-and-animal-cruelty-kashrus-of-foie-gras-and-veal/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this episode</a> of the Headlines podcast which discusses Kashrus and Animal Cruelty — Kashrus of Foie Gras and Veal and includes interviews with R Moshe Elefant (Chief Rabbinic Coordinator and COO of the OU) as well as producers of kosher ethical food.</p>\n\n\n",

These levels are far below \"shishim\", but are unavoidable today and are probably far lower today than they were historically.  Over six decades ago my (eminent) rabbi (z\"l), answered a phone call from a hysterical congregant, who just read that the M&Ms she had bought and consumed contained gelatin and had no hekhsher (to this day I have not checked to see whether M&Ms did then, or do today, contain gelatin, I just rely on his ruling). Now, gelatin is of course animal collagen broken-down by heat, likely from a cow or a pig slaughtered commercially. Rabbi G. assured her that shishim applied, both because of the low levels used and the chemical reduction of the collagen from which it was derived. So she noshed happily ever after. Before synthetic heparin became available, folks got it extracted from some part of a slaughtered pig, likewise some useful medicines from the pituitary gland of a pig. And I know of a fellow whose life was saved by a pig's artery or vein transplanted to his heart (of course, it was not eaten(!!), and I guess medicines are not really \"eaten\" even if consumed, since they are a pikuakh nefesh necessity).

    "content": "# May one learn Torah from an unacceptable source on Tisha B'Av in the context of a source that is permissible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>For instance, Midrash Eichah is on the list in the Mechaber (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.554.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 554:2</a>). One piece in there discusses the comparison between the Eichah's mentioned by Moshe, Yeshaya, and Yirmiya (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eichah_Rabbah.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eichah Rabbah 1:1</a>). Let's say I want to understand the Midrash a little better, so I want to look at those three passages inside. Obviously the one said by Yirmiya - Megillas Eichah - is okay, but are there any leniencies to permit reading the passage in Devarim 1 and Yeshaya 1, where those Eichah's are mentioned, in order to better understand the text at hand?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 124:5 it's written (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דברי תורה משמחין את הלב, שנאמר פקודי ה' ישרים משמחי לב. ולכן אסור בתשעה באב ללמד תורה, כי אם בדברים שמעציבים את לבו, כגון בספר ירמיה בדברים הרעים שבו, ופסוקי נחמה שבו ידלג. וכן פרעניות על אמות העולם שכתובות שם ידלג. וכן מתר ללמד בספר איוב, ומדרש איכה, וגמרא פרק אלו מגלחין וכו, דמירי בדיני אבל ומנדה, ובהגדה דפרק הנזקין, וירושלמי סוף מסכת תענית, דמירי מחרבן. <strong>ואף באלו שהוא מתר ללמד, אסור לעין בהם איזה קשיא ותרוץ או דרוש, כי משמחים את הלב.</strong> וכל מה שמתר האדם ללמד בעצמו, מתר ללמד גם עם תינוקות. מתר לקרות כל סדר היום, אפלו איזהו מקומן. וסדר מעמדות אין לומר, אפלו מי שרגיל לאמרו בכל יום - תקנד </p>\n  \n  <p>The words of Torah make the heart glad as it is said:  ''The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart'',  therefore it is forbidden on the 9th of Av to learn Torah,  excepting those topics which sadden one's heart,  for example in the book of Jeremiah the evil (prophecies) in it,  and the verses of comfort should be omitted.  Also the calamities on the nations of the world that are written there are omitted.  It is allowed to study the book of Job,  and the midrash on Lamentations,  and the Gemara ''And these can shave on the festival...'',  which covers the laws of mourning and ostracism,  and the stories (of the destruction of Jerusalem and Beitar)  in (Gittin) the (fifth) chapter ''Damages'',  and the Jerusalem Talmud at the end of tractateTa'anit (Fast)  which covers the destruction of the Temple.  <strong>However, even in these that one is allowed to study,  it is forbidden to enter in to any (halachic) difficulty,  or explanation or commentary,  because (these) bring pleasure to the heart.</strong>  Everything that one is allowed to learn by oneself,  one can also teach to children.  One can read (all the Torah topics in) the daily order of prayer  even ''Which were the places...''.  The order of ''Ma-amodot'' are not said even by one who is accustomed to saying it every day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication from here (and DoubleAA was hinting to it in his comment) is that the purpose of being allowed to learn only specific areas of Torah is to cause one to become more emotionally involved in the day. Getting too caught up in the details of the piece of Torah being learnt changes the exercise from being an emotional one to a logical one, which seemingly wouldn't be allowed according to the Kitzur.</p>\n\n<p>However, last Shabbos, during the weekly Gemara Taanis Shiur given by one of local Rabbonim in my community, we were discussing the source for this in the Gemara (Daf 30a), and the Rav mentioned the opinion of the Chazon Ish who holds differently than the Kitzur. While I don't have the source, the gist of what was quoted from the Chazon Ish was that it's not possible for one to truly 'learn' something without delving deeply into the subject, and if the Chachomim allowed one to learn specific topics, then one must be allowed to delve as deeply into the subject as one can.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it would seem like based on this second opinion, you would be allowed to follow the chain of sources in order to better understand the piece that you are learning.</p>\n\n\n",

In what way was Jerusalem desolate without inhabitants?  Does this have a non-literal meaning? NOTE: I am not referring to the question of Nachem after 1967. I am asking what this prayer could have meant for the nineteen hundred years beforehand.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Two thousand years beforehand, they may not have said this text.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2700.htm#23\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam's text</a>, for example, does not have it, nor do Seder Rav Amram Gaon (ed. Harpenes: Seder Tisha B'av), or Seder Rav Sa'adya Gaon, which just has השוממה.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it is present in the Siddur of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_of_Worms\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Eleazar Rokeah</a> (ch. 123 p. 637). His Siddur makes clear that the references to being bereft of its inhabitants refer particularly to the Jewish inhabitants.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והשוממה מכל טוב. האבלה מבלי בניה שאין ישראל בתוכה, דרכי ציון אבילות מבלי באי מועד...והשוממה מבלי יושב אין איש מיהודה יושב בה, כל שעריה שוממין. היא יושבת בגוים </p>\n  \n  <p>Desolate of all good. That is in mourning without her children: for the Jews are not in it; \"The paths of Zion are mourning, without pilgrims.\" And bereft with no inhabitants; there is no man of Judah living in it: \"All its gates are destroyed.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The line השוממה מאין יושב is thus particularly understandable in light of the line: ויבלעוה לגיונים, ויירשוה עובדי פסילים; that it was occupied by foreign legions and idolaters.</p>\n\n<p>This prayer referencing general destruction, absence of Jewish inhabitants, and occupation by foreign armies was always true to one degree or another following the destruction of the Second Templ, until modern times. For example, following the destruction of Jerusalem (in 70), Josephus writes (<a href=\"http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/war-7.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Wars of the Jews: Book VII:1</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now as soon as the army had no more people to slay or to plunder, because there remained none to be the objects of their fury (for they would not have spared any, had there remained any other work to be done), [Titus] Caesar gave orders that they should now demolish the entire city and Temple...<strong>there was left nothing to make those that came thither believe it [Jerusalem] had ever been inhabited</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bar Kokhba revolt</a> 65 years later: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Resulted in the extensive depopulation of Judean communities, more so than the First Jewish–Roman War of 70 CE. According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews perished in the war and many more died of hunger and disease. In addition, many Judean war captives were sold into slavery. The Jewish communities of Judea were devastated to an extent which some scholars describe as a genocide. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Jews were barred from entering Jerusalem except for on Tisha B'av (ibid). They remained banned throughout the remainder of its time as a Roman province, except during a brief period of Persian rule from 614 to 629. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jerusalem#Post-Crisis_Roman_and_Early_Byzantine_Empire_period\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Later, during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusade\" rel=\"noreferrer\">First Crusade</a>, Jerusalem was captured by Christians in 1099, and:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The capture was accompanied by a massacre of almost all of the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jerusalem#Kingdom_of_Jerusalem_.28Crusaders.29_period\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Specifically:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to the Muslim chronicle of Ibn al-Qalanisi, \"The Jews\n  assembled in their synagogue, and the Franks burned it over their\n  heads. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1099)#Jews\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This period lasted until the Crusaders were defeated at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1187)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Siege and Fall of Jerusalem in 1187</a>. About 30 years later, Jerusalem and its Jewish inhabitants <em>again</em> suffered destruction when the Ayyubid ruler of Syria, Al-Mu'azzam destroyed Jerusalem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The city suffered two waves of destruction in 1219 and 1220. This was absolute and brutal destruction, with most buildings in Jerusalem and its walls destroyed...The vast majority of the population, including the Jewish community, left Jerusalem. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jerusalem_during_the_Kingdom_of_Jerusalem#Destruction_of_Jerusalem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From 1229 to 1244 the city was returned to mostly Christian control, by Abassids allied with them. In the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1244)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Siege of 1244</a>, however, As-Salih Ayyub who not allied with the Crusaders, summoned a huge mercenary army of Khwarezmians, who proceeded to again, destroy the city.</p>\n\n<p>In 1260, after the city is retaken by the Ayyubids from the Khwarezmians, it is raided by Mongols. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Jerusalem#Bahri_Mamluk_and_Burji_Mamluk_periods\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Almost a decade later, when Ramban moved to Jerusalem, he is reputed to have found just two Jewish families (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Jerusalem#Bahri_Mamluk_and_Burji_Mamluk_periods\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>).</p>\n\n<p>While the population grew with time, even 200 years later, in the late 15th century the Jewish population of Jerusalem varied from 76-250 families (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Jerusalem#Middle_Ages\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>). Following a \"mass\" migration led by Yehuda Hassid (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/60882/8775\">here</a> about him and his synagogue) in 1700 (when the Jewish population was about 1200), the Jewish population rose to 2000 by 1723. (AFAIK the highest it was since the destruction of temple, and probably just a fraction of a percent of its population then). By the early 19th century, its Jewish population <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Jerusalem#Muslim_.22relative_majority.22\" rel=\"noreferrer\">was no higher</a>. After multiple waves of immigration, and significant philanthropic efforts on behalf of residents, the population reached 10000 at the end of the 19th century, and rapidly grew to almost 100000 in 1944. </p>\n\n<p>While the city wasn't always totally uninhabited, or even bereft of all of Jewish inhabitants, (See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Jerusalem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">timeline</a>) it frequently changed hands among foreign invaders, was destroyed multiple times, banned Jews for centuries, and for nearly two millennia did not return, to even a shadow of its former self (with a Jewish population of hundreds of presumably hundreds of thousands (Tacitus says 600000) before the destruction of the second Temple.).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Alternatively, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Mordechai_Alter\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Imrei Emmet</a> explains this as referring to the heavenly Jerusalem not being inhabited by God, as it is stated (Ta'anit 5a) that God will not enter the heavenly Jerusalem, until he enters the terrestrial Jerusalem. (Cited in Daf Al HaDaf to Ta'anit 5a).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Perhaps מאין יושב. Does not refer to a complete absence of inhabitants, but a lack.

He writes in chapter 5 of Netsah Yisrael, that the prostitute is a metaphor for the foreign Gods which Titus increasingly embraced:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שאמר שתפס זונה בידו ונכנס לבית המקדש. פירוש...דבק באלהי נכר. וזה נקרא ש'תפס זונה', כי עבודה זרה נמשלה כזונה, כי בכל מקום גבי עבודה זרה כתיב \"זונה\" (ויקרא יז, ז) \"ולא יזבחו עוד זבחיהם לשעירים אשר הם זונים אחריהם\". וגבי מולך כתיב (שם כ, ה) \"והכרתי אותו ואת כל הזונים אחריו\". וכן (במדבר טו, לט) \"לא תתורו אחרי לבבכם ואחרי עיניכם אשר אתם זונים אחריהם\". ובא לומר כי עכשיו שבא להשחית את ביתו הקדוש, נתחבר לזונה לגמרי, הוא העבודה זרה. </p>\n  \n  <p>And that which is says that he seized a prostitute and entered the Temple, the explanation is that...he clung to foreign Gods. And this is refereed to as \"seizing the prostitute\", for idolatry is compared to a prostitute, for the term <em>zenut</em> is always used in the context of idolatry. E.g. Leviticus (17:7, 20:5), and Numbers (15:29). It is saying that now [after his initial relationship with idolatry], he had become completely fused to the idolatry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

On Shabbos, one who is in a state of choleh kol gufo (debilitating illness) or even tza'ar godol (severe pain) may do rabbinically-restricted melochos with a shinui for his comfort (source: Ribiat, The 39 Melochos, pp. 491-493). Also, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"A pregnant woman is permitted to take any medications, vitamins, or\n  therapies to avoid any risk to her health or that of her baby. One may\n  violate any melocho to save the life of a fetus, (even in the earliest\n  stages of pregnancy)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ribiat 499. </p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/32339946/Untitled\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> document (and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/93941/1516\">this</a>), it is universally accepted that a choleh she'ain bo sakanah, including most pregnant women, must a priori fast on Tisha b'Av. In short:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even if one is ill, he must still observe the fast of Tisha B'Av to\n  whatever extent possible.He may not eat more than what is necessary.\n  [This is the basis of R. Schick's opinion.] Furthermore, he must still\n  observe the other inuyim. As such, he is still considered someone who\n  is fasting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So basically I am asking, if even rabbinical matters surrounding Shabbos can be transgressed (with a shinui) for a choleh, then why can't the rabbinical enactment of fasting on tisha b'Av--to say nothing of the other rabbinical enactments for that day--be readily transgressed for a choleh? I understand one difference is the shinui, but is that all? If not, why did the rabbis allow more leniency for Shabbos (and, it would seem, most other mitzvos) than for Tisha b'Av? </p>\n\n\n",

How are the two things reconciled?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The idea is that if someone died or was killed <strong>before fulfilling his messianic mission</strong>, such as was the case by Bar Kochba, who was thought to be the mashiach until this happened, then he is at most like any other righteous king of Israel, but not the mashiach. This is spelled out in the Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e511.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim, Chapter 11</a>, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ח  ואם יעמוד מלך מבית דויד הוגה בתורה ועוסק במצוות כדויד אביו, כפי תורה שבכתב ושבעל פה, ויכוף כל ישראל לילך בה ולחזק בדקה, ויילחם מלחמות ה'--הרי זה בחזקת שהוא משיח:  אם עשה והצליח, וניצח כל האומות שסביביו, ובנה מקדש במקומו, וקיבץ נדחי ישראל--הרי זה משיח בוודאי.</p>\n<p>ט  ואם לא הצליח עד כה, או נהרג--בידוע שאינו זה שהבטיחה עליו תורה, והרי הוא ככל מלכי בית דויד השלמים הכשרים שמתו.  ולא העמידו הקדוש ברוך הוא אלא לנסות בו רבים, שנאמר \"ומן המשכילים ייכשלו, לצרוף בהן ולברר וללבן--עד עת קץ:  כי עוד, למועד\" (ראה דנייאל יא,לה).</p>\n<p>י  אף ישוע הנוצרי שדימה שיהיה משיח, ונהרג בבית דין--כבר נתנבא בו דנייאל, שנאמר \"ובני פריצי עמך, יינשאו להעמיד חזון--ונכשלו\" (דנייאל יא,יד).  וכי יש מכשול גדול מזה:  שכל הנביאים דיברו שהמשיח גואל ישראל ומושיעם, ומקבץ נדחיהם ומחזק מצוותן; וזה גרם לאבד ישראל בחרב, ולפזר שאריתם ולהשפילם, ולהחליף התורה, ולהטעות רוב העולם לעבוד אלוה מבלעדי ה'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or, in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188356/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-11.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">English</a>, courtesy of Chabad:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently contemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law as David, his ancestor, will compel all of Israel to walk in (the way of the Torah) and rectify the breaches in its observance, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance, consider him Mashiach.</p>\n<p>If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and gathers the dispersed of Israel, he is definitely the Mashiach.</p>\n<p>He will then improve the entire world, motivating all the nations to serve God together, as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: 'I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.'</p>\n<p><strong>If he did not succeed to this degree or was killed</strong>, he surely is not the redeemer promised by the Torah. Rather, he should be considered as all the other proper and complete kings of the Davidic dynasty who died. God caused him to arise only to test the many, as Daniel 11:35 states: 'And some of the wise men will stumble, to try them, to refine, and to clarify until the appointed time, because the set time is in the future.'</p>\n<p>Jesus of Nazareth who aspired to be the Mashiach and was executed by the court was also alluded to in Daniel's prophecies, as ibid. 11:14 states: 'The vulgar among your people shall exalt themselves in an attempt to fulfill the vision, but they shall stumble.'</p>\n<p>Can there be a greater stumbling block than Christianity? All the prophets spoke of Mashiach as the redeemer of Israel and their savior who would gather their dispersed and strengthen their observance of the mitzvot. In contrast, Christianity caused the Jews to be slain by the sword, their remnants to be scattered and humbled, the Torah to be altered, and the majority of the world to err and serve a god other than the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to Rambam in pirush hamishnayos to Sanhedrin, Moshiach will die <em>after</em> he fulfills his job. See the first source <a href=\"http://www.judaismsanswer.com/dyingmessiah.htm#_ftn1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The main benefit of that time (the Messianic Age) will be that they (Israel) shall have rest from the subjugation of the nations who have prevented us from performing the commandments. Wisdom will be increased as it says “The world shall be filled with knowledge (of HaShem as the water fills the ocean)” (Isaiah 11:9) Wars will cease as it says, “And nation will not lift up sword against other nations.” (Isaiah 2:4) There will be in those days great perfection and we shall merit the life of the world to come. The Messiah will then die and his son will rule in his place and so his grandson.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Henna use, both for everyday adornment and for ritual purposes,\n  quickly spread throughout the Diaspora and was an established custom\n  among the Jews of Morocco and other North African communities, the\n  Levant and Mediterranean basin, the Arabian Peninsula, and Western,\n  Central and Southern Asia.</p>\n  \n  <p>In these communities, henna was a crucial aspect of the preparations\n  for a Jewish wedding, and often defined the structure of the wedding\n  festivities, from the beginning (marked by the sending of henna from\n  the groom to the bride) through the climax (the main henna ceremony\n  itself) to the end (when the last remnants of henna wore off the\n  skin). Furthermore, henna was used to mark the actors in a variety of\n  other lifecycle events and passage rituals, such as birth, weaning,\n  entering the school system, puberty, and coming out of mourning. It\n  was also used at holiday celebrations and other happy occasions. The\n  symbolism of henna in these Jewish communities was highly polysemous,\n  but it is clear that it had three overarching functions: first, the\n  henna’s staining of skin was seen as beautifying, both as daily\n  adornment and for weddings; second, the materiality of henna was\n  thought as protective, especially of actors at the center of a passage\n  ritual; third, henna was seen as an aid in transforming and guiding\n  the actors into the structure of their new social roles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of my friend's daughters had a henna ceremony last year. Unfortunately, because I was in mourning, then, I couldn't attend, but I would have been curious to see what this was. I guess there must be some video on YouTube or some other web site.</p>\n\n\n",

The proof is that the Gemara asks what the Mishnah meant by \"distinguish between techeiles and lavan\", and rejects the possibility that it is referring to the ability to distinguish between a clump of blue wool and a clump of white wool, because that can be done even at night. The Gemara then concludes that it refers to the ability to distinguish between the techeiles and lavan in the tzitzis (as per Tosafos based on the Gemara in Menachos, and the Yerushalmi Berachos, both cited by the Radzyner Rebbe). The Radzyner Rebbe argues that the Rambam's view is the only one that gets around the issue brought up by the Gemara, of being able to distinguish even at night. He says that as long as the techeiles and lavan are separate they can be distinguished even at night. It is only according to the Rambam where there is a point on one string where it goes from techeiles to lavan that one would not be able to distinguish it until morning, because due to the impossibility of perfection in dyeing, the techeiles and lavan are almost overlapping at that point. The zeman for Kerias Shema is when you can distinguish between the techeiles and lavan at the point where it switches.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41254&st=&pgnum=100\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (last paragraph).</p>\n\n\n",

Yaakov Ariel discusses this at length in his <a href=\"https://www.toraland.org.il/22803\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">באהלה של תורה חלק ה סימן א.</a> He concludes that this issur would not pertain to a mosque:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עיי\"ש שהביא מתשובת ר' יצחק אלחנן, שמותר ליהודי להתפלל במסגד, כי אינו\nבית ע\"ז, וכבר נהגו יהודי חברון להתפלל במערת המכפלה במקום המסגד. אולם\nגם לדעתו מסתבר שאין למסגד קדושת מקום תפילה, ועל אחת כמה וכמה שאין לו\nמעמד של ביכנ\"ס, שהרי לא ייתכן שהתורה תתן מעמד של קדושה למבנה הקורא תגר\nעל התורה. אמנם עובדים בו את אותו הא-ל שאנו עובדים לו, אולם מתוך כפירה\nבתורת משה, ותורת משה היא האומרת \"לא תעשון כן\".</p>\n<p>לכן <strong>נראה למסקנה, שמבנה שנבנה ע\"י מי שאינו מכיר במשה ובתורתו שניתנה לו\nבסיני אין לו שום מעמד הלכתי, ואינו בכלל \"בתי הא-ל יתעלה\" שהזכיר\nהרמב\"ם</strong>. ומכל שכן לדעת הר\"ן וסיעתו, הסוברים שכל קדושת בית כנסת אינה אלא\nמדרבנן, סביר להניח שרבנן לא החילו קדושה על בית תפילה שאינו מכיר בהם\nובמשנתם....יתרה מזו: <strong>יתכן אפילו שיש איסור בהריסת מסגד, מאחר שדינו כדין כל מקום המשמש לעבודת הא-ל. ואין הבדל בין אם העובדים בו ישראלים או נוכרים, שהרי גם מהם מצפה ה' שיעבדוהו</strong>.\nלהנחתנו האחרונה, שייתכן שמסגד נחשב כבית עבודת הא-ל, יש השלכות לדיוננו.\nכי אם נקבל הנחה זו, נמצא שאין היתר להרוס מסגד, וממילא אין הצדקה להרוס\nביכנ\"ס בידים על מנת למנוע את הפיכתו למסגד, שהרי גם למסגד יש מעין\n\"קדושה\" כביכול. אך אם נניח שמסגד אינו מקום הראוי לעבודת הא-ל, יש היתר\nלהורסו, וממילא יש הצדקה להרוס ביכנ\"ס על מנת למנוע את חילולו בהפיכתו\nלמסגד, שהרי אין בו שום קדושה, וכל קיומו הוא רק בבחינת הרמת יד כנגד\nהקדושה האמיתית. ואולי יש להביא ראיה לאסור הריסת מסגדים ממה שמצאנו\nבענין הבמות שבימי מלכי יהודה. במות אלו נבנו לשם שמים קודם בניית המקדש;\nואף שנאסרו אחר כך בעבודה, נמנעו המלכים מלהרסם. רק חזקיהו המלך, שכיתת\nאפילו את נחש הנחושת שעשה משה משום שטעו אחריו, הרס גם את הבמות. ומכאן\nיש ללמוד שיש איסור בהריסת מקום שהתייחד לעבודת ה', גם אם העבודה שבו\nסותרת את תורת משה ואת בחירת המקדש, ובלבד שאין בה סממנים של עבודה\nזרה.</p>\n<p>וכן משמע מרש\"י (מל\"א יט,י), שיש איסור בנתיצת הבמות, שמפרש את תלונת\nאליהו על ישראל: \"כי עזבו בריתך בני ישראל, את מזבחותיך הרסו\" – שהכוונה\nהיא להריסת המזבחות ששימשו כבמות היחיד. גם מזבח ה' ההרוס בהר הכרמל שימש\nבמה בעבר, עיי\"ש רש\"י ורד\"ק. מכאן משמע שכל מבנה המשמש לעבודת הא-ל, גם\nאם לא נבנה עפ\"י ההלכה, ואף בניגוד לה, חלה עליו קדושה ואסור להורסו.\nואולי מכאן למד הרמב\"ם בקל וחומר, שלא רק מקדש אסור בנתיצה, אלא כל מבנה\nהמשמש לעבודת ה'. וא\"כ לכאורה יש מקום לומר, שגם מסגד המשמש לעבודת הא-ל\nאסור בנתיצה.</p>\n<p>אולם בשו\"ת חתם-סופר (או\"ח סי' לב) מחלק בין הבמות המוזכרות בספר מלכים –\nשאסור לנתצן כיון שהן נבנו בהיתר קודם שעת איסור הבמות, ולכן בקדושתן הן\nעומדות – לבין במות שנבנו באיסור ואין בהן שום קדושה, ועל כן אין בהן\nאיסור נתיצה. ואע\"פ שהיתה סיבה לנתוץ גם את הבמות שנבנו בהיתר, כשם שעשה\nמאוחר יותר חזקיהו המלך, מכל מקום יש ללמוד מכאן שנתיצה לשם מניעת מכשול\nאסורה, מצד עצמה, ורק בהוראת שעה הותרה....</p>\n<p>ועדיין צ\"ע מהו גדר מסגד. אם יוגדר כמקום עבודת הא-ל, אכן אין הפגם גדול\nכל כך בהפיכת ביכנ\"ס למסגד; אולם אם מסגד אינו בכלל הגדרה זו, נמצא שיש\nבהפיכת ביכנ\"ס למסגד בעיה חמורה, שכדי למונעה אולי יש לשקול אפילו את\nהריסת בתי הכנסת בידים.</p>\n<p>יש לדון בכך גם מצד מעשה ההקדשה – האם ייחודו של מקום למסגד מגדיר אותו\nכ\"בית תפילה\" וכמקום קדוש מבחינה הלכתית? אמנם מצאנו שגוי יכול להקדיש\nנכס לגבוה, אולם זו גופא השאלה – האם ייחודו של מקום לבית תפילה מוסלמי\nנחשב להקדש? ...</p>\n<p>אך <strong>לאחר העיון נראה להכריע שמסגד אינו נחשב בית תפילה, ואין בו שום\nקדושה.</strong> לא מבעיא לדעת הרמב\"ן והר\"ן שהבאנו לעיל (פרק ב) – שקדושת\nביכנ\"ס אינה אלא מדרבנן, ויש להניח שרבנן החילו קדושה רק על ביכנ\"ס הנוהג\nעפ\"י ההלכה, ולא על בית תפילה אחר שאינו מכיר בהם ובמשנתם – אך גם לדעת\nהרמב\"ם, הסובר שכל מקום שבו עובדים לא-ל קדוש מהתורה, מסתבר שמסגד אע\"פ\nשעובדים בו לא-ל אחד לא התקדש. משום שעבודת הא-ל שאליה מתכוון הרמב\"ם היא\nרק עבודה שנצטוינו עליה מהתורה, אך פולחן זר שאינו מהתורה, ואף מנוגד\nלתורה, אינו בית עבודת הא-ל מהתורה. שהרי הם פולחים למכה, ולא אל המקום\nאשר בחר ה', ודבר זה סותר את סדר העבודה שקבעה התורה לדרוש רק אל המקום\nאשר יבחר ה'. ולאחר שנבחר המקום, כל סגידה למקום אחר דינה כדין במות בשעת\nאיסורן. וזוהי כנראה כוונת שלמה בתפילתו עם חנוכת המקדש (מל\"א ח, מא):\n\"וגם אל הנכרי אשר לא מעמך ישראל הוא ובא מארץ רחוקה למען שמך... ובא\nוהתפלל אל הבית הזה ... למען ידעון כל עמי הארץ... כי שמך נקרא על הבית\nהזה אשר בניתי.\" וכן בישעיה (נו, ו): \"כי ביתי בית תפילה יקרא לכל העמים\"\n– דוק: ביתי ולא ביתם. ובמקום אחר הדגיש (שם ב, ג): \"כי מציון תצא תורה\nודבר ה' מירושלים\", ולא ממכה וממדינה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar discussion is found regarding a mizbe'ach built by non-Jews. R. Zylberstein (Chashukei Chemed, Gittin 45b) records that R. Shlomo Kluger is unsure about this. Another source is the Yerushalmi (Megillah 1:11) in which Rebbi told Antoninus that he could build a mizbe'ach but must place the stones in genizah (according to the printed girsa). The Korban Ha'edah explains that genizah is necessary since it was built leshem Shamayim. However, R. Zylberstein notes that this may mean that it is permitted to take it apart, provided that one is גונז the stones:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומעתה יש לדון ולשאול, מה הדין לאחר שהנכרי בנה את הבמה והקריב עליה קרבן, האם מותר לנתץ את הבמה, או אסור כמו שאסור לנתץ מזבח שבנאו ישראל, שנאמר 'לא תעשו כן לה' אלוקיכם', או שמא איסור זה נאמר רק במזבח שהוקדש על ידי ישראל, ולא במזבח שהוקדש על ידי נכרי, עבור קרבנות של נכרי.\nויעוין בשו\"ת טוב טעם ודעת (מהדורה רביעאה בהשמטות לסימן רנט, עמ' תשסט בנדמ\"ח) שכתב חכם אחד רצה להביא ראיה לנידון זה מהמבואר במסכת זבחים (דף קטז ע\"ב) שכמו שמזבח של ישראל אסור לבנותה מדבר שנשתמש בו הדיוט, הוא הדין בבמה של נכרי בזמן הזה, אסור לבנותה מדבר שנשתמש בו הדיוט, הרי שדיני המזבח ובמת נכרי, שווים בדינם למזבח ישראל. וכתב עליו הגאון רבי שלמה קלוגר, שאין משם ראיה, מכיון שדוקא לגבי בניית הבמה שהמטרה היא להקריב קרבן לשמים, צריך שיהיה כולו קודש לשמים, וזהו סברא פשוטה שבזה דיני במת נכרי שוה למזבח של ישראל. אבל לגבי נתיצה, שאף בישראל לא היה איסור נתיצה לאחר שכבר הקריבו עליה את הקרבנות, לולי הפסוק, אם כן יתכן שבנכרי אין פסוק, ואין איסור לנתצה לאחר שהקריבו עליה את הקרבן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד כתב הגר\"ש קלוגר (שם סימן רנט עמ' תקכח בנדמ\"ח) שלכאורה יש להביא ראיה לנידון זה מהנאמר במסכת גיטין דף מה ע\"ב אמר רב נחמן, נקטינן: ספר תורה שכתבו מין ישרף, כתבו עובד כוכבים יגנז... נמצא ביד עובד כוכבים אמרי לה יגנז, ואמרי לה קורין בו. ספר תורה שכתבו עובד כוכבים, תני חדא ישרף, ותניא אידך יגנז, ותניא אידך: קורין בו, יעו\"ש. ופרש\"י שכתבו גוי יגנז, כי חיישינן שמא כתבו הגוי לשם שמים. הרי לפנינו שכשגוי מקדיש, הקדשו הקדש, וכוונתו כוונה. ואם כן אף כשבנה במה לשם שמים, חל עליה קדושה, ואסור לנתצה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא שהוסיף הגר\"ש קלוגר שיתכן שאף בבמה של ישראל בזמן היתר הבמות, אין איסור נתיצה, שיתכן שכל האיסור הוא במזבח בבית המקדש, כשהוא בצורתו ובתבניתו, משא\"כ בבמה שעל זה אין פסוק, אולי אין איסור נתיצה.\nוהנה יש להעיר על דברי הטוב טעם ודעת, ממה שציין הרוגצ'אבר בספר מכתבי תורה (מכתב קלח) לדברי הירושלמי במסכת מגילה (פ\"א הי\"א) אנטונינוס שאל לר' מהו לבנות מזבח א\"ל בניהו וגנוז אבניו, ופירש קרבן העדה: דכיון שהוקדשו לשמים אסור להשתמש בהם בהדיוט, עכ\"ל. מבואר בירושלמי שמותר לסתור את הבמה, אלא שצריך לגנוז את אבניה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

According to Menachem ibn Seruk (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.16?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cited by Rashi</a>) and the  Ibn Ezra on Shemos 13:16, totafos means remembrance. Rashi explains that you'll see the head tefillin, talk about it, and remember the miracles of Egypt. This wouldn't apply to the arm tefillin, which are <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8350/why-does-the-tefilin-shel-yad-have-a-protective-cover\">supposed to be covered</a>. As well, according to the other explanation that Rashi brings, that totafos refers to the four parshiyos, this could apply more to the head tefillin which have four compartments. (Although you could then ask why only the head tefillin have four compartments, but that's probably too tangential to be a relevant question)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In R' <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>'s commentary on Shemot 13:9, he distinguishes the functions of the two <em>tefillin</em> as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>לְאוֹת עַל יָדְךָ - \"a guide for all your acts\"</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>לְזִכָּרוֹן בֵּין עֵינֶיךָ - \"the basis of all your thoughts\"</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <em>tefillin</em> serve as physical tokens of, respectively, our dedication of our actions (hand) and our thoughts (head) to God. In turn, the actions we take, themselves, demonstrate (\"sign\") our dedication to God, while our thoughts are our medium for considering God's, as R' Hirsch puts it in his commentary on Devarim 6:8, \"theoretical truths and teachings\" (\"reminder\").</p>\n<p>He points out that the first phrase echoes what God had commanded a bit earlier, in Shemot 12:13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְהָיָה֩ הַדָּ֨ם לָכֶ֜ם לְאֹ֗ת עַ֤ל הַבָּתִּים֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אַתֶּ֣ם שָׁ֔ם</strong> וְרָאִ֙יתִי֙ אֶת־הַדָּ֔ם וּפָסַחְתִּ֖י עֲלֵכֶ֑ם וְלֹֽא־יִֽהְיֶ֨ה בָכֶ֥ם נֶ֙גֶף֙ לְמַשְׁחִ֔ית בְּהַכֹּתִ֖י בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃</p>\n<p><strong>And the blood on the houses where you are staying shall be a sign for you</strong>: when I see the blood I will pass over you, so that no plague will destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just as the blood was a physical demonstration of our dedication of our homes to God and His mission, so are the hand-<em>tefillin</em>, and all of the Commandment-fulfilling actions we take with those hands, physical demonstrations of our dedication of our actions. In Egypt, we submitted to God's \"hand\" to enact our salvation; now, we have to dedicate the agency we gained thanks to God's actions to His service.</p>\n<p>Of course, there's a lot more on related themes, connecting to many aspects of the rules of <em>tefillin</em>, in those two comments, especially the one on  Devarim 6:8. I recommend reading them in full.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>We read in Shmoth 33.6 \"And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.\" And in Shabbat 57b: \"Rather, Rav Yehuda said in the name of Abaye: A totefet is an <em>appuzainu</em>, an ornament worn on the forehead.\" </p>\n\n<p>When we say a Bracha over the Hand tefillin we say it with the intention that the Bracha covers the Head tefillin as well. It is explained that the single bracha covers both because, it says, \"bind <strong><em>them</em></strong> for a sign upon your arm and let <strong><em>them</em></strong> be for a remembrance between your eyes;\" and <strong><em>them</em></strong> is written in the plural -</p>\n\n<p>See also Ibn Ezra to <em>Shmoth</em> 13.9 citing <em>Koheleth</em> (Proverbs) 1.9, 3.3, 6.9</p>\n\n<p>How can the Shel Rosh (head tefillin) serve as a sign <strong><em>if we do not discuss the Torah when we see it</em></strong>? The passuk says, \"and as a reminder on your forehead—in order that the Teaching of the L-RD may be in your mouth\" <em>Shmoth</em> 13.9</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, if seeing the Shel Rosh initiates discussion of the Exodus, (as Ibn Ezra elaborates) then the head tefillin serves as a <em>sign</em> right along with the hand (arm) tefillin - The Torah stipulates that they are to be worn together, \"in order that the Teaching of the L-RD may be in your mouth\" <em>Shmoth</em> 13.9</p>\n\n<p>I understand the <em>mitzvah</em> as: \"and it shall be for a reminder between your eyes [and my eyes,\"] that is, when each person sees the <em>totafoth (shel rosh)</em> on the head of a fellow Jew it shall serve as a reminder to discuss the Exodus; for \"with a strong Hand, HaShem took you out of <em>Mitzrayim</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>Shmoth</em> 13.8 stipulates that during the Pesach season we are to discuss the Exodus: \"<em>And thou shalt tell thy son in that day</em>, saying: It is because of that which the L-RD did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, <em>Shmoth</em> 13.9 is teaching us that <em>seeing</em> the Shel Rosh serves to initiate discussion of Pesach and the Exodus; something the shel yad cannot do once it is placed opposite the heart! </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did Moshe say that he had punished Miriam?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>A woman I don't know posed the following question to me while getting a quick ride to her car: It seems that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.1.1?lang=bi&p2=Sifrei_Devarim.1.15&lang2=bi&p3=Sifrei_Devarim.1.15&lang3=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi and Sifrei on Devarim 1:1</a> say that Moshe said that he himself had punished Miriam. Is this really what the Midrash and Rashi mean? If so, what are we supposed to learn from that?</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.1.1?lang=bi&p2=Sifrei_Devarim.1.15&lang2=bi&p3=Sifrei_Devarim.1.15&lang3=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">first verse</a> of the book of Devarim introduces Moshe's final great speech with a long list of geographical references:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵ֣לֶּה הַדְּבָרִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבֶּ֤ר מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶל־כָּל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּעֵ֖בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֑ן בַּמִּדְבָּ֡ר בָּֽעֲרָבָה֩ מ֨וֹל ס֜וּף בֵּֽין־פָּארָ֧ן וּבֵֽין־תֹּ֛פֶל וְלָבָ֥ן וַחֲצֵרֹ֖ת וְדִ֥י זָהָֽב׃</p>\n<p>These are the words that Moses addressed to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan.—Through the wilderness, in the Arabah near Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi</a>, channeling various <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Midrashic</a> teachings, explains that each of these references was actually a veiled criticism of the Israelites. Regarding \"Hazeroth,\" Rashi provides two interpretations, one of which is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר לָהֶם הָיָה לָכֶם לִלְמוֹד מִמַּה שֶּׁעָשִׂיתִי לְמִרְיָם בַּחֲצֵרוֹת בִּשְׁבִיל לָשׁוֹן הָרָע, וְאַתֶּם נִדְבַּרְתֶּם בַּמָּקוֹם:‏</p>\n<p>He said to them, “You ought to have taken a lesson from what I did to Miriam at Hazeroth because of the slander she uttered, and yet you even after that spoke against the Omnipresent.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This interpretation is apparently based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifre#Sifre_to_Deuteronomy\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sifrei Devarim</a> 1:15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר להם: לא היה לכם ללמוד ממה שעשיתי למרים בחצרות? אם למרים הצדקת לא נשאתי לה פנים בדין - ק\"ו לשאר בני אדם.‏</p>\n<p>He said to them: Should you not have learned from what I did to Miriam in Chatzeroth? If I did not show favoritism in judgment to Miriam the righteous, how much more so (would I not do so) to others!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The incident in question, located in Hazeroth per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.11.35?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bamidbar 11:35</a>, is recounted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.12.1-16?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bamidbar 12</a>: After slandering Moshe in conversation with Aharon, Miriam was stricken with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzaraath\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>tzara'at</em></a> and banished from the Israelite camp for seven days.</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty</strong></p>\n<p>In both Rashi's and Sifrei's renditions of this interpretation, it sounds like Moshe was ascribing the punishment of Miriam to himself. They both say \"what I did to Miriam,\" and the speaker here seems very clearly to be Moshe. After all, the text being interpreted begins \"These are the words that Moses addressed ....\" This is surprising, since Miriam's primary punishment, <em>tzara'at</em>, was pretty clearly visited upon her by God, as it appeared just as His presence departed after He rebuked her and Aharon. The first and only action Moshe apparently takes in this episode is to pray for Miriam to be healed.</p>\n<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Did Sifrei and Rashi really mean to say that Moshe was saying that he had punished Miriam himself?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If not, why does it sound that way?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If so, what are Sifrei and Rashi trying to teach us with this surprising ascription?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As is clear from, e.g., the preceding passage in the Sifrei, on the preceding words in the verse, the Person speaking in the Medrash is G-d:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שוטים! כל עצמם של מלכים אין בוררים להם אלא לחם קל, שלא יהא דולריא אוחזתו; אבל אותה טובה שהיטבתי לכם - בה אתם מתוכחים ומתרעמים לפני? הוי כטובה שהיטבתי לאדם הראשון, שאמרתי לו (בראשית ב) אעשה לו עזר כנגדו, בטובה שהיטבתי לו - בה מתרעם לפני: (בראשית ג) ויאמר האדם האשה אשר נתת עמדי היא נתנה לי מן העץ ואוכל:</p>\n<p>\"Fools, the very essence of kings is that they are fed only 'light' bread, so they not be seized with diarrhea — but you have grumbled at the good that I have given you, following the precedent of your father (Adam). I told him that I would make a helpmate for him (Bereshith 2:18), and for this good that I granted him he grumbled against Me, (Ibid. 3:12) 'The woman that You gave to me — she gave me from the tree and I ate.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the idea is that the rebuke Moshe gave was on behalf of and/or at the behest of G-d.  Similarly, we find throughout Tanach that prophets and angels speak in the first person on behalf of G-d.</p>\n<p>While the language of the following verses are presented by Moshe as Moshe talking, the medrash is expounding the first verse which is actually in the 3rd person about Moshe.  Thus it represents more directly the final directive of G-d  to Moshe of how to transcribe his speech for the generations as part of the Torah.  So perhaps that is why the rebuke is presented as directly from G-d.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, assuming the <em>peshat</em> (simple meaning of the verse) is also literally true that Moshe's speech was made relative to the listed places that happened to be so historically named, that would be a coincidence that is more reasonably ascribed directly to divine providence than to Moses.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The <em>I</em> referred to here is that Moshe is saying to Bnai Yisrael that Hashem was referring to the lesson that they should have learned from what He did to Miriam and it was what Hashem was telling them as shown by the hint of the name.</p>\n\n\n",

In light of that, why don't we just make the havdalah brachah and say the other Brachos at some other point during the night? Is it just for convenience, that since we're sitting down to do this mitzvah, we might as well do the others also, or is there some deeper reason that they should be done together?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Aish link you brought is very good in setting the tone for what you know and want to find out, so thank  you.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to borei moreih ha'esh, the Gemara brings the idea of waiting to say the bracha contrary to saying it right away just as a minhag, not too much reasoning there (see Pesachim 54a, R' Yehuda holds and R' Yochanan says halacha is like him-R' Yochanan usually the authoritative Tanna as far as psak from Gemara goes and we see that follow through for Rambam Hil Shabbas 29:24 and Tur Shulchan Aruch 296:1) </p>\n\n<p>In Shulchan Aruch, the Rema notes the minhag of pouring the wine first as a sign of a bracha (for the week) and specifically over the meorei haesh-- no reasoning.) The first reasoning that I found was is in the same siman of the Shulchan Aruch HaRav (Seif 5) quoting the Levush (271:10) that pouring the wine to put out the candle signifies the candle's use specifically for the mitzvah of havdalah and brings in the name of the Rema (mentioned earlier) that we rub our eyes with the wine to signify our enjoyment of and love for the mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p>Seemingly this wouldn't be an opportunity without the candle for the wine but my Rosh yeshiva said this wasn't the reason, just the way the minhag is fulfilled through the meorei ha'esh and bsamim being a part of Havdalah. He further mentioned that it's logical (and potentially why it's hard to find mefarshim say so explicitly) that in general, saying something over wine in Yiddishkite signifies an importance ceremonial emphasis of kedusha as we see it used for kiddush/Havdalah for Shabbas and festivals, kidushin of the chupah, Birkas hamazon with a zimun. It in a sense anchors down the mitzvah in a mehudar way so how much more so when you anchor the two other related brachos related to Motzei Shabbas. </p>\n\n<p>Fun practical minhag some have as an outcome of saying all three brachos together is the ability to light the candles required for melaveh malka (as in Kittzur Shulchan Aruch 96:12) with the Havdalah torch before putting it out with wine. Hopes this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How many descendants did Abraham give rise to?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Genesis 22 there is a divine oath that seems to suggest that Abraham's descendants will be way more numerous than has yet been realize:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Berean Study Bible Genesis 22: 16 and said, \"By Myself I have sworn,\n  declares the LORD, because you have done this thing and have not\n  withheld your son, your only son, 17 indeed I will greatly bless you,\n  and <strong>I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens\n  and as the sand which is on the seashore</strong>; and your seed shall\n  possess the gate of their enemies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A very literal reading would put that number as 10 to the 22nd power  (which is the current scientific estimate for both the number of stars in the visible universe and, coincidentally, of the sands of the seashore, according to:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/2-UuWx8zCYw?t=2m30s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/2-UuWx8zCYw?t=2m30s</a></p>\n\n<p>Just how numerous are the descendants so far  in total since the oath?</p>\n\n<p>And a related question would be whether or not there is any Rabbinic discussion as to whether or not there will be an end to the increase of the number of Jews. In other words, does the oath suggest that the People will continue to multiply forever?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First of all this refers to the descendants of Yitzchak, not the other children of Avraham because as it says in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8216#v=12&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayera 21:12</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֗ם אַל־יֵרַ֤ע בְּעֵינֶ֨יךָ֙\n  עַל־הַנַּ֣עַר וְעַל־אֲמָתֶ֔ךָ כֹּל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר תֹּאמַ֥ר אֵלֶ֛יךָ שָׂרָ֖ה\n  שְׁמַ֣ע בְּקֹלָ֑הּ כִּ֣י <strong>בְיִצְחָ֔ק</strong> יִקָּרֵ֥א לְךָ֖ זָֽרַע:</p>\n  \n  <p>And God said to Abraham, \"Be not displeased concerning the lad and\n  concerning your handmaid; whatever Sarah tells you, hearken to her\n  voice, for <strong>in Isaac will be called your seed</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Secondly, as the meforshim point out, this is a figurative statement which means that the Bnai Yisrael will be existing <em>forever</em> just like the stars and the sand. As the Art Scroll Chumash cites on 22:17</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Israel complies with Hashem's will, they resemble the stars of\n  heaven; then no one can dominate them. But when they flout his will,\n  they resemble the sand of the seashore - trampeled by every tyrannical\n  foot. (<em>Midrash Or HaAfelah</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another point is that the stars and sand are not countable, <strong>not</strong> because of the numbers but because they are seen as a group and the individual members of that group cannot be completely identified. It is as a group that the significance shows (like the entire sea shore) even though there are individuals who show up (like the brightest stars). Consider a group of stars which is visible to the naked eye but as more and more attention is given with higher powered telescopes more and more detail can be discovered.</p>\n\n<p>Note that <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16368#v=4&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 147:4</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Means that Hashem (alone) is capable of knowing and understanding each individual element in the Universe that He created as well as maintaining everything in its correct relationship with everything else. This too can be an analogy with Bnai Yisrael, being <em>as the stars in the heaven</em>. Only Hashem understands and Knows each individual person as well as the group that those individuals make up.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The answer was already addressed by @sabbahillel.  I would like to point out though that scientists use the term 'visible' universe to not mean 'what you can see with your naked eye'.  Scientists use this term to describe the universe in terms of the speed of light - i.e. the maximum physical limits light can travel.</p>\n<p>The term visible thus is misleading.  It does not at all refer to stars you can 'see' with your naked eye, but rather the whole gamut of the universe as far as light can travel.</p>\n<p>Wikipedia notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The observable universe is a spherical region of the Universe comprising all matter that can be observed from Earth at the present time, because electromagnetic radiation from these objects has had time to reach Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Assuming the Universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.</p>\n<p>The word observable in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect light or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the speed of light itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the age of the Universe (estimated as of 2015 around 13.799±0.021 billion years) simply cannot be detected, as they have not reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the visible universe, which includes only signals emitted since recombination—and the observable universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the Big Bang in traditional physical cosmology, the end of the inflationary epoch in modern cosmology).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In any event, the Torah tells us that Hashem told Avrohom Avinu to look up at the stars and to <em>theoretically</em> count them. The commentators (includ. Rashi) explain that Avrohom Avinu was told to look at his astrology charts to show him that Avrohom Avinu and his family would be above the stars, i.e. they would not be governed by the natural order of the world, but be able to break beyond that.)</p>\n<p>On a very simple level then, Avrohom Avinu would have seen approximately 6000 stars give or take a few hundred, depending on his location and visibility (<a href=\"https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-many-stars-night-sky-09172014/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see Sky and Telescope</a>).</p>\n<p>So while it is a nice thought that the number of stars is 10^22, it doesn't seem to me that this figure was part of the equation. Avrohom Avinu did not have a hubble-space telescope to tell him the number of stars in the observable universe!</p>\n\n\n",

This result which was not what was striven for, but which comes automatically by itself is called\n  עקב, literally <em>heel</em>. It is that which follows obedience, not what went\n  before, not what obedience had in eye. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that this is what Rashi had in mind when he speaks of the  <em>easy</em> mitzvos. It is a matter of treating every mitzva as both the <em>easiest</em> and the <em>most important</em>. Rav Hirsch also points out that evry person will tend to overlook some mitzvos at various times or to think that something seems so <em>trivial</em> that he might as well say <em>Why would Hashem nitpick on such a trivial detail</em>. Everyone might think this because of the way the current society deals with something (so what that might be changes with society).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>we are not to weigh the separate mitzvos in our minds to consider\n  which Mitzva would probably expect a larger reward so that we pay\n  particular attention to that one. The paths of Torah form an ever\n  widening circle in which they overlap each other and lose themselves\n  one in the other. We cannot foresee the results of fulfilling any\n  Mitzva. They interlock one to the other, and far reaching results\n  arise from what is apparently the smallest and seems to us the least\n  important Mitzva. That is why all Mitzvos without distinction should\n  be performed with equal conscious faithfulness, all be of equal\n  importance to us, all only to be done in the feeling of its being our\n  duty without giving a though to what we might consider deserving a\n  greater or lesser reward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch adds</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>to give our attention just to that which, according to the changing\n  circumstances of the times, seems to be trivial and petty and tends to\n  be left behind</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Or, does it mean \"script\", implying that G-d used the same \"font style\", but the actually words were different on the 2nd tablets?</p>\n<p>My premise, here:</p>\n<p>The translation of these two words are related. E.g., if the meaning in the 2nd verse is \"writing\" meaning that it was the same words, then the meaning in the 1st verse would probably be \"words\" as well.

It is modified.</p>\n\n<p>So the translation of Devarim 10:4 would read:</p>\n\n<p>\"And it will be written on the tablets, <em>similar to</em> the first writ, the ten decrees which G-d spoke to you all on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the gathering, and (which) G-d gave to me.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can anyone hold that Tza’ar Ba’alei Chaim is d’Rabbanan?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (Bava Metzi’a 32b-33a) discusses the prohibition of tza’ar ba’alei chaim, causing pain to animals, and whether it is from the Torah (d’Oraisa) or from the Rabbis (d’Rabbanan), concluding that it is a dispute amongst the Tannaim - most notably, R’ Yosi HaGlili holds of the latter view. In that discussion, the foremost source for the view that it’s d’Oraisa is the obligation to unload one’s animal (Shemos 23:5), while R’ Yose HaGlili disagrees with that proof on grounds that we’re concerned with the owner’s loss, not the animal’s pain. The succeeding Gemara addresses various sources, but they all have to do with unloading animals. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/84532/9682\">Other commentaries bring other sources for tza’ar ba’alei chaim</a>, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bilam being rebuked for hitting his donkey (Bamidbar 22:32 - Moreh Nevuchim 3:17)</li>\n<li>Not muzzling an oz (Devarim 25:4 - Shitah Mekubetzes, Bava Metzi’a Ibid.)</li>\n<li>Just as HaShem is merciful to all creatures (Tehillim 145:9), so should we (follow in His ways, Devarim 28:9 - Chasam Sofer to Bava Metzi’a Ibid.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We then have three different sources for the prohibition against tza’ar ba’alei chaim. How, then, can R’ Yosi HaGlili possibly hold that it’s not from the Torah? How does he respond to these sources?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup> It is noteworthy that the Sefer HaChinuch (550) uses Tza’ar Ba’alei Chaim as a reason behind the prohibition against plowing with two different animals. However, I did not include that in the question as he begins by quoting the Rambam’s reasoning, that one who plows with them together may come to crossbreed them, itself a prohibition. Presumably R’ Yosi HaGlili would explain similarly. </sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the Samaritan Sabbath Year Concurrent with the Shmita?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Samaritan literature claim they observe a Sabbatical Year, and presumably a cycle of sevens in their calendar.  However it is difficult to find actual years that this was practiced. The only concrete example I can find is when, <strong>in 332 BC</strong>, they petitioned Alexander the Great that they be exempt from tribute, owing to it being their sabbath year. (Josephus Ant. 11.8.6, cf. 9.14.3).</p>\n\n<p>As for modern times, I cannot find a record stating which year is a Sabbath and which isn't. The most recent Jewish Sabbath was 5775 AM (Sept 2014 - Sept 2015) but my question, is the <strong>Samaritan Sabbath Year</strong> concurrent with the Shmita?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Jewish Encyclopedia explains that the difference in the calculations is based on an argument as to when the first year of the first cycle began when the Bnai Yisrael entered the land under Yehoshua. It should also be noted that the calculation also depends on how the Yovel (Jubilee) year enters into the calculation. Is the fiftieth year a separate year so that the first year of the next Shmittah cycle is year 51 or is the first year of the next shmittah cycle the yovel year as well (year 50). Note that the citation below says that 850 years was an even 17 cycles so that it is assumed that the Yovel is year 50 and the new cycle starts in year 51. Thus 17*50=850.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud states that the cycle started in the year 2503, while the Samaritans state that the cycle started in 2794 for a difference of 291 years. If the seven year cycle is used this leads to 41 (seven year) cycles and a remainder (difference) of 4 years. If the Yovel cycle is treated as 50 years as below then the difference of 291 years is 5 yovel cycles and 41 years which is 5 shemittah cycles and 6 years. This makes the Samaritan cycle one year off from the Talmudic cycle.</p>\n\n<p>Note that if one uses 49 years and the other 50 years, the result becomes complicated. Additionally, if the calculation after the destruction of the second temple changes from 50 years to 49 years, that could make a difference unless both changed in the same way.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12967-sabbatical-year-and-jubilee#anchor8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmudic and Samaritan Calculation of Jubilees.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The exact year of the shemiṭṭah is in dispute, and different dates are\n  given.

The first cycle commenced after the\n  conquest of the land and its distribution among the tribes, which,\n  occupied fourteen years (which would be 2503), and the last jubilee\n  occurred on the \"tenth\n  day of the month [Tishri], in the fourteenth year after that the city\n  was smitten\" (Ezek. xl. 1), which was the New-Year's Day of the\n  jubilee ('Ab.

It is a little bit over my head, especially since most of the modern day literature (albeit based largely on the Zohar and Kabbalah) seems to hold the \"destruction of seed\" as a horrible crime against G-d (lengthening the exile etc.).</p>\n<p>Is there any basis for this claim (i.e has it been dealt with in other sources)?</p>\n<p>(note: at the bottom of the article in the comments section, I've noticed there are several upset posters that accuse the author of the article of causing the masses to sin, so it sounds like there is some sort of issue with the author's logic)</p>\n<p>(note: this is not asking about the history of masturbation being forbidden, but who falls under the prohibition)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First to explain its structure, it first says that his initial answer to the unmarried person who found himself unable to control his urges was that he was \"forced\" and that the situation is one where he may die if he doesn't do it (!) and thus not liable. I'm leaving that aside because the principle is true, the application is off but that is less black and white. Either way one is not \"forced\" if he just says I'm allowed to do it, so there is little point in dwelling on that. And there is no tradition that failure to have marital relations is potentially deadly, nor do doctors agree. As far as I can tell he just makes that up claiming it is comparable to other cases.</p>\n\n<p>He attributes the position that it isn't an issue for an unmarried person to waste seed to the העזר מקדוש which is a commentary to shulchan aruch by the same author as the אשל אברהם (as this author himself writes). He derives this from the idea that the העזר מקודש holds the prohibition is rabbinic and the permission for interactions with one's wife that may lead to wasted seed. Given how off this Teshuva is I'm not spending the time to verify that this claim is correct (this is a known opinion that is usually attributed to the Drisha and not regarded as the Halacha - you can see Bnei Banim among other places that mention it - I'm just not going to see if the העזר מקודש contradicts it elsewhere and thus can't be said to agree with it), but his derivation is certainly not correct.</p>\n\n<p>The אשל אברהם (the same person) to <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x345\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S.A. O.C. 3:14 s.q. 1</a> says on what the S.A. says that an unmarried person may not touch the Glans when urinating because of the concern of wasting seed, there he specifically speaks to the fact that an unmarried person is stricter than a married one and is strict in the prohibition of rubbing or holding for a married person, in the notion of \"even a married person\" where a married person might have reasons to be lenient. He doesn't come along and argue that there is no problem here because there is no prohibition or anything like that. This is the quote of the אשל אברהם:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נשוי  ובסעיף י״ז[ט\"ז] ז״ל לא  הותר לנשוי לאחוז באמה אלא  להשתין אבל\n  להתחכך לא מעתה אין  הכרע אי מותר לנשוי להתחכך למטה  מעטרה או לוקא\n  להשתין מותר ועיין ב״י  מ״ש בשם סמ״ג שהביא ספיקא של  מהרי״ל ז״ל בזה\n  לענין אחיזה באמה  ע״ש ובת׳ שב יעקב סי׳ ל׳ האריך  למעניתו ופסק לאף\n  לנשוי לא שרי  להתחכך ט אם מעטרה ולמטה ע״י  כתונת לוקא ולפניו אפי׳\n  בכה״ג אסור:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rest of this is of similar quality, including the tenuous claim that marital relationship with a woman past child bearing years is the equivalent of wasting seed (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/44727/whats-the-difference-between-wasting-seed-and-having-marital-relations-without\">here</a>).

In his view, the Amalekite wasn't the son of a convert or even a ger toshav, but an actual 100% Amalekite. What was he doing there? He was a spy. The Amalekites would send off Amalekite youths to collect information in preparation for the many raids the Amalekites did (consider how they first met Yisrael - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.25.17-18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">raiding the people that lagged behind</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.6.3-5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">raids in the time of Gidon</a>, etc). After Plishtim defeated Shaul and Shaul killed himself, the Amalekite joined the Plishtim in pillaging the bodies. It seems he was the first to come upon Shaul's body and took from him his crown and band, and then decided to go to David, hoping for a reward and a chance to collect more info. According to Prof. Elitzur, David quickly discerned all of this. This understanding is based on the fact that first he attempted to present himself as an escapee from the battle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On the third day, a man came from Saul’s camp, with his clothes rent and earth on his head; and as he approached David, he flung himself to the ground and bowed low. David said to him, “Where are you coming from?” He answered, “I have just escaped from the camp of Israel.” “What happened?” asked David. “Tell me!” And he told him how the troops had fled the battlefield, and that, moreover, many of the troops had fallen and died; also that Saul and his son Jonathan were dead.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point, David already knew that the Amalekite was <em>not</em> one of the Israeli soldiers, because he then asked him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"“How do you know,” David asked the young man who brought him the news, “that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This question should have been redundant, because if the Amalekite had looked like a soldier, David should have figured that he had been near the king when he fell (David had no idea at this point exactly <em>how</em> the king had died). However, it seems that the Amalekite's poor disguise (torn clothes and dirt on his head) was not enough; David recognized his clothes as being inherently/culturally Amalekite, so he pressed him to explain what he, a non-Israeli, was doing on the battlefield. And the Amalekite chose to admit that he indeed wasn't a soldier, nor even any sort of Israelite, by saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The young man who brought him the news answered, “I <strong>happened</strong> to be at Mount Gilboa, and I saw Saul leaning on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen closing in on him...he asked me, ‘Who are you?’ And I told him that <strong>I was an Amalekite</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later on, possibly for fear of what David might do to him, now that David figured out most of his story, he changed it again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"David said to the young man who had brought him the news, “Where are you from?” He replied, “<strong>I am the son of a resident alien, an Amalekite</strong>.”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Prof. Elitzur, David killed him because he was a spy who would potentially endanger Israel. However, he doesn't properly discuss why David would announce that he's killing him because \"“How did you dare,” David said to him, “to lift your hand and kill the LORD’s anointed?”\"</p>\n<p>Therefore, it seems to me that perhaps the term \"אֵיךְ לֹא יָרֵאתָ לִשְׁלֹחַ יָדְךָ לְשַׁחֵת אֶת מְשִׁיחַ ה'\" has a different meaning than what is usually understood by it. \"לשחת\" means \"to desecrate, spoil, pervert\". I think David had two points folded into one:</p>\n<p>a. That the Amalekite dared to desecrate one of Hashem's chosen - Shaul - by pillaging his body, which is major disrespect to any dead body, but is also a big disrespect to both Hashem and the Nation of Israel when it's done to the King of Israel.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>b. That the Amalekite dared to come to David - another of Hashem's chosen - with the intent of wreaking havoc upon David, his men and all of Israel by passing off misinformation and at the same time, gathering key information and passing it on to the Amalekites.</p>\n<p>For these reasons - being that he both desecrated an important symbol of Israel - the king - and that he posed a real geopolitical threat to Israel (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodef\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">din rodef</a> at the very least), he was killed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I should note that at this point, David had likely also figured out that the Amalekite hadn't really killed Shaul, because the Amalekites had brought upon the start of his downfall. Shaul would have never begged an Amalekite of all people to end his life. This also explains the end of the story, in which David says: \"And David said to him, “Your blood be on your own head! Your own mouth testified against you when you said, ‘I put the LORD’s anointed to death.’”\" - his story was so full of holes that that is what brought his death.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>How did he warrant the death penalty?

And the command of the king is not something that can exempt him in this, since [when faced with] the words of the master and the words of the student whose words do you listen to?

And this was his response to David, for David already knew from his mouth that he was an Amalekite.

    "content": "# One Gemara cites another -- evidence of the order in which Shas was compiled?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Gemara Tamid notes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tamid.27b.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on daf 27b</a>) that a certain Braisa appears in Yoma, in Perek Ba Lo Kohen Gadol. This citation is correct; Artscroll notes (Tamid 27b3 #27) that more specifically the Braisa appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.69a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 69a</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now I have often noticed the Gemara use our names of the tractates and Perakim in ways that are arguably intended as the names of topics or areas of inquiry, rather than the titles of books. It’s as if someone referred to studying metaphysics, and you were unsure whether he intended Metaphysics, the book by Aristotle, or to the general field of study. For example, at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.28a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 28a</a>, a Braisa refers to the day on which “Eduyos” was taught. Apparently the mainstream understanding is that this is the title of a book, although I’m not sure why it cannot equally be understood as the name of a topic. When the gemara uses the term Shmona Sheratzim (as at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.47a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 47a</a>) it could be taken this way, as the name of a topic of study.</p>\n\n<p>Where the reference is more clearly to a particular book, the references can often be understood as references to the Mishnah. For example, at the beginning of Gemara Nazir, and at many other places, the rabbis discuss the order of the Mishna. At <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.14b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 14b</a>, the Gemara mentions that there are 5 Perakim, which is of course true of both the Mishnah and the Gemara. If we take the reference to Eduyos (which I mentioned in the previous paragraph) as a book title, it refers apparently to the tractate of Mishnah. This might also be the case for references to the Bavas, which would be meaningless as the names of topics if not already familiar as the titles of tractates. (As another party with my own user name Chaim observes, two of the Bava's are referred to by name in Bava Kamma itself (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.102a.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 102a</a>) as well as a parallel sugya in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.7a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 7a</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>But the Tamid example seems unambiguously to refer to a place in another tractate of Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>MY QUESTIONS:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>How did the Tamid editor know where Yoma cites the Braisa? Is this citation a strong sign that Tamid was compiled after Yoma?</p></li>\n<li><p>Can you direct me to other places like this one, where one Gemara cites another? Can you direct me to other internal evidence of the order in which tractates were complied?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I found once something interesting a bit similar to the point you are making at the beginning of Maseches Zevochim on Daf 7b where the Gemoro refers you to something it said earlier which is normally the Loshon of the Rishonim such as Rashi,Tosfos etc. and the Loshon there used in the Gemoro is \"KEDERAISH PIRKOH\" and judging on the Bach's comment in Ois Aleph he also seems to be a bit taken with it because he tells you that it refers to something in the beginning of the Perek on Daf 2 sof Omud Aleph.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is a famous Loshon of \"Boy Bayom\" that refers to two specific times a) the Gemoro in Berochos 28a when there was a change of Nesius and more people were allowed into the Beys Hamedrash and this is referred to a few times in Shas such as in Sotah 27b as well as the Mishnayos of Maseches Yodayim Perek 3 and 4 b) the second \"Boy Bayom\" occurs in the beginning of Maseches Shabbos in Daf 13b with the 18 Dovor in the attic of Chananyoh Ben Chizkiah where the Halocho was in favour of Beys Shanmmai over Beys Hillel and is referred to many times in the Masechtoh of Eduyois as mentioned above. The most interesting thing with these 2 \"Bo Bayoms\" is that occur very closely to each other in the first Perek of Pesochim the first time is in Daf 18a which is referring to the change of Nesius in Berochos Daf 28a the second one is on Daf 19b and that refers to the 18 Dovor in the attic of Channanyoh Ben Chzkiyoh</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mahartz Chayus mentions in Gitin (7a) that depending on who is quoting whom, we can deduce which tractates were arranged first. </p>\n\n<p>As regards this issue of direct reference in the Talmud to other Talmudic locations, in Chapter 31 (and ch. 33) of Mavo Hatalmud (p. 342f), he addresses this topic. He brings some poof as well as examples that many statements of the Talmud were edited in later by the Gaonim and so forth. For example, in the beginning of Kidushin until \"bekesef minalan' is from the Rabanan Savorai. He brings other examples of additions made by the Rabanan Savorai such as in Gitin 7a, and as in Tosafos Kesubos 2b, Bava Metziah 2a, Yevamos 80b and Nidah 4b (see inside!). Or in Chulin 63a, usage of Vayikra is an addition, that terminology did not turn up until much later; back then it was Toras Cohanim.</p>\n\n<p>As for this particular example in Tamid, as I recall, the Oz Vehador edition has a footnote discussing the fact that this was added in probably from the margins of a student. As soon as I have my Talmud in my hand I will add the exact information.</p>\n\n<p>Thus this was not some special secret into the order of the compiling of the Talmud, rather from a later student who already had the whole Talmud in his hand. (It is worthwhile to know that certain tractates do employ different dialect of Aramaic, presumably due to their later redaction dates, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/91186/how-long-did-rav-ashi-live\">perhaps related to this</a>. Among them would be Tamid and Nedrim)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the source for בית נאמן בישראל for newly married couples?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A common wish for couples about to be or just married couples is \"May they build a בית נאמן בישראל\". My translation (may be off, somewhat) is \"An established house among (the people) of Israel.\"</p>\n\n<p>What is the origin of this expression? When did its common usage as a blessing for couples begin? </p>\n\n<p>(Thanks to DoubleAA), I see a similar expression used in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14258&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I Samuel 2:35</a>. <em>Metzudat Tzion</em> commentary explains that נאמן means \"established for him and future generations.\" Could this be the origin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The term בית נאמן appears in three places in Tanakh: I Samuel (2:35), I Samuel (25:28), and I Kings (11:38). A similar term is found in II Samuel (7:16).</p>\n\n<p>Based on the Bar Ilan database and the HebrewBooks database, it appears that this was only popularised as a generic wedding blessing in the latter half of the 20th century. E.g. in Mishneh Halakhot (3:136) from 1959, Yabia Omer (9:43) from 1960 and , and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46371&st=%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%9F+%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C&pgnum=23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this wedding invitation</a> from 1960 (See lower right on the page).

In context there בית נאמן means, a line of kohanim gedolim that lasted many generations.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of a marriage, it would presumably mean a lasting line of progeny.</p>\n\n<p>See also Rambam's Hilkhot Melakhim (7:15) who refers to a בית נכון בישראל possibly in reference to lasting progeny, as he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מובטח לו שלא ימצא נזק ולא תגיעהו רעה, ויבנה לו בית נכון בישראל ויזכה לו ולבניו עד עולם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, while that exact phrase is probably borrowed from Judges (16:26,29) which refers to a stable physical structure, the idea in Rambam is borrowed from I Samuel (25:28) which indeed uses the term בית נאמן.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that the term בית נאמן בישראל, is based on Rambam's similar expression בית נכון בישראל.</p>\n\n\n",

According to him, before eating from the tree there was no need for any giving birth at all. Since there was no death, there was no need to replenish the world with more people. So if they hadn't eaten from the tree there would be no giving birth at all. The curse was that now that there is death in the world, it will be necessary to give birth.

In verse 8, he starts by focusing on what happened at <em>Horev</em> (Mt. Sinai) with the sin of the Golden Calf.</p>\n\n<p>From there until verse 21, he describes what happened at Horev. In verses 22-23 he describes some of the other rebellious events. (Sounds OK, to me, b/c the intro verse was listing the rebellious events in general>) Verse 24, he makes a \"summary\" statement.</p>\n\n<p>Then, it seems Moshe reverts back to the Horev event from verses 25 - 29, he goes back to HOrev. It continues in the next chapter from 10:1 - 10:5.</p>\n\n<p>Then from 10:6 - 10:8 there seems to be verses that seem completely disconnected from the event at Horev and it doesn't seem to be any type of \"reproof\". It talks about Aharon's death and the priesthood going to his son Elazar and how the Levi'im didn't get a portion of land.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, from 10:10 - 10:11 we are back to what happened at Horev.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, there are two interruptions.</p>\n\n<p>The first one seems to be related to Moshe's reproof, so it has direct relevance. But, why not move that section to the end after discussing the events at Horev?</p>\n\n<p>The second interruption puzzles me.

You’re probably right as to their relevance. </p>\n\n<p>The <em>second</em> interruption, on the other hand, has had much ink spilled over it as to its relevance. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi to 10:6 starts by noting that Aharon did not die where this passuk says he did, nor did the B’nei Yisrael travel in the manner that these pesukim relate. He explains that on Aharon’s death, the Jews rebelled and retreated several stops to return to Mitzraim, before Shevet Levi stepped up and fought their brethren to prevent them from retreating father. Eventually, they realized that this bloodshed was because they failed to eulogize Aharon properly. The Ramban fills in the missing pieces from Yerushalmi Yoma 1:1, which Rashi is quoting, that their desire to return to Mitzraim and the associated bloodshed are as “difficult” for HaShem as the day they served the Eigel. Rashi to 10:8 explains that Moshe also threw in Shevet Levi’s appointment for good measure, as they were the ones who stepped up in both of these incidents. </p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra back on 10:6 explains that since Moshe related previously that he prayed that Aharon be spared (9:20), he is now relating that Aharon indeed did not die immediately, but rather only after 40 years. According to him, we return to the topic at hand in verse 8; in his opinion, the Leviim were separated at the time of the Eigel. As for the difficulties brought by Rashi, he hand-waves them by saying that the pesukim here are referring to those places by different names, or introducing new cities not mentioned previously, for whatever reason. </p>\n\n<p>The Ramban to the same passuk gives an alternative explanation to the geography set forth by the passuk (calling Ibn Ezra’s understanding “Divrei Ruach” - presumably similar to the English idiom “full of hot air”), but he agrees with the Ibn Ezra as to the relevance of Aharon’s death here. However, to 10:8, he quotes Rashi’s explanation as to Shevet Levi’s elevation being mentioned here, and disagrees based on textual difficulties (Ramban saves his harsh words for the Ibn Ezra in general). In his opinion, Shevet Levi is mentioned here because since we just mentioned that Elazar became Kohen Gadol instead of his father, he also had to mention that the entire Shevet had previously been elevated. </p>\n\n\n",

However, it has a definite Christian bend and does not always follow the Jewish traditions in translation. I will illustrate this phenomenon with a few examples. </p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 7:14 (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<p>MT:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לָ֠כֵן יִתֵּ֨ן אֲדֹנָ֥י ה֛וּא לָכֶ֖ם א֑וֹת הִנֵּ֣ה הָעַלְמָ֗ה הָרָה֙\n  וְיֹלֶ֣דֶת בֵּ֔ן וְקָרָ֥את שְׁמ֖וֹ עִמָּ֥נוּ אֵֽל׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>KJV:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin\n  shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NJPS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Assuredly, my Lord will give you a sign of His own accord! Look, the\n  young woman is with child and about to give birth to a son. Let her\n  name him Immanuel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>KJV translates עלמה‎ as \"virgin\"—in \"anticipation\" of the Christian belief that Mary was a virgin when she begot Jesus—while NJPS translates this term in the usual Jewish way, i.e. \"young woman\" (virgin = בתולה).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Isaiah 40:3:</p>\n\n<p>MT:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ק֣וֹל קוֹרֵ֔א בַּמִּדְבָּ֕ר פַּנּ֖וּ דֶּ֣רֶךְ יְהוָ֑ה יַשְּׁרוּ֙\n  בָּעֲרָבָ֔ה מְסִלָּ֖ה לֵאלֹהֵֽינוּ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>KJV:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of\n  the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NJPS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A voice rings out: “Clear in the desert A road for the Lord! Level in\n  the wilderness A highway for our God!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The KJV translation is based on the interpretations in the LXX and the Christian canon (Matthew 3:3; Mark 1:3; John 1:23) where John the Baptist is described as \"the voice of one crying in the wilderness\" (φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ). However, the NJPS translation agrees with the syntax of the te`amim.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>KJV Ps. 22:16 = MT Ps. 22:17 (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_have_pierced_my_hands_and_my_feet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<p>MT: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּ֥י סְבָב֗וּנִי כְּלָ֫בִ֥ים עֲדַ֣ת מְ֭רֵעִים הִקִּיפ֑וּנִי\n  כָּ֝אֲרִ֗י יָדַ֥י וְרַגְלָֽי׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>KJV:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed\n  me: they pierced my hands and my feet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NJPS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dogs surround me; a pack of evil ones closes in on me, like lions\n  [they maul] my hands and feet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here the KJV follows the LXX reading, and not that of the MT. It is obvious that the this translation was used to seem like Psalms is \"anticipating\" the crucifixion of Jesus.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The list goes on. The KJV will also occasionally diverge from the Masoretic verse divisions (e.g. the example above, MT Num 25:19 = KJV Num 26:1, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, I find NJPS is a good Jewish translation, in precise and modern language. The 1917 JPS version, which is somewhat outdated, is not bad and is easily found online. Artscroll and Koren are popular Jewish translations too.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>Harry Orlinsky, editor-in-chief of the NJPS, in a 1990 essay pointed to the example of three texts in the KJV as being faulty and showing Christian bias: Genesis 1:1-3, Psalm 2:12, and Isaiah 7:14. The Isaiah 7:14 text has been discussed in the first post above and the one following, so only a discussion of the other two texts needs to be done.</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 1:1-3</p>\n\n<p>MT</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>:בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֵת הָאָרֶץ\n  :וְהָאָרֶץ הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ וְחֹשֶׁךְ עַל-פְּנֵי תְהוֹם וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל-פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם\n  :וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים יְהִי אוֹר וַיְהִי-אוֹר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>KJV:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>\n  \n  <p>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p>\n  \n  <p>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NJPS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When God began to create heaven and earth--the earth being unformed and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God sweeping over the water--God said, 'Let there be light'; and there was light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The translation of רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים in NJPS as 'a wind from God' follows the interpretation of Targum Onkelos, Josephus, Midrash Rabbah, Talmud Bavli Hagigah 12a, Saadia, Rashi ('the breath of His mouth'), Rashbam, Bechor Shor, and Ibn Ezra. JPS has 'the spirit of God' (small 's').  The KJV capitalizes 'Spirit,' and it is used as a proof text for the doctrine of a third person who is God (the doctrine of the Trinity),* the proof  for the second person being, among others, Psalm 45:7a ('Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever'), another KJV mistranslation (compare Ibn Ezra, Rashi, JPS, NJPS), and Psalm 110:1 ('The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool'), likewise another KJV mistranslation (אדֹנִי in verse 1 of the MT is not the same word as אֲדֹנָי in verse 7 and should not be capitalized in translation: see Radaq, who points out that אדֹנִי has the <em>nun</em> with <em>chireq</em> and אֲדֹנָי has the <em>nun</em> with <em>qamets</em>).  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*See in particular Genesis 41:38 KJV: 'And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?' According to this translation, Pharaoh believed in the third person of the Christian Trinity! - For other רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים texts in the KJV, see Exodus 31:3; 35:31; Numbers 24:2; I Samuel 11:6; 16:15, 16, 23; 19:20, 23; Job 27:3; 33:4; 2 Chronicles 15:1; 24:20.  The same Trinitiarian bias occurs in רוּחַ-יְהוָה texts beginning in Judges 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6, 9, 19; 15:14.  Ditto for the רוּחִי texts, such as Joel 3:1, Isaiah 42:1, and 44:3.  The same for the two 'holy spirit' texts: Psalm Isaiah 63:10 and 11 (רוּחַ קָדְשְׁךָ is correctly rendered in Psalm 51:11 KJV [Psalm 51:13 MT]), the other 'holy spirit' text.  In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, this evolves into 'the Holy Ghost.'  Most curiously, רוּחִי in Genesis 6:3 is correctly rendered 'My spirit' in the KJV, but inconsistently with the practice of the translators elsewhere.  Recently, the NKJV has caught this inconsistency and changed it (incorrectly) to 'My Spirit.'  </p>\n\n<p>Psalm 2:12</p>\n\n<p>MT</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>:נַשְּׁקוּ-בַר פֶּן-יֶאֱנַף וְתֹאבְדוּ דֶרֶךְ--    כִּי-יִבְעַר כִּמְעַט אַפּוֹ\n  :אַשְׁרֵי    כָּל-חוֹסֵי בוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>KJV</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NJPS</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>pay homage in good faith [meaning of Hebrew uncertain]\n  lest He be angered and your way be doomed\n  in the mere flash of His anger.\n  Happy are all who take refuge in Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The KJV translates בַר as 'Son' (capital 'S'), implying that this refers to Jesus, but the Hebrew word for 'son' is <em>ben</em> (see verse 7, where it is used with a possessive adjective suffix: אֲסַפְּרָה אֶל-חֹק:    יְהוָה אָמַר אֵלַי בְּנִי אַתָּה--אֲנִי הַיּוֹם יְלִדְתִּיךָ). <em>Bar</em> (<em>var</em> following a vowel) is an Aramaic word and means 'son,' 'a son,' or, in construct, 'son of,' 'a son of' if the absolute noun is indefinite, and 'the son of' if the absolute noun is definite.  See כְּבַר אֱנָשׁ ('one like a son of man') Daniel 7:13 JPS, which in the KJV is mistranslated 'one like the Son of man' (definite article and capital 'S') in order to make it refer to Jesus, who used this idiomatic expression when referring to himself. But בַר אֱנָשׁ is indefinite.  <em>Bar</em> also occurs in the earlier Aramaic text דָּמֵה לְבַר-אֱלָהִין ('is like to a son of the gods') Daniel 3:25 JPS, which is mistranslated 'is like the Son of God' (definite article and capital 'S') in the KJV, thus making Nebuchadnezzar know about and see the second person of the Christian Trinity, a common interpretation in Christian commentary.  But the context clearly indicates that בַר-אֱלָהִין is indefinite. Moreover, verses 28 and 29 indicate that Nebuchadnezzar considered the god of the Jews one god among others, thus making it clear that אֱלָהִין is to be translated in the plural.* The Revised Version corrected the KJV mistranslation, and all Christian translations since that time no longer contain it, except, unsurprisingly, the NKJV, though in a footnote it concedes that 'a son of the gods' is an alternative rendering. 'the son' in Hebrew is הַבֵּן, and, as direct object, אֵת, the direct object marker, precedes it.  In Aramaic, 'the son' is בְּרָא, and, as direct object, יַת בְּרָא. This construction does not occur in Psalm 2:12 MT. (For the curious thrice use of <em>bar</em> (Aramaic) in Proverbs 31:2 and <em>ben</em> in the plural construct form (Hebrew) in 31:8 in the oracle of King Lemuel, consult the commentaries; see also A. Hurvitz, 'The Chronological Significance of 'Aramaisms' in Biblical Hebrew,' <em>Israel Exploration Journal</em>, Volume 18, Number 4 [1968]: 234-240, for <em>bar</em> in Proverbs 31:2 consult 236).  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*In that light, should not all translations of Genesis 41:38 be revised? The JPS text reads: 'And Pharaoh said unto his servants: 'Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?' But compare the words of Nebuchadnezzar in JPS in Daniel 4:5 and 6a (NJPS is similar): 'But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods;  and I told the dream before him:  O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, . . . ' Also the words of the queen of Babylon in 5:11a: ' there is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; . . .' Likewise, the words of Belshazzar, the king of Babylon, right next in 5:14: ' I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, . . .'  The phrase in 5:14 is identical with the phrase in Genesis 41:38, except that רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים is translated 'the spirit of God' in the latter and רוּחַ אֱלָהִין 'the spirit of the gods' in the former.  Since Pharaoh was a pagan like Belshazzar, should not רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים in Genesis 41:38 be rendered 'the spirit of (the) gods' as רוּחַ אֱלָהִין in Daniel 5:14?  </p>\n\n<p>-----**   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Bibliography</strong>: Harry Orlinsky, 'The Role of Theology and the Christian Mistranslation of the Hebrew Bible,' in <em>Translation of Scripture</em>, ed.

    "content": "# Avoiding Giving Maaserot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Bava Kama 28a says: </p>\n\n<p>ת\"ש בעל הבית שהניח פאה מצד אחד ובאו עניים ונטלו מצד אחר זה וזה פאה וא\"א עביד איניש דינא לנפשיה אמאי זה וזה פאה לנקוט פזר וליתיב אמר רבא מאי זה וזה פאה לפוטרן מן המעשר כדתניא המפקיר את כרמו והשכים בבקר ובצרו חייב בפרט ובעוללות ובשכחה ובפאה ופטור מן המעשר</p>\n\n<p>(Translation of the relevant part): What is meant by the ruling of: This produce and that produce are both considered pe’a? It means that they are considered pe’a with regard to exempting both portions of produce from tithes. Just as the portion that the poor people took is exempt from tithes, so is the portion that he allocated initially. This is as it is taught in a baraita: In the case of one who renounces ownership of his vineyard and arose early in the morning before anyone else took possession of it and harvested it, the one who renounces ownership is obligated in the mitzva of individual fallen grapes left for the poor [peret], and in the mitzva of incompletely formed clusters of grapes left for the poor [olelot], and in the mitzva of forgotten clusters of grapes left for the poor, and in the mitzva of pe’a, the four gifts to the poor that the Torah requires one to give from a vineyard (see Leviticus 19:9–10). But he is exempt from the mitzva to tithe his produce, because this requirement does not apply to an ownerless field. Likewise, in the above case the portion of the field that was allocated for pe’a is exempt from tithes even after the owner reclaims it, as pe’a is considered ownerless property in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains here that even though the owner reclaimed the part of the field he designated as pe'ah, it is exempt from ma'aserot (דאף פאה הנשארת הפקר חשיבא ואע\"ג דנקט לה איהו פטורה ממעשר). </p>\n\n<p>So couldn't a person theoretically designate 99% of his field as pe'ah (since one can't designate all of it, as per Tosefta Peah 1:1) and then reclaim all of it (excluding the part that actually needs to be given as pe'ah, i.e., 1/60th of his field) and thereby be exempt from giving ma'aser except on that 1%? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>That is indeed a correct deduction: one who designates part of his field as Pe’ah and then retracts that declaration does not need to give Ma’aser on that which was formerly Pe’ah. Sort of. </p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah in Pe’ah 1:6 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>לְעוֹלָם</strong> הוּא נוֹתֵן מִשּׁוּם פֵּאָה וּפָטוּר מִן הַמַּעַשְׂרוֹת, עַד שֶׁיְּמָרֵחַ.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Always</strong> he can give because of Pe’ah and it is exempt from Ma’aser, until he smooths it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Says the Meleches Shlomo ad. loc.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לעולם הוא נותן משום פאה כו'. בירושל' מתני' דקתני לעולם הוא נותן משום פאה לעולם משמע אפי' לאחר שהפריש חובת הפאה דהיינו א' מס' חוזר ומוסיף ואותו תוס' פטור מן המעשרות. אתיא כב\"ש דאמר לק' רפ\"ו הפקר לעניים הפקר ופטור וכן פאה זו שהוסיף והפקירה לעניים פטורה אבל לבעה\"ב חייבת אא\"כ הפקירה אף לעשירים כן פי' ר\"ש ז\"ל: </p>\n  \n  <p>From the Yerushalmi: Our Mishnah which teaches “‘Always’ he can give because of Pe’ah” - “Always” implies that even after he separates Pe’ah, i.e. 1/60, and then adds it back to his field, that addition is still exempt from Ma’aser. This accords with the opinion of Beis Shammai, who says later in the beginning of the sixth Perek that one may designate something as Hefker only for the poor and thereby exempt it from Ma’aser. Likewise this Pe’ah which he previously designated as Hefker for the poor is exempt from Ma’aser. The owner, however, must still take off Ma’aser until he designates it as Hefker even for the rich. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, the Mishnah’s statement that it’s exempt “until he smooths it,” i.e. Meiruach, the classical threshold (pardon the pun) for when it’s obligated in Ma’aser. </p>\n\n\n",

If so, do you have to make a blessing on the cornered garments in the morning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=43&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 43a</a> says that one is exempt from wearing tzitzit at night because of the passuk in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9943/jewish/Chapter-15.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 15:39</a> which says \"and you shall see them.\" Thus one is not obligated to wear tzitzit at night, although it is permissible to do so. </p>\n\n<p>So why would anyone wear tzitzit at night? As a sort of \"protection\" from the night, in addition to extra Yorei Shamayim. Wearing the kippah at night is the same. It is not obligation to wear the kippah during sleep. (Is wearing a kippah at all obligatory? Maybe \"minhag Yisrael Torah hi.\") Again, some people do indeed wear the kippah at night for extra Yorei Shamayim. </p>\n\n<p>I have heard a story (I think it was actually somewhere here on Mi Yodeya)  of someone who was in a Yeshivah and would take off his kippah during sleep, to which the Mashgiach said he should keep it on. The student said that the kippah always fell off his head at night and got lost to which the Mashgiach replied \"you learned how to not fall out of the bed at night; you will also learn to have the kippah stay on at night\"!</p>\n\n<p>As for reciting the bracha over the tzitzit the following morning, the matter is a bit more complicated than a yes or no answer.  It is preferable to have one tallit katan for the day and one for the night, that way one could don a tallit in the night before bed (in which a bracha would not be said) and in the morning take them off, put on his daytime tzitzit and recite the bracha on them. If however he only has one tallit katan for night and day, then a bracha is not recited. But if one is married, he does not recite the bracha on the tallit katan anyway, because he says the bracha over the tallit gadol during Shacharit.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/536572/jewish/Tzitzit-Time.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Meiruach through a side door\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a concept that ma’aser is only required once Meiruach (literally, “smoothing”) is performed on the crop (Peah 1:6 et. al.), at which point the crop is complete and eligible for taking Ma’aser and Terumah (Yachin ad. loc.). </p>\n\n<p>I have heard that if the produce was brought into the storehouses through a side door and not through the main entrance that Meiruach is not considered to have been performed, and therefore such produce is not eligible to Ma’aser. Is this correct, and if so, where is the source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You are confusing Meiruach (or more generally, Gemar Melakha -- finishing the labor) and Keva' (establishment).</p>\n\n<p>When one picks produce owned by a Jew in Israel, he is allowed to snack on it (אכילת עראי) even before tithing it until he finishes his work on the harvest (גמר מלאכה, such as your example of smoothing the piles) if he is planning on selling the crop. If he intends to keep it, then there are 6 ways the produce is established to be tithed (נקבע למעשר) after the harvest is done: bringing it into his house, separating Terumah from it, selling it, cooking it, pickling it, or trying to eat it on Shabbat. After one of those things happens, he can't even snack on the food before tithing it. (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/7403.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Maaserot 3:1-3</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The rule of \"bringing it into your house\" only applies if you bring it through a main doorway, not if you pass it in through the window. So if you wanted to avoid tithing, you could bring your produce into your house in a non-standard way and then only snack on it raw. The Gemara in Gittin (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=81\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">81a</a>) praises the early generations who brought their produce home the normal way in order to establish it to be tithed, unlike the lowly later generations who would bring their produce home via the roof in order to skip out on tithing.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How is a reference to Egypt comforting when the concern is that the enemy is many?",
    "content": "# How is a reference to Egypt comforting when the concern is that the enemy is many?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the beginning of <em>Ekev</em>, <em>Moshe</em> describes wonderful things that will befall the Jews when they adhere to God's will. It says among them (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.16-19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:16–19</a>) that \"you shall consume all the peoples…. Will you say to yourself, 'These nations are more numerous than I; how will I be able to drive them out'? You shall not fear them. You shall surely remember what the Lord, your God, did to Pharaoh and to all of Egypt: The great trials that your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm with which the Lord, your God, brought you out. So will the Lord, Your God, do to all the peoples you fear.\" (Judaica Press translation.)</p>\n\n<p>My kid asked: It seems <em>Moshe</em> picked the wrong question-answer combination. If the Jews' concern is that the nations would be more numerous, how is a reference to Egypt mollifying? The Jews were seemingly more numerous than the Egyptians (see \"more numerous… than we are\" in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.1.7-9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sh'mos</em> 1:7–9</a>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(I very tentatively propose that the analogue here is that the many Jews who left Egypt are being compared to the many gentiles who will leave Canaan or be killed. Alternatively, that the Egyptians' oppression (<em>after Sh'mos</em> 1:9) killed out enough Jews that the Jews did not outnumber them. But if either of those is the explanation, I'd love to see some source that says so.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Firstly, it is highly unlikely that the Jews were in fact greater in numbers and strength than the Egyptians.  Many Mefarshim there in <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/1.9#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 1:9</a> (e.g. R' Avraham ben Harambam, Malbim, Hakesav Vehakabbalah, and more) note that רב ועצום ממנו does not literally mean that there were more Jews than Egyptians.  Even according to those who do interpret it that way, that Passuk is not Hashem speaking, but rather Pharaoh using scare tactics to motivate his nation to control them, and likely untrue.</p>\n<p>This is the simplest understanding, stated by many Mefarshim there in Shemos (see above link), and stated explicitly here by Seforno:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי תאמַר... אֵיכָה אוּכַל לְהוֹרִישָׁם... לא תִירָא מֵהֶם – כְּשֶׁתּאמַר ״אֵיכָה אוּכַל לְהוֹרִישָׁם״, בִּהְיוֹתָם ״רַבִּים... מִמֶּנִּי״, ״לא״ תּאמַר זֶה עַל דֶּרֶךְ שֶׁ״תִּירָא מֵהֶם״ אֶלָּא עַל דֶּרֶךְ שֶׁתַּכִּיר שֶׁזֶּה הָיָה נִמְנָע לוּלֵי ה׳ עֶזְרָתָה לְךָ. וְזֶה כִּי זָכר תִּזְכּר אֵת אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה ה׳ אֱלהֶיךָ לְפַרְעה וּלְכָל מִצְרָיִם – <strong>שֶׁהָיוּ רַבִּים וַחֲזָקִים מִמְּךָ</strong>.</p>\n<p>כי תאמר...איכה אוכל להורישם, לא תירא מהם, for you will say that they outnumber you. Do not say this in a manner which will inspire fear in you, but reflect on the fact that this would be an argument only if the Lord your God had not already demonstrated that with His help you can overcome. זכור תזכור את אשר עשה ה' אלוקיך לפרעה וכל מצרים, <strong>they outnumbered you by a far greater margin than the Canaanites and they were stronger than the Canaanites</strong>. (Alhatorah translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if we were to assume (unlike the above) that the Jews were greater in number and strength, this was prior to them getting enslaved.  Once they were enslaved, we are told that they had no spirit to fight back, and were very weak, so at that point, the idea of having no chance in battle is indeed a good parallel to draw.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(IMHO, the entire above discussion is moot. The point of these verses is to show that Hashem has and will continue to perform miracles to fulfill what he has promised to his chosen nation.  It is irrelevant as to the exact details of each case.)</p>\n\n\n",

The דרכי משה argues and says that you only say חנ׳׳ן when you know the mixture occurred. In our case that you only found out that milk fell into the pot, after you added water, חנ׳׳ן never happened, so you could be מצטרף the water with the meat to be מבטל the milk. </p>\n\n\n",

However, Rambam writes (1:10) that one violates it when he thinks how he will pressure/convince the owner to allow him to acquire it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיון שחשב בלבו היאך יקנה דבר זה ונפתה לבו בדבר עבר בלא תעשה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, merely desiring something would not be forbidden. Only upon setting ones mind on the object and planning to coerce the owner, is the prohibition violated. This inference is made by the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=41805&rid=11862\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'aseh Rokeah</a> (ibid).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Maggid_Mishneh_on_Mishneh_Torah,_Robbery_and_Lost_Property.1.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maggid Mishneh</a> (1:10) writes that the opinion of Ra'avad is that one violates the prohibition by desiring purchasing the object against the owners' will.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונ\"ל שדעת הר\"א ז\"ל שחיוב התאוה זו היא שיתאוה לקנות בדמים שלא ברצון הבעלים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here too, it sounds like merely vaguely desiring something is not forbidden. Only desire that is focused into the particular desire/plan to acquire it illicitly is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=41805&rid=11862\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaseh Rokeah</a> (there) notes that in Sefer HaMitsvot (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot_LaRambam,_Mitzvot_Lo_Taase.266\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lo Taaseh 266</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/961896/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English</a>), Rambam does not specify that one needs to set his mind on illicitly acquiring it, and the implication is that merely desiring someone else's thing is forbidden. He notes that the MT should be assumed to be exact, and in the case, the SHM should be assumed to be inexact.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Arokh HaShulhan (HM 359:8) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולאו דלא תתאוה אף על גב דתאוה היא בלב מ\"מ אינו עובר בתאות לבו בלבד אא\"כ מחשב בלבו איך להשיגה מחבירו וכיון שגומר דבר זה בלבו עובר על לא תתאוה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, merely desiring something is not enough, one must actually set his mind on acquiring it, and how he will go about [illicitly] doing so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.5b.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzi’a 5b</a> says that the prohibition of Lo Sachmod is only violated when you <em>force</em> someone into a sale, even if you pay them fairly for the item being sold. So a person can ask if he can buy an item, but if its owner refuses, the prospective buyer is not allowed to continue pressuring him. </p>\n\n\n",

You are directly under G-d's control. Therefore don't stray and worship the idols of the other nations. I already mentioned this many times. <sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramban seems to be talking about the idea that since the Jews, unlike the other nations, do not have a \"patron angel\". Instead, G-d himself directly rules the Jewish Nation. (as the Ramban says in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9617&pgnum=73\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 4:15</a>) Therefore, we must only serve G-d, and not turn to idol worship.</p>\n\n<p>There are some opinions that non-Jews are allowed to believe in Shituf (partnership, i.e. that there are other forces in addition to G-d who have influence over the world (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9055/what-is-the-exact-definition-of-shituf-vis-a-vis-avodah-zarah\">here</a> for a discussion of this)).</p>\n\n<p>Based on my understanding of the Ramban, does the Ramban then hold that the other nations may believe in Shituf, since they do have a <em>\"ruling officer, enforcer, or ruler among the angels\"</em>?</p>\n\n<p>If the Ramban himself does not hold this view, are there other opinions to that use this logic to explain why non-Jews may believe in Shituf?  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> \nI don't know where else the Ramban has mentioned this, so perhaps he goes into this in more detail in other places, and answers my questions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>R' Yaakov Kaminetzky discuses the opinion of Ramban in his Emes LiYaakov, parshas ViEschanan 4 19 on the verse</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וראית את השמש ואת הירח גו׳ אשר חלק ה׳ אלקיך אתם לכל העמים תחת כל השמים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He says there are two approaches to this passage amongst the mefarshim. Some say it means he gave the sun and moon for light, but don't worship them. Whereas Ramban and Ibn Ezra say each nation has a star and mazal which actually can have influence on the nation they are over. (He points to Ramban in Bereishis 1 18 as well.)</p>\n\n<p>He continues that there is a fundamental argument at play here.  Rambam famously states that no avoda zara have any power and anyone who worships them are wasting their time.\nRamban and Ibn Ezra on that verse disagree. They hold that Hashem actually placed the nature in the universe and gave power to these item to influence those nations under their charge.</p>\n\n<p>However, the nations are not allowed to worship these items, as that is idolatry! He explains then that the ban against idolatry for the nations is because the only power these items have is from Hashem and it is not fitting to pray or to worship them. All prayer and worship must only be directed to Hashem, the source of all this power. He does concede that if in fact they would worship and pray to their mazal, it would in fact have an effect.</p>\n\n<p>R' Yaakov goes on to point to the book of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15819#showrashi=true&v=24\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shoftim 11 24</a> where Yiftach tells the king of Amon</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הלא את אשר יורישך כמוש אלהיך אותו תירש ואת כל אשר הוריש ה׳ אלקינו מפנינו אותו נירש</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He points to Ralbag who explains Yiftach's words as having been said in jest. (In accordance with Rambam, presumably.) But goes on to say that according to Ramban, his words can be explained according to their simple understanding.</p>\n\n<p>The footnote on the Emes Liyaakov says the Yalkut Meam Loez in Shoftim brings this exact pshat in the name of Nefesh Yehonason. The footnote adds that this has practical halakhic ramifications and points to the Taz in Yoreh Deah 147 2 and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14061&pgnum=292\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meshech Chochma at the end of Chukas</a>. </p>\n\n<p>That Taz is arguing on a Ramma who said </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מותר לומר לעובדי כוכבים אלהיך יהיה בעזרך או יצליח מעשיך. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Taz at length (and Shach quoting Bach, whom Taz said is quoting him) that the Ramma confused the intent of the Rambam etc and one may only say אלקים בעזרך not אלהיך בעזרך. </p>\n\n<p>The Meshech Chochma is on the haftora. He explains the passuk in Shoftim used the phrase הוריש & not הורישך specifically because he did not want to even imply that his idol actually benefited him anything. He points to the words of the Taz to hammer in this point.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately I could not find any Emes Liyaakov online to link. It's always worth checking inside when coming across a big chidush. Here is a picture of the page.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5jU6G.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5jU6G.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

There are few problems with it.</p>\n\n<p>One is the Ramban agrees with the Rambam's list of the 613 mitzvos, with only 25 exceptions (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18009/differences-between-rambam-and-rambans-mitzvah-count\">here</a>, although the only answer so far only lists the ones Ramban added, not the ones he took away). Most if not all the mitzvos you listed the Ramban agrees with.</p>\n\n<p>Second, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Palachi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Chaim Palagi</a> points out in his sefer <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22354&st=&pgnum=40\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UBacharta BaChaim</a>, many of the mitzvos you listed have nothing to do with korbonos. He lists vidui (although it originates with korbonos, it applies to non temple settings as well), birkas kohanim (also used to be in the temple but applies outside the temple), challah, tzitzis, lo sasuru, pidyon bechor, inheritance laws, shofar, nedarim as examples. He proposes amending the words of Ramban to read: ואין בספר הזה מצוות נוהגות לדורות, זולתי קצת מצוות <strong>ובעניני</strong> הקרבנות, adding a vav to mean: \"There are no mitzvos in this book that apply for all times, except a few mitzvos, <strong>and</strong> some ideas about korbonos\". However he feels this to be an unlikely solution, and leaves the question unresolved.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially it's questionable if the Ramban literally means that there aren't non temple mitzvos in Sefer Bamidbar that apply for all times. Due to the numerous examples listed above, I find it unlikely if anyone would agree to that statement.</p>\n\n\n",

One who has an opportunity to repeat a past sin and refrains from it because of his repentance - not because of fear or physical weakness. How so? Take one who had illicit relations with a woman, and some time later he was secluded with her. He stands in his love for her, and in his physical strength, and in the country in which he previously sinned [so he’s not humbled by being away - see 2:4] but nevertheless refrained and did not sin - that is one who does a complete repentance. ... And what is repentance? That the sinner abandons the sin, removes it from his mind, and concludes in his heart never to do it again. ... And he must admit his sins aloud and say these things he has concluded with his heart. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, in summary, Teshuvah has four parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Remorse for the past sin (“abandons the sin and removes it from his mind”)</li>\n<li>Verbal admission to past sins</li>\n<li>Verbal conclusion not to repeat the sin</li>\n<li>Actually refrain from sinning solely from acting on this conclusion</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But this doesn’t really answer your question. What if one doesn’t think he stands a chance? We’re all human. We probably all fall into this category for at least one sin at at least one point in time. Those of us who aren’t big Gedolim probably more so in either of both these respects. I know I personally have remorse over certain sins, yet I can’t seem to be able to shake them. Well, most of the parts of the Rambam that I skipped are just pesukim to back up his assertions, but there was one other piece that I skipped:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְיָעִיד עָלָיו יוֹדֵעַ תַּעֲלוּמוֹת שֶׁלֹּא יָשׁוּב לְזֶה הַחֵטְא לְעוֹלָם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (הושע יד ד) \"וְלֹא נֹאמַר עוֹד אֱלֹהֵינוּ לְמַעֲשֵׂה יָדֵינוּ\" וְגו:</p>\n  \n  <p>[If one goes through this process,] the One Who knows all hidden things will testify about him that he will not repeat these sins ever, as it says, “And never again will we call our handiwork our god” (Hoshea 14:2). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, that seems an awfully odd derasha. Here’s the passuk in full:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַשּׁ֣וּר ׀ לֹ֣א יוֹשִׁיעֵ֗נוּ עַל־סוּס֙ לֹ֣א נִרְכָּ֔ב וְלֹא־נֹ֥אמַר ע֛וֹד אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ לְמַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדֵ֑ינוּ אֲשֶׁר־בְּךָ֖ יְרֻחַ֥ם יָתֽוֹם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>‎Assyria shall not save us. No more will we ride on steeds, nor ever again will we call our handiwork our god, since in You alone orphans find pity!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is it about this verse, once put into context, that the Rambam sees as indicating that one who does Teshuvah won’t sin again?</p>\n\n<p>The Kesef Mishnah says that’s exactly the problem - we haven’t added <em>enough</em> context. Let’s go back to verse 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שׁ֚וּבָה יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל עַ֖ד יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ כִּ֥י כָשַׁ֖לְתָּ בַּעֲוֺנֶֽךָ׃ קְח֤וּ עִמָּכֶם֙ דְּבָרִ֔ים וְשׁ֖וּבוּ אֶל־יְהוָ֑ה אִמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗יו כָּל־תִּשָּׂ֤א עָוֺן֙ וְקַח־ט֔וֹב וּֽנְשַׁלְּמָ֥ה פָרִ֖ים שְׂפָתֵֽינוּ׃ אַשּׁ֣וּר ׀ לֹ֣א יוֹשִׁיעֵ֗נוּ עַל־סוּס֙ לֹ֣א נִרְכָּ֔ב וְלֹא־נֹ֥אמַר ע֛וֹד אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ לְמַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדֵ֑ינוּ אֲשֶׁר־בְּךָ֖ יְרֻחַ֥ם יָתֽוֹם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>‎Return, O Israel, to Hashem your God, for you have stumbled because of your sin. ‎Take words with you and return to Hashem. Say to Him: “Forgive all guilt and accept what is good; instead of bulls we will pay [the offering of] our lips. Assyria shall not save us. No more will we ride on steeds, nor ever again will we call our handiwork our god, since in You alone orphans find pity!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now we get a different picture. I quote the Kesef Mishnah in full:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש לומר דהכי קאמר יקח לעד להשי''ת עליו שלא ישוב לחטוא עוד שנאמר ולא נאמר עוד וכו' כלומר שתחלת הפסוק הוא קחו עמכם דברים ושובו אל ה' ומה תאמרו לא נאמר אלהינו למעשה ידינו שהיא עבודת כוכבים הרי פשטיה דקרא שלוקח לשם יתברך לעד עליו שלא ישוב עוד לאותו עון: </p>\n  \n  <p>And there is to answer that this is what [the verse] is saying: he will take as a testimony for Hashem regarding himself that he will not sin further, as it says, “Nor ever again will we say, etc.” That is to say: The beginning of the passage is “Take words with you and return to Hashem.” And what is the meaning of “nor ever again will we call our handiwork our god”? That is a reference to idolatry, and so the simple reading of the verse is that he takes for Hashem, Blessed be He, as a testimony regarding himself that he will never again return to that sin. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I originally understood this to mean that one who sins and does a full repentance gains Divine assistance to never repeat it. But then I saw the Lechem Mishnah.</p>\n\n<p>The Lechem Mishnah comes at the problem from a slightly different angle:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא''ת איך הקב''ה יעיד עליו כך וכי לא נשארה הבחירה בידו . ... ויש לומר דפירושו כך שבשעה שהוא עושה תשובה צריך שיקבל עליו לעד להשי''ת שלא ישוב לזה החטא לעולם והוא על דרך ואעידה לי את השמים ואת הארץ שמקבל עליו לעדים לשמים ולארץ...</p>\n  \n  <p>And if you will ask: How can G-d testify about him [that he will never again sin]? Do we not have free will? ... And there is to answer that its explanation is as follows. When one does Teshuvah, he must accept Hashem as a witness upon himself that he won’t sin again. This is similar to “and I appoint as a witness the heavens and the earth,” that he accepts upon himself the heavens and the earth as witnesses. ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He concludes by bringing a proof to this understanding from a different passuk.</p>\n\n<p>As the Kesef Mishnah uses the same wording of “accepting upon himself as a witness,” it could be that this is what he means as well: it’s not an issue of siyata d’shmaya so much as it being a fact that one who refrains from sinning because of his Teshuvah won’t sin again. If he goes through the Teshuvah process properly, he doesn’t need to worry about doing it repeatedly. All he needs is just once. </p>\n\n<p>Once he truly transforms himself because of his Teshuvah, it completely leaves his mind as an option, like how one who grows up eating nothing but kosher doesn’t even consider eating treif. It’s not in his <em>nekudas habechirah</em>, loosely translated as his options to choose from - because he doesn’t even want to choose it at that point. </p>\n\n<p>This is no easy task - not just to refrain, but to refrain <em>because he is a new person because of his repentance</em>. I won’t sugar-coat it for you. But it’s still much easier than many make it out to be. You don’t need to worry about your entire future: all you need to do is succeed once. And from there, one mitzvah leads to another. </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is a hired non-Jewish maid prohibited to work on Shabbat?",
    "content": "# Is a hired non-Jewish maid prohibited to work on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to understand what is meant by <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14085&st=&pgnum=76\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 5:14</a>. It says that your slave may not perform any <em>melacha</em> so that they \"may rest as you do\".</p>\n\n<p>Does this mean that if someone has a full-time live-in maid who cleans the dishes and cooks and watches the children among other tasks - does this mean that the maid has a complete day off and is forbidden to do any of these things? I understand that a maid who is paid is not the same as an unpaid slave. But why would payment, alone, be a factor in changing the status? In both cases, the person is still working for you. Would it matter if the maid is unpaid and is volunteering her time or is \"bartering\" by having free rent and food?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question title and your \"thoughts\" in the body are unrelated.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Slaves</strong> are your property and your responsibility - and somewhat Jewish - and it's your responsibility to ensure they keep Shabbat.

However, she cannot be asked (or expected) to do anything that you are forbidden to do, like cooking.</p>\n\n<p>But she can still look after the kids, set the table and clean up after the meals.</p>\n\n\n",

Who is the Bal Haturim referring to?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The parsha deals with a false prophet and uses exclusively male verbs. This might lead one to think the relevant laws only apply to a male prophet. Therefore the Midrash<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.83.3/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> Sifrei 83:3</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בקרבך. לרבות האשה. </p>\n  \n  <p>\"in your midst\": to include a woman. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess this word is considered superfluous enough to be adding something, which Chazal say that even a female false prophet is liable. </p>\n\n<p>The Baal Haturim wants to show the gematria of the word shows a hint to where this drash came from. I find the exact phraseology of האשה, the location of the source, and the frequency of the Baal Haturim to do this style of gematrias compelling evidence that this is his intent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems Eliyahu Munk explains it that it is referring to the founder of cristianity's mother</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur_HaAroch,_Deuteronomy.13.2.1/en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Tur_HaAroch,_Deuteronomy.13.2.1/en</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[There is a bracket by the publisher in my edition that calls attention to a gematriya our author (did not completely) publish in his commentary known as Baal Haturim in which the letters of the word נביא , prophet, (63) are shown to have the same numerical value as the word ובנה, “and her son.” The author did publish the other half of this, i.e. that the word בקרבך is equivalent in numerical value (324) of the words זו האשה (324)<strong>“this is the woman,” i.e. the woman experiencing the immaculate conception, who gave birth to the founder of Christianity</strong> who was halachically a Jew. Clearly, the author, living as he did in Christian Spain in the 14th century where the Inquisition held sway, did not want to expose himself to the accusation by the Inquisition that he had labeled that man as a false prophet. Chumash editions printed in predominantly Christian countries either omit the author’s comment on this verse altogether or present it in an entirely unintelligible form i.e. that the numerical value of the word בקרבך=the numerical value of the word זו.

Qafih</a> (commentary to Hilkhot Tefillah 12:9, note 18) there is a tradition that the prohibition only applies to recitation with the cantillation. For this reason he criticises those (Yemenites) who adopted the practice of reciting the Sh'ma with cantillation, as this allows for the possibility of violating this injunction.  This opinion is referenced in KolBo (13) as well.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Only Torah; not Nakh</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Tosafot Temurah (14b) suggest that the injunction only includes verses from the Torah.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Only unfamiliar texts</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Beit Yosef (OH 49) writes that passages included in the liturgy are not included in the injunction, since everyone is very familiar with the texts, and can easily recite them. This opinion is cited by Abudirham (Birkhot HaShahar) as well, who writes as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שכל דבר שרגילין בו ושגור בפי הכל אין בו משום דברים שבכתב אי אתה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also the opinion of Rabbenu Tam cited by Mordekhai (Gittin 470).

This is suggested by Tosafot (Temurah 14b) as well, and is the opinion of the Yereim (268) and Gra (OH 49). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Zimmerman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

He attributes this view to Rif, Rashi, Rambam, and others.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Only when reading from a Torah scroll</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Abudirham (there) cites the Yerushalmi that the problem is only to recite a passage by heart while in the process of reading from the Torah, since people will assume that the parts recited by heart are not found in the text. This Yerushalmi is also quoted by KolBo (13), and by Radvaz in a responsum (4:135). This is the opinion of Rambam as well, according to Adnei Yad HaHazaka to Hilkhot T'fillah (12:8), and others (cited <a href=\"http://asif.co.il/?wpfb_dl=4607\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Only a text which is never obligatory</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to Rabbenu Yonah (Berakhot 5a), citing the opinion of R.

[i]</p>\n\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Only as a form of study; not prayer</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to the Tosafot HaRosh to Yoma (68b) recitation of Hallel and Malkhiyot Zikhronot and Shof'rot is okay since the scriptural verses are just being quoted as a form of prayer and praise.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While not limiting the scope of the injunction the Hikrei Lev (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1725&st=&pgnum=36&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 13</a>) writes that it is not an actual injunction, but merely a guide to the proper way to learn Torah. One who recites the Written Law orally does not fulfill the mitsvah of learning Torah.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, the Tosafot HaRosh to Yoma (68b) describes it as a mere <em>mitsva min hamuvhar</em>, as he quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_ben_Samuel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yitshak of Dampierre</a> in his Tosafot to Sotah (40b).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] He does not say exactly what sort of obligation renders a text permissible to be recited, to clarify why it is ever forbidden to recite passages from the Torah, if the whole Torah must be read.</p>\n\n\n",

(A local rabbi I asked said that the Hebrew doesn't actually say the north wind brings rain, but rather \"drives\" it away.) </p>\n\n<p>If not, why does Mishlei say what it says? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While many of the European commentaries (e.g. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%9B%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi, Ralbag, Metzudos, Malbim</a>) and even <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2825.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">recent translation</a>s do indeed seem to translate the verse as you have cited, the Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.7b.7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanith 7b</a> seems to interpret it with the opposite meaning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי שמעון בן פזי: אין הגשמים <strong>נעצרין</strong> אלא בשביל מספרי לשון הרע שנאמר רוח צפון תחולל גשם ופנים נזעמים לשון סתר</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: The rains are <strong>withheld</strong> only due to the sin of those who speak slander, as it is stated: “A north wind <em>annuls</em> rain, and an angry countenance, a backbiting tongue.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Rashi himself explains there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תחולל - תבטל, כמו \"לא יחל דברו\" (במדבר ל:ג) כדאמרי' ביבמות (דף עב.) דרוח צפון ברור הוא ומביא אורה לעולם מה שגשמים נעצרין ופנים נזעמין שמראה הקב\"ה שאינו מביא מטר לעולם מפני לשון שקר רכילות. ופשט המקרא כשם שרוח צפון תחולל גשם כך פנים נזעמים מפני לשון שקר:</p>\n<p>תחולל [means] \"it shall annul,\" as in \"he shall not <em>break</em> his word\" (Numbers 30:3)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbeinu Yonah (שערי תשובה ג ריב, cited <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8:%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%9B%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) also interprets תחולל in the verse as <em>preventing</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כאשר רוח צפון תפזר עננים ותמנע הגשם - כן פנים נזעמים ימנעו לשון הרע, כי בראות המגיד את פני השומע והנם זועפים, יחדל קול המון גשם דבריו\"</p>\n<p>Just as a north wind scatters the cloud and prevents the rain - so too an angry countenance prevent wicked speech, for as the relater sees the face of the listener that they are enraged...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the seemingly related root in בראשית ד:כו</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָז <strong>הוּחַל</strong> לִקְרֹא בְּשֵׁם ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which is also interpreted with roughly opposite meanings (see e.g. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%93_%D7%9B%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi vs. Ibn Ezra</a>).</p>\n<p>That said, assuming I am interpreting the site correctly, <a href=\"https://www.windfinder.com/#9/31.9522/35.3705\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WindFinder.com</a> seems to happen to be showing (as I am typing this) a wind blowing roughly from the north/northwest into Israel that should be carrying moisture from the Mediterranean:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zx8q4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zx8q4.jpg\" alt=\"IsraelWinds from Northwest\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Targum Proverbs provides the key to understanding <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2025%3A23&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 25:23</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon Project</a>, this verse appears as follows in the Targum.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רוחא       גרביתא      בטנא        דמטרא       היכנא       אפי     קניסתא  ולישנא      משטיא   ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The literal translation from Aramaic would appear as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The north wind is pregnant (writhes and twists in pain) because of the rain; likewise the vindictive face, and the tongue by acting stupid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another alternate reading (variants) for the same verse according to the same source would be the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The north wind is pregnant (writhes and twists in pain) because of the rain; likewise the face seething with anger, and the tongue by lying in wait to attack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea is that the rain causes the north wind to twist and turn like a woman writhing in labor pain; so too the stupidity of the tongue causes the face of another to twist and turn with vindictiveness and anger.</p>\n<p>The Targum therefore helps us to understand the Biblical Hebrew for the same verse, or at least how the rabbis translating into Aramaic had understood the grammar of the Biblical Hebrew for this verse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2025%3A23&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 25:23</a> (Masoretic Text)</p>\n<p>ר֣וּחַ צָ֭פוֹן <strong>תְּח֣וֹלֵֽל</strong> גָּ֑שֶׁם וּפָנִ֥ים נִ֝זְעָמִ֗ים לְשׁ֣וֹן סָֽתֶר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The word in bold is the triliteral root verb <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=nasb&strongs=h2342\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חיל</a></strong> (<em>khül</em>), which is in the pôlēl stem, which is a rare in Biblical Hebrew. According to Heiser & Setterholm (2013), we read the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>pôlēl</strong> — A rare Hebrew stem that is actually the piʿʿēl stem for middle waw/yoḏ (‘hollow’) verbs. Note that these middle waw/yoḏ (‘hollow’) weak verbs mimic geminate verbs in the pôʿēl stem by repeating the third consonant. The pôlēl corresponds in meaning to the piʿʿēl. As a stem associated with the piʿʿēl, the pôlēl may express the bringing about of a state. The object of the verb’s action “suffers the effect” of the action. See J.-M. §59a, §80h; BHRG §18.8.3.4; GKC §67l, §55c & paradigm M [note: GKC occasionally labels this as pôʿēl, though it does make a distinction between those forms which come from middle waw/yoḏ (‘hollow’) verbs and those from geminate verbs].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What makes this verb different is that the verb <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=nasb&strongs=h2342\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חיל</a></strong> (<em>khül</em>) is intransitive, which means it does not take an object. Thus the word for rain in this verse <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=nasb&strongs=h1653\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">גֶּשֶׁם</a></strong> (<em>gheh'·shem</em>) is understood as the agent by which the intense writhing in pain occurs. This approach to the grammar is why the rabbis who translated the Targum Proverbs made the northern wind to appear suffering <strong>because of the rain</strong> (and in parallel, why the face writhes in pain <strong>because of the tongue acting stupid</strong>).</p>\n<p>So the verb <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=nasb&strongs=h2342\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חיל</a></strong> (<em>khül</em>) in the pôlēl stem of Biblical Hebrew would not so much have the meaning of <em>annulling/preventing</em> but instead, <em>experiencing intense pain and anguish</em> (intransitive sense). The comparison to <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers%2030%3A2&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 30:3</a>, where the transitive verb <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=nasb&strongs=h2490\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חָלַל</a></strong> (<em>khä·lal'</em>) appears in the hifʿîl stem, and then comparing with the instransitive verb <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=nasb&strongs=h2342\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חיל</a></strong> (<em>khül</em>) in this verse (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2025%3A23&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 25:23</a>), which appears in the pôlēl stem, are not similar nor are they comparable: that is, they are two different verbs with two different meanings and in addition, they are in two different stem forms (not to mention that one is transitive and the other intransitive).</p>\n<p>In summary, the Targum Proverbs provides the key to understanding <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2025%3A23&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 25:23</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source:</strong><br />\nHeiser, M.

This is not a universal opinion, (even in Halacha, see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7653\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA EH 42:2</a>) as some allow for one witness if both agree - at least to not ignore the Kiddushin.</p>\n\n<p>The distinction between money (since the source for requiring two witnesses is money) is described in the Talmud - because it obligates third parties. That means that his relatives can't marry her anymore and vice versa (Rashi there).</p>\n\n<p>It is one of the most famous Yeshivishe discussions that the distinction here is that money the witnesses are Eidei Birrur - they clarify the reality, so that if we know via other means, such as the parties admitting, then it is the same thing. But when it comes to Kiddushin they are Eidei Kiyum - they make the event happen. Without them, nothing actually took place.</p>\n\n<p>A kesuba needs to be signed because without witnesses there is no property lien and that would limit her options to collect, and the Chachamim require her to have a Kesuba that satisfies her worries (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7297\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis Yosef EH 61:1</a> quoting the Ran, who also quotes and disagrees with the Rambam and Itur as it being just the Rabbis requirement of the Kesuba unconditionally, which would also seem to be the implication of the Tur there as understood by the Bach).</p>\n\n<p>Chuppa/Nissuin requires witnesses the same way Kiddushin does, under the same circumstances (because Kiddushin establishes the principle that witnesses are required to create the fact of the matter, and this applies to Nissuin as well - it doesn't happen without witnesses). So the way it is required for Kiddushin, it is required for Nissuin. I don't have a great on point source for that, but I found it in many discussions of the issue as a given. (In Yabia Omer (I don't have it to check exactly where) he tries to get out of that because that would mean that Sefardim aren't following the Mechaber's opinion and quotes some Rishonim who disagree, but he agrees that having witnesses has a good source).</p>\n\n\n",

Probably the shortest explanation of the difference can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifra%2C_Metzora%2C_Section_2.5?vhe=Venice_1545&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifra Metzora 2:5</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ושלח את הצפור החיה… אל פני השדה\" – שלא יעמוד ביפו וישלחנה לים, שלא יעמוד בגבת וישלחנה למדבר, שלא יעמוד חוץ לעיר וישחלנה כלפי העיר. \"על פני השדה\" – הא אם שלחה וחזרה לתוך ידו – מותרת באכילה.</p>\n<p>\"and he shall send the living bird (over/at the face of the field.\") He should not stand in Yaffo and send it to the sea.

He should not stand outside the city and send it towards the city. <em>Over the face of the field</em>: If he sent it and it returned to his hand, he may eat it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, it is somewhat more complex. According to the book \"<a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/understanding-rashi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Understanding Rashi</a>\" by Rabbi Yisrael Isser Zvi Herczeg, we have the following differention between the prepositions.</p>\n<p><strong>The Meaning of Preposition על.</strong></p>\n<p>Essay 33 in the <a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/understanding-rashi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">book</a> on Parshas Mishpatim titled \"Too many word in Rashi's heading\" in the second half notes that the preposition על has standard meaning <em>on</em>, <em>by means of</em>, <em>upon</em>, <em>with</em>, which <em>refers to physical placing</em>, as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.21.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 21:8</a> - על נס - on the pole.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Sometimes Rashi superfluously may include a preposition into his heading not only to clarify the word, but also an exception in the usage of a preposition.</em></p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.1.16?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 1:16</a>, על האבנים - upon the stools. When translated directly, it may mean that Pharaoh tells Shifra and Puah to observe birth on \"two stones\", i.e. stading on two stones. Rashi's comment is defining האבנים as a sitting place where a woman gives birth. It changes the meaning of על to <em>at</em>, i.e. Shifra and Puah had to watch <em>down at the place</em>, <em>in the direction</em>, where a woman gives birth, not their own location.</p>\n<p>Another example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.19?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 21:19</a>: על משענתו (lit., with that on which he relies) — i.e. his former healthy state and vigour. Regular meaning of משענתו\nis <em>his staff</em>, but as Rashi notes, it is not the meaning of the word in the verse. Therefore, the meaning here is <em>by his own strength</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The example in the question is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.15.4?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sh'muel B 15:4</a>. For the word עלי, Rashi does not give a comment, suggesting that there is no exception. We understand from the context that Absalom is talking about showing lavish affection, agreeing with the grievances of the person as if he is about to place the person <strong>upon</strong> his shoulders and carry on. Additionally, as we can see from the example in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifra%2C_Metzora%2C_Section_2.5?vhe=Venice_1545&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifra Metzora 2:5</a>, Absalom's usage of עלי indicates that it <em>was not obligotary for a person</em> to stay in the relationship with Absalom.</p>\n<p><strong>The Meaning of Preposition אל and Prefix ל.</strong></p>\n<p>Essay 34 in the <a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/understanding-rashi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">same book</a>, titled \"The Nuances of Prepositions\", discusses two prepositions אל and ל, both of which have a meaning <em>to</em>, i.e. coming close to something in some sense.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ba'al haTurim to Vayikra 10:6 shows that there is a difference between the two. R. David HaKohen Zupnik (1916 - 2007, an alumnus of the Mir Yeshiva in Europe) in <em>Kuntres Divrei David haKohein</em> shows that Rashi agrees with the comment of Ba'al haTurim.</p>\n<p><em>When the Torah uses אל for <strong>to</strong> the stress is on destination.

But your kin, all the house of Israel, shall bewail the burning that יהוה has wrought.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ba'al haTurim:</strong> He turned his face to Aharon and spoke facing him (פה אל פה). This is why it is written אל אהרון. However, he did not turn his face at Elazar and Ithamar, and that's why [the Torah] is not using preposition אל for them in this verse.</p>\n<p>In other words, Elazar and Ithamar looked at Moshe as Moshe was speaking to Aharon and also to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the suggested case of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.9.4?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 9:4</a> אלי means \"to me\" - just the physical location, meaning Ezra, i.e. <em>to join forces with Ezra</em> and not to receive his emotional or any other support by comparison with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.15.4?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sh'muel B 15:4</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>Different roots</p>\n<p>It's the difference between \"to me\" and \"upon me\".</p>\n<p>To vs on.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Would a Jew violate the prohibition to pronounce the name of YHWH by saying \"Yahweh\" and/or \"Yehowah\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Based on a previous post that the pronunciation of YHWH as a subject is not disrespectful to be asked here, I hereby ask these: </p>\n\n<p>1.) Are the pronunciation of \"Yahweh\" and \"Yehowah\" to be considered as not offensive by us, Jews, because both of these are \"invented\" (as someone put it) or can not be accurate or only \"best guess\"? </p>\n\n<p>2.) As a Jew, would I violate the prohibition to pronounce the name of YHWH, by saying \"Yahweh\" and/or \"Yehowah\"? (Normally, I simply say \"HASHEM\" or \"Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey\" inside or outside a Synagogue, when I come across YHWH in writing.)</p>\n\n<p>3.) Does the prohibition of pronouncing YHWH apply even if the pronunciation is wrong? Any and all answers (from an authoritative source) can be in relation or not in relation to the saying of a bracha. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Rabbi Ari Enkin wrote a couple of articles about this explaining why pronouncing these words would not be problematic.\nIn the first, <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/09/book-review-the-how-why-of-jewish-prayer/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a book review</a>, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is also an especially interesting chapter on the various names of God, their meanings and their usages. In one such discussion the author vigorously argues that the word “Jehovah” cannot possibly be a translation of the “Y-H-V-H” and hence there is nothing halachically problematic with referring to the religious group “Jehovah’s Witnesses” when appropriate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After some less than positive feedback, he wrote a <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/09/jehovahs-witnesses/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">longer essay</a> explaining his position:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rubin notes that the correct pronunciation of the Y-H-V-H- was lost during the Talmudic period. The name was used as part of the Temple Service during the First Temple period. During the Second Temple period the name was not used as it was feared that the name would be misused or articulated unlawfully. As a result of this disuse of the Y-H-V-H the correct pronunciation of The Name was lost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He quotes from Rabbi Rubin's book:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first [error] is the attempt to read the Y-H-V-H with the vowels that appear with it in the printed Tanach text. While the vowels are actually the vowels of the word Adon-oi, the Chataf Patach under the Alef of Adon-oi changes to a Shevah under the Yud of Y-H-V-H. The second mistake is that the English readers took the German transliteration of the mistaken reading –Jehovah- and pronounced the letter J as a J. In German the letter J is pronounced as a Y. Thus, the German really reads Yehovah. Nevertheless, whether you pronounce it as the Germans did or as the Americans do, the word Jehovah/Yehovah is total gibberish and has no sanctity whatsoever according to the halacha. Modern scholars introduced an equally erroneous pronunciation, again based on the German, of Yahweh. This word is also gibberish and has no meaning or legal standing. (The How & Why of Jewish Prayer p.531)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Following these two articles, R' Ari Enkin wrote <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2011/09/j-witnesses/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">an article</a> offering some challenges and some suggestions as to why one may want to be strict (and say 'J's witnesses', etc.) though no conclusion either way.</p>\n\n<p><em>Edited</em>\nIn a footnote, R' Ari Enkin wrote, \"even if it is indeed God’s name, the Shach (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5168\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD 179:11</a>) seems to say that God’s name written in a foreign language has no sanctity\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This question is multi-faceted.\n1. First off, outside of actual prayer or blessings, only the word \"Hashem\" or another such nickname may be used, even for other names of the almighty.\n2. Next, see RMB\"M who writes in the section on the Blessing of the Priests, that only in the Beis Hamikdash, up until a certain point, may the actual letters of the Name be pronounced, otherwise (i.e. nowadays) the name \"Adonoi\" must be used.\n3. As to the question as to the correct pronunciation of the Name itself, I believe that the questioner is correct to assume that it is not an exact science, and as such it must not be used at all.</p>\n\n\n",

There are kosher-certified wines available from France, Italy, Argentina, Spain, Australia, and the US, to name a few -- in all of those cases, there are Jews located there, making sure it's kosher. As long as you trust the certification, these are just as kosher as wine made in Israel (albeit they did not have the same tithing requirements). As many of these certifications are well-regarded, plenty of kosher wines are imported into Israel, with their French/Italian/Argentinian/etc. certifications then endorsed by Israeli certifiers. (It's similarly not uncommon, for example, if you're a US importer of Spanish wines, to talk to a US kosher certifier like the OU, have them check the Spanish kosher certification, and if they're satisfied, add the OU symbol, which the American consumer is used to seeing.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/21/shalom\">Shalom</a>'s <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/84772/501\">answer</a> is missing your request for laws of Orlah and Kilayim.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically:</p>\n\n<p>Orla: <br/><sup>(Source: Kitzur Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0172_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">173</a>)</sup></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most of the laws of Orla apply outside of Israel.</li>\n<li>Relevant to vines: if a branch of a vine was buried and a new vine grew where it protrudes, there is no problem of Orla on the new vine.

He is a bad person, but this doesn't interfer with marriage rules.If there is a special din derabanan against the Ybum, I didn't see (this is not a proof, but the duty to furnish a proof is for the hypothetical chiddush that he is prohibited to make Ybum). To make him potur from chalitsa is not a possibility for a din derabanan.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Hasidim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Hassidim</a> (ed. Margolios 365) brings several examples of this from aggadic literature. For example, the Talmud (Berakhot 18b) recounts that the Ammora Sh'muel ascended to the heavenly residence and requested that the Ammora Levi to be admitted, and his request was accepted. Similarly, the Talmud (Sotah 7b) recounts that Moshe prayed that Yehuda be admitted into the heavenly academy, and his prayer too was accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Talmud (Sotah 10b) states that David effectively prayed for the welfare of the deceased Avshalom.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifre\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sifrei</a> (Shoftim 210) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אומרים כפר לעמך ישראל. כשהוא אומר אשר פדית ה', מלמד שכפרה זו מכפרת על יוצאי מצרים. כפר לעמך, אלו החיים, אשר פדית, אלו המתים, מגיד שהמתים צריכים כפרה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, the elders of the city near which a murder victim is found, pray: 'forgive your nation Israel whom you redeemed'. 'Whom you redeemed' is interpreted as referring to the dead.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesikta_Rabbati\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pesikta Rabbati</a> (ed. Ish Shalom Piska 20 Parashat Mattan Torah) states that prayers are effective on behalf of the dead:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמא תאמר כיון שירד לגיהנם אין לו תעלה כיון שמבקשים עליו רחמים זורק אותו מגיהנם כחץ מן הקשת </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[It should be noted that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_Buber\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Buber</a> writes that this is a later addition into the Midrash, see his comments in the introduction to Pesikta D'rav Kahanna 7].</p>\n\n<p>This Midrash is quoted in various Ashkenazi sources, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_of_Worms\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rokeah</a> (217).</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, there are various Ashkenazi sources that advocate performing mitsvot on behalf the deceased, such as Siddur Rashi (214).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>However, this idea is not unanimously accepted. For example, <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10584-meir-ben-simeon-of-narbonne\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Meir HaMeili</a> (cited in Mesorah L'Yosef (Qafih) Vol. IV 2005, p. 105) encourages practices meant to benefit the dead, although they are difficult to reconcile with the idea that presumably people are judged upon death, and after that their status wont be changed, <em>specifically</em> since such practices will strengthen the fundamental belief in the afterlife among the masses.</p>\n\n<p>Even more clearly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_bar_Hiyya\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Avraham bar Hiyya</a> writes (Hegyon HaNefesh HaAtsuvah p. 4) that any acts or prayers on behalf of the dead are useless:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל החושב על מעשה בניו ובני עמו שהמ עושים בגללו אחרי מותוי \n  ומתפללים בעדו שהם מועילים לו מחשבת פתיות הוא ותוחלת שוא </p>\n  \n  <p>Anyone who considers that the actions of his children or his people, that they perform for him after his death, and they pray on his behalf, that they are effective for him, it is a foolish thought, and false hope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, the implication of Kohelet (9:5), (which R. Avraham bar Hiyya quotes), is that the after death one's fate is sealed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּ֧י הַֽחַיִּ֛ים יוֹדְעִ֖ים שֶׁיָּמֻ֑תוּ וְהַמֵּתִ֞ים אֵינָ֧ם יוֹדְעִ֣ים מְא֗וּמָה וְאֵֽין־ע֤וֹד לָהֶם֙ שָׂכָ֔ר כִּ֥י נִשְׁכַּ֖ח זִכְרָֽם </p>\n  \n  <p>For the living know that they will die, but the dead don't know anything, and they have no more reward, for their memory is forgotten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains (there):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל משמתו אינם יודעים מאומה ואין עוד להם שכר פעולה שיעשו מן המיתה ואילך אלא מי שטרח בערב שבת יאכל בשבת</p>\n  \n  <p>Once they die they know naught, and they have no more reward for activities that they do from death on, rather, one who laboured on the eve of the Sabbath, will eat on Sabbath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although most directly he is addressing actions by the deceased; not others, the implication is that only one who earn reward in this world will receive it. After death, it is too late. (Cf. however Siddur Rashi cited above. One can of course debate the strength of this inference. In a responsum (V:49) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ibn_Aderet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashba</a> cites this teaching as a problem for the view that one can improve the lot of the dead, but ultimately concludes that this teaching can be reconciled with improvement of the lot of the dead). </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Avot 4:17 states that one moment of repentance and good deeds in this world is better than the afterlife.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam elaborates: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאין אחר המוות שלימות ולא תוספת, ואמנם ישלם האדם ויוסיף מעלה בזה העולם...אלא במצב אשר ילך האדם - בו ישאר לעולם. ולזה ראוי להשתדל בזה הזמן הקצר המועט, ולא לאבדו אלא בקניית המעלות בלבד, לפי שאבדתו גדולה, הואיל ואין לו תמורה ואין לו תקנה. </p>\n  \n  <p>For after death there is no completion or addition. Rather, a person completes himself and improves in this world...Rather, in the state that a person goes [to the afterlife], there he remains forever. Therefore, it is fitting for a person to exert himself in this short time, and not waste it with ought but self improvement, since there is a great waste in this, since there is no replacement, for this, and no possibility for rectification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also the implication of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Sa'adya Gaon</a> who writes in HaNivhar BeEmunot V'deot (Ma'amar 6 p. 204) that repentance is possible while a person is alive, but after death, there is no possibility to cleanse the soul for past deeds, and no hope for such as thing, Proverbs (11:7) states, when a wicked person dies, hope is lost:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל זמן שהיא בגוף, אפשר לה לשוב להזדכך ולתנקות, ועל כן התשובה מקובלת בעוד האדם חי, וכאשר תצא ממנה אי אפשר לה להתנקות ממה שכבר יש בה, ואף אין לקוות לה מאומה מזה, כאשר אמר (משלי י\"א ז') במות אדם רשע תאבד תקוה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Presumably they <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53351/8775\">would reject</a> or reinterpret the above Midrashim.</p>\n\n<p>In this vein, regarding the Sifrei about the prayer recited with the heifer whose neck has been broken after a murder victim has been found, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Meiri</a> (Temurah 15) brushes off the idea of atonement for the dead as a mere proposal in the midst of a discussion, for true forgiveness comes through repentance. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (Hilkhot Rotseah Ushmirat HaNefesh 9:4) similarly reframes this as God forgiving the murder, rather than forgiving the dead, as noted by R. Eliyahu Nagar (Mesorah L'Yosef there p. 99).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Chalava\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharam Halawa</a> explains the Midrash about David praying for Absalom on the grounds that as the harmed party, David could effectively forgive Absalom for his actions. However, in general he maintains, (as we will quote below) that actions for the dead are ineffective.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Hai Gaon</a> rejects the idea that in general, one person's act can yield reward to a different party. This would seem to preclude performing practices to benefit the dead, but would not preclude the possibility that prayers for the dead could be effective. He writes in a responsum (Otsar HaGeonim Hagiga p. 28):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואיך יעלה על לב כי שכרו של זה שעשה זה לזה, והלא הכתוב אומר צדקת הצדיק עליו תהיה וכן אמר רשעת הרשע עליו תהיה כשם שאין אדם נתפס בעון זולתו כך אין אדם זוכה בזכות זולתו</p>\n  \n  <p>How could it occur to anyone that the reward for this that one person did would go to someone else? For the verse (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.18.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ezekiel 18:20</a>) states: 'the righteousness of the righteous shall be accounted to him alone' and it also says (ibid): 'the wickedness of the wicked shall be accounted to him alone.' Just as a person cannot be caught by the sin of someone else, so too a person cannot receive merit from someone else's merit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Chalava\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharam Halawa</a> also rejects the idea that actions on behalf of the dead can have any benefit, and his explanation would seem to preclude the efficacy of prayer as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין ספק בדבר כי לא יועיל ולא יציל מה שיעשה בשביל האדם אחרי \n  מותו כי כל אדם נדון לפי מה שהוא בעת מותו כי לפי מעלתו והשגתו \n  כשתפרד גופו מנפשו ישיג מעלה...ואין לה \n  תוספת מעלה ותועלת במה שיעשו אחרי כן להועילו ולהצילו מצרתו</p>\n  \n  <p>There is no doubt that that which is done for a person after his death will not help him or save him, for a person is judged according to his status at the time of his death, for according to his greatness and achievement at the time of the separation of his body and soul, does he attain corresponding degrees of reward...and the soul gains nothing whatsoever from what they do after his death to help him or save him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It should be noted that Maharam Halawa adduces proof for this position from the aforementioned Mishna in Avot, and Rambam's (aforementioned) explanation there.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Most of the above sources are culled from the 100+ page long article in M'sorah L'Yosef there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>“The <em>Tanna</em> and the Restless Dead,” outlines a method for alleviating the suffering of a sinner in <em>Geihinnom</em>.

One opinion in the Rishonim is this only had to do with animals brought as sacrifices (so irrelevant to our conversation); another is that it applies today, for any type of non-kosher animal feed; a third (which we apparently follow) is that the animal is rendered non-kosher only if its feed is so non-kosher that you can neither eat it nor derive benefit from it. See the Ramah and Shach on Yoreh Deah 60:1 (pdf).</p>\n\n<pre><code>אבל אם לא נתפטמה כל ימיה רק בדברים אסורים אסורה\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But if it was fed <em>exclusively</em> its whole life only food prohibited from benefit, the animal is prohibited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if it's given this meat-and-milk formula as well as other things to eat, it would be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>In the early 2000s the concern was raised that veal were being fed a formula that contained both meat and milk ingredients, cooked together. Rabbi JD Bleich's conclusion in a Tradition article (winter 2007) is that the way this meat-and-milk veal feed is made (among other factors) doesn't quite make it prohibited from benefit, only from eating, hence this problem would not apply; [the meat and milk in the formula weren't actually boiled directly together] however, he felt that if it took several paragraphs of nitty-gritty to explain why it's kosher, we shouldn't call it \"glatt\", which implies \"it didn't take a great rabbi to figure out that this is kosher.\" There's also some discussion about whether they \"finish\" the animals with a few days of different feed, and again there's been talk whether they've redone the formula in general to something without meat or milk.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do the best of doctors go to Gehinnom according to the Maharsha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Says the final Mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.82a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 82a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טוב שברופאים לגיהנם</p>\n  \n  <p>The best of doctors go to Gehinnom</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If your name is followed by MD, you may leave now. </p>\n\n<p>The Maharsha is puzzled by why this should be the case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש לפרש טוב שברופאים דהיינו שמחזיק עצמו לטוב ולמומחה שברופאים שאין כמוהו וסומך ביותר על המחאתו מתוך גאוותו ולפעמים הוא טועה בטבע זה החולה וממית את החולה ברפואותיו בדבר שמזיק לחולה זה אבל יש לו לישא וליתן עם שאר הרופאים כיון שהוא סכנת נפשות: </p>\n  \n  <p>There is to explain that “the best of doctors” refers to those who hold themselves in such high regard and expertise of the doctors that there are none like him, and he relies too much on his own experience because of his arrogance. Sometimes he will make a mistake in the natural way of things and will kill a sick person by trying to heal him with something bad for him. Rather, he should consult with other doctors regarding things that could lead to death. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems a little strange to me: At best, the doctor can only be faulted for accidentally killing a person. It’s not like he intended to kill the patient. Why should that outweigh all the (presumably) many more lives that he’s saved? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I am reminded of an insight I heard from R' Aharon Lichtenstein zt\"l.</p>\n\n<p>Shaul was assigned the job of killing all of the tribe of Amaleiq. He led a war that almost did it; but he left one person -- Agag, their king -- alive. Shemuel told him that as punishment, Shaul would lose the throne; he would be a one-king \"dynasty\".</p>\n\n<p>Rav Lichtenstein taught that it was not saving Agag that was the great sin that carried such a punishment. Rather, by not killing Agag, Shaul proved that killing everyone else wasn't to fulfill the mitzvah. If he wasn't following G-d's command to kill EVERYONE, then killing the rest of Amaleiq was simply genocide.</p>\n\n<p>I read the Maharsha you ask about similarly. Notice the Maharsha mentions two things: arrogance, and the inevitable mistake. If a doctor acted purely to help others, then he wouldn't be considered guilty for any mistakes. To the extent that a doctor acts for the sake of their own ego, the actions in which they erred also had that element of for their own ego. And they are guilty to whatever extent they harmed someone else out of a pursuit of self aggrandizement. Even if it's also along with other, purer, motives, that element of petty motive leading to harm needs purging in gehennom.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR- \"the best of doctors go to Gehinnom\" is ONLY referring to supremely haughty & arrogant doctors</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Lipschitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiferes Yisrael</a></strong>  writes about this <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kiddushin.4.14?lang=bi&p2=Yachin_on_Mishnah_Kiddushin.4.77.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in his commentary</a> to the last mishnah of Maseches Kiddushin.<br />\nHe begins by stating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>נ\"ל דאין מאמר זה גנאי לרופא רק שבח הרופא המומחה</strong></p>\n<p>This statement [\"the best of doctors go to Gehinnom\"] isn't embarrasing for a doctor- on contrary! It's to <strong>praise</strong> the doctor</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Tiferes Yisrael</strong> then brings up a lengthy parable (which will be used to make his point later):</p>\n<h2>Parable: a king dispatched a calligrapher to draw Moshe Rabbeinu's face so his advisors could deduce what kind of person Moshe was</h2>\n<p>After Moshe Rabbeinu took the Jews out of Egypt, the nations of the world wondered who was this person that had all these great miracles done for him. One person-- the King of <em>Aravi</em>-- was eager to find out and dispatched an expert calligrapher/ facepainter to draw Moshe's face and bring back to him for his expert advisors to decipher. When the artist returned with the drawing, the king gathered all his wise men and told them to tell what Moshe's face depicted to learn his nature and character traits. All of the wise men responded: <strong>\"this guy is arrogant, craves money, and is deeply flawed.\"</strong> The king was aghast, didn't believe it and drove his chariot into the camp of Israel to see Moshe for himself. Upon seeing Moshe he was taken aback because the artist's drawing was an exact rendering of what Moshe looked like (and thus so were his advisors categorizations of Moshe). The king couldn't believe it and told this to Moshe, to which Moshe replied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You're advisors and sages are right- for had I not been involved in being an Eved Hashem, I would be all the things they said. However I conquered all those traits of mine and channeled them into being a man of God, therefore for this I cherished and honored the heavens above and in the earth below. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Tiferes Yisrael</strong> takes this idea and applies it to \"the best of doctors go to Gehinnom\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועל פי זה נבין היטב שבח הרופא ממאמר זה. ש\"מ שהטוב הזה אין כוונתו כשר, <strong>רק מי שחושב את עצמו שהוא המומחה היותר טוב שברופאים, הוא מעותד לגיהנם. דבגאותו זאת סומך על ידיעתו בספק ואינו מתיעץ עם חביריו, כראוי למי אשר בפיו ובקולמסו מונח חיים או מות.</strong> וגם ברוב גאונו אינו מסתפק שמא יטעהו דמיונו, ואינו חושש לעיין היטב בספרי הרפואות קודם שיתן להחולה סמי רפואה קודם שידע מהן שלא יוכלו להזיקו כראוי, לילך לאט לאט בענייני סכנת נפשות.</p>\n<p>In this sense, we can well understand how the doctor is praised [in our mishnah], [...] we can learn from here that \"the best\" referred to in our mishnah isn't referring to his skills, <strong>rather it's referring only to a supremely arrogant doctor who thinks he is the top expert of all the doctors-- that's the doctor who's going to go to Gehinnom. Since due to his arrogance, when in doubt- he relies solely on his own knowledge instead of consulting with his colleagues, and he believes only his words will determine whether a person will die.</strong> And also in his \"abundant\" expertise he doesn't think he'll be mistaken, isn't worried about studying medical textbooks before he administers (potentially harmful) medicine that may not treat the patient properly and in fact put him in a life-threatening situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> To be a doctor, one needs tremendous wisdom, creativity, and diligence etc... as well as some potentially less savory traits. <strong>Moshe Rabbeinu also had a lot of potential flaws, but didn't give into them and instead channeled them for the good.</strong>  \"The best of doctors go to Gehinnom\" is only referring to doctors who utilize their gifts and traits in an arrogant, careless, and haughty manner.</p>\n\n\n",

I have a place to stay the other nights and I just need a room over shabbat. The problem is that by the time shabbat ends, checkout time is long passed. I don't need a room for Saturday night, but I can't think of any way to checkout of the hotel in time for that. Even if checking out is as simple as telling the front desk and doesn't require any <em>melakha</em>, I would still have to carry my stuff, which will include <em>muktzeh</em> down to the front desk for storage.</p>\n\n<p>This must be a problem that has been solved before.

I've found that most hotels are quite happy to accommodate your religious requests if you explain things in advance.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest idea is to prepay your bill. This is actually quite simple in many hotels these days, as they automatically bill your credit card, anyway, and sometimes either slip a paper bill under your door in the morning or email your bill. So, paying is essentially done.</p>\n\n<p>An electronic key is probably muktzah, anyway, and even if not, you couldn't use it to open your door. A manual key is not muktzah, so you can carry that around and submit it to the desk.</p>\n\n<p>As for luggage - you could request before Shabbat that someone move your luggage for you and if you wish, leave a tip in advance or tip after Shabbat. Almost every hotel will store the luggage for you, somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, amazingly, you may be surprised that a number of hotels don't mind you staying in the room the rest of the day. If you happen to be in a suburb or somewhat remote area, and depending on the time of year, not that many people check in on weekends! Whatever it is, if no one is checking into your room Sat. night, the hotel usually does not mind your staying in the room the rest of the day. I know few people think of this, but when you reserve or check in, ask the manager if they have a room where they won't mind your staying in it the whole day at no charge.</p>\n\n<p>In general, I think you can solve the main issues more easily than you think. </p>\n\n\n",

How do Jews understand this word in this context.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For reference, I am interested in the Jewish understanding. Christian commentaries interpret it as a reference to Leviticius 26. i.e. From the Word Biblical Commentary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The mention of Yahweh’s “standards” (משׁפטים) and “rules” (חקות) corresponds to the regular phraseology in the Priestly source of the Pentateuch, as the list of OT comparative usage in M. Weinfeld’s Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic School (Oxford: Clarendon, 1972) 337 shows. More specifically, the clause “they have rejected my standards” seems to be an allusion to Lev 26:3, 15, which speak of the Israelites, in the second plural, as rejecting, rather than walking in, God’s rules. The abrupt change to a plural verb reflects lack of adjustment of the literary reference (cf Reventlow, Wächter 7–9; Greenberg 111; Rooker, Transition 62; see the Excursus following 6:1–14). The implicit understanding of Jerusalem in terms of its citizens underlies the survival of the plural form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Our sages usually divide mitzvos, G-dly commands found in the Torah, into three categories (see for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.20?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban on Devarim 6:20</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Deuteronomy.6.20.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno ad. loc</a>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Eidut <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.20?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(testimonies)</a></li>\n<li>Mishpatim <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Deuteronomy.6.20.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(practical laws)</a></li>\n<li>Chukim (ordinances/decrees; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.19.2?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">It is an enactment from before Me; you have no right to criticize it)</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Mishpatim, e.g. the practical laws, are laws that are rational laws.

These invariably relate to the supernatural matters described in the Torah. Examples of these mitzvos ares: Shabbos, or eating matzah on Pesach etc...</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_The_Four_Sons.2?vhe=Pesach_Haggadah&lang=bi&p2=Kos_Eliyahu_on_Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_The_Four_Sons.2.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kos Shel Eliyahu</a>, a commentary on the Pesach Haggadah written by Rabbi Eliyahu Ben Harush gives us another explanation of what Eidut are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Testimonies (edut) are those practices which testify to the haste with which the redemption took place, such as the matzah which did not have time to rise because the Israelites left so quickly from Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, Eidut - Testimonies - are mitzvos that remind us of what G-d did for us (mostly in Egypt) (see: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_The_Four_Sons.2?vhe=Pesach_Haggadah&lang=bi&with=Commentary%20ConnectionsList&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maarechet Heidenheim</a> by Rabbi Tevele Bondi).</p>\n<p>Mishpatim are laws that can also be found in nations. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.30.15?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash</a> says that a king will uphold laws in his nation. These laws are commonly known as \"Civil Laws\" - these are the Mishpatim of a nation.</p>\n<p>Mishpatim convey the message that we need to behave like how we want to be treated by others. We don't want to be robbed, so we cannot steal. If some of our objects are lost, we expect, and truly wish that other people will bring back that objects to us.</p>\n\n\n",

There are plenty of capital crimes; why are these nine special that they get the additional phrase of “destroying evil”? Further, why are two of them switched from “destroying evil from your midst” to “destroying evil from Israel”?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To start off, there is actually a third case where the Torah says מישראל rather than מקרבך. In Devarim 19:13, in reference to a murderer, the Torah says ובערת דם הנקי מישראל.</p>\n\n<p>In his commentary to 22:22, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Simcha_of_Dvinsk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Meir Simcha of Dvinsk</a> explains why the Torah switches between מקרבך and מישראל. He states that when the Torah says to remove evil \"from your midst\" that would not necessarily be limited to Jews. If there was a <em>ger toshav</em> that committed the crime in question then the Torah would be obligating the Jewish courts to deal with the perpetrator, even though he is not Jewish. </p>\n\n<p>However, we know (as ruled by Rambam in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=83&perek=10&halocha=11&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Melachim 10:11</a>) that the Jewish courts are only obligated to make sure that there is a court system for the non-Jews, but not to actually carry out justice themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Now in the cases where the Torah says to remove the evil \"from your midst\" the crime is one that is only applicable to Jews. So there is no problem with saying \"from your midst\" which would imply that the Jewish courts have to enforce the law on non-Jews, because those crimes are only crimes for Jews in the first place. A non-Jew doing the same action would not be guilty of a crime and thus no punishment would be mandated to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>However, verse 22:22 speaks about adultery. Adultery is a crime even for non-Jews. Thus, had the Torah used the term \"from your midst\" in 22:22 it would in effect be saying that the Jewish courts are obligated to punish even non-Jewish adulterers. But as we said above, that is not true — they only have to make sure that there is a justice system set up to deal with them. Therefore, in this case the Torah had to tell us to remove the evil \"from Israel\", meaning to say that the Jewish courts are only obligated to punish Jewish adulterers.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, verse 19:13 deals with murder, which is also a crime even for non-Jews. So once again, the Torah could not have used the term \"from your midst\" because that would imply that the Jewish courts have to punish even non-Jewish murderers, which is not true. Therefore, here too the Torah said \"from Israel\" in order to limit the scope to Jewish murderers.</p>\n\n<p>As for 17:12, the reason there is a little different. The subject of that verse is the rebellious elder, the sage who contravenes the ruling of the Jewish court. If the Torah there had used the term \"from your midst\" you might have thought that the evil in question is only an evil perpetrated against the court, and, as such, the court can choose to forgive the rebellious elder. Therefore, the Torah had to use the term \"from Israel\" to inform us that this is in fact an evil perpetrated against Israel as a whole, for a rebellious elder contravening the court can tear apart the nation. Since this is actually an evil perpetrated against the entire nation, the court does not have the ability to forgive the rebellious elder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Meshech Chochmah Devarim 22:22</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובערת הרע מישראל.  בכולהו כתיב  מקרבך   דבמלת  מקרבך  לא נתמעט גר תושב  דכתיב ביה   בקרבך ישב ובאמת אין בית דין מצווים להרוג העו\"ג החוטא כמו שמצווים בישראל כמו שחשב רמב\"ם למצות עשה וכן כתב רבינו בהלכות מלכים חייבים בית דין לעשות שופטים לאלו הגרים התושבים (לדין להם על פי המשפטים האלו כדי שלא ישחת העולם  אם ראו בית דין שיעמידו שופטיהם) מהם  מעמידים (עכ\"ל)  הרי דבשופטים גויים סגי ונערה מאורסה ליכא בגוי וכן כולהו כמו בן סורר ומורה וכיוצא בזה לכן כתיב ובערת הרע מקרבך  אבל בעולת בעל איכא גם בגוי ובן נח שבא על אשת חבירו חייב מיתה וסלקא דעתך אמינא שגם על גויים  היינו גרי תושב מצווים בית דין להמיתו  לכן כתיב ובערת הרע מישראל אבל בגר תושב אין אנו מצווים  רק מפני השחתת העולם מעמידים להם בית דין שופטים אפילו מהם וכן ברוצח בשופטים כתיב  ובערת דם הנקי מישראל וטוב לך  הא בן נח שהרג חבירו אין מצווים בית דין להרגו אעפ\"י שבן מיתה הוא והא דבזקן ממרה כתיב ובערת הרע מישראל נראה דבא לרמז שלא נאמר שזו רעה והעדר כבוד השופטים ואם רצו בית דין למחול  מוחלים לו קמ\"ל שזו רעה חולי מתפשטת בכלל האומה הישראלית  שאם לא יבטל היחיד דעתו להרוב הגדולים באומה במקום האלקי תרבה הרעה ויעשו בני ישראל אגודות אגודות ויתפרד הקשר האמיץ אשר בו יתוארו גוי אחד בארץ ואם כן אין בכוח בית דין למחול וכן תנו רבנן סנהדרין פח  ב על זקן ממרה לא הודו לו  כדי שלא ירבו מחלוקות בישראל  כי כבוד האומה וקיומה אין בידם למחול וכמו מלך שמחל על כבודו דאינו מחול  כי כבודו הוא כבוד האומה וזה חלק גדול מכחות התאוה להיות מצויין וממציא דרך חדש ולהבדל מן הכלל השם ישמרנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Fortunately someone once pointed me to a Meshech Chochma, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meshech_Hochma%2C_Ki_Tetze.33?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seen here</a>, who addresses the same observation you had in Ki Seitzei 22,22. </p>\n\n<p>The Meshech Chachma has an intricate approach seen below, where he explains that the phrase ובערת הרע מישראל is coming to teach us that Beis Din does not kill a Ger Toshav for this sin.

The Gemara raises an objection: A person should not hold phylacteries in his hand or a Torah scroll in his lap and pray while doing so...And Shmuel said: With regard to a knife, a bowl full of food, a loaf of bread, or money, these items are similar to those mentioned above. Why, then, is that not the case with regard to lulav? The Gemara answers: There, in the cases listed above, they are not related to performance of a mitzva, and he is preoccupied with them (which distracts his focus from his prayers). Here, in the case of the four species, they are related to performance of a mitzva, so he is not preoccupied with them (in a manner that will distract him from his prayers).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi explains since he is concerned lest these items fall from his hand, he is distracted and he unable to concentrate on his prayers.</p>\n\n<p>This is codified in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.5.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Hilchos Tefillah 5:5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.96.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 96:1</a>.

If the child is crying and you are in middle of davening, you can sign to him to try to get him to stop without talking out, but if that doesn’t work and his crying is disturbing you, you can go somewhere that the child will not disturb you (Sharei Teshuva 104-1). If need be, you can also walk over to the child and quiet him without talking out (Tefila Khilchos 12 footnote 200 in the name of R’S. Z. Auerbach zt”l).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the other parts of davening, see M:B 96-1, who brings the Pri Megadim that we may also not hold something in our hands during Pesukei D’zimra and Shema, (See Ishei Yisroel 11 ftnt. 64 in the name of Horav C.

Isn’t that enough?”</p>\n  \n  <p>“It is not,” answered Rabbi Dayan. “The Mishnah (Makkos 5b) teaches\n  that if one witness in a group is found to be a relative or otherwise\n  disqualified from testifying, the entire testimony is void. This is\n  similar to the saying ‘One rotten apple spoils the whole bunch.’”</p>\n  \n  <p>“Rebbi and Rav Yossi dispute whether this rule applies also to\n  monetary issues,” continued Rabbi Dayan. “The accepted halachah is in\n  accordance with Rebbi that it applies also to monetary testimony”\n  (C.M. 36:1).</p>\n  \n  <p>“Then how can anybody ever testify?” asked Asher. “In many instances\n  relatives are present!”</p>\n  \n  <p>“A relative disqualifies others only if he intended to serve as a\n  witness with them,” replied Rabbi Dayan. “However, if he saw the event\n  but had no intent to serve as a witness, he does not void the\n  testimony of the other qualified witnesses. Furthermore, while the\n  Rambam, Shulchan Aruch and Shach (36:8) maintain that the relative\n  voids through intent alone, Tosafos and the Rema maintain that he\n  voids the other witnesses only if he actually came and testified.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Part of the discussion can be found in kesuvos 73b. However, it is not necessarily a simple case. In fact, many cases will have a get issued in order to avoid the complexities, though this causes problems if the woman wants to marry a kohen.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, Rabbi Hershel Shachter writes <a href=\"http://daattorah.blogspot.com/2013/12/rav-herschel-schacter-ridiculous-heter.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Making a Farce of the Halacha</a> discusses the situation in which someone attempts to use the concept of <em>mekach taus</em> to free an agunah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is important to keep in mind that Rav Moshe Feinstein clearly\n  states that the negative condition must be preexisting and so severe\n  that no reasonable person would tolerate it - and the spouse must\n  leave immediately upon discovering it. In addition a psak of mekach\n  taus based entirely upon negative reports from the wife - without the\n  husband being directly evaulated by a neutral expert therapist - is\n  clearly invalid and indicative of biased poskim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He states</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Furthermore, kiddushin (entering into a marriage) apparently requires\n  a level of da'as even higher than mekach u'memkar (see the famous\n  comment of the Ran to Nedarim 87a. See also Beis Yitzchak 5748, pg.\n  241). In order to nullify a marriage by reason of kiddushei ta'us\n  (because of lack of da'as), one would presumably require an even more\n  obvious ta'us than what might be sufficient to invalidate a purchase\n  of stocks or a sale of real estate. Indeed, the Talmud (Kesubos 73b)\n  describes certain cases that based on the general principles of ta'us\n  would qualify as kiddushei ta'us and as such would be invalid and\n  should not need a get.

    "content": "# Halacha that a woman may not speak to her husband in the presence of others\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I found this in the Rashi on Ki Seitzei (Deuteronomy 22:16): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the girl’s father\n  shall say [to the elders]: [The father, but not the mother.] <strong>This\n  teaches us that a woman is not permitted to speak in the presence of\n  her husband [when others are present]</strong>. — [Sifrei 22:91]      ואמר אבי\n  הנערה: מלמד שאין רשות לאשה לדבר בפני האיש:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had never heard of this idea in Jewish law. Does such a halacha exist, and what is its status today? I am most interested in sources which discuss whether and to what extent this particular detail must actually be observed in our era.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Torah Temimah suggests that this is an extension of the law brought in the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952889/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-Fifteen.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchos Ishus 15:20</a> (emphasis on the part that he quotes):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן צוו על האשה שתהיה מכבדת את בעלה ביותר מדאי ויהיה עליה מורא ממנו ותעשה כל מעשיה על פיו. <strong>ויהיה בעיניה כמו שר או מלך</strong> מהלכת בתאות לבו ומרחקת כל מה שישנא. וזה דרך בנות ישראל ובני ישראל הקדושים והטהורים בזיווגן. ובדרכים אלו יהיה ישובן נאה ומשובח: </p>\n  \n  <p>And similarly, they commanded a woman to honor her husband exceedingly and to be in awe of him. She should carry out all her deeds according to his directives, <strong>considering him to be an officer or a king</strong>. She should follow the desires of his heart and shun everything that he disdains.\n  This is the custom of holy and pure Jewish women and men in their marriages. And these ways will make their marriage pleasant and praiseworthy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Included in the idea of a husband being a \"king\" to his wife would be \"respectful\" actions including not speaking in his presence (the Torah Temimah also compares this to the opinion that a woman doesn't lean during the Seder on Pesach in the presence of her husband for the same reason).</p>\n\n<p>In as much as that Rambam is accepted in Halacha today, then yes, the Halacha that a woman can't speak in front of her husband applies too. However, as the family dynamic and spousal relationship nowadays isn't applied as written in the Rambam, this Halacha would likely be applied differently as well.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>\"And the girl’s father shall say [to the elders]: [The father, but not the mother.] This teaches us that a woman is not permitted to speak in the presence of her husband [when others are present]. — [Sifrei 22:91] ואמר אבי הנערה: מלמד שאין רשות לאשה לדבר בפני האיש:\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Above is the OP's version of the Rashi in question.</p>\n\n<p>First of all (even though this entry comes from Chabad.org; and I am from Chabad) this version of Rashi and its translation plus bracketed comments is misleading and mistaken IMHO.</p>\n\n<p>Lets stick with the simple text of Rashi and then examine it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>\"And the girl’s father shall say:\" This teaches us that the woman is not permitted to speak \"before\" the man. (Sifrei 235)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rashi actually uses no words of his own. He simply picks some words of the verse to comment on; and then quotes the Sifrei verbatim, without any explanations.</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean?</p>\n\n<p>The Sifsei Chachamim (note 100) comments on Rashi as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1) The wife/mother is also standing here in the court. Yet, only the father is  speaking to the court to verbalize his claim. This teaches us that \"the woman is not permitted to speak \"before\" the man.\"</p>\n\n<p>2) The Sifrei means that the girl should not be the one to lay out her claim against her husband's slander. Otherwise, the verse should have said that the girl speaks to the court etc.</p>\n\n<p>The Mizrachi adds to #2 that we would expect the accused girl to be the one to respond in court here (not her proxy: father/mother). Since the Torah specifically shows the father speaking, we see the proof for the Sifrei that it is inappropriate for her to lay out her own defense and accusations against her estranged husband.</p>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra adds that her parents stand for her if they are alive. If not, the court appoints a representative for her.</p>\n\n<p>Now going with the #2 approach, the Sifrei may not be saying anything about women speaking or not speaking in front of their husbands at all? It could be that since this young girl might eventually go back to her husband, the less she fights with him in open court, the easier their reconciliation will be? Maybe the Sifrei is merely echoing the general Talmudic concept, that women (especially a young girl) should be allowed to avoid court proceedings as much as possible because of \"tznius\" (modesty). Perhaps she is simply being shielded from having to face her abusive husband directly? Perhaps all three? I have not found proof to anything specific here, but it does not prove a code of silence being imposed upon wives in front of their husbands in Halachah.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we take the #1 explanation of the Sifsei Chachamim above (which excludes the mother from speaking before her husband) we still have no proof that women in general, may not speak in front of their husbands.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban explains that the reason the father speaks exclusively here, is because the monetary fine belongs to him should he win. This is something the mother has no claim to. Therefore, court etiquette has the father presenting the claim. The mother, would not be expected to appear in court in any case. However, since the mother is assumed to have been the parent who was highly involved in the wedding proceedings, she would have been the one to preserve the bed sheets in her possession. Therefore she is here in court and is involved in producing the evidence. </p>\n\n<p>So, the Ramban has no code of Halachah here that states women may not speak in front of their husbands. However, he also does not even quote the Sifrei or its conclusion. Rashi does. </p>\n\n<p>So, if Rashi did make his comment in line with the Sifsei Chachamim's #1 (excluding the mother from speaking), then does Rashi hold that women may not speak in front of their husbands Halachically?</p>\n\n<p>Sefaria.org also translated Rashi with its own bracketed comments, as opposed to the explanation proposed by Chabad.org:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"... this teaches that a woman is not allowed to speak in the presence of her husband (<em>if he, too, is concerned in the matter</em>).\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>This implies that if he is not concerned, she may speak in front of him.</p>\n\n<p>Sefaria's version of the Sifrei actually has the following alternate reading:</p>\n\n<p>ואמר אבי הנערה אל הזקנים. מכאן שאין רשות לאשה לדבר במקום האיש</p>\n\n<p>\"This teaches that a woman is not allowed to speak in \"place\" (meaning instead of) of her husband.</p>\n\n<p>If we accept this understanding of the Sifrei, then the only time a wife should not speak before her husband is in a special case like a court of law, where she is supposed to be present, but her husband as head of household is the one to be the leader and lay out a defense on behalf of the family in front of the judges.</p>\n\n<p>However, she certainly may speak to her husband in front of others and to others in front of her husband. Why can't she be social at a dinner party? </p>\n\n<p>Even the Torah Temimah can accept this distinction. He compares this Sifrei to the idea in the Rambam, that a wife should treat her husband like a king/officer in charge. That would apply when there is an official spokesperson for the family (husband). She would not \"but in\" ahead of him, and speak in his stead. </p>\n\n<p>This would be similar to Rashi's comment elsewhere on Genesis 24:50.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"And Laban and Bethuel answered and said, \"The matter has emanated from the Lord. We cannot speak to you either bad or good.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rashi: \"And Laban and Bethuel answered: He [Laban] was wicked and jumped to reply before his father.\"</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Lubavitcher Rebbe in his discourses on Rashi/Chumash, says that Rashi's purpose in his commentary, is to answer the question of a five year old child who sees something amiss in a Torah verse.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the child could easily ask us why the Torah has both parents coming and then only has the father speak? OR ask us why the girl is not speaking up for herself like any other case?</p>\n\n<p>Therefore Rashi searched through the words of our Talmud, and provided an answer that solves the child's problem. (This Sifrei, which shows us that the Torah chooses a situation where the parents must come together, but only the father speaks, answers that it is in order to teach us the lesson: 1) A wife shouldn't speak instead of her husband when addressing the court on behalf of the family OR 2) The young girl should not have to personally be directly involved if at all possible.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rashi will pick the opinion in Talmudic literature that best answers the 5 year old's question. This is regardless of whether or not that opinion is the Halachically accepted one. </p>\n\n\n",

He says (or rather approvingly quotes opinions that) you can't pasken from the Shulchan Aruch because of its brevity, and you first have to learn the Beis Yosef.

So he wrote his book to include the reasons and solve the problem.</p>\n<p>Note though that regarding things that aren't practical (that is don't apply in his times, like Halachos about the Sanhedrin, etc.) he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ט) לשלימות מלאכת הקודש הבאתי כל הדינים, אף שאין נהוגים בזמן הזה, כמו:\nדיני סנהדרין בסימן א, ודיני סמיכה בסימן ג, והמשא ומתן דביני נפשות\nבסימן יח, והדרישה והחקירה בעדים בדיני נפשות בסימן ל, וכל דיני הזמה\nבסימן לח, וכן דיני קנסות במקומות השייכים לזה. וכמו כן דיני כפל, ודיני\nארבעה וחמשה בסימן שנ ושנא ושנב, וכל דיני רוצח ועגלה ערופה בסימן תכה.\nוגם דיני ערי מקלט נתבאר שם בסייעתא דשמיא.</p>\n<p>י) וזה דרכי בדינים אלו: מקור\nהמקורות לזה דברי הנשר הגדול הרמב\"ם ז\"ל. ובמקומות שעל פי פירושי רבותינו\nרש\"י ותוספות נשתנו הדברים מדעתו הגדולה, או במקומות שהראב\"ד השיג עליו,\nאו משארי ראשונים – הבאתי דבריהם בלשון \"יש אומרים\", וכתבתי המקור בשני\nחצאי מרובעים. ואם היה לי איזה דבר חידוש בזה, רמזתי הדברים בקיצור נמרץ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To paraphrase, regarding those laws what he does is quote the Rambam and then add in \"some say\" when other Rishonim disagree.

    "content": "# Does an עירוב turn the area into a רשות היחיד for נזיקין?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I understand it, an עירוב (for carrying on Shabbat) works because it turns the whole area within it into one big רשות היחיד. Now if this is the case, do the laws of רשות היחיד for נזיקין apply (as opposed to the laws of רשות הרבים) when you're inside an עירוב? If so, how would that play out (for example, whose רשות is the area in the עירוב considered to be and how does that affect דיני נזיקין)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Apparently not. See Bava Kama Daf 81a - certain areas are out of bounds during part of the year only - and entering them then constitutes damaging them.</p>\n\n<p>For Shabbat they retain the same status all year round - probably a Carmelis.</p>\n\n<p>BTW: In Shabbat Dat 6b we see areas they can be private domains  for Shabbat and public domains for Tuma.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The short answer is no.  An eruv is a rabbinic enactment to ensure that a shared private domain is not mistaken for a public domain.  With regard to damages, the laws dependent upon whether or not the domain is private or public, depend on the specific rights of the damager and damagee. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# closing ark before gadlu, weekday Torah service\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was taught that in the weekday Torah service, the ark is closed as soon as the Sefer Torah is removed, so that when we bow for gadlu lashem iti, it is clear we are bowing to Hashem and not to the ark and its contents, lest it appear, cholilla, as avoda zara. Some old timers in the minyan are not satisfied with my explanation, and want to keep the ark open. Logic is not having any effect: the ark is always closed on Shabbat as well, and if we had no other Sefer Torah, would they still bow to the empty ark? I've been challenged to provide a halacha. Assistance appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A friend wrote:\nI have not found this question addressed in the law codes I usually check with. Here is my take on the matter of the ark open or closed for Gaddelu:</p>\n\n<p>The aron kodesh serves two purposes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It is the repository of Torah scrolls.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is the symbolic opening to a particularly propitious conduit for prayer.

    "content": "# Can a non Jew wear the tefflin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom my friends I want to clear my doubt when I go to temple mount can a non Jew wear a tefflin on his arm and forhead.Thank you Shalom.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is my personal view only.You should not unless you are in the process of studying for conversion. Tefillin are considered a sign of belonging to the Jewish people and serving Hashem. An analogy to this would be the fact that a nonJew is forbidden to keep all the rules of Shabbos completely, so that someone studying for conversion is required to violate the Shabbos in some way as long as the conversion has not been completed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However</strong>, it is not actually forbidden to do so and it is not the same as Shabbos. As can be seen <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2016/02/24/tefillin-for-gentile/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tefillin for Gentile</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I hope it’s not an offensive question but can a gentile use Tefillin\n  for prayer?</p>\n  \n  <p>Answer:</p>\n  \n  <p>Not offensive at all. While the gain in wearing them is questionable,\n  there is no prohibition for a gentile to wear tefillin.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sources:</p>\n  \n  <p>See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188355/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonidies, Yad Hachazaka, Laws of Kings, Chapter 10, Law 9-10</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there are those who state that while the Rambam says that it is not forbidden, even a nonJew studying for conversion should not wear an actual set of tefillin. There are even those who say that he should not even practice with empty batim.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/02/13/tefillin-for-non-jew/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tefillin for Non-Jew</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Could a person who is in the process of conversion wear Tefilin, is it\n  even preferable that he should, so as to get accustomed in the\n  mitzvot? Or just the boxes without the parchments?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Rambam writes that a non-Jew who performs mitzvos also receives\n  reward, and according to his reasoning, there is no apparent reason to\n  prevent a non-Jew from wearing tefillin.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, some authorities have written that a non-Jew should not wear\n  tefillin, based partly on the Radvaz (Melachim 10:9). See, at great\n  length, Ateres Paz, Vol. 2, no. 2. sec. 4.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that although the Maharil, as cited by the Rema (Yoreh De’ah\n  291:2) writes that one does not give a mezuzah to a non-Jew, his\n  concern was apparently for the non-Jew treating the scroll with\n  disrespect, and this will not apply to a non-Jew studying for an\n  upcoming conversion.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some give a non-Jew tefillin without parchments to practice on (Ateres\n  Paz, loc. cit., objects even to this), and there is room for leniency\n  even for actual tefillin (see Sha’arei Hora’ah, Vol. 5, p. 165, in the\n  name of Rav Chaim Kanievsky), though this is not common custom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The actual quotation from the Rambam is: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>9</strong> A gentile who studies the Torah is obligated to die. They should only be involved in the study of their seven mitzvot.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, a gentile who rests, even on a weekday, observing that day\n  as a Sabbath, is obligated to die. Needless to say, he is obligated\n  for that punishment if he creates a festival for himself.</p>\n  \n  <p>The general principle governing these matters is: They are not to be\n  allowed to originate a new religion or create mitzvot for themselves\n  based on their own decisions. They may either become righteous\n  converts and accept all the mitzvot or retain their statutes without\n  adding or detracting from them.</p>\n  \n  <p>If a gentile studies the Torah, makes a Sabbath, or creates a\n  religious practice, a Jewish court should beat him, punish him, and\n  inform him that he is obligated to die. However, he is not to be\n  executed.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>10</strong> We should not prevent a gentile who desires to perform one of the Torah's mitzvot in order to receive reward from doing so, provided\n  he performs it as required. If he brings an animal to be sacrificed as\n  a burnt offering, we should receive it.</p>\n  \n  <p>If a gentile who observes the seven mitzvot gives charity, we should\n  accept it from him. It appears to me that it should be given to the\n  Jewish poor for the gentile may derive his sustenance from the Jews\n  and they are commanded to support him if necessary. In contrast, if an\n  idolater gives charity, we should accept it from him and give it to\n  the gentile poor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Jews follow the teachings of the Torah which was taught to us by the master of all the Prophets, Moses, our teacher.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most concise sources to understand the Jewish view of Muhamned is from the censored portion of the Mishnah Torah by Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon in Hilchot Melachim, chapter 11 which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And all the doings of Jesus the Nazarene and that of that\n  Ishmaelite who came after him (<em>meaning Muhamned</em>) are nothing but to pave the way for\n  the King Messiah and prepare the entire world to worship G-d together,\n  as it says, “For then I will convert the speech of the nations into a clarified language,\n  that they may all call upon the Name of the L-rd, to serve Him with\n  one consent” (Zephania 3:9).</p>\n  \n  <p>How is this so? The world is now already filled with matters of the\n  Messiah and matters of the Torah and matters of the Commandments.\n  Knowledge of these matters have spread to the distant islands and to\n  the many nations of those with uncircumcised hearts. They discuss\n  these matters and the Commandments of the Torah. Some of them say\n  that these Commandments were once true, but have since been canceled\n  for our times as they were not meant to be observed for all\n  generations. Some of them say that these are secret matters and are\n  not as simple as they would appear, and the <em>“Messiah”</em> <em>(meaning Jesus or Muhamned)</em> has already come\n  and revealed their secret meanings.</p>\n  \n  <p>But when <strong>the true King Messiah</strong> will rise and succeed, and he will be\n  lifted up and raised aloft, they all will immediately return <em>(to the true service of G-d)</em> and will\n  know that <strong><em>their ancestors</em></strong> left them an erroneous legacy, and <strong><em>their\n  ancestors and prophets</em></strong> led them astray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rashi ad. loc. says that the figure is given just so that we know how long the Bnei Yisrael were enslaved in Mitzraim, as the enslavement didn’t start until Levi, the last of the brothers, died. </p>\n\n<p>But he doesn’t explain. </p>\n\n<p>Mizrachi there says that Levi was in Mitzraim for 94 years, and 210-94=<strong>116</strong> years. He doesn’t explain where that number comes from. </p>\n\n<p>Sifsei Chachamim quotes a tradition that all of the brothers were born within 6 years of each other, besides for Binyamin. Levi had to have been in the third year, as Reuven and Shimon were born before him. Thus, Levi was 4 years older than Yosef. </p>\n\n<p>As Yosef was 30 when he became viceroy (Bereishis 41:46), Levi must have been 34 at the time. Yosef became viceroy at the beginning of the 7 years of famine (41:32 indicates that it will start immediately - see Rashi there), and his family came down in the second year of famine (45:6). After these 9 years, Levi was 43. Subtract 43 from 137 to get 94. As above, subtract 94 from 210 to get 116. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As for the 86, Rashi to Shir HaShirim 2:11 writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כלומר שמנים ושש שנה של קושי השעבוד נגזרו עליכם והלכו להם משנולדה מרים הקשו המצריים שעבוד על ישראל ולכך נקראת מרים על שמררום</p>\n  \n  <p>That is to say: <strong>86</strong> years of harsh labor was decreed upon you and they went for them (?); when Miriam was born, the Mitzriyim increased the labor, and therefore she is called Miriam, on account of their embittering (shemarerum). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>Credit to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/84922/9682\">Yaacov Deane</a> for drawing my attention to this Rashi.</sup></p>\n\n<p>The number 86 comes from the fact that Miriam was 3 years older than Aharon (Tosfos to Bechoros 4a, from Shemos Rabbah 1:13); as Aharon was 83 upon leaving Mitzraim (Shemos 7:7), Miriam must have been 86. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>How about Rashi to Shir HaShirim 2:11 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>הגשם.</strong> שהוא טרחותו של סתיו חלף והלך לו כלומר שמנים ושש שנה של קושי השעבוד נגזרו עליכם והלכו להם משנולדה מרים הקשו המצריים שעבוד על ישראל ולכך נקראת מרים על שמררום:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.40?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 12:40</a> says explicitly that the actual servitude in Mitzrayim was 210 years.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>שלשים שנה וארבע מאות שנה FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS</strong> — Altogether from the birth of Isaac until now were 400 years, and we must reckon from that event, for only from the time when Abraham had offspring from Sarah could the prophecy (Genesis 15:13) “Thy offspring shall be a stranger” be fulfilled; and there had been 30 years since that decree made at “the convenant between the parts” until the birth of Isaac.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is impossible to say that this means that they were 430 years in\n  the land of Egypt alone, for Kohath was one of those who came into\n  Egypt with Jacob (Genesis 46:11); go and reckon all his years and all\n  the years of Amram his son and the whole eighty years of Moses, the\n  latter’s son, until the Exodus and you will not find that they total\n  to so many; and you must admit that Kohath had already lived many\n  years before he went down to Egypt, and that many of Amram’s years are\n  included in the years of his father Kohath, and that many of the 80\n  years of Moses are included in the years of his father Amram, so that\n  you see that you will not find 400 years from the time of Israel’s\n  coming into Egypt until the Exodus.</p>\n  \n  <p>You are compelled to admit, even though unwillingly, that the other\n  settlements which the patriarchs made in lands other than Egypt come\n  also under the name of “sojourning as a stranger” (גרות), including\n  also that at Hebron, even though it was in Canaan itself, because it\n  is said, (Genesis 35:27) “[Hebron] where Abraham and Isaac sojourned”,\n  and it says, (Exodus 6:4) “[the land Canaan], the land of their\n  sojournings wherein they sojourned”.</p>\n  \n  <p>Consequently you must necessarily say that the prophecy, “thy\n  offspring shall be strangers… [four hundred years]” began only from\n  the time when he had offspring. <strong>And only if you reckon the 400 years\n  from the birth of Isaac will you find that from the time they came\n  into Egypt until the time they left it, was 210 years (as alluded to\n  in Genesis 15:13).</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>This was one of the passages which they altered for king Ptolemy\n  (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 12:40; Megillah 9a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first 124 (210 less the 86 mentioned from Shir HaShirim) were not as harsh. After the last of the sons of Yaacov was niftar, things started to change for the worse and it was for this reason that Miriam was given her name. Miriam has a connotation of <em>bitterness</em> (מר). It is also worth noting that 86, the number of years that the bondage was bitter, is the gematria for אלהים which is the name of G-d associated with the quality of severity/judgement (גבורה).</p>\n\n\n",

Most famously, Ezekiel prophesied in Babylonia, and three prophets, Chaggai, Zachariah and Malachi, were members of the \"Great Assembly\" that led the people in the first years of the return from Babylon. Mordechai and Esther were also members of the long-lived generation that mourned the destruction of the First Temple and witnessed the building of the second. With the demise of that generation, \"prophecy departed from Israel.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In terms of your next questions, Jews mostly don't think of Jesus as he has no part in our daily way of living, so whatever his teachings might have been their are not relevant to Jews.

In discussing the issue of free choice, he addresses the question of whether the prediction that the Egyptians would oppress the Jews indicated that they didn't have free will. He claims that it doesn't since there was no indication of who in particular would sin. Rather, he claims that it is no different than God saying: \"In the future there will be people who sin and people who obey.\" That observation does not negate their free will. Similarly, other predictions that Israel would sin in the future do not indicate a lack of free will, for individuals are not named. In passing he writes that a general prediction that someone will sin, is no more problematic than <strong>the very prohibition against the sin, and the associated stated penalties. These would never exist if they would not be executed</strong>, but nevertheless, in no way undermine an individual's free choice. The following are his words according to R. Shilat's translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מזה, אומרו לאברהם: +בראשית טו, יג+ \"ועבדום ועינו אותם\" וכו'. אמרו: הלא תראה שכבר גזר על המצרים שיעשקו את זרע אברהם, ומדוע ענשם, והם מוכרחים, אין מנוס להם מלשעבדם כמו שגזר? ותשובת זה, שזה כאילו אמר יתעלה, כי העתידים להוולד - יהיה מהם ממרה ונשמע, וצדיק ורשע. וזה אמת, ולא בזה המאמר יחוייב פלוני הרשע להיות רשע בהכרח, ולא פלוני הצדיק להיות צדיק בהכרח. אלא כל מי שהיה מהם רשע - בבחירתו היה, ואילו רצה להיות צדיק - אכן היה, ואין מונע לו. לפי שההודעה לא היתה על איש איש, עד שיאמר: כבר נגזר עלי, אלא באה על הכלל, ונשאר כל איש בבחירתו על עיקר הטבע. וכן כל איש ואיש מן המצרים אשר עשקום ועשו להם עוול, אילו רצה שלא לעושקם - היתה לו הבחירה בזה, לפי שהוא לא גזר על איש שיעשוק.</p>\n  \n  <p>וזאת התשובה בעצמה היא התשובה על אומרו: +דברים לא, טז+ \"הנך שוכב עם\n  אבותיך וקם העם הזה וזנה אחרי אלהי נכר הארץ\". <strong>שאין הפרש בין זה ובין\n  אומרו: מי שיעבוד עבודה זרה - נעשה בו כך וכך, לפי שאם לא יהיה שם לעולם\n  מי שיעבור - יהיה האיום לבטלה, ויהיו הקללות כולן לבטלה, וכן העונשים אשר\n  בתורה</strong>, ולא בגלל מציאות דין הסקילה בתורה, נאמר שזה אשר חלל השבת - מוכרח\n  על חלולו, ולא בגלל הקללות יחוייב שנאמר, שאותם שעבדו עבודה זרה וחלו בהם\n  הקללות ההן - נגזר עליהם בעבודתה. אלא בבחירתו עבד כל מי שעבד, וחל עליו\n  העונש, +ישעיהו סו ג - ד+ \"גם המה בחרו בדרכיהם וכו' גם אני\" וכו'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Qafih's translation of the relevant line is quite similar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי אין \n  הבדל בין זה ובין אמרו שכל העובד עבודה זרה \n  נעשה בו כך וכך לפי שאלו לא היה שם לעולם \n  מי שיעבור היו כל האיומים לבטלה והיו \n  כל הקללות כולן לבטלה וכך כל העונשין \n  שבתורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Multiple people have looked at it, and all agree the first letter is an F, 2nd letter is E or O, 3rd letter is I, 4th letter is V, U or N, 5th letter is L or E. On the manifest there are no distinguishing characteristics between the V/U/N and the E/L letters. For example, Chave and Chane look identical, and I only know they are different because of my research.</p>\n\n<p>(2) The issued Certificate of Arrival (COA) transcribed the name as JOINE. The Petition for Naturalization has JANIS (clearly legible and written multiple times). The immigrant ancestor changed his name and wrote, \"JANIS AKA JACK.\"</p>\n\n<p>(3) Immigrant's father's death certificate lists his father (immigrants grandfather) as YANOH and JewishGenner's said it must have been a typo and should have been YONAH. (Grandfather known to be deceased at time of immigrant's birth.)</p>\n\n<p>(4) Immigrant's granddaughter thought immigrant's name was YONAH.</p>\n\n<p>I am beginning to think immigrant had a double-first name but I find nothing to support the pairing of Yonah and Feivel.

Let’s also say that we aren’t learning like the Rambam (Hil. Melachim 12:1) that, for the most part, the Messianic future will be the same as this world. </p>\n\n<p>Given these assumptions, we can follow the various sources about cool things happening in the future literally. </p>\n\n<p>One such source is Avodah Zarah 5a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא\"ר יוסי אין בן דוד בא עד שיכלו נשמות שבגוף שנאמר (ישעיהו נז, טז) [כי לא לעולם אריב ולא לנצח אקצוף] כי רוח מלפני יעטוף ונשמות אני עשיתי</p>\n  \n  <p>And R’ Yose said: The son of David will not come until all Neshamos are completed in the flesh, as it says (Yeshaya 57:16), “For not forever will I fight, nor until eternity will I be angry, for the spirit before Me will delay, and the souls I have made.” (Translation follows Rashi here and Yefeh Anaf to Koheles Rabbah 1:13.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So all souls are created. Great. Now what? The good and cleansed come back to life, the bad gets “judged” by the sun (Koheles Rabbah 1:11). What about future generations? There can’t be any more generations, as they have already all been born. But the Torah also commands us to procreate (Bereishis 1:28), and the Torah is eternal, never to become nullified. So what will be with the mitzvah of priah u’reviah, if bearing children is impossible?</p>\n\n<p>(Granted, people in this world are also exempt because they’re unable to have children. My question is if in the future that will be the case, worldwide.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Tosafos in Avoda Zara there s.v. Ein Ben David points out the contradiction between that statement and the gemara in Shabbos 30b which states that in the times of Moshiach women will birth 6 children at a time. Tosafos suggest that a new source of souls with new souls will come to be.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמא י׳ל גוף חדש ונשמות חדשות יהיו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Once that is done, and he can identify 70 others who are worthy of s'micha, the Sanhedrin can be revived. However, so far, the practical difficulties have proven to be too great to overcome whenever such an attempt was made.</p>\n\n<p>The current attempt (2004) has failed because the gedolim of this generation have not accepted the attempt.</p>\n\n<p>One could say that if there were someone who was accepted by <strong>everyone</strong> as worthy of semicha, the mashiach would have come already (two Jews, three opinions).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1172727/jewish/Sanhedrin-vehaOnashin-haMesurin-lahem-Chapter-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Sanhedrin veha`Onashin haMesurin lahem - Chapter 4</a> Halacha 11</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If there was only one judge in Eretz Yisrael who possessed semichah,\n  he should call two other judges to sit with him and they should convey\n  semichah on 70 judges at one time or one after the other.

Because the Jewish\n  people were dispersed, and it is impossible that all could agree. If,\n  by contrast, there was a person who had received semichah from a\n  person who had received semichah, he does not require the consent of\n  all others.

Maimonides' position -- \"all the scholars of the Land of Israel agree on someone.\"\nB.) Some variant on Maimonides' interpretation -- does it mean \"all\", does it mean \"most\" ... questions of wording. (When this was tried in Safed in the 1500s without consulting Jerusalem, the scholars there raised these questions.)\nC.) Elijah the Prophet is on the list of people who have \"real\" ordination, so when he emerges to herald Moshiach's coming, he can confer it then on others.\nD.) We don't know ... or we're waiting for God to figure this one out for us ... or it's something else.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the new Sanhedrin relies on A. (where Rabbi Halberstam was its nexus). If someone disagrees, they can easily claim B., just as the rabbis of Jerusalem did in the 1500s. (Though this time, they tried hard to consult all over Israel, unlike back then when they didn't bother asking Jerusalem.) C. is also certainly defensible, and some may just fall back on D. For any of these approaches, one could say about the contemporary Sanhedrin: \"they might be of full halachic strength, I'm not sure\"; or \"they're well-meaning scholarly individuals but I disagree with their halachic logic on this point\"; or something less polite than that. </p>\n\n<p>The point is that this really centers around a halachic question with multiple suggested answers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>In answer to one of your questions,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Has the Sanhedrin been halachically established today?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer is that there have been some modern revival attempts, although all times they were far from being a universally accepted thing among all Jews and were oftentimes short lived.</p>\n\n<p>Two famous revival attempts of the Sanhedrin were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Sanhedrin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">during Napoleon's European Conquest</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_attempt_to_revive_the_Sanhedrin#The_debate_stirred_among_non-Jews.2C_especially_Evangelical_Protestants\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">more recently in 2004</a> by a group of rabbis in Tiberius, including Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz.</p>\n\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin#Revival_attempts\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Wikipedia page</a> for further information.</p>\n\n<p>This of course, remains a partial answer since you mention the halachic grounds as to whether or not the Sanhedrin can be revived in this day and age (without the Mashiach, Beit HaMikdash, etc.)</p>\n\n\n",

Even though one has to make Kiddush where they are eating (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.273.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 273:1</a>), the gemarra says they would have guests eat and sleep in the synagogue. Today even though there aren't guests in the synagogue, in some places the practice continues (although some aren't happy with this practice, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.269.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 269:1</a>). While the Ran in Pesachim 19b says those that continue the practice hold it's a takanah that Chazal instituted, the Mishnah Berurah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.269.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 269 SK 5</a>) understands that it's a minhag.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, a person who doesn't have such a minhag, seemingly if they would make Kiddush in shul it would be a bracha levatala (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Pesachim.100b.5.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos on 100b</a>: והיכא דליכא אורחים סמוך לבהכ\"נ אין לקדש דהויא ברכה לבטלה).</p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12460/when-do-you-say-a-beracha-on-a-minhag/\">there is a discussion about making a bracha on a minhag</a>, I'm asking even if one would normally make a bracha on a minhag, what about where they don't have this minhag? If such a person, let's say is a guest at a synagogue where they do have such a minhag, if they ask him to make Kiddush would he be allowed? There is a concept of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Pesachim.4.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">following minhag hamakom</a>, but I'm wondering if it would allow making a bracha one otherwise wouldn't be allowed to make.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> it seems my example of kiddush in synagogue isn't  the best (either it's not a minhag but a takana, or even if it's a minhag it's not an individual's minhag but a congregation). Perhaps a better example is saying a bracha on hallel on Rosh Chodesh. Sefardim normally don't (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.422.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 422:2</a>) (although I wonder if that's dependant on making a bracha on a minhag...). What if a sefardi is asked to lead hallel at a synagogue that says the bracha? Can they? Should they?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> @DoubleAA confirmed my suspicion about Sefardim and Hallel being connected to saying a bracha on minhag. Per their advice, new scenario as an example for this question: <strong>An Ashkenazi who doesn't say Hallel on Rosh Chodesh being asked to lead Hallel at another synagogue. Can they say the bracha? Should they?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>For those who make Kiddush in Shul on Friday night (or Yom Tov night, though that is limited - not on Seder night, not on Sukkos, not on Shemini Atzeres (outside Israel)), there is a very real issue of a Brachah Levatalah. The solution (I have discussed this with my Rabbi and I have seen similar practices elsewhere) is one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If there are children present who are old enough to understand the concept of a Brachah before eating (or drinking in this case), the Brachah is made on their behalf. As I understand it, ideally the children (combined) should drink at least the majority of a Reviis - so 2 or 3 drinking little cups is enough, but if there is only one child then he/she should drink more than just one little cup.</li>\n<li>If there are no children present, then the person making Kiddush must drink the <strong>entire</strong> cup. Simply drinking a Reviis or most of the cup is not sufficient because it must be Bemakom Seudah. By drinking the entire cup (not sure how big that cup needs to be - our Shul has a fairly large cup) it is treated as a Seudah in and of itself, or at least enough to make it Bemakom Seudah.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The same rule applies with a Bris on Shabbos (or Yom Tov). Normally at a Bris, the Rabbi drinks a little sip and that's it. But on Shabbos right after Musaf, the Rabbi must have Kiddush Bemakom Seudah - and can't eat/drink anything (except perhaps water) without first making Kiddush. If the Bris is in the same room as the actual \"Kiddush\" for the congregation there is no problem. But if the Bris is in the Sanctuary and the \"Kiddush\" will be in another room, then the solution is for the Rabbi to drink the entire cup (and I have seen my Rabbi do that, and I confirmed that this was <strong>why</strong> he did that).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Based on my memory in dealing with hilchot brachot; no, you may not make the bracha if it's a bracha l'vatala for you(unless you move there). </p>\n\n<p>The reason is that one cannot violate a Torah or Rabbinic precept, even if others do so. One famous example is a Sephardi who finds himself praying in an Ashkenazi minyan on rosh chodesh where Ashkenazim bless on the hallel(while Sephardim don't). Since it is not his minhag to bless, because it is forbidden by the Torah(\"lo tisa et shem HaShem lashav\"), he is forbidden to make the blessing or even answer amen. Related, the Mishna Berura in Biur Halacha(don't recall exact place) suggests that answering amen to a bracha that one does not make, does not violate an issur(not that one should bless it; although most poskim rule not answering amen on such berachot. See Yalkut Yosef 422:2-5).</p>\n\n<p>However, if one settles into an area that does make the blessing(even though their personal tradition is not to), they may make the blessing if they choose to. A guest in the community, however, must adhere to their stringencies and <em>not</em> make the bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

And it would have had its throat cut with a proper <em>shechita</em> after Esav shot and killed it.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the descendants of Yishmael, who follow his practice, meaning the practice that Yishmael learned in his father, Avraham's house, it says in Chullin 39b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טייעי דאתו לציקוניא יהיב דיכרי לטבחי ישראל אמרו להו דמא ותרבא לדידן משכא ובישרא לדידכו שלחה רב טובי בר רב מתנה לקמיה דרב יוסף כי האי גוונא מאי שלח ליה הכי א\"ר יהודה אמר שמואל הלכה כרבי יוסי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Arabs came to the village of Tzikonia and gave rams to the Jewish butcher saying the blood and fat is ours and the skin and meat is yours.</p>\n\n<p>And Rashi explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>טייעי</strong> - ישמעאלים <strong>ואינן אוכלין אלא בשר שחוטה ואפילו היא מתה מאליה שוחט</strong> <strong>אותה לאוכלה וכן דרכן</strong>:\n  דיכרי - אילים:\n  דמא ותרבא לדידן - לעבודת כוכבים דמתוך שהיו טרודים בעסקיהן היו נותנין לטבחי ישראל לשחוט ולהפשיט:\n  <strong>כרבי יוסי</strong> - <strong>ומותרין</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These <em>Arabs</em> were Yishmaelim who only eat meat which has had proper shechita even if it has died. In this case, the Yishmaelim told the Jewish butcher that they wanted the blood and fat to offer in their religion and because they were busy in that, they brought the rams to the Jewish butcher to shecht and to skin. The butcher was to keep the skin and meat in payment for his services. The butcher asked Rav Tuvia bar Rav Matana is this was permissible and the reply was yes, it is permissible.</p>\n\n<p>Strictly speaking, an kosher, healthy animal which has been hunted and killed by a Jew does not appear to fit the definitions found in the Mishnah Torah, Laws of Forbidden Food, chapter 4, for <em>nevelah</em>, something which died on its own or <em>treifah</em>, something which a wild animal ripped apart but that hasn't died yet.</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 4:1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>הָאוֹכֵל כְּזַיִת מִבְּשַׂר</strong> בְּהֵמָה <strong>שֶׁמֵּתָה</strong> אוֹ חַיָּה שֶׁמֵּתָה אוֹ עוֹף שֶׁמֵּת <strong>לוֹקֶה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יד כא) \"לֹא תֹאכְלוּ כָל נְבֵלָה\". וְכָל שֶׁלֹּא נִשְׁחֲטָה כָּרָאוּי הֲרֵי זוֹ מֵתָה.</strong> וּבְהִלְכוֹת הַשְּׁחִיטָה יִתְבָּאֵר הַשְּׁחִיטָה שֶׁהִיא כָּרָאוּי וְשֶׁאֵינָהּ כָּרָאוּי:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One who has eaten an olive sized piece from flesh that has died is beaten, like it says in Devarim 14:21, \"You will not eat all <em>nevelah</em>.\" And everything whose throat is not cut properly is a dead animal.

You will toss it to the dogs.\" <em>The treifah</em> spoken of in this Torah has had a piece ripped from it by an animal of the forest like a lion or a leopard or something similar to them.

Thus, it is only speaking about when a piece is torn off and it hasn't died.</p>\n\n<p>It emphasizes that if the throat is not cut properly it is <em>nevelah</em>, meaning a dead animal from the species which are <em>tahor</em>.

Thus [the term trefe] must refer to an instance when it was mortally wounded, but did not die.</p>\n\n<p>\"struck by a sword\" is killed (הרג), not died naturally (מות), right?

In a nutshell</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a dispute whether shemita produce becomes ownerless through an active declaration of its owner or automatically (\"a dispensation of the King\") - the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bet Yosef</a> argues for the first, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_ben_Joseph_di_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mabit</a> for the second</li>\n<li>According to the Bet Yosef, if a gentile doesn't declare his produce ownerless, it is not ownerless and the produce is subject to <em>terumot</em> and <em>maasrot</em>. This view is accepted bt the Pe'at ha-Shulchan, R Kook, R Shmuel Zalman Auerbach, R Pesach Frank, R Ovadia Yosef</li>\n<li>According to the Mabit, produce growing during a shmita year is automatically ownerless and thus even the produce of a gentile is ownerless and therefore exempt from <em>terumot</em> and <em>maasrot</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>R Rimon writes that the accepted practice in Israel is that the produce of a gentile does not have shemita sanctity in accordance with the Bet Yosef, but in Bnei Brak many follow the view of the Chazon Ish who rules according to the Mabit.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>However</strong> R Rimon has the following to say on buying fruits and vegetables from gentiles during shmita years, in practice</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Despite all the above discussion, buying gentile produce is still not\n  a simple matter. Sometimes, and especially during the shemita year,\n  Jewish farmers sell their produce to Arabs in order to market it. Due\n  to security concerns, even careful supervision cannot always trace the\n  course of the produce, and it is often difficult to determine if it\n  was really grown by a gentile or sold to him by a Jewish farmer.</p>\n  \n  <p>Moreover, significant areas of land in Eretz Yisrael do not actually\n  belong to the gentiles working them, but rather the lands have been\n  illegally taken over by these gentiles from Jews. In such cases, the\n  land is not regarded as the land of a gentile, and the vegetables\n  growing there are subject to the prohibition of sefichin (Responsa\n  Maharam ben Baruch, no. 536; Torat ha-Aretz, vol. II, section 3).</p>\n  \n  <p>The\n  most serious problem with buying gentile produce, however, lies in the\n  fact that it strengthens the gentile hold on the land in Eretz\n  Yisrael. Even if from a strict halachic perspective this does not fall\n  under the prohibition of <em>lo techonem</em>, not granting gentiles a portion\n  in the land (an assumption which is not at all clear), the fundamental\n  problem underlying this prohibition certainly exists. [...] Without a\n  doubt, buying produce from gentiles undermines the idea behind the\n  prohibition of <em>lo techonem</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally you should note that R Rimon writes at length (p. 499ff) that <strong>one should make an effort to buy from Jews whenever possible and when the price difference is not too significant</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the other hand, giving preference to imported produce is liable to\n  cause Israeli farmers heavy economic losses, bring about the collapse\n  of many branches of agriculture, and lead to serious set-backs in the\n  process of raising the standards of shemita observance. The larger the\n  community interested in purchasing shemita produce the easier it will\n  be to employ the superior methods of dealing with the halachic\n  difficulties posed by shemita, such as Otzar Bet Din or hothouses and\n  container produce, or to improve the heter mechira so that it will be\n  executed in the most halachically preferred manner. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>The\n  Tosafot's fundamental approach is clear: there is no obligation to buy\n  from a Jew over a gentile when doing so would cause a financial loss.\n  According to the Tosafot in Bava Kama (114a), this applies to any\n  loss, no matter how small, whereas according to the Tosafot in Avoda\n  Zara (20a) , it seems that in the case of a small loss, preference\n  must indeed be given to buying from a Jew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, you didn't ask re</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>kashrut</em>: you need to be extra careful with insects since the produce won't have been checked</li>\n<li><em>trumot</em> and <em>maasrot</em>: you should ask a rav since you might need to take them without a blessing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Produce grown on arab land by arabs during shmittah is a machlokes. But, the situation you described is problematic for shmittah, kashrus, and terumas/meisers. I describe the details of shmittah status and your specific situation in detail below. </p>\n\n<p>Produce during shmittah falls into the following categories:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Produce from outside of israel. This produce has no shmittah requirements.</li>\n<li>Produce from israel grown on jewish owned land. This produce must be treated according to all shmittah requirements according to all opinions.</li>\n<li>Produce from israel grown on non-jewish land. Minhag y'rushalayim is to treat this as regular produce. Minhag bnei brak is to treat this as full-fledged shmittah produce.</li>\n<li>Produce from israel grown on land that was sold to non-jews for the shmittah year (aka heter mechira). This is a very problematic heter. For one, it is ossur to sell land in israel to non-jews, and two, it is likely that the sale is really a farce (if the arab doesn't want to sell back the land, what do you think the kibbutznik would do?! If the same arab decided they would not sell back someone's whiskey after pesach, the jew would simply request payment.) </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you don't have a reliable shmittah hechsher, you cant know where everything came from and if the laws of shmittah were observed. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding your specific situation:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Kashrus: The heter of eating cooked food that you would not serve to a king is only a heter in the cooking of the food. You still have no idea what kind of ingredients they put into it. We live in a generation where even simple foods have a staggeringly high number of strange ingredients. That is why you usually need a reliable hechsher.</li>\n<li>Shmittah: You have no idea where the nuts actually came from. That is why you need a reliable shmittah hechsher when relevant.</li>\n<li>Terumahs/meisers: Unlike produce outside of israel, all produce grown in israel is subject to terumahs and meisers <em>every</em> year. In order to be sure that these were taken properly, you always need a hechsher for produce in israel.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In my humble opinion, I would not suggest purchasing your treat from the arab shuk.</p>\n\n\n",

He answers that it can only be understood kabbalistcally.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> writes in Hilkhot Teshuva (6:1), however, that Deuteronomy (24:16) only means that adults (איש) are punished on their own merits, but a child may be punished for his parents' sins:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש חטא שהדין נותן שנפרעים ממנו על חטאו בעולם הזה בגופו או בממונו או בבניו הקטנים שבניו של אדם הקטנים שאין בהם דעת ולא הגיעו לכלל מצות כקניינו הן וכתיב איש בחטאו ימות עד שיעשה איש </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam's position is supported by the Sifrei Zuta to Ruth (ed Buber; 1:5) which states that until a boy is 13 he is punished for his fathers' sins; after that he becomes included in Deut. (24:16) and is only punished for his own sins:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ר' חייא בר אבא עד שלש עשרה שנה הבן לוקה בעון האב, מכאן ואילך איש בחטאו ימות </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yissachar_Shlomo_Teichtal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yissakhar Teichtal</a> suggests in Mishneh Sakhir (Parashat Korah s.v. V'datan Vaaviram) that in reality these children were old enough to have been involved in the dispute themselves. Thus, they were punished for their own sin; not that of their parents:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועיי\"ש פרש\"י בשם המדרש. ולי נראה עפ\"י פשוט עפ\"י המעשה דגם הנשים בכלל המחלוקת וגם הבנים והטף, וק\"ל </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The fact that the children of Dasan and Aviram stayed with their father was enough to include them in the sin.

So too, all decisions we make in our lives will potentially affect generations to come*</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara (Bava Kama 113b) explains that this Mishnah is in disagreement with the Mishnah cited in the question, about whether <em>davar she'eino mitkaven</em>--an unintended outcome--is prohibited or not. The Rambam, however, rules in accordance with both Mishnayot (Hil. Kilayim 10:16,18). Kesef Mishneh distinguishes between wearing--as in the case of the tax collector--which is forbidden, and merely putting on oneself, which is permitted. If so, without the Mishnah one may have thought this was permitted because it is <em>davar she'eino mitkaven</em> and we may not have distinguished between wearing and putting on oneself. It should be noted that while Shulchan Aruch follows the Rambam (YD 301:5), Rema (YD 301:6) rules against the Rambam and permits wearing the shaatnez to escape the illegal tax collector. </p>\n\n\n",

He explains: There is a presumption that a person does not restrain himself when faced with losing his money, and therefore this burglar must have said to himself: If I go in and the owner sees me, he will rise against me and not allow me to steal from him, and if he rises against me, I will kill him. And the Torah stated a principle: If someone comes to kill you, rise and kill him first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14458&st=&pgnum=137\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Nissim</a> (the Ra\"n, according to my class handout), writing in the 14th century, argues: surely not all thieves come with murderous intent; some would drop the stolen goods and run if confronted, and since theft is not a capital transgression the homeowner is not justified in killing the thief.  However, he continues, this concern is overriden by the fact that some homeowners <em>won't</em> restrain themselves, and all thieves know this and must accept it.  So since it's the thief who set everything in motion, the torah deems the thief a <em>rodef</em> and he can be killed.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Yerushalmi in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.43b.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 8:8</a> says: R' Shimon ben Yochai permits the homeowner to chase after the thief even after he leaves and kill him, because a person's money is as dear to him as his life.  Rav Huna says the homeowner is not guilty if the thief, while still in his house, turns to leave.</p>\n<p>hazoriz suggested the following additional sources in a comment (thanks!):</p>\n<p>The Rambam <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088876/jewish/Genevah-Chapter-Nine.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> rules:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><p>When a person breaks into a home - whether at night or during the day - license is granted to kill him. If either the homeowner or another person kills him, they are not liable.  The license to kill him applies both on the Sabbath and during the week; one may kill in any possible manner. This is all implied by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 22:1</a>, which literally reads: \"He has no blood.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The license mentioned above applies to a thief caught breaking in or one caught on a person's roof, courtyard or enclosed area, whether during the day or during the night. Why does the Torah mention \"breaking in,\" because it is the general practice for thieves to break in at night.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why did the Torah permit the blood of such a thief to be shed, although he is only attempting to steal money? Because it is an accepted presumption that if the house-owner arises and attempts to prevent the thief from stealing, the thief will slay him. And thus the thief entering his colleague's house to steal is in effect a pursuer seeking to kill his colleague. Therefore, he should be killed, whether he is an adult or a minor, or a man or a woman.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If it is clear to the house-owner that the thief who breaks in will not kill him and instead is only seeking financial gain, it is forbidden to kill the thief. If the house-owner kills him, the house-owner is considered to be a murderer.  This is alluded to by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 22:2</a>, which states: \"If the sun shines upon him...\" - i.e., if it is as clear to you as the sun that he is at peace with you, do not kill him. Therefore, a father who breaks into his son's home should not be killed. But a son who breaks into his father's home may be killed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the Rema <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.425.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who \"tunnels in order to steal\" has this rule of pursuer applied to him, however if it is understood that his only intent is monetary gain, and that he would not kill the owner in a confrontation, then it is forbidden to kill him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam and the Rema agree that if it's clear the thief doesn't intend to kill then it's not ok to kill him, but otherwise it is (at any time of day).  This appears to be the halacha.  Not addressed there (and I think it's beyond the scope of the current question) is how one should determine the intent of the thief.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are women allowed to cut their payot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A BIT OF BACKGROUND</p>\n\n<p>I know that in Jewish law there are some ritual requirements, positive duties caused by time, which obligate men but not women. The <em>gemara</em> mentions this idea both in the context of consistent examples and in the context of exceptions, ritual requirement which <em>do</em> obligate women, such as <em>kiddush</em> on <em>Shabbos</em>. For a few examples see Kiddushin 29a, Kiddushin 33b, Berachos 20b, Shabbos 23a, Pesachim 108b, Succah 28a, Rosh Hashanah 33a, Succah 38a, Kiddushin 34a, Arachin 3.</p>\n\n<p>But in general, there is a presumption of equal rights (Bava Kamma 15a, citing Num 5:6, Ex 21:1, Ex 21:29), and prohibitions usually apply to men and women equally.</p>\n\n<p>THE REAL QUESTION</p>\n\n<p>So why are women permitted to cut their <em>payot</em> (sideburns)? The commandment involved there is not a positive time-bound commandment; it's a prohibition!</p>\n\n<p>I don't mean to ask philosophically why God made it that way (like \"Taamei HaMitzvot\"). I'm asking what is the Derasha or verse that Talmud (etc.) uses to derive it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Kiddushin 35b addresses this:</p>\n\n<p>חוץ מבל תקיף ובל תשחית כו': בשלמא בל תטמא למתים דכתיב (ויקרא כא, א) אמור אל הכהנים בני אהרן בני אהרן ולא בנות אהרן אלא בל תקיף ובל תשחית מנלן\n§ The Gemara asks: Granted, a woman of priestly lineage is not obligated in the mitzva of: Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse, as it is written: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: None shall become impure for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). This verse teaches that the prohibition applies to the sons of Aaron, but not the daughters of Aaron. But from where do we derive the prohibitions of: Do not round the corners of one’s head, and: Do not destroy the corners of your beard?</p>\n\n<p>דכתיב (ויקרא יט, כז) לא תקיפו פאת ראשכם ולא תשחית את פאת זקנך כל שישנו בהשחתה ישנו בהקפה והני נשי הואיל ולא איתנהו בהשחתה ליתנהו בהקפה\nThe Gemara answers that this is as it is written: “You shall not round the corners of your head and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27). The juxtaposition of the two prohibitions teaches that anyone who is included in the prohibition against destroying the beard is included in the prohibition against rounding the head. And since women are not included in the prohibition against destroying, they are also not included in the prohibition against rounding the head.</p>\n\n<p>ומנלן דלא איתנהו בהשחתה איבעית אימא סברא דהא לא אית להו זקן ואיבעית אימא קרא דאמר קרא לא תקיפו פאת ראשכם ולא תשחית את פאת זקנך\nThe Gemara asks: And from where do we derive that women are not obligated in the prohibition against destroying the corners of one’s beard? The Gemara answers: If you wish, propose a logical reason, as ordinarily women do not have a beard. And if you wish, cite a verse that teaches this point, as the verse states: “You shall not round the corners of your head [roshekhem] and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard [zekanekha]” (Leviticus 19:27).</p>\n\n\n",

That is, 'haya' is an adjective; not a noun. would one read it as a noun (which would be an easy mistake to make, given that the word חיה is frequently a noun, not a verb), it would mean that hayot are the subject of the verse.

Therefore, Rashi clarifies that 'haya' is an adjective, not the subject of the sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the repetition, the Gur Aryeh explains that Rashi decided to repeat the comment, since although one would realise that in the first verse 'haya' is a not a noun, one would not necessarily realise this in the next verse. In the first verse, the term 'nefesh haya' is used to refer to what has already been describes as 'sherets'. However, the next verse does not describe it as 'sherets', and therefore one might have thought that the subject of the verse is a 'haya'. Therefore, he again has to clarify the 'haya' is not a noun. The reason that 'sherets' differs from 'haya' seems to be that it connotes an animal that is close to the ground as Rashi explains in verse 20. A typical 'haya' is larger, and therefore one would be more likely to make the mistake that 'haya' is a noun, and the subject in verse 20. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore Rashi has to repeat himself a third time, since the mistake would be easiest to make in verse 24. There the verse actually deals with land animals as opposed to fish, so reading 'haya' as a noun, would be an even easier mistake.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Hamnuna explains: <strong>What is the</strong>\n  <strong>reason</strong> that the wrath is <strong>poured</strong>? It is <strong>because infants are outside</strong> in\n  the streets and are not studying Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>אמר עולא: לא חרבה ירושלים אלא מפני שלא היה להם בושת פנים זה מזה, שנאמר\n  (ירמיהו ו:טו) \"הובישו כי תועבה עשו גם בוש לא יבושו וגו'\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Ulla said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because people had no shame\n  before each other, as it is stated: “They acted shamefully; they have\n  performed abominations, yet they neither were ashamed</strong> nor did they\n  know humiliation.

What</strong> is the meaning of:\n  <strong>Until it could not be healed? Rav Yehuda said that Rav said</strong>: It means\n  that <strong>anyone who disparages Torah scholars cannot be healed from his\n  wound.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>ואמר רבא: לא חרבה ירושלים אלא בשביל שפסקו ממנה אנשי אמנה, שנאמר\n  (ירמיהו ה:א) \"שוטטו בחוצות ירושלים וראו נא [ודעו ובקשו ברחובותיה אם\n  תמצאו איש] עושה משפט מבקש אמונה ואסלח לה\". איני והאמר רב קטינא אפי'\n  בשעת כשלונה של ירושלים לא פסקו ממנה אנשי אמנה שנאמר (ישעיהו ג:ו) \"כי\n  יתפש איש באחיו בית אביו שמלה לכה קצין תהיה לנו\" דברים שבני אדם מתכסין\n  בהן כשמלה ישנן בידיך \"והמכשלה הזאת תחת ידך\" דברים שאין בני אדם עומדין\n  עליהם אלא אם כן נכשלים בהן ישנן תחת ידיך קצין תהיה לנו (ישעיהו ג:ז)\n  \"ישא ביום ההוא לאמר לא אהיה חובש וגו'\" אין ישא אלא לשון שבועה וכן הוא\n  אומר לא תשא את שם ה' לא אהיה חובש לא אהיה מחובשי עצמן בבית המדרש\n  ובביתי אין לחם ואין שמלה שאין בידי לא מקרא ולא משנה ולא גמרא וממאי\n  דילמא שאני התם דאי אמר להו גמירנא אמרו ליה אימא לן הוה ליה למימר גמר\n  ושכח מאי לא אהיה חובש כלל? לא קשיא: כאן בדברי תורה כאן במשא ומתן: (וכן\n  הובא בחגיגה דף יד/א) </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>And Rava said: Jerusalem was destroyed only because there were no more\n  faithful people there, as it is stated: “Roam about the streets of\n  Jerusalem and see, and search its plazas, if you can find a person,\n  who acts justly, who seeks integrity, that I should forgive it”</strong>\n  (Jeremiah 5:1). The Gemara asks: <strong>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Ketina say:\n  Even at the time of Jerusalem’s failure, trustworthy people did not\n  cease there, as it is stated: “For a man will grab his brother of his\n  father’s house and say: You have a garment. Come be a chief over us</strong>\n  and let this ruin be under your care” (Isaiah 3:6)? <strong>Things that people\n  use to cover up like a garment</strong>, secrets, <strong>are in your hands</strong> and you\n  know about them. Therefore, you should be a leader of the community.\n  And that which is stated: <strong>“And let this ruin be under your care,”</strong>\n  meaning: <strong>Matters</strong> of Torah <strong>that people do not ascertain unless they\n  misunderstand them are in your hands</strong>; therefore, <strong>be a chief over us</strong>.\n  It is stated later on in that passage: <strong>“He will rise [yissa] on that\n  day, saying, I will not be a ruler</strong> while in my house there is no bread\n  and no garment, you shall not appoint me as chief of the people”\n  (Isaiah 3:7). <strong>The term rise [yissa] means nothing other than an oath,\n  as it says: “Do not raise [tissa] the name of the Lord your God in\n  vain” (Exodus 20:17). I will not be a ruler</strong>, means: <strong>I will not be one\n  of those who close themselves up in the study hall</strong>, as I do not\n  regularly do so, <strong>while in my house there is no bread and no garment,\n  for I have neither Bible nor Mishna nor Gemara in my hands</strong>. According\n  to this explanation, there were people of faith who truthfully\n  admitted that they did not study Torah, even during the time of the\n  destruction of Jerusalem. The Gemara rejects this: <strong>And from what</strong> do\n  you conclude that this admission was due to their faithfulness?\n  <strong>Perhaps it is different</strong> in that case, <strong>as had he told them: I studied</strong>\n  Torah, <strong>they would have said to him: Tell us</strong> what you studied. As he\n  would not know to respond, he would have no choice other than to admit\n  that he did not study. The Gemara rejects this: That is not difficult,\n  <strong>as he could have</strong> at least <strong>said he learned and forgot</strong>. The Gemara asks:\n  Therefore, <strong>what is: I will not be a ruler</strong>? It means that he is telling\n  the truth and although he could have lied, he admits that he did <strong>not</strong>\n  study Torah <strong>at all</strong>. The Gemara answers: This is <strong>not difficult. Here,</strong>\n  where it was taught that they were faithful, that was <strong>with regard to\n  matters of Torah</strong>; whereas <strong>here</strong>, where it was taught that there were no\n  more people of faith in Jerusalem, that was <strong>with regard to</strong> matters of\n  <strong>business</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Yoma 9b</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Due to baseless hatred</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מקדש ראשון מפני מה חרב? מפני ג' דברים שהיו בו: עבודה זרה, וגלוי עריות,\n  ושפיכות דמים... אבל מקדש שני שהיו עוסקין בתורה ובמצות וגמילות חסדים\n  מפני מה חרב? מפני שהיתה בו שנאת חנם, ללמדך ששקולה שנאת חנם כנגד שלש\n  עבירות: עבודה זרה, גלוי עריות, ושפיכות דמים</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Due to what</strong> reason <strong>was the First Temple destroyed</strong>?

The servant <strong>went</strong> and mistakenly <strong>brought</strong> <strong>him</strong>\n  his enemy <strong>bar Kamtza</strong>. The man who was hosting the feast <strong>came and found</strong>\n  bar Kamtza <strong>sitting</strong> at the feast. The host <strong>said to</strong> bar Kamtza. <strong>That man\n  is the enemy [ba’al devava] of that man</strong>, that is, you are my enemy.\n  <strong>What</strong> then <strong>do you want here</strong>? <strong>Arise</strong> and <strong>leave</strong>. Bar Kamtza <strong>said to him:\n  Since I have</strong> already <strong>come</strong>, <strong>let me stay and I will give you money for\n  whatever I eat and drink.</strong> Just do not embarrass me by sending me out.\n  The host <strong>said to him: No,</strong> you must leave. Bar Kamtza <strong>said to him: I\n  will give you money for half of the feast</strong>; just do not send me away.\n  The host <strong>said to him: No</strong>, you must leave. Bar Kamtza then <strong>said to him:\n  I will give you money for the entire feast</strong>; just let me stay. The host\n  <strong>said to him: No,</strong> you must leave. Finally, the host <strong>took</strong> bar Kamtza <strong>by\n  his hand, stood him up, and took him out.</strong> After having been cast out\n  from the feast, bar Kamtza <strong>said</strong> to himself: <strong>Since the Sages were\n  sitting there and did not protest</strong> the actions of the host, although\n  they saw how he humiliated me, learn from it that they were content\n  with what he did. <strong>I will</strong> therefore <strong>go</strong> <strong>and inform [eikhul kurtza]\n  against them to the king. He went and said to the emperor: The Jews\n  have rebelled against you</strong>. The emperor <strong>said to him: Who says</strong> that this\n  is the case? Bar Kamtza <strong>said to him:</strong> Go and test them; <strong>send them an\n  offering</strong> to be brought in honor of the government, and <strong>see whether\n  they will sacrifice it</strong>. The emperor <strong>went and sent with him</strong> a choice\n  <strong>three-year-old calf</strong>. <strong>While</strong> bar Kamtza <strong>was coming</strong> with the calf to the\n  Temple, <strong>he made a blemish on</strong> the calf’s <strong>upper lip. And some say</strong> he\n  made the blemish <strong>on</strong> its <strong>eyelids</strong>, <strong>a place where according to us</strong>, i.e.,\n  halakha, <strong>it is a blemish, but according to them</strong>, gentile rules for\n  their offerings, it <strong>is not a blemish</strong>. Therefore, when bar Kamtza\n  brought the animal to the Temple, the priests would not sacrifice it\n  on the altar since it was blemished, but they also could not explain\n  this satisfactorily to the gentile authorities, who did not consider\n  it to be blemished. The blemish notwithstanding, <strong>the Sages thought to\n  sacrifice</strong> the animal as an offering <strong>due to</strong> the imperative to maintain\n  <strong>peace</strong> with the <strong>government</strong>. <strong>Rabbi Zekharya ben Avkolas said to them</strong>: If\n  the priests do that, people <strong>will say</strong> that <strong>blemished</strong> animals <strong>may be\n  sacrificed</strong> as offerings <strong>on the altar</strong>. The Sages said: If we do not\n  sacrifice it, then we must prevent bar Kamtza from reporting this to\n  the emperor. The Sages <strong>thought to kill him so that he would not go and\n  speak</strong> against them. <strong>Rabbi Zekharya said to them</strong>: If you kill him,\n  people <strong>will say</strong> that <strong>one who makes a blemish on sacrificial animals is\n  to be killed</strong>. As a result, they did nothing, bar Kamtza’s slander was\n  accepted by the authorities, and consequently the war between the Jews\n  and the Romans began. <strong>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The</strong> excessive <strong>humility of\n  Rabbi Zekharya ben Avkolas destroyed our Temple, burned our Sanctuary,\n  and exiled us from our land.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Bava Metzia 30b</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Due to not adjudicating beyond the letter of the law.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאמר רבי יוחנן לא חרבה ירושלים אלא על שדנו בה דין תורה. אלא דיני\n  דמגיזתא לדיינו? אלא אימא: שהעמידו דיניהם על דין תורה ולא עבדו לפנים\n  משורת הדין</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Jerusalem was destroyed only</strong> for the fact <strong>that\n  they adjudicated</strong> cases on the basis of <strong>Torah law</strong> in the city.

Bar Kamtza\n  came into the feast and sat amongst the guests. The host arrived and\n  found Bar Kamtza sitting amongst the morning-meal guests. Said the\n  host: “You are my enemy, and yet you are sitting in my house?! Get up\n  and get out of my house!” Said Bar Kamtza, “Don’t embarrass me! And I\n  will pay you the cost of my portion of the meal.” Said the host, “You\n  may not lean!” Said Bar Kamtza, “Don’t embarrass me! And I will just\n  sit and won’t eat or drink anything.” Said the host, “You may not\n  lean!” Said Bar Kamtza, “I will give you the cost of this entire\n  feast!” Said the host, “Get out!” Now, R’ Zecharya ben Avkulas was\n  present at the feast, and he was at doubt whether to protest or not,\n  but ultimately he did not. Bar Kamtza thereby left the feast, and said\n  to himself: “All of these guests are leaning and sitting in\n  tranquility; I will go and inform against them.” What did he do? He\n  went to the Roman governor, and said to him: “These sacrifices which\n  you send to the Jews as offerings, they eat and offer up different\n  sacrifices in place of yours.” The governor scolded him. Bar Kamtza\n  came back again and said: “These sacrifices which you send to the Jews\n  as offerings, they eat and offer up different sacrifices in place of\n  yours. And if you don’t believe me, send with me an offering and an\n  officer, and then [when we bring it to Jerusalem] you’ll know that I\n  am not a liar.” [The ruler agreed.] While they were travelling on the\n  road, the officer fell asleep, and Bar Kamtza got up in the nighttime\n  and secretly blemished all the sacrifices [in such a way that they\n  would be unacceptable to be brought as sacrifices]. [They arrived at\n  Jerusalem,] and when the Kohen saw these animals, he brought other\n  [unblemished] animals instead of those. The king’s officer said: “Why\n  didn’t you offer these offerings?” Said the Kohen, “tomorrow”. By the\n  third day the Kohen had still not offered them. The officer sent a\n  reply to the king, saying, “That which the Jew [Bar Kamtza] told us -\n  it is true!” Immediately, the governor sent out to destroy the Temple.\n  This is what people say: “[The difference] between ‘Kamtza’ and ‘Bar\n  Kamtza’ destroyed the Temple”.

He also gives the sources in the Talmud and Toseftah that discuss this. An alternative link for this article is <a href=\"http://mevakeshlev.blogspot.com/2017/08/why-was-beis-hamikdash-destroyed.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Misconception:</strong> According to rabbinic tradition, the destruction of the Second Beit Hamikdash (Temple) can be attributed solely to sinat\n  chinam—gratuitous hatred.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Some rabbinic sources do, indeed, attribute the destruction to sinat chinam. But other sages have identified additional causes for\n  this national tragedy.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Background:</strong> <sup>[1]</sup> Statements of Chazal regarding the destruction of the Beit Hamikdash do not appear as part of a systematic framework,\n  but are scattered throughout rabbinic literature. In some instances,\n  Chazal speak specifically of the causes of the destruction of the\n  Second Temple, in contrast to the destruction of the First Temple. But\n  more often, Chazal speak of the destruction of the Temple in general\n  terms or—more generally still—of the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>\n  \n  <p>Moreover, it is not always clear whether Chazal, when presenting a\n  particular sin, mean that it was solely responsible for the\n  destruction, or that it was merely the “last straw” that sealed the\n  Temple’s fate. The following is a non-comprehensive survey of rabbinic\n  explanations for the Churban (destruction of the Beit Hamikdash),\n  underscoring the point that sinat chinam is a reason, but not the\n  exclusive reason, for the destruction of the Second Temple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example we see the following sources.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As might be expected, the three cardinal sins are suggested as\n  transgressions worthy of such a punishment. Mishnah Avot (5:8-9)\n  states that “exile” is the consequence of “idol-worship, prohibited\n  sexual relations, bloodshed and [neglect of ] the agricultural\n  sabbatical year (shemitat ha’aretz).”<sup>[2]</sup> In a similar vein,\n  but addressing specific tragedies, the Tosefta (end of Menachot)\n  offers the most well-known explanations for the Temples’ destructions:\n  the First Temple was destroyed because of the idol worship, prohibited\n  sexual relations and bloodshed that took place within it, and the\n  Second Temple was destroyed “because they love money and each one\n  hates his neighbor.” Note that while the Tosefta attributes the\n  Churban to sinat chinam, it does not use the specific term. A parallel\n  passage, however, appearing in the Yerushalmi (Yoma 1:1) and the Bavli\n  (Yoma 9a-b), does use the familiar term “sinat chinam” in explaining\n  the destruction of the Second Temple.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n  \n  <p><sup>2.</sup> This mishnah provides a sort of commentary to Lev.\n  26:22-33. Cf. Ramban to Lev. 26:16. The Mishnah apparently selected\n  the four transgressions that were mentioned because the Bible\n  identifies these—and only these—as transgressions for which the Land\n  will spew out its inhabitants. Regarding idol worship, see Deut.\n  11:17; regarding prohibited sexual relations, see Lev. 18:25, 27;\n  regarding bloodshed, see Num. 35:34; regarding the sabbatical year,\n  see Lev. 26:33-35. Note that the mishnah was not necessarily referring\n  to a specific exile, but to exile as a concept.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>3.</sup> Incidentally, in searching for the reason that the\n  Second Temple was destroyed, the Tosefta’s exact wording is “Why were\n  they exiled…?” This may imply that the concepts of “exile” and\n  “Churban” were interchangeable to Chazal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In reading the full explanation and details of the various sins or incidents that are given as contributing to the tragedy, we can see that many apparently <em>trivial</em> aspects contributed to the tragedy and helped inflate the troubles.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Netziv (Ha’amek Davar, introduction to Sefer Bereishit) blames the\n  destruction on excessive “righteousness,” that is, “righteous”\n  individuals who treated others who did not exactly conform to their\n  beliefs as heretics (apikorsim). This was, in actuality, a particular\n  form of sinat chinam. The misplaced persecution of those people led to\n  the destruction, because, the Netziv explains, God does not want this\n  kind of excessive “righteousness,” but rather moral conduct in every\n  day affairs.<sup>[8]</sup> So too, the Chofetz Chaim views sinat\n  chinam as the starting point for the destruction but feels that it\n  alone would not have caused the Churban. Rather the lashon hara\n  (gossip) that followed was the cause of the destruction.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n  \n  <p><sup>8.</sup> He repeats this theme on Num. 36:34 and Deut. 32:5. See\n  also his Shu”t Meshiv Davar 1:44.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>9.</sup> Introduction to Chofetz Chaim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In general then, we need to recognize that it is not specific sins that led to the destruction, but a general loss of kedusha that destroyed the ability of klal Yisrael to maintain the status that allowed them to remain in Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In reading all of the above, one invariably faces the question of how\n  to understand the multiple and wide-ranging rabbinic statements. What\n  seems clear is that certainly an element of rebuke was intended. It is\n  understood that if a particular sin led to the destruction, observing\n  the corresponding precept is the antidote that will lead to the\n  restoration of the Temple. Ibn Ezra (Lev. 19:17) expresses this\n  concept when he states that by observing the commandment to “Love\n  one’s neighbor,” we will return to our Land, because this mitzvah is\n  the opposite of sinat chinam, which is what destroyed the Second\n  Temple. As has been demonstrated, sinat chinam is not the only offense\n  that Chazal accuse the Jews of committing, and for a full redemption\n  we need to rectify them all. However, because sinat chinam is such a\n  widespread problem, it is the cause for the Churban that is most often\n  quoted. Our prayer is that all the statements of Chazal will be taken\n  to heart and all of the wrongdoings—sinat chinam and the other\n  sins—will be rectified, leading to a complete and final redemption\n  with the building of the Third, permanent Beit Hamikdash.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Talmud says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.9b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 9b</a> that the Second Temple was destroyed because of baseless hatred.</p>\n\n\n",

Depending on what that honor was, under certain circumstances, it can, of course, be revoked. For example, if the rabbi said praises about Mr. Kushner, during his Bar Mitzvah, he could publicly renounce what he said, then. If he presented Jared with a siddur or Chumash at his Bar Mitzvah, he could request that they be returned.</p>\n\n<p>So, technically, tangible things such as these can be revoked. I don't see the point to doing this, but, I guess if the rabbi (I assume that there was just one, so I don't know what Mike Rappaport means by using the plural form) wants to make a silly point, to amuse Michael (I don't think Jared would be that amused, but, who knows?) that rabbi is able and welcome to do so.</p>\n\n\n",

Here is \"close to deliberate\". He had murderous intent, he just didn't do exactly what he intended to do, so the city of refuge does not protect him, rather he falls under the gap between unintentional manslaughter and murder.</p>\n\n<p>Because capital punishment is full of technicalities that allow the accused to get off, he falls into a technicality.

Several of the Levite cities listed there, for example, are spelled differently or even have completely different names (for example, Tavor-Nahalel) than those listed in Yehoshua.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Klein_(scholar)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Prof. Shmuel Klein</a> noted in his essay \"The Cities of the Kohanim and Levi'im and the Cities of Refuge\", pg. 85, that it was a common prose-style by the ancient biblical writers to shorten certain words. Sometimes the reasons for the shortening are more easily understood<sup>1</sup>, but not always, such as appears to be the case here. With that said, it's also entirely possible that the name simply changed over the centuries (perhaps for a similar reason, that the name was shortened over time because that's how people spoke).</p>\n<p>The Encyclopedia Mikra'it (Biblical Encyclopedia), vol. 5, writes on the entry of משאל/משל:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"השם משאל אולי מעיד על כך שהיו שואלים שם באלה-ים; והשווה את שם המקום אשתאול.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: The name \"Mish'al\" may bear witness to the possibility that they would ask of God there; and compare the place-name \"Eshta'ol\".\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps this understanding may connect the name Mish'al to Mashal - in parables, questions are sometimes used. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"He took up his mashal...How can I damn whom God has not damned, How doom when the LORD has not doomed?...Who can count the dust of Jacob, Number the dust-cloud of Israel?...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.23.7-10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 23:7-10</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Da'at Mikra in their commentary on the name Mashal consider it to merely be a short-form of Mishal, and therefore both probably come from turning to God (as stated by the Biblical Encyclopedia).</p>\n<p>A possible reason for why the name was shortened may come from the word \"שַּׁל\" (Shal) which appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.6.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 2:6:7</a>, and which many <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.6.7?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentators</a> explain to mean \"שגגה\", which we know means \"accidental\", but through carelessness. Only people who killed בשגגה - a careless accident - are allowed to escape to the cities of refuge. Perhaps due to its nature as a city of refuge, the city's name eventually changed to reflect the שוגג nature of its inhabitants. Therefore, from משאל (Mishal) to מ-<strong>של</strong> (Ma-<strong>Shal</strong>).<sup>2</sup> Perhaps it was a form of dark humor among the inhabitants, or perhaps it was meant as a warning to people - be careful, otherwise you'll end up stuck here.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> For more info, see his essay \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23539717?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=au%3A%22%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F%22&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Fsi%3D1%26Query%3Dau%253A%2522%25D7%25A9%25D7%259E%25D7%2595%25D7%2590%25D7%259C%2B%25D7%25A7%25D7%259C%25D7%2599%25D7%2599%25D7%259F%2522%26refreqid%3Dexcelsior%253A602fb3e99c0cdfab0bb0d0bef706c35f&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-5910%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A9736ecf746447ebf83aa9c2c7d7fc92e\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מחקרים בפרקי היחס שבספר דברי הימים</a>\", pg. 12-16.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.3.27?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_Zion_on_II_Samuel.3.27.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudat Tzion on Shmuel 2:3:27</a> compares a couple more words of the same root.</p>\n\n\n",

Many of these shuls have different times to start and end Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>During the summer, in particular, most of the shuls begin Shabbat sometimes an hour before the published candle lighting time (what they commonly call <em>bizman</em>.) There are later minyanim that begin mincha about 10 minutes after the <em>bizman</em> lighting.</p>\n\n<p>Lets say someone is a regualrly attends the early minyan. Many of the neighborhood people know him well. One week, he has to work late, so he decides to go to the later minyan. If he starts Shabbat at the later time, does he need to worry about Marit Ayin from his other Jewish neighbors who started Shabbat early? Let's say they see him driving his car after they have begun their Shabbat? </p>\n\n<p>If there is no concern about Marit Ayin, why is that? Do we have to be concerned about Marit Ayin (or whatever it may be called for Gentiles) from Gentiles who may not understand that Shabbat can start at different times? (I.e., they know that Jews are not supposed to work on Shabbat, but then they wonder when they see some Jews walking to shul while another observant Jew is driving, and will think someone is not observing Shabbat and report badly about Jews.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Shabbos is exactly 24 hours according to the Torah (See maseches Moed koton daf 3b-4a where the Gemora tries to compare Shmitta to shabbos Which is Me-eis Le-eis Min Hatorah)and tosefes shabbos is a very short amount of time a matter of seconds (tos moed koton 4a), but we don't know exactly when it starts and ends so we keep from shekia (sunset) which is the start of bein hashmoshos (the unknown zone) and motzei shabbos ends at tzeis (either night fall or 72 minutes after sunset) that period we keep shabbos as a must. . and tosefos 4a \"ma\". The Ran in 84a yumo says that one can not possibly add to shabbos while the sun is out from the previous day. Indeed the Beier Halacha quoting Pri Megadim orach Chaim 261,2 says (following the vast majority of Poskim) <strong>before shekia (sunset) Tosefes Shabbos is miderabanan addition.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עיין בפמ\"ג שכתב דמי שמקבל שבת בתוך הד' מילין הוא דאורייתא ובעשה דתוספת שבת ומן הזמן הזה עד פלג המנחה הוא רק מדרבנן:.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch Yore Dea 87,3, Rema, Taz, Pri Chodosh and Creisi upleisi hold that <strong>Marit haayin does not apply to derabbanan cases.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Pri Chodosh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הבו דלא להוסיף עלה<br>\n   its enough so don't decree Maarit Haayin to rabbinic enactments except for the cases mentioned by Chazal </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובשר חיה ועוף -- אפילו בחלב טהורה -- מותר בבישול ובהנאה, ואף באכילה אינו אסור אלא מדרבנן -<br>\n  Chicken and kosher milk are permitted to be cooked together and derive benefit from even though the mixture is prohibited to eat, since it is only forbidden to eat Miderabbonon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rema:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגה: ונהגו לעשות חלב משקדים ומניחים בה בשר עוף הואיל ואינו רק מדרבנן אבל בשר בהמה יש להניח אצל החלב שקדים משום מראית העין -<br>\n   therefore we have the practice of cooking chicken with almond milk for us to eat  since the prohibition of real milk cooked with chicken to eat is only derabanan. But animal (Beef lamb or Goat) meat one must put almonds next to the almond milk when cooked together because of Marit Haayin (i.e in case someone sees thinking that the meat was cooked with animal milk and permit himself). (See shachs* explanation of the Rema slightly differently)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the Maharshal (quoted by Shach Yore Dea 87,3 who agrees and Noda Bihuda Tinyana O.C 30)  says that Marit Haayin does apply to a Gezeiro Derabanan like <strong>eating</strong>(see Shach i quote below from 87,7) Chicken cooked with almond milk because people will think you are transgressing a Rabbinic Prohibition of chicken and milk. See Pri Chodosh in Yore Deah who defends Rema and Mechaber. </p>\n\n<p>Despite the Maharshals objection the Ben Ish Chai says that everyone agrees in certain cases that there is no Maris Haayin.\nKeeping Tosefet Shabbat is not Shabbos for everyone then we have a rule that we don't make a Gezeira of Marit haayin. In Sheilos Uteshuvos Rav Poalim from the Ben ish Chai <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1401&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1401&st=&pgnum=10</a> he talks about a push bicycle (In those days bicycles were without peddles and one pushed with his legs like a scooter) and says <strong>there is no Gezeira of Maris Haayin when riding a pushbike (on shabbos within an eiruv) that one might come to drive a car (Havara-combustion) or go on a carriage pulled by animals (Mechamer- making animal do a melacha), since there is a clear difference between what is ossur (car) and Mutar (push bike)</strong> and not get confused. So too here In Tosefes Shabbos in a large community where there are a lot of people that don't keep extra tosefes shabbos and it is known that it is optional and that those people are not breaking Tosefes Shabbos, <strong>so one will not get confused between what is Ossur (breaking Tosefes shabbos) and Muttar (accepting Shabbos later) when you Daven late and there is no Marit Haayin</strong> They know you are not doing a Melacha after accepting Shabbos rather you are davening later like so many others.</p>\n\n<p>The Shach in Yore Dea also says clearly there is no marit Haayin when there is a evident possibility that you are doing something Muttar This is based on the Shach in Yore Dea 87,7 when describing cooking non kosher milk with meat-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בבישול לחודיה ליכא משום מראית העין דהא יכול להיות שמבשל לצורך רפואה או שאר דברים<br>\n  The cooking of it (non kosher milk with meat or chicken with almond milk) is not prohibited because of Marit haayin (that you might eat it), since one can assume you are <strong>cookng</strong>(as opposed to eating where the Shach is quoted above that there is Marit haayin to eat chicken with almond milk) the mixture for an unwell person (in danger) or for another purpose e.g selling to a gentile (but when a healthy person eats chicken with almond milk there is no alternative but to think he is sinning).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion it is not marit haayin to work early one week and late the next as long as you don't do Melacha beyond 14 minutes before Shekia (CYLOR if you need more time).</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*{ש\"ך: ולא דמי לדם דגים סוף סימן ס\"ו שמותר לגמרי ואפ\"ה אם כנסו בכלי אסור מפני מראית עין אא\"כ יש בו קשקשים שניכר שהוא דם דגים דהתם דם גופיה אסור מדאורייתא הלכך הרואה יאמר דאכיל דם בהמה שהוא אסור מן התורה אבל בשר עוף בחלב ממש הוא מדרבנן ליכא למיחש משום מראית עין Shach: Chicken cooked with milk Is not the same as Fish blood - which is permitted to consume together with the fish but once separated in a cup is forbidden because of Marit Haayin (i.e people will think your drinking animal blood which is forbidden Min haTorah) So add scales to the cup so people know its fish blood - Since there is no Marit haayin on a prohibition Derabanan.}</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would say the norm is that even if one regularly prays in a early minyan, occasionally they can pray in a later minyan if they are running late. Therefore one would not suspect his neighbour of being Mechalel Shabbos.</p>\n<p>Regarding Gentiles seeing him do Melacha, R' Moshe Feinstein writes in Igros Moshe Orach Chaim 1:96 that Maris Ayin means someone thinks that someone violated something, for example he thinks that someone inappropriately ate something non-kosher.\nHowever, it does not include doing something permitted that people may mistakenly think is forbidden due to the fact that they do not know the Halacha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We're <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1422\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not concerned</a> for Maaras Ayin from non-Jews.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>One is allowed to walk by a Shul when people are praying if <a href=\"https://www.opengemara.org/gemara/berachos/8b#33\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there is another Shul in town</a>.

Genesis 2 starts (paraphrase), When G0d created the universe (as described before), everything was set up. Here are the details of the creation of Adam and what happened immediately after.</p>\n\n<p>It is the same story, but the concentration is on a different set of details. It is like saying \"During the sixth day, Adam was created in this specific manner. The following events involving Adam then occurred.\".</p>\n\n<p>Note that the start of the \"second story\" is Bereishis 2:4. The Xian division into \"chapters\" is mistaken. As Rabbi Shimshon Rafael Hirsch points out, \"Aileh\" means \"These\" which points back to what is already said and means expanding on what was said, here are the \"products\" of what was created (as we described earlier). Now once the world had been created, the important part of the Universe and the part that we need to concentrate on is Adam ...</p>\n\n<p>Later we see that the Torah shows what happened to the world until we get to Noah and the flood.

She privately gave him a golden lamp, and she and her brother came before him, approaching him as if they were seeking judgment. She said to the philosopher: I want to share in the inheritance of my father’s estate. He said to them: Divide it. Rabban Gamliel said to him: It is written in our Torah: In a situation where there is a son, the daughter does not inherit. The philosopher said to him: Since the day you were exiled from your land, the Torah of Moses was taken away and the avon gilyon was given in its place. It is written in the avon gilyon: A son and a daughter shall inherit alike. The next day Rabban Gamliel brought the philosopher a Libyan donkey. Afterward, Rabban Gamliel and his sister came before the philosopher for a judgment. He said to them: I proceeded to the end of the avon gilayon, and it is written: I, avon gilayon, did not come to subtract from the Torah of Moses, rather to add to the Torah of Moses. And it is written there: In a situation where there is a son, the daughter does not inherit. She said to him: May your light shine like a lamp, alluding to the lamp she had given him.

And the Christian is quoting a written evangelical book; I'm not so familiar, but wasn't that written by Paul? For these reasons it would seem that this story is about a different Paul the Elder.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Was Adam HaRishon made incomplete? If so why?",
    "content": "# Was Adam HaRishon made incomplete? If so why?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rav Yosef Albo (Sefer Halkkarim 3:2) explains that the expression 'Ki Tov' is used to describe something that has reached i.e. fulfilled its potential and reached its (goal, purpose) shleimus (perfection). For this reason Rashi (Bereshit 1:7) writes that the Torah does not use the expression 'Ki Tov' in conjunction with the second day of Creation as the formation of the waters that began on that day was not completed until the third day of Creation. And because the Torah doesn׳t explicitly state that man's creation was Tov, it is said man must work at perfecting himself, at fulfilling his potential and purpose, until he develops to the level of Tov. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly after Adam HaRishon was made and placed in a Gan b'Eden and had been given certain tasks the Torah teaches that HaShem saw that it was not good for man to be alone/lonely/on himself. So He would make him an Ezer Kenegdo. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Did HaShem made Adam HaRishon having a lack, shortage or deficiency that he could not be or perform the Will of HaShem on his own?; and what kind of missing elements are we speaking of. </li>\n<li>And if he was in need of help, what was it he needed help with/for? </li>\n<li>And looking at 1 & 2 than why didn't HaShem made them both at the first place? (Why first make Adam, then bringing the Animals in order to show that those are not worthy of being an ezer kenegdo for Adam,  and then make Chava?)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think the answer can be found within the teachings of Ramchal:</p>\n\n<p>In short he teaches that HaShem is infinite; Total (absolute, complete, whole, entirely perfect etc.) and All-embracing (because He is The Source of everything) and his essence is Good. Because of it the reason for creation can't be found in a act of self-interest, self-satisfaction, self-sufficiency etc., because this would imply that HaShem is 'missing' something and in that case He wouldn't be Total and All-embraching but would have 'a lack' or 'deficiency'.\nSo because He didn't create creation for Himself, it must have created it for another. Doing something for another is called 'giving' and one can only give if there is another. And so it is taught that HaShem created the world for man in order to bestow His Goodness. </p>\n\n<p>But because G-d alone is true goodness, true perfection, free of all deficiency, and there is nothing comparable to Him: \"His Wisdom therefore decreed that the nature of this true benefaction be [exemplified by] His giving created things the opportunity to attach themselves to Him.\"</p>\n\n<p>How can a human being attain that deepest pleasure of (and from) being connected [devekut] to G-d (i.e. having a relationship with Him)? \nBy 'emulating G-d' (same applies for becomming 'ki tov)</p>\n\n<p>How can one emulate G-d? By giving, doing good for others etc. In order to do so HaShem had to build another, one opposite to him (so one can become a receiving and giving person). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I saw an exquisite explanation that answers this question today from Rav Melamed. I'll just quote it in full:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...God wished to benefit humanity. He created the\nworld incomplete, to provide people with the opportunity to perfect it\nand make it a better, happier place, and thereby to merit becoming\nGod’s partner in everything good in the world and experiencing\ncomplete happiness in it.</p>\n<p>The greatest shortcoming in all of creation is detachment. The one God\nindeed created everything, but because He concealed His light, all\ncreatures are detached from Him, and consequently from one another.\nEach creature looks out only for itself, thus leading to all the\nworld’s strife, discord, conflict, and war. It is for this reason that\nthis world is called “the world of detachment” and “the world of\ndeception.” The unity at the root of all goes unacknowledged, thus\nleading to all the evil in the world. The fundamental principle of the\nJewish faith is therefore belief in God’s unity, that there is one God\nand no other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the shortcoming in man is that he is detached from Hashem and everyone else, which leads to selfishness, which leads to strife. The way man fixes this is by believing the true unity that exists - Hashem's Oneness. Now we can answer the questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The light that was withdrawn from man is the knowledge that he is one with Hashem, and therefore he isn't able to recognise that reality.</li>\n<li>He therefore needed help to understand the concept of unity. He was therefore given a wife. He is able to thus become one with her (and vice versa) and through this unity they are able to bring unity above and partner with Hashem.</li>\n<li>Hashem made them one initially because they are one, in truth, but have been separated now. It therefore teaches us that our goal is to become (re)united.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

If each doorway is a separate Mitzvah, maybe one should make as many doorways as possible obligated in Mezuzah.</li>\n<li>You don't have time to put up all the Mezuzos for your house at one time. Instead, you put them up on two separate occasions. If they're each separate Mitzvos, each distinct time you put up Mezuzos requires a new Bracha. If it's all one Mitzvah, perhaps you should only say the Bracha before the last batch that you put up.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I have worked as a Sofer Stam for many years and learned and researched these issues, both for my customers' sakes and for my own knowledge.  Here is what I have discovered:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Each room is its own mitzva.  The Talmud and the Rambam use the term בית which would usually indicate an entire dwelling rather than a room, but during the time of the Mishna most dwellings were single rooms.  Also, the Rambam in Hilchot Mezuza 6:10 refers to rooms within a house explicitly, and all the later sources clearly interpret the Talmud the same way.</li>\n<li>Not all rooms have an equal obligation to have a mezuza affixed to their threshold.  Since the verse specifies \"ביתך\", i.e. a dwelling space, bedrooms have the greatest importance according to many authorities.  Storage spaces, office spaces, etc. have secondary importance, and may not even get a bracha when putting a mezuza up on their thresholds alone.</li>\n<li>Each mezuza being affixed in a room that's truly obligated in the mitzva should have a bracha before it, however it's recommended to put up all the mezuzas in the batch with a single bracha, provided there can all be done in the same act (i.e. no היסח דעת).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Therefore, you should always put up as many mezuzas as you have, immediately (if you're outside of Israel you have a 30 day grace period). I've never any discussion about constructing doorways to favor more or less mezuzas.  While there are people I know who want to propose that when you build a house you should do it for the mezuzas, i.e. anything you do you should look for the opportunity to get a mitzva out of it, IMHO that's totally missing the point of yiddishkeit.  But that's well beyond the scope of this question.  As far as the bracha, as stated above, every time you put up a mezuza (unless it's a questionable space, like a walk-in closet) you need to say a bracha.</p>\n\n<p>On a related note, when switching mezuzas without any significant \"down time\", there are three different opinions as to whether not you say a bracha: yes, no, and \"it depends\"...  Further details upon request.</p>\n\n\n",

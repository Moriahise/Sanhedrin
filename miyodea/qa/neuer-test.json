    "content": "# Did Rabbi Dovid Feinstein of Uzda wear tefilin that were Ktav Ari or Ktav Beit Yosef? What about his son?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The biographical sketch of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein that appears in the beginning of Igrot Moshe volume 8 states that his father, Rabbi Dovid Feinstein of Uzda, was born and raised Hassidic, but took on his in-law's very non-Hassidic customs when he married. </p>\n\n<p>So I'll ask: I assume that he started off with Tefilin that use the Hassidically-favored <a href=\"http://lavlor.blogspot.com/2009/02/jewish-fonts-guide-for-different-ktavim.html\">Ktav Ari</a> script. Upon marrying, did he switch to the standard-Ashkenazic <a href=\"http://lavlor.blogspot.com/2009/02/jewish-fonts-guide-for-different-ktavim.html\">Ktav Beit Yosef</a> script? And what about his sons/grandsons? Were they given Ktav Ari tefilin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>R' Moshe himself apparently used Beis Yosef kesav. In his letter to the Lubavitcher Rebbe about Rabbeinu Tam's tefillin (Igros Moshe, vol. 6, no. 9), <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=17\">at the end</a>, R' Moshe asks that the sofer whom the Rebbe charged with writing him a pair of R\"T tefillin (I have heard orally that this was R' Eliezer Zirkind) should do so using Beis Yosef script, so that it should be consistent with the other STA\"M that he uses.</p>\n\n<p>(He also points out that all of the various scripts used for STA\"M are in fact equally halachically kosher. So R' Dovid wouldn't really have had a reason to switch - most likely he continued using the same tefillin before and after his marriage.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Tefillin of Rabbenu Tam were written by R' Zirkind, at the special request of R' Moshe. These tefillin were checked by my rebbe, Rabbi Shmuel Schneid, who told me that the tefillin were written in typical Russian Beis Yosef script. As any sofer experienced with Sifre Torah of the world will tell you, before 1948, each country and Edah had their unique style of Beis Yosef writing, with changes that are not found in today's modern day Israeli Beis Yosef script. All of these styles are Kosher L'Chatchila, according to the Rosh (who first dealt with this question); the Tur, a straight reading of the S'A, the Aruch HaShulchan, and R' Moshe himself issued a teshuva on the matter.</p>\n\n<p>R' Moshe's tefillin were Russian script- at his direct order. He met many times with R' Zirkind and discussed how each letter should be formed. R' Moshe, as a Russian, wanted Russian tefillin. My Rebbe, R'Schneid, has a photocopy of these tefillin, which he took with permission, after having checked the tefillin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have heard from a sofer who checked Rav Moshe's tefillin that the ktav was mostly similar to that of Chabad.  He found this entirely unsurprising, given that both come from Russia.  He expressed disdain for those who expect Lithuanian writing in Russian tefillin.</p>\n\n\n",

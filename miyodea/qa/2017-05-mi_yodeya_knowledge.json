Why did the Torah choose this rather than through some sort of case by case decision based on merit, especially on something so important e.g. only the wise/learned or young/strong could serve.</p>\n\n<p>A teaching in Pirkei avot (2:12: \"והתקן עצמך ללמוד תורה, שאינה ירושה לך\") suggests that Torah wisdom is not inherited i.e. you'd better be sure that you learn it of your own merit.</p>\n\n<p>Kingship is another status that doesn't need to be passed on to your son although it may seem the natural choice for the next king if that son is indeed fitting for the role.</p>\n\n\n",

I am going to travel somewhere where I can sell cigarettes for much more than it cost me. If I take them, I will make a huge profit.</p>\n\n<p>However I am concerned that it may be halachically incorrect to sell these cigarettes to other Jews because it may be a transgression of <em>lifnei Eiver Lo Titen Michshol - One must not place a stumbling block before a 'blind' person.</em></p>\n\n<p>To establish if this is in fact prohibited we must first make sure that smoking in the first place is prohibited. I always understood that it was completely forbidden due to the prohibition of committing suicide (correct me if I am wrong).</p>\n\n<p>However, one can argue (this is what many friends of mine tried to argue) that they are going to smoke the cigarettes anyway since they are addicted. So there should be nothing wrong with being the one who provides them.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know which side is correct (please bring sources to any answers)\nThanks</p>\n\n<p>Edit: as Daniel mentioned in the comments, I think it is actually illegal to do such a thing. I presume that this also makes it halachically incorrect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Among important Sephardi Haredi rabbis, Rabbi Ben Tzion Abba Shaul and Rabbi Moshe Tzedaka called on youth not to start smoking.</p>\n\n<p>Other major Ashkenazi rabbis who explicitly forbade smoking  and selling include Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg, Rabbi Moshe Stern, and Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Avigdor Nevenzahl שליט״א, one of the foremost students of Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach זצ״ל, and former Chief Rabbi of the Old City once told me that if not for the possible legal issues that may come from it, it would not just be allowed, but it would be a mitzvah to steal, take away from, and ultimately destroy your friends' cigarettes from them, as it has been proven without a shadow of a doubt that smoking leads to cancer.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, it seems obvious to apply that it is forbidden to sell them, though it would not be prohibited biblically(as they could acquire their own from the local store around the corner) it would be prohibited rabbinically.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have seen that a s’vara quoted in the name of Rav Avraham Weinfeld זצ״ל (the author of שו״ת לב אברהםֿ) that smoking should be permitted on the basis that each cigarette itself is not able to give one cancer, it is only through the accumulation of the cigarette smoking that leads to cancer. Therefore one is permitted to smoke. Thus selling a pack shouldn’t be forbidden as each cigarette itself is not going to cause cancer, nor a whole pack.</p>\n\n<p>However I consulted with a son of Rav Weinfeld and he said that this idea was never said by his father.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>There is a disagreement among the poskim whether it is permitted or not, based primarily on health reasons; with most forbidding smoking. However, according to R' Yitzchak Yosef shlita, there is no explicit issur to sell or smoke cigarettes(see also Igrot Moshe YD 2:49). There have also been many, and are many Gedolim that smoke; something they would never take as a habit if forbidden by the Torah(ibid). </p>\n\n<p>If one was in sha'at hadachak and needs parnasah, he may deal in cigarettes and rely on the poskim that permit it until he finds something better, b'ezrat HaShem.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Online commentary for 3 ENOCH -- a Hekalot & Merkevah, mystical, apocalyptic, pseudepigraphal, Jewish text (400CE)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been interested in Hekalot & Merkevah literature as of late. I'm not a Kabbalist, but I do study scriptures of the Near East, particularly within the realms of Judaism. I stumbled across 3 Enoch, which is a late Jewish (c. 5th cent.) text that belongs to Jewish mystical, apocalyptic, and pseudepigraphal literature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where can I find online Jewish commentary of 3 Enoch, specifically 3 Enoch 16:1-3:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Ishmael said: Metatron, the Angel, the Prince of the Presence, the\n  Glory of all heaven, said to me;  (1) At first I was sitting upon a\n  great Throne at the door of the Seventh Hall ; and I was judging the\n  children of heaven, the household on high by authority of the Holy\n  One, blessed be He. And I divided Greatness, Kingship, Dignity,\n  Rulership, Honour and Praise, and Diadem and Crown of Glory unto all\n  the princes of kingdoms, while I was presiding (lit. sitting) in the\n  Celestial Court (Yeshiba), and the princes of kingdoms were standing\n  before me, on my right and on my left by authority of the Holy One,\n  blessed be He.  (2) But when Acher came to behold the vision of the\n  Merkaba and fixed his eyes on me, he feared and trembled before me and\n  his soul was affrighted even unto departing from him, because of fear,\n  horror and dread of me, when he beheld me sitting upon a throne like a\n  king with all the ministering angels standing by me as my servants and\n  all the princes of kingdoms adorned with crowns surrounding me:  (3)\n  in that moment he opened his mouth and said: \"Indeed, there are two\n  Divine Powers in heaven!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've noticed several parallels to the Bavli... but I would like to verify that in commentaries.

Charlesworth's <em>Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: Volume One</em>. Bizarrely (and luckily), it's available online in its entirety <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/176511910/Charlesworth-JH-Ed-Old-Testament-Pseudepigrapha-Vol-1-Apocalyptic-Literature-Testaments-Doubleday-1983\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. The translation of (and commentary on) 3 Enoch is written by P. Alexander, and begins on p223. You will have to register to access it, but you can do so free of charge.</p>\n\n<p>In future, and when you have more time on your hands, I would recommend looking at the work of Gabriele Boccoccini, who is a leader in the field of \"Enochic Judaism\". You might also want to consider the work of Gershom Scholem (although it is somewhat old).</p>\n\n<p>There are, indeed, many important parallels to passages within the rabbinic literature, and while these writings are considered \"apocryphal\" (although are obviously much later than the texts we usually refer to as \"apocrypha\"), this type of mysticism has a long history within Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there any way of reconciling his explanation with the more popular understanding, based on Chazal, that it is referring to pious Jewish women? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The following is a (slightly modified) quote from a dvar Torah I wrote in which I propose a possible reconciliation between all the different opinions on this topic. (The full dvar Torah can be found <a href=\"http://shesileizeisim.blogspot.com/2013/12/shemos-heroism-of-god-fearing-midwives.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.):</p>\n\n<p>The story of the midwives is truly one of greatest stories of moral courage in history. Indeed, the medieval commentator, R' Yosef Bechor Shor, writes that the Torah tells us the names of the midwives in order that they should be remembered for all time for their heroism.</p>\n\n<p>However, this brings us to a difficulty. As Rashi tells us, the Sages (<em>Sotah</em> 11b) taught that Shifrah was actually Jochebed, the mother of Moses, and Puah was Miriam, Moses' older sister. This raises an obvious question. If Jochebed and Miriam were the actual heroes of the story, then why does the Torah hide their identity from us? </p>\n\n<p>I believe that the basic answer to this question is that Jochebed and Miriam are two of the greatest figures in Jewish history, and if the Torah had explicitly identified them as the midwives it would be all too easy for us to write off their heroism as simply \"par-for-the-course\" for such outstanding individuals. The Torah wants us to recognize that the heroism of Shifrah and Puah was rooted simply in the fact that, like any pious Jew, they \"feared God.\" Such heroism is something that we can and should expect from every Jew.</p>\n\n<p>This answer gains additional strength in light of the fact that Shifrah and Puah could not possibly have been the only midwives for the entire Jewish population. Rather, as many commentaries (e.g. <em>ibn Ezra</em>, <em>Chizkuni</em>) explain, Shifrah and Puah were the chief midwives, and under them were many hundreds of midwives, all of whom risked their lives to save the lives of the Jewish boys. While Jochebed and Miriam were the leaders of the midwives, the Torah specifically omits identifying them so as not to detract from the heroism of the hundreds of \"ordinary\" women who also \"feared God\" and refused to obey Pharaoh's wicked command.</p>\n\n<p>However, some significant difficulties still remain. A survey of the major commentaries finds a surprisingly strong debate on whether, according to the peshat (simple) reading of these verses, the heroic midwives were even Jewish! While most commentaries (e.g. <em>Rashbam</em>, <em>R' Yosef Bechor Shor</em>) reject the possibility that the verses are referring to non-Jewish midwives, there are also major authorities (e.g. the <em>Rokeach</em>, <em>Abarbanel</em>, and <em>Malbim</em>) who see this as the simple reading of the verses.</p>\n\n<p>This would seem to brings us back to square one. Not only did the Torah hide the true identities of Shifrah and Puah, it was even ambiguous about their Jewish identity! There is even a <em>midrash</em> (<em>Medrash Tadshe</em> cited in <em>Yalkut Shimoni</em>, <em>Yehoshua</em> 9) that includes Shifrah and Puah in a list of righteous female converts! This would certainly seem to directly contradict the identification of Shifrah and Puah with Jochebed and Miriam. Is this <em>midrash</em> simply arguing on the tradition cited by Rashi?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can answer this by expanding on what we discussed previously. If Jochebed and Miriam were merely the heads of a large group of many hundreds of midwives, then it is quite possible that at least some of those midwives were not Jewish. This would explain why the Torah is ambiguous about their national identity, because the midwives were actually a mixture of Jews and non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>If this is correct, then we have to ask ourselves what ultimately happened to the families of these non-Jewish God-fearing women, who risked their lives for the sake of the Jewish people. Is it possible that their children and grandchildren suffered the same fate as the other Egyptians during the Ten Plagues? Was that the ultimate destiny of the \"houses\" with which God rewarded these heroic midwives?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer is that these God-fearing midwives, having come face to face with the utter moral depravity of Egyptian society, chose to join the Jewish people in their slavery. (Thus, they would not even have been counted among the <em>erev rav</em>, which only joined the Jewish people when they left Egypt.) I believe this may be the underlying intent of the <em>midrash</em> that identifies Shifrah and Puah as righteous converts. In that midrash, Shifrah and Puah represent the God-fearing non-Jewish midwives who, having risked their lives for the sake of the Jewish people, chose to throw their lot in with them entirely.</p>\n\n\n",

But Lechatechilla, the SA (based on a deduction from the words of the Gemara by the Shut Harashba (¹), and according to the Zohar) says that  its good to make a point to take   a vessel. But it is not meykar Hadin. The nusach of the blessing itself makes allusion to the vesssel which is called natla. Bet Yosef makes the same deduction from the Gemara Berachot 15a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>he should heed the call of nature and wash his hands  (\"ויטול ידיו\")  and put on tefillin and recite the Shema' and say the tefillah:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>In Shulchan Aruch and commentators  on the page(¹),  nobody needs vessel  bediavad and everybody advised to use vessel  lechatechilla.</strong></p>\n\n<p>See SA OC 232, 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם יש לו מים וצריך ליטול ידיו כדי להתפלל אף על פי שאינו יודע להם שום לכלוך ולא יברך (יזועיין לעיל סימן צ\"ב סעיף ה').\n  הגה: ואפילו עומד מלמודו יטול ידיו יטלתפלה (מנהגים).\n  ואם אין לו מים מזומנים כאינו צריך ליטול:\n  ‏ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is true for Mincha and Arvit too. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>(¹): Thanks to @Avrohom Yitzchock I added this note:</sup> </p>\n\n<p>Someone asked the Rashba (the Shut is quoted in Bet Yosef  here) about the fact that the blessing for washing of the morning mentioned a vessel (natla)  when the halacha doesn't require this. </p>\n\n<p>Rashba answered with  <strong>four  arguments:</strong> </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The <em>custom everywhere</em>  is to wash with a vessel fulfilling the same conditions required for washing before a meal. </p></li>\n<li><p>Gemara in Chulin says that washing of morning can be useful for the subsequent meal, and for meal we need a vessel,  so the morning washing is also made with a vessel. </p></li>\n<li><p>Gemara uses different expressions for the washing before morning prayer and the washing before Shabbat. The verb  \"notel\" used for the morning washing refers to the vessel used. </p></li>\n<li><p>The specificity of the washing of  morning prayer is linked to the fact that  Chachamim made a special blessing for this washing.  A washing with a blessing of  asher kiddeshanu is a mitsva derabanan statuted  \"כעין דאורייתא \"  (similar to washing which are mitsvot of Tora)  i. e.  similar to kiddush Yadaym of  Kohanim,  which requires a vessel. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So,  for Rashba maybe that the blessing of netilat yadaym requires not only  lechatechilla,  but  perhaps even bediavad,  a vessel. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway,  the OP was asking for an opinion that allows without vessel at all even lechatechilla. For now I have not found such opinion in Acharonim (regarding netilat yadaym of mornings prayer). <em>But Rabenu Yerucham,  the Rosh,  the Hagahot Mordechai and the Ran didn't need keli,  even lechatechilla even for Shacharit.</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> All this issue regards the washing before morning prayer but for Mincha and Arvit I didn't find someone who needs a keli lechatechilla. The unique reason to require a vessel for morning prayer netilat is the text of blessing according to the Rashba.  Last opinions are more lenient than Rashba regarding the lechatechilla of the netila before Shacharit, a forciori regarding Mincha and Arvit. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I found three sources:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/1/4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Oruch Harav O Ch 4 (1)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>למעשה לחזר אחר מים גם לתפלת מנחה וערבית עד מיל אבל לא לברך שספק ברכות\n  להקל <strong>אך אין צריך ליטול מן הכלי</strong>  אלא יכול לשכשך בתוכו ואפילו אינו שלם\n  ואפילו במים שבקרקע ואפילו אין בהם רביעית ואפילו מים הפסולים לנטילת\n  ידים לסעודה  כי מאחר שנטילת ידים לתפלה אינה אלא משום נקיון אין צריך\n  כלי  ולא כח נותן  ולא מים כשרים ולא שאר דברים המעכבים בנטילת ידים\n  לסעודה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7720&hilite=16fa4a9a-33e4-4c8e-8fae-8da7c4b6e12d&st=%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D&pgnum=72\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketzos HaShulchan 12 (3)</a>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם הסיח דעתו מידיו אחר נט״י שחרית צריך לחזור וליטול ידיו  לק\"ש ולתפלה\n  אעפ\"י שאינו יודע להם שום לכלוך  (אבל  לת״ת ולשאר ברכות סתם ידים כשרות\n  ואין היסח הדעת פוסל בהם)  וצריך ליטול עד הפרק דהיינו עד חבור האצבעות\n  לכף היד ויקה עוד  מים בכפו וישפשף כפית הידים זו בזו לנקותם לקיים ארחץ\n  בנקיון  כפי. <strong>אך אינו צריך כלי ולא כח נותן  ולא מים כשרים ולא שאר דברים\n  המעכבים בנט״י לסעודה</strong> ואינו צריך לברך על נטילה זו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1376&st=%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%A7+%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D+&pgnum=93&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvas Rashba part 1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מדקאמר נוטל ידיו ולא קאמר רוחץ ידיו כמו שאמרי בערב רוחץ פניו ידיו\n  ורגליו. <strong>משמע לכאורה שצריך <em>בשחר</em> ליטול ידיו בכלי. ואם תשאל מאי שנא תפילה\n  השחר מתפילת מנחה וערבית</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>.......</p>\n\n\n",

However, from the wording quoted above it seems to me that he agrees with <em>R. Yochanan</em>. Moreover, my kid assumed (or learned?) that that's what <em>Resh Lakish</em> holds.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud continues:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>R.

He told him: A <em>suka</em>, which is fit for twilight (if he happens to have a meal [then], he must sit in it and eat in it), is <em>muktza</em> for twilight, and because it's <em>muktza</em> for twilight it's <em>muktza</em> for the whole eighth day. An <em>esrog</em>, which is not fit for twilight, is not <em>muktze</em> for twilight, so is not <em>muktze</em> for the whole eighth day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My kid asked:</p>\n\n<p>According to <em>Resh Lakish</em>, an <em>esrog</em> is forbidden during twilight at the start of the seventh day, yet becomes permitted during the seventh day. Yet a  <em>suka</em> is forbidden for use all of the eighth day because it's forbidden during twilight of the eighth day. What's the difference? Why isn't a <em>suka</em> permitted for use after its usage time is done, i.e. after twilight, just as an <em>esrog</em> is permitted for use after its usage time is done?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I will be glad to learn that <em>Resh Lakish</em> in fact does not agree with <em>R.

    "content": "# God is just, but is this world just in itself or when combined with the world to come?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>To expand,</p>\n\n<p>God is just and thus everything that happens is just. But does justice fully manifest itself in this world or a combination of this world and the world to come? </p>\n\n<p>For example if a 3 month old baby died. Can we say that the baby deserved to die since God is just?. Is it possible that the baby died because he would have been evil in the future?

Did every single person die because they deserved it or did some people die because of other people's sins? And thus justice will be meted out in the world to come for the people who didn't merit their own death. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yaaqov states on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.39b.21?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Qiddushin 39b</a>, \"שכר מצוה בהאי עלמא ליכא -- reward in this world is lacking.\" I am intentionally translating this ambiguously. It can be taken to mean \"there is no reward\" or that there is reward, but it's missing something. This is elaborated in a Beraisa (ibid and at Chullin ): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי יעקב אומר\n  אין לך כל מצוה ומצוה שכתובה בתורה שמתן שכרה בצדה שאין תחיית המתים תלויה בה</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Ya'akov says: There is no mitzvah written in the Torah that you are given its reward with it without depending on the resurrection of the dead.</p>\n  \n  <p>בכיבוד אב ואם כתיב (דברים ה, טו) למען יאריכון ימיך ולמען ייטב לך</p>\n  \n  <p>About honoring parents, it is written, \"In order that your days will be lengthened, and in order that it would be good for you\" (Deuteronomy 5:15).</p>\n  \n  <p>בשילוח הקן כתיב (דברים כב, ז) למען ייטב לך והארכת ימים</p>\n  \n  <p>About sending away the mother bird, it is written, \"In order that it\n  will be good for you and your days will be lengthened\" (Deuteronomy\n  22:7).</p>\n  \n  <p>הרי שאמר לו אביו\n  עלה לבירה והבא לי גוזלות ועלה לבירה ושלח את האם ונטל את הבנים ובחזירתו נפל ומת היכן טובת ימיו של זה והיכן אריכות ימיו של זה</p>\n  \n  <p>For when his father says to him,\n  \"Go up to the attic and bring me chicks!\" And he goes up to the attic, sends away the mother [bird], and takes the children, but on his return, he falls and dies. Where is the goodness of this one's days? Where are the lengthening of this one's days?</p>\n  \n  <p>אלא למען ייטב לך לעולם שכולו טוב ולמען יאריכון ימיך לעולם שכולו ארוך</p>\n  \n  <p>Rather, \"In order that it be good for you\"—in the world which is all good; \"And in order that your days will be lengthened\"—in the world which is all long. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Interestingly but tangential to your question, one of the storied the talmud gives for why the great tanna Elisha ben Avuyah became an apostate and nicknamed \"Acheir -- the Other\" was because he saw just this scene -- a son died sending away the mother bird to obey his father's request to get eggs -- and failed to see Divine Justice. Now the more interesting part -- R' Yaaqov was Acheir's grandson.)</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem from this gemara that Divine Justice is at best incomplete without taking people's fate in the World to Come into account.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Rabbi Gamliel the son of Rabbi Yehudah haNasi (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 2:5</a>) appears to assume that punishment is in this world:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַף הוּא רָאָה גֻלְגֹּלֶת אַחַת שֶׁצָּפָה עַל פְּנֵי הַמַּיִם. אָמַר לָהּ, עַל דַּאֲטֵפְתְּ, אַטְפוּךְ. וְסוֹף מְטִיפַיִךְ יְטוּפוּן:</p>\n  \n  <p>He also saw a skull that was floating on top of the water. He said (to it): \"Since you drowned [others, others] drowned you. And in the end, those that drowned you will be drowned. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Would Rabbi Gamliel III have said this if it was possible that in the end, those who drowned the person whose skull he found might be punished in the World-to-Come?</p>\n\n<p>It could be that this is a simple dispute. Or it could be that Rabbi Yaaqov's incomplete recompense in this world would necessarily include being punished for murdering. Or that Rabbi Gamliel meant \"drowning\" metaphorically -- \"those who drowned you will go through their own parallel suffering.\"</p>\n\n<p>Then there is Nachum ish Gimzo, who said \"גם זו לטובה -- this too is for the good\" (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.21a.32?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 21a</a>) that the other sages punned on the name of his hometown and called him Nachum ish \"Gam-zu\". And his student, Rabbi Aqiva, declared, \"כל דעביד רחמנא לטב עביד -- Everything the All-Merciful does, He does for the good.\" Meaning, that Hashem acts in this world terms of what will provide the best outcome for everyone involved. This is not always reward or punishment. And so we find Hashem holding off on punishment to give opportunity for teshuvah.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this is what motivates statements like <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.7a.75?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhos 7a</a> \"צדיק וטוב לו - צדיק גמור, צדיק ורע לו - צדיק שאינו גמור, רשע וטוב לו - רשע שאינו גמור, רשע ורע לו - רשע גמור -- a tzaqiq and life is good for him is a pure tzadiq; a tzadiq whose life is bad for him is an incomplete tzadiq, an evil person whose life is good for him is not entirely wicked, and an evil person whose life is bad for him is entirely wicked.\" Or <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.22a.6?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eiruvin 22a</a>, which says that Hashem will delay on repaying a wicked person for his evil, but not a good person for his infractions.</p>\n\n<p>A righteous person who is in a place where he could learn from his wrongdoing, may be woken up with tragedy in this world. A wicked person, it serves little point.</p>\n\n<p>Each gets what's best for them and for the world. Whether that means delaying punishment or reward until the afterlife, or receiving it in the here-and-now.</p>\n\n\n",

If I unknowingly have something in the bag that I didn't pay for, but when I went through this \"security check\" it wasn't noticed, do I have to return the item? My question is, does the fact that my bags were checked and this item wasn't noticed, make this into a case of ta'us akum in which case I would be allowed to keep it? Or does the fact that I put it into the bag (even accidently) make it into a ful-fledged act of stealing from a goy, and I would have to return it? An added point, is that even the checking of the bag might not make it into ta'us akum, since it often done in a perfunctory manner just to put some fear into customers but not to actually do a thorough check.</p>\n\n\n",

How long should he post these ads? Can he use them, as we may assume <em>ye'ush</em> - the lack of a response, perhaps, indicates that these items are <em>hefker</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>At first glance, one would probably say groceries can be considered lost items without <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Returning_Lost_Objects#Siman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>simanim</em></a> as groceries that one purchased from the store are going to look the same as the stuff in the store. As such, there would be no obligation to even attempt to find their owner and the finder could keep them. </p>\n\n<p>This may not be exactly true, though, as the unique combination of groceries in the bag could potentially be a <em>siman</em>. This would probably depend on how unique the items in the bag are and possibly some other factors. I would encourage you to ask a rabbi if this seems like a potential <em>siman</em> (and you are in an area that is largely populated by Jews [see next point]).</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, there is no obligation to return the lost items of non-Jews (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.266.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S.A. C.M. 266:1</a>). Additionally, one who finds a lost item in an area (in this case the supermarket) which is mostly populated by non-Jews, it is assumed that the owner will have given up hope of recovering the items (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.259.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S.A.

On the other hand, if you are in a supermarket which is mostly patronized by Jews (e.g. many kosher supermarkets even outside Israel), you should probably ask a rabbi if the contents of the bag are unique enough to be considered a <em>siman</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In general, there is no maximum length of time you are required to guard lost items with a <em>siman</em>. For easily replaceable items, you can sell them or note their value (by going back to the supermarket to check on their price) and use them (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.267.24?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S.A.

Here is a summary of the section that relates to your question, and I have looked through most of the sources, and can confirm that they are accurate:</p>\n\n<p>There is a discussion in Beis Yosef and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.99?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch YD 99</a>, as to whether or not in a case of Bittul, we will count dry bones (or the bone part minus the marrow part) of the non-kosher component as kosher or not.  Shulchan Aruch paskens (based on Ran, Rashba, Rosh, Rash, etc. mentioned in Beis Yosef there), that the dry bones count as part of the kosher component to help be Mevatel the non-kosher component.  Rema agrees in principle, but advises one to be Machmir if possible or if there is no major loss (he quotes a few opinions in Darchei Mosheh that would support such a view, such as Or Zarua, etc).    </p>\n\n<p>Deciding on this Halacha was (and still is, to some extent) a major source of controversy as it relates to gelatin, as gelatin can be made from non-kosher dry animal bones.  Various Poskim and Kashrus organizations have expressed their views.  The <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/gelatin-revisited/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OU claims</a> claims that the consensus in the United States was/is that such gelatin is considered \"non-kosher\".  The current discussion relates to other gelatin sources and production methods.</p>\n\n<p>The opinion of the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Foods.4.18?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maachalos Assuros 4:18</a>) is unclear, based on what you wrote above.  The main approaches outlined in the article are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Maggid_Mishneh_on_Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Foods.4.18.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magid Mishna there</a> - the Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.117b?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 117b</a>) quotes a Beraisa that the bones (similar to the skin, horns and other dry animal parts with no flavor) are not \"Mekabel Tumas Neveilah\", meaning, the rule of Neveilah (and by extension, non-kosher animals, as specified in the Rambam there) only applies to the edible, meat parts of the animal, not to these parts (although according to that Beraisa they are still considered food, as they are \"Mekabel Tumas Ochlin\").  Thus, the Rambam is referring to dry bones, and still says that they are not allowed to be eaten, likely for some Derabanan reason. (Note that the OU, in the article quoted above, Paskens like this understanding.)</li>\n<li>Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski (Achiezer 3:33:5) understands the Rambam as referring to bones with some marrow traces, and as a result, understands that for completely dry bones, (even) the Rambam would Pasken that it is completely permitted to eat them (against the question's assumption).  There is less of a question why the Rambam would write that they are prohibited according to his reasoning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The article does not discuss (in detail) reasons for why dry bones would be Assur or Muttar according to the Rambam.  Here are a few of the suggestions made by various mefarshim as I understand (see Frankel Sefer Hamafteach for sources):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No flavor (not Nosein Taam), thus Assur Miderabanan</li>\n<li>Considered Assur, but not a full Shiur (this is not the time and place for a discussion of Chatzi Shiur...)</li>\n<li>Not considered edible/food at all (the question's original assumption)</li>\n<li>Not considered to be \"meat\" and thus does not become Assur as meat</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, it is clear that many Poskim say that even dry bones of a non-kosher animal, such as a pig, are not to be eaten.  Even within the opinion of the Rambam there are a variety of understandings and final conclusions, as noted above.  The final ruling seems to be that it should be avoided for serious Halachic reasons, although there have certainly been Poskim who have permitted it in the past.</p>\n\n<p>(For further reading, with an emphasis on the 20th Century Teshuvos published on this topic, see <a href=\"https://tvunah.org/%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9F/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is the source with regards to nails in Chulin 121a תבן התם\n י החרטום <strong>והצפרנים</strong> מיטמאין ומטמאין\n ומצטרפין חרטום עץ בעלמא הוא אמר\n רבי אלעזר בחרטום תחתון תחתון נמי עץ\n בעלמא הוא אמר רב פפא תחתון של\n עליון צפרנים אמר רבי אלעזר מקום\n המובלעים בבשר קרנים אמר רב פפא\n <strong>במקום שחותכין ויוצא מהן דם</strong> The rambam seems to make a common denominator that any inedible animal parts where when taken off afresh blood spurts out, it has tumas ochel(food) because it is edible for some people, and therefore must not be eaten. This Gemora mentioned the nails which has to come of fresh with blood and the same goes with any dry part e.g bones horns hooves sinews. The skin and amniotic sac are also mentioned as contracting tumah because of being  edible to some people in rashi quoting Chullin 77a.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi also explains why they are tamei:כל מידי דמצי למיכליה ואע''ג דלאו אורחיה כדאמרן בפרק בהמה המקשה (לעיל דף עז:) <strong>עור ששלקו ושליא</strong> שחישב עליה מטמא טומאת אוכלין ונהי דתו לא הדר הוי בשר לענין טומאת נבלות דהא נעשה עור בבטולו הראשון אבל לאוכלו מיהא הוי לטמא טומאת אוכלין אם נגע בשרץ Since its possible to eat them as it says in chullin 77b Skin that was stewed, and an amniotic sac that one thought about eating, they contaminate other food with tuma of food (they are considerred Velad hatuma which can contaminate only other food), even though they don't contaminate people or vessels (this is a higher level of tuma called Av hatuma) with tumas neveila ( only completely edible parts have tumas neveila). This is because one nullifies the status of the skin as food when separating the meat out for consumption initially(showing that only the meat is the real food not the skin).The skin still has a lesser degree of tuma since some will still eat it so when it touches a sheretz it is tamei. </p>\n\n\n",

Is that meant in a literal sense? If so, how is this to be explained in a rational way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>The following I remember from a Sicha of the Lubavitcher Rebbe:</p>\n<p>Rashi at the end of Parshas VaYeira feels the need to explain why the \"news\" Abraham received about his family tree is written right after the Akeidah (or at all) ? He answers by showing the Medrash which states that once Issac went through the Akeidah, (at age 37) he was ready to marry, so the Torah announces Rivkah's birth (she is on the list received by Abraham). Since we know Issac married when he was 40, therefore Rivkah is 3 years old at her marriage.</p>\n<p>Tosfos to Yevamos 61b, brings an opposing Medrash which says she was married at age 14. (see Seder Olam Rabbah, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/145123/how-old-was-abraham-when-rebecca-isaacs-wife-was-born/145128#145128\">this answer</a>).</p>\n<p>The Rebbe (and other scholars) are bothered by the fact that the Torah calls Rivkah a \"naarah\" when Eliezer meets her. A naarah in Torah language can only be an older girl above 12 years of age. Otherwise, the Torah would use the word \"katanah\" if she were really physically 3.</p>\n<p>Based on this apparent contradiction, <em><strong>the Rebbe resolves it by saying the Seder Olam age of 14 is her physical age. The Medrash brought by Rashi, is not speaking physically, but spiritually.</strong></em> We know that Sarah passed away exactly at the time of the Akeidah. The Tanya explains that according to Kabbalah, a righteous person who dies, may sometimes be granted a mission to help a struggling living person in this world. The Tzadik/Tzadekes who passed has their soul reborn into the soul of their \"student\" on Earth, in order to help them overcome spiritual obstacles. This is called the secret of \"Ibur Neshamah\".</p>\n<p>Sarah was reborn into the soul of Rivkah at the Akeidah (right after Sarah's passing). Therefore, the Medrash calls her a \"three year old\" at her wedding. That is, three years since she was born with Sarah's soul (which happened when she was physically 11).</p>\n<p>Further proof that we are dealing with a living shared incarnation, is that Rivkah's arrival causes the return of Sarah's blessings (cloud, lights, dough). Issac is consoled \"after his mother\" and \"brings her to his mother's tent\" specifically. (Gen. 24:67)</p>\n<p>In addition, I say that the \"news\" Abraham receives could not possibly have happened all at once. It is a long family tree with the report of many births over a long time. There is no reason to say Rivkah, who is on the list, was born exactly then (at the Akeidah when the news was sent) unless we are speaking of a spiritual birth.</p>\n<p>So, Rivkah was 14 when she married Issac. She was 3 years old as a combined soul with Sarah.</p>\n<p>The problem many people have with this IMHO, is that they only know the Rashi (not Tosfos and other meforshim) and take Rashi very literally on his use of a Medrash. But Medrashim were not usually meant to be used literally!</p>\n<p>Therefore they find themselves stuck choosing between defending their faith (she was 3) and facing rational objection (how did she do the camel marathon...child marriage etc.)</p>\n<p>The fact is, its just not a problem.</p>\n<p>Yes, there were cases of ancients who were physically stronger and more mature at younger ages. The Gemara does show this to be the case. However, it does not seem to be so regarding Rivkah Imeinu.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rav Schwab, in his sefer \"Meiyun Beis Hashoeva\", explains Rivka being 14.5 using a similar approach to that of Lubavitcher Rebbe mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>An English summary of the approach can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.nachumsegal.com/taking-closer-look-parshas-toldos-rabbi-dov-kramer-5774/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.nachumsegal.com/taking-closer-look-parshas-toldos-rabbi-dov-kramer-5774/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi is simply explaining why Yitzchak is 40 to get married when he was brought to be sacrificied at 37.

Well, what about non-bread foods from the Five Grains? The Gemara (36b) says that Mezonos was instituted by Rav and Shmuel. </p>\n\n<p>What brachah did the Tannaim make on those foods that we now make a Mezonos on? Did they make a Ha'adamah, since they're from the ground? Did they make a Hamotzi, and they equated all of the Five Grains to bread? Or did they make a Shehakol, since it's ground up beyond the point of recognition, or because that's the standard nondescript Brachah if nothing else fits (and it fits all foods, at least bedieved)? I would assume the last category as least likely, that these foods are worse off than Ha'adamah, and for the same reason I don't think not making a brachah is even an option. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if it's possible to answer this question, but I'm really curious if there's an answer out there. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<h3>Rav and Shmuel did not  institute the blessing \"mezonot\".</h3>\n<p>Rav and Shmuel taught two laws, each of which contains new information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The novelty of the one is that only the 5 species needs mezonot,  <strong>excluding orez and dochan</strong>. This sentence is rejected  by a <em>tyuvta</em> in 37a (\"תיובתא דרב ושמואל תיובתא\"). <strong>For the Gemara it was  not only obvious that the blessing of 5 species is mezonot, but after the proof from a berayta, the conclusion is that orez and dochan also needs Mezonot against Rav and Shmuel.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The novelty of the other sentence is about  mixtures, explaining that the 5 minim component is the  Ykar and \"wins\"  the  blessing according to the principle of Ykar Vetafel, <strong>even if it is not in volumetric majority.</strong>  This last rule is relevant for us in halacha. It is relevant not only for the 5 species but also to differentiate them from  <em>orez and dochan</em> which also have the beracha of mezonot but are different when mixed. Orez and dochan are not necessarily the Ykar when mixed - only if they are the majority of the mixture.  So for a mixture containing orez and other components e.g. which need ha'adama, the blessing follows the majority and would be ha'adama if the orez is not the majority.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tana'im did bless the same bracha as us.</p>\n<p>See for instance the Berayta in 37a, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it has been taught: He says before partaking, 'Who createst various kinds of foods', and after it, he says one blessing which includes three? - It is on a par with cooked dishes in one way and not in another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Don't ask why, just go with it. </p>\n\n<p>Reuven owns an inn. Several months later, some guys called up Reuven and asked if they could stop by his hotel some time during the following week, to which Reuven graciously agreed, even promising to bake them bread when they arrived. </p>\n\n<p>Sure enough, they came on Tuesday. </p>\n\n<p>Now, at the time of the second shevuah, it was <em>possible</em> that it would be unable to be fulfilled, but it was more likely than not that he would be able to fulfill it. Do we say that the shevuah still stands? If so, what does that mean for Reuven, who has to choose between his two oaths? </p>\n\n<p>Assuming that the second oath remains in effect, does anything change if not fulfilling his second shevuah results in a loss of money (they'll slander him and cause a loss of customers)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Mishna Nedarim 2, 2 - 3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...

This excludes one who swears to annul a precept, and did not annul it, because it is not optional! - One verse is to exempt him from the sacrifice due for [violating] an oath, and the other is to exempt him [from punishment for having violated] the injunction concerning an oath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we can deduct that if he made a first oath not to bake bread on Tuesday, and afterward to bake a bread on Tuesday. The second oath does exist but has no  lav and no  Korban  because of the first oath. If he cancels the first oath, the duty toward the second oath would be started (the second oath will \"find a space\" according to the words of Gemara Shevuot 27b). In the case of the OP, I think that the second oath is not relevant regarding Lav and Korban  for the case in which people came Tuesday. You are right that somewhat is present but potentially only (it has no \"space\"). (see  Gemara Nedarim 18a, Shevuot 27b and Rambam Haflaa, Shevuot 6, 17 with explanations of Kesef Mishne and Radbaz) </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, Reuven cannot bake bread. If he can make a \"sheela\" to the Bet Din, to find a heter, very good, if not, he cannot bake. Someone else need to bake the bread.\nLoss of money is not relevant without hatarat shevuot, but for petach and charata this can perhaps count. As a Mishna with Rabbi Akiva (Nedarim 9, 5).</p>\n\n\n",

Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. The law of nature, as determined by nature, is universal.\"</p>\n<p>Most of the the thought on natural law has been pioneered by the Christian Philosophers. Does this philosophy have basis in the works of Jewish Philosophy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a set of three stories in the Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.77?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 31a</a>) in which a candidate for conversion approaches Shammai with a desire to convert, \"but only if...\" And after Shammai chases the person away, the person goes to Hillel who does convert them. The most famous of the three is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מעשה בנכרי אחד שבא לפני שמאי. אמר לו: \"גיירני על מנת שתלמדני כל התורה כולה כשאני עומד על רגל אחת.\" דחפו באמת הבנין שבידו. בא לפני הלל, גייריה. אמר לו: \"דעלך סני, לחברך לא תעביד! - זו היא כל התורה כולה, ואידך - פירושה הוא, זיל גמור.</p>\n<p>A story about a non-Jew who came before Shammai. [The non-Jew] said to [Shammai], “Convert me on the condition that you teach me the entire Torah while I stand on one foot.” [Shammai] chased him away with the builder’s measuring stick that was in his hand. [The non-Jew] came before Hillel [with the same request] and he converted him. [Hillel] said to him, “That which you loath, do not do to others. That is the whole Torah. Go study!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Hillel, the central principle of the entire Torah is the law of empathy. (To coin a general term for the idea that finds various expressions here, in the Christian Golden Rule, the notion of Karma, etc...) So it would seem that all of Torah unfolds from this kind of Natural Morality.</p>\n<p>And so too in the reverse. If there is a dispute over some law in halakhah and a voice from heaven were to declare what the rule would be, we still follow the halachic process rather than the prophetic voice. There is a famous story about this but I will leave it to you to search for \"<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.59b.5/en/Sefaria_Community_Translation?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanur shel Achnai</a>\" and I'll skip right to the prooftext. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.11/en/The_Rashi_chumash_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 30:11-14</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי הַמִּצְוָה הַזֹּאת אֲשֶׁר אָנֹכִי מְצַוְּךָ הַיּוֹם לֹא-נִפְלֵאת הִוא מִמְּךָ וְלֹא רְחֹקָה הִוא. לֹא בַשָּׁמַיִם הִוא לֵאמֹר, \"מִי יַעֲלֶה-לָּנוּ הַשָּׁמַיְמָה וְיִקָּחֶהָ לָּנוּ וְיַשְׁמִעֵנוּ אֹתָהּ וְנַעֲשֶׂנָּה?\" וְלֹא-מֵעֵבֶר לַיָּם הִוא לֵאמֹר, \"מִי יַעֲבָר-לָנוּ אֶל-עֵבֶר הַיָּם וְיִקָּחֶהָ לָּנוּ, וְיַשְׁמִעֵנוּ אֹתָהּ וְנַעֲשֶׂנָּה?\" כִּי-קָרוֹב אֵלֶיךָ הַדָּבָר מְאֹד, בְּפִיךָ וּבִלְבָבְךָ, לַעֲשֹׂתוֹ.</p>\n<p>For this commandment that I command you today is not a wonder to you nor is it remote. It is not in the heaven, for you to say, “Who will ascend to heaven for us, and grasp it for us, so that we can hear it and perform it?” And it is not on the other side of the sea, for you to say, “Who will cross the sea for us, and grasp it for us, so that we can hear it and perform it?” Rather, the matter is very close to you, in your mouth and heart, to perform it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The translation of these verses is an encouraging message that obserrvance is in our reach. However, hermeneutically, \"it is not in heaven\" is taken to mean that since the Torah was given to us during the Exodus, no more halakhah will be given to us from heaven. But let's look at the rest of the pragraph, the \"why\" -- \"the matter is very close to you, in your mouth and heart, to perform it.\"</p>\n<p>Just as all of halakhah derives from Natural Morality, only a person with Natural Morality, \"close... in ... mouth and heart\" is empowered to interpret it.</p>\n<p>The only problem is that because the Torah's Author is better informed about what the other would loathe in the longest run than we are, halakhah can override a naive Natural Moral decision. (A natural one?) Same motives, different results.</p>\n<p>And there are numerous halakhos that presuppose a duty to follow Natural Morality. See Devarim 6:18,\"וְעָשִׂ֛יתָ הַיָּשָׁ֥ר וְהַטּ֖וֹב בְּעֵינֵ֣י ה֑׳ לְמַ֙עַן֙ יִ֣יטַב לָ֔ךְ – and you shall do what is the honest and the good in Hashem’s ‘Eyes’, so that He shall benefit to you…” and the Ramban there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And according to our rabbis, they said about this a beautiful medrash: This is about compromise and staying within the limits of the law. The intent in this is that at that beginning He says that you should observe His statutes and testimonies which He commands, and now it says also about those things he didn’t command – set your mind on doing the right and the honest in His “Eyes” because He Loves the good and the honest.</p>\n<p>This is an important topic, because it is impossible for the Torah to mention every activity a person has with his neighbors and friends and all his interactions, all his buying and selling, and the norms of communities and countries. But after it mentions many of them, like “Do not go around as a gossip,”  “do not take revenge and do not bear a grudge,”  “do not stand by your peer’s blood,”  “do not curse the deaf,”  “rise up before the elderly”  and the like, it returns to say as a general rule that he should to what is good and honest in everything. Until he enters through this into compromise and staying within the limits of the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Rav Shimon Shkop (Shaarei Yosher 5:1) says something similar about the basis of fiscal halakhos in particular:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we seek to determine the rights or liabilities with respect to asset, we are not engaged in a question relating to the observance of a mitzvah.  Instead, we are asking a question regarding ownership on the basis of the rules established by the the rules of justice.</p>\n<p>And it is on this basis that the Talmudic rabbis announced the rules that apply when ownership of an asset is in doubt.  Certainly it was based on rational discernment that the rules of justice will rule that in a case where a pregnant cow was sold but it was not known whether the calf was born before or after the sale, the calf will belong to the (seller, the) party in possession...  And it is clear that the prohibition against theft means that one cannot take property that that the rules of the civil law has assigned to another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Halakhah presumes Natural Morality as a starting point, and adds to it G-d's more informed perspective and rules for becoming the kinds of people more capable of living up to it. And <strong>that</strong> is the entire Torah \"on one foot.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This was the premise of the studies of an Englishman named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Selden\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">John Selden</a>.

The idea is that the Torah doesn't waste words, so it shouldn't have to teach us this <em>halakha</em>; we should just <em>know</em> it.</p>\n<p>The classic example of such a law is \"המוציא מחברו עליו הראיה\". This <em>halakha</em> teaches us that if someone sues another person, the burden of proof is upon the person who wants to take something from his fellow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי שמואל בר נחמני מניין להמוציא מחבירו עליו הראיה שנאמר מי בעל דברים יגש אליהם יגיש ראיה אליהם מתקיף לה רב אשי הא <strong>למה לי קרא סברא הוא</strong> דכאיב ליה כאיבא אזיל לבי אסיא</p>\n<p>Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani said, \"From where do we learn that the burden of proof is upon the person who would take from his fellow?

If not, how do the commentators deal with why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/parsha/peninim/archives/pninim57_58/shemos.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">medrash</a>, after Moshe was put into the water, the astrologers (who had warned him before) came and told him that the baby he was worried about had been cast into the Nile. Thus, he did not anticipate that Moshe would be that leader. Note that he only made the decree on the newborns so that he could get away with this for the short period of time that he needed. Once the astrologers told him that it was no longer needed, he immediately dropped it. He would not have been able to suddenly reinstate it for an older child (especially his grand-son).</p>\n\n<p>Another point is that having raised Moshe as an Egyptian prince, and having put him in charge of the slaves, Par'o felt that he had co-opted him and actually made him part of the governing structure. As the head \"taskmaster\" it could also be thought that the Israelites would never accept him as a leader in any case. It was only after Moshe killed the taskmaster that Par'o realized that he was rebelling and ordered him put to death.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this myopia could have been a \"hidden miracle\" in order to ensure that he would grow up and be trained to become a leader. There are commentaries that point out that it was because Moshe was not raised among the Jews that they would accept him as a leader. Even so, look at how Dasan and Aviram reacted when Moshe rebuked them for fighting.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It could be that he felt for his daughter and did not want to take a child off her. To bring the point home, she may have had no kids of her own and we do not know how old she was. She probably had to beg her father to some extent before he gave in, but there is no point in the pesukim describing the family dynamics, so they don't.</p>\n\n<p>We also don't know the reason for Par'oh wanting to get rid of all Jewish males. The Midrash says that he was afraid of a new renaissance leader, but on the peshat level it seems quite irrational. Why did he not destroy the entire nation, including the women? Also the decree did not seem to last long because there were manslaves of Moshe's age and younger that left Egypt. It may have been Par'oh's cruel humour, to make the Israelite parents anxious and show that they are not in control of their own children's destiny. You can almost hear the women crying at the sight of a baby boy, knowing that he would get drowned. If the purpose of killing the males was a sport to scare the Israelites, that was not applicable for a baby that had been abandoned by it's parents in a basket in the Nile.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Sorry for the lack of sources, but Rambam says that PESHAT can be worked out without reference to Mefarshim or Chazal!</p>\n\n\n",

My addition.) instead of purifying himself. As a result, people will think that Mikve - and touching items that require one to be purified - do not require concentration.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ט:</strong> הַכּוֹפֵת יָדָיו וְרַגְלָיו וְיָשַׁב לוֹ בְּאַמַּת הַמַּיִם אִם נִכְנְסוּ מַיִם דֶּרֶךְ כֻּלּוֹ טָהוֹר. הַקּוֹפֵץ לְתוֹךְ הַמִּקְוֶה הֲרֵי זֶה מְגֻנֶּה. <strong>וְהַטּוֹבֵל פַּעֲמַיִם בַּמִּקְוֶה הֲרֵי זֶה מְגֻנֶּה</strong>. וְהָאוֹמֵר לַחֲבֵרוֹ כְּבשׁ יָדְךָ עָלַי בַּמִּקְוֶה הֲרֵי זֶה מְגֻנֶּה:‏</p>\n<p><strong>כסף משנה</strong>  הכופת ידיו ורגליו וכו'. תוספתא דמקואות רפ''ח. ונראה דהיינו לומר דהיכא דלא טבל כדרך גדילתו בודקין אותו ואם נכנסו המים בכל המקומות שהיה נכנס אילו טבל כדרך גדילתו עלתה לו טבילה ואם לאו לא עלתה לו טבילה: הקופץ לתוך המקוה וכו'. שם ספ''ה. וכתב הריב''ש בתשובה שרבינו מפרש מפני שהקופץ למקוה אף אם מתכוין לטבול <strong>הרואים סבורים שאינו מתכוין אלא להקר וכן הטובל פעמיים כיון שטבל כראוי למה חוזר וטובל יחשבו שאינו טובל אלא להקר</strong> ואם יגע בתרומה וקדשים יהיו סבורים דלא בעי כוונה עכ''ל.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that even for Trumah and Kodshim - which require absolute purification in a Mikve - dipping once is all that is required.</p>\n<p><sup>Anybody who dips more than once will need to explain himself.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Isaac Yehuda Yechiel of Komarno suggests the following intention: he writes in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9004&st=&pgnum=176&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Shulchan HaTahor</em> pg.172</a> in ha'arah 16 brings from the The Pri Eitz Chaim(Shaar Shabbas 84 and Shaar Hakavanos pg.73) the intention for the initial immersion is that water has the ability to extinguish. We should ask God that He allow the waters of the <em>mikvah</em> to extinguish the burning desires to do bad, the fire of the wrong passions.

But to address your question:</sup></p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01139.html#HtmpReportNum0034_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagiga 19a</a> discusses what would happen if you had a Mikveh with precisely the minimum 40 Se'ah. Once one person dips, then next person is left with a non-Kosher Mikveh, as the water that is on the first person is now missing. There's an argument as to what happens if the first person still has his feet in the Mikveh.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda is of the opinion that as long as all the water is still connected to the Mikveh - for example, the first person's feet are still in the water - then the second person can dip and it's a Kosher Mikveh.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemarah goes so far as to ask that according to Rabbi Yehuda can one toivel needles in the first person's wet hair, if he's still standing in the water.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch paskens in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01976_part_30.html#HtmpReportNum0000_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן רא - דיני המקוה ומימיו</a> that once the first person emerges from the water, the Mikveh is already missing some water.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סב:</strong> מִקְוֶה שֶׁיֵּשׁ בּוֹ מ' סְאָה מְצֻמְצָמוֹת, הָאָדָם הַטּוֹבֵל בְּתוֹכוֹ לֹא יִקְפֹּץ לְתוֹכוֹ, שֶׁלֹּא יַחְסְרוּ הַמַּיִם בִּקְפִיצָתוֹ בְּתוֹכוֹ; וְלֹא יִטְבֹּל בּוֹ  פַּעֲמַיִם זֶה אַחַר זֶה; <strong>טָבְלוּ בּוֹ שְׁנַיִם זֶה אַחַר זֶה, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁרַגְלָיו שֶׁל רִאשׁוֹן נוֹגְעוֹת בַּמַּיִם, הַשֵּׁנִי בְּטֻמְאָתוֹ</strong>, שֶׁהֲרֵי חָסְרוּ הַמַּיִם מֵאַרְבָּעִים סְאָה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Point being, that whichever limbs are no longer submerged are considered to be disconnected from the Mikveh - and immersing them would once again be a Tevila.</p>\n\n<p>So every time you splash your hand out of the water, even if it's still wet, it would be as if you exited and reentered the Mikveh.</p>\n\n<p>However, if all you're doing is creating a wave, so that your hand didn't emerge from the water even though it's above the water line, then you are still immersed.</p>\n\n<p>So once you start splashing really fast you are probably not Toiveling multiple times anymore.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Getting a parking ticket in order to help a parent\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My mother asks me to help her carry in some stuff into her apartment. I can't find a legal parking spot. Does the mitzvah of kibud av vi'eim require that I double park and take a chance at getting a $75 ticket in order to help her? I'm aware of the basic din that one doesn't have to spend their own money on kibud av but was wondering if this would be different because of a)it is only a safek loss because there's a significant chance that I won't get a ticket b) theoretically I could probably find a spot far away if I would drive around at which point I could run back to my mother's place and help her. It might be a big tircha and difficult it wouldn't be a monetary loss which would mean that I'm choosing to take the monetary loss because of my own convenience and c)maybe having to pay a fine for double parking is not halachically considered as using money for kibud av since it is an indirect expense. It's not like spending your money to buy a bagel for your father who is hungry. </p>\n\n\n",

However, instead of a hinge connecting the top and the bottom, imagine that the top part, where the book rests, has 2 narrow strips of wood on its underside. the box part (bottom of the stand) has two grooves on the top of the box. To construct the shtender, you slide the top piece into the groves of the bottom piece. Similar, in a sense to some wooden crates that have a slide-on lid.</p>\n\n<p>Can this shtender be made on Shabbat?

I want just to try to find some sources in Shass. My approach  is to help  understand (partially)  halacha only. For this we need  a quick review  of Chazal.</p>\n\n<p>There are three issues in halachic terminology:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hachana, </li>\n<li>Daber Davar, </li>\n<li>Oneg Shabbat. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Apparently the prohibition of preparing (<strong>Hachana</strong>) is addressed in Gemara (Eruvin 38b Kushia of Abaye,  see there in Chidushei Harashba) for a <em>physical effort,</em>   e..g.  walking a great distance to make an eruv. Regarding speaking the prohibition addressed is \"Daber Davar\". In Mishna Shabbat (see Talmud Bavli 113a) there are examples of technical preparation for bed-making, vessels washing and folding clothes.   For thinking or reading alone no prohibition I didn't find sources calling them Hachana (contrarily, the Gemara allows: \"hirhur mutar\",  Shabbat 113b). </p>\n\n<p>To read secular matter in Shabbat is discussed e. g.  Medicine or astronomy and is an independent issue. </p>\n\n<p>At first glance if somewhat is permitted to study \"per se\" the day of Shabbat,  no problem if the intent is to achieve a test. If the matter itself is not allowed on Shabbat,  obviously we cannot learn it,  even without test issue. </p>\n\n<p>Studying, if the intent is the test only, may perhaps may perhaps be prohibited because of \"<strong>Daber Davar</strong>\", your speaking of Shabbat needs to be different than your speaking of Yom Chol. If he learns by speaking and not thinking only,  and speak alone,  it is not a \"performative speaking\" but rather  a thinking equivalent,  it's  not relevant  in matter of Dabber Davar. But we know that even thinking is not good because ofthe cancellation of the positive mitsva of \"<strong>Oneg Shabbat</strong>\". </p>\n\n<p>An additional reason to allow secular activities is the \"mitsvatic\"content associated with them. E.g. asking for own lost object.   If there is a mitsva in the speaking with others e. g.  in way to generate mitsva of hashavat aveda,  it is allowed.  We can imagine a mitsva for at student in diverse ways. </p>\n\n<p>This answer  is not halachically relevant because some poskim cited in the answer of NJM prohibited due to hachana. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>No, you can't study whatsoever during Shabbat, except Torah, and even Torah you shouldn't study too hard, just read and let yourself go. Some people are more lenient and admit reading secular books. Reading, not studying. The books however should in no way defile the sanctity of Shabbat. For instance, don't read comics or glossy mags. It doesn't matter you're having a test, it doesn't matter whether the test is about Torah or not, it doesn't matter that you have an important issue in your life. You must organise your life so that nothing clashes with Shabbat. It doesn't matter that you didn't organise your life better and now, unless you study during Shabbat, you'll fail and you'll have to repeat a whole school year. Are you going to tell Hashem that the convenience for you of not having a whole school year wasted is more imporant than His Shabbat? In Shabbat you dedicate yourself totally heart and soul to Shabbat, you even fight thinking of earthly matters that keep your mind worried. Only protection of life takes precedence from Shabbat. And not only when you're almost dying, suppose for instance that you need to take a medicine everyday no exceptions and that medicine must be cooked only moments before administration. You can't prepare it in advance and you can't instruct before Shabbat a goy to have it ready for you in the moment you need it. There's no way out. You need to cook with fire during Shababt to take the medicine. You won't die if you don't take it, at least not today, but you'll scramble the whole therapy. Then you make the fire during Shabbat. Is there a situation when studying could be in place of making a fire? Maybe. Suppose for instance someone gets sick during Shabbat and you are not sure which medicine he should take and you'll have to spend some time studying literature and enquirying. Then you do, even if the person will eventually only take the medicine after Shabbat. If your refraining from studying during Shabbat will delay the person's treatment and endanger his life/health, then you start studying during Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=3880\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=3880</a> says sefaradim are not allowed to study anything but Torah during Shabbat, though ashkenazim are, as long as it is not for such an activity as prohibited during Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n",

So do we find in the case of Cain, who slew his brother. It reads [Gen. iv. 10]: \"The voice of the 'bloods' of thy brother are crying unto me from the ground.\" It does not read \"blood,\" but \"bloods,\" which means his blood and the blood of his descendants. [According to others it reads \"bloods\" in the plural, because his blood was scattered all over the trees and stones.] Therefore the man was created singly, to teach that he who destroys one soul of a human being, the Scripture considers him as if he should destroy a whole world, and him who saves one soul of Israel, the Scripture considers him as if he should save a whole world. And also because of peace among creatures, so that one should not say: My grandfather was greater than yours; and also that the heretic shall not say: There are many creators in heaven; and also to proclaim the glory of the Holy One, blessed be He. For a human being stamps many coins with one stamp, and all of them are alike; but the King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, has stamped every man with the stamp of Adam the First, and nevertheless not one of them is like the other.

Moshe Feinstein</a> that seems to address the underlying issue of doing something forbidden now in order to be able to help in a potential future case of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pikuach nefesh</a></em>. The question he was addressing was whether a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kohen</a></em> could attend medical school if he would have to be exposed to <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_uncleanness\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tum'at meit</a></em> (which is forbidden for a <em>kohen</em>). Someone had apparently advanced the argument that the prohibition of becoming <em>tamei</em> should be overridden by <em>pikuach nefesh</em>, since, as a doctor, the <em>kohen</em> would be saving lives. R. Feinstein responded to this particular argument (he addressed several other points as well) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל מתיר מצד אחר דפקוח נפש וזהו שטות והבל שלא ניתן לבר דעת לומר כלל שאף אם לא היה שום רופא בעולם ליכא חיוב מצד פקוח נפשות ללמוד חכמת הרפואה דהחיוב דפקוח נפש איכא לכל אדם שיציל חברו במה שיכול שאם הוא רופא מחויב להציל חולה מחליו אבל ליכא חיוב שילמוד חכמת הרפואה כדי להציל חולה מחליו וכמו בצדקה שאם יש לו לאדם ממון מחויב ליתן צדקה אבל ליכא חיוב על האדם לעשות מסחרים ולהתעשר כדי ליתן צדקה</p>\n<p>But he permits it from a different angle, that it is <em>pikuach nefesh</em>. And this is folly and nonsense that is not appropriate at all for someone with intelligence to say. For even if there was no doctor in the world there would be no obligation, on account of <em>pikuach nefesh</em>, to study medicine. This is because <em>pikuach nefesh</em> [means] that each person has to save his fellow in whatever way he can – if he is a doctor he is obligated to save an ill person from his illness. But there is no obligation to study medicine in order to save an ill person from his illness, just like by <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzedakah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tzedakah</a></em> where if someone has money he is obligated to give <em>tzedakah</em>, but there is no obligation on a person to engage in business [in order] to become wealthy in order to give <em>tzedakah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we transfer this reasoning over to the case here, we should say that just like we don't have to study medicine (and therefore are not allowed to if it violates some other prohibition) because someone might later die that we could have saved had we studied medicine, we also don't have to maintain a working defibrillator (and therefore are not allowed to if it violates some other prohibition) because someone might later die that we could have saved had we had one.</p>\n\n\n",

(To keep this answer neutral, you can look into the source about to be quoted yourself by searching what Rabbi Meir Simcha Lerner does in Lakewood). Still, Rabbi Lerner <a href=\"https://www.thelakewoodscoop.com/news/2020/06/yeshiva-pirchei-shoshanim-launches-toen-rabbani-course.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">provides a rational Halachic source for To'anim</a> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Halacha states in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.17.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat (Siman 17, Seif 9)</a>, \"If a Dayan sees that a litigant is struggling to explain their arguments in an important matter, then it is permissible to assist him in formulating his argument as the posuk in <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2831.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei (31:8)</a> 'P'sach picha l'elaim' or 'you should open your mouth on behalf of the mute' as long as you are careful not to be <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">k'orchei hadayanim</a>.\" This [has been learned to] mean(s) the Dayan cannot become the litigant's advocate. It is clear from this halacha that a Dayan can accommodate litigants stating their case, but the Dayan needs to maintain an open mind for all sides in the case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemora in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.117b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kama 117b</a> tells the story of Rav Abba, who incurred damage and was advised to go to a certain Bais Din that was known to rule in favor of people who incurred such damages. Rav Abba followed the advice and was successful in his Din Torah. [Also,] (a)s mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shevuot.31a.13?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Shevuot.31b.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos, Shavuos 31A</a>, the Torah considers it a great mitzvah to help a person retrieve money or settle financial matters [and disputes].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Evidence of using the term To'en is found in [Shu\"t] responsa from the 15th Century and on. There is also a teshuva in the 1400s from Rabbi Yisroel Bruna, an Ashkenazi Rav who was a primary source for the Rama, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42821&st=%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%9F&pgnum=105&hilite=d8891d5e-9f47-4eb2-92a4-c3e572457fde\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discussing the question of whether a To'en can switch sides in the case</a> [proving that To'anim have been used in Bais Din for years]. The S\"MA, Rabbi Yehoshua Falk, a talmid of the Rama, at the turn of the 17th Century, wrote in his Sefer on the Shulchan Aruch that it is already an accepted practice to have [one's] (your) case presented by an advocate [to'en] and there can be no objection to this. It is also known that To'anim were frequently present in the Bais Din of the Ha'fla-ah, Rabbi Pinchus Ha[L]evi Horowitz in the 1700s.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>It seems that Rabbi Lerner disproves the common notion that the use of To'anim in a Bais Din was influenced by the American court system's use of lawyers. His multiple sources of To'anim being used in Eastern Europe before America was even a country is apparent</strong> and follows through in the quoted texts (not found online, you're welcome to search your local Bais Medrash).</p>\n<p>Regarding the fairness of the Bais Din system works in our times, there are many issues with both the Dayanim and the To'anim <a href=\"https://vosizneias.com/2011/10/11/new-york-in-exclusive-ami-magzine-intreview-noted-rabbi-schachter-slams-set-up-of-rabbinical-court-system/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">based on Ami Magazine's article interviewing Dayan Schachter from 2011</a>. I am not sure one can confidently say that the system has been improved since 2011.</p>\n<p>Some of the noted issues with To'anim, as you ask and mentioned by Dayan Schacter, is that they're known to act very similar to the aggressive manner of lawyers in America's secular courts, where they obstruct litigants from answering questions directly asked by the Dayanim, and ultimately obstruct Yosher (justice).</p>\n<p>In Eretz Yisrael, there is a <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%9F_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">more formal Bais Din system</a> that is part of the justice system. Although it has its wide criticism for fairness and Yosher (justice) similar to the criticisms of the private Baisei Dinim in America, at least the system does have a more formal structure to qualify To'anim, including a <a href=\"https://www.gov.il/he/departments/topics/toanim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">required license to be a To'en Rabbani</a>. The licensure is contrary to how anybody can be a To'en in America, although we often find that they're usually lawyers and sometimes also Rabbis.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue is the general concept from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot (1:8)</a> \"אל תעש עצמך כעורכי הדיינים\" which literally is telling the Dayanim not to act as lawyers for their litigants, as was mentioned by the quote from Rabbi Lerner, above. Although it doesn't mean that it excludes To'anim's ability for representing litigants (as contrarily, one can argue that the Mishna is a source in itself for the To'anim system.) Still, the Mishna's clear instruction to Dayanim is an issue we see with the Borerim system.</p>\n<p>In the Borerim system, a Bais Din is formed by each litigant selecting their Dayan and the two Dayanim select a third Dayan. It's often considered straight shochad (bribery) in many talmidei chachamim's opinions because each litigant has to pay their Dayan for one-on-one sessions (where Dayanim often guide the litigants like lawyers/To'anim). Litigants then also pay for the Dayanim's time in Bais Din, where often the litigant who paid their Dayan the most usually wins the Din Torah, according to <a href=\"https://vosizneias.com/2011/10/11/new-york-in-exclusive-ami-magzine-intreview-noted-rabbi-schachter-slams-set-up-of-rabbinical-court-system/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dayan Schachter.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Your question is valid where money is often the major factor, and the litigant that pays most often gets his/her way.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

First, the midrash Rashi cites also notes that the deaths of these Jews occured within the first three days of the plague, enabling those who survived the deceased to also bury them before the Egyptians saw them dying. It follows that people would notice a phenomenon as it was unfolding, but not so much post facto. Moreover, it appears logically sound to my thinking that the ruling class would not particularly take note of changes in the slave caste; this coupled with the fact that the Egyptians were surely wrapped up in their own sorrows and suffering it's not so far fetched to say that they simply never noticed. </p>\n\n<p>And, most of the Jews lived in Goshen so it's possibly another reason why the Egyptians wouldn't necessarily be aware of what had happened.</p>\n\n<p>I will look into it though!</p>\n\n\n",

In the words of the Tosfos Yom-Tov:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמנם מה שהיה חולק על ר\"ע הוא במשא ומתן של הדין על צד הויכוח, לא שהוא\n  יסבור כך</p>\n  \n  <p>Concerning his disagreement with Rabbi Akiva, this was only in the\n  give and take of the law and for the sake of an argument, and not\n  because he actually thought this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tiferes Yisrael suggests the same thing (דרך פלפול בעלמא), but as the second of two possibilities - the first being that Rabbi Ishmael believed that snow <em>doesn't</em> count towards the completion of a mikvah and that he subsequently changed his mind. I prefer that suggestion myself, since it has Rabbi Ishmael arguing with sincerity, but am intrigued by the other.</p>\n\n<p>Normally, I would have thought, if a person chooses to \"play devil's advocate\" they indicate to their opponent that this is what they're doing, but Rabbi Ishmael allowed Rabbi Akiva to walk away believing that this was actually his opinion. Are there any sources (obviously, aside from this one) that this is a respectable thing to do?

Is it because my added weight (however infinitesimally) increases the payload of the vehicle and causes it to burn more petrol?

For all the reasons mentioned above by someone called TheSicilianJew. Because buses are what they are. Unless it's a special kind of bus, such as the lifts used during Shabbat in some buildings. They're not a problem. If your bus is a device for horizontal transportation the same way those lifts are for vertical, it's all right. Nevertheless those buses could not go further than allowed walking distance.</p>\n\n\n",

I didn't see clearly myself from the distance, but I saw the colours of the book, and I looked up about the book and have identified which book it was.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/3319047671\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.amazon.com/Israels-Exodus-Transdisciplinary-Perspective-Quantitative/dp/3319047671</a></p>\n\n<p>Israel's Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective: Text, Archaeology, Culture, and Geoscience (Quantitative Methods in the Humanities and Social Sciences) 2015th Edition\nby Thomas E.

Debate about the historicity of the Exodus should be reopened as a result of this fine work.\"</p>\n\n<p>I've heard that one issue archaeologists would have with the exodus is that according to archaeologists, egypt ruled israel at the time, so escaping from egypt to an israel ruled by egypt, wouldn't work. So i'm under no illusions, i'm sure the minimalist archaeologists haven't changed their position overnight into one that the exodus happened. But regarding these paintings, </p>\n\n<p>Are they really egyptian paintings of the exodus?  Are there good reasons to think they're not?</p>\n\n<p>I can't much online about it, though it seems like it should've been a big news story.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Some fair comments on my last answer were added, so I'll try to improve it.</p>\n\n<p>\"Are they really egyptian paintings of the exodus?\" It's possible, I don't know. It's also possible they are not, I also don't know. Here I can't help.</p>\n\n<p>\"Are there good reasons to think they're not?\" Yes, there are good reasons to think they are not. This is what we call a possible event of zero probability, like a sudden burst of smallpox somewhere. Ie, the probability they are genuine ancient egyptian paintings is nearly zero, or even zero. As the asker notes \"it seems like it should've been a big news story\". Well, it hasn't. Why? Were there any good reasons involved?</p>\n\n<p>Why is the probability near zero in this case? Well, ancient Egypt was not a democracy. When the president gets something wrong, everybody writes a book about it. Pharaoh was a god, when the Pharaoh got something wrong, it didn't happen! And let someone dare say it did. Ancient egyptians didn't use to carve many hieroglyphs about their defeats, as any historian can confirm. If ever they did write something about a defeat, they would add much sugar to it.</p>\n\n<p>So, this answers the straight question \"Are they really egyptian paintings of the exodus? Are there good reasons to think they're not?\"</p>\n\n<p>Yet other issues are raised by the asker: \"it should've been a big news story\" and he quotes someone saying \"debate about the historicity of the Exodus should be reopened as a result\"</p>\n\n<p>Why is this such a big thing? Why should such a debate be reopened? Let's suppose for a moment someone just found a Torah scroll in the arabian desert which has been dated by all methods available to Science as from 3200 years ago. This would be big news. Should the debate about the historicity of the Exodus be reopened? First of all, historians would be very amazed by the fact that, besides one or two minor points, it's an exact copy of any other modern Torah scroll, but the chemistry doesn't lie: 3200 years old. And that's it. For historians this 3200 year old Torah scroll is no more a reliable source for confirmation of a historic hypothesis than any modern Torah scroll.</p>\n\n<p>For historians a Torah scroll is a source of hypothesis, but they refuse to rely on it to confirm those hypothesis. Here these jews have this text. Maybe it happened, maybe not. Why should we believe them? Until some irrefutable piece of evidence comes to light, this is just a hypothesis, not a fact.</p>\n\n<p>So these paintings come to light. By what powers are these paintings irrefutable piece of evidence? I saw once a video of president Obama kicking a door open. Maybe some egyptians were just fooling. Maybe that tale about crossing a split sea was a common fairy tale in those days which was written by the hebrews their own way and painted by egyptians their own's. What makes these paintings here more reliable than a Torah scroll?</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone really believes that egyptians monarchs took their time collecting unbiased accounts of events and then ordered painters and carvers to depict the truth as realistic as they could? Or are they egyptian paintings and hieroglyphs just fabulous propaganda?</p>\n\n<p>What's the problem with Torah being a reliable historical source when some ancient obscure propaganda can be such?</p>\n\n<p>For me Torah is a reliable historical source. It's a fact that the jews were in Egypt and left it by crossing a split sea. There's no debate to be reopen. If those paintings are chemically proven to be ancient and egyptian, the better. But they don't prove anything, they're just a good depiction of a known fact. What if those paintings showed people crossing the sea in a baloon? Would it prove that Torah is wrong and jews didn't cross by foot a split sea, or would it rather prove those paintings to be an ancient joke?</p>\n\n<p>If it helps, Moshe was sometime an egyptian monarch, so if some scratches on a wall seemingly ordered by an egyptian monarch are the historical truth, then let's just admit a Torah scroll is also the historical truth.</p>\n\n<p>This here <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3007/jewish/How-Do-We-Know-that-We-Heard-G-d-at-Sinai.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3007/jewish/How-Do-We-Know-that-We-Heard-G-d-at-Sinai.htm</a> also answers much.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Likely he was referring to <a href=\"http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/bookofgates.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Book of Gates</a>, an Egyptian text that was drawn on walls of Egyptian tombs and sarcophagi and features what some interpret to be the story of the splitting of the sea from the Egyptian perspective (the full text can be read <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/gate/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). I'll summarize the explanation given by then-beginner archeologist<sup>1</sup> Ori Yehudah in the site <a href=\"https://rationalbelief.org.il/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%A9-%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%A8-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%AA-%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A3-%D7%91%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rational Belief</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Egyptian story is divided into the 12 hours of the night and matches the time of the Biblical crossing of Yam Suf which occurred also at night. According to Egyptian mythology, Pharaoh arrives at the sea of flames in the fourth hour of the night, and the fire prevents him from reaching the sea. It's possible to parallelize this motif with the Pillar of Fire that came behind the encampment of the Children of Israel and didn't allow Pharaoh's army to come close to them.</p>\n<p>In the fifth hour it tells of the splitting of the sea in two, with there being a convoluted snake in the middle which describes the enemies of Egypt. This parallelizes the splitting of Yam Suf and the passing of the Israelites through it.</p>\n<p>In the tenth hour, in the early morning, the sea returns and drowns the brave soldiers of Pharaoh in it. Also in the Biblical story the soldiers of Pharaoh drown near the end of the night and in the morning the Israelites find their bodies tossed onto the beach. \"and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state\".\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's the picture of the splitting of the sea and the snake:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0sn12.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0sn12.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>As to your other question, one reason to interpret it as not being a reference to the Exodus is because the common interpretation is, as described in the site that brings the content of the book (the first link):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This text, like other netherworld compositions, is concerned with the nocturnal journey of the sun. Compared to the Amduat, the hours are somewhat displaced. For example, in the Book of Gates, the drowned appear in the ninth rather than the tenth hour. Also, because of the grouping of deities and deceased persons, they are more clearly distinguished from each other then in the Amduat, and the dead appear bound to their respective regions in the hours of the night. Here also, the dead king's special status is more clearly defined, as he accompanies the sun god to his rebirth in the morning. In fact, most versions contain additions to the texts and representations that refer directly to the king.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the common understanding is that this is entirely an Egyptian mythical/mystical text that isn't describing any real, historic events.</p>\n<p>Another reason is that an incomplete version of the book was found in the tomb of <a href=\"https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrJ7J4fUclfRJYAPzZXNyoA;_ylu=Y29sbwNiZjEEcG9zAzEEdnRpZAMEc2VjA3Nj/RV=2/RE=1607057823/RO=10/RU=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHoremheb/RK=2/RS=hmjtHw4WJmRgNtiHtAUTsl5Evsg-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horemhab</a>, who, according to most researchers, was pharaoh prior to the time of what is believed to have been when the Exodus occurred, which would make this supposed Exodus story in his tomb an anachronism. <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/gate/gate15.htm#:%7E:text=THE%20BOOK%20OF%20GATES%20CHAPTER%20I.%20THE%20ALABASTER,Sir%20John%20Soane%2C%20at%2013%2C%20Lincoln%27s%20Inn%20Fields.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Another version was imprinted on the sarcophagus</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seti_I\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seti I</a>, father of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramesses II</a>, the latter being who many say was the pharaoh of the Exodus. So, another anachronism.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p>Mostly, it seems this didn't make the news because it was first discovered many years ago and it seems that from the beginning, or almost from the beginning, it was interpreted as merely an ancient mystical, non-historic text.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> This was written four years ago.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Of course, there are explanations for this also, but that's not the subject here...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>You ask \"Are they really egyptian paintings of the exodus? Are there good reasons to think they're not?\" Yes, there are good reasons to think they are not. All that happened to Egypt on account of the jews and the sheer shame of the greatest power of the time being utterly defeated by its slaves, not by deads of war but by deads of G-d, means they erased any proof, documentation, hieroplyphs, paintings, sculptures of the presence of those slaves and of the consequent shame. That was common and Egypt otherwise everywhere. Whenever someone or something falls in disgrace, it is promptly erased. That happened in revolutionary France when all fleur-de-lis where erased from everywhere. One survived in a inconspicuous place of the Paris catacombs. That's why historians maintain there is no proof that jews ever were in Egypt. Yes, there is not, it was destroyed. The only proof of it is the text of the Torah, but somehow that's not enough proof for historians. If ever in Egypt half of an old broken hieroglyph comes up from the sand which talks of the jewish slaves, historians will hail that Science found a proof. They could as well just enter any synagogue and ask to take a look to the Torah scroll, but that for them isn't proof of anything.</p>\n\n\n",

Indeed, the <strong>Mishna</strong> (chapter 22, folio <strong>146b</strong> in Gemara) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If one's garments fall into water on the road, he may walk in them without fear when he reaches the outermost courtyard he may spread them out in the sun, <strong>but not in sight of the people.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Mishna is against Rav because she makes a difference between in sight of the people and  the courtyard. The Gemara reports a Berayta which begins with the statement of the Mishna and ends by the opinion of <strong>Rabbi El'azar and Rabbi Shim'on</strong> in Berayta which is the opinion of Rav above cited.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>On the one hand, it seems that the Gemara ruled as Rav, against the Mishna, which is a minority opinion. This will mean that _If his  garments falls  into water on the road, he may walk in them without fear,  but  when he reaches the outermost courtyard he may <strong>NOT</strong> spread them out in the sun. Indeed, the <strong>Rambam and the Shulchan Aruch</strong> did not follow the mishna, but follow Rav,  Rabbi El'azar and Rabbi Shim'on. Even in the courtyard, one may not spread the garments because of Mar'it Ayin, it seems as he did wash them on Shabbat. </p></li>\n<li><p>But in other places, the Gemara did not stipulate that there is no difference between public or private situation. For instance a similar law is in Chulin, the <strong>Mishna in Chulin</strong> (41a) says that: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>one may not slaughter at all into a pit; yet a person may dig a pit <strong>in his own house</strong> for the blood to run into. <strong>in the street,</strong> however, he should not do so lest he appear to follow the ways of the heretics. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara seems to accept this mishna without mentioning the rule of Rav (which appears to contradict the Mishna). <strong>Tosfot in Chulin 41a</strong> concludes, with a proof from the Yerushalmi (Kilayim 9, halacha 1) that Rav is rejected (the Yerushalmi says that this Mishna also is against Rav,  and here the Bavli accepts it despite this fact). I.e. in Shabbat 64b - 65a, the Gemara rejected the psak of Rav and extablished that Rav was following the opinion of RE and RS in Berayita, which was rejected by Rabbi in the last conclusion of the Mishna. We say in Talmudic jargon that <em>\"Rav was held in Shita\"</em>. We can say also that the suggiot of Chulin and Shabbat 64b are not congruent. So, Tosfot, (following  <strong>Rav Nisim Gaon</strong>  according to the text of Tosfot in Avoda Zara 12a) rejected the Psak of Rav and ruled the two stam Mishnayot (Shabbat 146b and Chulin 41a) according to the Suggia of Chulin. </p></li>\n<li><p>The same Tosfot in Chulin 41a,  in a first explanation (which is congruent with the opionion of Rambam and SA) says that the Mishna of Chulin addresses a different problem of Mar'it Haayn (he thinks that the Bavli in Chulin disagrees with the Yerushalmi). The Bavli thinks, according to Tosfot, that the  symbolic meaning of the same action of blood evacuation is different in his own house than in public place: At home it is obvious that he wants to keep clean his yard. on the street it is very plausible to see him as following the ways of heretics. So this Mishna is consistent with Rav. <strong>The Shulchan Aruch</strong>, following Tur and Rambam ruled the mishna in Chulin despite that they ruled as Rav regarding Mar'it Ayn (against the Yerushalmi's logic).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>In an area where there are no Jews</code>  <strong>-->  YES</strong> </p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>Tosfot Chulin 41a added in the end of the paragraph that even according to  Rav, if the prohibition is not a scriptural sin, it's permitted to make the ambiguous action in a private way. He is followed in this by the <strong>Bet Yosef OC 336</strong>.     </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Are there exceptions</code>  <strong>--> YES for non-scriptural issues</strong>.  There is  one case of non scriptural sin in  Tosfot: To remove blockage from a pipe in the roof (it is derabanan,  mel'acha killeachar yad,  this case is not addressed in Gemara for the issue of Mar'it Haayn); an additional case is to take  a goat to walking on the street with a small bell, even if the bell cannot tinkling because of the Mar'it Haayn as if he is going to sell it in the market. To sell is a prohibition derabanan. The poskim ask a kushia against this principle of Tosfot. The Gemara in Shabbat 64b asks a contradiction between Rav and this din (of bell).  There are many terutsim. (The Magen Avraham's  teruts (as I understand it) is that the suggiot are the Suggia of the Bavli in Chulin is the halacha,  and makes the case of Schita with the blood and the bell as case that are problematic on the street only.

The psak of Rav Nisim Gaon is mainly based on the the multiple places in which those beraytot and mishnayot are reported without report of the rule of Rav.</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n",

A lion is much stronger than a bear. Tosfos answers that really a bear is more brazen and is sly (has tricks) that’s why Persia is considered more important. The Tosfos goes on to quote a gemara in berachos 13a which I don’t undertsand.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know what this means:</p>\n\n<p>\"וי\"ל דאע\"ג דארי מלך מ\"מ דוב הוא עז יותר ובעל תחבולות כדאמר בפרק קמא דברכות (דף יג.) גבי צרות האחרונות משכחות הראשונות הניח מעשה ארי וספר מעשה דוב \"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Our gemara, at Berachos 13a, is discussing the possibility that the future redemption of the Jews will dwarf the long-ago exodus from Egypt. It remarks that if someone were endangered by (and then saved from) first a wolf, then a lion, then a snake, each attack would make previous attacks seem not worth the mention. In other words, during the time between the first attack and the second, the first attack would be an interesting story; but once a later and more remarkable danger had been braved, the earlier and relatively minor danger would not be worth mentioning.</p>\n\n<p>Tosafos at Avodah Zarah 2b is not interested in the actual subject matter of this gemara at Berachos 13a, the redemptions of the Jewish people. He is just pointing out the opinion, which the gemara takes for granted, that the three types of animals are listed from least dangerous to most dangerous. And it appears that Tosafos' version of this gemara in Berachos lists the third animal as bear, not snake, as remarked-upon in the Mesoras Ha Shas at Berachos 13a.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfaos at Avodah Zarah 2b proceeds as follows. Unfortunately I'm not particularly curious about, or capable of, correct voweling of the Hebrew. But here's how I would say it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Veyeish loimar               One could say\nde af al gav de ari melech   that although the lion is a king\nmikol makoim                 nonetheless\ndoiv hu az yoiseir           the bear is stronger\nuba'al tachvulois            and shrewd\nkedeamar beperek kama        as is said in the first chapter\ndeberachois (daf 13)         of Tractate Berachos (page 13)\ngabei tzarois ha-acharoinois concerning later troubles\nmishkachois                  which cause one to forget\nharishoinois                 the earlier ones,\nhaniach                      so that one would omit\nma'aseh ari                  the episode of the lion\nusapeir ma'aseh doiv         and tell of the episode of the bear.\n</code></pre>\n\n\n",

I had heard from someone that Sefer Cheshbon Ha'Nefesh was written by a non-Jew and was brought into the Jewish world by Rav Isaac Sherr.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In Benjamin Franklin's diary (see <a href=\"http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pg 38</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page39.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">39</a>), there is a discussion of making a weekly chart where each row is one of 13 virtues, and each column is a day of the week. That gives you a box for how you performed in that virtue on that day. And you make marks in that box each time you succeed or fail in making the right decision in that virtue.</p>\n\n<p>This is clearly the source of the system for keeping a Cheshbon haNefesh (literally: An Accounting of the Soul) described by Rav Mendel Satanover (Menachem Mendel Lefin) in his sefer by that name.  Although his list of Middos differs from Franklin's Virtues in a few of the items. A second difference is that Cheshbon haNefesh does not treat the list of Middos as canonical -- he suggests alternatives and sketches how to give them similar treatment, depending upon what the individual needs to work on.  (I have a comparison of Franklin's 13 Virtues with the middos in Cheshbon haNefesh as well as the 13 middos the Torah Temimah attributes to Rav Yisrael Salanter in a blog post titled \"<a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/lists-of-middos\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aspaqlaria: Lists of Middos</a>\".)</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yisrael Salanter (Lipkin) was a major supporter of the book Cheshbon haNefesh. (As well as the practice.) He raised funds to have it republished. This, despite the fact that Satanover was a Maskil and a friend or associate of R Moshe Mendelsohn's -- one of the vanguard of observant German Jews who took ideas from the Enlightenment. And who are vilified in many circles of the Orthodox community because history shows us that their was the first step toward Reform Judaism. (Although as a point of history, this clique were themselves fully observant Jews.)</p>\n\n<p>Another oft-quoted example is a short essay in R' Eliyahu E Dessler's Michtav meiEliyahu (edited from notes by R' Aryeh Carmell) -- vol IV pp 243, \"Reviewing One’s Character; the Root of Perfection\", which summarizes a talk R Dessler gave in the Ponovezh Yeshiva in Benei Beraq in September 1949. All of the ideas in the section of the essay listing practical steps one can take are found in Dale Carnegie's \"How to WIn Friends and Influence People. (In fact, all are found in the Reader's Digest version, so R Dessler may have just read that.) For more, see Rabbi Yosel Catane's article, \"Accept the Truth from He Who Speaks It”; Rav Eliyahu Dessler and Dale Carnegie\", Hamaayan 1992 -- or R' Ari Waxman's <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/308100694/Rav-Dessler-and-Dale-Carnegie\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2005 translation on Scribd</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The key to understanding this phenomenon is to realize that Mussar's goal is to ever improve oneself in the image of G-d, to be better capable of doing His work. The tools to getting there, aside from Torah study and mitzvah observance,\nare not the point, nor defining features of the movement. Therefore, they were fully comfortable borrowing ideas from Franklin, Carnegie, Covey, or other self-help \"gurus\" and of course would borrow from the field of psychology. Adapting along the way from psychology's focus on getting rid of the issues that keep one from being who they want to be to a goal of becoming the person Hashem wants us to be.</p>\n\n\n",

[Yalkut Yosef (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 300:4]</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the reason for the more shabbos-like (shir hama'alos & migdol) representation in benching is due to the shabbos-like quality of the meal. Meaning, Rav Berel Wein has a well <a href=\"http://www.rabbiwein.com/blog/melave-malka-664.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">written piece</a> describing \"a meal of departure in honor of the Shabbos queen prepared and eaten in order to allow us to show our love and respect for this most royal of days on the Jewish calendar.\" Essentially, melava malka is the final extension of the shabbos meals before fully entering the rest of the week.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Place to Learn Aramaic Online\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know a bit of Aramaic, but I'd really like to improve my skills. Recently I have been paying more attention to the Aramaic parts of our davening and sections from the Zohar featured in the siddur (Nusach Ari) but that is not enough to learn a language. Is there anywhere online in which I can start studying Hebrew's sister language? </p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://www.learnassyrian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this website</a>, although it teaches <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriac_language\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Syriac-Aramaic</a>, which is different in some subtle ways from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Palestinian_Aramaic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish-Aramaic</a>, including using an entirely different script. (Also, Syriac is primarily used by Christians in the Eastern Lands, so it has little to do with Jews and Judaism, although I am sure there are surely some Jews who speak it.) </p>\n\n<p>Put simply, I want to learn the Aramaic of the Targumim and other Rabbinic literature, so I can study that literature; online sources are preferred. Also, no Christian sources either! I know of a blog or two run by Christians that teach Galilean Aramaic for obvious reasons...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When you refer to the Aramaic of the targumim and rabbinic literature, be aware that you are referring to a number of different languages! Linguists refer to the language of the Yerushalmi, for example, as Palestinian Jewish Aramaic and the language of the Bavli as Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic. Some of the targumim belong to the former group, while some have elements of the latter group in them as well. Note also that the language of the Zohar is different again, so passages that you are looking at in your siddur might deviate grammatically from what you see in, for example, Shas.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, just as you are not looking for Christian sites, you're also not looking for Jewish sites. You want proper, academic sites that don't support claims with reference to midrash or hagiography. Your intention, if I am not misunderstanding you, is to learn Aramaic in order to improve your grasp of texts that are written in that language. Lots of universities around the world offer courses in various Aramaic dialects, and some of those universities will offer classes online. None of them will be free.</p>\n\n<p>I hate to say it, but I think that your best bet is printed material, not online courses, and I think that the way you were going about it originally was very good. Start with texts that you want to be able to read, have an English translation with you while you are reading them, and consult a dictionary. English translations of all of these texts exist online, if that's your preference.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, work slowly (or at your own pace) through an introductory grammar, of which there are several. You can find some suggestions in the answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/55988/recommendation-for-beginners-aramaic-language-book\">this question</a> (one of which is by me).</p>\n\n<p><strong>By the way</strong>: while Hebrew and Aramaic are related, their relationship is not quite that of \"sister languages\". It's similar in some ways to the relationship between English and French: in other words, they belong to the same language family, but to two different classes within that family. English is Germanic and French is Romance. Similarly, Hebrew belongs to the Canaanite group, which is distinct from the Aramaic group of Semitic languages. See <a href=\"https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/semitic-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32MRo_uBgy8&list=PL96Ibcw54SqkQ5ut0gRW45Pi9YR7SH3xQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This video series</a> proved to be helpful in my studies of basic Judeo-Aramaic grammar. Although the purpose of these videos is to teach the language in regards to the Talmud Yerushalmi, they were still incredibly helpful in learning the basics to learn the Bavli as well.</p>\n\n<p>(Even though I've added an answer to my own question, I'm still leaving <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/79674/11486\">the answer by Shimon bM</a> marked as the \"correct\" one.

What the gemara is saying here (and  I assume you understand) is that Rav Yosef has given a different reason for a basically identical decree, so you should be able to understand why those challenges and answers apply just as well to Rav Yosef's theory (because Rav Yosef and Rabbah are proposing basically the same decree just for different reasons).</p>\n\n\n",

The first time, he is called \"the son of Yishai.\" Later on, he is referred to as \"the man descended from Peretz.\" We know that the piyut's author, Rav Alkabetz, was an important mekubal and that the Arizal was very impressed with this piyut. Given the kabbalistic provenance of the song, one can assume that there is a deeper meaning behind the specific phrasing used.

One of them is that the regular weekdays are compared to the time of exile (עולם הזה) and Shabbat to the time of the coming of Moshiach and the final redemption (ימות המשיח ועולם הבא).</p>\n\n<p>This is alluded to in the repeating verse, Lecha <em>Dodi</em> (לכה דודי), <em>Come out My beloved</em>. That <em>Dodi</em> (<strong>דודי</strong>) is referring to the final stage of Moshiach ben David (משיח בן <strong>דויד</strong>), also called <em>Melech HaMoshiach</em>, which is the culmination of the final redemption (גאולה שלימה). This is in contrast to Moshiach ben David without the addition of the letter 'Yud' (משיח בן דוד) which refers to an earlier stage in the redemption.</p>\n\n<p>This is discussed by <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%91_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Vilna Gaon in Kol HaTor, 2:2</a> and the concept of the union of Moshiach ben Yosef and Moshiach ben David (משיח בן יוסף משיח בן דויד גמטריא אלף).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>לפעמים</strong> <strong>מתחלקים תפקידיהם של ב׳ המשיחין</strong> הן בדרגות והן בהשפעות תלוי לפי הבחינה אם בבחינת לאה ורחל, היינו דעת ומלכות הרי מב״ד הוא המשפיע את השפע העליון ומב״י הוא המקבל ומוציא לפועל בבחינת יהודה שהציל את יוסף, ואם בבחינת יוסף ויהודה היינו יסוד ומלכות, הרי מב״י הוא המשפיע ומב״ד הוא המקבל. <strong>וכל זאת באתחלתא דגאולה בזמן שעץ יוסף ועץ יהודה הם ״אחדים בידך״, כשהם עדיין כתרי פלגא גופא</strong> בדרגת אתערותא דלתתא, <strong>אבל בשלמות הגאולה שאז יהיו שני העצים לאחד בידי, ביד ה׳, אז יהיו גם הם כתרין ריעין דלא מתפרשין והיו שניהם לאחד, למלך המשיח</strong> שהוא בדרגת רעיא מהימנא של הגואל האחרון שהוא משה רבנו ע״ה, <strong>בדרגת האלף הגדול והיה ה׳ למלך על כל הארץ וכו׳, (וכן בחושבנא ״משיח בן יוסף משיח בן דויד״ עולה למספר אלף).</strong> ובעמדנו על סף האתחלתא עלינו ללמוד ולדעת את כל הבחינות והתפקידים של ב׳ המשיחין, משיחין תתאין, בדרכי האתחלתא בסע״ד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It also follows the haftorah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14256&st=&pgnum=323\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 37:19</a> which is based upon parshat VaYigash, Bereshit 44:18) discussing the joining together of the <em>branch of Yosef</em> and the <em>branch of Yehudah</em> to become one.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Lubavitcher Rebbe of our generation, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Scheersohn, this appears to be why Rambam in Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Melachim, chapters 11 and 12 does not mention Moshiach ben Yosef at all. The Rebbe explains in Torato shel Moshiach, Chapter 11, pg 67 that even though Moshiach ben Yosef is mentioned throughout the Talmud, midrash and Prophets, Rambam is completely silent about him when discussing Moshiach in halacha. The Rebbe says this suggests that Rambam is of the view that Moshiach ben Yosef and Moshiach ben David are the same individual at different stages of the redemption.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אף דמדמפטיריו בשבת חוהמ׳ס ביום בוא גוג (מגילה לא:א) מפני  דבתשרי תהי׳ מלחמת גוג (טוש׳ע א׳ח ס׳ תט) משמע לכאורה דס׳ל דבתשרי נגאלין י״ל <strong>דהיינו דוקא מלחמת גוג שהיא תחלת ימוה״מ</strong> כדמוכח׳ קרא׳ וכדאיתא ברמב״ם הלכות מלכים (פרק יב:ב). אבל הגאולה תהי׳ בניסן <strong>וצ״ע אם הגאולה  היא לפני מלחמת גוג או לאחרי׳</strong> ועיין סנהדרין (צז:ב) מהן מלחמת גו״מ והשאר ימוה״מ ופירש״י <strong>שכלה השעבוד ומשיח בא.</strong> אבל בעבודה זרה (ג:ב) משמע להיפך דאיתא שם: <strong>אין מקבלין גרים לימוה״מ כו״ אלא שנעשו גרים גרורים כיון  שראוין  מלחמת גו״מ כו״.</strong> ועיין ג״כ ויקרא רבה (פ׳ל פ׳ה) <strong>דימוה״מ קודמים למלחמת גו״מ.</strong> ולכאורה י״ל <strong>דהגאולה מהחלה שקודם למלחמת גו״מ אבל אין הגאולה שלימה אלא אחרי מפלה גו״מ</strong> - ועיין ג״כ רש״י ד״ה אתחלתא (מגילה יז:ב)  ומ״ש רש״י (סנהדרין צז:ב) ומשיח בא - <strong>היינו משיח בן דוד הבא לאחר התחלת גו״מ כדמשמע בסוכה (נב:א)</strong>. <strong>משא״כ משיח בן יוסף</strong> הנלחם עם גו״מ, <strong>שבו מתחיל כללות ימוה״מ והוא קודם לגו״מ</strong>. ועיין ג״כ יחזקאל (לח-לט) וזכרי׳ (יב-יד). <strong>וצ״ע שברמב״ם סוף הלכות מלכים השמיט לגמרי ענין משיח בן יוסף, ומשמע מלשונו שם דהכל נעשה ע״י משיח בן דוד.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the points to note about this is that the individual who actually transitions from the time of exile to the days of Moshiach is the single person mentioned by Rambam in Hilchot Melachim chapters 11 and 12 who will embody both roles of Moshiach ben Yosef and Moshiach ben David. The branch of Yehudah and the branch of Yosef will become one in <em>My hand</em>. </p>\n\n<p>All those <em>potential Moshiachs</em> from previous generations who did not make the transition from the days of exile to the days of Moshiach remain in the valid and legitimate status of <em>Moshiach ben Yosef</em>. Or in the words of Rambam, they are \"like all the perfect and fit kings from the house of David who have died.\"</p>\n\n<p>And this leads to the posuk referring to <em>Ben David.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>התנערי מעפר קומי, לבשי בגדי תפארתך עמי, על יד בן ישי בית הלחמי, קרבה אל נפשי גאלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ben Yishai, meaning David ben Yishai (<strong>דוד</strong> בן ישי, That <strong>יד</strong> is gematria <strong>דוד</strong>.), refers to Moshiach ben David (משיח בן <strong>דוד</strong>), like is found in the commentary of the <em>Maharid</em>, Rabbi Yitzchok DovBer of Liadi in volume 2 of Siddur HaTefillah al-pi Nusach HaAri z\"l explaining Lecha Dodi. In this stage of the redemption Moshiach ben David is destined to be resurrected as one of the seven shepherds and eight anointed individuals who are the first to be resurrected: David HaMelech, Adam, Seth ben Adam, Metushelach, Avraham Avinu, Yaacov Avinu, Moshe Rabbeinu, Yishai, Shaul HaMelech, Shmuel HaNavi, Amos HaNavi, Tzephaniah HaNavi, Tzidikyahu HaMelech, and Eliyahu HaNavi like is found in Sukkot 52b. That is the reference to <em>'awaken and arise from the dust'</em> (התנערי מעפר קומי), like from the expression <em>Arise and sing you sleepers in the dust</em> (קיצו ורננו שוכני עפר) from Isaiah 26:19.</p>\n\n<p>It also follows the explanation of Rabbeinu Bechaye to Bereshit 1:3.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ויאמר אלהים יהי אור.</strong> ירמוז על ימות המשיח שהזכיר בו הכתוב (ישעיה ס:א) קומי אורי כי בא אורך וכבוד ה' עליך זרח.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>And G-d said, Let there be light</em></strong> alludes to the <em>Days of Moshiach</em> which are recalled in the text of Isaiah 60:1, \"Arise my light because Your light has come, and the <em>glory of the L-rd is upon you</em> is Zerach.\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, because <em>Your light</em> has come, my light rises. The posuk goes on to associate this aspect of <em>my light</em> with <em>Zerach</em> (זרח). It is discussing the concept that the aspect of <em>Zerach</em> only arises as a consequence of <em>Your light</em>, meaning the light of Moshiach ben Yosef having already come.</p>\n\n<p>And this leads to the next line of the poem which actually cites the posuk from Isaiah brought by Rabbeinu Bechaye.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>התעוררי התעוררי, כי בא אורך קומי אורי, עורי עורי שיר דברי, כבוד הוי׳ עליך נגלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You have surely caused me to be aroused, because your light has come my light arises, I am surely aroused, a song leads me, 'the glory of the L-rd is upon you' is revealed.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>light of Moshiach ben Yosef</em> is referring to the culmination of his life's purpose which is called <em>the elevation of the sparks of holiness</em>. These sparks fell at the beginning of creation through the shattering of the vessels as described by the Ari z\"l and many others. As the Ari teaches, this is the ingathering of the exiles (קבוץ גליות) mentioned in the Amidah prayer. Unlike the final, literal ingathering of the exiles mentioned in Tehillim and in halacha, the ingathering mentioned in the Amidah prayer precedes the re-establishment of the Sanhedrin and the rebuilding of the Temple. This follows the teachings of the Alter Rebbe who follows the teachings of the Ari as found in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31622&st=&pgnum=360\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igrot Kodesh of Rabbi Shalom Dov Ber Shneersohn, volume 1, letter 130</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם בדבר אשר אחד יצא מקהל עדתם והראה <strong>ענין קיבוץ גליות המבואר בסידור רבינו נ״ע</strong> ע״פ תהלתו בקהל חסידים, הלא כל רואה יראה <strong>שזהו בגמר הבירורים וכמ״ש שם וז״ל אך הנה ענין קיבוץ גליות היינו לאחר שיושלם בחי׳ הבירור כו׳ וכן כתב אח״כ אחר שכבר עשו ותקנו מה שביכולתם לתקן כו׳.</strong> ובכתבים נמצא ג״כ ע״פ הנ׳׳ל ושם נא׳ מפורש וז״ל <strong>אך לע״ל בגמר ותכלית כל הברורין שיתקבצו כל האורות דתהו שנתפזרו בבחי׳ קיבוץ והתכללות באחד אז גם החסדים שנתפזרו בשבילם יתקבצו ויתאספו בבחי׳ קיבוץ להתעלות למקורן אחד חפשוט, עכ״ל. וענין קיבוץ גליות ברוחניות הוא אסיפת וקיבוץ נצוצי החסדים וגם אסיפת וקיבוץ נצוצי הגבורות הן הניצוצות דתוהו הנבררים ע״י ניצוצי החסדים ונכללים בהם וכמש׳׳ש בסידור</strong> בענין והטבך וחרבך מאבותיך כו׳. <strong>ועמש״ש ע״פ נדחי ישראל יכנס דשרש ענין קיבוץ גליות הוא בירור ועליות נצוצות דתוהו, והיינו דנש״י לפי שהן בבחי׳ החסדים דשם מ״ה וירדו תתלבשו בלבושי נוגה ולזאת בעבודתם ופעולתם המה מבררים את הנצוצות דתהו שנפלו בק״נ, ולעתיד בגמר הברורים יתאספו ויתקבצו נצוצי חחסדים והגבורות ויתעלו בבחי׳ אחד פשוט. ובפע״ח בכוונת ברכת קיבוץ גליות דהיינו ברכת תקע בשופר כ׳ שהו״ע בירור ועליות הנצוצות כו׳ ושם לכוין בשם היוצא מפסוק חיל בלע ויקאנו דהיינו הוצאות-הנצוצות מהם שיתעלו אל\n  הקדושה וזחו״ע קיבוץ גליות )ומ״ש שם בפע׳׳ח עוד בענין חנ״ל</strong> עמ׳׳ש בסידור ע״פ עושה משפט לעשוקים(.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This elevation of the sparks of holiness is accomplished via the passing away of Moshiach ben Yosef and his soul ascending to its source. This is called <em>histalkut</em> (הסתלקות). The sparks cleave to his soul and ascend with him. In so doing, Moshiach ben Yosef completes the tikkun that all the Jewish people through all the generations have accomplished through the performance of the mitzvot. This is also alluded to by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in his sefer, <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%9A_%D7%94%27_%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99_%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech HaShem, section 2:3:8</a>, which discusses the single individual who is so refined that he causes not only the tikkun of himself and his generation but also all the generations which preceded him.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמנם כיון <strong>שהם בעצמם שלימים וראוים לטוב</strong> שהם מתיסרין רק בעבור האחרים ודאי שתתפיס מדת הדין במועט בהם כבמרובה בחוטאים עצמם. ולא עוד אלא שעל ידי זה זכותם נוסף וכחם מתחזק וכל שכן שיכולים לתקן את אשר עיותו האחרים. <strong>והיינו כי לא די שיתקנו למה שבבני דורם אלא גם לענין כל מה שנתקלקל העולם מאז נהיו בו חטאים ועד עתה.</strong> ובודאי <strong>שאלה יהיו אחר כך בקיבוץ השלימים ראשי הראשים והיותר קרובים אליו ית</strong>':</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The next two posukim in the poem are discussing the period from the histalkut of Moshiach ben Yosef until the appearance of Moshiach ben David, meaning until his resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>לא תבושי ולא תכלמי, מה תשתוחחי ומה תהמי, בך יחסו עניי עמי, ונבנתה העיר על תלה: והיו למשיסה שאסיך, ורחקו כל מבלעיך, ישיש עליך אלהיך, כמשוש חתן על כלה:</p>\n\n<p>It discusses how those who remain after Moshiach ben Yosef have passed away will be tested greatly in their faith and even harassed by those around them. It is a plea that they not be included among those who are embarrassed about the redemption because of the judgement that has befallen Moshiach ben Yosef. This is based upon the Torah teachings found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21524&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Avkat Rochel by Rabbeinu Makir ben Abba Mori, book one, part one, sign seven</a>, about the coming of Moshiach and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וכל מי שלבו מסופק בדינו</strong> חוזר על אומות\n  העולם ואומרים זו הגאולה שאנו מחכים לה שהמשיח נהרג. <strong>וכל מי שאינו \n  מצפה לגאולה מתבייש ממנה</strong> וחוזר על אומות העולם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ninth line of the poem is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ימין ושמאל תפרוצי, ואת הוי׳ תעריצי, על יד איש בן פרצי, ונשמחה ונגילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The (aspect of) right and left will be broken through, and I, Ish ben Partzi, will praise the L-rd, and be happy and rejoice.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>elevation of the sparks</em> has two aspects to it, one associated with Chesed (חסד, kindness) which is associated with the right and one which is associated with gevurah (גבורה, severity) which is associated with the left. </p>\n\n<p>Ben Partzi is referring to Moshiach ben Yosef who breaks through  from the time of exile to the time called 'the days of Moshiach' which is the end of exile and the beginning of the final redemption as mentioned in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9758&st=&pgnum=122\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Isaiah 499</a>. Peretz is the root of Ufaratzta, ופרצת, and is an expression of breaking through and crossing over. This concept of Peretz and Zerach follows the explanation of <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=504\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban to Bereshit 38:29</a> discussing the concepts of the twin brothers, Peretz and Zerach.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וענין פרץ בכל מקום נתיצת הגדר ועברו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"The concept of Peretz in all places is <em>breaking through</em> and <em>crossing over</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>Zerach, whose hand hand emerged before Peretz but withdrew, is compared to the sun. Because his hand emerged first, Zerach is the bachor and is equated with Moshiach ben David. Peretz who was born first, meaning he was the first to emerge from the womb completely, is compared to the moon and establishes the paradigm of Moshiach ben Yosef. This is because the light of the moon is secondary to the light of the sun. The moons light appears and then disappears while the light of the sun is constant.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem reasonable according to this that since Zerach is the firstborn, meaning the bachor who takes precedence over Peretz, that Moshiach ben David should come first. But Peretz, meaning Moshiach ben Yosef, preceding Moshiach ben David actually is a consequence of the blessing of Yaacov Avinu to the children of Yosef HaTzaddik, namely Ephraim and Menashe like is found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=624\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit, parshat Vayechi, 48:8-22</a>. This is discussed in Midrash Tanchuma, parshat Naso, siman 29.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יאמר אדם איני מקיים מצות זקנים הואיל ואינן מן התורה, אמר להם הקב\"ה בני אין אתם רשאין לומר כך אלא כל מה שגוזרים עליכם תהיו מקיימין שנא' (דברים י) ועשית על פי התורה אשר יורוך, למה שאף על דבריהם אני מסכים שנאמר (איוב כב) ותגזר אומר ויקם לך, תדע לך שהרי יעקב בשעה שברך מנשה ואפרים מה כתיב שם (בראשית מח) <strong>וישם את אפרים לפני מנשה, עשה הקטן קודם לגדול, וקיים הקב\"ה גזרתו</strong>, אימתי בקרבנות הנשיאים שהקריב שבט אפרים תחלה שנא' ביום השביעי נשיא לבני אפרים ואח\"כ מנשה מנין ממה שקראו בעניין ביום השמיני נשיא לבני מנשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That the blessing of Yaacov Avinu changed the natural order so that the younger, meaning in context Peretz, Moshiach ben Yosef who is associated with Ephraim, would precede the Bachor, Zerach, meaning Moshiach ben David who is associated with Menashe. And this also is emphasized in the Yalkut Shimoni cited above where Moshiach is referred to as <em>Ephraim, My righteous Moshiach</em> (אפרים משיח צדקי).</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that the Midrash Tanchuma goes on to ask, \"When does this change in precedence apply?\" It says this applies when they make the dedication of the Mishkan and bring their offerings. Ephraim precedes Menashe and brings his offering on Shabbat. Menashe brings his offering on the eighth day. Not only is this a change in the precedence of Bachor to second born. A korban brought by an individual (קרבן יחיד אינו דוחה את השבת) is normally not permitted on Shabbat. This emphasizes the special connection of Peretz, meaning Ephraim, My righteous Moshiach, Moshiach ben Yosef to ending the time of exile and bringing in Shabbat. And all of this is in connection with establishing the Temple and bringing the korbanot because as the Sages say, \"The Mishkan is the Mikdash and the Mikdash is the Mishkan.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is the same blessing that all Jews traditionally make on their children erev Shabbat, that they should be like Ephraim and Menashe. It is to emphasize our prayer for Chiddush HaOlam which comes through Ephraim like is explained by <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/3022\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Dovid Dov Lebanon</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It could also be thought that this blessing from Yaacov is only about children, but the explicit text in the posuk which follows this blessing explains what Yaacov Avinu was referring to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=632\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bereshit, 49:1)</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּקְרָ֥א יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶל־בָּנָ֑יו וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הֵאָֽסְפוּ֙ וְאַגִּ֣ידָה לָכֶ֔ם אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר־יִקְרָ֥א אֶתְכֶ֖ם בְּאַחֲרִ֥ית הַיָּמִֽים׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also the view of the Ari z\"l as cited above in the letter ofRabbi Shalom Dov Ber Schneersohn quoting Sefer Pri Etz Chaim and Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in his Ma'amar HaGeulah.</p>\n\n<p>Two excellent sources for commentaries to Lecha Dodi are <a href=\"http://store.kehotonline.com/prodinfo.asp?number=HP-SM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur HaTefillah al-pi Nusach HaAri z\"l with the commentary of the Maharid</a> and the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6755&st=&pgnum=252\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Kol Yaacov</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Joshua of Sakinin, when God sought to create Eve, He pondered from where to create her...He said, I will not create her from the head, so that she not erect her head [i.e., rebel], not from the eye, so that she not have haughty eyes, not from the ear, so that she not be overly obedient, not from the mouth, so that she not be overly loquacious, not from the hand, so that she not steal...From where shall I create her, from the rib, the most modest of man's limbs...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, it seems that the more direct source for this interpretation is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abravanel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a>'s commentary, cited by <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/tzarich_iyun_adams_rib/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

An apparently-typical statement from the movement would be the following (from <a href=\"http://www.noachide.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Jewish teaching, the Torah of Moses contains a covenant\n  (given at Mt Sinai) binding on the Jewish people consisting of 613\n  commandments, and another known as the ‘Covenant of Noah’ consisting\n  of seven commandments which is binding on all the peoples of the world\n  who are not Jewish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-modern-noahide-movement/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more information on the movement. (It seems that the Rambam was of the opinion that Jews were obligated to try to encourage gentiles to follow the Noahide laws; this was very much a minority opinion among the sages but the contemporary Chasidic movement seems fairly well-disposed to Noahidism.)</p>\n\n<p>My question is the following. When spreading awareness of the Noahide laws amongst B'nei Noach, one might think it should be equally important to spread knowledge of Bris Milah amongst B'nei Abraham who are not B'nei Yisrael. This doesn't seem to be a focus of the Noahide movement, and I presume there is a good reason for this---what is it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As explained in <a href=\"https://www.torahweb.org/torah/2011/parsha/rsac_lech.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Meaning and Significance of Zera Avraham</a> we can see the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemarah itself expresses this distinction as well. In Meseches\n  Sanhedrin (59b), the Gemarah derives that the mitzvah of bris milah\n  applies only to the descendants of Yitzchak, but not to the\n  descendants of Yishmael, from the possuk: \"Va'ata es brisi tishmor,\n  v'zar'acha acharecha l'dorosum - and as for you, you shall keep my\n  covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their\n  generations\" (Bereshis 17:9). The Gemarah reasons that bnei Yishmael\n  could not possibly be included in this commandment, because the term\n  \"zera\" refers specifically to the descendants of Yitzchak, as the\n  Torah states, \"Ki b'Yitzchak yikarei l'cha zerah - since through\n  Yitzchak will offspring be considered yours\" (Bereishis 221:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/66893/was-esau-commanded-in-circumcision\">Was Esau commanded in circumcision?</a> In which one answer states that Eisav was not circumcised at eight days and absolutely refused to do so when he became older. There are others who say that while he may have been circumcised at eight days, he refused to circumcise his children and they were seperated so that only Yaakov continued the line.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the descendants of Eisav dropped bris milah in the generation of Eisav's children. </p>\n\n<p>The descendants of Yishmael still keep bris milah as a result of their conversion to Islam. However, there is no way of telling which groups among them are currently Bnai Avraham. We should also note that the children of Avraham and Keturah apparently never took on bris milah because it was restricted to zerah Avraham and only Yitzchak is called zerah Avraham. Yishmael had bris milah only because he was born before Yitzchak and he was part of the household of Avraham at that time.</p>\n\n<p>While we might say that <strong>originally</strong>, the descendants of Eisav, Yishmael, and Keturah might have been subject to the requirement of bris milah (only from the original commandment in Lech L'cha) we cannot identify any of them nowadays. Since they would have been intermarried with all the nations around them, their identity has been totally lost. The connection of Eisav with the Romans is on a hashkafic level only as is the connection of the Arabs (or Muslims) and Yishmael.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Significance of reciting Baruch Shem out loud during the Shema\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During Shaharith and Ma'ariv prayer we recite the phrase Baruch Shem immediately after reciting the Shema:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם כְּבוֹד מַלְכוּתוֹ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, unlike the Shema, which has the distinction of being one of the few verses recited out loud, Baruch Shem must be recited in an undertone.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that the authorities in ancient Babylon heard Baruch Shem being recited in a synagogue and interpreted this to be a breach of allegiance to the king.  This then resulted in hostility towards the Jewish community, prompting the Rabbis to prohibit reciting Baruch Shem out loud, except on Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forwarding to the present time, I have heard ba'al batim, including a Rabbi, reciting Baruch Shem semi-audibly in various Chabad shuls.  My actual question is what is the reason for certain Chabad people reciting Baruch Shem out loud, or partially out loud?  I could speculate that since some of them believe that we are already living in Messianic times, therefore the prohibition against saying Baruch Shem out loud is no longer valid.  But this is just a guess, not founded in anything solid.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You are asking about midrachim reported regarding the special halachic status of BSKMLV and additionally you are asking about people who are reciting it in an audible way everyday. </p>\n\n<h3>First, the midrashim</h3>\n\n<p><code>I seem to recall reading somewhere that the authorities in ancient Babylon heard Baruch Shem being recited in a synagogue and interpreted this to be an breach of alligience to the king. This then resulted in hostility towards the Jewish community, prompting the Rabbis to prohibit reciting Baruch Shem out loud, except on Yom Kippur.</code> I don't know this, anyway in halacha, based on Gemara this is not the reason.</p>\n\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim siman 61,  13,  Mishna Berura sk 30 which quotes the Gemara Pesachim 56a. I will quote a more extended stuff. :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And what is the reason that we do recite it? - Even as Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish expounded.    For Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish said: And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you [that which shall befall you in the end of days]. \n  Jacob wished to reveal to his sons the 'end of the days', whereupon the Shechinah departed from him.\n  Said he, 'Perhaps, Heaven forfend! there is one unfit among my children, like Abraham, from whom there issued Ishmael, or like my father Isaac, from whom there issued Esau.'\n  [But] his sons answered him, 'Hear O Israel, the Lord our God the Lord is One: just as there is only One in thy heart, so is there in our heart only One.'\n  In that moment our father Jacob opened [his mouth] and exclaimed, 'Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.'\n  <strong>Said the Rabbis, How shall we act?\n  Shall we recite it, - but our Teacher Moses did not say it.\n  Shall we not say it - but Jacob said it! [Hence] they enacted that it should be recited quietly(¹).</strong>\n  Rabbi Isaac said, The School of Rabbi Ammi said: This is to be compared to a king's daughter who smelled a spicy pudding (Rashi,  meat spiced).\n  If she reveals [her desire], she suffers disgrace; if she does not reveal it, she suffers pain.\n  <strong>So her servants began bringing it to her in secret.</strong>\n  Rabbi Abbahu(²)  said: They [the Sages] enacted that this should be recited aloud, on account of the resentment of heretics (who did not say BSKMLV).\n  But in Nehardea, where there are no heretics so far, they recite it quietly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(¹) This is a compromise as you say <code>partially out loud</code>, seems not linked to  Chabbad.  <code>I could speculate that since some of them believe that we are already living in Messianic times, therefore the prohibition against saying Baruch Shem out loud is no longer valid.</code> I think that this speculation is not right. </p>\n\n<p>(²) There was a period in which it was important to inform people about the importance to say it. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>For Yom Kippur</strong> see SA OC 619, 2, Magen Avraham  sk 8. \nHe says that all the year,  we say BSKMLV silently because Moshe did steal it from angels,  and in Yom Kippur we are ourselves as angels,  so it's our,  we need no more hide it.  The source of this explanation is in Tur in name of the Midrash Rabba on Psrashat  Vaetchanan. The Midrash says that Moshe heard this praise of G-d by  angels in heaven and taught it to Israel.  An allegory is: Someone did steal a jewel in the king's palace,  and gave it to his wife.  He said her to wear it at home only. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Note:</strong>  The two explanations, the first regarding everyday and the second regarding Yom Kippurim seem to be contradictory,  but both are reported by poskim.  Their respective meanings are perhaps not contradictory at all,  but I am not able to understand this now.</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>secondly</h3>\n\n<p>the fact that we say BSKMLV quietly does not mean that it needs to be inaudible as noted @Yaakov Deane. The Mishna says that the reader needs to be heard by his ears. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Would an observant Jew be able to fulfill the obligations of serving an office of government?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question may seem strange but it more ties into the nature of politics in non-Jewish parts of the world. Obviously, in a country like Israel we have built around these issues as to prevent conflict. The problem comes when we talk about parts of the world with less respect for observance.</p>\n\n<p>Being an observant Jew requires individuals to put aside certain life obligations for the sake of honoring one's faith.</p>\n\n<p>My question is can an individual who is observant truly honor the needs of an office in a country which doesn't respect certain observances?</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<p>An highly observant Jew succeeds in winning a seat in a level of office (any office can serve as an example but lets for this example say they became a Senator. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A senator needs to be continuous contact with members of their state and electorate. This can occur at all hours of the day and will likely occur during Friday and Saturday when shabbos is ongoing. </p></li>\n<li><p>Congress may hold a late night vote on a Friday due to a coming deadline regarding political matters. This would require a Jew working through Shabbos. </p></li>\n<li><p>The same could be said for a Senator/Congressman who sits on a committee which is meeting late on Friday or on Saturday.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So my question is, can an individual who wishes to live a devout life truly meet the requirements of their elected office? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You've asked a great question, and there has been quite a bit of debate on this/ I'll try to pose some ideas in segments, based on my time and what others may add...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9712&st=&pgnum=31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot 1:10</a> cites Avtalyon who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שנא את הרבנות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There have been several interpretations of this phrase but one of them, cited by Rabbeinu Bechaye, in the link that I have shown interprets this that one should shy away from a leadership position unless someone specifically imposes it upon them. Thus, at least in U.S., many governmental positions are by election, so no one is ever forced to be a candidate. There may be a different situation if the president \"coaxes\" you into a cabinet position, but, even that can be refused. (I state MAY be different, because I'm uncertain of the parameters of what \"imposed upon\" includes within Rav Bechaye's definition.)</p>\n\n<p>Rav Bechaye cites contrasts that Moses repeatedly refused being a leader until G-d forced it upon him. Similar idea with Shaul Hamelech (King Saul) who hid among the baggage because he didn't want to be king.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, he says that those who voluntary accept leadership end up dying before their time, as we see that Joseph was the first to die among his brothers.</p>\n\n<p>There is a separate problem of accepting government positions in that, as you mentioned, it frequently does conflict with one's Jewish moral principals, as you are now a servant of the public. Pirkei Avot does mention this aspect as well. I will edit that in, when I locate it.</p>\n\n<p>When Senator Joseph Lieberman ran as vice president during Al Gore's campaign, we saw some of these very aspects occurring. See <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=121120&page=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> for the full story. His rabbi stated that one is allowed to violate the Shabbat for the sake of the public \"good\". I'm not trying to debate the rabbi's validity on that statement. However, it does preclude the notion that one, perhaps, shouldn't intentionally enter a situation where he has to have this type of debate in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>One other general rule, is that one should avoid situations where he will most likely be forced to violate <em>halachot</em>, assuming that he has a choice. One of my friends was deciding if he should become a surgeon or an accountant (I know - it's a strange choice!) His rav told him that unless he has a tremendous urge or desire to become a surgeon or there is a specific communal need for his expertise, he should become an accountant, because a surgeon is likely to be called on emergency on Shabbat and he may have to drive to the hospital. Of course, he is allowed to do that, but, the rav was pointing out that one shouldn't voluntary enter such a situation if he can avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, one should probably avoid entering a situation where he may have to compromise his Shabbat observance, or other halachic conflicts. Although, as I mentioned in my comments, I can't see any situation other than U.S. president where someone would need to violate Shabbat for any reason other than a natural disaster decision or impending war, etc.</p>\n\n<p>There are other conflicts, probably, which I will try to add later.</p>\n\n\n",

But Shabbat and numerous other mitzvot are certainly important in terms of \"unity\" and nation identification.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I found the explanation in the commentary in the Hirsch Chumash <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9873#v=2&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 12:2</a> translated to English by his grandson Rabbi Levy.  I got it many years ago but you should find new editions via google such as <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/tanach-bible/chumash/the-hirsch-chumash.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Feldheim Publishers</a></p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch goes into a very lengthy explanation of the meaning of this mitzvah and why it is the first mitzvah received <strong>as a nation</strong> and what it means for the nation. Since it is so long, I will be able to give only a few exerpts that summarize this meaning.</p>\n\n<p>First, Hashem wants to ensure that Bnai Yisrael do not fall prey to the error which caused Par'o to fall.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He began the construction of the inner life of His people by the\n  institution of an אות This regular, periodically recurring sign wa\n  always to draw the looks and the thoughts of the people afresh up to\n  Him. It was to summon them to ever fresh rejuvenation out of the\n  darkness of error and depravity and so to ensure a constant rebirth to\n  truth and purity that would forever protect Israel from Egyptian\n  spiritual and moral insensibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was similar to the covenant of the rainbow after the flood, establishing the meaning.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch then points out that the Bnai Yisrael knew the astronomical cycles, but the requirement to actually see the new moon for Rosh Chodesh to occur had a deeper meaning. In fact, this requirement in and of itself proves that they already knew when it would occur, especially since many months could not be seen as during the rainy season.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a matter of fact, the תורה שבעל פה (Rosh Hashana 23, 24, 25) tells\n  us that calculation was at the base of the fixation of the moment of\n  the possibility of the new moon being visible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is the <em>subjective taking note</em> that is the significant part of the ceremony and it is to be לכם that the Bnai Yisrael are to establish the calendar and recognize their position in the world as Hashem has commanded.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just as it, bound by physical laws, rejuvenates itself, so are you, but\n  of your own free will, to create your own rejuvenations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is why the laws of Rosh Chodesh are the start of the mitzvot <strong>as a community</strong>. Unlike the heathen who cannot recognize the freedom that Hashem has granted man, we see that Hashem has set up the universe so that we can progress and renew ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>A further reference points to Rav Soloveitchik's explanation (Gesher 1960) of this mitzvah (Search for Chizuk and Idud on page 27 of <a href=\"http://www.ttidbits.com/1216/1216xl.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshas Bo 5777 Torah Tidbits</a></p>\n\n<p>The basic idea is that an eved cannot have any control of time. As a result, the first mitzvah of bnei Yisrael on becoming free is the control of time. Indeed that is why we have the bracha in musaf of Yom Tov that falls on Shabbos (as an example)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מקדש השבת ישראל והזמנים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shabbat is determined by Hashem and occurs every seven days. However, the Moadim are determined by the declaration of Bais Din when Rosh Chodesh is announced. Thus, the moadim are mekudash because of the sanctification of Bnei Yisrael.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why  indeed  was  Kiddush haChodesh  chosen  to  be  given  first,\n  before  all  of  the  other  mitzvot?  What unique  quality  is  to \n  be  found  in  this mitzva?</p>\n  \n  <p>We  might  ask:  What  does  redemption from slavery have to do with\n  the blessing of the new month? Rav J.B. Soloveitchik zt”l (Gesher June\n  '66) suggested that a slave's  existence  is  one  devoid  of\n  time-awareness and time-consciousness. A slave lacks both of the above\n  since he is  not  master  of  his  own  time.  The master  owns  not \n  only  the  body  of  his slave,  he  possesses  and  regulates  the\n  slave’s every waking moment. AVADIM HAYINU - as slaves in Egypt, our\n  time was  not  our  own.  In  essence,  R' Soloveitchik's  comments \n  expand  upon the  words  of  the  S'forno:  HaChodesh Hazeh  Lachem  -\n  “from  this  point onwards the months shall be yours to do as  you \n  see  fit.  During  the  days  of bondage, however, they did not belong\n  to you. They existed instead for the purpose of  serving  others  and \n  doing  their  will. Consequently,  this  month  will  become the head\n  of the year, for on this month (Nissan)  you  (the Jewish  People) \n  have begun your free existence.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yonah H. Geller z\"l, stated in my hearing that \"only a free nation has a calendar;\" (since time belongs to HaShem we were chosen and given the mitzvah to sanctify time;) so the short answer is this is the first Mitzvah HaShem commanded to us (Bnai Yisrael) because it is our beginning of The Nation as a free people.</p>\n\n<p>Because we (Yisrael) are referred to as HaShem's firstborn (Shmoth 4.22), we sanctify time in all places.</p>\n\n<p>Freed from slavery, the Jewish people were presented with a sudden treasure of time. As slaves, their time had been taken from them, but now they had a prophet who got it back. What would they do with this segulah?</p>\n\n<p>When sanctifying the new month, the Beth Din declares, “Mekudash, mekudash! Sanctified, sanctified!” Hashem gave the Jewish people the power to sanctify time by what they say and do, not only to give it worth, but to infuse it with holiness. Rosh Chodesh, the first day of the new month, has the status of a minor festival. Tehillim (Psalms) 81.4 reminds us that we can sanctify the moon's renewal of our lives. By living in a way consistent with Torah, we sanctify our time and preserve it for all eternity. The mitzvah of Rosh Chodesh Nissan delivered the gift of time.</p>\n\n<p>The root used in the Torah is Rosh, meaning head or first as in first born,  which is related to rashut. </p>\n\n<p>But before the root, we read \"HaChodeesh hazeh lacheem\" and the implied meaning is that HaShem set the month of Nissan (spring) before Moshe and Ahron as a choice (Choose you this day life...Deuteronomy 30:15-20).</p>\n\n<p>As sabbahillel points out, \"In essence, R' Soloveitchik's comments expand upon the words of the S'forno: HaChodesh Hazeh Lachem - “from this point onwards the months shall be yours to do as you see fit.\" </p>\n\n<p>Here, Moshe, Ahron and the entire Children of Yisrael are given a leadership role (olam hazeh and olam habah - the present status of things being temporal) as demonstrated by their ability to set apart the month of Nissan as the beginning of months. Since we follow the \"correct calendar\" (lunar/solar), Pesach always fall in the spring on the day in which HaShem liberated us from slavery.</p>\n\n<p>Rashut (with a kamatz) means \"authority\". A related term reshut (with a sheva) means permission. (Another term, reshet means net-work as in Shmoth [Exodus] 27:4.) Avshalom Kor [in Yofi Shel Ivrit (chapter 31)] \"writes that rashut comes from the word rosh ראש - \"head\". Klein agrees, and writes that the word is \"probably a shortened spelling for rashut with an alef - ראשות\".\"</p>\n\n<p>The very next commandment after \"sanctification of the new moon\" is to \"draw out and slaughter the god of the Egyptians\" before their eyes!</p>\n\n<p>Since we have \"authority\" to sanctify the new moon; as a public act (Shmoth 12.1-2), we don't need permission for a public act. \"In the private domain - only the individual has permission to act, whereas in the public domain the entire public can do as they please.\" <a href=\"http://www.balashon.com/2007/07/rashut-and-reshut.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.balashon.com/2007/07/rashut-and-reshut.html</a> </p>\n\n\n",

In Nedarim 51a, he causes Rebbi to laugh out loud by placing a basket upside-down on his head, while rash words in Moed Qatan 16a cause Rebbi to rebuke him. He is rebuked by Rebbi in more than one place in the gemara, but the most intriguing is in the Yerushalmi's gemara to the same mishna in Moed Qatan.</p>\n\n<p>There (Moed Qatan 3:1, 81c), the Yerushalmi has him delivering a riddle to Rebbi via Rebbi's unlearned son-in-law. The context, we are told, was that a group of sages were asking learned questions of Rebbi, and Bar Kappara told Rebbi's son-in-law (Bar Elasah) that he should ask something too. When Bar Elasah related what Bar Kappara told him to ask and Rebbi saw Bar Kappara grinning, he rebuked him strongly.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the text of Bar Kappara's riddle, as delivered by Bar Elasah. What follows is my own attempt at a translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאול משמים נשקפה הומיה בירכתי ביתה מפחדת כל בעלי כנפים ראונו נערים\n  ונחבאו וישישים קמו עמדו הנס יאמרו הו הו והנלכד נלכד בעונו</p>\n  \n  <p>Ask the following: \"From heaven she gazes, pining in the corners of\n  her house.

But most importantly, I have absolutely no idea what this passage means, nor why it was offensive to Rebbi.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I would very much appreciate it if somebody could correct my translation, either by breaking the text up differently or showing me where my understanding of any word within it is wrong.

Rebbi said: “I do not recognize you as an Elder!” And Bar Kappara knew that he would not be appointed in the days of Rebbi. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>Artscroll footnote 28 brings a proof from Bavli Nedarim 51a and Eiruvin 86a that Rebbi would show respect to philanthropic wealthy people.</p>\n\n<p>The footnotes in the Artscroll there follow Yefeh Mareh’s reading of the incident, with the exceptions noted below. (These are based on footnotes 30-39.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bar Kappara disapproved of Rebbi’s respect of Bar Elasa (as in the translation above). He asked Bar Elasa (who wasn’t a Torah scholar, but was wealthy - Korban HaEidah) to give rebuke to Rebbi hidden in a riddle that in spite of man’s wealth and power, all men eventually succumb to death (Pnei Moshe). </li>\n<li>“From heaven she gazes down” - “she” is a reference to death.</li>\n<li>“She is tumultuous in the recesses of her house” - Wherever death strikes there is a tumult. </li>\n<li>“She frightens all those that have wings to flee” - All are scared of death and attempt to escape her clutches as if they had wings to fly away. </li>\n<li>“The young men saw me and hid themselves” - the young usually can hide from death; “but the aged arose and stood up” - they will eventually succumb in their old age. </li>\n<li>“The one who flees calls out, ‘Ho! Ho!’ but the one who is trapped became trapped in his sin” - those who flee cry out in despair, knowing full well that they will eventually die and suffer the consequences of their sins. </li>\n<li>Rebbi saw Bar Kappara laughing and realized that he had been set up. He thus told Bar Kappara that the latter would not get Semicha. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Artscroll notes that Karban Ha’Eidah and Sheyarei Karban have different understandings of this incident. Fortunately, both of them are printed on the side of Artscroll’s copy of the Gemara. We will start with the Karban Ha’Eidah. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Karban Ha’Eidah gives the same understanding as above as to the aftermath and does not explain the prompt. Presumably, as Bar Elasa was being given so much honor of which Bar Kappara disapproved, Bar Kappara merely wanted to make him look bad. </li>\n<li>“From heaven she gazes down” - this is the neshamah, which originates in heaven. </li>\n<li>“She is tumultuous in the recesses of her house” - Left unexplained. Possibly refers to childbirth. </li>\n<li>“She frightens all those that have wings” - As animals are under the dominion of man, man can frighten the birds. I’m unclear as to why he discusses birds specifically. </li>\n<li>“The young men saw me and hid themselves” - a reference to those who don’t do the will of their souls (presumably he means that those who act like children); “but the aged arose and stood up” - Although left unexplained, the contrast seems to indicate that those who do the will of their souls will be respected, as an elder is. </li>\n<li>“The one who flees” from sin “calls out, ‘Ho! Ho!’” in joy, “but the one who is trapped became trapped in sin.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, the Sheyarei HaKarban:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rebbi was honoring Bar Elasa, who wasn’t a scholar. Bar Kappara therefore told the following veiled rebuke:</li>\n<li>שאול, translated above as “ask,” means the “depths of the world” - these will rise and “from the heavens she gazes down; she is tumultuous in the recesses of her house; she frightens all those that have wings.” Bar Elasa is the “depths,” as he does not learn Torah, yet he is elevated to the heavens and “gazes down” over the scholars over whom he has been honored. Scholars are compared to birds in Tanna D’vei Eliyahu 27. </li>\n<li>“The young men saw me...” - This line is left unexplained. Perhaps it means that the young men are those who aren’t (and shouldn’t be) honored, and they (appropriately) run from it, while the elderly, who are honored (appropriately), stand up and accept it.  </li>\n<li>“The one who flees” from honor “calls out, ‘Ho! Ho!’” in joy, “but the one who is trapped became trapped in his sin” of pursuing honor. </li>\n<li>When Rebbi saw Bar Kappara laughing, he realized that the riddle was targeted at himself and cursed Bar Kappara that just as he disapproved of others’ honor, so, too, would he not receive honor himself. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Artscroll also references “Mekor Baruch (Torah Temimah) Vol. II, p. 1016; MeYakirei Yerushalmi Vol. I p. 79 note 30,” though I don’t have access to these sefarim. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to Rabbi David Frenkel, in my interpretation of his answer, this means that Bar Kappara told him to say a quote that would make him look haughty.  This riddle shows that he is saying that he is greater than all Torah scholars.\n<a href=\"http://files.daf-yomi.com/bookfiles/beruach-tova/beruach-tova172.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://files.daf-yomi.com/bookfiles/beruach-tova/beruach-tova172.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You might want to modify and post to puzzling.stackexchange but I think the answer could be morning or daylight.\n Rebbi thinks that the riddle is inappropriate because the young men are obviously doing something naughty.</p>\n\n<p>Sunlights comes from heaven and fills the world.\nBirds  go nuts just before daybreak\nYouths stay up all nigh partying and carousing with women and sneak away when daybreak so they aren't caught.\nOld men wake up at dawn for shacharis. </p>\n\n\n",

This was about 1952. The tour guide at the time was a member of the synagogue  and she told us it was a place to hide Jews in the event of a problem.

What  is the special fundamental significance of the number four that God's primary Name has four letters. (I assume it is not a coincidence, ch'v)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Bear with me, I am going to build things up the way the Seder song \"Echad Mi Yodeia / Who knows one?\" does. This post is based on the Maharal's commentary on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 1:2</a> and R' SR Hirch's explanation in <em><a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/collected-writings-of-rabbi-samson-raphael-hirsch.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Collected Writings</a></em> III on the symbolism of the numbers 3 & 4.</p>\n<p>\"One is Hashem\". Nothing more need to be said.</p>\n<p>\"Two are the tablets\". On one tablet are mitzvos bein adam laMaqom (between a person and the Omnipresent), on the other, bein adam lachareivo (between a person and their peers).</p>\n<p>The first tablet speaks to man-the-recipient; Hashem gives and we enjoy His Good. But there is a paradox in that -- since the Ultimate Good He could share with us is his Own \"Nature\", to be in His Image, givers in the same way He is a Giver. And so we have the commandments of the second tablet, telling us to relate to others as givers, not takers. (There is an important distinction here between taking and receiving; receiving can be giving or taking, depending on how it's done. See R' EE Dessler's Qunterus haChessed in Michtav meiEliyahu vol I -- Discourse on Lovingkindness in <em><a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/strive-for-truth.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Strive for Truth</a></em> vol 1.)</p>\n<p>\"Three are the fathers.\" And so the human condition is dialectical -- we exist both to receive and to give. And out of dialectical tension grows a third entity, the \"I\" who has to navigate the dialectic. Every human choice grows out of a tension between two desires. One may be good and the other evil, but also between two conflicting goods, such as between choosing truth or peace (tact).</p>\n<p>And so the Torah holds up for us three archetypes, one for each of three pillars of the world listed by R' Shimon haTzadiq in Avos 1:2: Torah, Avodah (worshipping G-d), Gemillus Chassadim (supporting acts of lovingkindness).</p>\n<p>Abraham taught the world that we exist to be givers, and is associated with Chessed -- kindness that grows out of a feeling of love / unity with others.</p>\n<p>Yitzchaq taught us that our ability to be kind depends on our having a relationship with G-d, so that we can draw down His Good and work with Him. (Kind atheists can only provide what seems to be good from our limited and often short-sighted human perspective. Nor can they get the same level of aid from Hashem, since they aren't trying to get any.)</p>\n<p>And Yaaqov was the man of truth, the man of Torah, the one who taught us that unless we develop our own minds and character, all those highfalutin plans won't actually end up being lived. It is too easy to get caught up in alternate desires and invent excuses to ourselves to justify them.</p>\n<p>And so, human action is threefold: Avraham teaches us how to improve this world and connect to those in it, Yitzchaq -- how to draw from heaven and the One Who \"dwells upon high\", and Yaaqov -- how to perfect that universe between our ears and perfect how we relate to ourselves and our own souls.</p>\n<p>\"Four are the mothers\". In Qabbalah, like in procreation, the male is that which initiates a process, and the female is where it develops to its full form. Thus the \"three fathers\" is how we act on the world, and the \"four mothers\" is how G-d's \"Actions\" are received by and effects upon us.</p>\n<p>And so, we see G-d as beyond beyond the three ways we act; if we act in three ways, His action is in \"four\" -- where we lump everything beyond the three in a single \"beyond us\" category.</p>\n<p>\"HaKel, haGadol, haGibbor, vehaNorah -- the G-d, the Great One, the Mighty One, and the Awesome One\", as Moshe put it and we say at least thrice daily in the Amidah. (As translated by the Vilna Gaon ad loc.)</p>\n<p>HaKel - G-d who is transcendent, logically prior to any attachment to Creation. Picture the yud of the tetragrammaton, floating there off the top line (the shirtut of a Torah scroll).</p>\n<p>HaGadol -- Great, Immense, in fact, Omnipresent. This is the G-d of Creation. Everything that exists is caused by Him. Picture the first hei. G-d the Giver.</p>\n<p>HaGibbor -- the Mighty One, in the sense of Strength of Character. Gevurah is the might of the immovable rock, not the irresistable force. The gibbor is the hero who can resist his evil inclination (Avos 1:2). It's the G-d who \"steps back\" from creating to give us \"room\" to be givers ourselves. Hashem gave us natural law saw that we can make plans and act intelligently; even if though it limits what we can expect Him to do. The constricted line of the vav, the third letter of His Name, connecting Him to us.</p>\n<p>VehaNora -- Awe-Inspiring. The G-d of miracles, both those that defy nature and the hidden ones. Hashem's Plan is manifest even though/when He so constricts His Choice of Actions. The final hei, again spread out.</p>\n<p>This is also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Barukh -- the Wellspring,</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Atah Hashem -- You (we can say \"You\"!) are the Merciful that Underlies Existence,</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Elokeinu -- our Lawmaker of natural law, which is the level on which most of us generally relate to the world(s),</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>veElokei Avoseinu -- our ancestor's Lawmaker, creator of Moral Law, and thus the Worker of miracles when moral law superceeds physical laws.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Creation is done as \"Eser Maamaros - 10 Utterances.\" (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 5:1</a>; Rashi -- <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 1:1</a> and the 9 times it says \"vayomer -- and He was saying\" in that chapter.) Each of these Utterances had four aspects, yielding the idea that Creation comes in 40. And when a person avoids creative activity on Shabbos, he rests from \"40 missing one\" categories of such activity. The 40 G-d performed, but one of them -- making something out of nothing -- is beyond our abilities either way. And so building the Tabernacle, a microcosm, involved 39 creative activities, none of which are performed on Shabbos. And when someone sins in a way that undermines creation, his punishment is \"40 missing 1\" lashes (or as many up to that number his health can tolerate).</p>\n<p>Where, scripturally, do we (Tiqonei Zohar in three places) get this idea that all of G-d's Actions are felt in four ways?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.43.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshaiah 43:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כֹּ֚ל הַנִּקְרָ֣א בִשְׁמִ֔י וְלִכְבוֹדִ֖י בְּרָאתִ֑יו יְצַרְתִּ֖יו אַף־עֲשִׂיתִֽיו׃</p>\n<p>Every one that is</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>called by My name, and</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>whom I have created (Barasi) for My glory,</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I have formed (Yatzarti) him, even,</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I have made (Asisiv) him.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so, beyond our three world is G-d's name, the world Qabbalists call Atzilus, and our three which they call Beri'ah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah. 3+1.

    "content": "# Conversion and Identifying as a Jew\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently I have been made aware of many people who are in the conversion process who already call themselves Jews. By \"in the process\" I mean that they're beginning to learn Hebrew, doing Torah study with a Rabbi, attending services on Shabbat. Some are keeping kosher, tzniut, and are Shabbat observant. I should mention that the potential converts in question are women, so there would be no circumcision. As far as I know, there has not been any immersion in a mikvah.  I don't know if it's important to mention that they are not seeking orthodox conversions- some reform, some conservative- but none that I know of are prepared to convert with an orthodox rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: When can somebody in the process of conversion refer to themselves and expect for others to refer to them as a Jew? Also, are they recognized as converts while they are in the process of conversion, or is that a title that comes after the conversion has been completed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>One becomes a Jew after the process -- <em>beit din</em>, circumcision (for men), and <em>mikveh</em> -- is complete.  Until then, one is \"studying for conversion\" or \"working toward conversion\" or, in some circles, a \"Jew in training\".  (These are informal descriptions, not formal status.)  It's not proper for somebody going through the process to prematurely claim the final status.  This is true regardless of what movement the person is studying in.</p>\n\n<p>A possible source of confusion is that prior to actual conversion, somebody going through this process is generally expected to take on <em>mitzvot</em>, starting small and building over time.  So the convert-to-be starts to <em>act</em> like a Jew, mostly, but is not yet a Jew.  Others in the community who observe the behavior and don't know the circumstances might conclude that the person is a Jew.  If people are calling the convert-to-be a Jew, perhaps it is due to that.  (The convert-to-be should correct these misunderstandings when aware of them.)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are cases <em>outside</em> of the Jewish community where people on this path simplify as a matter of expedience.  One might self-identify as Jewish to an employer in explaining why you need those days off, or when asked to specify a religion<sup>1</sup> upon hospital admission because if <em>any</em> clergy is going to visit you want a rabbi, or in arranging food when visiting somebody.  But <em>within</em> the Jewish community, the person working toward conversion should be more careful, both as a matter of being truthful and to avoid problems like accidentally being counted in a <em>minyan</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> I know it's more complicated.  But I know that hospitals where I live ask about this, and the people collecting the forms really don't care that it's more complicated.</p>\n\n\n",

(For example, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/946703/jewish/What-happened-on-the-Ninth-of-Av.htm\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/1088\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/13552\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>I call it curious, since it takes a fairly creative reading of history to see the war as having begun on a single date in particular, and specifically on the 1st of August, 1914. Already on the 28th of July, Austria had declared war on Serbia, and the first shots of the war were fired on the 29th. Those two dates correspond to the 5th and the 6th of Av, respectively. It was on the 9th of Av (already after Russia had fully mobilised) that Germany invaded Luxembourg and declared war on Russia, but I am not aware of there being a single historian who thinks that was \"the beginning\" of the war. (For more information on these events, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Crisis\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know, when did people first start suggesting that the war began on the 9th of Av? Was it during the war (1914-1918) itself? Was it during the interwar period? Or was it specifically during or after the Holocaust?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is a long tradition of relating the 9th of Av to specific tragedies that have occurred to the Jewish people - a tradition that has its origins in the Mishna, Taanit 4:6. I'm not querying <i>why</i> people would want to fit the first world war into this model, but only when people first started doing so.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>The historian Ismar Elbogen in his \"Century of Jewish Life\", which he wrote before he passed away in 1943 and was published posthumously, places the beginning of the war on Tisha B'Av of 1914.</p>\n\n<p>But I think that Jewish people thought of the war as having begun on Tisha B'Av even from the start of the war itself. We can see this from their memoirs. Let me cite a couple that I've come across.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an excerpt from \"<em>Megillat Puraniyot</em>\", written by Avraham Asher Finshtein about the effects of the war in Pinsk, and published in 1929 (available <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/44203\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חדש מנחם־אב תרע\"ד. שמועות מבהילות התחילו באות בעתונים. האויר התעבה. הרגש מחנק קשה. הבינונו, כי מאורעות נוראים מתרגשים ובאים. עננים שחורים\n   נצברו בקצה האופק והד רעמים נשמע מרחוק. אירופא התחילה מתניסת. היום\n   אוסטריה, מחר רוסיה ומחרתים גרמניה וצרפת. בנשימה עצורה חכו הכל לתוצאות\n   ההתרנזות, שתקפה את עמי אירופא. בבקר בבקר היו משכימים לרוץ אל הדואר\n   לקבל את העתונים, למען דעת מה ילד יום אתמול. העצבים נמתחו עד כדי להפקע\n   והלב דפק בחזקה. והנה הרעים הרעם. <strong>טלגרמה קצרה, שנתקבלה בעיר בצום\n   החמישי, הודיעה כי גרמניה הכריזה מלחמה על צרפת ועל רוסיה</strong>, אוסטריה מצדה\n   קראה גם היא מלחמה על שתי הממלכות האלה, ורוסיה וצרפת ענו גם הן בקריאת\n   מלחמה. ופתאום והנה נם יפוניה מתערבת בתוך המערבולת. ריח דם ודמעות התחיל\n   נודף באויר, המון שדי בלהות הגיחו מעמקי תחתיות לבלע את כל היקום. לא היו\n   ימים מועטים וגם בריטניה השליכה את עצמה אל תוך הקלחת הרותחת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As he describes it (I don't have the time now to translate the passage), the buildup of tension in Europe was happening in the days preceding Tisha B'Av. They probably even knew about the war declared on Serbia by Austria-Hungary, but, as you will find in many a history book, people in Europe did not necessarily think that the small local war would spark a <em>world</em> war. Only when the major powers got involved, Germany and Russia, did people think of the real war as starting. And <em>that</em> they heard about only on Tisha B'Av itself.</p>\n\n<p>Another memoir with a similar sentiment comes from R' David Essrig who grew up in Tzfat (later of Utica, NY). He published autobiographical essays together with his <em>seforim</em>. The following comes from his first one, published in 1952 (available <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21247\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>בשנת תרע״ד בט' באב</strong> שחל באותה שנה במוש״ק,‏ ישבנו על הארץ בצפת בביה״כ אר״י החדש וקראנו מגילת איכה,‏ אבל כמה צער וכאב הרגשנו יותר משנה אחרת,‏ יגון וקדרות כיסה את כל פנים,‏ וביחוד אני לבי נשבר בקרבי ובכיתי מאין הפוגות!‏ ‏(ראה מגילה ג.‏ ״אע״ג דהוא לא חזי מזלי׳ חזי״)‏ <strong>למחר התפשטה כבר שמועה הנוראה כי נכרזה מלחמה</strong> בין אוסטריא וסרביא,‏ ולאט לאט נשתלשלה מלחמה עולמית שהביאה חורבן עולמי,‏ וביחוד חורבן עמנו וארצנו הק'.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He too remembers the beginnings of war as connected with the Tisha B'Av experience. He recalls hearing about the war starting (even just the declaration of war on Serbia; the news may have reached Palestine a few days late, or it may have only been considered relevant once it sparked a bigger war) on Tisha B'Av itself.</p>\n\n\n",

But, even\n  if it takes a lot of effort this moment can be reached,</p>\n  \n  <p>c) חזק firm, consciously opposes any pliancy, any submission. Even the\n  impression is lost as far as any consequences of it go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, at first, Par'o doesn't even feel any worry or give any thought to what Moshe is saying. He totally ignores it and it passes over him like the wind. The words mean nothing to him like the sound of the wind. Once he has seen the plagues starting, he makes his will (which is symbolized by the heart) חזק. He reaffirms his will and makes a conscious effort to refuse to accept the results of what he is seeing. Then כבד, even though his conscious will might be moved, the inertia of his previous decisions are maintained so that even if he is ready to change his mind, he does not move. Note that at the final plagues (חושך and ים סוף) even when the inertia is overcome, Par'o consciously refuses to allow the pressure to move him.</p>\n\n<p>Dealing with your quotes specifically, any translations will be from Rav Hirsch.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>7:3: \"I will 'kasheh' Paroh's heart.\"<br>\nI will make Par'o capable of ignoring the warnings that he will receive and of rationalizing what happens.</p></li>\n<li><p>7:13 (after the staffs turning into snakes): \"Paroh's heart was 'yechazeik'.\"<br>\nPar'o rationalized that his own magicians (and even the children) could do this so that he made a conscious decision to refuse the sign.</p></li>\n<li><p>7:22 (Dam): \"Paroh's heart was 'yechazeik'.\"<br>\nPar'o reaffirmed to himself that it was still \"just magic\" (since his magicians could make blood, even though they could not cancel it) and made a conscious decision to <em>let the duel continue</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>8:11 (Tzefardeia): \"His heart was 'hichbed'.\"<br>\nHere he had to harden his heart to refuse to recognize what is going on so that he would not be affected by what he was being forced to recognize. Moshe had not only brought the frogs, but he had gotten rid of them and returned them to the river as normal, which was a difference of quality and an unpecedented precision.</p></li>\n<li><p>8:15 (Kinnim): \"Paroh's heart was 'yechazeik'.\"<br>\nAs the third in the group that came about without warnoin (as punishment for ignoring the previous two) Par'o had to again consciously decide to reaffirm his previous decisions and deny Moshe's request.</p></li>\n<li><p>8:28 (Arov): \"Paroh 'yachbeid' his heart.\"<br>\nPar'o \"hardened* his heart so that the effect of the Arov would not move him to recat as Moshe wanted. Again, it is a matter of making himself stubborn rather than just reaffirming an earlier decisision.</p></li>\n<li><p>9:7 (Dever): \"Paroh's heart was 'yachbeid'.\"<br>\nNote that \"this time too\" Par'o \"made his heart stubborn' so that it would be difficult to move him once Hashem had showed that he could not follow through completely on his threat. After all, only those animals in the fields died.</p></li>\n<li><p>9:12 (Shechin): \"Hashem 'yechazeik' Paroh's heart.\"<br>\nNote that Hashem this time <em>allowed the heart of Par'o to remain strong</em>. That is he now gives Par'o the strength to reaffirm his earlier decision (as with Kinim) in the face of this sudden blow. As with Kinim it came with no warning as a punishment for ignoring the other two. Thus, inertia was not enough and it had to be a conscious reaffirmation of his earlier decision.</p></li>\n<li><p>9:34-35 (Barad): \"He continued sinning and 'yichbad' his heart...Paroh's heart was 'yechabeid'.\"<br>\nThis was the first of the last group of three, and Par'o was made <em>kaved</em> so that it would be difficult to move him.</p></li>\n<li><p>10:20 (Arbeh): \"Hashem 'yechazeik' Paroh's heart.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>10:27 (Choshech): \"Hashem 'yechazeik' Paroh's heart.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>11:10 (Bechoros, Krias Yam Suf - see Rashi): \"Hashem 'yechazeik' Paroh's heart.\"  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now for the remainder, everything is based on a conscious decision to ignore the results of everything that had gone before. Had it <em>only</em> been the result of inertia, Par'o would have broken, the two complete sets of makos and the beginning of the third set showed that is was not lack of power that stopped Hashem from carrying through the destruction of Mtzraim, but a carefully planned and precisely executed set of operations. Thus, everything that follows had to be the result of a cold blooded calculation to see if Hashem would give up when He saw that Par'o would not break. Or perhaps a decision to see if at the very last, Hashem had to withdraw as a result of the final \"sphere of influence\" of the \"gods\" of Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>Consider that the belief of the pagans was that the \"gods\" were a super powerful race of magicians who had their own territory and abilities and could only be defeated by a more powerful \"member of their race\".</p>\n\n<p>In fact we see that the servants of Par'o are begging him to give in and get rid of the Bnai Yisraelin <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9871#showrashi=true&v=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bo 10:7</a> Only the will of Par'o allows them to stand.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>13:15 (Response to Tam): \"And it was when Paroh 'hiksheh' to send us...\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This last is a description of the general situation as seen from the outside. From the outside, the struggles and discussions that must have gone on, as well as the different motives, were invisible. As Rav Hirsch says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Par'o denied Hashem, refused what Hashem demanded of him, called his\n  own that which was through and through Hashem's. Hashem punished the\n  obstinacy with which the Egyptians denied this fact of belonging to\n  Him, by killing their firstborn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The meforshim (as taken from sefaria.org) look at the word \"Na\" as meaning \"alive\" or undercooked, often based on a connection to an Arabic word. As Rashi writes, \"Heb. נָא Something not roasted sufficiently is called נָא in Arabic.\" The Bechor Shor writes, \" תרגם אונקלוס כד חי כי נא חי שאינו מבושל כל צרכו בערבי\". This meaning of the word occurs only here (or, as the Ibn Ezra puts it, \" ובדרך הזאת לא מצאנו בכל המקרא \"). A look in the Even Shoshan confirms this.</p>\n\n<p>The Rashbam writes, \"I believe this means a type of frying in a pot but in its own juice (including the blood) not involving water known as צלי קדר, not roasting directly on the fire, as required by our verse here \". His practical application of halacha would be different, then.</p>\n\n<p>This is intended to be a direct law applicable for the generations -- why would the text use a word which needs to be figured out, and why would the text switch to the Arabic? Was the Hebrew unable to describe \"not roasted completely\" or \"raw\"? Oftentimes, the text uses a less well known word because it imports a subtlety in meaning. What does relying on the Arabic hapax in this case add to understanding that would have been absent had the text stayed with Hebrew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says that it is indeed a subtlety in the meaning that is being expressed here.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9873#v=9&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bo (12:9)</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>it is derived from נוא (to be disturbed, to be interrupted in a\n  movement which has been commenced) incomplete ...<br>\n  The opposite is בשל מבושל במים to be thoroughly cooked by the addition\n  of water or other liquid.

    "content": "# Why is there a number switch in the names of the plagues?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the makkot, there seems to be inconsistency in terms of the number-title of the plagues. One of the words is in the singular (tz'farde'a, frog) while the one after it is in the plural, kinim, lice.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9869/jewish/Chapter-8.htm#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> gives two answers as to why the 2nd plague is in the singular and references the 3rd:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Heb. וַתַּעַל הַצְפַרְדֵעַ, literally, and the frog came up. It was one frog, and they [the Egyptians] hit it, and it split into many swarms of frogs. This is its midrashic interpretation (Tanchuma, Va’era 14); for its simple meaning, it can be said that the swarming of the frogs is referred to as singular, and likewise, “and the lice were (וַתְּהִי הַכִּנָם) ” (verse 13), the swarming, pedoiliyere in Old French, swarming of lice, and also וַתַּעַל הַצְּפַרְדֵּע, grenoylede in Old French, swarming of frogs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But his explanation doesn't seem to fit -- the singular of lice in English is louse, in Hebrew, <a href=\"http://www.morfix.co.il/en/louse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kinah</a> according to Milon Morfix and Ken according to Even Shoshan (as in Even Shoshan's understanding of Yeshayahu 51:6, which is substantiated by the Malbim Beur Hamilot on Sefaria, \" נוכל לאמר כי מלת כן הוא הנפרד מן כנים, כמו קן מן קנים, ככנה ימותו\"), not kinam.</p>\n\n<p>Kinam, it seems, is a specific word for \"swarm\" -- Rashi says it is a collective word treated as the singular in pasuk 13.</p>\n\n<p>So if the simple singular is used for \"frog infestation\", why not use the simple singular for \"louse infestation\"? And if there is a technical term for a swarm of lice, why not use that instead of the basic plural?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The plural is used in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9869/jewish/Chapter-8.htm#v=14&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vaera 8:14</a> because the <em>magicians</em> could not attempt to bring a \"swarm of lice\" but did attempt to bring individual lice (as with the frogs in 8:3). Thus, Moshe Rabbeinu brought a unified swarm (singular) and the chartumim attempted to <em>match</em> what he did with a bunch of indivdual creations (plural).</p>\n\n<p>The plural is used in 8:12 because hashem said lice (plural) will appear througout the land of Egypt. That is He was describing the final result a would be seen by the Egyptians. Moshe brought a unified swarm that dispersed throughout and attacked every Egyptian.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The number switch in <em>makos</em> is probably due to the fact that only one type of frogs attacked Mitzraim as Rashi alludes, while in the case of lice there were 3 different types, as seen on wikipedia: <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">head lice, body lice, and pubic lice</a>, which covered entire bodies of the Mitzrim. For example, head lice does not live on other body parts. The plural of כינה as כינים with masculine ending is not common, but such is the adopted grammar. The fact that a single species is in female כינה confirms the fact that female lice are much more common as stated by the wikipedia article.</p>\n\n\n",

This could allow for the choosing of much more than the gender of an offspring. <sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> By Rabbi Joshua Flug, in the <em>Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society</em> XLVIII (Fall 2004), and Fred Rosner in <em>Biomedical Ethics and Jewish Law</em>, among others.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> CRISPR has not been successfully tested on humans yet, but the potential is there. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR#Society_and_culture\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR#Society_and_culture</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is a difficult question to answer, probably because it may challenge the 'spirit' of the law rather than the 'letter' of the law (i.e. halacha). Humans were given the cognitive capacity to create and use the environment around them as resources and tools, for greater good. In Bereishit (2:15) we are commanded to \"work and guard\" the land (i.e. the Garden of Eden). A <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.15?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">number of mefarshim</a> explain this in the broader context of taking responsibility for the resources around us, because no other animal has the capacity to do so... and we have the potential to be the most destructive!</p>\n\n<p>That being said, Jewish scholarship has never abrogated from the use of medicine for the betterment of human wellbeing in general. We embrace it, insofar as it does not pose any specific halachic problem. There are few halachic objections to safe medical intervention after birth unless there is some fundamental halachic problem in using such an intervention (e.g. separating conjoined twins and debates about efficacy/safety of post-birth medication, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Safe gene editing aimed at reducing the risk of potentially hazardous/dangerous genetic diseases and syndromes seems easier to swallow, given that a person may take many preventative measures over his/her lifetime to prevent the likelihood of a health malady in any case (such as vaccinations and healthy lifestyle). We make these informed choices to reduce the risk of danger to our health. </p>\n\n<p>The fundamental difference with gene editing is that, prior to birth, there are changes made to a human genome, which largely 'defines' who we are. This evokes feelings of 'playing God', and may seem wrong. Although, genes and gene expression are highly complex, on principle, removing the \"Parkinson\" gene and the Parkinson gene <em>alone</em> (for example, hypothetically) could very well be a desirable thing. \"Natural\" is not a virtue any more than malaria, typhoid, diabetes, arthritis and acne are natural. People will treat the symptoms of such conditions in any case; is <em>that</em> wrong?</p>\n\n<p>Another reason this is difficult to talk about is because there are plenty people who live utterly fulfilling lives <em>despite</em> their condition (like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Vujicic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nick Vuhicic</a>). There has also been a <a href=\"https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/speakers-with-down-syndrome-give-powerful-un-testimony-we-dont-need-to-be-e\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">debate</a> about whether screening for Down's syndrome is moral or desirable. All of these could be conceivably alleviated in the future through gene editing.</p>\n\n<p>This is not intended to give a 'hard' answer to the OP's question but that although it may seem not to go against any fundamental halachic issue there is a more broad issue that needs addressing that encompasses the 'spirit of the law'.</p>\n\n<p>Alleviating direct suffering is an easier case to make for gene editing, <em>despite</em> numerous people living fulfilling lives <em>despite</em> their conditions. A more challenging question is 'how far could people be willing to take this' i.e. 'designer babies'. I would read <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aldous Huxleys 'A Brave New World'</a> for a stark dystopian perspective.</p>\n\n<p>See Rabbi Sacks in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESCINfvMcuw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this video</a> (minute 27+), who makes a distinction between theraputic and eugenic genetic intervention.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did they breathe during the plague of darkness?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Despite some great answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/13624/501\"><em>The Plague of Darkness</em></a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/25681/501\"><em>Plague of darkness: if he was standing, he was unable to sit?</em></a> I still have a question.</p>\n\n<p>If the darkness was so thick that they couldn't move, how were they able to breathe? It's not possible to survive 3 days (or even 3 minutes) without breathing.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, based on the comments: The verse (<a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00761.html#HtmpReportNum0009_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmot 10:23</a>) clearly states that nobody got up for 3 days.\n  <code>לֹא רָאוּ אִישׁ אֶת אָחִיו וְלֹא קָמוּ אִישׁ מִתַּחְתָּיו שְׁלֹשֶׁת יָמִים</code>. Even in the darkest darkness one can move. Even blind people move around. What was stopping them from moving and how did it allow them to breathe?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I'll assume from your comments you will find the following a possible answer.</p>\n\n<p>Torah Temimah in chapter 10 #2 raises a few points. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Chazzal said the darkness was as thick as a dinar. What can that mean?</p></li>\n<li><p>According to Rashi there was no daytime,  only night. This however changes sedder bereishis and Hashem already assured Noach that day and night would not stop.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To answer this he would suggest (if not for fear of inventing something new) that the darkness was not in the air, but rather something tangible upon the eyes of the Egyptians. It's thickness was a dinar.</p>\n\n<p>On a less radical note, Rav Hirsch in 7 15 explains the subjugation of the plague of darkness was an imprisonment which caused them to go hungry for three days.\nTo quote him:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God requires no chains or cages to imprison men. God imprisoned them by Night so that they dared not move from the spot where they happened to be, and there they sat, chained to the spot, and went hungry until God gave them light again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The inability to move was a paralyzing fear according to this. Not a physical creation.</p>\n\n<p>According to these opinions, air for breathing was readily available.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Well according to the Ralbag they really couldnt breathe:</p>\n\n<p>The Ralbag on Choshech quotes the Medrash about the darkness being a golden coin thick and explains that the darkness was tangible and so strong that the Mitzrim were forced to plug their nostrils and mouths up and it caused a tremendous suffering. If the air would enter their bodies they could die. </p>\n\n<p>The Bal Kesav V’hakebbalah takes issue with this pshat and asks how it is possible to survive with their nostrils and mouths plugged up for three days.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Hl8hR.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As usual, the Geonim and Rishonim contain the answer.</p>\n\n<p>Rashbam explains that the simple reading of the verse means that they were confined to <strong>their houses</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מתחתיו - מביתו לפי פשוטו, שלא ידעו היכן ילכו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra writes the exact same thing: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא קמו איש מתחתיו. מביתו. כמו שבו איש תחתיו. כי אנה ילכו בלא אור </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I understand correctly, this is the understanding of Rav Saadya Gaon as well.</p>\n\n<p>That being the case, the entire question is obviated.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, some Rishonim agree with the Midrashic interpretation of מתחתיו, as meaning sitting, rather than to the pashtanic view of it meaning confinement to a house, but nevertheless understand that it doesn't means sitting for three days straight, but rather, spending three days <strong>mostly sitting</strong> to avoid injuring themselves, however they were not paralyzed.</p>\n\n<p>This is stated explicitly by the Midrash Sekhel Tov:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא קמו איש מתחתיו שלשת ימים. שאם היה מצרי עומד ממקומו להלך היה נופל וניזוק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, Ramban writes that they would have lit candles, were the fog not so thick as to extinguish them. Evidently, he too understands that they weren't paralyzed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כלומר איד עב מאד שירד מן השמים...והיתה מכבה כל נר, כאשר בכל החפירות העמוקות ובכל מקומות החשך העצום לא יתקיים הנר, וכן העוברים בהרי חשך לא יעמד להם שם הנר ולא האש כלל...ואלמלא כן היו משתמשין בנרות </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In summary, to answer <code>The verse (Shmot 10:23) clearly states that nobody got up for 3 days.</code>, that is true. But if you mean <code>the darkness was so thick that they couldn't move</code>, that is not \"clearly true\" and is in fact rejected by Rassag, Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Ramban, Midrash Sekhel Tov, and others (such as HaKtav V'HaKabbalah).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, there is no reason to imagine that they would have had any difficulty breathing.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/71244/8775\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/71244/8775</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Numbers 11:26-11:26</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Malbi\"m here explains that prophecy generally flows through those worthy to those less worthy. In the case of the Seventy Elders, they received their prophecy through Moses when they gathered in the Mishkan. However, Eldad and Meidad were different than the other Seventy, in that they were worthy in their own right to receive prophecy. Immediately upon being registered, the prophetic spirit rested on them and because of that they had no need - and didn't go - to the Mishkan with the rest of the Elders.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולדעתי, האנשים האלה היו מוכנים לנבואה מצד עצמם, וכל הנביאים בדור ההוא קבלו נבואתם מכחו של משה שהוא היה הצנור המריק שפע הנבואה לכלם, כי דרך האור האלהי להתפלש דרך המאורות הגדולים על הקטנים ובל שימצא מאור יותר גדול יתפלש האור עליו עד שהוא יעשה צנור ואמצעי להריק האור על ידו על הכוכבים הקטנים כמו שתקבל הארץ אור השמש בלילה באמצעות הירח, והיה אז פני משה כפני חמה ופני יהושע כפני לבנה ופני מצדיקי הרבים הזקנים ככוכבים, שהאצילו אור פני משה על העם. אמנם אלדד ומידד היו מאורות גדולים בפני עצמם עד שהיו מוכנים לקבל האור האלהי ושפע הנבואה שלא באמצעות משה בצנור בפני עצמו, ותיכף שנכתבו בין הכתובים הנבחרים מכל שבט חל עליהם הרוח, וע\"כ לא יצאו האהלה שתחול עליהם הרוח באמצעות משה כי, חל עליהם הרוח בפ\"ע, ונשארו במחנה, בשגם כי אחר שהיתה מעלתם גדולה כ\"כ לא היה אפשר עוד שיהיו ממנין הזקנים שהיה צריך שיהיו זקני העם ר\"ל המוכנים להנהגה שפלה טבעיית (כנ\"ל  פסוק ט\"ז) והם היתה מעלתם גבוהה מזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly \"the spirit\" in posuk 26 refers to prophetic spirit in general. While in 25 \"the spirit\" is \"the spirit that was on Moses (26:17)\" that was shared by the 70 Elders.</p>\n\n\n",

We do not wait for her to give birth unless she's already in labor.</p>\n\n<p>The reason we don't wait is called <em>Inuy HaDin</em>; once a criminal is sentenced we don't put them through the agony of waiting for their sentence to be executed (pun intended). The execution takes place on the same day as the sentencing. The only delay is the time it takes to walk from the Bet Din to the location of the execution.</p>\n\n<p>Even though if we wait we will have saved another person's life, <em>Inuy HaDin</em> takes precedence.</p>\n\n<p><sup>Once she's in labor, the fetus is considered as being alive and killing her would mean that the executor is killing <strong>two</strong> people, so we have to wait. Until she's in labor the fetus is considered part of her; we kill her heart, lungs, hands and fetus. Halacha doesn't consider this as killing 2 people.</sup></p>\n\n<p>So even in Bet Din we see that we don't consider waiting in order to save lives when the Halacha is that the criminal must be executed - no matter how indispensable the person is.</p>\n\n<p>The only solution would be to not sentence him in the first place. </p>\n\n\n",

However, they do not fit into a particular Hasidic sect as a whole, although I am sure there are some shtiebels out there that use them. I own both <a href=\"http://artscroll.com/Books/9780899066516.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Tefillas Shlomo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899066578.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Eitz Chaim</a>, and I can attest that they are exactly the same in nusach. The only thing that is different is that <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899066578.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Eitz Chaim</a> has an English translation facing the original Hebrew, and <a href=\"http://artscroll.com/Books/9780899066516.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Tefillas Shlomo</a> is all-Hebrew, including the instructions. Both are nice siddurim, I might add. </p>\n\n<p>Most Hasidic sects have their own distinct version of Nusach Sefard, based on the way their Rebbe interpreted the writings of the Arizal and reconciled them to the original Nusach Ashkenaz. For instance, Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev made his own version of Nusach Sefard based on his interpretation of the Arizal, and this siddur is known as the Berditchever Siddur. Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum of Satmar himself only davened from such a siddur, and, truth be told, the Berditchever Siddur is a very popular siddur amongst Hasidim. Chabad, on the other hand, has <a href=\"http://store.kehotonline.com/prodinfo.asp?number=EP-STH.AEL\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Tehillat Hashem</a>, a \"Nusach Ari\" siddur as interpreted by the Baal HaTanya. The <a href=\"http://seforimcenter.com/Siddur-Tzvi-Tiferet---Chol-Minhagei-Munkatch-__p-10831.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Munkatcher Siddur</a> is a Nusach Sefard siddur according to the minhagim of Munkatch. </p>\n\n<p>Since every Hasidic sect has its own customs concerning the prayers, the industry of Nusach Sefard siddurim can oftentimes become confusing. Thus, ArtScroll and other publishers have attempted in (fairly) recent years to create a standardized, \"universal\" Nusach Sefard,  Both of these siddurim in question you have asked about are this kind. \"Universal,\" meaning, \"not standing by one particular group of Hasidim.\" </p>\n\n<p>Like I mentioned before, ArtScroll's Nusach Sefard is Hasidic in nature. I cannot name everything that makes it this way, but here a few things that make it stand out: Hodu before Baruch She'amar, Lechai Olamim, Patach Eliyahu, Yedid Nefesh, Ka'agavna after Kabbalat Shabbat instead of Bameh Madlikin, Kiddush (puts \"ki hu yom\" in brackets, etc.), the Amidah (Morid HaTal, etc.), Tachanun, and a bunch of Yehi Ratzon-s before blessings...Just to name a few. Although these things I have listed are indeed included in Edut HaMizrach siddurim of the Sephardi rite, I will mention that these siddurim are obviously Ashkenazi from these things: Birkat HaMazon, only ten lines in Adon Olam, Gott fun Avrohom before Havdalah, etc. Not to mention ArtScroll is an Ashkenazi publisher, and the transliterations in the siddurim are Ashkenazi in nature...</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest you go with <a href=\"http://www.nehora.com/siddur-kol-yaakov-hachadash-sefard/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Kol Yaakov HaChadash</a>, a \"universal\" Nusach Sefard siddur that a lot of Hasidim are quite fond of, or <a href=\"http://www.nehora.com/siddur-tefila-yeshara-vketer-nehora-2-vol/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Tefillah Yesharah V'Keter Nehora</a>, the Berditchever Siddur. You will find especially that the Berditchever Siddur seems to follow the writings of the Arizal better than these \"universal\" siddurim. Also, the Berditchever Siddur contains plenty of Hasidic sources and the typeset is usually in Ashuri letters!</p>\n\n\n",

That Tosafos is based on the teachings of R' Yitzchak of Dampierre, nephew to Rabbeinu Tam and great-grandson to Rashi. (There were other Tosafos like Tosafos HaRosh, Tosafos R' Peretz, etc.) Unless given reason to think otherwise, I would assume the R' Yitzchak referred to is R' Yitzchak of Dampierre.

But, now that they see that Moses split the sea, and the land is dry, why do they keep insisting on additional miracles as described by Avot D'Rav Nattan? He describes their insistence on 10 different miracles before they actually passed through the sea. If their faith was so weak, what was it about the last one mentioned (there were like \"skins\" in the water that fed the babies oil and honey.) that convinced them?</p>\n\n<p>(I realize that Avot Derav Nattan is describing some Midrash (I don't know his source).

    "content": "# Did anyone other than Rashi think the Ark could \"bear itself\" (Joshua 4:18)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The text of Joshua 4:18 holds an oddity:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַ֠יְהִי בעלות [כַּעֲל֨וֹת] הַכֹּהֲנִ֜ים נֹשְׂאֵ֨י אֲר֤וֹן בְּרִית־יְהוָה֙ מִתּ֣וֹךְ הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן <strong>נִתְּק֗וּ כַּפּוֹת֙ רַגְלֵ֣י הַכֹּהֲנִ֔ים אֶ֖ל הֶחָרָבָ֑ה</strong> וַיָּשֻׁ֤בוּ מֵֽי־הַיַּרְדֵּן֙ לִמְקוֹמָ֔ם וַיֵּלְכ֥וּ כִתְמוֹל־שִׁלְשׁ֖וֹם עַל־כָּל־גְּדוֹתָֽיו׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or in the <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0604.htm#18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JPS 1917 translation</a>,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And it came to pass, as the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up out of the midst of the Jordan, <strong>as soon as the soles of the priests' feet were drawn up unto the dry ground,</strong> that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have put in bold the bit that is curious. The \"plain sense\" here would appear to be that the priests were, somehow, \"carried\" or lifted out of the stream bed, although this sense is usually not conveyed in modern translations. The <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.4.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1985 JPS Tanakh</a> has \"...and the feet of the priests stepped onto the dry ground,...\" at this point.</p>\n\n<p>However, the text was taken at \"face value\" <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15788#v=18&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">by Rashi</a>, who offered this comment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up</strong>: from the water to the dry land which was beside them, and the waters returned to their place. Hence, the Ark is found to be on one side and Israel on the other side. Accordingly, the Ark lifted its bearers and passed over. And concerning this matter, Uzzah was punished when he took hold of the Ark. If it bore its bearers, can it not be deduced by <em>a fortiori</em> conclusion that it can bear itself?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So clearly Rashi believes the the Ark had the power to \"levitate\", and even then to bear the priests on to dry land. He uses this to explain the case of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15866#v=6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">divine anger against Uzzah in 2 Samuel 6</a>, since if this is true -- that the Ark can \"bear itself\" -- then Uzzah's intervention was not required.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, then, <strong>my question is this</strong>: was Rashi anticipated or followed in this interpretation of Joshua 4:18? I have checked the modern \"scholarly\" commentaries fairly carefully, and there isn't a hint of this anywhere. (I haven't checked my Miqra'ot Gedolot, though.) I would be fascinated to know if there is a larger tradition of interpretation in the vein of Rashi's comment.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Rashi's source is a Gemara in Sotah (<a href=\"http://sefaria.org/sotah.35a.15\">35a</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נמצא ארון ונושאיו וכהנים מצד אחד וישראל מצד אחד נשא ארון את נושאיו ועבר שנאמר (יהושע ד, יא) ויהי כאשר תם כל העם לעבור ויעבור ארון ה' והכהנים לפני העם\n  ועל דבר זה נענש עוזא שנאמר (דברי הימים א יג, ט) ויבאו עד גורן כידון וישלח עוזא את ידו לאחוז את הארון אמר לו הקב\"ה עוזא נושאיו נשא עצמו לא כל שכן </p>\n  \n  <p>It follows that the Ark and its bearers and the priests were on one side of the Jordan, the east side, and the rest of the Jewish people were on the other side, the west side. Subsequently, the Ark carried its bearers in the air and crossed the Jordan, as it is stated: “When all the people were completely passed over, the Ark of the Lord passed on, and the priests, before the people” (Joshua 4:11). \n  And over this matter Uzzah was punished for not taking proper care of the Ark, as it is stated: “And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put forth his hand to hold the Ark; for the oxen stumbled” (I Chronicles 13:9).

    "content": "# What's the deal with horseradish at the seder?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Every Pesach seder I've been to, including ones run by Chabad and Hillel, has used horseradish root as the <em>maror</em>.  But this seems to be <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/79825/bracha-of-borei-pri-haadamah-for-horseradish-at-the-seder#comment242185_79825\">controversial</a> -- maybe horseradish isn't ok at all, or maybe horseradish <em>leaves</em> are but not the <em>root</em>.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27205/whats-the-best-way-to-dip-maror-into-charoset-if-youre-using-horseradish#comment63544_27205\">comment</a> cites the Mishna B'rura (473:42) as allowing.  Other comments there say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you mean ample late authorities, then yes that is the case. You will be hard pressed to find rishonim who say so, and any who do are likely referring to the horseradish leaf, not root, as the Mishna seems to explicitly exclude the root. See for instance, Haghot Maymoniot 8:13 who notes horseradish as the translation and then immediately says that roots are no good.  – Double AA♦ Mar 18 '13 at 5:30</p>\n<p>@DoubleAA Yes, I was referring to acharonim mostly. | The Hagahos Maimoniyos (7:13) mentions horseradish (\"meerrettich\"), as you pointed out. He then goes on to cite Rabbeinu Tam, who I initially interpreted as inferring that the species of maror mentioned in the mishna can only be eaten moist if their roots are eaten, whereas their stalks can be eaten moist or dried out. At least that's what I think Rabbeinu Tam might have been saying based on the context of the gemara, though I didn't see the direct quote. The Shulchan Aruch, though, says explicitly that roots are no good....  – Fred Mar 18 '13 at 6:58</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also read somewhere that horseradish is dubious <em>but</em> has such a long tradition for Ashkenazim to be valid for that community.</p>\n<p>So, what's the deal with horseradish?  Who permits it, and are there any conditions?  Who forbids it outright?  It looks like I could assemble a partial answer from these comments, but I'd rather have a complete answer in one place, hence this question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>TLDR: The Talmud's preferred plant for Maror is lettuce-like and leafy. In cold climates people started using horseradish <em>root</em> because it was still too cold to grow leafy plants at Pesach time, and if you put together the right combination of opinions you can construct an argument that horseradish root fulfills the Mitzva. The argument isn't particularly convincing nor does it represent the majority of classical opinions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Mishna (Pesachim 2:6) lists 5 plants to use for Maror, and allows using their stems (using the leaves didn't even need to be specified). As with all species names, translating them is notoriously difficult. The first species, חזרת, is the ideal one according to the Gemara and it is some kind of lettuce. The third species, תמכא, according to most early Rishonim (such as Rashi, Arukh, and Rambam) is not horseradish. However, some later Rishonim (eg. Haghot Maymoniot, Agur) translate it as horseradish. These Rishonim all do not allow use of the root of a plant (and so is ruled in Shulchan Arukh OC 473:5), only the stem or leaves (in the words of Maharil \"what grows above the ground\"). (Indeed <a href=\"http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2011/04/should-you-really-eat-grated.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> is an old Haggadah that discusses using horseradish <em>leaves</em>.) Eventually Magen Avraham (17th century Poland) argued that large <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taproot\" rel=\"noreferrer\">taproots</a> should be considered as stems, not roots, and be acceptable for use. As noted elsewhere, horseradish taproot is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/79830/759\">barely considered edible</a> and it presents certain bracha challenges at the Seder.</p>\n\n<p>So, in order to get at horseradish root being Kosher, we need to accept the translation of תמכא as horseradish, accept that taproot are stems, and accept that raw horseradish is edible. Then you still have to force yourself to eat an olive's bulk of it, figure out what blessings to say when, and figure out <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/27205/759\">how to dip it in</a> and shake off the Charoset. And even then you won't have fulfilled the Mitzva in the best way since ideally you should use the first species listed which is חזרת. But add in a minority opinion that any bitter plant qualifies even if not on the list (see Rama 473:5), and if that's all you've got, then why not go for it? Indeed in many places (mostly northern Ashkenazi places) that's what they did.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays thanks to refrigeration there is lettuce readily available in most places. Do as your ancestors have always done and prefer that when it's available. (\"חזרת is preferable to תמכא... but in our lands we have to use תמכא since חזרת isn't available before Pesach\" -- Arukh haShulchan 473:13 about 120 years ago.)</p>\n\n<p>(Note the prohibition against eating bugs is <em>not</em> pushed aside by the obligation of eating Maror, so don't be extra lenient in checking the lettuce for bugs. But unless you never eat lettuce all year, you should be able to arrange to have lettuce the one time it's actually a Mitzva. Note the white ribs of romaine lettuce leaves are generally easier to check/clean than the thin green parts, and also are more voluminous.)</p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/tzarich_iyun_using_horseradish_for_maror/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> by R.

They then go on to discuss the parameters of \"zeh neheneh vizeh lo chaser\" (one party benefitting in a non-zero sum manner) as part of the principal of \"kofin all midas sedom\" (we can legally force people to take an action where their refusal is solely to deny the other party a benefit). </p>\n\n<p>Of the three opinions, Rabah applies it broadly (looking at strictly the market value of the field), Rav Yosef applies it to conceptual future benefits (that a specific part of the field may by chance get more or less water), and Rav Yehudah applies it to ancillary outcomes (that the hiring of additional workers for the separate fields brings a benefit to the other partners).

Perhaps it would tell us that although the women followed\n  the men in their inspired song, they were fully their equals in\n  expressing the whole deep meaning of the Song, and in realising the\n  high mission of the nation which is expressed thererein.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup><sub>Excerpted from the Judaica Press translation, second edition (Gateshead 1999)</sub></sup></p>\n\n<p>Given the difficulty in explaining the verse if ענה is used in the second, less common sense (besides Rav Hirsch's uncertainty), I think that the verse should be interpreted along the lines of Rav Hirsch's first explanation (especially since this verse directly follows the song of Moshe and Israel).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the Jewish philosopher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Philo of Alexandria</a>, who was a contemporary of the Jewish historian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Josephus</a>, and who both lived in the First Century and who both commented extensively on the history of the Jews, the understanding was that Miriam's chorus of women had simultaneously complemented the chorus of men, and so Miriam <strong><em>responded to them</em></strong>, that is, as the leader of the chorus of women, she <strong><em>responded to them</em></strong> [the chorus of the men led by Moses] while they [the men] were still singing.  Philo writes the following in regard to the passage in question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For this mercy Moses very naturally honoured his Benefactor with hymns of gratitude. For having divided the host into two choruses, one of men and one of women, he himself became the leader of that of the men, and appointed his sister to be the chief of that of the women, that they might sing hymns to their father and Creator, joining in harmonies responsive to one another, by a combination of dispositions and melody, the former being eager to offer the same requital for the mercies which they had received, and the latter consisting of a symphony of the deep male with the high female voices, for the tones of men are deep and those of women are high; <strong><em>and when there is a perfect and harmonious combination of the two</em></strong> a most delightful and thoroughly harmonious melody is effected. And he persuaded all those myriads of men and women to be of one mind, <strong><em>and to sing in concert the same hymn at the same time in praise</em></strong> of those marvellous and mighty works which they had beheld, and which I have been just now relating. At which the prophet rejoicing, and seeing also the exceeding joy of his nation, and being himself too unable to contain his delight, began the song. And they who heard him being divided into two choruses, sang with him, taking the words which he uttered. (emphases added)   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is remarkable is that Philo's commentary was not addressing the variant readings or ambiguous understandings of this passage, which is what we are trying to do today. Instead, his flowing narrative addresses this portion of the Torah with glib commentary that the male and female choruses had sung one with the other in complementary unison.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, while Targum Onkelos (its variant reading), the Septuagint, and even the Latin Vulgate read that Miriam answered them (feminine plural), the earliest extant record of this passage known to exist in the world comes the Dead Sea Scrolls fragment from <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uuwXD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4Q14 (Plate 1074, Frag 1, B-295437)</a>, which indicates that the Miriam answered them (masculine plural). In other words, this earliest witness from the Dead Sea Scrolls lends credibility that Miriam <strong><em>responded to them</em></strong> [masculine plural].</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/jtX9mm.png\" alt=\"This image is an enlarged view of the relevant passage from 4Q14, Plate 1074, Frag 1 (B-295437)\"></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong>   </p>\n\n<p>Yonge, C.

XXVI,20). Here they were not yet\n  making any reproaches, did not refer to their requirements, but as a\n  justified claim, demanded water. Where we camp, there must be water:\n  <strong>תנו לנו מים</strong> As the ן in תריבון and תנוסון stresses the second person, the retort runs: you know quite well that it is not I but\n  Hashem who has led you hither, and surely <em>you</em> have by now had\n  sufficient experience of Hashem to quietly trust to Him that here also\n  He will not let you die of thirst. In ordinary circumstances your\n  demand would be quite justified, but <em>you</em> etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9878/jewish/Chapter-17.htm#v=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beshalach 17:3</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּצְמָא שָׁם הָעָם לַמַּיִם וַיָּלֶן הָעָם עַל משֶׁה וַיֹּאמֶר\n  לָמָּה זֶּה הֶעֱלִיתָנוּ מִמִּצְרַיִם לְהָמִית אֹתִי וְאֶת בָּנַי\n  וְאֶת מִקְנַי בַּצָּמָא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But when the people thirsted ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that they still had water and manufactured an argument because new water was not waiting for them. Had they waited one more station, they would have arrived at Chorev and received the miraculous well of Miriam that was to provide them with water for the entire trip. Thus, the Torah uses the term for argument rather than recognition of a justified complaint.</p>\n\n\n",

But the Mishna Berura explains:<br>\n  ודוקא כשהיה השפה שהוציאה קשה ביותר ואינו נכפף אז חשוב כמו אהל ואי לא\"ה הרי הוא כגלימא בעלמא -  as long as the 1 tefach (handbreath) rim is not firm and it bends in and out of shape it can be worn on shabbos. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So too here the parachute is not firm even though it is larger surface than a square handbreath there is no issue of ohel.

The gemora in Eiruvin 100b deals with a similar issue and concludes that one may walk on grass with or without shoes; on wet short grass and dry; tall grass and short. The reason it is permitted is because the halacha is in accordance with R’ Shimon who holds that a דבר שאין מתכוין on Shabbos is permitted . The poskim add that this is on condition that:<br>\n1.It was not intended, over here you don't intend for to make the knot<br>\n2.It won't necessarily knot itself(לאו פסיק רישא)             </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So parachutes are permissible to be thrown by kids for pleasure as there is no intention to knot and it might not knot itself.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>מתיר- untying</strong><br>\nThe Shulchan Aruch and Rema@s explanation Orach Chaim 317,1 say:      \n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכל קשר של קיימא אפילו של הדיוט חייבין עליו   וכן לענין התרתו דינו כמו לענין קשירתו - Any permanent knot one makes would be liable even a novices knot, and so too with regard to untying.<br>\n  But if it is loose enough that one would normally untie it and carry on playing with the parachute, you can untie it.<br>\n  וקשר שאינו של קיימא ואינו מעשה אומן מותר לקשרו לכתחלה:\n  הגה: וכן לענין התרתו דינו כמו לענין קשירתו (טור - A nonpermanent knot and it is not an expert knot one can tie (e.g a tie) and so too with regards to untying.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So if it gets entangled in a way that one wouldn't untangle it because it is too tight and therefore a permanent knot then one should not untangle it rather leave it.</p>\n\n\n",

He is one who is the Master of all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>Ish milhama</em>, איש מלחמה, (hyper-literally translated as: 'man of war') is simply the Biblical word for warrior. The more intuitive forms of לוחם or מלחם which would refer to a warrior without employing the word איש; man, do not appear in the Bible. It therefore appears that the term is not meant to connote a male, or a mortal; it is simply the only term in the language, for a warrior.</p>\n<p>This term is often used on characters who are obviously male. E.g.

They are only descriptive terms, as [apparent from Deuteronomy 32:41]: \"I will whet My lightning sword.\" Does He have a sword? Does He need a sword to kill? Rather, this is metaphoric imagery. [Similarly,] all [such expressions] are metaphoric imagery.</p>\n\n<p>A proof of this concept: One prophet says that he saw the Holy One, blessed be He, \"clothed in snow white\" [Daniel 7:9], and another envisioned Him [coming] \"with crimson garments from Batzra\" [Isaiah 63:1]. Moses, our teacher, himself envisioned Him at the [Red] Sea as a mighty man, waging war, and, at Mount Sinai, [saw Him] as the leader of a congregation, wrapped [in a tallit].</p>\n\n<p>This shows that He has no image or form. All these are merely expressions of prophetic vision and imagery and the truth of this concept cannot be grasped or comprehended by human thought. This is what the verse [Job 11:7] states: \"Can you find the comprehension of God? Can you find the ultimate bounds of the Almighty?\"</p>\n\n<p>Since this is so, all such [descriptions] and the like which are related in the Torah and the words of the Prophets - all these are metaphors and imagery. [For example,] \"He who sits in the heavens shall laugh\" [Psalms 2:4], \"They angered Me with their emptiness\" [Deuteronomy 32:21], and \"As God rejoiced\" [ibid. 28:63]. With regard to all such statements, our Sages said: \"The Torah speaks in the language of man.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is [borne out by the rhetorical question (Jeremiah 7:19):] \"Are they enraging Me?\" Behold, [Malachi 3:6] states: \"I, God, have not changed.\" Now were He to at times be enraged and at times be happy, He would change. Rather, all these matters are found only with regard to the dark and low bodies, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is dust. In contrast, He, blessed be He, is elevated and exalted above all this.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sheva Brachos without Chosson?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Hypothetical situation: A Sheva Brachos meal is set up for the new couple. However, only the Kallah is there (for example, the Chosson is sick and the meal is right next door, so the Kallah can pop in without leaving the Chosson too far behind). There are 10 adult males there. Would there be some variation of a Sheva Brachos said during Bentching?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Yam Shel Shelomo (Kesuvos 1:20) writes that the brachos are primarily directed towards the chosson, and so if the bride is not present then they may still make all seven brachos, as long as the groom is there. The China v'Chisda on Kesubos (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6884&st=&pgnum=228\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vol. 1, p. 113b</a>) agrees, though he quotes the <strong>Ritva</strong> as holding that both the bride and groom must be present. He also quotes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/6886\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">later, vol. 3</a> p. 272b) from others that even if the groom was not present for some reason, but the meal was still prepared in honor of the couple, some say that Sheva Brachos can be made, and apparently that was the custom in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Salonica</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef in Yabia Omer 6:9:1-2 brings many sources (כדרכו) as to what to do in such a case, and concludes that the Shulchan Aruch appears to hold like the aforementioned Ritva. Therefore, both the bride and groom must at least participate in the meal, and although strictly speaking the bride can be in a different room, it is best for her to be brought in for the brachos (see also Yalkut Yosef Sova Semachos 1, 16:3, 16:8) </p>\n\n<p>Apparently such a case occurred in 19th Century <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikulov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nikolsburg</a>, where the groom left for a business trip into his Sheva Brachos week. This case is discussed in both Teshuvas Mahari Asad (no. 12) and Maharam Shik (no. 90), who both believe that Sheva Brachos should not be made in such a case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yes the Chatan is required. </p>\n\n<p><sup>\nShulchan Aruch Even Haezer 62, 7:</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote><sup> במה דברים אמורים, כשהיו האוכלים הם שעמדו בברכת הנשואין ושמעו הברכות, אבל אם היו האוכלים אחרים, ולא שמעו ברכת נשואין בשעת נשואין, מברכין בשבילם אחר ברכת המזון שבע ברכות, כדרך שמברכין בשעת נשואין, והוא שיהיו עשרה, וחתן מן המנין.‏</sup></blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>\nThe Choson needs to be present as one of the conditions that generate a duty of 7 bearchot after Birkat Hamazon. </sup></p>\n\n<p><sup>\nMay (may be only)  be that this is an explanation for an apparent redundancy in SA,  in Sayf 4 he said that the chatan is counted as one of the ten needed men, and here apparently he repeated this. But in the Birkat Hamazon the presence of the chatan is not obvious.  (see Chelkat Mechokek)</p>\n\n<p></sup></p>\n\n<p><strong>But the more probable answer</strong> is that  there  has no sense to make the Berachot without the chatan,  because there is no Simcha. The Gemara Ketubot 8b compare chatanim and mourners. I takes this as obvious that the chatan is required  and has only an hava amina to require ten men in addition to the  chatan (at least 11 counting the chatan as 11 counting the avel). E. g.  for the <strong>mourning blessing</strong> and the  <strong>shura</strong>.  The mourners are not counted and are obviously required. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי תניא ההיא בברכת המזון כי קאמר רבי יוחנן <em>בשורה</em>  ואלא הא דאמר רבי יצחק אמר רבי יוחנן מברכים ברכת חתנים בעשרה וחתנים מן המנין  <em>וברכת אבלים</em> בעשרה ואין אבלים מן המנין</p>\n  \n  <p>However, when Rabbi Yoḥanan says that mourners are not included in the tally, it is with regard to the quorum of ten men required to form <strong>a line to comfort the mourners following the burial</strong>. And the Gemara raises an objection: However, that which Rabbi Yitzḥak said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One recites the blessing of the grooms in a quorum of ten, and the grooms are included in the tally, and one recites <strong>the blessing of the mourners in a quorum of ten, and the mourners are not included in the tally.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The two possibilities are 10 + chatan or 10 including chatan. the lack of chatan is even not an hava amina.</p>\n\n\n",

What about modern day dreams and visions?</p>\n\n<p>I ask because historically the Septuagint was considered a very popular and important translation (into Greek), and as I understand it, the majority of Jews at the time of Jesus were reading the Septuagint rather than the Hebrew scriptures, (with the exception of some liturgical readings in the synagogues). I'm wondering how Jews today would regard the Septuagint as it is a translation, not the original Hebrew?</p>\n\n<p>And how do Jews regard the thousands of Christian translations into every major language today? Could a modern Jew pick up the NIV bible and say \"God speaks through this book\" (of course he would have to tear out the New Testament first)?</p>\n\n<p>To clarify my preconceptions as a Christian: In the Christian world, it is believed that when you read the bible God is actually talking to you. Some Christians take this to mean that every word on the page is literally \"breathed-out\" from God's mouth, and therefore every word is important and only the scriptures in the original languages are truly \"God's word\". While others believe that it is the <em>message</em> which is \"inspired\" by God, but not so much the individual words, and therefore translations from the original Hebrew can be considered just as much \"word of God\" as the original texts, just so long as they convey the same message.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>G-d does not \"speak\" through translations. The concept of G-d speaking the way you describe it as a sort of semi-prophecy is not a Jewish concept. Instead, one is learning part of the overall message of G-d, but to truly understand it one must study the message in its entirety. While there can be a divine providence in which verses one sees when, we also believe there is divine providence in every aspect of life as well.</p>\n<p>In fact, relying on translations is a poor substitute for the original text. The only exceptions are the translations of Onkelos to the Pentateuch and Yonasan ben Uziel to the Prophets, which are based on the tradition of interpretation going back to Moses in the former case and the prophets in the latter. Christian translations are not reliable because they view the scriptures through  a lens we don't accept.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>\"Some Christians take this to mean that every word on the page is literally \"breathed-out\" from God's mouth, and therefore every word is important and only the scriptures in the original languages are truly \"God's word\".\"</p>\n<p>This sounds very anthropomorphic and reminds me of the Akivian methodology which suggests that every letter is inherently speaking. I agree with Rabbi Ishmael that “the Torah (which is intended for humans) speaks in human language.”</p>\n<p>Regarding translations, Rashi states that the Aramaic Translation called Onkelos was “from Heaven,” when he later explained that Onkelos wrote it. He meant that the translation was so significant that it was as if it was “from Heaven.” Similarly, some Jews may say that G-d \"metaphorically\" speaks to them through the pages of the Bible, but by no means suggest that G-d is actually talking to them through the Bible in the sense that you ask. Not to mention that Jews do not live by the Bible but by the talmudic interpretation of the Bible by the rabbis.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What is the Jewish attitude towards heretics and other religions?",
    "content": "# What is the Jewish attitude towards heretics and other religions?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Christianity, the general atmosphere is \"Heretics and members of other religions are all completely wrong, and they are all going to Hell unless they repent and accept the Truth as we define it\". As such I find that Christians are very hostile and antagonistic towards other faiths. (Lest anyone think that I'm blasting Christianity, I am Christian myself and am engaging in self-criticism). Eg if you mention Hinduism to a Christian, they'll likely respond with something like \"They are polytheists! Polytheism is strongly condemned in the bible! Have nothing to do with Hindus or Hinduism unless you are trying to evangelise them.\"</p>\n\n<p>Once I went on a short-term Christian mission trip to China, and most of the members of the team were very pessimistic about the native Chinese religion. Again, polytheism was a prominent feature of the local religion and the attitude of the team towards this was total condemnation, disapproval and even sadness because \"those people are probably going to Hell unless they accept Christ and renounce their polytheistic ways\".</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious what the Jewish attitude is in this respect? I get the impression that Jews sorta just take the attitude \"This is what we believe, that is what they believe. We aren't concerned with what other groups believe. They can believe whatever they want as long as they leave us alone to practice our Judaism in peace. If they follow the 7 Noahide laws then that's great! But in general we don't concern ourselves with gentile religions.\"</p>\n\n<p>I feel like this is the case because I've heard that there are really good relations between Israel and India, and that there is a very old community of Jews living in India who have been there for ages, and that they have never been persecuted. I suspect that none of this would be possible if Jews were constantly picking fights with the Hindus on account of their polytheism.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that Jews just keep to themselves and try to live devout lives without going out of their way to condemn other religions.</p>\n\n<p>So for my actual question: What is the Jewish attitude towards other religions? For a concrete example, how do Jews react to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity? Do Jews generally find Christianity and the Trinity deeply offensive? Or do you just laugh it off and go \"those poor Christians get it so so wrong\".</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I know it's been years and only one answer has been received, but better late than never.</p>\n<p>The attitude toward other religions varies from individual and group to group, but, strictly speaking, it \"should\" be positive under typical circumstances. One marked difference between Christianity and Judaism is, as you note, whether you <em>must</em> be of that religion to go to the World to Come. In Judaism, there are believed to be righteous of all nations, and all the righteous of all nations have a place in the World to Come. As a consequence of this, it's highly frowned upon to try and convince other people to convert, and in fact it is traditional to turn someone away and telling them to study such-and-such when they ask, only progressing with a conversion if they return several times. (My understanding is that traditions vary).</p>\n<p>Specifically, a gentile is expected to follow the Noahide Laws, a series of seven laws given to the sons of Noah (note that, since Noah and his family composed all of humanity at one point, the sons of Noah means all humans. Jews, also being sons of Noah, are expected to follow them too, but these essentially come as part of the wider package of the 613 mitzvos for Jews). Technically, these are seven <em>categories</em> of laws, not individual rulings, so in truth there's more than 7. I don't know whether someone who fulfills all of these goes to the World to Come from this alone, or if there are other expectations on top of that, but I do know that it's better to be a Noahide-law-observing gentile than an unobservant Jew (thus why it's common to make conversions hard - it's for the other person's sake). The laws are as follows (citing Wikipedia since I don't have them memorized):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not commit Avodah Zarah (that is, idol worship)</li>\n<li>Do not curse Hashem</li>\n<li>Do not murder</li>\n<li>Do not commit sexually immoral acts (ie incest)</li>\n<li>Do not steal</li>\n<li>Do not eat flesh from living animals</li>\n<li>Establish a court of law which enforces the above</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Categories 3, 5, and 7 are generally fulfilled seen as a baseline for human behavior in most societies today - it's not a super high bar in that regard. Avoiding sexually immoral acts also is pretty much done by every group I know of, except that things such as (some but not all instances of) polyamory and homosexuality would fall under this as well as the more obvious rape or incest - that's a discussion for another time. Category 6 is pretty well covered too, with the only foodstuff I know of that violates this being the rocky mountain oyster which is often taken from a live bull, but these really aren't common and most people I have talked to wouldn't eat one.</p>\n<p>Not worshiping idols or cursing Hashem is complicated, because what counts as idol worship is not always obvious. You don't see many people doing ritual sacrifices to Moloch anymore, to be sure, but I would argue that phone and Facebook addiction is a form of idol worship and that the vain pursuit of money is worship of the dollar. I would not call those who are Facebook junkies in blatant violation of what this law is really requesting, though. What about Buddhism? Buddhists may have statues of Buddha, but they aren't generally the subject of worship. What about Christianity? Rambam says that the trinity constitutes a form of polytheism and thus Catholics are idol worshipers, but not everyone agrees. I've also heard that worship of idols itself is not the problem being discussed, but amoral acts in the service of such (ie child sacrifice), so even Moloch worshipers might pass this law as long as their sons aren't aflame on the altar. Saying \"God dammit\" is also generally not the concern - that's not what is meant by cursing. Thus, it's hard to say exactly who is and is not following this law for sure, but the law isn't asking for the moon.</p>\n<p>So, ultimately, the Jewish perspective is that other nations are perfectly fine, as long as they pass these requirements - I generally call these the \"decent person test\", as they're pretty much asking if the person isn't committing grave and obvious sins in their day to day life. That's certainly a lower bar than Christianity. That's on paper, however, and the opinion of individuals or groups is going to vary quite a lot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To my knowledge, Judaism is the only religion that has a pathway to Salvation for non-members (non-Jews) too.</p>\n\n<p>It's not my way, or a \"lake of fire\", \"eternal damnation\", or \"death to the infidel\".</p>\n\n<p>According to Judaism, God is the Savior of ALL mankind, and all of humanity can be \"saved\", by following His commands.</p>\n\n<p>According to Judaism, the mission of non-Jews, is to keep the seven Noahide laws. </p>\n\n<p>Those who accept the yoke of God, as it pertains to them, are referred to as Righteous Gentiles</p>\n\n<p>If someone sins, he can repent to God, and they will be forgiven.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, idolatry is not tolerated from anyone. God not only has a message of love, he also has a message of anger (at those who disobey His Law, or those who hurt His people), and jealousy (at those who worship others other than Him).</p>\n\n\n",

So if you are only trying to cite that phrase, you could say כריתות ו:ב ד״ה ת״ר היו מחזירין which would put you at the spot on the page. </p>\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi Yoma, chapter 4, halacha 5 in the Gemarra brings the added idea that the sound of the voice is good for the preparation in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>\n\n<p>That detail is brought in Bavli in the name of Mar from the support of Rabbi Yochanan.</p>\n\n<p>For what it's worth, I don't see any source (Bavli, Yerushalmi or Midrashim) other than the siddur which actually cites <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avot_of_Rabbi_Natan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Natan</a> with this statement. That could suggest that either it was a variant text which ultimately wasn't used in Mishah and Gemarra or that there is a halachic midrash that no longer exists. A search of the Tosefta also comes up empty. As is known from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Horayot.13b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horayot 13b</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_the_Babylonian\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Natan's name</a> was to a large extent removed from the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of interesting discoveries are that the Siddur of Rav Amram Gaon does not require the recital of the Ketoret at all in connection with the recital of the Korbanot. It follows what is found in the Avudraham that the Tamid is required and then the recital of <em>Eizehu Makomen</em> from Zevachim 85, followed by the baraita of Rabbi Yishmael from the beginning of Sifra. Amram Gaon includes recital of ketoret at the conclusion of shacharit and arvit but only in remembrance of the Temple. And the text he uses mentions הדק only in connection with the double grinding for Yom Kippur. There is no mention of the beneficial relationship between the voice and the spices.</p>\n\n<p>The exact text including the citation of it being said in the name Rabbi Natan is found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39241&st=&pgnum=337\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Avodat HaKodesh by Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabbai, section 4 (Sitrei Torah), chapter 19</a> with the words beginning, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39241&st=&pgnum=344\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"בעמדם תרפינה כנפיהם\"</a>. I haven't had a chance to review the chapter but it begins by talking about traditions that were only passed down to the select individuals (in his words בני עליה). Rabbi Meir is a recognized early authority in kabbalah from Spain, born before the Spanish expulsion. He introduces the idea that the current exile was the consequence of violating several covenants, one of which was ceasing to follow the path indicated <em>above</em>. This has an implication about the kavanot associated with prayer. He points out that this is in addition to violating the path <em>below</em>, which means the mitzvot outlined in the Mishnah.</p>\n\n<p>This indicates that a variant text was present at least among the kabbalists of Spain shortly after the Gaonim and was included in most of the later siddurim.</p>\n\n<p>One of the interesting details to note about this is that this is supported by the work of Rabbi Avraham Katsch z\"l, who headed Dropsie College in America. In the 1940s and 1950s, Katsch worked to try to recover many of the one of a kind, hand-written manuscripts and fragments which were in the Guensberg collection in St. Petersburg in Russia. Many of these were collected from Sephardic Jewish communities and genizas across Europe and they contained variant texts to the Mishnah not found in the Tosefta or Mechilta, and very old kabbalistic material including from Rabbi Yitzchok of Akko.</p>\n\n<p>The Baladi nusach of the Temani Jews, which is the older practice,  does not recite the ketoret for shacharit. But they do recite the ketoret before mincha and the version of their text does not include section on הדק היטב היטב הדק.</p>\n\n<p>As a matter of context, the teaching of the ketoret was, according to tradition, given by the Angel of Death to Moshe Rabbeinu. It was used by Aharon, Kohen Gadol to stop the plague that resulted from the actions of Kozbi and Zimri.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Koren's PR department got the following response for me from Rabbi David Fuchs, one of Koren's liturgy experts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The part from “אחת לשישים או לשבעים שנה” is a summary of the Gemara, and no longer a direct quote. It comes from the continuation of the sugya, on 6b:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/q7h38.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/q7h38.png\" alt=\"Image of the sugya with relevant passages highlighted\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the meaning of the passage <em>is</em> on 6b, continuing the sugya referring to the line on 6a, and R. Fuchs explains that the version in the siddur is a condensed summary. It sounds like I should cite the siddur, then, with a reference to this Gemara.</p>\n\n\n",

This last part explains Reb Elozor ben Azariyah's relationship to the understanding of Ben Zoma.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The comment of Rambam is divided in two  parts.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><h3>FIRST PART: The mention of the Exodus is made by recitation of Parashat Tsitsit, the sources of Rambam.</h3>\n\n<p>The third parasha of our Kriat Shema is Vayomer. It contains among others two topics: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>mitsvat Tsitsit, which is linked to day clothes</li>\n<li>mention of the Exodus.\nGenerally this parasha is called by chachamim parshat tsitsit, despite that the Mishna in the second chapter calls it Vayomer according to the first word of this parasha. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Rambam, as Rashi, taught us that the mention of the Exodus which is a mitsva min Hatora for every opinion at day and for R.E.B.A. and Ben Zoma is made by reciting <strong>parshat tsitsit</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>But there is a Gemara in Berachot (21a) which seems to contradict the pshat of the Rambam in Mishna.  The Gemara addresses an opinion following which the recitation of the specific texts of Shema Israel is not needed by the Torah, the duty comprise divre Tora without distinction; Chachamim have established a derabanan duty to read shema even if we already did read some else divre Tora. But there is a specific mitsva from Tora to mention the Exodus (at least in morning).It follows that if someone has already read a Tora portion and has a doubt if he did read Shema he is exempt from repeating it (following the rule of safek deorayta lakula). But if he has a doubt if he did mention the Exodus,  he is in duty to repeat it (following the rule of safek deorayta lachumra) here are the words of the Gemara:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב יהודה ספק קרא קריאת שמע ספק לא   קרא אינו חוזר וקורא ספק אמר אמת ויציב ספק לא אמר חוזר ואומר אמת ויציב מאי טעמא קריאת שמע דרבנן אמת ויציב דאורייתא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You see that <em>the Gemara calls the mention of the Exodus (for day hours) \"Emet veyatsiv\"</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi says that the duty of mentioning the Exodus is,  as our Mishna taught, the verse lemaan tizkor et tsetecha meerets mitsrayim kol yeme chayecha: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ק''ש דרבנן. לקמן פריך לה: אמת ויציב דאורייתא היא. שמזכיר בה יציאת מצרים דחיובא דאורייתא היא דכתיב למען תזכר את יום צאתך מארץ מצרים (דברים טז):‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is quite amazing, why Rashi himself said on our Mishna that the mention of the Exodus is parshat tsitsit. He should have said instead Emet veyatsiv and Emet veemuna. </p>\n\n<p>Even more amazing is this Gemara itself. We have a mishna preceding this Gemara stated that the Baal Keri needs to read mentally (without mouth pronunciation) Kriat Shema but not Berachot. According to this Gemara he should have to read Emet veyatsiv rather than Keriat Shema. </p>\n\n<p>The rav Rabenu Shim'on cited in Tosfot answers that Emet veyatsiv is an name for the mention of the Exodus, because Emet veyatsiv is a special passage which comes for mentioning yetsiat mitsrayim only. \nSo,  from the Mishna of baal keri we did learn that the mention of the Exodus is mainly made by parashat tsitsit. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a passage of Tosfot: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הר''ר שמעון דמיירי שפיר שאינו מסופק אלא מאמת ויציב אבל ברור הוא שקרא ק''ש ואפילו הכי הוי אמת ויציב דאורייתא שר''ל ספק לא אמר אמת ויציב עם פרשת ציצית שמסופק אי לא אמר לא פרשת ציצית ולא אמת ויציב ואם כן לא הזכיר כלל יציאת מצרים וכולה מילתא דיציאת מצרים קרי ליה אמת ויציב לפי דטעם אמת ויציב הוי משום יציאת מצרים והלכך הוי פרשת ציצית בכלל אמת ויציב:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara says in 14b (according to the lecture of Rashi),  that  <em>if he did not say parshat tsitsit,  he needs no say emet (veyatsiv)</em>. The Gemara maksha that he needs to mention the Exodus, and answers that there is a special Beracha to replace emet veyatsiv and which mention the Exodus. We see the beracha emet veyatsiv doesn't exist without parashat tsitsit. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the text:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייא בר רב אמר אמר אני ה' אלהיכם צריך לומר אמת לא אמר אני ה' אלהיכם אינו צ''ל אמת והא בעי לאדכורי יציאת מצרים דאמר הכי מודים אנחנו לך ה' אלהינו שהוצאתנו מארץ מצרים ופדיתנו מבית עבדים ועשית לנו נסים וגבורות על הים ושרנו לך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this explains, says the Rambam,  our custom to say parshat tsitsit at night which is not linked to the verse regarding tsitsit which talks about seeing them (at daylight). </p></li>\n<li><h2>SECOND PART: The signification of the apparent old age of R.E.B.A.</h2>\n\n<p>part of the Rambam's comments is agadic. He explains the expression \"I am as a 70 old man. He explains that this precocious apparent old age was a consequence of an overactivity in Tora learning. This Tora intensive learning had a second result,  a great knowledge and experience regarding Tora. So R.E.B.A. was amazing about the fact that he was not able to find a proof for this halacha this  in  verses, when Ben Zoma who was less experimented did reach a proof from a verse. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

According to her, this was an infringement of the prohibition of placing a stumbling block before the blind, and the rabbonim uphold her decision.</p>\n\n<p>According to Rashi, the reason that striking one's adult son is a prohibition of this principle is that doing so might cause him to retaliate, and then he will be guilty of striking his own father (a crime, incidentally, that depending on whether or not it causes injury might incur the death penalty). But this seems odd.</p>\n\n<p>Granted: a person shouldn't hit their adult children anyway (they shouldn't hit people at all, for that matter), but is the reason really because otherwise their might retaliate?? Following that logic, does this mean that a rebbi should never chastise his students for fear that they might be guilty of answering back? If the halakha demands punitive measure of some description, why should we be concerned about retaliation?</p>\n\n\n",

This is however only the connection from spiritual\n  with physical regarding physical <em>things</em>, and only at the time of\n  doing {a particular mitzvah, he means that when we do a Mitzvah after\n  the giving of the Torah then during the performance of the Mitzvah\n  there is a connection of physical and spiritual, but only then}.\n  However, parshas Terumah speaks about \"And make for me a sanctuary and\n  I will dwell in them\" -- the connection from the upper with the lower\n  not only in Mitzvos {and in the time of doing Mitzvos}; rather, also\n  with \"permitted things\", \"you should know him with all of your ways\".\" \n  {as explained earlier in the sicha}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So <strong>THEN</strong> he goes on to explain <strong><em>the main meaning of the order</em></strong> of the parshios:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"This is also the general order of the parshios that are in Sefer\n  Shemos, {they are in a way of} from lower to higher {from a lower level to a higher one}: in the first parshios, it's told over about\n  the entire order of: the exile of Egypt ,\n  then the <strong>exodus</strong> from Egypt, which was all a <strong>precursor</strong> and\n  a <strong>preparation</strong> to the giving of the Torah; afterwards, (in parshos\n  Yisro and {even} parshas Mishpatim), the idea \n  and accomplishment of the giving of the\n  Torah {which he explained elsewhere that in Mishpatim there was the completion of the covenant between Hashem and the Jewish people since they had the blood sprinkled on them etc..}, which is the combination of spiritual with <strong>Mitzvos</strong> in\n  physicallity, and after this <strong><em>from parshas Terumah until the end of\n  the book of Shemos</em></strong> is the idea of \"and you should know him in all\n  of your ways\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the very last point he said, that from Terumah until the end of Shemos, he explains each parsha individually in note 43:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"And also in <strong>these</strong> parshios themselves, the order is from \"below\"\n  to \"above\" {meaning from a lower level to a higher level}: in parshas\n  Terumah and Tetzaveh, is the idea of the Mishkan that Moshe\n  <strong>commanded</strong> be built {but not in actuality yet}, from the <em>command</em> of Hashem {only}, and in parshas Vayakheil Pikudei, it talks about the\n  <strong>actual / physical</strong> Mishkan that the people of Yisroel actually made down here {in this world -- not just in potential}, and in <strong>this</strong>\n  Mishkan {I guess maybe referring to the physical Mishkan as opposed to\n  it's spiritual counterpart alluded to in the \"command\" from Hashem to\n  Moshe}, was completed the {inner} intention {of Hashem} to have \"a\n  dwelling place in the lower realms\", {which that means that this\n  physical Mishkan represents the} <strong>most high level possible</strong> -- {at\n  the end of Shemos}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So basically, even though the Parshas aren't in <em>chronological</em> order, but they are organized in the order of the Jewish people getting closer and closer to Hashem. Interesting, in the above explanation from Likutei Sichos (which everyone should look up in the original BTW, again Cheilek Gimel Os Zayein - volume 3 section 7), the only parsha he doesn't mention is this one -- Tisa!!!! I was thinking how that can fit in to being part of the Jewish people getting closer to Hashem, and I was thinking that possibly it refers to the level of Teshuva, but I still wonder why he didn't mention it.</p>\n\n<p>SO that's the general idea of why the parshios are ordered the way they are, for each specific event, it talks about it throughout Likutei Sichos, I guess you'll just have to learn the whole thing to find out all of them :)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does the gemara of \"everything is for the best\" make sense?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemara in Brachos daf 60b recounts how while traveling, R Akiva was refused lodging in a certain town. He said \"everything which Hashem does is for the good\" and went to sleep outside of town. A series of misfortunes happened to him (his rooster and donkey were killed and his lamp went out) to which R Akiva said every time \"everything which Hashem does is for the good\". It turned out that that night an enemy army came to town and took all the townsfolk prisoner.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, that if R Akiva's definition of \"good\" is that he was not taken prisoner, then how can EVERYTHING be good, seeing that the towns people WERE taken prisoner! And if one would reply that for them - for whatever reason - that was the best (and thus \"good\"), then R Akiva's not being taken prisoner is not a proof that Hashem does everything for the good, because if R Akiva would also have been taken prisoner, then that would have been \"good\" for him...?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>from a human(olam hazeh) perspective , not being taken prisoner is good . Hashem brought this result about through him losing his animals, and flame, but that was better then the alternative and therefor was for his apparent good. This is the lesson of the gemara that anything which happens Hashem is orchestrating for our ultimate advantage and RAbbi AKiva got to see this advantage immediately and obviously, after reassuring himself when things appeared to be bad. Although had HAshem decreed that he would have also been taken prisoner that would have also been for his ultimate good, it would not have been as obvious and immediate of a lesson.      </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I feel that I understand what you're asking. You're asking, isn't R' Akiva's statement trivial, because it does not rule anything out? If this happens, then this is for the best, and if that happens, then that is for the best. But anything can still happen.</p>\n\n<p>You're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.</p>\n\n<p>Some children struggle in childhood with the perception that our hopes are often disappointed. And sometimes they progress to a child's faith: although lots of hopes are disappointed, our most important hopes in life will be realized. We sometimes try to encourage this child's faith at bedtime.</p>\n\n<p>On the day the rooster died, Rabbi Akiva observed that things always go our way. Misfortune doesn’t disprove this. Anyone in his position might have been sad about his losses until he discovered that those supposed misfortunes were hugely advantageous to him. If he had instead survived that day by 100 years and died without ever learning that the town had been captured on that day, he might have remembered the day begrudgingly as the day when he received less than he deserved; but that is only possible for any of us because we remain ignorant of the good in everything that happens. Instead he did learn of the town; but unlike many people he reflected on the fact that for that event and for every event there are limitless consequences of which no person can ever become aware. In other words, the lesson was not just that the best course sometimes contains some costs; the lesson is that if we knew the truth we would not consider the costs to be costs at all. But we never know the truth.</p>\n\n<p>If the people of the town died before they discovered how their own deaths were for the good, that does not distinguish them from the imagined Akiva (who never learned about the town), or from most of us who live and die without understanding the good in all of the things that seem so terribly sad about life. The only important difference is in our ability to imagine that this is so.</p>\n\n<p>I know a family whose life unfolded in such a way that looking back on it, I am sure that it would have been better if one of their number had died years ago. But if that person had in fact died, then of course nobody would have been in the position to understand how this death was for the good of all concerned, including the good of the decedent. Instead, the surviving members of that family would have been emotionally devastated by the death, suffering terrible pain and terrible doubts about providence. That is the position which we have put G-d in: he must treat us with such gentleness or harshness as He knows best for us, given that we differ in our trust in him and our consequent ability to accept harshness. Because this family could not have accepted the death which would actually have been for the good, they instead saw the consequences of their lack of faith. The distinction in R’ Akiva is that he understood this.</p>\n\n<p>I am a privileged member of a privileged society. I've known only peace and prosperity, and health and education receive more public support than most societies could have dreamed of. Yet I have a friend whose child died in her grade-school years. I have two friends who fled their burning homes; in one case the house was completely lost. I have friends whose children have profound handicaps, friends who have been victims of crimes, and so on. So I suspect that not many adults at any time in history entertained a child's faith. But some of us, including Rabbi Akiva, have entertained the faith of an adult.</p>\n\n<p>Consider Rabbi Akiva's story. He saw thousands of his students die (Gen Rabbah 61:03, Ecclesiastes Rabbah 11:01, Yevamos 62b3). Then many of his colleagues were brutally killed during the savage Roman persecution of the Rabbis, the martyrs recalled in the Tisha Be'Av service (in Kinna 21), in the Yom Kippur service (in Eileh Ezkra, on p. 266 in Chabad's new bilingual edition), in Sanhedrin 11a3 #29 to 31, and in various other places. As Rabbi Eli'ezer had warned (Sanhedrin 68a1, cf. Pesachim 69a2), Akiva's death would be especially terrible (Berachos 61b, Yerushalmi Berachos 93b3 in the ArtScroll English edition).</p>\n\n<p>And as they were combing R' Akiva's flesh with iron combs, he recited Shema.</p>\n\n<p>So you ask: Does Rabbi Akiva's statement rule anything out?\nAnd I answer: only despair.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As @DoubleAA rightly commented, Rabbi `Aqiva's outlook was characterized by justifying G-d or, as 18th-century German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz called it, \"theodicy\" (lit. justifying G-d).</p>\n\n<p>Rabb'einu Bahya ben Yoseph ibn Paquda also urges this approach in his Hovot HaLevavot (in Sha`ar `Avodat HaEloqim IIRC), i.e. that one should strive to justify G-d's actions or give Him the \"benefit of the doubt\" in modern parlance.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it's certainly logically consistent that <em>both</em> Rabbi `Aqiva being saved <em>and</em> the townspeople being conquered were, in fact, for the (ultimate) good.</p>\n\n\n",

But this answer needs an introduction.</p>\n<p>Many Rishonim and Acharonim Commentators addresses the question, the following words of the Keli Yakar may help to answer this question and to understand further  the answer of the Mechilta. Here is a stuff of the Keli Yakar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי היה להם לומר סתם כן נעשה אלא שאמרו כל אשר דבר ה' למעט דברי משה, גם רמזו באמרם כל אשר דבר ה' נעשה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There was no next words of the people which were hidden by the Tora. The verse 9 does only explain the verse 8.</p>\n<p>G-d expected  Moses to act as an intermediary,  and Moses anticipated the refusal of Israel  making  a diuk from the previous  answer written in the verse 8. In the verse 8, \"כֹּ֛ל אֲשֶׁר-דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֹ֖ה נַֽעֲשֶׂ֑ה \". We agree to make every thing that G-d said. From the formulation they did not say simply \"we will make this\".  Here is a diuk: \"ולא מה שתדבר אתה\"  \"but not what <em>you</em> would say\".    Actually the fact that Moses did make this  diuk is written in the verse 9   \"'וַיַּגֵּ֥ד מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶת-דִּבְרֵ֥י הָעָ֖ם אֶל-ה\".  The verse  reported the fragment of the diuk by paraphrasing the fragment of sentence    \"אשר דיבר ה'\" in a clearer way \"אל ה\".</p>\n<p>So,  there is no new dialog which was hidden,  but verse 9 contains a comment of Moses  regarding  the previous dialog between him  and Israel.</p>\n<p>And now we can read more  pshatic the answer of the Mechilta:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא אמרו, רצוננו לשמוע מפי מלכנו, לא דומה שומע מפי פרגוד לשומע מפי המלך</p>\n<p>Moses said  \"They said: Our wish is to listening from our King (G-d). To listening from the emissary is not similar as to listening from the King\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope that it makes sense. Without the question it is quite impossible to understand this Mechilta.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that the ויגד that we have in 13:9 is actually a repetition of what the people had said in 13:8 and that Moshe was suggesting that the people had already accepted everything that Hashem wanted them to do. Thus, he did not need to go to them and repeat the same commands. Hashem then emphasized in 13:10 that Moshe did indeed need to go back to the people and have them get ready.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates 13:9 as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Hashem said to Moses: Lo, I come unto thee in a thickening of the\n  cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with thee and so they\n  will have faith in thee too forever. And Moses <strong>held out</strong> the words\n  of the people unto Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch then explains his unusual translation of ויגד:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וייגד</strong> As we have already been told in V.8 that Moses had brought the reply of the people back to Hashem, this ויגד here can only be a\n  repetition of that reply. With this repetition of the words of the\n  people Moses wanted to suggest, that, as the people had already\n  completely and unanimously declared themselves ready to carry out\n  everything that Hashem would command them, and thereby also proclaimed\n  their complete confidence in Moses as the transmitter of those\n  commands, such an overwhelming revelation might possibly not be\n  necessary to establish and ensure this confidence. Hence we have dared to\n  translate this ויגד as to hold out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The basic premise was that each \"contestant\" would contribute $10 to compete, and the winner(s) would take home the pot.</p>\n\n<p>However, he was told that one of the rabbis of the school protested, on the basis that this was gambling. He has since asked the rabbi, who allowed the program to continue so long as there is no \"buy-in,\" and the school is now funding the prize.</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious about the reasoning behind that decision. <strong>How might <em>TBL</em> be considered gambling? Why does the lack of a buy-in change anything?</strong></p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.bvkkosher.com/gambling\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Moshe Taub</a>, there are two main issues in gambling in Jewish law. There is \"<em>Yishuv Olam</em>,\" which only applies if the gambler makes his livelihood from gambling. That is clearly not an issue here.<br>\nThe other issue is \"<em>asmachta</em>,\" which is used here to refer to the possibility of theft in gambling, because a person who puts down money doesn't really let go of it, so the winner might effectively steal the money from his fellow. It seems to me (though I may be wrong) that this might only forbid games of chance to be forbidden, because a contestant has no control over the outcome. Should there be a difference when contestant <em>does</em> have some control over the outcome?  </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, my friend argued that many people will likely join the competition without at all expecting to win -- he claims that many (if not most) of the contestants join the program because it provides some motivation to work a little harder on their weight loss, without even trying to win.</p>\n\n<p>If, in fact, the <em>TBL</em> game is forbidden because of gambling, would the ruling change if the overseers of the program provided services (eg nutrition advice, health coaching, gym membership) in exchange for the entry fee? If they did that, then maybe the contestants would completely give away their entry fee, negating the concern of <em>asmachta</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

(Our discussion will involve a few more sentences, Exodus 31:13 to 17.) Rabbi Avudirham <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26840&st=&pgnum=89\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discusses</a> this section of the prayer. He notes (in my own translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They instituted the recital of “Moshe rejoiced” on Shabbos because of\n  the first chapter of Tractate Shabbos (10b) [quoting Ex. 31:13]: “To\n  make known that I HaShem have sanctified you.” The Holy One Blessed Be\n  He said to Moshe, “I have a good gift in my treasury, called\n  ‘Shabbos,’ and I want to give it to Israel. Go let them know.” That’s\n  why they instituted [this section -- to make known] that Moshe\n  rejoiced in this good gift of Shabbos that was put into his hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The gemara that R’ Avudirham mentions (Shabbos 10b, like the similar statement at Beitza 16a2) discusses the proper way to give gifts. It refers to a couple of consecutive sentences of Exodus Ch. 31, including 31:13 which R’ Avudirham quotes in turn, to illustrate that when you give a gift you should let the recipient know, just as Hashem caused Moshe's face to shine when giving the Luchois to him and to the Jewish people to make known that HaShem has sanctified us. For example, when feeding a friend’s child in the absence of the parents, one might put cosmetics on his face so that his parents will ask him to explain what happened (a strange example to us, but apparently a familiar one to them).</p>\n\n<p>The flow of thought in Ex. 31 and the gemara are somewhat like that in these two paragraphs of the siddur. Moshe rejoiced in the gift of his portion, and You [haShem] placed a crown of splendor on Moshe’s head [the radiance of his face] and gave him the tables. So (assuming that the gemara predates this prayer) I would suggest that the author of the prayer was resonating this gemara obliquely.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, despite the placement of the words Vechein Kosuv Besoirasecha, the passage is not cited to prove that Shabbos is commanded on the Luchois. It is rather meant to connect us to this sublime thought of the sages. The radiance of Moshe’s face reminded his generation that Shabbos is a beautiful gift to the Jewish people, and by recalling this exposition we are ourselves reminded that Shabbos is a beautiful gift to the Jewish people. The siddur then proceeds to cite a commandment to observe Shabbos from this same context, Exodus Ch. 31.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Zachor is of course part of the Ten Commandments. <a href=\"https://www.torahweb.org/torah/2010/parsha/rsch_vaeschanan.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Hershel Shachter</a> in his article on the Ten Commandments writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the second Bais Hamikdash, the practice was to recite the aseres\n  hadibros each morning at the conclusion of shacharis.

One of the\n  great Hungarian gedolim of the last century wrote that he thinks that\n  this must have been introduced by the Reform movement. <strong>Orthodox\n  practice is that we don't place more significance to the aseres\n  ha'dibros than to the rest of the Torah.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suggest that this is why the Amidah studiously avoids quoting Zachor. To have Zachor as part of the Shabbos day Shemoneh Esrei would have given it considerable importance. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the meaning behind the word \"House\" when we call the Jews \"The House of Israel\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>The House of Israel</strong> is a phrase which gets repeated often but I never get many people explaining the small details behind the name.</p>\n\n<p>The Jewish people are called the \"House\" of Israel. Is there a deeper meaning behind why we use the word \"House\" or is it simply the closest word we were able to find in the english language?</p>\n\n<p>I've had people say that it's a phrase used to simply explain the Jews are from the line of Jacob. \"The House of Israel\" being a phrase to denote a familial line. The only reason I question that determination is that there are other examples of language being used to describe familial lines in the Torah. So this specific phrasing makes me wonder if there's a deeper meaning behind it.</p>\n\n<p>Everything in the Torah tends to be extremely deliberate, so I always had this belief that there was a deeper concept behind why we refer to the Jewish people as the \"House\" of Israel.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Throughout Tanac\"h as well as Rabbinic literature, we see (some form of) the word בית to mean \"family\", and not a physical house. Some examples:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=460\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishit 36:6</a> uses the phrase נפשות ביתו meaning \"souls of his house\". A physical house has no living \"souls\". Also, I highly doubt that Esav moved his physical house. There were no tractor-trailers, then! It means \"family\", here.</p>\n\n<p>In one of the prayers we say:</p>\n\n<p>אחינו כל בית ישראל - Our brothers (from) all the house of Israel. Other than the <em>Bet Hamikdash</em>, I don't know of any physical house that can contain every Jew. It means, \"family\", here, also.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The house has always taken on a crucial role in the development of the nation. We specifically needed to remain in our houses to eat the pesach and the 'house' of the nation (women, see rashi on  Shemos (19:3), are addressed first when giving the torah. </p>\n\n<p>As this article quotes Rav Hirsch, \"The Bais Yaakov-The House of Yaakov in every generation is the repository of the future of the Torah. It is like the Holy Ark. Therefore being a part of Bais Yaakov is a noble distinction. It brings into focus the import of the home. It’s no wonder then that one sage in the Talmud said, “I never called my wife my wife but rather my ‘Bais’-house!” \"<a href=\"http://torah.org/torah-portion/dvartorah-5771-shavuos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://torah.org/torah-portion/dvartorah-5771-shavuos/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It can mean matriarch, it can mean cave, it can mean hollow. And he could have moved his house because he was living in tents then. It can mean a state of mind like the heart of a home is the woman and the house of Israel may mean the place or the people.

מזרע דוד: וזלה\"ק (מאידיש): \"שלא יכבה נרו לעולם ועד, כי אור הבעל שם טוב מאיר תמיד, חסידות תהיה בלי ספק עד משיח, שהרי דוד מלך ישראל חי וקיים, שזה היה הבעל שם טוב, והמגיד (ממעזריטש), והרבי (אדמו\"ר

בית המלך דליובאוויטש, הרי זה עצמו מעיד שרבי שלום שכנא ובנו הצ\"צ היו אף הם מזרע דוד מבית המלוכה (וכמבואר בכתובות סב, ב. בענין הקפדתו של רבינו הקדוש לקחת לבנו אשה ממלכות דוד, ואם-כן כל-שכן שכן הוא בלקיחת חתן שממנו תמשיך שושלת המלוכה).</p>\n<p>ושמעתי מש\"ב הגה\"ח ר' שמואל היילפרין ז\"ל, שקיבל מהגה\"ח רבי משה לייב שפירא זצ\"ל ראש ישיבת תורת אמת, בשם זקני החסידים בדור שלפניו, שהיה מקובל אצלם אשר כ\"ק אדמוה\"ז הוא מבית דוד מנוקבתא, ודוקא הצ\"צ הוא מבית דוד מדכורא.</p>\n<p>אבל במסורת זו נצטרך לכאורה לומר \"פלגינן דיבוריה\". כי זה שאמרו שאדמוה\"ז הוא מנוקבתא דבית דוד טעון בדיקה, דאם הכוונה לסדר יחוסו למהר\"ל מפראג, שכאילו אינו בן אחר בן מהמהר\"ל, הרי ידוע שאמנם בספר \"בית רבי\" בתחילתו כתב, שהגאון רבי יהודה לייב (אבדק\"ק קאוולי בעל \"קול יהודה\", שהיה אביו זקנו של רבי ברוך זצ\"ל אביו של אדמו\"ר הזקן) – היה נינו של חתן המהר\"ל רבי יוסף יאסקי אבדק\"ק לובלין. ועל פי זה הרי אדמוה\"ז הוא מבתו של המהר\"ל. אבל בספר \"היום יום\" (ובמכתב כ\"ק אדמו\"ר הריי\"צ באג\"ק ח\"ח, ב'תצו) מפורש, שרבי יהודה לייב הנ\"ל היה בנו של רבי שמואל, בנו של רבי בצלאל, בן המהר\"ל.</p>\n<p>ולהעיר מהמסופר ב\"ספר הזכרונות\" פצ\"א, שרבי משה אביו של רבי שניאור זלמן, אביו של רבי ברוך, אביו של אדמוה\"ז, נשא לאשה את \"שרה בתו היתומה של רבי שניאור זלמן שהיה מגזע היחס של רבי יצחק כ\"ץ חתנו של המהר\"ל. וכך נקשרו הקצוות של שני ענפי משפחת המהר\"ל – צאצאי בנו היחיד וצאצאי בתו\". ואם-כן שתי המסורות נכונות, שאדמוה\"ז היה מגזע המהר\"ל מדכורא בן אחר בן, וגם מנוקבתא על-ידי חתנו (אבל אין זה אותו החתן המוזכר ב\"בית רבי\". ובקובץ \"יגדיל תורה\" ניו יורק שנה עשירית חוברת ע\"א ע' רמב ואילך, הוכיח הרה\"ח ר' שד\"ב לוין שי', שהאמור ב\"בית רבי\" בענין זה אינו נכון, וביסס את האמור ב\"היום יום\" על-פי מחקרים היסטוריים).</p>\n<p>ועל פי זה הרי מסורת הנ\"ל שאדמוה\"ז הוא מנקבות דבית דוד אינה ביחוסו למהר\"ל. אבל יתכן שהכוונה ליחוסו של המהר\"ל עצמו, שנאמר עליו (ב\"היום יום\" שם ובמגילה היוחסין שלו), שהיה: \"מגזע הגאונים המיוחסים לדוד בן ישי\", שיחוס זה עצמו יכול להיות מנוקבתא. אבל גם זה אינו נכון וכבר נעשתה עבודת מחקר נפלאה על פי ספרי יחס קדמונים, ע\"י הרה\"ח ר' יוסף סולומון מכפר חב\"ד, ובה יחוס מפורט של 82 דורות בן אחר בן מדוד המלך עד המהר\"ל בשמותיהם לדורותיהם.</p>\n<p>ג</p>\n<p>אדמו\"ר הצמח-צדק – גם בן אחר בן, וגם בן הבת</p>\n<p>ואם-כן ברור, שמקורה של מסורת זו שאדמוה\"ז הוא מנוקבתא דבית דוד, הוא ביחוס המוטעה שבספר \"בית רבי\" וכנ\"ל, אבל על כל פנים את זה נקבל ממסורת זו שמסר הגרמ\"ל שפירא, שגם כ\"ק הצ\"צ היה מדכורא דבית דוד. וזה מתאים להמסופר אודות הטעם שכ\"ק אדמו\"ר האמצעי נקרא בשם זה \"האמצעי\", כי בזמן מלכותו של הצ\"צ היו החסידים שבדורו בטוחים בלי ספק שהוא המשיח \"מנחם שמו\" (ומבאר הרבי שלכן קראו ספרו בשם \"צמח צדק\"), ובמילא הוא הנשיא האחרון, וחותנו הנשיא השני הוא ה\"אמצעי\", וכך נשאר תוארו לדורות.</p>\n<p>ועל פי זה עולה שבכ\"ק אדמו\"ר הצ\"צ היו ב' המעלות, כי היה מהזכרים דבית דוד מצד אביו, ובנוסף לזה היתה בו מעלה יתירה שהיה נכד אדמו\"ר הזקן. ובזה גופא מצד אמו דוקא, ובכך יש מעלה נוספת על היותו בן אחר בן מדוד, וכמבואר במכתב כ\"ק אדמו\"ר מוהריי\"צ (מיום ו' אייר תרצ\"ט – אג\"ק ח\"ד א'ק, ו\"היום יום\" כ\"ח אייר), שביום השלושים להסתלקות כ\"ק אדמוה\"ז זכה כ\"ק הצ\"צ לראות את זקנו בחזיון לילה, ולמד עמו הסוגיא בפרק יש נוחלין (קי, ב) ששאלו בגמרא שם עה\"פ למען ירבו ימיכם וימי בניכם, \"אי הכי נמי בניכם ולא בנותיכם\", ותירצו \"ברכה שאני\". ואחר כך אמר לו כ\"ק אדמו\"ר הזקן: \"איש מזריע תחילה יולדת נקבה, זו היא אמך. אשה מזרעת תחילה יולדת זכר, זה הוא אתה\".</p>\n<p>שבזה נראה שביחוסו של הצ\"צ לאדמוה\"ז יש אדרבה מעלה בכך שהוא בן הבת, וכפי שמצינו גם בהלכה למעשה שהבת מקבלת תכונות אביה יותר מהבן (רמ\"א או\"ח סימן קכ\"ח סמ\"א, ומג\"א סקס\"ב, ופרמ\"ג בא\"א שם). וראה לקו\"ש ח\"ח ע' 165 בלשון רש\"י ר\"פ פנחס \"פיטם אבי אמו עגלים לע\"ז\", כי בן הבת מקבל תכונות הסב יותר מבן הבן.</p>\n<p>ואם-כן בכ\"ק אדמו\"ר שליט\"א יש את ב' המעלות, שהוא בן אחר בן למלכות דוד – מסבו הצ\"צ, וגם בן אחר הבת למלכות דוד – מסבו אדמוה\"ז.</p>\n<p>ד</p>\n<p>איך אמרו על רבינו הקדוש שהוא משיח?</p>\n<p>ויש לבאר בעומק יותר את הטעם שבמשיח יש את שני היחוסים הנ\"ל מבן ומבת. דהנה ידוע, שמיסוד האמונה בביאת המשיח הוא ש\"לא יסור שבט מיהודה\", ועוד שהמשיח יהיה מזרע דוד ושלמה דוקא. וכמפורש בסהמ\"צ ל\"ת מצוה שס\"ב: \"אמנם המלכות לבד, כבר ידעת מכתובי ספרי הנבואה שזכה בה דוד.. וכן זרעו אחריו עד סוף כל הדורות. אין מלך למי שיאמין תורת משה רבינו ע\"ה אדון כל הנביאים, אלא מזרע דוד ומזרע שלמה לבד. וכל מי שהוא מזולת זה הזרע הנכבד, לענין מלכות נכרי קרינן ביה, כמו שכל מי שהוא מזולת זרע אהרן, לענין עבודה זר קרינא ביה. וזה מבואר אין ספק בו\", ועל דרך זה בפיה\"מ פרק חלק ביסוד השנים עשר: \"ומכלל יסוד זה, שאין מלך לישראל אלא מבית דוד ומזרע שלמה בלבד. וכל החולק על המשפחה הזאת כפר בשם השם ית' ובדברי נביאיו\" (ומקורו בתנחומא ס\"פ תולדות).</p>\n<p>ומש\"כ הרמב\"ם שמצאנו זה \"בכתובי ספרי הנבואה\", הוא בדברי הימים (א' כב, ט-י, ועוד) שדוד המלך הובטח ע\"י הקב\"ה \"הנה בן נולד לך.. שלמה יהיה שמו.. והכינותי את כסא מלכותו על ישראל עד עולם\". וכמבואר בשיחות כ\"ק אדמו\"ר מה\"מ, שהנצחיות של מלכות דוד היא דוקא על ידי זה שהמלכות עוברת דרך בנו שלמה, ולכן הכריזה בת שבע \"יחי אדוני המלך דוד לעולם\" רק אחרי שדוד הבטיח ששלמה בנו ימלוך אחריו.</p>\n<p>ועל פי זה צריך להבין את המבואר בסנהדרין צח, ב: \"אמר רב, אי מן חייא הוא (מלך המשיח) כגון רבינו הקדוש. אי מן מתייא הוא כגון דניאל איש חמודות\". ופירש\"י בלישנא קמא דמה שאמרו \"כגון\" הוא לאו דוקא, אלא שאכן \"אם משיח מאותן שחיים עכשיו ודאי היינו רבינו הקדוש דסובל תחלואים וחסיד גמור הוה\". ונשאלת קושיא עצומה, איך אמרו שרבינו הקדוש הוא המשיח, והרי מפורש בכתובות סב, ב. דיחוסו של רבי הוא משפטיה בן אביטל (אשת דוד), ולא מזרע שלמה.</p>\n<p>וביותר קשה מהמבואר בירושלמי כתובות פי\"ב ה\"ג וכלאים פ\"ט ה\"ג, ומובא בתוס' סנהדרין ה, א. ד\"ה דהכא שבט והתם מחוקק, דיחוסו של רבינו הקדוש לבית דוד הוא רק מצד האם, אבל מאביו הוא מבנימין. ואם-כן לא זו בלבד שאינו מזרע שלמה, אלא שכלל אינו משבט יהודה ובמילא אין לו משפט המלוכה, וכדכתיב \"לא יסור שבט מיהודה.. עד כי יבא שילה\".</p>\n<p>ה</p>\n<p>התינוק היחיד שנותר מהזכרים של בית דוד</p>\n<p>והנה היעב\"ץ בהוריות יא, ב. כתב שלתלמוד הבבלי רבינו הקדוש הוא מנוקבתא דשלמה ומדכורא דשפטיה, והיינו שהיה בן אחר בן מדוד באמצעות שפטיה בן אביטל, ובנוסף לזה היה גם מזרע שלמה מנוקבתא. ואם-כן הוא משבט יהודה וגם מזרע שלמה, אף שאינו בן אחר בן מדוד ושלמה. אבל צ\"ע אם אפשר לומר כן, שהרי בכתובות שם אמרו: \"רבי איעסק ליה לבריה (להשיאו) בי רבי חייא, כי מטא למיכתב כתובה נח נפשה דרביתא (מתה הכלה, בתו של ר' חייא). אמר רבי: ח\"ו פסולא איכא? יתיבו ועיינו במשפחות (ומצאו:) רבי אתי משפטיה בן אביטל, ורבי חייא אתי משמעי אחי דוד\", ופירש\"י: \"אביטל שם אשת דוד, ור' חייא אתי משמעי, וזהו הפסול שרבי היה מבית דוד ולא היתה בת הבאה משמעי הוגנת לבנו שלא היתה בת מלכים\". ומוכח מכאן שרבי אינו משלמה, דאם-כן היה לגמרא לומר שבח גדול יותר דרבי אתי אף משלמה, ולא תיפסק המלכות מצאצאיו. ועל- כרחך שאינו מזרע שלמה, ומה שאמרו בירושלמי שרבי בא מנוקבתא, היינו מנוקבתא דשפטיה, ואינו משבט יהודה כלל.</p>\n<p>ועוד קשה, איך יתכן שרבי היה מזכרים דשפטיה, והרי עתליה בת אחאב הרגה את כל זרע המלוכה, ולא השאירה מן הזכרים שריד ופליט, חוץ מהתינוק יואש בן אחזיה, מבני בניו של שלמה, שהתחבא עם מניקתו בקדש הקדשים (מלכים ב' פי\"א, וסנהדרין צה, ב). ואם-כן איך יתכן שיהיה מישהו בדורות מאוחרים יותר שיתייחס לזכרים דשפטיה. ועיין בספר \"רמתים צופים\" זוטא פכ\"א (להרה\"ק ר' שמואל משינאווא) שכתב: \"משמע כי חוץ מיואש לא נשתייר אחד, והרי אמרו דרבי אתיא משפטיה בן אביטל. נראה לומר כי היא הרגה רק את הזכרים ולא את הנקבות, וכן מוכח בירושלמי, אנא מן נוקבתא\".</p>\n<p>ו</p>\n<p>רבינו הקדוש העיד על עצמו: אני משבט בנימין</p>\n<p>והנה למרות כל זאת, הרי החיד\"א ב\"ברכי יוסף\" חו\"מ סימן א' אות יו\"ד כתב כתירוץ היעב\"ץ הנ\"ל, והביא את הראב\"ד בספר הקבלה, שהלל היה מבני בניו של דוד הזכרים (לשון ספר הקבלה לפנינו, שהלל היה \"מבית דוד מזרע המלוכה\"), ובמילא רבינו הקדוש שהוא מבני בניו של הלל, אף הוא היה מזכרים דדוד. ועל פי זה מה שאמרו בכתובות שהוא משפטיה, הכוונה מזכרים דשפטיה. אבל קשה לומר דהסוגיא בכתובות חלוקה על הירושלמי. שהרי התוס' סנהדרין הנ\"ל בונה מירושלמי זה דינים להלכה.</p>\n<p>והברכ\"י עצמו שם הביא את הירושלמי, דרבינו הקדוש אומר שרב הונא (ה\"ריש גלותא\") גדול ממנו, \"דהוא מן יהודה ואנא מבנימין, הוא מן דכריה ואנא מנוקבתא\". (וע\"כ מנוקבתא דשפטיה, כי אם מנוקבתא דשלמה ומדכורא דשפטיה, א\"כ אינו מבנימין אלא מיהודה). וכן פירש בפני משה שם: \"כלומר שרבי היה ג\"כ מיהודה מבית דוד, אלא שרב הונא היה מזכרים מיהודה ורבי מנקבות.. וחשוב הוא (רב הונא) בייחוס ממנו\". וכן כתב המאירי בהקדמתו לאבות: \"כלומר, שהיתה לאחד מקדומי משפחתו אשה מבני שפטיה בן אביטל, אבל מצד אביו היה משבט בנימין\". וחזרה הקושיא איך אמרו על רבינו הקדוש שהוא המשיח.</p>\n<p>ז</p>\n<p>אשה אינה יכולה למלוך, אך יכולה להעביר ירושת המלוכה</p>\n<p>ועוד יש להבין, דאפילו אם נדחוק לומר דלבבלי אתי רבינו הקדוש מבית דוד מצד האב משפטיה ומצד האם משלמה, עדיין יוקשה האם צאצא מנוקבתא יכול לרשת את המלוכה. והמנ\"ח מצווה תצ\"ז הביא את לשון הרמב\"ם בהלכות מלכים פ\"א ה\"ז דכל הקודם בנחלה קודם לירושת המלוכה, וכתב שעפ\"ז יתכן שתיסוב נחלת המלוכה גם לבן בת כאשר אין בן הבן. אמנם בהגה\"ה שם מובאת קושיית הר\"י פערלא, שבאותה ההלכה כתב הרמב\"ם דכיון שנמשח דוד זכה בכתר מלכות והרי המלכות לו ולבניו הזכרים עד עולם. ועפ\"ז מוכרח לכאורה שמשיח יהיה בן אחר בן משלמה.</p>\n<p>איברא שעל-זה היה אפשר לתרץ, שמש\"כ הרמב\"ם דהמלכות היא לזכרים, היינו רק שאשה אינה יכולה למלוך, אבל העברת ירושת המלוכה באמצעותה מאביה לבנה, זה אינו מושלל. ולכן אם רבינו הקדוש הוא מזרע דוד ויהודה באמצעות שפטיה וגם מזרע שלמה מנוקבתא, הוא ראוי למלכות. ובגמרא שבת (נו, א): \"אמר רב, רבי דאתי מדוד מהפך ודריש בזכותיה דדוד\", הרי שגם אם רבי בא מנקבות נקרא \"דאתי מדוד\".</p>\n<p>אמנם אף שכן יש לומר בדוחק, שנצחיות מלכות שלמה שתתגלה במשיח תהיה באמצעות נוקבתא, אבל מה נעשה עם התוס' בשם הירושלמי, והמפורש במאירי, דרבינו הקדוש הוא מנוקבתא דשפטיה ואינו משבט יהודה בכלל ולא מזרע שלמה בפרט, וחזרה הקושיא הכיצד אמרו עליו שהוא המשיח שבדור.</p>\n<p>ח</p>\n<p>האם רבינו הקדוש רק כדוגמא, או בבחינת משיח בן יוסף?</p>\n<p>והרה\"ק בעל \"מנחת אלעזר\" בספרו \"דברי תורה\" ח\"ד אות ו' תירץ: \"ובע\"כ לומר כפירוש הב' ברש\"י שם בזה\"ל: לישנא אחרא כגון רבינו הקדוש, כלומר אם יש דוגמתו בחיים היינו רבינו הקדוש, ואם דוגמא הוא למתים היינו כגון דניאל איש חמודות (עכ\"ל רש\"י ז\"ל). היינו שהוא רק דוגמא, ו\"כגון״ הוא עיקר בלשונו הנ\"ל בגמ', דלאו דוקא רבינו הקדוש (כיון דאינו מזרע שלמה) אלא איש א' הדומה לו בחסידותו וסובל יסורים (כנ\"ל), אם יהיה מזרע שלמה הוא ראוי להיות משיח\", עכ\"ל. אבל עדיין אינו מובן מה נעשה עם לישנא קמא דרש\"י.</p>\n<p>ובספר \"בן יהוידע\" לבעל ה\"בן איש חי\" מבגדד, ביאר את הגמרא באופן אחר: \"ומ\"ש רב אי מן חייא הוא כגון רבינו הקדוש, ג\"כ כוונתו על ניצוץ משיח בן יוסף שיבא בכל דור, ואמר כגון רבינו הקדוש שהיה מזרע דוד מנוקבייא וסבל יסורין רבים\". וכוונתו, שהיחוס מנוקבתא לזרע דוד הוא מספיק בכדי להקרא משיח בן יוסף, וכמו שפי' גם לעיל בד\"ה א\"ר נחמן אי מן חייא הוא כגון אנא, וז\"ל: \"היתה קבלה בידם כי נצוץ משיח בן יוסף אשר יבא בכל דור בצדיק שבדור יבא בצדיק שהוא מזרע דוד ע\"ה, ולכך קוראין אותו בשם כסא דוד. ובא ר' נחמן לומר דאין הכוונה שיהיה בזרע דוד ממש, אלא אפילו כגון אנא שאיני מזרע דוד ורק אשתי בת ריש גלותא היא מזרע דוד, אפשר שנחשב איש זה מזרע דוד, משום בעל כאשתו, ויתגלגל בו נצוץ משיח בן יוסף\".</p>\n<p>אמנם שני תירוצים אלו אינם מתאימים לכאורה עם דרכו של הרבי מה\"מ בכ\"מ כשמציין לענין זה בשיחותיו הקדושות, דאכן מה שאמרו על רבינו הקדוש שהוא משיח, אין זו דוגמא בלבד, אלא קביעת מציאות שרבינו הקדוש הוא המשיח שבדור, וכן שהכוונה היא למשיח בן דוד. וא\"כ עדיין אינו מובן איך יתכן שמי שאינו משבט יהודה ואינו מזרע שלמה, רק מנוקבתא דשפטיה, יהיה המשיח.</p>\n<p>ט</p>\n<p>מה ה'סוד' ששמע רבי מבניו של רבי חייא?</p>\n<p>ויש לומר, בהקדים סוגית הגמרא בהוריות שם: \"בעי מיניה רבי מרבי חייא, כגון אני מהו בשעיר\", ופירש\"י: \"כלומר, נשיאות דידי מי הוא נשיאות מעליא, דאילו הוינא בזמן שבית המקדש קיים, מייתינא שעיר או לא\". וענה לו רבי חייא: \"הרי צרתך בבבל\", והיינו שראש הגולה עומד על גביו (כדאמרו בסנהדרין ה, א: \"הכא שבט והתם מחוקק\"), ולכן לא מתקיים כאן התנאי שבמשנה הוריות (י, א) \"איזהו נשיא, זה מלך.. שאין על גביו אלא ה' אלקיו\".</p>\n<p>ועפ\"ז נשאלת עוד קושיא עצומה על דבריו של רב, שאמר שרבינו הקדוש הוא המשיח, והרי מפורש כאן שאין לו דין מלך, וגם לא יכול להיות לו דין מלך כל זמן שהמינוי של \"ריש גלותא\" קיים.</p>\n<p>והנה בגמרא דידן נאמר ששאל רבי מרבי חייא, ובילקוט (ויקרא רמז תסט) מובא דשאלה זו שאל רבי מרב. ולהעיר, שגם את ההודעה שרבי הוא המשיח, יחסו הן לרב והן לרבי חייא, כי בירושלמי (שבת פט\"ז ה\"א) מבואר שרבי חייא קרא עליו \"רוח אפינו משיח ה'\". הרי שלשניהם שאל רבי \"כגון אני מהו בשעיר\", ושניהם השיבו שאין לו דין מלך, דצרתו בבבל. וא\"כ שוב אינו מובן איך אמרו שניהם עליו שהוא המשיח, כאשר אין בו אפילו דיני מלך, וגם לא יכולים להיות לו דיני מלך, דצרתו בבבל.</p>\n<p>וביותר יוקשה מסנהדרין לח, א: \"יהודה וחזקיה בני רבי חייא, הוו יתבי בסעודתא קמי רבי, ולא הוו קאמרי ולא מידי. אמר להו, אגברו חמרא אדרדקי כי היכי דלימרו מילתא. כיון דאיבסום, פתחו ואמרו, אין בן דוד בא עד שיכלו שני בתי אבות מישראל, ואלו הן, ראש הגולה שבבבל ונשיא שבארץ ישראל.. אמר להם (רבי לבני ר\"ח) בני, קוצים אתם מטילים לי בעיני. אמר לו רבי חייא, רבי אל ירע בעיניך, יין ניתן בשבעים אותיות וסוד ניתן בשבעים אותיות, נכנס יין יצא סוד\".</p>\n<p>ועפ\"ז אינו מובן כלל, איך אמרו רבי חייא ורב שרבינו הקדוש הוא המשיח, והרי רבי חייא עצמו הסכים לדברי בניו, שלא רק שהנשיא שבארץ ישראל אינו המשיח, אלא אדרבה, שהתנאי לביאת המשיח הוא שיכלו שני בתי האבות, שאחד מהם הוא הנשיא שבארץ ישראל. ועוד צריך להבין, שלאחר שטען רבי בצדק, שבני רבי חייא מטילים קוצים בעיניו, מפני מה נחה רוחו כששמע מרבי חייא, שדברי בניו נאמרו לאחר שנכנס יין ויצא סוד.</p>\n<p>יו\"ד</p>\n<p>סוד הגאולה – חיבור שני המשיחים</p>\n<p>ויש לבאר כל זה בהקדים מה שאמרו חז\"ל בפרקי דרבי אליעזר, והובא בתוס' (סוטה יג, א. ד\"ה סרח בת אשר), ש\"סוד הגאולה\" הוא, שהבשורת על יציאת מצרים תבוא בלשון \"פקוד פקדתי\". ונתבאר בס\"ד בספר \"יחי המלך המשיח\" ע' ק-קא, שה\"סוד\" המונח בלשון זה הוא חיבור שני המשיחים, יוסף ומשה. כי יוסף הצדיק הוא שהבטיח \"פקוד יפקוד\", וכאשר משה מתחבר עם יוסף לגאול את עם ישראל, הוא גואל מכחו של יוסף ומכריז בלשונו \"פקוד פקדתי\". והפקידה היא כפולה, כיון שבאה ע\"י חיבור שני המשיחים.</p>\n<p>ועיי\"ש, שכאשר היה צריך משה למצוא היכן טמנו המצרים את ארונו של יוסף, הלך דוקא לסרח בת אשר, וכמובן מהתוס' שם, דמאחר שהיא ידעה את סוד הגאולה של פקוד פקדתי, במילא בודאי ידעה איך לחבר את יוסף ומשה בפועל. וזהו שאמרה סרח בת אשר \"אנכי שלומי אמוני ישראל\", וביארו בב\"ר (ויגש צד, ט) \"אני הוא שהשלמתי נאמן לנאמן\" (יוסף שהיה נאמן בבית אדוניו המצרי, ומשה שנאמר עליו בכל ביתי נאמן הוא), שסרח בת אשר חיברה בין שני המשיחים (ועיין \"לקוטי לוי יצחק\" אגרות ע' תיט, בביאור הטעם שחיבור יוסף ומשה שהביא לגאולה היה ע\"י סרח בת אשר דוקא).</p>\n<p>והנה יוסף ומשה הם הענין דשבט ומחוקק. דיוסף הוא השליט בכל ארץ מצרים, בחי' ריש גלותא, היינו ענין השבט. ואילו משה הוא נותן התורה, עד שגם הנשיא שבארץ ישראל \"הוא העומד תחת משה רבינו\" (רמב\"ם הלכות סנהדרין פ\"א ה\"ג), ולכן נקרא משה בשם מחוקק \"כי שם חלקת מחוקק ספון\" (ברכה לג, כא). ובכדי שתהיה גאולת מצרים, היה מוכרח להיות החיבור דשבט ומחוקק, \"ויקח משה את עצמות יוסף עמו\".</p>\n<p>ולא זו בלבד, אלא ששלימות הגאולה בכניסה לארץ ישראל היתה ע\"י יהושע דוקא, שהוא המחבר לאחדים כאחד ממש את יוסף ומשה. כי יהושע היה מזרע יוסף (משבט אפרים, ראה רש\"י ברכה לג, יז), וגלגול יוסף (\"סדר הדורות\" ב\"א תפח), ועם זאת היה מקבל יחיד של התורה ממשה \"ומסרה ליהושע\" (כמבואר בהקדמת הרמב\"ם לספר הי\"ד).</p>\n<p>וכשם שיציאת מצרים היתה ע\"י חיבור ב' המשיחים, יוסף ומשה, כן הגאולה העתידה לבוא עכשיו ממש, היא ע\"י חיבור שני בתי האבות, שבט ומחוקק, ראש הגולה שבבבל והנשיא שבארץ ישראל, שהם כנגד יוסף ומשה כנ\"ל.</p>\n<p>יא</p>\n<p>עד שתכלה החלוקה של שני בתי אבות מישראל</p>\n<p>ויש לומר, שזהו הסוד שיצא כשאגברו חמרא אדרדקי. שבני רבי חייא חידשו דבר נפלא, דאין בן דוד בא עד שתכלה החלוקה של שני בתי אבות מישראל, כיון ששני בתי האבות יתאחדו במשיח צדקנו, שהוא עצמו יהיה השבט והמחוקק המאוחדים יחד. וכמפורש בסה\"ש תש\"נ ח\"ב ע' 557 ואילך, שענין המלכות שבמשיח הוא בחי' \"משיח בן יוסף\", שיוסף הוא המלך הראשון וממנו נמשך המלכות לדוד, ואילו התורה שמשיח משפיע היא בחי' \"משיח בן דוד\" שבו. ומלך המשיח הגואל את עם ישראל בפועל מאחד באישיותו את שני הענינים. ולכן לא הזכיר הרמב\"ם בהלכות מלכים את ענין משיח בן יוסף, \"ומשמע מלשונו שם דהכל נעשה ע\"י משיח בן דוד\" (לקו\"ש חל\"ב ע' 185). כי משיח יכלול את שתי הבחינות: \"יעמוד מלך\" – שבט, ו\"הוגה בתורה\" – מחוקק.</p>\n<p>ואפשר שזהו גם מה שאמר יעקב אבינו: \"לא יסור שבט מיהודה ומחוקק מבין רגליו, עד כי יבוא שילה ולו יקהת עמים\", כלומר: שבכל הדורות יהיו תמיד שני ממונים: שבט - מלך ושליט מיהודה, ומחוקק - מוסר ומלמד התורה לרבים. אבל כל זה רק \"עד כי יבוא שילה ולו יקהת עמים\", כי בביאת המשיח יכלו שני בתי האבות, ושניהם יתאחדו במשיח צדקנו עצמו: \"שילה\" - בגימטריא משה, הו\"ע תורתו של משיח, ו\"יקהת עמים\" - המלוכה על כל האומות.</p>\n<p>ויובן בזה מה שנחה דעתו של רבינו הקדוש, כשביאר לו רבי חייא, שהתנאי שאין בן דוד בא עד לביטול הנשיאות שבארץ ישראל, אינו מפני שיש איזה ענין שלילי ח\"ו בנשיאות זו, אלא אדרבה ששני בתי האבות שבט ומחוקק מתאחדים במשיח צדקנו, שזהו סוד הגאולה (ועיין ב\"יחי המלך המשיח\" ע' קנח-ט שנתבאר ענין ה\"יין\" וה\"סוד\").</p>\n<p>יב</p>\n<p>רבינו הקדוש – לא משיח בפועל, אלא 'משיח שבדור'</p>\n<p>ובכ\"ז נבין איך אמרו על רבינו הקדוש שהוא משיח, אע\"פ שהיה משבט בנימין, ורק מנוקבתא דשפטיה ולא משלמה, וגם לא היה לו דין מלך, דצרתו בבבל וכו'.</p>\n<p>דהנה השבט והמחוקק הם משיח בן יוסף ומשיח בן דוד כנ\"ל. ומבואר בלקוטי הש\"ס לאריז\"ל (טו,א) \"תרין משיחין, משיח בן יוסף מדכורא משיח בן דוד מנוקבתא\", והוא כדברי הירושלמי והתוס' בסנהדרין הנ\"ל, דראש גולה שבבבל הוא מזכרים ונשיא שבארץ ישראל מנקבות.</p>\n<p>וכשאמר רב ד\"אם משיח מאותן שחיין עכשיו ודאי היינו רבינו הקדוש\", אין הכוונה שרבינו הקדוש יקום ויגאל את עם ישראל, אלא שאם בחינת \"משיח בן דוד\" נמצאת באחד מאותן שחיין עכשיו, הרי זה רבינו הקדוש. אבל כמובן שהוא עצמו לא יכול להביא הגאולה בפועל, כי עיקר המלכות היא לצרתו שבבבל, ראש הגולה משיח בן יוסף שבא מהזכרים. ורק כשיכלו שני בתי אבות, ויתאחדו שניהם במלך המשיח שיכלול את שני הענינים דשבט ומחוקק, רק אז בן דוד בא בפועל ממש וגואל את עם ישראל.</p>\n<p>וזהו שפירש\"י: \"ודאי היינו רבינו הקדוש דסובל תחלואים וחסיד גמור הוה\". שלכאורה אין זה מובן כלל, מדוע נקט דוקא שני סימנים אלו, והרי אדרבה אם רוצה רב לומר שרבינו הקדוש הוא משיח, עליו לחפש בו סימנים של מלכות והנהגה, וכלשון הרמב\"ם \"יעמוד מלך וכו'\" (והסימנים שנתן רש\"י הפוכים מענין המלכות). אלא שכאמור לא היתה הכוונה למשיח הגואל בפועל את עם ישראל, אלא ל\"משיח בן דוד\" שבדור. ובחי' משיח בן דוד אין ענינו תוקף המלוכה, ואדרבה, שביחד עם זה שענינו הוא נשיאות של תורה, כדוד המלך שהיה ראש הסנהדרין (עיין כס\"מ בהקדמת הרמב\"ם ליד החזקה), הרי הוא סובל תחלואים ונקרא \"חיורא (מצורע) דבית רבי\", כדוד שהיה נרדף כל ימיו, ונצטרע, וביקש \"שועתי אליך ותרפאני\". וזהו שהוסיף רש\"י ש\"חסיד גמור\" הוא, היינו כדוד שאמר \"שמרה נפשי כי חסיד אני\" (תהלים פו) ואחז\"ל: \"לא חסיד אני, שכל מלכי מזרח ומערב כו' ואני ידי מלוכלכות כו' כדי לטהר אשה לבעלה\" (ברכות ד,א). שזהו \"חסיד\" הפועל לטובת השני במסירות נפש, הגם שהוא היפך ממש מהנהגת המלכות של כל מלכי מזרח ומערב.</p>\n<p>יג</p>\n<p>במלך המשיח תהיה ההתאחדות של \"מלך\" ו\"רב\"</p>\n<p>ואף שבודאי גם לרבי היה את ענין המלכות, וכמבואר בחדא\"ג מהרש\"א לסנהדרין שם (מובא בספר השיחות תשנ\"ב ח\"א ע' 131 הערה 94): \"מאותן הבאים מבני דוד ועדיין היה להם ממשלה גם בגלות.. כגון רבינו הקדוש\", אבל מ\"מ אין כאן שלימות המלכות דצרתו בבבל כנ\"ל, ולהלכה אין הוא נקרא \"נשיא זה מלך\". ולהעיר עוד מספר השיחות תנש\"א שיחת ש\"ק תזריע מצורע ע' 496, שמצטט שם לשון רש\"י \"אם משיח מאותן שחיין עכשיו\", וכותב בהערה 66: \"וע\"פ פס\"ד הרמב\"ם.. ואם יעמוד מלך מבית דוד כו' – היינו שהוא כבר מלך\". ובזה לכאורה כוונתו לומר, שרב ראה ברבינו הקדוש גם את ענין המלכות, דלולא זאת הרי אין הוא שייך כלל להקרא משיח. ומ\"מ אין זו אלא מלכות של תורה כמשה רבינו, ואין כאן את שלימות המלוכה, דעיקר המלכות היא לראש הגולה, ומשום כך אינו יכול להיות משיח בפועל.</p>\n<p>ולכן עם כל הגדלות שיחסו רב ורבי חייא לרבינו הקדוש, עד שאמרו שמשיח הוא \"כגון רבינו הקדוש\", הרי כאשר הוא שאל אותם הלכה למעשה אם יש לו דין מלך, השיבו לו בשלילה. כי רק ראש הגולה שבא מזכרים דדוד ומזרע שלמה, יש בו את שלימות המלכות, כשלמה אביו שדוקא בו היתה שלימות המלכות ונתקיים בו (דברי הימים א' כט, כג) \"וישב שלמה על כסא ה'\" (וכמבואר באריכות בספר השיחות תנש\"א ח\"ב ע' ‎527-8‏ במעלת מלכות שלמה לגבי מלכות דוד). אבל גם ראש הגולה אינו יכול להיות מלך המשיח, כי אין בו את הנשיאות דתורה. ומלכות המשיח היא החיבור של שניהם, כשיכלו שני בתי אבות ויתאחדו לאחדים כאחד.</p>\n<p>וזהו שמבואר באריכות בשיחות כ\"ק אדמו\"ר שליט\"א, שבמלך המשיח תהיה ההתאחדות של \"מלך\" ו\"רב\". שהרי משיח \"מחזיר מלכות דוד ליושנה\", וגם \"ילמד תורה את כל העם\" (הלכות תשובה סוף פ\"ט. לקו\"ת צו יז,א).</p>\n<p>יד</p>\n<p>בדורנו – הרבי הוא המלך המשיח בפועל ממש</p>\n<p>ובספר \"שארית ישראל\" להרה\"צ מוילעדניק זי\"ע כתב (ומובא בדא\"ח), שמהבעש\"ט ואילך החל להאיר ניצוץ משיח. כי מהבעש\"ט החלה ההתאחדות של משיח בן דוד ומשיח בן יוסף, היינו הנשיאות בתורה והנשיאות במלכות כאחד. וזהו שנקראו הבעש\"ט ותלמידיו הקדושים בשם \"אדוננו מורנו ורבינו\", כי על המלך אמרו בתוספתא (סנהדרין פ\"א ה\"ב) \"וקורין אותו אדוננו ורבינו\", והוסיפו \"מורנו\" ע\"ש שמלמד תורה ועבודת ה' לכל העם וגם לאומות העולם, וכמ\"ש (ישעי' ב, ג) \"ויורנו מדרכיו\", ופירש הרד\"ק \"והמורה הוא מלך המשיח\".</p>\n<p>והנה בכל השיחות שמדבר הרבי אודות כ\"ק אדמו\"ר מוהריי\"צ נ\"ע, שהוא נשיא הדור המשיח שבדור, ומקשר זה עם ענין הגאולה בפועל, הרי בודאי שכוונתו שהוא המשיח כפשוטו, גואלם של ישראל, ולא רק כמו שאמרו על רבינו הקדוש. וכלשונו הטהור בשיחת ליל שמחת תורה תשמ\"ו: \"נשיא דורנו הוא המשיח, עם כל הפירושים במשיח: נמשח בשמן, נבחר, מנהיג ורועה ישראל.. ולא איכפת לי אם יפרשו משיח צדקנו כפשוטו, כי כך היא המציאות האמיתית, שנשיא דורנו היה משיח בדורו והוא המשיח בדורנו\".</p>\n<p>וכשאומר הרבי שע\"י ההכרזה \"יחי המלך\" מתגלית מציאותו של המשיח, ורק לאחר מכן באים פרטי פעולותיו שלוחם מלחמות ה' ומנצח וכו' (ספר השיחות תשנ\"ב ח\"א ע' ‎131-2‏), הרי אין כוונתו רק לענין תאורטי ונשמתי דמשיח בן דוד וכדומה, אלא למשיח כפשוטו שמתגלה ע\"י ההכרזה \"יחי המלך\" ואח\"כ לוחם מלחמות ה'. וכשאומר שמלך המשיח עומד על גג בית המקדש ומבשר את הגאולה, וממשיך שזהו \"כפי שהכריזו ומכריזים במיוחד לאחרונה\" (ספר השיחות תנש\"א ע' ‎138-9‏), הרי גם בזה כוונתו למלך המשיח כפשוטו, שגואל את עם ישראל מהגלות.</p>\n<p>ולכן, הגם שעל עצם הענין שיש משיח בכל דור, מביאים דוגמא מדברי רב על רבינו הקדוש, מ\"מ יש להבחין שאין הנידון דומה לראיה ממש, אלא הוא למעלה מזה באין ערוך. שהרי בדורנו שהוא \"הדור האחרון לגלות והראשון לגאולה\", בודאי שנשיא הדור ש\"הוגה בתורה ועוסק במצות כדוד אביו\" ומלכותו והשפעתו היא בתורת הנגלה והחסידות, ובנוסף לזה מתעסק בכפית כל ישראל ובמלחמות ה', הוא המאחד את שני המשיחים, שני בתי אבות, שבט ומחוקק, והוא מלך המשיח כפשוטו, גואלן של ישראל.</p>\n<p>ויהי רצון, שהרבי מלך המשיח שליט\"א שהוא מזרע דוד ושלמה, מדכורא ומנוקבתא, אשר לוחם מלחמות ה' \"ובכמה ענינים כבר מנצח\", יבוא ויגאלנו ויוציא את עם ישראל ואת כל העולם בהצלחה ובשלום מהמצב הנורא שנמצאים בו, ויוליכנו קוממיות לארצנו בקרוב ממש.</p>\n<p><a

(Score: -1)\n\n<p>There are many reasons to believe that the father of the Tzemach Tzedek, Reb Shalom Shachna, was a direct descendant of Dovid HaMelech.</p>\n\n<p>As a proof for this i will just quote what the The Rebbe Rashab, also a direct descendant of the Tzemach Tzedek, says clearly (Toras Shalom pg. 176): At a farbrengen on Motzaei Shabbos, 21 Kislev 5673, “‘His candle will never be extinguished;’ the light of the Baal Shem Tov will constantly illuminate. Chassidus will, without a doubt, exist until the coming of Moshiach, for ‘Dovid Melech Yisroel chai v’kayam’ – this was the Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid and the Rebbe, and so on, for we are of the seed of Dovid and we will continue until Moshiach. The Rebbe will take us all out.”</p>\n\n<p>Now by the way what you said in your question isnt true as there are many proofs that to be Moshiach, one does not actually have to be a direct descendant – son after son – from Dovid HaMelech, and one who is a matrilineal descendant of Dovid HaMelech can also qualify to be Moshiach. One proof is from רבינו הקדוש. We all know that the Gemara (Sanhedrin 98b) says, “Says Rav: If Moshiach is among the living, he is, for example, Rabbeinu HaKadosh.” This is despite the fact that Tosafos (Sanhedrin 5a) brings down that Rabbeinu HaKadosh says that he is a descendant of the daughter of Dovid.</p>\n\n\n",

However, keep in mind that Hollywood films, esp. this one which was designed in a film era of huge glitz and production (look at the huge cast used in this movie!) tends to blur and exaggerate the truth. I question a number of the various love scenes and romances shown in the film. I'm not sure that Dotan was the constant curmudgeon sly person who was always against Moses about every little item. I don't know where the film gets the idea that he was an advisor to Pharoah.\nOne thing, particularly, seems contradictory. Moses had a speech impediment. In the film, when he speaks to Pharoah, he seems like this clearly spoken ominous speaker with a deep voice. Where did they get that?</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think people can get SOME idea, but, I'm not convinced that it's an accurate depiction of things. It's Hollywood, doing its shtick, after all. The film was not meant to be a documentary.  </p>\n\n\n",

The Torah in the pasuk is speaking of the judicial determination of punishment for damages and the assessment of the <strong>monetary</strong> fine. The death penalty is limited to those cases which are specifically subject to the death penalty.

Nor is there\n  the slightest hint in the Talmud, the principle body of Jewish law\n  that this verse was ever taken literally. It is simply an erroneous\n  assumption based on the literal reading of the verse.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Talmud, in fact, records a lengthy discussion of this verse, (Bava\n  Kama 83b-84a). The Talmudic sages bring a number of compelling proofs,\n  both logically and from the inference of other verses, showing one\n  should not even entertain the thought that \"an eye for an eye\" is to\n  be taken literally. Maimonides, the renowned 12th century sage,\n  further cites the verses in Exodus 21:18-19 which openly speak of\n  damages in terms of monetary payment. Hence, a few verses later when\n  the Torah speaks of \"an eye for and eye…\" it is obviously referring to\n  the same sort of payment. Other early sages bring additional proof: if\n  literal, if the perpetrator injures another and minimizes his sight by\n  one third or half, how is it possible to do the same in punishment, no\n  more and no less?</p>\n  \n  <p>The key principal is that the Torah cannot, and was not meant to be\n  understood literally. Only with the Oral Tradition given together with\n  the written can the Torah be understood correctly and accurately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, the extrajudicial death penalty given by a king is also not muer when done under the specific circumstances and methodologies as set forth in the Oral law (such as for rebellion against the king).</p>\n\n<p>Bais Din also has certain extrajudicial powers as shown in <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Shulchan_Aruch/Choshen_Mishpat/2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Choshen Mishpat 2:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every beit din, even if they weren't ordained in the land of Israel,\n  if they see that the nation is engulfed by sins, <em>(and that it is a\n  need of the time) (Tur)</em>, they can judge both [<strong>life-and-]death and\n  monetary</strong> [cases] and all matters of punishments, and even if there\n  isn't complete testimony. And if he refuses to listen (lit. is mute),\n  they let him be handed over to idol worshipers. <em>(And they have the\n  power to make his money ownerless and to destroy it according to what\n  they see (to guard against the rebelliousness of the generation) (Tur\n  in the name of the Rambam, Sanhedrin chapter 24)</em>.

Note:\n  <em>And similarly, we act like this in every place, that the good people of the city in their city are like the highest beit din, lashing and\n  punishing, and their [decision that something is] ownerless [is in\n  effect and it is considered] ownerless, even though there are those\n  who argue and reason that the good people of the city don't have this\n  power, but only to enlighten the congregation about what were the\n  traditions from oldest times or what [traditions] were accepted by\n  everyone, but they are not permitted to change a matter [whose\n  changing would be] beneficial to some and causing loss to some or that\n  would ? money that is not accepted by everyone (Mordechai, last Perek\n  \"HaGozel\") — nevertheless, they go according to the custom of their\n  city, and all the more so if they had accepted anything on themselves,\n  so it appears to me (and see Yoreh Deah section 228 for laws of\n  decrees and stringencies of a congregation).

    "content": "# Is Tumah an intellectual idea or a physical/spiritual idea\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a difficult question to ask since it is hard to define each term adequately,but will try my best.</p>\n\n<p>Is tumah an intellectual idea, meaning that if something is rendered tamei (impure)  such as a dead body. Do we say that really the dead body has no physical or spiritual effect on anything rather its an intellectual halachic idea (that solely takes place in ones brain) that a dead body is impure and can make other things impure? </p>\n\n<p>The gemara in Beitzah beings a machlokes between Bais Shammai and Bais Hillel concerning a dead body in a house with many closed doorways. In such a case we say that all doorways are considered tamei and make any utensil in the doorway impure as well. However, the gemara notes that if the person decides to take the body out a specific door than retroactively all other doorways will be rendered pure through the concept of breirah (clarification of intent). Bais Shammai argues on this idea. Rava ends off by saying that according to Bais Hillel retroactively everything indeed becomes pure. So according to this opinion how can something become impure and then pure again just based off someones decision (breirah), doesn't a real purification process need to take place? </p>\n\n<p>To me it seems from this gemara that tumah may be an intellectual factor as opposed to a physical taint. I have no proof one way or the other, but this idea came to mind after that piece of gemara and I wondered if anyone ever discussed tumah in these terms.</p>\n\n<p>I vaguely remember seeing that the Rambam believes that many mitzvos are intellectual (in ones mind) as opposed to spiritual changings. Does anyone have any info on this. I apologize in advance if this wasn't so clear.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>In the abstract</strong>: According to Rambam, the laws of impurity are not related to intrinsic spiritual status. They are rather legal categories that relate to historic social psychological perceptions.</p>\n<p>Rambam has a chapter in Moreh Nevukhim (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp183.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:47</a>) devoted to ritual impurity. It seems worthwhile to see the entire chapter. The following is an elided translation of the text, with the portions most relevant to the question emphasised:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I maintain that the Law which was revealed to Moses, our Teacher, and which is called by his name, aims at facilitating the service and lessening the burden, and <strong>if a person complains that certain precepts cause him pain and great trouble, he cannot have thought of the habits and doctrines that were general in those days</strong>...</p>\n<p>This is the great principle which you must never lose sight of. After having stated this principle, I repeat that <strong>the whole intention with regard to the sanctuary was to create in the hearts of those who enter it certain feelings of awe and reverence</strong>, in accordance with the command, \"You shall reverence my sanctuary\" (Lev. xix. 30). But when we continually see an object, however sublime it may be, our regard for that object will be lessened, and the impression we have received of it will be weakened...</p>\n<p><strong>For this reason the unclean were not allowed to enter the Sanctuary</strong>, although there are so many kinds of uncleanliness, that [at a time] only a few people are clean. For even if a person does not touch a beast that died of its own accord (Lev. xi. 27), he can scarcely avoid touching one of the eight kinds of creeping animals (ibid. 29, seq.), the dead bodies of which we find at all times in houses, in food and drink, and upon which we frequently tread wherever we walk; and, if he avoids touching these, he may touch a woman in her separation (ibid. xv. 18), or a male or female that have a running issue (ibid. ver. 1, seq. and 25, seq.), or a leper (ibid. xiii. 46), or their bed (ibid. xv. 5). Escaping these, he may become unclean by cohabitation with his wife, or by pollution (ibid. 15), and even when he has cleansed himself from any of these kinds of uncleanliness, he cannot enter the Sanctuary till after sunset; but not being enabled to enter the Sanctuary at night time, although he is clean after sunset, as may be inferred from Middot and Tamid, he is again, during the night, subject to becoming unclean either by cohabiting with his wife or by some other source of uncleanliness, and may rise in the morning in the same condition as the day before. <strong>All this serves to keep people away from the Sanctuary, and to prevent them from entering it whenever they liked</strong>...</p>\n<p>The easier the diffusion of uncleanliness is, the more difficult and the more retarded is its purification...The uncleanness caused by a woman having running issue or during her separation is more frequent than that caused by contact with unclean objects: seven days are therefore required for their purification (Lev. xv. 19, 28), whilst those that touch them are only unclean one day</p>\n<p><strong>All these cases of uncleanliness</strong>, viz., running issue of males or females, menstruations, leprosy, dead bodies of human beings, carcasses of beasts and creeping things, and issue of semen, <strong>are disgusting</strong>. We have thus shown that the above precepts are very useful in many respects. <strong>First, they keep us at a distance from disgusting things</strong>; <strong>secondly, they guard the Sanctuary</strong>; <strong>thirdly, they pay regard to an established custom (for the Sabeans submitted to very troublesome restrictions when unclean</strong>, as you will soon hear); <strong>fourthly, they lightened that burden for us; for we are not impeded through these laws in our ordinary occupations</strong> <strong>by the distinction the Law makes between that which is unclean and that which is clean. For this distinction applies only in reference to the Sanctuary</strong> and the holy objects connected with it: it does not apply to other cases...</p>\n<p><strong>Other persons [that do not intend to enter the Sanctuary or touch any holy thing], are not guilty of any sin if they remain unclean</strong> as long as they like, and eat, according to their pleasure, ordinary food that has been in contact with unclean things. <strong>But the practice of the Sabeans... was to keep a menstruous woman in a house by herself</strong>, to burn that upon which she treads, and to consider as unclean every one that speaks with her: even if a wind passed over her and a clean person, the latter was unclean in the eyes of the Sabeans. <strong>See the difference between this practice and our rule</strong>, that \"whatever services a wife generally does to her husband, she may do to him in her separation\"; only cohabitation is prohibited during the days of her uncleanness.</p>\n<p>Another custom among the Sabeans, which is still widespread, is this: whatever is separated from the body, as hair, nail, or blood, is unclean... whenever a person passes a razor over his skin he must take a bath in running water. <strong>Such burdensome practices were numerous among the Sabeans, whilst we apply the laws that distinguish between the unclean and the clean only with regard to hallowed things and to the Sanctuary.</strong>...</p>\n<p>As it was very necessary that the high-priest should always be in the Sanctuary, in accordance with the Divine command, \"And it shall always be on his forehead\" (Exod. xxviii. 38), he was not permitted to defile himself by any dead body whatever, even of the above-named relatives (Lev. xxi. 10-12). Women were not engaged in sacrificial service; the above law consequently does not apply to women; it is addressed to \"the sons of Aaron,\" and not to \"the daughters of Aaron.\" (Friedlander translation with some corrections based on Pines).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a similar vein, he writes in Hilkhot Tumat Okhlin (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/a616.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">16:14</a>) that the point of abstaining from impurity even when not mandated by the Law, is as a social technique to avoid the stratum of society that does not avoid it. Rather than seeing any spiritual benefit in purity (as does for example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.2?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his commentary</a> to Leviticus (19:2)), he explains it purely socially:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על פי שמותר לאכול אוכלין טמאים ולשתות משקין טמאים, חסידים הראשונים היו אוכלין חוליהן בטהרה ונזהרין מן הטומאות כולן כל ימיהן; והן הנקראין פרושים.  ודבר זה קדושה יתרה היא, ודרך חסידות שיהיה אדם נבדל ופורש משאר העם, ולא ייגע בהן ולא יאכל וישתה עימהן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, he writes in Hilkhot Issurei Biah (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5121.htm#12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">21:12</a>) that the reason for the original enactment that a <em>ba'al keri</em> refrain from studying Torah, is in order to generally decrease sexual activity; not because there is something wrong with being impure:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא תיקנו בראשונה לבעלי קראין שלא יקראו בתורה עד שיטבולו, אלא כדי למעט בתשמיש המיטה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>In Summary</strong>:</p>\n<p>(Which inevitably is tainted by my own understanding): The laws of impurity are structured to achieve desired ends. Rambam does not mention any intrinsic spiritual characteristic to ritual impurity. Rather, it seems that the primary focus of ritual impurity is as a means of limiting casual access to the Temple, and thereby concretising feeling of awe towards it. The length of time for various forms of impurity seems correlated not to the intrinsic characteristic of each form of impurity, but rather to the psychological effects thereof. The more common an encounter causes it, the less severe it is treated, and vice-versa. This fits with the idea that the point is to surround the Temple with an aura of awe. Things perceived as more normal and common pollutants require less pause, than those perceived as more abnormal.</p>\n<p>This idea of impurity as a historic perceived characteristic (which in turn related to legal statuses) is part of Rambam's general scheme of viewing the mitsvot as relating particularly to the social and religious norms of the time. In our case, Rambam develops this into an additional reason for the laws of impurity; they relate to social and religious norms of the Sabean idolaters. In this case, they tended to be more stringent with many of these sources of impurity. The Torah's laws are meant then to provide an easier alternative to the Sabean system, meant specifically to engender respect for the Temple, and to avoid restrictive superstitions regarding menstruants, and other sources of impurity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Fascinatingly, note Hilkhot Miqvaot (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/a811.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">11:15</a>) in which Rambam emphasises that the laws of impurity are not intuitive, and are certainly not meant to remove physical dirt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר ברור וגלוי שהטומאות והטהרות גזירת הכתוב הן, ואינן מדברים שדעתו של אדם מכרעת אותן, והרי הן מכלל החוקים; וכן הטבילה מן הטומאות, מכלל החוקים היא:  שאין הטומאה טיט או צואה שתעבור במים, אלא גזירת הכתוב היא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My impression (particularly in context of the above) is that he is emphasising that the laws of impurity are not the result of substances' characteristics. Rather, their classification is the result of their very externally imposed legal status!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the purpose of a Modaah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Bava Basra (40b) discusses the law of the Modaah, and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דלא כתיב בה אנן ידעינן ביה באונסא דפלניא לאו מודעא היא מודעא דמאי אי דגיטא ודמתנתא גלויי מילתא בעלמא היא ואי דזביני והאמר רבא לא כתבינן מודעא אזביני לעולם דזביני מודי רבא היכא דאניס וכמעשה דפרדיסא דההוא גברא דמשכין פרדיסא לחבריה לתלת שנין בתר דאכלה תלת שני חזקה אמר אי מזבנת לי מוטב ואי לא כבישנא לשטר משכנתא ואמינא לקוחה היא בידי כה\"ג כתבינן מודעא:</p>\n<p>that does not have written in it the formulation: We are aware of so-and-so’s duress, i.e., we are aware of the nature of the coercion that forced him to enter this arrangement against his will, is not a valid preemptive declaration. For what type of transaction is the preemptive declaration being stated? If one were to say that it is a preemptive declaration for a bill of divorce or for a gift, the preemptive declaration is merely revealing the matter. Since these actions can’t take place unless he desires it, it is sufficient that he stated that he does not desire them, and he need not specify a particular reason for nullifying them. And if it is for a sale, but doesn’t Rava say: We do not write a preemptive declaration for a sale? The Gemara answers: Actually, it is referring to a preemptive declaration for a sale, as Rava concedes in a case where one was compelled to act due to a threat of monetary loss, as with the incident of the orchard, as there was a certain man who mortgaged his orchard to another for three years. After he worked and profited from it for the three years necessary for establishing the presumption of ownership, he said: If you sell the orchard to me, it is well. And if not, then I will hide the mortgage document and I will say that this land is purchased and that is why it is in my possession, and you will receive no payment for the orchard. In a case like this, we write a preemptive declaration. The declaration states that he does not actually desire to sell his property but was forced to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It looks like the point is to cancel a fishy sale in advance.</p>\n<p>But what's the point?</p>\n<p>If such sales shouldn't be valid, then make them invalid. And if you can cancel a Modaah, then any robber worth his salt will just force him to write a Bittul Modaah before the contract.</p>\n\n\n",

What would be the Peshara?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Beis HaVaad writes, </p>\n\n<p>\"Since no Divine name is used for a Shevuas Heses, the various tactics that instill fear mentioned earlier are not necessary, but Bais Din should nevertheless try to put pressure on the litigants to come to an agreement without resorting to an oath. </p>\n\n<p>As is apparent from the above, making a false oath is a serious matter. For this reason, some Miforshim (Rashi, Rema) discontinued the use of a real Shevua in Bais Din, and substituted it instead with an Arur, or curse, in the presence of a Minyan. Since there are indications in the Gemara (Shevuos 39B) and Yerushalmi (Shevuos 6,5) that even a truthful oath is a cause of misfortune, the common practice in Betei Din is to offer the alternative of a Pshara, or compromise, instead of a Shevua. The accepted custom regarding this compromise is that the litigant who would normally have to swear forgoes a third of his claim, and thus frees himself of his obligation. The Divrei Malkiel (2, 133) and Igros Moshe (CH.M., 1, 32) add that this is merely the rule of thumb in the absence of any factor pointing to either side of the dispute, otherwise, wisdom should be used in order to determine the right terms for this compromise. R’Nissan Karelitz (quoted in Mishpetei Tzedek, P. 63) says that only when a Shevua Miderabbanan is in question is a third considered to be a sufficient deduction, but if one wishes to be absolved of a Shevua Mideoraisa, he must in turn relinquish half of his claim.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thehalachacenter.org/journal-links/5775/devarim/eikev/the-basic-procedure-of-a-shevua-in-bais-din.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.thehalachacenter.org/journal-links/5775/devarim/eikev/the-basic-procedure-of-a-shevua-in-bais-din.php</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why can a husband eat with his wife who is a niddah in public without a heker?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are various <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Harchakot_of_Niddah\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>harchakot</em></a> (separations) that a husband and wife must observe when she is a <em>niddah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>When I learned these <em>halachot</em> before I got married I learned that the husband and wife may not eat together when she is a <em>niddah</em> without setting some kind of object on the table to serve as a <em>heker</em> or reminder. I also learned that this rule only applies when the husband and wife are eating together privately but does not apply when other people are present. <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/fotf/foundation-of-the-family-3258946\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This book</a> (written by someone I know and reviewed by R' Doniel Pransky, Rosh Kollel of the Atlanta Scholars Kollel [someone I trust]) confirms that exception.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, why does this particular <em>harchaka</em> not apply in public? What is the difference between eating together without a reminder and all the other <em>harchakot</em> such as passing something from one spouse to the other (which we don't do even in public)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(Note: All sources were found and learned through the Sefer Mareh Kohen on Hilchos Niddah)</p>\n\n<p>Eating together, per the Rosh, is something that engenders closeness between the couple, and during the days of Niddah, certain actions are prohibited in order to limit the closeness between the couple. This specific Harchokah seems to be unique in the sense that, according to some opinions, once the couple are no longer eating alone, the Harchokah no longer applies (this seems to be, for lack of a better word, a 'subjective' application by the Poskim of what is considered 'engendering closeness').</p>\n\n<p>It seems to be that regarding this Harchokah, some Poskim have concluded that having other people around lowers the amount of 'Kurvah' of the action to permit it. Note that by the Harchokah of sitting on a swinging bench, the Rama also says that having someone sit between them removes the Harchokah.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the reason why handing an item in public is different:</p>\n\n<p>The Machzor Vitri brings down that Rashi was careful to not hand anything to his wife during Niddah, although no reason is given in that work. In later works, two reasons were given: The Bais Yosef says that the reason was to avoid accidentally touching his wife, while the Rashba gave the reason as it engenders a feeling a closeness between the husband and wife (note: @mevaqesh noted that the Rashba in Toras Habayis (7:2) gives the reason as preventing touching. Unfortunately, the Mareh Kohen does not source where the Rashba says this opinion, although he does attribute it to the Rashba).</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (as it was written by the Bais Yosef), brings down the reason of accidental touching as the reason for this Harchokah. As a result, this Harchokah would apply in all scenarios, regardless of who is around at the time. This also seems to be the accepted reason for this Harchokah.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, even if you held that the reason was according to the Rashba, you might still not be allowed to hand an item directly to your wife who is a Niddah in a public setting. With regards to eating at the same table with your wife who is a Niddah, the Rashba is the most stringent of opinions, and holds that even if people are sitting between the couple, a Heker is still needed on the table. It may be a case of conflicting opinions for one to hold like the Rashba for handing items, but not for sitting at a table without a Heker (although that is quite debatable).</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Meir would analyze names and discern one’s nature from his name, while Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei were not apt to analyze names. When they came to a certain place, they looked for lodging and were given it. They said to the innkeeper: What is your name? He said to them: My name is Kidor. Rabbi Meir said to himself: Perhaps one can learn from this that he is a wicked person, as it is stated: “For they are a generation [ki dor] of upheavals” (Deuteronomy 32:20). Since it was Friday afternoon, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei entrusted their purses to him. Rabbi Meir did not entrust his purse to him but went and placed it at the grave of the innkeeper’s father. The innkeeper’s father appeared to the innkeeper in a dream and said to him: Go take the purse placed at the head of that man, i.e., the innkeeper’s father. The following day, he said to the Sages: This is what appeared to me in my dream. They said to him: Dreams during twilight on Shabbat evening have no substance and should not be trusted. Even so, Rabbi Meir went and guarded his money all that day and then took it. The next day, the rabbis said to the innkeeper: Give us our purses. He said to them: These matters never occurred; you never gave me any purses. Rabbi Meir said to them: Why didn’t you analyze his name to learn that he is a wicked man? They said to him: Why didn’t the Master tell us? He said to them: I said one should be suspicious, but have I said a person should be established as wicked? Could I say to you with certainty that he is wicked based on his name alone? What did they do? They dragged the innkeeper and brought him to a store and gave him wine to drink. After he drank the wine, they saw lentils on his mustache, showing that he had eaten lentils that day. They went and gave this sign to his wife. They said that the innkeeper had ordered that their money be returned to them upon the sign that he ate lentils at his last meal. And they took their purses and went. He went and killed his wife out of anger that she did this. This is as we learned in a baraita: Due to a person’s laxity in the first washing, they fed him pork. There was an innkeeper who was accustomed to feed pork to gentiles and kosher meat to Jews. He distinguished between Jews and gentiles by watching to see whether they performed the ritual hand-washing before eating. One time, a Jew came and ate without washing his hands before the meal, and the innkeeper gave him pork to eat. Laxity in the final washing, the washing of one’s hands and mouth after a meal, caused the innkeeper to kill the person. This is similar to that story, as had the wicked innkeeper washed his mouth, the rabbis would not have known that he had eaten lentils. And in the end, they too, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, would analyze names. When they came to a house of a landlord named Bala, they did not enter. They said: Conclude from here that he is certainly wicked, as it is written: “I said of her who was worn out [bala] by adulteries” (Ezekiel 23:43), as it states: “After I am grown old [beloti] shall I have pleasure?” (Genesis 18:12). “Worn out by adulteries” means aged through adulteries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Talmud, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=7b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 7b</a>, says (copied from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.7b.9-10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רות מאי רות א\"ר יוחנן שזכתה ויצא ממנה דוד שריוהו להקב\"ה בשירות ותשבחות</p>\n<p>Continuing on the topic of names, the Gemara asks: What is the meaning of the name Ruth?

But in Yedid Nefesh, we are talking about how long we have been yearning for this, not that we hope to see it soon.

The Midrash Genesis/Bereshit Raba 17:4 tells us that the first man, Adam, looked into the essence and nature of every creature and named it accordingly; meaning He analysed the essence and nature of each one and thereby deduce its name. In Hebrew a name of anything is an expression its essence and nature. The donkey, for example, is characterized by carrying heavy, physical burdens. So in Hebrew, the donkey is named chamor – from the same root as chomer, which means materialism (<a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/l/b/48961326.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from the Aish website</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Now I was taught that in Hebrew, a noun is called a shem etzem (“name of essence”), while an adjective is called a shem toar (“name of description”). \nWhat I would like to know is what a human name, a proper noun, describes, what does a name do: does a name desribe our essence, does a name give a description of who we are, or could a name be given in the hope a child develops itself into the essence of his name?</p>\n\n<p>In summary: Does a name (in Jewish teachings) add anything to our development into who we are/become?</p>\n\n\n",

However, he did not explain his reasoning.</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One possibility could be <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.184.1?lang=bi&with=Mishnah%20Berurah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O Ch 184 (1)</a> which says that a person should say grace before he moves from where he ate. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִי שֶׁאוֹכֵל בְּמָקוֹם אֶחָד, צָרִיךְ לְבָרֵךְ קֹדֶם שֶׁיַּעֲקֹר\n  מִמְּקוֹמוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>MB [1] says that from one corner to another in a large house is still alright even if you cannot see your original place from where you say grace. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א) קודם שיעקור - ומפינה לפינה אפילו הבית גדול מותר ואפילו כשאין רואה\n  מקומו הראשון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You probably know this and because you are eating and learning in the shul or associated rooms allow yourself this exception. </p>\n\n<p>Could it be that your Rav sees the expression of the Shulchan Oruch as being the ideal situation (not to move) whereas even from  one corner to another is somehow not ideal. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara discusses largely in Arvei Pesachim (tractate <em>Pesachim</em> 100–106) the problems of Havdalah at Seuda Shelishit, and the problem of leaving without bentsching. In <em>Chullin</em> 86b–87a, it discusses whether or not it's an interruption to leave in the middle of a meal to pray.</p>\n<p>I shall separate your question into several sub-questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you come back from Maariv to bentsch where you ate, do you need to say <em>Retzei</em>? In other words, is it not contradictory to say <em>Retzei</em> after <em>Ata Chonantanu</em> and an entire weekday prayer?</li>\n<li>If we decide to answer to Question 1 that you cannot say <em>Retzei</em>, is there a reason to make all your possible to say <em>Retzei</em>?</li>\n<li>Is it allowed to leave the meal place without bentsching, <em>l'chatchila</em>, if you plan to continue the meal later? The same question may be asked if you clearly decided to finish yet the meal.</li>\n<li>When you leave to go pray, were there some people who stayed at the table and kept eating?</li>\n<li>Must you immediately make Havdalah, either via Maariv or on a cup or both, at nightfall?</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Bentsching for a Shabbat meal on Motza'ei Shabbat</strong>. The Gemara (Berachot 27b) discusses about praying of Shabbat on Erev Shabbat or of Motza'ei Shabbat on Shabbat. In Pesachim 105b, we see that we need delay the end of Shabbat as late as possible, to show that Shabbat is not a burden to us. We can conclude that we need to continue to keep all the laws of Shabbat and to say <em>Retzei</em>, even if we bentsch after nightfall. <em>Orach Chaim 188:10</em> says that the reason to say <em>Retzei</em> is because the meal time is determined by when the meal started, not when it ended. See <em>Magen Avraham</em> at s\"k 17, who says that despite that, after Maariv, he cannot say <em>Retzei</em> because it's a <strong>self contradiction</strong> to pray the weekday Maariv and then the Shabbat bentsching. <em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 271:6</em> discusses whether the starting time or the ending time is the criterion. A <em>nafka mina</em> is that, if he already eat before Shabbat, and Shabbat entered before that, he had the time to bentsch (he already washed <em>mayim achronim</em> or said \"hav lan venivrich\"). He needs to bench on a first cup and then make <em>Kiddush</em> on a second cup. Concerning adding <em>Retzei</em> to the bentsching, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> reports this doubt. In <em>Beit Yosef</em> there, this question is reported in the name of the <em>Rosh</em> in a <em>sugya</em> in <em>Pesachim</em>. Is <em>Retzei</em> a duty linked to the blessing momentum, or to the eating momentum? The Rosh says that, e.g. the prayer of <em>tashlumin</em> of Shabbat Mincha made on Motza'ei Shabbat needs to be a weekday prayer. The <em>Beit Yosef</em> concludes according to the <em>Orchot Chaim</em> who that the starting time is the criterion. If he wants to continue the meal, this is another broad issue in the <em>rishonim</em>, not linked directly to other question.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>To leave the place of eating before bentsching</strong>. In <em>Pesachim 101b</em>, there are some examples in which it seems you may leave the meal with the intent to return and resume later. According to the <em>Rashbam</em> there, a special reason is needed to leave before bentsching, e.g. to eat elsewhere or <em>mehirut Chatan and Kallah</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Permission to leave without bentsching there is found only when they plan to return and resume eating (Rashi <em>s.v.</em> \"keshehen yots'in\"). It seems from the <em>sugya</em> that, if you don't plan to resume eating, it's forbidden to leave before bentsching. Even if you do plan to continue eating, you must make Havdalah on a cup before continuing (<em>Pesachim</em> 105a).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you prayed Maariv without changing your place (as you said in a comment). The first <em>Tosafos</em> in <em>Chullin</em> 87a reports two opinions about prayer in mid-meal. The first opinion, in the name of Rabbeinu Yom Tov, is that blessing or praying are interruptions, since one cannot pray and eat simultaneously. The second opinion is that an additional necessary condition is needed to create an interruption the interrupting act should be the end of something. (¹)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is the pre-Maariv Torah study a sufficient reason to delay bentsching until after Maariv? I don't know what to think.</p>\n<p><strong>From the example of the Rabbeinu Yom Tov, we can perhaps see that he was allowing prayer before bentsching.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>(¹): This part of the question is very well illustrated by the Chiddushei Ha'Rashba:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משתא וברוכי בהדי הדדי לא אפשר:    יש מרבותינו הצרפתים ז\"ל שהיה מוכיח מכאן דפעמים שאדם  <strong>נזכר בתוך סעודתו שעדיין לא התפלל</strong>  ומתפלל בתוך סעודתו, טעון ברכה למפרע, ואחר כך נוטל ידיו ובוצע, משום דמיכלי וצלויי בהדי הדדי לא אפשר, וכדאמרינן הכא דמשתי וברוכי בהדי הדדי לא אפשר.  <strong>וזו דעת רבינו אלפסי ז\"ל</strong>  בפסחים בערבי פסחים גבי ארבע כוסות,  <strong>והרב בעל התוס' ז\"ל</strong>  כתב דלא דמו כלל, דברכת המזון הוא דחשוב הפסק וכן כיסוי אי לאו טעמא דאפשר למשחט וכסוי בהדי הדדי משום דהני גמר מעשה נינהו, אבל תפילה לא הוי גמר והפסק דאטו מי שברך על הזיקים ועל הזועות בתוך סעודתו או אפילו בורא פרי הגפן מי חשבינן ליה הפסק וחוזר ומברך המוציא משום דמיכל וברוכי בהדי הדדי לא אפשר, ובהדיא אמרינן התם בפרק ערבי פסחים (קב, א) עקרו רגליהם לילך לבית הכנסת והניחו שם מקצת חברי' כשהן חוזרין אינן טעונין ברכה למפרע ולא לכתחילה, ואף על פי שמסתמא התפללו בנתים, וזו היא דעת  <strong>רבי זרחיה ז\"ל</strong>  שם בפרק ערבי פסחים, וזה נ\"ל עיקר, ויש עוד ראיות אחרות.‏</p>\n<p>There was a French rabbi who was giving a proof from tractate <em>Chullin</em> which says that blessing is an interruption regarding meals, because blessing and eating together is impossible. The rule is as follows: If someone was eating and remembers that hasn't yet prayed, and he prays in mid-meal, after praying he must say the <em>berachah achronah</em> {in <em>Tosafos</em> too, <em>bentsching</em> is explicitly addressed but not in the <em>Rosh</em> there, and in Tur Orach Chaim 178. This is linked to another disagreement between the Rif and the Baal Ha'maor regarding two motsi for one <em>bentsching</em>.} and then wash his hands and bless <em>Ha'motzi</em> a second time on the bread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rema on <em>Orach Chaim</em> 178:2 said that, for a mitzvah, it's okay to leave without <em>bentsching</em>, e.g. to go pray. See <em>Biur Halacha</em> there. Also see Beit Yosef, which compares the din of <em>Tefila</em> to the lecture (Maggid) interposed between the first and second cups of wine at the seder.</p>\n<p>--> To bentsh before praying Maariv without changing locations. From the Rema, if it is a <em>mitzvah overet</em>, i.e. the only minyan is here and now, --> Not necessarily,</p>\n<p>For a <em>mitsva lo overet</em> --> Yes, this is an obligation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The simplest way to approach this is to find if there is an opinion that requires you to say Retze even after praying, such that ruling otherwise is taking a leniency which could have been avoided by saying grace earlier.</p>\n\n<p>In the similar case of a Purim meal which lasted past dark, the Magen Avraham (OC 695 sk 9) quotes the opinions regarding Shabbat that after praying Maariv one no longer mentions the previous day, but also notes an opinion that says you would still say Al HaNisim in grace even after praying Maariv. Accordingly he recommends saying grace before praying to avoid the issue (and this is cited in the Mishna Berura there). So at first glance the same would apply in your case.</p>\n\n<p>However, Har HaCarmel (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45199&st=&pgnum=14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 7</a>) writes that Maariv after Shabbat is different because it contains Havdala and actively contradicts the day of Shabbat, whereas Maariv on 15 Adar doesn't contain anything that actively contradicts Purim. Moreover, he notes that Al HaNissim in grace on 15 Adar isn't such a contradiction anyway since 15 Adar is also related to Purim (cf. Taz OC 693 sk 3). The Arukh haShulchan (OC 695:11) writes that the opinion the Magen Avraham found to recite Al HaNisim after Maariv was referring to a case where Maariv was prayed early such that the grace is still being said before sundown [this isn't very convincing because Purim is before the vernal equinox -- AA]. According to these opinions, there might not be an opinion that requires Retze even after Maariv on Saturday night.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you conclude that no opinion requires Retze after Maariv practically, I think a reasonable argument could be made to avoid the situation from the Magen Avraham (OC 188 sk 17) who writes about not saying Retze after Maariv:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואף על גב דלפי הטעם דאזלינן בתר התחלת הסעודה א\"כ אפילו צלי ערבית ה\"ל להזכיר צ\"ל משום דמחזי כסתרי אהדדי וכמ\"ש סוף סימן ל' וא\"כ אפילו התפלל מבע\"י אינו מזכיר<br>\n  Even though based on the rule to follow the start of the meal you would have to mention [Retze] even after praying, we must say [to explain why we don't] that it looks like a contradiction...so we don't say [Retze]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From his language it sounds like there's a desire to have been able to say Retze were you not stuck having to avoid a contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, perhaps we can be concerned that you will forget the Havdala insertion in Maariv and then you'd have to decide if Retze is still a contradiction to your weekday Amida which didn't explicitly end Shabbat (similar to the Har HaCarmel's discussion by Purim). To preempt this question it may be worth trying to say grace first.</p>\n\n<p>How far out of the way to go to be careful about this is a question for your local rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

But what exactly do these verses add? The story was completed back in chapter 9. What do we gain by having chapter 10?</p>\n\n<p>Already checked Torah Temimah, which just quotes the Gemara in Megillah as saying Achashveirosh was called as such for bankrupting the people, as recorded in 10:1. It's more of a drash explanation, though - is there a more pashut pshat one?</p>\n\n<p>To that end I checked my Mikraos Gedolos, where the mefarshim seemed to focus on explaining the words and sentences rather than how it fits into the story as a whole. I could be missing something, or your Mikraos Gedolos might have different mefarshim than mine, so feel free to check my work. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, I checked the Malbim, who asked the question and answers it by saying it's addressing how successful Mordechai was in his new position of power. Although he's addressing passuk aleph, it seems that it would be a more fitting comment to passuk gimmel. Plus, is that not already discussed back in 8:16?</p>\n\n\n",

As such, in the context of your question which is phrased in the present, it might be, that they can't do much if they do not exist.</p>\n<p>However, it is worth noting as far as their 'remit' - the term \"mazikim\" is in the hiphil - the causative conjunction, to mean that they cause damage. It is precisely this idea of potential physical harm and damage that is suggested in numerous occasions throughout Shas. I know you said not to bring specific examples - but I will list a couple of instances just to showcase this point: - In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.3a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 3b</a> we are warned not to visit a building site alone lest we encounter these mazikim. It is this sense of solitude in which these beings thrive. The Maharal in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14202&st=&pgnum=7&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נתיבות עולם - נתיב התורה פרק א</a> notes that places that are uninhabited, lack any human presence meaning they are alienated from the world’s essence. The world’s essence is 'ישוב' - <em>settlement</em>. Ruins and similar are apart from settlement; Therefore malevolent forces [פגעים], which are in discord with the world, dominate. Thus they are drawn to, and pray on passing individuals.</p>\n<p>The Gemoro later in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.6a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 6a</a> again alludes to how they essentially cause damage including painful feet and worn out clothes. It would seem that possibly they have an innate desire to cause damage and it would seem that this damage is indeed physical in nature.</p>\n<p>This sense of potential harm that they bring is something that is codified in Halocho. So, although the Magen Avrohom cited above and others opine that they do not physically exist - we are still left with a halachic requirement as a make-safe against such a presence. Halocho (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 4:2-4</a>) dictates that when awakening in the morning, a person must wash his or her hands (three times) to remove Ru’ach Ra’ah. Until one does so, one must be careful not to touch the mouth, nose, eyes or ears so as not to allow the Ru’ach Ra’ah to enter into the body. HaRav Moshe Sternbach shlita in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20025&st=&pgnum=12&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תשובות והנהגות, חלק א סימן ח</a> notes that this concept of Ruach Ra'ah is not to be taken lightly and that these spiritual forces that can impact negatively on both the body and soul. He thus concludes that one should be, \"ליזהר בזה מאד במאד\" - \"<em>To be extrememly cautious</em>\".</p>\n<p>Moreover, the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8140&st=&pgnum=24&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(כף החיים (ד:יט</a> notes that the physical danger goes hand-in-hand with the potential spiritual damage. If a person touches one eyes and ears before washing, they will become no different to a deaf or blind person (chas veshalom) which by extension, will adversely affect their entire spiritual existence through an inability to learn Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>Jewish Encyclopedia</em> in the article 'demonology' ( <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5085-demonology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5085-demonology</a>)                  states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the main demons were workers of harm.

And if so, how can it be permissible to go to war against a nation (מלחמת רשות / discretionary war) which involves killing human beings ? As opposed to a מלחמת מצווה, \"War by commandment\" where G-d explicitly commanded to conquer the nation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_ben_Nathan\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Raavan</a> (12th cent.) writes that the prohibition against murder includes killing non Jews:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ראב\"ן בבא קמא </p>\n  \n  <p>וכ\"ש שאסור לגנוב לגוי דלא תגנוב דומיא דלא תרצח ולא תנאף דהוי בין לישראל בין לגוי. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam, on the other hand, writes (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/b501.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilkhot Rotseah 1:1</a>) that that particular prohibition only applies to Jews:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל הורג נפש אדם מישראל--עובר בלא תעשה, שנאמר \"לא תרצח\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, he writes (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/b502.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rotseah 2:11</a>) that even if one kills a <em>ger toshav</em> he is not punished by the court:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישראל שהרג גר תושב--אינו נהרג עליו בבית דין, שנאמר \"וכי יזיד איש על ריעהו\" (שמות כא,יד); ואין צריך לומר שאינו נהרג על הגוי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it is completely forbidden. Rambam writes (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1410.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilkhot Avodah Zara 10:1</a>) that even if one sees a gentile worshiping idols it is still forbidden to kill him:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם ראה גוי עובד עבודה זרה ...לאבדו בידו, או לדוחפו לבור, וכיוצא בזה--אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kessef Mishneh (Rotseah 2:11) cites the Mekhilta that the punishment for killing a gentile will be imposed by God, although not by the courts. The Kessef Mishneh understands that in this vein, Rambam understands the such a killer is liable to death at the hands of heaven, rather than through the court:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הלכה יא\n  [יא] ישראל שהרג גר תושב וכו'. במכילתא וכי יזיד איש על רעהו רעהו להוציא את אחרים ומשמע לרבינו דגר תושב בכלל אחרים כמו שהוא לענין גלות כמו שיתבאר. איסי בן עקיבא אומר קודם מתן תורה היינו מוזהרים על שפיכות דמים לאחר מתן תורה שהוחמרו הוקלו <strong>באמת אמרו פטור מדיני ב\"ו ודינם מסור לשמים. וזהו שכתב רבינו אינו נהרג עליו בב\"ד כלומר אבל בדיני שמים חייב</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is answers the first part of your question, and constitutes my primary answer.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding the second part of the question, of why a <em>milhemet r'shut</em> doesn't violate this, it should first be noted that murdering Jews is also a violation of \n<em>lo tirtsah</em>. Nevertheless, it is sometimes permissible to kill Jews, (such as all those who are liable to death by the courts). Similarly, there can be a prohibition to murder gentiles, but a person may not always be forbidden from doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding <em>milhemet r'shut</em> in particular, it should be noted that according to Rambam (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/e506.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilkhot Melakhim 6:1</a>) a war may only be initiated after overtures for peace are made. If they accept the 7 Noahide laws, war may not be waged against them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין עושין מלחמה עם אדם בעולם, עד שקוראין לו לשלום--אחד מלחמת הרשות, ואחד מלחמת מצוה:  שנאמר \"כי תקרב אל עיר, להילחם עליה--וקראת אליה, לשלום\" (דברים כ,י).  אם השלימו, וקיבלו שבע מצוות שנצטוו בני נוח עליהן--אין הורגין מהן נשמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The consensus seems to be that it's \"Lo Sirtzach\". This is clearly the view held by the Raavan (Bava Kama 113 (as mentioned before)), the Ramban (on \"Lo Sirtzach\"), The Sefer Hachinuch (on \"Lo Sirtzach\"), Rabbeinu Bachaye (Parshas Bishalach)(he doesn't say it straight out, but it can be inferred) and the Meam Loaz (Parshas Yisro). Additionally, the Mechilta says (Mishpatim) that killing a gentile is exempt from death by the courts but receives a heavenly death penalty, which seems to assume that it's \"Lo Sirtzach\". The Mesech Chochmah (Mishpatim)and Rav Moshe Shternbuch (Teshuvos vihanhagos Chelek 1, the last 2 Teshuvos in Choshen Mishpat) bring this Mechilta down Halacha Limaaseh.</p>\n<p>The Meshech Chochma suggests (Parshas Mishpatim (in his 2nd answer)) that the reason why someone who murders a gentile is exempt from the courts is not because it is worse that killing a Jew, but to the contrary. Because, in addition to the murder there is a huge Chillul Hashem as well, the murderer does not even deserve a\nKaparah.</p>\n<p>In regards to war, Milchemes Harishus must be done based on the Urim Vitumim. Additionally, there is a factor of a \"Rodef\". By definition, when a war is being fought the enemy wants to kill the other sides soliders, and as such each solider may have the status of a Rodef. This is the context behind the statement \"Tov Shebagoyim Taharog\" (Yerushalim Kiddushin). While misinterpreted by by the gentiles throughout the centuries, this statement is referring specifically to a time of war, because each solider is considered a Rodef. (See Tosafos Avodah Zarah, and Rambam Hilchos Avodah Zarah).</p>\n\n\n",

The Shulchan Aruch in one place (O\"C, 24:5) says that the person should be looking at the tztitzit that are in front of him because they have a certain number of knots etc.\nכְּשֶׁמִּסְתַּכֵּל בַּצִּיצִיּוֹת מִסְתַּכֵּל בְּב' צִיצִיּוֹת שֶׁלְּפָנָיו, שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהֶם עֲשָׂרָה קְשָׁרִים, רֶמֶז לַהֲוָיוֹת. וְגַם יֵשׁ בָּהֶם ט''ז חוּטִים וַעֲשָׂרָה קְשָׁרִים עוֹלוֹת כ''ו כְּשֵׁם הַהֲוָיָה</p>\n<p>However, the O\"C in 8:12 also <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.8.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a> \"אִם יֵשׁ לוֹ כַּמָּה בְּגָדִים שֶׁל אַרְבַּע כְּנָפוֹת כֻּלָּם חַיָּבִים בְּצִיצִית. וְאִם לְבָשָׁם כֻּלָּם בְּלֹא הֶפְסֵק וְהָיָה דַּעְתּוֹ מִתְּחִלָּה עַל כֻּלָּם, לֹא יְבָרֵךְ אֶלָּא בְּרָכָה אַחַת\"\nIf one has many four cornered garments, all of them are obligated to have fringes. And if one puts them all on without a break, and has in mind from the beginning about all of them, he only makes a single blessing</p>\n<p>This happens to me when I wear both a talit katan and a talit gadol.</p>\n<p>When I wear both, I have four tzitziyot in front of me -- which ones am I supposed to hold (and kiss?)? And if I have even more garments, should I be taking the front tzitzityot from only one of them (so that the numbers referenced above hold true) and if so, which one, or all of them because they are all equally important?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The tzitzit of the tallit gadol would take precedence because the fulfillment of the mitzvah is more complete in regard to atifah (being wrapped, head and body) See Tur, Orach Chaim 8:2 and Beit Yosef there. See also the Drisha to Tur, Orach Chaim 8:1:1.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר שמואל כל עטיפה שאינה כעטיפת הישמעאלים אינה עטיפה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After the fact, one might have fulfilled by using the tzitzit of the tallit katan, but to start out, it is preferable to use the tallit gadol if you are wearing both. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of consistency, you would want to use the tzitzit from the single garment, not one from an outer garment and one from an inner garment. This relates to a more esoteric concept of the level of makifim that you are associating with.</p>\n\n<p>The two citations from Orach Chaim are not related. 8:12 is dealing with the halachic question of whether one is required to make the blessing for tzitzit more than once for different garments. If you aren't putting them on at the same moment, meaning consecutively with the intention that they all be included in the single blessing, one right after the other, then two blessings are required. This same type of reasoning is used in regard to the blessing for tefillin.</p>\n\n<p>The second citation, Orach Chaim 24:5, is discussing those who follow that particular minhag of gazing at the tzitzit during the recital of the third paragraph of Shema. </p>\n\n\n",

See the commentary of RDZ Hoffman (link above), who understands this discussion not to be a \"ta'ama dekra\" situation, but rather, a relevant halachic question.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Before I looked it up, I wrote the following cute pilpul shel hevel:</strong></p>\n<p>While I don't have a source that directly addresses the issue, I do have an interesting Mar'eh Makom (or Moreh Makom - I'll ask that as a question soon) that talks about a somewhat related case.</p>\n<p>A Petzuah Daka(h) or Kerus Shafchah are men who sustain injuries to external genitalia, which the Torah forbids to \"marry into the congregation\" of Israel (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Devarim/23.2#e1n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 23:2</a>, Alhatorah translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹֽא־יָבֹ֧א פְצֽוּעַ־דַּכָּ֛א/דַּכָּ֛ה וּכְר֥וּת שׇׁפְכָ֖ה בִּקְהַ֥ל י״י׃</p>\n<p>He who is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.75b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 75b</a>, translation based on Davidson Edition) qualifies this statement by noting that if it was \"in God's hands\", it does not disqualify this individual :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל פצוע דכא בידי שמים כשר אמר רבא היינו דקרינן פצוע ולא קרינן הפצוע</p>\n<p>Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: A man wounded with crushed testicles at the hand of Heaven, is fit to marry a woman who was born Jewish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the meaning of \"at the hand of Heaven\" is a dispute among the Rishonim, a question could arise similar to what was asked by the OP - what if man-made trauma caused a later illness to develop (according to some, illness is considered \"the hand of Heaven\"), which eventually rendered the man a Petzuah Dakah. The Chazon Ish (Nashim 10, my rough translation) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועוד יש לצרף דאפשר דאין כאן פסול בידי אדם דתחלת ההכאה לא עשתה פסול אלא גרמה מיחוש קצת, ומה שנעשה לאחר חמש שנים מקרי \"ע\"י חולי\"\n...And it is should also be combined that it is possible that there is no disqualification through \"the hands of man\", because the original trauma did not cause a disqualification, rather, it caused a small injury, and what happened 5 years later would be called \"through illness\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He rules that when there was a significant gap (and recovery), the later damage may not be associated with the original injury.  However, he says that this is \"possible\", and may only be using it here since ruling this way will result in the person being permitted to marry into the congregation, so I wouldn't read into it too much.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that when Joshua's name was changed from Hoshea to Yehoshua there were no nekkudot for the yud, (which had been previously part of the name Sarai before a yud was removed and replaced with a heh, making Sarah [BT Sanhedrin 107a]) so two dots were \"borrowed\" from the segol under the \"ben,\" leaving it with one dot, that is, a hirik. The footnote for this source says it is from Baal HaTurim, parashas Shlach. However, I could find no such Baal HaTurim. I saw online that it was brought in the name of the Chasam Sofer, but the Meam Loez on this part of Shemos was published in 1746, before the Chasam Sofer was born. Was this then not part of the original Meam Loez? Thanks.</p>\n\n\n",

The fact that he will be alone with him, even if they don't enter in marital relationship, since they were isolated in name of marriage, she is his wife for every rules. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this definition of Chuppa, it is not necessary to have a Chuppa opened on all 4 sides. </p>\n\n<p>See Bet Yosef. In summary the Ran explains that there are two whole opinions regarding the definition of Chuppa, each of them has supportive arguments. The first, whe already soon in Tur, and which is also the opinion of the Rambam is that Chuppa is the fact that the Chatan is in <strong>Ychud</strong> with the Kalla in his house. The second opinion, with some variants is that the Chuppa is similary to our chupot, <strong>a specially reservated place</strong>, with painted linen, or a kind of succa made with roses, a place which is not necessarily discreet, and bride maids and page boys may also be present. The Rishonim and the Yerushalmi which seems to support this second opinion did not mention the need of a chuppa opened ont the all 4 sides. The point of this second opinion is that the bride enter is <strong>in his property</strong>, (in the idea, perhaps it is  a bit similar to the concept of kinyan Chatser or Meshicha). I don't know nowadays how we deal with the fact that the Chuppa needs to be a property of the Chatan. A nafka mina between the twoo opinions is the legitimity of a Chupat Nidda.</p>\n\n\n",

Alcoholic beverages are considered kosher (barring kosher issues aside from alcohol) and foods can be cooked with alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that alcohol is not considered suitable for Muslims, so it would not be sufficient to confirm that the product is kosher. One would additionally at least have to confirm that it does not contain alcohol.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit per revised question</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are a variety of kosher products which have bacon flavoring. These products do not contain actual bacon and would satisfy the requirements you mentioned. It should be noted, though, that just because a product says \"kosher\" on it <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/76156/1713\">does not mean that it is actually kosher</a> since the word \"kosher\" is not a trademarkable. You would want to verify that the product has the symbol of a reputable kosher certification agency. You can find a list of many of the most commonly seen reputable agencies <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/agency_list.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You mentioned that you don't have to dig too deeply to determine if a product is ok, so it may be OK for your purposes (since you aren't concerned with whether the product is actually kosher; just whether it contains pork) if the company says it's kosher. Odds are if the company says it's kosher the product doesn't have any pork in it; however, you can only be sure that the production has been supervised and <em>certified</em> to not contain pork if it has a kosher certification on it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rambam's Commentary on the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/24645\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder HaDoros</a>, published by R' Yechiel Heilprin in 1747, the author describes the life and legacy of many Jewish historical personalities including Rambam. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how historically accurate this book is considered to be, as many of the stories I read through seemed exaggerated and unlikely to be an objective portrayal of what events actually occurred. One example is the description of the Rambam being a beaten child who left home and stumbled upon the Ri MiGash whereupon he became a light to the nation. The Ri Migash died when the Rambam was seven, not leaving much time to study together. Another example would be the attribution of the צוואת הרמב\"ם to Rambam, whereas we now know this to be untrue.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the author <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24645&st=&pgnum=134\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lists</a> the Rambam's works, and writes at the bottom of the right-hand column on עמוד נד/ב:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פי' על התורה מובא בכנסת הגדולה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am interested in following the trail behind this story. This line is a bit cryptic to me. Is the author saying that the commentary is brought down in a Sefer called כנסת הגדולה? If so, does anyone have information on this Sefer? </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I have never seen this claim being made elsewhere. Are there any other references to a commentary the Rambam may have written on the Torah? There is a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/34547\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer</a> that claims to be the Rambam's commentary on Esther, but this is generally <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/66626/rambam-on-megilas-esther#comment186650_66626\">seen</a> to be an unsubstantiated claim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rambam wrote a commentary on Tanach (which includes the Torah), though limited in scope and not a running commentary. It is the first volume of Guide for the Perplexed. As he describes it in his introduction:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My primary object in this work is to explain certain words occurring\n  in the prophetic books. Of these some are homonyms, and of their\n  several meanings the ignorant choose the wrong ones; other terms which\n  are employed in a figurative sense are erroneously taken by such\n  persons in their primary signification. There are also hybrid terms,\n  denoting things which are of the same class from one point of view and\n  of a different class from another. It is not here intended to explain\n  all these expressions to the unlettered or to mere tyros, a previous\n  knowledge of Logic and Natural Philosophy being indispensable, or to\n  those who confine their attention to the study of our holy Law, I mean\n  the study of the canonical law alone; for the true knowledge of the\n  Torah is the special aim of this and similar works.</p>\n  \n  <p>The object of this treatise is to enlighten a religious man who has\n  been trained to believe in the truth of our holy Law, who\n  conscientiously fulfils his moral and religious duties, and at the\n  same time has been successful in his philosophical studies. Human\n  reason has attracted him to abide within its sphere; and he finds it\n  difficult to accept as correct the teaching based on the literal\n  interpretation of the Law, and especially that which he himself or\n  others derived from those homonymous, metaphorical, or hybrid\n  expressions. Hence he is lost in perplexity and anxiety. If he be\n  guided solely by reason, and renounce his previous views which are\n  based on those expressions, he would consider that he had rejected the\n  fundamental principles of the Law; and even if he retains the opinions\n  which were derived from those expressions, and if, instead of\n  following his reason, he abandon its guidance altogether, it would\n  still appear that his religious convictions had suffered loss and\n  injury. For he would then be left with those errors which give rise to\n  fear and anxiety, constant grief and great perplexity.</p>\n  \n  <p>This work has also a second object in view. It seeks to explain\n  certain obscure figures which occur in the Prophets, and are not\n  distinctly characterized as being figures. Ignorant and superficial\n  readers take them in a literal, not in a figurative sense. Even well\n  informed persons are bewildered if they understand these passages in\n  their literal signification, but they are entirely relieved of their\n  perplexity when we explain the figure, or merely suggest that the\n  terms are figurative. For this reason I have called this book Guide\n  for the Perplexed. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp008.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I am not specifically suggesting that this is what the Seder Hadoros meant. I am addressing the general question of whether Rambam wrote a commentary on the Torah. Alternatively, one could perhaps understand my answer as suggesting that the Seder Hadoros is incorrect because Rambam already described Moreh Nevuchim as his commentary on Tanach.)</p>\n\n\n",

He said to them: I am a day laborer, hired for the day, and I said to myself that I may not delay my work to answer you.</strong></p>\n<p>They further inquired: And what is the reason that the Master carried the firewood on one shoulder and his cloak on the other shoulder? He said to them: It was a borrowed robe. I borrowed it for this purpose, to wear it, and I did not borrow it for that purpose, to place wood on it.</p>\n<p>The Sages continued to ask Abba Ḥilkiyya about his unusual behavior. What is the reason that the entire way the Master did not wear his shoes, but when he reached water he put on his shoes? He said to them: The entire way I can see and take care where I walk, and therefore there is no need for me to wear out my shoes, but in the water I cannot see. Therefore, I put on my shoes to avoid hurting myself.</p>\n<p>They asked: What is the reason that when the Master reached shrubs and thorns, he lifted up his clothes? He said to them: This flesh will heal if it is scratched by thorns, but this garment will not heal if it is torn.</p>\n<p>They further inquired: What is the reason that when the Master reached the city, the Master’s wife came out adorned in her finery? He said to them: She dresses that way so that when I walk through the city I will not set my eyes upon another woman. They asked: What is the reason that she entered first, and afterward the Master entered, and only afterward we entered? He said to them: Because you have not been checked by me. I cannot be sure how you will act, and therefore I did not want you to be alone with my wife.</p>\n<p>The Sages were not done with their questions. What is the reason that when the Master ate bread, you did not say to us: Come and eat? He replied: Because there is not enough bread for guests, and I said to myself that I should not gain credit from the Sages for nothing, by offering you food I cannot serve you. They asked: What is the reason that the Master gave the older child one piece of bread and the younger child two? He said to them: This older child stays at home, and if he is hungry he can eat at any time, but this younger child sits and studies in the synagogue, and therefore he is hungrier.</p>\n<p>The two Sages had one final set of queries for Abba Ḥilkiyya. And what is the reason that the clouds began to form on that side where the Master’s wife stood before your own side? He explained: Because my wife is frequently at home, and she gives bread to the poor, and therefore her provision of benefit to the needy is immediate, i.e., soon after the rains fall she is able to provide the needy with provisions. Accordingly, her prayers are answered without delay. In contrast, I give money to the poor, and consequently, the benefit of my gift is not immediate, i.e., it takes a lot of time before the rainfall results in my ability to give money to the poor. Alternatively, her prayers may have been answered first because when certain hooligans [biryonei] were living in our neighborhood, I prayed that they should die, but she prayed that they should repent. And indeed, they repented.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Waldenberg holds that abortion is not\n  murder at all, and that mental distress can be equated with physical\n  pain. Therefore, abortion would be allowed if one’s rabbi determines\n  that the mental stress is the same as the physical would be. [Tzitz Eliezer 13:102; 14:101]</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Unterman takes a similar approach to the issue. Rabbi Unterman\n  does believe that abortion is considered akin to murder, and therefore\n  cannot be allowed in cases of mental anguish. However, if the\n  psychological distress that the mother would feel would cause suicidal\n  tendencies, Rabbi Unterman would permit abortion. [“The Law of Pikkuah Nefesh and Its definition” in HaTorah V’HaM’dinah, IV (1952) 22 - 29 as cited in David Feldman, Birth Control In Jewish Law. Rabbi Unterman is basing his ruling on a ruling by a case where a where a rabbi was asked if a man could have non kosher soup to prevent him from going insane. Rabbi Israel Meir Mizrachi ruled that serious danger to one’s mental health is the same as a risk to one’s physical health. Resp. Pri HaAretz, Vol III (Jerusalem, 1899), Y.D., No. 2. This ruling was also applied to a specific situation that dealt with birth control, a situation more similar to abortion than non kosher soup. Resp. Binyan David, No. 68; Minhat Yitzchak, Vol. I, No. 115; and Igg’rot Mosheh, E.H., No. 65, would allow the contraceptive mokh when pregnancy would create a serious mental-health risk as cited in David Feldman, Birth Control In Jewish Law]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The married husband and wife do not engage in sexual relations and the woman exclusively has sex with the man who is not her husband. The woman and her lover conceive a child that is, with certainty, born a mamzer. What is the resultant halachic status of this \"lover\" who illicitly fathered this child with her?

However, regarding the question <em>\"Does the fact that the father created a mamzer reflect on him in any way?\"</em>, it would appear that yes, this does cause some sort of impact.</p>\n<p>The Mishna in Chagigah 1:7 states: <em>\"רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן מְנַסְיָא אוֹמֵר, אֵיזֶהוּ מְעֻוָּת שֶׁאֵינוֹ יָכוֹל לִתְקֹן, זֶה הַבָּא עַל הָעֶרְוָה וְהוֹלִיד מִמֶּנָּה מַמְזֵר. אִם תֹּאמַר בְּגוֹנֵב וְגוֹזֵל, יָכוֹל הוּא לְהַחֲזִירוֹ וִיתַקֵּן\"</em></p>\n<p>translation (sefaria): <em>\"Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: Who is the crooked that cannot be made straight? This verse is referring to one who engaged in intercourse with a woman forbidden to him and fathered a mamzer with her. This individual is unable to rectify his sin, because the status of the illegitimate child is permanent. And if you say that it is referring to one who steals or robs, although he is crooked he can return what he stole and in this manner his sin will be rectified.\"</em></p>\n<p>In essence, the sin of fathering a Mamzer creates an unerasable impact that even teshuva (repentance) cannot completely undo.</p>\n<p>(parenthetically, I seem to recall hearing in the name of R' Elchonon Wasserman Hy\"d that Teshuva is of course available for all sinners, regardless of the intensity of the sin. However, the difference between Teshuva for this sin and all other sins, is that for other sins, sincere repentance will <strong>retroactively</strong> annul the sin - whereas for <strong>this</strong> sin, repentance will only annul the sin <strong>prospectively</strong>.</p>\n<p>If anyone has a source for this, I would be much obliged...)</p>\n\n\n",

Meir Abulafiah</a> was asked this question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נשאל הרמ\"ה אם יכול לברך גר שלא עשני גוי. ושבוי שלא עשני עבד והשיב: <strong>כך ראינו שאין הברכה אלא על תחלת ברייתו של אדם לפיכך אין הגר מברך שלא עשני גוי</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R.

Isaiah Horowitz</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Sirkis\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

Jacob Emden (cited in Tehumin (15, p. 444) write that a convert should recite the normal blessing, of שלא עשני גוי, but without God's name. In this vein, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Yosef\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yitshak Yossef</a> writes in Yalkut Yossef that a convert shouldn't recite the normal blessing, but he may recite it without God's name:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ילקוט יוסף תפילה ב נוסחאות התפלה והברכות</p>\n  \n  <p>יז. גר צדק אינו מברך \"שלא עשני גוי\", ואם ירצה יברך בלא שם ומלכות </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It seems likely that the principle of <em>safek berakhot lehakel</em> of avoiding blessings that one may not be required to recite, would apply to one who converted out of doubt, and he would therefore avoid saying the blessing, at least with God's name. R. Ari Yitshak Shevat writes in an article in Tehumin (ibid) that the issue of those who converted as a stringency bring this issue to the fore. If I understand correctly, he means that if converts can't recite the blessing, then possible converts can't either.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It's a <em>makhlokhet</em>.

But the Shaarei Knesset HaGedola (cited by the Kaf Hachaim 46:36) says yes because the <em>b'racha</em> is thanks for not creating him to <em>remain</em> a non-Jew.

This is also supported by the fact that the world is being created yesh meayin (something from nothing) every single second- as the Baal Shem tov explained the posuk עולם יי דברך נצב בשמים״” that the aseres maamaros of creation are happening every moment. So the fact that this person was recreated, today, as a Jew, warrants the blessing “…for not creating me a goy” regardless of how he was <em>born</em>. Because the Bracha is thanking Hashem for what is happening right now, today (that this specific morning He gave him his [jewish] neshama back in his body).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Interchangeable usage of Hebrew letters (such as Beis and Vav, etc.)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I don't know if there is another post about this issue, but forgive me if there is. </p>\n\n<p>Here is my question. I recently read somewhere that there are letters that can be interchanged for various reasons. For example, the letter Beis can be changed for the similar-sounding letter Vav. The same I think applies to Aleph and Heh. Is this true, and if so, when would this be an appropriate thing to do? Would it apply to situations where one is working on a Remez (hidden issue), or for Gematria purposes, or something else perhaps? </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>There is more than one answer to this question. But here's one, albeit a long one.</p>\n<p>According to the Sefer Yetzirah (02:03), the letters of the Hebrew alphabet can be grouped in five categories according to the part of the mouth used to form them. Rashi often seems to support a theory something like this one, as do the sages and other commentators, frequently suggesting letter-exchanges consistent with the categories of the Sefer Yetzirah in dozens of places. Some of these are sorted into categories below.</p>\n<p>In my opinion a natural but doubtful assumption of the modern reader is that these rabbis were doing some sort of etymology. That is, a modern reader might take word similarities as evidence that at some earlier time the language was different and developed gradually into the language we know. But attributing that assumption to the rabbis seems unjustified. Some of these examples below are more naturalistic, comparing words similar in both meaning and sound as someone might do in any language; but that does not point clearly to an earlier state of the language. And some examples feel more Masoretic, comparing words that do not seem obviously related, apparently intended in a different spirit or predicated on the belief that Hebrew, and in particular the Hebrew of scriptures, is special. So that's a theoretical problem that's hard to deal with.</p>\n<p>I use ArtScroll books a lot, and these notes reflect two ArtScroll-isms. First, I use the pound symbol to indicate footnotes in ArtScroll, either the note itself or the place in the body where the note is indicated. Second, I use the longer page numbers of ArtScroll gemara, where 24b2 means the standard page 24b, but page 2 of ArtScrolls printing of that page. If you're not using ArtScroll editions, or if you're using an ArtScroll edition inconsistent in these details, then just ignore the #3-style elements and the digit following the letter in page numbers; the rest of the citation might still be accurate.</p>\n<p>In order to illustrate the system I wanted to divide examples by category. But in fact, when the system is itself the point of discussion, examples may be drawn from all categories. For example when the Ramban (Gen-41:47 Ramban) wants to explain this system, he presents many examples of various substitutions, diverse but consistent with the categories. Koomtza and Goomatz mean \"pit\" although one is spelled with a Koof and one a Gimmel; Mazeg and Mascha mean \"mixed\", although Zayin-Gimmel and Samech-Chaf; Kana and Gana mean \"garden\" although one Chaf and one Gimmel; Vayisachroo and Vayisgeroo mean \"they closed\" although one Chaf and one Gimmel; Mechurasam and Megoiroisayich refer to dwellings although one Chaf and one Gimmel; Koiva and Choiva mean \"helmet\" although one Koof and one Chaf; Tikein means \"establish,\" and Tachshit means \"ornament,\" whether spelled Koof or Chaf; and Vayatziku and Vayatigu mean \"to set or assign\" although spelled Koof or Gimmel.</p>\n<p>Now.

The editor (of my edition of Tanya) comments there that \"<em>va'ed</em> equals <em>echad</em> through the substitution of letters, as stated in the Zohar.\" That remark bears this footnote:</p>\n<p>\"Zohar II, 134a. Hebrew grammar classifies the letters of the alphabet according to their syntactic functions, their respective sources in the organs of speech, and so on. Within each group, the letters are interchangeable. The letters <em>aleph</em> and <em>vav</em> both belong to the group of \"connective letters\" (<em>otiyot hahemshech</em>) and may thus be interchanged. The letters <em>chet</em> and <em>ayin</em> fall into the category of guttural letters (<em>otiot groniyot</em>) and may likewise be interchanged. Hence, <em>echad</em> is the equivalent of va'ed.\"</p>\n<p>So whatever else that may mean, it suggests to me that although the Vav of Va'ed is a consonant, it can be classed with Aleph rather than with Veis.</p>\n<p>I've never actually looked at the Zohar; I simply copied the citation. I also notice, looking at this 6-year-old answer at the Stack Exchange, that it now collapses into chaos at the end.</p>\n<p>So, as they say, Tzarich Iyun.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When the letters אהו״י are used as <em>matres lectionis</em> to indicate long vowels, and are not pronounced. Since א and ה are both used to indicate long <em>a</em>, they are sometimes interchanged in rabbinic manuscripts and other early texts. </p>\n\n<p>In the letters from the Judaean desert, one finds the name Bar-Kosiba variously spelled as כוסבא and כוסבה. The Dead Sea Scrolls have וגבורא instead of וּגְבוּרָ֖ה at Isaiah 36:5. The name ʿAqiva is found as עקיבה and עקיבא in rabbinic literature.</p>\n\n<p>The weakening of gutturals אהח״ע has also allowed for interchange of these letters. ואתה appears instead of וְעַתָּה֙ (Isaiah 5:5) in the Dead Sea Scrolls. וחתהזק appears instead of והתחזק in the Bar-Kokhba documents. Some rabbinic documents have the form אדיין instead of עדיין.</p>\n\n<p>Interchange of letters that are similar phonologically also appears. Even in the Second Temple Period, one finds interchange of שׁ and ס. The Dead Sea Scrolls have סלמותמה for Genesis 37:34 where the Masoretic text has שִׂמְלֹתָ֔יו. </p>\n\n<p>The rabbinic tradition has interchange between labials ו (in Eretz Israel), פ (in Babylon), and ב. For example, one finds both יוונה  and יבנה. Nasals נ and מ interchange: מרום vs. מרון. Other similar examples of interchanges are found as well.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that while these interchanges exist, they are often \"erroneous\" or nonstandard spellings, based on the local pronunciation.</p>\n\n\n",

These punishments will never be used to afflict the Bnai Yisrael. This is different from the <em>natural</em> illnesses of human kind which come upon people through <em>the laws of nature</em> rather than as an explicit punishment for a moral degeneration. As Rav Hirsch says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מחלה is used not onoly of bodily illness, but also any hindrancd to\n  well being, of the mind (worry) as ואין חולה מכם עלי (Sam. I. XXI:8),\n  of general existence ובל יאמר שכן חליתי (Is. XXXIII:24), of the land,\n  ואת תחלואיה אשר חלה ה' בה (Deut. XXIX:21), also especially to those\n  which were sent for the purpose of correction, punishment, הכית אותם\n  ולא חלו (Jer. V:3), הכוני בל חליתי (Prov. XXIII:35), Hashem says <code>The\n  keeping of My Laws protects you from such sufferings which otherwise I\n  should have to use to educate you, as I had to inlict on the\n  Egyptions</code>. Hashem does not allow people or states to endure without\n  consideration for משפטים, מצות, and חוקים, without them they go to\n  ruin, and degenerate physically and socially, and so, keeping the\n  divine Law is the most preventative medicine against all physical and\n  social evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch also speaks of the difference between the two types of <em>illness</em> in\n<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9971#v=15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aikev 7:15</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהֵסִיר יְהֹוָה מִמְּךָ כָּל חֹלִי וְכָל מַדְוֵי מִצְרַיִם הָרָעִים\n  אֲשֶׁר יָדַעְתָּ לֹא יְשִׂימָם בָּךְ וּנְתָנָם בְּכָל שׂנְאֶיךָ:</p>\n  \n  <p>And the Lord will remove from you all illness, and all of the evil\n  diseases of Egypt which you knew, He will not set upon you, but He\n  will lay them upon all your enemies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says that <code>חולי is the physiological effect of a condition of illness</code> while <code>דוי is more a designation of the feelings caused by illness, the suffering</code></p>\n\n<p>In this case, it is what is put upon those who are being punished by the illness and the associated suffering. This is a reference to the makos of Egypt rather than the normal illnesses which occur through <em>Nature</em>. That is why, even if Bnai Yisrael where to become <em>sick</em>, they would only have this happen as in the דרך הטבע and not as a punishment as would happen to your enemies or as happened in Egypt. Even <em>natural disease</em> will be removed from Bnai Yisrael.</p>\n\n\n",

See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>While the question is a bit broad and should perhaps be broken up into multiple questions, I will do my best to answer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The names</strong></p>\n\n<p>As is commonly known, Sarah had 4 names Sarai (Genesis 11:29), Sarah (obviously), Yiskah (Megillah 14a), and Lucy (18:6).</p>\n\n<p>However, she is also clearly identical with Avraham's servant Eliezer. In Genesis (14:14), we read</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיָּרֶק אֶת-חֲנִיכָיו</p>\n  \n  <p>He led forth his initiates</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi famously explains, this refers to \"Eliezer\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חניכיו - חנכו כתיב זה אליעזר שחנכו למצות </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Evidently \"Eliezer\" must be another name for Sarah, since וַיָּרֶק אֶת-חֲנִיכָיו is numerically equivalent to 505; the numerical value of שרה.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The reasons</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sarah is called Lucy, since Lucy לושי has the numerical value of 346, which is identical to the value of לְאִישָׁהּ; for her husband. Sarah was totally devoted to her husband Avraham, and to his proselytising efforts (cf. Rashi to Genesis 12:5).</p>\n\n<p>She is called Eliezer, in reference to her miraculous salvation (Genesis 12:17) from Pharaoh who kidnapped her (12:16). As the verse in Exodus (18:4) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְשֵׁ֥ם הָאֶחָ֖ד אֱלִיעֶ֑זֶר כִּֽי־אֱלֹהֵ֤י אָבִי֙ בְּעֶזְרִ֔י וַיַּצִּלֵ֖נִי מֵחֶ֥רֶב פַּרְעֹֽה </p>\n  \n  <p>The name of the primary one was Eliezer for the God of my father was my help, and he saved me from the sword of Pharoh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The name לושי is actually a compound of לו & שי. </p>\n\n<p>We know that ישמעאל had the first name Lou as seen in Avraham's request 17 18\n לו ישמעאל יחיה לפניך.</p>\n\n<p>The word שי means a present or a gift. </p>\n\n<p>Sarah was given this name at this time of her doing chessed by baking bread as a way to spiritually combat the chessed Yishmael did mentioned in passuk 7:\n ויתן אל הנער וימהר לעשות אתו.</p>\n\n<p>In this way she was able to convince Avraham to reject Yishmael and throw him out of the hous as mentioned in 21 beginning with passuk 9.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your second question, she also was named. חיה. Twice. That is why she is called חיי שרה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I'd just like to point out that in Bereishis 18 several other names are presented:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאַבְרָהָ֤ם וְשָׂרָה֙ זְקֵנִ֔ים בָּאִ֖ים בַּיָּמִ֑ים חָדַל֙ לִהְי֣וֹת לְשָׂרָ֔ה אֹ֖רַח כַּנָּשִֽׁים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And Avraham and Sarah were old, coming of age. Sarah had ceased to be Orach KaNashim. (v. 11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So she used to be called Orach KaNashim but at some point lost that title. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַתִּצְחַ֥ק שָׂרָ֖ה בְּקִרְבָּ֣הּ לֵאמֹ֑ר אַחֲרֵ֤י בְלֹתִי֙ הָֽיְתָה־לִּ֣י עֶדְנָ֔ה וַֽאדֹנִ֖י זָקֵֽן׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And Sarah, Bekirbah, laughed, saying: After [I was] Belosi I will be Edna? And my master is Zakein! (v. 12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So she was also called Bekirbah. It seems that she was also known as Belosi and was expressing astonishment that on top of all of her names she would also be called Edna. To top it off, even Avraham had a bunch of names - he was called Zakein!</p>\n\n<p>HaShem, for the sake of peace (Yevamos 66), decided to not tell Avraham that Sarah had given him such a disparaging name and instead gave it to Sarah, along with another name:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהוָ֖ה אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֑ם לָ֣מָּה זֶּה֩ צָחֲקָ֨ה שָׂרָ֜ה לֵאמֹ֗ר הַאַ֥ף אֻמְנָ֛ם אֵלֵ֖ד וַאֲנִ֥י זָקַֽנְתִּי׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And HaShem said to Avraham: What is this that Sarah laughed, saying, even [as] Umnam will I give birth? And I am Zakanti! (v. 13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sarah mistook that as Tzachakti, not Zakanti. Scared that people would make fun of her for having a name meaning \"I laughed,\" she tricked the Malachim into changing it for her:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַתְּכַחֵ֨שׁ שָׂרָ֧ה ׀ לֵאמֹ֛ר לֹ֥א צָחַ֖קְתִּי כִּ֣י ׀ יָרֵ֑אָה וַיֹּ֥אמֶר ׀ לֹ֖א כִּ֥י צָחָֽקְתְּ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And Sarah denied it, saying, I am not Tzachakti, for she was scared. And [the angel] said, no, you are Tzachakt. (v. 15)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, this passage reveals seven more names for Sarah, one of which she lost, as well as one more for Avraham. </p>\n\n\n",

However, as is the practice of the <em>megilla</em> the most important characters are not named specifically. If you pay close enough attention to the words, though, it's completely clear what's going on.</p>\n<p>Of course, in the times of the <em>megilla</em>, the taxi dispatcher wasn't in charge of a bunch of cars... Such things didn't exist. When you needed to travel, you rode a horse and the taxis of the time were horses for rent. Now, the taxi dispatcher was a friend of the Jews. That's why when Achashverosh originally sent out his decree to kill all the Jews, the taxi dispatcher refused to send the horses out carrying such an evil decree. The messages had to be taken on foot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָרָצִים יָצְאוּ דְחוּפִים</p>\n<p>The runners went out in haste</p>\n<p><sup><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3303.htm#15\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Esther 3:15</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, when Achashverosh realized what an evil man Haman was, he sent out another message allowing the Jews to defend themselves and in this case, the taxi dispatcher was happy to send out the horses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּשְׁלַח סְפָרִים בְּיַד הָרָצִים בַּסּוּסִים רֹכְבֵי הָרֶכֶשׁ, הָאֲחַשְׁתְּרָנִים--בְּנֵי, הָרַמָּכִים</p>\n<p>and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the king's service, bred of the stud</p>\n<p><sup><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3308.htm#10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Esther 8:10</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>My answer may be a bit \"localized\", so take this within its context.</p>\n\n<p>In a number of major cities in U.S., there is a cab comapny called \"Uber\".

Hence, the need for the dispatcher.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think the important role he plays is keeping drunk drivers off the street.

But, let's focus on grandmas, shall we?</p>\n\n<p>All grandmas are much like Le'ah. The \"original\" Leah suffered so much in her life. She cried because she thought she would have to marry Esav, as she was the older. Then, her father does the switch and bait with her sister and she is forced to go along with it. Her new husband (Jacob) prefers her sister and doesn't lover her the same way. Her daughter gets raped. Her kids sells Joseph as a slave ...  How much suffering can she take, really? Yet, for the most part, she keeps quiet, and deals with all of this. Finally, when she dies, it is HER that gets buried with Jacob and not Rachel, her \"rival\". She finally has some peace and rest only after her death.</p>\n\n<p>Think about Jewish grandmas, these days. They spoil their grandkids. They have to compete with the \"other\" grandma over who gets the grandkids for Pesach Seder this year. Sometimes the grandkids call grandma; often they don't. WHen the grandkids come to grandma, they're sometimes messy and grandma can't bend down so well to clean up the mess! Then, when grandma gets older, she moves to Florida while the grandkids live in Israel. So, how often does she get to see them? Oy! So much suffering, just like Le'ah.</p>\n\n<p>So, you can see the comparison, here. So, in honor of Le'ah, halacha suggests that grandmas get her name.</p>\n\n<p>I'll have to research why other women get that name, too. My grandma (her name was NOT Le'ah, BTW, but, I guess \"Pola\" is close!) used to tell me how much suffering childbirth is. Maybe, that's reason enough to have all women named after Le'ah.</p>\n\n\n",

Rava said to him: You said the proof from there, from a verse in the Writings, and I say the proof from here, from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants, and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17), and it is written immediately following that: “And the Lord remembered Sarah, as He had said” (Genesis 21:1), with the pronoun interpreted homiletically: As Abraham said with regard to Abimelech.

This is true for prophets as evident from II Kings (4:23) and for Torah scholars as evident from Berakhot 34b.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך איכא מחלוקת רבותינו הראשונים לבקש מהם שהם בשליחותם יעשו באופן היותר טוב לפנינו, דיש אוסרין גם זה. אבל לבקש אדם כשהוא בחיים להתפלל ולברך, הוא דבר הראוי והנכון.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later in the piece he writes that utilising <em>dead</em> people as intermediaries, however, is more complicated.

Moshe's arguments are compelling, there is powerful precedent for his conclusion. In a letter to his brother-in-law(2), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Moses_ben_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Avraham ben HaRambam</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Indeed we are in great danger I cannot relate to you [even] the fewest details, for I can imagine what your great consternation would be upon hearing them.

For example, Abraham prays for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 18:23-32). Similarly, Moses prays for Miriam (Exodus 12:13)(3). Additionally, Moses prays on behalf of all of Israel, with no mention made of such a request (Exodus 32:30-2).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(1) It should be noted that it is possible that others could conceivably disagree with some of his proofs. For example, in the episode in Kings (v. 28; the cited verse seems to be a misprint) the Shunamite woman never explicitly asks Elisha to intercede with God. Rather, she merely says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say: Do not deceive me?' (Trans. Mechon Mamre).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(2) Paul Fenton’s <em>A Judeo-Arabic Commentary on the Haftarot by Hanan’el ben Semu’el (?), Abraham Maimonides’ Father-in-Law</em> Appendix 1, p. 52 in Maimonidean Studies (ed. Arthur Hyman) vol. 1. New York, 1990.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Although it could be argued that (12:11) was a request for prayer by Aaron for himself and Miriam, a) Miriam herself didn't ask him, and b) it appears that Aaron was just asking for forgiveness; not prayer.

So I don't think this is a meta-question.</p>\n\n<p>Is it halachically the case that on a 2 day Rosh Chodesh, the upcoming month is considered as if it has begun even on the first day?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it halachically the case that on a 2 day Rosh Chodesh, the upcoming\n  month is considered as if it has begun even on the first day?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The basic answer is yes, unless specific language is given to differentiate. Thus if one says <em>the start of Adar</em> or <em>Rosh Chodesh Adar</em>, the the first day of Rosh Chodesh is meant. If one explicitly says <em>the first of Adar</em> then the second day of Rosh Chodesh is meant.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, the Rambam says that if someone makes a neder for \"this month\", the thirtieth day of the month (first day of Rosh Chodesh) is treated as the next month and the neder has expired. Thus we see that when someone speaks of \"Rosh Chodesh\" for halachic purposes, then we use the first day of Rosh Chodesh as <em>beginning the month</em> based on the principle that the Torah speaks <em>Belashon Adam</em> under normal circumstances</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/973889/jewish/Nedarim-Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Nedarim - Chapter 10</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Halacha 3</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאני שותה חדש זה אסור בשאר ימי החדש אבל ביום ראש חודש יהיה מותר אף על\n  פי שהיה חדש חסר שאני טועם חדש אחד אסור שלשים יום גמורים מעת לעת נדר\n  חדש סתם אסור שלשים יום מעת לעת מספק: </p>\n  \n  <p>[When one takes a vow, saying:] \"I will not drink [wine] during this\n  month,\" he is forbidden in the remaining days of the month. He is,\n  however, permitted on the day of the following Rosh Chodesh even if\n  the month is lacking.8 [If he took a vow, saying]: \"I will not drink\n  [wine] for an entire month,\" he is forbidden for 30 full days. [If he\n  said]: I will not drink [wine] for a month,\" he is forbidden for 30\n  full days because of the unresolved question.9</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As explained</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Footnote 8</em></p>\n  \n  <p>A month which is lacking is a month of 29 days [as opposed to a month\n  of 30 days; see Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh, chs. 1-3, which discusses\n  the principles determining when a month is given only 29 days and when\n  it is given 30].</p>\n  \n  <p>The commentaries question why the Rambam (based on Nedarim 60b) speaks\n  of the month being lacking. Seemingly, it is quite obvious that if\n  there are only 29 days in a month, one would be permitted on Rosh\n  Chodesh in the next month. The new month has already begun. A point\n  that has to be made is that even if there are 30 days in a month, one\n  is permitted to partake of wine on the thirtieth day. Since it is Rosh\n  Chodesh of the coming month, the vow has concluded even though the\n  date is the thirtieth of the previous month.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Radbaz explains that this in fact is the Rambam's intent, even\n  though his wording is somewhat difficult to explain in that manner.\n  This interpretation is reflected in the wording of the Shulchan Aruch\n  (Yoreh De'ah 220:4). The Or Sameach offers a different interpretation,\n  stating that when a month has only 29 days, sometimes the conjunction\n  of the sun and the moon does not take place until the first day of the\n  new month. Even so, since it is already Rosh Chodesh, the vow is\n  concluded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It appears that this isn't an actual technical rule, and therefore does not have technical parameters. (perhaps this is part of the reason that Rambam, Tur, and the Shulhan Arukh don't mention this \"rule\").</p>\n\n<p>Rather, the idea of increasing joy in Adar seems to be as the Meiri (Ta'anit 27b) writes, that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובגמרא פירשו שכמו שמשנכנס אב ממעטים בשמחה כך משנכנס אדר מרבין בשמחה הכל הערה שראוי להתפלל ולהודות לאל בכל עת ובכל זמן כפי הנאות למה שאירע באותו זמן </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, this statement is meant to inspire us to pray and praise God all the time, as is appropriate for what occurred then.</p>\n\n<p>If, indeed, this isn't a technical halakhic rule, but rather an encouragement to not miss an opportunity to capitalise on a moment in time and channel it into service of God, then the question doesn't really start. If people are already excited, then that makes it an appropriate time to channel that into service of God. (See Kuzari II:50) for more on the idea of joy being a form of divine service when it is part of a deliberate experience, rather than mere unbound wildness).</p>\n\n\n",

(May not be the best examples, but I can't think of a perfect one now.) Why or why not? Preferably, please bring sources. </p>\n\n<p><em>Hypothesis: Since a woman is able to take the positions of power in my and any other examples, it would seem that the examples do not fall under the prohibition on women and converts taking positions of authority. Therefore, I think--though I am definitely not sure--a convert ought to be able to take these positions, too. However, there may be <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=xMRTndCRTGUC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=Rambam%20in%20Hilchos%20Melachim%201:4&source=bl&ots=AHDo5TPf4W&sig=a-tT-ID-nPqH49khZv_KrZagXDc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjL66eNra7SAhVM4YMKHenYDB4Q6AEIXDAL#v=onepage&q=Rambam%20in%20Hilchos%20Melachim%201%3A4&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">evidence</a> that the prohibition on women and on converts taking positions of authority are two separate concerns, and therefore must be treated individually -- in which case it is not at all clear that converts could take power over born-Jewish women.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The emphasis of the Rambam in your citation is not about being in a position of communal authority. It is about being the head of the community, meaning the one who determines policy and direction just like the King. A convert is permitted to act as an authority within the chain of command.</p>\n\n<p>The most obvious example comes from Pirkei Avot 5:21-22 which quote as Torah <em>authorities</em>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bag-Bag\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Bag-Bag</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/person/Ben%20He%20He\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben He-He</a>. They were both Tannaim of the first century and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.9b.10?lang=he&p2=Tosafot_on_Chagigah.9b.17&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">converts</a> to Judaism. Their true names were concealed because of Roman persecution against Jewish converts at the time. Both their names hint to the letter 'Heh' which is a sign of the 'Heh' added to Avraham and Sarah's names. They were both <em>Ben Avraham</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Bag-Bag was a student of Rabbi Hillel. In the case of Ben Heh-Heh, he is the authority quoted for Hilchot Talmud Torah in regard to when to begin each type of study, <em>five for Chumash, ten for Mishnah, fifteen for Gemara, etc</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In regard to your examples for women, a Rebbetzin is not an appointed position. It is a consequence of her marriage to the community Rav. A mikvah lady is under the direction of the supervising Rav. The question of a Menahelet of a womens yeshivah is dependent upon what her authority is. If she is the final word in making decisions for the yeshiva, it would seem inappropriate. But if she consults with others in committee, it would be fine.</p>\n\n<p>Leadership has many different levels in the chain of command. Both the convert and women are the idea of vessels (<em>keilim</em>) which primarily receive influence. Like water from the tap filling the pitcher. But once the vessel is filled, it conveys the water from the tap to the mouth of the one who is thirsting. The most important criteria to being an effective vessel is that it be empty in order to receive from the source.</p>\n\n\n",

The Lubavitcher Rebbe ztz\"l was asked regarding this custom and what is the source is Torah- and indeed he provided a specific scenario in Gemara where it is proven that this custom has a source (I will provide that source upon request, I don't have it off the top of my head).</p>\n<p>Now, as to the matter at hand. The other answer mentioned the statement by the Previous Rebbe, and it is a commonly known one amongst Chabad Chassidim. When such a tzaddik as the Rebbe says any given statement, it is not taken lightly. So Chassidim of the last Lubavitcher Rebbe tried to place a sefer atop of Tanya, and indeed when the Rebbe approached his shtender, he removed it from the Tanya.

Regarding other sefarim, it is silly if Chabad Chassidim have the hanhagga of placing Chassidic works davka atop of other works, and removing other works from atop of Chassidic works. Certainly one must comply with halacha, and then the only real <em>established</em> minhag by Chabad Chassidim is regards to Sefer haTanya, which is treated as one might Tanach, but certainly not at the expense of the latter.</p>\n\n\n",

Is the title ''God'' attributed to the referent described in the verses that precede this verse?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The translations you cite in (the original version of) your question are not Jewish translations, despite the misleading name of one of them.  Let's look at this verse in more reliable renderings.</p>\n<p>First, the Hebrew:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּסְאֲךָ אֱלֹהִים עוֹלָם וָעֶד שֵׁבֶט מִישֹׁר שֵׁבֶט מַלְכוּתֶךָ: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>JPS <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2645.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">translates</a> it this way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thy throne given of God is for ever and ever; a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sefaria <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.45.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">has</a> (from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America_Tanakh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JPS 1985</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your divine throne is everlasting; your royal scepter is a scepter of equity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These two translations treat אֱלֹהִים as an adjective modifying כִּסְאֲךָ (your throne).  In Biblical Hebrew, adjectives come after the nouns they modify.  According to this interpretation, God (אֱלֹהִים is one of God's names) is not being <em>addressed</em> but, rather, <em>cited</em>.</p>\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16266#v=7&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">interprets</a> it differently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your throne, O judge, [will exist] forever and ever; the scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.</p>\n<p>Your throne, O judge: Your throne, O prince and judge, shall exist forever and ever, as the matter that is stated (Exod. 7:1): “I have made you a judge אלהים) (נתתיך over Pharaoh.” And why? Because “a scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom,” that your judgments are true, and you are fit to govern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi is interpreting אֱלֹהִים as \"judge\" based on another verse that, according to Onkelos and Tanchuma, uses the word that way.  In that verse (Sh'mot 7:1), the judge (Moshe) has a divine mandate, so this isn't as big a difference as it first appears.</p>\n<p>So, the psalm does not address <em>anybody</em> as God.  This verse addresses the same \"you\" as the rest of the psalm -- \"I speak my poem to a king\" (v2).  From context this is an earthy king, not <em>the</em> King.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16266#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>  understands the Psalm (<em>I am using the Hebrew numbering of verses</em>) to be </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a song of praise for them [the Torah scholars] to endear them to the\n  people and to endear their Torah to them [the people]. (v. 1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>My heart is astir:</strong> In this manner, the Psalmist commenced his song: My\n  heart caused a good theme to swarm within me in your praise, O Torah\n  scholar. (v. 2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And on your quoted verse (7)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Your throne, O judge: Your throne, O prince and judge, shall exist\n  forever and ever, as the matter that is stated (Exod. 7:1): “I have\n  made you a judge  (נתתיך אלהים) over Pharaoh.” And why? Because “a\n  scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom,” that your judgments\n  are true, and you are fit to govern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You see that Rashi understands  אלהים as  prince and judge and not as G-d and he quotes Exod 7 (1) as a proof that  אלהים can be used in this way.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the prince and judge referred to here is the same subject as at the beginning of the Psalm but is not G-d. </p>\n\n<p>The Metzudas Dovid commenting on the verse translates “Your throne,  Elokim ...\" as “The throne of Kingship which is given to you from G-d ...”. So it seems that he sees Elokim not as a a noun that identifies the person being addressed but as a description of the throne. </p>\n\n<p>He will agree with Rashi that Elokim does not translate into G-d.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is a mis-translation. The psalmist is addressing the messiah, not Hashem. The word here is the secular meaning. The actual verse is <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16266#v=7&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 45:7</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּסְאֲךָ אֱלֹהִים עוֹלָם וָעֶד שֵׁבֶט מִישֹׁר שֵׁבֶט מַלְכוּתֶךָ:</p>\n  \n  <p>Your throne, O judge, [will exist] forever and ever; the scepter of\n  equity is the scepter of your kingdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Your throne, O judge</strong>: Your throne, O prince and judge, shall exist\n  forever and ever, as the matter that is stated (Exod. 7:1): “I have\n  made you a judge אלהים) (נתתיך over Pharaoh.” And why? Because “a\n  scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom,” that your judgments\n  are true, and you are fit to govern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This can be seen more clearly in verse 8</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You loved righteousness and you hated wickedness; therefore God, your\n  God, anointed you with oil of joy from among your peers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In particular, the first halachah discusses the \"order of operations:\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א  המלך המשיח עתיד לעמוד, ולהחזיר מלכות בית דויד ליושנה הממשלה הראשונה, ובונה מקדש, ומקבץ נדחי ישראל.  וחוזרין כל המשפטים בימיו, כשהיו מקודם:  מקריבין קרבנות, ועושין שמיטין ויובלות ככל מצותן האמורה בתורה.</p>\n  \n  <p>The 1) King messiah will arise in the future and return the kinship of the house if David to its ancient kingship, 2) rebuild the temple, and 3) gather in the exiled of Israel. 4) And returns the judgements (courts) in his days like they were before: 5) bringing sacrifices, and making sabbatical and jubilee years like all the commandments conveyed in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to establish a clear chronology, and many commentators discuss where the ordering diverges from Talmudic sources (see the back of the Frankel Rambam for explicit examples).</p>\n\n<p>The Anshei Kinesses HaGedolah (Men of the Great Assembly) organized the Amidah, in which we pray for the redemption, among other things.

According to some, when we cross the point where the majority of Jews are residing in Israel (which will be fairly soon) many dormant laws will come back into effect.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an explanation for why the Rambam diverges from the order in which we pray for redemption?

I wouldn't try to convert anyone. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Based solely on the points of the question, why would there be any doubt about if it is permissible? According to the Jewish tradition as found in the Torah concerning the <em>confusing of language</em> in connection with the story of the Tower of Babel in the book of Bereshit, Hebrew was the first language, that was used by all mankind. It is not the exclusive domain of Jews, but of all descendants of the first man, Adam.</p>\n\n<p>The names of G-d which appear in the Torah are also not Jewish names, they are G-d's names. They are relevant to all nations, both Jews and non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>The benefit of Hebrew, particularly if you as an individual understand the meaning of the words, is that it is the <em>Holy Tongue</em>, <strong>לשון הקודש</strong>. That means that its usage is especially efficacious in communicating clearly and completely the intent of the speaker. This is because Hebrew actually relates to and reveals the inner essence and nature of existence like is explained in connection with Adam HaRishon naming all of G-d's creations in parshat Bereshit.</p>\n\n<p>So the real point for you to ponder is, after careful consideration, do you believe that it is G-d's will that you serve Him as a Christian? Or is there a <strong><em>better</em> <em>path</em></strong>, a <strong><em>better choice</em></strong> for you?</p>\n\n<p>From your comments and the details of your question, it sounds like that is where you are right now. But it also  sounds like you are searching and questioning with sincerity. And in that area Jewish tradition teaches that for those who <strong><em>truly</em></strong> seek G-d, G-d will assist them and bless them.</p>\n\n<p>May it be G-d's will, that if you choose to use Hebrew in your studies and your prayers, that you receive and comprehend G-d's unique message for you and that you have success in translating that message into good acts in your service to the Owner of us all.</p>\n\n\n",

Moses brought his sheep to Mt. Horev. What was Mt. Horeb? None other than Mt. Sinai. We know that the Torah came from Mt. Sinai. So, technically, Moses brought his animals close to the Torah before the Torah was even given.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not pleased with that explanation, remember that the Mishnah you quoted said \"<strong>close to</strong> or \"approaching\" the Torah, but not actually next to it. If you read the story just prior to the discussion of the 10 Commandments, G-d commands Moses to make a fence so that the animals should not arise Mt. Sinai. So, Moses brought them close to the Torah, but they weren't actually there to receive it.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As everyone knows, Lurianic Kabbalah teaches that after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohu_and_Tikun?wprov=sfsi1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shviras Hakeilim </a>- The Breaking of the Vessels, Nitzozos Hakedusha - Sparks of Holiness, flooded the world and went into everything in creation. The Arizal taught that recapturing these Nitzozos can be done through the use of these objects for a mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Included in all objects are animals as well. Thus, when one eats food for a mitzvah, be it for a Holiday meal, or to give one strength to learn Torah, that action captures the Sparks and raises it on high.</p>\n\n<p>However, this raises a dilemma. How can one recapture the Sparks from food that is non-kosher which one in not permitted to eat? </p>\n\n<p>The Bnei Yisaschar (ח\"ב דף צ\"ה ע\"א.) makes a famous statement: one who abstains from eating food that had non kosher food fall in, but was nullified through the rule of Bittul B'Shishim ie. The non kosher is less that 1/60 of the kosher food, is an Apikores - a non believer in the Torah. The Bnei Yisaschar explains that since our job in this world is to recapture those Holy Sparks, he who demurs from eating this food actually rejects the entire premise of the Torah itself.</p>\n\n<p>This is clearly the interpretation of the Mishna cited above, \"Ohev es Habriyos, U'mekarvin Le'Torah\" that the true \"drawing creatures close to the Torah\" is through this process of recapturing the Holy Sparks, which through it we show our devotion to the Torah and its mission statement for us.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding non food items, as again we all know (of course) that R Chaim Vital in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaar_HaGilgulim?wprov=sfsi1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Shaar HaGilgulim</a> quoting his master the Arizal, every creation can be a reincarnation of a previous soul which needed a Tikkun. So therefore to mekarev them to the Torah ie. Giving them their needed Tikkun is the greatest form of Kiruv to the Torah one can possibly do.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this principle, Rav Aharon Bina Rosh Yeshiva of Netiv Aryeh in the Old City is careful, when faced with a cat or animal crossing his path to exclaim \"I Am Mochel You! - I absolve you from your sins!\" Thus perhaps giving the animal their much needed tikkun. </p>\n\n\n",

Some of the examples it gives are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>God sees Ps 11:4 17:2 Sir 15:18, is watching over with עַל cj. Jb 3429 (Ehrlich);<br>\n  man sees God Ex 24:11 Jb 19:26f\n  חָזָה מַחֲזֶה to see a vision Nu 24:4.16 Ezk 13:7<br>\n  to see as a seer Am 1:1<br>\n  ‏חָזָה לוֹ‎ to select for oneself Ex 18:21 \n  ‏ח׳ בְ‎ to see with pleasure, satisfaction (→ ראה 10) Mi 4:11 Ps 27:4 (= experience) Jb 36:25 Song 7:1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The connection between the two words is obvious: prophets and seers were (or falsely claimed to have been) given visions of the future by God.</p>\n\n<p>But actually this is only a small part of the role of a prophet. Visions of the far future are rare in the scriptures. Instead most of their messages from God implored the people to repent of their sin and turn back to him in faith. When the prophets foretold judgement it wasn't necessarily because they were given a vision of the future, but because Israel's covenant with YHWH promised curses on the sinful (Deuteronomy 27-28). They didn't need visions to know that God would judge the unrepentant. They were called prophets because they obeyed God's call to them to speak boldly to the nation.</p>\n\n<p>But although the term \"seer\" may more strongly imply that the person has been given visions than a \"prophet\" implies (who might receive only a message rather than a vision), it seems to me that the two terms are pretty synonymous in the scriptures.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Particular people are consistently called one title, such as Nathan the prophet and Gad the seer, even though their roles were very similar.

It is taken from the expression <strong>ניב שפתים</strong> (Isaiah 57:19) which is the idea of the lips drooling. When a Prophet on a level lower than Moshe experiences prophecy, they lose control of many of their bodily functions including drooling. The expression <em>Navuah</em> is the process of communication.</p>\n\n<p><em>Chozeh</em> is referring to a prophet who receives a specific level of prophecy on the level of vision (See Zohar, parshat Pekudai, 248:a, chapter 533-536 for details). This is also found at the end of tikkun 39 in Tikkunei Zohar, 79b.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד ויאמר אלקים יהי אור. דא נבואה במראה דאתמר בה (במדבר יב) במראה אליו אתודע ואיהי חזון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is the level of <em>Chazone</em>, like Isaiah 1:1. This expression is also used in connection with the level of Moshe Rabbeinu's prophecy like is found in Tehillim 58:11.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יִשְׂמַח צַדִּיק כִּי <strong>חָזָה</strong> נָקָם פְּעָמָיו יִרְחַץ בְּדַם הָרָשָׁע:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this example, Moshe's prophecy is expressed with the phrase of <em>chazah</em>, like in a vision. In chapter 533 from the Zohar cited, this is described by the phrase <strong>Zeh</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מאתר <strong>דא</strong>, ינקי כל אינון מאריהון דחכמתא, דקיימן למנדע במראה, או ברזא דחלמא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This phrase is described as being able to <strong><em>look</em></strong> at something clearly and say, <em>This is the thing</em>. A good discussion of <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/1618\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the concept of Moshe's level of prophecy can be found here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The lower levels of prophecy come from the level of hearing and are called <em>Bat Kol</em> and <em>Ruach HaKodesh</em> among many other names. In contrast to the level of <strong><em>Zeh</em></strong>, this lower level is described by the phrase <strong><em>Koh</em></strong> (<strong>כֹּה</strong> אָמַר ה')*</p>\n\n<p>This is discussed in the commentary of Rabbeinu Bechai on the Torah (Devarim 33:8) and in Sha'ar Ruach HaKodesh (Drush 1) of Rabbi Chaim Vital.</p>\n\n<p>The different terminology is only distinguishing between the level from which the prophet receives, meaning the source of their prophecy or the level of his reception, meaning the prophets ability to contain and absorb the message. In general, prophets serve the purpose of helping the people to return to the service of G-d. That may be directed to the Jewish people or to the nations at large.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud assumes in many places that anyone may and indeed must kill a <em>rodef</em> if that is necessary to save his intended victims. (E.g. Sanhedrin 22b). This is in turn codified by Rambam (Hilkhot Roteah 1:6 who counts this as a special mitsvah).</li>\n<li>Another category is that of <em>kanaim pog'in bo</em>; (the zealots engage him). mentioned in the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 9:6). This category comprises three subcategories: a) the thief of a consecrated vessel in the Temple. b) one who curses God with the name of an idol (cf. Rambm's commentary there). c) One who has sexual relations with certain (cf. Hilkhot Issurei Biah 12:5) non-Jewish women in the presence of ten Jews (cf. Hilkhot Issurei Biah (12:4).</li>\n<li>A similar law applies to a kohen who performs his duties in the Temple while ritually impure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unlike a <em>rodef</em>, however, the cases of <em>kanaim pog'in</em> are not officially sanctioned (their exact status is debated). If one asks the courts if he should engage in such zealotry, they tell him not to (Sanhedrin 82a, Hilkhot Issurei Biah 12:5). Indeed, in some cases <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53343/8775\">discussed here at length</a>, the subject of <em>kanain pog'in</em> can actually kill the zealot, and be exempt. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53343/8775\">some sources</a> imply that the zealot is never <em>supposed</em> to harm anyone, but rather is <em>exempt</em> from doing so in certain cases.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The next category, (and that most relevant to your examples) is that of <em>moridin aval lo ma'alin</em>; people who are killed, and not rescued (Avodah Zara 26b). These include Jews who betray other Jews to the gentile authorities (Hilkhot Hovel UMazik 8:10), And (most significantly) it applies to heretics (Hilkhot Rotseah 4:14, Hilkhot Avodah Zara 10:2) and certain wanton sinners (ibid). The stated reason (ibid) for the betrayer, the heretic, and the wanton sinner is that they actively threaten and harass other Jews (apparently both physically and spiritually).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As with most of the other categories of extrajudicial punishment, there are numerous restrictive factors, too numerous to list here, that render this nearly (if not wholly) inapplicable.</p>\n\n<p>Significantly, neither of the examples you gave seem to satisfy even the basic parameters delineated above for any of the aforementioned categories. The latter example, for example, is far from the heretic described (Hilkhot Roteah 4:10) as denying prophecy (and by extension Judaism). The former example does not seem similar to the definition of wanton sinner (cf. Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah 5:13) as someone who sins. Furthermore, the examples in Hilkhot Avodah Zara (10:2) are to those who actively remove Jews from the entire Jewish belief system; not just from individual mitsvot. Even a Jew who frequently sins, is not only excluded from the category of those who are lowered (to their demise), but he is excluded from the category of those who are merely not actively saved. Rather, a Jew, even one who sins frequently, must be saved (Hilkhot Rotseah 4:17).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It ought to go without saying that all of the above is a purely academic survey of some related sources and categories relating to extrajudicial punishment. The reality, as usual is much more complex, and applicability of the above is quite limited, or wholly inapplicable. Only a reckless idiot would harm someone based on the claims of an anonymous internet character.</p>\n\n\n",

It says \"Rav Chaim\" meaning a living rabbi - is around your neck.</p>\n\n<p>This has a lot to do with marriage! Would you have a wedding ceremony without a rabbi not just around your neck, but practically AT your neck, before, throughout the ceremony and even afterwards?</p>\n\n<p>Before the wedding, you're using a shadchan who is approved by some rabbi. If not that, and you're finding your bashert on your own, you're going to want the \"schmooze\" about the boy or girl and their family. Who will you ask? The family's rabbi, of course.</p>\n\n<p>Before the wedding, the rabbi will be at your neck advising you, looking over the ketubah, advising the badeken. He will be under the chuppah. You'll have a bunch of rabbis at your neck making <em>sheva brachot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>After marriage, you'll have a rabbi advising you, showing up at a brit or ten, perhaps a pidyon haben, and a few B'nai Mitvah...</p>\n\n<p>You see my point? Rabbis are constatntly at or around your neck. BTW, of course, it doesn't have to be the same rabbi. The Gemarra is just stating that there is a <em>Rav Chaim</em> - a living rabbi constantly around.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>Chas v'shalom</em> that our holy <em>tanaim</em> and <em>amoraim</em>, whose greatness we cannot begin to fathom, lived mundane lives like, <em>l'havdil</em>, people nowadays do. They studied Torah constantly and had no time for other pursuits. <em>Chas v'shalom</em> to think that they had mundane jobs, or married women, or engaged in agriculture. When the holy <em>g'mara</em> speaks of such things, they're to be understood as metaphors and parables, as allusions to deep concepts that we can possibly hope to understand with the help of our forebears, the commentaries on the <em>g'mara</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the <em>g'mara</em> you cite, just a bit up that same page, discusses the possibility of (literally) marrying a woman. Torah study is obviously paramount, but the <em>g'mara</em> ponders briefly whether a mother needs to teach her son Torah (\"איהי מנלן דלא מיחייבא כו׳\"), which would imply that one should in fact marry a woman. It rejects the possibility, thus cementing the idea that a life of Torah precludes marrying a woman. (Rather, those who are fortunate enough to live a Torah life <a href=\"/q/69491\">should marry men</a>.) After that, <em>whenever the</em> g'mara <em>speaks of marrying a woman, working the land, or being employed, it's to be understood as a metaphor for one aspect or another of Torah study.</em></p>\n\n<p>And marrying a woman, specifically, is often used as a metaphor for יגיעה בתורה, working hard to understand Torah. This is because both יגיעה בתורה and marrying a woman are things that are \"found\". As the <em>g'mara</em> says (<em>M'gila</em> 6), \"אם יאמר לך אדם… יגעתי ומצאתי, תאמין\". And as the <em>g'mara</em> quotes (<em>B'rachos</em> 8), I think from <em>Nach</em> somewhere, \"ומוצא אני מר ממות את האשה\".</p>\n\n<p>Now let's look at the passage you're asking about:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ללמוד תורה ולישא אשה ילמוד תורה ואח\"כ ישא אשה ואם א\"א לו בלא אשה ישא אשה ואח\"כ ילמוד תורה אמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל הלכה נושא אשה ואח\"כ ילמוד תורה ר' יוחנן אמר ר׳ חיים בצוארו ויעסוק בתורה ולא פליגי הא לן והא להו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A translation that decodes the metaphor:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If one is trying to prioritize the general study of Torah and יגיעה בתורה, he should study generally first and then work hard. But if he can't understand anything without working hard at it, he should first work hard and only afterward study generally. <em>Rav Y'huda</em> said that <em>Sh'muel</em> said: If he's studying <em>halacha</em>, he must work hard at it from the outset. [<em>Maharasha</em> explains that this is to avoid the possibility of error in practical <em>halacha</em>.] <em>Rabi Yochanan</em> said: If <em>Rav Chayim</em> Soloveitchik is burdening him, he must work hard from the outset. And <em>Sh'muel</em> and <em>Rabi Yochanan</em> aren't arguing: <em>Sh'muel</em>'s rule is for <em>Bavel</em>, [where people were used to the style of <em>Rav Chayim</em> but did not study practical <em>halacha</em>,] and <em>Rabi Yochanan</em>'s is for Israel [where the reverse is true].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously the halls of Torah study nowadays are more like those of <em>Bavel</em>. But people now are lazy and don't want to work hard, so the study of practical <em>halacha</em> is avoided altogether.</p>\n\n\n",

But today, I was met by an old man who was dressed in\n  black, and his head was wrapped up in black, and he entered the Holy\n  of Holies with me, but he did not leave with me. He understood this to\n  be a sign that his death was impending.</p>\n  \n  <p>Indeed, after the festival of\n  Sukkot, he was ill for seven days and died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You asked this question a couple of days after we read Parashas Mishpatim, which concludes with a vision Moshe, Aharon, Nadav, Avihu (two sons of Aharon) and the Seventy Elders had at Mount Sinai (Shemos 24:9-12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיַּ֥עַל מֹשֶׁ֖ה וְאַהֲרֹ֑ן נָדָב֙ וַאֲבִיה֔וּא וְשִׁבְעִ֖ים מִזִּקְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃ וַיִּרְא֕וּ אֵ֖ת אֱלֹקי יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְתַ֣חַת רַגְלָ֗יו כְּמַעֲשֵׂה֙ לִבְנַ֣ת הַסַּפִּ֔יר וּכְעֶ֥צֶם הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם לָטֹֽהַר׃ וְאֶל־אֲצִילֵי֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לֹ֥א שָׁלַ֖ח יָד֑וֹ וַֽיֶּחֱזוּ֙ אֶת־הָ֣אֱלֹקים וַיֹּאכְל֖וּ וַיִּשְׁתּֽוּ׃\n   וַיֹּ֨אמֶר ה' אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה עֲלֵ֥ה אֵלַ֛י הָהָ֖רָה וֶהְיֵה־שָׁ֑ם וְאֶתְּנָ֨ה לְךָ֜ אֶת־לֻחֹ֣ת הָאֶ֗בֶן</p>\n  \n  <p>Moshe, Aharon, Nadav, Avihu and seventy of the elders of Israel ascended. And they was the G-d of Israel, and under His Feet was like a brickwork of sapphire, and like the midst of the sky in purity. And to the leaders of the Children of Israel He did not send his \"Hand\"; and they saw G-d and they ate and drank.</p>\n  \n  <p>And Hashem said to Moshe: Go up to me mountainward, and be there, and I will give you the tablets of stone...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the question could be asked not only of that medrash, but also of these verse. As well as of Yirmiyahu's and Yechezqeil's visions of the Divine Chariot.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, this gives us many comments by medieval commentators to draw from.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says that they saw something like the Ma’aseh HaMerkavah, the chariot that Yechezkel saw. “And above the firmament which was over [the chayos’] heads looked like sappire stone, the image of a throne; and on the image of a throne was an image that looked like a person upon it above it.” (Yechezkel 1:26) And, in fact, Targum Onkelos on our verse inserts the word “yeqar” to say that they saw the “glory of the G-d of Israel”. This parallels Yechezkel’s description of seeing something that “looked like the image of Kevod Hashem, the glory of Hashem”. (Ibid v. 28)</p>\n\n<p>According to Rav Sa’adia Gaon (Emunos veDei'os 2:10), there is a kavod nivra – a created entity that is Divine Glory. The vision at Mount Sinai and that of Yechezkel were not of Hashem, as that is logically impossible. Rather, they saw this kavod. The Rambam’s approach (Guide to the Perplexed 1:64) is similar to Rav Saadia’s, except that he writes that the phrase “Kevod Hashem” is a synonym; it could refer to either Hashem Himself, in all His glory, or it could be used to refer to the kavod nivra. In our case, the text means that they saw the kavod nivra. However, in Moshe’s later request, he was asking to see Hashem Himself, which is why he was unable to have his desire granted.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Sa’adia Gaon writes that the shechinah is indeed part of the physical world, but that it is a kavod nivra. In fact, Rav Sa’adia Gaon holds that the term “shechinah” refers to any miraculous thing that reminds the viewer that Hashem is shochein beqirbo, dwelling with him. Thus, the pillars of fire and of cloud were the shechinah, as were the vision of Mount Sinai and of the Merkavah. Rav Sa’adia Gaon’s notion of kavod nivra can be a physical object. Therefore this vision could occur through regular, physical sight.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the Rambam’s opinion diverges. He holds (Guide 2:6) that the kavod nivrah could only be seen prophetically. It is different in kind to the pillars of fire and of smoke, which were physical entities created miraculously.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban disagrees with both. In his commentary on the verse where Hashem promises Yaaqov that He will descend with him to Egypt (Bereishis 46:1), the Ramban says that “Sh-echinah” is a name of Hashem (which is why I just hyphenated his version, as I would any other name of G-d), not a created thing (nor a class of them). However, this does not mean that Mosheh and the elders actually saw Hashem in human form. The Ramban on our verse explains that the vision was prophetic. It would seem that in the Ramban’s view, a prophecy can be a vision of something that cannot truly exist.</p>\n\n<p>This indicates that underlying our debate there must be a basic difference in how the Rambam and the Ramban understand prophecy. Even though the Rambam agrees that the vision was prophetic, he still argues that it could not have been of Hashem, because He has no body. But that brings us to a different question, and a different discussion.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your question, it would seem that in the medrash, Rabbi Yishmael Kohein Gadol either:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>saw the entity G-d created, His Glory (as per Rav Saadia Gaon)</li>\n<li>prophetically experienced -- i.e. \"saw\" in scare-quotes -- this created Glory, and his mind cast this experience into the more familiar image of an old man (the Rambam); or</li>\n<li>received a message from G-d in metaphor form, and within that metaphor, He chose to represent Himself as an old man.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Gemara Berachot 7a: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Similarly, it was taught in a baraita that Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha, the High Priest, said: Once, on Yom Kippur, I entered the innermost sanctum, the Holy of Holies, to offer incense, and in a vision I saw Akatriel Ya, the Lord of Hosts, one of the names of God expressing His ultimate authority,  <strong>seated upon a high and exalted throne (see Isaiah 6). \n  And He said to me: Yishmael, My son, bless Me.</strong> \n  I said to Him the prayer that God prays: “May it be Your will that Your mercy overcome Your anger, \n  and may Your mercy prevail over Your other attributes, and may You act toward Your children with the attribute of mercy, \n  and may You enter before them beyond the letter of the law.”\n  <strong>The Holy One, Blessed be He, nodded His head and accepted the blessing.</strong>  This event teaches us that you should not take the blessing of an ordinary person lightly. If God asked for and accepted a man’s blessing, all the more so that a man must value the blessing of another man. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a metaforic image illustrating the service in Temple on Yom Kippur which is figurative of an appointment in a precise material place between  G-d and Jewish people representative. The whole service in the Temple has an allegorical dimension which plays with analogy between G-d and human king-judge. See in several places the Sefer Hachinuch,  e. g.  95. In many places the chinuch explains the anthropomorphism of Tora and  chazal as \"from the side of the receivers\",  the language is addressed to men and is from human language. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is a similar Gemara in Sanhedrin (95b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אתא קודשא בריך הוא, ואדמי ליה כגברא סבא</p>\n  \n  <p>The Holy one, blessed be He, went and appeared before him\n  [Sancheriv] as an old man</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seemingly, from the simple reading of the Gemara, G-d can take a physical form.</p>\n\n<p>However the Yad Rama (Ibid.) says that to suggest such a thing is considered heretical.</p>\n\n<p>Instead the Yad Rama gives two answers:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It was not G-d Himself, rather it was an Angel, or emissary on behalf of G-d who appeared to Sancheriv.</li>\n<li>It was a dream, and Sanheriv <em>imagined</em> in his own mind a representation of  G-d appeared as an old man.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These two answers of the Yad Rama may also be utilized to answer your question. Either it was a Angel, which can and do take physical forms. Or it was a dream, and the Kohen Gadol imagined it.</p>\n\n\n",

The entire story of the decree on all women is presented as a mockery and derision of the institution of the Persian monarchy, and specifically Achashveirosh.</p>\n\n<p>The following quote is taken from the shiur on VBM entitled: \n<a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/shiur-04-kings-judgment-responsible-or-ridiculous-rule#_ftnref9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shiur #04: The King's Judgment: Responsible or Ridiculous Rule?</a> I highly recommend reading the entire article, (as well as his entire book :) ) which contains further proofs of Rav Grossman's reading, as well as an analysis of this story's allusions to other parts of Megillas Esther and other stories in Tanach. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is reasonable that Achashverosh was enraged by the refusal of his wife, the queen, to appear when so commanded.  Less apparent is why the king invited the ministers of the kingdom to consult on what to do with Queen Vashti.  Seemingly, tensions between a couple should be sorted out between themselves; even if a person might wish to share his predicament with his close friends, he would not summon an urgent meeting of government ministers!...</p>\n  \n  <p>The irony is especially striking in light of the attention paid to the names of the ministers and to their official position – all of which seems unnecessarily detailed.  The emphasis is highlighted through the structure of the sentence.  First there is a prelude to direct speech: \"The king said to the wise men who knew the times\" – and the reader expects to hear what the king said.  Instead, there follows a lengthy description of the status of these wise men, along with their names: \"The closest to him were Karshena, Shetar, Admata, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memukhan – the seven princes of Persia and Mede, who beheld the king's face and who sat first in the kingdom.\" The reader can almost imagine the trumpets blaring as these ministers enter… However, the reader once again asks himself (as the ministers probably do, too) why does the king urgently summon them? With obvious cynicism, the narrative formulates the point of the gathering in the following way: \"For the law of what to do with the queen, Vashti, for not having performed the bidding of the king, Achashverosh, via the chamberlains\" (1:15).  The addendum, \"Via the chamberlains,\" at the end of the sentence appears to be meant as a mockery of the king, who urgently gathers all of his ministers but who has not spoken with his wife; he invites all the legislators of the kingdom for a consultation, but fails to ask his wife to explain her refusal.</p>\n  \n  <p>The ministers find themselves in a most difficult quandary.  On one hand, they cannot do that which, seemingly, they would most want to do in this situation: to gently bring the king to his senses, encourage him to drink some coffee, and wait for him to sober up.  Any minister daring to offer such a proposal will obviously be regarded as showing contempt for the crown.  On the other hand, it is difficult to think of any law that may be legislated with a view to solving the king's problem with his wife.  The law, by nature, is a general sphere that applies to the entire kingdom, while in the instance at hand the problem pertains exclusively to the royal couple.  Moreover, the ministers must bear in mind that within a few days the king is likely to sober up, and then they will have to give a logical accounting for the special law that they passed!\n   \n  The most brilliant of the ministers, as quickly becomes apparent, is Memukhan.  An examination of his response to the king shows how he resolves the ministers' quandary:\n   \n  \"Memukhan said, before the king and the ministers: Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king, but also ALL the ministers and ALL the peoples in ALL the provinces of King Achashverosh.  For word of the queen will become known to ALL the women, making their husbands contemptible in their eyes, as they shall say: 'King Achashverosh commanded that Queen Vashti be brought before him – and she did not appear!' And the princesses of Persia and Mede, who will have heard of what the queen did, shall tell of it to ALL the king's princes, and there shall be great contempt and wrath.  If it please the king, let a royal edict proceed from him, and let it be written among the laws of Persia and Mede and not be altered – that Vashti shall not come before King Achashverosh, and the king shall give her royal estate to another, who is better than her.  And when the king's decree which he shall proclaim shall be heard in ALL of his kingdom, which is extensive, then ALL the women will give honor to their husbands, both great and lowly\" (1:16-20).</p>\n  \n  <p>Memukhan starts with the central idea that he will develop in the course of his monologue: \"Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king.\" This idea is emphasized through the use of the word \"all\" which is repeated over and over, a total of seven times, in his speech.  This word sums up the point that Memukhan is making: the problem is not the king's personal problem, but rather an issue that affects ALL of the kingdom and ALL of the couples living within it.[2] We can almost hear Memukhan telling the king (if only through hints): \"How fortunate that my lord the king has invited your important ministers.  Indeed, a general problem confronts us and it must be addressed by means of a general, thought-out law.  The issue at stake is not, as some people might think, a matter of a private problem between the king and his wife.  No! The entire kingdom faces a problem; every couple now confronts inestimable strife.\" The sophisticated reader imagines Memukhan winking at the other ministers as he holds forth.  This is hinted at in the introduction to his words: \"Memukhan said, before the king AND THE MINISTERS.\" They, too, await breathlessly the solution to the dilemma in which they have unwillingly been placed.  And Memukhan supplies the goods, by pretending to side with the king's approach, only exaggerating it even further.<a href=\"http://old.herzog.ac.il/tafkid/item/1604-2015-12-28-09-42-30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3</a></p>\n  \n  <p>The king is happy with Memukhan's suggestion, as are the other ministers: \"The thing was good in the eyes of the king and the ministers, and the king did as Memukhan had said\" (1:21).  (We may assume that the king was happy with the \"good advice\" that he had received, while the ministers were glad that Memukhan's quick thinking had removed them from their predicament.) Immediately the king puts the advice into practice: \"He sent letters to all of the king's provinces, to each province according to its writing and to every people in accordance with its language, that every man might rule in his own house, and speak according to the language of the people\" (1:22).  We can imagine the reaction of the Persians as they gathered in the town squares to hear the new law that had just been promulgated, and their surprise upon hearing that from now onwards, if a husband asked his wife for a cup of coffee, it was forbidden for her to refuse…</p>\n  \n  <p>This model serves to expose Achashverosh's kingdom in all of its fickleness.  How are matters decided? Does order really prevail in this world power? The reader who enters the experience of the king's momentary caprices that establish new laws in the kingdom, is aware of one of the most important devices that advance the plot, but also senses the narrator's biting regard for the norms and procedures of Achashverosh's rule and – as I shall propose later on – for the institution of royalty altogether.  Here, too, we discern the disparity between the revealed and concealed levels.  On the revealed level, the king is described as someone who consults his ministers before legislating a new law.  Even for the purpose of deciding \"what should be done with Queen Vashti\" he appeals to the appropriate hierarchy, and the law is accepted through the accepted channels.  At the same time, on the concealed level, the reader senses the cynicism that pervades this scene.  Contrary to the impression that the literal text conveys, if an entire legal process is required in order for the king to decide what to do with his wife, then the entire legal system and the legislative procedure are being presented with a healthy dose of derision.<a href=\"https://www.korenpub.com/maggid_en_usd/astr-mgilt-strim.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">9</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This reading also works well with the Talmud's assertion that Memuchan was Haman, as we see that both of them viewed the rebelliousness of one individual (Vashti/Mordechai) as an endemic problem that needed to be taken care of even to the point of execution (Women/Jews).

    "content": "# Does Judaism consider women inferior?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Orthodox Judaism, women may not be rabbis, be counted as part of a minyan, leyn from the Torah, or study the Talmud. It even <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2015/11/09/torah-study-for-women/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that to teach a woman Torah is to teach her obscenity! (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.21b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 21b</a>) </p>\n\n<p>In addition, women are exempt and even discouraged from a large number of mitzvas that are central to Jewish practice, such as praying three times a day and laying tefillin. It seems from all this that women have a secondary and subjugated role in Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Is this true? Why would G-d and the Torah condone such a thing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 40)\n\n<p>This is a fair question. You are far from the only person who feels this way.</p>\n<p>As an Orthodox woman who respects the traditional prohibition on Talmud study for women, as well as the many other Jewish laws which appear to limit women, I see it like this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 33:18</a></p>\n<p>And of Zebulun he said, Rejoyce, Zebulun,\nin thy going out; and Issachar, in thy tents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Traditional Jewish life involves a division of labor, actually many. In the times of the Temple, certain duties were performed by the priestly class, others by the levitical class. A slave had certain rights and responsibilities; so did a mamzer; so did a scholar. A mourner, even today, has different duties than one who is not in mourning, and a sick person has different obligations from one who is not sick.</p>\n<p>One of the clearest examples today of Judaism's specific assignment of rights and responsibilities by person is the different religious obligations of a minor and an adult. A minor is responsible, religiously, for very little; an adult (of either sex) for very much. This seems entirely natural, as indeed it is.</p>\n<p>But let us look at it again. Would we ever conclude from a child's reduced obligation in religious commandments that Judaism hates or oppresses children, or considers them inferior in holiness, in essential importance, or in connection to G-d? No; this is ridiculous! A child is simply a child. A child, by doing his best to be decent, does what is required of him, and this is all; he serves his spiritual purpose, which could not be called \"less\" than that of an adult.</p>\n<p>Although it is more obvious to modern people that a child should have a different set of rights and responsibilities from an adult, than that a woman should have different rights and responsibilities from a man, it was not always, and need not be. Remember, Judaism makes numerous divisions--practically as many as possible. The twelve Tribes received different blessings, inheritances, and missions based on the personalities of Yakov's sons. What are the odds that the Torah would overlook the striking difference between men and women?</p>\n<p>It doesn't. Beginning with its account of the creation of humankind, Torah specifies two moieties. These are man and woman. From the earliest self-conception of the Israelites, women are referred to as \"Beit Yakov\" and men as \"B'nei Yisroel,\" and the Commandments are presented to each group differently. This distinction has remained firm in Judaism for the first thirty-six centuries of its history, only coming into question under the influence of the dissenting movements in the last two hundred years. Even now, the influence of this question is not central. Judaism maintains, and shows all signs of continuing to maintain, traditionally separate roles for men and women.</p>\n<h3>What are these?</h3>\n<p>In my understanding, men carry out public observances and governance--roles toward which they are, broadly speaking, naturally inclined. Under \"governance\" falls Torah study, since Rabbi Eliezer's prohibition of Torah study for women is <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UR5umABxVmgC&pg=PA161&lpg=PA161&dq=prohibition%20of%20pilpul%20for%20women&source=bl&ots=9jGeBf7sv3&sig=e1ibjhbFk3I5LZConFJaKGCVXLM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiisZX0t57SAhXMRSYKHcn6DEsQ6AEILTAG#v=onepage&q=prohibition%20of%20pilpul%20for%20women&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">understood</a> mostly to apply to the aspects of Torah dealing with theoretical rationale for legal decisions. Women establish and govern the private sphere, which is equally important, if not more important in Judaism. They learn written Torah, halacha, and many parts of oral Torah through the prism of becoming an akeret habayit, the bedrock of a Jewish home, and the steward of the next generation.</p>\n<p>When Rabbi Eliezer said that to teach a woman Torah (meaning a certain part of Torah) is to teach her lewdness, I understand he meant that doing so perverts Judaism's deep-rooted and sacred ideas about division of labor between the sexes. Perhaps easier to understand is how it might be \"lewdness\" to teach a child about something for grown-ups.</p>\n<p>The shared mission of Jewish men, women, and children is to serve G-d, and to bring sanctity into this world--and ultimately to be a light unto the nations, to heal the world, and to bring redemption. It is a big mission. It requires many separate corps doing individual duties. So we have them. It is an honor to be a Jewish woman because I have an unassailable part in this mission.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 34)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In addition, women are exempt and even discouraged from a large number of mitzvas that are central to Jewish practice, such as praying three times a day and laying tefillin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is close to completely false and at least dramatically overstated. Women are obligated in the vast, vast majority of Mitzvot (somewhere around 585/613=95% of the biblical ones), including prayer, and they are generally still encouraged or at least welcome to fulfill most of the dozen or two they are exempt from that they can. </p>\n\n<p>Mitzvot women are at least welcome to fulfill despite being exempt (at least according to those who exempt them in various cases): </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>having children</li>\n<li>reciting Shema with its blessings</li>\n<li>hearing Shofar</li>\n<li>living in a Sukkah</li>\n<li>taking a Lulav</li>\n<li>counting the Omer</li>\n<li>remembering Amalek</li>\n<li>saying Grace with a Zimmun</li>\n<li>praying with a Minyan (including answering Kaddish, Kedusha, etc.)</li>\n<li>saying Hallel</li>\n<li>giving [remembrance of] the half-Shekel tax</li>\n<li>and more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Most of the other Mitzvot that they are exempt from relate to the Temple/Korbanot (Pidyon HaBen, Kohein avoiding cemeteries) or male primary or secondary sex characteristics (circumcision, shaving with a razor).</p>\n\n<p>The main exception is Tefillin (which you mentioned) where women are discouraged from donning Tefillin (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.38.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 38:3</a>), and this is very much in parallel to men also being generally discouraged from donning Tefillin more than the bare minimum obligation of donning them during prayers (for women the bare minimum obligation is technically zero).</p>\n\n<p>There's also some discouragement towards women wearing Tzitzit (since even men don't really need to wear four-cornered garments if they don't want to, it can be seen as haughty for a woman to go out of her way to do so (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.17.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 17:2</a>)) and in some communities aspects of Torah study (cf. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.246.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD 246:6</a>), though honestly for most people learning <em>all</em> the Halakhot they need for their lives (prayer, blessings, Shabbat (!), holidays, Kashrut (!), Niddah, Mikvah, honoring parents/elders/scholars, charity, Mezuzah, agricultural laws, Challah, mourning, various monetary laws) is enough to last a lifetime, and women certainly need to do that.</p>\n\n<p>What you're noticing is rather that women don't lead public communal Mitzva observance: they can't be rabbis, but they can teach and inspire; they can't be Chazzanim/Ba'alei Keriya, but they can pray and benefit from public prayer just like men; they don't serve as priests in the Temple, but they can bring offerings to God; they don't serve on courts, but they deserve and receive full justice in all monetary matters. Remember most men too are neither rabbis, Chazzanim, Ba'alei Keriya, Kohanim, nor Dayanim. Being part of the community and not among its leaders is a totally normal, acceptable, and respectable (if not ideal, cf. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avot 1:10</a>) path for a Jew.</p>\n\n<p>You noted that women don't count for a Minyan, but that's not really true. It's generally assumed that they count for a Minyan <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/4323/759\">in contexts where they are obligated</a> and don't count in contexts where they are not obligated. The latter case most notably includes public prayer in which women are not obligated (they can choose still to participate in it, as above). But while public prayer may seem to be one of the most central Jewish practices <em>which is distinctly Jewish</em>, that does not mean that raising a family, earning a living, helping the poor and the sick, giving charity, educating others, not to mention private personal prayer and study, are not central to the Jewish experience. If anything they are more central! Just because other nations do those things too doesn't make them less important in the eyes of God. It's hard to think of more central Jewish practices than growing a family and helping the needy (including education and healing).</p>\n\n<p>I don't mean to say Jewish thought doesn't approach and treat women and men differently, just the legal distinctions can be finer than is commonly portrayed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n\n<p>A user left the following very apt comment on my previous <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/80380/1516\">answer</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You say that women have an important role in Judaism, but of course\n  the question was not whether women have a role at all, but whether\n  they have an inferior role. So the real question is, if, by a freak\n  accident of nature, a particular woman is inclined to carry out public\n  observances and governance (roles traditionally conferred upon men),\n  does Orthodox Judaism hold her back, and if so, how can this be\n  justified without considering women as inferior? – DepressedDaniel</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I thank @DepressedDaniel for his serious question and offer the following reply only as a beginning, and in subjugation to the heartfelt suggestion that that any man or woman in this position (i.e., of having \"freak\" inclinations not in keeping with the Torah's assumptions) find and consult over the long term with a wise, sensitive, and knowledgeable <a href=\"http://www.beingjewish.com/conversion/rabbi_lists.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rabbi</a>, <a href=\"http://www.findamashpia.info/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rebbetzin</a> or <a href=\"http://www.sdiworld.org/find-a-spiritual-director\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentor</a> with whom he feels he can speak freely. The latter, in combination with (1) a peer and (2) a spiritual mentee (both of which the person in question should also endeavor to find), will provide support, comfort, encouragement, and direction in a way that one cannot obtain from within oneself. Anyone reading this post who needs help finding such people is warmly invited to email me at sah3918@gmail.com; I will do what I can for you. </p>\n\n<p>Neither G-d nor our Sages were unaware of the complexity of sexual identity, and the ways in which this complexity might trouble a binary system and its subjects. Indeed, G-d created this complexity with great deliberation and wisdom. Indeed, He created the Torah to match. Thus the rabbis identified not two but <a href=\"https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/gender-identity-in-halakhic-discourse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">six genders</a>--including, it seems, \"the woman who doesn't seem like a woman\"--and did their best to correctly determine Torah's role for each. </p>\n\n<p>But these determinations would seem to do little to provide solutions for modern life, or to console the woman who looks and feels completely feminine, but has a desire in her heart to fulfill a public religious role or to perform traditionally masculine mitzvos. Shouldn't she be allowed?</p>\n\n<p>Believe it or not, this question is not new, and it too has been answered by our Sages. Sefer Maharil discusses the example of Bruriah, an exceptionally gifted female Torah scholar--her words are all over the Gemara--whose involvement in Torah study ultimately led to wickedness and tragedy. It notes that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Beruriah's bad end demonstrates her initial weakness in not relying\n  upon the words of our Sages. Similarly the wisest of men (King\n  Solomon) declared, 'I will marry many wives and not go astray' (see\n  Sanhedrin 21b).\" (qtd. in Ellinson, <em>Serving the Creator</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The short answer, then, is no.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah, in contrast to popular wisdom, commands us <em>not</em> to follow our hearts. There is, Torah suggests, better life at the end of an effort to serve G-d and help others even at the expense of our own dreams, wishes, and persuasions. It is this very effort to make room for G-d that gives life to, and even creates holiness; as the Kotzker Rebbe famously said, \"Where is G-d? Wherever we let Him in.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The yoke of the Torah is like a heavy load upon a strong donkey.\n  (Bereishis Rabba 99:9) </p>\n  \n  <p>\"Your Employer is trustworthy to pay you the\n  reward for your labor.\" \n  (Pirkei Avot 2.19 and 2.21) </p>\n  \n  <p>“The reward is in\n  proportion to the exertion” (Pirkei Avot 5.26)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A woman who dreams and yearns with her heart to do the roles reserved for men by Judaism will no doubt feel every ounce of the weight of Torah upon her, holding her down. And yet, she is not alone in her struggle to bear the Torah. She should think of the rebuffed converts, the agunot, the incarcerated and persecuted; the desperately poor; the people whose physical or mental health makes it nearly impossible for them  to keep halacha; those who cannot find anyone to marry; those who will never, because they are gay, be able to combine physical love with emotional love and life partnership within the frame of the Torah--and who keep Torah anyway. G-d gives people enormous burdens. But just as He perfectly understands these burdens, He is exquisitely aware of every calorie of energy the burdened expend trying to serve Him anyway. To paraphrase Chagigah 5b, the Holy One cries every day for one who does mitzvos in spite of a handicap. And this itself is the reward: That one serves G-d to the point of moving Him.</p>\n\n<p>But the yoke bends before it ever breaks us:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Yalsa the wife of Rav Nachman said to him, 'It is known that all that\n  the Torah has prohibited there is something similar to it that has\n  been permitted. For example, blood is prohibited while liver is\n  permitted,… – I want to [know what it is like to] eat meat cooked in\n  milk.' Rav Nachman had the cook prepare fried udder for her.\"  Chullin\n  109b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where is G-d? Wherever we let Him in. Consider the essential roles of women as bodkaniyot, rabaniyot, teachers, principals, heads of organizations, maharatot, yoatzot,toenot, mashpi'yot, shluchot, writers, speakers, counselors, doctors for Jewish women, leaders of chesed organizations, etc., etc. Who should do these if not precisely the intelligent, idealistic women who are regretting the fact that they cannot become dayanim and chazzanim? Is it really right, and is it good for women, that the best women should be swept away from frum Judaism and into other movements? Where does that leave frum women??</p>\n\n<p>That is, one not only has options to do what one yearns for: one has an imperative to do so. Take your desire to learn, to create, to inspire, and to connect with G-d through words of Torah and acts of Jewish faith, and apply them assiduously to the opportunities G-d has opened for you.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ben Bagbag said: Turn it [Torah] over and turn it over because\n  everything is in it. (Pirkei Avot 5.22)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>--This is how we know that anyone can live by Torah. Look at it: the Torah has seventy facets; reflected in its radiant prism, [any]one can find a life. Where one extreme seems to exist there, the other extreme is not far.</p>\n\n<p>The torahitic prohibitions on women's involvement in certain acts leave, to be sure, a great deal of room to play. For example, the matters of women's learning Torah and even issuing halachic rulings have given rise to a surprisingly wide range of halachic opinions within Orthodoxy. Torah and even Talmud learning by women is permitted by <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/sheets/21640\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">various</a> poskim--I <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/73153/what-was-the-lubavitcher-rebbes-position-on-womens-gemara-study\">might</a> add the Lubavitcher Rebbe--under <a href=\"https://www.jofa.org/sites/default/files/uploaded_files/10002_u/00881.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">various</a> circumstances. The Chid\"a to Choshen Mishpat 7:12, Minchat Chinuch in halacha 78, and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/sheets/25287\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">other sources</a> suggest that opinions on whether a woman may pasken halacha are not a monolith. Of course, one must consult one's personal rav for a ruling appropriate to one's community. I suggest only that if this matter affects a woman's quality of life very significantly, she might, with the guidance of experts, find a way to take advantage of the Torah's nuances to find a viable path.</p>\n\n<p>We are supposed to live by and for the Torah and not, ch\"v, die for it. If a Jew is caused extreme suffering by the Torah's apparent view of him or her, I would first suggest that he or she has not correctly understood the Torah's view; then, I would suggest consulting a rov or a trusted spiritual counselor for advice. But pikuach nefesh--concern for human life--reigns supreme over most all we have in Torah. If you truly need to lay tefillin in order to have the koach to continue to exist, I as a woman will pasken for you: <em>do it</em>. </p>\n\n<p>And if you don't anyway, we call that a Kiddush Hashem--a sanctification of G-d's name.</p>\n\n\n",

If he brings an animal to be sacrificed as a burnt offering, we should receive it.</p>\n<p>If a gentile who observes the seven mitzvot gives charity, we should accept it from him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to R. Moshe Feinstein, when the Rambam writes that a gentile may perform one of the Torah's mitzvot, he refers only to mitzvot such as charity which we find gentiles fulfilling in Tanach, but not other mitzvot. R. Moshe bases his position in part on the first halacha quoted herein. However, in a responsum the Rambam clearly does not hold this distinction (see <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://download.yutorah.org/2006/1053/735063.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwje8NmP6-_cAhVK54MKHV87BqkQFjABegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw3FqRmQx3uXF69207C2IkhV\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). The Beiur Halacha too (end of 304) writes that a ger toshav can accept additional mitzvot. Although the Rambam writes that a Noahide may not add to his mitzvot, there may be a difference between \"adding\" and volunteering.</p>\n\n\n",

Joseph: This is concerning the\nkings of Israel; but the kings of the house of David are judged and\njudge. As it is written [Jer. xxi. 12]: \"O house of David, thus said\nthe Lord: Exercise justice on every morning.\" We see that they did\njudge; and if they were not to be judged, how could they judge?--as is\nsaid above by Resh Lakish. And what is the reason it is prohibited to\nthe kings of Israel? Because an unfortunate thing happened as follows:\nThe slave of King Janai murdered a person; and Simeon b. Cheta'h said\nto the sages: Notwithstanding that he is the slave of the king, he\nmust be tried. They sent to the king: Your slave has killed a man. And\nJanai sent his slave to them to be tried. However, they sent to him:\nYou also must appear before the court. As it is written [Ex. xxi. 29]:\n\"Warning has been given to its owner\"--which means the owner of the ox\nmust appear at the time the ox is tried. He then came and took a seat.\nSaid Simeon b. Cheta'h: King Janai, arise, so that the witnesses shall\ntestify while you stand; yet not for us do you rise, but for Him who\nsaid a word, and the world was created. As it reads [Deut. xix. 17]:\n\"Stand before the Lord.\" And the king answered: It must not be as you\nsay, but as the majority of your colleagues shall decide. Simeon then\nturned to his right, but his colleagues cast their eyes upon the floor\nwithout any answer; and the same did his colleagues at his left.\nSimeon then exclaimed: You are all troubled in mind (disconcerted)!\nMay the One who rules minds take revenge upon you. Gabriel came then\nand smote them to the floor, that they died. And at that time it was\nenacted that a king should neither judge nor be judged, neither be a\nwitness nor be witnessed against.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The issue is to wear the two, RTT and Rashi T. together. This cannot may be discreet. So the word of Bet Yosef regard the problem of a public wearing of Rabenu Tam Tefilin. In this case we can understand why the Baer Heytev adresses again the question. The BH addresses an other practice: to wear the RTT at the end of the prayer, alone, after Removing Rashi Tefilin.</p>\n<p>Baer Heytev:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נשאלתי על איש אחד שהיה נוהג להניח תפילין של ר\"ת לאחר התפלה בפרהסיא בפני הקהל אי מיחזי כיוהרא. פסק בתשובת מהר\"ש הלוי דמיחזי כיוהרא וצריך שיבטל מנהגו. וכ\"כ בתשובת שבות יעקב ח\"ב סי' מ\"ד שאפי' אם מקצת עושין יש בו משום יוהרא ואם מניחן בפני אדם גדול שאין נוהג להניחם כי אם בקרב ביתו ודאי מחזי כיוהרא ע\"ש.‏</p>\n<p>I received a question about a man, who used to wear RTT after the prayer, in front of everyone.  is it considered as a manner to brag?</p>\n<p>The answer in Teshuvat Maharash Halevi is that this is regarded as a kind of boasting, and he hav to stom this habit. Ther is a similar answer in Teshuvot Shevut Yaakov, part II, number 44, and he added that even if he is not alone, but few people make this, there is a problem of boasting. Additionally, if he wear RTT in front of a great man who prefer to wear them at home, there is obviously a problem of boasting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We learn that the problem of brag is only in front of other people who has not this habit. The fact to wear RTT at home doesn't present problem of Yuhara, but, the chumra needs to be proportional to the general level of the person.</p>\n<p>It seems from the above shut reporting, that the context is very important. For example, nowadays in Israel in a shtible, if you see someone wearing RTT, everyone will think that he is chasidish or in any group who has the minhag to wear RTT, he only makes as his friends and / or family. You can judge the thing only in the context you are. E.G. if a given morning, in a lituanian Yeshiva, a lituanian Bochur decide to wear RTT in front of the Rosh Yeshiva, the question of Yuhara will be actual.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code> purchasing and wearing tefilin shel Rabenu Tam outweigh the risk of appearing arrogant</code>  ---> no, if it is made discretly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

See there for details.</p>\n\n<p>The Maggid Mishna (Ta'aniyot 5:5) quoting Geonim writes that only fast days which are occurring on their intended dates can be observed on Friday, but this fast which was supposed to be on the 13th should be pushed back to Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur (OC 686) says the fast can't be held on Friday because all the extra petitionary prayers will prevent people from adequately preparing for Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>The common custom nowadays is to fast on Thursday, but the Rama (OC 686:2) notes that if there is a reason to eat on Thursday (eg. the meal at a Brit Milah) then they can have the meal on Thursday and observe the fast on Friday. (Not everyone agreed with this position.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ta'anit Ester is a <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2011/03/origin-of-taanit-esther.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">relatively recent custom</a>(1), so the Talmud never standardised it. Therefore, it is unsurprising that there is some variation in its observance (and even in its name, with some early sources (such as Raavyah) referring to it as תענית פורים). One of these points of variation is what to do If Purim falls out on Sunday; is the pre-holiday fast (which cannot be performed on Shabbat) pushed back to Friday, or pushed further back to Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>R. Mehahem HaMeiri discusses this in his Magen Avot (which discusses and defends the customs of his native Provence)(2) in chapter 23:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהם נוהגים כל זמן שאירע פורים באחד בשבת שמקדימין את התענית ליום חמישי שלפניו. ואנו נוהגים להקדימו לששי לבד אעפ\"י שהוא ערב שבת...  צוחו עלינו למה שאנו עושים שלא כהלכה וממה שראו בסוף מגלת תענית (פי\"א) כל שנשבע להתענות בערב שבת ובעריו\"ט הרי זו שבועת שוא ... אבל תענית אסתר שאינו חובה גמורה כל כך ושאין בו דין אקדומי פורענותא דאדרבא תענית של שמחה הוא, ראוי להקדימו לחמישי כדי שלא להתענות בערב שבת, ונמצא שאתם עושים שלא כהלכה. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He explains that their custom was to fast on the preceding Friday, and others mocked them and noted that in Megillat Ta'anit it states that if one vows to fast on Friday, the vow is inoperative. And [while bona fide fast days may be observed on Friday and we apply the dictum that we do not observe sad days earlier than necessary] Ta'anit Ester is not a bona fide obligation that would lead us to overrule the usual no fasting on Friday rule, and furthermore, it is a happy day, so the dictum of not observing sad days earlier than necessary doesn't apply.</p>\n\n<p>That is their reasoning. Meiri himself defends his practice, explaining that the Megilat Ta'anit is only referring to fasting for no good reason:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא\"כ זו שבמגילת תענית אנו מפרשים אותה במתענה שלא לשום כונה טובה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He cites Ra'avad as agreeing with this, but clarifying that the fast should be limited to the time that the sun is up:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואף הרב הגדול הראב\"ד כך הוא דעתו אלא שהוסיף בפירושו שאע\"פ שמתענה ומשלים דוקא שלא לאכול בעוד שהחמה בעולם, ואף על פי שהיא בשקיעתה אחר שדמדומי חמה עדין נוצצים, אבל מששקעה החמה לגמרי שאינו אלא תוספות אינו נמנע מלאכול מתורת תענית, שאין תוספות לתענית במקום שתוספות שבת לוקה, וכתב בלשון זה: ולזו נהגו בתענית אסתר שחל להיות בערב שבת שאוכלין תיכף ליציאתם מבית הכנסת ואין ממתינין עד חשיכה. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Mordekhai b. Hillel (Megillah remez 776) is of the opinion that the fast should be observed on Thursday as opposed to Friday, since on Friday people are busy preparing for Shabbat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ן ומה שאנו מקדימין התענית ליום ה' כשחל פורים אחד בשבת מפרש שם מפני שאין יכול לקובעו בע\"ש מפני שהן טרודין לטרוח בכבוד שבת </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(1) Yes, I am familiar with Rabbenu Tam (cited in Rishonim to Megillah 2a), but that does not seem to be historically correct, and it is contradicted by the Yerushalmi. Yes I am familiar with the Sh'iltot, but that is a later addition.</p>\n\n<p>(2) Yes, I know he was from Languedoc. (Its close enough).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer would be that the days that we fast on Friday are days that fall on Friday normally. Once the fast is being moved, then we do not move it to Erev Shabbat, because of the conflict with Shabbat.

It really means a female warrior. Indeed, there have been numerous female soldiers in the past (Devorah, as you mentioned, was one of them), and the Israeli army, for one, has numerous female soldiers - some are sergeants. So, there's no problem finding female warriors.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is finding a female warrior that has all the characteristics that are described in the rest of that chapter. For example, there;s a verse that says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ידיה שלך בכישור וכפיה תמכו פלך</p>\n  \n  <p>(My loose translation:)</p>\n  \n  <p>She stretched her hands to the mill and her palms support the spindle</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This implies skill at sewing or knitting or weaving; perhaps grinding. The point is, that a warrier doesn't have time to be at home doing this type of domestic work if she is on the battlefield. This is why King Solomon wrote an entire chapter and started it with the question, \"Who can find such a woman?\"</p>\n\n<p>As to WHY King Solomon wrote about something that doesn't exist - well, perhaps, that's one of his many wisdoms that makes him wiser than the rest of us.

The bird that tried to eat them represents King David, who tried to destroy these nations. The bird was chased away because Hashem didn't allow King David to destroy them. The same applies to other tzadikim throughout the ages who detect a slight weakening in the strength of the non-Jewish nations. When they see this, they try to hasten the coming of Mashiach (symbolized by trying to \"eat the pieces\").   But they didn't succeed because the time for Redemption had not yet come; they were therefore \"chased away.\" The final success will come with the revelation of Melech HaMashiach.\"</p>\n\n<p>2) \"The bird refers not to King David, but to Mashiach himself. When Melech HaMashiach is revealed, he will \"fly down\" upon the nations of the world.   At that time, Avraham will come to make all the nations do teshuvah and serve Hashem. This is another explanation of the phrase, \"Avraham chased them away.\" The word vayasheiv can be translated \"chased away,\" but can also be translated, \"made them do teshuvah.\" According to this, the phrase is translated, \"And Avraham made them do teshuvah.\"   Therefore, when \"Mashiach flies down upon the nations,\" Avraham will make the nations do teshuvah. At that time the prophecy of Tzefaniah (3:9) will be fulfilled: \"Then all the nations will be transformed to speak clearly and all call out in the name of Hashem and serve Him together.\" \"</p>\n\n<p>It seems according to both understandings these birds were more symbolic of a future time. Therefore, after the maaseh avos siman l'banim was finished, there would be no need to have the birds return again.</p>\n\n\n",

It represents a person with neither wisdom nor good deeds.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <em>mitzvah</em> of Wacky Mac reminds us that Yisrael is made up of all of these types; we cannot concern ourselves only with the wheels or dismiss the spirals out of hand.  We need to bring them all together.  And thus, to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em>, you must have in your spoon an equal positive number of each.

Maybe that in certain acute situation, little quantities of time, he is Shote. Second. The answer, your only mitsva is to get better needs to be translated. The first of all step is to treat yourself in way to get a maximum of independence and mastery, a minimum of invalidating symptoms. After this step you can and you need to make all mitsvot. The man and the illness have to be considered as two entities. The condition for mitsvot is free will. one man who is in a very acute psychotic & / manic / depressive state loses his free will (see gemara Ketubbot 20a). Pharmacological, psychotherapeutic and rehabilitating treatments help to regain free will. So, in a state in which the amount of free will is low (See for instance Kiddushin 40a an exemple of loss of free will concerning particular things, according to some Rishonim), often, the only free will is to make all to get better, to make a great effort to get the better treatment. </p>\n\n\n",

Or does the limit set by the host nullify that bracha?</strong> </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question is about the rule described in the Kitsur SA, which is based on the Magen Avraham sk 4.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A little introduction is necessary to understand this rule</strong>: The Mordechai on the 9th chapter of Berachot (quoted in  Bet Yosef OC 175)  reports in name of the Rif,  that Achsanai and oreach cannot bless because this is not his own  goodness. The Bet Yosef didn't find those words in Rif and thinks that somewhat is wrong in this quote of the Rif.  So he skipped this opinion in Shulchan Aruch. The Bach says that this Rif is probably quoted from the Respona of the Rif. He understands that achsanay and oreach are equivalent,  two kinds of guests. </p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham in sk 4 gives a new interpretation of this rule.  He understood that the Rif's opinion comes from the psak of the Rif regarding the blessing of  Hatov VeHaMeitiv about rain. </p>\n\n<p>He explains that the words achsanai and oreach are certainly not equivalent,  achsanai is the owner,  the host,  and oreach is the guest. </p>\n\n<p>Even the host cannot bless hatov vehametiv because of a necessary condition (according to the Rif) which is not fulfilled. According to the Rif,  the owner of a field cannot bless hatov vehametiv for the rain, if he has no associate in this field,  despite the fact that the field provides food not for him only but for a lot of persons. </p>\n\n<p>Magen Avraham learns from this rule that for wine if there is a owner,  the  host and one or several guests,  the cannot bless ,  because this is not a common boon (but the words of the Mordechai are הטבה שלו, not exactly congruent to this interpretation), and the guest too is not associated when he received one cup. </p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham explains that if a jug is put on the table  as it is the general case,  and everybody can drink from his cup which was fulfilled from the jug (until he drink the wine is not his wine because we rule אין ברירה),  and they drink together,  every people around the table is associated for the jug and can bless hatov vehametiv. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In the case of the OP,  the guests can drink freely up to a certain state of drunkenness</strong>,  the control of the quantity can be interpreted as follows: the guest is  an associate with a low percentage, as long as  his part is not finished,  he is an associate. </p>\n\n\n",

The Zohar in Parashat Emor asserts that a\n  person with a physical deformity may not serve as a sheliach tzibur,\n  whereas the Maharshal, in Yam Shel Shelomo (Chulin, chapter 1), as\n  well as the Maharam Mi-Rutenberg, maintained that a ba’al mum may\n  serve in this role.  The letter two authorities note that a person\n  suffering from physical suffering is even a preferred candidate for\n  the role of sheliach tzibur, as “the Almighty’s way is to use ‘broken\n  utensils’.”  God has special affinity for people in distress, and will\n  thus look especially favorably upon the supplications of a person with\n  a physical ailment.</p>\n  \n  <p>The question arises, however, as to how these poskim would explain the Torah’s disqualification of ba’alei mum for the Temple\n  service.  If, indeed, the prayers of a “broken utensil” arouse special\n  mercy and compassion, then why does God specifically exclude ba’alei\n  mum from the Temple service?</p>\n  \n  <p>The answer, perhaps, lies in a deeper understanding of the role and status of the kohanim in the Beit Ha-mikdash.  The Rambam, in\n  his Mishneh Torah, combines the laws of the kohanim and the laws of\n  Temple furnishings into a single section, which he entitles, “Hilkhot\n  Kelei Ha-mikdash Ve’ha’ovdim Bo” – “Laws of the Temple Furnishings and\n  Those Who Serve In It.”  This title perhaps reflects that the kohanim\n  are viewed as “keilim” – part of the “furniture” of the Mikdash.  They\n  represent, in the extreme, the ideal of complete subservience to the\n  divine will, whereby the individual is nothing more than an object at\n  God’s disposal.  Outside the Mikdash, of course, our subservience to\n  God is manifest differently, but the Temple sets an extreme model that\n  we are to follow in more moderate fashion.  And thus the kohanim are\n  anointed with the special anointing oil just like the furnishings and\n  utensils in the Mikdash, and they are to be dressed in a\n  specifically-prescribed manner just as each article in the Mikdash\n  must be made in a particular way.  The kohanim function as kelei\n  ha-Mikdash – articles placed at God’s disposal, negating their own\n  interests and desires and subjecting themselves exclusively to the\n  Almighty’s will.</p>\n  \n  <p>For this reason, perhaps, a ba’al mum is disqualified for this role.  The Temple must be a place of pristine perfection, and just as a broken altar or shulchan is disqualified for use, a “broken”\n  kohen is likewise unfit for “use” in God’s earthly abode, as it were.\n  Prayer, however, is the precise opposite experience.  When we come before God to pray, we are specifically to approach Him in a\n  state of “brokenness.”  We are to come before Him keenly aware of our\n  helplessness, our limitations, our needs and wants, and our absolute\n  dependence on His grace.  In prayer, we must all see ourselves as\n  “broken utensils,” as God, in His infinite compassion, feel special\n  closeness to the despondent and brokenhearted.  If the Temple is a\n  place of perfection, the setting of prayer is one in which we\n  specifically focus on our countless imperfections.  And thus somebody\n  who suffers particular torment and hardship is especially suited to\n  lead the congregation.  He, more than anybody else, senses his urgent,\n  desperate dependence on God, and thus he is the most worthy to\n  represent his fellow Jews before the Almighty.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Based on a lecture by Rabbi Daniel Yolkut)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From a Halachic standpoint, the Mishneh Brura says in 53:13 that the disqualification of a blemish is something that applies specifically to a priest and not a chazan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין מומין פוסלין אלא בכהנים ולא בש\"ץ ואדרבה לב נשבר ונדכה אלקים לא תבזה ויש מחמירין בזה לכתחלה היכא דאיכא ראוי והגון כיוצא בו ועיין לקמן בס\"ק מ\"א לענין סומא מה שכתבנו שם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Obviously, they needed a lamp, because that was the only way to see at night in those days. Funny that it should say \"check\", not \"pack\"… and funny that it should specify that the <em>mishloach manos</em> is <em>chametz</em>… well, let's read further and see what it says.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל מקום שאין מכניסין בו חמץ אין צריך בדיקה</p>\n<p>You don't need to check containers in which you're not putting <em>chametz</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, so it really is specifically <em>chametz</em>.

We want to make sure we're packing the <em>mishloach manos</em> properly, so we need a lamp to make sure every food item is found. It is night, after all. So that explains why it says we <em>check</em>. Still not clear why it specifies <em>chametz</em>.

Should it be a dove? Since it's from a kosher bird. Or should it be an eagle? since it says:</p>\n<p>״ואשא אתכם על כנפי נשרים וגו׳״</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Birds come up an awful lot in the perakim of Shema. </p>\n\n<p>Tefillin, we know, are compared to doves. Elisha \"the man of wings\" compared them to doves' wings (Shabbos 130a). Sure, the Gemara says he picked them because Kneses Yisrael is also compared to doves. But why did he pick dove <em>wings</em> and not doves? Further, we are commanded not to lie (Vayikra 19:11). How could he have lied? He couldn't rely on a miracle either way, so he may as well have told the truth and hoped that HaShem would strike the guy with lightning. It must be that Tefillin are compared to doves' wings, and he was referring to his Tefillin poetically. Why, the Gemara asks, are they called doves' wings? Because they sit on the extremities of Jews like wings, and Jews are compared to doves. </p>\n\n<p>So perhaps by tzitzis, too, we should put them on doves' wings. </p>\n\n<p>Yet we find that the mitzvah of remembering Yetzias Mitzraim is also among the parshios of Shema. What does it say there? \"I carried you on the wings of eagles\" (Shemos 19:4). So just as that refers to eagles, so, too, by tzitzis. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we find the mitzvah of Talmud Torah in the parshios of Shema. Where was the Torah kept? The Aron. What was on top of the Aron? The Keruvim. The Keruvim had wings. So perhaps it means we should put tzitzis on the wings of the Keruvim!</p>\n\n<p>It even says כנף regarding fathers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יגלה כנף אביו</p>\n  \n  <p>(Devarim 23:1)</p>\n  \n  <p>כי גלה כנף אביו</p>\n  \n  <p>(Devarim 27:20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, there are the Chayos which have wings (Yechezkel 3:13).</p>\n\n<p>Now to narrow down the options. There is a Gezeirah Shavah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כנפי כנפי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We have the word by Tzitzis, and we find the passuk in Shemos says כנפי נשרים. Aha!</p>\n\n<p>No, wait. It says כנפי יונה in the Gemara in Shabbos, כנפי החיות in the passuk in Yechezkel, and כנפי הכרובים in Melachim Aleph 6:27. Nevertheless, the Gezeirah Shavah does cross out fathers. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe we should group it by parshah, and it's a proof that we are dealing with the wings of eagles. </p>\n\n<p>No, wait. Tzitzis is among a series of setumahs in Devarim 22 that begins with Shiluach HaKan. That would indicate that we are dealing with kosher birds, as only kosher birds are obligated to be sent away, which would indicate we're dealing with doves!</p>\n\n<p>We can resolve this with the passuk in Devarim which says that we tie it on <em>four</em> wings. Doves only have two wings. Eagles only have two wings. Keruvim have four wings, though, as there are two Keruvim banged out of a single piece of gold - thus, four wings on a single creature.</p>\n\n<p>Wait. The Chayos have four wings (Yechezkel 1:6).</p>\n\n<p>So in conclusion, one must tie their tzitzis on some form of angel. This would also parallel the fact that the tzitzis ultimately remind one of Shamayim. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>During the summer, in particular, you need to watch Jewish boys and men play basketball. The tzitzit are attached to their T-shirts and they are making jump shots and lay-ups like there's no tomorrow. (They wear these same type of T-shirts year round, but they are covered with heavier shirts or sweaters in the colder weather.)</p>\n\n<p>When I was in summer camp, I watched these same kids who used to be both in my elememtary school class as well as my camp bunk. In school, they couldn't score or make a lay-up at all (well, unless the got lucky.) These same kids scored big in the summer. So, what was the difference? Simple. The tzizit at the end of their T-shirts act like wings. Or, I should say, more specifically, when they run and jump, the T-shirts flap like wings. The tzitzit acts as an additional aerodynamic factor that makes them jump higher or run faster. This, in turn, helps them score better.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the focus of the tzitzit was for Jewish basketball players. As to why this issue is important, I'd need a small book to explain this to you.... </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As for Tefilin,  wings of dove as in Gemara Shabbat 49a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>GEMARA: Since doves’ wings were mentioned in the mishna, the Gemara cites a related story: Rabbi Yannai said: Donning phylacteries requires a clean body, like that of Elisha, Man of Wings. The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of the statement that donning phylacteries requires a clean body? Abaye said: It means that one may not break wind while donning them. Rava said: It means that one may not sleep in them. The Gemara asks: And why did they call Elisha Man of Wings? Because on one occasion the evil kingdom of Rome issued a decree against Israel that, as punishment, they would pierce the brain of anyone who dons phylacteries. Nevertheless, Elisha would don them and defiantly go out to the marketplace. One day, an official [kasdor] who was appointed to enforce the decree saw him; Elisha ran away from him, and the official ran after him. When the official reached him, Elisha removed the phylacteries from his head and held them in his hand. The officer asked him: What is that in your hand? Elisha said to him: It is merely a dove’s wings. A miracle was performed: He opened his hand, and, indeed, it was found to be a dove’s wings. Therefore, in commemoration of this miracle, they would call him Elisha, Man of Wings. The Gemara asks: And what is different about doves’ wings from those of other birds that led Elisha to say that he had doves’ wings in his hand? The Gemara answers: Because the congregation of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is stated: “You shall shine as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her pinions with yellow gold” (Psalms 68:14). Just as this dove, only its wings protect it and it has no other means of protection, so too the Jewish people, only mitzvot protect them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is important because you indicate that you aren't certain which Sanzer influence prevailed in your family. In this edition of the Divrei Yechezkel [HaChadash] (can't locate it online so here's a picture) there is a compendium of the DY's particular customs, occasionally highlighting differences within the Sanzer arena. Another great set is <a href=\"http://www.lehmanns.co.uk/hmdh-gnvzh-b-krkim-canz-gavnim-vcdiqim.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chemda Genuzah</a> on the Sanzer dynasty.

The publishers searched the globe for the earliest and most authoritative manuscripts and attempted to achieve the most reliable version of the text. They also compiled what is called the Mafteach, a cross-referencing index of any mention of the Rambam, or it’s “Nosei Keilim”, in thousands of ancient and contemporary seforim.</p>\n<p>Another alternative element of the printing of this set is the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170302022853/https://shabsifrankel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/mishne.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">unusual breakdown</a> of the volumes. The Mishneh Torah is comprised of fourteen books, and the Frankel Rambam reproduces it as such. However, instead of numbering the books 1-14 (or א through יד, in this case), they refer to Madda as א* and Ahava as א**. Then they continue a standard numbering sequence through ו, at which point we find Avoda as ז* followed by Korbanot as ז**. Thus, although there are fourteen volumes in the set, the numbering only reaches 12, יב. We are led to believe that Madda-Ahava and Avoda-Korbanot are somehow unified sections. (see the picture in the link above)</p>\n<p>Why is the Frankel Rambam divided the way it is? Why did the publishers choose to number the volumes in this counter-intuitive fashion? Is there any grounds to suggest some innate connection between those volumes - and if so, why was it never done before?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pjz1k.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pjz1k.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>I wrote to Hotzaat Shabsi Frankel with this inquiry, and they responded that the unusual numbering is due to a misguided guess at how many volumes the set would ultimately be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thanks for your inquiry. Yes, it is because of the order in which it was published, and the expectations of how many volumes we would end up with. At the end there were more volumes then originally expected. We will in the future correct this issue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So since they didn't publish the Mishneh Torah in order but rather jumped around, the miscalculated how much space each Sefer would take up, and so they had to adapt as things developed. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>When they originally planned out the numbering, they expected to only need one volume each for those works, and they therefore numbered accordingly.  Subsequently, the works improved dramatically in quality and research (as more <em>talmidei chachamim</em> became involved), resulting, e.g. in longer <em>maftechoth</em> in the backs of the later volumes.  This resulted in the need for separate devoted volumes and an unusual numbering system.</p>\n\n\n",

The context in which he brings it up is the case of a person who does not have any coins. Despite recommending that that person use whatever form of currency they do have available (such as a bank note), anonymous mention is made of an opinion who insists on using a half denomination coin.</p>\n<p>In defense of the position that the <em>mitzva</em> can be fulfilled without a half denomination, Rav Tzinner quotes <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9A\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Vayish'al Sha'ul</em></a> with the following, apparently proactive, rationale:</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46446&st=&pgnum=180\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נטעי גבריאל פורים פרק כו קטע ו הערה יב</a></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובזמנינו שנתחדשו המטבעות ואין לנו בכ״מ מטבע ששם מחצית עליה, שמעתי אומרים דכוונת הרמ״א ליתן המטבע היותר קטנה שבמדינה . . .</p>\n<p>And in our times, as currency has modernized, and not every place has a coin called \"half\", I've heard they say that the Ram\"a's intent was to give the country's smallest coin. . .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That author then rejects this interpretation of the Ram\"a, based in part on earlier sources, and in part on the Ram\"a's own words in <em>Darkei Moshe</em>. The conclusion is that using a half denomination really is crucial to the non-<em>mikdash</em>-time <em>mitzva</em> because it is meant to be a commemoration and the mnemonic is the very fact of it being called a \"half\" just like the \"half <em>shekel</em>\".</p>\n<p>BUT THEN, he picks back up on an idea that had been raised by the Ram\"a in <em>Darkei Moshe</em> of people who used the larger of two possible half denomination coins because its weight was closer to the equivalent weight of 10 <em>gera</em> that appears in the Torah. He extracts the latter from that line of reasoning to propose that if one had no half denomination the Ram\"a would prefer them to still accomplish the mnemonic by some other means such as approximating the weight of 10 <em>gera</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Usually, it's a nickname for salt.</p>\n\n<p>\"Herb Av Bet Din\" has an interesting nuance. It means the herb belonging to the father of the law family (In Hebrew, \"Bet\" can mean \"family\".) This was obviously a family of lawyers, and everyone in the family was extremely smart. But the father was a tremendous sage who was the smartest of all of them. Hence, he named an herb after himself. The herb is currently known as \"sage\" (what else?) or in Hebrew, \"Herb Av Bet Din\".</p>\n\n<p>\"Herb Hamagid\" refers to the herb that tells a story, or rather, the herb that people speak about. That could be almost any herb, and it's a general reference. It begins with someone tasting the food that you cooked by adding a \"secret\" herb. For example, I added tarragon to my home-made tomato sauce (You should try it; it's outrageous!) People who tried my tomato sauce raved on it and asked, \"What is that herb that makes your sauce so delicious?\" I told them. They started adding it to their sauce, and they're friends and family loved it. Before I know it, everyone in my neighborhood is talking about it. That's your \"Herb Hamaggid\".</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>There is a series of books written about him by Rabbi Hershel Schachter, beginning with נפש הרב (\"The Soul of Herb\"), followed by מפניני הרב (\"Pearls of Herb\"), and finally, <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/oupress/product/divrei-harav/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">דברי הרב</a> (\"Herb's Words\").

This is a type of baked item which is like bread in many ways and different from bread in some other ways. According to the <em>Shulchan Arukh</em> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.168.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">168:7</a>), there are three different definitions of <em>pat haba bikisnin</em> and we hold by all three of them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h1>First Category: Cake</h1>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>According to Ashkenazim, if there’s a majority (51%) of sweeteners such as fruit juice, oil, egg, margarine, sugar, honey, or the like in comparison to the amount of water added to the flour, then the Bracha is mezonot. However, water mixed into the sweeteners such as diluted fruited juice or margarine (usually 15% water) isn’t included in the calculations of sweeteners to water.</li>\n  <li>According to Sephardim, if the taste of the sweeteners is recognizable in the dough, then the Bracha is mezonot.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h1>Second Category: Wafer</h1>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>Dough which is filled with sweeteners such as nuts, chocolate, or the like and is cooked together with the dough, and the taste is recognizable, the bracha is Mezonot.</li>\n  <li>To be considered pat habaa bikisnin, the filling must not be a “meal” food, for example meat, fish, cheese, or vegetables (unless the pastry is clearly made to be eaten as a snack).</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h1>Third Category: Cracker</h1>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>If the dough is cooked into a food that's hard and crumbles the bracha is Mezonot.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p><sub>Source: <a href=\"http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Pat_Haba_Bikisnin#What_is_Pas_Haba_Bikisnin.3F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia</a></sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>bracha</em> on <em>pas haba bikisnin</em> is <em>mezonot</em> when you eat it as a snack or <em>hamotzi</em> when you eat it as a meal. The definition of what constitutes a meal differs between <em>Ashkenazim</em> and <em>Sephardim</em>. So there are a few of incorrect assumptions in your question.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A pretzel may or may not be mezonot depending on how it's prepared. A hard pretzel fits into category 3 and would be <em>pat haba bikisnin</em> and would therefore take the <em>bracha</em> of <em>mezonot</em> when eaten as a snack; however, a soft pretzel is considered bread on which the <em>bracha</em> is <em>hamotzi</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Whether pizza is <em>pat haba bikisnin</em> is debated. I don't know the specifics of the debate but I think it comes down to whether it's bread with other stuff on top or whether the whole thing is considered together and so it's not really bread. Even for those who hold that it is <em>pas haba bikisnin</em> (as opposed to regular bread) (which I believe is a minority), whether it's considered a meal or not isn't really determined by the number of slices you eat (as one enormous slice could easily be a meal even though it's only one slice). The two-slice rule is a rule of thumb.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Mordechai lead his troops in attack from the east, while Haman attacked from the west.</p>\n\n<p>Haman squandered his provisions, and at the end of the first year he had already ran out of supplies. He appealed to Mordechai for help. Mordechai agreed, but on one condition: Haman would have to serve as his slave one day a week. Without any other choice, Haman was forced to agree.

According to this Midrash, Mordechai could rightly have told people that Haman’s seething hatred of the Jews was ridiculous, as fate would have it that he too was a Jew.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I do wish he would have mentioned who these \"Some Meforshim\" are.

    "content": "# Does the messiah have no share in God?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The סידור תהלת ה׳ is widely used by Chabad-Lubavitch people and synagogues everywhere. It is, if anything is, the official prayer book of Chabad-Lubavitch. Here's what it has to say (immediately after the weekday morning שמונה עשרה):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל המשיח בבהכ״נ בשעה שהצבור עסוקין בשבחו של מקום מראה בעצמו שאין לו חלק באלקי ישראל</p>\n<p>Any messiah in the synagogue, while the community is busy praising the place, shows about himself that he has no share in the God of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't fully understand this passage, but I'm worried. Because every Chabad-Lubavitch synagogue I've been to has a messiah in the synagogue. A big portrait, usually right near the entrance, usually that pose with his hand up.</p>\n<p>So, like I said, I don't really understand the passage — what does praising the synagogue have to do with anything? But it <em>sounds like</em> it's saying the messiah shows that he has no share in God, which I find hard to swallow. Or maybe the guy who put up the picture has no share in God? Can someone please clarify this passage? This has been bothering me quite a bit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

If you want really study the topic, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=55543&st=&pgnum=27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the first shmaata of the Shev Shmaateta</a> adresses it.

This question may be an introduction to a great topic. To treat it is not easy and great Acharonim wrote great books for this. I will give some elements, and finally, in a footnote, the most important element of answer explained.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Any doubtful case of Tumah would be a Safek DeOraisa LeChumra, wherever it is.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Safek deorayta lechumra is not necessarily a din deorayta.It is true, though, that in Gemara Chulin \" Rava said, prohibition's doubt is a case of stringency\".</li>\n<li>But the Gemara says that contrarily regarding doubt about danger. The doubt regarding prohibition and uncleanness may be treated by leniency according to a chezkat heiter **Sota has a chezkat Tahara, let's say that safek deorayta lechumra, it is not the rule in case of chezkat heyter (¹).</li>\n<li><strong>Following this, the rule of sota in public domain is a standard rule of chezkat heyter, nothing is learned from the Parasha.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(¹): Here we have to explain an important detail. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=28b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The first Tosfot in Sota 28b</a> reports that In several places in talmud the Gemara says that two halachot are learned from sota, </p>\n\n<p>. the first is that doubt about uncleanness in private domain is unclean, </p>\n\n<p>. the second is that doubt about uncleanness in public domain is clean (Sota 28b, Chulin 9a, Nidda 3a for Rabbi Shim'on).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding this second rule, Tosfot asks: Why need we an halacha lemoshe misinai, there is a reason to be lenient without h.l.m., the chezkat tahara of the sota.</p>\n\n<p>Further Tosfot makes this question stronger: In Gemara Nidda 3a, we see that Rabbanan state that it is not possible to learn a leniency in reshut harabim when there is chezkat tum'a. In other words, the leniency of sota in public domain results perhaps from her chezkat tahara only. That's as if no special halacha is learned from sota in public domain. </p>\n\n<p>So why the Gemara says that in public domain there is a special teaching for sota. </p>\n\n<p>Tosfot answers that the leniency in public domain is needed in a second step of the learning. After the novelty of doubt about uncleanness in private domain is unclean, we need to be sure that in private domain only the chezkat tahara is not effective, but in private domain the chazaka makes the din lenient.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>איצטריך הלכתא להעמיד ספק טומאה ברשות הרבים אחזקתה דלא מחתינן ליה טומאה מספק</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--> So in such cases, there is no old safek deorayta lechumra.</strong></p>\n\n<p>However, according to Rabbi Shim'on, the chezkat heyter of the sota is weakened even in public domain and we need a source to allow without chazaka. Rabbi Shim'on thinks that safek without chazaka is allowed and learns this from Sota.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<h3>This answer is build from  <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=17&daf=57&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Tosfot in Nazir 57a</strong></a> (see also the  <strong>Tosfot in Chulin 9b</strong> and  <strong>Tosfot Nidda 2a</strong>).</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>But now the Gemara learns a leniency - As a Sotah happens only in a private domain, so too does this rule apply only in a private domains.\n  Why? Let's say there's no extra stringency of Sotah.

You will see below that no particular leniency is learned from sota according to Rabanan and that safek deorayta lechumra is not said when there is Chezkat tahara.</em>\n Here is a stuff from this Tosfot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באומר ראיתי שנזרקה טומאה ביניכם. והוא עומד מרחוק דהוי ספק טומאה ברשות היחיד ואם תאמר אם כן יביא כל אחד קרבן טומאה ודאי דכל ספק טומאה   <strong>ברשות היחיד שורפין עליה  [תרומה]</strong>  ויש לומר <em>דלא גמירי מסוטה אלא דבר שאפשר להיות</em> כסוטה דאפשר שנטמאת אבל הכא לא אפשר לטמאות שניהם דודאי אחד טהור </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of two nezirim became unclean,  they were alone, in a private domain. Despite that the din of doubt about uncleanness in a private domain should apply for each of them,  since we know that only one of them is unclean,  and we learn from Sota only a possible interpretation of the doubt,  each Nazir is safek unclean and cannot make offer a Korban Tum'a. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם תאמר אם כן מאי פריך מעיקרא והא ספק טומאה ברשות הרבים הוא כלומר ויביאו שניהם קרבן טהרה והא ספק טומאה ברשות הרבים דמטהרינן נמי מסוטה גמרינן לה ולא ילפינן אלא דבר שאפשר להיות והכא בודאי אחד טמא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If it's clear for the Gemara that we learn from Sota with a restriction,  so in public domain too,  they cannot be regarded as both clean,  because we know that one of them is unclean.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש לומר   <strong>דספק טומאה ברשות הרבים לאו מסוטה גמרינן ליה</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosfot explains that the novelty learned from  Sota is the din of safek tum'a in private domain, not the din in public domain. {this is congruent with the opinion of Rabanan in Nidda 3a,    following which the chiddush of Sota is the Vaday tame   in case of safek. In reshut harabim, case sota shenistera is not a safek} </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא כל חד וחד מוקמינן אחזקתיה וילפינן ליה מקרא פרק קמא דחולין (דף י:) להעמיד כל דבר אחזקתיה**  אף על גב דודאי אחד טמא כיון דלא ידעינן ליה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In public domain, the safek nezirim treatment doe's not result from Parshat Sota, each of both nezirim benefits from his  <strong>chezkat tahara</strong>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואף על גב דבפרק קמא דחולין (דף ט' עמוד ב') למאי דקא סלקא דעתיה קאמר התם הילכתא גמירי לה <strong>ומשמע התם דספק טומאה ברשות הרבים לאו משום חזקה אלא נגמר מסוטה</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a Gemara in Chulin 9b which states that safek tum'a birshut harabim tahor when we have chezkst tahara is learned from Sota.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>במסקנא לא קאי הכי</strong>   ובמקום אחר [בריש מסכת נדה.] מפורש באורך:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Gemara in Chulin doesn't follow the conclusion of suggia for the opinion of Rabanan.  But for Rabbi Shim'on, this is the final rule, to learn from sota in public domain for a safek without chezkat tahara, because Rabbi Shim'on regards the chezkat tahara of the sota as cancelled.</p>\n\n<p>The point that addresses your question is that Safek Tum'a in private domain is the  \"natural case of safek\",  which can be influenced by the  <strong>Chezkat  tahara</strong>. (this din doesn't result from halachot Sota according to rabanan). </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Gemara does not learn any leniency from Sota in reshut harabbim. The leniency is generated by the Chezkat tahara.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>In masechet nidda at the first two dapim,  there is a discussion between Rabbi Shim'on and Rabanan regarding the learning from Sota. Sota has objectively two features.  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is a great reason to be suspicious because she did wish to be with this man against the prohibition of her husband {raglayim laddavar} so this is a little worst than a simple case of doubt. </li>\n<li>A second feature is that in the presence of someone else man and woman would probably not do nothing {this gives a special reason to see the safek sota in public domain with a special leniency}. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>One of the two features would restrict the comparison between Sota and  different cases of doubt. For Rabanan the leniency of Sota in public domain is not comparable to other doubts, and is not a source of learning. In the footnote of my second answer, you can see that this principle for rabanan is less clearly explained in other sugiot out of masechet nidda, but the Talmud is congruent with itself and the public domain for sota is a paradigm of safek + chezkat tahara.</p>\n\n\n",

When it says: “And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning” (v. 10), behold then it forbids having “left-overs” of the paschal sacrifice.

You could, of course, just ask the king after he arises, but while he could tell you how he prefers it to be <em>pronounced</em>, we have no evidence that the king was able to spell.  You could then ask one of his scribes the same question, but their response would probably be in cuniform, giving you yet another option to break your head over.

So, it seems that sound exists only in the presence of a human or animal ear.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, I have to ask a related question.

Could it be that they would have bowed in spite of the rule that even death is no excuse?! It must be that it was technically permissible to bow, and they wanted to be mekadeish HaShem.</li>\n<li>\"What did they see that they threw themselves into the fire?\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.53b.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 53b</a>).

It must be that they were not violating any issurim by bowing.</li>\n<li>They were sentenced to misah for bowing to Nevuchadnetzar's statue. Why, then, did HaShem not strike them down immediately? Because they didn't <em>really</em> serve it; they were just pretending. So, too, HaShem didn't <em>really</em> sentence them to death, but rather wanted them to do teshuvah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.12a.10?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 12a with Rashi</a>). If it were really Avodah Zarah, they would not have been able to serve it even for pretend!</li>\n<li>The passuk (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Daniel.3.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 3:18</a>), which says they would not bow to \"his god\" or \"his statue,\" implies that they are two separate things.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I would like to emphasize the word used for a statue - אנדרטי.</p>\n<p>Now, take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Esther.3.4?lang=bi&with=Aramaic%20Targum%20to%20Esther&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum to Esther 3:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>די להמן לא הוה סגיד על דהוה עבדיה דאזדבן ליה בטולמת לחם <strong>ולאנדרטא</strong> די הקים בחדייה לא הוה גחין על דהוה יהודי <strong>ויהודאי לא פלחין ולא גחנין ליה</strong>.</p>\n<p>To Haman he did not bow because [Haman] was [Mordechai's] slave that he bought for a piece of bread, <strong>and to the statue</strong> that he hung around his neck he would not bow because he was Jewish, <strong>and Jews do not serve nor bow to it</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Excuse me? Did Tosfos not just prove conclusively that it's technically mutar to bow to statues, since they're not idolatrous and therefore not under \"die not do\"?</p>\n<p>Now, it occurred to me recently that Tosfos are of the opinion that one is allowed to give up his life even when not required to do so. On <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosafot_on_Avodah_Zarah.27b.11.1?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 27b DH Yachol</a>, they write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם רצה להחמיר על עצמו אפי' בשאר מצות רשאי</p>\n<p>If one wants to be stringent on himself, even by other Mitzvos it is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if he was allowed to bow, why would he refuse, thereby endangering the entire Jewish people? If the Targum argues on this premise of Tosfos' and instead holds like Rambam's opinion that one may <em>not</em> give up his life where permissible (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.5.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yesodei HaTorah 5:4</a>), the original question returns much stronger: not only is bowing <em>permissible</em>, it's <em>obligatory</em>!</p>\n<p>Now, I don't know who the Targum is, and it may be that he is able to argue on Tosfos and indeed holds that bowing to a statue is idolatry. In that case, how does he explain the various proofs that Tosfos bring?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The text of the relevant Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.3a.9?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 3b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר להם הקב\"ה מכם יבאו ויעידו בהן בישראל שקיימו את התורה כולה יבא\n  נמרוד ויעיד באברהם שלא עבד עבודת כוכבים יבא לבן ויעיד ביעקב שלא נחשד\n  על הגזל תבא אשת פוטיפרע ותעיד ביוסף שלא נחשד על העבירה</p>\n  \n  <p>Instead, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says to the nations: Let the\n  witnesses come from among you and testify that the Jewish people\n  <strong>fulfilled the Torah in its entirety</strong>. Let Nimrod come and testify about\n  Abraham that he did not engage in idol worship. Let Laban come and\n  testify about Jacob that he is not suspect with regard to robbery (see\n  Genesis 31:36–42). Let the wife of Potiphar come and testify about\n  Joseph that he is not suspect with regard to the sin of adultery (see\n  Genesis 39:7–12).</p>\n  \n  <p>יבא נבוכד נצר ויעיד בחנניה מישאל ועזריה שלא השתחוו לצלם יבא דריוש\n  ויעיד בדניאל שלא ביטל את התפלה יבא בלדד השוחי וצופר הנעמתי ואליפז\n  התימני ואליהו בן ברכאל הבוזי ויעידו בהם בישראל שקיימו את כל התורה כולה\n  שנאמר (ישעיהו מג, ט) יתנו עידיהם ויצדקו</p>\n  \n  <p>Let Nebuchadnezzar come and testify about Hananiah, Mishael, and\n  Azariah that they did not prostrate themselves before a graven image</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's basically saying that Hashem is saying that the nations of the world themselves can testify that the Jewish people kept the entire Torah. It's not at all implying that its premitted to bow down to a graven image; in fact, the very fact that Hashem is saying how \"Let Nebuchadnezzar come and testify about Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah that they did not prostrate themselves before a graven image\", seems to prove that it is <em>indeed</em> prohibited to bow down to it according to the Torah. Now, what exactly is the scope of the prohibition? Comes along Tosafos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא השתחוו לצלם - אומר ר\"ת דצלם דנבוכדנצר לאו עבודת כוכבים הוא אלא\n  אנדרטי עשוי לכבוד המלך ובהכי ניחא דנקט גבי אברהם שלא עבד עבודת כוכבים\n  ובחנניה מישאל ועזריה שלא השתחוו לצלם וניחא נמי הא דאמרינן בפרק אלו\n  נערות (כתובות דף לג:) אלמלי נגדו לחנניה מישאל ועזריה פלחו לצלמא ואילו\n  היה עבודת כוכבים ממש חס ושלום כי מדאגת שום יסורין שבעולם לא היו\n  משתחוים לצלם כר' חנינא בן תרדיון (לקמן עבודה זרה יח.) ששמו ספוגין על\n  לבו ליסרו ור\"ע (ברכות סא:) שסרקו בשרו במסרקות פיות והיינו הא דפריך פרק\n  מקום שנהגו (פסחים דף נג:) מה ראו חנניה מישאל ועזריה שמסרו עצמן לתוך\n  כבשן האש <strong>פירוש היה להם להשתחוות לצלם</strong> כיון שלא היה עבודת כוכבים ממש\n  ועוד ראיה מפ\"ק דמגילה (דף יב.) מפני מה נתחייבו שונאיהם של ישראל כלייה\n  מפני שהשתחוו לצלם וכו' הם לא עשו אלא לפנים ואם היתה עבודת כוכבים היה\n  להם למסור עצמן על קידוש השם ולישנא דקרא נמי משמע הכי דכתיב לאלהיך לית\n  אנן פלחין ולצלמך לית אנן סגדין משמע דתרי מילי הוו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So indeed Tosafos does say that there are two things, but he doesn't say that it's permitted to bow down to a statue, just that it's not \"literally\" avodas kochavim. Even though Tosafos says that \"thye could have bowed to the statue since it wasn't literal Avodas Kochavim\", but they had a reason not to, and it was still forbidden, like the Gemara that Tosafos himself brings before that proof (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther_Rabbah.7.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 53b</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תא שמע עוד זו דרש תודוס איש רומי מה ראו חנניה מישאל ועזריה שמסרו\n  [עצמן] על קדושת השם לכבשן האש</p>\n  \n  <p>Come and hear: This was also taught by Theodosius of Rome: What did\n  Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah see that led them to deliver themselves\n  to the fiery furnace for sanctification of the name of God during the\n  rule of Nebuchadnezzar rather than worship idols under duress?</p>\n  \n  <p>נשאו קל וחומר בעצמן מצפרדעים ומה צפרדעים שאין מצווין על קדושת השם כתיב\n  בהו ובאו [ועלו] בביתך [וגו׳] ובתנוריך ובמשארותיך אימתי משארות מצויות\n  אצל תנור הוי אומר בשעה שהתנור חם אנו שמצווין על קדושת השם על אחת כמה\n  וכמה</p>\n  \n  <p>They drew an a fortiori inference on their own from the plague of\n  frogs in Egypt. With regard to frogs, which are not commanded\n  concerning the sanctification of the name of God, it is written: “And\n  the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your\n  house, and into your bedchamber, and onto your bed, and into the\n  houses of your servants, and upon your people, and into their ovens\n  and kneading bowls” (Exodus 7:28). When are kneading bowls found near\n  the oven? You must say that it is when the oven is hot. If in\n  fulfilling the command to harass the Egyptians, the frogs entered\n  burning ovens, all the more so, <strong>we, who are commanded concerning the\n  sanctification of the name of God, should deliver ourselves to be\n  killed in the fiery furnace for that purpose.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So true that even according to Rashi, the simple meaning, the statue wasn't an \"Avodas Kochavim\" mamash, let's look at Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה ראו - <strong>שלא דרשו</strong> וחי בהן ולא שימות בהן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So seemingly, it's not automatically included in the prohibited to give one's life over, as Tosafos there says, and goes according to his opinion in Avodah Zarah, he says in Pesachim (and he seems to say here that it's barely even a tecnical Mitvah Kalah, which one would be obligated to give ones life over <strong>in public</strong>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה ראו חנניה מישאל ועזריה - פ\"ה מה ראו שלא דרשו וחי בהם ולא שימות בהן\n  וקשה דהא <strong>בפרהסיא הוה</strong> ומסקינן בסנהדרין (דף עד.) <strong>דלכולי עלמא בפרהסיא\n  חייב למסור עצמו אפילו אמצוה קלה</strong> ומפר\"ת דצלם זה שעשה נבוכדנצר לאו ע\"ז\n  הוה אלא אינדרטא שעשה לכבוד עצמו ולכך קאמר מה ראו וכן משמע מדכתיב לאלהך\n  לית אנחנא פלחין ולצלם דדהבא לא נסגוד משמע דאלהא דידיה וצלמא תרי מילי\n  נינהו ואתי נמי שפיר הא דאמרינן באלו נערות (כתובות לג:) אלמלי נגדו\n  לחנניה מישאל ועזריה פלחו לצלמא ואי ע\"ז הוה ח\"ו שהיו משתחוים לו ומיהו\n  לשון פלחו לא אתי שפיר ור\"י מפרש מה ראו שלא ברחו שהרי קודם המעשה היו\n  יכולים לברוח כמו שעשה דניאל כדאמר בחלק ( סנהדרין צג.) ג' היו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but still the Gemara in Pesachim clearly says that even though we might not be tecnically commanded to not bow down to a \"Tzelem\" (which is why the Gemara asks the question of why did they do it), but we still have the kal vachomer from the frogs that nevertheless we still <strong>should</strong> give our lives for the sake of Hashem, so for sure in Mordechai's case, he had every right to not bow. It's not that they \"should have bowed\" since they were permitted to, Chas Veshalom; that's not what Tosafos is saying, he's simply answering a question: why does <strong>the Gemara</strong> ask why they should have done it, with which the Gemara itself answered, and especially according to the last opinion mentioned in the Tosafos in Pesachim...</p>\n\n<p>But anyway, all of that was only regarding the incident of Nevuchadetzar, where Tosafos clearly says that it \"only a statue made for the kings honor\"; however, regarding Haman's idol, it seems that it was an Avodah Zarah according to all opinions, even though the Targum calls it a \"אַנְדְרָטָא\" (see later), and even besides the fact that <em>maybe</em> it could be debatable what the status of the statue of Haman was, it seems that Haman himself was considered an Avodah Zarah, it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther_Rabbah.7.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ester Rabbah 7:8</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מָה אָמַר לָהֶם מָרְדֳּכַי לְמִי שֶׁאוֹמֵר לוֹ: מַדּוּעַ אַתָּה עוֹבֵר\n  אֵת מִצְוַת הַמֶּלֶךְ, רַבִּי לֵוִי אָמַר, אָמַר לָהֶם מָרְדֳּכַי,\n  משֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ הִזְהִיר לָנוּ בַּתּוֹרָה (דברים כז, טו): אָרוּר\n  הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה פֶסֶל וּמַסֵּכָה, וְרָשָׁע זֶה עוֹשֶׂה עַצְמוֹ\n  עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So according to this Haman made <em>himself</em> a literal \"Avodas Kochavim\" in addition to the statue around his neck, let's just quote the relevant Tosafos from Pesachim again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דצלם זה שעשה נבוכדנצר לאו ע\"ז\n  הוה אלא אינדרטא שעשה לכבוד עצמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, let's look at the words of the Targum on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3.4?lang=bi&with=Aramaic%20Targum%20to%20Esther&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ester 3:4</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַהֲוָה בְּמַלָלוּתְהוֹן לְוָתֵיהּ יוֹמָא וְיוֹמָא וְלָא קַבֵּל\n  מִנְהוֹן וְחַוִיאוּ לְהָמָן לְמֶחֱזֵי הֲיִתְקַיְמוּן פִּתְגָמֵי\n  מָרְדְכַי כָּל קֳבֵיל פִּתְגָמֵי דְהָמָן אֲרוּם חֲוֵי לְהוֹן דִי\n  לְהָמָן לָא הֲוָה סְגִיד עַל דַהֲוָה עַבְדֵיהּ דְאִזְדַבֵּן לֵיהּ\n  בְּטוּלְמַת לְחֵם וּלְאַנְדְרָטָא דִי הֵקִים בַּהֲדֵיהּ לָא הֲוָה\n  גָחִין עַל דַהֲוָה יְהוּדִי וִיהוּדָאֵי לָא פַּלְחִין וְלָא גָחַנִין\n  לֵיהּ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He says that people told Haman that Morechai wouldn't bow to him because 1) Haman sold himself as a slave to Mordechai, and 2) because of the \"אַנְדְרָטָא\" that he had by him, and he wouldn't bow because \"He's a Yehudi and Yehudim don't serve and don't bow to \"it\" (seemingly referring to the tzelem)\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, what exactly does \"אַנְדְרָטָא\" mean? Tosafos says that the \"Tzelem\" of Nevuchadnetzar was (only) <strong>a type of אַנְדְרָטָא that he made for his own honor</strong>, seemingly אַנְדְרָטָא just means \"statue\", I don't see any indication that the word אַנְדְרָטָא on its own implies something that's not Avodah arah; many Avodah Zarah's are statues. In fact, in the Jastrow dictionary, this word (in a different form) is simply translated as \"statue\":</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hHVen.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hHVen.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Tosafos is just saying that Nevuchadnetzar's \"image\" wasn't an Avodah Zarah, it was just a \"statue\" that he made <strong>for his own honor</strong>, the stress isn't on the word \"statue\"; rather, on the point that it was only for his own honor, and it happened to be a statue, but that doesn't imply or mean that the word \"statue\" always excludes Avodah Zarah, especially since Haman would worship this \"statue\" as a literal Avodah Zarah according to the Midrash (see the end), and it seems pretty unlikely that the Targum would be arguing with this point of the Midrash... But basically, \"statue\" doesn't imply not Avodah Zarah, many Avodah Zarah's are, in fact, statues; the Avodah Zarah just means something that is worshipped as a \"god\", see Rambam hilchos Avodah Zarah (from the Gemara) where he says that even if people bow down to animals, plants or rocks (in some cases), they become Avodah Zarah with regard to certain laws.  </p>\n\n<p>So even if one might say that for some reason the word \"אַנְדְרָטָא\" <em>does</em> exclude Avodah Zarah, but certainly at least Haman himself was considered an Avodah Zarah since he made many people bow for him, and apparently consider him a god, like the Midrash Rabbah said above (that Mordechai told them the \"he's making himself an Avodas Kochavim\")...</p>\n\n<p>And that itself is also another reason why the אַנְדְרָטָא of Haman should be considered an Avodah Zarah, not simply because it was a statue and all statues are not necessarily Avodah Zarah, but Haman wanted people to bow to <strong>the idol that he worshipped</strong>, and that itself gave it the status of Avodah Zarah, not the fact that it's a statue, but the fact that [he wanted that] people would worship it as a god (as the Targum himself says, that \"...Yehudim <strong>don't worship it</strong>\", implying that Haman wanted people to actually worship the \"statue\" as a god. In fact, let's look at the end of the Targum again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וִיהוּדָאֵי לָא פַּלְחִין וְלָא גָחַנִין\n   לֵיהּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"And Yehudim 1) <strong>don't worship</strong> and 2) <strong>don't bow down</strong> to it\", it seems clear that according to the Targum, there are in fact 2 different things going on here, bowing down <strong><em>and</em></strong> worshipping it.).</p>\n\n<p>so according to all opinions Mordechai was forbidden to bow to the Avodah Zarah \"statue\" that Haman (who was also an Avodah Zarah) had with him. And not only was this considered bonafide idol worship which anyone should rather be killed than transgress, and the Tosafos himself says that even if they would have tortured Chananyal Mishayel and Zecharya to worship a literal Avodah Zarah, they would have taken all the pain in the world; not only that, but it was <strong>in public</strong>, which Tosafos said in Pesachim that even a \"Mitzvah Kalah\", one is obligated to give ones life and not transgress.</p>\n\n<p>Besides that, not only was he prohibited to bow down to it for his own sake, but even for the sake of the rest of the Jewish people [although I'm pretty sure that even for the sake of other people one is forbidden to transgress one of the 3 Mitzvos, and even a Mitvah Kalah in public, but perhaps there could have been a \"Horas Sha'h\", although I'm not so sure about that since I don't know if Mordechai had the authority to do so, but maybe it could be argued that for the sake of the entire Jewish people, it <em>might</em> be different (although I dont think there's any basis for that), but still:), he had good reason to like it says in Me'am Lo'az (I have one here right now) page 82 (at the end of verse 3:6) it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Mordechai had an important reason for stubbornly refusing to bow,\n  even if it meant endangering the entire Jewish people. He knew that\n  the Jews had committed a terrible sin by bowing to Nebuchadnezzar's\n  statue. By his personal sacrifice, Mordechai was attempting to expiate\n  this sin\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>SO maybe he though that through saving their sin, they would automatically be saved and there was nothing to worry about, since once they're forgiven (through his self sacrifice), then nothing could harm them.</p>\n\n<p>Another point from me-am loa'z page 78, which shows how the \"statue\" Haman had was <strong>indeed an actual idol that he worshipped</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Haman held <strong>the idol</strong> that <strong>he worshipped</strong> in his bosom as he\n  paraded through the town. He trusted in this idol, feeling that it\n  had helped him overcome Vashti and gain his present high position. He\n  held a representation of this idol, so that when people prostrated\n  themselves to him, they would also be kneeling to the idol [Yad HaMelech].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hebrew name of a convert with a Jewish father?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I technically was not born Jewish as my mother didn't convert until I was about ten. At that time I also underwent a ritual conversion. However, I've always assumed my Hebrew name should end in Ben Michael (my father's Hebrew name), and it says on my bris certificate Reuven Ben Michael. Also, this is the name I have used since Bar Mitzvah when being called up. </p>\n\n<p>I've just realized when thinking about it, that I'm unsure whether I ought to have been calling myself Reuven ben Avraham Avinu all along.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This question it is similar to the case of a person who is adopted by a Jewish family and can call himself after the name of his adoptive father. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36869/when-an-adopted-child-is-called-to-the-torah-how-are-they-named/36871#36871\">When an adopted child is called to the torah, how are they named?</a> has my answer to that question It might not be an exact duplicate because of the specific case given. In that answer, I state that I have known people who are known by the name of the adoptive father.</p>\n\n<p>Given the general case, we can see from the other answers to this topic, that the Jewish father and the nonJewish son have <strong>no</strong> halachic connection whatsoever. The answer as far as aperson who converts to Judaism and is adopted by a Jew is the same no matter who the adoptive father may be. In any case, as explained in the other answers, a person can take the name of his adoptive father.</p>\n\n<p>The only difference that would occur, is that if the adoptive father is a Levi (as an example from an actual case) then he is <strong>not</strong> called with the term \"Levi\" in the name because he is a yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>As an example if the adopted son is named Moshe and his adoptive father is Shmuel HaLevi (made up names) the he would be called to the Torah as Moshe ben Shmuel. </p>\n\n<p>In the case of the question, it would depend if the boy had converted and became part of the family of the biological father or not. In that case, it would be like an adoption. Otherwise it might be considered an embarrassment for the father to have his name used. If both parties consider it an honor, then it is acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting point is found in masecta Yevamos 101B (Art Scroll 101B4 bottom of the page) in which Rav Shmuel Ben Yehudah explains that he is a ger. Thus we see that even as far back as the gemara a ger could use the name of someone else as the patronymic.</p>\n\n<p>Beit Yosef, Even HaEzer 129:20, quoting Moses ben Isaac</p>\n\n<p>מצאתי שצריך שיכתוב בלשון דלישתמע מיניה שהוא גר כגון שיכתוב הגר או בן אבינו אברהם ―</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I found that one needs to write in language that implies that the\n  person is a convert, for example write ―hager, the convert, <strong>or</strong> son\n  of Avraham Avinu</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(emphasis added). This was regarding a ger who had written a get and discussed the question as to what name needed to be used for the document to be valid.</p>\n\n\n",

(This is as opposed to some who understand that an individual is not required to perform the <em>mitzvah</em> in the face of danger, and only in the context of war, with the <em>tzibbur</em>, does the <em>mitzvah</em> override the danger.)</p>\n<p>According to the Minchas Chinuch, why didn't Mordechai (as an example of someone who <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">seemed to be interested</a> in keeping <em>mitzvos</em> with <em>mesiras nefesh</em> in Shushan) kill, or at least attempt to kill, Haman, a known* and available Amalekite?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See Targum Sheni to Esther 3:1, and Maseches Megillah 13a</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I would connect that to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam's beginning of Melachim</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>שָׁלֹשׁ מִצְוֹת נִצְטַוּוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל בִּשְׁעַת כְּנִיסָתָן לָאָרֶץ:</strong><br>\n  לְמַנּוֹת לָהֶם מֶלֶךְ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יז טו) \"שׂוֹם תָּשִׂים עָלֶיךָ מֶלֶךְ\".<br>\n  וּלְהַכְרִית זַרְעוֹ שֶׁל עֲמָלֵק שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים כה יט) \"תִּמְחֶה אֶת זֵכֶר עֲמָלֵק\".<br>\n  וְלִבְנוֹת בֵּית הַבְּחִירָה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים יב ה) \"לְשִׁכְנוֹ תִדְרְשׁוּ וּבָאתָ שָּׁמָּה\": </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And further:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מִנּוּי מֶלֶךְ קוֹדֵם לְמִלְחֶמֶת עֲמָלֵק.</strong><br>\n  שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמואל א טו א) \"אֹתִי שָׁלַח ה' לִמְשָׁחֳךָ לְמֶלֶךְ\" (שמואל א טו ג) \"עַתָּה לֵךְ וְהִכִּיתָה אֶת עֲמָלֵק\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this causation, <strong>the extermination of the Amalekites is only possible when there's a Jewish King.</strong>.

However, it is permitted to give pets food that contains kitniyot.\n  If one is unable to procure pet food that does not contain chametz, some rabbinical authorities allow for a sale, which would transfer to a gentile the ownership and responsibility of caring for the pet.

As I understand it, the shoe removal must be done without touching their shoes, so that the <em>kohanim</em> need not wash their hands again (because they've touched their shoes) before reciting the blessing.</p>\n\n<p>My kid noticed this and wondered why the <em>kohanim</em> don't remove their shoes before washing their hands. That, after all, would enable them to use their hands to remove their shoes, which is easier.

Since no matter what value you use will be imprecise, the Tanna cut it off after the first digit. </p>\n\n<p>The Tosfos HaRosh to Eiruvin 14a explains the Gemara's question of \"how do we know this ratio of 3:1\" as \"how do we know that we can rely on this imprecise approximation?\" We answer it from the passuk in Melachim 1:7:23 that claims the circumference of the ten-amah-diameter kiyor was thirty amos. </p>\n\n<p>Tosfos to Sukkah 8a prove πr^2. </p>\n\n<p>This topic of irrational mi Yodeya has been breached before: take a look <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/2365/shivim-mi-yodeya/2392#comment2423_2392\">here</a> and at the links quoted in that discussion. </p>\n\n<p>Check out my discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/76194/9682\">here</a> regarding relying on approximations to irrational numbers in Halacha, and my discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/75699/9682\">here</a> involving logarithms regarding taking away 1/60 of a sick person's disease. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Irrational is the value of לג (the Biblical unit).  Allow me to explain:</p>\n\n<p>We find five verses with logs in the Torah (<a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Leviticus.14.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev 14:10, 12, 15, 21, and 24</a>), and they are all logs of oil.  So if we let <em>x</em> be the value of לג, then <em>x =</em> log <em>(oil)</em>.</p>\n\n<p>To figure out what <em>x</em> is, we have to determine the value of <em>oil</em>.  Oil, when not otherwise specified, must mean anointing oil (שמן המשחה), which was comprised of a total of 1500 shekels and 1 hin (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.30.23?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ex 30:23-24</a>).  Now, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_and_Talmudic_units_of_measurement#Liquid_measure\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 hin is equal to 12 logs</a>, which means that <em>oil</em> has the value of <em>1500 + 12x</em> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_notation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">by an abuse of units</a>).</p>\n\n<p>One final item before we solve for <em>x</em>:  with what base do we use the logarithm? Well, in <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Leviticus.14.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev 14:10</a>, we find \"ולג אחד שמן\".  Since לג is already in singular, do we not already know that one is meant?  Rather, the אחד must come to tell us about the base (note also its placement, right after לג).  Since log base 1 is meaningless, the natural logarithm must be intended, ie. base <em>e</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Taking the exponential of both side of <em>x =</em> log <em>(1500 + 12x)</em> leads us to the equation <em>e^x = 1500 + 12x</em>.  Whenever <em>x</em> is rational, the right-hand side is rational, whereas the <a href=\"http://ceemrr.com/Calculus2/Proof%20that%20e%20to%20a%20rational%20is%20irrational.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">left-hand side is irrational</a>.  Thus, we conclude that <em>x</em> is irrational.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Irrational is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">standard deviation</a> of the number of mishnayot in a perek.</p>\n\n<p>The average is 4192/525, the variance is 1207203900/144703125, and the standard deviation is 2/525*√574859.

In the <em>Rambam</em>'s view, to deny any of them constitutes heresy. </p>\n  \n  <p>Although this song is printed in most <em>Siddurim</em>, many congregations follow the view of the <em>Arizal</em> that is not be recited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why was it the position of the Arizal that Yigdal not be recited?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigdal\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> page I cited mentions that it was the Arizal's opinion that Yigdal not be recited, as the prayer it omitted in his siddur.

Shulchan Aruch 307:16 speaks extremely negatively about the (probable) author of Yigdal's other works and strongly discourages reading them, labeling him a <em>machatee es harabim</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Soloveitchik is quoted in Nefesh Harav pg 231 as saying that it violates the principle mentioned by the Ramban in Re'eh that one should not serve God in a similar way to that of idol worshipers. Since the Catholics have a catechism which summarizes their main beliefs, it is forbidden to summarize our main beliefs in a single hymn. </p>\n\n\n",

Also, the 10 stringed lyre was more like a guitar with a longer tuning area, as well as the tuning area being bent backwards.  The body was also teardrop shaped, and  the back was shaped think more pear or bowl shaped, but still in teardrop form.  The 10 stringed harp was just that.  A harp, think of a curved music stand, but instead of a back, it had strings, and was plucked.  It is called David's harp.  There are 8 and 10 string harps.  Throughout the bible, there is talk about tambourines, and horns made of brass.  All these instruments you can buy today.  Some have been rediscovered, as they were still being used in areas some people had never heard of, and some have been in continuous use.  They were used in different ways as well as in conjunction with one another to play beautiful music, soothing music, uplifting music, for all those who were coming to worship at the temple.  At one time I was looking into trying to figure out if I wanted a full size harp or a smaller David's 10 string harp, and then I began to come across all the other instruments.

When the ordinances are ungodly, the 'sound' of that 'instrument' is said to be a 'noise',  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isaiah 14:9-12 \n  9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth;...\n  11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.\n  12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the same figure of 'noise of the harps' that Israel made to God in Amos 5:23-24, and which was 'rejected' by the Most High.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Amos 5<br>\n  23 \"Take away from Me the noise of your songs; I will not even listen to the sound of your harps.<br>\n  24 But let justice roll down like waters And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.…  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand when the ordinances are in righteousness.

The original festival season of Carnaval had originated from the Romans and Greeks...who had celebrated it in service of the Pagan God, Dionysus...\nHowever, the most distinguishing feature is the masquerading, and of course, the\nmasks which this period of celebration, perhaps most famously in Venice, known for its particularly extravagant masks and costumes for this festive period.

He <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.31.40\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָיִיתִי בַיּוֹם אֲכָלַנִי חֹרֶב וְקֶרַח בַּלָּיְלָה וַתִּדַּד שְׁנָתִי מֵעֵינָי</p>\n<p>Often, scorching heat ravaged me by day and frost by night; sleep וַתִּדַּד from my eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There, it is not a matter of interpretation that the word denotes a tortured and unrestful sleep rather than passively being awake at the wrong time. That is Ya'akov's point.</p>\n<p>It may be fair to impute the same mode of sleep disturbance to Achashverosh. Back in the realm of interpretation, this could explain how some of the detailed <em>midrashim</em> on the untold events of this episode were informed. The <em>g'mara</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.15b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>M'gila</em> 15b</a> understood that Achashverosh was greatly troubled over the possibility of his assassination and a missed opportunity for redress in his recent past, which led to his request to review the logs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נפלה ליה מילתא בדעתיה אמר מאי דקמן דזמינתיה אסתר להמן דלמא עצה קא שקלי עילויה דההוא גברא למקטליה הדר אמר אי הכי לא הוה גברא דרחים לי דהוה מודע לי הדר אמר דלמא איכא איניש דעבד בי טיבותא ולא פרעתיה משום הכי מימנעי אינשי ולא מגלו לי מיד ויאמר להביא את ספר הזכרונות דברי הימים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi is likewise explicit about the fact that he was being tormented by justice-seeking amends-makers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהיו מלאכים מבהילים אותו כל הלילה ואמרו לו כפוי טובה שלם טובה למי שעשאה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it could be that נ.ד.ד was the most descriptive verb for the violent nature of Achashverosh's lack of sleep (which would fit nicely with the oscillation/flapping sense of several appearances of this root if it somehow hints at tossing and turning in one's sleep, but I have no source for that connection).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> The other one is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Job.7.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from <em>Iyov</em></a> and therefore less likely to be informative on its own: אִם־שָׁכַבְתִּי וְאָמַרְתִּי מָתַי אָקוּם וּמִדַּד־עָרֶב וְשָׂבַעְתִּי נְדֻדִים עֲדֵי־נָשֶׁף</p>\n\n\n",

The Mahzor Vitry (427) writes that the terms carry the same meaning; calmness:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאין כאן קורת רוח שלימה. קורת רוח. נחת רוח. לשון נתקררה דעתו. וכלפי שהחרון אף ועצבת רוח נקרא חימה. הרצון והנחת רוח נקרא קורת. שמתקררת ומיישבת דעתו עליו מרוב שמחה והנאה </p>\n  \n  <p>That there is not a complete \"korat ruah\". 'Korat ruah': 'nahat ruah'. An expression of of calming [lit. cooling] oneself down. And this corresponds to anger and disturbance of spirit is called 'heimah'[lit. heating], 'ratson' and 'nahat ruah' [a settled spirit] is called 'korat' [literally cooled], for it cools and settles a person's mind from an abundance of happiness and pleasure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously every writer can use words differently...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Korat Ruach is only cited in two places in Mesilat Yesharim</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>בנפש, שישתדל לעשות לחבירו כל <strong>קורת רוח</strong> שיש בידו, בין בעניני הכבוד, בין בכל שאר הענינים, כל מה שהוא יודע שאם יעשהו לחבירו הוא מקבל <strong>נחת רוח</strong> ממנו, מצות חסידות הוא לעשותו, כל שכן שלא יצערנו בשום מיני צער כלל, יהיה באיזה אופן שיהיה.‏</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>ובכלל הענין הזה שלא לצער לשום בריה אפילו בעלי חיים ולרחם ולחוס עליהם, וכן הוא אומר (משלי יב, י) יודע צדיק נפש בהמתו, וכבר יש שסוברים (שבת קכח, ב; בבא מציעא לב, ב) צער בעלי חיים דאורייתא, ועל כל פנים דרבנן. כללו, של דבר הרחמנות וההטבה צריך שתהיה תקוע בלב החסיד לעולם, ותהיה מגמתו תמיד לעשות <strong>קורת רוח</strong> לבריות, ולא לגרום להם שום צער וכו'. ‏</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In the first occurence, almost immediately the author uses as synonym nachat ruach (in the above quotes, nachat ruach and korat ruach are in bold). This two occurences of korat ruach regard Nachat Ruach for humans. As mentioned in the answer of @mevakesh, the word korat refers to cooling, calming. For persons, the happyness is linked to recover from anxiety, doubt. </p>\n\n<p>So, may be that the author uses this expression regarding persons, or animals,  <em>to enlight that there is a particular feature: to make good for other is almost alway to calm his distress, physic or mental</em>. Humans and animals are weak and vulnerable.</p>\n\n\n",

This is a hint to the idea mentioned earlier that, in reluctance to have relations with an uncircumcised gentile, Esther would ordinarily send a sheid to take her place. Now, she was afraid that she would have to appear before Achashverosh alone, without the aid of a demon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://megillatesther.wordpress.com/2014/10/27/esther-416-question-10-why-is-i-will-be-destroyed-written-twice-here/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R’ Shimon Schwab wonders why Esther is concerned about losing her husband if she is anyway using a sheid to get out of relations with Achashverosh. He explains that the demon was created miraculously in reward for her resisting the gentile king. Such a miracle would not occur once she submits to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So until now, she'd never had relations with Achashverosh. As such, she was still permitted to Mordechai. Now, that she would go herself (and not the demon), she would no longer be permitted to Mordechai.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note this does not answer your 1st question.

For all of this time, he did not respect her as an equal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If so, perhaps her only interactions with Achashveros until that point were sexual.

There is only one creation that was יש מאין.  Everything else is יש מיש, a creation from something already existing. Even תחית המתים will be from something.  There is something that God made that doesn’t decay, but will bring about the body in the time of תחית המתים.  </p>\n\n<p>Maybe it shows that in the creation of man, was the blueprints for the time of תחית המתים.  God created in man the seeds of the future.<br>\n[Like when you add cat 7 wiring into a building.  Not for now, but for the future. ]</p>\n\n<p>Man is designed in a certain way that is that he has the capacity to flourish in the existence of תחית המתים.   This לוז in specific is manifest this point that we are designed to exist in future existence. \nSince man in general will decay, this is the nature of the body, but yet we see there is the capacity built in to be able to survive this decay. </p>\n\n<p>The main point is that there is a manner in which we can see that the body can come back.  Whether there is an actual bone or we are talking about something else such as DNA or some other thing, the main point is that there is a something that supports the idea of תחית המתים.  This is what ר' יהושע בן חנניא conveyed to אדריאנוס. </p>\n\n<p>I want to draw out one additional point that may be obvious.  It would seem that the premise of the Eitz Yosef that God will only create יש מיש, from that which already exists, sets the stage for this concept.  In other words, since God will not initiate the process of תחית המתים from nothing, then it must be that there is some element of the body that remains that can be utilized in the process of תחית המתים. This element is what the luz bone represents.  </p>\n\n\n",

Was Haman an exception? Was he kosher, or if not, why were they allowed to eat Haman despite his not being kosher?</li>\n<li>They ate Haman for 40 years. The Torah says that the population of males over 20 was around 600 thousand, and that remained fairly constant throughout the 40 years in the desert. If you factor the children and women, there area a lot more than that number. How large was Haman that he was able to be sufficient food for so many people for 40 years? How did he become so large?</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Perhaps we can answer this by looking at a different question. Even though Haman clearly had <em>basar</em>, the passuk says in Esther <em>vayimalei Haman cheima</em> so he was also filled with butter. Thus, Jews eating him in the desert seemingly violated eating <em>basar bechalav</em>.</p>\n\n<p>To solve this, it could only have been possible if (a) Haman was a fish and (b) they were paskening like the Rama against the Shulchan Aruch with allows to eat fish with milchigs.</p>\n\n<p>(a) Also helps to understand why he had a son named Dalphon, a prehistoric form of <em>dolphin</em>.</p>\n\n<p>That they had enough of him to eat for 40 years can be explained from a Targum Yonason which says he was hanging on the gallows with his children together, so that means he was hung there for 11 months from Pesach to Purim and did not decompose. So we see his body was the place of appearance of a miracle and hence one should not wonder why it was enough - like <em>lechem hapanim</em> even a small amount would be enough to feed a person for a long while and in addition, he eaten portions were replenished miraculously every night. This replenishment ability manifested again after his hanging to keep him from decomposing for 11 months.</p>\n\n<p>This also explains why it was allowed to put pieces of him in or near the aron kodesh which normally would be <em>assur</em> since they are <em>tamei</em> -- but because of this miraculous replenishing ability, the <em>bracha</em> constantly rested on them, and hence they were always in a state of <em>tahara</em></p>\n\n\n",

Do all boys in Conservative Judaism give a <em>d'var Torah</em> on their bar Mitzvah, or is that not until after the bar Mitzvah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am unaware of any \"formal halacha\" that requires this. As a matter of fact, halachically, absolutely no party whatsoever is required for a Bar Mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>It has been a long-time custom to make some type of Bar Mitzvah party, esp. in U.S. Ideally, this party should be a <em>Se'udat mitzvah</em>. To do this, typically, a <em>siyum</em> (completion of a Talmud tractate) is made. Sometimes, the Bar Mitzvah makes this siyum, but it could be done by anyone. Regardless, it is common for the Bar Mitvah to make some <em>D'var Torah</em> at the celebration. On many occasions, no siyum is made, however, the Bar Mitzvah and, frequently various rabbis, sometimes associate with the family's shul or boy's yeshiva, give Divrei Torah. (The nicest ones I've seen are where the Bar Mitzvah's D'var Torah incorporates some verse or adage into his appreciation of his parents.)</p>\n\n<p>From what I have seen, this is common protocol at Orthodox Bar Mitzvah celebrations. I have not seen this done at Conservative or Reform ones. However, I have seen Bar Mitzvah say a D'var Torah in shul on the Shabbat that they receive their aliyah in Orthodox (in addition to the one they do at the party) as well as Conservative and Reform shuls.</p>\n\n\n",

What is the significance for these numbers? \nThe Sephardic form of windings are 10, 5, 6 and 5. What is the significance for these numbers?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Mughrabi (North West African) part of your question is straightforward. If you translate those winding numbers -- 10 + 5 + 6 + 5 -- back though gematria, you get Hashem's name: י - 10, ה - 5, ו - 6, ה- 5.</p>\n<p>The Ashkenazi, classical Sepharadic (Spanish & Portuguese) and Mizrachi (Middle Eastern) sides are more nuanced. As sam wrote in his answer, the number of windings is 39, which is to equal Hashem Echad (Hashem is One - Unique and Indivisible).</p>\n<p>The Beis Yoseif says the 5 knots are so that when we hold the two front corners while saying Shema (yes, I know there is a different custom to hold all 4 corners), we have 10 knots, corresponding to the 10 sefiros through which Hashem's Presence is felt in creation.</p>\n<p>In the gemara's system, there are 7 to 13 groups of windings. And it sounds like each group was 3 windings. (Majority opinion, Rav Natrunai Gaon reads it as \"once, twice, three times, [and so on]\".) Rashi, Tosafos and the Moredechai say that the gemara is specific to winding tzitzis with techeiles, and not applicable to us. But either way, it shows there is some kind of significance to 39 windings because it's 3 * 13. No \"why\" there, just an indication the number is significant to the mitzvah of tzitzis.</p>\n<p>But 39 also comes up in at least two other contexts: the maximum number of lashes the court may give as corporal punishment  (if the person is healthy like an ox, and could take the maximum), as well as the number of melakhos, categories of constructive labor, prohibited on Shabbos.</p>\n<p>Lashes are meted out in groups of three, separated by doctor inspections.</p>\n<p>7, 8, 11, 13, though, closely matches the way the 39 prohibited activities of Shabbos divide up. The first 11 melakhos (Shabbos 7:2) describe the steps necessary to grow wheat, turn it into flour, and make the showbread. The next 13 are about preparing the cloth of the curtains of the Mishkan, from the wool to the dying to the weaving and sowing. Seven melakhos relate to preparing hides into leather, and the last 8 are simply “none of the above.\"</p>\n<p>As I wrote in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/76330/1570\">another answer recently</a>, Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan explains how 40 represents creation, and thus 39 is the number that indicates human efforts to imitate Divine Creation. (The 40th being creation ex nihilo, something from nothing, which people are incapable of doing.) And so, the person who acts to undermine the purpose of creation gets 39 lashes, and to commemorate resting from creation, we rest from 39 acts.</p>\n<p>Ashkenazi tzitzis therefore also invokes creation; having the same 39 divided into the same groups as the melakhos cannot be coincidental.</p>\n<p>As Rav Hirsch put it, tzitzis are literally sprouts. They represent the human creative extension of our basic functional garments. They start off bound, channeled by the Torah, after which they are given free extension -- we should express our individuality within the framework the Torah gives us.</p>\n<p>The reminder of creation thus fits Rav Hirsch's general approach to the mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>7,8,11,13 equals to 39 in gematria. 39 equals HaShem Echad in gematria.  </p>\n\n<p>10,5,6,5 is equal to the Shem Havya (yud..hey...)</p>\n\n\n",

Due to the sins of mankind, Hashem tilted the Earth to its current position of 23.5 degrees from the celestial equator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where does the Sforno say this?

And the reason is that 'you do not know the reward granted for the mitsvot.' That is to say, that the mind simply cannot comprehend the magnitude of reward for mitsvot, such that for even the very smallest, there is great reward for your act.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam, however, explains (in his commentary there) that the Mishna refers not to objectively small or large mitsvot, but to <em>perceived</em> small and large mitsvot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שראוי להזהר במצוה שייחשב בה שהיא קלה, כגון שמחת הרגל ולמידת לשון קודש, ובמצוה שהתבארה חומרתה, כמו מילה וציצית ושחיטת פסח. ושם סיבת זה, שאין אתה יודע מתן שכרן, ובאור זה הענין ... מצוות עשה - לא נתבאר שכר כל אחת מהן מהו אצל ה', עד שנדע מה מהן יותר חשוב ומה מהן למטה מזה, אלא ציוה לעשות מעשה פלוני ופלוני, ולא ייודע שכר איזה משניהם יותר גדול אצל ה', ולפיכך ראוי להשתדל בכולן </p>\n  \n  <p>That it is fitting to be careful with a mitsvah which he perceives as minor, such as celebrating on the festivals and teaching Hebrew, besides for a mitsvah whose importance is clear such as circumcision and tsitsit, and the korban Pesah. And he gave the following reason: that you do not know the reward granted for the mitsvot. And the explanation for this is...[that] positive commandment--the reward for each one has not been specified by God, to the point where we would know what is more important and what is considered less important to God. Therefore, it is appropriate to exert oneself for all of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It should be noted that even Rambam places different value on different positive mitsvot. (As he hinted to with the tsitsit example). For example, he writes (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/7210.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Mat'not Aniyim 10:1</a>) that we must be more careful with charity than with any other mitsvah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייבין אנו להיזהר במצות צדקה, יתר מכל מצוות עשה</p>\n  \n  <p>We must be more careful with the mitsvah of charity than with any other positive commandment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In that case he demonstrates this with different verses about its importance.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, according to the Akedah, one can know (he doesnt say how) that some mitsvot are more important than others, but should nevertheless madly pursue the lesser ones, for even their value is mind boggling. Rambam on the other hand concedes that you can know that importance of some mitsvot, such as tsitsit and charity, (based on scriptural evidence n the case of the latter and perhaps the former), but nevertheless focuses on the fact that in general with positive mitsvot we don't know which are which, and therefore should treat them equally.</p>\n\n\n",

When Herod rebuilt the temple on the advice of Bava be Buta (Bava Basra 3b), it was considered as re-establishing and remodeling the existing temple established by Ezra. Thus, it was considered as part of the Second Temple, rather than a different building. During the entire construction, services continued and it was regarded as the Temple continuing to exist.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishmag.com/111mag/temple/temple.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ezra's Temple, Herod's Temple and Ezekiel's vision of the Third Temple </a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All our systems, processes, and institutions were born in the shadow\n  of the destruction of the Second Temple. So many rabbis and millions\n  of other Jews had been slain in their prime by Rome, that knowledge of\n  the Second Temple was lost and had to be recovered by deductive\n  reasoning and homiletic interpretation of scriptural verses, resulting\n  in disagreement about most Temple related matters. This has led to\n  great confusion about the Temple, even among some of the greatest\n  scholars.</p>\n  \n  <p>To set the record straight: there were two Second Temples. The first\n  one was built 70 years after the destruction of Solomon's original\n  Temple. This second Temple stood for 332 years, then was removed and\n  rebuilt by Herod. Herod's Temple took eight years to build and stood\n  for 80 years, then was destroyed by Rome. So different from each other\n  were these two Temples that the Medrash (Numbers Rabba 14) assigns a\n  different sacrifice as their essence. The original Second Temple,\n  built by Zerubavel, governor of Judea, under the direction of Ezra and\n  King Darius of Persia, is represented by a ram as a burnt offering.\n  The rebuilt Second Temple, erected by Herod, is represented by a goat\n  as a sin offering.</p>\n  \n  <p>For the most part, the Talmud treats the two Temples as one, and we\n  often think we are learning about Ezra's Temple, when in reality we\n  are almost always learning about Herod's Temple.</p>\n  \n  <p>Few people realize that the miracle of Chanukah took place in Ezra's\n  Temple, not Herod's. The Maccabees vanquished the Greeks and\n  rededicated Ezra's Temple in 3597 (163 B.C.E), fully 145 years before\n  Herod's Temple was built.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Mishna and the Rambam describe only Herod's Temple. Even the great\n  Rambam confuses the two, stating explicitly in the Mishneh Torah (Laws\n  of the Temple) that the height of Ezra's Temple was 100 cubits, but in\n  truth only Herod's Temple was 100 cubits high. Ezra's Temple was 60\n  cubits high as reported in Ezra 6:3. In Herod's speech to the Jews,\n  recorded by Josephus (Antiquities, book XV), Herod proclaims that the\n  original builders of the Second Temple were limited by the Persian\n  king to a Temple only 60 cubits high, while he, Herod, promised to\n  raise it to a the appropriate height of 100 cubits.</p>\n  \n  <p>This Temple of Herod was no simple beautification project. Herod\n  removed Ezra's Temple, stone by stone, right down to the ground, and\n  then removed the foundations and built an entirely new Temple of his\n  own. Herod enlarged the Azora (Inner Courtyard) which was forbidden by\n  Halacha without a Sanhedrin of 71 judges, a Jewish King, and the Urim\n  and Tumim (the oracle of the High Priests Breastplate). Herod, who was\n  not Jewish, had murdered all the members of the Sanhedrin; the Urim\n  and Tumim had not existed since the destruction of the First Temple.\n  In effect, the Second Temple described in the Mishna and the Rambam\n  was an illegal structure, doomed to destruction from the very day it\n  was built.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Herod did not rebuild a temple.

The concept of Demai. Mishna Maaser Sheni 5, 15:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yochanan the High Priest and in his day, no one had to ask about Demai</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Bartenura in his comment wrote (this is a summary of the comment of Rambam):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yochanan High Priest refreesh to his generation the knowledge that Teruma Maaser is punishable by death as Teruma Gedola. {there was people who take Teruma Gedola only from the grain, because they were aware of the severity of its consumption}. He introduced a procedure to avoid this doubt. Scrupulous people who buy fruits from Am Haarets need to take Terumat Maaser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>II. The degree of doubt</h3>\n<p>But this doubt is not truly a doubt according to Tora criterion, because a Majority of Ame Haarets still take maaser Rishon, which contains the Terumat Maaser (Bartenura Berachot 7, 1). Thus, from the Tora Point of view, fruit from Am Haarets are allowed because of the Rule of Majority. But Rabbis decided to be stringent and made a special procedure to be sure that Terumat Maaser was taken.</p>\n<p>Since this is not a \"true doubt\", there are several circumstantial leniencies (see chapter 3, Mishna 1).</p>\n<p>The first Mishna of the Tractate Demai taught us one of those leniencies. It is known that fruit coming from an abandoned field are exempt from trumot and maasrot. If the majority of one specie of fruits come from abandoned fields, following the Rule of Majority, one can consume, without Teruma or Maaser. Rabbi Yochanan (Yerushalmi Demai 1, 1) says that the majority of the fruits listed in the Mishna come from fruits that belongs to no one.</p>\n<p>As Yochanan High Priest is stringent with Demai despite the majority. It is logical to expect that he is stringent to take Teruma and Maaser for fruit that generally come from abandoned places.</p>\n<h3>III. Conjunction of two majorities</h3>\n<p>But here the conjunction of both majorities generates a leniency.\nOne majority alone is not good derabanan, but two are: If it is hefker, it is exempt, if not hefker, majority says that maaser was taken. So we need two sfekot,  Sfek sfeka is not relevant here because according to the Din Derabanan there is no safek, Mideorayta there is no din safek but din Chezkat Heyter.</p>\n<p>In the first edition of this answer I tried to explain the Bartenura and Rambam according to the explanation of the Bavli for the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan, to explain a couple of Kashiot, but I skipped it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This mishnah is according to the pirush mishnajot of the Rambam:\nAs i understand this mishnah, this is not a normal chazaka, but a statement that most of these fruits or vegetables come from hefker. </p>\n\n<p>Because of this fact we have two sfekot.</p>\n\n<p>For the other sorts of fruits and vegetables we wouldn't even have a safek that it came from hefker because we bought it from a person.</p>\n\n<p>The rambam in hilchot maaser chapter 12 halacha 1 says that even the am haaretz did say that he did not measer these sort types of vegetables it is patur from maasrot because cheskatan from hefker.

Because it was designed both as a prayer, and as a source of inspiration, it was composed in Yiddish, the prevailing language among Eastern European Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is the text of the prayer, vowelized for convenience:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גָאט פוּן אַבְרָהָם אוּן פוּן יִצְחָק אוּן פוּן יַעֲקֹב, בַּאהִיט דַיין פָאלק יִשְׂרָאֵל פוּן אַלֶעם בֵּייזִין אִין דַיינֶעם לוֹיבּ, אַז דֶער לִיבֶּער שַׁבָּת קוֹדֶשׁ גֵייט אַוֶועק, אַז דִיא וָואךְ זָאל אוּנְז קוּמֶען צוּ אֱמוּנָה שְׁלֵימָה, צוּ אֱמוּנַת חֲכָמִים, צוּ אַהֲבַת וְדִבּוּק חֲבֵרִים טוֹבִים, צוּ דְבֵיקוּת הַבּוֹרֵא בָּרוּךְ הוּא, מַאֲמִין צוּ זַיין בִּשְׁלוֹשָׁה עָשָׂר עִיקָרִים שֶׁלְּךָ, וּבִגְאוּלָה שְׁלֵמָה וּקְרוֹבָה בִמְהֵרָה בְּיָמֵינוּ, וּבִתְחִיַת הַמֵּתִים, וּבִנְבוּאַת מֹשֶׁה רַבֵּינוּ עָלָיו הַשָּׁלוֹם.</p>\n  \n  <p>רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם דוּא בִּיסְט דָאךְ הַנּוֹתֵן לַיָּעֵף כֹּחַ, גִיבּ דֵיינֶע לִיבֶּע אִידִישֶׁע קִינְדֶערְלֶעךְ אוֹיךְ כֹּחַ דִיךְ צוּ לוֹיבֶּין, אוּן דִיךְ צוּ דִינֶען אוּן וַוייטֶער קֵיינֶעם נִישְׁט.</p>\n  \n  <p>אוּן דִיא וָואךְ זָאל אוּנְז קוּמֶען צוּ חֶסֶד, אוּן צוּ מַזָל, אוּן צוּ בְרָכָה, אוּן צוּ הַצְלָחָה, אוּן צוּ גֶעזוּנְט, אוּן צוּ עוֹשֶׁר וְכָבוֹד, אוּן צוּ בָּנֵי חַיֵי וּמְזוֹנֵי, לָנוּ וּלְכָל יִשְׂרָאֵל. אָמֵן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And finally, the translation into English (and you can see the similarities between the prayer you found and this one):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>G-d of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, protect Your people, Israel, from all evil in Your praise - as the beloved, holy Sabbath takes leave - that the coming week may arrive to bring perfect faith, faith in scholars, love of and attachment to good friends, attachment to the Creator, Blessed is He, to have faith in Your Thirteen Principles, and in the complete and close Redemption, speedily in our days, in the Resuscitation of the Dead and in the prophecy of our teacher, Moses, peace be upon him.</p>\n  \n  <p>Master of the universe, since You are the One Who gives strength to the exhausted - give Your beloved Jewish children the strength to praise You, and to serve only You and no other.</p>\n  \n  <p>May this week arrive for kindness, for good fortune, for blessing, for success, for good health, for wealth and honor, and for children, life, and sustenance, for us and for all Israel.

The gemara states that if removing the ash is considered an avodah (<em>tana kamah</em>), then a kohen baal mum may not do so.

    "content": "# Why does David refuse to kill Shimi b. Gera, but then later tell Shlomo to kill him?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>II Samuel 16:5-14</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And king David came to Bahurim and, behold, there came out of there a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera, coming forth and cursing. And he threw stones at David, and at all king David's servants and at all the people and at all the mighty men who were on his right and on his left hand. And so said Shimei in his curse, \"Begone, begone, you man of blood, and you wicked man. The Lord has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you have reigned; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hands of Absalom your son; and behold you are in your own evil for you are a man of blood.\" And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, \"Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I beg you, and remove his head.\" And the king said, \"What is it between me and you, sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the Lord has [surely] said to him, 'Curse David'; who then shall [have the right to] say, 'Why have you done so'?\" And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, \"Behold my son who came from my body seeks my life; how much more now [that] the Benjamite [should do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord has bidden him. Perhaps the Lord will see (the tears of) my eye, and the Lord will return to me good instead of his curse on this day.\" And David and his men went by the road; and Shimei went along the hillside opposite him, going and cursing and he threw stones toward him, and he threw earth. And the king, and all the people that were with him were weary, and he refreshed himself there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Translation via <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15876/jewish/Chapter-16.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Shimi ben Gera was actively hurling insults at King David, Hashem's anointed, but when Abishai suggests to David that he [Shimi] be executed, David insists not, and spares his life. </p>\n\n<p>However, later, in I Kings 2:9, David charges his heir Shlomo with the task of taking revenge on Shimi ben Gera for what he did. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And, behold, there is with you Shimei the son of Gera the Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim, and he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.' And now hold him not guiltless, for you are a wise man, and you will surely know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his hoary head down to the grave with blood.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There seems to be a big contradiction here. First, David spares Shimi's life, but then later he tells his son Shlomo to execute him because of his actions. Why? Perhaps David took an oath that Shimi would not die in his lifetime but that after he died Shimi would be charged and executed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Both Targums on Esther 2:5 identify The Shimei in Mordecai's lineage with Shimei Ben Gera. They state that David saw through a prophetic experience that Mordecai (and Esther according to the first Targum) descended from Shimei, so he delayed his revenge until Shimei stopped bearing children to allow for the subsequent salvation of the Jewish people in the Purim story.</p>\n\n\n",

He said to me, \"Tell them in my name: You know that the country is rife with soldiers; I have a tradition from Rabban Gamliel the Elder that we allow a woman to marry based on a single witness. And when I went and reported this before Rabban Gamliel he exulted in my words and said, 'We have found a colleague for Rabbi Yehudah ben Bava.' Through the conversation Rabban Gamliel recalled that people were killed at Tel Arza and Rabban Gamliel allowed their wives to marry based on a single witness, and they established a rule to allow women to marry based on a single witness, and they established a rule to allow women to marry based on [what] a witness [heard] from a witness, and based on [the testimony of] a slave, [or] based on [the testimony of] a woman, [or] based on [the testimony of] a maidservant.

They [the Sages] said to him: It once happened that some Levites went to Tzo'ar, the city of palm trees, and one of them fell ill on the journey, and he was brought to an inn [and left there].

When they stopped using bonfires, they used messengers. So clearly there were people in Bavel at the time. </p>\n\n<p>As for famous Tannaim, the Gemara in AZ 18b records that after R' Meir freed his sister-in-law from a brothel and the money he gave the guard to bribe the latter's superiors ran out, the guard spilled the story, at which point R' Meir was forced to flee to Bavel. Others say it was because he indirectly caused his wife to commit suicide (see Rashi there, citing Kiddushin 80b). Now, since one should only leave to a place of Torah (Avos 4:14), presumably there was an established Yeshiva that was already there.</p>\n\n\n",

I am having trouble locating that letter,since I dont know which version it was in,does anyone recall where it is?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the book Noam Elimelech, three letters address the nusach sfard usef by chasidim.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that the letter you are remembering is a letter in which the NE explains that when he did become older he realized the goodness of nusach sfard, here is an extract:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גיה\"ק הגיעני ומה שכתב מעלתו אם לשנות הנוסחא ולהתפלל בנוסח ספרד מיום עמדי על דעתי בידיעת ספר ראיתי וגם שמעתי שהיו מתפללים בנוסח ספרד גם רבותי ספרו לי שהיה בימיהם וקודם שהיו עדיין מעטים בימיהם  <strong>והנה אני לא הבנתי את הנוסחא הנ\"ל עתה הנה נא זקנתי הבנתי התועלת והמעלה של אותה הנוסחא עד שבלתי אפשרי להעלות על הכתב גודל מעלתה גם אם הייתי במבטא בשפתיי איני יודע בבירור אם היה אפשר להבינו</strong>  אך צריך שיהיה  המתפללים בנוסח הזה פרושים מדרכי העולם הראשון מהפרישה שלא להוציא שקר מפיו ושלא להיות מקלל את חבירו אפילו בני ביתו בשום פעם גם שלא יקפיד עליהם, אפילו הקפדה בלב, ושלא להוציא שבועה מפיו ושלא להיות לו קנאה וחמדת ממון ומדת גאוה בלתי אפשרי להעלות על הכתב גנותי כידוע לכם שאני מוכיח עצמי תמיד ומבייש עצמי ברבים כדי להוציא מכח אל הפועל ושלא להיות משתכר בשום פעם בשום משקה המשכר כי אם מעט לצורך מה גם שיהא מרגיש בעצמו באמת שאין לו שום מנוחה מדאגות מצרות ישראל ולבו כואב ומיצר עליהם מבלי הפוגות עד שמגודל הצער בלתי יכול להתאפק מלתהפלל עליהם בינו לבין עצמו אף שאינו ראוי והגון בעיני עצמו על כללות ישראל ואפילו על שונאיו אם לא שיראה מהם שעוברים על מצוות עשה או לא תעשה ועיקר שיהיה למדן על כל פנים גמרא ותוספות ופירוש רש\"י ושאר דרכי הקודם כמבואר בספר עץ חיים ועיקר אהבת חברים ודיבוק חברים ומי שאין בו כל המידות הללו בוודאי אינו מכת זו ומי שיש בו כל המידות הללו אותם בני אדם ראוי וטוב להם להתפלל בנוסח ספרד הגם שידעתי בכם שאינכם עדיין במדרגה זו ככל הצורך אף על פי כן מחמת שאני רואה שנפשכם חשקה מאוד ומתאמצים מאוד לבא בעבודת הבורא יתברך באמת הבא לטהר מסייעין לו והנוסחא זו גם כן מסייע שתוכלו להחזיק בעבודתו יתברך שמו באמת כיון שאתם משתוקקים לבא באמת בחמדה הנ\"ל ואם לאו חלילה להתפלל בנוסחא הנ\"ל כי הנה ראיתי אנשים גדולים שהם פרושים מדרכי העולם אבל הכל בשביל הנאתם גם יש לומדים בטלית ותפילין אש אין לך פרישות גדול מזה כי באמת הדברים הללו הם טובים אך שאין בהם פנימיות: שלום וישע רב לאהובי או\"נ הנצמד בקירות לבי התורני והרבני חכם ומושלם וותיק ועושה חסד כש\"ת מו\"ה יהודה נ\"י ויופיע:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this letter the author says that he already the nusach sfard was already present when he was young. He says that <strong>when he was young he did not understand this nusach, but when he became older, he understand the greatness of this nusach</strong>. He says that this nusach is for spiritually elevated people, or for persons with spiritual elevation ambition and sincerity.</p>\n\n<p>A matter of reflection is the hypothetical presence in central Europe of diverse nusachaot. There are many countries in Europe in which several nusachaot were present. In an other letter of the son of the Noam Elimelech, we can read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וידקדק על עצמו כחוט השערה לקיים הכל המבואר בפוסקים ובפרט בשולחן ערוך אורח חיים ובספרי מוסר אשר עודנה חיים בגן עדן  <strong>ואחר כך יתפלל נוסחא זו של הבית יוסף ז\"ל</strong>  ובוודאי יטעום בה טעם ולא יהיה יכול להתאפק מלהתפלל נוסחא זו אף שיהיו מתקוטטים עמו לא יחוש ויסבול הכל, וכך אמר אדוני אבי מורי אם תרצו להשגיח בדבריי אלו תראו שדבריי כנים ואמיתיים ומי שיש לו עוד ספקות וקושיות על עובדי השם יתברך </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also an advise to pray in nusach, called Nusach Bet Yosef, when a great degree of spiritual integrity is reached.</p>\n\n<p>In an other letter, the son of the Noam Elimelech wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושאלתי אדוני אבי ומורי נרו יאיר שיאמר לי מאי טעמא משנים הנוסחאות שבתפילה והשיב לי כך הלא הבית יוסף ז\"ל שהוא ראש לכל הפוסקים הוא ז\"ל מביא אלו הנוסחאות ואחר כך בא הרמ\"א ז\"ל שהוא גם כן ראש לכל הפוסקים איזן וחיקר כל התיקונים על מכונם לפני כללות ישראל וראה בנוסחא זו שהוא אור גדול ואין העולם כדאי להשתמש בו והעמיד לנו נוסחא אשכנזית שהוא דבר השוה לכל נפש כערכנו  <strong>אבל לפני הצקידים אלו אשר רחצו מצואתם ומדקדקים על עצמם כחוט השערה וודאי לא היה כוונתו ז\"ל עליהם לבטל אותם מלהתפלל נוסחא זו שכתב הבית יוסף</strong>  אלו ואלו דברי אלוקים חיים: ואם תשקה לך הלא יש כמה אנשים שאינם במדרגה זו כאשר כתבתי ואף על פי כן מתפללים נוסחא זו ומתחברים לחסידים עליונים וגם הם נקראים בשם חסידים ...‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that according to the version of the history, the both nuschaot were present in Poland and the Rama decided  that the nusach Ashkenaz is more understandable. But the nusach of the Bet Yosef was already present. I assume that the nusach BY is probably the old nusach sepharadi and Arizal did pray in a sepharadic siddur.  The Baal Shem Tov was living in an area closest to the Ottoman Empire. Probably the sepharadic siddurim were known in middle Europa before the advent of chasifism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Noam Elimelech himself perhaps allways prayed Nusach Sfard.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Judaism kill the infidels?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I apologize in advance if this comes across as provocative. That is not at all my intention; I ask simply to learn. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>\"Kill the infidels\" is a phrase often used to describe Islam's stance on disbelievers - chop their heads off, poke their eyes out, and other gruesome forms of death. </p>\n\n<p>Although Judaism does not invite such severe forms of killing, they seem to believe in the similar principle of join us or die. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi to Shemos 17:16 says that \"as long as Amalek's memory endures, Hashem's Name and His throne are not complete.\" Seemingly what he is referring to is the oft-quoted statement that Amalek stands against everything Judaism is for - namely, expressing Hashem's Presence in the world. As such, we cannot exist side by side. It's for this reason that R' Aharon Kotler (Mishnas Rav Aharon, Vol. 4 pg. 137-8, explaining Sanhedrin 20b) says that we had to wipe out Amalek before building the Beis HaMikdash - as the Beis HaMikdash brings the Shechinah to the world and Amalek strives to remove it from the world, we had to destroy Amalek in order for the Beis HaMikdash to be built. </p>\n\n<p>Isn't this a little extreme? In general, we have an obligation to extend peace to the nations we attack (Devarim 20:10ff), yet nowhere do we find that this applies to Amalek.<sup>1</sup> Why is this so? Because Amalek refuses to acknowledge Hashem's sovereignty, that gives us a right to kill them? Let them get their due when Mashiach comes and the nations are punished for their sins (see AZ 2a-3b). Why can we not keep our Beis HaMikdash to ourselves and let them keep to themselves?</p>\n\n<p>Had the sources said they attacked first, therefore we could attack back, that would be one thing; we find a similar discussion by Midian (Bamidbar 26,31). But that's not why we're allowed to kill Amalek, according to the above; it's because they're anti-HaShem. Why is that license to kill?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> I am aware that Rashi to Devarim 20:10, citing Sifrei there, explains this passage as referring to <em>optional</em> wars, of which Amalek clearly is not, and so this point would not apply. However, the Ramban to the above passuk, as well as Rambam (Malachim 6:1,4) hold that it applies to obligatory wars as well, and thus at least according to them this point would stand. When one is supposed to call out for peace is not for this post; those curious may refer to Sefer HaChinuch 527, Tosfos to Gittin 46a, and Yerushalmi Sheviis 1:6. Also see the above Ramban inside for how he defends himself against the Sifrei. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>No, it can't be proven from these sources that Jews have a \"join us or die\" stance and are commanded to either enslave or kill the rest of the world. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36521/were-amalek-offered-a-peaceful-exit\">here</a> that the killing of Amalek and the seven nations was limited to cases where they did not accept the most basic moral requirements expected of all nations - not to kill, steal, etc. or if they refused to make peace. They need not join us to be spared.</p>\n\n<p>The Tosfos you mention does not imply that we are supposed to enslave as many people as possible. Tosfos doesn't cite the earlier verse because it doesn't prove his point that prisoners were enslaved rather than killed.</p>\n\n<p>Eved Kena'ani also doesn't imply that there is any commandment to actively go out and enslave people.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, there is another important distinction between the 'kill the infidels' stance and the Jewish faith: those nations no longer exist, so even if we were commanded to kill them unconditionally it would still be just in theory. We don't practically pose a danger to anyone as a result of these beliefs.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>We know there is no commandment to kill/conquer/enslave non Jews in general because God forbade the Jews from attacking Edom when leaving Egypt and Joshua would have killed the Gibeonites regardless of where they said they were from. Later on, David is commanded by God to turn over some members of Saul's family to the Gibeonites for revenge killing, indicating that God wants the Gibeonites to be appeased and not utterly degraded. Furthermore, we see Solomon having good relations with Egypt, Sheba, and Tyre. Tyre even did much of the work for the Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

Since many locales around the world don't have any sources of kosher food, how can compliant Jews travel there? What degree of certainty is needed in the fact that a certain food is okay before it is permissible to eat it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It honestly depends on the context of the situation. There isn't a universal standard because it all depends on what knowledge you have, where the situation is occurring and what what the circumstances may be. <strong>The Torah is extremely specific</strong> regarding a situation where the laws may be broken. This is usually only ever done during a situation where you face physically harming yourself or another.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pikuach nefesh</strong> is the standard by which we honor Torah. We do not honor Torah if it means that we are going to harm ourselves or harm another.</p>\n\n<p><em>Example, you wouldn't eat Kosher food over non-Kosher food if you were certain that the Kosher food was contaminated with E-Coli. The act of eating tainted food is equal to drinking poison. Thus it's declared \"Pikuach nefesh\"</em></p>\n\n<p>We see this concept mentioned twice in Torah and discussed in the commentaries. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.5?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">You shall keep My laws and My rules, by the pursuit of which man shall live: I am the LORD.</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>-Leviticus 18:5</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.20.11-12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>I gave them My laws and taught them My rules, by the pursuit of which a man shall live.</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>-Ezekiel 20:11</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To answer your specific questions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let's say a Jew travels on a long transatlantic flight. There are no food options except the on-board menu and non of them are kosher-certified. In this situation is it okay to choose a safer option (e.g. vegan or vegetarian)? Or should a Jew then abstain from eating for the duration of the flight?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unless you have a medical condition which would make fasting dangerous (hypoglycemia for example) then you would abstain from eating. Fasting is not unusual from the Jewish perspective as we practice ritual fasting in religious practice. To go without food is not considered a form of self-harm unless you have a medical condition or the time which you are going without food is long enough to be harmful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Vegetarian</strong> does not mean Kosher. The Vegetarian option would possibly include dairy which doesn't come from Kosher sources. This means that it wouldn't be considered the \"safe\" choice.</p>\n\n<p>Even the vegan option would be questionable depending upon the circumstances of the preparation. The Kosher certification of a food product doesn't just gaurantee that the product was made with Kosher ingredients. The standard means that the product was made in a factory which separates meat and dairy. </p>\n\n<p><strong>If I eat a mixed green vegan salad from a service which also sells salads dairy and meat</strong> (BLT salad for example) then the salad could have possibly been prepared under unclean circumstances. The salad might very well be clean but the fact that we don't know means we are treading on breaking dietary law.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to specific Talmudic discussions on the breaking of dietary laws, you can find them below. </p>\n\n<p>-<strong><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.83a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 83:a:2</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A similar situation could occur with purchasing food in a country where no kosher options are available - would it be okay to buy milk and vegetables from a non-Jewish supermarket?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You are responsible for doing research for the area which you visit. If you knew you were traveling to a country, you need to be aware of their dietary laws and prepare accordingly.</li>\n<li>You would only be allowed to eat foods which supercede dietary guidelines. This being mostly vegetables. The dairy options from those countries would not be allowed and since you have options which you know for certain would not break dietary laws, you would be forced to choose those.</li>\n<li>Even if you do choose vegetables over dairy, you still have to make sure your cooking situation meets standards. You would need to make sure that you're not cooking with utensils which haven't been cross contaminated with diary/meat. Your cooking surfaces would also need to be sterilized and/or covered with tin foil to prevent contamination. This way, even if the surface did touch meat/dairy before you were cooking there, there is no chance of mixing occurring. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/82672/jewish/Koshering-Appliances-and-Utensils.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chabad has a detailed explanation of what goes into maintaining a Kosher kitchen.</a> These are some of the standards you would need to maintain within this place you traveled. </p>\n\n<p>Even if they don't offer kosher options, keeping kosher is still possible. The responsibility is on us to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Really, you're dealing with two different cases here. The first case is one in which you are temporarily confined and there are only things that are non-kosher available. In this case, because you would expect to deplane soon, it would not be permissible to eat the food. If for some reason you were stuck on the airplane for days on end, then it would become permissible to eat non-kosher food to stay alive. The other case is being in a foreign country where kosher-certified foods aren't generally available. The good news is that many foods are \"kosher by nature\": they're permissible even without certification. Raw vegetables and fruits are definitely in this category, as are many other raw plant-based ingredients. Milk might be kosher without certification although this is a hotly debated topic and applies on a country-by-country basis. By this logic, too, in the case of the airplane, it would be permissible to e.g. drink bottled water. </p>\n\n<p>But as others have pointed out in the comments, you really need to consult a competent authority if this is not just hypothetical, since there are many, many distinctions that I'm not covering here.</p>\n\n\n",

The second question is, if the 40th has precedence over the 56th, that is he is stuck with his gentile family, then will he or won't he have a place in World to Come no matter how righteous a life he lives till the day he dies in all aspects of the Torah except having a gentile family? She won't convert neither she'll marry again if she is dumped her, since she's Catholic which won't recognize divorce or allow a second marriage. Looking for real Torah answer without any interference from political correctness.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the blessing for cheese cake or apple pie?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The apple pie that I commonly eat has primarily visible apples (you can see the slices) and there is a very thin layer of pie crust on the bottom. Clearly, the apples are the majority. Since the apples are majority, should I say \"Ha'etz\" or still say mezonot because it's considered \"cake\"?</p>\n\n<p>The cheesecake, similarly, has no dough in the batter. It's farmer cheese, eggs, vanilla extract and sugar mixed and placed on a very thin crust. The cheese mix is the majority ingredient. Should I say \"shehakol\" or say \"mezonot\" because it's considered \"cake\"?</p>\n\n<p>I'm implying the rules of <em>ikkar</em> (main food) vs. \"tafel\" (\"supplement). Usually, the rules is that you make the bracha on the \"ikar\", which is frequently the majority ingredient. Is there a different definition of \"ikar\" regarding the above-mentioned foods?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://oukosher.org/guide-to-blessings/#baked\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The OU Brachot page</a> has an interesting answer. I have copied the part regarding the apple pie, but the answer for the cheese cake has similar rules:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As with all cakes, the dough is considered the primary ingredient and\n  only Mezonot is necessary (Mishnah Berurah 212:1), even if there is\n  less dough than apple, and even if the cake is eaten mainly because of\n  the apple. To say an Al Hamichya one must eat a k'zayit of cake within\n  a kdei achilat pras (2-9 minutes). Otherwise, one says a Borei\n  Nefashot. On the other hand, if there is merely a thin strip of dough,\n  which is intended just to help you handle all the apple, the dough\n  becomes subordinate to the apple and only Ha-aytz need be said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In brief, it depends how thick the dough is. Additionally, in viewing the Mishnah Berurah (it is partially in the paragraph following the one referenced (par. 2)) it says that if you eat the apples and the crust separately, you are clearly indicating that you have no preference of one item over the other and there is no <em>ikar</em> and <em>tafel</em> scenario. In such cases, each gets its own blessing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The OP regards mezonot/not mezonot, Ykar/Tafel.</p>\n\n<p>See SA OC 204, 12:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל דבר שמערבין אותו לדבק או כדי ליתן ריח או כדי לצבוע התבשיל הרי זה טפילה אבל אם עירב כדי ליתן טעם בתערובות הרי הוא עיקר לפיכך מיני דבש שמבשלים אותם ונותנים בהם חלב חטה כדי לדבק ועושים מהם מיני מתיקה אינו מברך בורא מיני מזונות מפני שהדבש הוא העיקר.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If one of the ingredients of a mixture with a great amount of honey  is a product of wheat, as wheat starch, to paste, not for the taste, the blessing is not mezonot, but shehakol, because the main ingredient is honey.</p>\n\n<p>202, 2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל אם לא נתן הדגן בתבשיל אלא לדבקו ולהקפותו בטל בתבשיל:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If on of the 5 cereals species is present in the food, but to paste it only, there are anulled by the food regarding the blessing.</p>\n\n<p>In your case, cheese cake, may be that it is the case in some cakes. in apple pie obviously not. So Apple Pie is Mezonot and Cheese Cake is often Shehakol.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tophet, Gehinom and Sheol related to Hell\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Looking at the Jewish view of what 'Hell' is (something spiritual), how are physical places like Sheol, Tophet and Gehinom connected/related to it? </p>\n\n<p>What do their names mean, and how do those meanings reflect what 'Hell' is? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Eruvin 19a lists several names for Hell:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר יהושע בן לוי ז' שמות יש לגיהנם ואלו הן שאול ואבדון ובאר שחת ובור שאון וטיט היון וצלמות וארץ התחתית...ותו לא והאיכא תפתה</p>\n  \n  <p>Says R' Yehoshua ben Levi: There are seven names for <strong>Gehennom</strong>/Hell: <strong>She'ol</strong>, Avdon, Be'er Shachas, Bor Sha'un, Tit HaYavan, Tzalmaves, and Eretz HaTachtis. ... Are there no more? But there is <strong>Tafteh</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to that Gemara, the name \"Gehennom\" comes from \"גיא שעמוקה (בגיהנם) שהכל יורד לה על עסקי (הנם)\" - a deep pit in Hell for those who committed sexual sins (translation follows Rashi). It seems that it could also be related to one of its entrances, discussed earlier in that Gemara, which is between two palm trees in גיא בן הינם, the Valley of Son of Hinnom, a valley in Jerusalem opposite the Jaffa Gate. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/81240/9682\">my answer</a> to another question of yours on the topic for more on how it got that name. </p>\n\n<p>\"She'ol\" is derived from the verse in Jonah 2:3, \"מִבֶּ֧טֶן <strong>שְׁא֛וֹל</strong> שִׁוַּ֖עְתִּי שָׁמַ֥עְתָּ קוֹלִֽי\" - from the belly of <strong>She'ol</strong> I cried out, and You heard my voice.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>\"Tafteh\" is derived from Isaiah 30:33, \"כִּֽי־עָר֤וּךְ מֵֽאֶתְמוּל֙ תָּפְתֶּ֔ה\" - Tafteh was prepared from yesterday. In context it's very obvious this refers to Hell. JPS translates Tafteh in the verse as Topheth, which I assume is where you got Tophet from. The Gemara also explains that the name is related to the word for being persuaded, מתפתה (\"mispaseh\" or \"mitpateh\"), as one who is persuaded by the evil inclination to sin falls into Hell. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/81126/tophet-gehinom-and-sheol-related-to-hell/81128#comment247623_81128\">@DanF was alluding to in the comments</a> (at least, this is how I understood it, hence my reply), the way the Gemara gets this name, and others, out of their respective verses is unclear, and it still doesn't explain <em>why</em> they are called as such. But those questions are for another time. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Deliveries during Pesach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>May one request/accept/open a delivery of something (let's say, an Amazon order, a present from a friend) during Pesach? I'm not talking about during Yom Tov days, and I'm not talking about potential conflict with the laws of Chol Hamoed. I'm talking about the issue that there could be minute amounts of unexpected chometz in the package, which you would then own, and possibly see.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the chances are very low, but, since as I'm pretty sure the punishment for owning chometz is kareis, and this chometz would not have been sold nor nullified, I'm just wondering.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From torah.org:</p>\n\n<p>QUESTION: What should be done if a package containing chametz arrives at one's home or business during Pesach?</p>\n\n<p>DISCUSSION: One who knows - or even suspects - that the package may contain actual chametz, may not assume ownership of the package. If he can refuse to accept the package, he should do so. If he cannot, he should not bring it into his house or yard and should have specific halachic intent not to \"acquire\" the chametz. The package is considered \"ownerless\" - anyone who wants it is free to take it.</p>\n\n<p>If the package was mistakenly brought into the home or business, one must have specific intent not to \"acquire\" it. One may not touch the actual chametz. O.C. 446:10.</p>\n\n<p>If the package comes on Chol ha-Moed, the chametz should be immediately discarded, either by burning it or by flushing it down the toilet. If it comes on Shabbos or Yom Tov, it should be left where it is [The chametz is severe muktzeh and may not be moved for any reason; O.C. 446:1. Some poskim add that it may not even be moved with one's body or foot, even though other types of severe muktzeh may be; L'ehoros Nossan 5:30] and covered with a vessel until it can be discarded.</p>\n\n<p>While most people do not expect to receive packages containing chametz during Pesach, one should be aware of a recent problem that applies to almost everybody. Many packaged items are insulated by packing pellets that protect the contents during transport. In the past, this cushioning was made from polystyrene, but recently, some companies have begun using biodegradable \"peanuts\" which are made from edible corn starch or wheat starch. Those that are made from wheat starch may be halachically considered \"actual chametz\" since they are fit for human consumption. If a package insulated with these \"peanuts\" arrives on Pesach, the halachos stated above may apply. A rav should be consulted.</p>\n\n<p>A more lenient ruling might be based on the arguement that these pellets have been designated as packing material - not food. They have been processed to remove their nutrients and thus lost their \"chametz form\" and may be stored on Pesach; refer to O.C. 442:3 and 9, Mishnah Berurah 15, 41 and 42 and Chazon Ish O.C. 116:8. This is a questionable argument and a rav must be consulted.</p>\n\n<p>While it may not always be easy to differentiate between the different types of packing pellets, there is a definite difference in appearance between the polystyrene and the starch ones. The polystyrene ones come in random shapes while the starch ones look as though they have been extruded through the holes of a machine. Each piece is perfectly cylindrical and is water soluble.</p>\n\n\n",

However, that doesn't seem to be the prevailing opinion. The Aruch HaShulchan and Rav Moshe Feinstein both address the issue of women wearing Tefilin, and neither of them concludes that it's prohibited because of that Targum Yonasan.</p>\n\n<p>At first glance -- and someone please correct me if there are sources otherwise -- <em>asei doche lo saaseh</em> shouldn't apply anyhow as the most it would be for women would be a <em>kiyumis</em>, not a <em>chiyuvis</em> -- a meritorious thing to do, but not an obligation, for a woman to wear tallis or tefilin. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Way back in 1978, I was a student at the Hillel Summer Institute.  Rabbi Joe Pollack, the Hillel director at Boston University, and a Chabad rabbi, was asked this question by a female student.  That summer there were two women who wore tallis and tefillin.  Of tefillin he deferred answering the question as to whether women are allowed to put on tefillin because of the case of Rashi's daughters, whom legend says, wore tefillin. See Baumgarten, Elisheva (2004). Mothers and Children: Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe. Princeton University Press. p. 88. As to whether tefillin are clothing, Devarim 6:8 explicitly says that tefillin are \"ornaments.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Pollack then addressed the tallis issue:  He told one woman that she could wear her tallis -- although he believed there was no requirement for her to do so, and perhaps no reward.  The other woman, however, was forbidden to wear her talls.  Everyone wondered where he was going with that.  He explained:  \"You wear a factory-made tallis, where I assure you that every worker there is weaving it and attaching the tzitzit with the intention that a man would wear it.  Therefore your tallis is a beged ish, and forbidden to be worn by a woman.\"  The other woman, he explained, had made her own tallis, and therefore could wear it without concern.  Presumably he would hold that tallisim that were specifically desingned and made for women could be worn by women and not by men, but at the time, there wasn't yet a big market for tallesim made for women.  That would be changed with the publication of The First Jewish Catalogue.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<h3>Mishna and Gemara in Eruvin</h3>\n<p>A mishna in Eruvin (95a) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who finds phylacteries outside the city on Shabbat, where they are in danger of becoming lost or damaged, brings them in to his house pair by pair by donning them in the manner in which they are typically donned for the mitzva</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara in Eruvin 96ab discusses about the mitsva or not mitsva to wear tefilin on Shabbat, is it a mitsva which change through time. From this question depends an other question about duty, or  option, or prohibition for a women to wear tefilin.</p>\n<p>If tefilin are not a mitsva for women, are they prohibited or authorized to wear tefilin?</p>\n<p>There are several opinions in the sugia. One of them is that women have to wear tefilin and tefilin is not mitsvat asse shehazman gerama. An other opinion is that women are authorized to make mitsvot without duty for them, to wearTefilin for instance.</p>\n<p>Here is a statement from a berayta (96b)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who finds phylacteries brings them in pair by pair, whether the finder is a man or whether she is a woman, and whether the phylacteries are new or whether they are old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This berayta disagrees at least with the opinion that women should be discouraged from mitsvat  tefilin.</p>\n<h3>Tosfot, Raavad, Rif, Rambam, Rashba.</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל באשה לא פליגי - וא\"ת דילמא משום דהוי מלבוש לאיש כדאמר בפרק במה אשה (שבת דף סא.) דתפילין דרך מלבוש עביד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Tosfot asks</em>: Even if tefilin is not a mitsva for women, and women are discouraged from mitsvat tefilin, to wear them as mitsva is discouraged, but why not wear tefilin garment?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וי\"ל דהיינו דוקא לאיש משום דרגיל ללובשן בחול אבל לאשה לא כדאמרי' התם וחלופיהן באיש דמידי דחזי לאיש לא חזי לאשה ומידי דחזי לאשה לא חזי לאיש:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Tosfot answers</em>: Why tefilin are soon as clothes for men? Because men have a mitsvat tefilin in most weakdays. This mitsva generates an habit to see men wearing tefilin. On Shabbat we can say that wearing tefilin for a man remains  a way of dressing. But if there is no mitsva for women but on the contrary this is discouraged, the tefilin are for women as men's clothing.</p>\n<p>The Rashba in chiddushin reports in name of Raavad and Rif stated against the Berayta. Women cannot wear tefilin on Shabbat.If a woman see tefilin on public domain on Shabbat, she cannot take them even as a way of clothing because tefilin are not woman's clothing. So tefilin are  not a clothes for women.</p>\n<p>Rambam (Shabbat 19, 23) also reports the halacha mentioning men only, not women:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What should a man do when he finds tefillin in the public domain on the Sabbath? He should wear them in the ordinary fashion, placing the head tefillin on his head and the arm tefillin on his arm, enter a home and remove them there {despite that Shabbat is not zman tefilin}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rashba himself doesn't agree with this reasoning, but practically ruled as the Rif (and Rambam).</p>\n<h3>Magen Avraham</h3>\n<p>In Magen Avraham, OC 301, sk 54 (regarding the same halacha of a man who finds tefilin on Shabbat), the psak is also that a woman cannot wear Tefilin at Shabbat. But he adds that this shows that tefilin is a greater problem than Beged Ish, because this is a beged generally used without secular utility. And similarly a Talit Gadol. He says that a woman who walk in Public domain with a Talit Metsuyetset is Chayevet Chat'at. {as @Double AA noted in comments, the statement about Talit with tsitsiot is a consequence of habits only. If we assume that women can make as option mitsvot which are men's duty only (opinion of rabbi Yose). But the rule regarding tefilin has additional parameters, see below in note Rama siman 38}</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל אשה אסור' להכניסה ואף על גב דק\"ל דמותר לצאת בשק מפני שהרועים רגילים לצאת בהם מקרי מלבוש לכל אדם שאני נשים שהן עם בפ\"ע (שבת דף ס\"ב) ולכן נ\"ל <strong>שאם יצאה בטלית המצוייצת חייבת חטאת</strong> אבל דבר שהוא מלבוש גמור לאיש מותרת אשה לצאת בו ועיין ביורה דעה סי' קפ\"ב משא\"כ טבעת לא מקרי מלבוש גמור:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>CONCLUSION, it seems from the Magen Avraham that Talit and Tefilin are men's garments (as the Targum Yonatan cited by @Shalom states).</h3>\n<hr />\n<h3>Note:</h3>\n<p>In Shulchan Aruch OC 38, 3, the Rama in name of the Col Bo says that we have to dissuade women from wearing tefilin because they are not accustomed to watch for body hygiene, not because they are exempt only.</p>\n<p>Following the Rama,  women are discouraged from wearing tefilin for the mitsva side of their wearing, so, even as clothes it is prohibited as men's clothing. But that the reason is not because they have no duty.</p>\n<p><strong>Regarding Talit</strong>, the reasoning of the Col Bo is not relevant. If a woman wants to wear a Talit in way to make mitsvat tsitsit, we have not to dissuade her. So talit is not men's clothing, because they are not discouraged from Talit.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, Absolute Value with Mispar Katan? Or AtBash with an AlBam? And so forth.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe I have found your answer. The Tikunei Zohar explains that the concept of reduced value is related to the spiritual world of Yetzirah. On that basis, a <strong>relationship can be established between these four forms of calculation</strong>, the four spiritual realms, and the four letters of God’s name. I found this on [inner.org][1] </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your wording, if matching is \"allowed\", is puzzling if you mean the word literally, as in halachah, for why should you not be able to relate two cognitive ideas, even so much as to say they are irrelevant to each other, so I assume you mean if such matching can teach something, or has been used to teach something by our sages or rabbis. Certainly gematriot don't render halachic conclusions, for that would be absurd. </p>\n\n<p>My answer would be, based on a natural Torah-based perspective, of a simple but observant and learning Jew, that of course such comparisons are permissible, for anything mind-related that Torah provides is fertile ground for further thought.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Since gematria is an alphanumeric system, it is best used within a mathematical framework within which the results associated with the use of gematria must be consistent. The framework must necessarily include axioms from which we develop definitions, lemmas, theorems, and corollaries. Indeed, the Method of Gematria can be precisely defined as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Let V_1 and V_2 be two verses in the Bible. Let N_1 be the total gematria of a set of words in V_1. Let N_2 be the total gematria of a set of words in V_2. It is possible that V_1 and V_2 are contextually or thematically linked if and only if N_1=N_2.</p>\n\n<p>This definition refers to words or expressions in the verses that are contextual or thematic. By Collins English Dictionary, the context of a word, sentence, or text consists of the words, sentences, or text before and after it which help to make its meaning clear. So once the Method of the Gematria establishes the association (N_1=N_2) between the two verses, V_1 and V_2, then several verses before and after them may need to be consulted for a better understanding of the association. Also, by the same dictionary, in linguistics, the adjective thematic denotes a word that is the theme of a sentence. In grammar, it is of or relating to the stem or root of a word. Very often, there is a need to consult Strong’s Concordance and the Hebrew and Greek lexicons to fully understand the association between words that are thematic in the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>I am happy to expound further.</p>\n\n\n",

This is a fact. There are people who die for such reasons.</p>\n\n<p>So now we have this jew who was supposed to be an atheist and happy about it, who moved to a building where an utterly alone sickly old blind man lived next door. The good hearted jew engaged happily in helping out the old man and they eventually buddied up. Every saturday afternoon the jew would come to the old man's flat, bring some food, put the kettle on, put the telly on and they would watch the afternoon film together. At last after years the old blind man had someone to tell him what's going on on the telly. These saturday afternoons became the old man's delight! One day the jew even agreed to accompany the old man every sunday morning to the temple of idolworshipping and sit by the side of the old man watching the priests and the congregation drooling over their idols. At last after years the old blind man had someone to take him by the hand through the streets. These sunday mornings became the old man's delight! Then suddenly one day the was-supposed-to-be-a-happy-atheist-forever jew felt a click in his head and he found his whole life out of place and decided to put things back in order. There will be no more visits to the temple of idolworshipping. Sorry, old man. And as for saturday afternoons... could we make it sunday afternoon instead? This is what the jew told the old man one day, though he knew the old man would take it very badly. The next day the old man jumped out from his window and expired on the pavement. Now, the old man was doing as fine as he could before the jew came along. It was the good hearted atheist jew who offered support and company.</p>\n\n<p>The question is did the jew commit oblique murder? Should have the jew kept violating a whole range of commandments in order to save the old man from the inevitable suicide? Is this a case of pikuach nefesh?</p>\n\n<p>In short: there was a time when this jew wasn't observant and actively created around him a ring of dependence, people who depend on him. This ring he can't keep if he's to become fully observant neither he can destroy it without destroying a life, really, physical death involved.</p>\n\n<p>This is not hypothetical, it happens all the time, either with old people or with other circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, old people really sometimes jump out of windows for such petty things as their cats gone missing. And there's no free will involved or need for psychiatrists.

There is no reason to suspect this would not be allowed according to halacha anymore than removing another inconsequential article of clothing like a pair of gloves or a hat.

In fact just as during the generation of the baal shem tov who brought back many from the brink of despair which was a result of the terrible persecution, religious despair from false messiahs, and isolation from the Jewish community today chabad continues this mission uplifting the souls of Jewish people everywhere from the isolation of galus for those who are tinuk shenishba as well as every segment of Jewry because of the importance of loving one's fellow Jew.</p>\n\n<p>The source and reason for doing so is learned from when Hashem tells Moshe Rabenu to remove his shoes because he is standing on holy ground and from when after Yehoshua has the Jewish people circumcised and speaks to an angel he is told to remove his shoes.

He's referring to meat and milk issues, i.e. whether a dairy-look pareve food can be served with meat. Likely, then, the same would apply to the question of whether a meat-and-milk-look product can be served at all, and perhaps also to the question of whether a non-kosher-species-look product can be served at all.

Michel Shurkin reports the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...I ask whether Reb Moshe was supportive of the trend towards being\n  machmir even if there was a mesorah otherwise. Rav Michel answers with\n  a story, of course.  “During the 1970s, Kissinger sold a lot of wheat\n  the US had stockpiled to Russia. The reason people aren’t so careful\n  about eating chadash is based on a sfek-sfeikah [double doubt]\n  recorded by the Rema, which relies on uncertainty that the grain is\n  chadash. HaGaon HaRav Meiselman (Rosh Yeshivah of Toras Moshe) came to\n  Reb Moshe with statistics proving that the grain in the US after they\n  sold their stockpiles was certainly chadash. Reb Moshe was not\n  impressed. ‘In Lithuania we ate grain that was certainly chadash,’ he\n  said. After about an hour of discussion, Reb Moshe finally said,\n  ‘Efsher iz es a sheineh minhag – maybe it’s a nice custom.’ But that’s\n  as far as he would go, because, whether stringent or lenient, mesorah\n  was mesorah.” In a similar vein, Reb Moshe was certain that a\n  community in Klal Yisrael couldn’t be guilty of doing something wrong\n  en masse. “I recently heard that a gadol ruled a certain way,” says\n  Rav Michel, “and someone asked, ‘But doesn’t everyone do the\n  opposite?” The gadol replied, “There’s plenty of room in Gehinnom.”\n  “Reb Moshe held there was no way that the entire public would go to\n  Gehinnom. There must be a reason why what they were doing was\n  permissible, and he would find that reason. He held that just as you\n  have to have emunah in Hashem, you have to have emunah in Klal\n  Yisrael.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Is it mutar to send a letter to any deceased Rebbe (specifically the Lubavitcher Rebbe), or is this similar to Avodah Zarah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1600&pgnum=403\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Minchas Yitzchak</a> 8:53) was asked if one is allowed to write one's name and leave the paper on the grave of a Tzaddik (The Chasam Sofer, in that case).</p>\n\n<p>He wrote that Bach and the Maharil forbid asking from the dead, but the Sefer Chassidim and the Zohar seem to permit, and the Maharam Shik is left undecided.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, he says that the same logic which permits asking a Tzaddik to pray for one (while alive) would apply after death - that all the Jews are one entity, and Haashem wouldn't want a Tzaddik to suffer from another person's pain. So since a Tzaddik feels another person's pain after (the Tzaddik's) death, he can remove suffering.</p>\n\n<p>So the Maharam Shik says that since opinions allow, and others forbid, one should rather do \"nothing\" and not go.</p>\n\n<p>But the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1859&pgnum=172\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Minchas Elazar</a> (1:68) argues, and says that it's a Mitzvah to pray by a Tzaddik's grave.</p>\n\n<p>He quotes a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/81174/732\">few Gemaras</a> which mention that the Tanayim and Amoraim (as well as the Arizal and his students) would talk to dead people by their graves, which would imply that it's permitted.</p>\n\n<p>He says that \"Doresh El HaMeisim\" is only when one goes to live in a cemetery and wants their \"spirit of impurity\" to rest on him.</p>\n\n<p>However, if one wants their \"spirit of purity\", or to inform them of his pain, it's permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, he says that it's unlikely that the Maharil would argue on all those Gemaras. Rather, the Maharil must hold that one shouldn't pray <strong>to</strong> the Tzaddik (like the famous debate about whether it's permitted to say Machnisei Rachamim). However, as \"we\" hold that one can say Machnisei Rachamim, all the more so can one pray to a Tzaddik.</p>\n\n<p>And since there's no sin, one should go and meditate on one's day of death and have the righteous pray on one's behalf. </p>\n\n<p>So the Minchas Yitzchak wrote that if one is allowed to ask of departed Tzaddikim, one is allowed to write them Kvitlach.</p>\n\n<p>But he says that there were Poskim (such as the Satmar Rov) who were against going to graves, and only big Tzaddikim should go.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, he said that both sides have a point.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Torah forbids various superstitious and idolatrous activities including \"doresh el hametim\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְחֹבֵר, חָבֶר; וְשֹׁאֵל אוֹב וְיִדְּעֹנִי, וְדֹרֵשׁ אֶל-הַמֵּתִים</p>\n  \n  <p>or a charmer, or one that consulteth a ghost or a familiar spirit, or a consulter of the dead. (Deut. 18:11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If one intends for the Rebbe to respond with a message,  <a href=\"http://www.shturem.net/index.php?section=news&id=29039\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">such as the practice of flipping through a book, and hoping that the dead will guide one's hand</a>, that would perhaps violate this according to Rambam's definition of it in Hilkhot Avodah Zarah (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1411.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">11:14</a>). See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/81173/8775\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If the fax is a request that the Rebbe assist you, or even that he ask God to help you, that would likely be forbidden as well. Indeed, regarding beseeching the dead, even that they act as intermediaries, this would likely be forbidden (possibly severely). Rambam writes in Hilkhot Evel (4:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא יפנה אדם לבקר הקברות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are different textual variants of this line and different explanations of them, but R. Qafih explains that Rambam holds that one should not even go to a cemetery, lest one come to beseech the dead. Similarly, see Nefesh HaRav p. 254 that the Rav's family custom was to avoid graveyards to avoid the appearance of doresh el hametim.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, R. Moshe Tzuriel notes <a href=\"http://www.hidush.co.il/hidush.asp?id=1813\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3904.htm#17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Ta'aniyot 4:17</a>) emphasises that prayers in a graveyard are not meant to be directed to the dead. In this, Rambam rules like Rabbi Levi Bar Hamma, in Ta'anit 16a against a contrary opinion recorded there. R. Tzuriel (there) is of the opinion that those who were accustomed to pray in various forms to the dead are following the contrary view in Ta'anit, but that halakha is not in accordance with that view.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Maharam Shikk writes in a responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_1494_206.pdf#toolbar=1&navpanes=0&statusbar=0&view=FitH\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 293</a>) that such practices raise both the issue of dresh el hametim, and of serving God through an intermediary (apparently the prohibition of avoda zara). He concludes that if one relates one's problems to the dead hoping that they will intercede with God it is permissible, but if one wants help from them directly, it would be forbidden. He emphasises that even using them as intermediaries is forbidden according to many authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Ben Ish Hai writes in a responsum (Rav P'alim Vol II YD 31) that it is forbidden to make requests of a dead person directly. Doing so constitutes doresh el hametim. One may only ask that the dead intercede with God. He writes this in explanation of the Zohar (Acharei Mot: 71) which is quoted by some as a source to permit praying to the dead:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נמצא לא הותר לאדם להתפלל על קברי הצדיקים, לשאול בקשתו מן הצדיקים עצמן, כי זה חשיב דורש אל המתים, אלא הוא מתפלל ושואל בקשתו מהקב\"ה, ורק מבקש מנפש הצדיק שתתפלל עליו לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא, שישמע תפלתו ויעשה בקשתו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Others, take an even harsher stance. The Bach (YD 217:51) implies that prayer in a cemetery can only be permitted if it is addressed to God; not the dead. (although he cites views that even this would be prohibited, see there for more):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודוקא להשתטח על קברי אבות ולהתפלל לפניו יתברך </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Hokhmat Adam (Issur V'heter 89:7) writes negatively about people who discuss their problems with the dead:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ז איסור דורש אל המתים זה שמרעיב עצמו ולן בבית הקברות כדי שתשרה עליו רוח הטומאה (סימן קע\"ט סעיף י\"ג) <strong>ואותן נשים וכן עמי הארצות שהולכין על קברי מתים וכאילו מדברים עם המתים ואומרים להם צרותיהם קרוב הדבר שהם בכלל זה</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>And [regarding] those women and ignoramuses who go to graves and speak as though to the dead and tell them their woes, and it seems likely that they are included in this prohibition.[i] (My translation of the bolded portion)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Schick\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharam Shikk</a> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_1494_206.pdf#toolbar=1&navpanes=0&statusbar=0&view=FitH\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">understands</a> that he is saying that it is doresh el hametim.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_ben_Isaac_ha-Levi_Minz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharam Mintz</a> (Responsa:79) similarly cites the opinion that making requests of the dead; even just that they intercede with God is forbidden as doresh el hametim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי בלאו הכי יש גדולים קראו תגר ע\"ד זה וקראו ודורש אל המתים, דרוב עמי הארץ ונשים עבידי מליצים בינם ובין קונם ב\"ה. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Minhagei Maharil (Hilkhot Ta'anit 18), quoted by the Elya Rabba (581), Ba'er Hetev (OH 581:17), and the Mishna Berurah (581:27) similarly writes that one shouldn't address the dead at all:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והמשתטח על קברי הצדיקים ומתפלל אל ישים מגמתו נגד המתים השוכבים שם, אך יבקש מאת השם יתברך שיתן אליו רחמים בזכות הצדיקים שוכני עפ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, one mustn't address the dead or even pay attention to them, but only address God.</p>\n\n<p>The Hayei Adam (138:5), and Kitzur (128:13) paraphrase the Maharil and add that addressing the dead directly would seem to violate doresh el hametim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויעשה הקדוש ברוך בו חסד בזכות הצדיקים אבל אל ישים מגמתו נגד המתים השוכנים שם, כי קרוב הדבר שיהיה בכלל ודורש אל המתים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i]   At face value this seems quite strange, since this seems quite different from the classical descriptions, and indeed his own description of doresh el hemetim. Perhaps he means that it is similarly forbidden, but for a different reason; i.e. avodah zara, although this is admittedly difficult to read into his words.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes, it is permissible and is in fact an ancient custom extending all the way back to Calev separating from the spies when they entered the land of Israel to stop at the graves of the Avot to pray that they seek mercy from G-d on his behalf because of their intentions. <strong><em>The written petition serves the same function as saying the words aloud as both are putting the words of ones prayer into an action.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.34b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sota 34b</a> \"Rava said: this teaches that Calev disassociated from the plans of the spies and went and protrated himself at the graves of the forefathers.He said to them my fathers, ask for mercy upon me, that I may be saved from the plans of the spies\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אמר רבא</strong> מלמד <strong>שפירש כלב</strong> מעצת מרגלים <strong>והלך ונשתטח על קברי אבות אמר להן אבותי בקשו עלי רחמים שאנצל מעצת מרגלים</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Tosaphot to this quote from Sotah emphasizes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבותי בקשו עלי רחמים - <strong>וא\"ת והאמר בפרק מי שמתו (ברכות דף יח.)</strong> דמיתי לא ידעין מידי ומשמע במסקנא. ואפילו אבות העולם <strong>יש לומר דעל ידי תפלה שזה מתפלל מודיעין להן</strong> שכך נתפלל <strong>והכי אמר בפרק שני דתענית (דף טז.) למה יוצאין לבית הקברות כדי שיבקשו עליהם מתים רחמים</strong> וכן בפרקי דחסידים בעובדא דרבי מנא דאשתטח אמערתא דאבוה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.16a.7?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 16a</a> \"Why do we go out to the cemetery?

I took my kallah classes from a Chabad rebbetzin and was shocked and bothered when told I must think of the Rebbe during what they refer to as  \"the Mitzvah\".  She said specifically it must happen towards the end of intercourse right before you know your husband is going to be \"done\" so to speak.  I was troubled because in my mind it seemed wrong to think of anyone besides my husband during such an intimate and private moment. I was told that also a kallah must cover her hair with at least a snood during \"the mitzvah\" and it must be completely dark as well.  She also taught that one is required to think of the rebbe while under the chuppah and while at the mikvah.  I am not Chabad so I have chosen not to keep this custom.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>the source that it is forbidden to think about other people during relations is from the gemorah<br>\nsee \n <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.20b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.20b.2?lang=bi</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.20b.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.20b.7?lang=bi</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.20b.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.20b.9?lang=bi</a><br>\nand even what the woman thinks is a problem \nsee <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.112a.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.112a.14?lang=bi</a></p>\n\n<p>but also in the gemara it also says <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.20a.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.20a.7?lang=bi</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Similarly, the Gemara relates that Rabbi Yoḥanan was accustomed to go and sit at the gates of the women’s immersion sites.

The question is can I accept compensation for this recitation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have not located an outright prohibition against paying someone to say Kaddish for you. However, according Rabbi Maurice Lamm, as cited, <a href=\"http://www.mazornet.com/deathandmourning/OrthodoxKaddish2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> actually refutes the Maharik's statement that this is meaningful!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Paying for Kaddish to be recited by a stranger is meaningless\n  according to Maurice Lamm’s The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning\n  (Jonathan David, 1969).</p>\n  \n  <p>Kaddish is more than an incantation said to add bonus points to a\n  soul. It is way for sons to show the holy impact of a parent’s life.\n  To get rid of a Kaddish obligation by writing a check is a hollow\n  effort. A stranger’s Kaddish robs the surviving children of the\n  comfort brought by a mourner’s year of Kaddish recitation. </p>\n  \n  <p>Lamm explains that is better to reach the goals of Kaddish through\n  other means. Bring merit to a loved one’s soul by studying Torah. Read\n  a portion of the Bible: the Chumash, a section from the Five Books of\n  Moses, a chapter from the prophets. Study a Mishna, which speaks of\n  the Torah’s laws and ethics (The word “Mishna” has the same letters as\n  “neshama” - soul.) Commit to learning a daf, a page, of Gemarah each\n  day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having cited this, though, I know that there are numerous organizations that suggest hiring someone to say Kaddish for you. One of them, saykaddish.com seems to be run by Chaba\"d. See <a href=\"http://tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/73355/pay-to-pray.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>. The rabbi does state that it is not in the spirit of halacha, but he also says that there is no prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>In merging the 2nd article with the first, perhaps one might argue that since the money goes towards tzedaka, which is meritorious for the memory of the dead soul, this might lessen the concern of doing this. However, in my opinion and based on my deduction from both articles, it is certainly preferable for relatives to say Kaddish themselves. Ideally, it should be sons, then daughters, then brothers / sisters or any close relative rather than a stranger. In short, make an effort to both learn and actually say the Kaddish rather than seeking the \"easy way out\" and hiring a stranger.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Eli <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/displayRead.asp?readID=2755\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mansour</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Russia-New York, 1895-1986), in his Iggerot\n  Moshe (Yoreh De’a 254), writes that the person must recite at least\n  one Kaddish per person per day, and he must explicitly notify all\n  those paying him that this is the arrangement. Hacham Ovadia Yosef,\n  however, in Yabia Omer (vol. 8, Yoreh De’a, Siman 37), rules that we\n  may apply to this case the concept of “Zikaron Ehad Oleh Le’kan\n  U’le’kan,” such that one recitation of Kaddish can count for multiple\n  people. Hence, one may receive payment from several individuals to\n  recite Kaddish on behalf of their deceased family members, as his\n  Kaddish recitation can indeed apply simultaneously to several\n  different people. This ruling is codified by Rav Shemuel Pinhasi in\n  his work Haim Va’hesed, where he notes that this was also the position\n  of the Sedeh Hemed (Abelut, 154) and the Sitz Eliezer (7:49).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

So could the ark that Moshe constructed be the ark that went first before the people and the ark that Bezaleel constructed be the one that was in the tabernacle?

This was not the ark that Bezalel made, because the Israelites did not occupy themselves with the Mishkan until after Yom Kippur [which was forty days later], for when Moses descended the mountain, he commanded them regarding the construction of the Mishkan . [Then] Bezalel made the Mishkan first, and only afterwards the ark and the [other] furnishings (Ber. 55a). It follows, therefore, that this was another ark, and that was the one that went out with them to battle, but the one Bezalel made did not go out to battle except in the days of Eli, and they were punished for it, and it [the ark] was captured [by the Philistines]. — [Yerushalmi Shekalim 6:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi also writes concerning Bamidbar 10:33 that this was also the one that went before the Bnei Yisrael when they traveled.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The Ark of the Lord’s covenant traveled three days ahead of them:</strong> This was the Ark that accompanied them in battle.

The\n  length of its foundation is about two miles, the breadth of the tower\n  is about forty cubits, and the length thereof two hundred cubits. At\n  every ten cubits' distance there are slopes which go round the tower\n  by which one can ascend to the top. One can see from there a view\n  twenty miles in extent, as the land is level.

A spiral passage, built into the tower (in stages\n  of ten yards each), leads up to the summit, from which we have a\n  prospect of twenty miles, the country being one wide plain and quite\n  level.

The dry nitrous earth of the parched plain, driven\n  before the furious south wind, has thrown over the huge mass a thin\n  covering of soil in which no herb or green thing can find nourishment\n  or take root. It rises to the height of 153 feet, and has on its\n  summit a compact mass of brickwork, 37 feet high by 28 broad. Neither\n  the original form nor object of the edifice, of which it is the ruin,\n  had, previous to my visit, been determined. On one side of it, beneath\n  the crowning masonry, lie huge fragments torn from the pile itself.\n  The calcined and vitreous surface of the bricks fused into rock-like\n  masses, show that their fall may have been caused by lightning; and,\n  as the ruin is rent almost from top to bottom, early Christian\n  travellers, as well as some of more recent date, have not hesitated to\n  recognise in them proofs of that divine vengeance, which, according to\n  tradition, arrested by fire from heaven the impious attempt of the\n  first descendants of Noah. Even the Jews, it would appear, at one time\n  identified the Birs Nimroud with the Tower of Babel. Benjamin of\n  Tudela, who saw it in the twelfth century, gives the following curious\n  account of the ruin. 'The tower built by the dispersed generation is\n  four miles from Hillah. It is constructed of bricks, called Al-ajur\n  (the word still used by the Arabs for kiln-burnt bricks); the base\n  measures two miles, the breadth 240 yards, and the height about 100\n  canna. A spiral passage, built into the tower (from ten to ten yards),\n  leads up to the summit, from which there is a prospect of twenty\n  miles, the country being one wide plain, and quite level.

Assuming a person walks 40km a day (Pesachim 93b thanks DonielF 1 mil is 2000 amos 1 amoh is about 50cm so 1km is 1 mil)and can travel about 600 days over 2 years (excluding shabbos Yomtov where there are techumim) the total perimeter would be around 24000 km. the Asian continent perimeter is 57,674 km so this is a significant chunk of Asia as a base.

It seems imprecise and also introduces a lot of extra bother into the entire process!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The eyewitness testimony is a lot discussed in the Hassidic literature. As far as I understood, Rabbi Levy Ytsh'ak miBerditchov in his Kedoushat Levy part <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kedushat_Levi%2C_The_Rules_of_Festivals?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rules of festivals</a> explains that what you have called \"imprecise\" and \"extra bother\" are actually the beauty of the whole process. In the text the Rabbi quotes several strange anecdotes from the Talmud (Rosh Hachanna 20.b, 24,b) where some Rabbis asking the moon to hide or to appear for the sake and the need of the Clall Ysrael</p>\n<p>To better feel this, I quote another teaching of the Kedushat Levy in his commentary on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kedushat_Levi%2C_Leviticus%2C_Shir_HaShirim.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chir Hachirim</a>. He explains how Go-d \"accomplishes\" our wishes, and in particular, on the time dimension : everything linked to the calendar : start of a new month, date of festivals (such as Kippour, Pessah etc). According to an explanation of Rabbi Yehoshoua Leyfer, the Kedouchat Levy refers to Talmud <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.24a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanna 24.a</a> and even to a more explicit <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.15.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Chemot Rabba</a> 15,2 from which I translate here the relevant parts :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ministering angels asked to Hakadosh Baroukh Hou : \"Master of the world, when will you fix the festivals ?\" [...] He said to them \"I will consent to what Israel will decide [...] From now on, I convey to them the task to fix new moon. If they say yes, yes it will be. If they say no, no it will be.[...] Not only that, if they ask to add a month in a year [Adar-2] I will be okay with that\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to these quotes we can understand that it all depends on us because it is <em>according to us</em>, according to what the Sanhedrin will decide based on their Roua'h Hakodesh and the need of the whole people. Now, the impreciseness can be seen as an extraordinary flexibility of the time and the festival datetime in particular. Hachem wants to do <em>according to us</em>. Nowadays we have everything calculated by very deep and old calculus because the Sanhedrin doesn't exist anymore and the Beith Hamikdash is not standing yet.</p>\n<p>We can add a difference between Shabbat and Festivals : Shabbat has been fixed according to 6 (human) days whereas Festivals are fixed according to human testimony. Shabbat is not flexible, it transcends humanity although it is fixed in our reality. Shabbat is <em>absolute</em> Festivals are relatives.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>About the important of the eye in itself :</p>\n<p>The Tikouney Zohar 18 links the pupil of the eye (what catches information) with the Chekhina (Malkhout) and the Zohar part 1 238.a links the moon with the Malkhout. The Likkoutey Moharan I-13,4 explains the concept of vision as an interaction between the one who looks at the object and the object that is looked at. The visible is not necessarily seen. But when the eye interacts with the visible then we see it we grasp it and can infer properties, qualities and so on.</p>\n<p>The meaning in our subject can be (it is my own conclusion) : since the Sanhedrin ask to the moon to be visible or not according to what the people need, they in fact impose a \"new\" spiritual reality that is materialized by the <em>eye</em>witnessing. Imagine adding a month of Adar-2 will postponed everything after it including Passover, even Yom Kippur, and all the mystical content. (It reminds me a lot of Quantum Physics).</p>\n<p>And we can see it in the prayer of the new month we ask for a new start, for the end of our oppression, for all what we need (food, parnassa, success etc). The prayer that the Great Assembly composed reflect the idea of a new start on Rosh Hodesh, of a new reality.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'd like to quote Rabbi Ari Storch, discussed at length <a href=\"http://astrotorah.weeklyshtikle.com/2011/09/great-rabbinic-cover-up.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://astrotorah.weeklyshtikle.com/2009/08/superhuman-sight.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, which posits that, indeed, the witnesses were completely unnecessary for Kiddush HaChodesh, and were there only for ceremonial purposes. In these articles, he gets into the opinions of Rishonim, Geonim, and even Tannaim on the topic. For the purposes of this space, I will only focus on the main opinion, and the curious reader can view the links above for some fascinating applications of this principle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bacheye cites from Rabbeinu Chananel that the highest beis din was charged with determining Rosh Chodesh, the new month. Rabbeinu Chananel states that those who maintain that it was necessary to have witnesses sight the new moon and testify before the court are mistaken. The court would determine the time of the new moon and based on their calculations sancitfy the months. The information contained in Maseches Rosh Hashana about witnesses is only because witnesses were used only for ceremonial purposes because of an event that had occurred at one point in time. However, the biblical commandment to sanctify the months has nothing to do with witnesses. (Rabbeinu Bacheye Shemos 12:2) In addition to not needing witnesses, the beis din is authorized to make Rosh Chodesh on a day other than the date of the new moon if it is necessary. Additionally, if they sanctified a day erroneously the sanctification is still valid. (Rosh Hashana 25a)</p>\n<p>The above certainly is how Rabbeinu Bacheye cites Rabbeinu Chananel. It is of note that the Rambam emphatically rejected this opinion and felt that even Rabbeinu Chananel himself was not serious when he suggested it. (See Rambam Peirush Hamishnayos Rosh Hashana 2) Nevertheless, many Rishonim followed in the footsteps of that which Rabbeinu Chananel actually stated and there are indications that this was Rav Saadiah Gaon's opinion, as well. (See Torah Sheleimah Miluim Parshas Bo)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/81203#comment248022_81203\">H/t to Isaac Moses</a> for directing me to Rav Hirsch on Shemos 12:2. There he writes very similarly to this opinion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From this mitzvah of קידוש החדש כל פי הראיה – i.e., determining the beginning of the month by the actual sighting of the recurring new light – those who never tire of disparaging the Jewish past in the eyes of the present generation have drawn an absurd conclusion: Originally, they say, the Jews lacked astronomical knowledge of the lunar cycle. Only centuries later did they learn from the Greeks the necessary methods of computation. Until that time, they had to content themselves with the crude makeshift practice of waiting each month for the reappearance of the moon.</p>\n<p>We have called this argument an absurdity because it is obvious that no calendric system can be based solely on the sighting of the new moon. In a cloudy period, weeks can pass without proper visibility. Moreover, the very expectation of sighting the moon assumes a prior calculation of its probability. Indeed, from the תורה שבעל פה we learn that the determination of New Moons was based on calculating the moment in which the moon was to reappear. The results of this calculation served as a check on the testimony of the witnesses. What is more, if no witnesses appeared on the thirtieth of the month, the thirty-first became the first of the next month, even without the new moon having been sighted (see [<em>Rosh Hashanah</em>] 22ff.).</p>\n<p>David could say to Yonasan: הנה חדש מחר [behold, the new moon is tomorrow] (<em>Shemuel</em> I, 20:5); thus, he knew beforehand that the morrow would be the first of the month. Moreover, from ויהי ממחרת החדש השני (ibid. 20:27) it is clear that, already in Sha'ul's time, they celebrated, as in our own time, two days of ראש חדש – an institution that is based on the calculation of the lunar cycle and the alternation of the months, מלא [thirty-day months] and חסר [twenty-nine-day months].</p>\n<p>The word השני (ibid.) cannot mean the second day of the month, for the whole arrangement between them depended on the fact that, in honor of ראש חדש, the king would hold a banquet at which all the members of his court were expected to appear. Clearly, then, השני means the second day of the New Moon, as <em>Targum Yonasan</em> translates it: והוה ביומא דבתרוהי דהוא עבור ירחא תנינא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>I'm actually struggling to find a Rishon who holds as you say, that the calculations are irrelevant. The Rambam writes (Hil. Kiddush HaChodesh 1:6) that the calculations are there to determine the validity of witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֵּית דִּין מְחַשְּׁבִין בְּחֶשְׁבּוֹנוֹת כְּדֶרֶךְ שֶׁמְּחַשְּׁבִים הָאִיצְטַגְנִינִים שֶׁיּוֹדְעִין מְקוֹמוֹת הַכּוֹכָבִים וּמַהֲלָכָם וְחוֹקְרִים וּמְדַקְדְּקִים עַד שֶׁיֵּדְעוּ אִם אֶפְשָׁר שֶׁיֵּרָאֶה הַיָּרֵחַ בִּזְמַנּוֹ שֶׁהוּא לֵיל שְׁלֹשִׁים אוֹ אִי אֶפְשָׁר. אִם יָדְעוּ שֶׁאֶפְשָׁר שֶׁיֵּרָאֶה יוֹשְׁבִין וּמְצַפִּין לָעֵדִים כָּל הַיּוֹם כֻּלּוֹ שֶׁהוּא יוֹם שְׁלֹשִׁים. אִם בָּאוּ עֵדִים וּדְרָשׁוּם וַחֲקָרוּם כַּהֲלָכָה וְנֶאֶמְנוּ דִּבְרֵיהֶם מְקַדְּשִׁין אוֹתוֹ. וְאִם לֹא נִרְאָה וְלֹא בָּאוּ עֵדִים מַשְׁלִימִין שְׁלֹשִׁים וְיִהְיֶה חֹדֶשׁ מְעֵבָּר. וְאִם יָדְעוּ בְּחֶשְׁבּוֹן שֶׁאִי אֶפְשָׁר שֶׁיֵּרָאֶה אֵין יוֹשְׁבִים יוֹם שְׁלֹשִׁים וְאֵין מְצַפִּין לָעֵדִים. וְאִם בָּאוּ עֵדִים יוֹדְעִין בְּוַדַּאי שֶׁהֵן עֵדֵי שֶׁקֶר אוֹ שֶׁנִּרְאֵית לָהֶם דְּמוּת לְבָנָה מִן הֶעָבִים וְאֵינָהּ הַלְּבָנָה הַוַּדָּאִית:</p>\n<p>The court calculates, in the manner which astrologers calculate that they know the places of the stars and their paths, and they probe until they know if it's possible that the moon can be seen in its time, which is the thirtieth night, or if it's impossible.

The discussion there is about divvying out the Avoda Zara material from the estate to the other heirs in exchange for neutral materials from the estate (which is ordinarily considered benefiting from Avoda Zara). The Talmud rules that in this instance it is ok to do that, so long as the Avoda Zara hasn't already come into the convert's domain. Tosfot there explains this is due to the rabbinic enactment not applying to forbidden objects. In other words, the rabbinic enactment allows a convert to inherit, but only objects that he is allowed to have.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, even if the gentile father who owns the Chametz would die over Pesach, the convert wouldn't acquire the Chametz unless he goes and physically takes it.

May he sell or give away the items to a non-Jew (to avoid waste in the case of food), or does he need to destroy them?  Must he do so immediately, or do we say that once he's the owner of forbidden items anyway, there is no further damage if he still owns them tomorrow?</p>\n\n<p>One example of forbidden ownership is <em>chameitz</em> during Pesach, but it appears we do not need to be concerned about this case because the original owner ceased to own it when Pesach started, per Pesachim 6b (h/t DoubleAA), so it probably can't be inherited.  Other examples would be items used for idolatry and untithed fruit.  Some comments suggest following the example of the <em>mishnayot</em> in Demai chapter 6, and I'd welcome an answer that explains how to do that (and supports it as an appropriate precedent).

In 1277 Nathan HaMe’ati translated the Rambam’s medical work Pirkei Moshe (Aphorisms of Moses) from Arabic into Hebrew. In the section detailing the medicinal effects of the banana (20:88), Nathan HaMe’ati calls it the “apple of Eden.” The sixteenth-century Rabbi Menachem de Lonzano, in his Ma’arich, a work explaining foreign words in rabbinic literature, says the banana is a well-known fruit in Syria and Egypt that the Arabs call “the apple of Gan Eden.” Today, some bananas are known by the Latin names Musa paradisiaca (fruit of paradise) and Musa sapientum (fruit of knowledge). Identifying the Tree of Knowledge with the banana appears to be a Christian tradition from at least the twelfth century that enjoyed popularity but was never adopted by rabbinic sources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"https://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php?id=7919&pt=30&pid=7717&level=2&cPath=7702,7717,7919\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ari Z.

There are 6 other possibilities which includes grapes, figs, barley, an esrog, wheat, or unknown.</p>\n\n<p>The unknown position reasoning is the fruit was never revealed so as not to dimish it in the eyes of people. According to this view it is possible that it could be any type of produce or plant, however, this gives us no reason to suspect any one specific fruit such as a banana and isn't proof that it could be either.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Will we be obligated to bring many chatats when the temple is rebuilt?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When the Temple is rebuilt will we each have to bring chatats (\"sin\" offerings) as necessary based on different sins we have done (which would likely amount to quite a lot of korbanot for a lot of people) or is there some sort of process to \"start over\" and begin like new, bringing chatats only for new sins?</p>\n\n<p>Is there perhaps some discussion of what happened with regards to this when the 2nd Temple was built?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As Scimonster mentioned the Gemara in Shabbos appears to address this. \"קרא והטה וכתב על פנקסו אני ישמעאל בן אלישע קריתי והטיתי נר בשבת לכשיבנה בהמ\"ק אביא חטאת שמנה\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.12b.5?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 12b</a>) </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yishmael would write down that he needs to bring a chatat when the Temple is rebuilt. This gemara seems to imply that in fact we will need to bring a chatat for each sin we commit. Additionally, there is a gemara in Yoma (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.80a?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 80a</a>) and a Yerushalmi Chagiga (1:2) that require you to keep track of the size of forbidden foods you ate, seemingly for the purpose of knowing if you need to bring a korban when the temple is rebuilt.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/9747\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiferet Shlomo</a> (Moadim: Shabbos, <em>dibbur hamatchil</em> ואת מוסף) cites the gemara in Shabbos and even goes further and says that we will bring <em>every</em> obligatory sacrafice that we did not bring during exile, including daily-offerings (temidim).</p>\n\n<p>There are others that share his view, as brought down in Daf al HaDaf (quoted below). One notable example appears to be the Magen Avrahom, who quotes the gemara in a halachic context in his commentary on the Shulchan Aruch (Siman 334 Seif 33).</p>\n\n<p>However, the Lubavitcher Rebbe felt that we will not need to bring the korbanot we missed, and likewise sees no requirement to record the sins we have done (Shulchan Menachem page קכא, quoting Likutei Sichot חי״ח page 416).</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chatas-offering-in-future-for-the-accidental-sins-he-performed-during-galus/?hilite=chatas#ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chatas-offering-in-future-for-the-accidental-sins-he-performed-during-galus/?hilite=chatas#ftn1</a> for a discussion of some of the above sources.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דף על הדף שבת דף יב עמוד ב\n  כתב בתפארת שלמה מועדים עניני שבת (ד' כח ד\"ה ואת מוסף וכו'): \"לעתיד נשלים ונקריב את כל הקרבנות של חובה שחסרנו מהם בזמן הגלות, הנה אז נקריב כל התמידין והמוספין שהיינו מחוייבים בהם כל ימי הגלות, וכן כל קרבנות היחיד של חובה, וכמש\"כ ר' ישמעאל (שבת י\"ב, ב): לכשיבנה בהמ\"ק אביא חטאת שמינה, וכמ\"ש הכתוב 'ושלמתי לכם את השנים אשר אכל הארבה' וכו'. וזה שאנו אומרים כי את מוסף יום השבת הזה והחג הזה נקריב בבנין בהמ\"ק במהרה בימינו אמן\". עכ\"ד.</p>\n  \n  <p>וראה גם בבני יששכר (מאמרי ר\"ח - מאמר ב) שהביא בשם הרמ\"ע מפאנו ז\"ל, שלעתיד לבוא נצטרך להקריב את כל הקרבנות שחסרנו כל ימי גלותינו ע\"ש, וביאר בזה הפסוקים שאומרים במוסף שבת ור\"ח וכדברי התפארת שלמה הנ\"ל ע\"ש.</p>\n  \n  <p>כתב בספר מטעמי יעקב (פר' ויקרא): עיין שו\"ת לב חיים להגאון ר' חיים פלאג'י זצ\"ל או\"ח (סימן כ\"ט) דמסיק דהגם דכל הלומד פרשת עולה הוי כאילו הקריב קרבן עולה, אבל אחד דעבר עבירה עכשיו ולמד הפרשה, ואח\"כ נבנה הבית המקדש בימיו, לא מיפטר מלהביא קרבן ממש בזה דלמד לפני כן. וכ\"כ שו\"ת חקרי לב או\"ח סימן ב' והביא שם דבר פלא דמבואר בספר מקראי קדש (דס\"ח ע\"א) דלפי רבא אף בזמן המקדש יכול לקרוא בתורת חטאת ואשם ומיפטר בזה.</p>\n  \n  <p>ובשם הגאון מז\"ה נר\"ו הביא שם ראי' אלימתא משבת יב: דלא יתכן זה, דא\"כ במעשה ברבי ישמעאל ברבי אלישע דקרא והטה, למה הי' צריך לכתוב על פנקסו אני ישמעאל בן אלישע קריתי והטיתי נר בשבת לכשיבנה ביהמ\"ק אביא חטאת שמינה. ואם סגי בקריאה לחוד, למה לא קרא, אלא מכאן ראי' דאף בזמן שבהמ\"ק חרב לא מועיל הקריאה.</p>\n  \n  <p>ובשם ספר קול יהודה כתב במעשה דר' ישמעאל בן אלישע דלא יועיל לעסוק בתורת חטאת, מפני דחלק הכהנים לא יכופר בקריאת הפרשה, אבל הקשה עליו הגאון מהר\"ם דר' ישמעאל בן אלישע כהן הי' וכהן המקריב קרבן שלו עבודתו ועורו שלו, עיין שם.</p>\n  \n  <p>וכתב בשם ראש דוד דדחה הראי' דמצוה מן המובחר להקריב מבכורות צאנו ומחלביהן, ומדויק בזה הלשון שאמר יביא חטאת שמנה. ע\"כ.</p>\n  \n  <p>ויש להביא כאן מש\"כ בלקוטי יהודה (פר' תזריע ע' קד) בשם כ\"ק אדמו\"ר בעל האמרי אמת זצ\"ל מגור שאמר בשם ספר א' בהא דאיתא בגמ' כאן דר\"י כתב על פנקסו כשיבנה ביהמ\"ק אביא חטאת שמינה. ולכאורה למה הוצרך לכך, הרי אמרינן דהעוסק וכו' כאילו הקריב, רק דהאכילה דכהנים אוכלים הרי היא חלק מהכפרה, וא\"כ אפי' אי אמרינן כאילו הקריב, מ\"מ הרי חסרה הכפרה דאכילת הכהנים, ולכן אמר שכאשר יבנה ביהמ\"ק יביא חטאת שמינה, כדי למלא החלק של אכילת הכהנים עכ\"ד שם ודפח\"ח.

    "content": "# Why specifically the chilazon?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah commands us in Bamidbar 15:38 to attach tzitziyot on the four corners of our garments, and insert a thread of blue in each tzitzit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Speak to the children of Israel and you shall say to them that they shall make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments, throughout their generations, and they shall affix a thread of sky blue [wool] on the fringe of each corner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Translation via <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9943/jewish/Chapter-15.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (Menachot 42b) informs us, however, that the blue thread cannot be dyed with just anything. We must dye the thread with the blood of a certain sea-creature called the chilazon. </p>\n\n<p>Why must we dye the thread using the blood of the chilazon? Why does the Gemara raise such a big stink about people using kala ilan, indigo, to dye the threads instead of the blood of the chilazon? The color was exactly the same. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The dye extracted from the Chilazon or Murex Trunculus was very expensive and was considered in ancient times to be a luxury. One of the reasons this dye was so expensive, because \"twelve thousand snails of Murex brandaris yield no more than 1.4 g of pure dye, enough to colour only the trim of a single garment.\" [see link - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrian_purple]. The process of obtaining the dye and colouring the garments was also time and money consuming, thus making it one of the most valued items in ancient times. This dye was considered royal and was mainly used by the nobility who were able to afford it. This is also evident from Exodus 28 where some of the priestly garments were to be made from Techelet. But why is the poor Israelite obligated to obtain such an expensive item for his garments?</p>\n\n<p>If we suppose that the reason the Torah commands the Benei Yisrael to attach such an expensive string to their garments is - it should serve them as a constant reminder that they are a nation worthy of royalty (\"Yisroel Benei Meluchim Heim\". Tractate Shabbat 67a)  a \"chosen nation\" a distinguished race, then we can easily understand the disgrace of one who wears \"Kla Ilan\" instead of \"Techelet\". That is, besides for the fact that he's misguiding everyone into thinking that he's wearing the expensive Techelet (fooling everyone that he can afford it, or that he is a god fearing Jew), he is also deliberately corrupting the intent of this Mitzvah, and is exchanging the high quality of Techelet for a cheaper quality blue, whereas the color of the Techelet was never the purpose of this commandment (even though the Gemara mentions that the color resembles the color of the Godly throne, that is a \"remez bealma\") but the quality of this dye!   </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>\"Techelet is <em>wool dyed with Chilazon</em>\" - this seems to be a \"well know\" tradition/fact/definition as we see in Menachot 42b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ליה אביי לרב שמואל בר רב יהודה הא תכילתא היכי צבעיתו לה אמר ליה מייתינן דם חלזון וסמנין ורמינן להו ביורה... ‏</p>\n<p>Abaye asks Rav Shmuel the son of Rav Yehuda: \"that Techelet, how do you color it?\" He answered: \"you take the blood of a Chilazon and chemicals and you boil it in a vat...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara doesn't even  bring a \"source\" (e.g. a Tosefta, Braitha or the like) for this \"fact\".</p>\n<p>And that's how Rashi defines Techelet in Shemoth 25:4</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ותכלת</strong>. צמר צבוע  בדם חלזון (מנחות מד.), וצבעו ירוק‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you use Kala Ilan it isn't Techelet; it's [dark-]blue wool.</p>\n<p><strong>So why Techelet and not any [dark-]blue wool that would remind you of the sea-sky-fear of Gcd?</strong></p>\n<p>Rashi answers this in Bemidbar 15:41:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>פתיל תכלת</strong>. על שם שכול בכורות. תרגומו של שכול <strong>תכלא</strong>.‏<br/> ומכתם היתה בלילה וכן צבע התכלת דומה לצבע רקיע המשחיר לעת ערב.‏<br/> ושמונה חוטים שבה, כנגד שמונה ימים ששהו ישראל משיצאו ממצרים עד שאמרו שירה על הים:‏</p>\n<p>Techelet shares the root letters  -  T.Ch.L - with <em>Tichleh</em> the Aramaic word for killing (the Egyptian firstborns). <br/>They were killed at night and Techelet has the color of the sky as night approaches. <br/>And 8 threads like the 8 days from the time they left Egypt till they crossed they said Shira at the sea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>See the Sifsei Chachamim for how to explain the \"8 days\". Essentially it starts the count from the time they slaughtered the Pessach, on Nissan 14.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Techelet from the chilazon was \"wool dyed blue, the color of the sky which appears when there is a clear sky\" and \"it remains beautiful without changing\" as the Rambam says in Hilchos Tzitzis Perek 2.</p>\n<p>Besides these, the Chilazon has some deep connections with the land of Israel and kingship as I elaborate in this vort (my chiddush):</p>\n<p><em>1) The Chilazon & the Land of Zebulun</em></p>\n<p>To produce techelet, we require the chilazon, a rare sea creature whose identity was known to the tribe of Zebulun. Strikingly, the gematria of חלזון (chilazon) is 101, the same as זבולון (Zebulun). This hints at Zebulun’s unique role in sustaining this mitzvah, as they dwelled by the coast (Devarim 33:19) and facilitated its harvest.</p>\n<p>Lesson: Just as Zebulun supported Yissachar in Torah study, the chilazon—through techelet—supports our spiritual awakening, tying material wealth to divine purpose.</p>\n<p><em>2) The Royalty of Chilazon</em></p>\n<p>The chilazon was exceedingly precious, worn by kings and nobles in antiquity. This is no coincidence: חלזון (101) shares its numerical value with מלוכה (kingdom) and המון (abundance).</p>\n<p>Insight: Techelet is not merely a dye—it is a regal adornment, reminding us that every Jew is part of a mamlechet kohanim, a kingdom of priests (Shemot 19:6). Its costliness reflects the priceless value of mitzvot.</p>\n<p><em>3) Techelet: A Wake-Up Call for Redemption</em></p>\n<p>The blue of techelet stirs us from spiritual slumber (נומה), heralding the arrival of our Consoler (נהום /נחום)—Hashem’s messenger (מלאכי) and the angel Michael (מיכאל), who will arise in the End of Days to defend Israel (Daniel 12:1). Remarkably, all these words share the gematria of 101:</p>\n<p>מיכאל (Michael)\nנחום / נהום (Consoler) (guttural exchange for gematria)\nמלאכי (My messenger)\nחלזון (Chilazon)</p>\n<p>Connection: Just as techelet awakens us to divine presence, Michael—the guardian of Israel—symbolizes ultimate redemption. The thread of techelet thus weaves together our present mitzvah with future geulah.</p>\n<p><em>4) Techelet Overrides Kila’im: A Divine Paradox</em></p>\n<p>The mitzvah of techelet is so powerful that it supersedes the prohibition of kila’im (forbidden mixtures in clothing). Intriguingly, כלאים (kila’im) also equals 101, like חלזון.</p>\n<p>Depth: This teaches that techelet transcends ordinary boundaries—it is a mitzvah that elevates the physical into the realm of holiness, turning potential kilayim into a garment of divine connection.</p>\n<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p>The gematria of chilazon reveals a tapestry of meaning: royalty, redemption, and spiritual awakening. Every time we gaze upon its blue strands, we are reminded that we are a nation of nobility, called to rise from complacency and anticipate the ultimate consolation.</p>\n<p>May we merit to see techelet restored fully within Am Yisrael by taking the necessary steps to wear it on our Tzitzit so we can merit to see the coming of Mashiach, speedily in our days as the Rambam said in Laws of Teshuvah 3:4,</p>\n<p><em>“Each person must view himself and the entire world as being half meritorious and half guilty. If he does a single mitzvah, he can tip the scale and bring redemption and salvation to the entire world”.</em></p>\n\n\n",

If you wear techelet from the Ptil Tekhelet Organization, you have nothing to worry about, as the dye will not run out of the strings. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I also might add that I recently took an old wool Chabad tallit katan with silk corners to a dry cleaners, and the garment came out perfect, like it was new. I also might say that since there is no Jewish community out here where I live, it would be easy to say that they didn't even have particular experience with washing tallitot k'tanot.

So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not destroy them but did act angry with them only for appearance. He too merely pretended to desire to destroy them, as all He did was issue a threat, but in the end the decree was annulled. And this is as it is written: “For He does not afflict from His heart willingly” (Lamentations 3:33), but only for appearances’ sake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does it mean to be a chosen nation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Regarding \"choice\" \"bechira\" when there is a choice of a superior option versus a less superior option this is not as much of a choice between two similar options.</p>\n\n<p>That being the case being chosen would seemingly mean there is little difference between a Jew and a non-Jew.</p>\n\n<p>However, despite similarity we know Hashem loves the Jewish people as \"His firstborn son\" and has high expectations from us to be a \"light unto the nations\". If we are similar to non-Jews how does this make sense to have such favor and such high expectations from Jews?</p>\n\n<p>If we look at this and say the choice is not regarding the physical differences but a \"soul\" \"neshama\" difference and the Jewish soul is holy and unique whereas non-Jews do not have their soul from the same source, then how is this a choice if it is a difference is between unequal options?</p>\n\n<p>How does one resolve these conflicts in regards being a chosen nation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is an excellent question which touches on several important ideas discussed at length in the Torah in general and in Torat HaChassidut in particular.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that Israel is <em>the Chosen People</em> is derived from the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.6?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parshat v'Etchanan, chapter 7:6</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי עם קדוש אתה ליהוה אלהיך <strong>בך בחר יהוה אלהיך</strong> להיות לו לעם סגלה מכל העמים אשר על־פני האדמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many commonly translate <em>Am Segulah</em> as <em>the Chosen People</em> because commentaries like Ramban say we are given this title as a consequence of G-d choosing us at the time of the giving of the Torah. That this <em>choosing</em> is out of His love for Israel like is understood from the continuation of the concept in Sefer Devarim, parshat v\"Etchanan 7:7-8.</p>\n\n<p>But <em>segulah</em> is more accurately translated like is found in the Jastrow dictionary as <em>precious</em> or <em>cherished</em> or <em>highly prized</em> like is found in most classical commentaries like Ibn Ezra and the Tur HaAruch.</p>\n\n<p>But at the same time, it is worth pointing out that the Alcalay dictionary translates <em>segulah</em> as <em>adaptable</em>. This would mean that because G-d chose Israel from among all nations, we became more flexible, meaning more adaptable than any other nation on earth to whatever changes would come to the world.</p>\n\n<p>This idea speaks more to the ability of the Jewish people to survive, come what may, and to reproduce and raise children. This understanding is also supported by the concept of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Survival of the fittest</a></em> as espoused by Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer found in modern science.</p>\n\n<p>Such a perspective, which is according to the plain meaning (<strong>פשט</strong>) adds deep meaning to the phrase <em>Torat Chaim</em>, the Torah of Life, and that \"<em>It is a Tree of Life to all who grasp hold of it.\"</em> And this is in keeping with the general teaching from Moshe Rabbeinu in Devarim 30:19 which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>העידתי בכם היום את־השמים ואת־הארץ החיים והמות נתתי לפניך הברכה והקללה <strong>ובחרת בחיים למען תחיה אתה וזרעך</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From a historical perspective, the simple fact that the Jewish people have survived intact from all the ancient races is one of the great, revealed miracles. Bestowing this extra level of adaptability, similar in effect to G-d's dispersing Israel all over the world (which looks on its face to be a hardship), is certainly a great kindness from the <em>Creator</em> which has served the Jewish people throughout the ages.</p>\n\n<p>And if this idea of G-d choosing Israel is considered in all its details, it is understood that this is not speaking about the Jewish soul, which is eternal and which transcends the physical, material world, but to the physical, material body.</p>\n\n<p>And this is stated explicitly by the Alter Rebbe <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49432&st=&pgnum=140\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(see the bottom of the page) in chapter 49 of section Likkutei Amarim in the Tanya</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And this leads to the question you raise that there appears to be a dual nature to the Jewish people. That from the external perspective, the Jewish body appears to be the same as that of the non-Jewish nations. But from the inner perspective, the Jewish soul is completely different from that of the non-Jewish nations. This distinction of the Jewish soul is expressed by Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabbai in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39241&st=&pgnum=209\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Avodat HaKodesh, section 3 (Chelek HaTachlit), chapter 17 beginning with the words, \"כי האדם הוא מה שהוא בשכל וכו\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Or to put it in the words used in your question, from the perspective of the Jewish soul, we are considered to be like <em>a first born son</em> to <em>Our Father in Heaven</em>. And like you point out, <em>true choice</em> can only be when there is no compelling distinction between those things being chosen.</p>\n\n<p>But the Jewish people have two types of relationship with G-d (אבינו מלכנו), that of a son (בן) and also that of a servant (עבד). And the distinction between these two types of relationship is discussed in detail in the Chassidic discourse of the 5th Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Shalom Dov Ber fro<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31623&st=&pgnum=319\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">m the year 5666, beginning with the words, \"ומקנה רב כו\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And through understanding the nature of this dual relationship, it underlines that, as you point out, choosing the Jewish soul is not a true choice at all, because there is a compelling distinction according to the nature of the Jewish soul as contrasted with the non-Jewish soul. And if that is understood, and the choice is about the Jewish body, which appears similar to the non-Jewish body, then why is it distinguished?</p>\n\n<p>And this is discussed at length by the Lubavitcher Rebbe in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25071&st=&pgnum=296\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaMa'amarim Meluket, volume 4, page 270, beginning with the words, \"ויובן זה ע\"פ המבואר במ\"א בענין נשמה וגוף\".</a></p>\n\n<p>And with greater detail in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14936&st=&pgnum=13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likkutei Sichot, volume 11, pp. 5-7, chapters 6 and 7</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And also in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15990&st=&pgnum=347\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Menachem Hitvadiyut, volume 2, in the Discourse, <em>All Israel have a portion in the world to come</em>, pg. 325, beginning with the words, \"ומזה מובן\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That the essence of this choosing is something which completely transcends the nature of creation as a whole, both in regard to <em>the One choosing</em> (G-d, אין סוף עצמותו מהותו ), and in regard to <em>the root of that being chosen</em> (the Jewish body, הגוף דישראל).</p>\n\n<p>That just as the mitzvot are from a higher root (Ratzon, Will) than the Torah (Chochmah, Wisdom, Intellect), meaning Torah comes to explain and to clarify about the Mitzvot. But the performance of the Mitzvot is the primary thing like is understood from Shemot 24:7 which says, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויקח ספר הברית ויקרא באזני העם ויאמרו כל אשר־דבר יהוה <strong>נעשה ונשמע</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it is in regard to the Jewish body and the Jewish soul. That ultimately, in the time to come, the Jewish soul will be sustained from the revealed inner root of the Jewish body which is higher than the Jewish soul.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A better translation than \"chosen\" would be \"elected.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we are similar to non-Jews how does this make sense to have such\n  favor and such high expectations from Jews?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The same way it makes sense to have higher expectations of a manager or VP or CEO than over a lower-level worker. All are working for the same company, but the higher level managers have both greater responsibility, accountability and rewards.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In short, the idea of Hashem choosing the Jewish nation (<em>similarly to choosing single persons, like Abraham or Moses</em>) might be interpreted as either <strong>conditional</strong> (based on people's performance) or <strong>unconditional</strong> (based on their innate trait). Both approaches are covered extensively in our tradition. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The \"<strong>conditional choice concept</strong>\" is based on the lack of predestination, namely, all people being created with an equal chance to excel, the original <strong>physical equality of the Jews to other nations</strong> and Hashem's choice of the Jewish nation being \"triggered\" by our forefathers' beneficial actions. For me, this argument is more suited for arguing with the gentiles on this topic. For example, offering the Torah to all nations (<em>Midrash Sifri, Deut. 343</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p>The \"<strong>unconditional choice concept</strong>\" presents the Jews as Hashem's original desire (\"ישראל עלו במחשבה תחילה\"), the \"primordial choice\", the predestined nation, and subsequent creation of the rest of the world (incl gentiles) as the \"scenery\" for its realization. Same with Abraham or Moses, being \"predestined\" to be Jews or natally possessing the qualities of Jews.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This explains the seeming contradiction you addressed in your question.</p>\n\n\n",

It says that he may not sell to an Am Ha'aretz either dry or wet produce, as he will come to make them impure, and one may not cause Eretz Yisrael produce to become impure. </p>\n\n<p>Fine. So far, so good. </p>\n\n<p>The next requirement is that he does not buy wet produce from them, as they would have become tamei in his reshus. Since tumah only rests on things that have become wet (Vayikra 11:38), the prohibition is only on things which were wet. Dry produce is entirely permissible. </p>\n\n<p>Why are we not concerned that maybe it became wet in his property and subsequently dried? Whether the impurity touched it when it was wet or after it became wet it should still be considered tamei (see Rashi to above passuk). Why should dry produce be any better than wet produce? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Demai.2.3?lang=bi&with=Tosafot%20Yom%20Tov&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfos Yom Tov</a> actually answers your question!</p>\n<p>(<em>Source from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria.org</a></em>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ואינו לוקח ממנו לח</strong>. כתב הר\"ב אבל יבש וכו' ונאמן עם הארץ לומר הפירות הללו לא הוכשרו וכו'. הכי תני בירושלמי. וטעמא דהא דאין עם הארץ נאמן לומר שלא נטמאו לפי שאינן בקיאין בדקדוק טהרות וטומאות ולפיכך אע\"פ שהוא ישראל וישנו בתורה ובמצות אינו נאמן לטהרות כמ\"ש הרמב\"ם בריש פ\"י מהלכות משכב ומושב. והלכך לענין לומר שלא הוכשרו נאמן לפי שאין זה צריך לשום בקיאות לדקדק.

One week he forgot this, and entered the bathhouse. After he had begun bathing, he remembered that he had not yet heard the weekly parasha from his grandson, and he left the bathhouse. They asked him why he was leaving in the middle of his bathing, since the Mishnah teaches that once you have begun bathing on a Friday afternoon you do not have to interrupt. He replied, “Is this such a small thing in your eyes? For whoever <strong>hears the parasha from his grandchild</strong> is as if he heard it directly from Mount Sinai <strong>as it is said, ‘Teach your children and children’s children</strong>,’ and then it says: ‘The day you stood before God your Lord at Horeb.’”</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Talmud Yerushalmi Shabbos 1:2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Which is greater, to teach your grandchild or to hear your grandchild teach? Since R' Yehoshua ben Levi said both things, and he proves both points from the same verse; we can assume that the Bavli stresses one approach while the Yerushalmi stresses the other. (Although both are true)</p>\n\n<p>If a child needs to be taught, then you will naturally approach the child within his level and invest your teaching within him where he is holding.</p>\n\n<p>If you want your child to be able to teach, then you must encourage him to advance to a level beyond himself.</p>\n\n<p>The first approach (Bavli) is that of the mechilta's view of the 4 sons. The second approach (Yerushalmi) is that of the Yerushalmi's version of the 4 sons.</p>\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi calls the simpler son a \"Tipesh\" (foolish) which views his current state as a lesser position from which he has the potential to advance. Tipesh has a negative connotation. So the Yerushalmi advises to take the foolish son and transform him by the power in the Torah to become a sage. Teach him wisdom which is right now on a higher level than he is used to learning.</p>\n\n<p>This is why the Yerushalmi prescribes learning Halachah for the \"Tipesh\".</p>\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi also asks that the \"wise\" son be told the exciting and powerful story of what Hashem did. This is because the one who is used to intellectual study, needs to grow beyond himself and also exercise feelings that come from the depth of the soul, not just the letter of the Law.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Bavli stresses making sure a child is soundly grounded on their own level first. So the \"Tam\" (wholesome) child is described with a label that is not negative, but positive in nature. He is to be told things on a level most likely to reach him now; which is the exciting story of Hahsem's power etc.</p>\n\n<p>The \"wise\" son is also better reached by giving him what he thrives on - learning Halacha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yosef Tabory (<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23608247\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, p. 173-174) suggests that the Yerushalmi views the Chacham as a very smart son, who already knows the Halachos, and is therefore free to learn about Yetzias Mitzrayim, as he should (and this is similar to \"Afilu Kulanu Chachamim\", and the story of the Tanaim in Benei Berak), whereas the Tipesh is so stupid he doesn't even know the Halachos properly, which must be learned before he hears about Yetzias Mitzrayim.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in the Haggadah's version, the Chacham is a regular son, and learning the Halachos is an important part of Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim, and the Tam is just doing a basic Sippur Yetzias Mitzrayim.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion it's a bit weak, but he does discuss it and make this suggestion.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What is very important is that he makes a very strong case (including manuscript evidence) that the line explaining why the Tipesh learns about Afikoman, which is שלא יהא עומד מחבורה זו ונכנס לחבורה אחרת, does not actually belong in that section at all.

In the version presented in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.70b.2?with=all&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi</a>, he is known as the \"Tipeish\" (\"stupid\") child, a drastically different way of approaching exactly the same question. Even further, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.13.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> calls him the \"Tinok Tipeish\" and the \"Sho'el Derech Setumah\" (\"the one who asks bluntly\"). </p>\n\n<p>Why are there so many different ways to refer to the same child? Why doesn't everyone just call him the same thing?</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, what is it about this child that the Yerushalmi, for instance, wanted to call him a tipeish? Why didn't he call him a tam?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The answer is that the basic premise of the question that there are four discrete children, and all the Midrashim refer to \"the same child\", is baseless.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, the pashut peshat is that the four verses are synonymous. Pashtanically, for example, \"what is this service to you\" is not an antagonistic mockery, and it is not interpreted this way by any of the non-Midrashists, e.g. Ibn Ezra and Rashbam. Similarly, none of the other 3 verses describing the questions of the sons are interpreted by these Rishonim as referring to discrete unique questions. (Although admittedly, they are fairly bland questions anyway; it is this verse that most starkly demonstrates the difference between the peshat and the derash).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the starting point is simply four seemingly equivalent verses about relating the Exodus to one's children, which are then Midrashically developed into discrete answers for discrete children. It is the Midrashim themselves which develop these verses into children; not as the question implies \"so many different ways to refer to the same child\" that the profiles were preexisting.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the distinction between tam and tipesh, it should be noted that this is not necessarily even a Midrashic dispute; let alone one bordering on Peshat. The Midrash Sekhel Tov (Exodus 13:14) for example explicitly equates 'tam' and 'tipesh':</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה זאת. זו מדת תם, דהיינו בן טפש שאינו מבין מדעתו ולא למד מאחרים ואינו רשע וכופר, אלא בתמותו שואל מה זאת העבדה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, it appears that the terms are simply synonymous in context.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>At the same source I quoted in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/81317/responses-to-the-chacham-and-tam?noredirect=1&lq=1\">Responses to the Chacham and Tam</a> (Please go read the article I quote, it's absolutely fantastic!), he provides a fascinating answer to this question as well.  </p>\n\n<p>Being that in his opinion, the Yerushalmi's text was written during the time that the Beis Hamikdash was built, the Tam (good innocent boy) does not need to be addressed, because he is not asking any questions, nor will he violate any Halachos.  We are only concerned about the Tipeish, who may accidentally violate Halacha.  However, in the Mechilta/Haggadah version, where there is no Korban Pesach actually being brought, and we must teach all of the children about Pesach, and the Chacam is \"moved from his place\" by being taught the advanced theoretical Pesach laws, the regular explanation is given to the nice, simple son.</p>\n\n\n",

Ibn Ezra there). And if what the Abarbanel (to <em>Devarim</em> 16:18-21:9) and the Netziv (on Devarim 17:14) say is true, namely, that there is no need for/a danger to human life because of monarchies, and that the Jewish people need not have a monarchy, but may choose a representative democracy, then in such a case would it even be necessary to elect a scion of the Davidic line at all? Would the president/prime minister even need to be male? Could the \"messiah\" be a woman? If the change of government does negate the promises to the Davidic line, could it obviate even a messiah figure at all?</p>\n\n<p>These are serious questions.

Like for example the idea that appointing a King is not a mitzvah like is stated in Sanhedrin 20b.</p>\n\n<p>But if that is overlooked, then the essence of your question seems to be, is a scion from the Davidic line required (for Moshiach, the ultimate ruler associated with that idea) if we have an elected head of government? And could the Moshiach be a woman?</p>\n\n<p>The short answer is yes, that scion of the Davidic line would be required because of the function and effect that they have on the entire Jewish people in terms of their service to the Creator. And no, a woman cannot fulfill that function.

The reason for this is that the Shema has exactly 245 words, and by adding an additional three we bring that number up to 248, which is the number of positive mitzvot (and human limbs, etc).</p>\n\n<p>(See also Siddur Vilna, pp. 83–84 and 88)</p>\n\n<p>My question: if somebody regularly davens alone, they might get into the habit of adding three words at the beginning, as described. In the event that s/he then finds themselves davening with others, but <em>accidentally</em> says אל מלך נאמן before commencing, what should s/he do?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Should s/he continue as usual and not worry about it, since it's only a custom and does not affect the status of the Shema?</li>\n<li>Should s/he pause, then recommence without that additional passage?</li>\n<li>Should s/he continue as usual, but not wait for the shaliach tzibbur and just continue straight into Emet veYatziv in order that the number of words recited in the Shema is 248 and not (technically) 251?</li>\n<li>Or is there something else that should be done?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The original minhag ashkenaz was to say kel melech neeman in all situations, when davening with a minyan and by oneself. (found in Rokeach, Agur, <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A1%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tur</a>, Siddur Shlomo Worms Maharik and other Ashkenazi Rishonim and early achronim) Some Achronim, including the Maharshal (tshuvah 64) and elaborated by his student in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40439&pgnum=89\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mateh Moshe 1-88</a>, yosif ometz-17) began to question saying kel melech neeman. One of the issues mentioned  it is an interruption between the bracha and the shema (maharshal concludes never to say it) The Rema in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A1%D7%90_%D7%92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">siman 61 sif 3</a> concludes that betzibur one should say Amen in place of (and have in mind)  the words kel melech neeman (roshei tevos of kel melech ne'eman are aleph mem nun=amen) and for the chazzan to repeat out loud: hashem elokechem emes at the end of shema. (minhag Poland similar to sefard, as opposed to western ashkenaz that only repeated the word emes).\n(Some later authorities have suggested that even answering amen is an interruption, resulting in some answering amen while others refraining)</p>\n<p>However, when saying shema biyechidus many [rema and in darkei moshe] have the custom to continue saying kel melech ne'eman to complete sum of 248 (since one cannot replace it with Amen and there is no chazzan to repeat hashem elokechem emes).</p>\n<p>If one accidentally said kel melech neeman (as was the original minhag ashkenaz supported by many rishonim) when davening with a tzibur, there is certainly no reason to not wait for the chazzan at the end of shema. One may proceed as usual and is relying on the original minhag ashkenaz, at most one doesn't have to have in mind when hearing hashem elokechem emes repeated from the shliach tzibur to add  to 248 but one should certainly wait for the shliach tzibur.\nThere is no issue with hearing too many words. Even according to the Rema, one answers amen before shema and hears hashem elokechem emes at the end and then says the 15 vavs which would add up to more than 248 and isn't concerned by this.</p>\n<p>[Rema and mechaber give another way for someone to arrive at 248 words without saying kel melech ne'eman when saying emes vyatziv there are 15 instances of the letter vav. When added up equals hashems name 3 times, thereby making up the missing three letters (rema gives an additional explanation).\nNote; there is no talmudic source for having 248 words in shema. It is implied by tanchuma kedoshim that there are 248 words but there is no mention of how that is arrived at. Zohar says including hashem elokechem emes adds to 248(some interpret ani hashem elokechem (not emes). Some rishonim such as rokeach mention adding kel melech ne'eman before shema to arrive at 248. It is certainly not meakev.]</p>\n\n\n",

Some extracts from this article (with changes to the unusual transliteration and grammar) are shown below: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Is it possible to sacrifice the Korban Pesach on Har-Habayit, today, without the Beit Mikdash?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The answer is very clear -yes. (according the Halacha and ignoring the\n  political situation)</p>\n  \n  <p>The Mishna (Eduyot 8,6) says:”R Yoshua said: I have heard that\n  sacrifices may be offered even though there are no Beit-Mikdash,and\n  that the most holy sacrifice may be eaten even though there is no\n  Beit-Mikdash, and lesser sacrifices may be eaten even though there are\n  no walls [of Jerusalem]…”. The Rambam (Beit Habechira 6 , 16) says that\n  this is the Halacha and we are obligated to do it, even today. In\n  summary- according to the Rambam it is permissible just on Har-Habayit\n  although there are problems to go up there.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Altar</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Most of the objectors thought that it is impossible to sacrifice\n  Korban-Pesach today because we haven’t a Kosher Altar, and there no\n  option to build the altar until that Moshiach will come. The\n  question now is if is it possible to build altar?</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi David Fridman and the Rabbi Shelomo Sakal A (Beit\n  Shelomo Yore-Deia part b ,chapter 125) objected to sacrificing a\n  Korban-Pesach today because we haven’t the ability to build an altar. But is\n  just a technical problem.Today with the modern technology, there is no \n  problem to build an altar with perfectly square corners (maybe more so than\n  in the past). In addition -we can use with laser rays instead of metal\n  tools.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The “Tumah” (impurity)</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>In the Gemara (Yoma 6b) there is a debate about the question if the\n  impurity will be cancelled (הותרה) or just pushed aside (דחויה) in a case when all Israel are tomei meis, but everybody agree that we can sacrifice a\n  Korban-Pesach in that situation.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rambam (HilchotBeit Hamikdash 4, 15-16) says that the\n  Halacha is:\"the impurity is pushed aside if all Israel are tomei meis.” In addition\n  -the Rambam wrote that if there are no Kohanim or there are no Jewish person who is not tomei meis, then the Korban can be sacrificed by any Jew even if he is\n  impure. (Rambam Beit Habechira 7,23)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the issues seem to be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The political problem of going onto the Har Habayis.</li>\n<li><p>Whether \"all Israel is tomei meis\" is satisfied by that proportion of\nthe Jewish people living in Israel.</p></li>\n<li><p>What proportion of the people are affected by tumas zivoh (for which there is no permission to ignore) - see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/53902/where-in-halachah-does-it-say-that-one-is-forbidden-to-go-onto-the-har-habayis?noredirect=1&lq=1\">this\nquestion and its\nanswer</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why do we don a tallit before laying tefillin?",
    "content": "# Why do we don a tallit before laying tefillin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When it comes to determining the order in which different things happen, there are often rules. According to Zevachim 89a, there are two rules in particular:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>That which occurs more frequently takes precedence (כל התדיר מחברו קודם את חברו);</li>\n<li>That which is more sacred takes precedence (כל המקודש מחברו קודם את חברו).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When it comes to the relative order of tallit and tefillin every morning, the rule is that one puts on the tallit and only <em>then</em> puts on the tefillin. This is because the tallit is put on every morning, while the tefillin is only worn on non-festive weekdays. In the words of the Kitzur Shulchan Arukh (10:2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והא דמקדימין את הציצית לתפילין, משום שמצוות ציצית תדירה יותר, שנוהגת\n  בין בחול, בין בשבת ויום טוב, ומצות תפילין אינה נוהגת אלא בחול, וקימא\n  לן תדיר ושאינו תדיר, תדיר קודם</p>\n  \n  <p>The reason that we precede the tefillin with the tzitzit is because\n  the tzitzit are worn more frequently, since they are used by weekdays,\n  shabbatot and festivals, while tefillin are only used on [non-festive]\n  weekdays. We have a principle that when one thing is more frequent\n  than another, the frequent takes precedence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the Shulchan Arukh also explicitly states (Orach Chayim 25:1) that we put on tefillin after the tallit because of the principle that we should ascend in holiness (מעלין בקודש), which indicates that while the mitzva of tzitzit might be more frequently observed than the mitzva of tefillin, tefillin have greater sanctity.</p>\n\n<p>So, why do we apply rule 1), that an object used more frequently than another takes precedence over it and not rule 2), that the object with greater sanctity takes precedence? Cannot rule 2) be used in order to prioritise tefillin over tzitzit?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>This is a good question, and really it's probably a better question than the answers out there.</p>\n\n<p>For context, we have to realize that this question (order of operations for donning Tzitzit and Tefillin) is a \"modern\" question which is a side effect of the modern practice of wearing a Tallit and Tefillin exclusively in Shul. In principle, these Mitzvot have nothing to do with each other, and when you want to put on a piece of clothing with Tzitzit you do so and when you want to put on Tefillin you do so. So the order you put them on in would have originally had more to do with how you dress yourself in the morning than anything else. Even today if for some reason you don't want to put on your Tallit yet but you do want to don you Tefillin (eg. you don't have your Tallit available yet, or you're wearing some sort of shirt/jacket which would require you to essentially take your Tallit off again to get the Tefillah Shel Yad in place) then you just don your Tefillin first.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the practice of choosing to don Tzitzit before Tefillin is quite old.</p>\n\n<p>Dagul MeRevava OC 25 addresses your question from Zevachim and answers that since there are other reasons given to have Tzitzit be first (such as its being equated to all the Mitzvot (see Nimmukei Yosef)), we choose rule 1 (as you say).</p>\n\n<p>Arukh haShulchan OC 25:1 says that Ma'alin BaKodesh is applied here to the wearer not the Mitzvot themselves, so again given the option of using rule 1 or 2, we choose rule 1 so as to have our bodies ascend in holiness.</p>\n\n<p>Sha'agat Aryeh 28 basically accepts your premise and says that indeed Tadir is not a good argument. The ordinary rules of how to deal with something Tadir vs. something holier apply, namely (Rambam Temidin 9:2), you can pick whichever you want.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover he notes it's not clear Tzitzit is actually Tadir. According to a fair number of Rishonim, Tzitzit doesn't apply at night while Tefillin does (everyone agrees in practice we abstain from donning Tefillin at night, at least MiDerabanan). Thus Sha'agat Aryeh actually prefers choosing rule 2 because there's no loss since even if Tzitzit is Tadir, you're allowed to choose rule 2 if you want.</p>\n\n<p>R Abadi notes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=54963&st=&pgnum=15\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Or Yitchak 2:22</a>) that Tadir shouldn't even matter here since you aren't obligated to put on a piece of clothing with Tzitzit (if you happen to wear a four cornered garment, you have to attach Tzitzit to it), whereas you are <em>obligated</em> to don the Tefillin (even if for whatever reason you aren't going to wear them every moment of the day). Thus this isn't a case of having to pick between two equal options. (In the opposite vein, the Levush (OC 25:1) argues that Tefillin can't be donned while naked so clearly clothing Mitzvot should precede Tefillin.)</p>\n\n<p>Artzot HaChayim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40311&st=&pgnum=5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 25:1</a>) notes that Rav Ovadia Bartenura (to <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%96%D7%91%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99_%D7%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zevachim 10:6</a>) actually rules (unlike the Rambam) that rule 1 precedes rule 2 in general which would answer your question.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it's important to note the Agur quoted in the Beit Yosef (OC 25) who writes based on the Zohar that Tzitzit should precede Tefillin. In a place where Halakha doesn't give a clear preference, many use Kabbalah to find a preferred practice, and this might be the origin of the old custom which the various reasons above developed around.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Not that simple this is the case always!</p>\n<p>One who is careful to wear a Tallit Katan (Tzitzit) should put on the Tallit Katan and Tefillin in their house and then walk to Shul wearing Tefillin, in Shul they should then put on a Tallit Gadol. This is explicitly based on the Zohar Vaetchanan 265, and the Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 25:2 rules so, namely, that one who is careful to wear a Tallit Katan should put on the Tallit Katan and Tefillin in their house and then walk to Shul wearing Tefillin and in Shul put on a Tallit Gadol.</p>\n<p>However, Halacha Brurah (Rav David Yosef, 25:11) says one should only put on one's Tefillin at home if one has worn the Tallit Gadol. This is based on the Arizal who explicitly says so. It seems the Arizal did not understand the Zohar as prescribing an order on what to put first but just saying that one needs to walk to shul with tzitzis (tallit katan AND tallit gadol) and tefillin.</p>\n\n\n",

Additionally there is a hint regarding Melikah that it occurs on the back of the neck with turtledoves and young doves, that (the Children) of Israel should not be \"stiff necked\" (i.e. brazen)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hope this is insightful!</p>\n\n\n",

When someone\n  brought a Korban in the Beis Hamikdash, he had a specific\n  time limit in which the Korban had to be eaten. Some had one\n  day and one night, others had two days and one night. In\n  those cases, the night followed the day. What is this all about?\n  The Chassam Sofer sheds a beautiful insight based on all of\n  the above. He says that as Jews we believe that this world is a\n  means to earn our ultimate reward in the world to come.\n  When a challenge arises for a Jew, he understands and\n  believes with full Emunah that Hashem is testing him in order\n  to make him great and to grant him the ultimate reward in the\n  future. This Jewish outlook is represented by the fact that the\n  night precedes the day. We believe that the challenge and\n  darkness of this world (Pesachim 2b) which comes first is\n  followed by the daylight, clarity and reward of the future\n  world. This ideal is deeply expresses right at the beginning of\n  the Torah by the fact that the day follows the night.\n  The secular view sees the day as coming before the night. For\n  them the perspective is that this world is the only one of\n  pleasure and enjoyment and that there is no future world of\n  reward. They live life taking in pleasures and steeped in\n  selfishness, thus self-fulfilling the prophecy and making their\n  day one of light now (enjoyment as they see it) and\n  disappointment and darkness in the future.\n  Why then is it that regarding the Korbonos the night follows\n  the day? The answer, explains the Chasam Sofer, lies in the\n  Mishna in Avos (4:17). There the Mishna explains that all\n  pleasures of this world combined do not compare to a single\n  pleasure of the World to Come. However, one moment of\n  Teshuva and Maasim Tovim in this world can never be made\n  up in the World of Reward and thus in that sense, this world is\n  invaluable.\n  When someone brought a Korban, he or she was seeking and\n  expressing ultimate closeness to Hashem. One left the Beis\n  Hamikdash inspired and uplifted. The moment was priceless\n  and unmatchable. Thus, in that aspect it was represented by\n  the fact that day preceded the night. The Teshuva and Maasim\n  Tovim of this world was the epitome of greatness and so much\n  more than anything to follow, even the Future World (night).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is just my understanding of the sugya in a way which I think explains how it is logical.</p>\n\n<p>Let's start from the beginning so we can see how this makes sense. The Mishnah in Bava Kamma 24b states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שור המזיק ברשות הניזק כיצד נגח נגף נשך רבץ בעט ברשות הרבים משלם חצי\n  נזק ברשות הניזק רבי טרפון אומר נזק שלם וחכמים אומרים חצי נזק אמר להם\n  רבי טרפון ומה במקום שהקל על השן ועל הרגל ברשות הרבים שהוא פטור החמיר\n  עליהן ברשות הניזק לשלם נזק שלם מקום שהחמיר על הקרן ברה\"ר לשלם חצי נזק\n  אינו דין שנחמיר עליו ברשות הניזק לשלם נזק שלם אמרו לו דיו לבא מן הדין\n  להיות כנדון מה ברה\"ר חצי נזק אף ברשות הניזק חצי נזק אמר להם אף אני לא\n  לא אדון קרן מקרן אני אדון קרן מרגל ומה במקום שהקל על השן ועל הרגל\n  ברה\"ר החמיר בקרן מקום שהחמיר על השן ועל הרגל ברשות הניזק אינו דין\n  שנחמיר בקרן אמרו לו דיו לבא מן הדין להיות כנדון מה ברה\"ר חצי נזק אף\n  ברשות הניזק חצי נזק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The halacha is that keren is chayev chatzi nezek in reshus harabim. The halacha is that shen and regel are patur in reshus harabim. The halacha is that shen and regel are chayev nezek shalem in reshus hanizik. The unknown is keren in reshus hanizik. R. Tarfon argues that it should be chayev nezek shalem based on a kal vachomer. The Chachamim reject this because of dayo.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara questions this. How can R. Tarfon make such a kal vachomer if the concept of dayo is d'oraisa. The Gemara answers that R. Tarfon agrees that there is a concept of dayo, but holds that it is only applicable when the dayo does not utterly repudiate the kal vachomer. But if the dayo does utterly repudiate the kal vachomer then he allows the kal vachomer to stand despite the dayo. (The Gemara also explains how each party understands the verses from which the concept of dayo is derived.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ור\"ט לית ליה דיו והא דיו דאורייתא הוא דתניא מדין ק\"ו כיצד ויאמר ה' אל\n  משה ואביה ירק ירק בפניה הלא תכלם שבעת ימים ק\"ו לשכינה ארבעה עשר יום\n  אלא דיו לבא מן הדין להיות כנדון כי לית ליה דיו היכא דמפריך ק\"ו היכא\n  דלא מפריך ק\"ו אית ליה דיו התם שבעה דשכינה לא כתיבי אתא ק\"ו אייתי ארבסר\n  אתא דיו אפיק שבעה ואוקי שבעה אבל הכא חצי נזק כתיב ואתא ק\"ו ואייתי חצי\n  נזק אחרינא ונעשה נזק שלם אי דרשת דיו אפריך ליה ק\"ו ורבנן שבעה דשכינה\n  כתיבי תסגר שבעת ימים ור\"ט ההוא תסגר דדרשינן דיו הוא ורבנן כתיב קרא\n  אחרינא ותסגר מרים ור\"ט ההוא דאפי' בעלמא דרשינן דיו ולא תאמר הכא משום\n  כבודו של משה אבל בעלמא לא קמ\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the face of it, R. Tarfon's position seems to be illogical. If he grants that there is a problem called dayo, how does the fact that it would ruin the kal vachomer affect anything? There is no mitzvah to have a particular kal vachomer. So who cares if dayo would not allow the kal vachomer at all? Just don't make the kal vachomer then!</p>\n\n<p>However, I think that R. Tarfon's position is actually the logical one, and if anything the Chachamim's position is illogical. Let's examine R. Tarfon's argument more closely.</p>\n\n<p>As originally formulated in the Mishnah, R. Tarfon's kal vachomer seems to be that if reshus hanizik is more chamur than reshus harabim (as evidenced by the fact that shen and regel are chayev nezek shalem in the former yet completely patur in the latter) and keren is chayev chatzi nezek in reshus harabim, then keren should be chayev nezek shalem in reshus hanizik. The Chachamim correctly respond that this is dayo. All you can derive from here is that keren should be at least chayev chatzi nezek in reshus hanizik. You can't expand it to nezek shalem. R. Tarfon responds that they misunderstood him. He was not making the above kal vachomer. Rather he was making a different kal vachomer using the same premises. He was saying that if keren is more chamur than shen and regel (as evidenced by the fact that the former is chayev chatzi nezek in reshus harabim yet the latter is completely patur in reshus harabim) and shen and regel are chayev nezek shalem in reshus hanizik, then keren must at least be chayev nezek shalem in reshus hanizik. To this the Chachamim reassert that the problem of dayo exists because you are going from keren being chayev chatzi nezek in reshus harabim to nezek shalem in reshus hanizik.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can see that instead of the Chachamim logically rejecting a kal vachomer for exceeding its source and R. Tarfon asserting some \"chok\" that dayo is inapplicable since it would ruin the entire kal vachomer, it is in fact just the opposite. R. Tarfon's position is in fact logical. The reason why dayo is inapplicable when it removes the kal vachomer is precisely because it would be illogical. If we have proven (within the Talmudic system of kal vachomer, as opposed to an actual proof) that keren is more chamur than shen and regel then it has to at least have the same level of obligation as shen and regel in reshus hanizik, which is nezek shalem. To say that keren should only be chayev chatzi nezek in reshus haznizik (because of dayo that it can't exceed the chatzi nezek of keren in reshus harabim) would defy the logic of the kal vachomer. Thus the kal vachomer compels us to ignore the fact that it exceeds keren in reshus harabim because this fact is demonstrably proven from the kal vachomer. The Chachamim, on the other hand, insist on a \"chok\" that it cannot exceed its source no matter what, even when the kal vachomer actually proves that it should exceed the source.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, to answer the original question, the opinion of R. Tarfon <em>that we still make a kal vachomer in a case where the dayo would entirely remove the kal vachomer</em>, is entirely logical, and if anything it is the opposing opinion that is illogical.</p>\n\n\n",

As it says, 'The grape said to them....'\"</p>\n\n<p>According to this logic, why don't we raise our cups during Hallel toward the end of the Seder? Should the derashah not apply to Hallel also? Why do we limit it to Hallel HaMitzri?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are differing customs regarding raising the cup during Hallel. The Beis Yosef (end of 422) seems to take it as a given that the cup is raised. The sefer Seder Haaruch suggests that the reason mentioned in your question is indeed the source for this custom. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9102&st=&pgnum=104\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan (473:23)</a> writes that 'אצלינו' the custom is to put the cup down immediately after לפיכך, so apparently he doesn't agree regarding the reason of saying shirah on wine. He explains that the reason we raise the cup by וְהִיא שֶעָמְדָה and לפיכך is based on the verse כּוֹס יְשׁוּעוֹת אֶשָּׂא - which can be interpreted homiletically to mean that we raise the cup when we mention salvation. This idea is also found in the commentary of the Rokeach, who also implies that this applies specifically to national salvation. </p>\n\n<p>I think perhaps we can explain your custom by extending this reasoning to cover the first Hallel as well, which prominently features the salvation from Egypt (the commentary attributed to the Rashbam understands even the first psalm as referring to <em>yetzias mitzrayim</em>). The second hallel is not about national salvation, but is rather more of a general praise, so we don't raise the cup.</p>\n\n<p>So perhaps those who raise during the first Hallel for the reason mentioned by the Ta'amei HaMinhagim are indeed those who also raise during the second Hallel. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A ba'al mum profanes His sanctuary?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was intrigued by a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/80928/physical-defect-vs-defect-in-holiness\">question</a> on this website about the reason behind the given commandment that a ba'al mum can't approach to bring a offer made of fire and the offer of bread/food of his G-d, and can't enter within the veil, nor approach the altar (see the passage of <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.21.16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 21:16</a>-23). </p>\n\n<p>Looking for answers and explanations from a historical, practical, spiritual point of view of why a ba'al mum can't enter the santcuary, I stumbled upon one verse of this passage:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַ֣ךְ אֶל־הַפָּרֹ֜כֶת לֹ֣א יָבֹ֗א וְאֶל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֛חַ לֹ֥א יִגַּ֖שׁ\n  כִּֽי־מ֣וּם בּ֑וֹ וְלֹ֤א יְחַלֵּל֙ אֶת־מִקְדָּשַׁ֔י כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י\n  יְהוָ֖ה מְקַדְּשָֽׁם</p>\n  \n  <p>but he shall not enter behind the curtain or come near the altar, for\n  he has a defect. He shall not profane these places sacred to Me, for I\n  the LORD have sanctified them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.21.23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev. 21:23</a></p>\n\n<p>I'm not asking how the physical characteristics are involved with the denial of doing this part of service, but rather what the actual profanity is. Is this situation \"profane\" because of the <em>mum</em>, or because the priest disobeyed a commandment?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Okay please read the verse carefully -- if he came in <strong>to do the priestly service</strong>, he would take <em>mikdashai</em>, \"my holy things\" -- plural, and make them <em>chol</em> -- mundane, or non-holy. The Talmud's interpretation, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9922#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">as cited by Rashi</a>, is straightforward: if a non-kohen tries to sprinkle the blood of a sacrificial animal (or perform other critical steps to process it), it's <em>mundane</em> (<em>chol</em>); it doesn't become <em>kodesh</em>, a holy sacrifice. The only way a sacrifice becomes holy is if the procedure is done according to the law, and the law requires a male kohen who does not have a major blemish. Thus the verse reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A kohen with a deformity is allowed to eat sacrificial meat, but he can't do the sacrificial processes in the Temple; if he were to do so, those sacrifices would not be holy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The issue isn't walking around the Temple, and his presence does nothing to the Temple's sanctity. It's his eligibility to process sacrifices. (And it's unrelated to his intent, if that's your question; e.g. if he processed a sacrifice thinking he was eligible, it would still not be a kosher sacrifice.)</p>\n\n<p>As for why a kohen with a deformity is unfit for sacrificial duty, Lord Sacks suggests that the Temple had to be so focused on life that we don't want to draw people's attention to our own fragility and mortality then (unlike some cultures that made death a big part of their ritual). </p>\n\n<p>Now that can still trouble many readers, but it's a lot more of a limited statement than I think the way you were reading the verse (\"a disabled person walking into the Temple defiles the Temple!\"). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Sampson Rafael Hirsch (on Parshas Emor; Vayikra 21:17) explains (in part) that Hashem is asking the blemished Kohen to avoid service, because the world will look at the Temple as a place for losers, or the desperate seeking mercy and salvation only. This will \"profane\" the Temple. The profanity here is that the \"awe\" of the Temple will be lost because the masses will say that religion is great for the handicapped or abnormal, but not for people with a \"real life\". Those with obvious problems seek out religion. But if you have a vibrant life already, why turn to G-d? </p>\n\n<p>Hashem so to speak is asking the blemished Kohen to \"please abstain\" so as to save the Temple from losing its effect on society. The whole, healthy Kohanim dedicated to the service of Hashem, will show the people that serving Hashem is a vibrant lifestyle that grants all blessings. </p>\n\n<p>It is also good to notice that Hashem does in fact award the rights to eat holy food to a blemished Kohen. He is just commanded not to be an official employee. Therefore there is nothing against the blemished Kohen. It is just what the lesser members of society may think and how their attitude would be affected.</p>\n\n<p>This is how Rabbi Tzvi M. Feldheim of Denver- Toras Chaim (Lakewood) explained Rav Hirsch to me.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

One of the graduation ceremony traditions is to kneel on both knees in front of a seated master of ceremonies and place one's hands in between his in order to have the degree granted. There is also a ceremonial text which is usually the Christian \"Trinitarian formula\" (\"in the name of the father, son and holy ghost\") which I have agreed with the college to change for me to \"in nomini Dei\" alone. My question is, is the kneeling part also halachically problematic, and if so what would be appropriate to do? If you can provide sources that would be great - I want to understand the halachic context if possible. I am especially interested if someone else has been in a similar situation, what they did.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I can answer some of the question but not the real halachic bit.</p>\n\n<p>This sounds just like the Cambridge graduation ceremony. It is quite common and I think officially accepted for people there who don't want to kneel to just go and stand and lean forwards instead. It may be common practice among Jewish students in your place to make use of this kind of exemption. Even if you conclude that the kneeling is permitted, backing the exemption for those who don't might be another consideration.</p>\n\n<p>Personal experience: I have made use of this exception twice and know others who have, but not recently. A couple of other Cambridge graduation related points: you can mention that you don't want the trinitarian formula, but i think this only changes anything if you are the first in your ceremony/block. See <a href=\"http://www.cambridgestudents.cam.ac.uk/your-course/graduation-and-what-next/degree-ceremonies/ceremony\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. If your procession leads to multiple ceremonies, you may be asked to wait in a church, you can easily hover outside instead. </p>\n\n<p>(Another consideration when it was shabbat, because you exit the building straight into a public space: I asked my non-Jewish successor in the ceremony to take my certificate, and hovered inside the exit we leave from after graduating to give it to him/her. If there's someone more appropriate to look after it for you, you can transfer it from your successor to that person once everyone is together, back on senate house lawn.)</p>\n\n<p>If there is a Jewish community around the university concerned, there's bound to be advice and suggestions available.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Cambridge are very understanding. I did not kneel and there was some alternative text applied. The tutor responsible for graduation should be able to help. As this is common practice I second the opinion that you should try for the consensus opinion to keep things simple for others. Mazal Tov</p>\n\n\n",

Abaye said: When we say that the prohibition: “You shall not cut yourselves” applies, we are referring to a case where two courts are located in one city, and these rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai and those rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel.

    "content": "# Moving the fridge for Pesach cleaning\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is one required to move the fridge and clean out all the <em>chametz</em> that has gotten stuck underneath? This question assumes that the fridge will not be moved at all during <em>Pesach</em>. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Radvaz (Teshuvos, chelek aleph: 135) and the Chayey Adam (119:6) explain that the reason we clean cracks and crevices from chametz is because maybe we may come to eat it on Pesach (because it might get into food).</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, the Gemara Pesachim on 6b says that crumbs are not important at all. The Magen Avraham (S.A. 434) even says that crumbs are \"batel\" (nullified) by themselves, and do not need your declaration. </p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish 122:18 (brings the Gra) and says that visible bits of chametz stuck in between cracks in the floor, do not need cleaning. This is because no one will be suspected of gathering these bits to eat them. The Bes Yosef, Magen Avraham, and Mishnah Berurah (see Tur + S.A. 442) all agree that once chametz pieces are slightly dirty, there is no further reason to actually clean them, since no one will come to eat them. Your \"bitul\" declaration takes care of everything.</p>\n\n<p>This explains why the Chazon Ish (bringing the Gra again), is strict to clean books for crumbs (but not clean the floor cracks). He explains that books brought to the table with crumbs in the pages may fall out into the food. (BTW Many poskim are lenient even by books for various reasons.)</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch HaRav 433:19 specifically discusses a case of an actual larger than kezayis piece of good chametz that falls between the floorboards and remains visible. He says that one <strong>does not need</strong> to actually remove the floorboard and fish it out. The declaration of \"bitul\" is enough. This is because a person is not going to go there, so there is no risk of coming to eat it. In his Kuntres Acharon, the Rav objects by suggesting that if a valuable object (like jewelry) also fell in between the boards next to the chametz there on Pesach, we would rip out the board to recover the valuable? He answers that you still do not have to go get the bread out, because the chances of dropping a valuable there on Pesach are very slim.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, one need not move the fridge (or large appliances that are meant to remain stationary) to clean chametz under, or behind it; even if you know there is chametz there.

I've heard that in towns where <em>halal</em> meat isn't available they can eat kosher meat.  If the situation is reversed and it's the kosher meat that's not available to a small Jewish community, is it less bad for a Jew to eat <em>halal</em> if the species is kosher?

Some types of birds (e.g., ostrich, emu). Camels (because it does not have a proper ‘split hoof’).</li>\n<li>Jewish law forbids <strong>mixing meat and dairy</strong> products together. There is no equivalent in Islamic law.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-Kosher utensil</strong> need to be properly kashered. Islamic law, on the other hand, would only require the regular washing of any such utensil and would permit its subsequent usage to cook or consume ḥalāl products in.</li>\n<li>Jewish law requires a specific type of person (called a <strong>shochet</strong>) to slaughter. Typically, the shochet is an observant male Jew trained in the practice of slaughter. Islamic law allows any male or female Christian, Muslim or Jew to sacrifice as long as that person follows the proper procedure of slaughtering. Therefore, it is primarily for this reason that a dhabīḥa animal can never be kosher for observant Jews because the slaughter would be performed by a Muslim.</li>\n<li>The <strong>perfection of the knife blade</strong> – Jewish law requires visual and physical inspection; Islamic law only requires a sharp knife even if there are some imperfections (e.g., minor abrasions and nicks would be permissible in Islam).</li>\n<li>Jewish law requires <strong>one continuous stroke for a slaughter</strong> (moving the knife back and forth would be allowed), whereas Islamic law would prefer one stroke, but the slaughter would not be invalidated if the slaughterer quickly followed a first improper stroke with another one.</li>\n<li>In Jewish law, the <strong>knife must be at least two times the size of the animal’s neck</strong>, and perfectly straight, whereas there is no such requirement in Islam. <br/>(Not sure he's right about the perfectly straight - Danny)</li>\n<li>Jewish law completely forbids <strong>stunning</strong>, and a stunned animal would be treif; Islamic law is not unified on this point, as most authorities would consider stunning makrūh, but as long as the animal is alive and has a pulse, the slaughter would still be considered ḥalāl.</li>\n<li>Depending on which Islamic madhab one followed, the <strong>number of passages in the neck of the animal cut</strong> might be less for some opinions of Islamic law (however, a perfect cut in both religious would require the esophagus, trachea, arteries and jugular).</li>\n<li>While the <strong>disconnecting of the spine</strong> is prohibited in both laws, in Jewish law this would render the animal treif, whereas according to the majority opinion in Islamic law, this is makrūh but does not render the animal ḥarām (note that some authorities would view such an act as making the animal ḥarām).</li>\n<li>Jewish law requires a <strong>visual inspection of the lungs</strong> and some other internal organs of the animal after slaughter. Specific defects associated with these organs makes the animal treif, whereas the total absence of any imperfection (i.e., adhesion-free lungs) renders the animal a higher level of kosher, called glatt kosher. If such a level of perfection was not achieved, but the procedure was followed, the meat would merely be kosher. And some type of defects would, in fact render the animal treif even after proper slaughter. There is no equivalent to such a post-slaughter examination in Islamic law.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, I would add:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kashering</strong> - meat needs to be salted in a specific way before it is deemed kosher.</li>\n<li><strong>Bishul Akim</strong> - meat cooked by non-Jews is not kosher.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Conclusion: regular halāl slaughtering only resembles sh'chita from a distance - they both require a knife to cut off the head.

    "content": "# From a Rabbinical perspective is the creation of a golem considered a sin against Hashem or form of Sorcery?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This topic is a little strange but I'm curious as to where the concept of Golems fit within the current consensus of Rabbinical interpretations of Witchcraft. </p>\n\n<p>The Golem of Prague is a story surrounding the <strong>Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel</strong>. He was a Jewish mystic and scholar who lived in Prague and was claimed to have discovered a method for creating a Golem. The Golem in question was created for the purpose of defending the local Jewish community from ongoing antisemitic attacks. </p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Creating a being, regardless of the reasoning behind the creation of such a being, isn't that meddling in forces which aren't meant to be meddled in? </p>\n\n<p>Hashem is the creator and Hashem the sustainer. Wouldn't it be considered a form of individual idolatry for a person to raise themselves up to the level of a creator? Specifically, by forming a life in a method which mirrors the creation of man (creating a Golem from earth)</p>\n\n<p>Were such a thing to be accomplished, what would that make the creator? Would he commit an act against Hashem or would he simply figure out how to harness the powers of Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It doesn't appear to be a Halachic problem to create a golem as <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/4886#_edn10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> article discusses the question of creating a golem and including it for a minyan. None of the poskim in the discussion seem to bring up an issue of creating one in the first place:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Eliyahu Baal Shem of Chelm was best known for being of such\n  stature that he created a Golem [For more on this topic see Yeshurun (vol. 17, pg. 665 - 666), in the article by Rabbi M.D. Chichik about Rav Eliyahu Baal Shem from Chelm. In fact, the story of Rav Eliyahu and his Golem was recently adapted as a hardcover comic book entitled \"The Golem of Chelm – Hayah V'Nivra\".]. In fact, both of his\n  aforementioned illustrious descendants have written responsa on the\n  topic of the Golem that their grandfather created. The Chid”a [Shem Gedolim (vol. 1, Ma'areches Gedolim - Ma’areches Alef, 166).], in\n  his encyclopedia of Gedolim throughout Jewish history, ‘Shem Gedolim’\n  also attested to its existence.</p>\n  \n  <p>But before our readers decry the supernatural turn this article has\n  taken, they should realize that Golems actually do have a place in the\n  halachic realm as well. The issue that these Gedolim were debating was\n  whether a Golem can count for a minyan! Although the Chacham Tzvi\n  (Shu”t Chacham Tzvi 93) at first remained undecided, his son, Rav\n  Yaakov Emden (Shu”t Sheilas Ya’avetz vol. 2, 82) ruled unequivocally\n  that a Golem cannot count for a minyan! Apparently not just a\n  theoretical topic, it is even cited and debated by such contemporary\n  authorities as the Mishna Berura (55, 4) [Although the majority consensus is that a Golem would not count for a minyan (as detailed in the next footnote), there were several other authorities who defended the Chacham Tzvi’s tzad that a Golem would be able to count for a minyan, including Rav Yosef Engel (Gilyonei HaShas, Sanhedrin 19b s.v. sham maaleh alav) and the Likutei Chaver Ben Chaim (vol. 5, pg. 64a, comments on Chacham Tzvi 93), who dismisses one of the Chid”a’s counter-arguments, explaining that even a Golem should need to be 13 years old from the day he was created to count for a minyan! See also Shu”t B’tzeil HaChochma (vol. 6, 99 s.v. uvmch”t) who explains that the very fact that the Chacham Tzvi was originally mesupak whether a Golem can be included as part of Bnei Yisrael and count for a minyan (and although not the halacha l’maaseh) shows that he held that a Golem is mechuyev b’mitzvos; otherwise, there is no hava amina to count him for a minyan! However, it is important to note that although it was apparently not known to the Mishna Berura nor these authorities, the Chacham Tzvi actually later retracted his position!] and the Chazon Ish (Yoreh\n  Deah 116, 1)!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara and Midrashim talk about both the shevatim and amoroim creating golems.

Indeed, Rava created a man, a golem, using forces of sanctity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi there explains that the righteous could do this using the ancient kabalistic work Sefer Yezeirah, traditionally attributed to Avraham Avinu.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Daeh 179:15) records such an act as being permissible halachically:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... and with the Sefer Yezeirah it is permissable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shach (18) there explains, and indeed it is quite clear from his language, that he is referring to this source.

When he returned home, he prepared to apply all the spiritual lessons he had learned concerning the search for chametz. On the thirteenth of Nissan that year he did not eat. He did not fast, because it is forbidden to fast during Nissan, but neither did he eat, preoccupied as he was with preparing for the search. His search for chametz lasted the entire night, although he had only one room.</p>\n<p>After completing his search, the Alter Rebbe offered a mystic interpretation of the words of the mishnah:3 “On the eve of the fourteenth, we search for chametz by the light of a candle,” explaining as follows: “Thirteen” is numerically equivalent to the word echad — “one.” Oneness is identified with the knowledge of G‑d. On this level, there is no need to search.</p>\n<p>“Fourteen” refers to our emotional attributes (the seven attributes of the animal soul and the seven attributes of the G‑dly soul). Here a search is required.</p>\n<p>The search must be “by the light of a candle,” a reference to the soul, of which it is said:4 “The candle of G‑d is the soul of man.” And this search must encompass one’s entire being, just as the actual search for chametz must probe into even the “holes and cracks” of one’s home (the Previous Rebbe).5</p>\n<p>The difference between chametz and matzah is6 that chametz rises, while matzah lies flat. The rising of chametz alludes to egotism, the tendency to become bloated with self-love. Matzah, by contrast, represents bittul, selflessness, the willingness to commit oneself to others and to G‑d.</p>\n<p>This points to another difference between the two words. Chametz (חמץ) and matzah (מצה) share two of the same letters, the difference between them being that chametz contains a ches (ח), while matzah is written with a hei (ה). The ches and the hei have similar forms; they both have three lines and an opening at the bottom. But the hei also has an opening at the top, while the ches does not.7 The opening at the bottom is alluded to in the verse:8 “Sin crouches at the opening.” The opening at the top of the hei alludes to the possibility of rising above oneself in teshuvah.</p>\n<p>A person possessed by the self-concern of chametz is far more likely to fall prey to sin. Moreover, when he sins, his tendency is to rationalize his conduct and justify his failings. When, by contrast, a person is characterized by the bittul of matzah, he is less likely to sin. And if he sins, he will regret his mistake and use the “opening” he is granted to turn to G‑d in teshuvah (the Rebbe).

David Ibn Zimra</a>. The questioner wondered why we are so much more stringent about eradicating chametz than any other prohibitions. If it's because chametz carries the penalty of kares, there are other prohibitions which do as well. If it's because it is prohibited to derive benefit from chametz, there are other things which it is also prohibited to derive benefit from. If it's because it is something that is only prohibited for a certain time of the year, there are other prohibitions which also only apply during part of the year.</p>\n\n<p>R. David Ibn Zimra responded by noting that chametz is the only prohibition where we find the confluence of all three of these factors, so therefore the Torah and the Sages were extra stringent regarding its removal. He adds that Chametz is like a davar sheyeish lo matirin (forbidden now but permissible later).</p>\n\n<p>However, he says that this only suffices to explain why chametz is not considered nullified in something even 1,000 times its volume (just like a davar sheyeish lo matirin), but it does not suffice to explain why we have to search for it and eradicate it from our possession. </p>\n\n<p>He points out that even when it comes to avodah zarah, the obligation to search it out and destroy it is only in the Land of Israel, which means that we are more stringent by chametz than by avodah zarah even though one who admits to avodah zarah is as if he has denied the entire Torah!</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, he concludes that the only sufficient explanation is that midrashically chametz represents the Evil Inclination and that is why we have to go to such great lengths to search it out and eradicate it from our midst.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shu\"t Radbaz 3:546</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאלת ממני אודיעך דעתי מה נשתנה חמץ בפסח מכל איסורין שבתורה שהחמירה\n  עליו תורה להצריכו בדיקה ושרוף וכלה וגם ביטול והוסיפו חכמים להצריכו\n  בדיקה בחורין ובסדקין ולחפש אחריו ולשרש אותו מכל גבוליו ועבר עליו בבל\n  יראה ובל ימצא ואסרוהו בכל שהוא ואינו מתבטל כלל וחומרות כאלו לא נמצאו\n  בכל האיסורין שבתורה דאי משום דאית ביה כרת הרי חלב ודם ואי משום דאסור\n  בהנאה הרי כלאי הכרם ושור הנסקל וכמה איסורי הנאה שלא החמירה תורה בהם\n  כ\"כ ואי משום דלא בדילי מיניה כולי שתא הרי יין לנזיר דלא בדיל מיניה\n  והחדש דלא בדילי מן התבואה כולה שתא ולא חמירא כולי האי  </p>\n  \n  <p>תשובה שני דברים נאמרו בתשובת דבר זה אחת שלא נמצאו בכל האיסורין שבתורה\n  שיצטרפו בו כל ג' תנאים הללו שהוא איסורי הנאה והוא בכרת ולא בדילי אינשי\n  מיניה כולה שתא אלא חמץ בלבד וכיון שיש בו החומרות הללו החמירה עליו תורה\n  חומרות אחרות ובאו חכמים והוסיפו חומרות על חומרות כמו שעשתה התורה ותו\n  דחמץ בפסח הוי כדבר שיש לו מתירין שהרי איסורו תלוי בזמן ואחר ימי הפסח\n  יהיה החמץ מותר ואע\"פ שזה החמץ שהוא מבער אי אפשר שיהיה לו היתר אלא א\"כ\n  יעבור בבל יראה ובל ימצא סוף סוף הא איכא חמץ שיהיה מותר לו דהיינו אותו\n  שלא עבר עליו וק\"ל עליה דהאי טעמא נהי דסגי האי טעמא לענין דאפילו באלף\n  לא בטל כדבר שיש מתירין דאמרינן דאפילו באלף לא בטיל אבל לחפש אחריו\n  ולשרפו ולשרשו ולהוציא מרשותו לא ידענו למה גם על הטעם הראשון יש לי קצת\n  גמגום ומי עדיף מע\"ז דאמרה תורה ולא ידבק בידך מאומה מן החרם וכל המודה\n  בו ככופר בכל התורה כולה ולא מצינו שהצריכה תורה בה בדיקה וביטול אלא\n  שבארץ ישראל מצוה לרדוף אחריה עד שנאבד אותה מארצנו אבל בח\"ל אין אנו\n  מצווין לרדוף אחריה אלא כל מקום שנכבוש אותו נאבד את כל עכו\"ם שבו עכ\"ל\n  הרמב\"ם ז\"ל מ\"מ הרי אתה רואה שלא החמירה תורה בעכו\"ם כמו בחמץ הילכך\n  עדיין צריך טעם ועל כן אני סומך על מה שאמרו רז\"ל במדרשות כי חמץ בפסח\n  רמז ליצה\"ר והוא שאור שבעיסה ולכן כלה גרש יגרש אותו האדם מעליו ויחפש\n  עליו בכל מחבואות מחשבותיו ואפילו כל שהוא לא בטיל והרי זה אמת ונכון\n  והנלע\"ד כתבתי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the Torah Lashon HaRah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is it possible that the Torah could be considered Lashon HaRah? It describes personal information about both individuals and groups of people and documents their good, bad, and indifferent behaviours. This has lead to both praise and criticism of even the Prophets. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>No the authorship of the whole Tanakh doesn't constitute l'shon hara since the purpose was positive; to teach lessons to future generations (Megillah 14a). Information, even negative information, that is inteded for some positive purpose, and not just to defame someone, is by deifinition not l'shon hara.</p>\n\n<p>This is the opinion of numerous authorities including R. Menahem HaMeiri who writes that the definition of l'shon hara, is speech that is meant to be defamatory or hurtful. Thus, statements of a negative nature that are said for a positive reason and not to hurt others, are permissible since by definition they are not <em>l'shon hara</em>. These are his words in is Hibbur HaTeshuva (Meshiv Nefesh I:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עקר לשון הרע הוא המתמיד לספר בגנות האחרים ויתן דפי בענינים או שילעג להם למעוט הצלחתם...ומעין זה מי שילעיג על חבריו למעוט השגתם בידיעה...<strong>לכונת לעג וליצנות</strong>...<strong>וכלל הדברים כל אשר יתן מום באדם...ללא כונת ענין נבחר הוא ענין לשון הרע</strong>...<strong>שאין לספר במומי בני האדם על דרך לעג וליצנות, אם לא יעשה כן...לאיזו כונה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The archetypal <em>l'shon hara</em> is one who frequently relates embarrassing things about others, and adds falsehood to what he says, or he defames them on their lack of success...And similarly one who defames his fellows on their lack of intellect for the purpose of defamation and mockery...The rule is that anyone who ascribes a fault to others...without some specific intent is <em>l'shon hara</em>...For one should not relate the faults of others in context of defamation and mockery, unless he is speaking for some purpose. (Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This also appears to be the opinion of R. Elhanan Wasserman, who generalises this to all interpersonal mitsvot. He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך... \n  וכן בלאו דלא תלך רכיל, מותר לספר לה\"ר על בעלי מחלוקת כדי להשקיט המריבה. וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים... \n  ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת  </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And so too with the prohibition of gossiping, it is permitted to tell <em>l'shon hara</em> on disputants to quell the dispute...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse]...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, they do not attach conditions to to'elet, as the Haffets Hayyim famously does.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the eminent modern day halakhic authority, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osher_Weiss\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Asher Weiss</a> Shlit\"a writes in Minhat Asher to Leviticus (p. 268) that to'elet renders speech permissible and not l'shon hara, by definition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באיסורי תורה צריך לדון בדיני דחיה האם תועלת זו ראויה לדחות איסור ...אבל בהלכות לשה\"ר לאו מדין דחיה אתינן עלה, אלא יסוד האיסור תלוי במדה רעה וכל שכונתו לטובה...ולא לרעתו אין בזה עבירה כלל, ודו\"ק בכ\"ז כי לענ\"ד ברור הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>With Torah prohibitions one must evaluate with the laws of <em>dehiya</em> [prioritisation], whether this <em>to'elet</em> [purpose] is sufficient to supersede a prohibition. But with the laws of <em>l'shon hara</em>, we are not utilising the law of supercession. Rather, the very definition of the prohibition depends on negative character traits, and anything in which his intent is for good...and not for someone else's harm, has no prohibition whatsoever, and consider all of this, for in my humble opinion, it is clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He shows that this is the opinion of Rashi (Moed Katan 16a s.v. amar lei la'avuha) and sharply disputes (p. 267) the Haffets Hayyim's attempt at escaping the implication of Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך בחפץ חיים...כתב...ודבריו קשים לכאו' דמלבד שאין הדברים מתיישבים בלשון רש\"י</p>\n  \n  <p>However in Haffets Hayyim...he wrote...and his words appear difficult, for besides for the fact that his words don't fit with Rashi's wording...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Like R. Elhanan, he connects this to the idea that interpersonal mitsvot in general are by definition only prohibited when they are malicious. (In particular he connects this to the prohibition of overcharging, see p. 267)].</p>\n\n<p>This apparently nearly unanimous view expressed by the Meiri, R. Wasserman, R. Weiss, and the numerous authorities they cite as support, is expressed by R. David Cohen Shlit\"a, as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This to my mind [is similar to\n  when] the poskim speak about lashon harah l’toeles [for a helpful purpose], which is not limited to loshan\n  harah. Any [transgression of] bein adam l’chaveiro [when it is] l’toeles is mutar (cited <a href=\"http://drsorotzkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eng-honoring-abusive-parents.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, page 7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly R. Weiss clarifies (p. 267) that there are limits to the limitation of <em>l'shon hara</em> to cases of malicious intent:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דשאני המספר לשה\"ר דרך קלות ראש דהרי פושע גמור ובזה ודאי עובר בחטא כיון שהדברים מצד עצמם הם לשה\"ר גמור ובדרך שחוק וקלות ראש מנבל הוא את פיו בכה\"ג פושע הוא אף שלא התכוין להרע לחבירו</p>\n  \n  <p>For it is different if a person speaks <em>l'shon hara</em> with frivolity, since the matters are intrinsically <em>l'shon hara</em> and in the context of frivolity and levity, he pollutes his mouth. In such a case, he is a willful sinner even though he didn't intent to harm his fellow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is: \"I was just having a good time\", isn't a legitimate excuse to speak disparagingly about someone. However, by all indications, relating incidents about others for the purpose of conveying vital lessons to future generations would be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>None of this takes into account an additional reason that Tanakh may be appropriate; that its authorship and compilation may have been guided by <em>ruah hakodesh</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If the question is about the Torah in particular, that was generally understood to have simply been recorded by Moshe on God's orders, so he wouldn't have violated l'shon hara.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mostly no. One is permitted to speak badly about others when </p>\n\n<p>A) the speech concerns a Rasha doing a sin (korach)\nB) A publicly known matter (Solomon having too many wives and doing idolatry)</p>\n\n<p>What about when David sinned with Batsheva, which didn't affect the public and he wasn't genuinely a rasha?</p>\n\n<p>I would have to say that it became a public matter when God sent a prophet to rebuke him in the court.</p>\n\n<p>As for Moses' not circumcising his son, I don't have an answer other than humble Moses said insisted it be recorded.</p>\n\n\n",

It is proper to note that the two terms are not automatically the same in Halachah. A question can be asked as to when does a small piece of chametz achieve crumb status?</p>\n\n<p>There are two concerns of chametz on Pesach related to the OP(besides the prohibition of deriving benefit):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Not to own chametz.</p></li>\n<li><p>Not to eat chametz.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The amount of chametz required to violate either prohibition is the \"kazayis\" (olive sized; approx. 1 ounce.) Once chametz is a kazayis in one piece/gathering, it is prohibited unless it cannot be eaten by a dog.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Pesachim 6a tells us that crumbs do not count on Pesach. They do not even need a \"bitul\" declaration. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Gemara in Pesachim on 45a tells us that \"Batzek b'sidkei areyvah\" (pieces of dough found in the cracks of a mixing bowl) should be removed even if they are less than a kezayis. </p>\n\n<p>Are these two Gemaras contradictory? </p>\n\n<p>Also, the Gemara in Yoma 74a, tells us that \"Chatzi shiur assur\" (less than the prohibited amount is also forbidden). R' Yochanan holds this is Torah Law, but Reish Lakish says it is Rabbinic Law. Therefore, (either way) eating a crumb of chametz on Pesach would be forbidden even if it did not measure a kazayis. (the difference being that the one who eats less than a kezayis is not subject to punishment)</p>\n\n<p>The question is however, if you could violate the concept of \"chatzi shiur\" by owning less than a kazayis of chametz? Does the prohibition of \"chatzi shiur\" apply to owning chametz like it applies to eating chametz? According to many authorities, this depends on how you learn the Gemara on 45a (removing dough in cracks).</p>\n\n<p>The Meiri holds that you must remove pieces less than a kazayis only if they could become a kazayis if added all together (in the mixing bowl/same area). Otherwise, you need not remove them. The Shaarei Teshuvah on S.A. 442 brings the opinion of the Chacham Tzvi (which matches the Shaagas Aryeh end of Siman 81) that the idea of \"chatzi shiur\" does not apply to the prohibition of owning chametz (only eating chametz). Therefore, we need not remove larger bits of half cookie or pretzel which are less than a kazayis. The Toras Chesed (siman 44) goes so far as to say that less than kazayis pieces are in fact like crumbs.</p>\n\n<p>But the Rif, (unlike the Meiri) on the other hand, holds that you must remove even the less than kazayis pieces because of the prohibition on owning chametz (chatzi shiur). </p>\n\n<p>The Mechaber (Bes Yosef) S.A. 442:8 and 11, is himself lenient concerning removal of less than kazayis pieces. However the Magen Avraham brings the strict opinion. The Mishnah Berurah and Shulchan Aruch HaRav bring this M\"A and hold that in fact we do have an obligation to remove these less than kazayis pieces.</p>\n\n<p>Although these last mentioned poskim are strict, they do agree that once such less than kazayis pieces become a bit dirty, they no longer need to be removed. Apparently, such ruining grants them \"crumb status\". Certainly, no one suspects they will come to be willingly eaten. Therefore, as crumbs, they have no importance.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can see that there is no contradiction between the Gemaras on 6a and 45a. 6a is not worried about \"crumbs\". But it does mention that a \"gluska yaffa\" (a nice piece of chametz; apparently even less than a kazayis) is a problem. 45a similarly concerns itself with viable pieces less than a kazayis that have not been demoted to crumb status yet. They are also not on the floor, and because they exist in the kitchen/mixing bowl, they could end up in food.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So now we can summarize and answer the OP:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>A nice individually wrapped chametz candy, or a small pack of croutons measuring less than a kazayis would still need to be removed (if you found them). Otherwise, (if you don't find them) you rely on the \"bitul\" declaration. </p></li>\n<li><p>Broken pretzel pieces and half cookies measuring less than a kezayis that are still edible and clean in good condition, should be removed. (of course the bitul helps as in #1 above.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In #1 and #2 above, a large amount of these things in one area would be viewed as a full kazayis if added up together; even if they are individually smaller than a kazayis.</p>\n\n<p>These things in #1 and #2 above may violate the concept of \"chatzi shiur\" on owning them (according to the strict authorities) and certainly might come to be eaten. Therefore they are a problem.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><p>Dirty or slightly disgusting, albeit significant, pieces of half pretzel or cookie, less than a kazayis, need not be removed unless they could fall into food. (I am not sure if bitul is even needed here but it certainly works).</p></li>\n<li><p>Crumbs need not be removed. Crumbs need no bitul. They are automatically nullified. They only need to be removed if they can fall into food.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>From my own understanding of the above sugias, and what I received from my Rebbeim, even if these crumbs in #3 and #4 above were in one area and could be gathered together to form a kazayis, it still would not count as a kazayis of chametz.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, crumbs at the bottom of a drawer or on the floor in a corner, need no removal even if they are visible and easily accessed. </p>\n\n<p>Some people go out of their way to remove it anyway because of chumras Pesach. They feel that such crumbs may somehow get into food, and/or just don't feel good looking at it and want to serve Hashem above the letter of the law. This is acceptable since Pesach is a time to serve Hashem with extra chumras and chametz represents the yetzer hara being removed.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, Mishnayot Bava Kama 2:5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שור המזיק ברשות הנזק כיצד, נגח... ברשות הרבים, משלם חצי נזק.\n  ברשות הנזק, רבי טרפון אומר נזק שלם טז, וחכמים אומרים חצי נזק.\n  אמר להם רבי טרפון, ומה במקום שהקל על השן ועל הרגל ברשות הרבים, שהוא פטור, החמיר עליהם ברשות הנזק לשלם נזק שלם.\n  מקום שהחמיר על הקרן ברשות הרבים לשלם חצי נזק, אינו דין שנחמיר עליה ברשות הנזק לשלם נזק שלם.\n  אמרו לו, <strong>דיו לבא מן הדין להיות כנדון</strong>.\n  מה ברשות הרבים חצי נזק, אף ברשות הנזק חצי נזק.</p>\n  \n  <p>How is the penalty assessed for an ox that damages while on the private domain of the damaged party? If the ox gores... in the public domain, he pays half damages. In the domain of the damaged party, Rabbi Tarfon says full damages, while The Sages say, half-damages. Rabbi Tarfon said to them [using a fortiori reasoning], in a case where we are lenient with respect to \"tooth\" and \"leg\" [damages caused by normal behavior] in the public domain, where he is completely exempt, we are strict regarding the private domain of the damaged party, [requiring the owner] to pay full damages. In a case where we are strict with \"horn\" damage in the public domain, [requiring the owner] to pay half-damages, isn't it logical [a fortiori] that we should be strict with him in the domain of the injured party to pay full damages? They [The Sages] said to him [Rabbi Tarfon], <strong>it is enough that a law derived from an a fortiori argument be established similar to the case from which the inference is drawn</strong>. Just as in the public domain the payment is half-damages, so too in the domain of the damaged party the payment is half-damage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have always heard it pronounced \"Dayo <em>Lavo</em> Min HaDin\", \"It is enough for it to come from an a fortiori argument,\" but shouldn't the phrase really be \"Dayo <em>LaBa</em> Min HaDin\", \"It is enough for something that comes from an a fortiori argument,\" for grammatical sense?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The right version is the second (<strong>LaBa</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>Pronunciation LaVo is from the Ashkenazic קמץ under the \"for the going\" then people think it is \"to come\"...</p>\n\n<p>Must remember the source, but I think it was from the קרבן אהרן (a מפרש on the תורת כהנים ).</p>\n\n\n",

But, is it necessary to go that far as to leave a key with the rabbi? What about those people that have a security system on their homes? If someone enters the house and doesn't enter the correct password within about a minute, the police come. Does this mean that in addition to the key, one must also give the rabbi his home security password?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Tosefta in Pesachim 2:6 is the source for selling chometz. Many Rishonim have a girsa (additional wording) at the end of the tosefta warning not to perform the sale in a way of \"haramah\" (trickery). It needs to be a real complete sale. It should not look like the parties don't really mean it and its just a play to make the chametz \"sold\" when no one is really selling it or buying it. It is not a ceremony; but rather a sale. (It is for this reason of risking appearing like trickery, that many Jews have the custom of not selling chametz to a non-Jew.)</p>\n\n<p>In S.A. O\"C 448:16 the Bes Yosef brings a Terumas HaDeshen who says that the chametz must be sold to a non-Jew \"outside your house\". The Magen Avraham and Taz explain that it means the chametz must leave your reshus. The chametz should be brought out of your home to the non-Jew's domain. This measure shows that the sale is real, as merchandise is actually changing hands.</p>\n\n<p>The Bach, however wonders what people can do if they have a large amount of (example) shnapps (liquor) made of chametz. Does it all need to be transported to the non-Jew's home? So the Bach was inspired to pasken that one may grant a piece of his own domain (real estate) to the non-Jew in the sale with the chametz. That way, the merchandise did in fact enter the non-Jew's domain (without needing to transport it out). However, the Bach seriously states that one must give the non-Jew the key to the room/house that was granted to him as his domain. If he does not, then the whole sale is a trick and the chametz is not really sold.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Mishnah Berurah brings the opinion of the Chemed Moshe that it is enough if the Jew guarantees access to the non-Jew, even without giving him the key. Therefore, according to that more lenient opinion, it is enough to be available to the Rabbi's phone call and let the non-Jew in when he calls. Some want the actual key and alarm code in keeping with the stricter description of the Bach. It appears that the OP's contract is in fact lenient like the M\"B (C\"M), unless the owner is away. Then it wants the level proposed by the Bach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is not that you need to leave a key with the rabbi, but as the contract says, you are telling him how to get access to your house. Even in a regular situation (such as when you go on vacation) someone should have access to your house to bring in the mail, or handle emergencies. Consider a situation in which someone has left property in your house and you have guaranteed the owner access to his possessions.</p>\n\n\n",

Of course Adam didn't steal from anyone because for a certain period he was the only person who existed so who would he have stolen from?  Even if he \"stole\" from Chava and his children the stolen items would still exist in his family and be part of the family property.  Since all of mankind came from Adam, no one was a \"stranger\" to him but family. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the source for the Torah's lesson about not offering stolen animals doesn't seem to work.

As Yisroel Reisman writes, \"Rav Schwab (in Mayan Beis Hashoeva page # 242) explains, when we say not to bring a Korban that is stolen, the point is not the negative that something that is stolen is not appropriate for a Korban. That you indeed cannot learn from Adam. The point is that a person who brings a Korban gives up something that he owns. He takes something and he gives it away. (אָדָם כִּי-יַקְרִיב מִכֶּם). Adam brought something that was his. It is true that it was his. There can be no thought that it could be stolen as there was nobody else. That is not the point. The point is (אָדָם כִּי-יַקְרִיב מִכֶּם). A person who brings a Korban gives from that which is his, from that which he owns. </p>\n\n<p>This thought that the Chashivus, the importance of a Korban is that you are giving up something that is yours. Your sacrificing, a Korban is called a sacrifice. Kavayochel as if a person gives back to G-d. This idea that a Korban is giving up your own thing, fits well with what Poskim say in the B'air Heitev in Hilchos Arba Minim, that a person who can get a Cheftzah Shel Mitzvah for free, someone who offers him a free Lulav, someone who offers him free Matzah, someone who offers him any Mitzvah for free, should make some type of payment for it. (אָדָם כִּי-יַקְרִיב מִכֶּם) A person in doing a Mitzvah should entail some type of sacrifice, some type of giving something up in order to do the Mitzvah. That is not to say that you are not allowed to take something for free. But it is to say that in the Hashkafa of the Mitzvah a person should give up in something he has and that is the Drasha of (אָדָם כִּי-יַקְרִיב מִכֶּם). Give from something that is yours. \"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As you say, there was no possibility of Adam having stolen from another person, and that is the point.

However, it was also calculated. Since the calculations weren't binding in and of themselves, the testimony was made to align with the calculations by various methods.</p>\n<h1>Details</h1>\n<p>The new month was pre-calculated in that it couldn't be more than 30 days, and on the 31st day the previous month automatically became a 30-day month and the next month began. However, they wouldn't start a new month on the 30th day (thus making the previous month 29 days) without witnesses; if only the court saw it, they would bring people to testify for them.</p>\n<p>According to the Mishna (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h28.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana 3:1</a>, translating the most relevant parts):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ראוהו בית דין וכל ישראל--נחקרו העדים, לא הספיקו לומר מקודש, עד שחשיכה--הרי זה מעובר.  ראוהו בית דין בלבד--יעמדו שניים ויעידו בפניהם, ויאמרו מקודש מקודש.</strong>  ראוהו שלושה, והם בית דין--יעמדו שניים, ויושיבו מחבריהם אצל היחיד ויעידו בפניהם, ויאמרו מקודש מקודש:  שאין היחיד נאמן על ידי עצמו</p>\n<p>If the court and all of Israel saw it (the new moon), the witnesses were checked, but they didn't manage to say \"sanctified\" (making the previous month 29 days), it is a leap month.</p>\n<p>If only the court saw it, two should stand and testify before them, and they they say \"sanctified, sanctified.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether they actually verbally sanctified the new month if it was 29 days long or 30 days long is a matter of dispute (Mishna Rosh Hashana 2:8 and BT 24a). The anonymous Mishna says they would sanctify it whether or not they saw the moon on the 30th or 31st day; Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Tsadok says that it was automatically sanctified if it appeared on the 31st day, and there was no need to sanctify it; Plimo says they would <em>only</em> sanctify it if it appeared on the 31st day; and Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Shim'on says they wouldn't sanctify it at all.</p>\n<p>Rabban Gamliel had a tradition regarding the length of the month (BT 25a) and seems to have accepted witnesses whose testimony conformed to his calculations, even when their testimony was somewhat unreliable (Mishna 2:8). Similar to the case mentioned above where the court brings two people to testify for them. According to Rabbi Yehoshua son of Levi (20a), they would intimidate (מאיימין) the witnesses into extending the month (saying they didn't see the moon), but not into shortening it (saying they did see the month); Rabbi Yochanan used to teach also that they would intimidate them into shortening it.</p>\n<h1>Second Temple Period</h1>\n<p>As for the question of how much of this process was observed during the Second Temple period, I haven't really found a detailed source. The Mishna (2:5) mentions with regard to the place (בית יעזק) to which the witnesses came to testify:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בראשונה, לא היו זזים משם כל היום; התקין רבן גמליאל הזקן, שיהו מהלכין אלפיים אמה לכל רוח</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since this source quotes the <em>elder</em> Rabban Gamliel who lived in that period, I think it's clear that they accepted witnesses, but the source doesn't speak about calculations. However, the statement of Rabban Gamliel (the younger) in BT 25a that he had a family tradition regarding calculations (כך מקובלני מבית אבי אבא) may date to his ancestors from the Temple period.</p>\n<p>The Tosefta (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/f/f28.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:7</a>) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר' יהושע בן קרחה דברים אלו התקינן רבן יוחנן בן זכאי משחרב בית המקדש לכשיבנה הבית במהרה יחזרו דברים אלו ליושנם</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Korcha says: Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai enacted these things after the Temple was destroyed. When it will be built soon, things will return to the way they were.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given that this is said in the context of Rosh Chodesh (cf. Mishna 4:4), it might be that at least some of the practices relating to the New Moon started after the destruction of the Temple. It's not clear to me from this source exactly which.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>At the time where observing the moon was necessary to know the months of the year, poor weather conditions would simply delay calendrical events.

This is also the opnion of Rebbeinu Yeruchum and Tzror HaChaim (talmid haRashba). The Rashba answers that since the mitzvah does not have a known measurement it does not require a bracha.\nHowever ,it should be noted that the Meiri(Brachos end of first perek) brings an opinion that indeed one does make a bracha on the haggadah.</p>\n<p>There are more answers provided in the Haggadah of Rav Menachem Kasher- Haggada Shelima.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>By \"The Seder\" I think that you mean \nthe poem \"Kaddesh urchatz.\"\nThat poem was made as a memory aid so people would recall all the Mitzvos of the Seder. \nWe don't make a bracha on the memory aid.</p>\n\n<p>Kaddesh is a mitzvah and it is accomplished by saying the brachos on wine and kiddush.</p>\n\n<p>Urchatz, washing for the dipping of a vegetable, is a requirement for touching and eating a vegetable.

These are his words in his commentary the Haggada:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שתיקנו לומר על כוס רביעי פסוק שפוך חמתך על הגוים, הוא מפני כי לפי שקיימנו מצות ד' כוסות כנגד ד' כוסות של פורענות שעתיד הקדוש ברוך הוא להשקות לאומות העולם, אנו אומרים על כוס האחרון שיגיע אותו הזמן שישקה אותם ה' כוס חמתו הוא כוס התרעלה כדכתיב (איכה ד') שישי ושמחי בת אדום וכו' גם עליך תעבור כוס, ולא עוד אלא שעיקר גאולתינו תלויה בחורבן קרן מלכותם כדאמרינן בבראשית רבה (פרשה כ\"א) עד ערב בוקר אלפים ושלש מאות ונצדק קדש (דניאל ח'), אמר רבי יצחק כשיעשה ערב בקרן של אומות העולם אז ונצדק קדש, וכן הנביא אומר (ישעיה ס') כי הנה החשך יכסה ארץ וערפל לאומים ועליך יזרח ה' וכבודו עליך יראה במהרה בימינו אכי\"ר.</p>\n  \n  <p>And that which they arranged to say the verse of \"Pour thy wrath on the nations\" over the fourth cup is because we fulfilled the mitsvah of the four cups corresponding to the four cups of retribution that God will serve to the the nations of the world, so we remark upon the last cup that that time should arrive at which God will serve them his wrath...As it says (Lamentations 4) 'Be Happy and rejoice daughter of Edom etc. also upon you will the cup pass'. And furthermore, our primary redemption is dependent upon the destruction of the basis of their kingdom, as we say in Genesis Rabba (21)...And also the prophet says (Isaiah 60) 'For behold the the darkness will cover the land, and fog, the nations, and upon thee will God shine, and his glory will be seen on you', soon and in our days, amen, so it may be his will!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His colleague <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ben_Asher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Bahya</a> writes very similarly to his first explanation in his <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya,_Shemot.6.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus (6:8)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותקנו לנו רז\"ל לגמור את ההלל בכוס רביעי ולהתחיל בו: שפוך חמתך, והטעם בזה לפי שעתיד הקדוש ברוך הוא להשקות לרשעי העולם ארבע כוסות של פורענות, </p>\n  \n  <p>The rabbis established that we complete Hallel with a fourth cup, and to begin it: 'pour thy wrath', and the reason for this is that God will serve the wicked of the world four cups of retribution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explanation for the practice is suggested by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Chalava\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharam Halava</a> (Pesahim 99b) and stated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissim_of_Gerona\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Nissim of Gerona</a> (Rif Pesahim 19a). See also Meiri (Pesahim 99b). It is also stated by Ritva's mentor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_HaLevi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Aharon Halevi</a> as cited by Orehot Hayyim (Vol. I Seder Leil HaPesah: 32), and by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Abudirham\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abudirham</a> (commentary to Haggadah) who connect the verse to the cups of retribution, (although they don't specify the significance of the verse to that particular cup). Its origin seems to be the commentary of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_of_Worms\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eleazar of Worms</a> to the Haggada.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_ben_Zemah_Duran\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbats</a>, however, gives a different explanation: given the superstitious surrounding activities performed in pairs, the fourth cup: the second in the pair of pairs, was thought to invoke punishment. A prayer is therefore inserted at that point that the punishment should be directed instead at Israel's enemies. (Ma'amar Hamets 135):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונ\"ל טעם יותר מחייב היותו בזה הכוס [הרביעי] יותר מהאחרים לפי שהוא כוס רביעי. והשותה כפלים מתחייב בנפשו...לכן אנחנו אומרים שאין לנו בזה הכוס הרביעי דאגה מפורענות. והשם ישפוך חמתו על הגוים. לא עלינו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this is likely later addition to the Haggada, and is absent for example from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3509.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam's text</a>. It is, however, mentioned in the Seder Rav Amram Gaon, but this seems to be a later addition (see ed. Goldschmidt p. 118). For more on the history and reason for this practice, see <a href=\"http://shituf.piyut.org.il/story/3047\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/6337775/the_later_history_of_shfoch_chamatcha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My own suggestion regarding the implied violence, and the apparent origin of the practice in 12th century France, is that perhaps it was a response to the First and Second Crusades. (Although according to <a href=\"http://shituf.piyut.org.il/story/3047\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> the idea of connecting the last cup to the destruction of Jewish enemies is likely older, it seems quite likely to me that the addition of this verse, and the popularisation of the practice was prompted by the Crusades.)[i]</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9A\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Hayyim Bloch</a> suggested (see <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/6337775/the_later_history_of_shfoch_chamatcha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> page 220) adding the opposite request: that God pour forth his love on the righteous nations, besides for punishing the wicked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שפוך אהבתך על הגוים אשר ידעוך ועל ממלכות אשר בשמך קוראים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This change clearly highlights that only the wicked are being condemned.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, Bloch indicated that he found this in an earlier version, but he seems to have lied (ibid). For a lengthy discussion of Bloch and his forgeries, see <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2010/04/marc-shapiro-more-on-chaim-bloch.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As always CYLOR about whether you should say the common version, some variation, or omit it entirely.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] Interestingly, <a href=\"http://shituf.piyut.org.il/story/3047\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this source</a> connects the popularisation of the custom to migrations following the first crusade, but ignores my own suggestion; that the practice itself was a reaction to the crusade! </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What does it have to do with the exodus from Egypt?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is linked with V'hei sheomdah- Pesach is the time of all redemptions from oppression.

    "content": "# How is a Gentile's membership in a Table of Nations Gentile nation determined?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Genesis 10 (The Table of Nations), the Gentile nations that came from the descendants of Noah are enumerated \"after their generations, in their nations\". How is a Gentile's membership in a Gentile nation reckoned from the perspective of Judaism? For example, is a Gentile's national identity based on maternal lineage? Paternal lineage? Is it based on percentage of admixture (e.g. a Gentile that has three grandparents belonging to Dodanim and one belonging to Caphtorim would be considered a Dodanimite). Are Gentiles allowed to choose which of their ancestors to derive membership from (e.g. if a Gentile has a strong attachment to their father's mother's mother's mother's father, who was of Lud, then he can declare himself a member of Lud's nation too)? Are the rules of membership decided upon by the authorities of each individual nation considered binding on Judaism (e.g. the modern community of descendants of Magog has the prerogative to include or exclude Gentiles from their family as they see fit, and Jews are obligated to honor such internal family determinations)?</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, I have not been able to find very much information on how to locate or identify modern day officials or leaders of these nations.</p>\n\n<p>I am primarily interested in the <em>theory</em> of how this is, can be, has been done in times past, or could be done if only we still had (or could find) the right records rather than looking for a practical procedure to use to classify any specific modern-day Gentiles. For example, in the time of Abraham, Gentiles presumably had much better access (compared with today) to reliable geneologies linking them back to Noah, so there might have even been cases where someone's membership in a nation was formally documented, assessed, or tracked for some purpose.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As the comments have stated; Gentile ancestry is tribal, and therefore strictly paternally-traced as far as halacha is concerned. Halacha doesn't really care if someone's a Dudanite or Caphtorite; but it does matter if they're Ammonite, Moabite, Edomite, or Egyptian. Regardless, it follows the father.</p>\n\n<p>However it's kind of a moot point today, as we operate with the assumption that all the ancestral lines as of Moses' time have since been sufficiently mixed up that no one is a certified Ammonite, Moabite, or the like anymore.</p>\n\n<p>From Maimonides' Chapter 12 of Laws of Prohibited Relations:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Any non-Jew, should s/he convert and accept the mitzvot ... is a\n  full-fledged Jew ... and may marry into the Jewish mainstream, with\n  four exceptions: Amon, Moab, Egypt, and Edom -- a convert from these\n  nations is a full-fledged Jew except regarding marrying into the\n  Jewish mainstream.</p>\n  \n  <p>Amon and Moab -- their converts may never marry into the Jewish\n  mainstream ... however this only applies to a male convert marrying a\n  mainstream Jewish female; the reverse is permitted.</p>\n  \n  <p>Egyptian and Edomite -- male or female, the first two generations may\n  not marry into the Jewish mainstream.</p>\n  \n  <p>An Ammonite male convert who married an Egyptian woman, the\n  child is considered Ammonite; if an Egyptian male convert married a\n  Ammonite woman, the offspring is considred Egyptian. <strong>This\n  is the rule: the offspring with regards to non-Jewish nations always\n  follows the father.</strong> ...</p>\n  \n  <p>When Saneireb the King of Assyria rose to power, he mixed up all the\n  peoples and exiled them from their places. We assume that the\n  current-day residents of Egypt are different than the \"Egyptians\" of\n  the prohibition, and the same goes for today's Edomites in Edom. As\n  these four prohibited nations have been mixed up with the other\n  nations of the world, who have no prohibitions -- everything is\n  permitted, as if a single individual comes out of that mix and seeks\n  to convert, it assumed s/he came from the [permitted] majority.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Therefore, when a convert of any ancestry converts today</strong>, whether Edomite, Egyptian, Ammonite, Moabite, Kushite -- any nation at all --\n  male or female -- <strong>s/he may marry immediately into the Jewish\n  mainstream.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>יג  [יז] כל הגויים כולם, כשיתגיירו ויקבלו עליהן כל המצוות של תורה,\n  והעבדים, כשישתחררו--הרי הן כישראל לכל דבר, שנאמר \"הקהל, חוקה אחת לכם\"\n  (במדבר טו,טו); ומותרין להיכנס בקהל ה' מיד--והוא שיישא הגר או המשוחרר\n  בת ישראל, ויישא הישראלי גיורת ומשוחררת:  חוץ מארבעה עממין בלבד, והם\n  עמון ומואב ומצריים ואדום--שהאומות האלו, כשיתגייר מהן אדם--הרי הוא\n  כישראל לכל דבר, אלא לעניין ביאה בקהל.</p>\n  \n  <p>יד  [יח] וכיצד דינן:  עמון ומואב--איסורן איסור עולם, זכרים ולא נקבות: \n  שנאמר \"לא יבוא עמוני ומואבי . . .\" (דברים כג,ד).  והלכה למשה מסיניי,\n  שהעמוני הזכר והמואבי הזכר--הוא שאסור לעולם לישא בת ישראל, אפילו בן בן\n  בנו עד סוף העולם; אבל עמונית ומואבית, מותרת מיד כשאר האומות.</p>\n  \n  <p>טו  [יט] מצרי ואדומי, אחד זכרים ואחד נקבות--דור ראשון ודור שני, אסורין\n  לבוא בישראל; ודור שלישי מותר, שנאמר \"בנים אשר ייוולדו להם, דור שלישי\"\n  (דברים כג,ט).

One side says that we avoid certain melachot on chol hamo'ed, including donating. I was told that the tzorech gufo, needs of my body, in this case, are not emergent or imminently time sensitive and I could schedule the donation for another time.

Thus, both groups are given the issur of Avodah Zarah, for instance. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara challenges this premise based on the fact that Priah U'Reviah and Bris Milah were given to Benei Noach.

Does this mean that Benei Noach, pre-Sinai, were chayiv in Priah u'Reviah and Bris Milah?

It is also implied many places in the Gemara and Mishnah that the righteous are decreed for life and the wicked for death, for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי כרוספדאי אמר רבי יוחנן: שלשה ספרים נפתחין בראש השנה, אחד של רשעים גמורין, ואחד של צדיקים גמורין, ואחד של בינוניים. צדיקים גמורין – נכתבין ונחתמין לאלתר לחיים, רשעים גמורין – נכתבין ונחתמין לאלתר למיתה, בינוניים - תלוויין ועומדין מראש השנה ועד יום הכפורים. זכו – נכתבין לחיים, לא זכו – נכתבין למיתה.</p>\n<p>Three books are opened on Rosh Hashanah: one for the totally wicked, one for the totally righteous, and one for the intermediate.

Very few people fall into this category, and it's impossible to know with certainty if any particular individual does, even if they have committed the most heinous crimes.</p>\n\n<p>4) \"מיתה\" means a shortening of one's life from the length that had previously been decreed (Raavad, Rif).</p>\n\n<p>5) \"מיתה\" means that one loses the hashgacha/special attention/protection of God  and he/she becomes vulnerable to nature like an animal (Shu\"t Halachos Ketanos).</p>\n\n\n",

It certainly isn't the simple reading of the Passuk (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/9.10#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">9:10</a>), nor the approach taken by Chazal.  If so, it would not revert to ash. See for example, Ramban <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/9.9#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to 9:9</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיה לאבק על כל ארץ מצרים – על דעת, רבותינו (שמות רבה י׳:ו׳) היה מן הפיח ההוא אבק יורד על כל ארץ מצרים, והיה האבק ההוא כשיורד על האדם ועל הבהמה בכל ארץ מצרים מעלה בהן שחין ואבעבועות, כי היה חם שורף, ואולי היה הרוח מכניס אבק גם בבתים ואין ניצל ממנו, ונכון הוא. וכן ירד פעמים רבות בימי הבצורת כדמות אבק ברדת הטל, וכתיב (דברים כ״ח:כ״ד) יתן י״י את מטר ארצך אבק ועפר. וכן יתכן לומר על דרך הפשט כי פירוש והיה לאבק, שיהיה האבק אשר יעשה מן הפיח במקומו נותן שחין על כל ארץ מצרים, שהלקה את האויר לעשות כן וגזרת עליון היא.‏</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Avraham's ten tests and the miracles in Mitzraim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Avos d'Rebbi Nassan* 33 recounts that corresponding to Avraham's ten tests,<sup>1</sup> Hashem performed ten miracles for the Bnei Yisrael in Mitzraim<sup>2</sup> and struck the Mitzriim with ten makkos, and likewise He performed ten miracles for them at the Yam Suf<sup>3</sup> and struck the Mitzriim with ten makkos at the Yam Suf.<sup>4</sup></p>\n\n<p>Do any of the commentators explain the connection between Avraham's ten tests and these other lists of tens? Is there a 1:1 comparison between each of Avraham's tests and one of the miracles performed for his descendants in each circumstance?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Henceforth ADRN</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>The list presented in ADRN appears to be: (1) the command to go to Eretz Yisrael; (2) the ensuing famine there; (3) sending away Yishmael; (4) Akeidas Yitzchak; (5) sending away Hagar; (6) Sarah's abduction(s); (7) the war with the four kings; (8) the nevuah at the Bris Bein HaBesarim that his children would be slaves; (9) Ur Kasdim; and (10) Bris Milah.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>That is, that the Bnei Yisrael were shielded from the Makkos (Bartenura to Avos 5:4), and likewise in the next clause.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup>The list presented in ADRN is that Hashem made the ocean into (1) tunnels, (2) a plain, (3) divided parts, (4) mortar, (5) a desert, (6) fragments, (7) rocks, (8) dry land, (9) walls, and (10) flasks/fresh water, and it brings pesukim for each of them.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup>ADRN subsequently explains that Hashem used ten \"weapons\" against the Mitzriim, measure for measure to the weapons they used against the Yisraelim, and brings pesukim for each of them. They are: (1) a thundering voice; (2) a bow; (3) arrows; (4) swords; (5) lances; (6) shields; (7) bucklers; (8) spears; (9) hail; (10) fiery coals. I'm not sure how many were literal and how many were metaphorical.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2313290/jewish/Chapter-Five-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary of Likutei Sichos on chapter 5 of Pirkei Avos, with these specific snippets from chabad.org</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chapter Five: The world was created by means of ten [Divine]\n  utterances — According to the principles of Torah numerology, five\n  represents a level of G‑dliness above all limitation,1 while ten\n  reflects the structure of our finite, material world. <strong>The intent of\n  this chapter of Pirkei Avos is to reveal the G‑dliness which\n  transcends all limitation within the context of our material\n  existence.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>(Sefer HaSichos 5751, Vol. II, p. 772)\n  So first of all, the whole chapter, including the parts about Avraham and the miracles of the sea later, are to teach us how to serve Hashem beyond limitation, yet within limiation, see further.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ג - עֲשָׂרָה נִסְיוֹנוֹת נִתְנַסָּה אַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ וְעָמַד בְּכֻלָּם, לְהוֹדִיעַ כַּמָּה חִבָּתוֹ שֶׁל אַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ.\n3. Our Patriarch Avraham was tested with ten tests, and he withstood them all to show how great was our Patriarch Avraham’s love\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>[for G‑d].</p>\n  \n  <p>Ten tests — As mentioned, <strong>the number ten reflects the full scope of\n  our personal potential</strong>. Avraham showed his devotion to G‑d with every\n  dimension of his being.</p>\n  \n  <p>Ten tests... to show how great was our Patriarch Avraham’s love [for\n  G‑d] — The purpose of the tests which Avraham underwent — and of the\n  challenges which his descendants, each and every member of the Jewish\n  people, confronts — <strong>is to bring into expression a more powerful love\n  for G‑d</strong> [beyond limitations], as it is written:13 “G‑d... is testing you to see if you love\n  G‑d... with all your heart and with all your soul.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Patriarch Avraham — Avraham is described as אבינו, our Patriarch\n  (literally “our father”). Just as a father bequeaths his estate to his\n  descendants, Avraham bequeathed his spiritual legacy to the entire\n  Jewish people. <strong>His spiritual legacy empowers each of us, endowing us\n  with the strength to withstand the challenges we face in our divine\n  service.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>(Sichos Shabbos Parshas Chukas, 5737)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So this part goes together with the intro, that Avraham serving Hashem beyond all limitations of reason was a lesson for us all to serve him that way (that's the same idea of serving him in an unlimited way within the confines of nature).</p>\n\n<p>Next:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>ד - עֲשָׂרָה נִסִּים נַעֲשׂוּ לַאֲבוֹתֵינוּ בְּמִצְרַיִם, וַעֲשָׂרָה עַל הַיָּם, עֶשֶׂר מַכּוֹת הֵבִיא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>עַל הַמִּצְרִיִּים, בְּמִצְרַיִם, וְעֶשֶׂר עַל הַיָּם. עֲשָׂרָה\n  נִסְיוֹנוֹת נִסּוּ אֲבוֹתֵינוּ אֶת הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא\n  בַּמִּדְבָּר, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וַיְנַסּוּ אֹתִי זֶה עֶשֶׂר פְּעָמִים וְלֹא\n  שָׁמְעוּ בְּקוֹלִי.\n      4. Ten miracles were performed for our forefathers in Egypt, and ten at the Sea. The Holy One, blessed be He, brought ten plagues upon\n  the Egyptians in Egypt and ten at the Sea. Our forefathers subjected\n  the Holy One, blessed be He, to ten trials in the desert, as it is\n  stated: “By now they have tested Me ten times, and did not heed My\n  voice.”14</p>\n  \n  <p>Ten miracles were performed for our forefathers — Pirkei Avos is\n  intended to teach us pious conduct — <strong>how to serve G‑d beyond the\n  measure of the law.</strong> What lesson in pious conduct can we learn from\n  these points of history?</p>\n  \n  <p>This question can be answered as follows: The fact that G‑d wrought\n  miracles for the Jews in Egypt made the people aware of their true\n  identity. Although they were still in exile, <strong>the miracles made them\n  conscious that they were G‑d’s servants, rather than slaves of the\n  Egyptians.\n  ** \n  This is also true today. Although we are still in exile, we are G‑d’s\n  servants, and subject to no other authority. **Our commitment to Him\n  need not be limited in any way. On the contrary, just as miracles\n  represent a departure from nature, our commitment can rise above\n  ordinary mortal constraints.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>(Sichos Shabbos Parshas Nitzavim, 5738)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So as we can see, the entire idea of the whole chapter, and Avraham's tests, is to teach us how to serve Hashem beyond our limitations, and <strong>the same idea is expressed in the miracles</strong>, which are an expression of Hashem that's beyond nature.</p>\n\n<p>So the connection: both the \"10\" miracles of Egypt (which ten, as mentioend, represents how Hashem is complete even in this world) and the \"10\" tests if Avraham, both of them mentioned in chapter 5 which, as mentioned above, represents how Hasem is totally removed from the world (see the Sicha there for sources explaining why), are to teach us, and are inherently related to, the idea of serving Hashem beyond all limitations, but still bring that into the limitations of the world, like how to plagues wer miracles, beyond all limitation, but it affected them in a way that <strong>even in the limitations of exile</strong>, they were able to perceive Hashem, and the same is true of the 10 trials of Avraham, that Avraham showed that he served Hashem with his full human (/even natural) potential.</p>\n\n<p>So: the 10 tests of Avraham = Avraham's full (<strong>even</strong> natural) potential, and the 10 miracles in Egypt = Hashem's infinite revelation in a way that made <strong>even the Jews in exile still</strong>, aware of the greatness of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Both of the ideas represent how Hashem permeates even our natural/limited being. </p>\n\n\n",

Yes, it's true that the Rambam in the introduction to his commentary on Perek Chelek writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּכְשֶׁנִּתְקַלְקֵל לאדם יסוד מאלה היסודות – הרי יָצָא מן הכלל וכפר בעיקר. ונקרא \"מִין\" וְ\"אֶפִּיקוֹרוֹס\" וְ\"קוֹצֵץ בַּנְּטִיעוֹת\". וּמִצְוָה לְשׂוֹנְאוֹ וּלְאַבְּדוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: And when a Principle of these Principles is corrupted to a man, he has left the general community and has denied the fundamental. And he is called a heretic and an Apikoros and a chopper of shoots, and it is a mitzvah to hate him and destroy him.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook wrote in Igrot Hara'ayah pt. 1 (Igeret 138, pg. 170-171) about the proper outlook we should have in regards to people who have doubts about their faith or have completely gone of the derech:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...אם יחשוב...שראוי בזמן הזה לעזוב להפקר את אותן הבנים אשר סרו מדרכי התורה והאמונה על-ידי זרם הזמן הסוער...שלא זו הדרך אשר ה' חפץ בה. כשם שכתבו תוספות סנהדרין כ\"ו ע\"ב ד\"ה החשוד, דיש סברא לומר דלא יפסל חשוד על העריות לעדות משום דחשיב כמו אונס, משום דיצרו תוקפו וכה\"ג שכתבו כן תוספות גיטין מ\"א ע\"ב ד\"ה כופין, שכיון שהשפחה משדלתם לזנות חשיבי כאונסין, כן היא ה\"שפחה בישא\" של זרם הזמן...שהיא משדלת בכל כשפיה הרבים את בנינו הצעירים לזנות אחריה. הם אנוסים גמורים...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: ...If he [a teacher or parent] would think...that it is behooved of us in this age to abandon those sons that have gone of the paths of the Torah and the Emunah by the surging flow of the time...that is not is not the way that Hashem is interested in. As the Tosafot in Sanhedrin 26b \"Hachashud\" wrote: that there's an argument to be made that someone suspected of immorality will not be disqualified as a witness because he is thought be like a man who is coerced, because his Yetzer attacked him, and similarly wrote the Tosafot in Gittin 41b \"Kofin\", that because the [female] slave seduced them to immorality they are considered to be under coercion, so is she the \"bad [female] slave\" of the flow of time, that she seduces many of our young sons to be seduced after her...they are completely coerced...\"</p>\n\n<p>When a man (in particular in our day and ever since the Enlightenment Period) is turned away from faith because he is compelled by the general thoughts of the society that's around him, he can't be held accountable in the same way that a regular sinner/heretic is.</p>\n\n<p>And as it says in the Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.10a.29?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 10a</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isaiah said to him: Why do you involve yourself with the secrets of the Holy One, Blessed be He?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We don't really understand \"חשבונות שמיים\", all the calculations of Hashem. Do we know how a person's thought process works? Do we know how he reached the conclusion that he has doubts in his faith? Do we know what he went through in life? We do not. And therefore cannot simply say that one person is more pious than the other. Only Hashem knows what is in our hearts.</p>\n\n<p>How this translates in Halacha, though, I don't know.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p><strong>1. The OP asks how this comparison would work Halachically?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The simple answer seems to be that the question is not a Halachic one. Halachah is the body of laws that tell a Jew how to behave in thought speech and deed. Halachah usually does not comment on comparing people in judgment in the eyes of Hashem. If it does, it would only be in passing as concerns a Halachah. For instance, one who violates the Sabbath publicly or worships idols would not be accepted to ritually slaughter kosher meat. Someone who wore a suit made of wool and linen, could still slaughter kosher meat. Doubting the resurrection of the dead, etc. does not seem to have such a Halachic effect.</p>\n\n<p>Halachah would simply say that a Jew should both believe properly and act properly without sacrificing either goal. :)</p>\n\n<p>This is more of a question on Hashkafah (Jewish moral outlook) and Kabbalah (The secret system of how Hashem runs the universe etc.).</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. The OP also asks if this man with doubts who performs mitzvos would be lesser or more pious in the eyes of Hashem than one who believes but lacks as much observance.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The answer is that no person could really be the spokesman for G-d on this one. Tehillim 33:15 is quoted by Chazal regarding the day of judgment. It says that Hashem is the one who fashions all hearts and understands all the deeds (of mankind). </p>\n\n<p>Hashem takes everything into consideration when judging a man. This includes his upbringing, opportunities in life, conditions of life, his intelligence, ability etc. Therefore, even two people who equally doubted the resurrection of the dead but observed the laws, would be judged differently! It all depends on each person's abilities and challenges. One man eats pork while another man comes late to prayer. Who is better? The answer is that no one knows. It depends on each person's level. You may wish to read Rav Dessler's \"Michtav M'Eliyahu\", where he discusses each man's \"Nekudas HaBechirah\". That is a discussion on each man's level of free choice regarding different challenges.</p>\n\n<p>So the answer is that we really do not know.</p>\n\n<p>But, in general, Pirkei Avos ch. 1:17 (quoting Rabban Gamliel's son Shimon) does say that the main thing is the \"deed\" (not the \"learning\"). Man can certainly struggle with the whys and whats of Judaism intellectually. However, it is the disciplined man who acts properly that trumps knowledge by itself. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Finally, 3. it seems to me that the OP is implying that it wants to know what is \"so bad\" about doubting the resurrection from the dead and other Messianic age promises or; at least, we could intimate that the OP wants to know \"how bad is it\" to have doubts about this? (in Judaism)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tehillim 92:7, \"An unrefined man <strong>does not know</strong>, and a fool <strong>does not know</strong> <strong><em>this</em></strong>...\"</p>\n\n<p>Why does the pasuk repeat the example? Why does a boor simply \"not know\" but a fool doesn't know \"this\"??</p>\n\n<p>Two men enter for a tour of the cockpit on a jetliner. Neither man has any background in aviation. One sees all the buttons and dials and says simply: \"WOW\"! The fool, sees the same thing, and notices a big fat green button on the ceiling. He asks: \"Why is that green button there?\" The pilot laughs. \"..And the rest of the buttons and dials....you have no problem with? Is it just the green one overhead that looks out of place to you?\"</p>\n\n<p>The fool doesn't know \"this\". The truth is, he doesn't know anything. :) If he has no problem with the other buttons, then he should have no problem with the green one either.</p>\n\n<p>So our pious Jew in the OP example understands and believes everything? The creation of the world, the 10 plagues, the splitting of the sea, the fire descending on Mt. Carmel by Elijah, The Jews surviving Haman, Antiochus, and Hitler, then thriving as a nation today, and returning to the land of Israel etc. etc., ...<em>these</em> he has no question on. G-d can do anything. But G-d can't, or won't, return a pile of dust to life? He will not tame a lion so that it won't eat a lamb? He can't convince some people to believe in Him? <strong>\"This\"</strong> is the issue??</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Sanhedrin, chapter Cheilek, 91a: A certain heretic once said to Geviah ben Pesissah (a Rabbi): \"If even the living must die, then the dead should certainly remain dead!\" Geviah answered: \"If people who never existed can live, then people who once lived can certainly live again!\"</p>\n\n<p>The mistake the example pious Jew in the OP is making is a lack of \"emunah\". The particular lack is that he never internalized the fact that Hashem created and runs the world from nothing to what we see here, today, constantly. </p>\n\n<p>Hashem made a world from nothing. There is no reason to believe that anything created by Hashem should be able to be destroyed? Yet things die and break. That is a miracle and Hashem's guidance. So too, when He decides to resurrect the dead, it will be a miracle and His guidance. How did He make dirt live? The same way he made nothing into dirt, and dirt into Adam.</p>\n\n<p>Lions decided to eat flesh instead of grass. Cows eat grass instead of flesh. Why? Hashem designed it so. If lions start eating grass instead? Hashem decided so.</p>\n\n<p>People who worship idols or don't believe in any religion, now lack the knowledge or stimulus to change. G-d will increase knowledge and revelation to the world; then, more people will believe.</p>\n\n<p>His bank account was at 1 million and now it is down to seventy five thousand. Now, it will go back up to ten million. Why? G-d runs his bank account.</p>\n\n<p>This is what needs to be internalized as a first step in understanding \"emunah\" (trust and faith in Hashem). The person proposed in the OP lacks an understanding of simple \"emunah\". That is how bad the problem is. I think that once a person understands this and internalizes it, the problem is solved.</p>\n\n<p>A chasid once had the following conversation with the Tzemach Tzedek (3rd Lubavitcher Rebbe).</p>\n\n<p>Chasid: Rebbe, I have doubts in Faith.</p>\n\n<p>Rebbe: So what, who cares.</p>\n\n<p>Chasid: But Rebbe! I am a Jew!</p>\n\n<p>Rebbe: Oh OK. If so, then there is no problem. :)</p>\n\n<p>If the guy goes to shul and offers \"honor\" service to Hashem, but has doubts. Then there is a lack of real \"emunah\". If the Jew cries out that he believes Hashem controls his life and the world and wants to see Hashem in his life...then the doubts are already answered.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Marc B. Shapiro explains in his book The Limits of Orthodox Theology, that Jews can believe whatever they want so long as they observe the rabbinical enactments as the rabbis explained them.</p>\n\n<p>thus, surprising as it may sound, such a person would be right to have doubts. The world functions according to the laws of nature. G-d does not interfere with these laws which the Bible calls \"Very good.\" </p>\n\n<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that Maimonides probably understood Judaism better than anyone. For example, he explains in his “Code of Jewish Laws, Laws of Kings 11:3,” that there is no such thing as miraculous messiah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Do not think that the messianic king must perform miracles and\n  wonders, bring new things into being, revive the dead, or perform\n  similar feats as foolish people believe.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In 12:1, he continues,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Do not think that in the messianic age, things will be different, or\n  the laws of nature will change. Rather, the world will continue in\n  familiar ways.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, Maimonides says that the messianic age will be a natural period. </p>\n\n<p>A rational approach to the messiah and messianic age is to understand them as a gradual evolutionary process. When the biblical prophets spoke about the “end of days,” or “the messianic age,” they had this in mind. When Isaiah described lions lying with sheep and beating swords into plowshares, he was speaking figuratively and poetically about all countries working together to improve themselves and society. </p>\n\n<p>The Bible does not speak about a messiah (mesheach) arriving miraculously to save the world. Instead, the Bible says that if you act well, all will be well. People should work to create such an age rather than rely on miracles.</p>\n\n\n",

R' Shimon does not mention anywhere that the reason for the Torah's decree against adultery is simply to avoid issues of lineage, child support, or honoring parents. Nowhere in Shas or Poskim does such a suggestion exist. The Sefer HaChinuch (and the Moreh Nevuchim as well) may give certain reasons in logic for certain mitzvos. That does not mean that their Halachic stance was to espouse an opinion that the act would be permitted if those reasons no longer applied.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Torah itself does in fact give one reason. Bamidbar 5:11-13 \"Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: Should any man's wife go astray <strong>and deal treacherously with him</strong> and a man lie with her carnally, but it was hidden from her husband's eyes, but she was secluded and <strong>she became defiled</strong>[with the suspected adulterer] and there was no witness against her, and she was not seized.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Torah calls it \"treachery\" and \"defiled\".

May a child be allowed to perform such forbidden transactions such as \"ribbis or ona'ah\" in a game as far as chinuch is concerned? </p>\n\n<p>Q2. Can Monopoly game events/transactions (or any game), be ruled upon by Halachah at all, since it is not a real transaction or event? (except for chinuch concerns)</p>\n\n<p>Q3. We might assume that the fact people devote time and take a game seriously by assigning some emotional or real sentimental value (\"I care about winning.\"), grants it an aspect of \"real life\" so that Halachah applies to its function.

If we do say Halachah even has an opinion on two Jews selling \"Boardwalk\" to each other in a \"serious\" game of Monopoly, would Halachah view it as a real estate transaction or a simple transaction of a blank paper marker.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: This is only being answered if the stakes are limited to winning or losing the game. If the stakes of the game involve winning a \"prize\" such as real life cash currency being given to the winner, then the answer may be different.

Ribis applies only between Jews. </p>\n\n<p>In Yeshivah, I remember hearing a story where the Brisker Rav was asked (when he was a child) if he was going to eat on Yom Kippur? He said: \"Yes\". He was then asked if he was going to make Kiddush? He said: \"No. Because I am only required to do so for chinuch. Chinuch is so that when I grow up, I will do the real mitzvah. But, when I grow up, I will fast on Yom Kippur. Therefore I will never make Kiddush in this case for real. So, I do not need to worry about it for chinuch now.\"</p>\n\n<p>Here, the fantasy transaction is selling real estate and paying ribbis to a Gentile bank. The Jewish child playing this will simply grow up to believe that its OK to charge what he feels like for real estate and transact with banks on interest. Chinuch checks to see what allowing the child to do now will cause him to do in the future. Since these transactions (if real) would be permitted, then they are certainly permitted within a fantasy setting, even if the papers traded are not really real estate, and even if the guy running the bank is a fellow Jewish player in the game. This is because the \"fantasy\" declares them to be Real Estate and the \"Bank\" is really nobody in the game.</p>\n\n<p>However, a certain case that may be different, would be if the game requires a player to \"steal\" something. For instance, \"stealing\" the Afikomen is a custom forbidden by many Jewish groups/families (such as minhag Chabad) because it teaches the child that stealing is OK. This is true even though no actual theft is taking place at all according to Halachah. If the child grows up, he may think that grabbing someone's item is OK under certain conditions and theft doesn't matter so much (like the Afikomen).</p>\n\n<p>A2. But, other than chinuch, it appears that a game's transactions do not fall under Halachic consideration at all. This is because the purchase of a fake item for fake money is not worth a shaveh prutah. Halachah does not recognize a transaction less than a shaveh prutah. And even if you will say that breaking Torah Law applies to things worth less than a shaveh perutah too; (its just not enforceable as damages; but it is still forbidden to steal less than a perutah.) here, the transaction is worth zero. So, it is even worse. It is defined as nothing or a non-event. Monopoly money buys nothing of value in reality. The transaction is not even worth \"zero\" since within a short time, it will all go back into the owner's box and be deleted as if it never happened. This is comparable to being less than stealing someone's chametz on Pesach or his avodah zarah tree. It is truly a less than non-event with no meaning in Halachah at all.</p>\n\n<p>But maybe you will say that the \"emotional value\" a player assigns to winning or deal-making has value in Halachah? The Gemara in the first perek of Kiddushin says that a man could marry a woman by \"dancing in front of her\" because the entertainment (enjoyment value) is worth a perutah to the woman. If so, why can't a player's emotional investment in a game be worth a shaveh perutah too? If it is worth it, then maybe Halachah does apply to these game transactions?</p>\n\n<p>IMHO, its not true. The woman is accepting entertainment value in exchange for a marriage kinyan in reality. The player who plays Monopoly is indulging in entertainment for the sake of pure entertainment. The player is trading \"zero\"\n in exchange for another \"zero\". (Even if some people take entertainment seriously, it is still merely entertainment.(As we said, no prize of real money is at stake.)) Therefore, it has no value in real terms and transactional Halachah should not apply. </p>\n\n<p>Also, even if the \"serious player's investment of emotion\" does grant value; it still doesn't matter. This is because the \"serious player\" has already assumed that all transactions within the game will follow game rules as they appear on the box instructions or as invented by the players. (That's what makes him serious. :) ) And Monopoly instructions allow for ribbis and ona'ah all the way! In fact, if you would tell the player that he cannot charge what he wants, his game investment will lose value! (dissapointment)</p>\n\n<p>Also, the player is in essence assuming all game \"property and coin\" is always in a state of perpetual \"hefker\"(ownerless) and agrees to it being utterly worthless as it truly is, vis a vis reality so as to be able to run the game according to its fanatasy rules regardless of Torah transactional Law in real life. That's why it is not possible to be a problem case of \"masneh al mah shekasuv baTorah\" .(It is usually forbidden to enter a transaction on condition that the parties agree its OK to violate the Torah Law about it) This is because the Torah has nothing to prohibit here in such a case of hefker. </p>\n\n<p>Two proofs that (hint) tell me this is the case (the transactions in Monopoly are Halachically null):</p>\n\n<p>First, the above Afikomen example. Poskim seem to be silent on outright forbidding people to steal the Afikomen (only some minhag forbids it for chinuch), even though real situations always arise where kids grab it from each other and from parents. </p>\n\n<p>Second, the Gemara in Rosh Hashannah describes pigeon races and dice games of chance (even for money) as \"asmachta lo kanya\". The bets have no effect, since reliance upon chance games cannot cause a kinyan (transaction). So, games of chance cannot be taken seriously. This is where real money is at stake. How much more so in the case of the OP, where nothing tangible is at stake. Therefore, all Monopoly transactions are mere \"asmachta\" where they breathe. They never took place anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, to illustrate the point perfectly, relying on the above reasoning:</p>\n\n<p>If a person were to play an online multi-player dungeon game where different real people sign up and create characters with gold and inventory etc. It would be perfectly OK by Torah Law, to have your \"thief\" character pickpocket other players and transfer their gold or items to your inventory. This is true even if it causes emotional pain to a player who would now have to go out and spend real life time killing 20 more monsters to replace the stolen \"gold\".</p>\n\n<p>So too, a Jewish player may make a treaty not to attack a fellow player's territories in RISK for three turns. He may then immediately attack him one turn later! He has not violated any Torah Law.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, under A1. (Chinuch) this may be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>A3. Finally, even if you disagree with my A2 above:</p>\n\n<p>You would be claiming that Torah Law has recognized Monopoly transactions to be elevated to some form of reality. (which IMHO is vehemently not true)</p>\n\n<p>IMHO, The fantasy rules of Monopoly assume that the pieces of paper are not \"pieces\" but rather represent real estate transactions. Monopoly also assumes that the \"Bank\" is nobody. Therefore, the people making the transactions are <strong>invested in the fantasy</strong> that the items bought and sold function as real estate. They also understand that the \"Bank\" is not a Jew. So the Torah would address its application to the fantasy investment of the players because that is the definition of the \"real value\" here. </p>\n\n<p>So, even here, Halachah would say there is no ona'ah by real estate (you can charge whatever you want for Boardwalk) and there is no prohibition of interest, since the Bank is not a Jew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>(original post) In a game like Monopoly, <strong>where the \"money\" is absolutely worthless</strong>, would charging ribbis (interest)... be permissible?</p>\n\n<p>[Answer] Since halacha clearly states that the prohibition of ribbis applies even when dealing with values of less than a prutah, and since the Monopoly money does have a value, albeit little value, (as when one purchases a new set of monopoly money from the game company), there may be a problem of ribbis even when using monopoly money.\nSince the value of the Monopoly bills is not the \"face value\" of each bill, but rather the value of the bill as an item, If one player lent another player any amount of bills (amount as per count of bills, not of face value) and he receives in return a larger amount of bills than he lent, this would constitute a prohibition of ribbis, since he is receiving a greater value of return then the value which he lent.\nBased on this, there can be an interesting situation of ribbis with Monopoly money: If player A lent player B two Monopoly \"100 dollar bills\" and later Player B repaid player A the loan by giving him four \"50 dollar bills\", although at face value he did not pay back any more than he received, he would still have given ribbis. This is because with Monopoly money which has no real currency value the value is the cost of the bill and not its face value. (as opposed to legal tender currency, which even if the bills themselves have physical value, we only pay attention to the face value when considering questions of ribbis.)</p>\n\n<p>One may argue that the players don't actually own their money during the game, so the \"lending\" of money from one player to another may not be considered a loan at all, and thus the laws of ribbis would not apply. Yet, since the game belongs to one particular party, and all the players are essentially borrowing the game parts which they use while playing the game, we could look at it as the lending player has borrowed the \"money\" from the game's owner, and then lent it to the other player. Even though the lender is not the original owner of the bills, since they are in his possession at the time, and he lends them to the borrowing player if the borrower repays more bills then he borrowed this would be ribbis.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this is only the case with items which are borrowed with intent to return other items of the same kind, as opposed to items which are borrowed with the intention of returning the same item which was taken. In same item loans, one may return more than was taken.</p>\n\n<p>I Learned this from my Rebbe Rav Pinchos Vind of Yerushalayim. He is the author of Sefer Bris Pinchas and other ribbis related works, and is the Rosh Bais Hora'ah Bris Pinchos, which is specifically for ribbis related Shailos. He also runs a Ribbis Hotline for questions on the subject of ribbis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If one assumes halacha applies to imaginary situations such as board games, where the money and property are truly worthless and nobody actually takes possession of the cards, there are still a couple factors to consider:</p>\n<p>If we pretend that the property exists, then this would be ona’ah on karka and not chozer bediavad (CM 227:29). After all, the cards are merely deeds to properties.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the actual prices of the properties are explicit on the board, so one could easily formulate a tenai to sell the property by saying “I bought it for $60, but because I see you really need it, I’ll sell it to you for $200 on condition that you don’t claim ona’ah.” which would successfully evade the issur ona'ah.

What did she do wrong? She was having a pleasant life, possibly married with a family of her own (see Rashi to v.10, from Kiddushin 21b).

The crux of my argument is that if you don't mean to refer to the deity (like you refer to Nike the shoe, not Nike the Greek god), then it's less of a problem. Also, if people don't even realize that it's the name of a god (like Mumbai, the city formerly known as Bombay or the month of April--an alternate name for the Greek goddess Aphrodite), it's also permitted. Also, if you write the name instead of say it, there are more poskim who are lenient. Also, when you say the name of an Avodah Zarah in the context of learning (like if you were to verbally ask the question that I am answering), then Rabbeinu Tam according to many sources would allow it. And certainly if it is the the name of an Avodah Zarah that appears in Tanach, it is permitted to say.</p>\n\n\n",

The House of Shammai say that the wicked in gehinnom are released after they cry out to God. The House of Hillel say that the wicked are no longer punished after 12 months, and are spread under the legs of the righteous. The continuation (which might be from the House of Hillel, or possibly a later anonymous addition) is that certain people are punished such that \"hell is finished and they are still not finished.\"</p>\n\n<p>Since Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, who was of high standing at the time of the destruction of the Temple (70 CE), was \"the least of Hillel's students\" (Sukka 28a), I think this can safely be dated to the first century.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There certainly was the idea that Jewish souls are immortal, but there also were conditions, especially in the Temple Periods, but also after, though they were progressively less strict. These two concepts seem paradoxical, so let me explain. Since the original sin, the divine soul (which is separate from the animating soul present in all creations, progressively more evident from the inanimate to life forms and from there to the higher life forms) was split into many base souls, which can further be split into pieces, and those into pieces, ad infinitum.The goal of the split is for each piece (which is placed in a Jew) to collectively fulfill the goal of the base soul. Note: The following is a point of contention among the early commentators, but your question is a good one and I won't shy away from telling you one of the most prominent opinions. It is also the harshest.(Generally, when Jews approach a disagreement such as this, they accept every opinion as true in some way, just that the whole truth is not known to anyone. This is a disagreement in the philosophy of crime and punishment and therefore serves to make Jews be more steadfast in the service of G-d. This type of teaching, which is useful on the path to repentance, is known as <em>mussar</em>: Each piece can be destroyed totally, preventing the identity of that Jew from reaching the afterlife or being resurrected. They will simply be gone, not sent to purgatory.) However, according to all opinions, the base souls will remain, because the splits are more akin to smaller lamps lit from a central source than a fragmentation of substance; splitting doesn't detract from the central flame. Most of this is in or derived from Maimonides.     </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who can witness the sale of chametz?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Our shul's practice (which I imagine is very common) is for members of the community to appoint the rabbi as their agent for selling chametz. The rabbi then sells everything to a local priest, along with storage space where the chametz is located. The sale is also witnessed by two Jewish men of good standing in the community.</p>\n\n<p>A question came up as to whether someone who has appointed the rabbi as his agent can be a valid witness to the sale. I know that in other situations there are sometimes restrictions on who can be a witness (e.g., relatives are not valid witnesses for a ketubah). It seems suspicious to me that one who has an interest in the contract would also be a witness.</p>\n\n<p>How would this work in a small community, where essentially everyone appoints the rabbi and it would be difficult to find two independent witnesses? Would the witnesses need to make their own sales separately?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>From Rambam Hilchot Mechirah 1:2:</p>\n\n<p>\"If, however, the purchase is completed through one of the media by which property is transferred, the purchaser acquires the object.

At the sale, he asked only that the witnesses to each rabbi's sale have no relatives among the sellers in another rabbi's congregation. The witnesses were mostly other rabbis who were waiting to sell their own congregation's leaven; for the most part, they all seemed to be friendly with each other.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This answer can be improved. I do not have enough time now.</p>\n\n<p>Short answer:</p>\n\n<p>According to both Jewish Law and American Law (as far as I know) a sale is legally binding as long as there was a meeting of the minds (true agreement) and an exchange of consideration (payment) and an execution (kinyan-transaction took place). </p>\n\n<p>Witnesses are not needed for a financial transaction to be valid and binding on the parties. Witnesses serve to enforce the truth of the contract/sale in case of a dispute. (An exception would be Jewish marriage where witnesses actually effect the marriage event. Without witnesses to a marriage, it didn't take place in Jewish Law). The sale of chametz is a simple financial issue and no witnesses are needed to accomplish the sale, Jewish or Gentile.</p>\n\n<p>The use of witnesses at all, is an extra measure to give pomp, ceremony, and decorum to the transaction. It creates the air of official business. This is done because the Jewish Rabbis of Europe (from about the 1500's to 1900's) were divided about the truth of any such large scale transaction/sale of a community's chametz to Johnny Gentile. Many Rabbis said the whole thing is a scam. Johnny doesn't want the bread nor does he have the funds required to buy it all. The Jews don't know what they are selling and what they are being paid. The Gentile defaults every year like clockwork and receives a bottle of wine from the Rabbi. Its a joke! So the objection was that such sales are a mere charade of a formality. Many Jews today will not rely on selling chametz to a Gentile in order to buy it back after Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer was the main Rabbi who voiced the opinion that all such sales are definitely valid. Many Rabbis and communities follow this opinion because as long as the transaction was made properly, it works..period.</p>\n\n<p>However, in deference to the objectors who would cast doubt on such sales, many things are done to show it is in fact a real business deal. Witnesses bolster this viewpoint.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, they would only be needed if someone disputed the transaction after the fact. If that would happen, the two witnesses could surrender their share in the transaction. This sacrifice would allow them  to testify in a Jewish court (Rambam hilchos Edus). An American court would still accept their testimony anyway but the judge would take their position in the deal into consideration when hearing their testimony and cross examination.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.

I know there. <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/m/holidaya.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Jewfaq\">Jewfaq</a> states that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chametz includes anything made from the five major grains (wheat, rye, barley, oats and spelt) that has not been completely cooked within 18 minutes after first coming into contact with water. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If one was able to make fresh pasta and then cook it in under 18 minutes, would it still be chametz? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Wheat (assuming that is what your pasta is made of) is <strong>usually</strong> processed by spraying or/and soaking the grains of wheat in water (tempering) for a few hours before being sent to grind into flour. This soaking process (longer than 18 minutes) causes us to treat it as chametz. (See Talmud Pesachim 40b and Shulchan Aruch O.C. 467:2 with Mishnah Berurah 453:24)</p>\n\n<p>This is done so the bran becomes stronger and can be easily removed.</p>\n\n<p>Depending upon the condition of the wheat after contacting water, it may be considered certainly chametz, or probably chametz. So, we could not make pasta out of it for Passover.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the grains were dry, today's processing of pasta is made by combining semolina wheat, with warm water and processing it together, then drying it and sending it as dry packaged noodles to the supermarket. So you guessed it folks...its already chametz on that account.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you guard the grain from water from when it is cut, and make it into dry flour yourself, we are not allowed to cook it in hot water as hot water will make it become chametz much faster. (see Shulchan Aruch 454). I believe there were ancient experts who knew how to make the fire so hot that the water was \nconstantly at a rolling boil. They would then drop in some flour/dough that would cook sort of instantly. This would beat the leavening time and it could never become leavened. However, the Rambam writes that (since the Geonim c.700CE) Jews have always avoided this risk on Passover.</p>\n\n\n",

The Oral Torah only changes under very limited circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Background: According to all opinions, the Written Torah (i.e. the Sefer Torah on klaf, the Chumash, 5 Books of Moses) was received directly from Hashem, and is the same as the one we have today. All Sifrei Torah in existence from all parts of the Jewish people, including areas which were not in contact with each other for millenia, match with the exception of some questionable חסר\\מלא readings (vowels) and one question of an א vs. a ה (the verse פצוע דקה\\דקא). Both Maimonides in his 13 Principles and Rav Yosef Albo (who attacks Maimonides for having so many Principles) in <em>Sefer HaIkkarim</em> consider acceptance of the legitimacy/inerrancy of the Written Torah as a core tenet of Judaism. </p>\n\n<p>The Written Torah empowers the Sages to decide questionable cases in halacha in Deuteronomy 17:8: \"When a matter of judgement is too difficult for you, between blood and blood, between law and law, you shall stand up and go up to the place which Hashem your God has chosen.\" The Sanhedrin of 70 Sages was established by Moshe, and decides cases by majority rule (Exodus 23:2). A centralized Sanhedrin remained in operation through the end of the period of the Gemara, circa 500CE, and the decisions of that Sanhedrin are binding on all Jews (Maimonides, Preface to the Code). The Sanhedrin was also empowered to enact Rabbinical decisions to strengthen and protect the borders of Torah Law (Deuteronomy 17:1). During history, the Sanhedrin occasionally made new enactments (mentioned several places in the Gemara) and rarely even changed its mind, which it can only do if it is greater in wisdom and numbers than the prior court (Eduyot 1:5).</p>\n\n<p>After the end of the period of the Gemara, due to political changes, for approximately 1000 years Jewish communities were largely out of touch with each other. Initially communities outside of Babylon remained in touch with the central yeshivot of the Geonim and received halachik instruction from them, but in the Middle Ages communication broke down further and individual Rabbonim in local communities decided questions and wrote works of commentary, novellae, and responsa. The Gemara itself does not always resolve questions conclusively, and many different halachik traditions developed - some of which may reflect differences between Babylonian and Israeli Jewry, or other differences which predate the sealing of the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>In the early 16th century, Rabbi Yosef Karo (in Turkey and then Tzfat) attempted to consolidate all opinions of major authorities (<em>Rishonim</em>, \"the prior ones\") in his monumental work <em>Beit Yosef</em>, then decide all questions by going after the majority. At the same time in Krakow, Rabbi Moshe Isserles (\"the Rema\") was writing a similar work which codified Ashkenazi opinion, but instead based on the opinion of the most recent authorities, on the grounds that they had seen and considered any prior opinions. Rabbi Karo (\"The Mechaber\"),  published his work first in concise form, the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (\"set table\"), and it was accepted as definitive by North African and Middle Eastern Jews. The Rema published his work as a commentary to the Shulchan Aruch, and it too was accepted by Ashkenazi Jews. As a result, both groups ended up studying the same unified work, which gained thereby universal standing (with some exceptions). </p>\n\n<p>There are some exceptions to this: during the same period, another major Ashkenazi authority, Rabbi Shlomo Luria (\"Maharshal\") rejected both approaches in favor of deciding halacha based on pure logic. Many of the Maharshal's rulings (which seem to always be stringencies) were incorporated into later commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch, which proliferated, sometimes arguing with the Machaber and Rema, sometimes considering new cases. A large group of Yemenite Jews accepted Maimonides as their authority during his lifetime, and continue to act only in accordance with his rulings to this day. More recently, students of the Yeshivat Brisk reject the basis of the Mechaber and Rema's concept of deciding between Rishonim, and attempt to fulfill all opinions.</p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, conducting oneself in accordance with a given opinion is a vow. An individual who accepts a stringency may be able to nullify that vow; a community cannot do so (see R'Moshe Feinstein, OC 2.21 & 4.34, YD 1.13 & 2.15). In addition, authorities will not argue on other authorities who predate their own period (i.e. authorities today can argue, but they do not argue with Rishonim). As a result, precedent in Halacha is largely binding, even if in theory there would be both reason and space to look at a given issue in a different light and reach different conclusions. Cases of mistake or mistaken acceptance of practice (\"I thought everyone kept this stringency!\") are more readily nullified.</p>\n\n\n",

It must be noted, though, that Iruy is a\n  lesser form of kashering and is usually not considered an acceptable\n  process for utensils.</p>\n  \n  <p>Although he did qualify his resolution, stating that it is proper not\n  to eat any Chametz within 24 hours before Pesach, and to drink a hot\n  cup of water (hotter than usual) prior to the onset of Pesach, still,\n  he felt that even so, a proper oral cleaning would still be\n  halachically sufficient.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, what was the name of our erudite scholar?

Gas stations are extremely thin margin (they tell me it's less than a penny a gallon) so the only place that money can come from is higher prices, and consumers are extremely price sensitive and bad at evaluating value.

On <em>Shabas</em> which is <em>rosh chodesh</em>, someone says the <em>Shabas</em> addition in <em>birkas hamazon</em> (grace after the meal) but omits the <em>rosh chodesh</em> addition. (The case is actually more closely circumscribed than that; see e.g. :20.) Some say he must repeat <em>birkas hamazon</em> because he was required to eat and thus say <em>birkas hamazon</em>, which he didn't do properly, and others says he need not and thus must not repeat <em>birkas hamazon</em> because his requirement to eat didn't stem from its being <em>rosh chodesh</em>. Because of the difference of opinion, the <em>Aruch Hashulchan</em> concludes: \"a doubt about benedictions — be lenient\" and don't repeat <em>birkas hamazon</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">490</a>:2 and :5, he says as follows: Someone who omits the <em>chol hamoed</em> addition to <em>birkas hamazon</em> should not repeat <em>birkas hamazon</em>; and, on <em>Shabas</em> which is <em>chol hamoed</em>, someone who omits the <em>chol hamoed</em> addition but says the <em>Shabas</em> addition should repeat <em>birkas hamazon</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Why is that latter case different from the <em>rosh chodesh</em> case?

The Magen Avraham seems to say that this is a machloket rishonim {and BY says cites SMG and Kol Bo against RMBM and Rabenu Yerucham and the SA stated as Rambam that fruits mealvis enough} if chol hamoed is equivalent to Rosh Chodesh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bet Yosef 188:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם חל  <strong>ר\"ח בשבת והזכיר של שבת ולא של ר\"ח היה אומר ה\"ר יוסף שאין מחזירין</strong> וכו' כ\"כ המרדכי שם ובהגהות מרדכי פ\"ב דשבת כ' שתי הסברות  <strong>ודעת הרשב\"א בפרק שלשה שאכלו כדעת ה\"ר יחיאל דכיון דע\"כ אכיל אפי' טעה בשל ר\"ח מחזירין אותו</strong>: ב\"ה ולענין הלכה נקטינן כה\"ר יוסף דספק ברכות להקל:‏</p>\n<p>There is an additional machloket, when R.

He also says not to announce \"we stop saying 'מוריד הגשם'\", as it is like praying for no rain. Thus, the community switches only after the שליח צבור does so in his repetition of the עמידה of מוסף, and there's never a pre-עמידה announcement. (This is מנהג נוסח אשכנז outside of Israel.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems then that according to רמ״א the reason to switch at מוסף and not שחרית is nonexistent. So why not switch at שחרית?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Both explanations comes from the Rosh in the first chapter of Taanit and the source is the Yerushalmi, we see that they are two contradictory pshatim in Yerushalmi. This Yerushalmi needs a serious reflection and is commented by acharonim and rishonim. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I found somewhat which answer quickly your question.</p>\n\n<p>First, here is <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?pgnum=395&req=40739&st=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the page</a> with the comment I used.</p>\n\n<p>You ask:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>We'd switch at the next opportunity, at שחרית; the reason given for not doing so is that we want to announce, before the עמידה, that people should say \"מוריד הטל\", and can't do so during שחרית as it would constitute an interruption between גאולה and תפלה.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a mixture of two meimrot in Yerushalmi. The Rosh himself reports the Yerushalmi with all details.</p>\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi  (paraphrased following the conclusion) says that if he bring to his attention that the members of congregation says morid hatal in shacharit. He discovers this listening the chazarat hashats or before thanks to his neighbor. At this step at least (see later), the gemara rules that members of the congregation and the officiant switch simultaneously. So he would think that yesterday in Arvit he did erroneously say morid hageshem. He believe that he should pray immediately tashlumim for the arvit prayer. Or two prayers, shacharit and arvit if he did discover the switch by the shaliach tsibur.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, for the minhag not to mention Tal, there is also a problem if they switch in shacharit.</p>\n\n<p>I though twice this teruts. You can find somewhat similar in the perush שירי קרבן in the PDF linked above.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the single answer to the OP but is perhaps enough.</p>\n\n\n",

What, then, is [the meaning of] \"a wicked one borrows and does not repay\"? A person may steal a house, or a field, or money, and the courts will recover it from him, but if he cohabits with a married woman, what restitution can he make [since an adulteress is forbidden to her husband]? If [the adulterer] repays in a similar manner by allowing his wife to cohabit with him, it would come out that the world would be full of mamzeirim! This is \"a wicked one borrows and does not repay,\" for the wicked one takes a \"loan\" that he cannot repay, for he causes a woman to be forbidden to her husband. But one who is \"righteous\" only borrows from his friend something [with which the latter is] \"generous and gives.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, the Midrash interprets the first clause as referring to the wicked one, who takes one's wife knowing that he cannot repay, while the righteous one takes only that which is given with consent. </p>\n\n<p>Given that the first clause is dealing with adultery, according to this explanation, it's reasonable to assume that the second clause is, as well. Would it not come out, then, that a righteous person may cohabit with one's wife with her husband's consent? </p>\n\n<p>Yet, that is not the case. The Torah forbids eishes ish <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/33316/9682\">regardless of what her husband wants</a>.

The mamzer would only be the result of an original, forbidden relationship.</p>\n\n<p>The words of the Medrash at the end of the passage: \"Mah Sheh'hu\" would translate to \"something which is, that he gives\". This phrase refers to something which is <em>by definition</em> in the category of \"X\" namely \"he <em>can</em> give\".</p>\n\n<p>The OP writes: \"Given that the first clause is dealing with adultery, according to this explanation, it's reasonable to assume that <strong>the second clause is, as well.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although this is an acceptable form of logic when reading a passage in general, it does not apply if there is no choice available. In this case, if there is no alternative contrast within the context of wife swapping that the Medrash considers \"permitted\", then we can conclude that the Medrash meant to contrast wife swapping with something else which is in fact permitted to be given (non-wife related) as a more general contrast. </p>\n\n<p>Here we have shown that according to the Medrash, even voluntary wife swapping produces mamzerim.

    "content": "# The Number of Rabbinic Mitzvot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Of all of the different mitzvot that the sages instituted, there are seven in particular that get singled out. They are known as the seven rabbinic mitzvot, and are so delineated from the others because those seven necessitate the recitation of a blessing (<a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/taryag/rabbinic_mitzvos_1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I have been wondering about the obligation to eat maror on erev Pesach. The gemara (Pesachim 120a) provides two opinions as regards the status of this mitzva, but both opinions (Rava and Rav Acha bar Yaakov) hold that the obligation to eat maror is rabbinic only. And, in fact, we do recite a blessing when we get to that part of the seder (בא\"י אמ\"ה אקב\"ו על אכילת מרור)! So doesn't this mean that there are eight rabbinic mitzvot, not seven?</p>\n\n<p><strong>In short:</strong> If the obligation to eat maror on Pesach it is <em>not</em> a rabbinic mitzva, there shouldn't be a brakha; if it <em>is</em> a rabbinic mitzva, why do we say that there are only seven rabbinic mitzvot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The short answer is that \"seven rabbinic commandments\" only refers to commandments the rabbis instituted themselves; but there are many other rabbinic commandments that are extensions or safeguards for Torah laws.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14287&st=&pgnum=351\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiferet Yisrael</a> (Uktzin 3:12 Yachin 94) who lists seven mitzvot and explains that one does not count mitzvot that are only a safeguard to Torah law (Bedikat Chametz), or an extension of Torah law (Kiddush on a cup of wine), or remembrances to Torah law (taking araba minim after the first day of Sukkot).</p>\n<p>With respect to maror, the gemara you cited is specifically discussing eating maror <em><strong>nowadays</strong></em>, when there is no korban pesach. But everyone agrees that there is a biblical commandment to eat maror in the times of the beit hamikdash. (There is a machloket whether maror is one of the 613 mitzvot or part of the mitzvah of eating matzah. <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/holidays/pesach/mitzva-eat-maror\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See discussion here</a>). Since eating maror today is a remembrance to Torah law--and not an innovation of the Rabbis--it is not counted among the seven Rabbinic mitzvot.</p>\n\n\n",

We have several Jewish inmates who are complaining that by opening the bulk Kosher powdered milk and dividing it into single servings, we are contaminating it and it is no longer Kosher.</p>\n\n<p>Question: Is it true that dividing bulk Kosher powdered milk makes it non-kosher, and if so, which solutions would rectify this problem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>When you open the sealed bulk carton, they can no longer know that it has been certified. It is the same reason that an airline kosher meal must be served to the passenger <strong>still sealed</strong>. Once it has been unsealed, the certification no longer applies. One way to handle this is to have the Jewish chaplain be there when it is opened and seal the individual trays. It is possible to have one of the Jewish inmates do this if he is sufficiently religious to be trusted in the matter.</p>\n\n<p>As suggested, call the OU (Orthodox Union) or the RCA (Rabbinical Council of America). Besides giving you advice, they might be able to give you the name of a rabbi in your area who can help. Similarly if there is a local Chabad, they can help you.</p>\n\n<p>Note that if you call a local synagogue, you should make sure it is of a denomination that would be trusted by the relevant inmates, which likely in this case means it must be an Orthodox synagogue and rabbi. Heterodox denominations would generally not be trusted in this matter by Orthodox inmates.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>While I can't comment specifically on the issues involved with powdered milk and splitting them into single servings I can make a few suggestions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Look into kosher single serving packets ( I don't know if that fits the constraints of the jail budget) but there are plenty of companies (e.g. Carnation, etc.) that are certified kosher.</p></li>\n<li><p>Consult with a Jewish chaplain who services your facility; he may have encountered this issue before and/or provide assurances to your inmates</p></li>\n<li><p>Consult the <a href=\"https://www.ou.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Orthodox Union</a>, one of the largest kosher certification agencies in the US.

Good luck!</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The answers already given here discuss the loss of the certifying seal, but miss an important part of the general difficulty around the handling of Kosher food -- Kosher food handled with non-Kosher implements may become non-Kosher.  As an extreme example, if you scooped out the powdered milk with a scoop that had previously been used to measure shrimp powder for an Asian sauce recipe, the powdered milk would be not only non-Kosher, but dangerous to anyone with a shellfish allergy.</p>\n<p>In order to divide bulk Kosher food items without risking compromising their Kosher status you likely need dedicated utensils for handling Kosher food, separate sets for milk, meat, and neutral ingredients, as well as delegating the task to someone religiously trusted to maintain the purity of the Kosher food.</p>\n<p>It would probably be cheaper to buy single-serving containers of Kosher foods than to maintain an entire infrastructure for handling food, washing and storing utensils, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

The Belzer Rebbe asks it as well and says, </p>\n\n<p>\"As lofty and climactic a moment as Shiras HaYam (Song of the Sea) may have appeared to the naked eye, for those who were actually living through it, it was bittersweet. While they were certainly grateful and appreciative for their miraculous salvation from the hands of their sadistic Egyptian oppressors, the majority of the Jewish people were not there to experience it, as Rashi writes (13:18) that four-fifths of the nation died during the plague of darkness and did not merit the redemption. If 80% of the Jewish people died in such a short period of time, it is safe to assume that virtually everybody who did merit being saved had relatives who were not as fortunate. As such, as great as their personal feelings of joy and relief may have been, they were tempered by the recognition that they were unable to share them with their loved ones who had recently passed away.</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe posited that when Moshe came to the Jewish people and suggested that they all sing a song of praise to Hashem, they responded in disbelief, \"How can you expect us to be capable of singing? Four-fifths of Klal Yisroel is missing!\" When Moshe heard that, he told them that the Torah's discussion of the very song he wanted them to sing hints to the future resurrection, at which time they will be reunited with all of their deceased friends and relatives. This awareness consoled the people and cheered them up so that they were able to sing with joyous hearts, a thought which also comforted the grieving Belzer Chassidim and enabled them to open up and sing Shabbos zemiros with their Rebbe.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/alport/archives/beshalach75.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/alport/archives/beshalach75.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

The passage that we say ends with saying that with our new souls for shabbat we can bless but it actually continues and says that what we are saying is barchu et hashem hamevorach so some places end the public reading of kegavna with the word velomar and then jump into barchu so that the connection is really clear. With our new souls we can now praise god and say barchu. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did Adam have intercourse with animals?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.23?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en&p3=Yevamot.63a&lang3=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yebamoth 63a</a> states that Adam had intercourse with animals:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר אלעזר מאי דכתיב (בראשית ב, כג) זאת הפעם עצם מעצמי ובשר מבשרי מלמד שבא אדם על כל בהמה וחיה ולא נתקררה דעתו עד שבא על חוה</p>\n<p>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” (Genesis 2:23)? This teaches that Adam had intercourse with each animal and beast in his search for his mate, and his mind was not at ease, in accordance with the verse: “And for Adam, there was not found a helpmate for him” (Genesis 2:20), until he had intercourse with Eve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Did Adam actually have intercourse with animals? Should this be looked at as true or just the opinion of that rabbi? I always see people using this part of the Talmud to bash Judaism, I don't know how I should even respond to them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There is disagreement about this among the commentators. Here is a quote from the Artscroll Rashi Chumash Bereishis 2:23 footnote 4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Divrei Dovid...says that this prohibition [to have relations with animals] did not come into effect until after the creation of Eve. Gur Aryeh, Maharsha, and others strongly reject this position and take the matter of Adam having relations with animals in a figurative sense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The vast majority of classical Jewish sources, including all the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geonim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Geonim</a>, and most <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishonim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rishonim</a>, state that the Midrashim (exegetical rabbinic literature) reflect the views of individual rabbis; not the unanimous consensus of Judaism as a whole. Accordingly, one is free to independently evaluate them.</p>\n\n<p>For example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherira_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Sherira Gaon</a> quoted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Isaac_of_Narbonne\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer HaEshkol</a> (Hilkhot Sefer Torah) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר מר [רב] שרירא הני מילי דנפקי מפסוקי ומקרי מדרש ואגדה אומדנא נינהו, ויש מהן שהוא כך...והרבה יש שאינו כן, כגון מה שאמר ר' עקיבא דמקושש היינו צלפחד...והם הזכירו דעתו של כל אחד ואחד, ואנו לפי שכלו יהולל איש. וכן...תנחומא...וזולתם, רובם אינו כן, ולכך אין אנו סומכין על דברי אגדה. והנכון מהם מה שמתחזק מן השכל ומן המקרא מדבריהם,   </p>\n  \n  <p>These words that are derived from verses and are called midrashim or aggada are estimations (umdena)...Some are indeed correct, but many are not correct...And they mentioned the views of each individual, but we follow our own blessed minds... Therefore we do not rely on aggada...Accept as reliable only those that follow from logic or from the verses. (Also cited in the introduction to Menorat Ha-Maor)].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Hai Gaon</a> cited there writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגדה ומדרש אף על פי שכתובין בתלמוד אם לא יכוונו ואם ישתבשו אין לסמוך עליהם, כי כללינו הוא אין סומכין על ההגדה  </p>\n  \n  <p>Haggada and Midrash; even if they are written in the Talmud, if they do not make sense disregard them, for we have a principle that we do not rely on the aggadot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Rav Hai Gaon is quoted (Otsar HaGeonim Berakhot; Peirushim: 67) as saying that not only do the aggadot reflect at most individual views, rather than the views of Judaism, but that even these ideas were often mere suggestions; not definitive ideas.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוו יודעים כי דברי אגדה לאו שמועה הם, אלא כל אחד דורש מה שעלה על לבו כגון אפשר, ויש לומר, לא דבר חתוך</p>\n  \n  <p>Know that words of aggada are not based on tradition, rather each person would expound what would enter his mind, such as conjectures, and possibilities; not set things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For a lengthy survey of classical approaches to the nature and veracity of these sorts of stories found in the Talmud and other works, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/53351/8775\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many of these anti-Semitic sites, falsely claim that the Jews agree with everything in the Talmud, that it is their Bible and the like. While that is largely true in the legal realm, in the non-legal realm, that certainly is far from the dominant Jewish view.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, many commentators primarily the Spanish Rishonim of the 11th-15th centuries, and their successors, frequently suggest that non-literal Midrashim are not to be taken literally.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, for example, the Spanish school explained this non-literally and were horrified by the simple presentation of this Midrash.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_arama\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Isaac Arama</a>, for example, writes in his Akedat Yitshak (Genesis: Sha'ar 8) that certainly the intent is not that he engaged in intercourse with the animals, but rather that he mentally probed them and evaluated them, and found them all lacking:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזו היא כוונתם ז\"ל באמרם שבא אדם על כל בהמה חיה ועוף ולא נתקררה דעתו בהם (יבמות ס\"ג א). ירצה שבא בדעתו וטוב התבוננותו עליהם ועל טבעם ולא נתקררה דעתו שיהיה זווגו  </p>\n  \n  <p>And this is their intent in that which thy said that Adam came upon all the animals and wasn't satisfied by them. That is, that he came to them through mental evaluation and deep contemplation of them and their nature, and he was not satisfied any could serve as a match for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Saba\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Abraham Saba</a> writes very similarly in his Tseror HaMor to Genesis. As do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abravanel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Don Isaac Abravanel</a> in his commentary to Genesis (end of 2:19), and R. Samuel Almosnino (23).[i]</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Karo\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Isaac Karo</a> writes in his commentary to Genesis (2:23):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חס ושלום שבא בפועל </p>\n  \n  <p>Heaven fore-fend that he literally engaged in intercourse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[i] Cited in Prof. Eric Lawee's <em>The Reception of Rashi’s Commentary on\nthe Torah in Spain: The Case of Adam’s Mating with the Animals</em>, p. 57. In The Jewish Quarterly Review, Vol. 97, No. 1 (Winter 2007).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Although the vast majority of commentators take the view that Adam didn't have physical relations with the animals, there is a minority view that he did.</p>\n\n<p>R.

They usually help me make certain integral realizations. Even when I mull over the material myself and make connections, exercises make me confident that if you wake me up in the middle of the night and ask me a question I'll be able to answer it. </p>\n\n<p>I really enjoy learning Gemara in the most focused and most rigorous manner, which is incredibly mentally and physically demanding (one must exert much energy to truly probe the depths of a sugya). However, I feel that even when I've been able to identify a chakira among Rishonim, get to the bottom of a really difficult tosphot, the area I struggle most in is mastering the art of integrating the nuanced views of all the Rishonim into a coherent picture and being able to directly answer questions that require me to draw from an intuitive and integrated understanding. Even when I've thought deeply about the Rishonim on my own, asked what my Rebbe says are good questions, I don't feel confident in my instantaneous and intuitive grasp of all the nuance. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Therefore, I was wondering if anyone can recommend a book of super high quality exercises in Gemara. That is, not asking what the pshat means, but asking me to go out, read what rishon A, B, and C says, and then prove something with that.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In particular, I am studying Kiddushin, so Kiddushin problems would be really helpful. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I would suggest that you learn Shut Rabbi Akiva Eiger, Sefer Chazon Ish, or other such sefarim.

The act is spiritually damaging and each confrontation can be assumed to be a new sin against Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>While shunning is considered a sin because it can be considered a form of disrespect toward one's mother...<strong>you can only do it once.

So shunning is a \"new sin\" every minute.

However, the child in most cases can learn how to avoid some confrontation with a parent and avoid some pain by working on their own chracter as well.</p>\n\n<p>More details would be too complicated to post because each case needs to be dealt with in detail by your family Rav and/or personal family mental health professional.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The literature on Halacha between abusive parents and children coincides with the psychological literature on surviving narcissistic abuse from parents. Both lean toward emancipation and separation.</p>\n<p>Halachically, <em>chayecha kodmin</em> (your life takes precedence), applies in cases of abuse and danger. In addition, my rabbis have told me that you are not obligated to perform acts of kindness if the other party will reciprocate with hostility or negativity. This idea is sourced in the Maharik. See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5145030/jewish/Must-One-Honor-Abusive-Parents.htm#footnote14a5145030\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It says in \"Honoring Parents in Halacha - A practical guide\" by Rabbi Tzuriel Ta'aseh, on page 22, inyan 22:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mitzvah of kibbud av va'em applies even if the parents are strict and demanding. However, if the parents are very difficult people and constantly cause their child distress, he should move away from them. It is always proper in such cases to seek competent halachic advice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On page 77:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>If one's father or mother loses his or her mental faculties, he should try to bear with them until Heaven has mercy upon them and restores their faculties. However, if the condition has deteriorated to the extent that one cannot deal with his parent properly, and sometimes he has to scream or even hit the parent for his benefit, he should go away and arrange for someone else to take care of his parent.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that if the parent's condition is not life threatening, then it's not the child's business. You may not try to get medical services involved behind their back or anything (see page 68, inyan 5)</p>\n<p>~</p>\n<p>I've seen this basic answer in many places. If one has a very difficult relationship with their parents, the Torah permits or even obligates them to move away and reduce contact significantly. In extreme cases, perhaps even going no-contact would be possible, but that doesn't sound like it would apply here, and is a very grave thing to do. Either way, the main thing is - go speak to a Rabbi who knows the situation and get a psak.</p>\n<p>All the best, dear yid</p>\n\n\n",

What is the scriptural source for this (or Talmudic)? </p>\n\n<p>Why does the wife take on her husbands minhagim and not vice versa? Is this obligatory? This is especially perplexing since the verse states \"Do not abandon the Torah of your mother\"!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A family adopts the fathers minhagim because he is the one that has a chiyuv to teach his sons Torah, and the daughter follow it until they get married. The son takes his fathers minhagim because it says in the Torah \"You shall teach them to your sons.\" A daughter once she gets married follows the minhagim of her husbands house because in the gemara (Meseches Pesachim 50b) that once a daughter gets married it is like she left her previous place and customs and moved to a new place and received new customs to follow.\nThe pasuk \"Do not abandon the Torah of your mother,\" which is from Mishlei should not be translated like that. The correct translation would be to replace \"Torah\" with \"teachings.\" Rashi says that the pasuk is saying not to forget how your mother taught you to love. \nYou can look for more about following the fathers minhagim in Meseches Pesachim 50b (the fourth perek).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The source for following the minhagim of ones father is a Gemara Pesachim (50b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בני ביישן נהוג דלא הוו אזלין מצור לצידון במעלי שבתא אתו בנייהו קמיה\n  דרבי יוחנן אמרו לו אבהתין אפשר להו אנן לא אפשר לן אמר להו כבר קיבלו\n  אבותיכם עליהם שנאמר שמע בני מוסר אביך ואל תטוש תורת אמך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Bnei Beishan\" complained to R' Yochanan that the custom their father had adopted not to go to the market on Fridays was not financially viable for them, and they wanted to scrap this custom. R' Yochanan replied 'Your fathers already accepted this custom upon themselves', ruling that they were bound to keep this custom, citing the verse 'שמע בני מוסר אביך'.</p>\n\n<p>The Rivash (and many Poskim in his footsteps) opines that a <em>minhag</em> is binding, sourcing his claim from Pesachim 50b. He writes (§399):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד שאפילו בדברים שלא קבלו עליהם בני העיר בהסכמה, אלא שנהגו כן מעצמם לעשות גדר וסייג לתורה <strong>אף הבנים חייבין לנהוג בותו גדר</strong>, כדאמרינן במסכת פסחים בני בישן נהגו וכו׳ אמר להו כבר קבלו עליהם אבותיכם וכתיב שמע בני מוסר אביך ואל תטוש תורת אמך. <strong>ואם לא היה ביד האבות לתקן על הבנים איך היו הבנים אסורין במה שנהגו בו אסור האבות מעצמם</strong> וכו׳.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the Pischei Teshuva Shulchan Aruch (YOD 214:5) quotes the Zichron Yosef who limits this law:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והעלה <strong>דאין הבן מחוייב להתנהג בהנהגת אביו זולת מה שהתנהג גם הבן מאז שהגדיל</strong> שהרגילוהו אבותיו ללכת בדרכיהם, ועל אופן זה מיירי נמי המחבר שכתב קבלת הרבים חלה עליהם ועל זרעם דהיינו שכבר נהגו כן יושבי עיר וזרעם ו<strong>הוי כנדרו גם לזרעם</strong> ולהכי חייבים לישות כתקנתם, מה שאין כן <strong>אם הבן לא התחיל להתנהג מעולם כמנהג הטוב של אביו אין הבן מחוייב להתנהג</strong> בפרישות ההוא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, although there is no 'power of tradition' which obligates a son to follow the practices of his father, if the son was raised by his father and therefore [from the age of reaching adulthood] practiced his fathers customs, he would be obligated to follow them, similar to a נדר לדבר מצוה which can be caused simply by performing a good practice without the disclaimer that you do not want to make a נדר.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Chavas Yair</em> (§126) [and Pri Chadash (496, Dinei Minhagei Issur §7)] quotes the Rivash, and writes that it is unreasonable to say that every son must follow every stringency of his father, and proves so lengthily; he concludes that the Gemara Pesachim 50b and the Rivash are not talking about individual families, but the customs of a town, which are halachically binding even to future generations (See Shulchan Aruch 214:2 - קבלת הרבים חלה עליהם ועל זרעם).</p>\n\n<p>The contemporary Poskim (Igros Moshe, Shevet Halevi [5:129, 6:59, 9:193], Minchas Yitzchok [3:144:2]) rule like the abovementioned opinion. For example, R' Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OCH 3:64) rules: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם מנהג מקומו היה ג״כ להקל ורק אביו נהג להחמיר אין הבן מחוייב להתנהג אלא אם כבר התנהג גם הבן בעצמו בגדלותו אף שהיה זה ממה שהגדילו אביו ולא מצד בחירת עצמו להחמיר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shevet Halevi (6:59) discusses Sephardic students who are enrolled in Ashkenazi yeshivos, and wanted to change certain minhagim (like nusach hatefilla). He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכל זמן שאין להם טעם מספיק ע״פ הלכה לעזוב מנהג המסור להם איכא בזה גם משום אל תטוש תורת אמיך, וכמובאר בפסחים נ ע״ב ובשו״ע יו״ד סי׳ רי״ד ס״ב קבלת הרבים חלה עליהם ואל זרעם וכו׳ אבל בדבר שקבל על עצמו שבט שלם בכלל ישראל כמו מנהגי הספרדים והכרעותיהם מפני שהם ספרדים ונמשכו אחרי רבותיהם זה כמה מאות בשנה - וכן ההכרעות האשכנזים כרמ״א שזה דבר הנמשך לדורות עולם מכמה מאות שנה <strong>בזה נראה דלא צריך דבלה משהגדיך דשורש שבטו ממילא מחייב לנהוג כאבותיו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although he accepts the opinion of the Zichron Yosef that children are only bound to what they have practiced themselves in adulthood, this is only true of individual practices, not widespread customs for people of a certain 'tribe'.</p>\n\n<p>The Divrei Malkiel (4:66, 5:81) forbids a son of generations who didn't shave their beards to begin shaving, based on the Gemara Pesachim.</p>\n\n\n",

I think I am mostly bothered why someone would choose to name a person 'the dew of God.' Does the concept \"God's dew\" have significance in Judaism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on my Hebrew knowledge, טָלֶה (taleh) is the word for a ram, so טָלִיָה (talia) would mean an ewe. So perhaps the Wikipedia page listed one definition, but this makes more sense to me.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Dew is connected in a number of texts to the resurrection of the dead. It probably stems from Isaiah 26:19: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יִֽחְי֣וּ מֵתֶ֔יךָ נְבֵלָתִ֖י יְקוּמ֑וּן הָקִ֨יצוּ וְרַנְּנ֜וּ\n  שֹׁכְנֵ֣י עָפָ֗ר כִּ֣י טַ֤ל אוֹרֹת֙ טַלֶּ֔ךָ וָאָ֖רֶץ רְפָאִ֥ים\n  תַּפִּֽיל</p>\n  \n  <p>Oh, let Your dead revive! Let corpses arise! Awake and shout for joy,\n  You who dwell in the dust!— For Your dew is like the dew on fresh\n  growth; You make the land of the shades come to life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And it's used by Rabban Gamliel in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.26.19?lang=bi&p2=Sanhedrin.90b.10&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 90b</a> as a prooftext for the resurrection, and in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.1.118a.30/he/Torat_Emet_Zohar?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a> and a couple other places too. </p>\n\n<p>That's as to your second question - whether \"God's dew\" has significance in Judaism. I'm assuming the name Talia relates to this, but don't have a source. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tzerei vs. Sh'va vs. Segol\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there examples of words where pronouncing a sh'va as a tzeirei or a segol (or pronouncing a tzeirei as a sh'va or a segol or a segol as a sh'va or a tzeire) creates a different meaning? I'm looking for examples where mispronunciation results in a very different meaning (e.g., past vs. future tense -- basically something that a gabbai should correct in laining if the ba'al korei makes such a mistake) or even an entirely different word. Multiple examples would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>Pronouncing segol as tzeirei/ vice versa:</strong></p>\n<p>One very drastic example of this is the word אל. With a tzeirei, this means 'Almighty' (depending on translation; but basically usually G-d). With a segol, this means 'to' [there may be some exceptions, but this is generally true].</p>\n<p>Another example of this are the words אוכל and צורך. With a tzeirei, they mean 'eating' and 'consuming', respectively. With a segol they mean 'food and 'a need', respectively. I tried figuring out if this is a general rule by verbs of this sort (meaning, present tense binyan kal, and the relevant noun) but it doesn't seem to be. [Note that these words also include a change in enunciation - from mil'el to mil'ra.] Edit: I found one more like this, קובץ. There are presumably others.</p>\n<p>There is also the example @DoubleAA gave in the comments, which is the word ישלחנו (along with any other future tense binyan pi'el, with the suffix נו), where if the letter before the נ has a segol, it would mean \"he should/ will X him\", whereas if it were with a tzeirei, it would be \"he should/ will X us\" (in our example, ישלחֶנו means he should send him, and ישלחֵנו means you should send us).</p>\n<p><strong>Pronouncing tzeirei as sh'va na/ vice versa:</strong></p>\n<p>In verbs which are binyan pi'el, a מ at the beginning either shows that the word is present tense, or means 'from the X of', depending on whether it uses a sh'va or tzeirei. For example מבשל with a sh'va would mean \"cooking\", whereas with a tzeirei it would mean \"from the cooking of\".</p>\n<p>A practical (and drastic) example is in the song כל מקדש שביעי, where it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל שומר שבת כדת מחללו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When pronounced with a tzeirei, this means</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All who keep Shabbos religiously, from its desecration\" (i.e. those who make sure not to desecrate shabbos)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whereas with a sh'va it means</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All who keep Shabbos religiously, desecrate it\" - <em>exactly the opposite!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another example is שמע. With a tzeirei this means 'a rumor' (literally, 'a heard', I think). With a sh'va, this means 'hear!', as a command. [Though this also changes the enunciation from mil'el to mil'ra.]</p>\n<p><strong>Pronouncing sh'va na as segol and vice versa:</strong></p>\n<p>One example of where this would change the meaning is the word קרע, where when pronounced with a sh'va, means \"rip!\", and with a segol it means \"a tear (rip)\" [though just like שמע, this changes the enunciation]. Similar words include: בלע (which actually changes meaning slightly more than other words), מנע (which won't coem up as often, because in its segol form it's only used as the secknd word in smichut; at least in modern Hebrew) שפע, פצע, פתח, מתח, and seemingly any shoresh that ends in ע or ח in binyan kal (besides for שמע, which I've already mentioned).</p>\n<p>One word worth mentioning separately (even though it's included above) because it completely changes the meaning: קרח with a sh'va means \"bald!\" (I.e. a command to pull out hair), whereas with a segol it means \"ice\". There are probably others like this as well.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There are many, many more individual and groups of words that will change in any of these three ways, so please comment if you know of another! (Or leave a separate answer, if you prefer)</p>\n\n\n",

All water that may be in the house or stored away in vessels in the first hour of the teḳufah is thrown away in the belief that the water is then poisoned, and if drunk would cause swelling of the body, sickness, and sometimes death. Several reasons are advanced for this. Some say it is because the angels who protect the water change guard at the teḳufah and leave it unwatched for a short time. Others say that Cancer fights with Libra and drops blood into the water. Another authority accounts for the drops of blood in the water at Teḳufat Nisan by pointing out that the waters in Egypt turned to blood at that particular moment. At Teḳufat Tammuz, Moses smote the rock and caused drops of blood to flow from it. At Teḳufat Tishri the knife which Abraham held to slay Isaac dropped blood. At Teḳufat Ṭebet, Jephthah sacrificed his daughter (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44589&st=&pgnum=242&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abudarham, \"Sha'ar ha-Teḳufot,\" p. 122a, Venice, 1566</a>).</em></p>\n<p><em>The origin of the superstition can not be traced. Hai Gaon, in the tenth century, in reply to a question as to the prevalence of this custom in the \"West\" (i.e., west of Babylon), said it was followed only in order that the new season might be begun with a supply of fresh, sweet water. Ibn Ezra ridicules the fear that the teḳufah water will cause swelling, and ascribes the belief to the \"gossip of old women\" (ib.). Hezekiah da Silva, however, warns his coreligionists to pay no attention to Ibn Ezra's remarks, asserting that in his own times many persons who drank water when the teḳufah occurred fell ill and died in consequence. Da Silva says the principal danger lies in the first teḳufah (Nisan); and a special announcement of its occurrence was made by the beadle of the congregation (\"Peri Ḥadash,\" on Oraḥ Ḥayyim, 428, end <sup>2</sup>). The danger lurks only in unused water, not in water that has been boiled or used in salting or pickling. The danger in unused water may be avoided by putting in it a piece of iron or an iron vessel (\"Bet Yosef\" on the \"Ṭur,\" and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.455.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isserles' note to Shulḥan 'Aruk, Oraḥ Ḥayyim, 455, 1</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ba%27er_Hetev_on_Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De%27ah.116.6?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Be'er Heṭeb,\" to Yoreh De'ah, 116, 5</a>). R. Jacob Mölln required that a new iron nail should be lowered by means of a string into the water used for baking maẓẓot during the Nisan teḳufah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14721&st=&pgnum=11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Sefer Maharil,\" p. 6b, ed. Warsaw</a>).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on the last statement of the encyclopedia, it seems clear that the <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> is basing his ruling on the <em>Poskim</em> cited above to remove the potential dangers of water contained in food and drinks during <em>Tekufa</em>.</p>\n<p>Hope this is helpful</p>\n<p><sub><sup>1</sup> see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox#Names\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></sub></p>\n<p><sub><sup>2</sup> I was unsuccessful in locating this.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

What exactly are the requirements that must be fulfilled for a person to be killed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Chabad.org summarizes the requirements <a href=\"http://www.chabadlive.com/41/judaism-and-capital-punishment/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Judaism and Capital Punishment</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, Jewish law mandates many caveats to actually securing an\n  execution. First of all there have to be two witnesses to the actual\n  crime. Even strong circumstantial evidence is inadmissible for the\n  purposes of capital punishment. Secondly, the witnesses need to give\n  an official ‘warning’ to the perpetrator that if he commits the\n  offence he is liable to the death penalty. The perpetrator needs to\n  clearly accept this warning and commit the crime within a few seconds\n  of the warning, thus distinguishing the act as utterly premeditated\n  and the sinner completely aware of the consequences. Even if all the\n  above conditions are satisfied there is still no certainty of\n  conviction as the witnesses are subject to very aggressive\n  cross-examination. If certain details of the witnesses testimonies do\n  not correspond or if they are inaccurate in describing the full\n  cirmcustances surrounding the event they can be disqualified and the\n  conviction will not be secured.</p>\n  \n  <p>Furthermore, according to the Talmud, “any doubts in a capital crimes\n  should always be for the benefit of the accused” (Baba Batra 50B,\n  Sanhedrin 79A). A judge who had argued initially for condemnation can\n  subsequently argue for acquittal, but one who had argued for acquittal\n  cannot not later argue for condemnation. Acquittal in capital cases\n  required only a simple majority of one vote, condemnation required a\n  majority of two.</p>\n  \n  <p>A ‘guilty’ verdict can be reversed to acquittal if errors are\n  revealed, but new evidence to reverse an ‘innocent’ decision to\n  ‘gulity’ is not accepted!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that a <strong>unanimous</strong> declaration of guilty forces the court to let the perpetrator go free because any such case means that not all the facts have been revealed. A judge is not allowed to vote innocent in order to prevent such a unanimous verdict, if he believes the perpetrator guilty.</p>\n\n<p>A court does have certain extra-judicial powers to kill a murderer under certain circumstances and the king can declare the perpetrator subject to the death penalty as a <em>mored bemalchus</em> (guilty of treason). </p>\n\n<p>A detailed translation of <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2016/09/06/emergency-powers-for-beth-din/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan Choshen Mishpat</a> gives the details but is too long to summarize here.</p>\n\n<p>As an example we have <a href=\"http://www.thehalachacenter.org/journal-links/5775/devarim/veschanan/the-blood-of-thy-brother.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Blood of Thy Brother</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Ohr Samayach in Hilchos Melachim Perek 3 explains that since there\n  is some evidence that the relative was murdered this is sufficient to\n  exonerate the Goel Hadam. The Ohr Somayach compares this to the\n  judicial powers of a Jewish monarch. The Jewish king is allowed to\n  kill someone who rebels against him without the requirements of Bais\n  Din such as two witnesses and a warning. The Jewish king can dispense\n  with these requirements to kill one of his subjects when required. The\n  Ohr Somayach explains that this is because the Jewish king is not\n  punishing the perpetrator but rather he is establishing the authority\n  of a monarch. Respect for the king’s authority uses other extra\n  judicial standards. Similarly, as explained above because of the\n  importance in maintaining the proper respect for the sanctity of\n  Jewish life the extra judicial methods of Goel Hadam or Kipah are used\n  by Bais Din.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Ketzos in Siman 2 on a theoretical basis points out that although\n  we currently do not have a Bais Din with the authority to administer\n  capital punishment, however, we could perhaps allow a Goel Hadam to\n  avenge the death of a relative. Since in the case of a Goel Hadam it\n  is not a regular punishment but an extra judicial procedure, this\n  could be applicable even when Bais Din itself has no authority to\n  administer capital punishment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>@MonicaCellio has pointed out that the wikipedia article <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_and_corporal_punishment_in_Judaism#Stringencies_of_evidence_in_capital_cases\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Stringencies of evidence in capital cases</a> actually has the correct list.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It requires two witnesses who observed the crime. The accused would\n  have been given a chance and if repeated the same crime or any other\n  it would lead to a death sentence. If witnesses had been caught lying\n  about the crime they would be executed.</p>\n  \n  <p>Two witnesses were required. Acceptability was limited to:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>Adult Jewish men who were known to keep the commandments, knew the written and oral law, and had legitimate professions;</p></li>\n  <li><p>The witnesses had to see each other at the time of the sin;</p></li>\n  <li><p>The witnesses had to be able to speak clearly, without any speech impediment or hearing deficit (to ensure that the warning and the\n  response were done);</p></li>\n  <li><p>The witnesses could not be related to each other or to the accused.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The witnesses had to see each other, and both of them had to give a warning (hatra'ah) to the person that the sin they were about to\n  commit was a capital offense;</p></li>\n  <li><p>This warning had to be delivered within seconds of the performance of the sin (in the time it took to say, \"Peace unto you, my Rabbi and\n  my Master\");</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>In the same amount of time, the person about to sin had to:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>Respond that s/he was familiar with the punishment, but they were going to sin anyway; AND</p></li>\n  <li><p>Begin to commit the sin/crime;</p></li>\n  <li><p>The Beth Din had to examine each witness separately; and if even one point of their evidence was contradictory - even if a very minor\n  point, such as eye color - the evidence was considered contradictory\n  and the evidence was not heeded;</p></li>\n  <li><p>The Beth Din had to consist of minimally 23 judges;</p></li>\n  <li><p>The majority could not be a simple majority - the split verdict that would allow conviction had to be at least 13 to 11 in favor of\n  conviction;</p></li>\n  <li><p>If the Beth Din arrived at a unanimous verdict of guilty, the person was let go - the idea being that if no judge could find anything\n  exculpatory about the accused, there was something wrong with the\n  court.[12]</p></li>\n  <li><p>The witnesses were appointed by the court to be the executioners.</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>As a result, convictions for capital offense were rare in\n  Judaism.[13][14]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

You should not use such ideas on that crowd. You should instead focus on heartwarming stories and aggadata.</p></li>\n<li><p>By opening up with a statement that is outrageous or catchy in the first 3 seconds. There are many styles to achieve this.</p></li>\n<li><p>Actually it gives respect for the thing about to be said. Even people attending secular awards dinners, stop eating, to hear the next speaker because its the important focus of the evening. But, you can make sure to speak on a topic that touches on \"real life\".</p></li>\n<li><p>Don't sound like you are trying too hard. It becomes condescending. Secondly, maybe the crowd you have that night is not ready for a vort but is ready for a story or topic that happened to you in the week which teaches how a Jew should act/make a Kiddush Hashem etc. (maybe even with humor and a twist?)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In general, you are not the thought police. If you are giving a vort to make sure people \"speak Torah\" by the meal, it may be resented and the opposite effect will happen; namely, people won't want to learn Torah. Be humble and only speak about something the crowd wants to speak about and then build in a Torah vort they can handle and appreciate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Lubavitcher Rebbe said constantly: \"Words that leave from the heart, enter the heart.</strong>\" If you are saying the vort because you actually care about the peoplel listening, then they will know. They will listen in return. If you are just doing it to be \"yotzei the chiyuv\" of \"diverei Torah\" at the meal, then people will know it and they will most likely tune out.</p>\n\n<p>So, you may wish to start by simply asking your guests/friends about their week/life and comment about yours too, show sympathy, and be interesting in general. Then go for the vort when you have an opening. OR... Simply ask one of them to share a vort or Torah themed story! Turn the tables. People get excited when they are the speaker. :)</p>\n\n<p>Also, avoid monotone voice. Raise and lower your pitch slightly when speaking as well as slow down and speed up every so often. It stops people from dozing off. Oh yes, and keep it short LOL (2-3 minutes maximum). Also, use humor! Torah should be joyful. Its also contagious to laugh. :)</p>\n\n<p>Examples: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Do not</strong>: \"Gut Shabbos everyone... this week's Parshah\" (You already lost them!)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do not</strong>: \"Rabbi Choshuv Huffenpuff wrote a peirush on blah blah...he asks a great question...\" (again, you let them fall asleep here!)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Do Say</em></strong>: \"OK folks, I have absolute proof that Ivanka is Jewish!\" (insert joke) OK OK, So why does everyone in the media care if she is or isn't? We.. go on about the uniqueness of the Jewish people etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Do Say</em></strong>: \"Mrs. Mosko-noodlewitz...(The hostess) I can't believe you did this to me!! GASP!!....(wait 2 seconds for crowd's nervous tension and shock) The chocolate pie is killing my diet Its not possible to resist this sin!\" :) \"By the way, thank you for making the whole meal and all the Sabbath prep that you did for everyone, <strong>just for me</strong>.\" Why not for the other guests?

For example, to point out an interesting oddity in the <em>parasha</em>, see what people think, briefly present what some sources answer in a way that invites questions on it (or ask them yourself), and seek replies. It's a very interactive process, requires people to engage rather than to shut up and listen, and it can take up a good amount of time over the course of a meal.

Your interest is absolutely necessary for anyone else to be interested. In addition, it will allow you to sustain conversation and field unexpected responses. These benefits are especially strong if your interest causes you to study the topic, commentary, etc. more generally.</p>\n\n<p>Pick one key difficulty (including if it's one you don't  have a solution to!) or insight. This will be your jumping-off point and may indeed be all you relate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Timing</strong></p>\n\n<p>Time your interjection well. Three times in the meal that I've found to be particularly well-suited for a little Torah are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>While everyone is eating plated appetizers or soup. There's nothing to pass, and everyone is eating and may be relatively quiet.</p></li>\n<li><p>Right after all of the main course foods have gone around once, and any kids have been provided for. At this point, the hubbub of filling plates should die down, and people should be focusing on their food.</p></li>\n<li><p>Right after any kids at the table have run off to play. Fewer kids equals fewer distractions. (Of course, then the kids don't get to benefit from your brilliant discourse, but you have to pick your battles sometimes.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Getting attention</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are two ways to go here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Get everyone's attention right away by asking a (co-)host's permission to share some Torah, by announcing that's what you're doing, or by lifting a holy book and starting to speak louder than the conversation level. Benefits of this approach are that you reach everyone, and that you are less likely to have to repeat yourself. Pitfalls include that it may take some time to get everyone to stop talking, and that some people might prefer to continue their conversation and resent the intrusion.</p></li>\n<li><p>Alternatively, just start talking to one or two people next to you, maybe a little louder than other conversations, maybe not. If people find what you're saying or what your little group is discussing interesting, they'll notice eventually and either listen or join in. You may have to repeat points, and you may have to compete with other conversations, but the people who are involved are likely to be more engaged.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Starting</strong></p>\n\n<p>To begin, especially if you're doing it the organic-conversation way, I recommend conveying your personal interest and the point right off the bat, with an opening phrase such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Here's what I've been working on:</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>Here's something that i really don't get:</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>So, this comment really blew my mind this week:</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>I loved this exchange that came up on Mi Yodeya:</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then, go right into the central difficulty or insight identified above. Either you can present what you've got straightforwardly and quickly and be done, or people will react, and you'll get a good conversation going. Either way, you stand a good chance of fitting within people's attention spans and avoiding getting derailed by disruptions.</p>\n\n\n",

The Beis Yosef (OC 338:1) quotes the Rif and Rambam, who pasken like Rava, and he infers from the Rosh that he holds likewise. He therefore paskens in Shulchan Aruch (Ibid.) that only music making is forbidden, and the Mishnah Berurah (ad. loc.) emphasizes that this is true <em>even with one's hands and no instrument.</em></p>\n\n<p>The Rambam the Shulchan Aruch quotes (Shabbos 23:4) explains that the prohibition is because of Tikkun, that the instrument might break, and he might come to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds like the Rambam is saying that it is <em>d'Rabbanan</em> as a <em>gezeirah</em> on the melachah d'Oraisa of fixing. We have a rule that you cannot make a gezeirah to protect another gezeirah (Beitzah 3a et. al.). The only rationale I can think of would be to prohibit banging on the table or clapping would be as a gezeirah for instruments. As the Mishnah Berurah is explaining the Shulchan Aruch, who, in turn, is basing himself off of the Rambam, the Mishnah Berurah would seem to have a gezeirah l'gezeirah issue. </p>\n\n<p>Are we forced to say kulah chadah gezeirah hee (it was all established at the same time as one decree), or is there a separate reason for clapping that avoids this issue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My understanding of the rationale of שמא יתקן כלי שיר is that he may <em>come to bring a musical instrument to a level of usability</em>. In other words, יתקן does not mean he will fix something in the repair sense, but rather that he will fix something for use in any way, by bringing it out of a prior state of non-usability, natural or otherwise. After all, תיקון מנא -- which the idea of יתקן is clearly a reference to -- is an abstraction of מכה בפטיש, the מלאכה of completing.</p>\n\n<p>This way of framing the rationale sets up the basis for a direct גזרה on clapping, that while parallel to, is not built on top of the גזרה on playing musical instruments: you cannot clap because you may come to complete an instrument. Clapping can lead to making instruments, or at least putting on their finishing touches, just as it can lead to putting the finishing touches on broken ones, i.e. repairing them. Its the same מלאכה of מתקן מנא that we are directly worried about in both manifestations of the גזרה.</p>\n\n<p>This understanding seems to have been held by Tosafos (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=8&daf=30&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ביצה ל, א ד\"ה תנן</a>) who refer to the rationale as if it is שמא יעשה כלי שיר, that he might \"make\" a musical instrument.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the meaning of the prophecy in Ezekiel 26?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom!</p>\n\n<p>I am debating the issue of whether or not the Tanakh contains errors with a friend, who insists that Ezekiel 26 contains a false prophecy with regards to siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar.<br>\nSpecifically, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>11 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people with the sword, and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground.</p>\n  \n  <p>12 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy the houses of thy delight; and thy stones and thy timber and thy dust shall they lay in the midst of the waters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For more background, see <a href=\"http://www.ancient.eu/Tyre/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article about the history of Tyre</a></p>\n\n<p>I have checked my favorite commentary (ArtScroll Commentary by Eisemann) and the issue is not addressed, although there were helpful notes regarding the breaks in the passage.</p>\n\n<p>There are several proposed solutions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Ezekiel was simply wrong (especially about Nebuchadnezzar plundering the riches of Tyre).  He tries to correct this in chapter 29.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ezekiel was referring to both Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the Great (as suggested by some Christian apologists).  This is because the pronoun in verse 12 switches from \"he\", referring to Nebuchadnezzar, to \"they\" referring to the nations in verse 3.  This seems unlikely because verses 7- 14 form a unit within the text.  I am not a scholar in this regard but am open to the possibility of the Hebrew grammar allowing for this.</p></li>\n<li>This verse was fulfilled with the siege of Nebuchadnezzar because the related passage in ch. 29 mentions only the plunder not equaling the effort.  The old city of Tyre on the mainland was indeed destroyed in the siege, although verse 8 could refer to this with the phrase \"daughters in the field\".  It also seems unlikely that Tyre, which is referred to as being on an island in the sea multiple times, is not in view here. However, <a href=\"https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1941/06/nebuchadnezzars-siege-of-tyre\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this Christian website</a> suggests that it might be the case.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Which one of these would be the most appropriate response in light of the accusation that the account is erroneous? (i.e. that Nebuchadnezzar did not conquer the island portion of Tyre and destroy it in the manner described?)</p>\n\n<p>Per the historical and archaeological records mentioned in the first article, the mainland portion of the city was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, although the island portion was not.  The verses above suggest that the island part of Tyre would be utterly destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar.  This did not happen until the time of Alexander the Great, well after Nebuchadnezzar's death.  How can we reconcile this apparent discrepency with what what we know to be true from reliable historians like Josephus?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for any help!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>Abarbanel</strong> discusses this issue in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Abarbanel_on_Ezekiel.26.1.7-8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his commentary on Yechezkel 26:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>השאלה השישית בכפל המאמרים שאמר הנביא על מפלת צור כי אחרי שאמר ושחתו חומות צור והרסו מגדליה וסחתי עפרה ממנה ונתתי אותה לצחיח סלע משטח חרמים תהיה בתוך הים מה צורך לומר שנית בתתי אותה עיר נחרבת כערים אשר לי נושבו בהעלות עליך את תהום וכסוך המים הרבים וכן שאר הפסוקים, ומכלל זה שבא נבואה אחד על נגיד צור בן אדם אמור לנגיד צור ואחריה נבואה אחרת על מלך צור ואם הנגיד הוא המלך או המלך הוא הנגיד כדעת המפרשים למה באו שתי נבואות על המלך והיה די באחת מהן ולמה בפרשה הראשונה נזכר שם צר חסר בענין הנגיד ובנבואה האחרת נזכר שם צור מלא בענין המלך. והנני מפרש הפסוקים באופן יותרו השאלות האלה כולם:\nהכוונה הכוללת בנבואה הזאת היא להודיע לנביא שבעבור שצור עם היותה קרובה ושוכנת אצל ירושלם ואוהבת אותה שמחה בחרבנה בחושבה שכל הסוחרים והסחורות שהיו באים לירושלם ילכו אליה ותמלא צור מחרבנה של ירושלם, לכן הודיע השם לנביא שתי מפלות שתבואנה על צור האחת על ידי נבוכד נצר מלך בבל שיעלה עליה בעם רב ומלכים רבים וכפרי צור אשר בשדה יחרוב ויהרוג אנשיהם ויבא על צור ויבנה עליה דיק וישפוך סוללה ושאר כלי המלחמה ויכנס בעיר כבוא אדם בעיר מבוקעה אין חומה, וירמוס כל חוצותיו ויהרוג אנשיה וישלול שללה והן החומות יהרוס ובתי חמדתם יתוץ והאבנים והעצים והעפר ישליכו לתוך הים ותשאר כצחיח סלע שלא ישב אדם שם אבל לבד יהיה צור משטח חרמים לדייגים שישכנו שמה וישטחו רשיותם וחרמיהם ולא תעשה שם סחורה אחרת, והמפלה השנית הודיעו אחרי זאת שהיא יותר גדולה ממנה לאין שיעור והיתה על ידי אלכסנדרוס מוקדון, ושיכנס הים בצור וכל המדינה תשקע בים ועל זה ירעשו האיים וכל נשיאי הים וישומו על זה איך נאבדה העיר ההוללה הזאת שתשאר נחרבת כערים אשר לא נושבו מעולם ושיכסוה מי הים באופן שלא יהיה עוד במקומה יישוב, ובימים ההם תושע יהודה וישראל ישכון לבטח בארץ החיים, וצוה השם לנביא שישא על צור קינה מסחורותיה ועושרה ומהסוחרים והסחורות שיבאו אליה מאפסי ארץ והאניות והדוגיאות הבאות אליה, ואיך יקוננו עליה עתה כל תופשי משוט וכן המלחים וכן כל חובלי הים המנהיגים אותה, ואחר שהודיעו השם שתי המפלות העתידות לבא על צור הודיעו ענין המושל אם בזמן המפלה הראשונה שהיה עליהם נגיד ויגבה לבו בממשלתו בחכמתו בהנהגה והודיעו שיבואו עליו עריצי גוים שהם הכשדיים ויהרגוהו, ואם בזמן המפלה השנית שיעשה אלכסנדרוס מוקדון שאז יהיה מולך מלך על צור והגיד מחרבנו ושפלותו ושישוממו עליו הבלהות ולא יהיה עוד מלך על צור עד עולם.:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation:\nThe sixth question is in the multiplication of the [speeches?] that the prophet spoke about the fall of Tyre, for after he said \"And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.

A minority of the commentators, lead by the Abarbanel, attempt to differentiate an essential distinction between these two, and explain, that every lamentation is directed at a different person (but both appear as symbols of the kingdom). However, Yechezkel is accustomed to adding near the title 'king' also the title 'prince' [Nasi]. It's therefore possible, that also for the pair of 'prince' [Nagid] and 'king' he diversified his tongue, not for an essential distinction but for stylization purposes. In paragraph A he wishes to emphasize: \"and thou hast said: I am a god...yet thou art man, and not God...\" and one can be content here with, and perhaps it's even better to use the title 'prince' [Nagid]. And in paragraph B, in which the greatness and grandeur of the king is described, there the title 'king' is more relevant.</p>\n<p>Note: Daat Mikra mention previously in their intro to ch. 26 of the story of Tyre's double destruction with Nevuchadnezzar and Alexander but don't make any further mention of Alexander.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<h1>The Idea in Brief</h1>\n\n<p>The plain reading and normal reading of Scripture indicates that Nebuchadnezzar would destroy the sister cities of Tyre “on the mainland,” which would result in the dissolution of the fame and fortune of the ISLAND city state from that point forward. Centuries later “they” (someone indicated in the text in contradistinction to Nebuchadnezzar) would throw the timbers and debris of the ISLAND city-state into the water.</p>\n\n<h1>Discussion</h1>\n\n<p>The ancient city-state of Tyre was comprised of the erstwhile island proper (no longer extant) in addition to a cluster of sister cities on the mainland (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezek%2026:6&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezek 26:6</a>). According to the prophecy of Ezekiel, the city-state would become a place for spreading of fishing nets.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezek%2026:5&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Ezekiel 26:5</strong></a> (NASB)<br>\n   She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,’ declares the Lord God, ‘and she will become spoil for the nations.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezek%2026:14&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Ezekiel 26:14</strong></a> (NASB)<br>\n   “I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will be built no more, for I the Lord have spoken,” declares the Lord God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The word for Tyre in Hebrew is <a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=nasb&strongs=h6865\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>צֹר</strong></a> (<em>tsōre</em>), which means (island) rock. Ezekiel indicated that Tyre would be stripped of its glory as the center of international trade and commerce, so that what would be left would be a “bare rock” -- that is, a bare “Tyre” where fishing nets would be spread. <strong><em>In other words, the prophecy here was not that the city-state would be uninhabited, but that its glory and fame would never be rebuilt.</em></strong> What the reader must infer is that when fishing nets are spread out, someone necessarily (in this case fishermen) are spreading the fishing nets, since inanimate fishing nets cannot and do not spread themselves out by themselves. So there is no prophecy that the city-state would never be inhabited again, but that the city-state would never be rebuilt (to its former days of glory) from the time of Nebuchadnezzar’s seige of the sister cities of Tyre “on the mainland.” Ezekiel prophesied that the Lord would debase the once glorious city-state, whose glory and arrogance were then compared to an erstwhile anointed but arrogant cherub in heaven (<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezek%2028:11-19&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezek 28:11-19</a>). It is this glory and fame that would never be rebuilt. (The erstwhile anointed but arrogant cherub was neither eliminated in <em>that</em> narrative.) The glorious rock of Tyre has become a “bare rock” of fisheries, which is the state of the current area and <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2012/Feb-28/164861-tyre---a-city-living-on-hope-and-resilience.ashx#axzz28URbo3Iw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">municipality of “Tyre” today</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now one might ask whether the passage here also speaks of the destruction of the ISLAND city-state by Nebuchadnezzar, when in fact various secular historical sources indicate that it was Alexander the Great, who several centuries later was the one who leveled the ISLAND city-state. That is, secular history indicates that Nebuchadnezzar never leveled the ISLAND city-state proper. We agree with this assessment. Why? Again, the plain and normal reading of the this passage in Ezekiel does not indicate that Nebuchadnezzar was to level the ISLAND city-state, but the daughters of Tyre, who were “on the mainland.”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2026%3A8&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Ezekiel 26:8</strong></a> (NASB)<br>\n  <sup>8</sup> He will slay your daughters on the mainland with the sword; and he will make siege walls against you, cast up a ramp against you and raise up a large shield against you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The phrase “on the mainland” is <strong><a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=nasb&strongs=h7704\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בַּשָּׂדֶ֖ה</a></strong> (<em>bsä·deh'</em>) in Hebrew, which literally means “in the field.” According to Ezekiel, the direct attack was not against the ISLAND city-state proper in the water, but against the cluster of sister cities of Tyre “on the mainland.” The parsing of this verse (through cantillation) makes this logic very evident in a visual sense. Please click on the image to enlarge.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PVawW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PVawW.png\" alt=\"This image depicts the visual parsing of Ezekiel 26:8 through Hebrew cantillation.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>One of the most powerful benefits of cantillation is to understand the logical parsing of the verse. That is, cantillation has as much abstract value (musical accompaniment) as logical value (parsing structure of the verse) for understanding Hebrew prose and poetry. In other words, all the words and phrases in the blue box modify all the words and phrases in the red box. (There are also three “sub” arrangements of modifying phrases in the blue box.) <strong><em>The second half of the verse is not referring to the island city-state, but the destruction of the sister cities “on the mainland.”</em></strong></p>\n\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n\n<p>So what we can conclude is that the sister mainland cities affiliated with Tyre were to be razed by Nebuchadnezzar. Since these sister cities “on the mainland” were affiliated with the ISLAND city-state of Tyre, Ezekiel refers to them all collectively as “you” (singular pronoun), which causes confusion when we translate these verses into English. That is, while Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx (among others) are separate and distinct boroughs, we may refer to them all as one entity by use of the name of the same city to which they all belong in the singular sense.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, and very important to note, verse 12 goes from the singular (Nebuchadnezzar) to the plural (someone other than Nebuchadnezzar)...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2026%3A12&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezekiel 26:12</a></strong> (NASB)</p>\n  \n  <p>Also <strong><em>they</em></strong> will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise, break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses, and throw your stones and your timbers and your debris into the water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The “throwing of timbers and your debris into the water” did not occur until almost 200 years later, when others (not Nebuchadnezzar, but “they”) who would actually level the ISLAND city-state proper. </p>\n\n\n",

And what is the difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch (Shemos 12:11) explains 'פסח is a limp, stepping haltingly over something', while writing (Tehillim 35:15) צלע means 'to limp, not actually falling but the reeling which precedes an impending fall'. </p>\n\n<p>Both words are connected in the way someone moves in a 'limping' manner, but they are different in <em>why</em> the person is limping. Pesach is generally purposeful limping (moving awkwardly over a Jewish house then an Egyptian house) while צלע is involuntary limping before falling.</p>\n\n<p>In the pesukim you mention, perhaps one understanding is that until Yaakov Avinu was healed, he was on the verge of falling. (He <em>did</em> use a staff) On the other hand, פסח refers to someone who also was born with such a disability. More than צלע where someone else may have used freewill to damage your means of mobility, perhaps פסח is Hashem purposefully creating someone with this disability from birth to accomplish their life mission.</p>\n\n<p>Another thought: the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.21.18?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Malbim_on_Leviticus%2C_Emor.47.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim (Emor 47)</a> writes \"או פסח: שם \"פסח\" כולל בין ברגלו אחת בין בשתי רגליו אחר שמצאנו (שמואל ב ט יג) \"והוא פסח בשתי רגליו\" וזה ההבדל בין פסח ובין צולע. שהצולע הוא על ידי שנשמט הירך והולך על צלע אחת. והפסח דולג\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Beginner's Steps to Keeping Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know some people who want to start keeping shabbos, but they don't know all the laws or where to start. They already do kabbolas shabbos and the friday night seudah with kiddush and birkas hammozon, but they want to start keeping the 39 melochos.</p>\n<p>Where should they begin? Are certain melochos more important than others? (Maybe someone here can list them all, or something like that).</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I don't have sources, but I can answer from personal experience.  All of the <em>mitzvot</em> of Shabbat are important, but the ones they should start with are the ones that will make the biggest impact.  Those are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Those that are easy for them to do, because early successes make the whole task seem less daunting.</p></li>\n<li><p>Those that involve a fundamental change <em>that they can actually do</em> now, because these changes give them something big to point to to say both (a) I accomplished something and (b) and if I could do <em>that</em> then surely I can do (whatever the next one is).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What exactly these are will vary from person to person.  In my case, for example, it was not too difficult to change my work schedule so that I could be home before candle-lighting time on Friday -- an example of #2, <em>really</em> setting aside my employment for Shabbat.  On the other hand, when I began to observe Shabbat I lived several miles from the nearest synagogue, so not driving wasn't going to happen at that time.  (I needed my Shabbat community more than I needed to not kindle that particular flame.)  Later -- much later -- I moved and solved that problem, but I couldn't have done it at the beginning.  For others it could be the reverse -- maybe you already live near shuls but you're going to need to find a new job to fix the work schedule.  Work was in category 1 for me and driving in category 2; for you it could be the reverse.</p>\n\n<p>Further, don't neglect the \"do\"s and the \"small\" things.  People new to Shabbat tend, in my experience, to think of it mostly as the \"thou shalt nots\".  It can take a while to get into the head-space of Shabbat being a <em>welcome separation from ordinary time</em> instead of a day of restrictions.  So make sure to take on the positive things!  Festive meals with family/friends make a big difference.  Join a torah-study group on Shabbat morning or an afternoon class on something that interests you.  Do things that help you relax and enjoy the day (without introducing <em>melachot</em> -- e.g. some people relax by gardening, but instead try walks in the park where you can appreciate others' flowers instead).</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat is a process.  As soon as you're somewhat comfortable with what you're already doing, try to take on the next thing, whatever it is.  When choosing, in addition to the two factors I mentioned, try to prefer <em>d'oraita</em> obligations -- the <em>d'rabbanans</em> are important too, but the divine punishment for violating <em>d'oraita</em> prohibitions is more severe, so start there.  But if there's some <em>d'rabbanan</em> thing that makes you say \"oh hey, I could do that easily enough\" -- then <em>do it</em>.  The more you can do and actually integrate into your weekly routine, the easier it will be to do the others.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Since the number of laws and minhagim that pertain to Shabbat are so large and so varied, it is easy for a beginner to feel overwhelmed and to focus on all of the mistakes that they are making. While this approach is natural, it is likely to lead to their being discouraged, feeling that they've already \"broken\" shabbes, and not believing in their own ability to keep it meaningfully.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I would recommend focusing on those things that one <em>can</em> do, and then structuring one's day around that. Depending on your friend's personal proclivities, this might involve certain types of board games that they can play with family, books that they might want to read, or even simply going for a walk.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of malachot, I would also advocate a distinction between clearly biblical prohibitions and rabbinic prohibitions. Don't beat yourself up over the fact that you inadvertently carried outside an eruv, for example, or that you caved and bought yourself a Coke. (For that matter, don't beat yourself up over <em>any</em> transgression: acknowledge it and move on). As Monica noted in her excellent answer, observing Shabbat is a process. Ultimately, as things start to become second nature, so you will be able to do it more easily and move on to those things that require greater deliberation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would do a combined approach of do's and dont's:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do: start with kiddush, seudot, prayer and some learning and havdala</li>\n<li>Don't: avoid things that are so easy, that when proposed it seems like a joke, i.e. not turning on/off 'that' particular light switch, not using your cellphone while in the seuda/prayer, not buying stuff (instead but before Shabbat), among others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One should build this in a very gradual, step-by-step manner, maybe a change every two weeks.\nAnd make sure to ask your LOR for a good progression for each individual.</p>\n\n\n",

This principle means that when you have two <em>mitzvot</em> to do, one of which is done frequently and the other of which is done infrequently, all else being equal one should do the frequent <em>mitzvah</em> first.</p>\n\n<p>An example of this is brought in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.76.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 76:12</a> which says that if you delay in davening <em>musaf</em> until the time comes for <em>mincha</em> so you're left with needing to say both <em>tefilot</em>, you should say <em>mincha</em> first because we daven <em>mincha</em> every day and <em>tadir v'she'eino tadir, tadir kodem</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>halakhic</em> principle wouldn't seem to apply in this case because we only say the <em>tefilat musaf</em> once so there's no concept of \"first\" or \"second\" (although every time the day is mentioned, <em>shabbat</em> actually always <strong>does</strong> come before the <em>chag</em> so it seems the principle is adhered to there). The principle of <em>tadir</em> has nothing to do with which text should be used.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The musaf we pray include shabbat and chag hamatsot and shabbat (or hamanoach following Rashi and the Shulchan Aruch) is mentioned before chag hamatsot in each occurence, without any contradiction with the principle of tadir kodem.</p>\n\n<p>See SA OC 490, 9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובמוסף אומר סדר מוסף יום חול המועד, אלא שמזכיר של שבת, ואומר: \"ותתן לנו את יום המנוח הזה ויום חג המצות הזה\", וכן אומר: \"את מוספי יום המנוח הזה ויום חג המצות הזה\", וחותם \"מקדש השבת וישראל והזמנים\". ומפטירין \"היתה עלי\":‏</p>\n  \n  <p>...   he say this day of musefey (plural of musaf)  ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Gemara Betsa 17b with the comment of Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובמוספין מתחיל כו' אלא בהא הלכתא כרבי דאמר אף חותם בה מקדש השבת ישראל \n  והזמנים ...‏</p>\n  \n  <p>On musaf he begins (with the Sabbath [formula] and closes with the Sabbath [formula], and makes mention of the holiness of the day in the middle... Said Rav Huna: The halachah is not as that pair [of scholars]) but the Halacha is as Rabbi said, that he concludes mekaddesh Hashabbat, Israel Vehazzemanim</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Musaf is a double musaf of Shabbat and Yom Tov and Shabbat is mentioned before Yom Tov in each occurence that both are mentioned.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Partial answer</p>\n\n<p>Musaph of Yom Tov is used throughout Yom Tov, whether it is Hol Hamo'ed or not. It has nothing to do with it being Shabbat. The reason seems simple. The Musaph prayer replaces the actual Musaph sacrifice. On any holiday, this Musaph sacrifice was offered throughout all the days of the holiday.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, on Shabbat, we include the mentioning of the Shabbat Musaph offering along with the holiday one.</p>\n\n<p>If your wondering why not use the Shabbat Musaph text and just include the paragraph for the Yom Tov Muspah offering (i.e. the one paragraph) - I would surmise that an integra; part of the holiday Musaph text includes mentioning of <em>aliyah laregel</em> - the mention of the \"pilgrimage\" - which is absent from the text of the Shabbat Musaph.</p>\n\n<p>I'll have to research something that addresses the Torah reading.</p>\n\n\n",

The only holiday on which <em>all</em> of the Shabbat restrictions are in effect (plus some others as well) is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yom Kippur</a>.</p>\n\n<p>19 April 2017 was not a holiday on the Jewish calendar; however, it was the day after the 8th day of Passover which is celebrated in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">diaspora</a> and is one of the days when many of the Shabbat restrictions are in place. It seems likely that Passover is what your friend was referring to.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>There is some debate among the <em>halakhic</em> authorities about where on earth the date line should be for the purposes of Jewish law. I am far from an expert on this, but I believe there are a few varying opinions about when to observe Shabbat and holidays in certain places within and on the western side of the Pacific Ocean. In particular, I think there are at least some opinions that some locations should celebrate Shabbat on Sunday. According to those opinions, it may be that April 19 was itself the 8th day of Passover. If your friend lives in Hawaii, Samoa, or Japan this may be the case. I don't know what any of those places do in practice, so I can't say for sure that this is even a possibility but it's possible that it's a possibility so hey at least there's that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I did some research on this as it came up on the Biblical HermeneuticsSE. It does seem that the High Sabbath or \"Second Sabbath\" is a Christian concept, based on a passage from the Gospel of Luke, which refers to Jesus's disciples gleaning grain on the \"second first sabbath\" (in Greek but not usually translated literally). This term is understood by some to mean a \"second sabbath\" or \"high sabbath,\" as mentioned in @Daniel's answer. The real meaning, according to <a href=\"https://ronconte.com/2011/01/13/what-is-the-second-first-sabbath-luke-61/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> relates to the \"first sabbath after Pesach.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second first Sabbath is the first Sabbath after the first Sabbath\nof Passover. The first Sabbath of Passover is used as a starting point\nfor counting the seven weeks (and seven Sabbaths) until the Feast of\nWeeks. The day after the first Sabbath of Passover is day one in that\ncount... [There is also] the first Sabbath in the count of seven\nSabbaths to the Feast of Weeks (which is held on the day after that\n7th Sabbath, i.e. the fiftieth day, or Pentecost). So there are two\nfirst Sabbaths: the first Sabbath during Passover... and the first Sabbath after Passover, which is\nthe second first Sabbath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>If anyone can confirm this or refute it, I'd like get back the BHSE people and let them know.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>On regular Sabbath you can't weave, nor bake food. On most holidays you can bake food but not weave. Yom Kippur is described as a \"Sabbath of Sabbaths\" as it's a holiday but follows the extra restrictions (no cooking), and what's more adds the restrictions on eating as well. That's all.</p>\n\n\n",

However, when it came time for Yizkor, I requested that someone without parents take the sefer, as I felt that it was inappropriate for a non-yatom to have a place of prominence during the proceedings. (Our custom is for the sifrei Torah to be held on either side of the sha\"tz during the recitation of Yizkor.)</p>\n\n<p>Are there any sources which discuss this issue, and if not, is there a common practice in schuls where non-yetomim remain inside for Yizkor?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In most shuls that I daven at, the sifrei torah are placed on the bima during yizkor. That way, the people who were holding them can either go outside, or stand and say yizkor with proper kavana.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>According to an article written by <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=rqoDM4CKItkC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=do%20children%20need%20to%20leave%20during%20yizkor&source=bl&ots=Ynr3sYcZsg&sig=qYGUND82rKvqzzfFmYUX4SgxMTU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4gtGJzrPTAhVByoMKHfe2B5U4ChDoAQgoMAE#v=onepage&q=do%20children%20need%20to%20leave%20during%20yizkor&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi / Sir Immanuel Jakobovits</a>, sending children out during Yizkor is based on the shul's custom, and one should not alter from that custom. He recommends that children and non-orphans read a special \"Prayer of Thanksgiving\". I haven't been able to locate that reference in that link, but, B\"N, I'll hunt a bit more.</p>\n\n<p>I have been to a number of shuls where the rabbi specifically tells non-orphans to stay in shul so that they can recite the communal <em>El Maleh</em> for partisans, Hollocaust victims, 9/11 victims, veterans, Israeli soldiers, etc. I.e. - he feels this is a communal event. (Personally, I think his main motive is to speed the davening and avoid the noise and confusion caused by a huge mass leaving and re-entering the shul. That makes a lot of sense to me.)</p>\n\n<p>It seems that having children and other non-orphans remain in shul is becoming a somewhat popular \"trend\" in \"modern\" shuls. Years ago (about 15 - 20) it seemed to be practice in many Conservative shuls. But, I have seen this become a bit more popular in \"modern\" Orthodox shuls (meaning non yeshivish or Hassidic) within the last 10 years or so. It's far from \"mainstream\", from what I can tell, but, it seems to be occurring more frequently, now. I can't say how much of this trend is influenced by viewing Yizkor as being a \"family experience\" (i.e., grandson should say Yizkor from grandpa, for example), is it to have more people recite the \"communal\" Yizkor, or is it just a decorum issue, as stated above.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is this Mishnah repeated regarding backing out of sales?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The last stitch of the Mishnah in Demai 3:2 reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היה עומד ולוקח וראה טען אחר יפה ממנו, מתר להחזיר, מפני שלא משך. </p>\n  \n  <p>If one is ready to purchase something [but has not yet made an acquisition on them] and finds a better bundle, he may back out, since he has not acquired them. (Translation based on Bartenura.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How is this different than the following Mishnah in Bava Metzi'a 4:2?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיצד משך הימנו פירות ולא נתן לו מעות אינו יכול לחזור בו. נתן לו מעות ולא משך הימנו פירות יכול לחזור בו. אבל אמרו מי שפרע מאנשי דור המבול ומדור הפלגה הוא עתיד ליפרע ממי שאינו עומד בדיבורו. </p>\n  \n  <p>How is this? If one acquired fruit but did not give him payment, he may not back out. If one paid but did not acquire the fruit, he may back out, but [the Rabbis] said, \"He Who punished the people of the Generation of the Flood and the Generation of the Dispersion will ultimately punish those who don't stand by their word.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Further, while the Halacha in Demai is technically true, it's only half the story: it doesn't address Chazal's curse. To be fair, it is unclear whether the Mishnah is dealing with a case where the money was given or not, so it is possible that the Mi Shepara wouldn't apply there. However, the first question still stands: either it's dealing with the same case or it's dealing with one even more obvious and is still redundant. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yachin_on_Mishnah_Demai.3.13.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiferes Israel Yachin 3:13</a> explains the reason for permission to return:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וראה טוען אחר יפה ממנו מותר להחזיר מפני שלא משך\nדמשיכתו לא היתה ע\"ד לקנות. וקמ\"ל אף דמדאורייתא מעות קונית עכ\"פ הכא הם אמרו והם אמרו. הם אמרו לעשר דמאי. והם אמרו דבכה\"ג לא יהיו מעות קונות:</p>\n<p><em>If one is ready to purchase something and finds a better bundle, he may back out, since he has not acquired them</em>. In this case even his <em>meshikha</em> is not intended to acquire (be a <em>kinyan</em>). It comes to teach (a novel idea) regarding one who agrees that by the law of Torah a money payment makes acquisition. In any case here neither side of the argument yields an acquisition. If one holds that money acquires, one needs (to complete acquision) by further extracting <em>ma'aser</em> from the <em>dem'ai</em> due to doubt, because of the principle regarding <em>dem'ai</em>: \"<em>ein davar motzei metachas yado davar sheino Mesukan</em>\"(as noted in the comments). If one believes that money does not acquire then there is no acquisition. Either way <em>meshikha</em> itself does not acquire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By contrast, in the mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Metzia.4.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 4.2</a> <em>meshikha</em> acquires.</p>\n\n\n",

In verse 20 specifically, Hulda predicts</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לכן הנני אספך אל עמך ונאספת אל קברתיך בשלום ולא תראינה עיניך בכל הרעה אשר אני מביא על המקום הזה וישיבו את המלך דבר</p>\n<p>Therefore I will gather you unto your people and you shall be gathered unto your grave in peace and your eyes shall not see the evil that I am bringing on this place. And the brought this matter to the king.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>II Chronicles 34:25 repeats this prediction for Josiah almost verbatim.</p>\n<p>After a fruitful reign, Josiah was killed by Egyptian archers after refusing to allow Pharaoh Necho to pass through his land to do battle at Carchemish on the Euphrates, as detailed in II Kings 23 and II Chronicles 35.</p>\n<p>Necho's invasion essentially spelled the end of Judean independence. The heir apparent was taken to Egypt and imprisoned and Josiah's other son was installed on the throne as an Egyptian tributary. Egypt's dominance over Judah segued into Babylon's which ended in the temple's destruction.</p>\n<p>Josiah was buried with his fathers, but his battle with Necho was the beginning of the end for his people, and he dies of battle wounds. These events seem to contradict Hulda's prophecy for Josiah's peaceful death and him not seeing his country's ruin.</p>\n<p><strong>Is Hulda's prophecy for Josiah considered not fulfilled, or are there interpretations that find it realized?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is relative uniformity across  commentators as to my question. Rashi, Metzudat David, Radak, and Malbim, (II Kings 23:20, Rashi and MD repeated in II Chron. 34:28) all state that Josiah enjoyed the fulfillment of Hulda's prophecy through his being spared the sight of the Temple's destruction. Most state that being spared this horrible sight was his peace. </p>\n\n<p>Malbim asserts that the prophecy predicts that he will be <em>buried</em> in peace, which does happen in II Kings 24:30 and II Chron. 35:24 where he is brought to Jerusalem, but it does not specify the manner of his death. He interprets the second phrase of the prophecy as being spared the sight of the destruction. Other commentators pick up on this as well. I think the diction of the prophecy is important. Josiah would be spared the sight of <em>all</em> of the tragedy that awaits his country, that is the destruction of the Temple and exile of his people, but he would witness the beginnings through Pharaoh's aggression.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>He died before the jews were exiled from their land, and the galut only happened after he died and so I would say that is a fulfillment of Your eyes will not see the evil that I am bringing on this place.</p>\n\n\n",

The Meiri defends the minhag (of his faters, \"Magen Avot\"). He try to give proofs that this is not hefsek, that this kind of amen after owns bracha (if we let say that Kel melech neeman is a form of amen) is from the kind that chachamim did praise (as for bone Yerushalaym of birkat hamazon). He says also that this is from a category of minhagim that came from midrashim, not from Talmud, and  there is not an obligation to follow it. He cites several midrashim in nusach of the birkat hashkivenu, which are not followed by the majority (as to bless hapors sucat shalom alenu in yom chol or vihi noam in motsae Yom Tov. </p>\n\n<p>For Kel Melech Neeman, he says that this minhag is followen in Provence, France and Germany.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Halacha lemaase (but lo lemaase).</p>\n\n<p>See SA OC 61, 3:</p>\n\n<p>The SA says that the KS (including BSKMLV) counts 345 words, and the ה' אלוקיכם אמת repeated aloud by the officiant adds the 3 words for 348.</p>\n\n<p>The RM Issarles says that there is no prohibition to repeat hashem ..emet with the officiant. When a person pray alone, he can count the 15 letters \"vav\" after emet, their gematria is 90 as 3 names \"havaya\" according to a special numerical combination, so 348 words are counted.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, The RM Issareles, rules that a person praying alone can say Kel Melech Neeman, but not in tsibur (the minhag of the Meiri was to say it anyway)</p>\n\n<p>He gives an other patent in tsibbur which is good for a person who reads slower than the shats, without amen after owns beracha, without purposeles interruption between bracha and shema. To say amen after the Beracha of the shats, amen is the equivalent of the 3 words Kel Melech Neeman (see SA 59, 4 who prohibits this lechaora and see Beur Halacha there).</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why don't sellers have to clean their measures after every use?",
    "content": "# Why don't sellers have to clean their measures after every use?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <em>daf yomi</em> I came across this <em>mishna</em> on Bava Batra 88a (quote with glosses is from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.88a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A storekeeper, who constantly sells merchandise in small quantities, cleans his measuring vessels twice a week and cleans his weights once a week; and he cleans the pans of his scales after each and every weighing, to ensure that no merchandise has adhered to the pans, thereby increasing their weight. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what case is this statement, that it is necessary to clean a measuring vessel, said? With regard to moist items, which are likely to adhere to the measuring vessels. But with regard to dry goods, which do not adhere to the measuring vessels, one does not need to clean his measuring vessels. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It also talks about how often a wholesaler (<em>hassiton</em>) and a producer must clean their measures.  <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088875/jewish/Genevah-Chapter-Eight.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah 8:18</a> repeats the timing rules given in the mishna.  Sefaria also cites Shulchan Arukh, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.231.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Choshen Mishpat 231:7</a>, which I can't understand in Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>I'm surprised that cleaning any less frequently than after each use (as with the scale) is permitted at all, because the torah is so concerned with the honesty of weights and measures.  I would expect any amount of adhesion to affect the validity of the measure, and the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Theft.7.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Geneivah 7:12</a>) says that the punishment for unjust weights and measures is even more severe than that for sexual prohibitions.  Given the severity of not only <em>using</em> but even <em>owning</em> unjust measures, why does halacha only require cleaning a couple times a week (shopkeeper), once a month (wholesaler), or once a year (producer)?  Is there some reason not to require cleaning after every use?  How hard is it to clean a measuring cup, after all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It seems to be a function of how likely there is to be residue that would interfere with accurate measurements. Let us look at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashbam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a>'s commentary to the different statements of <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=88&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Mishnah</a> in to see how this plays out. The earlier part of the Mishnah says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הסיטון מקנח מדותיו אחד לשלשים יום ובעל הבית אחד לשנים עשר חדש רבן שמעון בן גמליאל אומר חילוף הדברים</p>\n  \n  <p>A WHOLESALE DEALER  MUST CLEAN  HIS MEASURES ONCE IN THIRTY DAYS, AND A PRODUCER  ONCE IN TWELVE MONTHS.  R. SIMEON B. GAMALIEL SAYS: THE STATEMENT IS TO BE REVERSED. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_88.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>; capitals in original)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now why does the required cleaning interval differ for wholesalers and producers? Here is Rashbam's explanation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעה\"ב. שאינו מוכר תדיר כסיטון די בפעם לשנה שאין נדבק בו כל כך</p>\n  \n  <p>A producer. Since he doesn't sell constantly like a wholesaler, it is sufficient to [clean the measures] once a year as it doesn't stick so much.</p>\n  \n  <p>חילוף הדברים. סיטון אחת לשנה דכיון דמוכר תדיר אין מתייבש המשקה בתוכו כל כך אבל בעה\"ב מקנח כל שלשים דמתוך שאינו מוכר תדיר מתייבש בו השמן שנשאר בכלי ומתמעטת המדה</p>\n  \n  <p>The statement is to be reversed. A wholesaler [cleans] once a year because since he is constantly selling the liquid does not dry inside it that much, but a producer cleans every thirty days because since he does not sell constantly the oil that remains in the vessel dries and diminishes the measurement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So far we see that the first opinion in the Mishnah is not concerned that there will be enough residue to make an impact by a producer, while R. Shimon Ben Gamliel is not concerned about that there will be enough residue to make an impact by a wholesaler. Continuing on to the part of the Mishnah that you explicitly asked about, we find the same theme. The Mishnah says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חנווני מקנח מדותיו פעמים בשבת וממחה משקלותיו פעם אחת בשבת ומקנח מאזנים על כל משקל ומשקל</p>\n  \n  <p>A SHOPKEEPER MUST CLEAN HIS MEASURES TWICE A WEEK,  WIPE HIS WEIGHTS ONCE A WEEK AND CLEANSE THE SCALES AFTER EVERY WEIGHING. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_88.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>; capitals in original) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Rashbam's commentary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיינו טעמא לפי שהחנוני אינו חייב להטיף ללוקח שלש טיפין כדאמרי' לעיל הלכך מה שמשתייר בכלי נדבק בכלי ומשתייר הרבה והלכך צריך קינוח תדיר אבל סיטון ובעה\"ב צריך להטיף שלש טיפין ואין משתייר בכלי כי אם מעט כן נראה בעיני</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is the reason: For a shopkeeper is not obligated to pour out three drops for the buyer as was said earlier [in the Mishnah on 87a], so that which remains in the vessel gets stuck to the vessel and a lot remains; therefore it is required to constantly be cleaned. But a wholesaler and a producer are required to pour out three drops, so only a little bit remains in the vessel. This is what appears to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על כל משקל ומשקל. כל פעם שהוא שוקל שנדבק בו הרבה יותר ממשקלות והלכך על כל ליטרא וליטרא שהוא שוקל צריך לקנח מאזנים</p>\n  \n  <p>On each weighing. Every time that he weighs, since a lot more gets stuck to it than [gets stuck to] the weights. Therefore for every litra that he weighs he must clean the scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here again we see that the issue is that the scale is particularly susceptible to having residue stick to it; thus, if you don't clean it each time the measurements will be impacted. The other equipment is not as susceptible to residue getting stuck to it, so you only have to clean it at limited intervals when enough residue might have built up to impact the measurements.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yehoshua Falk</a> in his commentary to Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x10575\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">C.M. 231:18</a>) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומפני שהדבר לח מונח בכף מאזנים משו\"ה הצריכוהו לכף מאזנים קינוח בכל פעם משא\"כ המשקל שמונח בכף השניה אין צריך קינוח אלא מפני דהמודד דבר לח נוגע בידו המלוכלכת</p>\n  \n  <p>And because the moist item is placed on the end of the scale [itself] they therefore required the end of the scale to be cleaned every time. As opposed to the weight which is placed on the other end [of the scale] it is not required to be cleaned except for the fact that the one who measured the moist item touched it with his dirty hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, the differentiation between the scale and the weights is based on the greater likelihood of residue building up on the scale to impact the measurement. The underlying reason suggested here is that the moist item never comes in direct contact with the weights because the weights are on the other end of the scale. But it does come into direct contact with the scale itself and therefore there is a greater concern for the scale to be cleaned.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Biblical Hebrew Word 'Almah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Hertz Chumash, <em>The Pentateuch and Haftorahs</em>, page 202, the word <em>'almah</em> in the Tanakh means a young woman of marriageable age, unmarried or married.  In modern Hebrew <em>'almah</em> means 'miss', a title for a young unmarried woman. While this term certainly does not mean 'virgin', as major Christian Bible translations now concede (<em>NRSV, NABRE, NJB</em>), where is there an example of a married <em>'almah</em> among the seven <em>'almah</em> passages in the Tanakh (Genesis 24.43; Exodus 2.8 ; Psalm 68.26; Proverbs 30.19; Song of Songs 1.3; 6.8; Isaiah 7.14)? In the fifth century, Jerome, who translated the Tanakh from the Hebrew and was taught by Jewish teachers, wrote concerning this: '...  let them [the Jews] at least show me where the word is applied to married women as well, and I will confess my ignorance' ( <em>Against Helvidius</em> I.32). If the clause <em>ha-'almah harah</em> in Isaiah 7.14 is advanced as such a proof, then the assertion of Rashi that it is future and of Malbim that it is not must be resolved.   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The question has an unspoken, Christian-missionary-oriented premise. (Unfortunately a common subversion of this site, and one not acknowledged by either askers or answerers. Let us not pretend.) Namely, if an alma only means an unmarried woman, and an unmarried woman in Israelite society was naturally a virgin, then alma must mean virgin, and we arrive at a virgin birth.</p>\n\n<p>Other answers address, head-on, how we might find an explicit married alma amongst the very few instances in Tanach, <strong>as if</strong> that is what is indeed required. They do a good job, but one need not prove an instance of a married alma to support the assertion given from the Hertz Chumash, namely that \"the word 'almah in the Tanakh means a young woman of marriageable age, whether married or not\".</p>\n\n<p>There are different categories of words, some general and some specific. For example, an איש in Hebrew might mean a man, whether married or unmarried, whether a virgin or a non-virgin. It does not carry additional meaning. Meanwhile, a בתולה might well mean a young virgin. A בהמה can refer to a domesticated animal, such as a sheep, goat, or bovine, while an עז refers to a specific animal, a goat. Further, there are not macro and micro levels, but intermediate levels at which some attributes are specified and others are not.</p>\n\n<p>The question is whether, based on pesukim, one can establish the word עלמה as a general young female, or a young female who is specifically unmarried, or specifically a virgin.</p>\n\n<p>In Genesis 24:43, Avraham's servant is recounting the condition he imposed for identifying Yitzchak's destined bride. Earlier, in verse 14, he refers to a naara, and thus alma is a synonym of this. A naarah can be a non-virgin (see Dinah after the rape). And a naarah can be a married non-virgin (see Devarim 22). So just as naarah can be understood in the general sense, the synonym / parallel can be understood in the same general sense.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to prove that it has a specific sense of non-married, then it is upon you to cite a verse from the sparse seven verses which demonstrate that this is the required meaning. Otherwise, there is no reason to impose the non-married specific meaning.</p>\n\n<p>If Herz has said that alma meant \"a young woman of marriageable age, with no requirement that she specifically be a brunette\", then it would not be upon anyone to demonstrate that there are non-brunettes (say, redheads or blondes) among the seven verses. Similarly, he is saying that we see this general meaning, and there is no cause to specifically assert a non-married meaning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><strong>The OP asks (A)</strong>... \"Where is there an example of a married 'almah' among the 'almah' passages in the Tanakh...?\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <strong>Proverbs 30: 18-20</strong>  (18)\" There are three things that are concealed from me, and a fourth, that I do not know; (19) The way of the eagle in the heavens, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship in the heart of the sea, and the way of a man with <strong>a young woman (\"Almah\")</strong>. (20) So is the way of an adulterous woman; she eats and wipes her mouth, and she says, \"I have committed no sin.\"</p>\n\n<p>In the above Passage from the Tanakh, Proverbs gives three examples of things which are \"concealed\" in the doings of this world.</p>\n\n<p>1) An eagle's path in the heavens\n2) A serpent's trail on a rock\n3) The way of a ship through water</p>\n\n<p>Each of these things have something in common. They leave no trace after a short time. A minute later, an observer can see no evidence that an eagle, snake, or ship, have passed through. </p>\n\n<p>Proverbs then picks a 4th example similar to the three before it. The \"way\" of a man with an \"almah\" (young woman). This \"way\" in this context, is a euphemism for physical intercourse between the man and woman. After a short time, there is no trace in the woman, that a man has been there with her. (similar to the eagle, snake, and ship on their respective \"ways\")</p>\n\n<p>Verse 20 then continues to refer to this same 4th case of the \"Almah\" by calling her an \"adulterous woman\". The subject euphemism (of intercourse) is also continued with the words \"she eats and wipes her mouth\". So the verse is referring to the same case number 4 above.</p>\n\n<p>The style of the verses 18-20 depict the 4 cardinal elements of fire, water, air, and earth in the 4 cases. (eagle:air, snake:earth, ship:water, and \"love\": fire) Therefore, verse 19 and 20 are the same case of fire and there is no separate 5th case in verse 20. So the \"Almah\" of verse 19 and the adulteress of verse 20 is the same woman.</p>\n\n<p>(All of this is agreed to by the Malbim in his commentary to Proverbs 30:18-20; namely that the 4th case of the \"Almah\" and adulterous woman are one and the same, and that it is all a parable about a particular woman who betrayed her beloved king by cheating on him and trying to hide the fact (the parable used is based on the 4 elements). Malbim in a separate commentary called Be'ur HaMilim to Proverbs 30:19, says that the word \"Almah\" here means a non-virgin woman. </p>\n\n<p>Also see Ibn-Ezra to verse 30:19 - \"with a young woman: when he has illicit relations with her, he does not fear G-d when he violates the commandment of \"Do not commit adultery\"...\"</p>\n\n<p>A similar approach to the parable and assumption that the woman in verse 19 and 20 are the same, is found in Metzudas David to 30:18-20, Metzudas Tzion also identifies \"Almah\" here and in Isaiah 7:14 as a non-virgin as well.)</p>\n\n<p>Now we all know that only a married woman can be accused of adultery. A single girl who does this might be labeled promiscuous, but not an adulteress. (She is also not a virgin, since it would be easy to make a physical examination and see she has lost her virginity. Therefore the verse is speaking of a non-virgin \"Almah\" who would remain physically the same before and after intercourse; and hence her actions would be undetectable like the ways of the eagle, snake, and ship.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Therefore, Proverbs 30: 18-20, is an example of the Tanakh using the word \"Almah\" to refer to a married woman (and certainly not a virgin).</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The OP asks (B)</strong> : Is it possible for the Tanakh to refer to Isaiah's wife as an \"Almah\" and as the mother of Shearyashuv; if \"almah\" by definition, only refers to a woman who has never had children (according to Rashi and Ibn Ezra)?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>According to Rashi:</strong> Shear-Yashuv is not a real person or a son of Isaiah. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi: Isaiah 7:3 ..\"and Shear-Yashuv your son..\": The small remnant that will return to Me through you, and they are like your sons.</p>\n\n<p>Here, Rashi translates \"your son Shear-Yashuv, as a metaphor.</p>\n\n<p>So, according to Rashi, Imannuel of Isaiah 7:14 can be a son of Isaiah and his wife, who has not yet had a child in her life. This is because, according to Rashi, Isaiah's wife is not in fact the mother of a previous son named Shear-Yashuv at all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>According to Ibn-Ezra:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Ibn-Ezra does in fact believe that Shear-Yashuv is a real son of Isaiah and his wife. However, he does not say that the mother of Imannuel in 7:14 is the same mother of Shear-Yashuv in verse 7:3. So, it is possible that according to Ibn-Ezra, Isaiah had two wives. The second wife would be giving birth to her first child, Imannuel. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, we can say from Ibn-Ezra's commentary on 7:14, that he does not agree with the definition that an \"almah\" must have never given birth, since his only criteria for an \"almah\" is that the woman be young in years.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn-Ezra: \"...There is nothing in the definition (of \"Almah\") except as it relates to age...\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Note see my answer at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/43708/if-a-virgin-birth-actually-disqualifies-a-messianic-candidate-how-then-should-i/71602#71602\">If a virgin birth actually disqualifies a Messianic candidate, how then should Isaiah 7:14 be interpreted?</a></p>\n\n<p>Your question B answers question A. Thus <code>הָעַלְמָה</code> (the young woman) was married but <em>Rashi</em> say was not <strong>yet</strong> pregnant with her first child.</p>\n\n<p>That is Rashi and Ibn Ezra point to this pasuk to show that even if she was not yet pregnant, she was married to Yeshaya.

Additionally, they disagree with Rashi as to meaning that she will become pregnant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But according to the Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament,\n  a leading scientific lexicon, an 'almah is 'a young woman (until the\n  birth of a first child).'</p>\n  \n  <p>Please explain fully.

Thus, they do fit with your lexicographical citation.</p>\n\n<p>That is, Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15938#v=3&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshaya 7:3</a> says that it was not his actual son but</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and Shear-Yashuv your son</strong>: The small remnant that will return to Me\n  through you, and they are like your sons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, Radak who says that the <em>the young woman</em> is the wife of Achaz does not have to say this.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra cites <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16401#v=19&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 30:19</a> to show that the word cannot be <em>virgin</em> as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the way of a man with a young woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is given as one of those things that cannot be detected (after a short time). If she was a virgin, one could tell that she is no longer a virgin.</p>\n\n<p>This also shows that it can mean a married <strong>or</strong> unmarried woman.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15938#v=14&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 7:14</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>is with child</strong>: This is actually the future, as we find concerning\n  Manoah’s wife, that the angel said to her (Judges 13:3): “And you\n  shall conceive and bear a son,” and it is written, “Behold, you are\n  with child and shall bear a son.”</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>the young woman</strong>: My wife will conceive this year.

The question still remains: I could very well ask for what I want, even if it's detrimental to me. For that matter, I could even <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/72949/should-a-robber-pray-to-be-successful-in-robbing-a-bank?rq=1\">daven that I be successful in an aveirah</a>. Why should we daven for such things? Why don't we just go along with our day, trying to follow the Torah as best as we can, and trust that Hashem will do what is best for us? From that perspective, wouldn't asking Him for something be a failure in this self-test of emunah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Sometimes prayer is the prerequisite to us receiving things. In chapter 2, verse 5 of Breishit it says the following: \nה וְכֹל | שִׂיחַ הַשָּׂדֶה טֶרֶם יִהְיֶה בָאָרֶץ וְכָל עֵשֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶה טֶרֶם יִצְמָח כִּי לֹא הִמְטִיר יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהִים עַל הָאָרֶץ וְאָדָם אַיִן לַעֲבֹד אֶת הָאֲדָמָה:</p>\n\n<p>G-d did not bring rain until Adam prayed for it. Not because He didn't plan on there being grass on Earth - He created grass already! Rather because he wanted to give Adam an opportunity to connect to his Creator and pray for it before having it. The grass was merely 'waiting' under the Earth's surface for Adam to pray, in order for rain to fall and be able to protrude the Earth. This is according to rashi on the verse. </p>\n\n<p>I've heard the analogy given of a faucet. The water may be in the pipes but until we turn the faucet on the water will not fall. So too, for us to get what is in our pipelines we may need to pray for it. Turning on the faucet in the analogy maps to praying. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I heard that the effect of davenning is to change myself so that I am no longer the same person for whom the (present and future) situation has been arranged. Since I have changed, the original arrangements may no longer be suitable for me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yba.org.il/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%90%D7%AA-%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%94---\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This source</a> discusses the question of how it is possible to change the mind of G-d and responds</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התשובה המקובלת היא שהתפילה איננה משנה את רצון הבורא אלא את האדם המתפלל</p>\n<p>The accepted answer is that prayer does not change the will of G-d but rather changes the one who prays.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a mistaken assumption -- that the point of davening is to get things. However, the gemara describes prayer as \"avodah shebaleiv -- service which is in the heart\" (Ta'anis 2a). We pray in order to serve G-d, not in order to get Him to serve us!</p>\n\n<p>So, why do we pray, and in particular, why is so much of prayer a list of requests, if we aren't praying in order to get things?</p>\n\n<p>I can ask the same of many of the conversations I have with my parents. Why discuss my need for a raise with my dad, or parenting worries with my mother? Because part of having a relationship is leaning on others for emotional support. Even when I have little to know expectation of getting any other help from them.</p>\n\n<p>The point of prayer is to turn to one's Parent in times of trouble. Full stop.</p>\n\n<p>If this indeed changes the one who prays to the extent that G-d then decides this new person no longer requires the challenge in question, great. If could be that the primary purpose of the problem was to motivate this act of turning to Him. As our sages describe Sarah's, Rivqa's and Rachel's infertility being caused by \"Hashem desires the prayers of the righteous.\" (Yevamos 64a) Or perhaps just changing the mix of things that need addressing in one's life, one can trade in this challenge for another, hopefully smaller, one. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/82046/1570\">Avrohom Yitzchok's answer</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>But if not, the prayer was still successful as long as it remains a practice in staying connected to the Creator and therefore also to what He Created me for.</p>\n\n\n",

Talmidey Baal Shem Tov explain it this way.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, Hashem knows everyone's needs, so the reason for tfilo is not to inform Hashem about them, but to create vessels to receive the shefa. Oysies (letters of speech) create keylim (vessels) that serve as recipients of Hashem's sustenance. I.e. you can view tfilo as part of the process of creation itself.</p>\n\n<p>See: Imrey Pinchos Hasholeym, Shaar HaTfilo 1 (R' Pinchos miKoretz); Ben Poyras Yoysef, Parshas Noyach, d\"h \"Oyfn 2, al pi soyd\" (R' Yakoyv Yoysef miPolnoe); Maggid Dvorov leYakoyv 269 (Mezheritcher Maggid R' Doyv Ber miMezhritch).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Along similar lines to the previous answers, my understanding of the medrash is that G-d did not create this world to exist as a self-contained one.  Thus, while we see that indeed most creatures receive sustenance and offspring without engaging G-d through actual tefilla, this is not the ideal way of the world for which it was created. Rather this type of undeserved bestowal of good is part of the idea of \"<em>olam chessed yibaneh</em>\" - \"world built with kindness\" as a necessary prerequisite to achieve the actual purpose of creation, where man recognizes G-d and interacts directly with Him through the <em>avoda</em> and <em>tefilla</em>.  If not for this ultimate <em>din</em> (give-and-take) level, nothing else would have been created.  Thus, those who receive without any level of acknowledging G-d, are receiving in the same way animals receive their needs, in a role that is not the purpose of creation.  </p>\n\n<p>We find a similar idea in the contrast between the sustenance of Egypt, which receives its needs in a relatively predictable, closed system involving the Nile, and that of Israel, which is uniquely non-deterministic and unpredictable with regard to its weather patterns.  As such, Israel is forced to acknowledge and engage G-d, thereby fulfilling theirs and the world's <em>raison d'etre</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Another example is the way an infant's needs are provided for via unique and innate instincts and behaviors, such as sucking and nursing. As it develops and is able to fend for itself, these instincts and relationships are no longer the same source of nourishment.  </p>\n\n\n",

When I see one of these decrees recorded in the Mishna, I find it interesting to think about what particular problem R' Yochanan was trying to solve, what had caused the problem, and how he chose to address it.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.4.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Rosh Hashana 4:4</a>, we find the following decree:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי יהושע בן קרחה ועוד זאת התקין רבן יוחנן בן זכאי. שאפילו ראש בית דין בכל מקום. שלא יהוא העדים הולכין אלא למקום הוועד</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha said, \"This too did Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai ordain: even if the head of the court would be in any [other] place, the witnesses need not go anywhere [else], but to the place of meeting [of the court].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The issue here is that in the existing process for declaring a new month, the formal declaration was made specifically by the head of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin</a>. R' Yochanan decreed that thenceforth, the process could be completed without the head if he was not available in the Sanhedrin's meeting-place.</p>\n<p>Clearly, this decree is related the the fact that after the Destruction, the Sanhedrin was relocated from Jerusalem to Yavneh. Presumably, it has something to do with post-Destruction turmoil and uncertainty.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm curious, though, what <em>particular circumstances</em> led R' Yochanan to make this decree.</strong> After the Sanhedrin moved, did its head not move with it? Did he spend more time traveling, for some reason? Was R' Yochanan just hedging against general uncertainty about the locations of the Sanhedrin and its head, now that the fixed point of Jerusalem had been destroyed? Did some particular incident spur this decree?</p>\n<p>For some other decrees, the Mishna tells us about specific incidents or problems that led to them. (See, e.g. Rosh Hashana <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.1.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:2</a>.)

So he goes on (in ch. 18 there, <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=20125#p=76\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pp. 67ff</a>) to relate this enactment to that: now that RYBZ, the Av Beis Din, was living elsewhere, the witnesses should come to the central Beis Din in Yavneh.</p>\n\n\n",

That's why one may cook it after it was roasted.</p>\n\n<p>As opposed to meat that waited 72 hours and the blood has congealed, we worry that the roasting didn't remove all the blood, and cooking may then soften and remove the leftover blood; (mixing it into your food and rendering the entire mixture unkosher).</p>\n\n<p>And that's why in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.73.1?lang=bi&p2=Summary_of_Shakh_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.73.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">73:1 - סימן עג - דין צלית הכבד</a> - the Shulchan Aruch says that liver must first be roasted, but then can be cooked after it was roasted.</p>\n\n<p><strong>א:</strong> הַכָּבֵד, יֵשׁ בּוֹ רִבּוּי דָּם. לְפִיכָךְ לְכַתְּחִלָּה אֵין לוֹ  תַּקָּנָה לְבַשְּׁלוֹ עַל יְדֵי מְלִיחָה, אֶלָּא קוֹרְעוֹ שְׁתִי וָעֵרֶב וּמַנִּיחַ חִתּוּכוֹ לְמַטָּה, וְצוֹלֶהוּ שֶׁיְּהֵא רָאוּי  לַאֲכִילָה (או''ה נתיב ט''ו), וְאַחַר כָּךְ יָכוֹל לְבַשְּׁלוֹ.‏</p>\n\n\n",

Eventually, something comes up that nobody had noticed before that makes Shprintze's conversion invalid. (Let's assume, for the sake of the question, that her conversion is actually invalid, and not just out of doubt.) She and Berel plan to convert once again the following week. </p>\n\n<p>Reuven eats over at Yankel's house Shabbos day, and Yankel, being very close with Reuven, decides to reveal this piece of information, trusting him to keep it a secret. (Please don't ask about any questions of how Reuven may have violated some piece of Halacha by eating there. Just go with it.)</p>\n\n<p>Shabbos afternoon comes. They've got eight guys for a minyan, including Reuven. Just before they give up at finding a minyan, in walks Yankel and Berel. Perfect! Ten guys for a minyan. </p>\n\n<p>Except... Berel isn't Jewish. Everyone thinks he is. </p>\n\n<p>Except for Reuven. </p>\n\n<p>(Again, ignore the halachic issues that may surround a non-Jew being in a shul.)</p>\n\n<p>The chazzan stands up to begin Ashrei. Yankel and Berel, for some reason oblivious to the problem they've just started, quietly take their seat in the back of the shteible and are making no effort to stop the minyan now in progress. </p>\n\n<p>What should Reuven do? </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Should he allow the minyan to go on, causing the chazzan to say Kaddish and Kedushah without a minyan, as well as the Brachos Levatalos involved in repeating Shemoneh Esrei?</li>\n<li>Or should he stop him, thereby embarrassing Berel in front of everybody?</li>\n<li>If he asks Berel to step out, he's stopping the minyan, which will still cause embarrassment to Berel, albeit not as much as the previous option. Still, he will be put in the awkward situation of explaining his actions to the kehillah, which could still lead to the secret coming out. </li>\n<li>Or maybe he should pretend he needs the bathroom for long enough that the minyan disbands, which would possibly lead to his needing to lie about his whereabouts or else spill the beans. </li>\n<li>There is no option to find another tzenter; remember, they were struggling enough to find a ninth person until Yankel and Berel came along. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.303?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rama on YD 303</a> says that should a person find someone wearing kilayim on the street unbeknownst to him he shall not tell him that on the street in order to save him from embarrassment, for were he to tell him he would be obligated to unclothe himself of that garment.</p>\n<p>According to the Rama it is as such even when it is kilayim min hatorah.</p>\n<p>On this basis we may let the prayers proceed as although there will be brochot le'vatalah we are saving one from embarrassment.</p>\n<p>However the Shaggas Aryeh in siman 58' holds that being that we are causing one to do a maaseh avairah not in a passive state we may not allow one's embarrassment to override it.</p>\n<p>Still <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Rosh_Hashanah.33a.5.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot says in Rosh Ha'Shanah 33a</a> that a bracha lavatalah is a derabannan only and thus once again the embarrassment will override.</p>\n<p>Another point to consider is that even according to those that say it is min hatorah nevertheless here it shall be de'rabanan, being that by shevuah (in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.239.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">siman 239</a>) there is a concept of haadom bishvuah meaning that a shvuah when sworn on the ground that it is a shevuat emet (being that he thinks the circumstances are as such) wont be considered shevuat shov or sheker.</p>\n<p>Therefore by us being that the issur of berachah levatalah comes one and the same as by shvuat shove the same concept shall apply there. Thus, since they think they have minyan the berochot are not considered le'vatalah, and again we may let the teffilah proceed.</p>\n<p>However I would like to conclude with a solution that should turn the entire issue derabanan and would surely won't be a problem. The one who knows the truth he shall be the sheliach tsibbur and being that he knows there is no minyan, he shall have in mind that it shall a teffilat nedavah, and then the only issue would be the kedusha which although it is said with a minyan only is only a question of a de'rabanan.</p>\n<p>In conclusion prayers may proceed and best would be that he himself be the sheliach tsibbur.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While I'm not sure of the best way to prevent embarrassment to Berel, davening a \"minyan\" with only 9 halachic jews is obviously not an option. While it is important not to embarrass someone, it is not important enough to make many berachos levatalos. Obviously though, the best option would <em>not</em> be to flat-out reveal that Berel is not a jew. Rather, like you suggested, Reuven should perhaps excuse himself to the bathroom, or use some other method, to both stop the minyan and prevent embarrassment to Berel. In no way, however, is it more important to not embarrass Berel than to daven a minyan with 9 people. </p>\n\n<p>-And just to add, even if a tenth person will not be found, davening with only 9 people is just as good as davening be'yichidus!</p>\n\n\n",

I hope the information above helps you decide.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In light of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1769/gavriel\">Gavriel</a>'s comment I went in search of concurring source material. I found in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ben_Ish_Hai,_Halachot_1st_Year,_Masei.14.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ben Ish Hai, Halachot 1st Year, Masei 15</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והזוהר הקדוש החמיר מאוד בעונש השומע ברכה ואינו עונה אמן לכן אם המברך על איזה דבר לעצמו רואה דהשומעין מזלזלים באמן ואין עונין, טוב שיברך בלחש כדי שלא ישמעו הברכה ויבואו לידי מכשול</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which can be roughly translated (by me) as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The holy Zohar indicates very severe punishment for one who hears a blessing and doesn't respond Amen. Therefore, if the blesser sees the listeners are lax in responding Amen, better he should bless quietly so they don't hear the blessing lest it become an obstacle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# what does it mean that God is infinite?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>have read in a few places such as in the book Shaarei Kedusha that God is \"infinite\" (Ein Sof) (without end). What does this mean? Typically we think of something infinite as being immeasurable or mathematically as the limit of a function as some variable increases indefinitely. The latter does not apply to God since He does not change (Rambam Yesodei Torah 1). What then does infinite mean in this context? (note that I am not asking about God's essence as that is forbidden to inquire about. Just asking what we can know (if anything) of what infinite means with regard to Him)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Since we are finite beings, then in this sense <em>infinite</em> means <em>immeasurable</em> or not understandable. Any attempt at description is a limit to something that has no limit. Your statement</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Typically we think of something infinite as being immeasurable or\n  mathematically as the limit of a function as some variable increases\n  indefinitely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is itself an attempt to describe the indescribeable. Thus we say that looking at a limited subset of characteristics that we ascribe to Hashem causes us to be at a point and move along. </p>\n\n<p><em>Ein Sof</em>, while it translates as <em>infinite</em> has more the connotation of unable to be expressed, as any expression implies some sort of limit or boundary.</p>\n\n<p>For example, an exponential function in mathematics may be <em>infinite</em>, but since it approaches a <em>limit without bound</em>, it is not <em>Ein Sof</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleph number</a> which are <em>infinite</em> values but are also not <em>Ein Sof</em> as the bounds can be explicitly expressed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I see two questions here: how is Hashem infinite and what does Ein Sof mean</p>\n\n<p>Infinite according to Google means:</p>\n\n<p>adjective</p>\n\n<p>limitless or endless in space, extent, or size; impossible to measure or calculate.\n\"the infinite mercy of God\"\nsynonyms:   boundless, unbounded, unlimited, limitless, never-ending, interminable;</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the terms referring to physicality don't apply, but the other ones are appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Lehavdil, Ein Sof as explained by Nefesh HaChaim Shaar Beis Chapter 2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה שבז''הק מכנהו ית' בשם אין סוף איננו כנוי עליו ית''ש אלא הכוונה על השגתנו אותו מצד כחות הנשפעים מאתו בהתחברותו ברצונו להעולמות. ולזאת כנוהו א''ס ולא אין ראשית. כי באמת מצד עצמותו ית''ש אין לו לא סוף ולא ראשית. רק מצד השגתינו כחותיו ית'. הלא כל השגתינו הוא רק ראשית. אבל אין סוף להגיע בהשגה להשיג את כחותיו ית' הנשפעים</p>\n  \n  <p>That which the Zohar calls Him Ein Sof (lit: without end), it's not that we're actually using it to give a description of Him. Rather the intention is based on our understanding of Him, based on the powers that have an affect from Him due to His desired connection to the universes. This why we refer to him as Ein Sof and not Ein Reishis (without beginning), because in truth, regarding His Essence, there's no end and no beginning. Only with regards to our comprehension of His powers, they have a beginning, yet they don't have an end. We'll never fully understand His influential powers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To us, Infinity means forever expanding. But that is because nothing that we relate to is actually infinite. Therefore when we use the term we are referring to the theoretical idea that we can keep on going. For example, when we say that numbers are infinite that doesn't mean that there is a <code>forever</code> number. It means that there is no foreseeable limit hindering us from continuing to count. Hence, <em>infinity</em> is more a function than a number. </p>\n\n<p>When we say that God is infinite that means that he is indeed forever great. If  we were to try to measure Him we would keep on going. </p>\n\n<p>This is comparable to the vastness and endlessness of the athiest`s Original Nothing. </p>\n\n\n",

I assume that this particular case is an instance where the squatter's access to the other houses is legal; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.20a.17?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an earlier comment by Rashi</a> refers specifically to borrowing and owning those other houses.</p>\n\n<p>What if the squatter does not have <em>legal</em> access to any houses, but has access to two houses (that are not generally rented out) <em>as a squatter</em>? His free access to House A is predicated on his free access to House B, which in turn is based on his free access to House A. Is this man able to use either house for free? Is there a problem if the reasoning allowing him to use these properties is circular in nature?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>He shouldn't have to pay.</strong></p>\n<p>You have to first understand what the gemara means in that the sqautter is not receiving benefit. Of course he's receiving benefit! He's living in a house! He's not out in the cold! Rather, the gemara means he's not gaining money; he's not the type of person who rents out houses. Rashi gives a logical explanation of why- he has other houses available to him for free. But the reason he doesn't have to pay isn't because he could've went to a different house, it's because he never would've paid for <em>this</em> house. So therefore, as long as he's the type of person who would not pay to rent a house whether on not he is able to squat elsewhere, he wouldn't have to pay.</p>\n\n\n",

(See <em>Me'am Lo'ez</em> Lev. 11:9-12; page 122 in the standard Hebrew edition, which quotes the story; see <em>Ba'ei Chayyei</em> YD 125 for the story as told by the <em>Knesset haGedola</em> himself.)</p>\n\n<p>While most modern <em>poskim</em> do not consider the Swordfish to be Kosher, that is a fairly recent development. Until the 1950's, most <em>poskim</em> did consider the Swordfish to be Kosher, as it does have scales when it is younger, which loosen and fall off as it ages. This topic has already been addressed at length <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16032/is-swordfish-kosher\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do we know that Ben Zoma went mentally insane?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Chagigah 14b it states that after entering pardes, Ben Zoma was injured. Rashi explains, and it is my understanding that this is the accepted reading, that Ben Zoma went crazy. </p>\n\n<p>However immediately following that story Ben Zoma is posed some halachic questions which he seems to answer correctly. </p>\n\n<p>Then there is a story about him describing the proximity of the upper and lower waters. I could not detect anything that indicated Ben Zoma was crazy. </p>\n\n<p>Are there statements by Ben Zoma elsewhere that would show he went mentally insane or is there some other source for this idea? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/chagigah/yosefdas/chag-yd-014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yosef Da'as on this section</a> has a fascinating approach.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that it was obvious to everybody that Ben Zoma had (somewhat) gone out of his mind (as per Rashi) from his super-spiritual experience. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gemara: בן זומא הציץ ונפגע - Ben Zoma peeked and was injured<br/>\n  Rashi: ונפגע. נטרפה דעתו - Injured: his mind was jumbled (lit.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rabbis then tried to determine why.</p>\n\n<p>It was clear to them it was a punishment for approaching the experience wrongly - the question was: where did he err?</p>\n\n<p>So first they checked to see if he was too lenient in spiritual matters. I.e. Would he assume a lowly creature like a dog was not worthy of respect. So they asked him if a dog can be castrated. His correct and respectful answer - quoting a verse - showed them that this was not the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Then they checked if he was too stringent - would he treat the Cohen Gadol with as more than a mere mortal. His correct approach to the second answer ruled out that problem.</p>\n\n<p>It was in the 3rd instance where he erred that they realized the problem - he didn't understand that there is a very thin line between good and bad. He was of the opinion that there was \"3 fingers of space\" between them.</p>\n\n<p>This error of not realizing that the physical and spiritual world are interconnected and have a direct influence on each other was the reason for his punishment.</p>\n\n<p><sup>This is roughly how I understand the Yosef Da'as. The original text is PDF, so I've attached a screen capture of it.</sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/82LXA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/82LXA.png\" alt=\"Yosef Daas Chagiga 41b\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While enjoying and learning from Danny Schoemann's answer, I'd like to offer another route to understanding the idea that Ben Zoma went insane.</p>\n\n<p>In describing the episode, the Talmud identifies the effect of Ben Zoma's experience in entering <em>pardes</em> with a particular biblical verse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בן זומא הציץ ונפגע ועליו הכתוב אומר (משלי כה, טז) דבש מצאת אכול דייך פן תשבענו והקאתו</p>\n  \n  <p>Ben Zoma glimpsed and was harmed. And with regard to him the verse states: “Have you found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you, lest you become full from it and vomit it” (Proverbs 25:16).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although this is the only information given on Ben Zoma's experience, it is instructive. Rambam, misattributing the verse to Elisha ben Avuya (Aher), elaborates on  the verse's allegory of sweet food to the nature of knowledge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Though great, excellent, noble and perfect, it is injurious if not kept within bounds or not guarded properly; it is like honey which gives nourishment and is pleasant, when eaten in moderation, but is totally thrown away when eaten immoderately. ... Let thy mind only attempt things which are within human perception; for the study of things which lie beyond man's comprehension is extremely injurious. (<em>Guide for the Perplexed</em>, ch. 32) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The verse thus gives us an image for one possible outcome after entering <em>pardes</em>, that of the mind expelling what it initially received. This is why Rashi notes that Ben Zoma <strong>נטרפה דעתו</strong> . Although often translated as \"lost his mind\" or \"went insane\" (and Danny Schoemann writes \"his mind was jumbled\"), the phrase can also be translated, \"his mind was <strong>devoured</strong>.\"  </p>\n\n<p>This understanding of Rashi would fit with Maimonides's explanation of the verse, suggesting that esoteric Torah can have an adverse effect: rather knowledge entering and filling the mind, it alternatively is responsible for the mind's harm; expelling from, or consuming, the mind. Both forms of violent food imagery suggest a person losing their knowledge, a state expectedly categorized in terms of insanity. </p>\n\n<p>On a final note, it should be noted that the question of Ben Zoma's state after the <em>pardes</em> experience is challenging, not only because of the ambiguous terminology surrounding the discussion, but also because there are alternate accounts of the very episode in rabbinic literature. The Talmud <em>Yerushalmi</em> (Hagiga 2:4), for example, notes that it was Ben Azzai who was injured and Ben Zoma who died following the episode. Likewise, it may be that Rambam's version of the Talmud had a slightly different account, thereby assigning the honey verse to Aher.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara there has Rebbe Yehoshua commenting, עדיין בן זומה מבחוץ, that Ben Zoma's conclusion of the separation being three finger widths and his derivation from the word Merachefes, shows that he is still not thinking straight.</p>\n\n<p>A side note: This wording, עדיין seems to show that he was recuperating. That would be the reason for the questions they asked him, to gauge his thinking or perhaps even to get him on track.</p>\n\n<p>It may also be that the Gemara is mentioning these questions to show his great learning.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.2.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Medrash Rabbah</a> has Rebbe Yehoshua exclaiming that Ben Zoma left already and within a few days he was Niftar. Perhaps this Medrash switches Ben Azai and Ben Zoma. But regardless, we see that this was a sign that something was very off.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Something that might put better context into this is to understand the three dangers of delving very deep. First danger is getting it wrong, and on this level that would be drastic. Second, someone can grasp more than is meant for him. And finally, there is the issue of being able to relate back to this world.</p>\n\n<p>Rebbe Akiva entered in peace and left in peace. This means that he grasped everything in a wholesome way and even left in peace, that he was able to relate to the basic level as well. When Rebbe Yehoshua saw that Ben Zoma said things that don't make sense to us he knew that he did not make it out safely; he could not bring out his thoughts in a way that would make sense in the basic level.</p>\n\n\n",

This is the opinion of Rashi but Rabenu Tam indeed thinks that the verse teaches us the order of tying.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanations:</strong></p>\n<p>This Rashi is very interesting, and even more than interesting after the learning of the Gemara in Yoma 33b, this resolve partially the kushia of Tosfot on Rashi there.</p>\n<p>See Gemara Yoma daf 33ab (and then Rashi, Tosfot, Ritba).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(33a) for Resh Lakish said: 'One must not forego the occasion of performing a religious command.</p>\n<p>(33b) Said Raba: From what Resh Lakish said we infer that it is <strong>forbidden to forego the arm in favour of the forehead</strong>. How shall he do it? From the arm [he shall] proceed to the forehead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi explains that the Gemara said the importance to tie first the hand-tefila, because you meet firstly the arm, and secondly the head with your working hand.</p>\n<p>Tosfot (the explanation is more comprehensive in Ritba) shows from the Gemara Menachot (36a) that from one verse we learn to ty first tefila of head and from another verse, to leave first tefila of head (totafot ben enecha when they are plural, that is head + arm), the tefila of head is present, i.e. there is no situation in which you have tefila of head only.</p>\n<p>Here is a quote of Gemara Menachot 36a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One taught: When a man puts on the tefillin, he should put on first the hand-tefillah and then the head-tefillah, and when he takes them off, he should take off first the head-tefillah and then the hand-tefillah Now it is right that when he puts them on he should put on first the one on the hand and then the one on the head, since it is written, And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and then it says, And they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes; but whence do we know that on taking them off he should first take off the one from the head and then the one from the hand? - Rabbah said, Rav Huna explained it to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet we can discuss the opinion of Rashi. Without deep explanation, we see that without the teaching of Resh lakish that Ein Maavirim al hamitsvot, despite the verse, we can believe to tie firstly the head-tefilin (because it is more Kadosh as soon in the answer of @Gershon Gold, or because you find it first in the bag). As you assume, the source of precession of the hand-tefilin according to Rashi is not in this verse. We can see in the Rashi on the verse an answer to the adtonishment of Tosfot. I wrote here a minimum of explanation, assuming that a comprehensive explanation of the Gemara and Tosfot Yome can be lenght.</p>\n<p>Just an additional statement.Gemara (RL in Yoma) makes a comparaison between 2 situations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The kohen Gadol passes first over the mizbeach happenimi, before the menora, because the mizbeach hapenimi is a little more in east side.</li>\n<li>the man who wear tefilin passes firstly over the arm, before the head</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rashi feels that this Gemara is a proof that the verse quoted in the OP is not an intrinsec proof that we have to wear hand-tefila before head-tefila.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Note. All this reasoning can be rejected. We can say that there is a positive point of view explained in Masechet Menachot,  to follow a specific order {1: hand, 2: head}.And there is a negative side, a prohibition to forego the hand in favour of the head.</em></p>\n\n\n",

There are a number of sources that\n  would indicate a preference for sitting during the recitation of\n  kiddush:</p>\n  \n  <p>A. Tosafot (Berachot 43a) states that in order to include others in\n  your recitation of kiddush it is necessary for everybody to sit, as an\n  indication that they are all joining together to discharge their\n  obligation through the kiddush of one of them. Tosafot even wonders\n  why we have the custom to stand for havdalah when we are motzi others.\n  They therefore suggest that it is best to sit for havdalah as well.\n  (Regarding sitting during havdalah see Rama 296:6, Biur Hagra ibid.,\n  and Ma’aseh Rav 103.)</p>\n  \n  <p>B. The gemara Pesachim 101a records the comment of Shmuel that one\n  must recite kiddush in the same place that he will have his meal. It\n  is clear in the gemara that this requirement does not only involve\n  reciting kiddush in the same house that one will have his meal, but\n  even in the same room where the meal will take place. The Mishnah\n  Berurah (271:46) cites poskim who suggest that one should also recite\n  kiddush in the exact spot that he will have his meal. As such, one who\n  will eat sitting down should recite kiddush while sitting down as\n  well.</p>\n  \n  <p>C. The gemara and rishonim do not openly discuss that issue of\n  standing versus sitting for kiddush. In all likelihood, there was only\n  one custom during those times in history, thereby obviating the need\n  for any debate about this matter. The question though remains, what\n  was the custom that everybody had accepted without any opposition\n  voiced against it. The Rambam (Hilchot Succah 6:12) writes that on the\n  first night of Succot one should recite kiddush while standing,\n  because the beracha of leshev b’succah should be recited prior to\n  performing the mitzvah (of sitting in the succah). The Ra’avad\n  comments that he had never heard of such a custom. Additionally, he\n  argues, even if the berachah is recited while seated, it will still\n  precede the primary aspect of the mitzvah of succah, the eating in the\n  succah. Magid Mishnah adds that the words “leshev b’succah” do not\n  reflect an obligation to sit in the succah. Rather, it reflects an\n  obligation to dwell in the succah. After all, one who spends his\n  entire day in the succah, eating and drinking standing up has\n  certainly fulfilled his obligation of yeshivat succah. Based on this\n  discussion, it seems that all of these rshonim took for granted that\n  normally kiddush was recited while sitting down. The only debate\n  revolved around the first night of Succot because of factors that are\n  unique to that holiday.</p>\n  \n  <p>V. Conclusion. We have outlined the various considerations to be taken\n  into account when deciding whether to sit or stand for kiddush. As a\n  practical matter, most Chassidic poskim have followed the custom of\n  the Arizal to stand, and the Rama sanctions this custom. However, some\n  later poskim have pointed out that this ruling should not apply to Yom\n  Tov or daytime kiddush where it is preferable to sit. Rav Hershel\n  Schachter shlit”a once told me that even one who plans to change his\n  family custom in favor of a custom that he believes to be more\n  halachically viable, he should maintain the old custom when reciting\n  kiddush in front of his parents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

E.g. if their shape is now altered they need to be erased and rewritten.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm wondering about your definition of Hiddur is: Isn't it more Mehudar to have a tiny erasure at the point of contact, as opposed to erasing 2 letters and writing on less-than-perfect parchment which tends to be \"messy\".</p>\n\n\n",

See תלמוד בבלי - בבא קמא-דף ט - ב </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא אמר ר' זירא בהידור מצוה עד שליש במצוה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>The more the merrier</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having lots of people participate in a Mitzvah is Hiddur Mitzva - how many Cohanim should be added to the choir? Up to 120. See תלמוד בבלי - ערכין - תוספות-דף יג - א </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד כמה יהא הידור מצוה וא''צ לחפש יותר אחר כהנים אמר רב הונא עד ק''כ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Cleaner is better</strong></p>\n\n<p>Even though a Brit Mila exposed the diaper area by definition, it should nevertheless be cleaned beforehand because of Hiddur Mitzva. See ערוך השולחן - אורח חיים-סימן פא - דין צואת קטן</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וודאי הידור מצוה היא שיהיה נקי ויפה. ולא גרע מהידור מצוה בכל המצות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Finding chametz in the middle of Pesach if you sold your chametz",
    "content": "# Finding chametz in the middle of Pesach if you sold your chametz\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone founds chametz in their house during Pesach the Shulchan Aruch writes that if it's Chol HaMoed one must go out and burn it immediately and if it's Yom Tov ne should put a cli over it and then after Yom Tov burn it (See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim Siman 446 Sif 1.) However how does this din apply nowadays in a case where a person \"sold\" their chametz to a goy before Pesach. While generally they sell all the chametz that is in a particular location, however many also write \"b'col makom shehu\" (in any place that chametz is found.) If a person would find a cookie or piece cake or a slice of bread in a random place in their house, what should be done with it? Does it \"belong\" to the goy and therefore should be set aside for them? Or should it be burned like it says in Shulchan Aruch? </p>\n\n<p>(I have hard time imagining the goy caring about a dry piece of bread, but if the sell is supposed to be real then maybe it really does belong to him.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Mikra’ei Kodesh, ((Laws of)Pesach 1:74) writes that nowadays when people sell all of their chametz (your contract says \"and all Chametz wherever it may be found\") it is prohibited to take the forgotten chametz to burn it. The reason is (besides the fact that stealing from the Gentile is prohibited) that if one were to physically take the Chametz to burn it he would actively violate the prohibition against owning Chametz, because he becomes a thief (he stole the Gentile's Chametz!)and is responsible to return the Chametz to the gentile who purchased it (see Magen Avraham 586:5, who states that one who steals Chametz from a gentile is responsible for it and it is considered his Chametz by virtue of that responsibility). Although his intent is not to steal in order to assume ownership, nevertheless, even taking another’s possession with the intent to destroy it is categorized as theft (Baba Kamma 98a).</p>\n\n<p>Rav Wosner in Sh\"UT Shevet HaLevi 9:116 while acknowledging the above approach, offers that the Gentile doesn't really care if you burn one piece since his whole intention is to assist the Jew in his holiday observance. Therefore, picking up the Chametz to burn it would not be theft and one may do so. So, someone who doesn't try to sell pure Chametz Gomur, but did sell \"any Chametz\" in the sale contract, may still perform the stringency of not relying on the sale, and burning the small amount that he found. </p>\n\n<p>If it is not being burned, then it should be put into the Gentile's closet/zone so a Jew does not come to accidentally eat it.

It is telling you how long one must endure pain for, even until Sukos. And that in general <em>it is</em> recommended to push oneself in this endeavor. The Gemara in Nedarim (49) says a similar thing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמרה ההיא מטרוניתא לרבי יהודה מורה ורוי אמר לה הימנותא בידא דההיא איתתא אי טעימנא אלא קידושא ואבדלתא וארבעה כסי דפסחא וחוגרני צידעי מן הפסח עד העצרת אלא (קהלת ח, א) חכמת אדם תאיר פניו</p>\n<p>The Gemara cites related incidents: A certain gentile lady [matronita] said to Rabbi Yehuda, whose face was ruddy: How can one teach the Jews and be a drunk at the same time? He said to her: I place my integrity in the hands of this woman and should no longer be deemed credible if I ever taste any wine except for that of kiddush, havdala, and the four cups of Passover. <strong>And after I drink those four cups I tie my temples from Passover to Shavuot, as wine gives me a headache.</strong> Rather, my complexion is explained by the verse “A man’s wisdom makes his face to shine” (Ecclesiastes 8:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Beis Yosef stresses this point that one must indeed push himself, and uses your example as a threshold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.472.15.1?vhe=Tur_Orach_Chaim,_Vilna,_1923&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Beis Yosef, 472.15:</strong></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וצריך כל אדם לשתות ד' כוסות על הסדר שנפרש וכו' שם במשנה כתב הרשב\"א שאלת מי שאינו שותה יין כל השנה כולה מפני שמזיקו או שונאו מהו שיעשה כל הסדר על הפת תשובה מסתברא שכל שיש לו יין צריך לדחוק עצמו ולעשות כר\"י ב\"ר אלעאי דלא הוה שתי חמרא ושתי ד' כוסות ואמר חוגרני צידעי מפסחא ועד עצרת וכר' יונה דגרסינן בירושלמי ר' יונה שתי ד' כסי בלילא דפסחא ומזיק ראשיה עד עצרתא והא דר\"י בר אלעאי איתא בנדרים (מט:):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hilchos Chag B'Chag (p. 420) mentions that if one will seriously fall ill he may be excused, for this is not the way of freedom.

The Kohen uncovers a Sotah's hair (Bamidbar 5:18). We see from here that a Kohen may uncover a woman in places she normally covers for the sake of the ritual. </p>\n\n<p>Second. The Gemara (AZ 20b) discusses the prohibition to gaze at a woman's clothing, as it may lead to improper thoughts. Among the various conditions mentioned is that it has to be old clothing, as if new clothing is prohibited, a tailor would be put out of business, unable to alter women's clothing. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara challenges this based on the fact that he's preoccupied with his job; he won't think about the woman. The Gemara brings a proof from a breeder; although the same Braisa says that one may not watch animals mating, one may breed them. How is that possible, without watching them mate? Rather, the Gemara concludes, one who is busy with his job won't think improper thoughts. So, too, perhaps new clothing should be prohibited ordinarily, but a tailor gets an exemption. </p>\n\n<p>Based on this logic of the Gemara, perhaps we may also say that a Kohen who checks a woman for tzara'as is allowed to examine her uncovered, as he is preoccupied with his job.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1524516/jewish/Tumat-Tsaraat-Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1524516/jewish/Tumat-Tsaraat-Chapter-9.htm</a> </p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, Tum'at Tsara`at - Chapter 9:1 </p>\n\n<p>Anyone may inspect a potential Tsaraat blemish (except the afflicted individual themselves).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, a trained woman who knows the Halachos could check the afflicted woman and rule out most questions. </p>\n\n<p>However, if the afflicted woman does eventually need the direct eye of the Cohen, then according to the Rambam 9:12, a woman sits in a certain position (as if nursing a child) while naked. The Cohen then views the blemish and issues a ruling. This sitting position excludes extreme folds of the skin and many private parts from inspection (a man also does not need to be inspected in folds of skin and certain private areas). The Torah requires the eyes of the Cohen to naturally see the area of a naked individual that is usually visible. (For instance, the bottom underside of the foot is exempt.) However, most of the flesh does need to be examined (for instance, breast area does, if that is the afflicted spot).</p>\n\n<p>It seems that at the end of the day, the Cohen just needs to rely upon professional conduct similar to an OBGYN physician.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Psalm 37's 1st verse in the Dead Sea Scroll named 11QPsd start with Aleph?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My question is whether Psalm 37's 1st verse in the Dead Sea Scroll known as 11QPsd starts with the letter \"Aleph,\" because it is supposed to be an alphabetical acrostic poem. The reason why I'm asking is because it appears to skip Aleph & starts with \"Bet\" in the 2nd verse.</p>\n\n<p>I'm currently looking into the claim that the Masoretic Text is missing a verse in Ashrei (Psalm 145) that is supposed to start with \"Nun,\" because it is argued that Ashrei is an alphabetical acrostic poem. There is a Dead Sea Scroll named 11QPsa that contains the supposed Nun verse, which has caused many to argue that the Masoretic Text should be \"corrected,\" but I'm uncertain that the acrostic was ever intended to be fully intact.</p>\n\n<p>I am aware of ancient writings that aim to explain the missing verse, such as the passage in <a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_4.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot 4b of the Babylonian Talmud</a>, but my approach looks at Psalm 37, because it is claimed to be another alphabetical acrostic poem. Psalm 37's acrostic happens to start at the second verse, and it happens to skip the letter \"Aleph.\"</p>\n\n<p>I've looked it up in a book known as the Dead Sea Scrolls Bible, which lists the verse on a Dead Sea Scroll named 11QPsd. It also mentions that the beginning of the Psalm is there, and that it is connected to the first verse as well as the second verse. The english translation of Psalm 37 in the Dead Sea Scrolls Bible is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>\"Of David. <strong>Do not</strong> [missing text, so it is replaced with assumed text... wrongd]oers.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm interested in is whether the text translated as \"Do not\" might have to do with an Aleph? Because if there is no Aleph in that Dead Sea Scroll, it could mean that acrostics don't always have to include all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm facing is that I am a novice when it comes to Hebrew, so I can't pinpoint Psalm 37 on <a href=\"http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/11Q8-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the following website</a>, and neither can I figure out if the Aleph is there or not.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It appears so, and so does the Masoretic text.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2637.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalm 37 Masoretic text</a> (from Mechon Mamre):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א  לְדָוִד:  אַל-תִּתְחַר בַּמְּרֵעִים;    אַל-תְּקַנֵּא, בְּעֹשֵׂי עַוְלָה. 1 [A Psalm] of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.<br>\n  ב  כִּי כֶחָצִיר, מְהֵרָה יִמָּלוּ;    וּכְיֶרֶק דֶּשֶׁא, יִבּוֹלוּן. 2 For they shall soon wither like the grass, and fade as the green herb.<br>\n  ג  בְּטַח בַּיהוָה, וַעֲשֵׂה-טוֹב;    שְׁכָן-אֶרֶץ, וּרְעֵה אֱמוּנָה. 3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land, and cherish faithfulness.<br>\n  ד  וְהִתְעַנַּג עַל-יְהוָה;    וְיִתֶּן-לְךָ, מִשְׁאֲלֹת לִבֶּךָ. 4 So shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and He shall give thee the petitions of thy heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, the first verse starts \"לְדָוִד:  אַל-תִּתְחַר\" ([A Psalm] of David. Fret not...) The word \"Do not\" is אל, which clearly starts with an aleph.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/image/B-365404\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Plate 621B, fragment 6</a> seems to be the piece of this Psalm. Due to the site's terms of service, i won't include the image here, but you can see it starts <strong>לדוד א</strong>, so presumably it follows the Masoretic text.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, the psalm does appear to be missing a verse for 'ayin.</p>\n\n\n",

It is obvious from reading the Written Torah alone, that it is too abbreviated and/or broad, to apply as rulings to individual legal cases by itself. However it is the firm basis and source of all Jewish Law.</p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<p>The Torah says we must eat matzah (unleavened bread) on Passover. How much Matzah? We must not boil the Passover offering's meat in water. May we boil it in its own juices?</p>\n\n<p>The Torah simply says we must \"sanctify a priest (Kohen).\" Does that mean we should give him the first aliyah on every Sabbath Torah reading? What if the synagogue needs money? May we auction off all aliyahs even to a Levi or Yisroel?</p>\n\n<p>The Torah says we must put \"judges in our gates\". How many judges are needed in each gate to fulfill this? What's a gate? Does a judge get a salary from the town?</p>\n\n<p>The Torah says we must not cheat each other. How much money is considered overcharging for a certain product?</p>\n\n<p>The Torah requires witnesses for certain crimes and financial cases. What if a witness says: \"I am not sure.\" or \"I am almost certain.\" What if witnesses testify together to the same crime but one says he was wearing black and the other says he was wearing green? </p>\n\n<p>The Torah says a thief pays double. What if the thief admitted to the crime and returned the goods? Does he still pay double?</p>\n\n<p>If a man borrowed money with witnesses, but he now claims he paid the debt back without witnesses, is he believed against the lender who claims he never paid?</p>\n\n<p>If two men came to court and each one claimed to be the father of a certain child, would you bring a sword like King Solomon did, or could you order a paternity test? Would another method be appropriate?</p>\n\n<p>So a Rabbi who is paskening out of a Tanach by itself is flying blind. :)</p>\n\n\n",

She said that it was a Very Good Question, but did not know. She too, works until it \"looks right.\"  </p>\n\n<p>She's going to look into it, but I figure I'd ask here too: Halachically speaking, is there a minimum size for kippot? If so, what is it? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The first responsum in R' Moshe Feinstein's <em>Igrot Moshe</em> (vol. 1, OC 1:8) states that a kippah should cover the majority of one's head, although this is a <em>chumrah</em> [stringency] rather than an absolute requirement.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, however, there is no minimum size. Some Israelis (Religious Zionists) wear very small, flat crocheted kippot, whereas others, such as members of the Chareidi community, as well as Conservative and Reform Jews wear larger kippot (the style differs)</p>\n\n<p>I'll also link <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/48198/kippah-yarmulke-size\">my question</a> on the matter, in case it answers yours.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Ha-Gaon Ha-Rav Ovadia Hadayah, the Kippah has to be visible from all sides (Shut Yaskil Avdi vol. 6, p. 292). Otherwise, it’s not called a covering. Likewise, Ha-Gaon Ha-Rav Ovadiah Yosef said, “It should be recognizable and visible from all sides of the head, front and back” (Shut Yehaveh Da’at 4:1).</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein in Sh\"ut Igrot Moshe, Orach Chaim 1:8 says that it is best to take the strict approach and to cover most of one’s head, but legally, it suffices as long as it is big enough to be called a <em>covering</em> and not a <em>decoration</em>.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Igros Moshe, a person can put his hand on his friend’s head, and the friend can recite blessings. Thus, a kippa the size of a hand would be sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>As a practical matter, I have read of someone who was told by his grandfather,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the two corners of a yarmulke when folded into quarters should extend\n  from the knuckle of the forefinger to the knuckle of the baby finger\n  when making a fist.

I just recently met someone who is on this same journey as me, and we have connected in our love for learning. </p>\n\n<p>From my experience, intense learning comes with it the development of a deep connection with your chavrusa.  Is there a Yichud issue with a male learning with a female, provided that it takes place in a publicly open space? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Torah laws of Yichud generally prohibit a man and woman; besides one's wife or mother, (or perhaps even a man and two women) from secluding themselves together in a place that is for all purposes considered \"behind closed doors where no one can see or have access\". The laws of Yichud are detailed and this answer does not serve to go into them in any depth, as that is not the OP's question. (You should consult your Rabbi if you have a specific situation.)</p>\n\n<p>A general rule is however, that a \"publicly open space\" should in general be the exact opposite setting of \"alone behind closed doors\". Then it shouldn't be a problem of Yichud law.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you define \"open public space\" as a deserted strip of public highway at 2AM, then Yichud may have an issue with that despite the road's public and open nature.</p>\n\n<p>Let's just say that if you are learning Torah with a woman at the Barnes and Nobles coffee table during business hours, you are probably not going to violate Yichud. :)</p>\n\n<p>However, if the woman is married to another man , then such an arrangement would be seriously frowned upon if not forbidden depending on the circumstance, regardless of Yichud.</p>\n\n<p>If she is a single Jewish lady, then there really is no problem. The only thing is that while I am sure the woman will be studying the Torah in all sincerity, the man may just be studying the woman. :) (OK, she might be distracted too if the guy is really nice.)</p>\n\n<p>This would just make the study session filled with distraction. So a man should definitely have enough \"non-girl\" learning hours so he can concentrate and retain the Torah lessons he so very much wants to learn.</p>\n\n<p>However, it may be that the man in question is quite used to dealing with female co-workers and clients etc. all day. In addition, he may want to get to know this woman who has so much in common (same spiritual journey) to see if they have the basis for a Kosher romantic relationship which could lead to marriage?</p>\n\n<p>Although politics and religion are usually bad topics to bring up on a date, maybe in this case it will help two people to discover each other? If so..Mazal Tov. :)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why don't we pray P'sukei D'Zimra before Mincha or Maariv?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>EDITED for clarity/Specificity. </p>\n\n<p>It is my understanding that the halakhic basis for p'sukei d'zimra is primarily from the following sources: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Shabbat 118b in which Rabbi Yosei says \"let my portion be among those who recite hallel everyday\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The Mishna in Berakhot 5:1 (also quoted in Berakhot 32b) \"The Chasidim Rishonim would tarry one hour and then pray\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Berakhot 32a \"One should always order praise of HKBH and the pray\" </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Given that numbers 2 and 3 suggest that one must praise before any t'filah or amidah, why is there no p'sukei d'zimra for Mincha and Maariv? Does the Ashrei at the beginning of mincha serve this purpose? (since ashrei is the halakhic heart of P'sukei D'Zimrah).  If this is so, why is there no ashrei at maariv then? </p>\n\n<p>I'm mostly interested in being pointed to sources that might address this question either directly or indirectly. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This will be a partial answer to your insightful question.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/Introduction_to_Pseukei_D_Zimra.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> cites Talmud Brachot 32b that lists the general reason for Psukei Dezimra. In short, it states that one must prepare himself by reciting the praises of G-d prior to making requests from him. While not explained in this article, this concept would explain the reason for the 1st 3 brachot in our Amidah, which focus on G-d's praises, and not our requests from him.</p>\n\n<p>A view beginning at about the middle of page 6 of the article reveals the Ba'al Hatnya's reading which explains that the term <em>tefillah</em> when used in the Talmud generally means the <em>Amidah</em>. However, <em>Ba'al Hatnay</em> states that here, it refers to <em>Kri'at SHema</em>, since the Shema is a mitzvah from the Torah and, according to most opinions, <em>Amidah</em> is Rabbinical. Thus. he says that in order to say the AMidah, one must reach a personal \"high point\", which is the result of reciting Shema. Yet, one must work his way up to that personal his level by first reciting <em>Psukei Dezimra</em> before Shema to reach that high point gradually.</p>\n\n<p>Well, this would explain why we don't have Psukei Dezimra at mincha as there is no Shema. OTOH, as stated in comments, the recital of <em>Ashrei</em> may be sufficient to accomplish that same \"high point\" that's mentioned. See the article and the Talmud about the reason for reciting Ashrei in mincha.</p>\n\n<p>Shema is in Ma'ariv, and based on the Baa'al Hatnya's answer, it seems that one should require Psukei Dezimra for Ma'ariv as well. I have to research this a bit more, if I can find something. Offhand, I'm surmising that since there is an opinion that Ma'ariv is <em>Reshut</em> (\"optional\"), it may not require the same \"build up\". Or, perhaps the various <em>Birkot Shema</em> themselves accomplish the job.</p>\n\n\n",

Before the war of Gog and Magog, a prophet will arise to inspire Israel to be upright and prepare their hearts, as Malachi 3:22 states: 'Behold, I am sending you Elijah.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As outlined in 12:3 The determination of lineage.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בימי המלך המשיח כשתתיישב ממלכתו ויתקבצו אליו כל ישראל יתייחסו כולם על פיו ברוח הקודש שתנוח עליו שנאמר וישב מצרף ומטהר וגו' ובני לוי מטהר תחילה ואומר זה מיוחס כהן וזה מיוחס לוי ודוחה את שאינן מיוחסין לישראל הרי הוא אומר ויאמר התרשתא להם וגו' עד עמוד כהן לאורים ולתומים הנה למדת שברוח הקודש מייחסין המוחזקין ומודיעין המיוחס ואינו מייחס ישראל אלא לשבטיהם שמודיע שזה משבט פלוני וזה משבט פלוני אבל אינו אומר על שהן בחזקת כשרות זה ממזר וזה עבד שהדין הוא שמשפחה שנטמעה נטמעה</p>\n  \n  <p>During the era of the Messianic king, once his kingdom has been established and all of Israel has gathered around him, the entire nation's line of descent will be established on the basis of his words and the prophetic spirit which will rest upon him, as Malachi 3:3 states: 'He shall sit as a refiner and purifier.'</p>\n  \n  <p>He will purify the lineage of the Levites first, stating 'He is a priest of defined lineage. He is a Levite of defined lineage.' Those whose lineage he will not recognize will be lowered to the status of Israelites. This is implied by Ezra 2:63: 'The governor said to them: 'They should not eat of the most holy things until a priest arises who will wear the urim vitumim.' From this verse, you can infer that the prophetic spirit will be used to define and notify the pedigree of lineage.</p>\n  \n  <p>When he defines the lineage of the Israelites, he will make known their tribal lineage alone, stating: 'He is from this tribe and he is from another tribe.' He will not, by contrast, state concerning a person who is presumed to be of unblemished lineage: 'He is illegitimate or he is of slave lineage.'

We will offer sacrifices, observe the Sabbatical and Jubilee years according to all their particulars as described by the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>11:4 The general orders seems to be most clear from here. Bring all the Jews back to observance, war, build Bayis Shlishi (third temple) and bring all Jews to Eretz Hakedosha (the Holy land).

There is a restriction  on touching between the sexes, regardless of faith, where the touching might lead to inappropriate behavior.  Different religious communities are strict to different degrees regarding this restriction, with some avoiding particularly affectionate touching, such as hugging or kissing, and others avoiding e.g. even formal handshakes.  In non-emergency situations, it is perhaps best to find out from the patient and/or his family what his comfort level is.

(The kind of thing you'd find in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=MY4xtbRlxWIC&dq=jewish%20tznius%20crown%20glory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Falk's book</a>, a book <a href=\"https://traditiononline.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Henkin-QX.1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sharply critiqued</a> by Rabbi Y.H. Henkin.) The traditional halachic sources only address whether a man can pray in the presence of a woman's uncovered body parts; it's a lot harder to dictate exactly what's called \"draws too much attention.\"</p>\n<p>Could an incredibly long train-of-a-hat be considered a \"burden\" and not \"clothing\" and would therefore be prohibited to wear outside an <em>eruv</em> on shabbos? Hm ... maybe ...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The concept of Tzniut has two parts to it. One is Halachic based, and one is cultural/behavioral based. Many focus so much on the first one that they forget about the 2nd one, which is the most important one. See Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 75) that clearly defines the laws of parts of the body that should covered during the recital of the Shema as \"Bemakom shedarka lechasoto\" which can be translated \"wherever she usually covers\". That's a very broad specification of what must be covered! \nMost of the topics os tzniut are cultural based. Halacha never discusses if a slit in a skirt if fine or not for example. Poskim will discuss these issues based on what they perceive as being modest or not. So it can vary from place to place. The mentalities are very different between the US and Israel for example. Fav E. Falk prohibits the red color garment for example, but Rav Yaakov Kamenetzky z\"l allows it because now even refine women use it. \nSo it really depends on the place where one lives, and the attitude of the person wearing it, like most Halachot of Tzniut. </p>\n\n\n",

The first large source to deal with this issue came from the Maharashdam (Rav Shmuel deMedina of the 16th Century), a large Turkish posek who was quoted by Sepharadim and Ashkenazim after him. The issue was that after the expulsion of Spanish Jews from Spain, the indigenous Turkish Jews found themselves outnumbered by the Sepharadim. Now most of the Synagogues were using the text of Minhag Sepharadi, and the Turkish Jews wanted to know if they had to use the Sepharadi Minhag of prayers (the new community standard), or if they could/should continue to use the original prayers of Minhag Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharashdam ruled as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בטורקיה נתקבל נוסח הספרדים. וקמו מערערים לומר שרוצים להתפלל כסדר\n  מנהג אבותיהם.\n   ז\"ל שו\"ת מהרשד\"ם (אורח חיים סימן לה), לא מצאנו ולא ראינו שאין לשנות\n  מנהג אבותינו כי אם בדבר שיש בו נידנוד איסור.\n   בכי-האי-גוונא דליכא צד איסור כלל ועיקר, ולא הרחקת עבירה -- בהא פשיטא\n  דלא שייך ביה משום \"אל תטוש תורת אמך\".\n   וכן יש לדקדק מלשון הר\"ן שכתב (פסחים פרק ד ד\"ה ונמצינו = דף יז ע\"ב בדפי\n  הרי\"ף): נמצינו למדים בתורת המנהגות שכל מנהג איסור שהוא מעיר אחת -- כל שאינו\n  מנהג בטעות אלא שהם החמירו על עצמן לעשות סייג לתורה או לדבר שהוא מחלוקת\n  בין חכמי ישראל ונהגו כדברי האוסר כל בני העיר, חייבין בו מן הדין, ואפילו בצינעא, עד\n  שיעקור דירתו משם ויקבענה בעיר אחרת, עכ\"ל הר\"ן.\n   ומדאמר הר\"ן שכל מנהג איסור וכו', ולא קאמר שכל מנהג סתם, משמע דלא\n  אמרינן הכי אלא בדבר איסור שנהגו במקומו הוא דאין לשנות. הא במידי דליכא צד\n  איסור כלל -- פשיטא שאין קפידא כלל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Summary: We have not found and we have not seen any example to block the change of your ancestral minhag. except, in minhagim which have a minud (a little bit of) prohibition in them. And he states this is not his new idea, but rather it was taught by the Ran.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the only obligatory minhagim are those that have prohibitions involved in them. In practical terms, this means that refraining from rice during Pesach would be a binding minhag that cannot be changed because you are prohibiting yourself of something. As further clarified by [Rabbi Dovid Fink][1], a noted posek in Jerusalem: The nusach of your prayers, or the method of wrapping your tefillin, etc, have no aspects of prohibition, and therefore you can change them as you please. In this case of the Turkish Jews, they were allowed to pray in Nusach Sepharad, or Nusach Turkey, whichever they wanted, whenever they wanted.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is a Kohen Allowed to Receive an Organ Donation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A Kohen is forbidden from becoming <em>Tamei Meis</em> (coming in contact with a dead body) (Vayikra-21)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aside from being allowed for <em>Pikuach Nefesh</em> reasons</strong> (life threatening situation). What other reasons can be found to allow a Kohen to receive an organ donation from a deceased person?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Quoted from the book <a href=\"http://mosaicapress.com/healing-in-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Healing in Halacha By Rabbi Micha Cohn</a> (page. 245-247 Mosaica Press 2016)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Iggros Moshe Yoreh Deah 1:230), wrote on the\n  opinions of a contemporary Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac Leibes, who wrote a\n  Kuntres called Rofe Kol Bassar where he asks this very question. </p>\n  \n  <p>One of the issues that Rabbi Leibes and Rabbi Feinstein discussed was\n  our question about the permissibility of a Kohen to receive an organ\n  transplant. Rabbi Leibes pointed out that if the size of the tissue\n  being transplanted is more than an olive, it could give off tumah\n  ritual impurity, and a Kohen would be prohibited from coming in\n  contact with it even in today's times. Rabbi Leibes offered a number\n  of possible arguments to permit a Kohen to accept a transplant, such\n  as relying on less mainstream opinions that maintain that there is not\n  a Torah prohibition for a Kohen to defile himself in contemporary\n  times when he is already ritually impure, as well as the opinion of\n  the Maharashdam that questions the reliability of a Kohen's tradition\n  on his lineage. Rabbi Feinstein did not view these reasons as being\n  substantial, and offered a perspective of his own </p>\n  \n  <p>Firstly, Rabbi Feinstein pointed out that if the tissue will be put\n  inside the body, there is a concept of tumah balu'ah that ritual\n  impurity is not transferred from inside the body. The commentary of\n  Rabbeinu Shimshon explains that since it is inside the body, it loses\n  its own significance and is considered a part of the body. Based on\n  this idea, if the tissue is transplanted Based on will beneath the\n  skin, the patient not become tamei since it is not in contact with\n  external part of the the recipient's body. This would be a significant\n  argument to permit a Kohen to receive a transplant since most\n  transplanted organs ar visible externally. </p>\n  \n  <p>Furthermore, the Rambam writes that although human skin from a\n  deceased person is ritually impure, if it is chemically treated it\n  lose its tumah. The reason seems to be because when an item takes on a\n  new form, it loses its previous status. Based on this concept, Rabbi\n  Feinstein understands that if tissue from the deceased takes on a new\n  role, like being used in a transplant, it removes the tumah status\n  from it. <strong>As such, a Kohen would be allowed to a accept a transplant</strong>\n  (given certain provisions) even if it is not beneath the skin, the\n  very fact that it is now part of a living person gives it a new status\n  and removes the tumah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The shach in Yoreh Deah 157:1 questions whether the risk of losing a limb is reason enough to allow transgression of a <em>lo-taaseh</em>.\nHe concludes that it is permissible. [Shabbos or other kares may be an exception]</p>\n\n<p>[See also ריב”ש סי’ יו\"ד שפ”ז ובאו”ח סימן שכ”ח סי”ז. בפרי מגדים שם סי’ שכח במשב”ז , חוות יאיר סי’ קפג, שו”ת אבני נזר או”ח קלג, ובשו”ת אגרות משה יו”ד ב’ סי’ קעד ענף ד’.]</p>\n\n<p>Thus even if the organ still retained its tumah, the kohen would be permitted to receive the transplant, since this is not worse than saving an organ at risk.</p>\n\n\n",

With the support of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch and Rabbi Nathan Adler, he therefore declared it nonkosher. further details can be found in this article on the subject:\n<a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/ThreeBirds/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.kashrut.com/articles/ThreeBirds/</a></p>\n\n\n",

My question is, if a parent happens to have a serious mental health defect (such as say Alzheimer’s syndrome), is it permissible to put them in an institution like a nursing home? I don’t know if this constitutes a violation of the positive commandment of honoring mother and father, but I could see a strong case it is not if the officials at the nursing home are competent. What is the general rule regarding this</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Ask your LOR if this is relevant but the Shulchan Aruch Yore Deah 240:10 says that if one can not deal with their elderly parents due to serious mental health defects he should have others do so:</p>\n<p>מי שנטרפה דעת אביו או אמו משתדל לנהוג עמהם כפי דעתם עד שירוחם עליהם ואם אי אפשר לו לעמוד מפני שנשתנו ביותר ילך לו\nויניחם ויצוה לאחרים לנהגם כראוי</p>\n<p><em>If one's father or mother has become mentally lost , he should make an effort to behave toward them according to their state of mind, until they will be shown mercy.(heal)  But if it is impossible for him to stand  because they have become utterly insane, he may leave them and go, find others to take proper care of them.</em></p>\n<p>In todays times that would be either hiring aides for them or putting them in a nursing home</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Halachic aspects of relocating an established minyan\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any halachic implications of relocating an established minyan?</p>\n<p>Here is a specific example that might help clarify my question: Suppose there is a small community that normally has Shabbat mincha and maariv at their synagogue every week.  One week a member decides to invite the community to his home for seudah shlishit, and proposes that they can daven maariv there, at his home, after services.  Is this okay?  Does it matter whether this is a one-time event, or whether it becomes a regular thing?</p>\n<p>There are certainly practical considerations that would need to be taken into account: what if someone doesn't get the memo and shows up for maariv at the shul, only to discover that nobody's there?  Then there are the social dynamics: some people who might normally come to services at the synagogue might feel less comfortable going into a private home, especially if they do not know the hosts well, and might therefore decline to attend.</p>\n<p>I'm seeking insight into whether there are any <em>halachic</em> aspects of relocating a minyan from its usual public location into a private space.  I know, for example, that one is not supposed to transport a sefer torah from its regular location for single or temporary use elsewhere. Are there analogous concerns about relocating an entire minyan?</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I also know that it is not uncommon for a daily minyan to temporarily relocate to a home where shiva is being observed. But shiva is an exceptional circumstance, one where the needs of the mourners may temporarily take priority over other considerations.</p>\n<p>I'd appreciate any references to codes or commentators that discuss this (or related matters).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I like how you wrote up the question. It became quite relevant post-COVID when people had to decide whether to disband home/street <em>minyanim</em> and come back to synagogues.</p>\n<p>A person in this situation would need to consider the halachic preference for praying in a synagogue over a home, since a synagogue has a <em>din</em> of <em>mikdash meat</em>, a small sanctuary. The Mishna Brura writes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.90.9?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.90.27&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 90:27</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>להתפלל בבהכ\"נ - ואפילו אם יש לו עשרה בביתו ישתדל בבהכ\"נ ועיין בסי\"ח\nבמ\"ב ס\"ק נ\"ד:</p>\n<p>[A person should make an effort to pray in the synagogue with a\ncongregation] <strong>Even if there are 10 people in his house, he should\nendeavor to pray in the synagogue.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R Yitzchak Botton expands on some of the rationale and <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/this_week/insights_into_halacha/7170\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>It is better to pray with a minyan in shul than to pray with a minyan\nat home.</strong> If one has a choice to pray between two shuls, he should go\nto the one with more people. This is because there is greater honor\naccorded to G-d when there are more people present.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/02-03-01/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halacha</a> on the topic.</p>\n<p>Of course permanently relocating a minyan, where the whole community moves to e.g., a different synagogue, would have different rules. One should pay attention there to the issue of destroying a synagogue before the next one is built up (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.3b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 3b</a> and commentaries).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/138651/11501\">In my other answer</a>, I addressed the specific issue of an individual praying in a home minyan rather than in a synagogue. You asked in comments to clarify the <em>halacha</em> for an entire community that would decide to relocate itself to a private home (although it is not clear if they would do this permanently or temporarily).</p>\n<p><strong>This is rather problematic because of <em>Kedushas Beit HaKnesset</em></strong> - in the words of R Aryeh Lebowitz (in this <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2014/03/house-minyanim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">very relevant article</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The strongest argument against house minyanim is that they undermine\nthe value of a beis haknesses. Considering the halachos governing the\nusage, structure and honor of a beis haknesses, it seems that Chazal\nwere very interested in having Jews daven in a place that has kedushas\nbeis haknesses, the sanctity of a synagogue. Indeed, the Gemara\n(Brachos 6b) teaches that a person’s tefillos are only heard in a\nshul. [8] The Meiri (ibid.) explains that this is not only due to the\nkedushah of a shul, but also because it is easier to have proper\nkavanah when davening in a shul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>There are other issues</strong>, e.g., the <strong>lack of an <em>aron kodesh</em></strong> (ark) or Sefer Torah in most house minyanim, the fact it is <strong>more difficult to set a <em>makom kavua</em></strong> (a fixed seat) in a house minyan, the <strong>possible greater difficult in concentrating</strong>, the fact some <strong>people might be more hesitant</strong> to join a minyan in a private home where they don't know the owner (or maybe are not on friendly terms with him). See <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2014/03/house-minyanim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">detailed sources</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>All these constraints are sometimes lifted in case of great need</strong>, e.g., forming a minyan around a great person who can't walk anymore or enabling people who wouldn't otherwise go to synagogue to have a minyan.</p>\n<p>All these factors should be weighed by a rabbi who can help the community make the right decision.</p>\n<p>For further reference see also <a href=\"https://halacha2go.com/?number=707\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was Yoseph sold to Ishmaelites and then Midianites, rather than Midianites and then Ishmaelites?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The following question and translations are courtesy of <strong>Studies in Bereshit</strong> by Nechama Leibowitz.</p>\n<p>In Parshat Vayeshev, some pesukim suggest that Yoseph was sold by his brothers to Midianites, and others to Ishmaelites. The Ishmaelites are mentioned first (\"Behold, a caravan of <strong>Ishmaelites</strong>...\") followed by \"And there passed by <strong>Midianites</strong>, merchants; and they lifted up Yoseph out of the pit and sold Yoseph to the <strong>Ishmaelites</strong>). This is followed by a third group known as Medanites (which Rashi suggests is simply an abbreviated form of Midianites) selling Yoseph to Mitzrayim, and ultimately concludes with the Ishmaelites selling Yoseph to Potiphar.</p>\n<p>Rashi suggests that Yoseph was first sold by his brothers to the Ishmaelites. The Ishmaelites then sold Yoseph to Midianites AKA Medanites, who eventually sold Yoseph to Potiphar in Mitzrayim. Thus, when it says the brothers sold Yoseph to the Medianites or that the Ishmaelites sold Yoseph to Mitzrayim, the Torah is speaking of indirect action/figuratively.</p>\n<p>This is all well and good, but <strong>Studies in Bereshit</strong> proposes the following question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following objections have been raised to Rashi's interpretation: What forced Rashi to explain that the brothers sold him to the Ishmaelites and the latter to the Midianites and not that the brothers sold him to the Midianites and the latter to the Ishmaelites, which would fit the text better? Explain which texts this explanation would suit better and why Rashi, in spite of this, preferred his explanation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Try as I might, I was not able to come to any conclusions with this question - or, indeed, any manner in which the order would be significant at all! Mayhaps there is some connection between the tribes and Ishmael that is significant here, but I am not sure what it would be. I agree that the text is smoother if the order was brothers -> Midianites -> Ishmaelites -> Potiphar, as it refers to selling Yoseph right after the Midianites pass by, and says that Potiphar bought Yoseph \"from the hand of the Ishmaelites\" which suggests that there was direct interaction between Potiphar and the Ishmaelites. However, I can think of no reason why Rashi would forego this in favor of the order he proposes. Why does Rashi prefer the order he gives (brothers -> Ishmaelites -> Midianites -> Potiphar), rather than the one his objectors give (brothers -> Midianites -> Ishmaelites -> Potiphar)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Doesn't  the posuk itself give the order of brothers -> Ishmaelites -> Midianites -> Potiphar and not brothers -> Midianites -> Ishmaelites -> Potiphar ?</p>\n<p>Breishis 37:27-28 says\nלְכ֞וּ וְנִמְכְּרֶ֣נּוּ לַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִ֗ים וְיָדֵ֨נוּ֙ אַל־תְּהִי־ב֔וֹ\nכִּֽי־אָחִ֥ינוּ בְשָׂרֵ֖נוּ ה֑וּא וַיִּשְׁמְע֖וּ אֶחָֽיו\nוַיַּֽעַבְרוּ֩ אֲנָשִׁ֨ים מִדְיָנִ֜ים סֹֽחֲרִ֗ים וַיִּמְשְׁכוּ֙ וַיַּֽעֲל֤וּ\nאֶת־יוֹסֵף֙ מִן־הַבּ֔וֹר וַיִּמְכְּר֧וּ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֛ף לַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִ֖ים</p>\n<p><em>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and  our hand shall not be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh.\" And his brothers listened.

The Sifsie Chachomim adds  that had it been the Midianites who pulled Yosef out of the Bor then the brothers would not have been the ones who sold Yosef. But they had to have some connection to the sale or  the Posuk would not have mentioned their passing by at the time.(The amount of their involvement in the original and final sale of Yosef is a question discussed in the Rishonim)</p>\n<p>A few pesukim later says that it was the Midianites not the Ishmaelites who sold him to Potiphar.</p>\n<p>Breishis 37:36 וְהַ֨מְּדָנִ֔ים מָֽכְר֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ אֶל־מִצְרָ֑יִם לְפֽוֹטִיפַר֙ סְרִ֣יס</p>\n<p><em>And the Midianites sold him to Egypt, to Potiphar, Pharaoh's chamberlain</em></p>\n<p>The posuk explicitly says he was bought from the Midianites.</p>\n\n\n",

Since the Sanhedrin was dismantled, the next best option was to listening to the hachamim of your locale. There were two main locales: Eretz Yisrael and Bavel. The hachamim in Eretz Yisrael had semikha and the ones in Bavel didn't, but they continued to transmit the oral tradition as they were located in one place. Neither center had jurisdiction over the other.</p>\n<p>Historically speaking, the Bavli school survived way past the school of Eretz Yisrael and thus all of its disciples (geonim, rishonim) were educated in the Bavli methodology. They obviously knew the Yerushalmi (at least the earlier Geonim and Rishonim), but the tradition of studying the Yerushalmi wasn't on the same level as it was not regarded as \"their Talmud\" (I don't think they had full manuscripts of the Yerushalmi, so that combined with it not being the the Talmud of the Geonim, Yerushalmi disappeared towards middle ages).</p>\n<p>So naturally, the Bavli mode of thinking was what survived through the centuries. However, today we have access to the Yerushalmi like never before and there is growing scholarship in it.</p>\n<p>How can we ignore this important part of our mesorah, a mesorah that the hachamim of Bavel said they were subordinate to when both existed at the same time?</p>\n<p>How can we claim that the rulings of the Bavli are binding on the whole nation if there was no Sanhedrin to rule conclusively?

We must compel each and every city and each country to accept all the customs that were put into practice by the Sages of the Talmud, to pass decrees parallelling their decrees, and to observe their ordinances, since <strong>all the matters in the Babylonian Talmud were accepted by the entire Jewish people</strong>.</p>\n<p>(<em>Maimonides, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law.35?lang=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Introduction to Mishneh Torah</a></em>, <strong>my emphases</strong>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's possible that Maimonides is engaging in a little hyperbole here, but his point is clear. The Judaism of today is the Judaism of the Bavli, because that is the Judaism that we accepted upon ourselves.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kessef_Mishneh_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.2.1.1?lang=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kesef Mishneh to Hilchot Mamrim 2:1</a> who suggests that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מיום חתימת המשנה קיימו וקבלו שדורות האחרונים לא יחלקו על הראשונים וכן עשו גם בחתימת הגמ' שמיום שנחתמה לא ניתן רשות לשום אדם לחלוק עליה:‏</p>\n<p>From the day that the Mishnah was completed, they decided and accepted that future generations would not argue against the earlier ones [i.e. the rabbis of the Mishnah]. They acted similarly with the completion of the Talmud: from the day it was completed no one is granted permission to argue against it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although Kesef Mishneh doesn't explicitly discuss Bavli over Yerushalmi, I would argue that he is specifically referring to the communal acceptance of the Bavli. Firstly, because the Yerushalmi was never completed or \"sealed\" in the same way that the Bavli was. And secondly, because again, our community descends from those in Babylon, whose acceptance would have been of the Bavli rather than the Yerushalmi.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Angelic wrestling and the intergenerational transmission of rights and priestly duties\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Gen. 32:26, during Ya'aqobh's struggle with a malakh (angel/emissary), he is struck. The Ba'al ha-Turim there offers two explanations for the location that the malakh chose to strike his body. The first explanation is peculiar (the adversary wanted to determine if he was also a malakh with a straight unjointed leg) but that is not what bothers me here. The Tur's second explanations is that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפסלו מן העבודה לפי שקנה מעשו הבכורה שבהן העבודה \"בכף ירכו\" בגימטריא\nלפוסלו מכהונה</p>\n<p>His intent was to disqualify Ya'aqobh from the [priestly] service, for\nYa'aqobh had purchased the birthright, and the [priestly] service was\ngranted to the firstborn. Thus the gematria of בכף ירכו <em>the socket of\nhis hip</em> (338) is equal to that of לפוסלו מכהונה, <em>to disqualify him\nfrom priesthood</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that the Ba'al ha-Turim is suggesting that the attacker wanted to render him a ba'al mum (i.e. as one carrying a defect/blemish that would invalidate his ability to perform the abhodah) and thereby deprive him of an aspect of the blessing, i.e. the kehunah, he received as part of the birthright.</p>\n<p>My question is as follows: Why would it matter if Ya'qobh was a ba'al mum? Being a ba'al mum does not mean that one cannot pass down the kehunah (priesthood) to their sons. The intergenerational transmission of the rights/blessings of the bekhor would remain uninterrupted, so how is this really an attack on the bekhor's blessing? And if you want to say, that at least it prevented Ya'aqobh himself from the abhodah, we see later on that his injury did not in fact prevent him from bringing qorbanoth (Gen. 46:1). So, what's going on here? What am I missing?</p>\n\n\n",

As a result, he decided not to have children. He was punished for neglecting the mitzvah of having children, and told by Yeshayahu that he must allow the prophecy to run its course. He repented and had a son, Menashe, who committed many murders, forbade Torah study, and propagated idol worship throughout Israel.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Yishmael is also saved from thirst miraculously despite angelic dispute, because he was worthy of it at his time of need, even though he would later become very wicked and his descendants would lead many Jews to die of thirst.</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Let's contrast</strong> these two examples with the case of Micha -the baby in the wall (not the prophet). In that situation, Moshe Rabbeinu begged G-d to save Jewish children from being built into walls. G-d told him that it would be better not to intervene,but he could save one and see what happens. He ended up saving a baby, who became very wicked. Here, G-d suggested allowing the killing to take place because of who that baby would become.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Perhaps if someone else is destroying the baby threat, one should not intervene, but one may not violate even a positive commandment (having children) to eliminate the threat actively, and must even save them (like G-d saved Yishmael).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It's hard to ask about the halacha because there is no time travel in real life. However, we can ask the hashkafa, which will (and does) inform the halacha. A very famous Torah principle is:</p>\n<h3>We only judge a person by what their position is right now.</h3>\n<p>Emphatically, if we asked Hashem if we could go back in time and kill Hitler as a baby, he would say NO!</p>\n<p>Just like He said no to killing Yishmael (He Himself regrets 4 things every day, and one of them is this decision! See Sukka 52b). <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.17?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bereshit 21:17</a> on \"באשר הוא שם\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WHERE HE IS — <strong>According to the actions he is now doing shall he be\njudged and not according to what he may do in future</strong>. Because the\nministering angels laid information against him, saying, “Master of\nthe Universe, for him whose descendants will at one time kill your\nchildren with thirst will You provide a well?” He asked them, “What is\nhe now, righteous or wicked?” They replied to him, “Righteous.” He\nsaid to them, “According to his present deeds will I judge him.” This\nis the meaning of what is written: “[For God hath heard the voice of\nthe lad ] באשר הוא שם in that condition in which he now is” (Genesis\nRabbah 53:14). Where did he (Ishmael) kill Israel with thirst? When\nNebuchadnezzar carried them into exile — as it is said, (Isaiah 21:13,\n14) “The burden upon Arabia … O ye caravans of Dedanites, unto him\nthat is thirsty bring ye water! etc.” When they were bringing them\nnear the Arabians the Israelites said to their captors, “We beg of you\nbring us to the children of our uncle, Ishmael, who will certainly\nshow pity to us”, as it is said, “O ye caravans of the Dedanites\n(דדנים)”; read not דדנים but דודים, kinsmen. — These indeed came to\nthem bringing them salted meat and fish and water-skins inflated with\nair. The Israelites believed that these were full of water and when\nthey placed them in their mouths, after having opened them, the air\nentered their bodies and they died (Eichah Rabbah 2:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ostensibly, <strong>the main message of the book of Yonah is this very message: we don't take prophetic future considerations into account</strong>! Yonah was avoiding his mission because, in his protective leadership of the Jewish people, he didn't want to help the city of Nineveh do teshuva. Why? Because it would lead to a future claim against the Jews, i.e. \"even the people of Nineveh did teshuva!\" Worse, the Torah records that not long after they were spared due to their teshuva, Ashur invaded Eretz Yisrael, sacked cities and exiled the tribes.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does a Jewish community recognize a Jewish person they hadn't seen ever before?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let's say there is a Jewish community where everybody knows each other, for example in a city. Let's say a new Jewish person arrives and manifests their will to get integrated with them. Nobody knows this person there. On what basis would that person be taken as someone belonging to the community?\nStretching the scenario, how likely is it to impersonate a Jewish person and deceive others? If it is a man, wearing a yarmulke might serve as a visible, external, sign; but surely that is not enough.\nIs a newcomer examined somehow? What is checked in these cases?\nAre there \"Jewish identity cards\", or documents? That could show his affiliation to a synagogue or institution  that could help verify one individual's claims, or a certificate of conversion if it is the case.\nIf there is such document, how rude is it to ask that to a newcomer?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>There’s no Jewish identity card!\nIn theory, people who claim to be Jewish should generally be believed absent any specific reason to doubt them. For example, Rambam said (Hilchot Issurei Bi’ah 13:10) that somebody who claims to have converted to Judaism elsewhere is to be believed.\nIn practice, though, standards vary. Some synagogues might demand varying levels of proof, whether a letter from a previous rabbi or a copy of the individual’s parents’ marriage certificate.\n<a href=\"https://www.ccarnet.org/responsa-topics/presumption-of-jewish-identity/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here</a> is a detailed, though perhaps slightly dated, review of the Jewish law on this topic and its application in Reform synagogues.</p>\n\n\n",

Done.</p>\n<p>Thus, until the past 200 years ago or so, obsessing over what your ancestors' customs had been a thousand years prior was an irrelevant distraction at best -- your customs were defined by where you were <strong>now</strong>.</p>\n<p>The whole notion of following ancestral customs only became a thing when people moved to large places that supported multi-custom people and/or communities. Suddenly your custom became where you were from, not where you were now; because your current location says \"hey pick whatever, we don't care.\"</p>\n<p>So today, if someone lives in a place with five different synagogues, each with different customs: first off, if one of those synagogues is a much better fit, and someone feels its customs work for them, and they didn't grow up with any one particular strong family or personal custom otherwise -- then congratulations! You have now just landed ashore in this new location, and you should do like the locals. (If that's Chabad, fine!)</p>\n<p>But if someone is equally okay with all of them, and wants to use ancestry to define their decision, then the above logic gives us a clear answer: <strong>the last known place with clearly-defined customs.</strong></p>\n<p>Two caveats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef would probably tell you that the Ashkenazic ones were all mistaken, so \"the last known place that did halacha right, i.e. the Sefardic ones.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein would caveat it a bit more finely: ignore all changes that said <em>we know we are changing our clear local minhag, and we are doing it because we think this change is better</em> -- which is what happened when Hassidism had people changing to <em>Nusach Sfard</em> -- and <em>then</em> then take the last known place. (He didn't say \"all Hassidim <em>must</em> switch back to Ashkenaz\"; he says \"any Hassid of Ashenazic ancestry who's reconsidering their practices has cart blanche to switch back to Ashkenaz.\")</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope this helps you understand the <em>halachic theory</em> behind why this is correct, which is why I've taken the time to answer it here.</p>\n\n\n",

He mentioned the corners of Moab in order to inform Balak that his people would not fall into the hand of Israel now, but in the end of days Moab will not be saved from the hand of the ruling king [in Israel]. And the meaning of ‘the corners’ of Moab is that this ruler [in Israel] will break down all the sons of Seth, and they [Moab] will not be saved, even though they are cut off on ‘the corner,’ and have no name among the nations, and will not fight against Israel. (Translation from Sefaria my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like Rambam (already mentioned) numerous commentators point to it being a reference to Dovid HaMelech. Rashi notes the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Onkelos_Numbers.24.17&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum</a> who showcases the chronology of events:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I see it but not now, I perceive it but not in the near future; a star [king] has gone forth from Yaakov, and a staff has arisen [the Moshiach will be magnified by] from Yisroel, which will smash the corners [kill the leaders] of Moav, and impale all of the sons of Sheis [will rule over mankind].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Malbim_on_Numbers.24.17.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> writes expressly that it is a reference to Dovid HaMelech.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bamidbar.24.17.1-2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachaye</a> provides greater details to fill in the gaps:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אראנו ולא עתה, “I can see it — but not now.” <strong>The prophecy being introduced refers to David who four hundred years from this date would smash the nobles of Moav.</strong> The words וקרקר כל בני שת, “and undermine the children of Sheis,” is a reference to mankind as such which is descended in the main from the descendants of Sheth, Adam’s third son Noach being one of them. (Compare <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.8.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel II 8:2</a> where Dovid’s victory over Moav is documented.)\nAnother way of understanding the reference by Bilam to the “descendants of Sheis.” The word שת may not refer to a human being but to “foundation.” We find the word שתין meaning “the foundations of the earth” in Talmudic language, a reference to the “navel” of the earth under the Holy Temple. Bileam foresaw that Dovid’s victories would create havoc among the existing world order in the countries surrounding the land of Israel. The words “and Edom will become a conquest” also apply to that period as we know from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.11.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kings I 11:16</a> that Edom”s males were wiped out by David’s general Yoav. The words (verse 19) וירד מיעקב mean that someone descended from Yaakov will arise and destroy the remnants of all the cities of Edom. This may be a veiled reference to Rome. Finally, the words וירד מיעקב also mean that the messiah will be descended from Israel. The words ולא יהיה שריד לבית עשו, “no remnant will remain of Esau,” in Ovadiah 18 are the logical conclusion of Bilam’s prophecy here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Bilaam was the greatest prophet to the non-Jewish nations at his time. This section of Bilaam’s prophecy from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BaMidbar 24:17</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>אראנו ולא עתה אשורנו ולא קרוב <strong>דרך כוכב מיעקב וקם שבט מישראל</strong> ומחץ פאתי מואב וקרקר כל בני שת</p>\n<p>The opening words of his prophecy are about the (<em>future, from his perspective then,</em>) final redemption and establish that there are two general sequential stages to the process, one that happens first (אראנו ולא עתה) followed later by the second stage (אשורנו ולא קרוב).</p>\n<p>This is in keeping with the teaching of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in his <a href=\"https://ramhal.net/5033/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%94-%D7%96%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%94/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מאמר הגאולה, second chapter</a>. The earlier stage is called the Pekidah פקידה and the later stage is called the Zachirah זכירה.</p>\n<p>In continuation of this sequential pattern, the first half of the language of Bilaam’s prophecy is a direct reference to the two part prophetic dream that was said by Yosef HaTzaddik when he was a seventeen year old boy prior to his being sold into slavery by his brothers. 17 which is the gematria of the word, <em>good</em> טוב, and continuing the numerical sequence from 17 leads to 18, which is the gematria, <em>life</em> חי and which in small sum gematria (מספר קטן) is משיח (Moshiach). Like it says in Ezekiel 14:20-23:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חי אני נאום אדני יהוה גו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second half of Yosef’s  two part dream is recorded in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 37:9-10</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויחלם עוד חלום אחר ויספר אתו לאחיו ויאמר הנה חלמתי חלום עוד והנה השמש\nוהירח ואחד עשר כוכבים משתחוים לי</p>\n<p>ויספר אל אביו ואל אחיו ויגער בו אביו ויאמר לו מה החלום הזה אשר חלמת\nהבוא נבוא אני ואמך ואחיך להשתחות לך ארצה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the original prophecy of Yosef, it connects the <strong>eleven stars</strong> with the <strong>eleven brothers of Yosef</strong>, who were also sons of Yaacov.</p>\n<p>This reference to the number eleven is reminiscent of the eleven ingredients of the incense that was burned by the Kohanim in the Temple service each day. This incense was burned by Aharon the High Priest to stop the plague from the Angel of Death which was killing the Jewish people at a time of great public rejection of G-d’s commandments like is seen in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.17.11-14?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BaMidbar 17:11-14</a>.</p>\n<p>It is emphasized in the Torah that this incense is only valid when every single one of its ingredients are included together and in their proper proportion. Failure to include all the ingredients together properly obligates the one attempting this improper mixture to death. This is a sign of the importance and meaning of Jewish unity and is also the unique sign of Kingship connected with Moshiach ben Yosef.</p>\n<p>That the 11 sons, together with their Mother and Father, would bow to Yosef at some point in the future is a sign of Yosef’s future Kingship, that he was משנה למלך like it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.43?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 41:41-44</a>.</p>\n<p>Their bowing is a sign that they are <em>loyal, willing and faithful</em> <strong>subjects</strong> and <strong>servants</strong> <em><strong>to the King</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>An important detail that should be noted in order to understand all of Yosef’s second dream is its context with the first  prophetic dream that he had, which preceded it and is mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.5?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 37:5-8</a>.</p>\n<p>That in the first dream, both Yosef and his eleven brothers are included in the same dream category. In the first dream, they are all bundled sheaves of grain.</p>\n<p>The bundled sheaves illustrate that unity <em><strong>first begins</strong></em> in small, similar groups, like husband and wife, family or tribal groups. Then those smaller groups find unity of purpose with each other, cooperating and working for the common good which leads to an increase in and diversification of life.</p>\n<p>This increase and diversification of life is the <em>first commandment</em> of G-d in the Torah, <em><strong>to be fruitful and multiply</strong></em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.22?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:22</a>), meaning to reproduce the species, increase their numbers and diversify, forming variations (like the Hebrew expression סגולה has a connotation of <em>adaptability or flexibility</em> מסוגל) within the species. (<em>That diversity within a species, meaning successfully adapting to multiple environments, adds resilience and increased vitality to that species.</em>) This commandment applies to all living things. Accepting and fulfilling it is the revelation of G-d’s Kingship as it pertains to Yosef (who like Moshe Rabbeinu, earns and attains the <em>Chaya aspect</em> of soul חיה See the description in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21490&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Ohr HaChamah of Zohar, parshat Shemot 7b</a>).</p>\n<p>This essential commandment for life was then repeated <em><strong>a second time</strong></em> specifically to the beginning of the human species (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.27?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:26-28</a>), who are to serve as the representative of the King משנה למלך and behave similar to G-d above (דומה לעליון) in preserving and protecting (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 2:15</a>) לעבדה ולשמרה themselves and all life, and consequently meaning <em><strong>all of His creations</strong></em>. These are the two aspects or signs of Kingship.</p>\n<p>In Yosef’s second dream, his eleven brothers are eleven stars. So too, from the context of his first dreams, Yosef is also in the category of a star like his brothers.</p>\n<p>The significance of this is that in the context of Yosef’s dreams, the star that arises from Yaacov (דרך כוכב מיעקב) is associated with Yosef, meaning <em>Moshiach ben Yosef</em>.</p>\n<p>Bilaam’s prophecy also indicates that <strong>one of those eleven</strong> <em>would also be associated with <strong>the scepter of Kingship</strong></em>, (וקם שבט מישראל) the sign of a second aspect of Kingship.</p>\n<p>This scepter, <em>the second sign of Kingship</em> is reminiscent of the <em><strong>Lulav</strong></em> (<em>which is built upon the foundation of Jewish unity like the incense, because the commandment of Lulav requires the unity of all 4 species, representing all types of Jews, religiously observant and otherwise, being held together</em>) but which additionally is taken up by Jews on Sukkot and waved in all four directions of the compass, south, north, east and west, above and below. This additional dimension is the second aspect of Malchut, which is a sign revealing G-d’s Kingship over the whole world, meaning the whole universe and at all times, past, present and future. This second aspect pertains to <strong>Moshiach ben David</strong>, or as Rambam describes, <em>Moshiach with certainty</em>.</p>\n<p>This idea, that there are two distinct aspects to Kingship, that from Yosef (Moshiach ben Yosef) and the other from Yehudah (Moshiach ben David) is also what is expressed by Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.11.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 11 of the Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and their Wars, Halacha 4</a> in the context of <em>Presumed to be Moshiach</em> and <em>Moshiach with Certainty</em>.</p>\n<p>In regard to the terminology used by Rambam, meaning his particular and distinct categorizations, it should be emphasized that these changes in nomenclature are innovations by Rambam which were not used prior to his time. The traditional teaching on the subject of Moshiach uses only the terms and names that pertain to <a href=\"https://ramhal.net/5093/%D7%9B%D7%97-%D7%94%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93-%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%9F-%D7%A2%D7%9C-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97-%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%9A-%D7%94%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A8/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moshiach ben Yosef</a>, also called “Ephraim, My Righteous Moshiach” (<em>like Ephraim was the son of Yosef HaTzaddik in Egypt</em>) and Moshiach ben David.</p>\n<p>The language of the second half of that original prophecy by Bilaam was established by the <em>prophetic blessing by <strong>Yaacov</strong></em>. Yaacov, who after so many years of sadness <em>would again be <strong>called Yisroel</strong></em> in Egypt with the return of his son, Yosef to him.</p>\n<p>That to receive prophecy requires the Prophet to be in a state of joy. So when Yosef was sold into slavery and went missing, <em>Yisroel reverted to his non-prophetic name of Yaacov because of his sadness</em>.</p>\n<p>In his last 17 years, when his son Yosef had been returned to him from his captivity, Yaacov’s sadness was transformed into joy and his prophetic name of Yisroel was renewed.</p>\n<p>At the end of Yaacov’s life, he assembled all his sons to give each of them a unique, prophetic blessing. The blessing for Yehudah appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.8-12?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parshat VaYechi, Bereshit 49:8-12</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יְהוּדָ֗ה אַתָּה֙ יוֹד֣וּךָ אַחֶ֔יךָ יָדְךָ֖ בְּעֹ֣רֶף אֹיְבֶ֑יךָ <strong>יִשְׁתַּחֲו֥וּ לְךָ֖ בְּנֵ֥י אָבִֽיךָ׃</strong>\nגּ֤וּר אַרְיֵה֙ יְהוּדָ֔ה מִטֶּ֖רֶף בְּנִ֣י עָלִ֑יתָ כָּרַ֨ע רָבַ֧ץ כְּאַרְיֵ֛ה וּכְלָבִ֖יא מִ֥י יְקִימֶֽנּוּ׃\n<strong>לֹֽא־יָס֥וּר שֵׁ֙בֶט֙ מִֽיהוּדָ֔ה</strong> וּמְחֹקֵ֖ק מִבֵּ֣ין רַגְלָ֑יו עַ֚ד <strong>כִּֽי־יָבֹ֣א שִׁילֹ֔ה</strong> וְל֖וֹ יִקְּהַ֥ת עַמִּֽים׃\nאֹסְרִ֤י לַגֶּ֙פֶן֙ עִירֹ֔ה וְלַשֹּׂרֵקָ֖ה בְּנִ֣י אֲתֹנ֑וֹ כִּבֵּ֤ס בַּיַּ֙יִן֙ לְבֻשׁ֔וֹ וּבְדַם־עֲנָבִ֖ים סוּתֹֽה׃\nחַכְלִילִ֥י עֵינַ֖יִם מִיָּ֑יִן וּלְבֶן־שִׁנַּ֖יִם מֵחָלָֽב׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is here that <strong>Kingship is established for Yehudah and his tribe with the same sign that indicated Kingship for Yosef</strong>. That Yaacov states <strong>his brothers would bow to him</strong>. This sign is referring to Kingship like Yosef's in Egypt, meaning Moshiach ben Yosef.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that immediately after Yaacov mentions the sign of bowing, it applies three different terms for the three stages in the maturation and development of a lion, that of a cub גור אריה, that of a mature adult אריה, and when it becomes the leader of the pride and King לביא. This term refers to when the lion develops its full mane, much like a crown surrounding its head.</p>\n<p>This last term combines two aspects, לב, that the King is called the <strong>Heart</strong>, and יא, like the 11 other sons of Yaacov and the 11 ingredients in the incense. That the King is the heart of the whole nation, like Rambam says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.3.6?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings, chapter 3, Law 6</a>.</p>\n<p>It is also in that blessing that <em>mention of <strong>the Scepter of Kingship</strong> is made</em> (לֹֽא־יָס֥וּר שֵׁ֙בֶט֙ מִֽיהוּדָ֔ה). This second sign of Kingship, different from the sign of Kingship of Yosef, refers to Moshiach ben David who, like King David, his ancestor will be descended from the tribe of Yehudah.</p>\n<p>This emphasizes that the qualities of Kingship found in Moshiach ben Yosef and Moshiach ben David are ultimately manifest in the same single individual. They arise from Yaacov and Yisroel who are one and the same person (דרך כוכב מיעקב וקם שבט מישראל). This follows the prophecy of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.37.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel, like is found in chapter 37:19</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר אלהם כה אמר אדני יהוה הנה א<strong>ני לקח את עץ יוסף</strong> אשר ביד אפרים ושבטי\nישראל  חבריו <strong>ונתתי אותם עליו את עץ יהודה ועשיתם לעץ אחד</strong> <a href=\"https://ramhal.net/5125/%D7%954-%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%AA-%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99-%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%97%D7%99%D7%AA/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">והיו אחד בידי</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That <a href=\"https://ramhal.net/5099/%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A5-%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%94-%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%94/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this unification of these two qualities of Kingship into the single individual is done specifically by the hand of G-d</a>, which is a reference to resurrection like is found in the prophecy of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.60.21?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 60:21</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעַמֵּךְ֙ כֻּלָּ֣ם צַדִּיקִ֔ים לְעוֹלָ֖ם יִ֣ירְשׁוּ אָ֑רֶץ נֵ֧צֶר מטעו [מַטָּעַ֛י] מַעֲשֵׂ֥ה יָדַ֖י לְהִתְפָּאֵֽר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The prophetic blessing of Yaacov to Yehudah also emphasizes that this second type of Kingship will stay with his descendants <em>until <strong>the coming of Shilo</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>That the phrase, כי יבא שילה is gematria 388 which refers to the word אלבשנה from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.5.3?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim 5:3</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>פָּשַׁ֙טְתִּי֙ אֶת־כֻּתׇּנְתִּ֔י</strong> אֵיכָ֖כָה <strong>אֶלְבָּשֶׁ֑נָּה</strong> רָחַ֥צְתִּי אֶת־רַגְלַ֖י אֵיכָ֥כָה אֲטַנְּפֵֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have removed my coat, how shall I put it (back) on?</p>\n<p><strong>The coat</strong> is a reference to the <strong>special coat of many colors</strong> worn by Yosef and which was given to him by his father Yaacov like is mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.3?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 37:3</a>. The removal of this garment, mentioned in Shir HaShirim is referring to the prophetic requirement that Moshiach ben Yosef will die. <em>He will remove his garment</em>, meaning his body, from his soul.</p>\n<p>This incredible statement follows the traditional teaching brought by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshaiah_Rabbah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Hoshaia the Great</a>, who was also known as Rabbi Oshaya, (<em>the Father of the Mishnah</em>) that is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.35.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot Rabbah, chapter 35</a> which says:</p>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי הוֹשְׁעְיָא, עַל שׁוּם שֶׁהוּא עוֹמֵד לְמַשְׁכֵּן, שֶׁאִם נִתְחַיְבוּ שׂוֹנְאֵיהֶם שֶׁל יִשְׂרָאֵל כְּלָיָה, יְהֵא מִתְמַשְׁכֵּן עֲלֵיהֶן. אָמַר משֶׁה לִפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא וַהֲלוֹא עֲתִידִים הֵם שֶׁלֹא יִהְיֶה לָהֶם לֹא מִשְׁכָּן וְלֹא מִקְדָּשׁ, וּמַה תְּהֵא עֲלֵיהֶם, <strong>אָמַר הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא אֲנִי נוֹטֵל מֵהֶם צַדִּיק אֶחָד וּמְמַשְׁכְּנוֹ בַּעֲדָם, וּמְכַפֵּר אֲנִי עֲלֵיהֶם עַל כָּל עֲווֹנוֹתֵיהֶם, וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר (איכה ב, ד): וַיַּהֲרֹג כֹּל מַחֲמַדֵּי עָיִן</strong>.</p>\n<p>The posuk from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Lamentations.2.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha 2:4</a> and also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Lamentations.3.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha 3:12</a>, which Rabbi Hoshaia brings as support for his teaching parallels the language from the prophecy of Bilaam (BaMidbar 24:17), דרך כוכב מיעקב גו׳ which is actually referring to <a href=\"https://ramhal.net/5091/%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%97%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%AA/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moshiach ben Yosef who is destined to either be murdered or simply die in payment of whatever debt the nation of Israel has accumulated over time</a>.

This debt transfer is possible because the King represents the whole nation, meaning the concept of צבור.

    "content": "# Does everyone end up with their 'soulmate'/bashert?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I ask this in all respect because there are people who end up not having a romantic partner or spouse in their life. Yet, there is an assertion that HaShem has designated for each individual a soulmate. Does any rabbinic source have an explanation for this phenomenon? (Please cite quotations, if any, thanks in advance).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>We do say that Hashem finds a match for everyone, as in Maseches Sotah 2A. Skip the next paragraph if you already know that Gemarah.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here's a simple summary of the relevant part of that Gemarah. There appears to be an argument between Reish Lakish and R' Yochanan regarding whether a person finds a match depending on their merits. In support of R' Yochanan's view that it is independent of one's actions, the Gemarah quotes Rav saying that three things are determined for a person 40 days before their fetal conception, and one of those things is בת פלוני לפלוני, apparently deciding their match. The Gemarah concludes that in reality there never was an argument, but rather one's first match is predetermined while the second is dependent on one's actions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The interpretation of the Meiri on this section answers your question, I believe. I'll paraphrase the relevant section in English. I got it from <a href=\"https://shas.alhatorah.org/Full/Sotah/2a.8#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">alhatorah.org</a>, and I suggest reading it in his words (if you use the link I posted it will be in the sixth paragraph).</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p>When the Gemarah differentiates between the first and second matches, saying that the first is predetermined, it does not mean one's first <em>spouse</em> is predetermined, and that if he (for example) divorces her, his chance of finding a second wife is dependent on his actions. Instead, the first <strong>proclamation</strong> is predetermined, while the second is dependent on one's actions. Why? <em>Because the principle that it depends on one's actions is always true, just that before one's conception, one is deemed a tzaddik, having never sinned, and therefore they are automatically found righteous and deserving.</em></p>\n<p>It follows from this reading that even finding one's first basheret can be diverted, G-d forbid. Further, the Meiri clarifies that when it says \"the match depends on one's actions\", that does not only mean <em>finding the match</em>, but also which type of person is found. Positive traits will engender the merit/ability to find a match in someone with similar positive traits.</p>\n<p>So basically, if you remain a tzaddik then yes, it's predetermined, but otherwise there can be obstructions (G-d forbid) or diversions to people of variable quality.</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p>Note that there are other interpretations.</p>\n\n\n",

Even some greatest  Tzaddikim did not give than a fifth. Becoming rich should not be the motive but rather for the joy of the mitzvah itself. You might be thinking of Micah 3, \"Test Me and see if I will not open the windows of heaven\" when you bring in the tithes but I think this is a national exhortation and promise, not necessarily individual.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shulchan Aruch‎ | Yoreh Deah #249</p>\n<p>How much should one give and how should one give it? In this regard,\nthere are sixteen sections:</p>\n<p>Section 1: The measure of giving, if one's hand is capable, is to give\naccording to the needs of the poor. And if one's hand is not capable,\nthey should give up to a fifth of their possessions, which is a\ndistinguished commandment. And one-tenth is a moderate measure, less\nthan that is considered stinginess. And this fifth is from the profits\nattained each year.</p>\n<p>Rema: <strong>A person should not squander more than a fifth,</strong> as they may\nneed it for others (Ba'al Ha'Itur citing the Talmud). However, during one's final moments, a person can give\nas much charity as they wish (based on Rashi, Rosh, Ramban, and\nMordechai). And one should not use their own tithe for other\ncommandments, such as candles for the synagogue or other commandments,\nbut rather give it to the poor (Maharil, Laws of Rosh Hashanah).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>If he's poor depends on what assets he has so it depends. Having savings to last a year is considered not poor (add source). For individual decisions talk to God and run your idea by decent, reasonable people.</p>\n<p>I found in Sefer haMidot giving charity raises your mazal, leads to faith, and brings the rain (#6, 29, and 47). Item 69 however brings that one who shears (גוזז) his possessions is saved from the judgement of Gehenom. This sounds like he gives away all but the skin on his back, but requires more looking into.  There's a Sefer haMidot with sources but I don't have it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a concept of hishtadlus. It means that you have to do your due diligence to access that which Hashem wants to give you. The other side is hasgacha, that everything that happens is only because Hashem made it happen.\nWe have to do our hishtadlus. As a person's emunah gets more and more and their trust in hashgacha gets higher and higher, their hishtadlus is less.</p>\n<p>One could technically attain a level where they needed no hishtadlus whatsoever - but that would takes level of emunah that takes a whole life to attain. On our level we need to do reasonable hishtadlus.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other side, coming out of a restaurant with a bag of something (even if it is only a kosher drink) might create this perception.</p>\n<p>So the answer is likely to be context-dependent. To take your example, everyone knows that McDonald's is not kosher, so no one will start eating there after seeing a Jew come out of the drive-in. On the other side, people might start to believe this Jew doesn't eat kosher.</p>\n<p>Answering a similar question din.org <a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2011/09/13/drink-at-non-kosher-restaurant/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to Iggros Moshe, maris ayin applies when “Someone thinks\nthat I violated something, or he thinks that I inappropriately ate\nsomething non-kosher”.</p>\n<p>However, this applies to eating in a non-kosher restaurant, but not\nnecessarily to buying a drink over the counter. <strong>It is normal for\nsomebody to buy a drink over the counter without eating anything in\nthe restaurant, and therefore it appears that this will not constitute\nmaris ayin.</strong></p>\n<p>Yet, it is better to avoid entering a non-kosher restaurant\naltogether, and if possible one should buy the drink at a drinks\nmachine. Where this is not possible, one may enter to buy the drink,\nbut not sit down at a table to drink it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R Ari Wasserman has an entire chapter on the topic in his excellent book <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/making-it-work-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Making It Work</a>. <strong>He quotes R Asher Weiss permitting a scenario similar to the one you describe where the action is commonly known to be permitted</strong> (i.e., buying a kosher drink from McDonald's).</p>\n<p><strong>Ultimately these questions depend on the specifics of the situation</strong>, both in terms of the restaurant, the food consumed, the possibility someone will see the act, and maybe even the individual involved.

    "content": "# Is the newborn naturally unclean with the mother, or contingently if it comes in contact?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does the newborn also share the uncleanness with the mother due to birth, Lev. 12, is the child source of the impurity?</p>\n<p>What is the Halakah ruling for purification of the husband or child who comes in contact with her or if it is naturally unclean as the source of her impurity? However, the main question is this: when the mother goes for purification rites to the temple after the whole purification period, does she takes along the child as well since this period pertains to the child as well. If the child is the source of impurity then the rites particularly is meant for the child, then its mother.</p>\n<p>Also, have commentators used such verses to support this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(ESV) Psalm 51:5: “Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.”<br />\nJob 15:14: “What is man, that he can be pure? Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?”<br />\nJob 25:4: “How then can man be in the right before God? How can he who is born of woman be pure?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4IrBR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4IrBR.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a><br />\nNeed full text of this  Sifra Tazria Parashat Yoledet\n(the earliest known Rabbinic commentary on Lev. 12), The actual argument is complicated. That children are a source of uncleanness is denied in Section 8, but re-affirmed in Section 11.</p>\n<p>I need as ancient sources as possible from commentaries or any Jewish literature. Quote English translation for every text.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The child would indeed be ritually impure as he has touched the mother throughout childbirth (although it might only be contracted once he's born and touches her then). This is because a woman who has given birth (a yoledes) transmits impurity via touch. See eg <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Those_Who_Defile_Bed_or_Seat.1.1?lang=en#:\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides</a></p>\n<p>However this impurity would be a lower level than the mother, as is explicit in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifra%2C_Tazria_Parashat_Yoledet%2C_Section_1.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifra Tazria #8</a> (second part of the section) which states that despite causing tumah, and being able to become tameh, the child is not impure itself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תאמר בולד שיש לו טומאה! הואיל ויש לו טומאה יהא טמא! תלמוד לומר \"וטמאה\" – <strong>היא טמאה ואין הולד טמא</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Would you say the same of the child, which is subject to tumah in and of itself? Since it is subject to tumah, it should be tamei (in birth)! It must, therefore, be written \"she shall be unclean,\" <strong>and not the child.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would thus be considered no different to any other person who touched her. Like all these people, no sacrifices would be required for the child (unlike the mother)</p>\n<p>Either way, there is no prohibition in becoming impure, and certainly not for a baby. It would confer certain restrictions (eg not eating sacrificial meat or visiting the Temple in Jerusalem) and at some point to remove the restrictions he would need to be immersed.</p>\n<p>I have never heard of any custom, modern or ancient, that would restrict a mother from feeding her child - as above, there is no prohibition in becoming impure.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud in Shabbat (21.2) says the following:</p>\n<p>“ The commandment of Hanukkah is that every household light one candle. And those who wish to beautify the commandment (Mehadrin) should light one candle for each member of the household. And those who wish to beautify the commandment further (Mehadrin Min Hamehadrin) should on the first night light one candle and then go on to to add (1 per night).”\nOur Rabbis the Baalei Ha’Tosaphot say that the Mehadrin Min Hamehadrin do not build upon the Mehadrin, who say to light for everyone, because (that would defeat) one of the main purposes (of the Hanukkah candles, which) is that people should see the candles and know what day of Hanukkah it is. If you were to light the Hanukkah candles depending on how many family members there are- you would have no idea what day of Chanukah it was! For example: (Lets say) someone sees four candles (in the window)… Possibility 1: There could just be one person in the house- and it was the fourth day of Chanukah. Possibility 2: It could be that there were 2 people in the house and it was the second day. Possibility 3: It could be that there are four people and it was the first day. [His message is clear: there has to be a set standard]. Therefore, we should only light one candle for the entire household one the first night, followed by two on the second night, and so on.</p>\n<p>However, Maimonides of blessed memory in the beginning of the fourth chapter wrote:</p>\n<p>\"How many candles [does one light?] ... each and every household should light one candle ... and one who wishes to glorify [the commandment] should light candles according to the number of the members of the household ... and those who wish to glorify further ... should light a candle for everyone on the first night, and continue to add ... [one candle per night]. How is this? Were the members of the household ten men, he lights on the first night ten candles, and on the second night, twenty candles ... and the common custom in all our cities in Spain is that all members of the household light one candle on the first night, and continue to add a candle every night, until it comes out that on the eighth night each lights eight candles, whether the members of the household are many, or whether there is one man.\"\nUntil here is the quote, though it should be noted that the custom of the people of Spain is as the Tosaphot.</p>\n<p>The Talmud brings two reasons why this is so. The first reason is to account for the days that are passing: In other words, one should know how many days of Hanukkah have passed, with the current day included in that number. This reason certainly seems closer to the position of Tosaphot, since if every member of the household lights, we would not know what day of Hanukkah it it, as I have written. But there is another reason: Because (with every passing day), the holiness (of Hanukkah) increases. This, apparently, is the final reason that the Talmud concludes with (as is evident from the account of the 'Elders of Tzidon', see there). According to this reason we are not interested in marking how many days have passed, which is certainly more in line with the Maimonides's position, that one can also follow the opinion of the Mehadrin (Vilna Goan). For this reason, we rule mainly like Maimonides. However, there is a question on Maimonides, who mentions the custom of the Sefard communities, which appear to be the opposite of his position. Why doesn’t he write that their behavior is not in accordance with the law, and why does he not protest their practice, since it is does not follow the direction of the discussion in the Talmud? (See the Lechem Mishna, who also asks similarly.)</p>\n<p>It is therefore more probable that the Talmudic dispute is not over the reason for this mitzvah (command), for one mitzvah may have many reasons. Rather, the dispute revolves around the rulings of Beit Shamai and Beit Hillel. Beis Shammai's position is that on the first day eight are lit, followed by seven on the next, and so on. Beis Hillel's position is that one is lit on the first day, followed by two on the next, and so on. Concerning this the Talmud in Shabbos is speaking: There is a disagreement (Machloket) concerning what Beit Hillel and Beit Shamai are actually arguing about. According to the first opinion, Beit Shamai is of the opinion that (the reason why you decrease is because) you need to mark the number of days coming up. According to Beit Hillel (the reason why you decrease is because you need to mark how many) days have passed. According to the second opinion, Beit Shamai is of the opinion that (the reason why you decrease is to represent) the waning holiness of Chanukah (just as the sacrifices in the Temple on the Sukkos Festival diminished each succeeding day). According to Beit Hillel it is the reverse, one should always commemorate holiness in a manner that shows it increasing [Ma'alin Bakodesh v'Ain Moreedin]. Truthfully though, Beit Hillel could have been agreeable to both reasons offered on their behalf [marking the passing days and the increasing holiness of the Holiday, and these reasons are not mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p>However, this is not reflected in the words of Tosaphot, which I don't understand. Tosaphot says that if we light in accordance to how many people are in the house you would not be able to tell what day of Hanukkah it is. However, you could light in accordance to the members of the household and still be able to tell what day of Hanukkah it is, if each member of the household lights in a separate place, like we do. Then, you would be able to tell how many days of Hanukkah have passed!</p>\n<p>However, there is an answer to their words, for the preferred approach is to light the candles at the entrance of the house facing the street, on the left side, within a hands-breadth of the entrance, as we will later explain. If this is the case, then it is necessary that all of the candles be in one place, and then there is a problem of recognizing what day of Hanukkah it is.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that it is not the case that in all locations one must light near the house's entrance facing the street, as I will explain. That is why our communities have not seen the above law in practice, as all light within their homes. In such a situation even the Tosaphits would agree that one should follow Maimonides, and each should light in his own separate place, thereby ensuring that the right day will be recognized. See further in section 15.</p>\n<p>According to the preceding explanation all has been reconciled. The Tosafos rule as the Talmud, who lit at the entrance of their houses, and this was how the Sefard communities conducted themselves [unlike the practice quoted in Maimonides]. Maimonides was speaking of when one can only light within the house, or possibly even according to the Talmud, as he may have understood that it was allowing the option of choosing where to light, as each place has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, he saw no reason to protest the behavior of the Sefard communities</p>\n<p>Now it is clear that our teacher the Beis Yosef would rule in section 2 as Tosafos, since this is theSefard custom. The Magid Mishna reports as well that this was the custom in his community. The Rema, for his part, rules as Miamonides, and here is his ruling:</p>\n<p>\"There are those who say that each member of the household lights, and that indeed is the accepted custom. One should therefore be careful that each places his menorah in a different location, so that it will be clear how many lights are being lit on each night.\"\nUntil here is the quote, and it is in accordance with Miamonides. Note that he is particular that each menorah be placed in its own location, which is as our custom to light within the house, and in this way even Tosafos would approve. The result here is that there really is no dispute in law, it is just a question of how its application changes depending on the location of the menorah.</p>\n<p>(In this way the question of the Taz in comment 1 is also resolved, as he was puzzled that we should find the Ashkenazic communities ruling as Maimonides while the Sephardic rule as Tosafos. This entire explanation can also be found in the Keneses Yechezkel, in chapter 17. The Gra hints to this as well in comment 5, and this is then the accepted explanation. Attend to the sources and this will found to be correct.)</p>\n\n\n",

When it discusses making pictures of humans it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֶלָּא מֵעַתָּה פַּרְצוּף אָדָם לְחוֹדֵיהּ תִּשְׁתְּרֵי? אַלְּמָה תַּנְיָא: כׇּל הַפַּרְצוּפוֹת מוּתָּרִין חוּץ מִפַּרְצוּף אָדָם! אָמַר רַב הוּנָא בְּרֵיהּ דְּרַב אִידִי: מִפִּרְקֵיהּ דְּאַבָּיֵי שְׁמִיעָא לִי: ״לֹא תַעֲשׂוּן אִתִּי״ — לֹא תַּעֲשׂוּן אוֹתִי.</p>\n<p>The Gemara raises a difficulty: However, if that is so, let the fashioning of an image of a human face [partzuf ] alone be permitted. Why, then, is it taught in a baraita: All faces are permitted for ornamental purposes, except for the face of a person? Rav Huna, son of Rav Idi, said: From a lecture of Abaye I heard that there is a different reason why one may not form an image of a human face, as the verse states: “You shall not make with Me [iti]” (Exodus 20:19). This can be read as: You shall not make Me [oti]. Since man is created in the image of God, it is prohibited to form an image of a human being.

However, he notes that most people nowadays are lenient and taking photos involves some form of grama (indirect action) which makes it okay. That being said, he does warn against it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משום שמזיק לנפש שעי\"ז עלול ליתפס רוח טומאה על התמונה</p>\n<p>Because it is harmful to the soul that through this it is likely that an impure spirit may catch on the image.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although, he does say that it is allowed to have images of tzaddikim as they go in the way of Hashem etc.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why doesn't the shulchan aruch mention the basic way of lighting Chanuka candles?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (O\"Ch 671:2) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כמה נרות מדליק בלילה הראשון מדליק אחד מכאן ואילך מוסיף והולך אחד בכל לילה עד שבליל אחרון יהיו שמונה ואפי' אם רבים בני הבית לא ידליקו יותר. הג\"ה וי\"א דכל אחד מבני הבית ידליק וכן המנהג פשוט ויזהרו ליתן כל א' וא' נרותיו במקום מיוחד כדי שיהיה היכר כמה נרות מדליקים</p>\n<p>How many candles does one light? On the first night he lights one, and from then and on he adds a additional one every night, until he lights 8 candles. And even if there are multiple household members they shouldn't light more than that. Rema: and some say that every household member should light, and this is the common practice. And they should be careful to place each person's candles in a specific place so that it'll be clear how many candles they're lighting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, neither the Sh'A nor the Rema mention what is seemingly the basic form of the mitzva¹, which is to light a single candle per household per night, nor do they mention the <em>mehadrin</em> level, which is to light a single candle per household member per night, the only mention the <em>mehadrin min hamehadrin</em>. Why is this? Did they hold that we <strong>must</strong> do the <em>mehadrin min hamehadrin</em>? If so, why?</p>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li>As brought in Gemara Shabbos (21b) and all of the rishonim's understanding of that gemara, and in Rambam (megilla v'chanuka 4:1), among others</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Peri Megadim notes this as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמחבר שסתם משמע דהוספה מדינא וצ״ע כי יש נפקא מינה\nלדינא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Mehaber states it plainly [i.e. without explaining that me'iqar hadin one flame is sufficient to fulfull the miswa] and it sounds like he holds that adding [each night] is the law and this requires deep investigation for if this is so then there are practical distinctions that emerge in the application of the law</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately we do not have an answer from the Peri Megadim. However R. Mordekhai Gifter, in a letter to R. El'azar Menahem Man Shakh, suggested the following (Pirqe ha-Mo'adim on Hanukah, vol. 2, p. 283):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה יתכן, דהידור זה כבר קיבלנו עלינו ונעשה חובה\nכמו בתפלת ערבית דנעשה חובה ע״י הקבלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and here it is possible to say that the hiddur [of lighting additional lights each night] was already accepted upon ourselves as obligatory, just like tefillath 'arabbhith was rendered obligatory by means of its acceptance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to understand the intent here, one ought be reminded that despite 'arabhith being formulated as a reshuth (elective) prayer, it nevertheless became obligatory by virtue of its widespread practice. The Arukh ha-Shulhan 235:9 for example writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודע דאף על גב דתפלת ערבית רשות, כבר כתב הרי\"ף דקבלנו עלינו כחובה, ולכן\nהפוסקים לא הזכירו זה כלל, ואין שום הפרש בינה לתפלת שחרית ומנחה.</p>\n<p>And know, that even though tefillath 'arabhith is elective, already we\nsee from the Ri\"f that we accepted it upon ourselves as obligatory,\nand accordingly the [later] Poseqim don't mention [its elective\ncharacter] at all, and there is no differentiation between [how\nobligatory it is as compared to] Shaharith and Minhah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Yalqut Yosef (Hanukah, p. 108) cites the Yomin de-Hanukah (s. 15) as suggesting that the Mehaber actually held that lighting in the mehadrin min ha-mehadrin way is not in fact a hidur but is actually a taqanath Hazal (required rabbinic legislation) - and that only in exceptional circumstances may one light in other ways (i.e. with just one ner). Such a position holds that the sugya ought be learned as concluding that lighting by adding each night is fully obligatory. He brings two \"proofs\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א. שבגמ ערכין י איתא כל ימי חנוכה גומרין את ההלל ואילו בפסח אין גומרין\nאלא יום אחד בלבד ומטעם דימי סוכות חלוקין הן בקרבנותיהן וימי פסח אין\nחלוקין ופירש ר\"שי בס הפרדס (סי קצח) שחנוכה הוי דומיא דחג משום דחלוק\nבקרבנותיו והמגיה שם הגיה בנרותיו במקום בקרבנותי ו וי\"ל שמוסיפין\nוהולכין בכל יום…</p>\n<p>ב. ועוד ראיה מדברי הראב”ן )בשו”ת שבריש הספר סי לה( שכתב לבאר הטעם\nשתקנו לברך להדליק נר חנוכה ולא על הדלקת נר חנוכה שהכלל בזה האם גומר את\nהמצוה מיד אחרי הברכה כמו נטילת לולב וכדו או שממשיך קצת בעשייה כמו הלל\nושופר וכל ברכה שהיא על מעשה שאינו בדבר אחד ואינו לפי שעה ולא נגמרה\nהמצוה באותה עשייה אינו מברך על כגון לישב בסוכה וכו וכן להדליק נר של\nחנוכה לפי שבכל הלילות לבד מלילה הראשון יש בו נרות להדליק ולא נגמרה\nהמצוה עד שמדליק כל הנרות להכי מברך להדלי ק דמשמע להדליק כל נר ונר ולא\nחילקו ברכת לילה הראשון משאר לילות וכן לשמוע בקול שופר שהוא חלוק לג\nסדרים ולא נגמרה המצוה עד לאחר כל הסדרים להכי מברך לשמוע בקול שופר של\nכל סדר וסדר</p>\n<p>A) We see in 'Arakhin 10 that we complete the recitation of Hallel on\nall of the days of Hanukah, and on Pesah we only complete on the first\nday(s), and Sukkoth we complete it all the days, and the reason for\nthe difference between Pesah and Sukkoth is that on Pesah the number\nof offerings are not distinct on each day, but on Sukkoth each day is\ndistinct with additional offerings... and Rashi explains in the Sefer\nha-Pardes that Hanukah is similar to a hag on which it is distinct in\nits additional offerings (חלוק בקרבנותיו) for each day and the gloss\nthere replaces  בקרבנותיו (its sacrifices) with בנרותיו (its lights),\nwhich is to say that there is added each day….</p>\n<p>B) Another proof is from the Raba”n (responsum at the beginning of the book s. 35). He wrote in explanation of the reason why the blessing was formulated “lehadliq ner Hanukah” (to light the Hanukah flame) and not “’al hadlaqath ner Hanukah” (on the lighting of the Hanukah flame). The principle of the matter hinges on whether the miswa is accomplished immediately after the blessing, such as with the taking of the lulabh or whether it continues a bit after the initial performance such as with Halle and shofar. Any blessing over an action that isn’t for one distinct thing nor for a distinct moment/time and that miswa isn’t complete with an immediate action one doesn’t bless “ ‘al” (on) such as “leshebh basukkah” (the blessing on dwelling in the sukkah), etc. And similarly as regards “lehadliq ner shel Hanukah”, since every night, with the exception of the first night, there are additional flames to light and the miswa is not complete until one has lit all of the flames. And so the blessing is “lehadliq” which connotes that one has to light each and every additional flame. And [in enacting the blessing] they did not differentiate the blessing for the first night from the rest of the nights. And so too “lishmo’a baqol shofar” which is split into three arrangements and the miswa is not complete until all of the arrangements are accomplished so we bless “lishmo’a qol shofar” [rather than a formulation with ‘al] to cover each and every component of the arrangement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first claim is that Rashi held that Hallel is completed throughout Hanukah as a reflection of the idea that we add each day (the Yomin de-Hanukah seems to implicitly be arguing that that wouldn't make sense if we were not obligated to add each night). And the second claim is that the manner with which the blessing is formulated (lehadliq rather than 'al) is indicative of a blessing that is recited over a miswa/action that is not immediately and swiftly completed but is rather of a continuous nature. Again the implicit argument being made is that this formulation would not make sense if the miswa was only to light one ner, rather than to light additional neroth each night. See the Yalqut Yosef inside for a fuller treatment.</p>\n<p>To summarize, you've got a great question - one that the Peri Megadim states requires investigation. We find that some have taken up the challenge. R. Gifter suggests that the Mehaber held that lighting additional flames each night became obligatory by virtue of its widespread acceptance. The Yomin de-Hanukah suggests that the Mehaber learned the Gemara as finding the mehadrin min ha-mehadrin position to in fact be the prescribed default position and finds possible allusion to it in how Rashi justifies Hallel throughout Hanukah and the language of the blessing on the neroth. How persuasive these explanations in fact are, I leave to others to determine. What is consistent among them is accepting that the Mehaber did indeed hold that lighting merely one ner (other than on the first night) is a defective way of lighting. How defective and whether there are mitigating circumstances under which may one may light merely one according to the Mehaber remains a separate but open question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# War after the miracle of oil?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One popular explanation for the name Chanukah is that on 25th of Kislev (כ\"ה) they had a respite of their enemies (חנו מאויביהם). (Actually I am not so sure about the first source of this either. A late source is in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.139.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</a>.)</p>\n<p>Now, is this claim true at all?

The miracle of oil is not mentioned in the Books of Maccabees or in Josephus Flavius. In the Gemara it does not relate not to the chronology neither the war.</p>\n<p>(In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillat_Antiochus.75?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillas Antiochus</a> it does relate the miracle to the end of the war, although, its historicity has been questioned.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>Was there a war after the miracle of the oil?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there was. The Book of Maccabees describes several battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucids. One of these was the Battle of Beit Tzur, which ended in a massive victory for the Jews. From there they went and conquered the Mikdash and set to purifying it (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Book_of_Maccabees_I.4.35-58?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maccabees 1:4:35-58</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Then said Judas and his brethren, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let us go up to cleanse and dedicate the sanctuary. Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, and went up into mount Sion. And when they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest, or in one of the mountains, yea, and the priests’ chambers pulled down; They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes upon their heads, And fell down flat to the ground upon their faces, and blew an alarm with the trumpets, and cried toward heaven. Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those that were in the fortress, until he had cleansed the sanctuary. So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as had pleasure in the law: Who cleansed the sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stones into an unclean place. [...]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This culminated in the celebration of Chanukah. The oil miracle isn't mentioned there but it obviously took place at that time.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, there were more battles. Besides further Maccabean conquests, there were also more battles against the Seleucids, such as the Battle of Beit Zechariah, which is where Elazar died (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/The_Book_of_Maccabees_I.6.34-54?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

In other words, during childbirth, is it natural and acceptable that he touches her for any assistance and becomes unclean for a day, or it would be very rare and only accidentally or unlikely that one may frown upon being unclean.

I am asking for historical Jewish practice, not the modern culture which wouldn't observe such rituals.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Most of the laws of ritual impurity don't make a difference today. People have gone to graveyards, but there's not Red Cow ash to purify them from that. Then again, there's no Temple nor sacrifices right now, so if someone's ritually impure, that doesn't really restrict much.</p>\n<p>The critical exception is that marital relations are prohibited during the <em>Nidah</em> period. That applies even if everyone is \"ritually impure\" anyhow because, for instance, they both touched dead lizards today. Or he's an undertaker. There are various verses about this in a few different places in the Bible, and a lot of detail is left to the tradition recorded in the Talmud. Thus, I'll refer you to Maimonides' code, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.4.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chapter 4 of Prohibited Relations</a>. (He consolidated the relevant laws in a very clear fashion.) The stuff about ritual impurity vis-a-vis the Temple appears in a different book of his.</p>\n<p>Let's grossly oversimplify and say that Nidah begins with the onset of menstrual bleeding. It then continues for five days or the cessation of bleeding, whichever is more; then requires seven clean days; then requires immersion in a Mikvah.</p>\n<p>Childbirth basically is treated the same as Nidah today; as bleeding usually can continue for several weeks, it means waiting several weeks for the cessation of bleeding, then seven clean days, then Mikvah.</p>\n<p>While a woman is in the state of Nidah, the issue with her husband touching her today has nothing to do with everything you're seeing in Leviticus. It's that once relations are prohibited, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/52940/what-is-the-source-of-shomer-negiah\">they should avoid touching</a> as a way of staying far away from prohibited behavior.</p>\n<p>Most Orthodox rabbis today therefore apply those laws directly, and would apply a blanket rule -- once labor starts, the woman is a <em>Nidah</em>, ergo her husband should not touch her until several weeks have passed, plus Mikvah. (And if he does, well ... just don't do it again!)</p>\n<p>(If we worried about the technical ritual impurity as you're seeing in Leviticus, then if she sat on a couch at 8am, then went to work, and he sat on the couch at 9am, he'd be \"impure\" ... again, today, not a problem.)</p>\n<p>One could attempt to argue that touch that's purely for emotional support, in a context where it won't lead to anything else, might be different ... but generally the Orthodox position is that a blanket rule was stated, as otherwise everyone would make their own exceptions, and slippery-slope their way from there.</p>\n\n\n",

Especially since Yehuda is already known to have failed in his commitment to his bride Tamar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.43.9?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.43.9.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachaye</a> it was a spiritual commitment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנכי אערבנו מידי תבקשנו וגו' וחטאתי לך כל הימים. <strong>בעוה\"ז, כלומר אהיה קרוי חוטא כל הימים להיות חלקי עם החוטאים, כגון גוזל אבותיו</strong> שנאמר (משלי כ״ח:כ״ד) גוזל אביו ואמו ואמר אין פשע.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>אנכי אערבנו מידי תבקשנו...וחטאתי לך כל הימים, “I will guarantee him, from me you can demand him;....or I will have sinned against you for all the days.” <strong>He meant that as long as he would live on earth he would consider himself as having sinned against his father</strong>. Solomon describes someone who steals from his parents as being a thief (although he stands to inherit his parents’ property) — compare <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.25.24?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 25:24</a>. Such a person is described there as a sinner against his parents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.43.9?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Radak_on_Genesis.43.9.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> helps to explain this further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחטאתי, אחשוב עצמי לפניך כחטא ומנודה כל הימים <strong>ומכאן למדו רז\"ל מנודה על תנאי אפילו מעצמו צריך הפרה</strong>, מנלן מיהודה דכתיב אם לא הביאותיו וגו' וכל ארבעים שנה היה עצמותיו מגולגלים בארון בעון זה עד שבקש משה עליהם רחמים, דכתיב וזאת ליהודה (דברים ל\"ג ו'):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>וחטאתי לך - Yehudah did not really man that if he did not bring Binyamin back this would automatically be a sin in the objective meaning of the word. He meant that he would consider himself as a sinner against his father forever in the unlikely event that this would happen. He would guarantee his brother’s return under such conditions. <strong>These considerations prompted our sages in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.11b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos 11b</a> to characterise Yehudah as placing himself in the position of a conditional outcast, מנודה, they derive the halachah that someone who places himself in such a state requires the court to annul his conditional vow, status.</strong> Needless to say, that ostracising oneself from the Jewish community even conditionally is forbidden, and we have a tradition that the bones inside Yehudah’s coffin were rattling for the entire 40 years the Jewish people carried the coffins of the 12 founding leaders of the tribes with them through the desert. This stopped only at the request of Moses who asked mercy for Yehudah in his final blessing in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.7?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 33:7</a>, וזאת 'ליהודה וגו</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a reason to use a shamash, beyond for light?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I always understood the purpose of the shamash to be to light the other, <em>mitzva</em> candles with; and that it used to be used as the candle that could be benefitted from. Seeing as the first purpose is completed after lighting, and the second is no longer applicable (because of electricity), I tend to put out my shamash after using it to light my candles, so I can reuse it the next day.</p>\n<p>Recently I was told that it's 'good' to leave the shamash lit, and that the fact that I won't need it for its light is irrelevant. Is there a source for this claim? (Beyond the claim that \"the lights might of out, and then you'll need the light of the shamash\". Let's pretend I won't even be in the room with the candles until they go out.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/05-12-11/#_te01ftn12_14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halacha</a> says that in a place which has electric light, one need not light a shamash. Even so, he says (similar to ElonMusk's comment on the question):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואע\"פ כן נהגו רבים להדליק שמש, כדי להבליט את ההבדל שבין נרות המצווה שאסור לנו להשתמש לאורם לנר השמש שמותר לנו להשתמש לאורו.</p>\n<p>And even so, many have the custom of lighting a shamash, in order to emphasize the difference between the mitzva candles, whose light is prohibited for use, and the shamash whose light is permitted for use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He brings the Bi'ur halacha (Orach Chaim 671:5 \"vetzarich\") as proof that even when not needed for light, there is importance to the differentiation between a mitzva candle and other light:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וצריך נר אחר להשתמש לאורה: פי' רש\"י משום היכרא ר\"ל אפילו אם לא ירצה כלל להשתמש לאורה מ\"מ צריך נר אחר שיהיה היכולת בידו להשתמש לאורה ועי\"ז מינכר שהנר הראשון הוא לשם מצווה דאל\"ה כיון שעומד על השולחן יאמרו שלצרכו הדליקה. ונראה דווקא במניחה על שולחנו אבל כל שמניחה סמוך לפתח א\"צ לנר אחרת אע\"פ שעומד לו לשם הואיל ואינו בא להשתמש לאורה לאיזה תשמיש. אכן מנהג העולם וכן מנהג רבותינו דבכל נר חנוכה המודלקת בתוך הבית צריך נר אחרת אפילו לא היה צריך לתשמיש שלא יאמרו לצרכו הדליקה וכן אני נוהג למעשה כ\"כ המאירי עי\"ש ועיין בפר\"מ שכן משמע ג\"כ מתשובת הרמ\"א.</p>\n<p>And he needs another candle to use as light: Rashi explained this to be as a recognition, meaning, even if he has no intent to use the candles' light, he still must have another candle so that he <em>could</em> use it for light, and through this  it becomes obvious that the first candle is for the mitzva. Because otherwise, since it's standing on the table, people will say he lit it for his own need. But this is seemingly only when it's on his table, but when it's near the entrance, he need not light another candle even though the candle is standing there [for his theoretical use], because he will not come to use this light for his own purposes. Indeed, the common practice, as well as our Rabbis' practice is that any Chanuka candle lit inside the house needs another candle, even if he won't need to use it, lest people say he lit it for his own needs, and this is my custom. Thus wrote the Meiri. And see the P'ri Megadim, that this is also seen in the ReM\"A's t'shuvos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>TL;DR: We see from this Bi'ur halacha that even when one won't use the light, there is a reason to light a shamash - to create a recognisable sign that this candle is for the mitzva. So we see, that although there is no obligation to light a shamash when there is another source of light (which is brought down in the Shulchan Aruch (671:5)), there is still a reason to, hence me being told that it's 'good to leave the shamash lit'.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>That was all what the peninei halacha said. However, if you ask me, nowadays there are already good enough signs that this candle is for the mitzva: 1. We're lighting a candle, even though we have electricity. 2. We're lighting it in a special candelabra. So it seems to me that even without a shamash, what the Bi'ur halacha said is no longer a concern. This is my own s'vara though, so I don't know how much it makes sense.</p>\n\n\n",

They are cited to teach that Hannah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You have created three crucibles potentially leading to death in a woman, where she is particularly vulnerable. Alternatively, some say: Master of the Universe, You have created three accelerants of death in a woman. They are mitzvot that, as a rule, pertain to women: Observing the halakhot of a menstruating woman, separating ḥalla from dough, and lighting Shabbat candles. Have I ever violated one of them? Hannah attests to her status as God’s maidservant [ama]. The reference to these three mitzvot is drawn from the etymological similarity between amatekha, your maidservant, and mita, death.

    "content": "# Marry an elderly woman\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Moses Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah, Sefer Nashim, Hilchot Ishut 15:7 states that:</p>\n<p>\"A man should not marry a barren women, an elderly woman, an aylonit or a minor who is not fit to bear a child\"</p>\n<p>Now, on what basis does Maimonides say that one cannot marry an elderly woman?\nThe Torah and Halakhah do not contain any prohibition in this regard.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You have cut off the quote half-way and this is not the way to learn Torah.</p>\n<p>The Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Marriage.15.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A man should not marry a barren women, an elderly woman, an aylonit or\na minor who is not fit to bear a child <strong>unless he has already fulfilled\nthe mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying, or he has another wife\nwith whom he can father children.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The latter half of the sentence answers your question since one primary goal of marriage is having children (a Torah commandment). As you see this Rambam is based on Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While the Rambam does not regularly list his sources, he bases himself on sources. The many commentaries on the Rambam do discuss his sources. A good approach could be to learn Mishneh Torah from a book with such commentaries, or on Sefaria, where you can click on a passage and then read what the commentaries have to say.</p>\n<p>In this case, I will skip the commentaries and instead show <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Marriage.15.7?lang=bi&p2=Rif_Yevamot.19b&lang2=bi&p3=Yevamot.61b.16&lang3=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam aligned with Rif on Yevamot and with Yevamot 61b</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QxOcG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QxOcG.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>See how each of his phrases match an idea in the Mishnah and gemara, and then while a slight logical leap may be involved, it is not as great a leap as you might think. Rambam's continuation  with שָׁהֲתָה עֶשֶׂר שָׁנִים וְלֹא יָלְדָה similarly matches Rif's highlight of points in the gemara.</p>\n<p>Also, as mblock wrote in his answer, you left out the end of the quote, \"unless he has already fulfilled the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying, or he has another wife with whom he can father children.\"</p>\n<p>The Mishnah there writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מַתְנִי׳ לֹא יִבָּטֵל אָדָם מִפְּרִיָּה וּרְבִיָּה אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן יֵשׁ לוֹ בָּנִים. בֵּית שַׁמַּאי אוֹמְרִים: שְׁנֵי זְכָרִים, וּבֵית הִלֵּל אוֹמְרִים: זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בְּרָאָם״.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MISHNA: A man may not neglect the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply unless he already has children. Beit Shammai say: One fulfills this mitzva with two males, and Beit Hillel say: A male and a female, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them” (Genesis 5:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See how the gemara takes it from there.</p>\n<p>So, if a man doesn't have a children yet, and will only be practically marrying one wife, if she is old he is effectively neglecting such a mitzvah.</p>\n<p>I understand from your posting an answer to your own question shortly thereafter that the question was likely placed so that you could establish your answer, about how other authorities disagree - though I am not sure that they do disagree. But yes, there are often several ways of interpreting underlying sources. Thus, there is a logical leap. But that doesn't mean that the Rambam stands with no basis in \"Torah and Halachah\".</p>\n<p>Also, I'm not sure your answer even contradicts what the Rambam wrote. When you cited Rabbi Touger that \"The Ramah (loc. cit.:5) and other authorities, however, differ and explain that as long as relations are carried out in an ordinary manner, having relations ... does not violate this prohibition.\", the preceding sentence was \"From the Shulchan Aruch (Even HaEzer 23:1), one can infer that sexual relations ... are considered as emitting wasted seed, one of the more severe prohibitions of the Torah.\" That is, the Rama is arguing with the inference made by Rav Yosef Karo in Shulchan Aruch (about spilling seed), not arguing with anything that the Rambam wrote in Hilchot Ishut (about that one shouldn't marry because he'll be thereby neglecting the precept of having children).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>Many authorities do not agree with many of its provisions.</p>\n<p>For example, on the issue of an aylonit, including a minor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952889/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-Fifteen.htm#footnote11a952889\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Touger, in commentary on Ishut 15:7 writes</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>«The Ramah and other authorities, however, differ and explain that as long as relations are carried out in an ordinary manner, having relations with a minor or an aylonit does not violate this prohibition.»</strong></p>\n<p>I think the same goes for an older woman.</p>\n<p>I quote <a href=\"https://books.google.it/books?id=ZWQ0iIOUnaUC&pg=PA68\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">David Michael Feldman, Birth Control in Jewish Law: Marital Relations, Contraception, and Abortion as Set Forth in the Classic Texts of Jewish Law, Jason Aronson, Lanham, 1998, p. 68</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>«For the halakhic tradition, the axiom was best formulated by Nimmukei Yosef, the early fifteenth-century Commentary to R. Isaac Al Fasi's Code:\n\"It follows from here and from all discussions elsewhere that inter-course with a woman incapable at all of child-bearing is permissible, and the prohibition of hash-hatat zera is not involved so long as the intercourse is in the manner of procreation; <em>for the Rabbis have in every case permitted marriage with women too young <em>or too old</em> for childbearing.</em> No prohibition is involved with a barren or sterile woman, except that the mitzvah of procreation is not thus being fulfilled.\"\nAnd so is it codified by Isserles in the Shulhan Arukh, in the very section in which hash-hatat zera is treated. But, since the Talmud and Codes not only permit but enjoin marriage upon every man, including those situations where childbearing is impossible,\" the permissibility of consciously non-procreative intercourse is taken for granted.»</strong></p>\n<p>I agree with him.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is food purchased by a Jew on Shabbos unkosher for later use like cooking in a kosher pot, eating on kosher plates, etc.?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a mind-bending question and I'm aware of the prohibition of giving advice that would encourage someone to violate halacha-but here's my reality. I'm a Jew and I have a kosher home. I am not shomer Shabbos but I have lived in a family and kept a shomer Shabbos life in the past primarily out of love and respect for my family and raised my step children in a Hasidish tradition. My personal beliefs don't require me to eat kosher something back then I would never have done in front of my children. But today I'm no longer married, my children are Hasidish but completely respectful of my beliefs as I am of theirs. It's of paramount importance that I have a home where my children, or any Jew at all, would be able to eat. I'm knowledgeable about the Halacha of kashrus and in my home, am as fastidious about maintaining kashrus under Halacha. So to the degree the answer might depend on whether a person who purchases an item on Shabbos knows that they are doing \"wrong\" it's not my belief that I'm doing \"wrong\" though I'm very aware that it violates halachica. I would never cook in my home on the Shabbos, for example. But if I bought a food item on Shabbos and cooked it in a kosher pot, considering my personal belief that it is not \"wrong?\" Would that food make the pot unkosher because it was bought on Shabbos?</p>\n<p>I am not trying to be cute or avoid complying with Halacha, quite the country. So where a Bet Din, under the Halacha of Dina DeMalchuta Dina, is required to apply domestic civil law to certain types of disputes rather than in theoretical Halachic law, I think that it may be Halachically proper for me to do as I understand as I don't believe I am committing a \"wrong\" and don't believe in the Halachic obligations as a traditional believer does. I need to add a bit more context. I've been a lawyer for 35 years. I have little doubt that the reason I became a lawyer is because of my Jewish upbringing which is so centered around the importance of having a system of law that provides justice. I attended a law school that is part of a Jewish university. I am a civil rights lawyer and feel that my fighting for the rights of people who have been wronged is very much an expression of my Jewishness. I also represented observant Jews in civil matters where the Belt Din has granted them the right to bring that case where the respondent refused the jurisdiction of the Beit Din. I also doubt that I could represent an observant Jew in a civil court case where they knowingly were avoiding the proper jurisdiction of the Beit Din because I could not represent someone who was knowingly disrespecting our system of justice which has existed to serve and protect us since time of the Second Temple.</p>\n<p>I know this will sound strange but I don't want to disrespect Halacha by following Halacha for reasons which--for me--would be hypocritical. Though I pose what I view as a complex question, my purpose in this question is simple in that I do not want to do anything that would effectively make my pots, plates etc unkosher because I purchased otherwise kosher food on the Sabbath. If doing so, within the context of the Dina DeMalchuta Dina legal system I where to, would tender my kitchen unkosher, snake to invite an observant Jew to eat it my home Halachically, I certainly will not do this.</p>\n<p>I know this is a Halachic nightmare and I mean no disrespect to the sincerely held beliefs of any reader by asking this question on a site like this. To be clear, I'm not suggesting anyone to disobey a halaha which they know and believe they are obligated to follow.\nI have taught in a yeshiva, I've taught Torah outside a Yeshiva also blending traditional and social science perspectives and told together in the same class. I continue to learn Torah. Being Jewish and learning Torah is very central to who I am and my neshama and my connection to the ein sof as I personally understand that spiritual concept. But I also view myself as a modern scientific thinker.  I very much view our civilization and our laws also from an outside perspective with social science tools. I know this is a conundrum but I feel it would be hypocritical for me to act based on beliefs I don't personally hold. Here I hold the belief in Who we are and that I am personally, spiritually and humanistically, but not risk religiously, compelled to keep a home that any Jew in the world can have dinner at. This is sometimes a painful and challenging place for me to live emotionally and I can guess you will tell me to consult my rabbi -- but as you can see this is essentially a purely objective halachic question that requires a halachically objective answer--if one can exist based on the framework of this question. Thank you so very much.</p>\n\n\n",

And apparently the sentence is puzzling, why would the woman who is not the baby's mother agree to kill him? Is she so wicked that she is willing to kill an innocent baby? Would Yehudia agree to such a thing? And moreover, in light of this, it is clear to the two women that King Shlomo would not kill an innocent baby. If so how did this alleged threat make a woman who is not the mother agree? And finally, the people applauded Solomon's wisdom in this sentence. Is this proof of Solomon's righteous judgment? Is this thing that one of the women accidentally confessed due to her wickedness a proof of Shlomo's righteousness? Were there not other sentences that showed his wisdom more than this case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Meiri (Yevamos 17b) gives a fascinating explanation of the case and of Shlomo's insight:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והוא הענין שנאמר בהגדה על אותן שתים נשים זונות שבאו לדין לפני שלמה שהרי כשצוה שלמה לגזור את הילד החי והשיבה האחת תנו לה את הילוד החי והמת אל תמיתוהו היה ראוי לאחרת להשיב את שלי היא נותנת לי וכשאמרה גם לי גם לך גו' סכלות היה ופתיות שלה ומה היה מכיר שלמה בדבר זה ומה תועלת היה רואה לה בדבריה אלא ששתי נשים אלו כלה וחמותה היו ומתו בעליהן בלא בנים אחרים אלא אלו השנים ומת ילד זה של הכלה וכל שמת תוך שלשים נדון כנפל והרי היא זקוקה ליבום וכשמצאה עצמה צריכה להמתין לאותו ולד של חמותה ותתעגן י\"ג שנים החליפה חי במת כדי לומר שבנה הוא ותפטר משני צדדין שהרי תאמר שיש לה בן ואין לה יבם וכשאמר שלמה גזרו את הילד החי שמחה מפני שנוח היה לה בכך כדי לינשא בהיתר והרגיש שלמה בענין זה והשאירו לחמותה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Previously he's explained the point that yibbum applies only if the deceased's brother was born before (even a moment before) his older brother's death.]</p>\n<p>This explains what is told about the two <em>zonos</em> women who came to Shlomo for judgment. When Shlomo ordered the live child to be cut in two, and one said \"Give her the living one, but don't kill him,\" shouldn't the other one have answered, \"[Of course,] she's just giving me mine\"? When she said \"Neither mine nor yours,\" wasn't that foolish and stupid of her? What was Shlomo's insight here, and what benefit did he perceive her to be [trying to] get with her words?</p>\n<p>Rather, these two women were a daughter-in-law and a mother-in-law, both of whose husbands had died, leaving no other children besides these two. The daughter-in-law's son died; having died within thirty days [of birth], he is considered a stillbirth, and so she [the DIL] would require yibbum. Finding herself having to wait on her MIL's baby, where she would be in limbo for 13 years [until said baby would be old enough to perform yibbum], she exchanged the live baby with the dead one, to claim that it's her son and that thus she should be doubly exempt [from yibbum], saying that she has a son and no brother-in-law. When Shlomo ordered the live baby cut in half, she was happy, since that would make it easier for her to be allowed to remarry. Shlomo realized this, and assigned the baby to her MIL.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>I have a \"fan theory\" about this. The story of the two women is used as the example of Solomon's wisdom because it represents his ascent to power and his undoing.</p>\n<p>Shlomo becomes king, but feels shaky on his throne so initiates a dynastic marriage with Egypt. God reassures him and tells that he will be with Shlomo is Shlomo follows his ways. Shlomo accepts and God grants him wisdom.</p>\n<p>\"Then come two women, prostitutes, to the king\". Or is it \"Then come two women, prostitutes to the king\"? These women have slept with the Shlomo and the child is actually his. Shlomo reasons that the true mother would never split the baby.</p>\n<p>The child is Jerobam, whose mother was a cleaning woman, and widow,  in the palace. Both his presumed parents have names that have a meaning relating to seeds because Jerobam is planted and lays dormant until he comes out into the story. He is described as an Efrathaite, which has a double meaning: Ephraimite or someone from the King David family. Note: Jerobam is anointed by a real prophet. Yet the scepter must not pass from David. He thus must be a son of David.</p>\n<p>Then Shlomo marries a bunch of other women, who worship idols an get him worshiping idols. One of these women is Naamah the Ammonite. The principal god of Ammon is Molech. And Shlomo worships Molech and builds an alter to him. Molech is the worst god to worship: there is a standalone mitzva about it.</p>\n<p>God then decides to take away Shlomo's gift of wisdom and security. Naamah's son is Rehobam, who behaves in colossally stupid way, resulting in the kingdom being split. God is the owner of the Jewish people and he decreed it be split. The reasoning of the initial judgment is thus proven wrong. The gift of wisdom and the integrity of the kingdom are given and removed with the same instrument: Jerobam.</p>\n\n\n",

Eisav represents betrayal of the Jewish cause, but not necessarily an enemy. A domesticated ox represents the one who works on his character, a wild ox does not. Yosef is a prototypical Jewish leader in Exile who helps leading his brothers with observance of mitzvos. Rabbi Moshe Eisenmann developed this idea in his book \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B000AV4OOW\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Riddle of the Bowing Moon: Reflections on Yosef Hatzadik & the Dreams That Set Our History in Motion</a>\". There is also a midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.99.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 99:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Joseph opposite the kingdom of Edom – this one has horns, and that one has horns. This one has horns – “the firstborn bull is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17); and that one has horns – “and concerning the ten horns that were on its head” (Daniel 7:20). This one forsook licentiousness, and that one cleaves to licentiousness. This one was scrupulous regarding his father’s honor, and that one demeaned his father’s honor. [Joseph heeded his father and went to check on his brothers even though he knew they hated him] (Genesis 37:13–14). The nation of Edom descends from Esau, who said: “The days of mourning for my father will approach, and I will kill my brother Jacob” (Genesis 27:41). Thus, Esau was looking forward to his father dying so that he could kill Jacob.  Of this one it is stated: “I fear God” (Genesis 42:18); of that one it is stated: “And he did not fear God” (Deuteronomy 25:18). Into whose hands will the kingdom [of Edom] fall? Into the hands of the one anointed for war, who comes from Joseph. [The messiah, son of Joseph.]  Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: There is a tradition that Esau will fall only into the hands of Rachel’s descendants. That is what is written: “[Therefore, hear the schemes of the Lord that He has devised against Edom…] will the young of the flock not drag them?” (Jeremiah 49:20). Why does he call them the young of the flock? Because they are the youngest of the tribes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Binyamin is described as a wolf (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.27?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 49:27</a>) and naturally he is the main force in the fight against Amalek who is compared to a dog (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.17.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Shemos 17:8</a> quoting Midrash Tanchuma Yisro 3).

On the first they <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.42.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">said</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Alas, we are being punished on account of our brother, because we\nlooked on at his anguish, yet paid no heed as he pleaded with us. That\nis why this distress has come upon us.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the third they <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.44.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">said</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Judah replied, “What can we say to my lord? How can we plead, how can\nwe prove our innocence? God has uncovered the crime of your servants.\nHere we are, then, slaves of my lord, the rest of us as much as he in\nwhose possession the goblet was found.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So for each of those, they had a very clear interpretation of what they had done wrong - not listening to their brother's cries, selling him as a slave - that led to Hashem sending them this suffering.</p>\n<p>But the one in the middle, the silver in the saddle bags, is perplexing. They know it's from Hashem, but they <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.42.28?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">don't understand</a> it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As one of them was opening his sack to give feed to his ass at the\nnight encampment, he saw his money right there at the mouth of his\nbag.   And he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned! It is\nhere in my bag!” Their hearts sank; and, trembling, they turned to one\nanother, saying, <em>“What is this that God has done to us?”</em>... [and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.42.35?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">later</a>]:<br />\nAs they\nwere emptying their sacks, there, in each one’s sack, was his\nmoney-bag! When they and their father saw their money-bags, they were\ndismayed... [and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.43.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">later]</a>:<br />\nBut the men were frightened at being brought into Joseph’s house. “It\nmust be,” they thought, “because of the money replaced in our bags the\nfirst time that we have been brought inside, as a pretext to attack us\nand seize us as slaves, with our pack animals.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the Viceroy never brings it up at all! [His servant] <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.43.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brushes it aside completely</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He replied, “All is well with you; do not be afraid. Your God, the God\nof your father’s [house], must have put treasure in your bags for you.\nI got your payment.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I understand that Yosef was messing with them - very effectively! - but is there someone who explains more about the point of the second time he scares them?</p>\n\n\n",

Also, there were multiple methods of encoding numbers with letter-based simanim.</p>\n<p>To add to the complications is that while the current Arabic-based system of writing numbers (0..9) includes the concept of zeroes as placeholders, letter-based <em>simanim</em> lack that.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is that whatever counts were used in the Mikraos Gedolos of 1525 could have altogether been based on a different method for counting words which is currently unknown to us.</p>\n\n\n",

(V'Yikra 20:23)וְלֹ֤א תֵֽלְכוּ֙ בְּחֻקֹּ֣ת הַגּ֔וֹי  People frequently say \"non-jews drive cars and wear pants so by that logic yo:u should  prohibit them as well\"</p>\n<p>The Rishonim  give the following distinction for what is(n't) considered chukas hakum. Something that non-Jews innovated or do for  practical reasons is not considered chukas hakum. Something that non-Jews do or enjoy for <em>cultural</em> reasons   is considered  chukas hakum. Having seen and heard this topic discussed by Rabbis ranging from Satmar to YU they all seemed to accept this distinction. The only question is it's practical application. In Satmar there are far more things that they  consider to be   cultural rather than practical  than they do in YU so there are far  more things Satmar  opposes   for such reasons (including playing ball in the US) than they do in YU. Both agree however that imitating non-Jewish culture is an halachic problem</p>\n<p>Getting back to  the original  question if playing ball is perceived as a part of Zionist culture than there would be a reason to prohibit it. There is nothing cultural about wanting to getting places quickly and on time. It is a universally high demand practical issue. Therefore no one  opposes cars even if Zionists are into them.</p>\n<p>Note: The halachos of chukas hakum are far more complicated than written above. It's not just one simple distinction.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Some chareidim are of the opinion that playing ball distracts from avodat Hashem, i.e. spiritual pursuits, or learning. Because it is deemed a \"frivolous\" activity. Some might also deem it not tzniout. Additionally, as this rabbi said, there is a cultural issue which they wish to distance themselves from. That being, that they put an emphasis on separating themselves from secular culture and focusing on spiritual pursuits. Recreational activities like playing ball may be seen as too secular or worldly, and therefore discouraged. There is no codified halacha; it's a sensitivity held towards judaism that they feel is correct.</p>\n\n\n",

Quoted below.</p>\n<p>Question though… <em>why</em> did Gabriel need to interfere?

It was the priests that made the suggestion to examine\nJoseph’s torn garment, which his mistress had submitted as evidence of\nhis guilt, and see whether the rent was in front or in back.

But if you don’t wear tzitzit one day, you simply don’t have that merit on that day.</p>\n<p>But if you wear a four cornered garment without tzitzit during the day, you violate the obligation.</p>\n<p>With additional reflection, is this possibly something only incumbent on the Tzibbur? If so, it would explain the possible difference between individual and communal obligation.</p>\n<p>I think of this in the context of a Jewish King who represents the whole community. המלך הוא לב כל העם</p>\n<p>If the Sanhedrin hears a criminal case and cannot reach consensus, they have the option of referring the matter to the King.

Yet, I thought gentiles are NOT allowed to learn Torah. Is the prohibition only in effect if a gentile is learning on their own?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the Talmud, Rabbi Meir said that a Gentile who studies the Torah is like a High Priest, because the Torah says: \"וּשְׁמַרְתֶּ֤ם אֶת־חֻקֹּתַי֙ וְאֶת־מִשְׁפָּטַ֔י אֲשֶׁ֨ר יַעֲשֶׂ֥ה אֹתָ֛ם הָאָדָ֖ם וָחַ֣י בָּהֶ֑ם --\nKeep my statutes and my judgments, for the man who obeys them will live by them.\"  [Lev. 18:5]. He adds: It does not say “Priest, Levite, or Israelite”, but <em>adam</em> -- “man”.  So we learn that even a Gentile who studies the Torah is like a High Priest!   But another rabbi countered that Gentiles should study only the parts of the Torah that pertain to their own seven Noahide laws, and not the rest. [Sanhedrin 59a, Bava Kamma 38a]  The latter became the rule.</p>\n\n\n",

So no worries of \"make no 3d image of things above the heavens\" etc.  Flat paintings and flat images, no problem because the verse says \"no graven image.\"</p>\n<p>Now what about a hologram, made of light? There's no engraving so I think that would be permitted. If it's not a deity someone would bow to or make an offering to then you have at most a Safek d'Rabbanan if there is any gzera but holograms didn't exist for Chazal therefore you have what to rely on.

But in Pumbedita they would eat udders. Rami bar Tamrei, who is also called Rami bar Dikulei, from Pumbedita, arrived in Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur. Since it is a mitzva to eat and drink then, large quantities of meat were cooked, and everyone brought out their udders from the animals they had slaughtered and threw them away. Rami bar Tamrei went and gathered the udders, roasted them, and ate them, in accordance with his custom. The residents of Sura brought Rami bar Tamrei before Rav Ḥisda, who said to him: Why did you do this? Rami bar Tamrei said to Rav Ḥisda: I am from the place of Rav Yehuda, who eats udders, and this is the accepted custom in Pumbedita. Rav Ḥisda said to him: And do you not hold by the principle that the Sages impose upon a traveler the stringencies of the place that he left and also the stringencies of the place to which he went? You should have accepted the stringency of Sura and not eaten the udders. Rami bar Tamrei said to Rav Ḥisda: That principle applies only to one who remains in the place he is visiting, but I ate the udders outside the boundaries of Sura.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The implication of the story is the rule you cite applies when one is in the same תחום (roughly 2000 cubits from the last house in the city).</p>\n\n\n",

There are also halachic cases in which mental disability may exempt someone from this mitzvah. How do these halachos apply to Jewish men with Asperger's Syndrome (mild autism)? What about moderate/severe autism? What is the definition of disability in this part of Halakha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There are a few different things going on here. If someone isn't obligated in the mitzvah, then they won't be held to task for not doing it!</p>\n<p>In severe cases of autism (as stated in the other answer), it could well be argued that the fellow is \"insane\" and therefore not obligated in any mitzvah.</p>\n<p>There could certainly be cases whereby someone has sufficient mental competence to work a cash register, for instance, but is in no position to have close relationships. There is a category called \"insane vis-a-vis certain aspects\" (<em>shoteh ledavar echad</em>); they are obligated in whatever mitzvos their psyche can support.</p>\n<p>There's been an argument made that if someone is so unsuited for marriage that it would make them more miserable than losing a huge amount of money, then again they wouldn't be obligated -- just as I'm not required to buy a lulav if it would bankrupt me. That may be the case for some cases of spectrum disorder, according to some rabbis.</p>\n<p>For cases milder than that, someone would still be obligated to do their best to find someone compatible.</p>\n<p>It's very hard to define these different levels; Maimonides' Code, upon trying to define \"insane\" vs. \"partially insane\" vs. \"developmentally challenged\", concludes with -- \"you have to see each person yourself and make an individual determination.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is no outright prohibition for someone on the spectrum from getting married, as even a deaf-mute is allowed to get married (Rabbinic marriage, rather than Biblical, see Shulchan Aruch EH 44:1, 67:8), although one should consult with a Rabbi, especially for stronger cases of autism.</p>\n\n\n",

Obviously this cannot be muttar while a highly ethical value-based theater play assur.</p>\n<p>Are there any traditional Jewish sources which explain the depth of this issue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p><strong>Letzim</strong> - scorners - also connotes forces of impurity, so perhaps Chazal felt that these forces can project out or come about by partaking in Greek culture and art and render people tamei or harm them or just be bad influences in general. Here is T. Zohar 27:2 referring to forces of impurity and people of the Erev Rav, in commenting on the letzim in Psalm 1:1:</p>\n<p>\"Who merits to ascend there, who did not walk in the counsel of the wicked, for she (it) is evil counsel from the side of the Tree of Knowledge that is good mixed with bad.  'And in the <strong>seat of scoffers</strong>, he did not sit.' <strong>Who is the seat of scoffers? This is Lilith, the mother of the Erev Rav, for she contaminates like a menstruated woman by her sitting; so too do the Erev Rav contaminate by their sitting, the righteous who sit among them, as doth a niddah.\"</strong></p>\n<p>מאן זכי לאעלא תמן, אשר לא הלך בעצת רשעים, דאיהי עצה בישא מסטרא דעץ הדעת טוב ורע, ובדרך חטאים לא עמד, מאן דרך חטאים ההיא דאתמר בה כן דרך אשה מנאפת, אכלה ומחתה פיה וגומר, ובמושב לצים לא ישב, מאן מושב לצים, דא לילי\"ת אימן דערב רב, דאיהי מטמאה כנדה במושבה, וכן ערב רב מטמאין במושבם לצדיקיא דיתבין בינייהו כנדה:</p>\n<p><strong>Leitzim also refers to \"demonic tricksters\"</strong> for example in Rabbi Nachman's Sipurei Maasiyot (Story Tales) - Appendix of additional stories, story \"Plompf\":</p>\n<p>[The Pump]</p>\n<p>Regarding the discussion which [some of Rebbe Nachman's chassidim] were having about someone who was then in one of the large non-Jewish cities and tarried there a long time because each time he imagined that now he would succeed: and so it was each time, until he was delayed there a long time. And he [the Rebbe] said that that is the way it goes when one comes to such places, that each time it seems to him, \"Now I will accomplish, now I will accomplish,\" etc., etc. And he told this story:</p>\n<p>There was one man who did not believe <strong>what the world says, that there are leitzim/tricksters from the Sitra Achra/ Other Side that come sometimes to mislead people, as has happened several times</strong>; he did not believe this. One night, a <strong>leitz</strong> came to him and called him to go outside. He went out and the <strong>leitz</strong> showed him that he had a beautiful horse to sell. He looked and indeed it was a very beautiful horse, so he asked him, \"How much do you want?\" Answered the <strong>leitz</strong>, \"Four adumim/rubles.\" He saw that it was easily worth eight rubles, for it was a choice, fine horse. So he bought the horse from him for four rubles and he considered it a great find. The next day, he took the horse out to sell, and people stepped up to purchase and wanted to give him some amount. He said, \"Probably, if they are willing to give me so much, it must be worth double!\" So he was not satisfied and he took the horse onward, and they wanted to give him twice his desire. He said, \"It is probably worth more than double this amount.\" So he brought the horse onward, until the price of the horse reached into the thousands. However, he was not satisfied with any of them to sell it, for whatever they wanted to give him, he said, \"It is probably worth twice as much.\" Eventually, there was no one who could buy it except the king.</p>\n<p>So he brought it to the king, and the king wanted to give him an astounding amount, for the horse was exceedingly pleasing to everyone. However, he was not willing with the king either, for he said, \"It is probably worth more.\" Thus, even the king was unable to buy the horse. So he went from the king with the horse to water it. There was a <em>plomf</em>/pump there from which people take water. <strong>The horse jumped into the pump, disappeared and was no more. (That is, it appeared to him as such, for the entire incident of the horse was made up by the leitz)</strong>. He yelled out loud over this, and people gathered around in response to his screaming and asked him, \"Why are you screaming?\" He replied that his horse had jumped into the pump. And they beat him [with] injurious blows, for he appeared insane since the <strong>opening of the pump is very narrow, and how can a horse jump into it?</strong> He saw that they were beating him and that he appeared insane, and he wanted to go from there. As he wanted to leave, <strong>the horse began to stick its head out of the pump.</strong> So he began to scream again, \"Aha, aha (look, look)!\" since it appeared to him that his horse was there. The people gathered around and beat him again, since he was insane, as mentioned. Again he decided to leave; and as soon as he wanted to go, <strong>the horse again stuck its head out of the pump.</strong> He began shouting again as before and the people gathered upon him again and beat him.</p>\n<p><strong>Thus the Sitra Achra deceives a man each time with nothingness; complete lies having no substance.</strong> And he is incited by it, pursues it, and each time it appears to him that he will profit more and that he will fill his craving more. So he runs after it many times, and suddenly all his desires vanish, get away and go away from him — as has happened many times, that the cravings go away a little, and when the man wants to detach from them, then they come back and stick out their heads and he goes back to chasing them. And so it continues, that as soon as they stick out their heads, he goes back to chasing them. (And he explained the matter no further. Understand this well.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As an eitzah, advice, though you didn't ask for one, I might offer a piece from Likutei Etzot, section \"Prayer\":</p>\n<ol start=\"71\">\n<li>Through prayer, one can change nature, subdue, and nullify heretics and Epicureans.

So is there a historic man Moriah for example in the Talmud or other Jewish texts, and if no, could it be a man's name and if not why not. The root Mar, bitter or \"to change something\" is male. And the bitterness does not seem to be an answer because we see Moshe Rabbeinu named his son Gershon (expulsion, or stranger). Also the close root Mar has positive meanings like master, teacher. And again the root מור like the sap, myrhh, is male. Also just a mountain, Har, is male and even signifies the Avot as in, \"I lift up mine eyes to the Mountains\" and the commentators say: the Patriarchs Abraham etc.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to decide where the development of Torah stops being useful\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've met so many people who have a different opinion on this than the one I was raised with. We all probably get it from our chinuch, but it seems there are quite a lot of opinions. I'll list what I've come across:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Any ideas<sup>*</sup> outside of Tanach itself are innovations that are subject to being treated as not-necessarily reliable<sup>**</sup>.</li>\n<li>Mishna and Talmud are the last sources of authentic Torah development. Everything that comes after is distracting and unreliable, especially if it is anything other than a commentary or compilation on Tanach or Talmud.</li>\n<li>The Rishonim were the last reliable transmitters of the Oral Tradition, and/or holy tzaddikim able to innovate authentic Torah ideas. Everything afterwards is rather distracting and unreliable.</li>\n<li>The classic works of the Acharonim are the last bastions of authentic Torah thought and development/revelation; the last true \"fundamentals\". Since then, we've had lots of distracting development of ideas that need to be taken with much discretion.</li>\n<li>The Torah is in permanent development in an unbroken chain of leaders and tzaddikim, and all Torah from such sources is holy, Torah Emet, and good to learn (and describing it as unreliable is basically heretical). The later stuff in some ways is more important because it is the most developed and honing in on an \"end goal\" of full explanation and revelation of Hashem's Torah.</li>\n<li>None of the above, they have an itemised list of what is reliable, and what is not, based on other factors like history and politics. Under here would likely fall common opinions like \"anything other than halacha is unreliable\" and things like litvish vs chassidus, kabbalah vs philosophy etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have come across shomer mitzvot people who hold by each of the above, and everything in between (e.g. \"I generally hold by 5, but since [this Rebbe/Tzaddik] nothing new or reliable has come\" or \"I hold by 3, that these Rishonim are good, but these other Rishonim are unreliable\").</p>\n<p>Of course, there is likely truth in all of the above, but the way it becomes an ideology is what drives my question. People will argue with eachother that they are learning the \"best and most reliable\" Torah, and those who learn the other stuff are \"learning unreliable, distracting ideas and are getting fundamentals wrong\". There are others that are parev and say \"I'll stick to mine, and you can stick to yours, whatever works for you\". And again, everything in between.</p>\n<p>This is such a mess. My question is, do we have any hope of finding a fact based answer to help us with this?</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A universally acceptable source that says that there will definitely be a decline in Torah development, and the focus should be on prioritising the earlier stuff, and ideally avoiding, or taking with a grain of salt the later stuff.</li>\n<li>A universally acceptable source that says that Torah development is always ongoing and holy and it is important to keep up with it and treat it all as Torah Emet.</li>\n<li>Proof that there is no such source, and therefore it is up to us to try and figure out what Torah development stage is reliable, and to what degree etc. (and that we should trust whoever in where this line is drawn, and not trust the others who say otherwise etc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would be best if such proofs are not biased, like \"I only learn up to the Rishonim because this Rishon said so\" or \"I learn right up until Chabad maamarim because the Rebbe said\". Proofs from logic or experience should also be best avoided.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* Keeping \"ideas\" general, although <em>hashkafa</em> seems to be the biggest source of the differences, so that's the bigger part of what I am looking for.<br />\n** What I mean by \"reliable\" is \"untainted with falsehood\". Some of the positions above might themselves not define it quite like that, but it will be similar such as \"untainted with degredation\" or \"universally valuable, as opposed to valuable only for certain people, but distracting to everyone else\". It is for this reason the title just uses the more wholesale \"useful\".</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam's Introduction to the Yad</a> is the long answer to this question and his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to the Mishna</a> is the even longer answer.

Yet, any Torah idea that anyone will\never think of was already given to Moshe at Sinai, and the Mishnah\nsays, \"Who is wise? One who learns from everyone, and whenever anyone\nlearns together, they always discover new Torah ideas. The Gaon\nRabbeinu Yosef Haim (Responsa Rav Paalim vol. I, introduction) writes:\n<strong>There are Rabbis who in writing their halachic works, do not pore over the\nwritings of later halachic authorities. Instead they look only at the\nearlier works and then write what seems good in their eyes based on\ntheir own understanding and their own judgment... but what they do is\nnot good, for there is a rule, \"Torah knowledge can only be acquired\nthrough discussions with one's peers.\"</strong> Furthermore, the Mishnah says,\n\"Who is wise? One who learns from everyone.\" We find always that the\ngreater scholars have a need for the less experienced ones, as the\nGemara says (Taanit 7a), \"And from my students I learned the most of\nall.\" Rabbi Yohanan would eagerly await his student's questions\nbecause through them, he gained a greater understanding (sec Baba\nMerziah, 84a), Therefore, even if a person is an outstanding Torah\nscholar, why should he not seek to know what the later scholars have\nwritten - whether they write their own ideas, or whether they have\nseen fit to compile the sayings of earlier Sages regarding the same\nsubject? Perhaps, by seeing what they have written, a person may\ndiscover something new.

This contradicts\nthe previous Midrash (ibid 1:1:10), where Chazal state that Ruach\nHakodesh rested on Shlomo and he said 3 sefarim: Shir HaShirim,\nMishlei and Kohelet. If you say that they once knew it and it was\nforgotten, and he remembered it with Ruach Hakodesh, how can it be\nattributed to Shlomo? Antiel Ben Kanaz brought back many [forgotten]\nhalachot through incredible pilpullim and they are not attributed to\nhim! Note that the phrase is \"אשר לשלמה\", it doesn't say \"שיר השירים\nלשלמה\", like we say \"שיר המעלות לשלמה\". It's like I wrote in my\ncommentary on Mishlei (22:17), I explain a Midrash (Tanchuma)\nwhere Hashem is quoted saying \"Eliezer my son states that the calf\nmust be a year old...\". Isn't that strange? Hashem is expounding His\nown Torah, basing His own words on the way some mortal will understand\nthem born several generations in the future! <strong>As we  explained there,\nin Hashem's kindness, each Jewish soul has a portion in the Torah to\nwhich he can relate, and in that area he can make a chiddush to the\nworld, and in each generation chiddushim are conceived by Torah\nscholars who are able to understand them in a way that was not\npreviously understood and Hashem Himself will not state those\nchiddushim without mentioning the name of the one who will introduce\nit to the world</strong>, as we see in this case of Rabbi Eliezer where Hashem\nquoted this halacha in his name way before his time. Similarly, Hashem\nor the ministering angels may have sung Shir HaShirim many generations\nbefore Shlomo, yet still it begins with \"שיר השירים אשר לשלמה\", i.e.\n\"Shir HaShirim which was apportioned to the soul of Shlomo\". In the\ncase of R' Eliezer, the halacha was already in his soul at Sinai, and\nsimilarly with Shir HaShirim, it belonged to Shlomo's soul even before\nhe lived and hence it is attributed to him and given his name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that this isn't just referring to halacha, but any Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://heichalhanegina.blogspot.com/2007/01/rav-baal-hatanya-and-napoleons-march.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the assistance of the Russian army, the Rebbe and his entire family began their flight, loaded on four wagons, on Erev Shabbos, 22 Av, 5572 (1812). Before leaving, he instructed the townspeople to help themselves to his furniture and utensils and to make sure to remove everything that was in his house. After traveling approximately two miles, the Alter Rebbe asked the commander for a fast carriage and horses. Together with two attendants, he returned to Liadi and instructed them to search the house for anything that might have been left behind. After a thorough search, they found a pair of worn-out slippers, a sieve, and a rolling pin in the attic. Not wanting Napoleon to obtain any memorabilia from him, the Alter Rebbe took these objects with him. Chassidim insist that the Alter Rebbe thought that Napoleon was a sorcerer, and if he would have gotten hold of anything that belonged to the Alter Rebbe, he would have used it to guarantee his victory (or in the least, to mitigate against the Alter Rebbe's ability to oppose him). Then he told his attendants to set fire to the house, and they left.</p>\n<p>This was not a second too early, as immediately afterwards, Napoleon's soldiers entered the city from the opposite direction. Despite their utmost efforts, they were unsuccessful in putting out the fire. All that was left of the Rebbe's house were smoldering ashes. In Napoleon's name, the French soldiers proclaimed that anyone who would give them something that had belonged to the Alter Rebbe would be richly rewarded with gold coins. Obeying the Alter Rebbe's wishes, no one gave them anything. In their anger, the French soldiers burned down the shul that was adjacent to the Alter Rebbe's former house. The Alter Rebbe had foreseen this, and before leaving had instructed the townspeople of Liadi to remove everything from the shul before Napoleon's arrival there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I cannot answer the question directly but Napoleon was primarily good for Jews in that he continued the emancipation of Jews which gave them citizenship in France and in Concord French territories emancipated Jews. He removed laws that required them to live in ghettos. He had assimilationist beliefs but that was not something he had only to Jews. They were free to join military service completely equal to any other group. Ironically, had Napoleon not lived, there never would have been a Dreyfus affair years after his death because a Jew like Dreyfus who attained the high rank of Captain in the French army never would have been able to attain such a level of service as a Jew but for Napoleon's egalitarian beliefs. Napoleon also revolutionized Europe in many ways which affected Jews. He created the French civil service which became a model for civil service throughout Europe and the world where people join a government entity and raise to the level of their merit. This was a general belief that enabled all people to realize the potential and in as much as Jews could not do that in countries where they were excluded from various practice one way or the other, his commitment to believing that a country is most effective when it runs on merit is something that helped the Jews to a large degree. Before this era, Jews were largely forbidden in many countries to own land or to participate in many businesses or guilts. This is why many Jews became money lenders and bankers and Napoleon did try to and the practice of Jews as money lenders. Whatever his motive, it's clear that he did not like individual groups to live in their own niches.  He had no problem with religious practices and under his ring Judaism was recognized as an official religion within france. No Jew had fear under the authority of Napoleon for being Jewish as they had had in France before the revolution and in many other countries throughout Europe.</p>\n\n\n",

Since a murderer is only liable for the punishment of 'sayif' beheading, while a violator of Shabbos is liable to 'sekila' or Kares.\nThis is obvious from the gemara in yevamos that says that since a wicked person shouldn't be buried near a righteous one, separate cemeteries were necessary for criminals killed by the courts, and since someone killed by the relatively lenient punishment of 'sayif', is righteous compared to someone who was liable for 'sekila', there were cemeteries for each level of sinners.</p>\n<p>The same applies to eating just an olives worth of specific types of fat of animals, chametz on Pesach or infractions of niddah.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Does everyone agree with Chazon Ish? To me it seems the reality is as he claims, since we are repulsed by people who kill, rape and steal but we do not feel that way towards upstanding people who have gone OTD. In addition, very few orthodox people are fluent in all the myriad detailed laws of Shabbos. Furthermore, in the yeshivas there is no serious focus on halacha even the halachos that involve sekilah or kares such as shabbos. Now if they would truly beleive its importance, surely there would be emphasis on it. But in truth the opposite is true. Learining any Halacha is subtly disparaged.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>From a theological perspective, since these ideas are so difficult to believe, how can we be held accountable for them, and all the more so with such severe punishments.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>According to Chazon Ish, the average person is a quasi-heretic since they don't fully believe the consequences of these actions.

That is to say, to mock that particular god.<br />\nFor example, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Heqet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">heqet</a>, the goddess of fertility, who had the head of a frog, corresponded to the plague of frogs [tzef'ardeya].</p>\n<p>Is this belief discussed by any meforash, or held by Judaism ?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>UPDATE</p>\n<p>After posing this question to <a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/99556/64281\">Christianity.se</a>, it seems that it is a Christian concept.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There are modern rabbis who have suggested this, likely following in the footsteps of academic biblical scholarship which holds this idea. I assume you're asking for classical sources on the subject. As @shmosel wrote in the comments, this is stated specifically regarding the Nile. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shemot_Rabbah.9.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot Rabbah 9:9</a> it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"“On the water that is in the Nile, and it will be turned into blood” – why was the water afflicted first with blood? It is because Pharaoh and the Egyptians worshipped the Nile. The Holy One blessed be He said: I will smite the god first and then his people. This is a folk parable: Smite the gods and the priests will be afraid. Likewise it says: “The Lord will reckon with the host of the high heavens on high,” and after that, [“the kings of the earth upon the earth”] (Isaiah 24:21).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea is also referenced by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Exodus.7.17.1?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Shemot 7:17</a>.</p>\n<p>There's a hint that this was also thought by Chazal regarding the plague of locusts. After Moshe and Aharon demand that Pharaoh let everyone go, he says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.10.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 10:10</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיֹּאמֶר אֲלֵהֶם יְהִי כֵן ה' עִמָּכֶם כַּאֲשֶׁר אֲשַׁלַּח אֶתְכֶם וְאֶת טַפְּכֶם <strong>רְאוּ כִּי רָעָה נֶגֶד פְּנֵיכֶם</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.392.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on the Torah, remez 392</a> understood this phrase as referring to a star, i.e., a deity, named Ra'ah (also brought by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Exodus.10.10.2?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Shemot 10:10</a>; the midrash may have originally come from a version of Shir Hashirim Rabbah<sup>1</sup>) who will oppose Yisrael. This is most likely a reference to the king of the Egyptian gods, Ra (or Re), who was also the sun god. With regards to the plague of locusts, twice a curious phrase is used:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>וְכִסָּה אֶת עֵין הָאָרֶץ</strong> וְלֹא יוּכַל לִרְאֹת אֶת הָאָרֶץ וְאָכַל אֶת יֶתֶר הַפְּלֵטָה הַנִּשְׁאֶרֶת לָכֶם מִן הַבָּרָד וְאָכַל אֶת כָּל הָעֵץ הַצֹּמֵחַ לָכֶם מִן הַשָּׂדֶה.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.10.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 10:5</a>)<br />\n\"<strong>וַיְכַס אֶת עֵין כָּל הָאָרֶץ</strong> וַתֶּחְשַׁךְ הָאָרֶץ וַיֹּאכַל אֶת כָּל עֵשֶׂב הָאָרֶץ וְאֵת כָּל פְּרִי הָעֵץ אֲשֶׁר הוֹתִיר הַבָּרָד וְלֹא נוֹתַר כָּל יֶרֶק בָּעֵץ וּבְעֵשֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶה בְּכָל אֶרֶץ מִצְרָיִם.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.10.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 10:15</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is stated the locusts will \"cover the eye of the land\". <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.10.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Onkelos_Exodus.10.15&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Onkelos</a> understood this phrase as referring to the eye of the sun (likely for, among other reasons, that the next words are \"ותחשך הארץ\", the land was darkened):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"They covered the visible surface [eye of the sun] of the entire land so that the land was darkened...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This continues the idea that the plague was intended to 'oppose' Ra, the Egyptian sun god, by blocking his 'eye' (= the physical sun).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> See מדרש שיר השירים עפ\"י כתב-יד ישן מתוך הגניזה שבקהיר, ed.

That said, the question of what basis there is for it, if any, is an interesting one that some have attempted to address.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoseph Schwartz in his <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31888&st=&pgnum=53&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hadrath Qodesh</a> (a work which in significant part deals with the rules and customs associated with the Hebhra Qadisha) records his correspondence with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Aaron_Wertheimer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shelomo Aharon Wertheimer</a> regarding the basis for the custom in Jerusalem/Israel to have a laying tombstone rather than an upright tombstone (as was traditionally done among most Ashkenazim in recent centuries). Rabbi Wertheimer similarly includes this correspondence in his work of responsa, <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=417&st=&pgnum=156\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">She'eilath Shelomo vol. 2, no. 50</a>. His record of the correspondence elaborates slightly more, so between the two I cite him below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המצבות שעל הקברים בירושלם על הר הזתים יש על הקברים בבית הקברים הקדום\nשלפני מאתים שנה במורד הר ציון הם מונחים על הקברים ולא עומדים כמו הנהוג\nבחו\"ל וכן הם המצבות הישנות שבשאר ערי אה\"ק וטעם להשינוי הזה בלתי נודע\nכי בכתוב מצאנו ויצב יעקב מצבה וכן מצבת קבורה רחל עד היום הזה ולשון\nמצבה מורה על הנצב ועומד לא על המונח ושכוב כמ\"ש ולא תקום לך מצבה ומצבה\nלא תקימו ואולי עשו כן במכוון כדי שלא לחקות מעשה או\"ה שהם מעמידים\nהמצבות בגובה או בעבור שבשכיבה מתקיימת המצבה יותר לימים רבים או שיש בזה\nאיזה טעם כמוס ע\"ד סוד והנה על גולל ודופק פי רמב\"ם ויקרא כסוי הקבר גולל\nלהיותו אצלו מאבן מתגלגלת משמע שהיו מניחים אז מצבת אבן על פי הקבר\nבשכיבה לא בעמידה וכן בתוס בסנהדרין ט\"ז ב מפרש ר\"ת דגולל היינו אבן גדול\nמלשון וגללו את האבן שמניחין על הקבר לסימן והיא מצבה וכן הוא בס הישר\nלר\"ה סי ס\"ד וברש לאהלות פ\"ב מ\"ד ומלשונם זה שהוא על שם וגללו את האבן\nמשמע שמנהגם היה להניח האבן בשכיבה כמו האבן המתגלגל ומונח ע\"פ הבאר</p>\n<p>The tombstones that are on the graves in Jerusalem on Mt. Olives and\non the graves in the ancient cemetery from hundreds of years ago (on\nthe descent of Mt. Zion) they rest upon the graves and are not\nstanding as is practiced outside of the Land, and the same as regards\nthe ancient tombstones in the rest of the cities of the Holy Land. And\nthe reason for this change is unknown/perplexing, as we find “and\nJacob set up a מַצֵּבָה” (Gen. 35:14) and similarly the מצבה for\nRachel’s tomb which stands to this day, and the language of מצבה is\ninstructive of that which is perpendicular (נצב) and standing rather\nthan which is lain at rest, as is written “you shall not set up a מצבה” (Deut. 16:22) and “you shall not erect a מצבה for yourselves” (Lev. 26:1). And perhaps the\nintent [of the custom to have a tombstone lain rather than standing] was to avoid imitating the gentiles who erect tall/high\ntombstones, or perhaps because in a laying position the tombstone will\nmore likely endure for a long period, or perhaps it involves a closely\nguarded secret on the basis of <em>sod</em> [i.e. esoterically/mystically\nsignificant]. And we see that the Rambam as regards <em>golel w’dofeq</em>\n(Ohaloth 2) explains <em>golel</em> as a cover to the grave made of stone\nthat is rolled over it and it is evident that they rested upon the\nopening of the grave a rock tombstone that was lain upon it not\nstanding. And so too in Tosafoth Sanhedrin 47b cites Rabbenu Tam as\nexplaining that, based on “they rolled the stone” (Gen. 29:3) we see\nthat <em>golel</em> is a large stone which one places on the grave as a\nmarker, which is a tombstone. And similarly one finds this in Sefer\nha-Yashar of R”T 64, and the Ra”sh on Ohaloth 2 that this language [of\n<em>golel</em>] is since they rolled/slid the stone and it is evident that they\nwere accustomed to resting the stone in a laying position just like\nthe stone that was laid upon and rolled/slid off the opening of the\nwell (Gen. 29).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we see, that R. Wertheimer did not have any received rationale for why the custom to have a laying rather than standing tombstone exists, nevertheless he furnished multiple plausible explanations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This was reactionary, i.e. it was consciously done in order to avoid imitating gentiles that erect large and looming monuments over graves.</li>\n<li>Practically a laying tombstone will weather time better, it is less likely to fall and break.</li>\n<li>There is some mystical significance to doing so that has been guardedly concealed.</li>\n<li>It is actually in perpetuation of ancient Jewish practice, as is evident from the Rambam and other mefarshim.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As for the third suggestion, that it is done on the basis of Sod (esoterica), the Mishkan ha-Nefesh (p. 141, fn. 13):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה שע\"פ סוד מוכח שהמצבה היא שוכבת שהרי בצורת ההשתטחות על הקבר הורה\nהאר\"י שצריך המשתטח לשכב ע\"ג המצבה פנים אל פנים  כנגד אבר וע\"כ שהמצבה\nשוכבת היא וכן המצבות בעירק בטורקיה הודו ומצרים שוכבות ולא עומדות וכן\nאפשר לראות בביה\"ק בארבל שהוא ביה\"ק יותר מאלפיים שנה שישנם כמה קברים עם\nמצבה שוכבת</p>\n<p>It appears that according to Sod it has been demonstrated that a\ntombstone ought be lain, since this is the form within which one\nprostrates upon a grave as instructed by R. Isaac Luria. That one has\nto prostrate on top of the tombstone, face to face, limb to limb, and\naccordingly the tombstone is in a lying position. And such is the case\nfor the tombstones in Iraq, Turkey, India, and Egypt, where they are\nlain and not standing upright. And it is also possible to see this in\nthe cemetery of Arbel which has a cemetery that is older than a 1,000\nyears old wherein there are tombstones that are lain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Without getting into the nitty gritties of whether such a practice constitutes the biblically prohibited doresh el hamethim (inquiring of the dead) and whether this is something people ought be doing, this view maintains that having a tombstone that is lain rather than standing is intended to facilitate those that lay prostrate upon graves in order to commune with the soul of the interred. If you are interested in learning more details about this Lurianic practice, see R. Haim Vital's description in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14179&st=&pgnum=105&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'ar Ruah ha-Qodesh, p. 109</a>. For multiple reasons, I do not personally find this particularly persuasive but the view is out there in circulation so it should at least be mentioned.</p>\n<p>As for a non-textual/anecdotal source, if you are open to the possibility: Upright tombstones were typical of lands with snowy winters (and are thus more typical of the lands of Ashkenaz). I once heard it suggested that the reason for an upright tombstone is that it would remain visible and identifiable throughout most of the year, even when there was snowfall. In the Middle East / North Africa, where large snowfalls are more of a rarity the default remained to have the tombstone lain flat.</p>\n\n\n",

Many commentaries criticise Yaacov for his fear. For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Genesis.32.26.2?ven=Eliyahu_Munk,_HaChut_Hameshulash&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Radak on Bereshit 32:26</a> says it was a sin<sup>*</sup> for which he was punished:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה לו זה מאת האל להיות בו זה לאות לפי שהיה פושע במחשבתו אחר כמה\nהבטחות אשר עשה עמו האל מדה כנגד מדה להיות פוסח בגופו; כי אע\"פ שהיה\nבוטח באל בכל לבו אלא שחשב שמא יגרום החטא, אעפ\"כ אחר כמה הבטחות לא היה\nלו להרהר ולחוש לעשו ולקראו כמה פעמים אחי ולשלוח לו מנחה גדולה ולהשתחות\nלו כמה פעמים, <strong>ובזה חטא, ושלם לו האל בזה העולם</strong> ולקה בגופו עונש מחשבת</p>\n<p>This [the limping] was a sign from G’d, a reprisal of a kind, for the doubts he had\nexpressed about the various promises G’d had made him. G’d now\npunished him by making him unable to rely on parts of his body that he\nwas in the habit of relying on. True, Yaakov trusted G’d with all his\nheart, but he was in a constant state of worry that the promises he\nhad received would not come true due to some sin he had committed.\nConsidering that G’d’s promise had been repeated on different\noccasions, proving that in the interval Yaakov had not forfeited his\nclaim to them, he should no longer have doubted that G’d would not\nkeep His promise for whatever reason. His servile behaviour towards\nEsau, including the many times he called him adoni, “my lord,” implied\na lack of trust in the validity of G’d’s promises to him. Neither\nshould he have sent him such an elaborate gift, nor should he have\nprostrated himself before him repeatedly. <strong>By doing so he committed a\nsin and G’d punished him in this life</strong> by afflicting his body,\nretribution already for planning to do this. [borrowed Eli Munk's translation]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To understand why this was a sin, let's look at the <em>Dor Hamidbar</em>. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.22?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 14:22</a>, Hashem accuses Benei Yisrael for <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.15a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">testing Him 10 times</a>. It beggars belief that our holy ancestors who just witnessed Hashem's loving redemption from Egypt would turn out to be such childish, petty moaners about things like meat, <em>ch'v</em>.</p>\n<p>They were not. They were following in Yaacov's ways. Yaacov is famous for <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">saying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>קטנתי</strong> מכל החסדים ומכל־האמת אשר עשית את־עבדך</p>\n<p><strong>I am unworthy</strong> of all the kindness that You have so steadfastly shown\nYour servant</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and these \"moaners\" were actually his children, following in his ways in feeling unworthy. They genuinely believed that they didn't deserve any more \"favours\" from Hashem, after all the wonders in Egypt. Therefore, like their Saba Yaacov, they believed that now they had used up all their merits, they were in grave danger of running out of food, water etc. in the desert, <em>and wouldn't dare to expect Hashem to provide it</em>.</p>\n<p>That sounds very noble, so why does Hashem call it a test? Here's the answer:</p>\n<p>Hashem said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנכי ה' אלקי<strong>ך</strong></p>\n<p>I am Hashem, <strong>your</strong> God</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"I am <em>yours</em>\", He said, and we just couldn't believe it! This disbelief may have come out of our humility, gratitude and recognition of Hashem's greatness, which are praiseworthy traits in us. Still, by not trusting that Hashem really <em>means it</em>, we were committing a sin, which led to us doing what people often do when they are first married and have just made eternal commitment to eachother: we tested Him to see if He really meant it. We wondered deep down: if we were to make a Golden Calf, would He still be ours? Once we really felt comfortable that He meant it, we were able to relax and stop testing Him.</p>\n<p><strong>Once we factor that Hashem seeks a relationship with us</strong>, one that He Himself wants and initiates, which arises from His own true love and desire - a righteous and faithful relationship of belonging, intimacy, closeness and <em>yichud</em> - <strong>we can intuitively see why this is a sin</strong>. Trust is a vital requirement for a close, intimate relationship, and distrust damages it greatly. It is also very hurtful. If one party in a relationship is convinced their partner doesn't love them <em>really</em>, and He is constantly weighing their merits against their demerits, with His love, favours and promises all contingent on the scale being on the side of merit, then there is something that needs correcting in this relationship, to say the least.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I hope I've made my point clear, now, although I could continue writing. I don't think I can make a short summary of the above, I recommend it be read and contemplated in full. I understand some might still ask (with <em>mefarshim</em> to back them up) that sin <em>does</em> lead to punishment. Indeed, but it wouldn't be on topic to deal with that in this question.</p>\n<p><sup>* on his level, at least</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps they aren't contradictory.</p>\n<p>If sin can cause bad things to occur then logically we should always be fearful of bad things happening.</p>\n<p>It must be that so long as we try to live righteously then unless we know that we did a real no-no we can rightfully proceed with confidence and optimism.</p>\n<p>If someone is fearful despite living ethically we would rightfully term such a person anxious and nervous.</p>\n<p>The gemara is explaining <em>how</em> it was possible for Yaakov to have been afraid despite having been promised that it'll be ok, explaining that sin can undo a prophecy for good, with Rambam accepting that in his introduction to the Mishnah.</p>\n<p>In Shemoneh Perakim Rambam is focusing on <em>why</em> Yaakov was afraid, despite his living an exemplary life and having been given a divine promise that all would be ok, reasonably concluding that Yaakov must have been a nervous type and therefore suspected the worse.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yaakov is often nervous because he makes the wrong choices or his family makes the wrong choices.</p>\n<p>Jacob steals his brothers birthright and flees his household in fear.</p>\n<p>Jacob takes his two wives with a bunch of goats and wealth without telling their father.</p>\n<p>Jacob meets the brother he wronged and obviously is scared over it.

Abraham went to war to save his nephew lot and was victorious. He blessed God for this victory and believed God was on his side. This is one of the reasons Abraham is able to so boldly argue with God over the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham knows Lot and his whole family is down there, and Abraham assumes they are righteous because God has already helped Abraham rescue Lot before. But in the end scripture shows us that no one in Lot's family was actually righteous. Bad things came for all of them. And Jacob knows this as well, that by acting badly then bad things tend to come as a result.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The consent of the girl for marriage and honour killing history\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I want to ask about the historical context of the value of the girl's consent in marriage in ancient Jewish culture. As old as possible. If a girl had married a man without her father's permission, was she considered a whore and possibly be killed in honour killing as happened in all ancient cultures, and even today? How much did the girl had any say in the marriage? And how much does the groom's parent has the say in this, or the groom alone has more authority in decision when to take his bride home?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In terms of Halacha (Jewish Law), the decision is purely for the bride and groom, not their parents, who have no legal standing in the matter.  In general, children have an obligation to obey their parents wishes, but when it comes to choosing a spouse, <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Kibud_Av_V%27Em#Having_Awe_for_One%27s_Parents_(Moreh_Av_V%27Em)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the child is allowed to disobey the parent's wishes</a>.  In order to marry, it has to be willing for both of them (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.9b.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 9b</a> where there is a discussion whether a marriage contract can be valid if a woman didn't know at the time it was written and accepts it later).</p>\n<p>The Talmud (around 200CE) has a whole tractate on the process of marriage (Kiddushin).  I've not learned it that thoroughly, but as far as I know, it talks exclusively in terms of a man and woman choosing to get married without any significant import given to the opinion of their parents, which is significant as the Talmud usually includes minority opinions, even those which are quite extreme.</p>\n<p>There is an exception in the case of a girl who is a minor who can be married off by her father without her consent (which I'm not very familiar with so I can't comment much further and suspect that there is a lot more complexity to this before anyone starts jumping the gun on the implications).  I think that in that case, the father is effectively giving consent on her behalf as she isn't of legal age to do so, but that ability ends when she reaches age 12.</p>\n<p>There has also never been a concept of \"honour killing\" in Judaism, as this would just be considered murder.  Death penalties can only be imposed by a Beth Din, and even then, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Makkot.1.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a Beth Din who execute once in seven/seventy years (depending on the opinion) is considered as destructive/violent</a>.  The only other situations which I can think of where killing someone is permitted are to save someone's life, or a very specific situation where a relative of a victim is permitted to kill someone who has accidentally killed someone out of negligence, and neither of these would apply to the concept of \"honour killings\".</p>\n<p>All of this has been the position going back at least as far as the times of the Talmud and probably at least as far as the Torah being given if not all the way back to Abraham.</p>\n<p>I'm not certain, but I don't think that a prostitute would even be punished with death, so that comparison may not be relevant either.  There are a number of stories mentioning prostitutes in Tenakh and Talmud and I don't recall the prostitute being put to death in any of them.  The closest that I can think of is that Yehuda (Judah) was going to put Tamar to death as he thought she had practiced prostitution, but <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.38.24?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there is a whole discussion in Rashi and Ramban as to why she would deserve the death penalty where they imply that harlotry is not punishable by death</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are rich scholar-supporters exempt from studying Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Tradition tells us that the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar had an understanding:  Zebulon would make money in trade to support itself and Issachar, and Issachar would study Torah full-time.  This tradition continued through the centuries, and to this day rich observant Jews want their daughters to marry scholars so they can have lots of scholarly grandsons, and happily support them so they can study Torah all the time and not worry about earning a living.  The Rambam has a similar partnership with his brother.</p>\n<p>Yet the Sources, in numerous strong quotes, tell us that everybody must study Torah and make time for doing so, and this is more important than all other commandments: <em>V'Talmud Torah k'neged kullam</em>.  For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following are the things for which a man enjoys the fruits in this world while the principal remains for him in the world to come: Honoring father and mother; performing righteous deeds; and making peace between a person and his friend. And the study of Torah is equal to them all. [Peah 1:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, are rich scholar-supporters exempt from studying Torah?  Or maybe not study it as intensely as others?  Anything in the Sources on the extent of their obligation to study?</p>\n<p>I could not find a quote on what minimal Torah study is; only this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a person lacks the knowledge to study Torah or it is impossible for him to do so because he is burdened with too many concerns, then he should support others who do study Torah, and it will be considered as though he himself had studied...

I'm sure that there is still a great mitzva beyond that, but that doesn't mean that everyone should prioritise it above the mitzva of earning a living to provide for yourself and family (and giving yourself the ability to give tzedaka, maaser etc).  Also, if you pay someone else to learn, you get some of the merit of their learning, and I imagine that giving a really great talmid chacham the ability to learn uninterrupted because they don't need to worry about earning a living gives them the opportunity to produce learning of a far greater quality than the average person, so sharing in that might sometimes be worth more than extra learning yourself, especially if you have in mind when you work that you are working to earn money to help someone else learn.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The שדה חמד מערכה ו סימן טו <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14153&st=&pgnum=280\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sde Chemed</a> discusses this whole issue in length, discussing many of the points brought up above.

There would be the issue of testing Hashem that would disallow such a study.</p>\n<p>Even if that could be worked around. Trying to analyze segulas  from  a scientific acceptable perspective is like trying to fit  a square peg in a round hole. Those who are trying to prove the efficacy of seulos usually use anecdotal data. Scientists  usually do not accept such evidence.  Moreover there are unknown spiritual factors behind a segulah so in theory it would be possible for a segula to work even though those who followed it seemed   statistically less  likely to have seen a benefit than those who did not. The segula proponent explanation would be that the unknown spiritual  factors caused that outcome. Conversly if the segulas would show a statistical benefit then the scientists  would be the ones insisting that the result is only becuase of unknown other factors</p>\n\n\n",

Otherwise, how did they obtain this grain? So we see that Pharaoh already had taxing power. (You could argue that the taxing power existed but was less than 20% and only subsequently became 20%, but that seems like a stretch to me.)</p>\n<p>Yet in Genesis 47:24 Yosef states he has now acquired 20% tax power through selling grain to the people:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָיָה֙ בַּתְּבוּאֹ֔ת וּנְתַתֶּ֥ם חֲמִישִׁ֖ית לְפַרְעֹ֑ה וְאַרְבַּ֣ע\nהַיָּדֹ֡ת יִהְיֶ֣ה לָכֶם֩ לְזֶ֨רַע הַשָּׂדֶ֧ה וּֽלְאׇכְלְכֶ֛ם\nוְלַאֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּבָתֵּיכֶ֖ם וְלֶאֱכֹ֥ל לְטַפְּכֶֽם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What was this new power that he obtained for the Pharoah that he did not have before?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the R Avraham ben HaRambam, Yosef indeed wasn't acquiring a new power for Pharaoh, but rather through letting the people live on the land he was making the existing 20% power sufficiently palatable to the people to keep doing it in perpetuity:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/R._Avraham_b._HaRambam/Bereshit/41.34#m7e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">וחמש – נאמרו בו שני פירושים אחד מהם שיטת המתרגם והמפרשים הנמשכים אחריו שהוא מטעם הזירוז נגזר מן וחמשים עלו וג׳ והשני שיטת אבי אבא ז״ל שהוא נגזר מן החומש [וסיוע לפירוש זה מה שאמר (יוסף) בסוף הסיפור בפרשת ויגש ונתתם חמישית לפרעה שהוא החומש] וטעמו שיוציאו את החומש מתבואת מושבי ארץ מצרים; ואמר (אבי אבא) ז״ל כי זה [או] שהיה מנהג קדום להם שהמלך יקח את החומש מן התבואות או מנהג שחידש (יוסף) והורה היתר לעצמו לחדש אותו לפי שזה קל על אנשי הארץ לרוב המענה בתבואת הארץ ומחירה הזול בשבע שני השבע ולפי שהם ירויחו בזה לעתיד כמו שבאמת הודו על זה בשעת הזריעה (ואמרו) החיתנו נמצא חן וג׳ ועשה זה (יוסף) ע״ה למנהג קבוע שהתחיל מן שבע שני השבע וחיזק אותו אחר שני הרעב וישם אותה לחוק; ופירוש שני זה עדיף לפי הנראה לי.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rashi on 41:34 follows Onkelos, and explains וחמש this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתרגומו 'ויזרז' וכן וחמושים (שמות יג, יח')</p>\n<p>As it is translated 'and he should hurry (others)' like וחמושים's translation (shemos 13:18)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, at first it wasn't (necessarily) a 20% tax.

    "content": "# Why weren’t the Egyptians mad that Joseph was favoring his family?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In parshat Vayigash, it explicitly says Joseph settles his family in Goshen and provides them with bread to survive the famine (as that was their whole reason for coming down). And then it talks about how the Egyptians ran out of food and basically sold themselves as slaves to pharaoh, yet they were thankful for Joseph for the food he provided (after taking all their land). Why weren’t the Egyptians mad that Joseph had nepotism and was sustaining his entire family with food, but for them they had to sell all their possessions and work for pharaoh to earn the food? And not just that they’re not angry, they’re even thankful and happy with Joseph!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>They were not upset at the beginning for two reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>They all understood that without Joseph's planning, then everyone would have starved to death. Slavery in the ancient world was a common practice to save yourself from starvation. And there's no hint in the Torah that Egyptian slavery at this point was harsh. If you sold yourself to Egypt under Joseph's policies you basically became a sharecropper where you kept a portion of food grown and Egypt would move populations so no one could really own land or build up a resistance.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Joseph's family was eventually enslaved just like everyone else. We don't read the exact moment of slavery, but scripture makes it clear everyone would become slaves because of Joseph's actions and we find ourselves slaves by the opening of Exodus.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having said that, I do believe people eventually would become upset at us. Because it seems like when the Israelites transitioned into slavery they did so while maintaining large flocks of livestock and keeping their nice homes in Goshen. So while initially people weren't upset at Joseph's family, I think over time resentment grew and we see Pharaoh tapping into that resentment when he enacts his policies and encourages people to participate in throwing babies into the Nile. But like all things, every action has an equal reaction. These same people who participated or witnessed the genocide of the Jewish babies found the compassion to give the Israelites gold at their time of freedom, or outright joined them as the mixed multitudes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Actually, there is grounds to say that they were indeed annoyed at the situation with the israelites.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.1.6?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Or_HaChaim_on_Exodus.1.6.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en#:%7E:text=%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%9C%20%D7%96%D7%9E%D7%9F%20%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3%20%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%95%20%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%91%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5%20%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim HaKadosh</a> does suggests that while Yosef was alive, the israelites lived in peace and serenity.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it was after the death of Yosef and after a \"new\" king arose in egypt that the egyptians grew tired of the israelites.</p>\n<p>In the midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.1.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en#:%7E:text=Rather%2C%20the%20Egyptians,new%20king%20arose.%E2%80%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah</a> it is mentioned that the it was the egyptians that first suggested the idea of causing friction with the israelites.

His father and brothers would also have money and livestock. They would have the means to buy land from their own pockets without taking state funds, especially when the land wasn't productive.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Joseph could have sustained the Egyptians without permitting them to become enslaved, but he didn't.

The words \"And Noach went in\" apply to what has previously been said - that he entered the ark to be hidden from sight. The words, \"because of the waters of the flood\" indicate that the waters actually pushed him (into the ark), meaning that he saw the waters of the Flood and was afraid. As a result, he \"went...into the ark.\" Rabbi Yosi added that Noach saw the Angel of Death arrive and that is why he entered the ark.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>בעצם יום הזה is a buzzword for Yom Kippur, not necessary high noon or broad day.

    "content": "# Can a Jew not believe in G-d?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a two part question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Where in the Torah is there an explicit command to believe in God? (e.g. You must believe in God). Yes, I know about the first of the ten commandments and Rambam's issue of the impossibility to command authority without already having authority. The question is rhetorically meant to imply that belief in the metaphysical reality of G-d is seemingly not assumed by the text to be necessary due to the lack of explicitly commanding it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If our forefathers didn't have blind faith why are we expected to? (i.e. What character in the Chumash demonstrated blind faith without prior prophetic communication or experiencing a miracle?). Midrashic interpretations are excluded. The source must obviously derive from a plain reading of the text.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As the question notes, the Ramban says that the first mitzvah of the Aseres haDiberos cannot be to believe in G-d because the whole concept of \"mitzvah - commandment\" pre-supposes the existence of a Commander.</p>\n<p>There are many Rishonim who do not see this as a problem. One could have a little belief and be commanded to learn enough to know, for example. Or one could just not see it as a problem to begin with - the non-believer is commanded whether or not he accepts that there is a G-d who did command him. Just as not knowing your country has a legislature doesn't stop them from passing laws that effect you.</p>\n<p>So, there are two possibilities: either belief in G-d is indeed one of the 613 commandments, or most commandments - if not - require such belief as a precondition.</p>\n<p>So yes, such belief is required, whether one can call it a mitzvah or whether one likes the Ramban's argument not to.</p>\n<p>There are also the many specific mitzvos to commemorate Yetzias Mitzrayim - the Exodus, which would require believing in a G-d Who took us out of Egypt. As well as Shabbos, that the world was created (and, according to the Devarim version of the Aseres haDiberos, Shabbos is about Yetzias Mitzrayim too).</p>\n<p>As for \"blind faith\", we aren't commanded to have \"blind faith\". Yes, the generation that lived through the Exodus and national revelation a Sinai had far more evidence to work with. Anyone who lived during the era of miracles would have more reason to believe than we do. (On the other hand, they likely only experienced miracles because they were of the sort that already believed just as well akready.)</p>\n<p>But there is plenty of evidence around today too. That feeling one gets when totally immersed in a Shabbos that is working. How does a Shabbos of 39 Melakhos work so much better than a vague and intuitive day of rest anyway? Or the elegence of a good halachic discussion one it all finally clicks. Judaism is beautiful like an elegant math proof. And like that proof, the beauty is an assessment of something actually inherent in the ideas and how they interact and feel when we try living them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>The title question</strong>: \"<em>Can a Jew not believe in God?</em>\" <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7775/can-a-jew-lose-their-jewish-status\">Yes</a>.

At one point a local missionary was specifically targeting us and putting it through our letterbox regularly and it was getting quite annoying to keep getting the incinerator bin and blowtorch out (especially if it was raining, and I'm sure the paper was designed to be hard to burn!).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is the mitzva to burn it immediately or is it allowable to wait until it is convenient?</li>\n<li>Are alternative methods of disposal acceptable?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

There's a lot of discussion about when exactly all those times are, which is earlier or later, etc. Arguably if not plausibly, one or some of them are at or around sunset.</p>\n<p>That opinion of Rabbenu Tam (shema after plag) is found in the very first Tosfot (Berakhot 2a). There, Ri is also quoted as allowing relying on those other Tannaim for the earliest time for reading shema.

When things are looking bleak, Hashem is in reality preparing for the greatest of salvations. Yehudah had left the presence of his brothers, his wife died, 2 of his children had died. Things were not looking good for him. In the middle of all this, Hashem was getting things ready for mashiach by arranging things so that Yehudah and Tamar were together and produced a child who was the ancestor of the moshiach. I haven't found anyone who explains why specifically Tamar...</p>\n<p>The brothers had sold Yosef. He was a slave in Egypt, a place of magic and impurity. His master's wife tempted him daily for months on end. His refusal to be with her landed him in jail for 12 years! However, Hashem was getting him ready for the critical role he was to play in forming our nation. All of this was for Yosef to improve his character. With his improved character, he stood before Pharaoh, only then was worthy to be the ruler of Egypt. It was Yosef who ensured that his father's family was taken care of during their stay in Egypt. For 70 years, the Jewish people were protected under the rule of Yosef till his passing. This was critical in the formation of our people. </p>\n<p>Yakov made a deal with Lavan to work for 7 years for Rachel. Yakov's original intention was to marry one wife and then go back home. Though Hashem had other things in mind, and ensured that Yakov also married Leah, who actually bore the bulk of the tribes. </p>\n<p>At all times, Hashem was and is guiding events so that His desire is, no matter how subjectively convoluted it may seem, the final outcome.</p>\n\n\n",

[Genesis 49:13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet the standard maps for the areas assigned to the tribes show that Zebulon was landlocked.  Why so?  Why didn't it get access to the sea?

The Vilna Gaon extrapolated that lots were cast twice: once in Gilgal and then seven years later in Shiloh. He interpreted Joshua 14 and the territorial allotments there as the first lottery divvying up the naĥalot of Judah and Benjamin that happened seven years after the Israelites entered the Land of Israel. Seven years after that lottery, when the Tabernacle was moved to Shiloh, lots were cast again – this time for the seven remaining tribes, as delineated in Joshua 18. <p>Rabbi Yoel Bin-Nun refined this interpretation by positing that all of the tribes received their naĥalot in Gilgal, back in Joshua 14, but some were dissatisfied with their allotments and therefore neglected to pursue conquering their territories. After the move to Shiloh, Joshua lamented, “For how long will you be negligent in rising to inherit that land that the Lord, God of your fathers, has given to you?!” Understood thus, Zebulun indeed inherited the coastal region in the initial lottery. We noted above how the midrash commented on their dissatisfaction with this region, a difficult tract of “mountains and hills, seas and rivers.” Rabbi Bin-Nun suggested that this midrash served to explain the discrepancy between what Zebulun was initially allotted and that which they received later at Shiloh – a portion cut off from the sea, with the ample fields and agricultural tracts that they had so coveted. <p>Was it therefore acceptable to be dissatisfied with a God-given lot? Don’t we teach our children that “you get what you get, and you don’t get upset”? Why did God humor Zebulun and change their naĥalah to suit the tribe’s whims?\nI believe that another approach to this presumed textual discrepancy is to acknowledge that there really wasn’t much of a discrepancy to comment on. Nowhere was Zebulun explicitly promised the coast (with the possible exception of the midrash in Bava Batra 122a). What was essential to the tribal makeup was not their territory, but their profession. And their profession was on the seas, fluid and amorphous, impossible to allot to any one tribe. The major coastal cities may have belonged to Asher, but Zebulun’s personality dominated the trading ports. Their territory was not essential to their character, but their avocation was.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I've seen other versions of the <a href=\"https://fineartamerica.com/featured/canaan-as-it-was-divided-between-the-twelve-tribes-of-israel-english-school.html?product=tapestry-68-80&googleShopping=true&completeProductSku=artworkid%5B19479932%5D-productid%5Btapestry-68-80%5D-imagewidth%5B794%5D-imageheight%5B1196%5D-targetx%5B0%5D-targety%5B-133%5D-modelwidth%5B794%5D-modelheight%5B930%5D-backgroundcolor%5BEFF0E9%5D-orientation%5B0%5D&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAkKqsBhC3ARIsAEEjuJgFBPSFI4SB4ZNdFMF_TaUIbwrQc4q1c6e3JAPQETF8e-nTlvESS1IaAs7XEALw_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">map</a> where they are on the Galilee or have a strip that goes to the coast.

The acceptance of the yoke of Heaven will automatically entail the acceptance of all the mitzvot, as we learn in Masechet Berachot 13a, \"Why does the passage of Shema precede the passage of Vehaya Im Shamoa? So that he accepts upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven and then the yoke of commandments.\" This means that once a person accepts עול מלכות שמים which categorically includes עול מצוות, then a person explicitly enumerates the mitzvot included, which is under עול מצוות.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sha'arei Orah - Self-Contradictory?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sha'arei Orah (Gates of Light) is a book by Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla. It is a book of kabbalah and features an in-depth discussions on the attributes of each sefirah. However, many of its statements (at first pass) appear contradictory. For instance (names of God are altered):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adoshem is fed by and raised up by Kel Chai, but Kel Chai is also said to be an attribute of Adoshem - so each raises up the other?</li>\n<li>The essence of Brit is divided into the Brit of Binah, Brit of Adoshem, and Brit of Kel Chai, each of which is the essence of different aspects. The ensuing paragraphs repeatedly contradict which element (most notably Torah and Shabbat) is an aspect of which Brit. This in particular I found so confusing that \"Rabbi Gikatilla kept forgetting which one was which\" or \"There was a massive scribal error\" both feel like serious possibilities.</li>\n<li>Tzedek is said to be a cognomen of Adoshem and Tzadik a cognomen of Kel Chai, but Tzadik contains Tzedek within it. So is Tzedek of Kel Chai or Adoshem? (One could perhaps argue that Tzadik being of Kel Chai has its \"lower form\" of Tzedek attached to Adoshem, but I'm mostly guessing)</li>\n<li>Mishpat is somehow a cognomen of Adoshem (of Malchut) and the essence of Tiferet (a totally different sefirah) at the same time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All told, I find the book often confusing and repeatedly self-contradictory, with many cases of aspects which appear to support alternate names for themselves, be both holding and held up by each other, be the essence of two different things at once, or similar. Is this an intentional element of the book? Am I missing something? Is this because I am reading the book in translation (though many words have transliterations provided)?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it kosher to invest in cToken loans if it might lead to Jews paying interest?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Certain advancements in the cryptocurrency ecosystem are revolutionising financial mechanisms, which no longer fit the traditional paradigms we have been used to (let alone the Sages before us).</p>\n<p>One example, is decentralised borrowing markets on blockchain, where you can put the money in and earn interest on it, while other people borrow at an interest. The difference between this and the classic borrowing scheme is that no one is making any deals here (offering or accepting a loan at a particular interest rate), instead we simply interact with a certain \"vending machine\", which exchanges money into redeemable coupons. These coupons can be redeemed at any point and the \"interest\" is earned because the exchange rate is ever-growing (so, maybe because of this we wouldn't actually consider this a loan at all but rather an investment; unlike traditional loans, one has no obligation to repay these \"loans\" ever once the collateral is liquidated).</p>\n<p>Not sure if this particular point is relevant but the interest rate isn't decided by anyone explicitly, it is a direct consequence of the ratio between the capital of lenders and borrowers (as well as the total reserves, managed autonomously by this vending machine in order to create a stable market).</p>\n<p>All this logic is open-source and available to anyone so while certain markets were launched to operate completely autonomously, some actors create their private semiautonomous markets where they can exert certain types of control (liquidity rates, reserve factors etc.). Also, not sure it makes a difference in terms of what this is considered to be according to Halacha.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#ctokens\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.compound.finance/v2/ctokens/#ctokens</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am not going to give a Psak but here are some observations:</p>\n<p>From Halachipedia</p>\n<p>\"It is forbidden to charge or take interest from an individual Jew or group of Jews.

    "content": "# Why was Samson Allowed to Attend his Own Wine-Wedding Party?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Samson attended his own wedding celebration:</p>\n<p>(Judges, 14:10)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֵּ֥רֶד אָבִ֖יהוּ אֶל־הָֽאִשָּׁ֑ה וַיַּ֨עַשׂ שָׁ֤ם שִׁמְשׁוֹן֙ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה כִּ֛י כֵּ֥ן יַעֲשׂ֖וּ הַבַּחוּרִֽים׃\nSo his father came down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there, as young men used to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The word <em>Mishteh</em> means that wine was present - Rashi on Esther 5:4 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֶל הַמִּשְׁתֶּה. כָּל סְעוּדָה נִקְרֵאת עַל שֵׁם הַיַּיִן שֶׁהוּא עִיקָר:\n\"To the משתה\" – any feast is called after the wine, which is the primary part.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But, per the Rambam, a Nazir, rabbinically, cannot attend a feast with wine. He must instead remain far away. Rambam, Laws of Nazir, 5:10:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִדִּבְרֵי סוֹפְרִים שֶׁאָסוּר לְנָזִיר לַעֲמֹד בְּמוֹשַׁב שׁוֹתֵי יַיִן וְיִתְרַחֵק מִמֶּנּוּ הַרְבֵּה שֶׁהֲרֵי מִכְשׁוֹל לְפָנָיו. אָמְרוּ חֲכָמִים סָבִיב לַכֶּרֶם לֹא יִקְרַב:\nAccording to Rabbinic decree, it is forbidden for a nazirite to abide amidst a gathering of people drinking wine. [Instead,] he should separate himself far from them, because they present a hurdle for him. Our Sages said: \"Do not come close [even to] the area around the vineyard.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What strengthens the question is that Samson, while on route to his wedding was scrupulous to avoid entering a vineyard due to the very same rabbinic prohibition - Malbim, Judges 14:10:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובבואם במשעול הכרמים עקם שמשון את הדרך כענין סחור סחור אמרינן לנזירא לכרמא לא תקרב\nand when they came to a vineyard pathway, Samson changed his direction a la \"Do not come close [even to] the area around the vineyard.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why then did Samson the Nazir attend his own Philistine-attended wine drinking, wedding banquet?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I believe that 14:4 can be understood to mean that the entire occasion was a divinely sanctioned/orchestrated ruse that Shimshon was in on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואביו ואמו לא ידעו כי מיהוה היא כי תאנה הוא מבקש מפלשתים ובעת ההיא\nפלשתים משלים בישראל</p>\n<p>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD; for he\nsought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the\nPhilistines had rule over Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is why the pasuq states that his parents did not know - the implication being that he did in fact know.</p>\n<p>If that is the case, the feast (much like the marriage itself) would have been understood by him to be a necessary component of the plot and therefore permissible.</p>\n<p>As for why it was necessary we are told that it was the cultural expectation כי כן יעשו הבחורים (\"for so used the young men to do\" i.e. the feast was customarily conducted on such occasion). Acting to the contrary could derail the plot.</p>\n<p>That said, it is still possible to suggest that though he conducted a feast, he did not actually attend it. R. Yeshayahu Kohen (MiPi ha-Kohen 'al Nebhiim, p. 114) suggests as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פסוק י' ויעש שם שמשון משתה כי כן יעשו הבחורים מדאמר משתה ודאי היה שם\nיין וכמש\"כ רש\"י בפירושו לאסתר פרק ה' ד' משתה כל סעודה נקראת ע\"ש היין\nשהוא עיקר וכ\"כ עוד במקומות הרבה <strong>ולפ\"ז צ\"ל דאף שעשה להם משתה הוא לא\nישב עמהם שהרי נזיר אסור לו להיות במעמד שותי יין</strong> וכמ\"ש הר\"מ פ\"ה\nמנזירות ה\"י מדברי ס ופרים שאסור לנזיר לעמוד במושב שותי יין ויתרחק ממנו\nהרבה שהרי מכשול לפניו כו' וביארו המפרשים דהיינו מה שאמרו בכמה דוכתי\nסחור סחור אמרין לנזירא לכרמא לא תקרב</p>\n<p>“and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do” and\nwhen it states “feast”( משתה) it is certain that there was wine\npresent, much as Rashi on Esther 5:4 explains  “lit. drinking feast.\nEvery banquet is called (מִשְּׁתֶּה) on account of the wine, which is\nthe principal feature.” And as is written about in many other places.\n<strong>Accordingly one must say that even though he made a drinking feast he\ndid not sit/dwell with them since a nazirite is prohibited from being\nin the company of those drinking wine</strong>, as the Rambam in H. Neziruth\n5:10 states: According to Rabbinic decree, it is forbidden for a\nnazirite to abide amidst a gathering of people drinking wine.\n[Instead,] he should separate himself far from them, because they\npresent a stumbling block before him, etc. and as the commentators\nexplain in a number of places “go around and around the vineyard and\ndo not approach it”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The assumption that the Patriarchs kept the Torah, even rabbinic laws, before the giving of the Torah, or in this case, a Biblical judge kept a rabbinic decree prior the actual rabbinic decree, would be a midrashic approach.</p>\n<p>In the phrase סחור סחור אמרינן לנזירא לכרמא לא תקרב, this is not the text of a rabbinic decree. Rather, it is an Aramaic proverb, indicating a specific attitude one should have. It is invoked by Amoraim telling us to avoid situations which may inadvertently lead to sin, for instance, by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.40b.11?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ulla in Pesachim 40b</a> about adding vinegar to a mixture before or after, where the fear is of becoming chametz, or again by Ulla in another context in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.17a.6?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 17b</a>. Another one in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.58b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 58b</a>. Also on 59b.</p>\n<p>Shimshon himself literally applied this principle, this adage / proverb, to a <strong>literal</strong> case of a nazir going around a vineyard. So the commentator, Malbim, made reference to it, כענין, in the manner of, meaning influenced by this principle. This doesn't mean that he was necessarily following a rabbinic prohibition, which perhaps hadn't been enacted yet.</p>\n<p>It is interesting that Rambam says that this is a \"divrei Soferim\" / rabbinic prohibition. Kesef Mishnah points to Avodah Zara 59, but that is the dictum applied to other cases.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, marrying a woman who isn't Jewish would also be prohibited, so perhaps Shimshon should have avoided attending his own wedding for that reason. The answer is that presumably, where there was a purpose in propelling events towards their divinely inspired conclusion, he nevertheless acted against halachah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Translation help: powers of the seven great men of the city\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm struggling with a particular part of the reasoning of the Mahari ben-Lev in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1388&pgnum=222\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">responsum 2:72</a>, in which he addresses whether or not the טובי העיר have the power to make a rule banning townsfolk from moving to other cities.</p>\n<p>The bit with which I'm struggling quotes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ran_on_Megillah.7b.2?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Ran's commentary on Masechet Megillah</a>, which addresses a situation where the טובי העיר are given a vague instruction to look after the community's affairs, then they decide to sell the synagogue, even though the townsfolk would never have imagined they would do such a thing. The Ran, if I understand him correctly, says that this still falls within the authority of the טובי העיר and the sale is valid.</p>\n<p>After quoting the Ran, the Mahari ben-Lev says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואי בהאי מילתא הוה אסיק אדעתין דלא נתנו רשות לשבעה טובי העיר כשמנום\nבנדון דידן דעדיף טפי וטפי ודאי אית לן למימר דלא נתנו להם רשות ועל\nכיוצא בזה ואפילו במילתא דאיכא רווחא להאי ופסידא להאי איכא למימר דלא\nעלה על דעתם כי היכי דאין הרוב ושבעה טובי העיר יכולין לכוף את המיעוט\nבכיוצא בזה גם כן אפילו אם מנום עליהם לא מנום אלא לדברים שהוא רגילות\nלגזור בענייני המנהגים התקנות ומיגדר מילתא וכיוצא בזה אבל שיתן אדם\nהבחירה ביד שבעה טובי העיר שיכופו אותו לדור באותה המדינה ולא ללכת לעיר\nאחרת הוא דבר שלא עלה על דעת אדם ואם נתנו להם רשות לגזור עליהם היינו\nבהיותם בני עירם אבל לא שיגזרו עליהם שיהיו אנשי עירם ולא אנשי עיר אחרת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His ultimate conclusion is that the טובי העיר do not have the power to ban townsfolk from moving elsewhere, because the townsfolk never intended to give their leaders such a sweeping power. In the bit that's troubling me, I think the Mahari ben-Lev is explaining why this case is different from the Ran's case (where the fact that the townsfolk never intended to let their leaders sell the synagogue was of no relevance, and the synagogue could be sold regardless). But I don't understand the distinction being made.</p>\n<p>If anyone can help me with a translation and/ or explanation, it would be much appreciated!</p>\n<p>If it's helpful, here is a footnote to this bit in a modern edition of the Mahari ben-Lev:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FhjLL.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FhjLL.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'll translate from \"ואפילו במילתא דאיכא\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And even a thing that one benefits and another loses out, we can say that they hadn't thought of this, just like the majority with the 7 טובי העיר can't force the minority in something like this. So too, even when they appointed them (טובי העיר) upon themselves, they were only appointed for things that it is normal to decree; for (deciding) traditions, for making edicts, and for creating fences and the like. However, that a man should give the choice to טובי העיר to force him to live in that country (area) and not to leave the city, this is not something that people think of (or: this is inconceivable), and although they gave them the power to make decrees about them, this is only so long as they are members of the city, but not that it be decreed upon them that they must be members of this city and not another!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or in short, as User123 said in the comments, if טובי העיר sell the shul it's a good sale, because טובי העיר have the ability to decree things thay have to do with the running of the city. However no one ever thought of giving טובי העיר the ability to make 'meta-decrees' about whether one is allowed to <em>leave</em> the city.</p>\n\n\n",

Based on the context where the pasuk uses the word simcha. Now we know that simcha isn't \"firm, constant happiness\", rather it's \"happiness caused by firmness\". When Yisrael are in a state of simcha because of Hshem's redemption, it means they never had any doubts about it.</p>\n\n\n",

Without free choice, observing Torah and Mitzvot would be a sham. Therefore, when G-d gave us commandments, he gave with it the ability to truly choose whether to do them or not.

Since the Torah was only given to the Jewish people here on earth, we must say that any extra-terrestrial being does not have free will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And yet, earlier in the answer, it states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'Curse you Meroz,' said the messenger of the Lord, 'curse you bitterly (you) inhabitants thereof,' because they came not to the aid of the Lord, to the aid of the Lord against the mighty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Moed_Katan.16a.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mo'ed Kattan 16A</a> - English on page 59 here) brings two opinions of who or what Meroz is.

Loc.] say that the correct version of the Ramba'm should be with the following passuk: כי יקח איש אשה ובעלה, rather than the one in the Ramba'm itself.)</p>\n<p>However, the ha'amek Davar (devarim 24:1) says (in brackets):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והא דאיתא בקדושין דנפקא ליה קיחה קיחה לענין קדושין הוא ג\"ש המקובל, וכוונה שניה במקרא כי יקח בכסף או ובעלה היינו שיקנה בבעילה, אבל פשטא דקראי פי' כי יקח היינו נשואין ואפילו בעלה בגמר ביאה, ומכאן נפקא לו דמהני גט אפי' לנשואה</p>\n<p>And the fact that in [tractate] Kiddushin they learn \"kicha\" [here] to \"kicha\" [by Efron] about Kiddushin, this is the accepted <em>Gezeira shava</em>, and a secondary meaning of this passuk, that \"when [a man] takes\" means Kiddushin through money, or \"has relations with her\" means Kiddushin through relations. However, the simple understanding of this passuk is referring to marriage, \"when one takes\" to marry, \"and has relations\" meaning even if he had complete relations¹, and from here [this simple understanding of the passuk] we learn that a Get works even for a married woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, the simple reading of the passuk is what you would think- a reference to marriage. Because of the Gezeira shava, we understand it to refer to Kiddushin.</p>\n<p>A Gezeira shava must be given through mesorah, halacha l'moshe misinai (pesachim 66a, rashi there). Therefore, this understanding of the passuk (that it refers to Kiddushin), which is learned through a Gezeira shava, is halacha l'moshe misinai, even if it's not the simple understanding of the passuk.</p>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li>This is referring to something the ha'amek Davar was talking about earlier in his explanation of this passuk.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do gentiles have the obligation of giving charity to help the needy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The only source I found that relates to charity and gentiles is that Jews are expected to give charity to help the non-Jews in their environment for the sake of \"darkei shalom\".</p>\n<p>Given that charity is not a \"hok\" that we observe for the sake of serving God alone but a practical way of ensuring justice for all people, would it not be God's intention to cover gentiles' basic needs and prosperity as part of the \"tzedakah framework\" or is this only considered necessary for Jews alone?</p>\n<p>Despite massive amounts of charity in the non-Jewish world, the world is full of suffering and injustice. In a (hypothetical) world, where all Jews and non-Jews are righteous and live according to Halacha, would it not be problematic alone for the financial injustice among gentiles to be unaddressed at all (except for the Jewish \"darkei shalom\" contribution that couldn't possibly be sufficient to resolve the imbalances fully)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As neglecting charity contributed to Sodom's destruction (per Yechezkel 16:49), they are apparently not only obligated but even held to task for it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִנֵּה זֶה הָיָה עֲוֺן סְדֹם אֲחוֹתֵךְ גָּאוֹן שִׂבְעַת לֶחֶם וְשַׁלְוַת הַשְׁקֵט הָיָה לָהּ וְלִבְנוֹתֶיהָ וְיַד עָנִי וְאֶבְיוֹן לֹא הֶחֱזִיקָה.</p>\n<p>Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom; pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I should also note Devarim 23:4-5 where lack of kindness is a contributing factor for permanently disallowing marriage with certain folks</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא יָבֹא עַמּוֹנִי וּמוֹאָבִי בִּקְהַל י\"י גַּם דּוֹר עֲשִׂירִי לֹא יָבֹא לָהֶם בִּקְהַל י\"י עַד עוֹלָם. עַל דְּבַר אֲשֶׁר לֹא קִדְּמוּ אֶתְכֶם בַּלֶּחֶם וּבַמַּיִם בַּדֶּרֶךְ בְּצֵאתְכֶם מִמִּצְרָיִם וַאֲשֶׁר שָׂכַר עָלֶיךָ אֶת בִּלְעָם בֶּן בְּעוֹר מִפְּתוֹר אֲרַם נַהֲרַיִם לְקַלְלֶךָּ.</p>\n<p>An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Hashem; even to the tenth generation none belonging to them shall enter into the assembly of Hashem forever, because they didn't meet you with bread and with water on the way, when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As such, you are correct not to want to rush through but rather go-slow and understand what you say.</p>\n<p>Experience shows that one should learn one prayer well, and as one grows in practice, it becomes possible to add more within the same time frame. One Rav experienced with <em>baalei tshuva</em> advises to pick a time frame for prayer that matches your abilities (say a quarter of an hour in the morning), and gradually add prayers as you go faster over those you know.</p>\n<p>The core of morning prayers is in order of priority (based on R Eliezer Krohn's <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422628034.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A woman's guide to practical halacha</a>, incidentally a very recommended book)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the morning blessings (<em>birkot haTorah</em> and <em>birkot haShachar</em> at the very beginning of the prayer order)</li>\n<li>Shema Israel (at least the first two verses, ideally all three paragraphs) - if the choice is between <em>Shmonei Esrei</em> and 3 paragraphs, then prefer the former</li>\n<li>the <em>Shmonei Esrei</em> (or <em>Amida</em>)</li>\n<li><em>Psukei d'Zimra</em> (a series of psalms before <em>Shema</em>, the core minimum being <em>Baruch Sheamar</em>, <em>Ashrei</em>, <em>Yishtabach</em>)</li>\n<li>Aleinu</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422600375.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artscroll's women siddur</a> gives a slightly different order of priority: Morning <em>amida</em>, afternoon <em>amida</em>, first two verses of <em>Shema</em>, blessings of <em>shema</em> OR morning blessings. Then <em>Psukei d'Zimra</em> with same priorities as above, then Aleinu. This siddur has a very nice introduction on women's prayers incl. general guidelines as well as women-specific prayers.</p>\n<p>Depending on your level of understanding of Hebrew, you might find an <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578196869.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">interlinear siddur</a> to be helpful, it has the words in English below the Hebrew. After a bit of practice, it is a very helpful way to understand prayers as one says them.</p>\n<p>Any beginner is always well advised to choose a Rabbi (or Rabbanit) she feels comfortable with and who can advise on all sorts of questions that will pop up. Prayer is no different.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Classically, Jewish prayer was entirely free-form, spoken from the heart in the pattern of praise-request-thanks. That's still what someone does in an emergency, such as soldiers on a battlefield (Berakhot 29b). Due to practical compositional difficulties, our Sages formalized the process into what we call \"the amida\". In traditional rabbinic terminology, \"prayer\" is actually just the name of what we often call \"the amida\".</p>\n<p>Prayer is thus defined as a set of topical blessings, preceded by Psalms 51:17 and followed by certain free-form supplications (commonly, \"Elohai Netzor\" and, on non-festive days, \"Tachanun\"). Some customarily add other opening verses and customs vary widely which preset nice supplications are appropriate in the closing on which occasions. This prayer is said standing\nat attention (until the final supplications), kempt, and facing the site of the Temple. That is the essential Jewish prayer.</p>\n<p>That's what you use whenever you want to pray, but our Sages enacted praying at least 3-5 times daily: once in the morning, (once additionally on festivals focused on that festival's sacrifices,) once in the afternoon, (once at the very end of special public fast days,) and once at night. (Technically, the night one can be skipped if too busy with another mitzva, but traditionally Jews have tried to do it even in that uncommon case.) It's generally assumed that nowadays our capacity for proper prayer has weakened such that we shouldn't seek more times than that.</p>\n<p>Throughout the day there are various short blessings on foods and sights and aspects of life. In a sense they are all \"mini-prayers\" and everyone should also say all of them as relevant.</p>\n<p>(In the early modern period, some rabbis bemoaned that the largely illiterate women of the time had stopped following these guidelines, and tried with great difficulty to defend the change in practice. Thankfully most women nowadays don't have this issue.)</p>\n<p>Men are obligated to recite Shema in the first half of the morning and at night. Certain blessings were enacted to precede and follow the Shema, complimenting its themes. A woman voluntarily reciting these would be a beautiful thing too.</p>\n<p>That's <strong>essentially</strong> it. R' Yosef Eliyahu Henkin in his introduction to the synagogue prayer guide which defined the standard practice in America <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2274&st=&pgnum=117\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> those in a rush to work can stop here.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For those with more time/ability, there are a host of other beautiful Psalms and petitions that have ages of Jewish tradition behind them, and I'll discuss some common ones below, but for the essentials you can just stop here.</p>\n<p>Shema and prayer compliment each other thematically and thus it is recommended to follow the shema service with a prayer.</p>\n<p>The Talmud (Pesachim 118a) praises one who reads Psalms every day. Accordingly, as a beautiful way to set the tone for the obligatory prayer, morning services can be preceded with a set of Psalms, especially 145[-150]. Short blessings surround these.</p>\n<p>A short study session was instituted after morning prayer to allow everyone to learn some Torah daily. Topics would vary but nowadays it is common to study Psalms 145 and 20, followed by a short petition for success.</p>\n<p>The \"Alenu\" section from Rosh Hashana was seen as a beautiful way to close out the service before heading out to work, and it became widely used as a conclusion.</p>\n<p>As each of those became more formalized, new ideas of various timely psalms and/or readings got tacked on to the standard set in appendices which themselves became formalized leading to new ideas being put in new appendices, etc.</p>\n<p>All that can be wonderful and meaningful for those who can handle it. As Rabbi Yochanan said (Berakhot 21a) \"If only one could pray all day!\"</p>\n<p>Beware though biting off more than you can chew. The earliest record we have of widespread neglect of prayers (Meshivat Nefesh (Beshallach) about 15th century German women) writes they gave it up because they thought the siddur (\"from adon olam to alenu\") was too long and didn't know how to focus on the essential parts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In addition to the answers already given, I would say a good road map is to look at the shulchan aruch Siman 52 where he discusses the order of prayers for one who comes late to shul. That provides a hierarchy of importance for prayers.</p>\n\n\n",

There are different sources (Shem MiShmuel, Parashas Beshalach, sefer Mi’Pi Kohen (Shoftim) by Rabbi Shimon Kohen) that explain what was going wrong with the Philistim. The Mishnah in Pirkei Avos 3:13 is quoted, and it is said that the Philistim were light-headed with regard to religion, if you would say \"G-d parted the reed-sea for us\" - they would lough out loud for example. This somewhat also seems to be the explanation the sefer \"באתי לארמוני\" gives. Refer to <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/28159/p/122/t/0.56020870305589221234/fs/WAkdDYxGaR8vO0jsbPsxQllchh1QjhJbgIpgPnfJp5va/start/116/end/118/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (sv. פלשתים דקדושה ופלשתים דקליפה):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומזה מובן מש\"כ ולא נחם אלהים דרך ארץ פלישתים כי קרוב הוא כי פלישתים היא קליפת ליצנות שהוא ענין הרחבת פיו כרצונו לדבר מה שלבו חפץ והיא שמחה של הוללות לאמור שפתינו אתנו וכו' ואין מעצור לרוחו ולכן נקרא קליפה כי כמו שהקליפה מכסה ומסתרת על הפרי כי היא נראית כמו שהיא עיקר הפרי כך השמחה של הוללרת מכסה ומסתרת על אור ה' שבה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another example of the nature of the Philistim during the days of the Shoftim and Shmuel can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/tanakh/studies-tanakh/core-studies-tanakh/toldot-gerar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">following description</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Philistines who serve as frequent antagonists in Judges and Samuel were a cruel, warlike nation that continuously terrorized the neighboring Israelites. They lived all along the Mediterranean coast in a pentapolis of five city-states: Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron and Gath. Each city-state was governed by its own lord, known as a “seren,” a word whose Greek parallel<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar_Chadash%2C_Yitro.3?vhe=Zohar_Chadash&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5</a> reflects the foreign elements that influenced Philistine language and culture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>B\"H I finally found the source, that Rav Daniel Glatstein shlita also talks about. It can be found in the sefer Ateres Menachem (p. 21). There, it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בהעלותך נג הרה\"ק ר\"ר משה מםאמבור ז\"ל כ' בם' תפלה למשה ששמע ממורו הה\"ק\nרבי ר' מענדלי מרומנוב שא' על ולא נחם אלקים דרך ארץ פלשתים ע\"ד שאחז\"ל\nובושב לצים לח ישב זה פלשתים שלצנים היו עיין ע\"ז דף י\"ט ואמר אלו הי'\nיודע פרעה שעם ליצנות יכולים להכחיש כל העולם לא הי' ישראל יוצאים מתחת\nידו לעולם ת\"ו ובפעם השנית הראה באצבעו דרך התלון ואמר בזה\"ל רואים אתם\nשזה מים ועם ליצנות יכולים להכחיש שזה ינו שמים ואחר םעודתו אמר בחדרו\nבםבורים אתם שבבית מדרשנו היום בשעת התפלה לא התפללו ליצנים זה הי'\nמתלוצץ על הש\"ץ שמאריך ואין קולו ערב בתפלתו ע\"כ ועיין בם' אמרי תמת\nמהרה\"ק מהר\"ל איגר מלובלין זצ\"ל בפ' תצא בקו\"א שמביא ד\"ז דשם רבנו שקליפת\nהליצנות היא בפלשתים רבנו שקליפת הליצנות היא בפלשתים וכו' ע\"ש ועיין\nביוצר לשבת הגדול במאמר אין ערוך אליך וכו' וגאלם מבעלי לצון והבן ת\nמכאדמו\"ר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it seems that clownery is the main sin by which the Philistim got down to the 50th level of impurity. Rests the question: <strong>How could ליצנות make the Philistim go down the 50th level of impurity?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Tzipporah had pity on him and fed him bread and water. After 10 years he was released, and when he went out into Yisro's garden, he saw a sapphire staff that had been planted and pulled it out. (Note that in the Midrash Hashkem (Greenhut edition), Shemos 4, it writes that this staff was given by Adam to Sheis, with each generation passing it on to the next. When Yosef died, Yisro who was one of Pharoah's advisors and knew the importance of the staff, took it and planted it in the garden of his house where it took root. He divined that whoever would be able to uproot the staff would be the redeemer of Israel).

    "content": "# Samson was Lustful and Thus Lost his Sight - the Gemara Does not Immediately Question This Premise, but Does so Eventually ... Why?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Samson had carnal relations with three women. The first one – <em>Eshes Timnah</em> – he married. Then there was an encounter with the unidentified harlot, and Delilah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna in Sota (9b) states:\nמַתְנִי׳ שִׁמְשׁוֹן הָלַךְ אַחַר עֵינָיו — לְפִיכָךְ נִקְּרוּ פְּלִשְׁתִּים אֶת עֵינָיו\nMISHNA: Samson followed his eyes, therefore the Philistines gouged out his eyes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna does not specify which woman is the subject of its quid-pro-quo. All of them? Only the first? Afterall, regarding Woman Number 1, <em>Eshes Timna</em>, the Navi (Judges 14:3) clearly states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֨אמֶר שִׁמְשׁ֤וֹן אֶל־אָבִיו֙ אוֹתָ֣הּ קַֽח־לִ֔י כִּי־הִ֖יא יָשְׁרָ֥ה בְעֵינָֽי׃\nSamson answered his father, “Get me that one, for she is the one that <strong>is pleasing in my eyes.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Irrespective of who the Mishna had in mind, remarkably, the Gemara does not immediately attempt to exonerate Samson.</p>\n<p>The Gemarra in Sota then quotes the following Tosefta:</p>\n<p>גְּמָ׳ תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: שִׁמְשׁוֹן בְּעֵינָיו מָרַד, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וַיֹּאמֶר שִׁמְשׁוֹן אֶל אָבִיו אוֹתָהּ קַח לִי כִּי הִיא יָשְׁרָה בְעֵינָי״ — לְפִיכָךְ נִקְּרוּ פְּלִשְׁתִּים אֶת עֵינָיו</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GEMARA: The Sages taught (Tosefta 3:15): Samson rebelled with his eyes, as it is stated: And Samson said to his father: Get her for me; for she is pleasant in my eyes” (Judges 14:3). Therefore, the Philistines gouged out his eyes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tosefta, unlike the Mishna, is 100% clear on which woman it is referring to -- <em>Eshes Timnah</em> – and it uses a strong verb (unlike the mishna) – <em>rebelled</em> … the bottom line here: Samson \"rebelled\" with his eyes (with Woman Number One) and therefore lost them.</p>\n<p>The Gemara reacts to the Tosefta immediately and attempts to vindicate Samson:</p>\n<p>אִינִי? וְהָכְתִיב: ״וְאָבִיו וְאִמּוֹ לֹא יָדְעוּ כִּי מֵה׳ הִיא״. כִּי אֲזַל מִיהָא — בָּתַר יַשְׁרוּתֵיהּ אֲזַל.</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: Is that so? But isn’t it written: “But his father and his mother knew not that it was from the Lord (Judges 14:4), indicating that Samson was on a Divine mission? The Gemara ultimately answers in any event Samson when he went, he followed his inclination and did not act for the sake of Heaven.</p>\n<p>The Gemara however made no attempt  to redeem Samson after the Mishna's statement.  The Samson indictment is nearly identical in both the Mishna and Tosefta, but there are at least two differences. 1) Each may be discussing different women... 2) Moreover, the word rebelled was not used in the Mishna.</p>\n<p>It's a mystery.</p>\n<p>The Maharsha on Sota 9b:</p>\n<p>איני והכתיב ואביו ואמו לא ידעו כי מה' כו'. אמתניתין לא קשיא להו דמה שהלך אחר עיניו גם זה היה מה' כדי להתנקם בפלשתים ולא בא לידי עבירה שלא נשאה כלל אבל מה שאמר הכא שבעיניו מרד בהקב\"ה פריך שפיר הא כתיב מה' הוא ומשני כי אזיל מיהא בתר ישרותיה כו'</p>\n<p>Is he suggesting that the Mishna is discussing the two women who Samson did not marry and therefore there was no sin and it was all part of God's plan\nand <em>thus the Gemara had nothing to react to?!</em> But, why is there no sin to cohabit with the latter two women? And EVEN per the Mishna, whatever/whovever it is talking about, it states that Samson lost his eyes because of what he did! Isn’t the Mishna's intimation of loss/punishment enough for the Gemara to immediately react and attempt to vindicate Samson? Why wait for the Tosefta to challenge this Samson-caused-his-own-blindness premise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Putting aside the Maharsha, the typical structure of the gemara is exactly this. That after a Mishna, we have Torat HaTannaim = related Tannaitic statements, then Torat HaAmoraim = statements from Amoraim about the Topic, and Shakla veTarya = unattributed Aramaic statements analyzing all of the above, wrapped around the various attributed (earlier statements).</p>\n<p>The Tosefta would be cited because it expressed the same idea, though in slightly different language, so perhaps clarifies the Tannaim's mindset. After presenting both salient sources, the Mishnah and Tosefta, the Talmudic Narrator (Stamma) can provide analysis and reinterpretation. So, we don't have to say like Maharsha. We can say that the Stamma is objecting to both.</p>\n<p>Even with the Maharsha, we don't need to read into his words what you are attributing to him, that we are discussing a different set of women. I think such a read is rather farfetched.</p>\n<p>Rather, what the Maharsha is saying is that the Mishnah and Tosefta are discussing the same woman, the same case, the same action, and the same result. However, as you note, the Mishnah used relatively pareve words, שִׁמְשׁוֹן הָלַךְ אַחַר עֵינָיו, that he walked after his eyes. (And we can add that the Mishnah doesn't give the prooftext of the pasuk.) This language doesn't directly contradict the verse which says that Shimshon was following God's plan. However, the Tosefta both uses the word \"rebel\" and cites a verse where the immediately following verse says that is was God's plan, so it is easier / is justifiable to ask the question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Because he didn't respect his parents wishes. ?</p>\n\n\n",

Kapach/Kafih/Qafih's if it isn't already extinct</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Qafih's tradition is alive and strong. One of his primary disciples, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratzon_Arusi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Rason 'Arusi</a> (a tremendous talmid hakham in his own right) is perhaps the most well known, however there are many others as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>how do they wash their hands in the morning... Rambam doesn't mention \"negel vasser\" as it was based on ruach raah/sheidim which Rambam doesn't subscribe to</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Rambam, washing is a preparatory function of tefillah. It is one of the five things that are me'akbhin eth ha-tefillah (H. Tefillah 4:1). So washing upon waking is unnecessary and only becomes obligatory before one intends to pray. It can be done at any time before prayer as long as one maintains mindfulness of their hand activity (H. Berakhoth 6:17). To my observation, this is how the community indeed observes the halakhah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>how do they... wrap their hand tefilin? ... Rambam doesn't subscribe to... the 7 arm wrappings which are of kabbalistic origin and mimic the 7 lower sefiros which again Rambam rejects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is how R. Itamar Kohen (an active member of the Dardai community) describes it in <a href=\"https://mishnatharambam.blogspot.com/2018/04/blog-post_72.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnath ha-Rambam</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לשון הרמב\"ם בהלכות תפילין ג,יב: ואורך רצועה של יד, כדי שתקיף את הזרוע\nויקשור ממנה הקשר, ותמתח רצועה אחת עד אצבע אמצעית, ויכרוך ממנה על אצבעו\nשלוש כריכות ויקשור. ע\"כ. <strong>למדנו מדבריו כי מסביב לקיבורת די בכריכה\nאחת, ושתי הכריכות הנוספות הם מנהג, וכן שבע הכריכות מסביב לזרוע הם\nמנהג.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That it is a function of minhag, there is no halakhah concerning it. So if one has a specific custom to wrap a certain number of times (be it 7 or any other number) they may do so. In the Baladi community (which R. Qafih and his talmidim are a subset of), the predominant custom is seven (I have seen other variations but never asked). However as R. 'Arusi <a href=\"https://net-sah.org/faq/48750\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">points out</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שבע הכריכות אינן מעכבות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Doesn't Euphemizing \"Who Makes Peace and Creates Evil\" Before Reading the Shema Mitigate Shema's Awesome Power?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The first blessing in the morning before Shema is known as <em>Yotzer Or</em>. It begins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם יוֹצֵר אוֹר וּבוֹרֵא חֽשֶׁךְ עֹשֶׂה שָׁלוֹם וּבוֹרֵא אֶת־הַכֹּל:\nBlessed are You, Adonoy our God, King of the Universe, Former of light, Creator of darkness, Maker of peace, Creator of all things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The words are based on Isaiah. 45:7. Here is the verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יוֹצֵ֥ר אוֹר֙ וּבוֹרֵ֣א חֹ֔שֶׁךְ עֹשֶׂ֥ה שָׁל֖וֹם וּב֣וֹרֵא רָ֑ע אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה עֹשֶׂ֥ה כׇל־אֵֽלֶּה׃ {פ}\nI form light and create darkness,\nI make peace and create evil—\nI GOD do all these things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But notice the change - the word \"evil\" from Isaiah is replaced by \"everything\" in the prayer. The Talmud in Brachot explains the euphemism:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֶלָּא כְּתִיב ״רַע״ וְקָרֵינַן ״הַכֹּל״ לִישָּׁנָא מְעַלְּיָא,  ״ !\nRather, it is written evil and we euphemistically recite the blessing all things\n<em>to avoid mention of evil.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is one problem.</p>\n<p>Per the Ramchal the raison d'etre of creation is for man to comprehend God's Oneness. In order to fully comprehend that Oneness we must understand that God created evil:</p>\n<p>אבל יחודו, אדרבא, זה מתגלה ומתברר לנו בירור גמור. ונמשך לנו מזה שלא די שהוא מתברר לנו, אלא שחייבים אנחנו להשיב אל לבנו הידיעה הזאת, לתקוע אותה בלבבנו בישוב גמור בלי שום פקפוק כלל.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But His singularity, is just the opposite, it is revealed and clarified focus in complete clarity. And it emerges for us from this that it is not enough that it be clear to us, but that we are obligated to return this knowledge to our hearts, to embed it in our hearts completely settled without any doubt ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ואמנם המאמין ביחוד ומבין ענינו, צריך שיאמין שהקב\"ה הוא אחד יחיד ומיוחד, שאין לו מונע ומעכב כלל ועיקר בשום פנים ובשום צד, אלא הוא לבדו מושל בכל. לא מבעיא שאין רשות נגדו ח\"ו, אלא הוא עצמו בורא הטוב והרע, כענין הכתוב (ישעיה מה, ז), \"יוצר אור ובורא חושך עושה שלום ובורא רע, אני ה' עושה כל אלה\";</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And indeed the believer in singularity and understander of its subject, need to believe that the Holy One blessed is he is one solitary and unique, who has no one who prevents or withholds him at all in any aspect or side, rather he alone rules over all. Needless to say there is no domain that opposes him G-d forbid, rather he himself created good and negative forces, as it says (Isaiah 45:7), \"The maker of light and creator of darkness, maker of peace and creator of evil, I am HaShem them maker of all these.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The words that were substituted in the blessing for \"maker of peace and Creator of evil\" - \"maker of peace and Creator of everything\" - do the job in a pinch, but, arguably, dampen the power of \"Hear, Israel ... the Lord is One.\" <em>Isaiah did not replace \"evil\" with \"everything\" because he understood that embracing the specific idea that God created Evil is the sine qua non in understanding  ה׳ אחד.</em> I find it strange that the verse in Navi in essentially the same context uses the word \"evil,\" but somehow it is not appropriate for a prayer book! In the balance, why did Chazal feel that avoiding the mention \"evil\" in a blessing is <strong>more important</strong> than articulating the Shema with the unequivocal understanding that evil (called out specifically by name, and not made part of a general \"everything\") is subsumed by the One God?</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, such people are included among those who deny the Torah, because they relate to the words of Torah as if they are cures for the body, when, in fact, they are cures for the soul, as [Proverbs 3:22] states: \"And they shall be life for your soul.\"\nIt is, however, permitted for a healthy person to read verses [from the Bible] or chapters from Psalms so that the merit of reading them will protect him and save him from difficulties and injury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not all of tehilim are prayers.</p>\n<p>Typically tehilim is recited to cure an undesirable situation rather than head one off.</p>\n<p>I would imagine (altho not explicit) that if \"the merit of their reading\" is being invoked vs them being used magically then it may be used even in the first few cases mentioned by Rambam, with the converse true as well (altho why motivation isn't posited as the diffentiating halachic factor isn't clear).</p>\n<p>Folks nowadays seem to just read it without too much comprehension ostensibly using it as a segulah and presumably running afoul of this halacha and severe censure.</p>\n<p>Anyone know what's up with that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My answer is based on a book entitled Kavana: Directing the Heart in Jewish Prayer by Seth Kadish (Aronson Press). It’s hard to distill a specific quote to address the question but in Part 2 Chapter 7 he explains how the current state of how many Jews pray, namely by rote and without knowing it’s meaning, is ironically an outgrowth of the mystical approach to Kavana.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kadish identifies 3 forms of prayer: simple, rational, and mystical. The mystical form of prayer basically views the words of prayer as codes or tools that operate the machinery of the universe. Through various formulaic structures and intentions one can tap into and manipulate, as it were, the divine sefiros. In this approach prayer is less about the emotional relationship between the one praying and the divine and more about saying the words correctly and in their proper order in order to get the formula correct. On page 239 Kadish writes: “but historically, kabbalistic prayer became a disadvantage for those not capable of mastering the Kavvanot. Eventually, the common people were taught that the Hebrew words themselves had certain mystical powers when recited, even without the kavvanot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Tehillim should be said as a merit for whatever is being prayed for. The reason why it is picked over anything else is because reading it without understanding is considered beneficial (as opposed to other things, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 2:13</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.1.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehillim 1:5</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יהיו לרצון אמרי פי. יעשו לדורות ויכתבו לדורות אמרי פי ויחוקקו לדורות. ולא יהיו קורין בהם כקורין בספרים אלא יהיו קורין בהן ונוטלין שכר עליהם כנגעים ואהלות</p>\n<p>Let the words of my mouth be acceptable. May the sayings of my mouth be made for generations, written for generations and engraved for generations.

In addition to which Rambam does not even mention any suggested arm windings—let alone 7.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Manoach (ad loc.) suggests that this may be an enactment by the Geonim, so that the Tefillin strap remains in place. Here is the text of his words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואיפשר לומר שתקנת הגאונים הוא, כדי שלא תשמט הרצועה למעלה, וכל רצועה\nהנכרכת שלש כריכות וקשר אחד, לא במהרה תשמט, כדכתיב (קהלת ד יב) והחוט\nהמשולש לא במהרה ינתק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is unclear whether according to the Rambam in H. Tefillin 3:12 one must actually tie the strap down to the finger, i.e. wear it that way. The straightforward reading of H. Tefillin 3:12 indicates that his reference is merely to the required measure of the strap.</p>\n<p>Indeed we see in a responsum (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1731&pgnum=27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">no. 159 in vol. 2 of the Blau ed.</a>) where he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>?זה הקשר על אצבעו שאחרי הכריכות שאם הוא מחייב בהכרח אם לאו</p>\n<p>This knot upon the finger after the windings [of the arm] are they\ndefinitively obligatory or not?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to which the Rambam responds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרצועה על האצבע היא אחר הברכה ובה תהיה קשירה תמה. ואין הקשר על האצבע מוכרח</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The strap on the finger is after the blessing and a complete tying is thereby effectuated. And the tying on the finger is not definitively required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, this is widely presumed to be the basis for wrapping it three times around the finger, which generates your query - where does the Rambam get that from?</p>\n<p>The Kesef Mishneh on Tefillin 3:12 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה שרבינו מפרש אצבע צרידא אצבע אמצעי וברצועה של יד מיירי וקטר ליה\nומתלית ליה היינו קשר באצבע צרידא ומתלית פירוש קושר סביב אצבעו ג\"פ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Suggesting that the Rambam explains the Gemara (Menahoth 35b) where R. Aha b. Ya'aqobh would tie and plait them (קטר להו ומתלית להו) to mean that he tied it around his finger three times.</p>\n<p>It is unclear if the KM intends that מתלית is being literally interpreted by the Rambam as indicating three (i.e. as משליש making an etymological argument) or that the Rambam is defining a plait (מתלית) as something wrapped/tied three times.</p>\n<p>If there was any ambiguity however, the earlier Mordekhai (on 3:12) explicitly makes it an etymological suggestion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אי נמי מתלית כמו משלש והיא היא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbenu Manoah however did not read it in this novel way (nor do most others) and therefore remains perplexed. On 3:12 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואכתי שלוש כריכות למה ואפשר לומר שתקנת הגאונים היא כדי שלא תשמט הרצועה\nלמעלה כנראה בקיבורת וכל רצועה הנכרכת שלש כריכות וקשר אחד לא במהרה תשמט\nכדכתיב קהלת ד והחוט המשולש לא במהרה ינתק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbenu Manoah here suggests that perhaps it is a Geonic enactment that was instituted to prevent the strap from coming loose - finding an allusion to the strength of such a knot in Qoheleth 4:12 \"a threefold cord is not quickly broken\"</p>\n<p>Finding an explicit Geonic source corroborating Rabbenu Manoah's speculation remains a desideratum. I'll update if I come across anything else.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was Avraham chosen?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Moshe is introduced to us with a dramatic story complete with three times that he took a brave stand in the face of injustice which presumably serve to explain to us why he was chosen to lead us as the most important requirement for a leader is loving justice with the bravery and courage to protect the oppressed.</p>\n<p>On the other hand we are given absolutely no back story or reason for why Avraham was chosen to head up God's new nation which presumably should require more of an explanation so that it shouldn't look arbitrary vis a vis the other nations.</p>\n<p>(The famous midrashim are presumably attempts to help explain this otherwise mysterious election.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>That's what <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/4543096/jewish/Lech-Lecha-The-Birth-of-Our-People.htm#lt=both\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this sicha</a> is all about.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: we are given no backstory to Avraham, even though there is plenty in midrashim, because the Torah wants to emphasise that the choice of Avraham is purely Hashem's initiative, and this is indicative of the special relationship Jews have with Hashem: it is not based on our merits or effort. Hashem commanded Avraham, and thereby drew Avraham to Him. Avraham performed Hashem's will, and thus connected to Him, unlike when non-Jews peform their mitzvot, which are merely there to refine them, but not to connect to Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the question of OP it is clear that the role of Avraham in the development of the Jewish nation is significantly different from that of Moshe Rabbeinu, for we do not find in the story of Avraham the same qualities that we find in Moshe!</p>\n<p>To answer why, one can reflect on the meaning of sefiros as a hint that there are 7 (or maybe more) different roles that a man can have in life. Chesed of Avraham signifies his role of a perfect <em>father</em> of the nation. Netzach of Moshe signifies his role of a perfect <em>leader</em> and <em>teacher</em> of the nation. The verses signify that Avraham was trustworthy with Hashem so that the children could trust him, he performed all mitzvos, he loved and cared for all his children, he taught his children the Torah, all people loved and respected him. Avraham loved all good people despite disagreements more (story of S'dom) than he hated the bad people from whom he separated early on. Even Avraham's description of himself as \"dust and ashes\" is an example of a father who cares for his legacy among all descendands, not all of whom will be leaders, kings, or heros.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Certainly one can also talk about gevurah of Yitzchak signifying him being a perfect <em>husband</em>, tiferes of Yaakov signifying him being a perfect <em>son</em>, hod of Aharon signifying him as being a perfect <em>student</em>, yesod of Yosef signifying him as being a perfect <em>benefactor</em> and <em>supporter</em>, and finally malchus of David signifying him being a perfect <em>king</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

This is why Scripture uses a different expression when referring to his death by writing ואיננו “and he was not”, meaning, he was not in the world to complete the number of his years.\"</p>\n<p><em>But the general rule is to judge mankind based on their present actions only and not the future.

Although Ishmael and his descendants would act wickedly in the future, his prayer was heard and answered because he was innocent at the time.</p>\n<p>Why was Chanoch's future looked at when God decided his fate? He may have been predisposed to doing future evil but he had not at the time of his departure. Is there a distinction between meting out present punishment (Yishmael) vs 'penalizing' someone in the present for the sake of greater, ultimate good (Chanoch's early departure NOT being the stuff of an adjudication of Evil, but more of a reward)?</p>\n\n\n",

He was summoned before God. “I have a\nquestion for you, Hayim,” God said. “Yes, sir,” Hayim replied,\nsomewhat overawed. “How did you live your life?” God continued. “Well,\nsir,” Hayim responded, “I recognized that a pious person does not seek\npleasure.

I never drank alcohol, I never drank wine, walked in gardens\nadmiring flowers, ate sweets and most fruits. I avoided all sweets,\nand I spent most of my days reading and rereading the Talmud, the\nTorah, and praying at the synagogue.”</p>\n<p>There was a moment of silence. Then  God becomes angry. God spoke in\nanger. “After careful deliberation, I created a pleasurable world for\nhumans to enjoy. I gave them red and white wine with pleasing colors,\nsmells, and tastes that wine experts appreciate before drinking. I\ngave fruits delightful colors to attract people and did the same for\nflowers. I created the world and made it possible for all living\nthings to enjoy it. Yet, you, Hayim, insult me by rejecting my gifts!\nYou are saying that what I did was senseless.”</p>\n<p>God then surprised Hayim by slapping his face hard. And surprised him\neven more by what He did next. He faced God's wrath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This story is, of course, a parable. God does not become angry because, as Maimonides said, God does not have emotions. But the parable brings a clear message: enjoy the gifts of God. Chassidic masters would spend hours studying flowers as they bloomed. You could even sit by a lake and admire the ducks.</p>\n<p>One of the finest scenes of religious contemplation is walking into the woods and fields, and lofty forest. Walking through waving of tall grass, hearing the roll of mighty rivers, and listening to the melody of birds.

He needs no lesser cathedral!</p>\n<p>We should enjoy nature. And show gratitude and admiration. We need to appreciate the creation. Do we not see a fair creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born⁠? A world, that cost us nothing? Is it we that light up the sun; that pour down the rain; and fill the earth with abundance? Whether we sleep or wake, the vast machinery of the universe still goes on. Are these things, and the blessings they indicate in the future, nothing to, us?</p>\n<p>God created the world for humans to enjoy. God wants us to enjoy all that God has made.

One of the forms of Bal Tosif is adding on to how an existing mitzvah is performed, which this seems to fall under.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to this article the Talmud explicitly states that Brit milah without metzitzah is valid, and it isn’t an essential aspect of the mitzvah in either the Talmud or the views of major Poskim (read article for sources).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This article is written in an imprecise way that does not support its contentions and is intended to persuade a wider audience. It is not written with the precision that a poseq would approach this issue. It is written as a politician attempting to sway the masses.</p>\n<p>Yes, the Gemara says that if a mohel FORGOT to perform mesisah, the milah is still valid. The most straightfoward understanding of that, is that bediebhed (ex post facto), if it was not done then there's no problem. That does not mean that lekhathilah it ought be absented. Indeed the Gemara teaches that a mohel that does not perform mesisah should be removed from his post. He is not to be appointed to perform this miswah. If this action was not something Hazal understood as necessary action they would not have insisted that a mohel be removed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even the specific oral method used for blood removal isn’t mentioned in the Talmud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is true. Though this was traditionally done with the mouth - the Hakhamim never explicitly specified through what method this mesisah (drawing of blood) is to be accomplished. Accordingly later decisors found room to permit drawing it via other methods (suctioning device, straw, sponge, etc.). Notably those that permit these alternative methods, are tacitly endorsing mesisah and confirming that it is lekhathilah mandatory. On the flip side of that position is the more stringent position, which would be that even though the text of the Talmud does not specify a method - we know via mesorah what method was is to be employed. That where mesisah is read, implicit is that it is oral, i.e. that the word mesisah always in and of itself means drawing orally. We can argue all we want on that, but either way - both agree that mesisah is lekhathilah mandatory.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It also mentions how some people view it as an essential part of the mitzvah, a Halacha Lemoshe Misinai</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Correct, there are some who maintain that this action is HLMM. Most notably R. Ya'aqobh Etlinger, though this is widely understood to be a reactionary statement in defense of Orthodoxy against the Reform movement in the 19th c. During that time people such as the Hatham Sofer often overstated the severity or significance of a practice in order to defend it against those members of the Reform that sought to eliminate it altogether. Thus famous statements such as the Hatham Sofer stating \"hadash asur min ha-Torah\" that that which is new/deviates from the traditional way is prohibited by the Torah (in its original context hadash refers to the prohibition of eating new grain). Shu\"T Mahari Asad also records a letter from the Hatham Sofer to R. Sebhi Hirsch Hayeth in which he advocates for \"elevating a prohibition\" in order to defend against Reform oversteps. So while we may argue about whether mesisah is/was intentionally being overstated as HLMM (and whether that's a good tact) - either way it is and has been widely understood as lekhathilah mandatory.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>some have even gone so far as to INVALIDATE Brit milah against the Talmud’s ruling</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those that do so are invalidating it where mesisah has INTENTIONALLY been absented from the process. This position need not be interpreted as being in variance with the Gemara which permits it after the fact where it has been forgotten. The Gemara does not endorse consciously and willfully neglecting mesisah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, quoting the Chatam Sofer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the teshubha in its entirety. It is clear that he maintains that mesisah must be performed. It is not elective (even if the milah is valid ex-post facto where not performed). The aspect that he permits variation on is whether it must be done orally. He maintains that the insistence on it being done orally is primarily a preoccupation based on sod (mysticism), which as an Oberlander is not so much a part of their halakhic methodology. Since the Gemara does not explicitly specify that it be done orally, he therefore permits mesisah via other methods that doctors agree can accomplish the same effect.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My question is, why isn’t this clearly Bal Tosif? This seems like adding on to a commandment a non essential feature, which is prohibited. One of the forms of Bal Tosif is adding on to how an existing mitzvah is performed, which this seems to fall under.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is clear that mesisah is widely understood as mandatory. There are debates about whether the obligation stems from the miswah of milah itself or whether it was solely instituted due to sakkanah.</p>\n<p>If you hold that it is an aspect of the miswah itself, then it goes without saying it ought be done. This does not mean that if it is absent the miswah was not accomplished - rather that it was accomplished in a sub-optimal manner and is still valid after the fact.</p>\n<p>If you hold that it is due to sakkanah, then you can still maintain that it is part of the miswah - and that sakkanah is the reason why it is an aspect of the structure of the miswah. Alternatively, you can hold that it is not part of the miswah itself but is nevertheless obligatory as it is a function of rabbinic legislation.</p>\n<p>Again, whether it is an actual aspect of the miswah or it was a rabbinic enactment - we've seen mesisah treated as obligatory. Now, as for <em>how</em> it ought be performed. Some argue that mesisah must be performed orally, as this is definitionally what mesisah always was - that mesisah IS mesisah b'peh. For this position nothing is being \"added\" - the claim is that this method was always a part of the miswah and that we know that based on mesorah. Others have argued, that even though that is how it was traditionally performed through centuries prior, the oral method of mesisah was never formally intended to be construed as obligatory. Mesisah according to this, is a description of what is accomplished - and it may be accomplished through any medically condoned means. Again, nothing is being added here.</p>\n<p>So bal tosif shouldn’t apply here</p>\n\n\n",

At the end of this period, the worker sought to return home, and asked for his wages on Erev Yom Kippur. The employer apologised saying that there was no money with which to pay him. Knowing that his employer was wealthy, the worker asked for payment in produce. Once again, none was available. The worker tried asking for land, animals, pillows and blankets and received the same negative response each time. Without any other choice, the man left and returned home. After Yom Tov, his employer arrived with a wagon laden with food, drink and more. The landowner asked him what he really thought when he said he was unable to pay. The worker answered that presumably all his money had been spent on inventory, the animals and land had probably been rented out to others, the produce was possibly not properly tithed and the bedding etc. had been consecrated making it hekdesh. The employer stated that this was indeed the case, and in the same way that the worker was dan lechaf zechus, so too Hashem should be with him.</p>\n<p>The mefarshim there, teach that this worker was none other than Rabbi Akiva (E.g. the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1138&st=&pgnum=157&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rama MiPano siman 63</a>.

He said to them: I specifically used that wording, as this one, a donkey, bites and breaks bones, and that one, a dog, bites but does not break bones.

Often the moral of the story is that wishful thinking is not enough, and the wish for \"world peace\" (or whatever) backfires in some way, because it wasn't well thought-out.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This then led me to try and think of examples in the Torah and our traditions of \"wishes\" made by our forefathers and sages, whether personal or for the whole world.

Perhaps there is a maloch who is responsible for ensuring that when force acts on an object, it moves?</p>\n<p>I'm imagining this sort of malochim as not being anything like what we'd recognise as human or necessarily even as a being, but just as a non-corporeal thing that has a job to keep the Universe running.

And they are divided [further] into two\ncategories. <strong>The first is called powers</strong> (כחות) and the second is called\nangels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Possibly, powers are close to what you are describing? A basic description he gives is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there are ethereal powers above, corresponding to everything that is\nfound among the lower beings. It is from them that things unfold and\nproceed in a single line of cause and effect decreed by His wisdom,\nmay He be blessed. The lower beings - they, their occurrences and\ntheir existence - are rooted in these powers; so these lower beings\nare extensions and effects of these powers. And one is connected to\nthe other, like rings of a chain [of causation].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And futher explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In truth, the main existence of the world and its true state [occurs]\nthrough these higher powers. And the effects of that which [occurs\nwith] them is [what occurs] to the lower physical beings. And this is\nwhether it is beginning its creation, or it is developing as time\npasses. And this means that according to what is created from these\npowers, the order in which they are set and the limits that have been\nset up, that is what unfolds afterwards according to the axiom of\nunfolding that the Creator, may His name be blessed, willed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It should be noted that the \"software\" mashal is incomplete, because mankind (one of the effects of these powers) can reverse the chain of cause and effect, and actually bring about changes in the powers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But note that the Master, blessed be He, has arranged that all matters\nupon which man has free choice will move the [higher] powers according\nto the measure and the level that He established.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He doesn't go into much more than this, or describe whether these powers are living intellects, or just inert subroutines in creation. Perhaps the former is implied in the final paragraph of ibid 1:5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless for every one of these matters, there are surely\nsupervisors of the angelic specie appointed, as we explained above, to\nput the thing into effect into physicality - whether for the good, or\nnot for the good. <strong>And behold these are His servants</strong>, may He be\nblessed, who preform His word. As so did He will and arrange that His\ndecrees go out into action through His angels, according to what He\nordered and gave over to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is ostensibly saying this in <em>contrast</em> to the powers, which he never describes as Hashem's \"servants\".</p>\n<hr />\n<p>FWIW, I have seen sources that I can't recall, as well as my general impression of these matters, that these powers are not inert, but very lofty <em>living</em> spiritual beings.</p>\n\n\n",

When he is ill for two or three days, he settles matters between his children.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The famous associated idea was that a person would sneeze and their life would leave them, thus Asusa / Gesundheit. The think Yaakov asked for is mortal illness, rather than sudden death. And blindness, while something that could be called an illness, is not mortal, and wouldn't necessarily prompt someone to take stock and settle his worldly matters.</p>\n<p>It is not that no one ever became sick at all beforehand.

Rather, it was the kind of sickness leading to death.</p>\n<p>In terms of your first question, Yitzchak didn't ask for general suffering, as if no one else before him had suffered. As you mention, people struggled with livelihood. Surely the people of Sodom, captured by enemy kings, suffered. There was famine that caused Avraham to visit Egypt.</p>\n<p>Rather, the request was \"Master of the universe, a person dies without suffering, the attribute of justice is outstretched against him.

Essentially, I am curious as to what the earliest evidence there is for someone having direct external knowledge of the Talmud.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems to me that you are looking for Geonic material (Saboraic writings would be interpolated into the Talmud itself). In Simhah Assaf's Tequfath ha-Geonim we-Sifrutah he writes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JOPgE.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JOPgE.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>In short that it is difficult to pinpoint precisely the beginning of Geonic literature, but those of the Suran Gaon, R. Sheshnah (before 689 CE) are of the earliest responsa we have. The larger more compositional type works come to us from the 8th century CE.</p>\n<p>R. Sheshnah Gaon is seen by some as the last of the Saboraim and among others as the first of the Geonim. So he may be seen as a bridge between the periods. Among those teshubhoth of his that are extant several can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaGeonim_(Shaarei_Teshuva)?tab=contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'arei Teshubhah, Teshubhoth ha-Geonim</a>. He explores topics such as Tefillin on 9 Abh (no. 155 and no. 266), whether the reader may say anything other than what's written while the Sefer Torah is open (no. 350), or reading any word not written therein (no. 351).</p>\n<p>If you are interested in the topic generally, Assaf's work is excellent, as well as the more recent work by Robert Brody \"The Geonim of Babylonia and the Shaping of Medieval Jewish Culture\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is a work by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahai_of_Shabha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Achai Gaon</a> called שאילתות דרב אחאי גאון, which was composed in the mid-8th century, not long after the redaction of the gemara, and it mentions the gemara many times.</p>\n<p>It is on Sefaria <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sheiltot_d%27Rav_Achai_Gaon?tab=contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>He is recognised as the \"first Rabbinic author after the Gemara\" in academic works* (which are out of date and could benefit from looking up <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/139473/31534\">@Deuteronomy's answer</a> and quoted sources!), and was actually situated, along with many other early Geonim, in the same academies where the Amoraic discussions were made and noted, and finally redacted into the Talmud.</p>\n<p>Therefore the work itself is all that is \"external\", external to the Talmud itself. Saying that the Gaon had \"external knowledge\" (OP wording) is more questionable, as that could imply someone outside the Babylonian Academies where the Talmud was born, and still sitting on the shelves :)</p>\n<p><sup>* Encyclopædia Britannica. Vol. 1 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. p. 429 </sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>One reasonably early discussion of both the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds comes from the Letter of Baboi, a mid-8th century composition. Monika Amsler describes it as follows;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The traditional explanation for a considerable temporal gap between\nthe two Talmuds is based on the “Letter of Baboi” (mid-eighth\ncentury). In this letter, Baboi claimed that the Palestinian rabbis\nhad been forced to write down their knowledge because of the political\ninstability of Palestine, whereas the Babylonian rabbis continued to\nadhere to oral transmission. In Baboi’s opinion, this rendered the\nPalestinian Talmud inferior to the Babylonian one. The letter is\nspurred by the ongoing theological discussions about the superiority\nof the unwritten in Baghdad at the time.77 Still, Baboi’s letter left\nposterity with the notion “that literary production is a rearguard\naction, a textual encapsulation – and in the case of the Palestinian\nTalmud, a hasty and haphazard one – of a once vibrant tradition put in\njeopardy by outside forces or by unfulfilled messianic\nexpectations.”78 (Amsler, <em>The Babylonian Talmud and Late Antique Book Culture, Cambridge 2023</em>, pg. 128)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, there is an even earlier reference. I have come across a near-quotation of the Talmud in the Qur'an first pointed out by Abraham Geiger (1810-1874), which is widely agreed to have reached its current textual form by the end of the mid-7th century or 650 at the latest when it was canonized (Van Putten, \"The Grace of God,\" 2019; Hythem Sidky, \"On the regionality of Qurʾānic codices,\" 2021; Joshua Little's lecture in: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8TUNGq8zQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN8TUNGq8zQ</a>). Namely:</p>\n<p>Q 5:32: Because of that <em>We ordained for the Children of Israel: that whoever kills a person—unless it is for murder or corruption on earth—it is as if he killed the whole of mankind; and whoever saves it, it is as if he saved the whole of mankind.</em> Our messengers came to them with clarifications, but even after that, many of them continue to commit excesses in the land.</p>\n<p>This is how the tradition appears in the Palestinian Talmud:</p>\n<p>PT: For this reason man was created along to teach you that whosoever destroys a single soul Scripture imputes (guilt) to him as though he had destroyed a complete world, and whosoever preserves a single soul, Scripture ascribes merit to him as though he had preserved a complete world.</p>\n<p>The version in the Babylonian Talmud is slightly different, specifying that this only applies to a soul killed or saved in Israel. This comparison is discussed by Professor Holger Zellentin in a 2022 lecture \"The Arabian Qur'an Between the Bible and Byzantium\" in a symposium called <em>Unlocking the Byzantine Quran</em> (the name being a bit of a play on the name of a previous symposium titled <em>Unlocking the Medinan Quran</em>). You can find the whole thing here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f6pC7AfSOI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f6pC7AfSOI</a> (see 14min-20min). That this type of familiarity might have existed is no surprise, as the Qur'an itself mentions Jews, the \"People of the Scripture\" (or \"scripture people\"), the \"Children of Israel\", rabbis (Q 9:31), synagogues (Q 22:40), and even \"scholars of the Children of Israel\", that is, biblical scholars (Q 26:197). See Holger Zellentin, \"banū isrāʾīl, ahl al-kitāb, al-yahūd wa-l-naṣārā: The Qur'anic Community's Encounters with Jews and Christians\", Entangled Religions 2023.</p>\n<p>The Qur'an also demonstrates other evidence of knowledge of Talmudic traditions, although none as direct as this case. A small sampling: raising a mountain above a people (Q 2:63 / b. Shabbat 88a), a divorced women must wait three months before remarrying (Q 2:228 / m. Yevamot 4:10), the requirement for a multiplicity of witnesses to make an adultery conviction (four in Q 4:15; two in Sota 2a), a command not to pray while drunk but that you may perform an ablution with ground if water is unavailable (Q 4:43; b. Berakoth 15a, 31b). References to these are in Gabriel Said Reynolds' <em>The Quran and the Bible</em> (Yale 2018) and Haggai Mazuz's book <em>The Religious and Spiritual Life of the Jews of Medina</em> (Brill 2014). Here are a few other comparisons compiled from some other academic works. The Qur'an strongly forbids associating anything with God, <em>shirk</em>. Angelika Neuwirth has compared this to bSuk 45b: \"Whoever associates (meshattef) something else with the God of heaven, is excluded from the coming world\" (Neuwirth, The Qur'an and Late Antiquity, Oxford 2019, pg. 206). Qur'anic guidelines on how a husband should deal with a wife that he suspects of infidelity in Q 4:34 are found prior in m. Sotah 1.1-4 (Saqib Hussain, \"The Bitter Lot of the Rebellious Wife: Hierarchy, Obedience, and Punishment in Q. 4:34\", Journal of Qur’anic Studies, 2021, esp. pp. 89-91). Finally, I note Shari Lowin's 2019 study \"\"The Jews Say the Hand of God is Chained\": Q. 5:64 as a response to a midrash in a piyyut by R. El`azar ha-Kallir\".</p>\n\n\n",

My desktop dictionary defines hybrid as “the offspring produced by breeding plants or animals of different varieties, species, or races.” <strong>Hybridization always involves making changes in the DNA of a species; most instances of kilayim do not</strong>. Planting seeds of different species in close proximity does not affect their genetic makeup – thus, technically, no hybridization transpires — yet it may be prohibited min haTorah. Similarly, wearing a garment manufactured from woolen and linen thread does not affect the two parent species or the DNA of the thread in the slightest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another good introductory piece is provided by Ariel Caplan <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/genetic-engineering-in-halacha-part-1-by-ariel-caplan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In his Part 2 <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/genetic-engineering-in-halacha-part-2-by-ariel-caplan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> he helps to break down the issues at hand.</p>\n<p>As far as the genetic engineering of animals, he points to the Chazon Ish:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding crossbreeding animals, however, Chazon Ish takes a very different tack. <strong>He writes that artificial insemination is completely permitted, as actual mating is the only act prohibited as Kilayim of animals</strong>. It is clear from this ruling that transferring genes between animals would not constitute a violation of Kilayim, as no action of mating is involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He notes that there would be a difference in halacha viz-a-viz genetic engineering of animals vs plants:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The difference stems from the language used in the Pasuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.19?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">VaYikra 19:19</a>: “Do not breed your animal as Kilayim, do not plant your field as Kilayim.” <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1595&st=&pgnum=296&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Shlomo Zalman</a> notes that the Torah focuses on the animals in the context of Kilayim of animals, whereas regarding Kilayim of plants the Torah focuses on the field itself being sown with multiple species. <strong>Hence, he concludes that only the union of two separate animal bodies would constitute a violation of Kilayim of animals, while Kilayim of plants is violated wherever a field is planted with two species</strong>. To frame the distinction in more conceptual terms, we might state that Kilayim of animals is defined by the action of mating two animals, while Kilayim of plants is defined by the result of two species planted in the same location.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So like the Chazon Ish, Rav Shlomo Zalman allows genetic engineering of animals and it would seem that the genetic engineering of plants poses a much greater halachic problem.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is Egypt really a Kur HaBarzel which has the power of cleansing the Gold (Jewish People)?",
    "content": "# Is Egypt really a Kur HaBarzel which has the power of cleansing the Gold (Jewish People)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Devarim 4:20</strong>- <em>Rashi מכור — a כור is a vessel in which one refines gold.</em></p>\n<p>Explaing that Egypt was as the Torah describes a Kur HaBarzel, an iron crucible, which has the power, explains Rashi to purify gold and remove all dross that is found in it. So too the Jewish people are like gold that needed a fiery cleansing experience which would prepare them to receive the Torah. As Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg, in HaKt’av V’HaKabbalah explains that God’s true purpose behind the Egyptian slavery was to purify the Jewish people [of their baser characteristics], just as gold is purified in a crucible. He wanted to remove the base metals so that only pure gold would remain.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Zohar (the mystical interpretation on the Bible) tells us that over the years and centuries of enslavement, the Jews in Egypt had reached the 49th level of impurity, one level away from oblivion. Had they sunken any more into their impurities, they would have been totally irredeemable. Therefore, once the redemption was announced, the Israelites had to leave Egypt post-haste, before they were contaminated any further. <strong>(Zohar Hachadash, Yitro 31a; Ohr Hachayim, Shemot 3:8)</strong></p>\n<p>If the slavery of Egypt is a <em>\"Process of Purification\"</em>, why did the Jews degraded to the 49th level of impurity (one level away from oblivion)?</p>\n<p>How come a brutal and violence filled country like Egypt can be a purification vessel from which comes out a Holy Nation (who were prepared to recieve the Torah)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Thought-provoking question.  Impurity is not necessarily correlated to character.  A woman giving birth or someone taking care of the deceased becomes impure as they are doing a mitzvah.  At the same time that the Jewish people were more and more surrounded by impurity, their faith in G-d and distinctness as a nation grew.\nI understood that the <em>slavery</em> is what purified them, not \"Egypt\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Zohar answers the question. The 50 levels mentioned are the 50 Gates of Binah. These 50 gates are the doors between our intellect and our <em>middot</em>, whereby each <em>midda</em> (character trait and emotion) is generated by what's going on in our intellect. The quality of each gate is the quality of the <em>midda</em> generated: with <em>kedusha</em> or <em>tumah</em>.</p>\n<p>The Zohar in Parashat Emor describes how during the 49 days after leaving Egypt (Sefirat HaOmer), we worked on each one of our Gates of Binah, i.e. refine one character trait and go up a level each day, to the point that we were at the 49th level of <em>kedusha</em> by the time we got to Har Sinai.</p>\n<p>The question the Netivot Shalom (parashat Emor) asks is, why did it only take 49 days? Didn't they have to rise out of the 49 levels of impurity first, and then spend <em>another</em> 49 days climbing the levels of holiness? The answer is that they converted each negative character trait into a positive character trait. This process is a process of refinement indeed, and is the concept of \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/114985/what-are-nitzotzos\">rescuing sparks</a>\" brought by the Zohar and Arizal.</p>\n<p>This is not the full story though, as we are <em>not</em> on the 49th gate of Tumah (I presume?), yet it takes us a life time (or some say, 2000 years) to refine our <em>middot</em>, so how did they do it in 49 days? The answer is the servitude of Egypt (as mentioned by diylmma). <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/133784/what-was-the-kur-habarzel-aspect-of-galus-mitzrayim-and-was-it-effective\">Servitude produces servants</a>. Suffering, denial of autonomy and harsh treatment <em>force</em> a person to break their ego and their addiction to the \"I\" that is the obsession of the animal soul. This restores the natural humility of our intellect, and allows us to more objectively contemplate our <em>middot</em>, and contemplate and become motivated by the needs of others and even excited to respond to those needs, rather than our own needs. This allows us to serve others and emulate Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

One starts learning something, then finds a commentary, and then a reference, and then another sefer, and this leads to more of the same, and before an hour is up, one has learned 10 or 20 smaller points - not necessarily connected - from just as many different sources.</p>\n<p><strong>This is in stark contrast</strong> to what is generally understood as a learning schedule, where each learning session is devoted to one subject or sefer, and is either <em>bekiyus</em> or <em>beiyun</em>, but either way is more focussed and on point. This seems to have more pros and less cons than freeform learning, but that doesn't mean freeform learning doesn't have its own pros (and cons), such as helping one learn when one is tired or unmotivated, or broadening one's general knowledge of Torah etc.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>My question is, is there any discussion of this more freeform learning style anywhere? Is it discouraged? Is it encouraged? If the latter, how much time or what percentage of one's learning can be freeform like this? Does this \"style\" of learning have a more formal name?</p>\n<p><strong>Basically, is there any place for this form of learning for a serious Ben Torah, and if so, what are the guidelines for engaging in it?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>In today's day and age, with internet, search engines and very integrated Torah websites, it is much easier to engage in this type of learning than ever before, so it would be good to bring sources about it and comment about it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What was the main purpose of the Exodus?",
    "content": "# What was the main purpose of the Exodus?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From some pesukim it seems that the main purpose of yetzias mitzrayim was to provide relief from their burdens and bring them to the promised land</p>\n<p>e.g. Shemos 3:8</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וָאֵרֵד לְהַצִּילוֹ מִיַּד מִצְרַיִם וּלְהַעֲלֹתוֹ מִן הָאָרֶץ הַהִוא אֶל אֶרֶץ טוֹבָה וּרְחָבָה אֶל אֶרֶץ זָבַת חָלָב וּדְבָשׁ אֶל מְקוֹם הַכְּנַעֲנִי וְהַחִתִּי וְהָאֱמֹרִי וְהַפְּרִזִּי וְהַחִוִּי וְהַיְבוּסִי.</p>\n<p>I have come down to deliver them from the hand of Egypt and to bring them up from that land to a good and broad land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Emorites, the Perizzites, the Hivvites and the Jebusites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ibid 3:17</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וָאֹמַר אַעֲלֶה אֶתְכֶם מֵעֳנִי מִצְרַיִם אֶל אֶרֶץ הַכְּנַעֲנִי וְהַחִתִּי וְהָאֱמֹרִי וְהַפְּרִזִּי וְהַחִוִּי וְהַיְבוּסִי אֶל אֶרֶץ זָבַת חָלָב וּדְבָשׁ</p>\n<p>and I have said, 'I will take you up from the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Emorites, the Perizzites, the Hivvites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>while from others it seems that the end goal was HaShem dwelling among them and  becoming their God which presumably refers to accepting his Torah</p>\n<p>e.g. ibid 29:46</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְיָדְעוּ כִּי אֲנִי י\"י אֱלֹהֵיהֶם אֲשֶׁר הוֹצֵאתִי אֹתָם מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם לְשׇׁכְנִי בְתוֹכָם אֲנִי י\"י אֱלֹהֵיהֶם.</p>\n<p>And they shall know that I am Hashem, their God, who took them out from the land of Egypt to dwell among them. I am Hashem their God</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vayikrah 22:33</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַמּוֹצִיא אֶתְכֶם מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם לִהְיוֹת לָכֶם לֵאלֹהִים אֲנִי י\"י.</p>\n<p>who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am Hashem.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How to reconcile?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are a couple of pesukim in tehilim 105:43-45</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(מג) וַיּוֹצִ֣א עַמּ֣וֹ בְשָׂשׂ֑וֹן\nבְּ֝רִנָּ֗ה אֶת־בְּחִירָֽיו׃\n(מד) וַיִּתֵּ֣ן לָ֭הֶם אַרְצ֣וֹת גּוֹיִ֑ם\nוַעֲמַ֖ל לְאֻמִּ֣ים יִירָֽשׁוּ׃\n(מה) בַּעֲב֤וּר׀ יִשְׁמְר֣וּ חֻ֭קָּיו\nוְתוֹרֹתָ֥יו יִנְצֹ֗רוּ\nהַֽלְלוּ־יָֽהּ׃</p>\n<p>(43) And He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with singing. (44) And He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labor of the peoples in possession; (45) that they might keep His statutes, and observe His laws. Halleluyah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>that indicate that the ultimate aim of the exodus and being given the land is so that they may observe the Torah (ostensibly the definition of being their God)</p>\n<p>How so? </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Tanakh/Devarim/11.7#m6e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 11</a> instructs the Israelites to keep the Torah in order to be able to survive in the promised land, as the land, when watered with rainfall, is second to none, whereas without rain is unlivable as it does not possess any natural water source (unlike Egypt that has the Nile), and rain is dependent upon Gods favor.</p>\n<p>It seems that the immediate or proximate cause of the exodus was to provide much needed relief from their unremitting labor and to deliver them into a veritable paradise whereas the ultimate or final cause is to have them live a God centered life which is the only way to successfully live on this particular rain dependent—and therefore God dependent—land.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think all of the above falls under one thing: He wanted to become our God. This is the phrase that is repeated all over, in many variations, including in the daily Shema prayer, that He took us out of Egypt in order to be our God.</p>\n<p>This is a statement of relationship. Therefore everything else is connected: He is showing that He is ready to commit to us, by saving us from our burdens, He wants to dwell with us, in the Holy land.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Another explanation on the purpose of Galus Mitzrayim, can be found in the Haggadah Shel Pesach Yad Mitzrayim, written by Rabbi Yitzchak Chaver. In his introduction, called \"Poteach Yad\", he <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/170011/p/20/t/3750109961234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> that the main purpose of Galus Mitzrayim was in order <strong>to build the nation of Yisroel</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נעשה אדם בפני עצמו משא\"כ כשהוא בבסן אמו אז הוא ירך אמו וכמו כן תכלית\nכוונת גלות מצרים היה כדי להשלים בנין האומה הזאת שתהיה ראויה לחול עליה\nשמו יתברך והשראת שכינתו ביחוד נמור בלי שום אמצעי מפסיק ביניהם שהיא\nאמצעות המבע ושליבות המדריגות העליונות כמש\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to be in line with the posuk in Vayikra, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your G-d. I am Hashem</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yitzchak Chaver in his Haggadah explains that the period in Mitzrayim was in order \"to grow as a baby\"- since a fetus needs a dark place in order to develop. Rav Glatstein (Rav Daniel Glatstein on the Haggadah, p. 344) says that there was no place in the world, that was more spiritual darker than Mitzrayim, and thus the perfect place in order to \"grow an nation\".</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21558&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">another version</a> of the Haggadah Shel Pesach from Rabbi Chaver (Drashos Shabbos HaGadol), it's purpose was also to instill faith into the Jewish people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מארצך כו' שכל העולם הוא מסור תחת י\"ב מזלות המנהג הטבעי, והוליכו לארץ הקודש אשר הוא מעולם החדש הנסיי, ועל שעדיין היה בו קצת זוהמא מנחש הקדמוני בחטא של אדה\"ר, לא הוטהר עדיין לגמרי שיהי' ראוי להתנהג ע\"פ עולם הנסיי שהוא תלוי באמונה כמ\"ש, ולזאת נכנס קצת ספק בלבו ואמר במה אדע כי אירשינה שיהיו ישראל זוכים להיות בארץ הלזו ולהתקיים בעולם אשר אין לו שורש במזלות ובטבע כלל, ולזה הוצרך להיות נזדכך שירדו בניו למצרים ושם נשתרשו באמונה כמ\"ש ויאמן העם כו', וכל התחלת הנהגת אבותינו הכל היה ע\"פ ניהוג הנסיי, שע\"ז מתייחס שמו\nיתברך העצמי, משא\"כ עולם הטבעי אשר בו נקרא שם אלקים על שהוא בעל הכוחות כולם ומנהיג העולם ע\"פ שופטים ומושלים רבים כענין הנהגת המדינה ע\"י שרי המלך ופקידיו, שע\"ש כך נקרא הוא מלך אשר מנהיג המדינה ע\"פ חוק המלוכה ונימוסיו הקבועים לו שלא ישנה דבר, כאומרם מלך שמחל על כבודו אין כבודו מחול, כי צריך להנהיג המדינה ע\"פ הנימוס והדת, משא\"כ בבנו היקיר לו אינו מוסרו לשריו ופקידיו אלא הוא משגיח עליו עין בעין ועליו נקרא בשם אחר היינו בשם אביו שמנהיג אותו בעצמו כאב את בנו ירצה ולא ע\"י משפט המלוכה ויכול לעשות עמו כרצונו להענישו ולמחול על עונו ולהטיב לו כפי אשר יחפוץ כענין שאמרו האב שמחל על כבודו כבודו מחול, ודוגמת זה הוא יתברך אשר נקרא אלקי ישראל\nוהם נקראים אצלו בנים כמ\"ש רז\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Gemara asks: This halakha is obvious. Sounding the shofar is a mitzva by Torah law, whereas the additional prayer applies by rabbinic law. A mitzva that applies by Torah law is clearly more important. The Gemara answers: No; this seemingly superfluous ruling is necessary to teach that although in this town it is certain that the additional prayer will be recited and in this other town it is uncertain whether or not the shofar will be sounded, one should still go to the place where they know how to sound the shofar rather than the location where they know how to recite the blessings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is There a Ramban v. Ramchal Debate Regarding the Graspability of the Creation Narrative?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Per the Ramban (based on Rashi) (Genesis 1:1), the purpose of the creation narrative, per Chazal, is to teach us that the Land of Israel belongs to Bnei Yisrael and that God banishes and destroys people unworthy of settling there. If the creation story, however, was simply about the fact of God creating the universe - this could have been accomplished via a single explicit verse. Per the Ramban, the creation narrative qua creation narrative is too befuddling to comprehend.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והסיפור במה שנברא ביום ראשון ומה נעשה ביום שני ושאר הימים, והאריכות ביצירת אדם וחוה, וחטאם ועונשם, וסיפור גן עדן וגירוש אדם ממנו, כי כל זה לא יובן בינה שלימה מן הכתובים. וכל שכן ספור דור המבול והפלגה, שאין הצורך בהם גדול. ויספיק לאנשי התורה בלעדי הכתובים האלה, ויאמינו בכלל בנזכר להם בעשרת הדברות (שמות כ י): <strong>\"כִּי שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים עָשָׂה ה' אֶת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֶת הָאָרֶץ אֶת הַיָּם וְאֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁר בָּם וַיָּנַח בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי\"</strong>, ותישאר הידיעה ליחידים שבהם הלכה למשה מסיני, עם התורה שבעל פה.\nthe narration of what was created on the first day, what was done on the second and other days, as well as a prolonged account of the creation of Adam and Eve, their sin and punishment, and the story of the Garden of Eden and the expulsion of Adam from it, because all this cannot be understood completely from the verses. It is all the more unnecessary for the story of the generations of the flood and of the dispersion to be written in the Torah for there is no great need of these narratives, and, for people who believe in the Torah, it would suffice without these verses. They would believe in the general statement mentioned to them in the Ten Commandments: <strong>For in six days the Eternal made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day</strong>, and the knowledge of the process of creation would remain with individuals as a tradition from Moses who received the law on Sinai together with the Oral Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the Ramchal states it was essential to expressly lay out the creation process step-by-step in great detail, and that the story as presented is not befuddling, but au contraire, proves that God desired to create the universe in a comprehensible manner allowing mankind to interface with God/it and (to some extent) comprehend God/it (this could obviously NOT be accomplished via the pithy \"כִּי שֵׁשֶׁת יָמִים עָשָׂה ה' אֶת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְאֶת הָאָרֶץ אֶת הַיָּם וְאֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁר בָּם וַיָּנַח בַּיּוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי??!!).</p>\n<p>Ramchal Daas Tevunot 40</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א. אבל מפני שרצה הרצון העליון שיוכלו בני אדם להבין קצת מדרכיו ופעולותיו, ואדרבה, רצה שיהיו משתדלים על זה ורודפים אחרי זה מאד, על כן בחר להיות פועל אדרבה בדרך בני האדם, פירוש, בסדר מושג ומובן. והכלל הוא - שרצה לפעול פעולותיו לפי ערך הנבראים, לא לפי ערכו, על כן נתן לנו מקום להתבונן בם, ולהבין לפחות מעט מזעיר, אם לא כביר. והראיה לדבר - מעשה בראשית ככתוב בתורתו, שהרי שם מעיד על עצמו שברא את עולמו בחילוק זמנים, והבדל מאמרות, ובסדר מה שרצה בו, ולא הכל בבת אחת, ולא במאמר אחד שהיה יכול להבראות. ומעתה יש לנו להבחין בכל פעולותיו וטעמיהם, וכל שכן בתולדותיהם, כל הסוגים והמינים והפרטים, ככל הסדר הנשמר בדרכי בני האדם:\nBut because the Heavenly will wanted man to be able to understand a small part of His ways and actions, and just the opposite, wanted them [man] to try to do this and to chase after this a great deal, therefor he chose to action in opposite fashion in the ways of man, meaning, in a graspable and understandable order. And the general rule is - that he wanted to act according to the measure of the creations and not according to his measure, therefore he gave us room to contemplate them, and to understand at least a tiny part, if not the enormous [whole]. And the proof of the matter - the act of creation as it is written in our Torah, for there he testifies about Himself that he created his world in divided time periods, and differentiated utterences, and in an order that he wanted, and not all of it in one moment, and not in one utterance with which He could have created. And from now we need to differentiate all his actions and their reasons, and more so their consequences, all the classes and types and details, according to the order which is maintained in the ways of mankind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God and Creation, thus, per the Ramchal, are graspable; the proof being found in the apprehensible process expressed in the creation narrative - a peek into method, not madness; an empowering dialectic of revelation and Oneness. Per the Ramban the narrative, however, is befuddling and thus, less is more - we would be better served by a single sentence about the fact of God's creation had we NOT had THE כח מעשיו/\"Israel is ours\" imperative (which requires many chapters to flesh out). Is there a resolution - can they both agree?</p>\n\n\n",

There are also explanations that explain why Mitzrayim isn't counted as the first one, because it is the root of all the four galuyos <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shem_MiShmuel%2C_Vaera.1.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(see for example Shem MiShmuel, Parshas Vaera, sv. שנת תרע”א)</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I read in the book \"Achake Lo: I Will Await Him\" by Rabbi Yirmiyahu Cohen (p.215), that there is an anonymous commentary on Shir HaShirim that says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. מפירוש כתב יד קדמון מיוצאי תימן על שיר השירים, נדפס מחדש בירושלים בחמש מגילות: השבעתי אתכם בנות ירושלים וגו' (שה\"ש בז). גם זה כבר נתבאר שהוא על דרך הצוואה, שבהיותם בגלות ותחת שלטון זר אל יתפרצו במעשים ופעולות לפני שיגיע הזמן, פן יגרמו לעצמם נזק ואפילו כליון במקום מה שחשבו שתצמח להם טובה ורווחה, אבל כשיהיה הרצון האלקים ויגיע העת ויגמר הזמן אינם זקוקים לפעולה מצדם ולא לעשות שום תחבולה, אלא יסתבבו סבות אלקים להופעת רצונו מה שלא יעלה על דעת בשר ודם אופן אותם הסבות והאיך השגו, ועל זה אמר ישעיה (ב' ב') דברו על לב ירושלים וכו' כי מלאה צבאה כי נרצה עוונה וכו', נשלם הזמן וקבלה את כל העונש שהיתה ראויה לו על כל חטאותיה, ונכפל פסוק זה בספר זה שלש פעמים לחיזוק הענין, <strong>וגם כנגד ג' גליות שהיו ישראל בהם, גלות מצרים וגלות בבל וזה הגלות הכללי הארוך</strong>, ה' - \"I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem...\" This is a command that when the Jews are in exile under a forgein power, they must not burst forth with deeds and actions before the time comes, lest they bring upon themselves harm or even destruction, instead of the good they thought would come of it. But when G-d wills it and the time is up, they will not need their own actions, nor will they need to use any strategy, but rahter G-d will cause things to happen to bring about His will, in a way that no human being can imagine. This is what Yishaya the prophet (40:2) said, \"Speak to the heart of Jerusalem and call to her for her time is up and her sin is atoned\". This verse (\"I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem\") is written three times to hammer in the concept, <strong>and also to correspond to the three exiles: Egypt, Babylonia, and the current lengthy exile, may Hashem show us its end soon.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How to reconcile this, that there are sources that mention only three galuyos instead of the four galuyos? Are there sources that say that there are more/less than the \"traditional accepted\" four galuyos and why is this? I also heard that the Vilna Gaon head an tradition that there are 10 galuyos. So, it seems that there are more views on this.

    "content": "# Was it Permissible for Eve to Smell the Forbidden Fruit/Relax in the Shade of its Tree and/or Enjoy a Forbidden-Fruit-Based Shampoo?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah (Genesis 2:16-17) describes God's prohibition of eating the forbidden tree/fruit. In Genesis 3:3 (per Chazal - see Rashi) Eve adds the additional proscription banning touching the tree/fruit. And she is taken to task by Rashi/Chazal for doing so. But could she, either in reality, or at least pursuant to her own thought process, derive benefit from the fruit -i.e. smell? The verses do not discuss the issue of non-eating benefit.</p>\n<p>This particular question about fragrance assumes a) that the fruit gave off a scent (per Genesis Raba 15:7, the fruit, indeed, was an Etrog) and b) that inhaling that scent is a threshold Halachik form of deriving benefit.</p>\n<p>Another example of prohibited benefit might be for Eve to use the forbidden fruit tree as a source of shade (again I assume that this is a halachik form of deriving benefit).</p>\n<p>Relatedly, what object was actually prohibited by God and subsequently Eve - fruit? Tree? Both? - there are many moving parts here. I would not rush to assume that the bark could not be included in the do-not-eat biblical proscription - if the tree was an etrog, the etrog is famously known for its bark tasting like its fruit (see Midrash Raba quoted above).</p>\n<p>If deriving non-eating benefit was not a problem per God, and Eve did not personally decree an additional safeguard banning smelling the fruit and/or using the tree as source of shade AND all of these activities are halachikally material forms of benefit  ... why not? Can't the act of enjoying the fragrance of the forbidden fruit and/or relaxing in its shade lead to eating it? We already have established that she took prophylactic steps to promulgate a ban on touching the fruit/tree. Why not go the extra step?</p>\n<p>What about making a fruit shampoo or feeding the fruit to a pet - activities which are clearly accepted as acts of deriving benefit?  Biblically\nprohibited? Eve-prohibited due to the fact that these acts involve touching?\nWhat if she directed her pet to the fruit but did not touch the fruit?</p>\n<p>If indeed the scent and/or shade of the forbidden fruit tree were\ntruly biblically prohibited because they are included in the prohibition of eating (see later) and shade and/or scent fall under the rubric if the general no-benefit activities (a lot of assumptions here) it would make sense for her to maintain a proper, cautionary distance from the tree. Yet per Rashi Genesis 3:4, Eve was close enough to be pushed into the tree when she encountered the Snake!?!</p>\n<p>By the way, per Rabbi Abahu in the Talmud I have every reason to believe that the forbidden fruit and/or tree was biblically prohibited from generally deriving benefit from it too (feeding it to one's pet or making a shampoo out of it), but, again, I cannot be certain if odor and shade are within this general ban on benefit (if they are, then perhaps this is why she only added a personal ban on touching the tree/fruit - there was not much left to ban). (Pesachim 21b):</p>\n<p>דְּאָמַר רַבִּי אֲבָהוּ: כׇּל מָקוֹם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר ״לֹא יֵאָכֵל״, ״לֹא תֹאכַל״, ״לֹא תֹאכְלוּ״ — אֶחָד אִיסּוּר אֲכִילָה וְאֶחָד אִיסּוּר הֲנָאָה (מַשְׁמַע)<, עַד שֶׁיִּפְרֹט לְךָ הַכָּתוּב .\nRabbi Abbahu said that wherever it is stated: “It shall not be eaten,” “You, singular, shall not eat,” or “You, plural, shall not eat,” <strong>both a prohibition of eating and a prohibition of deriving benefit are implied,</strong> unless the verse specifies that one may benefit ...</p>\n<p>If the tree/fruit per R. Abahu was truly already biblically prohibited in terms of eating plus deriving general benefit (shampoo and pet food), doesn't touching it provide information/sensory feedback? Isn't this then a form of benefit? Why would Eve need to add this?  Or is this manner of 'benefit' potentially not a real benefit a la shade and odor?</p>\n\n\n",

[See my comments at the end of this answer]</p>\n<p>In a footnote, Tefilla KeHilchasa quotes a ruling from R' Shlomo Zalman Aurebach (in responsa to the author) that if the guests will not be slighted, he can go to daven and tend to his guests post-prayer.

Despite being considered תלמוד תורה כנגד כולם, one must disrupt Torah study to perform any mitzvah that is not possible to be done by someone else. I would personally be hesitant to draw any parrallels to other <em>mitzvos</em>. However, the Chafetz Chaim seems to also base his ruling on the statement of Chazal (Shabbos 127a) - 'גדולה הכנסת אורחים כהשכמת בית המדרש, ור' דימי מנהרדעא אמר יותר מהשכנת בית המדרש', and the subsequent statement 'יותר מקבלת פני השכינה', which may apply to <em>tefillah betzibbur</em> too. I have seen other sefarim who also apply this Ahavas Chessed to <em>tefillah betzibbur</em></p>\n<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Ahavas Chessed (cited above) limits his ruling to situations where nobody else is available to perform the <em>hachnassas orchim</em>, or to distinguished visitors where it is appropriate to host personally rather than delegate to family members. I didn't cite this above, because I think his reasoning would be limited to Talmud Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

(Deuteronomy 5:11)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 5:11</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall not invoke [take] the name of the Lord, your God, in vain. For the Lord will not leave unpunished anyone who invokes his name in vain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have been studying about YHWH,the Hebrew deity, for some years now, but I am confused from time to time also! Did the Hebrew tribesmen (and women) always face a call for death, if they even accidentally spoke the name of their war god outloud?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The answer is no. From the Talmud:</p>\n<p>Yoma 39</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The High Priest mentions the name of God ten times on that day (Yom Kippur): Three\ntimes during the first confession; and three times during the second\nconfession, over the bull; and three times when he confesses over the\nscapegoat to Azazel; and one time with the lots, when placing the lot\nfor God upon the goat. And there already was an incident when the High\nPriest said the name of God and his voice was so strong that it was\nheard even in Jericho.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The prohibition against uttering God's name evolved at the end of the Second Temple period. It is rooted in the commandment not to take God's name in vain, which is related to the law against false swearing and Jesus' teaching not to swear at all. (Matthew 5:34) This developed into a strong tradition among orthodox Jews not speak the name of God. However, the Hebrew Bible is replete with expressions such as \"As יְהֹוָ֖ה [yhwh] lives,\" and \"I called on the name of the יְהֹוָ֖ה.\"(Judges 8:19, Ruth 3:13, 1 Samuel 14:39, Psalm 116:4, etc.)  Later, the Hebrew word יְהֹוָ֖ה  was replaced with terms such as <em>Adonai</em> and <em>Ha-Shem</em> - or The LORD in English. However, the text itself contains no prohibition against pronouncing the Name and it is virtually certain that priests, prophets, temple singers and the people generally did pronounce it. Indeed the Talmud (which is the source of the ban) states that this was once positively encouraged by the sages.</p>\n<p>Berakhot 9:5</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna [the core of the Talmud] relates: ...When the Sadducees strayed and declared that there is\nbut one world and there is no World-to-Come, the Sages instituted that\nat the conclusion of the blessing one recites: 'From everlasting to\neverlasting.' The Sages also instituted that one should greet another\nin the name of God, i.e., <em>one should mention God’s name</em> in his\ngreeting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later tradition did indeed ban pronouncing the Name. However, there is no known case in Jewish history of a person being put to death for this. The <a href=\"https://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13483-shaddai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> explains how pronouncing the name of God came to be seen as a crime in Jewish tradition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Forty years\nprior to the destruction of the Temple, the priests ceased to\npronounce the Name (Yoma39b). From that time the pronunciation of the\nName was prohibited. \"Whoever pronounces the Name forfeits his portion\nin the future world\" (Sanh. xi. 1)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maimonides would later write (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Oaths 12:11):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is not only a false oath that is forbidden. Instead, it is\nforbidden to mention even one of the names designated for G‑d in vain,\neven though one does not take an oath. For the verse commands us, saying:\n“To fear the glorious and awesome name.” Included in fearing [the name] is not to mention it in vain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding accidental utterances, Maimonides said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If because of a slip of the tongue, one mentions [G‑d’s] name in vain,\nhe should immediately hurry to praise, glorify and venerate it, so\nthat it will not have been mentioned in vain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Pronouncing God's name did not always carry a death sentence. No such law exists in the Bible, and Talmudic tradition praises the High Priests who uttered it, as well a recalling a time when the Name was used in everyday greetings. There is no known case of the later Talmudic prohibition being enforced with capital punishment.</p>\n\n\n",

Then Doson and Aviram were waiting outside Paroh's palace to scold Moshe and Aharon.</p>\n<p>How did Dasan and Aviram know right away what Paroh told Moshe?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ramban_on_Exodus.5.22.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban (commentary to Shemot 5:22)</a>, the story described in Shemot Chapter 5 could actually have taken place over many months:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is possible that there was a long period of time to this story recounted here by Scripture. <strong>When the officers of the children of Israel were beaten, days passed until they spoke to Pharaoh himself</strong>, saying to him, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? It is not every person that has a right to come into the inner chambers of the king’s palace and speak to him face to face, and all the more the officers of those people abhorrent to him. <strong>Thus they suffered in their burden and oppression many days, and they would come even before the king’s gate until their outcry was heard before the king and he commanded that they come before him and speak with him</strong>...</p>\n<p>When this was decreed by Pharaoh, <strong>Moses went to Midian and stayed there six months</strong> while Aaron remained in Egypt. At that time, Moses took his wife and sons back to Midian.” The Rabbis have furthermore said: “And they met Moses and Aaron. <strong>After six months, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself to Moses in Midian and said to him, Go, return unto Egypt. Moses then came from Midian, and Aaron from Egypt, when they were met by the officers of Israel as they came forth from Pharaoh.</strong>”</p>\n<p>(<em>Chavel translation, <strong>my emphases</strong></em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this can answer your questions. Datan and Aviram (or whoever the people mentioned in Shemot 5:20 are) only complain to Moshe and Aharon many months after Par'oh's decree. And the foremen couldn't go into Par'oh as they pleased. They had to wait days for permission to speak to him.</p>\n\n\n",

When one is obligated to be exiled. If, however, a person feared that a king will have him executed as is the king's authority, or that the court will execute him as an immediate directive, and fled to the altar and held on to it, he should be saved.</p>\n<p>This applies even if he is a commoner. He should not be taken from the altar to die unless he was sentenced to death because of the testimony of witnesses who delivered a warning, as is always required with regard to those executed by the court.</p>\n<p>So, when a non-Jew kills by mistake and is executed by the court, there's no reason to think that the city of refuge would save him from the court judgement, so seemingly this implies that we would think it saves him from another non-Jew who is a <em>goal hadam</em>.</p>\n<p>But is there any source that says that a non-Jew can be a <em>goal hadam</em>, and therefore be exempt from punishment for killing another non-Jew (who killed his relative)?

The Rambam writes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.10.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Melachim Umilchamos 10:1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֶּן נֹחַ שֶׁשָּׁגַג בְּאַחַת מִמִּצְוֹתָיו פָּטוּר מִכְּלוּם. חוּץ מֵרוֹצֵחַ בִּשְׁגָגָה שֶׁאִם הֲרָגוֹ גּוֹאֵל הַדָּם אֵינוֹ נֶהֱרָג עָלָיו. וְאֵין לוֹ עִיר מִקְלָט. אֲבָל בָּתֵּי דִּינֵיהֶן אֵין מְמִיתִין אוֹתוֹ.</p>\n<p>If a ben Noach violates one of his mitzvos inadvertently, he is exempt from any [punishment], with the exception of <strong>an inadvertent murderer, where a goel hadam is not executed for killing him,</strong> and there is no [asylum in an] ir miklat for him, though their courts don't execute [the original murderer].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in short, the ben Noach accidental killer is in basically the same position as a Jew who killed in an \"accidental manner that is close to deliberate\" (Hil. Rotze'ach 6:5): he's going to have to \"watch his six\" against the goel hadam.</p>\n<p>(As far as the question of a <strong>mitzvah</strong>, note that even when it comes to Jews, the Rambam (Hil.

I.e., in the Holy Language. This is the opinion of the commentators, and it is also the translation of Onkelos. It is possible that Joseph said so to them for plausibility and in order to be conciliatory, for the fact that a person in Egypt speaks the Holy Language is not proof that he is Joseph. It is my opinion that the Holy Language was the language of Canaan for Abraham did not bring it there from Ur of the Chaldees or Haran, as they spoke Aramaic there, as is attested to by \"the heap.\" Now it was not the language of one man alone; rather, it was the language of the entire land of Canaan, and many people in Egypt knew it, since Canaan was nearby.

After that, it seems that gradually Jews started speaking other languages (notably Aramaic), though half a millennium later we still find Rebbi stating that in Eretz Yisrael, one ought to speak either Lashon Kodesh or Greek (Sotah 49b, Bava Kamma 83a), which would hardly be realistic if the former weren't still being spoken at all.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Was it only spoken by the ancient Hebrews and not the surrounding nations? If so how would said nations refer to their \"non Jewish\" rituals/items?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It (or closely related dialects) were indeed spoken by other nations. See Nahum's answer. That said, the way in which it was spoken, as a holy language (especially in view of Rambam's opinion, Moreh Nevuchim 3:8, that it is so called because it doesn't have specific words for bodily functions and other indelicate things), can indeed have been specific to the Jews; there's even an explanation that this is what Chazal mean when they tell us that Pharaoh couldn't learn Lashon Kodesh (when, after all, as per the Ramban quoted by Nahum, there's no reason he wouldn't have known the language of a nearby country).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If so, why don't we have non-religious literature from that period, assuming that Tanach doesn't cover the entirety of Lashon Hakodesh's vocabulary?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DoubleAA put it well in a comment: \"Where would we expect to find any of that? From the secular literature club whose devotees painstakingly copied it for generations with iron age technology?\" The only alternative would be a fortuitous find (similar to the Dead Sea Scrolls, and only in such a climate; in the rest of Eretz Yisrael such writings would long since have rotted away). That said, there are a number of epigraphic finds, such as the inscription on the Shiloach Tunnel, that might be considered literature of a sort. And yes, some of them do contain words not found in Tanach - for example, the Shiloach inscription has the word זדה, otherwise unknown, and suggested to mean \"crack\" or something similar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do Mishnah or other texts introduce new words in Lashon Hakodesh?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure. They borrow lots of words from other languages and Hebraicize them. They also create new words and new forms out of the existing Hebrew stock; the Rambam (commentary to the Mishnah, Terumos 1:1) gives as an example the fact that the Biblical Hebrew noun תרומה yielded in Mishnaic Hebrew the verb תרם (as contrasted with Biblical Hebrew הרים), which in turn is inflected like any other Hebrew verb.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, how did ancient Hebrew speakers discuss intimate actions or mundane items for which Lashon Hakodesh lacks specific words?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They might have made up (or borrowed from other languages) such words, or used the circumlocutions that Lashon Kodesh (in Tanach) does use. Or, per the Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim (cited above), there might well have been a vernacular Hebrew (unrecorded in Tanach) that would have had such words, just that Lashon Kodesh (the specifically holy register of the language) did not.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How righteous is Bathya - The daughter of Pharaoh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The daughter of Pharaoh did not follow her father’s wicked ways, but rather converted and ceased worshiping idols. She was highly praised by the Rabbis, and the midrash includes her among the devout women converts: Hagar, Asenath, Zipporah, Shiphrah, Puah, the daughter of Pharaoh, Rahab, Ruth, and Jael wife of Heber the Kenite (Midrash Tadshe, Ozar ha-Midrashim [ed. Eisenstein], p. 474). The midrash specifically praised the daughter of Pharaoh for her rescue of Moses, thereby aiding in the exodus of all the Israelites from Egypt.</p>\n<p>In the midrashic account, when her handmaidens saw that she intended to rescue Moses, they attempted to dissuade her, and persuade her to heed her father. They said to her: “Our mistress, it is the way of the world that when a king issues a decree, it is not heeded by the entire world, but his children and the members of his household do observe it, and you wish to transgress your father’s decree?” Immediately, Gabriel appeared and beat them to the ground, and they died (BT Sotah 12b). These handmaidens represent the internal voice of the daughter of Pharaoh, who might have been undecided as to whether she should disobey her father’s edict. The angel Gabriel removes this obstacle and reinforces her resolve to draw Moses forth from the Nile.</p>\n<p>“When she opened it, she saw that it [va-tire-hu] was a child […]. She took pity on it.” The Rabbis ask what caused the daughter of Pharaoh to take pity on Moses and keep him alive, contrary to her father’s command. The midrash gives an approach based on the continuation of the verse, that relates that the child’s weeping motivated the daughter of Pharaoh: “She saw that it was a child, a boy crying. She took pity on it.” The Rabbis maintain that divine intervention was needed for the infant to cry, which they learn from a close reading of v. 6. The beginning of the verse refers to Moses as a “child [yeled],” and then calls him a “boy [na’ar],” from which the Rabbis learn that Moses was a yeled, that is, an infant, but he conducted himself as a na’ar (an older child). Thus, when the daughter of Pharaoh opened the ark, Moses, unlike other babies, did not cry. The angel Gabriel immediately came and hit Moses so that he would cry, thereby arousing the compassion of the daughter of Pharaoh (Ex. Rabbah 1:24).</p>\n<p>1.The first question is, if She was really a righteous woman, she should have save the baby even though he doesn't cry? Why did GOD need to perform a miracle for her to cause the Baby cry in order to arouse her pity and compassion?</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If she herself overcomes her inclination (the inner voice or certainly, the handmaids attempting to dissuade her)and saves the baby, She could be praised for the act?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why is she praised if a Miracle caused her to save the baby (as it said, the daughter of Pharaoh suffered from leprosy and she went down to bathe in the water to be cured of her disease.

According to the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38103&st=&pgnum=193&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash HaGadol (Bereishis 23:1)</a> (see bottom of the right column) you can possibly suggest that she was fully aware that she had an important role in raising the redeemer of the Jewish people and so this exercise of walking out by the Nile was feasibly her ensuring that this came to fruition.</p>\n<p>It reads there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותקם בעוד לילה - זו בתיה בת פרעה שראתה ברוח הקודש שעתיד מושיען שלישראל להתגדל על ידיה והיתה משכמת ומערבת היא ונערותיה להטייל על היאור וכיון שבא משה לידה נתן לה הקב\"ה מה שביקשה ושמחה הרבה</p>\n<p>\"She rises while it is still night\" - This is Bisya the daughter of Pharoah that saw with Divine Inspiration that the future redeemer of Israel would be raised by her, and so her and her maidservants would walk by the River (Nile) every morning and evening. And when Moshe came her way, Hashem gave her what she sought, and she rejoiced greatly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She is praised because ultimately it was an act of kindness. Note <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.1.26?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah 26:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתִּקְרָא שְׁמוֹ משֶׁה, <strong>מִכָּאן אַתָּה לָמֵד שְׂכָרָן שֶׁל גּוֹמְלֵי חֲסָדִים</strong>, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהַרְבֵּה שֵׁמוֹת הָיוּ לוֹ לְמשֶׁה, לֹא נִִקְבַּע לוֹ שֵׁם בְּכָל הַתּוֹרָה אֶלָּא כְּמוֹ שֶׁקְּרָאַתּוּ בִּתְיָה בַּת פַּרְעֹה, וְאַף הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא לֹא קְרָאָהוּ בְּשֵׁם אַחֵר</p>\n<p>“She named him Moses” – <strong>from here you learn the reward of those who perform of acts of kindness</strong>. Although Moses had many names, the name that was set for him throughout the Torah was only the one that Batya daughter of Pharaoh called him. Even the Holy One blessed be He did not call him by any other name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note also the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Derekh_Eretz_Zuta.1.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Eretz Zuta 1</a> which notes that she was included in the list of nine people who entered Gan Eden during their lifetimes. An appropriate level of righteousness would surely warrant such a reward.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Do Men of Low Moral Character Care About Reputation/Entering Ruins?",
    "content": "# Do Men of Low Moral Character Care About Reputation/Entering Ruins?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud in Brachot (3a-b) discusses the prohibition of entering a ruin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּנוּ רַבָּנָן, מִפְּנֵי שְׁלֹשָׁה דְּבָרִים אֵין נִכְנָסִין לְחוּרְבָּה: מִפְּנֵי חֲשָׁד, מִפְּנֵי הַמַּפּוֹלֶת, וּמִפְּנֵי הַמַּזִּיקִין. ״מִפְּנֵי חֲשָׁד״,\nThe Sages taught, for three reasons one may not enter a ruin: Because of suspicion of prostitution, because the ruin is liable to collapse, and because of demons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The obvious question is: why three reasons, any one reason would suffice? The Talmud proceeds to explain situations where the other two reasons are moot; thus, the prohibition to enter the ruin still stands because of the remaining one reason. Therefore, each reason is separately needed. One of those permutations involves a ruin whose wall newly collapsed after construction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בִּתְרֵי וּפְרִיצִי. The Gemara answers: If two individuals known to be immoral enter together, there is suspicion even though there are two of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, if two men known to be of low moral character enter a newly collapsed ruin, they need not worry about demons (demons will not attack a pair) nor collapse (because the ruin was newly constructed; thus the rest of the structure is likely sound - only that one collapsed wall was actually defective). But they DO need to worry about their reputations - people will suspect them of a rendezvous with a harlot (such a suspicion is aroused here because a woman cannot be alone in a room with men of low moral character, even as a group, because of their propensity to sin even when in a group).</p>\n<p><em>Why would people of known, low moral character care about such ruin-suspicions?</em> I suppose the same question applies to the law of Yichud (not based on reputation, but an actual law about a man and woman secluding with one another). Per the gemarra, a woman cannot seclude with a group of men of low character because of their propensity to sin with her even when in a group (Kiddushin 80). How about those men? Are they similarly prohibited due to the same laws of Yichud? Do such men care about this law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe the gemara in kiddushin 81a can answer this question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רב ורב יהודה הוו קאזלי באורחא הוה קאזלא ההיא איתתא קמייהו א\"ל רב לרב יהודה דל כרעיך מקמי גיהנם אמר ליה והא מר הוא דאמר בכשרים שפיר דמי אמר ליה מי יימר דבכשרים כגון אנא ואת אלא כגון מאי כגון רבי חנינא בר פפי וחביריו</p>\n<p>The Gemara relates: Rav and Rav Yehuda were walking along the way, and a certain woman was walking ahead of them. Rav said to Rav Yehuda: raise your feet and walk quickly away from Gehenna so that we do not remain secluded with her. Rav Yehuda said to him: but wasn't it you, Master, who said it is permitted in the case of men of fit morals? Rav said to him: who said I referred to men of fit morals such as you and me? Rav Yehuda responded: such as whom? Rav answered: such as Rav Chanina  bar Pappi and his colleagues, who have proven that they can withstand temptation (see Kiddushin 39b - 40a).  All other people are not trusted in this matter</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Translation from sefaria)</p>\n<p>Meaning: most people, even amoraim, do not attain this lofty level of being 'of fit morals'. In fact, later on that same page in the gemara, there are stories of two tanna'im that would have commited the Aveira of gilui arayos had their evil inclination been given permission to cause this sin. This is not a question of people of bad morals versus good, rather of people of good morals versus exceptionally good morals. This is summarised in the saying: \"אין אפוטרופוס לעריות\" - \"there is no steward to restrain intercourse\" (i.e. no one can claim to not be affected by this inclination).</p>\n<p>Therefore, most people aren't considered trustworthy for this purpose, yet they definitely care about their reputation, and don't want to be suspected of having illicit relations.</p>\n<p>Also (in regards to your last question), as  seen in the story above, there is a prohibition (or at least, a problem) for the two men to have yichud with a single woman, and they do, as mentioned in the story, care enough to do something about it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Rema does say that all people are considered k'sherim for this purpose until we have a reason to think otherwise. I'm not sure how he explains the gemara in kiddushin. Either way, the gemara in b'rachos might hold like the gemara in kiddushin seemingly does, and therefore make sense.</p>\n\n\n",

And the reason for this is since the sign of the snake was an allusion to Pharaoh, as I explained, and the sign of the blood is about the waters of the Nile, which was an allusion to the splitting of the Sea of Reeds and the drowning of the Egyptians in it, because both of them were concerning Pharaoh and his people, they were done before their eyes. Those who listen will hear and the intelligent will understand. Indeed, the sign of the hand, which was about Israel and the plague of their punishments and the healing of their repentance he did not do before Pharaoh because it was not relevant to him but was a disgrace for Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Much thanks to Hal Miller for graciously providing his expert translation.

    "content": "# Bitachon: Yaakov Avinu vs David Hamelech\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yaakov Avinu \"feared greatly\" when he faced the prospect of a battle with Eisav (Bereishis 32:8). Rashi ad loc clarifies that Yaakov feared being killed. (I am aware of the Gemara that explains that Yaakov did not want to rely on Hashem's promise of protection because he might have sinned and thus forfeited the promise. But even without any Divine promise at all, what about plain old bitachon and emunah? That is the point I am trying to bring out.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, David Hamelech declared that he has no fear when confronted by armies and war (Tehillim 27:3).</p>\n<p>This seems contradictory, from which we might infer that Yaakov Avinu and David Hamelech had differing approaches to the subject of bitachon, and Yaakov followed the approach that experiencing fear when in danger is fully consistent with faith in G-d.</p>\n<p>Or is there a way to resolve the contradiction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to many commentaries, Yaacov was criticised and even punished for his fear going to battle. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/139078/why-was-yaakov-always-fearful/139084#139084\">this answer</a> for sources, quotes and explanation.</p>\n<p>David, on the other hand, was highly praised for his trust in Hashem, and is held by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.163.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Midrash</a> as the paragon of how to show trust and emuna. Unlike the other 3 Kings quoted in that Midrash, David was able to go into battle himself without fear, swing his sword to cut the enemy, but never for a second believe that anyone other than Hashem is bringing victory.</p>\n<p>So, I'll say you've spotted something genuine, that the commentaries and Oral Torah note. Yaacov was criticised for being too humble and meek before Hashem. It took the Torah and the 40 years in the desert for his children to gain the trust not that Hashem can help, but He <em>will</em> help even if we aren't perfect, because He loves us and is committed to us.</p>\n<p>For a full explanation on how the last paragraph's point was arrived at, see the above quoted answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To answer my own question: Instead of asking why Yaakov Avinu was afraid of war, we should rather ask why David Hamelech declared in Tehillim ch. 27 that he was not afraid of war. Because to the latter question, the Commentators on Tehillim ch. 27 provide answers.</p>\n<p>The Radak says that David declared he is not afraid of armies, even if they outsize his military power, because he has seen many times that Hashem saved him and helped him in battle. Thus, David's confidence is based on his personal experience.</p>\n<p>The Malbim explains that when David stated בזאת אני בוטח, \"In 'this' I trust,\" he was referring to the idea expressed in his immediately following prayer, that he should be granted the privilege of שבתי בבית ה' ולבקר בהיכלו, \"May I spend my time in Hashem's House, and study in His sanctuary.\" (The translation follows the Malbim's commentary.) The Malbim posits that David is expressing here the idea stated by the Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim, that when one's thought is firmly connected to G-d, one enjoys Divine protection.</p>\n<p>It comes out according to the Malbim that David's bitachon is not a given, Hashem's protection is not absolute, but is rather predicated on constant connection to Hashem, for which David fervently prays.</p>\n<p>Yaakov Avinu's fear is thus not in contradiction to David's bitachon.</p>\n<p>This answer fits with the approach of the Chazon Ish in Sefer Emunah v'Bitachon, where he explains that trust in Hashem is not the belief that harsh and dreaded things will not happen, but is rather the confident knowledge that one is in Hashem's hands, and everything is for the good.</p>\n\n\n",

I am aware that there are older Jewish notions found in the Apocrypha and Dead Sea Scrolls that Christianity may have been drawing on, but that largely those traditions did not make it into mainstream Rabbinic thought.\nHowever, I noticed that in Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer, there is a tradition that seems closer to the Christian understanding. Here, the term Palit (fugitive or one who was rescued) is applied to Michael because when the Satan and his supporters were forced out of heaven, the Satan attempted to grab Michael and drag him down as well, but G-d saved him and so he got this nickname.\nDoes anyone have any information about where this narrative might come from or if there are other sources like it elsewhere in Rabbinic Literature?\nThanks!</p>\n\n\n",

Such, indeed, is the method of the Holy One, blessed be He: He brings punishment upon the nations so that Israel may hear of it and fear Him.\".</p>\n<p>This seems problematic, since should it be obvious that G-d gives us the ability to truely return to Him? Why did G-d did not give Pharaoh this option?</p>\n<p>See the Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters.8.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemonah Perakim (chapter 8)</a> in which he says that all what happened to B'nei Yisrael in Mitzrayim was done with free will of the pharaoh:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This they did through the dictates of their own free will and the evil passions of their hearts, without any external constraint forcing them thereto. The punishment which G-d then inflicted upon them was that He withheld from them the power of repentance, so that there should fall upon them that punishment which justice declared should he meted out to them. The fact that they were prevented from repenting manifested itself by Pharaoh's not dismissing them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Siftei Chakhamim on Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is better for Me that his heart be hardened. . . In other words, if I do not harden Pharaoh’s heart he will surely repent. <strong>But it is revealed to Me that he will not really repent wholeheartedly.</strong> And then, if I smite him with plagues and punish him, people will say that Hashem brings punishment upon repenters — for they will not know that Pharaoh’s repentance was not wholehearted. Therefore I will harden his heart so that he will not repent at all, and then I will be able to increase My wonders and punish him for all to see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most important part of this Siftei Chakhamim is: \"not really repent wholeheartedly.\" - this would suggest that even if G-d did not hardened pharao's heart, the \"repentance\" of him would not have been wholeheartedly and would not have been true teshuvah.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.7.3?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban (Shemos 7:3)</a> asks a famous question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If G-d hardened Pharaoh’s heart, what then was his transgression [since he had no choice]?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramban answers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two answers, which both hold true: First, Pharaoh, in his wickedness, had unjustifiably treated the Jews terribly, so he was punished with the withdrawal of the path of repentance, and there are many verses regarding this in the Torah and the Writings, and he was punished by his original deeds. Secondly, only the second half of the [ten] plagues were brought upon Egypt due to Pharaoh’s transgressions, as the Torah states, And Pharaoh’s heart was strengthened, (Shemot 7:13, 26; 8:15), and Pharaoh hardened his heart (ibid. 8:28, 9:7). He did not want to send the Jews out of Egypt for the glory of God; rather, when the plagues increased and he was becoming too worn out to withstand them, his heart softened and he decided to send them out because of the severity of the plagues themselves, but not in order to do the will of his Creator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So based on these meforshim, it would seem that Pharaoh, even by the tenth plague, never truly repented, he just wanted to \"get it over with\".</p>\n<p>The Tur, Rabbi Yaakov ben Asher, in his commentary Tur HaAroch on Shemos 9:12 explains that Gd had to harden Pharaoh's heart to prevent Pharaoh from letting the Jewish people go sooner. This, the Tur explains, is to ensure that the full range of plagues were exposed to Mitzrayim.</p>\n<p>The Malbim says that G-d hardened the heart of pharaoh because then, the Jewish people wouldn't be let go by him, so that pharaoh and the Egyptians could see G-ds excistence and to let them see that G-d rules the world.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Darash Moshe al HaTorah, parashas Vaera, p. 106)  explains that after the 6 plagues, pharaoh only would wanted to let the Jewish people go, because solely out of fear for further plagues, not because he acknowledged G-d.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam, Raavad (Hil. Teshuva 5:5), and Ramban (Shemos 7:3) have lengthy discussions of Pharaoh's free will. These opinions are relatively well known and mentioned by others here, so I would just like to add a slightly lesser known opinion.</p>\n<p>The Seforno, on the verse הנה אנכי הרג את בנך בכורך, says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כפי המשפט האלהי שהוא ׳מדה כנגד מדה׳, כאמרו ״וכארח איש ימצאנו״ (איוב\nל״ד:י״א). כי אמנם מכת בכורות לבדה היתה למשפט עונש לפרעה מכל המכות, אבל\nשאר המכות היו לאות ולמופת למען ישובו, ״כי לא יחפץ במות המת״ (יחזקאל\nי״ח:ל״ב), כי לא נעל בפניהם דרכי התשובה האמתית כלל, לו חכמו (עפ״י דברים\nל״ב:כ״ט) לשוב אל האל יתברך מאהבת טובו ויראת גדלו, שהיא התשובה המגעת עד\nכסא הכבוד, אשר היא המצלת ונותנת חן בעיני אלהים, כאמרם זכרונם לברכה\n״עונות נחשבים לו כזכיות״ (יומא פ״ו:), או לפחות לשוב כעבדים מיראת מה\nשיוכל להעניש. אבל מכת בכורות וטביעת פרעה וחילו בים היו שפטים אלהיים,\nמדה כנגד מדה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation (my own):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Following the Divine Justice, that is to say, measure for measure\n[Israel is my firstborn son, and if you oppress him, I will kill your\nfirstborn son], as it says \"the ways of a man will find him\". Indeed,\nthe plague of the firstborn was the <strong>only one</strong> which was meted for\nJudgement and Punishment for Pharaoh, as opposed to all the other\nplagues which were for miracles and signs <strong>so that they would\nrepent</strong>, \"as he does not desire the death of the dead\". He did not\nclose the door on their repentance at all, had they but become wise\nenough to return to God the Blessed from the love of his goodness and\nawe of his greatness, which is the repentance that reaches even the\nGlorious Throne. That [type of Teshuva] is what saves a man, and gives\nhim grace in they eyes of God, as our sages of blessed memory say,\n\"his sins are now counted as commendments\". Or, at least, they could\nhave returned like slaves who fear punishment of what He would punish.\nBut the plague of the firstborn and the drowning of Pharaoh and his\narmy in the sea, those were Divine Judgement, measure for measure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I see from here is that the Seforno understood that what God was preventing from Pharaoh wasn't <em>teshuva</em>, but <em>letting the nation leave</em>. In each instance that Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuses to let בני ישראל go. That is what God had told Moshe - that he would prevent them from leaving (וַאֲנִי אֲחַזֵּק אֶת לִבּוֹ וְלֹא יְשַׁלַּח אֶת הָעָם.) Teshuva was always open to him, and he chose not to take that path. This resulted in his final punishment.</p>\n\n\n",

It is as we find written in the verse (Yeshayahu, 61), “I will surely rejoice in Hashem, and my soul will be gladdened in my God.” Our joy is in God, may He be blessed, and His Torah is our simchah and our delight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Yosef_Leiner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ishbitzer</a> in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mei_HaShiloach%2C_Volume_I%2C_Genesis%2C_Vayeshev.1?ven=Living_waters,_the_Mei_HaShiloach._Trans._and_edited_by_Betsalel_Philip_Edwards,_Jerusalem,_J._Aronson_2001_%5BRevised_digital_edition,_2021%5D&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mei HaShiloach on Vayeshev</a> says that it seems not so straightforward:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היינו כל המעשים הנעשים בעולם נראים למעשה בשר ודם, אך מההרהור והמחשבה נראים שהם מעשה הש\"י. ובאלו הפרשיות מלמד אותנו הש\"י אשר המעשים הם מיד הש\"י והמחשבות הם מצד האדם וכל המעשים שיעשה האדם דבר רשות  על זה נאמר (ברכות ל\"ג:) כי הכל בידי שמים. ומעשה המצות או היפך הם ביד הש\"י ורק לפעמים יתלה אותם באדם</p>\n<p>All the actions done in the world seem to be the actions of flesh and blood, but ideas and thoughts seem to come from God. But in these Parshiot God teaches us that it is the actions are in the hands of God and thoughts come from man, and all the actions that man does are only those that he is given leave to do, as it is written in the Gemara (Berachot, 33b), “all is in the hands of Heaven.” So, the performance of a commandment or the opposite is in the hands of God, and only occasionally does He make the performance of a commandment dependent on man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Specific Reason for the Plague of Darkness?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have found some specific reasons for each one of the plagues that GOD brought upon Egypt. Each Plague was a measure to measure punishments for the Egyptians:</p>\n<p>According to Midrash Tanchuma the first plague of blood was related to menstrual blood. The Egyptians prevented Jewish women from ritually immersing after they finished menstruating. This prevented a husband and wife from having marital relations. Besides a cruel disruption of family life, the Egyptians intended it as a form of forced birth control.</p>\n<p>The Nile River might have been a prime location for ritual immersion. (That’s where the daughter of Pharaoh performed her ritual immersion when, according to the Midrash, she converted to Judaism). Perhaps this was G-d’s message. You prohibited Jewish women from immersing in the Nile after their menstrual blood stopped flowing, I will turn the Nile river into blood. Just as the Egyptians disrupted marital relations among the Jews, G-d disrupted the Egyptians entire way of life. According to the Midrash all water in Egypt turned to blood. So no Egyptian could have a  drink of water, wash their clothes or take a bath.</p>\n<p>According to the Midrash, the Jews were forced to fetch reptiles, so in the second plague, Egypt was overrun with frogs. The Egyptians tormented the Jews by forcing them to sweep dirt from the streets and markets. The third plague turned the dirt into lice which  tormented the Egyptians. The Jews were put in mortal danger by being forced to fetch wild animals. (Some commentaries saw this as a public show where Jews were matched against wild animals). Therefore in the fourth plague, Egypt were overrun by wild animals. The Jews were forced to graze the  livestock of Egyptians on far away hills and deserts, to keep them separated from their wives. In the fifth plague, Pestilence killed off the Egyptian livestock. The Jews were forced to pamper the bodies of the Egyptians. On the sixth plague, the skin of the Egyptians was plagued with boils from which nothing could soothe the pain. The Jews were forced to plant gardens, trees, and vineyards. All were destroyed by the seventh plague of  hail.</p>\n<p>And the reason for the Final One, death of the Firstborn, is well known - since the Egyptians oppressed the \"Firstborn\" of the GOD.</p>\n<p>But one of the Ten Plagues was missing, what is the specific reason (the midah keneged midah reason) for the Plague of Darkness?

And she cried, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he tore them off his arms like a thread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again (14:6):</p>\n<p>וַתִּצְלַ֨ח עָלָ֜יו ר֣וּחַ יְהֹוָ֗ה וַֽיְשַׁסְּעֵ֙הוּ֙ כְּשַׁסַּ֣ע הַגְּדִ֔י וּמְא֖וּמָה אֵ֣ין בְּיָד֑וֹ וְלֹ֤א הִגִּיד֙ לְאָבִ֣יו וּלְאִמּ֔וֹ אֵ֖ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָֽׂה׃</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The spirit of GOD gripped him, and he tore him asunder with his bare hands as one might tear a kid asunder; but he did not tell his father and mother what he had done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>BUT the verses are not always consistent</strong> (14:19:</p>\n<p>וַתִּצְלַ֨ח עָלָ֜יו ר֣וּחַ יְהֹוָ֗ה וַיֵּ֨רֶד אַשְׁקְל֜וֹן וַיַּ֥ךְ מֵהֶ֣ם ׀ שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים אִ֗ישׁ</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The spirit of GOD gripped him. He went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of its men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Notice that it does not say, i.e., \"and killing those thirty men was like killing a lad.\"</em></p>\n<p>This one too (16:14):</p>\n<p>וַתִּתְקַע֙ בַּיָּתֵ֔ד וַתֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔יו פְּלִשְׁתִּ֥ים עָלֶ֖יךָ שִׁמְשׁ֑וֹן וַיִּיקַץ֙ מִשְּׁנָת֔וֹ וַיִּסַּ֛ע אֶת־הַיְתַ֥ד הָאֶ֖רֶג וְאֶת־הַמַּסָּֽכֶת׃</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And she pinned it with a peg and cried to him, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” Awaking from his sleep, he pulled out the peg, the loom, and the web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, no mention of how, relatively speaking, it was easy for samson to pull out the peg!</p>\n<p>And what about this (16:3):</p>\n<p>וַיִּשְׁכַּ֣ב שִׁמְשׁוֹן֮ עַד־חֲצִ֣י הַלַּ֒יְלָה֒ וַיָּ֣קׇם ׀ בַּחֲצִ֣י הַלַּ֗יְלָה וַיֶּאֱחֹ֞ז בְּדַלְת֤וֹת שַֽׁעַר־הָעִיר֙ וּבִשְׁתֵּ֣י הַמְּזֻז֔וֹת וַיִּסָּעֵם֙ עִֽם־הַבְּרִ֔יחַ וַיָּ֖שֶׂם עַל־כְּתֵפָ֑יו וַֽיַּעֲלֵם֙ אֶל־רֹ֣אשׁ הָהָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־פְּנֵ֥י חֶבְרֽוֹן׃ {פ}</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But Samson lay in bed only till midnight. At midnight he got up, grasped the doors of the town gate together with the two gateposts, and pulled them out along with the bar. He placed them on his shoulders and carried them off to the top of the hill that is near Hebron.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>There is no mention of how effortless it was to lift those gates (i.e. lifting those gates was like lifting a stone)!</em></p>\n<p>Surely, Samuel the Prophet, the author of Judges (See Bava Batra 14b) purposefully chose to either discuss these objects in comparison to other objects or to not do so. Why? Relatedly, the verse sometimes states that the Spirit of God descended upon Samson when performing a feat; sometimes the verse omits this fact ... why?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Obligation of rebuke with non halachic converts\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my understanding, the commandment to rebuke a sinner only applies if there is reason to believe that the sinner will listen. For example, there is no obligation to rebuke an atheist Jew who breaks Shabbat and won’t listen to rebuke. My question is, conversely, if one claims to be Jewish but is a non-halachic convert, is there an obligation to rebuke them? Because for example gentiles aren’t allowed to keep Shabbat, according to some פוסקים.</p>\n<p>As an anecdotal example, I am acquaintances with a “convert” under a conservative “beit din” (one of the three on it was a woman “rabbi”). He claims to be “non binary,” is gay, and thinks he’s a Jew. Should I explain to him (since he nominally believes in Judaism as a framework) why his “conversion” has no validity until he goes before an orthodox beit din, so he won’t do things like observing Shabbat or serving Jews wine?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It seems to me that you have no obligation to rebuke someone for behaving as a Jew despite your understanding that they are not Jewish.</p>\n<p>The commandment you cite is entitled by the Sefer Hachinuch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.239\" rel=\"noreferrer\">#239</a>) \"מִצְוַת תּוֹכֵחָה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁאֵינוֹ נוֹהֵג כַּשּׁוּרָה\" - \"The commandment of rebuke to an Israelite who does not behave properly.\" Clearly (and I'm unaware of any other authority who disputes this), the commandment only applies if the target is Jewish.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>So, by construction, this commandment cannot apply to the situation you describe. If the target's conversion was invalid, then they are not Jewish, and you have no obligation to rebuke them. If the target's conversion was valid, then they are Jewish, and by acting as a Jew, they are behaving properly.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

Rashi, in explaining the issue, comments \"... נהי דלהוכיחו לא היה מצווה דהוכח תוכיח את עמיתך כתיב (ויקרא יט) ולא גר תושב מיהו אודויי לדבר איסור לא לודויי\n\" - \"... granted that he wouldn't be commanded to rebuke him, for it's written 'You shall surely rebuke your kinsman' (Lev. 19), excluding a <em>ger toshav</em>; however, he shouldn't approve of a forbidden action.\" Thank you to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/2394/deuteronomy\">@Deuteronomy</a> for this source!</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mesirah for serious crimes and abuses\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m curious whether Halacha permits certain leniences for Mesirah for serious crimes based on pikuach nefesh or related similar reasoning. For example, cases of sexual abuse of minors, battery etc. even if no one technically dies do any of them count under pikuach nefesh in a broader sense? This is of course where one knows for certain an offense has occurred, could they report them to secular police authorities if there is no Beit din with proper power to do action?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>So Rav Chaim Jachter has a fascinating three-part series on Mesirah:\n<a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/the-mesirah-dilemma-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Part 1</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/the-mesirah-dilemma-part-two-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Part 2</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/the-mesirah-dilemma-part-three-by-rabbi-chaim-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Part 3</a></p>\n<p>In Part 2 he brings up the scenario of child abuse and brings a Tzitz Eliezer that discusses such a case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Waldenburg (ad. loc.) [Refer to <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14518&st=&pgnum=150\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzitz Eliezer 19:52]</a> was asked whether Halacha permits a physician to report situations of child abuse to government authorities. Rav Waldenburg permits reporting such cases if there is legitimate and very serious concern for the welfare of the child. Rav Waldenburg makes a critically important interpretation of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.388.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat 388:9</a>, which states that Mesirah is forbidden even regarding someone who is “an evildoer and sinner.” Rav Waldenburg explains that the Shulchan Aruch is not speaking of a case where the Mesirah is to prevent him from performing the sin he violates. Rather the Shulchan Aruch states that the fact that someone is a sinner does not justify a Mesirah for another unrelated cause.  <strong>Rav Waldenburg explains that the Shulchan Aruch does not forbid informing the government authorities when the government will prevent the evildoer from committing the evil he perpetrates</strong>.</p>\n<p>Even though the Shulchan Aruch (ibid.) forbids Mesirah if just an individual is being victimized, this applies only if the wrongdoer engages in verbal abuse (see Rama ad. loc. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siftei_Kohen_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.388.45.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shach ad. loc. number 45</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beur_HaGra_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.388.59?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biur HaGra ad. loc. number 59</a>). <strong>If, however, there is substantial abuse the victim is permitted to save himself and, as Rav Waldenburg notes, the community is obligated to protect the welfare of its children and report suspected abuse to the civil authorities</strong>. He does express concern, though, for a child being placed in a home of a Nochri or a non-observant Jew. Indeed, Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach requires (cited in Nishmat Avraham 4:208) all efforts be made in such cases to ensure that if the child is removed from his family that he will be placed in an observant Jewish home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to talk about the other potential issues and explains that there is a difference when there is substantial harm.</p>\n<p>He notes another issue that civil law dictates that educators and the like are required to report child abusers to the local police. This could fall in line with the maxim expressed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.83b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 83b</a>-84a, namely that it could be regarded as \"הרמנא דמלכא\" - \"a royal/king's decree\" and thus justified in reporting the suspect.</p>\n<p>Finally he quotes from Rav Schachter who spoke in a <a href=\"https://www.torahweb.org/torah/special/2007/rsch_mesirah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teaneck address</a>) about the issue of mesirah and stressed that parents and educators should teach children to report to them cases of abuse.</p>\n<p>However, he ends that section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rav Schachter cautions, though, that sometimes reports of abuse are of highly questionable veracity. Therefore, Rav Schachter advises Rabbanim to consult competent professionals who can determine the legitimacy of the claims of abuse. This concern also stresses the need for each case being presented to a competent Halachic authority for adjudication before reporting such cases to government authority.</strong> Rav Eliashiv (Kovetz Teshuvot 3:231) expresses similar concern. An example of a Rav who makes such determinations is Rav David Cohen who serves as the Posek for Ohel, a New York social service organization, who regularly is posed with such situations for adjudication. Indeed, the example of Potiphar’s wife unfounded slander against Yosef HaTzaddik compels us to exercise caution and to do our best to insure that innocent individuals are not maligned either by malicious or disturbed individuals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Some may have alluded to parts of this in the comments to the question however I'm gonna attempt to pull it together in a way that adds up for me.</p>\n<p>Basically, history up until Avraham can be viewed as a failed attempt of natural morality to produce a just and moral society. More was necessary to keep the world on track. A core group of extraordinarily God aware people became necessary—in tandem with the general moral code—to keep awareness of God front and center. A ממלכת כהנים וגוי קדוש to inspire and guide the world.</p>\n<p>Someone was needed to be chosen to head up this new core. No reason is given for Avraham's selection. It could have been anyone that would prove to be a good choice, which Avraham was certainly shown to be. His family blossomed into a nation and eventually received this additional Torah, which they agreed to. In this reading, for humanity's inborn compass of right and wrong to function properly it became necessary to have a core of ever more God aware folks than the rest.</p>\n<p>It is well nigh possible that born Jews never personally accepted the extra-moral parts of the Torah and yet God commands us in them and holds us to account. Everyone is born with different life circumstances, be that as it relates to  gender, health, smarts, looks, talents, and one’s family situation to name a few. Everyone contributes to the smooth running of society in their own way. (I'm not getting involved with the potential randomness or arbitrariness of it.)</p>\n<p>Being that a group such as the Jews is a necessary ingredient in the preservation of society someone's got to do the job. The fact that the world has shown that it requires such a group to keep it on the straight and narrow morally speaking makes it just for some people to be pressed into the job, especially as their forebears have already agreed to it and they've ostensibly been raised and trained to conform to it. If a Jew is unaware of his heritage then he obviously will not be taken to task for the additional commandments however if he is aware of them then he will be, despite him not necessarily being amenable to them, via the coercion of punishment.</p>\n<p>The world needs different people to make it work and everyone has to do their part. That someone is born into more demanding life circumstances is no different than say someone born with any other type of difficulty or impediment that needs to be surmounted. (I'm not dealing with the potential lack of fairness that presents itself in anyone’s individual life circumstance.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is very few \"universal morals\".

In Egypt the Jews started following the morals of the Egyptians (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Achrei_Mot.42.250\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Aharei 70a</a>), so Hashem took us out and gave us the Torah to reteach us what Avraham learned on his own (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14227&st=&pgnum=47\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kol Eliyahu, Haazinu</a>).</p>\n<p>He then commanded every father to teach his son that he is the creator and wants us to follow true morals (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dvarim 6:7</a>). If there is no father, the community should teach the child (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.21a.1-3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 21a</a>). Once one knows that these are God given morals, God obviously knows morals better than him and he must keep them.

In my experience, Tunisian scrolls tend to have a writing style close to Moroccan. The Moroccan writing style typically has thicker block letters than other Sephardic scrolls, AND their <a href=\"http://lavlor.blogspot.com/2009/03/rashi-vs-rabbeinu-tam-round-1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Het's look normal/flat and don't look like two zayins put together like most other Sephardic scrolls nowadays</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=How_To_Write_Letters_in_a_Sefer_Torah,_Tefillin,_and_Mezuzot&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop#Chet_-_(%D7%97)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How to Write Chets in Moroccan Tradition</a></p>\n<p>I would agree with @DoubleAA's comment that this scroll looks like a lot of other more modern Sephardic scrolls, but not specifically from Tunisia. Or if it is from Tunisia, I would date it to be within the past few hundred years as during this time most Sepharadim were transitioning to the pyramid chet of Rabbeinu Tam.</p>\n<p>To see examples of other scrolls from Tunisia you can see some on Ebay here:\n<a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&_nkw=torah+scroll+tunisia&_sacat=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313&_nkw=torah+scroll+tunisia&_sacat=0</a></p>\n<p>I would reach out to a competent sofer who has a history of repairing older Sephardic scrolls so they can help you date it. It's certainly possible that the scroll is from Tunisia, but perhaps the sofer who wrote it was trained by a different tradition than I'm used to seeing if the scroll is as old as your family narrative states.</p>\n\n\n",

That is to say, the human species is unique in the world, there being no other species like it in this respect, namely that man by himself, using his own intelligence and reason, knows what is good and what is evil, without anyone preventing him from doing good or evil as he pleases; in view of this, \"he will perhaps put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life…\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So from a very basic level, man is imbued with intellect to use in the correct manner, to choose a path of good.

This includes Torah study, as will be explained.</p>\n<p>The mechaber ponders the efficacy of his sefer and this particular area of study:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְשֶׁמָּא הַכְּסִיל הַפֶּתִי כְּשֶׁיִּקְרָא הַסֵּפֶר הַזֶּה וְיַעֲמֹד עַל מָה שֶׁזָּכַרְנוּ בַּשַּׁעַר הַזֶּה יֹאמַר בְּלִבּוֹ, הֲיֵעָלֵם עִנְיַן הַיִּחוּד מִמִּי שֶׁלָּמַד דַּף אֶחָד מִן הַתּוֹרָה עַד שֶׁיָּעִיר אוֹתָנוּ הַמְּחַבֵּר הַזֶּה עָלָיו וְיוֹרֵנוּ אוֹתוֹ אוֹמַר בִּתְשׁוּבָתוֹ, כְּמוֹ שֶׁצִּוָּה הֶחָכָם (משלי כז) עֲנֵה כְסִיל כְּאִוַּלְתּוֹ פֶּן יִהְיֶה חָכָם בְּעֵינָיו כִּי הָאוֹמֵר זֶה הַכָּרָתוֹ חֲלוּשָׁה לְהָבִין כְּלַל הָעִנְיָנִים הַנֶּאֱמָרִים (הַמַּגִּיעִים) עַל מִינִים נֶחֱלָקִים [כִּי הָעִנְיָן הַכּוֹלֵל, אִם מַגִּיעַ עַל מִינִים נֶחְלָקִים], וְקִבּוּלָם מִתְחַלֵּק בְּרַב וּבִמְעַט וּבְחָזָק וּבְחַלָּשׁ</p>\n<p>Perhaps the simple and foolish person, when he reads this book and considers what we wrote in this gate will say to himself: \"will the matter of unity of G-d be unknown to anyone who reads even one page of the Torah whereby this author needs to stir us and instruct us it?\" I will answer this as the wise man answered: \"Answer a fool according to his folly\" (Mishlei 26:5). For one who asks this is too weak of understanding to grasp the extent of a universal topic which is addressed to different classes of people. Such a universal topic is grasped differently depending on whether the person understood much of it or little of it, and whether he is of strong intellect or of weak intellect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As such, this sense of unity as taught by the Torah, and its relevant understanding, allows for three groups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Those of intellect who grasp its teachings</li>\n<li>Those too weak of intellect to grasp its teachings</li>\n<li>Those who can't quite grasp on the level of #1 but understand the easier concepts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Interestingly, when discussing the latter two groups, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַךְ הַכַּת הַשְּׁנִיָּה אֵינָהּ יוֹדַעַת סֵפֶר תּוֹרַת אֱלֹהִים כָּל שֶׁכֵּן הַיִּחוּד אֲשֶׁר בּוֹ וְהֵם שׁוֹמְעִים אֶת שָׁמְעוֹ וְאֵינָם מְבִינִים עִנְיָנוֹ אֵין לָהֶם תּוֹעֶלֶת בְּסִפְרִי זֶה כְּלָל</p>\n<p>The second class do not know G-d's Torah, all the more so the matter of Unity in it. They hear its teaching but do not comprehend its matter. They will have neither benefit nor damage from this book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, with regards to the third group that have some basic understanding, he is quick to note a potential pitfall, and therefore implies the need to not just continue at a lower standard...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהַכַּת הַשְּׁלִישִׁית שֶׁמְּבִינִים הַיִּחוּד אֲשֶׁר בְּסֵפֶר תּוֹרַת אֱלֹהִים קְצָת הֲבָנָה וְאֵין בְּכֹחַ הַכָּרָתָם לְהָבִין עִנְיָנוֹ וְלַעֲמֹד עַל אֲמִתָּתוֹ אִם יוֹרֵם אוֹתוֹ מוֹרֶה וִיבִינֵם עִנְיָנוֹ עַל דֶּרֶךְ הַמּוֹפְתִים הָאֲמִתִּיִּים וְהָרְאָיוֹת הַשִּׂכְלִיּוֹת יִתְבָּרֵר לָהֶם עִנְיָנוֹ וְיִגָּלֶה לָהֶם סוֹדוֹ וְיַגִּיעוּ בַּכַּת הָרִאשׁוֹנָה.\n<strong>וְאִם יִתְעַלְּמוּ מֵחֲקוֹר וְיִתְרַשְּׁלוּ מֵעַיֵּן בַּמֶּה שֶׁיְּחַזֵּק הַכָּרָתָם וְיִלְטֹשׁ שִׂכְלָם, יֵרְדוּ אֶל מַדְרֵגַת הַפְּתָאִים</strong></p>\n<p>The third class who understand the matter of the Unity mentioned in G-d's Torah with some understanding, but they don't have the intellectual power to understand its matter and realize its true meaning. If a teacher instructs them and makes them understand its matter through the way of true proofs and sound intellectual reasoning - its meaning will become clear to them, and its secret will be revealed to them, and they will reach the level of the first class. <strong>But if they shirk from investigating and are lazy in examining in that which will strengthen their understanding and sharpen their intellect - they will sink to the level of the foolish.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a very basic answer and in no way am I suggesting it’s a rule in every scenario, but it’s an interesting observation nonetheless (and was too long to write as a comment):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אתה חונן לאדם דעת ומלמד לאנוש בינה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There seems to be a distinction between the process of acquiring “intelligence” and “wisdom”. Intelligence is <em>taught</em>/מלמד, whereas wisdom is <em>granted</em>/חונן.</p>\n<p>I think this distinction can be observed in real life. You often find people of incredibly high IQ that fail to grasp some basic concepts (of justice for example).<br />\nThis is obviously not due to lack of brainpower, But rather a lack of wisdom.</p>\n<p>The opposite is also true. I personally know people who are really unintelligent, and their brain is just not as powerful as others. However these same people have a really good innate sense of what “makes sense” and what doesn’t. They have דעת.</p>\n<p>In yeshivos, this idea that something can be sourced from intelligence but still requires “דעת” is commonly referred to as “glatt”. One can suggest 2 different explanations which are both logically sound, and yet the rebbe will tell him that one is glatt and one is not (No rhyme intended).</p>\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>, I think we can observe that intelligence/בינה is something that one can improve on through their own actions, while wisdom/דעת is something that is bestowed directly from heaven. That being said, I don’t think the torahs obligations for commandments is tied to being “glatt”, but rather to standard intelligence which (outside of mental illness) a person should be able to learn.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Understanding Moshe's use of his staff\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Moshe came to Pharaoh and Pharaoh asked for an os (a sign), Moshe told Aaron to throw down the staff and it became a snake - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.7.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 7:10</a>.</p>\n<p>There is an apparent machlokes meforshim as to whose staff it actually was.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Exodus.7.9.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> writes that Aaron threw down the staff of Moshe and he proves it because Hashem instructed that Aaron should hit the river with the staff that became a snake. Then, later on in Rephidim, Hashem told Moshe to use his own staff which was the same one that was used to hit the river so it had to be that Moshe gave Aaron his staff to hit the river - so too here, it must have been Moshe's staff. We also have a proof from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.17.5.3?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> in Beshalach where Hashem told Moshe to take his staff to hit the rock because up until now everyone was saying this staff was only used for punishments such as on Pharaoh, the makkos, and the yam suf. Thus, Hashem wanted Moshe to use the same one to bring water and we know the staff used on the yam suf was for sure Moshe’s as the posuk there (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.16?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 14:16</a>) says explicitly, so it had to be Moshe’s same staff.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Exodus.7.9.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv</a> says that there were really two staffs, the staff of Moshe and the staff of Aaron and this one was the one of Aaron. The Netziv proves this because with the makkah of dam (blood), Hashem tells Moshe to take the staff that was changed into a snake, and we know that the one in front of Pharaoh turned into a snake and therefore there must have been two different staffs. The Netziv says this is what troubled Rashi when he explained the word \"תנין\" to mean a snake because he held there was only one staff, that of Moshe’s. However, the Netziv argues because we know a \"תנין\" and a \"נחש\" are two different things, one being an alligator type creature and one a snake. As a result, he says it must be that there were two and at the makkah of dam Hashem told Moshe to take his even though Aaron would be the one hitting it with his own.</p>\n<p>The question then becomes what was the need for Moshe to simply bring along his staff? The Netziv answers this by saying Aaron’s hit only turned the river into appearing like blood and Moshe hit it afterwards making it into blood itself. <strong>The question we have on this is how could Moshe have done this if we know he was unable to hit it since he had to be makir tov (grateful) for the Nile saving him?</strong> (Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.7.19.1?ven=Rashi_Chumash,_Metsudah_Publications,_2009&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi, Shemos 7:19</a>) (Maybe it’s possible to answer that after it appeared like blood there was no longer an issue of not being makir tov.)</p>\n\n\n",

This is because the\nbones are completely burnt, thereby undergoing a chemical change which\nconverts them to pure carbon.

The bone-char is subsequently removed from the sugar and is\nnot chemically evident in the final product.</p>\n<p>The anti-foaming agents that control the froth which is created in the\nrefining process may sometimes be of non-kosher animal origin.\nHowever, the amount used is insignificant and would be batel,\nnullified, in the sugar. <strong>Therefore, the kosher consumer may purchase\nany pure cane or beet sugar even without kosher certification.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you have a specific concern, feel free to add it into the question.</p>\n\n\n",

But according to this, what would it mean that Yaakov told Eisav \"I have acquired these\". What is the deeper meaning behind what he says in this special encounter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains (in <a href=\"https://chabadlibrary.org/books/3901370113\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Ohr, Vayishlach</a>) that Yaakov comes from the \"World of Tikun\" (our present existence, in which the Sefiros work together harmoniously), and Eisav, from the \"World of Tohu,\" where the Sefiros are much more intense. Tohu is \"higher\" than Tikun, and so Yaakov wanted to bring the transcendent Divine energy of Tohu down into Tikun, thinking that Eisav is ready for that.</p>\n<p>So he starts by informing him that he's accomplished all of Tikun, to the extent that he has Moshiach ben Yosef and Moshiach ben Dovid and everything else represented by \"the sheep, slave and maidservant,\" and then asks Eisav to contribute his efforts.</p>\n<p>To expand on that last point (as per the OP's request in comments):</p>\n<p>It is cited in the name of R. Shneur Zalman (Pelach Harimon, Shemos, p. 7) that \"for exalted souls such as that of R. Shimon bar Yochai, the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash never took place,\" so rarefied a perception of G-dliness did they experience. In a similar vein, a story is told of R. Shneur Zalman's elder colleague and teacher, R. Menachem Mendel of Horodok, that when some fellow blew a shofar, and people thought Moshiach had come, R. Mendel opened the window, sniffed the outside air, and said that no, Moshiach is not here yet. Why did he need to check the outside? Because in his own room, Moshiach - i.e., the open revelation of G-dliness that we will all have at this time - was already there!</p>\n<p>So with Yaakov it was the same way. He already perceived Moshiach \"in the air\" as a result of his efforts during his stay with Lavan (from whom, RSZ explains in Torah Ohr there, he received a transcendent level of G-dly energy even beyond both Yaakov and Eisav), and so he thought that the world at large - whose exemplar is Eisav - was ready for it too.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You are probably looking for the dvar Torah based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.75.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 75:6</a></p>\n<p>The <em>drash</em> meaning of the verse according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.75.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 75:12</a> is: ox refers to Yosef as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.17?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 33:17</a> whose descendant <em>mashiyach ben Yosef</em> will wage war against Eisav.

However, if it is <em>also</em> twilight, which will be two redeeming factors, the Ta\"Z and the Eliya Rabbah hold that we can be lenient.

Why is that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As noted, explicit references to the Babylonian Talmud from other texts provide an upper boundary of the early 8th century on when its compilation can be dated. The very earliest manuscript fragments of the Talmud, from Cairo Geniza, also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#Manuscripts\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">date to</a> the 8th century. But we can be more precise. The Babylonian Talmud dates to somewhere between the 6th century to the early 7th century (before the Arab conquests). This is shown by Monika Amsler, <em>The Babylonian Talmud and Late Antique Book Culture,</em> Cambridge 2023, pp. 122–123.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While earlier scholarship tended to place the date of a “final\nredaction” in the mid-sixth century based on medieval pedigrees of\ntalmudic sages, some recent scholarship has assigned dates ranging\nfrom the mid-seventh century to the second half of the eighth\ncentury.54 The latter dates would imply that the Talmud was written\ndown and redacted after the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia. The\nassignment of a date after the Arab conquest is contradicted, however,\nby the fact that the Talmud does not contain Arabic loanwords or\nsyntax.55 Such loanwords should be expected to be found in a text that\nwent through the last stages of oral transmission after the (final)\nArabic conquest, or at least in the notes added by the final\nredactors. Arabic as the new lingua franca was widely embraced, and by\nthe tenth century, even the non-Semitic Persian language used 30\npercent Arabic words, while Aramaic had completely disappeared.56\nTexts authored by post-talmudic rabbinic sages (Geonim) were\nexclusively written in Arabic by the eighth century. This would point\nto a terminus ad quem for the composition of the Talmud in the early\nseventh century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just for context, I will also quote Amsler's compilation of earlier opinions about the dating of the Talmud:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On earlier scholarship (e.g., Isidore Epstein and Hanoch Albeck), see\nGünter Stemberger, Einleitung in Talmud und Midrasch, 9th ed. (Munich:\nC. H. Beck, 2011), 215. Charlotte E. Fonrobert and Martin S. Jaffee,\nintroduction to The Cambridge Companion to the Talmud and Rabbinic\nLiterature, ed. Charlotte E. Fonrobert and Martin S. Jaffee\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), 9, give the seventh\ncentury as a closing date for the Talmud; Richard Kalmin, Migrating\nTales: The Talmud’s Narratives and Their Historical Context (Berkeley:\nUniversity of California Press, 2014), ix, reaches the date 651 CE;\nDavid Weiss Halivni, The Formation of the Babylonian Talmud, trans.\nJeffrey L. Rubenstein (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), xxix,\nmoves the date back to the second half of the eighth century. See also\nHalivni, Formation of the Babylonian Talmud, 9, for the length of the\nperiod during which Halivni conceives of the Stammaim as being active. (pg. 123, n. 54)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another way to narrow down the range of the Babylonian Talmud, other than that it must have been before the Arab conquests, is by pointing out its reliance on earlier texts that we can also date. For example, Amsler shows that the Palestinian Talmud, which we know the Babylonian Talmud relied on, must date between the late fourth century and the early fifth century (Amsler, <em>The Babylonian Talmud and Late Antique Book Culture</em>, pp. 127–131). This page also contains more information on how the Palestinian Talmud is dated: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud#Contemporary_views\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud#Contemporary_views</a></p>\n<p>Therefore, the final compilation of the Palestinian Talmud also gives us a lower boundary of when the Babylonian Talmud could have originated.</p>\n\n\n",

One who recites it in another language must avoid erroneous words in that language and be as scrupulous when using that language as if he was reciting it in the Holy Tongue\nקוֹרֵא אָדָם אֶת שְׁמַע בְּכָל לָשׁוֹן שֶׁיִּהְיֶה מְבִינָהּ. וְהַקּוֹרֵא בְּכָל לָשׁוֹן צָרִיךְ לְהִזָּהֵר מִדִּבְרֵי שִׁבּוּשׁ שֶׁבְּאוֹתוֹ הַלָּשׁוֹן וּמְדַקְדֵּק בְּאוֹתוֹ הַלָּשׁוֹן כְּמוֹ שֶׁמְּדַקְדֵּק בִּלְשׁוֹן הַקֹּדֶשׁ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Raavad disagrees with the Rambam:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2:10\nאין זה מקובל על הדעת לפי שכל הלשונות פירוש הן ומי ידקדק אחר פירושו: \"This is not acceptable on the mind because all [other] languages are explanations [of Hebrew] and [thus] who will be scrupulous when dealing with an explanation...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Preliminarily, both the Rambam and Raavad agree that one must utilize a bona fide language/lashon. Uttering Morse code - is this a halachik language?</p>\n<p>Assuming that the Rambam meant that one must use a bona fide language such as English, FE, AND one must use the most expert/fitting translation possible of that authentic language and avoid any corruptions/unclear and ambiguous terms (see Kesef Mishna), <em>AND assuming that the Raavad understood the Rambam to mean such,</em> is the Raavad nonetheless positing that no particular word choice in that credible language trumps any other? And that as long as he/she understands what he/she is saying in that bona fide language all is well!?</p>\n<p>If so, does this suggest per the Raavad, that one may one read the Shema in rap or slang? FE, instead of \"Hear, Israel,\" can one recite \"Check it Out, Israel?\" Or is a rap or slang rendition of the Shema no longer merely a question of substituting and swapping out normative, choice English words for those that are more loose and casual, but a matter of attempting to recite (as is evident from the rest of the words chosen for that recitation) the Shema in a wholly as-of-yet unacceptable non-language? Or, perhaps, is such a version an expression of God's Oneness in a newly acceptable language and thus the issue of word corruptions is moot?</p>\n<p>Languages morph; new words and phrases appear and others fall into disuse. Sublanguages exist too. For purposes of Shema, what is a language (Raavad and Rambam presumably agree that the Shema must be read in a language), what is a non-language (both presumably agree this is unacceptable), and what are words or phrases that are corruptions within a credible language (a potential machlokes Rambam and Raavad)?</p>\n<p>And so FE, one begins the Shema with words 'Check it Out, Israel.' 1) This isn't the best English word choice - Rambam would disapprove and Raavad would approve. 2) the phrase \"check it out\" as used by that reciter and as becomes evident from the rest of the words used for that Shema are derived from a newly accepted urban dictionary-like hipster 'language' - (all agree there is no problem.) 3) same as 2 but this newly created language does not meet the halachik requirements of language/lashon (whatever those are!?)(all agree there is a problem with the recitation).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Moshiach will be groomed in Arabia\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Maharal of Prague, in his sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Netzach_Yisrael.26.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netzach Yisrael (26:12)</a> writes (quoted by Rabbi Yitzchok Sorotzkin in sefer Keitz HaYamin, Vol. 1, p. 14):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכך המשיח גדל בבירת ערבא - Moshiach will grow up [be groomed] in Arabia (my own translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maharal explains in great detail that Moshiach will overcome Yishmael, but he does not seem to explain what it means that Moshiach will be groomed in Arabia.</p>\n<p>Are there any explanations on this Maharal? What does it mean that Moshiach will be groomed in Arabia? Has it perhaps something to do with the fact that just like Moshe Rabbeinu was groomed in the house of pharao, so too Moshiach will be groomed in the house of Yishmael?</p>\n<p>Rav Daniel Glatstein shlita (Magid HaRakiah, Nisan, Pesach, Hagadah Shel Pesach, p. 364) explains that the final exile is rooted in the first exile, e.g. Mitzrayim. One opinion on why we were exiled to Mitzrayim is because we sold Yosef to the Yishmaelim. So, just as the first exile came because of the Yishmaelim, so too the final exile will.</p>\n<p>As always, the more sources, the better!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Maharal is explicitly referring to a well-known aggadah about the birth of Mashiach after the destruction of the Temple. In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eikhah_Rabbah.1.51?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&qh=%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%AA%20%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi</a> his birth was stated to be in Birat Malka of Beit Lechem of Yehudah and in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eikhah_Rabbah.1.51?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&qh=%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%AA%20%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha Rabbah</a> it's Birat Arava of Beit Lechem of Yehudah.<sup>1</sup> Either way, this place was somewhere in Judea. In the aggadah, the Mashiach is said to have been born there and after he grew a little, a strong wind swept him away.</p>\n<p>Among researchers it's debated where Birat Malka and Birat Arava were located. Some have suggested perhaps identifying the latter with Kiryat Arabiya (קרית ערבייה), a place mentioned in the Bar Kochva documents, but this is not agreed by everyone.</p>\n<p>The Maharal offers a symbolic interpretation of the place-name, connecting it to the Arabs (interestingly enough, the story in the aggadah opens with an Arab informing a Jew that: a. The Temple has been destroyed. b. The Mashiach has been born). As the Maharal wrote <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Netzach_Yisrael.26.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one paragraph prior</a>, it is, indeed, as you guessed, related to the birth of Moshe. The Redeemer has to be raised among the nation he is going to defeat, because if that nation enslaves Yisrael, that means they have a היעדר (absence, void), i.e., a kind of serious character flaw, which will allow the Redeemer to cause that nation to become absent (=disappear).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> A third variation of the aggadah appears in Rabbi Moshe Ha'darshan's Beresheet Rabbati 30:41 (<a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH990019868460205171/NLI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Albeck edition</a>, pp. 130-131). One of the differences is that the birthplace is stated to simply be Beit Lechem of Yehudah. A second textual witness of the Beresheet Rabbati version appeared in a Yemenite manuscript that used to be owned by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Leib_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehudah Leib Fishman-Maimon</a>, and it was printed in Yehudah Even-Shmuel's <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33218&st=&pgnum=353\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrashei Geulah, pp. 304-305</a> under the title 'Ma'aseh Eliyahu' (that's how it was called in the manuscript). There, the birthplace is also said to be simply in Beit Lechem of Yehudah. The whereabouts of Rabbi Maimon's original manuscript are not currently known.</p>\n\n\n",

Through this symbolic form, Maimonides presents the law as\ndesigned to perfect the individual and society by shaping them in the\nimage of the divinely created cosmic order. The commandments of the\nlaw thereby bring human beings closer to fulfilling their ultimate\npurpose, knowledge of God. This symbolism turns the Mishneh Torah into\nan object of contemplation that itself communicates such knowledge. In\nshort, it is a work of art.</p>\n<p>Gillis unpacks the metaphysical and cosmological underpinnings of\nMaimonides’ scheme of organization with consummate skill, allowing the\nreader to understand the Mishneh Torah’s artistic dimension and to\nappreciate its power. Moreover, as he makes clear, uncovering this\ndimension casts new light on one of the great cruxes of Maimonides\nstudies: the relationship of the Mishneh Torah to his philosophical\ntreatise The Guide of the Perplexed. A fundamental unity is revealed\nbetween Maimonides the codifier and Maimonides the philosopher that\nhas not been fully appreciated hitherto.</p>\n<p>Maimonides’ artistry in composition is repeatedly shown to serve his\naims in persuading us of the coherence and wisdom of the halakhic\nsystem. Gillis’s fine exegesis sets in high relief the humane and\ntranscendental purposes and methods of halakhah as Maimonides\nconceived of it, in an argument that is sure-footed and convincing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The book is reviewed at <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/32662761/Review_of_David_Gillis_Reading_Maimonides_Mishneh_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.academia.edu/32662761/Review_of_David_Gillis_Reading_Maimonides_Mishneh_Torah</a></p>\n\n\n",

The animals, however, were not given seeds or fruits - but (Genesis 1:30) plants/herbage only:</p>\n<p>וּֽלְכׇל־חַיַּ֣ת הָ֠אָ֠רֶץ וּלְכׇל־ע֨וֹף הַשָּׁמַ֜יִם וּלְכֹ֣ל ׀ רוֹמֵ֣שׂ עַל־הָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ֙ נֶ֣פֶשׁ חַיָּ֔ה אֶת־כׇּל־יֶ֥רֶק עֵ֖שֶׂב לְאׇכְלָ֑ה וַֽיְהִי־כֵֽן׃\nAnd to all the animals on land, to all the birds of the sky, and to everything that creeps on earth, in which there is the breath of life, [I give] all the green plants for food.” And it was so.</p>\n<p>The Ramban makes this patently clear:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וטעם \"אֶת כָּל עֵשֶׂב זֹרֵעַ זֶרַע\" ואת כל העץ אשר בו פרי עץ זורע זרע לכם יהיה לאכלה, שיאכלו זרועי העשב כגרגרי החטה והשעורה והקטניות וזולתם, ויאכלו כל פרי העץ, אבל העץ עצמו אינו להם לאכלה, וגם לא העשב, עד שנתקלל אדם ונאמר לו: \"וְאָכַלְתָּ אֶת עֵשֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶה\" (בראשית ג׳:י״ח).\nThe meaning of the expression, every seed bearing plant… and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food, <em>is that they should eat the seeds of herbs, such as the grains of wheat, barley, beans, and the like, and that they should eat all fruits of the tree;</em> but the tree itself was not given to them for food, <strong>nor was the herb itself until man was cursed and he was told, And thou shalt eat the herb of the field.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Thus, seeds and fruits were originally the foodstuff of man; not the herb/leafy portions. \"Seed bearing plant\" means 'eat the seed, but not the herbage!'

    "content": "# Do Noahide mitzvot apply in outer space\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From previous questions and answers  I’ve seen on this site, there are some (albeit a minority) of halachic opinions that mitzvot don’t apply off of earth and so Jews can’t leave earth to remove their halachic obligation. My question is, does the same apply to Noahide commandments, or is this opinion only relevant to Jews? Is it different principles at play?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>You're misunderstanding the idea you are presenting.</strong></p>\n<p>It's true that there is an opinion that certain mitzvot do not apply to space. This is only true for a specific set of mitzvot which are tied to the day/night cycle. It isn't applicable to all Jewish law but only Jewish law which use time as a manner of determining when we perform certain mitzvot.</p>\n<p>Even then, the opinion further states that a Jew should perform these mitzvot anyway as to not lose connection to them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/494435.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Halperin, Im Esak Shamayim, p. 41</strong></a></p>\n<p>Therefore, everywhere on the globe – where the Creator set and imprinted the order of creation based on the paths of the Earth, sun, and moon – all of Torah’s time-bound mitzvot are applicable… That is not true in space, where the laws of creation and the order of time are totally different, and are not bound at all by the system of day and night – and the time that flows from it – based on the path of the earth, sun, moon, and the relations between all of them.\n...It therefore seems obvious that with regards to space…essentially, the mitzvot, laws, and obligations dependent on day and night, the week, month, and year are not applicable. For these mitzvot are only applicable to one living in a place that is following the laws of creation and the order of time on the globe – not to someone living with a totally different time system.\n<strong>Nevertheless, it is very logical that on a rabbinic level, a person is obligated to fulfill these mitzvot, so that he should not lose consciousness of these mitzvot.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To answer your question:</strong></p>\n<p>A Noahide would still be obligated to follow all categories of law which are not time dependent. Just as a Jew would be required to follow all categories of law which are not time dependent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not profane God's oneness</li>\n<li>Do not curse God</li>\n<li>Do not murder</li>\n<li>Do not eat flesh of a living animal</li>\n<li>Do not steal</li>\n<li>Do not participate in inappropriate sexual relations</li>\n<li>Establish courts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These categories of law are not dependent on time. If we are using the original opinion I cited as the guidepost for the logic Noahide might use for determining what is acceptable, a Noahide would be required to continue observing these laws. They are not time dependent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>Spinoza writes that halacha (Jewish law) does not apply to Jews anymore since the destruction of the state of Israel by the Romans in 70 CE. Spinoza explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“That the Jews themselves were not bound to practice their ceremonial\nobservances after the destruction of their kingdom is evident from\nJeremiah… They were no more bound by the law of Moses, after the\ndestruction of their kingdom, than they had been before it had been\nbegun… From all these considerations it is clearer than day that\nceremonies have nothing to do with a state of blessedness, and that\nthose mentioned in the Old Testament, i.e. the whole Mosaic Law, had\nreference merely to the government of the Jews, and merely temporal\nadvantages.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spinoza held that Jews are not obligated to observe Torah laws outside the state of Israel.</p>\n<p>It may surprize many that Nachmanides held the same view as Spinoza. He wrote the Torah laws only applied when Jews were in Israel and the obligation outside of Israel is only rabbinic.</p>\n<p>If Jewish law does not apply to Jews outside the land of Israel, then it does not apply in outer space. If halacha does not apply to Jews in space, the Noahide laws, equally do not apply to non-Jews in space, as they were developed by the rabbis and are thereby rabbinic in nature.</p>\n<p>However, it is better to observe Torah laws and the Noahide laws anywhere whether on earth or in space and the observance of them will help improve ourselves and society. The Ramban and Spinoza were wrong.</p>\n\n\n",

When that gentile [whom he bought the slave from] bought the slave through the slave selling himself. But if he was bought through the kingdom's laws, in which the slave's body belongs to  his [gentile] master, and a Jew bought the slave from him, if the slave immersed with the purpose of becoming a free Jew, it doesn't work [because his body is already owned].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that a gentile can both be sold according to local law to another gentile, and can sell himself into slavery to another gentile. However, if a gentile seems himself into slavery, his body is still considered his own (maybe it'd be considered sort of like an עבד עברי status), whereas if he's sold by law, it'd follow whatever the law states (and presumably his body would belong to his master).</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yehuda\nsays: <strong>If his son is diligent and sharp, and his study will endure, his\nson takes precedence over him.</strong> This is like that anecdote which is\ntold about Rav Ya’akov, son of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, whose father sent\nhim to Abaye to study Torah. When the son came home, his father saw\nthat his studies were not sharp, as he was insufficiently bright.

Why does the fact that his son is smarter override the father's own obligation of talmud torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In this case the father has two conflicting obligations: his own study and his son's. He can't do both, so he has to choose between them. So the tiebreaker is what will lead to the higher level of study overall. (Some explain that a major part of the mitzvah to learn Torah is to ensure the Torah will be transmitted. So if his son will do a better job, that is better Limmud Torah.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As study is primarily valuable to inform action it is sensible that the study that can better guide action is more valuable</p>\n<p>Bavli Kiddushin 40b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּכְבָר הָיָה רִבִּי טַרְפוֹן וּזְקֵנִים מְסוּבִּין בַּעֲלִיַּת בֵּית נִתְזָה בְּלוֹד. נִשְׁאֲלָה שְׁאֵילָה זוֹ בִּפְנֵיהֶם: תַּלְמוּד גָּדוֹל אוֹ מַעֲשֶׂה גָּדוֹל? נַעֲנָה רִבִּי טַרְפוֹן וְאָמַר: מַעֲשֶׂה גָּדוֹל. נַעֲנָה רִבִּי עֲקִיבָא וְאָמַר: תַּלְמוּד גָּדוֹל. נַעֲנוּ כוּלָּם וְאָמְרוּ: תַּלְמוּד גָּדוֹל, שֶׁהַתַּלְמוּד מֵבִיא לִידֵי מַעֲשֶׂה.</p>\n<p>In connection to the mishna’s statement about the importance of Torah study, the Gemara relates the following incident: And there already was an incident in which Rabbi Tarfon and the Elders were reclining in the loft of the house of Nit’za in Lod, when this question was asked of them: Is study greater or is action greater?

What is the difference? To which direction did Moses spread His Hands - when spreading his hands towards Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When Moses performed the miracles of the plagues, he would extend the staff toward whatever would be affected, in this case the sky.</p>\n<p>Moses spreading his hands to G-d does not necessarily mean a direction, it means an action of prayer, intended as part of his prayer to G-d.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The primary contrast between the two is the concept of judgement and the concept of kindness.</p>\n<p>Judgement is, in general, associated with the staff <em>of Moshe</em>. Like is emphasized in the Torah that he received the Ten Commandments <em>from the aspect of Judgement</em> (מפי הגבורה). <em>See Rashi to Numbers 16:3</em></p>\n<p>The reason for this is because the <em>Staff</em>, which is similar to a rod, scepter or reed (קו, מטה, שבט, קנה), and also like the cord in 2 Samuel 8:2 (חבל), are all tools for measuring (למודד מדד).</p>\n<p>This underlines a general principle that G-d's judgement in the Torah is measured and restricted, meaning not unlimited, like the expression <em>measure for measure</em> (מדה כנגד מדה). G-d's judgement in regard to His creations is finite, like them, in contrast to the possibility His judgement being infinite like G-d, the Creator.</p>\n<p>But Moshe also served in the place of and was equated with Aharon, his older brother. Aharon was from the side of kindness (חסד). And the corresponding action is the action performed by Aharon as Kohen Gadol of lifting his hands with fingers spread when blessing the people.</p>\n<p>This idea of fingers spread and outstretched emphasizes the quality of kindness that G-d manifests within His creation. That His kindness exceeds His quality of judgement like is emphasized in the second of the ten commandments (Exodus 20:4-5), which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall have no other gods besides Me.\nYou shall not make for yourself a sculptured image, or any likeness of what is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the earth.\nYou shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I, your G-d, am an impassioned G-d, <em><strong>visiting the guilt</strong></em> of the parents upon the children, <em><strong>upon the third and upon the fourth generations</strong></em> <em>of those who reject Me</em>; but <em><strong>showing kindness</strong></em> <em><strong>to the thousandth generation</strong></em> <em>of those who love Me and keep My commandments</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to, Moshe performs this action when making a prayer to elicit kindness and curtail the plague.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Epistemic Ramchal v. Maharal Debate - Does the Opposite of a Thing Define it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Maharal writes in Chapter One of Netzach Yisrael:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chapter 1\nכאשר הדבר הטוב נודע מהפכו ידיעה אמיתית, וכן כל הדברים נקנה הידיעה בהם מן ההפך, כי מן מראה השחור יכול לדעת מראה הלבן שהוא הפכו, וכן כל ההפכים, מן האחד נקנה הידיעה בהפך שלו. ומוסכם הוא כי 'ידיעת ההפכים הוא אחד'.\nWhen a good thing is known from its opposite, that is true knowledge.  The knowledge of all things is acquired from their opposite.  It is from the appearance of black that one can gain knowledge of the appearance of white.  And similarly with all opposites.  From one is acquired the knowledge of its opposite.  It is widely accepted that \"the knowledge of opposites is all one thing\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramchal disagrees in Daas Tevunos siman 38:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דרך משל, בגדר החכמה אין שייך הסכלות,  ... בדרך החסידות אין שייך הרע, כי גדרו הוא - לעשות טוב עם הכל Meaning, by way of example, within the boundary of wisdom, foolishness is not relevant... In the path of piousness, evil is not relevant, because its boundary is - to do good with all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואל תטעי לומר שגם לתת ביאור לחכמה צריך להראות הסכלות, וכן לבאר החסידות צריך להראות האכזריות, כי אין הפך ניכר אלא מהפכו; כי צריך להבין שכל מעלות הטוב אין לנו להבינם אלא מעלות הטוב לפי מה שהוא טוב, ושלילת ההיפך של המעלות ההם אינם בכלל גדר המעלות ההם הטובות And don't err in saying that also in order to give explanation to wisdom you need to show foolishness, and similarly in order to explain piousness you need to show cruelty, for one cannot recognize an opposite except from its opposite; for we need to understand that all characteristics of good cannot be understood except in their characteristic of good according to that which makes them good, and the negation of the opposite of these characteristics is not in the boundaries of these good characteristics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How does the Ramchal feel about the concept of \"left\"? Can one really define it without considering \"right?\" And is there a way to reconcile these <em>opposing</em> Ramchal/Maharal views?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramchal and Maharal are speaking to the same point but from different perspectives. From our Human perspective, we can only perceive or understand something truly by virtue of its opposite. Being that God isn't limited like us Humans, from his perspective things are true essentially by virtue of their existence alone, not in contrast to their opposites. This is stated clearly by Chazal themselves in the <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20496&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Temurah</a> (chapter 2):</p>\n<p>״וכל מה שברא, בתמורה בראו: אילולי מות - לא היה חיים, ואילולי חיים - לא היה מות, ואילולי שלום - לא היה רע, ואילולי רע - לא היה שלום...אלא ברא עניים ועשירים שיהיו ניכרים זה מזה וברא חכמים וטיפשים כדי להבדיל זה מזה...אם אין צדיק - אין רשע, אמר רשע לצדיק: מבקש אתה להחזיק לי טובה? לולי שאני רשע מאין היית ניכר? אילו היו כל בני אדם צדיקים לא היה לך יתרון. הרי שיש לכל תמורה, חוץ מדבר אחד - להודיע לכל באי עולם ברמז שהוא [הקב״ה] אחד ואין לו שני... כך אין להקב״ה אחר, אחד שאין לו אחר.״</p>\n<p>“And everything that [God] created was created with an opposite: were it not for death - there would be no life, and were it not for life - there would be no death, and were it not for peace - there would be no evil, and were it not for evil - there would be no peace...Rather [God] created the poor and the rich so that they should be recognizable one from the other and he created the wise and the dumb in order to distinguish one from the other...If there is no righteous individual - then there is no wicked individual, the wicked says to the righteous; you wish to hold me in favor? Were it not for me - from where would you be recognized? Were it that all mankind is righteous - you would be no advantage (i.e. you would be no different). Behold there is an opposite for everything, except for one thing - to inform the people of the world through allusion that he [God] is one and has no second (i.e. has no opposite)...There is no other to God, [he] is one that has no other (i.e. second).\"</p>\n<p>The Ramchal there in Daas Tevunos is speaking of God's characteristics as they relate to his omnipresence/singularity, and as Rav Spinner and Rav Goldblatt <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51256&hilite=b645538c-0afb-4286-aede-c76f6b655806&st=%D7%AA%D7%98%D7%A2%D7%99&pgnum=52\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explain in their commentary</a> the notion of \"for one cannot recognize an opposite except from its opposite\" is true from our perspective in how we <em>recognize</em> or <em>identify</em> God's characteristics, but is inaccurate when <em>defining</em> them in-and-of-themselves from the perspective of God's <em>singularity</em>. In other words, to say that any one of God's characteristics - say wisdom - is <em>defined</em>, i.e. <em>only true</em>, <em>by virtue</em> of foolishness is incorrect, as that limits God's characteristics to finite Human logic, for God's characteristics in essence partake of his singularity, just as he is one <em>because</em> he is one - and not <em>because</em> there is another, so too his characteristics are true because they are true inherently - and not because of their opposite.</p>\n<p>This is again, from the perspective of God, and thus impossible for us to truly understand, as it states (Yeshayahu, 55,8-9); ״כִּ֣י לֹ֤א מַחְשְׁבוֹתַי֙ מַחְשְׁב֣וֹתֵיכֶ֔ם וְלֹ֥א דַרְכֵיכֶ֖ם דְּרָכָ֑י נְאֻ֖ם ה׳. כִּֽי־גָבְה֥וּ שָׁמַ֖יִם מֵאָ֑רֶץ כֵּ֣ן גָּבְה֤וּ דְרָכַי֙ מִדַּרְכֵיכֶ֔ם וּמַחְשְׁבֹתַ֖י מִמַּחְשְׁבֹתֵיכֶֽם״. Or as the Tikkunei Zohar writes (17a); ״אנת הוא חד <em>ולא בחושבן</em>״. Put differently, the Rambam famously writes (Yesodei Hatorah, 2;10) ״הוּא הַיּוֹדֵעַ וְהוּא הַיָּדוּעַ וְהוּא הַדֵּעָה עַצְמָהּ הַכּל אֶחָד. וְדָבָר זֶה אֵין כֹּחַ בַּפֶּה לְאָמְרוֹ וְלֹא בָּאֹזֶן לְשָׁמְעוֹ וְלֹא בְּלֵב הָאָדָם לְהַכִּירוֹ עַל בֻּרְיוֹ.״.</p>\n<p>Think about it this way, we understand what true Goodness is by virtue of its contrast to true Evil. As the Ramchal himself teaches (Klach Pischei Chochmah; 3) even Evil, in truth, stems from Goodness itself, thus Goodness is good inherently, not because of Evil. The deep secret of how Evil is rooted in Goodness is something which is only truly understood from God's perspective.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/s1ZBF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/s1ZBF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Rav Mordechai Goldblatt in his commentary on Daas Tevonos explains that the Ramchal is <strong>not</strong> repudiating the notion of recognizing cosmic things via their opposites. While it is true that the opposite of A (B) may sharpen and underscore an understanding of A, B is not an element of A. I may need darkness to better recognize light, but light at its existential core has nothing to do with darkness. The Maharal thus might be discussing the process of sharpening, enhancing, and deepening our understanding of a thing, but not the existential description of it - whereas the Ramchal speaks in terms of pure, existential descriptions/definitions - if so, there is no debate.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In the marriage mashal, is Hashem ever considered the kalla, and Israel the chatan?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>For example, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.54a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 54a</a>, the mashal says  זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה, with the male mentioned first. In the nimshal preceding the mashal, Yisrael is mentioned first.</p>\n<p>The Shechina is considered feminine. Therefore, I think it is a reasonable question to ask, are we ever referred to as the male or husband, with Hashem being the female or wife? What does this teach vs. the opposite if so? The more examples and sources the better!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here is the reason why yes:</p>\n<p>The first chapter of שערי אורה teaches that the name of the lower שכינה is the name of אדנות. However this is referring to when it is spelled as אדנות for example in the Pasuk that precedes שמונה עשרה. We see in those instances that we are talking to the שכינה.</p>\n<p>Here is the reason why no:</p>\n<p>The same Sefer teaches in the Chapter of תפארת fifth gate (its in the first few sentences) that that Sefira is referred to as the name Hashem הויה. That Sefira is <em>always</em> masculine. (100% of the time).</p>\n<p>Why the contradiction:</p>\n<p>Sometimes the name הויה includes the 5 main פרצופים which <em>includes</em> the שכינה which is called the bride (this is in all of the כתבי ארי but you can find it in the שער ההקדמות). Sometimes it refers only to the the \"ו\" which is always the groom. However as we can see from above in some Tefillot we are speaking to the שכינה.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Anti-Karaite reactionary basis for increased tefillin observance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In this <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230922035419/https://www.kotzkblog.com/2023/07/437-historical-neglect-of-tefilin.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">blogpost</a> the contention is made, based on many rabbinic sources, that unfortunately the observance of the miswa of tefillin was weakly observed during various historical periods. The author of the post has his own theory for what caused a revival in observance (the influence of Lurianic kabbalah). Earlier however, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Levi_Rodkinson\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Michael Levi Rodkinson</a>'s History of the Talmud (p. 31), it is suggested that a shift in widespread observance was a reaction to Karaite denial that tefillin are intended by the Torah (Ex. 13:9; 13:6; Deut. 6:8; 11:18):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The effects of Karaism are also traceable in some religious practices,\nwhich had not been usual among the people of ancient times. Thus\nPhylacteries, which it had not been customary to use, in spite of the\nliteral interpretation of the Talmud of the passage \" and thou shalt\nbind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets\nbetween thine eyes,\" (Deut. vi. 8) ; perhaps for the reason that\nHillel had said: \"Leave Israel alone; if they are not prophets, they\nare children of prophets,\" (Pesachim); for after all, the arguments of\nthe Talmud in favor of the literalness of that passage, the people\nfelt that it was only a figurative expression; and the Talmud itself\nprohibited the use of phylacteries to the people, permitting it only\nto con-firmed scholars. But when the Karaites interpreted the passage\nfiguratively, the Gaonim permitted the use of Tephilin to the people\nalso, to show their difference from the Karaites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The notion that there were those that mistakenly believed that tefillin are solely the province of scholars, can be demonstrated by the responsum of R. Sherira Gaon (cited in the abovementioned blogpost). The idea that certain practices were prescribed or strengthened as response to Karaism I don't find altogether unique either (such as some suggest as the basis for the consumption of chulent/hamin, or the recitation of bameh madliqin on Friday night, etc.). However that the Geonim sought to bolster the practice of wearing tefillin specifically as a hedge against Karaism seems to me to be a unique claim.</p>\n<p><strong>Does anyone know where Rodkinson got this idea from? Is there any support for it? Do any other scholars (traditional or academic) discuss it?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have to disagree with the claim being made. I can cite specific reasons why their claim would be incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, the idea that tefillin usage wasn't a common Jewish practice until Karaism simply isn't accurate. It's possible that due to the costs of materials it wasn't something the everyday Jew could easily participate in. Hence why you cite how the Rabbinum restricted their use to those who had the ability to use them appropriately and with care. They likely were extremely costly items and they needed to ensure they were protected and used with restriction. Even today the cost of tefillin is quite an investment. Yet we live at a time where this article is more affordable and accessible than it has ever been. It shouldn't be a surprise that in ancient times a person living on the most basic of basics couldn't afford them.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean they were uncommon in terms of use in religious practice. That just means the Rabbinum excused everyday Jews from a mitzvah they otherwise could not perform on their limited income.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, I'm sure you've heard of Qumran (the location of the Qumran caves where they found the dead sea scrolls)</p>\n<p>There were multiple types of scrolls found in these cave systems. One of these cave systems <strong>(Caves 4a and 4b) contained 21 tefillin and 7 mezuzot)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://toldotyisrael.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/qumran_phylactery.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">An example of the tefillin found (Notice it still contains scrolls)</a></p>\n<p>This is important for two reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It was found in abundance.</strong> They didn't find a single tefillin, they found 21 of them. That implies these were an everyday item and being used widely since so many were found.</li>\n<li><strong>Archeological materials only really exist for items and things which\nwere common.</strong> This point is specific to the science of how things get preserved. Finding scrolls and materials from ancient times isn't easy. These items need to be preserved under unique natural circumstances which prevent their degradation. Rare items are almost never found because there are fewer of them in existence. They have a lower chance of undergoing those unique preservation circumstances to protect them. Common things are around in greater abundance which means they have a higher chance of being preserved. <em>It's like playing lottery with 1 ticket vs playing lottery with 200,000 tickets. Your chances are greater.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Think about what is most commonly found in archeological digs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Food remains or pottery</li>\n<li>Clothing or fabric remains</li>\n<li>Tools or weapon remains</li>\n<li>Human remains</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are extremely abundant things. It makes sense we would find them in archeological digs.</p>\n<p><strong>The core of his argument is based on an assumption.</strong> That assumption is Jews weren't doing something because they didn't believe it to be important. It only became important when they began competing with a parallel Jewish system which rejected Oral Torah.</p>\n<p>How many ancient Israelites do you think were koshering their kitchens? It very likely was not a common issue in everyday life because nobody had the capacity to renovate the small area of their dwelling where they cooked. That doesn't mean they didn't take kashrut seriously.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hashkafic reasons for not teaching secular topics\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are hashkafic reasons that some Jewish schools not teach secular science and only focus on religious education, when there are doctrines in Kabbalah about the natural universe being manifestations of Hashem and the Torah? It seems like there are a lot of reasons from kabbalistic doctrine why learning about Hashem’s attributes from the natural world would be important. Is there a reason in Judaism why not studying science or other secular subjects would be a good thing?</p>\n<p>Do any Rabbanim have writings which explain this philosophy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Putting aside the general issue of secular studies in Yeshivas this question assumes that (1) everyone is agreement that there are a lot of reasons from kabbalistic doctrine why learning about Hashem’s attributes from the natural world would be important and (2)if science were taught in a general sense in Yeshivas then such knowledge would be derived.</p>\n<p>If that were true then the question would not be limited to contemporary Yeshivas, one can ask the same question about Volozhin or for that matter go all the way back to Sura, Pumpedisa and Nehardea and ask the same question as none of those places taught science or any other secular subjects. Much of the opposition to Yeshivas teaching secular subjects is the result of the precedent set by those places. (Yes, I know there were exceptions)  There  is much debate on this subject and ability to bring  proof either way from Torah  sources spanning millennia . The fact that it was not done seems to indicate that doing so for the sole purpose of teaching such subject is not the correct way.</p>\n<p>If someone were studying a specific secular science  for the sole purpose of understanding Torah then not only there be no opposition it would be supported. Rav Ahron Kotler who was from the strongest opponents  of secular subjects in Yeshivas told someone that studying a book on botany to understand something written in Seder Zeroim it would be considered Limud HaTorah (I heard this second hand) Conversely some of the big proponents of learning science do not seem to end up understanding Torah from what I see from them. (I saw an article not so long ago written by someone who actually <strong>heads</strong> a Torah/Science group.  He had written an article questioning why the Mishna says something about fish scales (kaskeshes) that doesn't seem to always be scientifically true. The article was complete nonsense and ignorance  because what  he was referring to as scales would not have the halachic status of fish scales (kaskeshes)according to the Torah. Therefore the article's question did not start. )</p>\n\n\n",

This idea can be found in the Sfas Emes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefat_Emet%2C_Exodus%2C_Bo.1.3?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%90%D7%90%22%D7%96%20%D7%9E%D7%95%22%D7%A8&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Parshas Bo, sv. אא\"ז מו\"ר)</a>.</p>\n<p>My question, based on the above, is as follow:</p>\n<p>It is a known idea that if the Jewish people would stay in Mitzrayim any longer, they would fall to the 50th gate of tumah (kelipah/impurity) and the saving of them would be much more difficult <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beit_HaLevi_on_Torah%2C_Bo.29?vhe=Beit_Halevi_al_HaTorah,_Warsaw,_1884&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Beis HaLevi, Parshas Bo, sv.  והנה בהגדה של פסח)</a>. So, how is putting darkness over the earth a way to remove that kelipah? It would seem logical that in order to remove (spiritual) darkness, you'll need to bring in more light. So, based on the above, how did the bringing of darkness in Mitzrayim as a makkah, serve as a rectification of the kelipah of darkness and bringing in more light?</p>\n<p>(Similary, the Shivlei Pinchas, Bo 5775 writes that \"Since darkness is the opposite of light, HKB”H correspondingly imposed darkness on the Egyptians.\" - but this is hard to understand, since in order to dispose the darkness, you will need light, right?).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To summarize the question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maharal of Prague</strong>: 10 מכות of Shemos || 10 מאמרות of Bereishis</li>\n<li><strong>Shem MiShmuel</strong>: within the Maharal’s idea - מכת חשך || the statement of ויהי אור</li>\n<li>Q. How did darkness in מצרים rectify of the קליפה of darkness and bringing in more light?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The missing piece here is likely the line in מכת חשך of ולכל בני ישראל <strong>היה אור במושבתם</strong>.</p>\n<p>From this it can be that what the Maharal and Shem MiShmuel are implying is that part and parcel of מכת חשך was that there would be <strong>אור only for בני ישראל</strong> and that there is a strong hint here that this אור wasn’t merely a non-חשך where the miracle and aberration were the חשך, but that <strong>even the light was of a miraculous G-d-directed nature just like the light of the first day of creation</strong>. Not merely sunlight with an absence of darkness, but a much more profound presence of a type of heavenly, positive light.</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t be surprising if the nucleus of this idea stems from the fact that there are <strong>only two times in the Torah</strong> where the root of <strong>היה</strong> immediately precedes the word <strong>אור</strong>.  Each of these two occurrences happen to come on the heels of, and in contradistinction to, a mention of <strong>חשך</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והארץ <strong>היתה</strong> תהו ובהו <strong>וחשך</strong> על פני תהום…..ויאמר אלקים <strong>יהי אור ויהי אור</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ויהי חשך</strong> אפלה בכל ארץ מצרים…..ולכל בני ישראל <strong>היה אור</strong> במושבתם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed in בראשית א:ג, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.10.23?p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.1.3.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רבינו בחיי</a></strong> hints to this linkage of pesukim and wording.  He quotes the following from <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereshit_Rabbah.3.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בראשית רבה ג:ה</a></strong> which links each of the <strong>five times</strong> אור is mentioned at the very beginning of the Torah (<strong>אור, אור, האור, האור, לאור</strong>)  to how each of the חמשה חומשי תורה represent concepts of אור. But he also makes an important addition and inference to our pasuk in question (<em>highlighted below</em>) to sharpen the idea and which the original wording of the midrash doesn’t mention:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר סימון ה' פעמים כתיב כאן אורה כנגד חמשה חומשי תורה, יהי אור כנגד\nספר בראשית שבו נתעסק הקב\"ה וברא עולמו, <strong>ויהי אור, כנגד ואלה שמות</strong> שבו\nנגאלו ישראל ממצרים ויצאו מאפלה, <strong>וכתיב ביה (שמות י כג) ולכל בני ישראל</strong>\n<strong>היה אור במושבותם</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the following sources on the level of דרש, there is a consistent message that the light that בני ישראל did have did have was of a totally miraculous nature in both <strong>where</strong> the light was available and also in the <strong>nature</strong> of the light.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shemot_Rabbah.14.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>שמות רבה יד:ג</strong></a> we see that בני ישראל not only had light in Goshen and not only light in their own homes in case they dwelt in the heart of מצרים but <strong>even wherever they would walk in מצרים</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֶׁהָיָה יִשְׂרָאֵל נִכְנַס לְתוֹךְ בָּתֵּיהֶן שֶׁל מִצְרִים <strong>וְהָיוּ</strong>\n<strong>רוֹאִין בָּהֶן</strong> כְּלֵי כֶסֶף וּכְלֵי זָהָב וּשְׂמָלוֹת, אִם הָיוּ\nאוֹמְרִים אֵין לָנוּ לְהַשְׁאִיל לָכֶם הָיוּ יִשְרָאֵל אוֹמְרִים לָהֶן\nהֲרֵי הוּא בְּמָקוֹם פְּלוֹנִי, בְּאוֹתָהּ שָׁעָה הָיוּ הַמִּצְרִיִּים\nאוֹמְרִים אִם הָיוּ אֵלּוּ רוֹצִים לְשַׁקֵּר בָּנוּ הָיוּ נוֹטְלִין\nאוֹתָן בִּימֵי הַחשֶׁךְ וְלֹא הָיִינוּ מַרְגִּישִׁין, <strong>שֶׁהֲרֵי רָאוּ</strong>\n<strong>אוֹתָן כְּבָר</strong> אַחַר שֶׁלֹא נָגְעוּ חוּץ מִדַּעְתֵּנוּ כְּמוֹ כֵן לֹא\nיַחֲזִיקוּ, וְהָיוּ מַשְׁאִילִין לָהֶן, לְקַיֵּם מַה שֶּׁנֶּאֱמַר\n(בראשית טו, יד): וְאַחֲרֵי כֵן יֵצְאוּ בִּרְכֻשׁ גָּדוֹל, הֲדָא הוּא\n<strong>דִכְתִיב: וּלְכָל בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל הָיָה אוֹר וגו', בְּאֶרֶץ גּשֶׁן</strong>\n<strong>לֹא נֶאֱמַר אֶלָּא בְּמוֹשְׁבֹתָם, שֶׁכָּל מָקוֹם שֶׁהָיָה יְהוּדִי</strong>\n<strong>נִכְנַס הָיָה אוֹר נִכְנַס וּמֵאִיר לוֹ מַה שֶּׁבַּחָבִיּוֹת</strong>\n<strong>וּבַתֵּבוֹת וּבַמַּטְמוֹנִיּוֹת.</strong> וַעֲלֵיהֶם נֶאֱמַר (תהלים קיט, קה):\nנר לרגלי דברך <strong>ואור</strong> לנתיבתי וגו'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That during the days of darkness, בני ישראל would be enter the homes that were darkened for the מצרים and <strong>see</strong> where the valuables were kept for the purpose of requesting them after the מכה was over and in this way the מצרים couldn’t deny their presence and couldn’t deny their request.</p>\n<p>The nature and cause for this light and ability to see is explained in the following:</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.10.23?with=Targum%20Jonathan%20on%20Exodus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>תרגום יונתן</strong></a> on ולכל בני ישראל היה אור במושבתם states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּלְכָל בְּנֵי יִשְרָאֵל <strong>הֲוָה נְהוֹרָא</strong> לְמִקְבּוֹר רַשִׁיעַיָא דִי\nבֵינֵיהוֹן דְּמִיתַן <strong>וְזַכָּאַיָא לְמֶעֱסוֹק בְּמִצְוָתָא</strong>\nבְּמוֹתְבָנֵיהוֹן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Light</strong> for בני ישראל to bury the wicked among them who die during the plague <strong>and for the righteous to engage in מצוות</strong>.  Unclear still from this whether the light was a cause for the מצוות or the מצוות were a cause for the light.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>מדרש הגדול</strong> on our pasuk, in מכת חשך, it has the following and goes a step further than the <strong>תרגום יונתן</strong>, but might even be explaining or expanding upon the Targum when it contrasts בני ישראל vs. the אומות העולם (<em>indeed <strong>ר' דוד צבי הופמן</strong>, in the section of הוספות in his edition of the <strong>מכילתא דרשב\"י</strong>, was of the opinion that the source of the idea in the מדרש הגדול originally stemmed from the מכילתא דרשב\"י and it is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.10.23?with=Mekhilta%20DeRabbi%20Shimon%20Ben%20Yochai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his version of this midrash that appears on Sefaria</a></em>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר' יצחק אוי להן לאומות העולם שהן <strong>נידונין לפי מעשיהן</strong> שנ' (ישעיה כ\"ט\nט\"ו) הוי המעמיקים מה' לסתיר עצה והיה במחשך מעשיהם לפיכך לוקין בחשך שנ'\n(תהלים ל\"ה ו') יהי דרכם חשך וחלקלקות <strong>אבל ישראל</strong> מה כת' בהן ולכל בני\nישראל היה אור במושבתם <strong>שהן עסיקין בתורה ובמצוות</strong> שכת' בהן (משלי ו' כ\"ג)\nכי <strong>נר מצוה ותורה אור</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this version, it’s Torah <strong>and</strong> מצוות where these are an ultimate <strong>cause of light and a source of light</strong> just like the wickedness of the מצרים was the cause of their darkness.  So when the Jews had light during מכת חשך, it was a profound presence of a positive spiritual light.</p>\n<p>On the level of פשט, there are a number of opinions in the מפרשים which address the scope of where בני ישראל did have light.

The latter three make a the דיוק brought earlier in a midrash בְּאֶרֶץ גּשֶׁן לֹא נֶאֱמַר אֶלָּא <strong>בְּמוֹשְׁבֹתָם</strong> - and say due to this דיוק even על פי פשט the נס was that בני ישראל had the benefit of light even within the darkened homes of the מצרים.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But on whatever scope the נס happened (<em>by region, by home or by person</em>) one can still say that בני ישראל merited a special positive light in a pinpointed sense that differentiated them from the מצרים.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I believe the answer to be as follows:</p>\n<p>There is an important idea, expressed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nefesh_HaChayim%2C_Gate_I.12.14?vhe=Vilna,_1874&lang=he&sbsq=%D7%9B%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A8&with=SidebarSearch&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nefesh Hachaim</a>, that the idea of Middah K'negged Midah is that the damage one caused to the world is brought upon them, thus removing the effect of the sin. So in this case, the Egyptians brought darkness to the world. It was rectified by having the darkness manifest in the physical world, as punishment, thus cleansing the spiritual world.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shimush: Mar'os on Niddah - why does it work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Hilchos Niddah, expertise in מראות, examining bedikos or kesamim (intentional examinations, or accidental stains on the woman's undergarments) to decide if they are tamei - which would make the woman a niddah - or tahor, is generally learned by \"shimush\". This is a process where the student sits down with a Rav who is an expert, and they look over cases together. The talmid/student sees the various factors the Rav takes into account (various colors, sizes, shapes,...) and eventually gains the skill to decide cases as well, presumably with the same result as the Rav. At that point the Rav grants the student permission to decide cases on his own.<br />\nTo me, this sounds very much like the original process for transmission of תורה שבעל פה, the Oral Torah. The teacher taught the student everything about the Torah orally, one subject at a time, and eventually gave the student \"semichah\", permission to rule on cases himself. Since the study was personal, the Rav/teacher was able to gauge that his student understood each subject properly.<br />\nWe don't do this any more for the rest of the Torah. These days, the \"shimush\" for most topics is that the talmid studies most of what he learns from sefarim, maybe hears some shiurim on them by the rebbi, or can ask him questions, and is perhaps given a test at the end of his studies by the rebbi or another Rav who can tell if he knows the topic. No one expects that he will answer every issue exactly the same as the Rav would.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why does the particular topic of מראות require shimush? Does it? Does anyone teach it in the more common way done these days for the rest of the Torah, say with picture books?</li>\n<li>On the contrary, it seems to me that מראות is a place where the original shimush would be very <em>difficult</em> to do properly! If the issue is recognizing exact colors, how are you going to learn that from a bunch of cases? Color is a continuum, of several dimensions (RGB...) and surely the result will be that there will be borderline edge cases that the student might never see often enough to learn. Lemon yellow, gold, a <em>little</em> bit orange, a little lighter, a little darker,... (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors</a>, and you're just getting started on all the possible variation.) Repeat this many times, generation after generation, and I would expect the borders to drift, maybe very far! Wouldn't it be better (these days) to give precise guidelines?</li>\n<li>As a matter of fact, it seems to me that was what they used to do! We don't judge shades of red any more, and all red is judged tamei since the times of the Rishonim - but in the mishnah and gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.19a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 19a-21a</a> they did. And the mishnah and gemara goes through various exact examples of how to judge which shades of red are tamei, with incredible precision: \"red as the blood that flows from the smallest finger of the hand, which was wounded and later healed and was subsequently wounded again. And this is not referring to the finger of any person, but specifically to the finger of a young man who has not yet married a woman. And furthermore, this does not mean any young man; rather, until what age must he be? Until twenty years old.\" See there for more examples. It is clear from the gemara that they often did this in practice, like bringing in a cup of wine from the Sharon, mixed just so, and comparing it with the stain. It sounds like they did give precise guidelines, not just go through a lot of practice cases.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What am I missing here?</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, in the later verse 14, the word \"yir'eh\" is also translated in Christian bibles as \"provide\". However, it still very much literally means \"show\" or \"see\" or \"seen\". Jewish translations tend to prefer translating the Hebrew as literally as possible.</p>\n<p>So the answer to your question is that it depends on what do you mean by the original meaning. If you mean the literal meaning, then you would go with show/see/seen. If you mean the contextual meaning, then provide certainly makes sense in verse 8, but in verse 14 it might be more debatable, given that in the end, an angel of God did show himself to Abraham (verse 11).</p>\n\n\n",

Teshuva is all about internal, personal regret; thus, any prerequisite that demands that upon repenting one must have in mind that God commands so is inimical to Teshuva. This is why no blessing is recited before performing T'shuva. To state that 'God commands us to repent' before repenting defeats the purpose. Repentance must be intrinsic - it loses all meaning if there is a requirement to think about/state via blessing how God's teshuva command is THE reason that I changed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XXggO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XXggO.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>He compares this to a commoner who sins before a king. He or she would not dare say to the king that he or she is now sorry because the king demands this. Such a statement is highly insulting. Rather he or she will confess his or her profound, personal sense of remorse and wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, the (M\"C) Minchat Chinuch (Mitzva 364) posits that per the Rambam there is NO obligation to do teshuva. (If you want to do it and do so per the Torah's ways, that teshuva is a mitzva - just like the mitzva of divorce):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רק כיון דתשובה אינה מצוה כמ\"ש אם כן מ\"ע זו הוי כהרבה מצות מהתרי\"ג שכ' הר\"מ בסמ\"ק שאינה מצוה לעשות או שלא לעשות רק העשיה על תואר כך וכך נחשב מצוה כמו גירושין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What happens to the Beit Yitzchak's no-requirement-to-do-teshuva-for-God's-sake upon analyzing the M\"C?</p>\n<p>A sins. A does not per the Torah need to repent. But if A chooses to do so properly (at which point his actions are actions of 'commandment'), shall we say that there is no requirement to intend to do this act due to the 'commandment' because this would undermine the intrinsic and personal nature of repentance? This would be the normative B\"Y approach.</p>\n<p>Or would the B\"Y say that per the M\"C, a demand is placed on A (a la all the other mitzvot) that A think about the teshuva 'commandment' as the impetus for A's actions given that there is no actual obligation to repent and thus such a I-did-it-for-God-once-I-chose-to-opt-for-it kavana would not undermine the truly volitional nature of teshuva?</p>\n<p>If the latter approach is true and that the B\"Y agrees that per the M\"C a prerequisite kavana to A's teshuva exists - this became a 'commandment' because A chose to change his or her life and thus A must think of fulfilling this 'commandment' - the B\"Y would likely posit that per the M\"C there must be another reason no blessing is made before repenting.</p>\n\n\n",

(Devarim 31:22) \"And Moses wrote this\nsong (32:1-43). <strong>The fifth</strong>, that of Joshua, viz. (Joshua 10:12)\n\"Then Joshua spoke to the L–rd on the day the L–rd delivered, etc.\"\n<strong>The sixth</strong>, that of Devorah and Barak, viz. (Judges 5:1) \"And Devorah and Barak the son of Avinoam sang, etc.\" <strong>The seventh</strong>, that\nof David, viz. (II Samuel 22:1) \"And David spoke to the L–rd the words\nof this song, etc\". <strong>The eighth</strong>, that of Solomon, viz. (Psalms\n30:1) \"A psalm, a song of the inauguration of the Temple of David\"...\n<strong>The ninth</strong> (song): (II Chronicles 20:21) \"And he (Yehoshafat) took counsel with the people, and he set up singes to the L–rd and lauders\nof (His) majestic holiness. When they went out before the vanguard (of\nthe army) they said; 'Give thanks to the L–rd, for His lovingkindness\nis forever!'\" Why is this thanksgiving different from all the other\nsin the Torah, where it is written \"Give thanks to the L–rd for (the\ngood, for His lovingkindness is forever\"? — It is to say, as it were,\n<strong>that there is no rejoicing before Him over the destruction of the wicked</strong>. If over that of the wicked there is no rejoicing, how much\nmore so (is there grief) over that of the righteous, one of whom is\nover and against the entire world, viz. (Mishlei 10:25) \"And the\nrighteous one is the foundation of the world\". <strong>The tenth</strong> (song) in\ntime to come, viz. (Isaiah 42;10) \"Sing to the L–rd a new song, His\npraise from the end of the earth (Ibid. 48:42) \"Say: The L–rd has\nredeemed His servant Jacob. All of the (other) songs are denominated\nin the feminine (\"zoth\"). Just as a female bears (and then travails\nagain), so, the past salivations were followed by subjugation. But the\nfuture (ultimate) redemption will not be followed by subjugation —\nwherefore it is denominated in the masculine (\"zeh\" [viz. Isaiah\n26:1]). As it is written (Jeremiah 30:6) \"Ask now and see if a male\nhas ever given birth. Why, then, do I see that every man puts his\nhands upon his loins (as a woman giving birth?\") For just as a male\ndoes not bear (and thus travail), so, the future redemption will not\nbe followed by subjugation. As it is written (Isaiah 45:17) \"Israel\nwill be saved by the L–rd, an eternal salvation. You will not be\nashamed or abashed forever.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There idea that the previous nine speak of the destruction of our enemies and the tenth won't, doesn't seem to be true from this Midrash, in fact (as I highlighted) the Midrash emphasizes the fact that the <em>ninth</em> shirah differs in that Hashem is pained by the destruction of the wicked.</p>\n\n\n",

What is she currently wearing?</p>\n<p>If it's talking about a case of one who has been wearing shatnez and just discovers it in the street, it is better (at least for a man) to be naked than wear shatnez, as mentioned in Brachot 19b regarding a man, making no explicit distinction for a woman.

Seemingly the Gemara says it's better for a man to be completely naked than wear shatnez, which is also a problem of tznius/giluy arayos, but maybe the prohibition of giliy arayos in the sense that it should never be violated even in a life or death situation is only referring to forbidden relations).</p>\n<p>However the wording of the question implies otherwise:</p>\n<p>\"So basically, she is in a position where she has to wear clothes <em>out</em>, but her only choices of clothes are either immodest or contain shaatnez?\"</p>\n<p>This is implying that she's currently at home, where she is not required to wear anything (unless men are at the house?

In particular note the concluding paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After nefilat apayim, one should raise his head and briefly recite supplications while sitting. Afterward, it is the custom to recite the passage Va'anachnu lo neida, \"We do not know what to do...,\" as if to say: We have prayed in every position in which a person could pray—sitting, standing and prostrated—just as was done by Moses, our teacher. We have done all that we know. Now, G‑d, \"remember Your mercy and kindness . . . save us and atone for our sins for the sake of Your Name!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While \"prayed in every position\" used broadly will take care of everyone on every day, used specifically for the parts of Tachanun requires, for regular Ashkenazi Nusach, adding a standing up part <em>except</em> on Monday/Thursday Shacharis.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the Zohar only has 13 expressions, and the Kav HaYashar states that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These correspond to the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy and should be recited in a single breath so that there will be no pause between them. If one does interrupt in the middle of them a flame comes out from beneath the wings of the cherubim and a great voice announces, “So-and-so interrupted in the middle of the praises of his Master!” His merits are also erased so that he may not behold the majesty of the King, as it is written, “And he will not see the King’s majesty”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, do note that the Mishnah Berurah rules according to the Chid\"a and the Gr\"a that one should rather say them nicely like one would praise a king, than hurriedly in a single breath.</p>\n\n\n",

So please excuse me for posting this again.</p>\n<p>The early Jewish philosophers/thinkers (Saadia, Ramabam, Bachya Ibn Pakuda in Shaar hayichud) stressed the absolute unity of God, i.e., that Hashem is absolutely one, a unified entity with no distinct parts or attributes. As we say in the Ani Maamin הוּא יָחִיד וְאֵין יְחִידוּת כָּמוֹהוּ בְּשׁוּם פָּנִים</p>\n<p>The sefirot, the divine emanations, which are also in some way identified with the Godhead (Shechina for example is distinct from the ein sof, but paradoxically also identified with it), stand in direct contrast to the absolute unity of God. Some (see teshuvas Rivush 156) even went so far to compare this to the Christian concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">trinity.</a></p>\n<p>My question is how did the early kabbalists (like the Ramban and Rashba, who were also philosophers and great thinkers) reconcile this belief with the belief in the absolute unity of God? Did they disagree with the concept that God must be an absolute single entity, or did they reconcile this in some other way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The simplest way to conceive of this is to take note of how one responds when hearing the repetition of each blessing in the Amidah prayer.</p>\n<p>After hearing, Blessed are <strong>You</strong>, <strong>HaShem</strong> <em>(G-d's name)</em>..., those listening respond, \"<strong>Blessed is He</strong> and <strong>blessed is His name</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>That G-d, at <strong>His</strong> essence, <strong>His</strong> being (מהות), <em>transcends all letters and names (or descriptions).</em> But for <strong>finite, created beings</strong> to have any relationship with the <strong>Infinite</strong> (<em>something which is impossible for the finite</em>), G-d provides us with His names, that G-d's names are also associated to the Sefirot.</p>\n<p>This is the essence of the Aleinu prayer that we received from <strong>Yehoshua ben Nun</strong>, that we bend the knee, bow to and acknowledge, <em>the Holy One</em>, blessed is <strong>He</strong>. And in that prayer it then associates <em><strong>He</strong></em> with the <em>various names of G-d</em>. It emphasizes that all the various names of G-d are referring to <strong>He</strong>, who transcends names altogether. That <em>there is no aspect of other</em>. That <strong>He</strong>, <em>who transcends names altogether</em> and His name(s) are one.</p>\n<p>This is one of the intentions one is to have when reciting the opening lines of the Shema (<em>which we received directly from Moshe Rabbeinu, the teacher of Yehoshuah ben Nun</em>):</p>\n<p>Hear (<em>Understand</em>) Israel, the L-rd (<em>G-d's name</em>) is our G-d (<em>meaning <strong>He</strong></em>), the L-rd (<em>G-d's name</em>) is <strong>one</strong>.</p>\n<p>So no, the early kabbalists did not disagree with the concept that G-d must be an absolute single entity (<em><strong>, that G-d is one</strong></em>). They were continuing a tradition that they had received directly, teacher to student, from generation to generation directly back to Moshe Rabbeinu and his primary student, Yehoshua ben Nun.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<h4>Hashem is Beyond <em>Definition</em></h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין סוף הוא שלימות בלי חסרון וא\"ת שיש לו כח בלי גבול ואין לו כח בגבול\nאתה מחסר שלימותו</p>\n<p>-<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Be%27ur_Eser_S%27firot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ביאור עשר ספירות</a>, רבי עזריאל מגרונה ז\"ל<br />\nc.1175  – c.1235 CE</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you've put in a recent comment, the full answer is going to be a long study's worth, all we can do is provide a few tidbits for you to pursue. Here's one.</p>\n<p>The quoted idea is a key point that was brought in this short work, by a student of R' Yitzchak of Akko T'zl. This work was written to answer your question!</p>\n<p>It translates as \"<strong>The Eternal One is perfect, without flaw. And if you say that He has Infinite power, but He doesn't have power in the limited/finite, you are detracting from His perfection</strong>\".</p>\n<p>This is a key point, and is brought forward into modern Kabbalistic thought, brought in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodat_HaKodesh_(Gabbai).1.8.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodat Hakodesh 1:8</a>, and into Chassidut (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31674&st=&pgnum=55&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Hamamaarim 5657 p. 48</a>). Therefore it is fair in my opinion to state that this has been the opinion of most if not all the early Kabbalists including the Ramban and Rashba you mention.</p>\n<p>The later Kabbalists did not differ in this regard, quoting and elucidating this idea (as follows).</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Introductory Explanation</h4>\n<p><strong>The point is that we do not view Hashem as Infinite (or finite)</strong>. We view Him as <em><strong>Undefined</strong></em>. Not just because we can't define Him, but because there are absolutely no limits on Him whatsoever. <strong>All we can say is that He is complete, simple, and everything comes from Him</strong>. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gevurot_Hashem%2C_Second_Introduction_to_Gevurot_Hashem.14?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gevurot Hashem by the Maharal T'zl, Hakdama 2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל הוא יתברך שקראו רז\"ל בשם \"הקדוש ברוך הוא\", ולא נקרא \"השכל ברוך\nהוא\", כי אמיתת עצמו לא נודע, <strong>רק שהוא נבדל מכל גשם וגוף ומכל הנמצאים</strong>,\nועל זה נאמר \"קדוש ברוך הוא\", שענין \"קדוש\" נאמר על מי שהוא נבדל, כי הוא\nיתברך פשוט בתכלית הפשיטות. <strong>ומזה בעצמו שהוא בתכלית הפשיטות, אין דבר\nנבדל ממנו</strong>, כי הדבר שיש לו גדר ומיוחד בדבר מה, בשביל אותו גדר נבדל ממנו\nדבר שאינו בגדרו. <em>אבל מפני כי הוא יתברך פשוט ואין לו גדר כלל, <strong>אין דבר\nנבדל ממנו</strong></em>. ואם כן, הוא יודע הכל, והוא יכול הכל, וכל זה מפני שאין לו\nגדר יוגדר בדבר מיוחד, ובשביל זה <strong>הכל נמצא מאתו</strong> גם כן</p>\n<p>Our sages, of blessed memory, refer to Hashem as \"the Holy One,\nBlessed be He\" and not \"the Intelligent One\", because the truth of His\nbeing is unknown, except that <strong>He is separated from all forms of\nsubstance and body that can be found</strong>. This is why they call Him \"Holy\nOne Blessed Be He\". The term \"holy\" denotes an entity that is apart\nand removed, and Hashem is simple in the most ultimate sense of\nsimplicity. But <strong>precisely because Hashem is the ultimate simplicity\n(abstraction), there is nothing that is excluded from Him.</strong></p>\n<p><em>When something has a definition, and is distinguished by certain\ncharacteristics, that same definition will exclude form it things that\nare outside of that definition.

The Zohar captures this in the point that Hashem is One, <em>but not in the numerical sense</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tikkunei_Zohar.17a.2?vhe=Tikkunei_Zohar&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ptach Eliyahu</a>).</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Further Reading</h4>\n<p>We can also use Chassidut Chabad to understand this as well, so if you fancy doing a deep dive, there is a wealth of material on this point, starting in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/6240/jewish/Shaar-Hayichud-Vehaemunah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya, Shaar HaYichud VeHaEmuna</a> (which is also a work treating this exact question), as well as the rest of the sefer.</p>\n<p>To go into the nitty gritty of all the different Kabbalistic opinions about the Sefirot and their relationship with Hashem Himself, there is a work dedicated to that: <em>Drash Shalosh Shitot</em>, found in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/15942\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or Hatorah Inyanim</a> by the Tzemach Tzedek T'zl, and a more contemporary work in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/60795\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Erechim Vol III, p. 192 onward</a>.

The Maimonidean conception is that God is completely singular, formless, and impossible to describe with any sort of accuracy due to the limited nature of the human mind. This idea was so well regarded in later generations, that every Jew nowadays defaults to the Maimonidean position as accepted Orthodoxy.</p>\n<p>However, believe it or not, this position was actually very controversial when first proposed by the Rambam, as many of his suppositions were based in Aristotelian Philosophy. Many of the Anti-Maimonideans in Provence and the students of the Baalei Tosafot in Ashkenaz took issue with Rambam's allegorization of certain Biblical passages that stated that God had \"hands\" or \"eyes\" or felt emotions, and the like. In fact, Rabbi Moshe Taku (one of the late Baalei Tosafot) goes so far as to say that God indeed DOES have some sort of body, and it is heretical to say that God is infinite, for you would be placing God in dirty places such as the restroom and the like (similar to the accusation of heresy that would be leveled against the Hasidim much later).</p>\n<p>Going back to the subject of the early Kabbalists, there was a Machloket between themselves if the Sefirot were literal divisions within God or they were manifestations of the divine through different channels (as would be advocated for by the Cordoveran and Lurianic traditions). The Kabbalists who held that the Sefirot were literal divisions within God weren't bothered by this as they did not hold of the Maimonidean divine in any serious sense. Now, this being the case, how could they possibly take issue with Christianity if they held divisions within the divine themselves?</p>\n<p>As Prof. Marc B. Shapiro points out, many medieval Jews had much less of an issue with the conception of the Trinity in Christian Theology, than with the notion that God would willingly incarnate himself as a man, and then die for the sins of mankind. That was egregious to Jews, but the Trinity was only really taken issue with by the Maimonideans and other hardcore \"unitarians\" (for lack of a better word).</p>\n\n\n",

It's not clear from the text that this was an almost last-minute insertion (although, as he admits himself, there's no textual evidence that clearly proves that it can't be a later insertion).</p>\n<p>So, say that it's an earlier comment on Beresheet.

And they established numerous cities and took possession of the whole of Libya as far as the Pillars of Heracles, and there they have lived even up to my time, using the Phoenician tongue. They also built a fortress in Numidia, where now is the city called Tigisis.

    "content": "# The Propensity of Yishmael's Progeny is NOT to be Contentious Towards Yisrael - What Happened?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Ran states (Drashot Haran 2):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דרשות הר\"ן דרוש ב:\nשארית הגוים אשר קדמו לאברהם כבר ראו כי בו בחר השם יתברך, וזרעו ראוי להיות יורש (ארץ) עצר, ולזה לא תרע עינם בממשלתו כלל. וכן ראוי להיות דבר האומות המסתעפות ממשפחת אברהם לבל יקנאו בזרע יצחק, אבל יחלקו כבוד לבני הגבירה, כי כן למדום אבותם, ולזה מונחים לטבעם לא ירעו ולא ישחיתו קדש ה' אשר אהב, ולא תרע עינם ולא יקנאו בממשלת ישראל, The rest of the nations that preceded Avraham already saw that God had chosen him and that his descendants were fit to inherit the crown. Therefore, they did not resent his rulership. It was similarly appropriate for the nations branching out from the family of Avraham (Yishmael and sons of Keturah) not to be envious of Yitzchak's descendants, rather they would accord honor to the children of the senior Wife (Sarah), for so their fathers had taught them. And therefore, it was implanted in their natures that they would neither injure nor destroy the holy of God Blessed Be He, which He loved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi equates 'Arabians' with Yishmael (Genesis 21):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(ישעיהו כ\"א), כְּשֶׁהָיוּ מוֹלִיכִין אוֹתָם אֵצֶל עַרְבִיִּים, הָיוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל אוֹמְרִים לְשׁוֹבֵיהֶם בְּבַקָּשָׁה מִכֶּם הוֹלִיכוּנוּ אֵצֶל בְּנֵי דוֹדֵנוּ יִשְׁמָעֵאל וִירַחֲמוּ עָלֵינוּ, When they were bringing them near the Arabians the Israelites said to their captors, “We beg of you bring us to the children of our uncle, Ishmael, who will certainly show pity to us.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Assuming that the Ran agrees with Rashi, and that he also holds that today's Arabs are those same 'Arabians,' aren't they, by nature, NOT supposed to be contentious or belligerent towards Yisrael or its ancestral claims? What changed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbenu Nissim lived in 14th c. Barcelona, i.e. Christian Iberia. The period in which he lived was wrought with intense Christian/Church orchestrated anti-Jewish violence. Thousands of Jews were slaughtered and thousands others forced to convert to Christianity. They perpetually fled from kingdom to kingdom (Aragon, Castille, etc.) seeking refuge and an alleviation from their great affliction. This is the context in which he wrote and it cannot be discounted. Given that the greatest tormentors of the Jews of his native land were Christian (conceived of as בני-עשו/אדום), his emphasis reflects that.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless that is not to say that he was oblivious to Muslim persecution of Jews, indeed in the first derashah he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עד שהראשון שהתחיל זה והוא אברהם קרה לו מה שקרה עם נמרוד עד שהוצרך\nלעזוב ארצו וללכת אל ארץ אחרת ואין ספק שאותם צדיקים שהיו יחידים בדורות\nההם היה להם חילוק האומות והממשלות לטוב ולתועלת כי כאשר תצר להם האמונה\nבאיזה מלכות ישוטטו אל ארץ אחרת שיוכלו שם לעבוד ה' יתברך כרצונם כאשר\nקורה לנו בגלותנו היום כי כאשר נתחדש שמד בארץ ישמעאל נסו פליטיהם אל ארץ\nאדום ומאדום לישמעאל וזה אצלנו מחיה מעם בעבדותינו</p>\n<p>So that the first to begin this call, Abraham, experienced what he did\nat the hands of Nimrod until he was compelled to leave his land and go\nto a different one. Now, unquestionably, for those righteous men who\nwere unique in those generations the division of peoples and kingdoms\nwas a good and a benefit. For when the people of a certain kingdom\nwould oppress them, they would move on to a different land, where they\ncould serve the Lord as they desired, as is the case in our present\nday exile. <strong>For when enforced conversion began in the Ishmaelite lands</strong>,\nthe Jews fled to the lands of Edom, and from [the lands of] Edom, back to [the lands of]\nIshmael. And this gave us a lease on life in the midst of our\nafflictions and our toils.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this quote we see that he did not intend to imply that Ishmael does not nor never will persecute Jews.</p>\n<p>We are thus left with trying to understand what his intention was in the second derashah from which you quote. By light of what we know of the period and his other statement, I think that we must say that he was characterizing the motive, character, and intensity of the children of Esau (i.e. Edom/Christianity) in their persecution of Jews. He accordingly would have seen Ishmaelite oppression of Jews where/when it occurs as not similarly characterized by jealousy per se.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This doesn't fully answer the question but FWIW this may be relevant.</p>\n<p>See my answer here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/139589/is-the-original-nation-of-amalek-extinct/139782#139782\">Is the original nation of Amalek extinct?</a></p>\n<p>It would appear from that source that Nations surrounding Yisra'el can be considered Amalek and not Yishmael.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What’s more important, keeping Shabbat or Kibbud Av V’em?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a situation where these two conflict, which trumps the other?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>Shabbat.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9920/showrashi/true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Leviticus 19:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every man shall fear his mother and his father, and you shall observe My Sabbaths. I am the Lord, your God.       גאִ֣ישׁ אִמּ֤וֹ וְאָבִיו֙ תִּירָ֔אוּ וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַ֖י תִּשְׁמֹ֑רוּ אֲנִ֖י יְהוָֹ֥ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶֽם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi cites the Talmud, Bava Metzia 32b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Although I have admonished you regarding the fear of your father, nevertheless, if he tells you to desecrate the Sabbath, do not listen to him.”        וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַי תִּשְׁמֹרוּ: סָמַךְ שַׁבָּת לְמוֹרָא אָב, לוֹמַר אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהִזְהַרְתִּיךָ עַל מוֹרָא אָב, אִם יֹאמַר לְךָ חַלֵּל אֶת הַשַּׁבָּת, אַל תִּשְׁמַע לוֹ, וְכֵן בִּשְׁאָר כָּל הַמִּצְווֹת (בבא מציעא ל\"ב):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the verse means \"honor your parents, but what's even more important, keep Shabbat.\"</p>\n<p>There can be shades of grey if it's a conflict between, say, the parents' needs and something <em>preferred</em> by halacha about keeping Shabbat; if someone needs to take care of a parent they might have to pray at home and miss synagogue, for example; often something can be worked out to accommodate both. (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18469/honor-parents-who-want-you-to-violate-halacha\">See more here.</a>) But when push comes to shove, if the parent demands a black-on-white violation of Shabbat, the answer is \"no.\"</p>\n<p>Even then, it's important to try and maintain a respectful relationship; <em>\"I'm sorry but I can't do that\"</em>, not <em>\"I'm so much smarter than you and you're a terrible sinner.\"</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Talmud says that if you must choose between doing two mitzvot, do first the one that recurs more frequently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּדִיר וְשֶׁאֵינוֹ תָּדִיר — תָּדִיר קוֹדֵם  [Berakhot 27a and 51b, Pesachim 114a, Megillah 29b, Sukkah 54b, Horayot 13, and Zevachim Mishna 10:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, we put on tzitzit (that is, the tallit) before we put on tefillin, because tzitzit recurs every day, but tefillin recurs every day except Shabbat. [Sefer Ta'amei Haminhagim Umkorei Hadinim]</p>\n<p>As @Shalom said, you don't violate Shabbat because a parent asks you to.  However, if you have to decide which commandment to follow first, I would conclude that you must first tend to the needs of your parents, because that commandment is always present, but Shabbat is only one day out of seven.</p>\n\n\n",

How that pragmatically plays out nowadays for professionals is something to ask your local Orthodox rabbi.</p>\n<p>Consider that yichud (with an unmarried woman) was an expansion decree of King David and his court after the rape of Tamar. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.21a.24?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 21a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(שמואל ב יג, יט) ותקח תמר אפר על ראשה (ואת כתונת) הפסים אשר עליה קרעה תנא משמיה דר' יהושע בן קרחה גדר גדול גדרה תמר באותה שעה אמרו לבנות מלכים כך לבנות הדיוטות על אחת כמה וכמה אם לצנועות כך לפרוצות על אחת כמה וכמה אמר רב יהודה אמר רב באותה שעה גזרו  על הייחוד ועל הפנויה\nThe verse relates that after Amnon raped her: “And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of many colors that was on her” (II Samuel 13:19). The Sages taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: Tamar established a great fence at that time by way of her public outcry, as people said: If such an occurrence could happen to the daughters of kings, all the more so could it happen to the daughters of ordinary people. If such an occurrence could happen to modest women like Tamar, who resisted, all the more so could it happen to licentious women. Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: At that time they decreed about seclusion, that a man should not be secluded with women who are forbidden to him, and about a single woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יחוד דאורייתא הוא דאמר ר' יוחנן משום ר' שמעון בן יהוצדק רמז לייחוד מן התורה מניין שנאמר (דברים יג, ז) כי יסיתך אחיך בן אמך וכי בן אם מסית בן אב אינו מסית אלא לומר לך בן מתייחד עם אמו ואין אחר מתייחד עם כל עריות שבתורה\nThe Gemara objects: Seclusion with a woman forbidden by familial ties is prohibited by Torah law, and was not a rabbinic decree issued in the time of David. As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: From where is there an allusion to the halakha that seclusion is forbidden by Torah law? As it is stated: “If your brother, the son of your mother, entices you” (Deuteronomy 13:7). One can ask: But does the son of a mother entice, and does the son of a father not entice? Why mention only the son of a mother? Rather, this verse serves to tell you that only a son may be secluded with his mother. Sons are frequently with their mother, and two half-brothers of one mother consequently have the opportunity to grow close to one another. But another individual may not be secluded with those with whom relations are forbidden by the Torah, including a stepmother. Therefore, half-brothers of one father spend less time together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא אימא גזרו על ייחוד דפנויה\nSince seclusion, then, is prohibited by Torah law, how did Rav say that it was prohibited by a decree issued in King David’s time? Rather, say that they decreed against seclusion of a man with a single woman, to prevent occurrences like that of Amnon and Tamar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, the very incident of Amnon and Tamar involved Amnon being bedridden, even though he was faking it. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15873/jewish/Chapter-13.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Shmuel 13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֚אמֶר לוֹ֙ יְה֣וֹנָדָ֔ב שְׁכַ֥ב עַל־מִשְׁכָּבְךָ֖ וְהִתְחָ֑ל וּבָ֧א אָבִ֣יךָ לִרְאוֹתֶ֗ךָ וְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֵלָ֡יו תָּ֣בֹא נָא֩ תָמָ֨ר אֲחוֹתִ֜י וְתַבְרֵ֣נִי לֶ֗חֶם וְעָשְׂתָ֚ה לְעֵינַי֙ אֶת־הַבִּרְיָ֔ה לְמַ֙עַן֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶרְאֶ֔ה וְאָכַלְתִּ֖י מִיָּדָֽהּ:\nAnd Jonadab said to him: \"Lie down on your bed and feign sickness, and when your father comes to see you, say to him: \"Let my sister Tamar come now, and let her give me bread to eat, and prepare the food before my eyes, that I may see and eat from her hand.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To carve out exemptions from yichud restrictions for bedridden people would be counter-intuitive, as the decree wouldn't have prevented the very incident which prompted it.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/yichud-by-the-sick-or-old/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this source</a> which claims that it does apply for sick people, and how to navigate such circumstances.

In the end, his [Avraham’s] children\nwill prevail over them, and they will all fall into their hands. Then\nthey will return all their captives and their wealth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the Midrash links these four kings to the kingdom of Babylon, the kingdom of Media, the kingdom of Greece, and the kingdom of Edom, I am looking for other explanations on how especially this story about the four kings, the war, and Avraham Avinu are a reference to the future redemption. Are there meforshim, seforim etc.. that explain this narrative in light of the future redemption? For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.11?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the kings took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah, and then took Lot</a>. What does this teach us with regard to the future, e.g. the Messianic redemption?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the recently published sefer דבר שפר on בראשית, which consists of the Thursday night shiurim of the late Rabbi Moshe Shapero z\"l, on Parshas Lech Lecho, there is an enlightening essay on the subject.\nAnyone familiar with the shiurim of Rav Shapero zl knows that they can't really be condensed into a few sentences, but I'll attempt to supply here a short overview. Firstly, he points out, following the rule set out by the גר\"א and others, that since this is the first time that wars are mentioned in the Torah, it defines the whole Torah essence of wars in general. Wars, he says, are an expression of force and strength by kings and rulers and are an earthly expression of the Strength and Kingdom of הקב\"ה. Just as a מלך is only a king because he is accepted by the people (unlike a מושל who rules by force). We accept G’d as our King, by using our בחירה to do right and stay away from sin. אברהם אבינו did just that,and was the first one to do so. Lot, as the ancestor of Moshiach (through Moav, Ruth & David, and through Amon & Naamoh) signified the “final king” i.e. Moshiach. As such, G’d’s ultimate Kingdom in this world, was personified by אברהם (who accepted it) and לוט (who rebelled against it,but will eventually lead towards the world accepting G’d as The Only King). חז\"ל (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.37.14?lang=he&p2=Bereshit_Rabbah.42.1&lang2=he&w2=all&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בראשית רבה מב-א</a>) tell us, (based on the פסוק תהלים לז-יד which says that חֶרֶב  פָּתְחוּ רְשָׁעִים וְדָרְכוּ קַשְׁתָּם לְהַפִּיל עָנִי וְאֶבְיוֹן לִטְבוֹחַ יִשְׁרֵי־דָרֶךְ) the war of the 4 kings against the 5 kings was waged with the intention to destroy אברהם and לוט, i.e. it was a war against that very principle of G’d’s Kingdom being revealed. As such, they were the forerunners of the 4 kingdoms (note: they are all called with the prefix Malchus!) who exiled us and had the same intentions. As mentioned, this is just a very small bite of a beautiful many-layered cake and in no way does justice to words of the great Rabbi Shapero zl</p>\n\n\n",

In actuality, Hashem has made it possible for there to be a give and take between us and the Shechina, and we partner with Him (forge a relationship with Him) in building and blessing the world, and making it holy. There are indeed even deeper avenues to explore in how much we mean to Hashem, and how meaningful a heartfelt <em>bracha</em> is from a <em>pashute Yid</em> is to Him (infinitely). To fully justify that would take this question way beyond scope as essays would need to be written about esoteric and controversial issues (a good start might be <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3101998/jewish/Lessons-in-Derech-Mitzvosecha.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvotecha</a>).

The Holy Temple was a manifestation of sacred space on Earth), guarded by seraphim, which is a place of absolute purity and Holiness, the abode of G-d, blessed be He.</p>\n<p>However, the serpent is by nature a deceitful creature, using manipulative tricks to get Adam and Eve to eat the apple. This of course, is against G-d's eternal moral laws for He is the truth while the serpent tries to move people away from goodness, truth and righteousness.</p>\n<p>But if this is the case, then why did G-d, blessed be He, allow the serpent to exist in His sacred and holy space, in the first place? Its like He tolerated the existence of evil there when there shouldn't have been evil. Would this make Him partially responsible for the fall?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Tractate Makkot 24b tells a story that I think in a round about way is a possible answer for this.</p>\n<p>“Again it happened that Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria, Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Akiva went up to Jerusalem. When they reached Mt. Scopus, they tore their garments. When they reached the Temple Mount, they saw a fox emerging from the place of the Holy of Holies. The others started weeping; Rabbi Akiva laughed.</p>\n<p>Said they to him: \"Why are you laughing?\"</p>\n<p>Said he to them: \"Why are you weeping?\"</p>\n<p>Said they to him: \"A place [so holy] that it is said of it, 'the stranger that approaches it shall die,'1 and now foxes traverse it, and we shouldn't weep?\"</p>\n<p>Said he to them: \"That is why I laugh. For it is written, 'I shall have bear witness for Me faithful witnesses—Uriah the Priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.'2 Now what is the connection between Uriah and Zechariah? Uriah was [in the time of] the First Temple, and Zechariah was [in the time of] the Second Temple! But the Torah makes Zachariah's prophecy dependent upon Uriah's prophecy. With Uriah, it is written: 'Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field; [Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the Temple Mount like the high places of a forest.]'3 With Zachariah it is written, 'Old men and women shall yet sit in the streets of Jerusalem.'4</p>\n<p>\"As long as Uriah's prophecy had not been fulfilled, I feared that Zechariah's prophecy may not be fulfilled either. But now that Uriah's prophecy has been fulfilled, it is certain that Zechariah's prophecy will be fulfilled.\"</p>\n<p>With these words they replied to him: \"Akiva, you have consoled us! Akiva, you have consoled us!\"”</p>\n<p>Perhaps Adam and Chava’s sin was necessary to set off the chain of events that would lead to the entire rest of the Torah, and sometimes Hashem lets unholiness dwell in holy places to fulfill greater prophecies.</p>\n<p>I dunno, maybe that’s a bit heretical because obviously God gives people free choice and the rabbis said that had Adam held off eating the fruit, we would’ve all lived in Gan Eden forever.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, some commentators such as Sforno (see his commentary on Bereishis 3:1) understand the snake as being the evil inclination.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think you've got some ideas out of order. When the garden was originally created it had no guards. The guards only came into effect to keep humans out after they had eaten from the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. Presumably before mankind ate from the fruit, the animals came and left as they pleased.</p>\n<p>The serpent found in the garden is introduced as being the smartest/shrewdest animal either at that time in the whole world, or the smartest/shrewdest creature in the garden itself. We are not given anymore information about the serpent or its motives.</p>\n<p>Genesis 3:1-5</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts that God יהוה had made. It said to the woman, “Did God really say: You shall\nnot eat of any tree of the garden?”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>וְהַנָּחָשׁ֙ הָיָ֣ה עָר֔וּם מִכֹּל֙ חַיַּ֣ת הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה\nיְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֑ים וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־הָ֣אִשָּׁ֔ה אַ֚ף כִּֽי־אָמַ֣ר\nאֱלֹהִ֔ים לֹ֣א תֹֽאכְל֔וּ מִכֹּ֖ל עֵ֥ץ הַגָּֽן׃</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The woman replied to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the other trees of the garden.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>וַתֹּ֥אמֶר הָֽאִשָּׁ֖ה אֶל־הַנָּחָ֑שׁ מִפְּרִ֥י עֵֽץ־הַגָּ֖ן נֹאכֵֽל׃</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>It is only about fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said: ‘You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die.’”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>וּמִפְּרִ֣י הָעֵץ֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּתוֹךְ־הַגָּן֒ אָמַ֣ר אֱלֹהִ֗ים לֹ֤א\nתֹֽאכְלוּ֙ מִמֶּ֔נּוּ וְלֹ֥א תִגְּע֖וּ בּ֑וֹ פֶּן־תְּמֻתֽוּן׃</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>And the serpent said to the woman, “You are not going to die,</li>\n</ol>\n<p>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר הַנָּחָ֖שׁ אֶל־הָֽאִשָּׁ֑ה לֹֽא־מ֖וֹת תְּמֻתֽוּן׃</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>but God knows that as soon as you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like divine beings who know good and bad.”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>כִּ֚י יֹדֵ֣עַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים כִּ֗י בְּיוֹם֙ אֲכׇלְכֶ֣ם מִמֶּ֔נּוּ\nוְנִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵיכֶ֑ם וִהְיִיתֶם֙ כֵּֽאלֹהִ֔ים יֹדְעֵ֖י ט֥וֹב\nוָרָֽע׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, in the garden of Eden we are never introduced to God as a moral being. We are introduced to God as a creative being.</p>\n<p>This distinction is important because we don't know what the fruit does other than the serpent's claim that it will make humans like God. And in the end of the story we find out from God Himself that the serpent was correct from the beginning, the humans did become like God.</p>\n<p>Genesis 3:22</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"22\">\n<li>And God יהוה said, “Now that humankind has become like any of us, knowing good and bad, what if one should stretch out a hand and take\nalso from the tree of life and eat, and live forever!”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֗ים הֵ֤ן הָֽאָדָם֙ הָיָה֙ כְּאַחַ֣ד\nמִמֶּ֔נּוּ לָדַ֖עַת ט֣וֹב וָרָ֑ע וְעַתָּ֣ה ׀ פֶּן־יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗וֹ\nוְלָקַח֙ גַּ֚ם מֵעֵ֣ץ הַֽחַיִּ֔ים וְאָכַ֖ל וָחַ֥י לְעֹלָֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So when the serpent tells Eve she will be like God we need to understand what/who Eve thought God was, because it will help us understand what she might have thought eating the fruit would do.  If she believed God was a moral being, she might think that eating the fruit would allow her to be more moral. What would be wrong with that? Doesn't God want us to be more moral?</p>\n<p>But if she believe God was a creative being, then she might think that eating the fruit would allow her to create life. This makes the most sense to me because Eve's punishment for eating the fruit is that her childbirth would be painful, as if God is letting her keep the power of creation that the fruit gave her, but now will make it painful.</p>\n<p>And finally, it does not appear that the serpent lies about anything in its conversation with Eve. He tells her when she eats of it, she won't die but she'll become like God. And that's exactly how the story of the Garden of Eden ends in Genesis 3:22. But the question remains, how does the snake know what the fruit does? Many interpreters say the snake is a demon, or the satan, and therefore possibly has access to secret knowledge that it's using against the humans. But I think the narrative of these stories gives a much clearer interpretation: that the snake has already eaten the fruit, and therefore he knows what the fruit does and can tell it to Eve.</p>\n<p>Evidence for this can be found at the end of Genesis 2, Adam and Eve are \"<strong>עֲרוּמִּ֔ים</strong>\" (Arumim) naked, but not ashamed. Whereas the snake is \"הָיָ֣ה <strong>עָר֔וּם</strong> מִכֹּל֙ חַיַּ֣ת הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה\" the most naked/shrewd/subtle (Arum) of all the animals. The Bible clearly chose this word to tell you that the \"Arum\" of humans not having eaten the fruit is qualitatively different than the \"Arum\" of the serpent that has eaten the fruit.</p>\n<p>So I don't see any reason why the serpent would have been precluded from being in the garden. The Bible doesn't consider the serpent to be inherently evil. Instead the Bible seems to give the impression that the serpent has eaten from the fruit already, and the \"knowledge\" that comes from that turns someone from naked but not ashamed, into shrewd, crafty, and sensible. The snake also doesn't seem to tell any lies. And to me the story seems to imply that the rest of humanity might not be around if not for the snake since Eve might have needed to eat the fruit in order for her to have children. So perhaps that's why the snake was there—for the sake of the narrative.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Based on your assumption one can still start with a few answers.\n1 . Acc to zohar and pirkei drav eliezer really the samech mem was controlling the snake. So it was controlled by an angel, which presumably had a right to be there.\n2. According to the chizkuni the snake got its nature because it itself ate from the tree of knowledge. (And it wasn't punished for that, because it wasn't commanded not to eat from it).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Which Textual Sources Discuss Proto-Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Abraham lived before Sinai. He initiated the 2000 years of Torah (see Avoda Zara 9a). But per the  <em>Parshat Derachim</em>, the <em>Mizrachi</em> posits that Abraham adopted/ushered in a mode of Judaism that is different than today's. A type of Proto-Judaism. <em>Mizrachi</em>, Exodus 4:24:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואף על פי שאברהם אבינו קיים כל התורה כולה... הוה מצי להחמיר על עצמו לקיים גם המצות שאינן מכלל הז' מצות שנצטוו בהן בני נח אע\"פ שעדיין לא נצטוו בהן, אבל להתיר ... מי מצי להקל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Abraham adopted Jewish stringencies, but could NOT utilize Jewish-law leniencies. He was a 'Jew,' but not a Jew.</p>\n<p>The <em>Parshat Derachim</em> Drush 1 underscores this in the Mizrachi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. הֲרֵי מְבֹאָר מִדְּבָרָיו דִּסְבִירָא לֵהּ דְּמַה שֶּׁקִּיְּמוּ כָּל הַתּוֹרָה הוּא דַוְקָא לְהַחְמִיר עֲלֵיהֶם, אֲבָל לֹא לְהָקֵל מֵעֲלֵיהֶם מִמַּה שֶּׁחַיָּבִים בְּנֵי נֹחַ. אַלְמָא דִסְבִירָא לֵהּ דְּלֹא יָצְאוּ מִכְּלַל בְּנֵי נֹחַ לְהָקֵל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example - why was Abraham allowed to study Torah? A non-Jew may not (Sanhedrin 59a). This is a vital question - Abraham ushered in the 2000 years of Torah, and so he wasn't allowed to avail himself of the Jewish 'leniency' to study Torah <strong>if</strong> this was a disallowed practice for a gentile.</p>\n<p>Per the <em>Parshat Derachim</em> in Drush One, however, the Torah during this Proto-Judaic period could be studied by absolutely anybody. The prohibition that only a Jew study Torah did not congeal until Sinai.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גּוֹי שֶׁעָסַק בַּתּוֹרָה — חַיָּב מִיתָה, וְלֹא הֻתַּר לָהֶם לִלְמֹד אֶלָּא בְּשֶׁבַע מִצְו‍ֹת דִּידְהוּ, כִּדְאִיתָא בְּפֶרֶק אַרְבַּע מִיתוֹת (סנהדרין נט, א). מִשּׁוּם דְּמִידִי הוּא טַעְמָא אֶלָּא מִשּׁוּם דִּכְתִיב (דברים לג, ד): \"תּוֹרָה צִוָּה לָנוּ משֶׁה מוֹרָשָׁה\" — לָנוּ מוֹרָשָׁה וְלֹא לָהֶם, וְחַיָּבִים עָלֶיהָ מִשּׁוּם גָּזֵל. וְאִיכָּא מָאן דְּאָמַר מִשּׁוּם גִּלּוּי עֲרָיוֹת, וְאַל תִּקְרֵי 'מוֹרָשָׁה' אֶלָּא 'מְאֹרָשָׂה'. וְכָל הָנֵי טַעֲמֵי לָא שָׁיְכִי אֶלָּא מִסִּינַי וְאֵילָךְ שֶׁנִּתְּנָה תּוֹרָה, אֲבָל מִקַּמֵּי הָכֵי לָא שָׁיְכִי כְּלָל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus it emerges that Abraham the quasi-Jew initiated the period of Torah during a time when Torah could be studied by absolutely anyone. The forgoing is exciting in the sense that it speaks to the metamorphosis that the אלפיים תורה and Judaism experienced.</p>\n<p>Are there textual sources other than the <em>Parshat Derachim</em> that discuss proto-Judaism?</p>\n\n\n",

Please let me know if you have an answer using specific Halacha</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>No. Jewish lives are not worth more than anyone else's lives.</p>\n<p>\"According to Rabbi Yoḥanan quoting Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak there are only three mitzvot that are so severe that a person should give up his life rather than perform the forbidden acts. Those mitzvot are:</p>\n<pre><code>avoda zara (idol worship)\ngilui arayot (forbidden sexual relations)\nshefikhut damim (murder)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Gemara presents Biblical passages as the source for this rule regarding Avoda Zara and Gilui Arayot. When it comes to Shefikhut Damim the Gemara argues that no proof-text is necessary, as it is a sevara – a logical argument – that murder cannot be permitted to save a life. To illustrate the sevara, the Gemara tells of a person who approached Rabba with the following question:</p>\n<p>“The ruler of my village came to me and said ‘kill that person, and if you do not then I will kill you.’ Can I follow his order so that I will be able to save myself?”</p>\n<p>Rabba responded:</p>\n<p>“Allow yourself to be killed, but you may not kill another. Who says that your blood is redder than his? Perhaps his blood is redder than yours.”</p>\n<p>On a simple level, Rabba’s argument is that we cannot tell whose life is more valuable, so we will not allow you to save your life at the expense of another.</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Yehonatan explains Rabba’s answer by arguing that really the laws of the Torah are so important that we would not allow them to be “pushed aside” even at the expense of human life. The reason the halakha permits someone to transgress a serious prohibition – like Shabbat – in order to save a life is because we weigh that single ḥillul Shabbat (desecration of Shabbat) against the potential Shabbatot that the person will observe in the course of his lifetime. In our case the argument is that we cannot possibly know “whose blood is redder” i.e. who will live longer and perform more mitzvot.\"</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://steinsaltz.org/daf/sanhedrin74/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://steinsaltz.org/daf/sanhedrin74/</a></p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, many problems may arise from this situation, such as accepting this \"man\" for testimony, and men will be in yichud with \"him\" [...] Therefore, such a person should not be accepted for conversion, especially given that she does not regret her decision and will continue to transgress the prohibition of crossdressing even after her conversion. Accepting her for conversion may be understood as consenting to her actions.

Yosef Qafih</a> in his commentary writes without elaboration on 8:1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין זה סותר לעומק הדברים האמורים במו\"נ ח\"ב פ' לג</p>\n<p>And this does not contradict the depth of the matter as brought down\nin MN Sec. 2, Ch. 33.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Presumably this is intended in consonance with his statement in comment 13 on H. Yesode ha-Torah 8:3 (H/T @Nahum):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הדברים אמורים כאן על דרך ההטפה אבל ברור בדעת רבנו שכל אחד שמע כפי\nרמתו, וכמשפט כל חזון, ועיין מו”נ ח’ב סוף פ' לב, ופ’ לג, שם הביא לשון\nחז\"ל במכילתא שמות יט כט משה מחיצה בפני עצמה ואהרן מחיצה בפני עצמה.</p>\n<p>The matters discussed here are conveyed by means of sermonizing,\nhowever it is clear that according to Rabbenu that each one heard\naccording to his capacity, and each had a vision as adjudged. See MN\nSec 2, end of Ch. 32 and Ch. 33, where the language of Hazal from\nMekhiltah Ex. 19:29 is brought that Moses had is own partition and\nAaron had his own partition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Qafih explains that H. Yesode ha-Torah 8:1 utilizes an exaggerated sermonic style to communicate the idea, and accordingly it ought not be understood as contradicting MN 2:32-33 where the unique level of each individual dictated the quality of their respective prophetic experience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Sheilat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaac Sheilat</a> takes a similar tack and elaborates further (Haqdamoth haRambam leMishnah, pp. 70-71):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LOt1h.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LOt1h.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the above wording of the Mishneh Torah, characterizing the\nprophetic stature of the “presence” [of the Israelites at Sinai], it\ndiscusses seeing with the eye and hearing with the ear, and about\nMoses receiving the divine utterance: “Moses Moses, go tell them such\nand such” (H. Yesode ha-Torah 8:1). It seems that the Rambam employed\nthis language by means of \"hahaqal\" (i.e. with imprecision), akin to\nwhat he wrote in his introduction to his commentary on Heleq (end of\nparagraph 6): \" And don't try to come after me concerning that which\nI've said in a shallow unelaborated way about matters that men of\nwisdom grasp, for I have made the lesson easier so that those without\nany prior instruction in these exalted matters could understand.'' For\nin MN (Sec. 2, Ch. 33) the Rambam explains that the great voice that\nthe Israelites heard at Sinai - the words were undifferentiated. And\nin another place in the MN (Sec. 1, Ch. 46) he wrote: “You'll find\nthat the Hebrew language substitutes the apprehension made by one\nsense for that made by another... in conformity with this it is said,\n‘and all the people saw the sounds’ (Ex. 20:15) although this station\nalso constituted a vision of prophecy, as is well known and\nuniversally admitted in our community.” Which is to say: the language\nof “seeing the sounds” hints to an apprehension that is not\nsense-based, but rather is prophetic. And further (Sec. 2, Ch. 33):\n“The true reality of that apprehension and its modality are quite\nhidden from us, for nothing like it happened before and will not\nhappen after.” The fundament of the matter here is to emphasize the\nsense of certainty of the divine revelation that all Israel merited at\nMount Sinai, which establishes the belief in the prophecy of Moses\nwith absolute certainty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Sheilat here indicates that the language employed in H. Yesode ha-Torah 8:1 utilizes imprecise language in service of the overarching goal of conveying to the reader the weight of the Israelite experience, i.e. that trust in Mosaic prophecy was impressed upon them by the Sinaitic revelation. It is not intended to accurately describe the nuances of the prophetic experience which MN Sec. 2, Ch. 32-33 explain in greater detail.</p>\n<p>If I come across any other explanations I'll update.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do the laws of pidyon shvuyim apply as usual during a war or are they secondary to warfare considerations?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rambam states that there is no Mitzva as great as Pidyon Shvuyim. (משנה תורה, הלכות מתנות <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Gifts_to_the_Poor.8.10?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">עניים\nח׳</a>) He sets forth there that its greatness is based on the fact that the prisoner is in constant lack of basic necessities and is in constant danger of death. Yet, there are clear halachos regarding minimalizing distraction and fear in our troops during a war and forbidding certain people from fighting and certain actions from being taken (e.g see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.3?lang=he&with=Talmud&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 20</a>). Focus on and and active consideration for redeeming Jewish captives when battles need to be waged is an obvious distraction and can create hesitation and destroy morale of combatants, placing their lives in danger. Therefore, it would seem that normal consideration of precedence of Pidyon Shvuyim over other matters would not apply to decisions and considerations of warfare.</p>\n<p>Are there any explicit sources that state that the normal halachos of Pidyon Shvuyim do not apply at the same level during or are secondary to warfare considerations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The overriding consideration here is in the Mishnah: Captives are not redeemed for more than their value,  because of <em>Tikkun Olam</em> (repair of the world). [Gittin 4:6]  Their \"value\" used to be what they were worth in the slave market.  Today, the Mishnah means that one must consider the impact on society as a whole, whether in warfare or not.</p>\n\n\n",

However the process of getting an answer from the UT worked (see Yoma 73a-b) it seems clear that the information imparted was no better than information received by a true prophet of God. Furthermore, the historical timing wherein the UT functioned completely overlaps the epoch of prophecy.</p>\n<p>I would like to understand why the UT would ever have been consulted over a prophet, and if there is no qualitative reason to prefer consulting the UT over a prophet, for what reason did God establish two different systems for obtaining insight into God's will?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You can get a response from the urim vtumim without nevuah. Ruach hakodesh is sufficient. As @DoubleAA mentioned you can get a response whenever necessary vs nevuah if you're not Moshe rabeinu. That was part of it's purpose so that Israel wouldn't be left hanging when it needed timely divine instruction. Also, as @Deuteronomy mentioned, it's plan of action is immutable vs nevuah that can change. As it is necessary to act upon the info in the moment, if it is subject to change it wouldn't be all that valuable.

My only problem is that the baraisa adds \"sha'ah vesha'ah\", which means literally: \"hour and hour\", but it really means often. So it's saying that a man checks his pockets frequently so he gives up on it.</p>\n<p>If that's what it's saying, it doesnt make sense to say its yeush, because sha'ah vesha'ah seemingly implys that he knew about the money falling almost instantly. Why would that be relevant? Because it would have to be that he checked his pockets in a time where its not hopeless to trace your steps and get the money back. So that has to mean he's leaving it up to the public, hefker. He's not giving up hope on the object, he just doesn't see the need to get it back. This also comes back in the later proof of the bread which the reason why you can take the bread is because he knows instantly when it falls out, which the rabbis also say that you are able to take the bread because of mashmesh. So the bread is obviuosly hefker and not yeush even without taking mashmesh into consideration.</p>\n<p>So why is the gemara using yeush when it's really talking about hefker?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to Rashi in Bava Metzia 21 by  having Yiush ie despairing on a lost object makes it hefker - ownerless.</p>\n<p>מעות מפוזרות - הואיל ואין להם סימן ניכר איאושי מיאש <strong>והוו להו הפקר</strong> וזהו טעם כולם</p>\n<p>Although Rashi says the object is hefker, he does not mean that yiush is synonymous with hefker. Yiush\nand hefker are different. Hefker is when one willingly removes his ownership from an item. By declaring, or\nperhaps thinking it hefker, one is actively removing the item from his possession. This is true of something\nthat you would want to discard. But an aveida is something you want to keep, and it is unlikely that you would\nconsciously remove it from your ownership. Yiush is a passive feeling of hopelessness. The Torah says that if\nyou lose something and do not retain any hope of getting it back, you relinquish your ownership. Rashi means\nthat the result of yiush is hefker, that the item becomes ownerless, but the act of yiush is not making something\nhefker. (However, the Nesivos Hamishpat says that even the result of yiush is different than hefker. Hefker\nbecomes ownerless, whereas an aveida after yiush still belongs to the original owner until someone else picks\nit up.

That it is a Rabbi title is because he's from Israel,  not because he's a Tanna.</p>\n<p>That the one who lost it is checking his pockets is not hefker. This is something you are reading into it,  using some process of reasoning.  But Rabbi Yitzchak is expeditious explaining how there was yiush in the situation described in the brayta. Since people often touch their wallets,  the probability it that he realized before the finder found it. And since he doesn't know where he lost it, and they're are plenty of people who may pick it up before he located it,  and no siman, yes, he will abandon hope.  So it is yiush.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Short answer: Your making a wrong assumption that people know right away. Really they know very soon.</p>\n<p>Longer answer: It sounds to me like you are making an assumption based on a question and then asking a question based on your assumption.\nI agree with your first question but I would like to argue with your first assumption.\nI don’t think the Gemara at all means to say that because a person is <em>memashmesh bkiso bchol shaah</em> he knows right away and is mafkir his coin.\nI think the answer to your question is that a person knows <strong>very soon</strong> after he drops it not that he knows right away. Therefore when a person finds the coin he can <strong>assume</strong> that the loser already knows about it and was meyayesh. (It might be working using the concept of <em>rov</em>)\n(This might be the same answer as Josh Waxman)</p>\n\n\n",

And if yes 7 of what?</p>\n<p>Or is it possible it's from \"Sova\"- satiated, which is spelled the same way שבע?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Some shameless self-promotion: I wrote a blog post on this last year, which you can find <a href=\"https://tanachthoughts.blogspot.com/2023/01/a-possible-meaning-for-bat-shevas-name.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. The name Bat Sheva literally means \"daughter of seven\", although the root \"שבע\" is also related to vows. These are more classic understandings of the name.</p>\n<p>I suggest that there are a few aspects of Bat Sheva that show that her name was thematically related to the genealogy of the Tribe of Yehudah. First, we know from Tanach that she herself was from that tribe, because she was the daughter of Eliam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.11.3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shmuel 2:11:23</a>), who in turn was the son of Achitophel, who was from Giloh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.23.34?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shmuel 2:23:34</a>), in the territory of Yehudah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.15.51?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yehoshua 15:51</a>). By the way, this has led some to suggest that this was the reason Achitophel turned on David - because he was angry with what David did to his original grandson-in-law, Uriah.</p>\n<p>In terms of thematic connections, there is one instance in which Bat Sheva is spelled בת שוע (Bat Shua) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.3.5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chronicles 1:3:5</a>), which was also the name of Yehudah's first wife (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.38.12?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beresheet 38:12</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.2.3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chronicles 1:2:3</a>). She was called so because her father's name really was Shua (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.38.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beresheet 38:2</a>). That name means \"daughter of Salvation\".</p>\n<p>However, Bat Sheva is also thematically connected to Tamar, Yehudah's technical yevamah. According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.2.8?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishna Maaserot 2:8</a>, there was a type of fig called \"Bnot Sheva\". The fig is one of the seven species of Eretz Yisrael, as was the Tamar (date).</p>\n<p>In other words, the name Bat Sheva refers to a type of fig, and seems to also symbolize a connection with Tamar, mother of two branches of the Tribe of Yehudah, Peretz and Zerach. Bat Sheva's variant name, \"Bat Shua\", connects her to Bat Shua, the mother of the third branch, Shelah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Mier Mazuz explains in אסף המזכיר that it is referring to 7, as she was Dovid's 7th wife.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5hrEb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5hrEb.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Zohar Parshas Shemini 56 <a href=\"https://www.zohar.com/zohar/Shmini/chapters/5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a> learns that the \"Sheva\" is a reference to the seventh middah of Malchus, as she was destined \"from the creation of the world\" to marry King David, in the same way as Elisheva was destined from the creation of the world as the wife of Ahron, who as Kohen Gadol was also considered \"a king\".It seems that he learns that BatSheva was a גלגול of Elisheva, as he explains the difference between the two prefixes to the word Sheva and why it was changed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Qualified immunity in Halacha\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am curious about whether the concept of qualified immunity (for monetary liability) exists in Halacha. Qualified immunity in secular law generally means one who is a judge or police officer is generally not  liable to be sued due to them acting with discretion in their field. In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Horayot.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first Mishnah of Masechet Horayot</a> it is stated</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a court erroneously issued a ruling permitting the Jewish people to violate one of all the mitzvot that are stated in the Torah, and an individual proceeded and performed that transgression unwittingly on the basis of the court’s ruling, then whether the judges performed the transgression and he performed it with them, or whether the judges performed the transgression and he performed it after them, or whether the judges did not perform the transgression and he performed it alone, in all these cases the individual is exempt from bringing an offering. This is due to the fact that he associated his action with the ruling of the court. If the court issued a ruling and one of the judges knew that they erred, despite the fact that the majority ruled against his opinion, or if he was a student and he was qualified to issue halakhic rulings, and that judge or student proceeded and performed that transgression on the basis of its ruling, then whether the judges performed the transgression and he performed it with them, or whether the judges performed the transgression and he performed it after them, or whether the judges did not perform the transgression and he performed it alone, in all these cases, the judge or the student is liable to bring an offering. This is due to the fact that he did not associate his action with the ruling of the court. This is the principle: One who associates his action with himself is liable, and one who associates his action with the ruling of the court is exempt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is, if a Beit Din did an erroneous ruling which wrongly held someone liable to pay someone, fined them, wrongly convicted them (if they have that power) etc. due to factors like bad witnesses, circumstantial evidence, etc.  are they liable to be sued by the innocent party? Or is there a concept in Halacha equivalent to secular law’s qualified immunity they are exempt for discretion in judgement?</p>\n\n\n",

Does this mean that in order to conquer a specific area in Eretz Yisroel, you must first master that corresponding cheilek in Torah.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What is the exact location of the quoted explanation from Rav Pinchas Koritzer?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The exact location you're looking for is <em>Sha'ar HaTorah</em>, #10 in  Rav Pinchas Koritzer's <em>Imrei Pinchas</em>, which is very close to the Rabbi Wolfson book you quote. Here's the original:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשר יכה קרית ספר וגו' וילכדה עתניאל בן קנז וגו' (יהושע טו,טז). אמר בשם המגיד ממזריטש, דהנה בתורה נברא העולם (זח״א ה,א), וכל מקום יש לו חלק ושייכות בתורה, וכשרצו לכבוש ארץ ישראל עסקו באותה הלכה ששייך באותו מקום ועי\"ז כבשוהו. וזהו שכתוב גבי עי וילך יהושע בתוך העמק (יהושע ח,ט) ודרשו רז״ל (מגילה ג,ב) בעמק בעמקה של הלכה, דעסקו באותה הלכה ששייך לעי. והכא לא היו יכולין לכבשה, שזה היה שייך לאותן שלש מאות הלכות שנשתכחו באבלו של משה, עד שבא עתניאל בן קנז והחזיר בפלפולו אותן שלש מאות הלכות וכבשה (עיין תמורה טז,א). וזה קרית ספר, פירוש, עיר שצריך לכבשה על ידי ספר ולימוד. ואמר הוא ז\"ל אפשר שזה היה כוונת רבנים הקודמים כשנתמנו בעיר חדשה אמרו להם הלכה תוספות, כדי שיוכלו לכבוש העיר, ומן הסתם זו הלכה היתה שייכת לאותה העיר, כי הקדמונים וודאי כוונו לשם שמים</p>\n<p>\"And Caleb said: To he who smites Kiriath Sefer, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as a wife. And Othniel, son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it\" (Joshua 15:16-17). It was said in the name of the Maggid of Mezeritch: Behold, for the Torah was the world created (Zohar 1:5a), and every place has a part and belonging in the Torah. When they sought to conquer the Land of Israel, they dealt with the specific Halacha belonging to each specific place and in this way, they conquered it. As it is written regarding Ai and Joshua spending the night in the valley (Joshua 8:9-13), as our blessed sages expounded (Meg. 3b), \"this teaches that he spent the night in the depths [be’umeka] of halakha,\" dealing with the very halakha regarding Ai. And so they weren't able to conquer it, as it belonged to those three hundred laws that were forgotten after Moshe's death, until Othniel son of Kenaz came and brought back those three hundred halakhot with his argumentation and conquered it (see Temura 16a). And this is Kiriath Sefer, meaning, a city that requires conquering through book and study. And blessed R. Pinchas said: perhaps this was the intention of the early rabbis when they settled in a new city. They were told additional halakha, so that they could conquer the city. This halakha would belong specifically to that city, as the ancients' intentions were for the sake of heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chasidic teaching builds upon a baraita in Temurah 16a (with Steinsaltz commentary below):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>במתניתין תנא  אלף ושבע מאות קלין וחמורין וגזירות שוות ודקדוקי סופרים נשתכחו בימי אבלו של משה\nאמר רבי אבהו  אעפ\"כ החזירן עתניאל בן קנז מתוך פלפולו שנאמר  (יהושע טו, יז) וילכדה עתניאל בן קנז אחי כלב (הקטן ממנו) [ויתן לו את עכסה בתו לאשה]</p>\n<p><strong>It is taught in a baraita: One thousand and seven hundred a fortiori inferences, and verbal analogies, and minutiae of the scribes were forgotten during the days of mourning for Moses.</strong>\n<strong>Rabbi Abbahu says: Even so, Othniel, son of Kenaz, restored them through his sharp mind [pilpulo], as it is stated:</strong> “And Caleb said: To he who smites Kiriath Sefer, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as a wife. <strong>And Othniel, son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife” (Joshua 15:16–17)</strong>. The name “Kiriath Sefer,” which literally means the village of the book, is homiletically interpreted as a reference to those parts of the Torah that were forgotten, while the phrase “took it” is referring to Othniel’s acumen and learning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maggid takes this homiletic interpretation of the name of Kiryat Sefer further, saying that a city is conquered through book (<em>sefer</em>) and learning. And it is out of this that Rav Pinchas brings down the teaching of learning halachot related to a conquered city.</p>\n<p>I'm unfamiliar with the deeper kabbalistic literature about conquering land, but the Rav Pinchas teaching does cite a Zohar that makes some connection between the holiness of the earth and learning, saying that words of Torah rise up to become \"lands of the living\" before they come back down to form a new land:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל אינון שאר מלין דאורייתא דמתחדשין, קיימין קמי\nקב\"ה וסלקין ואתעבידו ארצות החיים ונחתין ומתעטרין לגבי ארץ חד ואתחדש ואתעביד כלא ארץ חדשה, מההיא מלה דאתחדש באורייתא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The bounty is still active, but I would like to point in a certain direction.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Wolfson quotes Rabbi Pinchas Koritzer in his sefer <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51149&st=&pgnum=11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Tzion V'areha\" (Hakdama, p. 9)</a>, which is a sefer that specifically talks about Eretz Yisroel. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אשר יכה קרית ספר וגו' עתניאל בן קנז וגו'\" (יהושע טו:טז). אמר בשם המגיד ממזריטש, דהנה בתורה נברא העולם, וכל מקום יש לו חלק ושייכות בתורה, וכשרצו לכבוש ארץ ישראל עסקו באותה הלכה ששייך באותו מקום ועי\"ז כבשוהו. וזש\"כ [גבי עי] \"וילן בעמק\" - בעמקו של הלכה, דעסקו באותה הלכה ששייך לעי. והכא [גבי קרית ספר] לא היו יכולין לכבשה, שזה היה שייך לאותן ש' הלכות שנשתכחו באבלו של משה, עד שבא עתניאל בן קנז והחזיר בפלפולו אותן ש' הלכות וכבשה. וזה \"קרית ספר\", פי' עיר שצריך לכבשה ע\"י ספר ולימוד. ואמר הוא נ\"י אפשר שזה היה כוונת רבנים הקודמים כשנתמנו אמרו להם הלכה תוס' כדי שיוכלו לכבוש העיר, ומן הסתם זו הלכה היתה שייכת לאותה העיר, כי הקדמונים ודאי כוונו לשם שמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He seems to be quoting the Imrei Pinchas, a sefer by Rav Pinchas Koritzer (seemingly).</p>\n<p>He says, and quotes the Magid of Mezeritch, that since the world was created by the Torah, every single place has a part in the Torah. When they wanted to conquer Eretz Yisroel, they needed to learn and master the halachos, the cheilek of Torah that city was associated with.</p>\n<p>But then again, where does this idea come from (was the Magid of Mezeritch the first, was it his idea?) and what does it mean in a clear language. Is it considered kabbalistic, or do we need to see it in the most plain meaning?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Should gentiles follow more than just seven Noahide laws?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know that gentiles must follow the 7 Noahide laws. But are there any other moral principles branching out from these that are highly recommended for <strong>everyone</strong> to follow?</p>\n<p>In totality, when completely expanded out from the seven laws: How many rules are acceptable for gentiles to follow, on the basis of morality and ethics? And what are these rules?</p>\n<p>Please provide a list, if possible.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Several words in your question need unpacking: <em>seven, must follow</em>, <em>moral principles</em>, <em>branch out</em> and <em>recommended.</em> I will try to do a bit for each one to help answer the question, but each one could really be a whole book.</p>\n<h2>Counting (to Seven?)</h2>\n<p>Even the number seven (and what that \"seven\" includes) is subject to a dispute in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 56). Thus one of the earliest talmudic commentators, R. Nissim b. Yaakov of Kairouan (or \"Rav Nissim Gaon\", 11th century), writes in the introduction to his <em>Sefer ha-Mafteach le-Man'ulei ha-Talmud</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצינו שאדם הראשון הטען מהם קצת מצוות כמו שאמרו רבותינו ז\"ל שבת מצוות נצטוו בני נח, דינים וברכת השם וע\"ז וגילוי עריות ושפיכות דמים וגזל ואבר מהחי, ואמרינן, מנהני מילי, אמר ר' יוחנן דאמר קרא \"ויצו ה' אלהים על האדם\"... וכבר הוסיף עליהן ר' חנניה בן גמליאל אף הדם מן החי… והיו מיתוספים והולכים עת אחר עת עד שעלה חשבון המצות של שמועה כ\"ח ויש שאמרו כי ל' מצות הן שנצטוו בהן קודם מתן תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We find that God \"loaded\" Adam with some commands, as our sages taught that the sons of Noah were commanded with seven commandments: laws, blasphemy, idolatry, illicit sexual relations, murder, theft, and eating tearing a limb, and we say [in the Gemara], how do we know this... and R. Chananyah b. Gamliel adds [the prohibition of eating] blood from a live animal... [and other sages add other commandments] and these continue to be added upon until the number of commandments \"of hearing\" [meaning, explicitly directed by God] amounts to <strong>twenty-eight</strong>, and some say <strong>thirty</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The number <strong>thirty</strong> is also mentioned in the Talmud, Hullin 92a (also in the Talmud Yerushalmi, Avodah Zarah 2:1). Rashi there says that he does not know what these are precisely, but in fact another very early commentator, R. Shmuel ben Hofni Gaon (Baghdad, c.950-1035) in his commentary to <em>Bereshit</em> 34:12, gives us a list of those thirty commandments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Idolatry</li>\n<li>Blasphemy</li>\n<li>Divine Unity (belief in a single God)</li>\n<li>Prayer</li>\n<li>Swearing\nfalsely</li>\n<li>Suicide</li>\n<li>Homicide</li>\n<li>Adultery</li>\n<li>Marriage (specifically, arranging a dowry)</li>\n<li>Sibling incest</li>\n<li>Sex with a\nman (for a man)</li>\n<li>Bestiality</li>\n<li>Castration</li>\n<li>Tearing an animal</li>\n<li>Eating the limb torn from a live animal</li>\n<li>Eating the blood taken from\na live animal</li>\n<li>Crossbreeding animals</li>\n<li>? [not legible]</li>\n<li>Sacrifices</li>\n<li>Stealing</li>\n<li>Honoring\nParents</li>\n<li>Giving one's sons or daughters \"to fire worship\"</li>\n<li>Sorcery\n(קוסם קסמים)</li>\n<li>Another kind of sorcery (מעונן)</li>\n<li>Another kind of sorcery\n(מנחש)</li>\n<li>Another kind of sorcery (מכשף)</li>\n<li>Another kind of\nsorcery/soothsaying (חובר חבר)</li>\n<li>Another kind of sorcery/soothsaying\n(שואל אוב)</li>\n<li>Another kind of sorcery/soothsaying (ידעוני)</li>\n<li>Another kind\nof sorcery/mediumship (דורש אל המתים)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A very similar list of 30 commandments is compiled by R. Azariah of Fano, in his book <em>Asarah Maamarot</em>, although he doesn't count prayer, sacrifices, and God's unity; instead he counts an obligation to procreate, a prohibition against crossbreeding plants, stirking a Jew, and the obligation to honor and study Torah without studying the parts of the Torah that are the exclusive heritage of the Jewish people.</p>\n<h2>Extent of the Obligation</h2>\n<p>Rabbinic sources clearly assume that whatever was commanded of Noah's descended are obligatory, even on pain of death. However, it is not clear if <em>all</em> of these commandments, especially beyond the seven primary commands, are obligatory to the same extent, or merely recommended, or something in between. Rambam, for example, mentions (<em>Hilkhot Melakhim</em> 10:8) that non-Jews are prohibited from crossbreeding animals, but not punished by a Jewish court for violating this command.</p>\n<h2>Morality and \"Mitzvot\"</h2>\n<p>The most complicated aspect of your question is the relationship between the seven/thirty commandments and what might be obligatory \"on the basis of morality and ethics\". The earliest rabbinic commentators believed that the seven/thirty commandments are <em>independent</em> from reasonable ethics. In other words, moral laws have a self-evident binding force all on their own, even if God had not said anything about them. This is pointed out by the commentators on the earliest stories of the Torah: Kayin is held morally responsible for murdering his brother, the wicked in the time of Noah were guilty for their sins, etc. Thus, R. Saadiah Gaon (10th century) writes (commentary to <em>Bereshit</em> 4:3) that he is unsure precisely how many commandments the earlier pre-Sinai generations received from God, but they must have gotten some instruction from Him, because otherwise Kayin and Hevel would not have thought up the idea of sacrifices on their own (since nobody today would consider animal sacrifices to God as self-evidently moral). R. Nissim is even more explicit about this in the source I quoted above, where he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל המצוות שהן תלויות בסברא ובאובנתא דליבא כבר הכל מתחייבים בהם מיום אשר ברא אלוקים אדם על הארץ עליו ועל זרעו אחריו לדורי דורים והמצות שהן נודעות מדרך השמועה מדברי הנביאים לא חשך אלהינו מלחייב לקדמונים מה שהיה ראוי בעין חכמתו לחייב לקדמונים מה שיה ראוי בעין חכמתו לחייבם. ...  אינן כולן של שמועה כי חיוב ידיעת מציאות הקב\"ה ולשמוע בקולו ולעבדו מדין הדעת הן ראויין, ושפיכות דם נקי והגזל מדרך השכל הן אסורין, ולא נצטרפו מצות השמועה שניתנו לאחר מיכן אלא עם אותן שהן של שמועה כיוצא בהן</p>\n<p>All \"commandments\" which are dependent upon reason and human understanding are incumbent upon everyone, from the day that God created man on Earth, upon him and upon his progeny after him for all generations. And the commands which are known through 'communication' from the words of the prophet are not withheld by God from being obligatory upon the ancients whatever was deemed fit by His Wisdom to obligate them... although not all of them are 'of communication' [that would be unreasonable if not directed by God], for the obligation to know of God's existence, heeding His voice, and serving Him are all fit [to be obligatory] by force of intellect, and the murder of innocents or theft are prohibited by way of reason</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, yes it is true that some of these commandments overlap with what human reasoning might come up with as morally obligatory, but some cannot be identified with human reasoning and must have been commanded by God directly (as R. Saadiah Gaon stated), and so at the end of the day, all of these listed obligations are sourced in God's explicit command. Likewise, Rambam introduces the seven laws of Noah by saying אף על פי שכולן קבלה הן בידינו ממשה רבינו, והדעת נוטה להן, מכלל דברי התורה ייראה שעל אלו נצטוו - although these are all received traditions from Moshe, and the mind is inclined towards them, from the general words of the Torah it can be seen that these were commanded [and not <em>derived</em> from human reason].</p>\n<p>There is another school of thought which does appear to identify the \"seven laws\" with a morality that could have been derived by human reason. Such an idea might be found in \"<em>Midrash Lekah Tov</em>\" by R. Toviah b. Eliezer (11-12th century, Salonica) in his commentary to <em>Bereshit 2:15</em> who attempts to prove that reference is made to all these laws (although it is not clear to me if he believes that Adam was, in fact, commanded about them specifically or expected to have reasoned his way to them):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי כל אלה הן מצות הדעת שאפילו לא נתנה תורה לישראל נוהגין היו בהן הדורות לשמרן בדעתן וכן הוא אומר באברהם כי ידעתיו למען אשר יצוה את בניו ואת ביתו אחריו ושמרו דרך ה' לעשות צדקה ומשפט כי אנשי דור המבול מפני החמס נתחתם עליהם גזר דין שלא היו נוהגין על המשפטים. ברכת השם עברו דור הפלגה ולקו שנאמר ונעשה לנו שם שכפרו בעיקר. על זה היה זריז בו איוב שנאמר אם אראה אור כי יהל וירח יקר הולך ויפת בסתר לבי ותשק ידי לפי גם הוא עון פלילי כי כחשתי לאל ממעל' שלא עבד לא לשמש ולא לירח מכלל שהיו אחרים עובדים שפיכת דמים נענש בו קין גלוי עריות נענש בו אבימלך דכתיב השב אשת האיש ואומר ואיך אעשה הרעה הגדולה הזאת וחטאתי לאלהים גזל הוא החמס אבר מן החי שנאמר אך בשר בנפשו דמו לא תאכלו וכל אלה שהוזכרנו עונשן לא ענש אלא אם כן הזהיר למדנו כי נצטווה אדם הראשון בכל אלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More explicitly, Ramban (13th century) writes (<em>Torat Hashem Temimah</em>, p. 173 in <em>Kitvei ha-Ramban</em>, ed. Chavel)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על דרך הפשט אלו מצות שכליות הן וכל נברא מכיר את בוראו צריך להזהר מהן\nAccording to the straightforward understanding [as opposed to the more interpretative reading of the Sages] these are 'reasonable commandments,' and all creatures who recognize their Creator must be careful about them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is much more to discuss here and many more sources to bring, but we have other things to clarify.</p>\n<h2>Moral Obligations</h2>\n<p>Regardless of whether you view the 'seven commands of Noah' as being fully identifiable with moral reasoning, or as being obligatory only because of God's explicit command, or something in-between, nearly all the Jewish thinkers agree that every person, whether Jew or non-Jew, is <em>also</em> obligated to behave ethically, even if such behavior does not fit exactly into any of the stated \"commandments\". Almost nothing is Jewish thought can really be said to be <em>universally</em> accepted, with no dissenters, but my impression is that this is the position of the overwhelming majority of Jewish thinkers. Just to quote Rambam (<em>Dalalat al-hairin/Moreh Nevukhim</em>, 3:17):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God must always be considered just, in that He rewards the righteous on all his deeds from his acts of kindness and rightness even though he was not commanded as such by a prophet, and He punishes all evil acts that a person does even though he was not warned as such by a prophet, for he is warned as such by way of nature, meaning to say, the warning against oppression and injustice</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[it happens to be that this quote is in the context of Rambam quoting an opinion he disagrees with somewhat, but he clearly does agree with this aspect].</p>\n<h2>Roots and Branches</h2>\n<p>We have thus far considered two sources of obligations for all of humanity: explicit commands (numbering either seven, thirty, or something in between), and moral reasoning. However, there is another possible source of obligation which you've alluded to in your question: derivations from those original divinely instructed commands. There are many rabbinic sources attesting to the fact that each of the seven laws (if that is indeed the right number) actually include what in the Jewish code list of 613 are numbered as several commands.</p>\n<p>For example, \"illicit sexual relations\" is counted once in the seven listed by the Talmud in Sanhedrin and by Rambam, but it is clear that this actually includes several prohibitions: male same-sex relations, sibling incest, adultery, bestiality, etc. as Rambam details (in <em>Hilkhot Melakhim</em> 9:4). Instead of listing them out, I would recommend reading that chapter in Rambam's <em>Hilkhot Melakhim,</em> which is readily available online. Another medieval source which takes this view and even adds to Rambam's list is the <em>Sefer ha-Chinuch</em> (possibly written by R. Pinhas haLevi of Lunel, 13th century). He adds the following (parenthesis refer to the mitzvah number, out of 613, where he writes this):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(416) \"do not covet\" as a sub-prohibition of theft</li>\n<li>(417) belief in God</li>\n<li>(417) belief in the Oneness of God</li>\n<li>(417) not believing in multiple Gods, are all derivatives of the prohibition against idolatry</li>\n<li>(430), this is not explicit, but he indicates that possibly all people should be thanking God in the way that Jews must bless Him after a meal (but really this is probably a recommendation, see next section)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition to these medieval writers, some modern books have been written in the past few decades that are centered around this idea and provide more details on the derivations of these seven laws. One such book is \"The Seven Laws of Noah\" by Aaron Lichtenstein (not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Lichtenstein\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this man</a>, another Aaron Lichtenstein)</p>\n<h2>Requirements and Recommendations</h2>\n<p>Everything discussed so far has assumed that the non-Jew is <em>obligated</em> in these listed commands. However, one could argue that the Torah's guidelines for the lives of Jewish people hints to the fact that other actions and behaviors might be valuable even for those who are not commanded to do so. In other words, if you assume (as many traditional Jewish thinkers do), that the Torah's laws provide blessings and are a guide to the good life in this world and/or the afterlife, then it stands to reason that a non-Jew who wants a share in those blessings would be encouraged to try following the same rules. This answer has already gotten too long, but basically, there are lots of different opinions here, and it depends on how you view the Torah's commands more generally. I have already mentioned Rambam several times, and so I'll point out that his opinion appears to be that a non-Jew can indeed pick up any mitzvah for his own spiritual growth, as long as he is doing so with the intent of following God's Torah, and not doing so in order to invent a new religion (this is clear from his commentary to the Mishnah <em>Terumot</em> 3:9, and a letter (no. 60) on the topic. However, one of the greatest halakhic authorities of the 20th century, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, refused to believe that Rambam held such a view, and stated emphatically that there is no value whatsoever in a non-Jew's performance of ritual commands (<em>Iggerot Moshe Y.D.</em> 2:6)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Mishna Berurah (Biur Halachah 304) writes that a <em>ger toshav</em> can obligate himself in any of the 613 mitzvos, except for kashrus. According to this position, if a gentile upon his decision to become a <em>ger toshav</em> would choose to add to the required 7 Noahide Obligations, they would become obligatory for him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אחר כתבי כ\"ז התבוננתי שאפשר לקיים דבריו דס\"ל להמגן אברהם ג\"כ דאינו בר\nישראל כלל ובכלל גר תושב הוא והכל כאשר כתבנו אלא דס\"ל <strong>דגר תושב גופא אם\nרצה לקבל עליו בעת תחלת גירותו עוד מצות מלבד השבע ג\"כ חלה קבלתו שמחוייב\nאח\"כ לקיים</strong> אלא דמה דנקטו שבע רבותא אשמועינן דאף ששבע מצות מחוייב לקיים\nכל בן נח ומאי רבותייהו אפ\"ה חלה הקבלה ובכלל גר תושב הוא לענין שמצווין\nלהחיותו וכ\"ש אם קבל עליו יתר מצות בודאי מהני ולא תקשה ע\"ז דאיך ישמור\nשבת והלא גר תושב ג\"כ אסור לשמור שבת כדמוכח ביבמות מ\"ח ע\"ב בתוד\"ה זה גר\nוכו' דזהו בסתם גר תושב שלא קבל עליו רק שבע מצות כנהוג וא\"כ הוא לענין\nשאר מצות כא\"י גמור משא\"כ כשקבל עליו עוד מצות בתחלת גירותו ובכללם היה\nג\"כ שבת בודאי יכול לקיימם ומחוייב לקיימם ומה דאיתא בבכורות דא\"י שרצה\nלקבל כל התורה חוץ מד\"א אין מקבלין אותו היינו לענין לעשותו ישראל גמור\nאבל לא לענין גר תושב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Besides the 7 mitzvos of noach. Many other obligations they have seem to be in dispute. Rabeinu nissim in hakdama wrote that goyim are obligated to keep mitzvos sichlios (logical commands). The chizkuni noach 7:21 says the same thing.</p>\n<p>(Even though many of the 7 mitzvos are also logical to keep, the reason why the 7 mitzvos are different is because they're obligated to death by beis din for violating them)</p>\n<p>Yechezkel 16:49 implies that Sedom got punished for not giving tzedeka. Indeed the Ran (Sanhedrin 56b ויצו) writes non jews are commanded to give tzedaka. However Rav Elchanan Wasserman (kovetz parshios וירא)deduces from the Rambam that they have no such obligation, since the Rambam doesn't mention it. Rav Elchanan himself gives a few suggestions why sdom was punished for not giving tzedaka. First, he says according to Rav Chaim Vital that the Torah doesn't have explicit commands on midos is because it's a fundamental to have to keep the Torah. He says therefore non jews as well are obligated to have good middos, because if not they wouldn't be able to keep their 7 laws. Therefore Sdom got punished for being cruel and not giving tzedaka. (This seems to be similar to those that hold goyim are obligated in logical mitzvos)\nHe also suggests that even though sdom wasn't obligated to give tzedaka, but if they did the merit would've protected them from being punished.\nSome (Rav Nechemia Kaplan shlita) bring a proof that non jews are obligated in logical mitzvos from bireishis rabba p.36:7 that says hashem exempted Avraham from the mitzva of cibud av. Why would he need an exemption if he wasn't obligated to keep the Torah? Must be since its a logical mitzva.\nHowever the gemara in kiddushin 31a brings a story with a non jew who gave up lots of money to honor his father and got rewarded. The gemara was showing how much reward a person whose not commanded in something gets. Yet if non jews are obligated in logical mitzvos how come the gemara says he wasn't commanded?\nAvnei Nezer on nazir suggests that since mitzvos sichlios aren't explicit in the torah one gets less reward for it like one whose not commanded. Rav nechemia Kaplan suggested that specifically in that case it wasn't logical to give up so much money for honoring his father. (Also perhaps you can suggest according to gemara baba kama 38a that non jews lost the reward on mitzvos as if they were commanded. They only get reward as if they're not commanded)</p>\n<p>Reb Moshe (Igros YD 2:7) seems to argue and hold they're not obligated to do logical commands but if they do them they get reward.\nHowever if they keep 613 mitzvos which aren't logical to keep they get no reward for them at all.\nThe Brisker Rov (likutei hagrach siman 56) also holds non jews don't get reward for keeping 613 mitzvos.\nHowever Rav Berel Povarsky (Bad Kodesh sukkos) holds non jews do get reward for keeping 613 mitzvos (except for sukka, as he explains there). Part of the dispute is how to learn up the Rambam 10 melachim 9-10. The radvaz on the Rambam learns that non jews do get reward for keeping mitzvos howevet they shouldn't do mitzvos that have holiness connected to them such as teffilin. ( Im not sure if he's saying they get no reward for it, or they shouldn't do it for other reasons) Rav Shlomo Zalman Aurbach ztl (SA 17 Dirshu Mb) seems to hold goyim get rewarded as well. Since he says a goy that puts on tzitzis gets reward, however he cant make a blessing on it, since he's not obligated.</p>\n<p>The Rambam (10 melachim 6) poskins non jews cant interbreed animals and trees (in certain ways), however hes not killed if he does so.\nYou should just see the rambam melachim perek 10 to see a bigger description of what non jews can or cant do, which is more than 7 mitzvos.\nA non jew that studies Torah is obligated to death, but not killed.(Rambam 10 melachim 9) However if he studies the 7 mitzvos he's as great as a cohen gadol (Baba Kama 38a).\nThe last Drisha 48 brings from his master that  just like women are obligated to learn their laws and should make a birkas hatorah, so too non jews are obligated to learn their laws and make a birkas HaTorah.</p>\n<p>The shieltos by mitzvas pru urvu holds non jews are obligated in the mitzva of pru urvu. However Tosafos Yevamos 62a says based off the gemara sanhedrin 59b that non jews aren't obligated in pru urvu. (The mefarshim on sheiltos try to answer up that gemara)</p>\n<p>If a non jew accepts 7 mitzvos and becomes a ger toshav, there's a duspute amongst the reishonim if hes obligated to keep shabbos.</p>\n<p>The answer is yes, there are more the 7 mitzvos and recommendations for non jews to keep. Although many things are disputed. However making a full list will take a very long time.</p>\n\n\n",

And we went to pray mincha at the shul that he had there, and I went with them, and I was called up to the Sefer Torah, and after that we ate at his home.<br />\nAnd the rebbetzin, his second wife, and her daughter-in-law, wife of Rabbi Leib, may Hashem guard and protect him, were at the table. And there were some learned men there, as well as Rabbi Leib Hirsch, and I said Birkat Hamazon, and the aforementioned rabbi delayed me. And after Arvit we came to his house and we found there a set table. And upon it a tower of some two cubits high in the shape of the royal court, and Mordechai sitting by the gate of the palace wearing Persian garb, and a canopy and a tower and in it Esther upon a bed and Achashverosh and Haman falling. And outside of the tower from the other end a street and Haman hung. And the building was surrounded by warriors. And so many beautiful shapes in various shades. And all of this was masterfully made from sugar alone. And this craftsmanship was worth about 20 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequin_(coin)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sequins</a>.<sup>1</sup> And it seems that this was a gift that some important people sent to the rabbi. And the table was packed with wonderful dishes, [fresh?] fruit<sup>2</sup> and cheese and upon it was written 'kosher' and 'Pesach' and models of pickled zucchini,<sup>3</sup> all made from sugar...and some musicians came and among them stood one of the riffraff and acted out a drasha and sang out things in Hebrew (Lashon Hakodesh) in dirty verse. And after some hours the rabbi went with us upstairs and we dined there a great feast. But I was careful for I wasn't able to eat at all, and barely ate a bit of bread and chicken...and after Birkat Hamazon we came down and various, other, quality musicians came. And the rabbi sent and brought Saliah (?)<sup>4</sup> and we returned home close to midnight. And we found there many men and women with instruments and among them a masked troupe dancing and making merriment and then others with dumb masks and Turkic masks<sup>5</sup> came, and of different types. And I immediately rose and went to bed and I had gut<sup>5</sup> pains, that though I had been careful, I was still pained somewhat and I slept after midnight for a long time. And during the day I was pained by my gut and this continued some days with me feeling unwell.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37534&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 16b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ליל א' מס' פקודי מוש\"ק כל הלילה היו עושין ברחובות שמחה ופרצופין ושטויות בשביל פורים כאלו העיר שלהם בפרסום גדול ברחובות קריה. ורובם אשכנזים שיש באמשטרדם יותר מן' אלף נפשות מאשכנזים. והעיר חירות והם לוקחים החירות יותר מדאי כאלו הם המושלים ומלכי ארץ דבר פלא.\"</p>\n<p>Sunday evening of Parshat Pekudei (=the night before Sunday morning), Motzei Shabbat Kodesh, all night there were people merry-making and wearing masks and doing nonsensical things in the streets in celebration of Purim as though the city was theirs, in great advertisement in the streets of the city. And most of them were Ashkenazim, as there are in Amsterdam more than 1000 (or perhaps, but less likely, 50,000)<sup>7</sup> Ashkenazim. And the city was free and they took this freedom one step too far and acted as though they were the rulers and kings of the land, and this was astonishing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> The Hebrew is סיקיני or סיקינו and clearly refers to a large form of currency. The Dutch currency wasn't the sequin, but it seems likely that the Chida would have referred to a better-known coin either because he himself was more familiar with that coinage, or because he expected his potential readership to be more familiar with that. The Chida spent a considerable amount of time in Italy, so the sequin, also called a zecchino, a costly gold coin, seems to be the most plausible candidate.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> The Hebrew is פירות כבריתן = fruit as they were created? Meaning unclear.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> The Hebrew is קישוא, which in modern Hebrew is zucchini, but I have no idea to what vegetable the Chida was referring to.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> Not sure what סאליאה is.</p>\n<p><sup>5</sup> In context it seems that פרצופין refers to masks. What comes to mind are European festival masks (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Venice#Carnival_masks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Carnival</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_Fools\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Festival of Fools</a> for example). חיגר refers to a dumb person, so perhaps a better translation is a fool's mask or something of the sort. I am not certain about the meaning of the word תורקוס, but I think it might come from Turkic, i.e., an eastern, \"exotic\" type mask, or maybe a Venetian Turkish nose mask (<a href=\"https://www.lartedellamaschera.com/en/product/turkish-nose-venice/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for example</a>).</p>\n<p><sup>6</sup> אצטומכא appears in many Jewish sources, typically with regards to the digestive system, and from what I can tell, refers to the קיבה, or gut.</p>\n<p><sup>7</sup> I was unsure whether the מן' with an apostrophe over the Nun was supposed to mean 50, which would mean 50,000, or simply מן, \"of\", so just 1000. But 50,000 Jews sounds like an exorbitant number.</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, when we are concerned about our own needs, we are definitionally not happy, but rather we are anxious, stressed and depressed. After many years of taking this approach, and filling in the void of happiness with yeitzer haras like food and cheap thrills, we eventually start to question what is the point.</p>\n<p>Why were we created? So that we should be given needs and problems to worry about? We meant to spend our whole life pursuing our needs, under huge effort for little reward? The younger people realise that this isn't the way, the better.</p>\n<p>Happiness comes when we realise that we didn't create ourselves, or our needs. Someone else created us, and He asks us to do something <em>for Him</em>. What a relief! Now we know our purpose, which is the first pre-requisite to finding happiness! Secondly, we have won the lottery! We have an opportunity to serve Hashem! Whatever He needs, we will do, and that's where we will find true, lasting <em>simcha</em>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully we can learn this before we discover it through life experience, such as having a spouse and children to serve. Many people discover the joy of service at that point in their lives, and often it is quite too late - a lot of damage done. <em>Hatzlacha</em>!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>All of this is based on Rabbi Manis Friedman's lectures on this huge topic, so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiJ2-AAp8-s&list=PL1R4vEmVBZSy-HdLNscieecKluKUiy4Dy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here is a playlist</a> if you'd like to hear more.

    "content": "# The Pre-Planned Rodef - How Far Does it Go?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud in Avoda Zara 10b states:</p>\n<p>ה\"ל ההיא נקרתא דהוה עיילא מביתיה לבית רבי כל יומא הוה מייתי תרי עבדי חד קטליה אבבא דבי רבי וחד קטליה אבבא דביתיה א\"ל בעידנא דאתינא לא נשכח גבר קמך</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara relates an anecdote involving Antoninus. Antoninus had a certain underground cave from which there was a tunnel that went from his house to the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. Every day he would bring two servants to serve him. He would kill one at the entrance of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and would kill the other one at the entrance of his house, so that no living person would know that he had visited Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. He said to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: When I come to visit, let no man be found before you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Antoninus thus wished to study Torah daily with Rebbe and keep the rendezvous top secret.</p>\n<p>Tosofot asks why these murders were permitted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חד קטיל אבבא דבי רבי -  וא\"ת והלא שפיכות דמים הוא משבע מצות ואפילו לישראל אסור דהא תניא (לקמן עבודה זרה כו.) העובדי כוכבים ורועי בהמה דקה לא היו מעלין ולא מורידין וי\"ל שהיה ירא פן יודיעו הדבר אל השרים והיו גורמין להרגו ואמרינן אם בא להרגך השכם להרגו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He would kill one at the entrance of the house of Rabbi: And if you will say (ask): And is not the spilling of blood (murder) one of the seven [universal] commandments? And it is even forbidden to a Jew, for behold it was taught (below, Avodah Zarah 26a), \"Idolaters and shepherds of small domesticated animals - we do not raise them [out of a pit], but we don't lower them [into it].\" It can be said (answered) that he was afraid lest they would make the thing known to the ministers and they would cause him to be killed; and we say if someone comes to kill you, arise early to kill him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's rich. Apparently Antoninus was the victim, and the servants were the would-be murderers!</p>\n<p>There is something  unsavory about this whole logic - he 'couldn't' be without his attendants, and he felt 'compelled' perhaps to study Torah through a secret tunnel and thus was left with 'no choice' but to murder a new pair of servants daily rather than be indirectly murdered by them - sounds like an extreme take on אם בא להרגך השכם להרגו</p>\n<p>In the end, Antoninus preplanned and gave rise to his own Rodef scenario! This worked-out-in-advance Rodef dynamic doesn't seem to change the halachik Rodef calculus per Tosofot. How far does this go?</p>\n<p>Can a person regularly go to a synagogue in a very dangerous part of town with a high per capita rate of violent crime, encounter a 'Rodef', and then avail his- or her- self of Rodef logic? Arguably, Antoninus' situation was much safer because he was able to control the risk through careful planning.</p>\n<p>The most ironic aspect of this, which may play a huge factor and make Antoninus' case sui generis, is that in a sense there was no danger to Antoninus at all once he put his plan into motion. The danger to life was more or less gone.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think you might have misunderstood the Tosfos' point, that comes after where you cut the quote.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חד קטיל אבבא דבי רבי - וא\"ת והלא שפיכות דמים הוא משבע מצות ואפילו לישראל אסור דהא תניא העובדי כוכבים ורועי בהמה דקה לא היו מעלין ולא מורידין וי\"ל שהיה ירא פן יודיעו הדבר אל השרים והיו גורמין להרגו ואמרינן אם בא להרגך השכם להרגו <strong>עי\"ל שהיה בורר המינים והמסורות דאע\"ג דאין מינים באומות לענין קבלת קרבן מידם לענין הורדה איכא כדפריך בפ\"ק דחולין השתא דישראל היו מורידין דעובדי כוכבים מיבעיא</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my own translation of the bolded part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also you have to be medakdek that he would select minim and mosrim, because even though there aren't minim by the goyim in regard to accepting korbanos from them, when it comes to horada there are, as in the pircha in Chullin \"<em>now that you say that we are morid a Jewish [min], do you even have to say [that we are morid] a non-Jewish [min]?</em>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, he would select two slaves that are non-Jewish minim, by whom we say \"moridim velo maalin\", meaning that we lower them into a pit (so that they will die) and do not raise them. This concept is what Tosfos calls horada (lowering). And although the Gemara in Chullin (see daf 13b) learns out that we do not exclude non-Jewish minim from bringing korbanos (unlike Jewish minim, who we do exclude from bringing), we do hold that there is such a concept as a non-Jewish min in regard to horada.</p>\n<p>And although horada doesn't give Antoninus a right to kill these two non-Jewish <em>min</em> slaves outright, I would argue that the Tosfos views the deliberate putting of the slaves in a rodef-style situation is akin to the indirect killing otherwise achieved by lowering them into a pit that they can't get out of.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Antoninus was allowed to kill these two non-Jewish <em>min</em> slaves.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>After giving it some thought ... the Yerushalmi Megilah 3:2 posits that it is possible to say that Antoninus converted.</p>\n<p>Thus, notwithstanding the mortal danger, per his destiny, Antoninus <strong>had to</strong> study Torah and embrace Judaism (this was not an optional activity). We can say that per Tosofot the daily servants that attended Antoninus were must-have <em>lookouts</em>. It was of paramount importance that no one new learn of his secret and that no one live to tell the tale - Antonius reasonably felt that he would be executed by the Romans if his secret got out. Moreover, he could not make his servant(s) swear to never reveal his secret ... who can trust that?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Shabbat pedestrian crossing, and Marit Ayin",
    "content": "# Shabbat pedestrian crossing, and Marit Ayin\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my town, the local (non-Jewish) council, in a gesture to the Jewish community, set certain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat_pedestrian_crossing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">traffic light crossings to automatically go green</a> (Walk) for pedestrians every 30 seconds or so. This is activated for Shabbat and Yom Tov.</p>\n<p>Is there any discussion about whether this might be a Marit Ayin? If non-Torah observant drivers see a traffic light go red, and then notice that the pedestrian light goes green, they will very likely assume that the person waiting pressed the button for this to happen.</p>\n<p>However, they also might not. There are circumstances where cross-junctions go green for pedestrians on one of the crossings at a time, when it is the right time to do so (i.e. when the lights are arranged such that no cars are supposed to drive that way anyway), and <em>occasionally</em>, they will just do this automatically on a cycle even with nobody pressing it.</p>\n<p>Drivers might not be aware of these complex rules though, but they also might just not think about it.</p>\n<p>Is anyone aware of any discussion on this, regaring Marit Ayin specifically?</p>\n<p>Either way, <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/green-light-for-kosher-crossings/news-story/4382fbabcabde0b44e31b52ce59ff960\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">things could be worse</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This was a difficult and great question!</p>\n<p>Just to put it out there, in no way am I paskeining anything here, this is just out of מקורות וסברות.</p>\n<p>The way I would like approach this question is by analyzing when one can be lenient in cases of Marit Ayin, and based on that apply it to this case. So let's begin.</p>\n<p><strong>Leniency 1:</strong> <strong>We usually don't apply Marit Ayin to derabbanan's (gzeira legzeira):</strong> In Yechaveh Daat 3:59 he uses the Rema in Yoreah Deah 87:3 with regards to cases that we don't apply Marit Ayin when dealing with one derabbanan already. For example drinking parve milk with chicken would be allowed. Pesach flour during pesach even though it looks like wheat flour, and there are many more like this. So with regards to this question if you hold like many poskim (look <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Electricity_on_Shabbat#cite_ref-4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://:https://www.sefaria.org/Gray_Matter_IV%2C_Technology%2C_The_Prohibition_of_Turning_On_Electric_Lights_on_Shabbat_and_Yom_Tov.40?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) that electricity on shabbat is derabbanan, then using the crosswalk would be okay since two derabbanan’s are at play here.<br />\nLook <a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=29679\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for the sugya of Gzeira Legzeira:</p>\n<p><strong>Leniency 2: Things not mention in the Torah are not forbidden because of Marit Ayin</strong>: The Pri Chadash Yoreh Deah 87:7 holds based on Tosfoat Chullin 104b, Yad Malachi Klalei Dinim 414, Gilyon Maharasha Yoreah Deah 298:1, Shu”t MIshneh Halachot 5:95, Arugot Habosem Kuntres Hateshuvot Siman 13, and others say that if Chazal did not say its assur to do X because of Marit Ayin then we cannot make a fence ourselves for it. The reason being because Marit Aiyn were placed specifically on cases that are common (similar to next answer), and the Gemera in Eruvin 63b, Beitza 2b, Ketuvot 56b, Gittin 5a, 44a, Bava Kama 84b, and Bechorot 3a (I mentioned all these cases so one can compare one case to another) says מילתא דלא שכיחא לא גזור ביה רבנ, Chachmim didn't enact things that are not common. Therefore in this case, the Torah doesn't talk about a case of using traffic light crossing that turns green automatically (or anything similar to the least of my knowledge), therefore making it permissible as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Leniency 3: We usually don't apply Marit Ayin to things that are known:</strong> The Mishnah in Kilayim 9:2 talks about material that looks like wool and linen but are actually not, are kilayim. The Rosh, Bartenura there says the times have changed and everyone knows what wool and linen look like and therefore one could wear materials that look like wool and linen. The Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 298:1 paskens like this as well. So my assumption is that there is some sort of siman, sign, or letter that went out to people that basically says something like “please be advised of traffic light crossing that turns green every 30 seconds,” and once people know about this or see a sign, there is no Marit Ayin since its common knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Leniency 4: Going in a Car after Candle Lighting is similar to this case:</strong> Igrot Moshe OC 1:96 says it is permitted for a man to drive to shul after his wife has lit candles. This is not considered Marit Ayin, since it is well known that a man can do melacha until eighteen minutes after his wife has lit candles. Even if a few people might think he did something wrong, it is not Marit Ayin since those who think he did something wrong are ignorant. So perhaps the same logic here, the Jew walking to shul just needed to wait 30 seconds which is permitted, and it's the ignorance of the non religious driver thinking he pressed the button, since there are other ways that the traffic light turns green (based on motion of cars etc).</p>\n<p><strong>Different approach to be lenient based on the fact that Marit Ayin is derabbanan:</strong> Beitza 9a, Geonim, Rif, and Rosh Beitza 9:14. בשו”ת פני יהושע ח”ב סימן ב, and others (look <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/141982/is-marit-ayin-biblical-or-rabbinic\">here</a> on my answer for Marit Ayin being derabbanan according to everyone)</p>\n<p>Sfeikot that can be taken into consideration are: Maybe the person driving won't be looking at people crossing, the driver will get there but see the person coming on to the next sidewalk on the other side without realizing how he crossed, maybe that shabbat the system didn't work and it worked regularly, and maybe the driver did not even have in mind that the person walking pressed the button. So taking all the sfiekot into account, and assuming we hold that Marit Ayin is derabbanan one could be lenient as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally,</strong> <a href=\"https://minchasasher.com/shiur/parsha-shiurim/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%95-%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%95%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%93%D7%90/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> Rav Asher Weiss says that Marit Ayin all depends on the time and location, so each case needs to be looked at by an authoritative Rabbi. Therefore no one (besides a Rabbi in that area or a big posek) can really give a true precise answer.</p>\n<p>Hope this helped!</p>\n\n\n",

We are two different people groups with two different relationships with Hashem. Even when Moshiach is here, we will still be different. If someone wants a fuller, deeper relationship with Hashem, they can become a Jew with the 613 mitzvot and everything that comes with it. Otherwise, we serve Hashem as He made us, as Noahides.</p>\n<p>Some of those commands can be derived from the 7 Noahide Laws. Some are not obligated to non-Jews and they would receive no spiritual benefit.</p>\n<p>The book, The Divine Code, by Rabbi Moshe Weiner deals extensively with this subject.</p>\n<p>Here is an <a href=\"https://asknoah.org/faq/going_beyond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">excerpt</a> from the AskNoah website - they publish the book...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“6. If a Gentile wants to do one of the other commandments from the Torah [beyond the 7 Noahide Commandments] in order to receive a practical benefit [for himself or for society] (but not as a direct commandment), [he should not be prevented] from doing so, even according to its correct laws for Jews (for example, if he desires to tithe for [proper] charity from his money or produce)… However, if a Gentile observes any of the Jewish commandments from the Torah as a religious obligation (even if he does so from a desire to receive a spiritual reward), this is forbidden based on the prohibition of adding a commandment, and there is no spiritual reward to be derived from this.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Conflicting meanings of \"Shulchan Aruch\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On the first posuk of Mishpatim, Rashi brings from Mechilta that Torah should not be conveyed as dry information, but it should be taught with its full rationale, like a שלחן ערוך, a \"table set for eating\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אשר תשים לפניהם.</strong> אמר לו הקב\"ה למשה: לא תעלה על דעתך לומר, אשנה להם הפרק וההלכה ב' או ג' פעמים, עד שתהא סדורה בפיהם כמשנתה, ואיני מטריח עצמי להבינם טעמי הדבר ופרושו, לכך נאמר אשר תשים לפניהם – כשלחן הערוך ומוכן לאכל לפני האדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given this turn of phrase, it seems odd that what we call the Shulchan Aruch is a compilation of dry, practical laws, exactly what Rashi seems to be negating with his use of the term. How did it come to have the opposite meaning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>R Yosef Karo, the author of the work, gave it that name for the following reason (from the intro):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְקָרָאתִי שֵׁם סֵפֶר זֶה שֻׁלְחָן עָרוּךְ, כִּי בוֹ יִמְצָא הַהוֹגֶה כָּל מִינֵי מַטְעַמִּים עֲרוּכִים בַּכֹּל וּשְׁמוּרִים סְדוּרִים וּבְרוּרִים.</p>\n<p>I have called this work Shulchan Aruch, for one who delves into it will find all kinds of delicacies, all arranged and preserved, and clearly ordered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The original Shulchan Aruch was meant to be a summary of the conclusions of Beis Yosef, which does explain everything at length. It was later commentators who made it into its own area of study.</p>\n\n\n",

His friend/Rabbi came to him and told him to celebrate because he was now being treated as a Levi, since he held that he was exempt from <em>maaser</em>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Re%27eh.10?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma, Re'eh 10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דְּאָמַר רַבִּי לֵוִי, מַעֲשֶׂה בְּאֶחָד שֶׁהָיָה מוֹצִיא מַעַשְׂרוֹתָיו כָּרָאוּי, וְהָיְתָה לוֹ שָׂדֶה אַחַת וְהָיְתָה עוֹשָׂה אֶלֶף מִדּוֹת, וְהָיָה מוֹצִיא מַעַשְׂרוֹתָיו מִמֶּנָּה מֵאָה מִדּוֹת לְמַעֲשֵׂר, וּמִן הַמּוֹתָר הָיָה מִתְפַּרְנֵס הוּא וּבָנָיו וּבְנֵי בֵּיתוֹ כָּל יָמָיו. בִּשְׁעַת מִיתָתוֹ קָרָא לִבְנוֹ, אָמַר, בְּנִי, תֵּן דַּעְתְּךָ עַל שָׂדֶה, כָּךְ וְכָךְ מִדּוֹת הִיא עוֹשָׂה, וְכָךְ אֲנִי מוֹצִיא מִמֶּנָּה מַעֲשֵׂר, וּמִמֶּנָּה הָיִיתִי מִתְפַּרְנֵס אֲנִי וּבֵיתִי כָּל יָמַי. שָׁנָה רִאשׁוֹנָה, זְרָעָהּ הַבֵּן אוֹתָהּ וְעָשְׂתָה אֶלֶף מִדּוֹת. הוֹצִיא מִמֶּנָּה מֵאָה מִדּוֹת מַעֲשֵׂר. שְׁנִיָּה, נִכְנַס בּוֹ עַיִן רָעָה, וּפָחַת הוּא עֲשָׂרָה, וּפָחֲתָה הִיא מֵאָה. שְׁלִישִׁית, פָּחַת הוּא עֲשָׂרָה, פָּחֲתָה הִיא מֵאָה. וְכֵן רְבִיעִית וַחֲמִישִׁית, עַד שֶׁעָמְדָה עַל מַעַשְׂרוֹתֶיהָ. כְּשֶׁרָאוּ הַקְּרוֹבִים כֵן, עָמְדוּ לָבְשׁוּ בְּגָדִים לְבָנִים וְנִתְעַטְּפוּ לְבָנִים וְנִכְנְסוּ אֶצְלוֹ. אָמַר לָהֶם: לָמָּה בָּאתֶם, לִשְׂמֹחַ עַל אוֹתוֹ הָאִישׁ שֶׁנִּדּוּהוּ. אָמְרוּ לֵיהּ, חָס וְשָׁלוֹם, לֹא בָּאנוּ אֶלָּא לִשְׂמֹחַ עִמְּךָ. לְשֶׁעָבַר הָיִיתָ בַּעַל הַבַּיִת וְהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא כֹּהֵן, וְעַכְשָׁו נַעֲשֵׂיתָ כֹּהֵן וְהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בַּעַל הַבַּיִת.</p>\n<p>As R. Levi related: There once was a person who separated his maaseros correctly. He had a field that produced a thousand units; he would separate 100 units as maaser, and throughout his life he, his children and his household would live off the rest. Before his passing he called his son and said, \"My son, pay attention to this field, which produces so-and-so many units, from which I take so-and-so much maaser, and from which I and my family lived off throughout my life.\" The first year the son planted that field and it produced a thousand units, from which he separated 100 units as maaser. In the second year he felt more stingy and reduced his maaser by 10 units, and the field produced 100 less. The next year he reduced [the maaser] by another 10, and the field's output went down by 100. This continued in the fourth and fifth year, until eventually it produced only its [original] maaser. When his relatives saw what had happened, they dressed and robed themselves in white clothing and came to visit him. He said, \"Why are you coming? To be happy about 'that man's' misfortune?\" They said, \"G-d forbid! We came only to rejoice with you! Formerly you were the landowner and G-d was the Kohen, while now you have become the Kohen and G-d the landowner!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

For example, one who mentions the names of the Five Books of the Torah: Beresheit, Shemot, Vayikra, Bamidbar, and Devarim. Afterward, the names of each and every Torah portion from the Book of Beresheit: Beresheit, Noach, Lech Lecha, etc. And afterward the names of the Early and Later Prophets and the Writings, for example: Yehoshua, Shoftim, Shmuel, Melachim, Yeshayahu, Yermiahu, Yechezkel, etc., and likewise all of them. And afterward the names of the six orders of the Mishnah: Zeraim, Moed, Nashim, Nezikin, Kodashim, Taharot, and the names of all the tractates and their chapters, as they are printed at the end of the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (SmaG).

And likewise, Midrashim that discuss divine secrets: Zohar, Tikkunei Zohar, Bahir, Pirkei Merkavah, Pliya, Kanah, and similar to them. <strong>And he recites these names, and his neshama longs for them, and he weeps for not understanding them.

However Rabbi Ovadia cites sources that if a strong wind is also pushing the wheel, that would no longer be \"human-powered.\")</p>\n<p>Thus if the prosthetic doesn't have a battery powering it, it's an easy \"yes.\" If there's a battery powering it, we get into a more complex question of whether that's still considered \"human powered\" and/or the electronic limb is an extension of the person.</p>\n<p>Shulchan Aruch continues that if a wheel is constantly being pushed by a river, that's not \"human-powered\" and would not be proper shechitah. However, if someone opened a dam which then immediately flowed to push the wheel, the wheel's first revolution is considered \"human powered\", but subsequent revolutions are not. We would not advise people to do shechitah with this first revolution, but after-the-fact, it is kosher shechita.</p>\n<p>A strong case could thus be made that even with an electrically-boosted prosthetic, each time one's natural muscles (or nerves?) trigger, it would be considered \"releasing the dammed-up\" electrical current; if we were confident that the analogy is perfect (and I'm not), the apparent conclusion would be \"we don't advise such slaughter, but it would be kosher after-the-fact.\" But that's going several steps out on a limb.</p>\n\n\n",

The Edomites were conquered by the Hasmonean King John Hyrcanus I and forcibly converted to Judaism.</p>\n<p>John Hyrcanus I was a Sadducee and may not have held by the rules that would be described in the Gemara (the product of the Pharisees). As such, Herod's status may not have been what one would expect from reading the Gemara.</p>\n<p>To resolve your contradiction:\nShmuel may have held that Herod ought to have been considered free but in practice, he was not. You can have situations in halacha where a forbidden act is still effective (e.g. Kohen marries a divorcee and she is still forbidden to other men). Herod was illegally not freed, so he is still a slave.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A2_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 70b</a> seems to answer this question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל דאמר מבית חשמונאי אנא עבד הוא - שכל זרעו הרגם הורדוס ועבד היה ומלך תחתיהן וקרא בניו על שם בית חשמונאי ומסתמא לאו בנות ישראל נסיב דנזהרים הם להשיא בנותם לעבדים והוו להו כולם עבדים:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e., he doesn't mean they are literally the property of a master, but is only referring to their lineage, in that they come from Herod's family who, being former slaves themselves, also intermarried freely with slaves, as opposed to other Jewish families who were particular not to intermarry with slaves.</p>\n<p>This question is also raised by Tosafot (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%94_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 45b</a> ד\"ה כיון).

I will illustrate this to you with a parable. To what is this matter comparable? It is comparable to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his slave and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard about this, would he not be angry with that person? And you, after all, are called slaves, as it is stated: “For the children of Israel are slaves to Me” (Leviticus 25:55). If God decreed that a certain person should be impoverished, one who gives him charity defies the will of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>with R Akiva dismissing it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר לוֹ רַבִּי עֲקִיבָא אֶמְשׁוֹל לְךָ מָשָׁל לְמָה הַדָּבָר דּוֹמֶה לְמֶלֶךְ בָּשָׂר וָדָם שֶׁכָּעַס עַל בְּנוֹ וַחֲבָשׁוֹ בְּבֵית הָאֲסוּרִין וְצִוָּה עָלָיו שֶׁלֹּא לְהַאֲכִילוֹ וְשֶׁלֹּא לְהַשְׁקוֹתוֹ וְהָלַךְ אָדָם אֶחָד וְהֶאֱכִילוֹ וְהִשְׁקָהוּ כְּשֶׁשָּׁמַע הַמֶּלֶךְ לֹא דּוֹרוֹן מְשַׁגֵּר לוֹ וַאֲנַן קְרוּיִן בָּנִים דִּכְתִיב {דברים י\"ד:א'} בָּנִים אַתֶּם לַה' אֱלֹהֵיכֶם.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Akiva said to Turnus Rufus: I will illustrate the opposite to you with a different parable. To what is this matter comparable? It is comparable to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his son and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard about this once his anger abated, would he not react by sending that person a gift? And we are called sons, as it is written: “You are sons of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R Akiva's rationale should ostensibly hold true for healing as well presumably obviating the need for a biblical allowance to provide medical treatment.</p>\n<p>Why the difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The truth is you can ask how can one fix anything that breaks if it looks like you're contradicting Gods decree.\nMy understanding of rashi is the reason why it looks like you're contradicting Gods decree, is because when a person becomes sick God wants him to repent and God will heal him. That only applies by becoming sick, if hashem breaks something you have, repenting wont make God fix it. Hashem is our healer.\nWhen it comes to charity, repentance wont necessarily give you money.

    "content": "# Did Ramban consider marital relations sinful?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Bavli Berachos 43b states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַב זוּטְרָא בַּר טוֹבִיָּה אָמַר רַב: עֲתִידִים בַּחוּרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁיִּתְּנוּ רֵיחַ טוֹב כַּלְּבָנוֹן. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: {הושע י\"ד:ז'} \"יֵלְכוּ יוֹנְקוֹתָיו וִיהִי כַזַּיִת הוֹדוֹ וְרֵיחַ לוֹ כַּלְּבָנוֹן\".</p>\n<p>And Rav Zutra bar Toviya said that Rav said: The young men of Israel are destined to emit a sweet scent as the Lebanon, as it is stated: “His branches shall spread and his beauty will be as the olive tree, and his fragrance as Lebanon” (Hosea 14:7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ramban, in explanation of <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Ramban/Shemot/24.5#m4e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 24:5</a>, quotes the gemara however he possesses a few extra words and explains them as referring to young men who have never engaged in intimate relations, deeming them the choicest and holiest of the nation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועל דרך הפשט נערי בני ישראל הם בחורי ישראל <em>שלא טעמו טעם חטא</em>, <em>שלא נגשו אל אשה מעולם</em>, <em>כי הם הנבחרים בעם והקדושים בהם</em>, כענין שאמרו (בבלי ברכות מ\"ג:) עתידין בחורי ישראל <em>שלא טעמו טעם חטא</em> ליתן ריח כלבנון וכו'.</p>\n<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, the young men of the children of Israel were the youth of Israel who had not tasted of sin, and had never come near a woman, for they were the most select and holy of the people, in a similar manner to that which the Rabbis have said: \"The young men of Israel who have not tasted of sin are destined to give forth a fragrance like the Lebanon etc.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, in Ramban's critique of R Avraham ibn Ezra's conception of Yiftach's daughter being consigned to a life of celibate asceticism, he surprisingly seems to compare the promotion of marriage over a celibate life devoted to God as supporting prostitution, writing as follows (<a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Ramban/Vayikra/27.29#m6e1n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikrah 27:29</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם הדבר כן, היתה בתו הבוכה על בתוליה ורעותיה עמה כזונות לקלס אתנן, וחס ושלום שתהיה חוק בישראל לתנות לבת יפתח ארבעת ימים בשנה (שופטים י\"א:מ') מפני שלא נשאת לבעל והיתה עובדת את השם בטהרה.</p>\n<p>And if the matter be so [as Ibn Ezra put it] then Jephthah's daughter would be bewailing her virginity with her companions with her,⁠ like harlots enhancing their hire!⁠ Heaven forbid that this be a custom in Israel, to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year because she did not marry and she worshipped G-d in purity!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ramban seems to indicate that all intimate relations mar a person's purity—even within the context of marriage.</p>\n<p>Did Ramban consider marital relations less than ideal if not sinful?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Ramban writes that holiness is staying away from permissible indulgences such as marital relations and Kosher food (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Leviticus.19.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 19:2</a>). Even with one's wife he writes that one can only have marital relations to procreate (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Leviticus.18.6.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 18:6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Leviticus.18.19.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">19</a>).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32764&st=&pgnum=117\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kur Zahav</a> writes that the Ramban obviously agrees that one can have marital relations in order to prevent sinful thoughts.</p>\n<p>That seems to be in regards to getting married when one cannot have children but I would add that obviously when its a Mitzvah, like Friday night (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.62b.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 62b</a>), one must have relations.</p>\n<p>Regarding marital relations being a sin, King David says implies it always is a sin (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.51.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 51:7</a>). My grandfather, Rav Eliezer Ben David (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1amtaeKAaYqNzKQuHb95pQTeRvVtfJfb7kCgD4hdLDb0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohi HaAvodah, ibid and B'reshit 3:17</a>), explains that one is made of an animalistic body and a Godly soul. Anything that requires one to strengthen the \"animal\" is considered a sin, this includes eating and marital relations (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.16a.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hagigah 16a</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>@Mordechai cites Ramban on the second verse of Parashat Kedoshim (Vayikra 19:2) in his answer.</p>\n<p>I set out below the Ramban on Vaikra 19:2 in full (Charles Chavel translation 1971-1976 translation, copied from Sefaria). This Ramban is very well known for his cautioning against becoming a “<em>sordid person within the permissible realm of the Torah</em>” נבל ברשות התורה</p>\n<p>This Ramban is very well worth reading in full which is why I have copied it in full below. Reading it in full gives context to the following phrases extract from it which address marital relations in the context of not being a נבל ברשות התורה [emphasis added by me]:</p>\n<p>\"The Torah has admonished us against immorality and forbidden foods, but <strong>permitted sexual intercourse between man and his wife</strong>, and the eating of [certain] meat and wine. If so, <strong>a man of desire could consider this to be a permission to be passionately addicted to sexual intercourse with his wife or many wives</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>\"One should <strong>minimize sexual intercourse</strong>, similar to that which the Rabbis have said, “<strong>So that the disciples of the Sages should not be found together with their wives as often as the hens</strong>,” and he should <strong>not engage in it except as required in fulfillment of the commandment thereof</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>I feel confident concluding that Ramban did <strong>not</strong> \"consider marital relations less than ideal if not sinful.\"  He cautions us to exercise self-control in all things permitted.</p>\n<p><em><strong>RAMBAN on Vayikra 19:2 in full:</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>YE SHALL BE HOLY</strong>. “Abstain from the forbidden sexual relationships [mentioned in the preceding section] and from [other] sin, because wherever you find [in the Torah] a warning to guard against immorality, you find the mention of ‘holiness.’” This is Rashi’s language. But in the Torath Kohanim I have seen it mentioned without any qualification [i.e., without any particular reference to immorality, as Rashi expressed it], saying: “Be self-restraining.” Similarly, the Rabbis taught there: “<em>And ye shall sanctify yourselves, and be ye holy, for I am Holy</em>. Just as I am Holy, so be you holy. Just as I am Pure, so be you pure.”</p>\n<p>And in my opinion, this abstinence does not refer only to restraint from acts of immorality, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, but it is rather the self-control mentioned throughout the Talmud, which confers upon those who practice it the name of <em>P’rushim</em> (Pharisees), [literally: “those who are separated” from self-indulgence, as will be explained, or those who practice self-restraint]. The meaning thereof is as follows: The Torah has admonished us against immorality and forbidden foods, but permitted sexual intercourse between man and his wife, and the eating of [certain] meat and wine. If so, a man of desire could consider this to be a permission to be passionately addicted to sexual intercourse with his wife or many wives, and be <em>among winebibbers, among gluttonous eaters of flesh</em>, and speak freely all profanities, since this prohibition has not been [expressly] mentioned in the Torah, and thus he will become a sordid person within the permissible realm of the Torah (נבל ברשות התורה)!</p>\n<p>Therefore, after having listed the matters which He prohibited altogether, Scripture followed them up by a general command that we practice moderation even in matters which are permitted, [such as in the following]: One should minimize sexual intercourse, similar to that which the Rabbis have said, “So that the disciples of the Sages should not be found together with their wives as often as the hens,” and he should not engage in it except as required in fulfillment of the commandment thereof. He should also sanctify himself [to self-restraint] by using wine in small amounts, just as Scripture calls a Nazirite “holy” [for abstaining from wine and strong drink], and he should remember the evils which the Torah mentioned as following from [drinking wine] in the cases of Noah and Lot. Similarly, he should keep himself away from impurity [in his ordinary daily activity], even though we have not been admonished against it in the Torah, similar to that which the Rabbis have said: “For the <em>P’rushim</em> (Pharisees), the clothes of the unlearned are considered as if trodden upon by a <em>zav</em>” [or <em>zavah</em> — a man or woman having suffered a flux], and just as the Nazirite is called “holy” because of guarding himself from the impurity of the dead. Likewise he should guard his mouth and tongue from being defiled by excessive food and by lewd talk, similar to what Scripture states, <em>and every mouth speaketh wantonness</em>, and he should purify himself in this respect until he reaches the degree known as [complete] “self-restraint,” as the Rabbis said concerning Rabbi Chiya, that never in his life did he engage in unnecessary talk.</p>\n<p>It is with reference to these and similar matters that this general commandment [<em>Ye shall be holy</em>] is concerned, after He had enumerated all individual deeds which are strictly forbidden, so that cleanliness of hands and body, are also included in this precept, just like the Rabbis have said: “<em>And ye shall sanctify yourselves</em>. This refers to the washing of hands before meals. <em>And be ye holy</em>. This refers to the washing of hands after meals [before the reciting of grace]. <em>For I am holy</em> — this alludes to the spiced oil” [with which they used to rub their hands after a meal]. For although these [washings and perfuming of the hands] are commandments of Rabbinic origin, yet Scripture’s main intention is to warn us of such matters, that we should be [physically] clean and [ritually] pure, and separated from the common people who soil themselves with luxuries and unseemly things. And such is the way of the Torah, that after it lists certain specific prohibitions, it includes them all in a general precept.</p>\n<p>Thus after warning with detailed laws regarding all business dealings between people, such as not to steal or rob or to wrong one another, and other similar prohibitions, He said in general, <em>And thou shalt do that which is right and good</em>, thus including under a positive commandment the duty of doing that which is right and of agreeing to a compromise [when not to do so would be inequitable]; as well as all requirements to act “beyond” the line of justice [i.e., to be generous in not insisting upon one’s rights as defined by the strict letter of the law, but to agree to act “beyond” that line of the strict law] for the sake of pleasing one’s fellowman, as I will explain when I reach there [that verse], with the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. Similarly in the case of the Sabbath, He prohibited doing certain classes of work by means of a negative commandment, and painstaking labors [not categorized as “work,” such as transferring heavy loads in one’s yard from one place to another, etc.] He included under a general positive commandment, as it is said, <em>but on the seventh day thou shalt rest</em>. I will yet explain this with the help of G-d.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See the איגרת הקודש, from the writings of the Ramban. (I don't see an online source.) He speaks very strongly <em>against</em> the idea that relations are inherently sinful, and criticizes Aristotle severely for suggesting such a thing and the Rambam for supporting him. After all, our relationship with Hashem is described in exactly that way, in Shir Hashirim. It is holy, not sinful.<br />\n<em>However</em>, there is a big dispute whether Igeres Hakodesh was actually written by the Ramban. You can see a discussion in the Chavel edition of the Ramban or elsewhere (such as <a href=\"https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/iggeret-ha-kodesh#pid-823\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/iggeret-ha-kodesh#pid-823</a>). It was clearly written by a mekubal, and the Ramban was that as well. So whether he was the author or not, this may have been something that the Ramban did not want to mention in his other writings, although I have no evidence for that at all.</p>\n\n\n",

But that is a minority opinion.  The rest of the sources say clearly that Judaism does not punish preemptively.  For example, when Abraham chased away Ishmael and his mother Hagar, they were dying of thirst in the desert, but God opened up a well for them. The Torah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God has heard the voice of the lad where he is. [Gen. 21:17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud interprets “where he is” as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yitzhaq further said: Man is judged only according to his actions up to the time of judgment. [Rosh Hashanah 16b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Simon said: The ministering angels… exclaimed:  “Lord of the universe, will you bring up a well for [Ishmael], who will one day slay your children with thirst?” God asked them: “At this moment, what is he?” “Righteous,” they replied. [God answered:] “I judge man only as he is at the moment.” [Gen. R. 53:14]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Besides, everyone can repent (do teshuva) and thereby be redeemed.  The psalmist writes:  Though my father and my mother have rejected me, the Lord will receive me. [Ps. 27:10]</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, you're <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2022/11/the-mitzvah-of-talmud-torah-torah-study/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">required</a> to spend some time studying Torah.</p>\n<p>Outside your university's <a href=\"https://regenesis.eco/en/circular-economy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">free store</a>, there's a free library.  It's much more informal than the school's official library.  There are several bookcases.  Anyone can donate books or take free books.  The books are almost all about secular subjects, such as business, anthropology, environmental science, and others.</p>\n<p>When the free library gets too full, you might want to volunteer to weed it.  You discard old and/or damaged books.  Weeding can make room for newer and better books.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeding_(library)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Source.)</a></p>\n<p>All libraries must be weeded, or else they might end up packed full of outdated and unwanted books.</p>\n<h1>My question</h1>\n<p>You might volunteer to weed the free library once a year.  You might spend a few hours, or more, on the weeding project.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this weeding project is a mitzvah of chesed, which helps your fellow students to access recent, undamaged free books.  Or perhaps it's a waste of time, which could have been better spent on Torah study.  Which view is correct?</p>\n<p>If possible, please provide answers from a Modern Orthodox perspective.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Weeding the library would be an excellent opportunity to remove anti Zionist, anti semitic, queer, and other objectionable material.</p>\n<p>But if you're not going for that angle, Weeding it exceptionally properly, however, could produce a small kiddush hashem.</p>\n<p>It's not a chesed because the students could just go to the regular, better organized, library. In fact, it takes work away from the paid librarians. If the books are outdated, you could be misleading people by giving the obsolete, and potentially incorrect books, more people exposure.</p>\n<p>I\"d say it's a waste of time with no spiritual benefit, and if you don't find it enjoyable, it's worse than a spiritually barren activity that you do enjoy.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Egg donation from a mamzer\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Halacha, is it permissible for a Jewish woman who is a Mamzer to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">donate her eggs</a> to help a non-Mamzer Jewish woman become fertile? Or no, because Mamzerim are prohibited from “entering the congregation of Israel” would it be prohibited? If permissible, would the children be mamzerim or no? One reason why it would matter is because there is a discussion amongst the poskim whether a child from an egg donation can have two halachic mothers (their egg donor and gestational mother).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Let's just go with \"Not recommended.\"</p>\n<p>Today, most poskim in both Israel and America will shrug on questions of which mother -- egg or host -- is recognized by halacha, and be strict both ways. (Rabbi Aharon Soloveitchik zt\"l forcefully opined that it was the host mother, and only the host mother, but -- today the most common reaction you'll hear from rabbis is \"let's play it safe.\")</p>\n<p>Rabbi Willig has a YUTorah mp3 where he notes that according to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, mamzer status is conferred upon the next generation only when everything occurs naturally. A mamzer could do IVF and the child would be a non-mamzer. By that logic, then, the donor egg from a mamzeret would not cause the next generation to be mamzerim. Rabbi Willig notes that according to this opinion, you'd have a married couple conceiving all their children through IVF for purely religious, not medical, reasons.</p>\n<p>However common practice today is not to rely on that opinion of Rabbi Feinstein.</p>\n<p>So while there were some notable opinions (past tense) that this would theoretically not pass on mamzerut, today's poskim would not rely on that. So let's not create any more problems.</p>\n\n\n",

Now, 72 is a number of significance in Kabbalah. There are 72 names of Hashem and the Name of Hashem is Gematria 72 (במילוי יודין). What are the connections and which sources make the connection?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I saw in non-Jewish sources that Urim and Thumim are two stones placed inside the Ephod. As far as I understand there is nothing like this in Jewish sources. The shem meforash is inserted inside the Ephod and then the Ephod functions as the Urim and Thumim. Am I right or am I missing something?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Gemara (Yoma 73), there were 72 letters on the stones of the <em>choshen</em>. Rabbeinu Bachya (Tetzaveh 28:15) points out the parallel between 72 letters and the 72 letter Name of G-d.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרי לך בכל אבן ואבן ששה אותיות להורות כי ששת ימי המעשה תלוים בי\"ב\nשבטים, והיו באבני חושן ע\"ב אותיות, כי י\"ב פעמים ששה הם ע\"ב, והם כנגד\nע\"ב אותיות של השם הגדול להורות בזה קיום העולם שנברא בע\"ב שעות, שהרי\nהעולם נברא ביום שנאמר 'ביום עשות ה' אלהים ארץ ושמים' וששת ימי המעשה\nע\"ב שעות יש בהם י\"ב שעות בכל יום וזהו שאמר הכתוב (תהלים פט) אמרתי עולם\nחסד יבנה כמנין חס\"ד ולמדנו מזה שהעולם שנברא בע\"ב שעות מתקיים בזכות\nהשבטים שבהם ע\"ב אותיות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The six letters on each of the twelve stones correspond to 6 Days of the Week being reliant on the Twelve Tribes of Israel; the 72 letters correspond to the 72 letters of the Name of G-d, which symbolizes the continuity of the world which was created in 72 hours (Creation was only during the day; 6 Days x 12 Hours = 72 Hours of creation) as hinted in עולם חס\"ד יבנה (חס\"ד has numerical value of 72).</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> 72 letters symbolize the Creation, and hints to the fact the continuity of the world's existence is in the merit of the Shevatim, who contain 72 letters.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This is in accordance with the Gemara (Yoma 73) which quotes שבטי ישרון, or Yerushalmi שבטי ישראל. According to Rambam, the words שבטי י''ה appeared, which has 69 letters - 3 less than the 72.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Regarding your first question, your assumptions about the Ephod are incorrect. Most of what you describe as pertaining to the Ephod, is in fact, details relating to the <strong>Breastplate of Judgement</strong> and the <strong>Urim v’Tumim</strong>.</p>\n<p>The two onyx stones of the Ephod are only engraved with the 50 letters of the names of the twelve tribes, 25 letters on the right shoulder and 25 letters on the left shoulder. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.28.12?lang=he&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 28:12</a>)</p>\n<p>That said, the letters engraved on the two onyx stones of the Ephod do have a relationship to the letters engraved on the twelve stones of the Breastplate of Judgement and in turn the letters written on the klaf (the animal hide similar to those prepared for a mezuzah or Sefer Torah) of the Urim v’Tumim.</p>\n<p>These letters engraved on the stones of the Ephod relate to the 72 letters engraved on the stones of the Breastplate (חשן משפט),  worn by the Kohen Gadol, like is described by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.28.15?lang=he&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachya to Tetzaveh 28:15</a>.  For the full description, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.28.15-21?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 28:15-21</a>.</p>\n<p>For a thorough discussion of the connection between the names on the two stones of the Ephod and the names on the twelve stones of the Choshen Mishpat (<em>the Breastplate of Judgement</em>), see the discourse of the second Lubavitcher Rebbe, <em>the Mitteler Rebbe</em>, Rabbi Dovber, זצ״ל, in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39390&st=&pgnum=213\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat Chaim on Shemot, volume 2, parshat Tetzaveh, page 355a and b, beginning with the words, והנה ע״ד כ״ז יובן ג״כ בענין ב׳ אבני שה״ם בב׳ כתפות האפוד כו׳.</a></p>\n<p>Like the Ari z\"l, Ramchal and the Ba'al Shem Tov teach, there are 4 expanded forms (called <em>Miloy</em> מלוי) of G-d's 4 letter name (יהוה), which correspond to the descent from <strong>higher</strong> (<em>greater revelation of spiritual existence and less material existence</em>) to <strong>lower</strong> (<em>greater material existence and less spiritual</em>). These four general levels correspond to the four general worlds or universes (<em>States of Existence</em>) described as <strong>Atzilut</strong> (Emanation), <strong>Beriah</strong> (Creation), <strong>Yetzirah</strong> (Formation and <strong>Asiah</strong> (Action).</p>\n<p>That name that you mention in your question with a plain Gematria of 72 (יו׳ד, ה׳י, וי׳ו, ה׳י) corresponds to the world of Atzilut. It is not the name referenced in connection with the Choshen HaMishpat although its gematria value does establish a relationship.</p>\n<p>Regarding your second question relating to the Urim v’Tumim, again, most of your assumptions are incorrect. So the answer to your question is no, you are not correct and yes, you are missing something.</p>\n<p>What follows will hopefully help you to understand what is actually the traditional Orthodox Jewish teaching about the 72 letters engraved on the stones of the Breastplate of Judgement and their relationship to the letters which make up the <strong>Great Name of 72</strong> that is written on the Urim v’Tumim.</p>\n<p>The \"72 letter\" name (of G-d) related to the Choshen HaMishpat and called by Rabbeinu Bachya <em>The Great Name</em>, השם הגדול, is actually the name written on the klaf of the Urim v’Tumim like is emphasized in the commentary <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.28.30?lang=he&with=Kitzur%20Ba%27al%20HaTurim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Ba’al HaTurim to Shemot 28:30</a> (<em>credit to chortkov2 for this reference</em>) who doesn’t refer to letters at all but simply <em>the name of 72</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אורים ותומים בגי' אור ישראל. <strong>את האורים ואת התומים</strong>. כגי' שם בן שבעים ושתים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reference to <em>the 72 letter name</em> by Rabbeinu Bachya is not a separate name containing 72 individual letters. It is called <em>the Great Name of 72</em> because the triplets (the 3 letter <em>root-groupings</em> which comprise <strong>the Great Name</strong>, like the individual letters of the Aleph-Beit, when in מלוי form, are sometimes referred to as אותוון (<em>letters</em>). This is in contrast to the term אותיות which is used only in the context of single letters.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To revisit the commentary of Rabbeinu Bachya:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וקבועים בו ארבעה טורים אבן וכל אבן ואבן היה מרובע, ומפתח שמות י\"ב שבטים על י\"ב אבנים, ראובן היה מפותח על אבן אודם, שמעון על פטדה, וכן כולם. ומלבד י\"ב שבטים שהיו כתובים על י\"ב אבנים הללו היו כתובים שמות האבות אברהם יצחק יעקב ושבטי ישרון. וכסדר הזה היו כתובים ראובן א' על אודם, שמעון ב' על פטדה, לוי רה\"ם על ברקת, יהודה י' על נופך, יששכר צ' על ספיר, זבולן ח' על יהלום, דן ק' יע\"ק על לשם, נפתלי ב' על שבו, גד שבט\"י על אחלמה, אשר יש\"ר על תרשיש, יוסף ו\"ן על שהם, בנימין על ישפה, הרי לך בכל אבן ואבן ששה אותיות להורות כי ששת ימי המעשה תלוים בי\"ב שבטים, והיו באבני חושן ע\"ב אותיות כי י\"ב פעמים ששה הם ע\"ב והם כנגד ע\"ב אותיות של השם הגדול להורות בזה קיום העולם שנברא בע\"ב שעות שהרי העולם נברא ביום שנאמר (בראשית ב ד) ביום עשות ה' אלהים ארץ ושמים, וששת ימי המעשה ע\"ב שעות יש בהם י\"ב שעות בכל יום, וזהו שאמר הכתוב (תהילים פ״ט:ג׳) אמרתי עולם חסד יבנה כמנין חס\"ד, ולמדנו מזה שהעולם שנברא בע\"ב שעות מתקיים בזכות השבטים שבהם ע\"ב אותיות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>(Free Translation)</em></p>\n<p>And they affixed to it (<em>meaning to the pure gold framework described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.28.13?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 28:13-14 for the Choshen Mishpat</a></em>) stone rows and each stone was square.

See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.28.1-8?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BeMidbar 28:1-8</a> and specifically <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.28.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">28:6</a>)</p>\n<p>That just like smoke rises from the offering burned on the altar; when we (ריח) <em>elevate</em> the גבורה (216) (<em><strong>Severity</strong></em>), we precipitate ניחח, (as in the expression ניחות דרגה or נחת רוח) from G-d, a corresponding downward and opposite flow of blessing into Creation, an effulgence of (72) חסד (<em><strong>Kindness</strong></em>). That transforming the transitory state of Gevurah (216) results in a threefold increase of Kindness (72). That the concept of three also relates to permanence (חזקה).</p>\n<p>In kabbalistic nomenclature this principle is called: אתערותא דלתתא אתערותא דלעילא.</p>\n<p>This process and relationship is an explicit teaching from Moshe Rabbeinu coming from the proper alignment of the 3 posukim from parshat BeShallach and <em>the splitting of the Reed Sea</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.19-21?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 14:19-21</a> which form the Great Name of 72 three letter roots. The first and third posukim are in correct reading order, from right to left, while the middle posuk is reversed to read from left to right.</p>\n<p>This principle of conversion from one state of being to another is also related to the first sign that Moshe and Aharon made before Pharaoh in Egypt. This was the conversion of the staff to a serpent and back again onto a staff.</p>\n<p>This flipping principle also corresponds to the triple blessing recited by the Kohanim in Birkat Kohanim.</p>\n<p>This Great Name of 216 letters (216 which is the gematria of גבורה) which is comprised of 72 three-letter roots, one letter from each of the three consecutive posukim from Shemot 14:19-21 (72 which is the gematria of חסד) is what was written on the klaf called the <strong>Urim v'Tumim</strong> and inserted into the Choshen Mishpat.</p>\n<p>The non-Jewish source you mention likely misunderstood the meaning of the Hebrew. That the letters of the name of 72 triplets (actually 216 individual letters) are also referred to as <em>stones</em> (אבנים), because like it says in Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 1, the letters of the Aleph-Beit are also called stones. And the Hebrew word אבנים means, minimally, two stones. They associated the expression את-האורים ואת התמים to mean literally two stones possibly coated with gold.

The Kohen Gadol would then, via Divine Inspiration (רוח הקודש), understand what message was intended from the illuminated letters, meaning their proper arrangement, word breaks and interpretation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To address your second question and as Nahum pointed out in the comments, Ibn Ezra on Shmos 28:6 explains that the Urim and Thumim were astrological devices. The Ramban quotes Ibn Ezra in Shmos 28:30 as saying that they were made of gold and silver and fashioned by an artisan, but the Ramban argues and goes with the general interpretation of them being parchment with divine names on them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Temporarily Banning a Rishon’s Sefer – Is There a Precedent?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard from a reliable source that a great Rosh Hayeshiva (who I personally knew) <strong>temporarily</strong> banned a set of seforim from the Yeshiva's beit midrash.</p>\n<p>The Talmud in shabbat 56a states that it is wrong to say that David sinned with Batsheva:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָנִי אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹנָתָן: כׇּל הָאוֹמֵר דָּוִד חָטָא אֵינוֹ אֶלָּא טוֹעֶה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וַיְהִי דָּוִד לְכׇל דְּרָכָיו מַשְׂכִּיל וַה׳ עִמּוֹ וְגוֹ׳״. אֶפְשָׁר חֵטְא בָּא לְיָדוֹ וּשְׁכִינָה עִמּוֹ?!\nRabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who says that David sinned with Bathsheba is nothing other than mistaken, as it is stated: “And David succeeded in all his ways; and the Lord was with him” (I Samuel 18:14). Is it possible that sin came to his hand and nevertheless the Divine Presence was with him?\nאֶלָּא מָה אֲנִי מְקַיֵּים ״מַדּוּעַ בָּזִיתָ אֶת דְּבַר ה׳ לַעֲשׂוֹת הָרַע״ — שֶׁבִּיקֵּשׁ לַעֲשׂוֹת וְלֹא עָשָׂה.\nHowever, how then do I establish the meaning of the rebuke of the prophet Nathan: “Why have you despised the word of the Lord, to do that which is evil in My sight? Uriah the Hittite you have smitten with the sword, and his wife you have taken to be your wife, and him you have slain with the sword of the children of Ammon” (II Samuel 12:9), indicating that David sinned? The Gemara answers: David sought to do evil and have relations with Bathsheba while she was still married to Uriah but did not do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi explains per the Gemarra that soldiers would give conditional bills of divorce that worked retroactively. Thus, when David slept with Batsheva, technically, she was not married.</p>\n<p>The Abarbanel states that in truth he did commit adultery. 2 Samuel 11 :10</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>, ולכן לא יסבול דעתי להקל בחטאת דוד, ולא אכחיש האמת הפשוט,… טוב לי שאומר שחטא מאד והודה מאד ושב בתשובה גמורה וקבל ענשו ובזה נתכפרו עונותיו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Upon reviewing this Abarbanel passage, per a reliable source, this Rosh Hayeshiva banned the set temporarily from the yeshiva’s study hall. I did not have a chance to ask him about his decision. A thought: there are many examples of commentators favoring pshat over drash; but because adultery is a grave sin (and accusing David of this is a big deal), the Rosh Hayeshiva must have felt compelled to act. Moreover, there are examples of achronim repudiating rishonim. <strong>But a temporary book ban is unique.</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a precedent for such a temporary banning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think it is up to the leader of any institution to decide what to allow on the shelves. Rav Ruderman zt\"l of Ner Yisroel in Baltimore banned many books he did not want the students to learn, and for various reasons. Sometimes just because he felt they would be too distracting. Others because he disagreed with their philosophy. In my time, there was no Abarbanel on the shelves. I don't know if it was this passage, or the many others where Abarbanel takes a non-standard approach.</p>\n<p>Rav Shach zt\"l did not allow copies of his own seforim, Avi Ezri, on the shelves of the yeshiva he headed, Ponovezh. He wanted students to focus on learning Gemara, and not spend so much time on works such as his own.</p>\n\n\n",

Reports indicate that it is one of the most graphic and gruesome films ever made.</p>\n<p>My understanding is that the IDF controls who sees the film. Certainly, in the early stages, very few were showed the film. Upon information and belief not every IDF soldier has been given an opportunity to see the film. In the end, I respect and defer to the IDF's decision.</p>\n<p>Is it halachically appropriate for the IDF to widely disseminate the film (an appropriate rating- adults can choose to see it) based on the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shoftim - 19:29-30\nוַיָּבֹ֣א אֶל־בֵּית֗וֹ וַיִּקַּ֤ח אֶת־הַֽמַּאֲכֶ֙לֶת֙ וַיַּחֲזֵ֣ק בְּפִֽילַגְשׁ֔וֹ וַֽיְנַתְּחֶ֙הָ֙ לַעֲצָמֶ֔יהָ לִשְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָׂ֖ר נְתָחִ֑ים וַֽיְשַׁלְּחֶ֔הָ בְּכֹ֖ל גְּב֥וּל יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃\nWhen he came home, he picked up a knife, and took hold of his concubine and cut her up limb by limb into twelve parts.

The man was not chastised for his actions - on the contrary, he rallied the amassing Jewish army that sought and got retribution for the act. His direct evidence was the lynchpin in impassioning the Jewish army.</p>\n<p>Many holocaust films depict carnage and death and are available to the masses as an important tool in setting the record straight and documenting the reality of heinous inhumanity.</p>\n<p>Is Pilegesh B'Givah a valid precedent for the broad dissemination of this film? if so, how broad?

So too, no Jew can be\ntruly happy living in Exile, far away from his God-given homeland.\nEven on Shabbat most people are distracted by their weekday pursuits\nand worries, and are not fully at peace. On Yom Tov, however, people\nare in a more festive mood, especially during the Mussaf service. As\nsuch, the custom evolved to only perform Birkat Kohanim on Yom Tov.\n(Rema, OC 128:44)</p>\n<p>Another explanation offered for only performing\nBirkat Kohanim on Yom Tov is that it is <strong>preferable, if possible, for\nBirkat Kohanim to be performed by a Kohen who has recently immersed in\na mikva</strong>. Since most people don’t immerse in a mikva on a daily basis,\nor even Erev Shabbat for that matter, Birkat Kohanim was deferred to\nYom Tov when more people make an effort to immerse in a mikva before\nYom Tov.

The three fives [in this verse] correspond to the five books of the Pentateuch, to the five commandments inscribed on the first tablet, and the five commandments inscribed on the second one. Until this point, [my comments were] in the name of Rabbi Moses Hadarshan [the preacher].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I understand that Moshe learned the whole Torah but that was just the Klalim, the rules of how to teach and understand the Torah, not the books themselves.</p>\n<p>Therefore, how do we understand the sacrifices corresponding to Nevi'im if the books of Nevi'im were not yet written?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is drawn from Rav Moshe HaDarshan, Sefer Yesod, though I don't know if that part is still extant. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.7.23.2?lang=bi&with=Bamidbar%20Rabbah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar Rabba</a> seems to be from Rav Moshe HaDarshan, where we see this spelled out.</p>\n<p>The idea behind this is not a mnemonic, as one commenter suggested, though perhaps a \"bit of derash\" works. The theme in the midrash is as follows. Each Nasi is giving an identical gift towards the Mishkan. While identical in surface form, each gift has its own underlying intended meaning related to his tribe's deep identity. So one Nasi's three corresponded to the three crowns; another to the three forefathers; another to the three generations after Yosef, and so on.</p>\n<p>I don't think Rav Moshe HaDarshan was specifically worried about anachronisms, like that the books of Neviim and Ketuvin had not yet been written. Regardless, it isn't that Moshe had this in mind. Rather, this is on the 11th day, the Nasi of Yissachar (the strong-boned donkey), who is generally associated with the burden of learning Torah. (For instance, consider the oft-misunderstood Yissachar-Zevulun partnership.) Therefore, the deep meaning of his gift will correspond to Torah in all its forms as it existed and will exist; in the five commandments on each tablet; on the five-fold (chumash) divided Torah that Moshe wrote / would write, but which was still developing as they experienced it; and in the threefold structure of TaNaCh. This was the deep meaning behind it, and wasn't Moshe's intent, maybe not even Netanel ben Tzuar's intent.</p>\n<p>If it was an intent instead of a deep mystical meaning known by Hashem, then Moshe perhaps knew that there would be prophets after him, and perhaps knew that there would be different levels of Divinely-inspired writings. I don't see why Rav Moshe HaDarshan would require that Moshe knew the content of those eventual writings.</p>\n<p>As an alternative answer, perhaps one could investigate textual variants. As it appears in Bemidbar Rabba, they actually have a different text for the davar acher for the meaning of the three. That is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(במדבר ז, עז): אֵילִם חֲמִשָּׁה עַתֻּדִים חֲמִשָּׁה כְּבָשִׂים בְּנֵי שָׁנָה חֲמִשָּׁה, אֵלּוּ שְׁלשָׁה מִינֵי שְׁלָמִים, כְּנֶגֶד כֹּהֲנִים לְוִיִם וְיִשְׂרְאֵלִים. דָּבָר אַחֵר, <strong>כְּנֶגֶד שָׁלשׁ גְּדֻלּוֹת שֶׁנָּתַן לָהֶם הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בִּשְׂכַר שֶׁקִּבְּלוּ אֶת הַתּוֹרָה</strong>, וְאֵלּוּ הֵן: סְגֻלָּה, מַמְלֶכֶת כֹּהֲנִים, וְגוֹי קָדוֹשׁ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות יט, ה ו): וִהְיִיתֶם לִי סְגֻלָּה מִכָּל הָעַמִּים כִּי לִי כָל הָאָרֶץ וְאַתֶּם תִּהְיוּ לִי מַמְלֶכֶת כֹּהֲנִים וְגוֹי קָדוֹשׁ. הֵם הָיוּ הַשְּׁלשָׁה מִינִין מִן חֲמִשָּׁה חֲמִשָּׁה, וְעוֹלֶה חֶשְׁבּוֹנָם חֲמִשָּׁה עָשָׂר, כְּנֶגֶד הַתּוֹרָה שֶׁהִיא חֲמִשָּׁה סְפָרִים וַעֲשֶׂרֶת הַדִּבְּרוֹת שֶׁקִּבְּלוּ שֶׁנִּכְתְּבוּ עַל שְׁתֵּי לוּחוֹת, חָמֵשׁ עַל לוּחַ זֶה וְחָמֵשׁ עַל לוּחַ זֶה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, rather than 3 == TaNaCh, 3 == the greatnesses that Hashem granted them for accepting the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

The mishna in Rosh Hashana says that those who (correctly) broke <em>techum</em> to report the new moon and did so were then constrained to one big building, but the rabbis realized that would make them miserable enough that they might not come again; instead, the rabbis allowed them to walk all over Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>At first glance, that means they're breaking <em>rabbinic</em> techum, which would mean that we'd let the emergency responder take a taxi home, but not drive their own gas-powered car. However Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (master of the thought experiment) noted that some of these \"new moon\" witnesses may in fact have arrived from 11.9 \"mil\" away; the \"let them walk all over Jerusalem\" would have them crossing the Biblically-prohibited <em>techum</em> line.

Is it due to their deeds or issues related to their past lives that need to be resolved in this life?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Sotah 2a (which zunior quotes), does correlate actions with finding a partner, but it should be noted that the Gemara goes on to say that it is a person's first match which is decreed in heaven, while the second match is according to one's actions.</p>\n<p>There are other important rabbinic sources on soulmates. One is Moed Katan 18b, which says that a match is set by Hashem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָכִי אָמַר רַב מִשּׁוּם רַבִּי רְאוּבֵן בֶּן אִצְטְרוֹבִילִי: מִן הַתּוֹרָה וּמִן הַנְּבִיאִים וּמִן הַכְּתוּבִים — מֵה׳ אִשָּׁה לְאִישׁ. מִן הַתּוֹרָה, דִּכְתִיב: ״וַיַּעַן לָבָן וּבְתוּאֵל וַיֹּאמְרוּ מֵה׳ יָצָא הַדָּבָר״. מִן הַנְּבִיאִים, דִּכְתִיב: ״וְאָבִיו וְאִמּוֹ לֹא יָדְעוּ כִּי מֵה׳ הִיא״. מִן הַכְּתוּבִים, דִּכְתִיב: ״בַּיִת וָהוֹן נַחֲלַת אָבוֹת וּמֵה׳ אִשָּׁה מַשְׂכָּלֶת״.</p>\n<p>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Reuven ben Itzterobili as follows: From the Torah, and from the Prophets, and from the Writings; it implies that the decree that a specific woman is destined to be married to a specific man is from God. From where is this derived? It is from the Torah, as it is written: “Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said: The thing comes from the Lord, we cannot speak to you either bad or good” (Genesis 24:50). From the Prophets, as it is written: “But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord” (Judges 14:4). From the Writings, as it is written: “House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; but a prudent woman is from the Lord” (Proverbs 19:14).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, there are many sources in the midrash that emphasize the miraculous and divine-decreed nature of marriages. That said, as we know from Pirkei Avot (3:15) and other sources, we have free will:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַכֹּל צָפוּי, וְהָרְשׁוּת נְתוּנָה, וּבְטוֹב הָעוֹלָם נִדּוֹן.\nוְהַכֹּל לְפִי רֹב הַמַּעֲשֶׂה</p>\n<p>All is forseen, yet freedom of choice is given.

Rav Weinberg records that Rav\nAzriel Hildesheimer and Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch (two great German\nRabbis of the nineteenth century) sanctioned this practice. Rav\nWeinberg reports that they based their ruling on the Talmudic rule\n(Megila 21b) that “Trei Kali Lo Mishtamai,” two voices cannot be heard\nsimultaneously.</p>\n<p>Rav Weinberg writes that he does not find this explanation satisfying\n(perhaps because the Gemara (Sotah 48a) writes that men and women\nsinging together is a major impropriety). Rav Weinberg instead defends\nthe German Jewish practice by citing the Sdei Chemed (Klalim,\nMaarechet Hakuf, 42) who quotes the Divrei Cheifetz who asserts that\nthe Kol Isha prohibition does not apply to women singing Zemirot,\nsinging songs to children, and lamentations for the dead. This\nauthority explains that in these contexts men do not derive pleasure\nfrom the woman’s voice. [...]</p>\n<p><strong>Accordingly, the question of whether the Kol Isha prohibition applies to Zemirot\nremains unresolved.

    "content": "# Parshas Yisro - Asking Moshe Rabbeinu directly: who got to listen?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Early in Parshas Yisro, Yisro noticed that Moshe was answering questions all day long. He <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">asked</a> Moshe about it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּרְא֙ חֹתֵ֣ן מֹשֶׁ֔ה אֵ֛ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא עֹשֶׂ֖ה לָעָ֑ם\nוַיֹּ֗אמֶר מָֽה־הַדָּבָ֤ר הַזֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתָּ֤ה עֹשֶׂה֙ לָעָ֔ם\nמַדּ֗וּעַ אַתָּ֤ה יוֹשֵׁב֙ לְבַדֶּ֔ךָ וְכׇל־הָעָ֛ם נִצָּ֥ב עָלֶ֖יךָ\nמִן־בֹּ֥קֶר עַד־עָֽרֶב׃<br />\nBut when Moses’ father-in-law saw how much he\nhad to do for the people, he said, “What is this thing that you are\ndoing to the people? Why do you sit alone, while all the nation stand\nover you from morning until evening?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moshe explains to him,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֖ה לְחֹתְנ֑וֹ כִּֽי־יָבֹ֥א אֵלַ֛י הָעָ֖ם לִדְרֹ֥שׁ\nאֱלֹהִֽים׃\nכִּֽי־יִהְיֶ֨ה לָהֶ֤ם דָּבָר֙\nבָּ֣א אֵלַ֔י וְשָׁ֣פַטְתִּ֔י בֵּ֥ין אִ֖ישׁ וּבֵ֣ין רֵעֵ֑הוּ\nוְהוֹדַעְתִּ֛י אֶת־חֻקֵּ֥י הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים וְאֶת־תּוֹרֹתָֽיו׃<br />\nMoses replied to his father-in-law, “It is because the\npeople come to me to inquire of God.\nWhen they\nhave a dispute, it comes before me, and I decide between one party and\nanother, and I make known the laws and teachings of God.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You know the rest of the story: Yisro tells Moshe it's too difficult and tells him to set up a hierarchy instead, where most questions go to the Heads of Tens, or Hundreds, etc., and only the hardest questions go up to Moshe.</p>\n<p>My question: I realized this week that most people did not understand the <em>original</em> system the same way I did. I had understood (a) that the whole nation stood around [they had nothing better to do anyhow, since they were given mann to eat] and listened to all the questions and all the answers. Everyone was part of a <em>shimush</em> system (see related question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/139967/shimush-maros-on-niddah-why-does-it-work\">here</a>) where they learned the whole Torah from Moshe directly, and got to hear the answer to thousands of diverse questions.<br />\n(b) Many others I asked seemed to understand it differently. There was this huge line of people waiting to ask questions of Moshe, each asked his question and got his answer and went home. When you had another question you got in line again. Mostly no one heard anyone else's questions.</p>\n<p>I thought that was nuts. What a wasted opportunity for everyone else! And some questions might get asked up to 600,000 times! \"Moshe, what's the bracha on a banana? The branches are...\" \"Borei pri haadmah.\" \"Moshe, what's the bracha on a banana?\" \"Borei pri haadamah.\" \"Moshe, what's the bra-\" \"Borei pri haadamah!!\"<br />\nPlus, the verse brought above, \"<strong>all</strong> the nation stand about you from morning until evening\", I think is evidence for (a) if it's taken literally. Why would <em>all</em> the nation be there the whole time? Some of them already got their questions answered. Some perhaps didn't have a question that day.</p>\n<p>What do others think? Is there more evidence or arguments for one of the sides? Are there mefarshim who discuss this?</p>\n\n\n",

He shall be brought to the door or the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall then remain his master’s slave for life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason why the slave is pierced specifically through his ear is  explained by Rashi:</p>\n<p>Rashi Exodus 21:6</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורצע אדניו את אזנו במרצע. הַיְמָנִית, אוֹ אֵינוֹ, אֶלָּא שֶׁל שְׂמֹאל? תַּ\"לֹ אֹזֶן אֹזֶן לִגְזֵרָה שָׁוָה, נֶאֱמַר כָּאן וְרָצַע אֲדֹנָיו אֶת אָזְנוֹ, וְנֶאֱמַר בִּמְצֹרָע תְּנוּךְ אֹזֶן הַמִּטַּהֵר הַיְמָנִית (ויקרא י\"ד), מַה לְּהַלָּן הַיְמָנִית, אַף כָּאן הַיְמָנִית; וּמָה רָאָה אֹזֶן לֵרָצַע מִכָּל שְׁאָר אֵבָרִים שֶׁבַּגּוּף? אָמַר רַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי: אֹזֶן זֹאת שֶׁשָּׁמְעָה עַל הַר סִינַי לֹא תִגְנֹב, וְהָלַךְ וְגָנַב, תֵּרָצַע. וְאִם מוֹכֵר עַצְמוֹ, אֹזֶן שֶׁשָּׁמְעָה עַל הַר סִינַי כִּי לִי בְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲבָדִים, וְהָלַךְ וְקָנָה אָדוֹן לְעַצְמוֹ, תֵּרָצַע. רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן הָיָה דּוֹרֵשׁ מִקְרָא זֶה כְּמִין חֹמֶר: מַה נִּשְׁתַּנּוּ דֶּלֶת וּמְזוּזָה מִכָּל כֵּלִים שֶׁבַּבַּיִת? אָמַר הַקָּבָּ\"ה דֶּלֶת וּמְזוּזָה שֶׁהָיוּ עֵדִים בְּמִצְרַיִם כְּשֶׁפָּסַחְתִּי עַל הַמַּשְׁקוֹף וְעַל שְׁתֵּי הַמְּזוּזוֹת וְאָמַרְתִּי כִּי לִי בְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲבָדִים – עֲבָדַי הֵם וְלֹא עֲבָדִים לַעֲבָדִים – וְהָלַךְ זֶה וְקָנָה אָדוֹן לְעַצְמוֹ, יֵרָצַע בִּפְנֵיהֶם (קידושין כ\"ב):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND HIS LORD SHALL BORE HIS EAR THROUGH WITH THE AWL — “His ear” means his right ear. Or perhaps this is not so, but Scripture means his left ear? Scripture however uses the term אזן here and it uses אזן in another passage, thereby suggesting an analogy based upon verbal similarity; viz., here it is said “and his lord shall bore his ear (אזנו) through”, and of the leper it is said, (Leviticus 14:25) “and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear (אזנו הימית) of him that is to be cleansed”. — How is it in that latter passage? It is the right ear! So here, too, it is the right ear. — What is the reason that the ear had to be pierced rather than any other limb of the servant’s body? Rabban Jochanan ben Zaccai said: That ear which heard on Mount Sinai, (Exodus 20:13) “Thou shalt not steal” and yet its owner went and stole and was therefore sold as a slave — let it be pierced! Or, in the case of him who sold himself from destitution, having committed no theft, the reason is: That ear which heard on Mount Sinai what I said, (Leviticus 25:55) “For unto Me the children Israel are servants” and yet its owner went and procured for himself another master — let it be pierced! (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 21:6:3; Kiddushin 22b). Rabbi Simeon interpreted this verse like a jewel (i. e. giving it an ethical signification): In what respect are door and doorpost different from all other objects in the house that they should be singled out for this purpose? God, in effect, said: door and doorpost that were eye-witnesses in Egypt when I passed over the lintel and the two doorposts, freeing Israel from slavery, and when I said, (Leviticus 25:55) “For unto Me the children of Israel are servants” — servants to Me but not servants of servants (of human beings), and yet this man went and procured another master for himself — let him be pieced in their presence (i. e. let them be eye-witnesses now when this man voluntarily prolongs his state of slavery)! (Kiddushin 22b.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi seems to be explaining that the reason why the slave was pierced through the ear is because the same ear that herd what G-d said by Har Sinai, and yet disobeid him, should be pierced.</p>\n<p>Yet, we find by the giving of the Torah:</p>\n<p>Exodus 20:15</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכָל־הָעָם֩ רֹאִ֨ים אֶת־הַקּוֹלֹ֜ת וְאֶת־הַלַּפִּידִ֗ם וְאֵת֙ ק֣וֹל הַשֹּׁפָ֔ר וְאֶת־הָהָ֖ר עָשֵׁ֑ן וַיַּ֤רְא הָעָם֙ וַיָּנֻ֔עוּ וַיַּֽעַמְד֖וּ מֵֽרָחֹֽק׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the blare of the horn and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they fell back and stood at a distance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראים את הקולת. רוֹאִין אֶת הַנִּשְׁמָע, שֶׁאִי אֶפְשָׁר לִרְאוֹת בְּמָקוֹם אַחֵר:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[THEY] SAW THE SOUNDS — they saw that which should be heard  (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 20:15:1) — something which is impossible to see on any other occasion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Jewish people saw the giving of the Torah in a way which was never seen and can't be seen again.</p>\n<p>They also saw things which are meant to be heard!</p>\n<p>G-d wanted to punish the slave in the exact limb which disobeid him. More unique to the giving of the Torah, was the fact that the Jews saw things that weren't usually seen.</p>\n<p>So why didn't the slave get pierced in the eye?</p>\n\n\n",

If a person has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, or they are in horrific pain (as they describe it), and they have specifically asked for a bottle of sleeping pills or some other medication that can be lethal in large doses, would it be permitted to leave the pills next to the person's bedside and let them decide whether to take the pills or not?</p>\n<p>I found a podcast on the subject at \"Halacha Headlines\", hosted by Dovid Lichtenstein:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://halachaheadlines.com/episodes/self-assisted-suicide-in-halacha-and-other-contemporary-medical-shailos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Self-assisted suicide in Halacha and other contemporary medical Shailos\"</a></p>\n<p>SPEAKERS: Rabbi Yaakov Feitman, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Weiner</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It would be the same as handing a nonobservant Jew non-kosher food if you know that that person will eat it. It is not allowed and one would transgress Lifnei Iver even though you don't actually feed it to them.</p>\n<p>Quoting from <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/8169\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> article on Ohr Sameiach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah warns “do not place a stumbling block before the blind (lifnei iver).” This prohibition, according to the Rambam, applies to anyone who helps somebody to sin or who causes somebody to sin by placing the temptation before him. Rambam’s ruling is based on a Talmudic discussion which makes it clear that the Torah is not only speaking literally of blind people, but of anyone — including unsuspecting, ignorant or weak people — and forbids causing them to sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on that, if you place the sleeping pills next to the terminally ill person, who you know wants to commit suicide, is not allowed because you are placing the temptation there.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can playing sports bring us closer to God?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In what ways can sports be used as a vehicle to serve God and thus, bring us closer to Him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Maybe not directly an answer, but the Lubavitcher Rebbe would often compare sports, e.g. baseball for example, to our Avodas Hashem. In a Sicha, the Rebbe explained <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/81993/jewish/Soccer.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shabbos Parshas Shemini, 5740)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chassidic teachings explain that the desire for victory pushes us to reach much deeper within ourselves and discover our hidden potential. Just as a king in wartime empties his treasury in order to win, it is the battle with the adversary that spurs us all to find new abilities.</p>\n<p>This type of conduct is evidenced in sports, specifically in soccer,\nwhere two teams oppose each other’s efforts to score a goal. Ideally,\nthe players are not primarily motivated by the money they receive\n(although of course they must be adequately compensated for their\ntraining and effort). Rather, it is their personal desire for victory\nthat is the main motivator.</p>\n<p>As in sport, in life one cannot move sluggishly. We must keep moving\nwith vitality, running and jumping to overcome the challenge. This\ntype of service is carried out not just with the brain or heart\n(though thought and emotion are important) but with the action of the\nfeet. Only by means of putting our Jewish learning into vigorous\npractice can we hope to emerge victorious in our quest to put the\nglobe in the “Gate of the King.”</p>\n<p>In mystical thought, the ball represents how our G‑dly activities must\nencompass every aspect of our being. Aiming for the goal represents\njumping directly to the highest levels of spirituality, bypassing the\nintermediate stages which would be achieved through incremental\ngrowth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/95881/jewish/Fans-and-Players.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this fantastic story</a>, between a boy and the Rebbe, where a lesson is shared about baseball:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shimshon, born and bred in the New World, was very much the \"American Boy\". Yet he had enjoyed a close and special friendship with the Rebbe prior to the passing of the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe — the Rebbe's father-in-law Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneersohn — which continued on after the Rebbe accepted the mantel of leadership. He now introduced his friend and his friend's son to the Rebbe, who greeted them with his comforting and warm handshake, requesting them to please take a seat.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe briefly blessed the boy that he should grow to become a\nsource of pride to the Jewish people and to his family. As they turned\nto leave, Rebbe surprised the three Americans with the question he\naddressed to the youngster: \"Are you a baseball fan?\"</p>\n<p>The Bar-Mitzvah boy replied that he was.</p>\n<p>\"Which team are you a fan of — the Yankees or the Dodgers?\"</p>\n<p>The Dodgers, replied the boy.</p>\n<p>\"Does your father have the same feeling for the Dodgers as you have?\"</p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>\"Does he take you out to games?\"</p>\n<p>Well, every once in a while my father takes me to a game. We were at a\ngame a month ago.</p>\n<p>\"How was the game?\"</p>\n<p>It was disappointing, the 13-year-old confessed. By the sixth inning,\nthe Dodgers were losing nine-to-two, so we decided to leave.</p>\n<p>\"Did the players also leave the game when you left?\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi, the players can't leave in the middle of the game!</p>\n<p>\"Why not?\" asked the Rebbe. \"Explain to me how this works.\"</p>\n<p>There are players and fans, the baseball fan explained. The fans can\nleave when they like — they're not part of the game and the game\ncould, and does, continue after they leave. But the players need to\nstay and try to win until the game is over.</p>\n<p>\"That is the lesson I want to teach you in Judaism,\" said the Rebbe\nwith a smile. \"You can be either a fan or a player. Be a player.\"</p>\n<p>Outside 770 father and son said goodbye to Shimshon, the three now\nsharing a new admiration of a pioneer in Jewish education</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I've been wanting to try something new and experience something else see if it brings me joy i once had while i was very observant, i'm still very observant i daven 3 times a day (4 musaf on shabbos etc), keep shabbos etc but i'm just not happy due to always being alone and feeling alone in this lifestyle. I'm only worried that there will be consequences from HaShem if i do so. I look around and i see people enjoying life and trying new things and always having people to learn and vibe from and get along with, and i feel i'm always alone and just miserable just observing torah because its what is expected of me. I don't hate HaShem or his torah or Am Yisroel, but i feel a void and emptiness in me that's depriving me of joy and not fixing my loneliness in this path. I have not that amount of money to pay for online classes or tend yeshiva etc either so im basically alone in my living situation and stuck in this lifestyle i feel, just doomed to observing and learning torah all by myself.</p>\n\n\n",

Machamaddim מחמדים is its plural.

That's like saying \"men\" is not related to \"man\"</p>\n<p>It is intensive plural to make its meaning stronger, i.e. “very lovely”. We see another example of that in the same verse: chikko mamtaqqim (his mouth is most sweet). Chikko is singular, but mamtaqqim is plural, meaning “very sweet”. Another example of intensive plural:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואהיה אצלו אמון ואהיה <strong>שעשעים</strong> יום יום משחקת לפניו בכל עת</p>\n<p>Waehyeh etslo amon waehyeh <strong>shaashuim</strong> yom yom mesacheket lefanav bechol et</p>\n<p>Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his <strong>delight</strong>, rejoicing always before him;\nProverbs 8:30</p>\n<p>לא יתנני השב רוחי כי ישבעני <strong>ממררים</strong></p>\n<p>Lo yitteneni hashev ruchi ki yasbiani <strong>mammerorim</strong></p>\n<p>He will not allow me to catch my breath, But fills me with <strong>bitterness</strong>\nJob 9:18</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Significance of 'ten thousand' (5:10 what does '...chiefest among ten thousand...')?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Majority of translations don't use the word \"chiefest\", but \"better\" or \"outstanding\". The word Rebabah רבבה is often used for a very large number. 10,000 is אשר אלפים</p>\n<p>The context implies that it is not a name. The verse says “wechullo machamaddim”. “We” means “and”. “Chull” means “all”, “whole”, “every” and “o” means “of him”, like in “chikko” (his mouth, chik - mouth, o - of him, his). So “wechullo” means “and all of him is”, not \"and he is”. All its translations are like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is <strong>altogether</strong> lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem (King James Version)</p>\n<p>His mouth is sweetness, and <strong>all of him</strong> is desirable.

This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem (New Revised Standart Version)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saying “all of him is Muhammad\", \"he is altogether Muhammad\" isn't that correct. If there is a person who is wholly Muhammad, so there can be also people who are a little bit Muhammad, half Muhammad, mostly Muhammad etc. As a name it doesn't fit into this. “He is altogether lovely\" or \"all of him is desirable\" makes more sense.

    "content": "# Does Ramban believe mitzvos are for our benefit or for God's?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Ramban has a piece on <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Ramban/Devarim/22.6#m4e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 22:6</a> where he explains at length that it is only humans that benefit from mitzvos but certainly not God.</p>\n<p>E.g.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל אלו ההגדות אשר נתקשו על הרב כפי דעתי ענין אחר להם, שרצו לומר שאין התועלת במצות להקב\"ה בעצמו ית', אבל התועלת באדם עצמו, למנוע ממנו נזק, או אמונה רעה, או מדה מגונה, או לזכור הנסים ונפלאות הבורא יתברך, לדעת את י\"י.</p>\n<p>The benefit from the commandments is not derived by the Holy One Himself, exalted be He. Rather, the advantage is to man himself, to withhold from him physical harm or some evil belief, or unseemly trait of character, or to recall the miracles and wonders of the Creator, blessed be He, in order to know the Eternal.</p>\n<p>הנה מפורש בכאן שבאו לומר שאין התועלת אליו ית' שיצטרך לאורה כמחושב מן המנורה, ושיצטרך למאכל הקרבנות וריח הקטורת, כנראה מפשוטיהם, ואפילו הזכר לנפלאותיו שצוה לעשות לזכר ליציאת מצרים ומעשה בראשית אין התועלת לו, רק שנדע אנחנו האמת ונזכה בו עד שנהיה ראויים להיותו מגין עלינו. כי כבודנו וספורנו בתהלותיו מאפס ותוהו נחשבו לו.</p>\n<p>Thus it is clearly stated here that the Rabbis [in this Midrash], meant to say merely that the benefit [accruing from observance of the commandments] is not for His sake exalted be He, [nor] that He is in need of the light of the candelabrum as one might think, or that He needs the food of the offerings and the odor of the incense as might appear from their simple meanings. Even regarding the memorial He hath made for His wonderful works, that He commanded us to perform in memory of the Exodus and Creation, the benefit is not for Him, but so, that we should know the truth and be meritorious enough to be worthy that He protects us, for our utterances and remembrances of His wonders are accounted by Him as things of nought, and vanity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand when commenting on <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Ramban/Shemot/29.46#m4e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 29:46</a> he seems to indicate that God does indeed satisfy a need via our mitzvah observance (see R Bechaye there who elaborates on this idea and spells it out more explicitly)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל ר' אברהם אמר כי לא הוצאתי אותם מארץ מצרים רק בעבור שאשכון בתוכם, וזהו: תעבדון את האלהים על ההר הזה (שמות ג':י\"ב). ויפה פירש.\nואם כן יש בענין סוד גדול, כי כפי פשט הדבר, השכינה בישראל צרך הדיוט, לא צורך גבוה, אבל הוא כענין שאמר הכתוב: ישראל אשר בך אתפאר (ישעיהו מ\"ט:ג'), ואמר יהושע: ומה תעשה לשמך הגדול (יהושע ז':ט'), ופסוקים רבים באו כן: אוה למושב לו (תהלים קל\"ב:י\"ג), פה אשב כי אויתיה (תהלים קל\"ב:י\"ד), וכתוב: והארץ אזכור (ויקרא כ\"ו:מ\"ב).</p>\n<p>But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained [the verse to mean that] the purpose of My bringing them forth from the land of Egypt was only that I might dwell in their midst, and that this was the fulfilment of [the promise to Moses], you shall serve G-d upon this mountain (Shemot 3:12). He explained it well, and if it is so, there is in this matter a great secret. For in the plain sense of things it would appear that [the dwelling of] the Divine Glory in Israel was to fulfill a want below, but it is not so. It fulfilled a want above, being rather similar in thought to that which Scripture states, Israel, in whom I will be glorified. And Joshua said, [For when the Canaanites… hear of it… and cut off our name from the earth,] and what wilt Thou do for Thy Great Name? There are many verses which express this thought: He hath desired it [i.e., Zion] for His habitation; Here I dwell; for I have desired it. And it is further written, and I will remember the land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does Ramban really hold?</p>\n<p>(The former seems to be in the realm of nigleh [peshat] with the latter nistar [sod] however ostensibly they need to cohere)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's an explanation of a resolution in the first 4 sections of לא תהי׳ משכלה תשי״ב, which is rather inaccessible for here, so I will try to summarise, and add background and explanation as I've studied the topic, and caution that this is still not sufficient, and encourage those interested to pursue the sources. The (powerful) question asked is actually a question that has been worked on by the Philosophers and Kabbalists, and developed right up until this ma'amar.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In the Moreh Nevuchim I, we learn about the philosophy of <strong>essence</strong>, which we are told is not composite, and cannot have anything superadded<sup>1</sup>. He cautions us that Hashem is His Essence (i.e. Himself) and nothing more, and therefore all descriptions in Torah of Him need to be dealt with <em>properly</em>. They are not descriptions of a composite being, but are all Hashem's <strong>actions and expression</strong>. He talks us through at length how actions <em>can</em> be achieved by Essence<sup>2</sup>, and do not imply composition in Hashem.</p>\n<p>The ma'amar explains that when it comes to His actions and expression, the truth is that Hashem needs us to do the mitzvot. This is the <em>pashut pshat</em> of the Torah - that it is essential to Him that we do the mitzvot, i.e. <em>serve</em> Him<sup>3,7</sup>.</p>\n<p>When it comes to His Essence, we know from the philosophy of essence that essence doesn't need, in that sense of limitation. As the Zohar puts it, Hashem doesn't need a faculty called wisdom to be called Wise<sup>4</sup>; act wisely. It also says in many places that He doesn't need our mitzvot, they were given for our benefit etc. As the Ramban states in your first quote, Hashem Himself doesn't need the light of the menorah, it is for the sake of our refinement. This is true.</p>\n<p>So is this a contradiction? Are we saying that Hashem 'merely' <em>acts</em> in a way that He needs the mitzvot (OP's second quote), but <em>truly</em> doesn't (first quote)? This is the core of the question that's been tackled over the history<sup>5</sup>. The trajectory has been towards rejecting this, and gradually explain that the <em>truth</em> is indeed that our Divine service is <em>nogeah</em> to Him, Himself.</p>\n<p>While He may not need light, what is <em>nogeah</em> to Himself - עצמות ומהות א\"ס ב\"ה - is that <em>we be refined</em>. The Rebbe arrives at this explanation - having naturally gone with all the build up that came before him - founded on a principle <strong>brought from the Ramban's introduction to his perush on Chumash</strong>, that the Torah was written in third person, as a narration, rather than from the voice of Moshe or Hashem. The Rebbe explains the Narrator is Hashem Himself, in essence (the whole ma'amar is based around spotting a switch where the Narrator speaks in first person).</p>\n<p>The Ramban in your second quote alludes to what's going on. Hashem Himself's true desire is to dwell with us, and this is for His Glory. Therefore, He gave us His precious mitzvot, so we can emulate Him, and be refined, and this is in service of His true desire, and <em>nogeah b'Atzmus</em>; <em>we</em> are <em>nogeah b'Atzmus</em><sup>6</sup>. Therefore everything we do refines us and is a true service to Him<sup>7</sup>. We note that His actions reflect this (are authentic) - as we showed above, the <em>pashut pshat</em> of the Torah is that it is absolutely essential and non-negotiable to Him that we do the mitzvot.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: the Rebbe explains a resolution, that would work with Ramban, that the mitzvot refine us, so of course it is for us and our refinement and not His. However, our refinement through the mitzvot, which are essential to Him<sup>7</sup>, is Hashem's true desire. Therefore it is for Him - no contradition.</p>\n<p>Rambam brings the following in the Moreh (3:13), for a little more insight into the depth of this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״כל פעל יי למענהו״ אפשר שיהיה זה הכינוי שב אל הפעול; ואם יהיה שב אל\nהפועל יהיה פרושו למען עצמו ית׳ – רצונו לומר: <strong>רצונו שהוא עצמו</strong> כמו\nשהתבאר בזה המאמר. וכבר בארנו, <strong>שעצמו ית׳ יקרא גם כן ׳כבודו׳</strong> באמרו:\n״הראני נא את כבודך״ – הנה יהיה גם כן אמרו: ׳כל פעל יי למענהו׳ כאמרו:\n״כל הנקרא בשמי ולכבודי בראתיו יצרתיו אף עשיתיו״ – יאמר כל מה שיוחס לי\nפעולתו אמנם עשיתיו למען רצוני לא זולת זה</p>\n<p>\"The Lord hath made everything (la-ma'anehu) for its purpose\" (Prov.\n16:4). It is possible that the pronoun in la-maanehu refers to the\nobject; but it can also be considered as agreeing with the subject; in\nwhich case the meaning of the word is, for the sake of Himself, or\n<strong>His will which is identical with His self</strong> [or essence], as has been shown in this treatise. We have also pointed out that <strong>His\nessence is also called His glory</strong>. The words, \"The Lord hath made\neverything for Himself\", express therefore the same idea as the\nfollowing verse, \"Everything that is called by My name: I have created\nit for My Glory, I have formed it; yea, I have made it\" (Isa. 43:7);\nthat is to say, everything that is described as My work has been made\nby Me for the sake of My will and for no other purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1. 51-52</sup></p>\n<p><sup>2. 54, 57. However, it is best to learn all of I (and similar studies in Chovot Halevavot Shaar Yichud 10 etc. and how it has been absorbed by Kabbalah, e.g. Pardes Rimonim, and Chassidut, e.g. Tanya Sha'ar HaYichud VeHa'emunah), bearing in mind that much is very advanced.

For example, one political news outlet might give bad news about a certain democratic politician, while another political news outlet might give bad news about a Republican politician. Am I liable for listening to this kind of news? And let's assume that the intention of said news outlet is to spread gossip in order to influence how people might vote for that politician come election day.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Every monster, harasser, molester, and abuser is suddenly a [self-professed] expert on the laws of Lashon Hara. They don't want anyone to find out about\nthem.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Noted <em>posek</em> Rabbi Dovid Cohen shlit\"a of the Gvul Yaavetz synagogue of Brooklyn. I heard it in a talk from him c. 2009.)</p>\n<p>The classic work on Lashon Hara, <em>Sefer Chafetz Chaim</em>, spends a lot of time on cases where it may be allowed, appropriate, and even necessary to speak (or listen to) detrimental reports, where there is a clear, practical needed outcome (<em>to'eles</em>); there are conditions in place, such as taking rumors with a grain of salt, not reacting disproportionately, and the like. He also adds that if there are unsubstantiated rumors, those should be presented as such if necessary for someone's protection. \"Hey I've heard rumors that you may not want to leave Mr. Smith alone with lots of cash.\" Then Mr. Smith's employer can decide whether to investigate, and/or to act in a defensive manner, e.g. rethinking his store's cash-handling policy. The employer does not have to (nor should not) believe for certain that Smith is guilty, nor do anything disproportionate, such as suddenly firing Smith.</p>\n<p>Basically, you take the instance of reporting concerns to an employer, and in our case, the public is the employer vis-a-vis public officials.</p>\n<p>Democracy only works if the electorate is well-informed on relevant issues. To quote a recorded lecture from Rabbi Yitzchak Breitowitz, it is kosher to be an investigative journalist if you are uncovering things like a mayor spending taxpayer money on a shoddy construction company because of bribes, when clearly there was a better option in the public interest. The public deserves to know that in order to decide whether to vote for that politician again, work to legally expel them from office, and/or for law enforcement to open an investigation. (All of which are reasonable and proportionate.)

It is permissible to read or watch them even though one is hearing evil gossip and tale bearing because these things are already publicized and have become common knowledge. Nevertheless, it is not fitting for this to be a person's main interest and attention. It is only if the person saw or heard this by chance and he did not go delving into the matter that there is no transgression involved. It is not even forbidden to tell others about gossip that was publicized through the media, but it is a bad trait to feel good about or benefited from the failures and shortcomings of other people. Such a trait is unfitting for an upright person. However, it is forbidden to receive a subscription to a media publication if it's main business is evil gossip and tale bearing. Furthermore, these types of publications should not be supported. If the publication's main business is not evil gossip or tale bearing but it includes these types of reports as interspersed minor additions, it is permitted for one to support and subscribe to such media. Nevertheless, one should protest the wrongdoing they commit by publicizing evil gossip.  It is explained in part one Chapter four that whoever can safely protest a sinful policy and urge that it be eliminated is obligated to do so in order to improve the opinions of others and to improve the world.\" Source: The Divine Code 2nd Ed, Rabbi Moshe Weiner, pg. 458-459.</p>\n\n\n",

(Chinuch Mitzvah 95).\nThis Mitzvah includes the Mishkan (Tabernacle) that Moses made in the desert. It also includes the Bais Hamikdash (Temple) in Jerusalem. Before (the Temple in) Jerusalem was built, there were others i.e., the Tabernacle in Shiloh and the Tabernacles in Nob and Gibeon. (Minchas Chinuch ibid) (Note: The Minchas Chinuch does not mention here the Second Bais Hamikdash which, is certainly included in this Mitzvah.)</p>\n<p>The Rambam elaborates: \"As soon as they (the Children of Israel) entered the land (of Israel) they erected the Mishkan in Gilgal which stood for 14 years while they conquered and divided (Israel). From there they came to Shiloh, and there they built a Tabernacle of stones, and they spread the curtains of Mishkan upon it, for it had no roof. For 368 years Mishkan Shiloh stood; when Eli died, it was destroyed. They came to Nob, and there they built a (Mikdash) Tabernacle; when Samuel died it was destroyed. And they came to Gibeon and there they built a Tabernacle. And from Gibeon they came to 'Bais Olamim' (building the First Bais Hamikdash, transferring the 'Kailim' from the Tabernacle at Gibeon). The duration (of the Tabernacles) at Nob and Gibeon was 57 years (13 years at Nob, 44 years at Gibeon).\" (Mishneh Torah Avodah 1:2 Hilchos Bais HaBechirah)</p>\n<p>Thus, this Mitzvah was fulfilled only 6 times since creation: 1. The Mishkan in the Midbar; 2. Shiloh; 3. Nob; 4. Gibeon; 5. First Bais Hamikdash; 6. Second Bais Hamikdash.</p>\n<p>My question is why is Gilgal not included in this calculation? If so, that would make this 7 times and not six. A follow-up question would be, \"In practice, how is this mitzvah actually fulfilled?\" Does it require the Aron? The Altar etc...New stones or walls?</p>\n\n\n",

One can rally many more sources as seen below that affirm that particular divine providence does not extend to animals, rather they are subject to general providence (nature). The reason for this conclusion seems to fall primarily into two general categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Hashgaha emerges where the intellect is developed (acquired). The\ngreater the intellectual perfection, the greater the hashgaha.\nAnimals, thought to be incapable of intellectual perfection, remain\nwithout such direct hashgaha.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The idea that God’s providence\nextends over a particular organism does not square with a license to\nfreely use animals to satisfy our appetites and whims. This is set\nup as a sort of binary. If particular providence extends to animals,\nthen no animal would be permitted to slaughter, maim, etc. in\nsatisfaction of human want/need. We know that such is permitted (to\nthe exclusion of wanton infliction of pain) therefore providence\ndoes not extend to animals.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is a generalization intended to roughly approximate the collective view, there are of course nuanced differences (and/or additional reasons) between the sources which reflect the unique thought of each figure.

So the original divine plan was that zero individual animals would be eaten, by man or by another animal.</p>\n<p>Genesis 1:29-30</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God said, “See, I give you every seed-bearing plant that is upon all\nthe earth, and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit; they shall be\nyours for food.  And to all the animals on land, to all the birds of\nthe sky, and to everything that creeps on earth, in which there is the\nbreath of life, [I give] all the green plants for food.” And it was\nso.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Albo says the background of Kain and Able has to do with these laws of vegetarianism. According to Albo, Kain brought vegetable offerings to be in line with God's command. Abel brought a strange/prohibited offering that required the killing of an animal, and so Kain thought Abel was guilty of a capital crime and felt justified in killing Abel.</p>\n<p>This helps explain why God doesn't kill Kain for the murder of his brother, which is what we would all have expected to happen. Kain ends up being spared by God, because from my read of scripture Abel had bloodguilt on his hands despite his animal sacrifice being accepted. In much the same way that David was still beloved by God, but David was still not allowed to build the temple because of all the blood on his hands.</p>\n<p>When God decided to flood the Earth we don't often highlight how He was apparently okay with mankind dying out as long as the animals survived. Scripture makes it clear that Noah is being spared due to his righteousness, but the animals God wanted to repopulate the Earth.</p>\n<p>Genesis Chapter 7</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א  וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה לְנֹחַ, בֹּא-אַתָּה וְכָל-בֵּיתְךָ אֶל-הַתֵּבָה:\nכִּי-אֹתְךָ רָאִיתִי צַדִּיק לְפָנַי, בַּדּוֹר הַזֶּה.    1 And the LORD\nsaid unto Noah: 'Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee\nhave I seen righteous before Me in this generation. ב  מִכֹּל\nהַבְּהֵמָה הַטְּהוֹרָה, תִּקַּח-לְךָ שִׁבְעָה שִׁבְעָה--אִישׁ\nוְאִשְׁתּוֹ; וּמִן-הַבְּהֵמָה אֲשֶׁר לֹא טְהֹרָה הִוא, שְׁנַיִם--אִישׁ\nוְאִשְׁתּוֹ.  2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and\nseven, each with his mate; and of the beasts that are not clean two\n[and two], each with his mate; ג  גַּם מֵעוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם שִׁבְעָה\nשִׁבְעָה, זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה, לְחַיּוֹת זֶרַע, עַל-פְּנֵי כָל-הָאָרֶץ.   3\nof the fowl also of the air, seven and seven, male and female; to keep\nseed alive upon the face of all the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God only allowed the eating of animals after nearly wiping out all of mankind in the flood. And even then there are lots of limitations. For example we learn that other than eating an animal, mankind only has the right to kill an animal if that animal has killed a human.</p>\n<p>Genesis 9</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fertile and\nincrease, and fill the earth.  The fear and the dread of you shall be\nupon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the birds of the\nsky—everything with which the earth is astir—and upon all the fish of\nthe sea; they are given into your hand.  Every creature that lives\nshall be yours to eat; as with the green grasses, I give you all\nthese.  You must not, however, eat flesh with its life-blood in it.\nBut for your own life-blood I will require a reckoning: I will require\nit of every beast; of humankind, too, will I require a reckoning for\nhuman life, of everyone for each other! Whoever sheds human blood, By\nhuman [hands] shall that one’s blood be shed; For in the image of God\nWas humankind made.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And even with the Children of Israel He commanded them in Leviticus that anything they wanted to eat needed to be a sacrifice on the altar, or else they would be held liable for bloodguilt.</p>\n<p>Leviticus 17</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יהוה spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all\nthe Israelite people and say to them: This is what יהוה has commanded:\nif anyone of the house of Israel slaughters an ox or sheep or goat in\nthe camp, or does so outside the camp,  and does not bring it to the\nentrance of the Tent of Meeting to present it as an offering to יהוה,\nbefore יהוה’s Tabernacle, bloodguilt shall be imputed to that party:\nhaving shed blood, that person shall be cut off from among this\npeople.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So while we were in the desert if someone were to just properly slaughter an animal for dinner to feed his starving family, he would incur bloodguilt. How bad is bloodguilt? According to the <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/bloodguilt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Virtual Library</a>, the following categories of sin incur bloodguilt: <strong>Deliberate Homicide, Accidental Homicide, Homicidal Beast, Unlawful Slaughtering of an Animal.</strong> The punishment of bloodguilt is death by heaven.</p>\n<p>Based on all the above, I'd say the killing of animals ranks really high on God's priority list. It's usually in the same category as killing humans, who we all agree God cares for individually. The more I reread Tanakh and actually sit and contemplate these odd verses about animals, the more vegetarian I end up. Based on my read of the Bible, all meat should be treated with the same care and strictness that many modern Jews treat Kashrut during Pesach.</p>\n\n\n",

It falls under the general prohibitions enumerated in Chapter 18 of VaYikra.</p>\n<p>Some of the most germane posukim are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>You shall not copy the practices of the land of Egypt where you dwelt, or of the land of Canaan</strong></em> to which I am taking you; <em><strong>nor shall you follow their laws</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>None of you men <em><strong>shall come near</strong></em> anyone of his own flesh to uncover nakedness: I am יהוה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Coming near includes even with words, texts, or any other type of electronic communication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Do not allow any of your offspring to be offered up</strong></em> to Molech, and do not profane the name of your God: I am יהוה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Among other things, <strong>\"offering your offspring to Molech\"</strong> means <em>any type of activity which encourages and stimulates sexual arousal</em> which will <em><strong>potentially result</strong></em> in wasting of seed <em>solely for the purpose of sexual gratification</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Do not defile yourselves in any of those ways</strong></em>, for it is by such that the nations that I am casting out before you defiled themselves.</p>\n<p>But you must keep My laws and My rules, and <em><strong>you must not do any of those abhorrent things</strong></em>, neither the citizen nor the stranger who resides among you;\n<em><strong>for all those abhorrent things were done by the people who were in the land before you</strong></em>, and the land became defiled.</p>\n<p><em><strong>All who do any of those abhorrent things—such persons shall be cut off from their people.</strong></em>\nYou shall <em><strong>keep My charge not to engage in any of the abhorrent practices</strong></em> that were carried on before you, and you shall not defile yourselves through them: I יהוה am your God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of these types of behavior are referred to as <em>Abhorrent</em> תועבה.</p>\n<p>Like the last sentence quoted above, <em><strong>all who do any of these things shall be cut off</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong>נכרתו הנפשות העשת מקרב עמם</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding the much broader subject of: What are the Tikkunim for this?

This is detailed by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Breiter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Yitzchok Breiter hy\"d</a>, a pre-war Breslover mashpia. In the compilation of his works She'eris Yitzchok, in the section Chalukei Hanachal, Amud Hatzadik 7:15, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התחדשות האמת היתה חמש פעמים בעולם ואלו הן: משה רבינו, רבי שמעון בר יוחאי, רבי יצחק לוריא, רבי ישראל בעש\"ט, והנחל נובע מקור חכמה , וממנו ועד משיח לא יהיו חדשות.</p>\n<p>Renewal of truth happened five times in the history of the world and these are them: Moshe Rabbeinu, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, the Arizal, the Baal Shem Tov, and Rebbe Nachman. And from him until Moshiach there won't be any renewals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later in 7:20, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...חידוש כמו הנחל נובע מקור חכמה עוד לא היה בעולם כי הוא הכין כלים למשיח צדקנו והמשיח ילחום בהם לתקן העולם אכי\"ר.</p>\n<p>...There has never been a chiddush like Rebbe Nachman in the world because he prepared tools for Moshiach, and Moshiach will fight with those tools to correct the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rebbe Nachman himself declared similarly about himself, as Reb Noson miBreslov recorded in Chayei Moharan 247:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חידוש כמוני לא היה מעולם</p>\n<p>There had never been a chiddush like me in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later in Chayei Moharan 306, Rebbe Nachman says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האש שלי תוקד עד שיבוא משיח</p>\n<p>My fire will burn until Moshiach comes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea of connecting to the tzaddik exists throughout the sifrei Breslov, with far too many references to put here. The idea that Rebbe Nachman is the tzaddik emes who connects us to Hashem in his own unique way until Moshiach comes thus obviates the need for a new Rebbe; in fact, the concept doesn't even make sense in that context.</p>\n<p>A more thorough (and contemporary) treatment of this concept can be found in the book <a href=\"https://books.breslov.org/product/crossing-the-narrow-bridge/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Crossing the Narrow Bridge</a>, published by <a href=\"https://breslov.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breslov Reseach Institute</a>. After a 40-page discussion of the concept of the tzaddik more broadly, it says there (page 354 - note: any reference to <em>Tzaddik</em> is to <a href=\"https://books.breslov.org/product/tzaddik-a-portrait-of-rebbe-nachman/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BRI's translation</a> of Chayei Moharan):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rebbe Nachman said: Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai was a unique figure, as everyone knows. From the time of Rabbi Shimon (2nd century) until the time of the Ari (1534-1572), the world was quiet. (In other words, there were no new revelations of Torah comparable to those of Rabbi Shimon.) Then the Ari came and revealed entirely new and original teaches. From the time of the Ari until the time of the Baal Shem Tov (1700-1760), the world was again quiet. Then the Baal Shem Tov, a totally unique figure, came and revealed completely new teachings. Then once again from the Baal Shem Tov until the present, the world has again been quiet. But now I am beginning to reveal awesome and exalted teachings, teachings which are entirely new and original <em>(Tzaddik</em> #279)._ The Rebbe added: And from myself until Machiach, there will be no more original figures <em>(Rabbi Eliyahu Chaim Rosen)</em>.<br/>In the mind of every Breslover Chassid, Rebbe Nachman is truly the Tzaddik, not only of his generation - but until Mashiach comes.<br/>\n...<br/>\nAs to why Breslov Chassidut (after the Rebbe's passing) has always had several leaders and not any single one - why has there never been another Rebbe?! - we return to what we said earlier about the Master of Prayer [a reference to one of <a href=\"https://books.breslov.org/product/rebbe-nachmans-stories/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rebbe Nachman's stories</a>]: he was able to appear differently to each individual. In today's world, Breslovers come from and live in all walks of life. Rebbe Nachman could sit with the great Tzaddikim and Torah scholars of his generation, the followers of the Magid of Mezritch and the leading rabbinical authorities; he could sit with Reb Noson and Reb Naftali and others of his inner circle; he could sit with the simple folk who came for advice and blessings; and he could sit and match wits with leading aristocrats, including the leaders of the Haskalah movement in the Ukraine. Today no single personality could span such a spectrum as Rebbe Nachman did. Thus, whoever joins Rebbe Nachman's following, no matter what his family background or level (or lack) of religious education, always has someone whom he can relate to and from who he can receive - i.e. the Rebbe himself. <br/>\n... <br/>\nRebbe Nachman once spoke about the achievements of the Baal Shem Tov and other Tzaddikim. He said: They succeeded in improving the world. But after they passed away, the effects of their work did not endure. I wish my \"thing\" to continue. That is, my followers should make additional followers; those followers should make other followers... <em>(Tzaddik #373)</em>.<br/>The truth which the Baal Shem Tov came to reveal to the world has to a large extent lost its effect, because it was changed from its original form. Notice that Rebbe Nachman said to \"make followers...\" - followers not leaders. The great Tzaddikim know their awesome levels and what can be accomplished if their teachings are followed properly. But when the followers make amendments and try to fit the \"Rebbe\" into their own ideas and perspectives, then the effect of the original teaching becomes distoreted and cannot accomplish tits original intention. In this, Breslover Chassidut differs greatly from other chassidic groups. They have never changed, nor distorted, the teachings of Rebbe Nachman. There are no leaders in Breslov - just followers of the Rebbe <em>(Rabbi Nachman Burstein)</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A new leader wasn't chosen because Rebbe Nachman remained the leader after his passing. The Zohar says a Tzaddik is more present in this world after he passes away than when he was alive, and that is through his students (see Likutei Moharan Vol 2, Torah 7). In Rebbe Nachman's case, it was primarily through his main disciple, Rabbi Nosson of Breslov. Rabbi Nosson also had disciples, and the chain continues to this day.</p>\n\n\n",

In all such cases, he is liable and is considered as a robber. With regard to Jews, the law is different\".</em></p>\n<p>However, I did not understand whether Rambam considers rape to be the same as kidnapping, and therefore considers it a case of Noahide prohibition against theft.</p>\n<p>In the following halacha n. 14, Rambam states:</p>\n<p><em>\"How must the Noahides fulfill the commandment to establish laws and courts? They are obligated to set up judges and magistrates in every major city to render judgment concerning these six mitzvot and to admonish the people regarding their observance.\nA Noahide who transgresses these seven commands shall be executed by decapitation. For this reason, all the inhabitants of Shechem were obligated to die. Shechem kidnapped. They observed and were aware of his deeds, but did not judge him.\"</em></p>\n<p>Here is cited the famous case of the kidnapping of Dinah, who was also raped, but Rambam states laconically that \"Shechem kidnapped\", so it would seem that he detects the violation of the Noahide Law, in this event, to kidnapping tout court, and not to Dinah's subsequent rape.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Ramban writes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.34.13?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 34:13</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צוה אותם בדיני גנבה ואונאה ועושק ושכר שכיר ודיני השומרים ואונס ומפתה ואבות נזיקין וחובל בחבירו ודיני מלוה ולוה ודיני מקח וממכר וכיוצא בהן כענין הדינין שנצטוו ישראל ונהרג עליהן אם גנב ועשק או אנס ופתה בתו של חבירו או שהדליק גדישו וחבל בו וכיוצא בהן</p>\n<p>[G-d] commanded [the non-Jews] regarding the laws of theft, price fraud, withholding payment, failing to pay a hired worker, the laws of bailees, rape or seduction, the primary categories of damages, injuring another, the laws of buying and selling, and other areas of civil law in which Jews are commanded. [A non-Jew] would be executed if he stole, withheld payment, raped or seduced someone else's daughter, burned his grain heap, injured him, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, the context there is that the Rambam defines the Noachide law of \"dinim\" to mean the setting up of courts of justice, while the Ramban differs and says, as above, that it includes pretty much all of Jewish civil law. The Ramban, then, is clearly saying that rape (and seduction, for that matter) is prohibited to Noachides; whether the Rambam would agree needs further investigation.</p>\n\n\n",

Here is my loose translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One time the Bach fed lung as a meal to the Taz instead of meat. The Taz proceeded to summon the Bach to a rabbinical tribunal. And the Taz had grounds to do so - after all, lung is part of the intestines and is not fit to be called meat. The tribunal adjudicated the matter in favor of the Bach - lung = meat. The Chazon Ish explains that on the day that the Taz ate the lung he lacked his normal daily strength and studied torah for less minutes. A heavenly claim was thus lodged against the Bach for causing all of this. The Taz knew of this divine claim and wanted to expunge it. He therefore summoned the Bach to the tribunal in order to have the court arrive at the conclusion that the Bach was right - lung is meat - this would cancel the divine decree because heaven follows the decrees of earthy courts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But if the Taz already knew the earthly outcome - lung = meat, why did heaven initially take another position?</p>\n<p>The key must lie in the words ונימוקו עמו - and his basis/argument was with him (the Taz had grounds to bring this claim).</p>\n<p>There must have been this prima facie assumption that lung was not meat ... this assumption caused the kitrug, was in error, the Taz knew it was in error, and thus he became the catalyst to have a correct ruling be issued to exonerate the Bach.

I understand that Kosher salt is salt used for properly preparing Kosher meat, not that the salt itself is Kosher, what I don't understand is why we can't have a coarse Kosher salt that is also iodized. Does iodizing salt somehow prevent it from remaining coarse? Is potassium iodate somehow not Kosher?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For normal usage, salt is considered Kosher without any special certification whether plain or iodized, table salt or coarse salt. However, there are concerns with iodized salt for <em>Passover</em>. The general idea of using iodized salt is that through common usage (salt added during cooking, baking and use at the table) the average person will get enough iodine to make sure that they are not iodine-deficient. Kosher salt is a little different in a few ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is generally less popular for ordinary use, so \"simple solution to common nutritional problem\" doesn't work as well.</li>\n<li>It does not measure the same by volume as regular table salt, so it does not substitute easily in ordinary home cooking and baking (factory-scale cooking and baking is more commonly done by weight) and the texture of  the salt is largely irrelevant in cooking and baking anyway.</li>\n<li>The source of iodine is a concern for Passover use. Rather than have to source iodine, possibly at a higher cost, that is guaranteed Kosher for Passover, it is simpler, and likely cheaper, to skip the iodine.</li>\n<li>While many people do use kosher salt for the difference in texture in recipes where it doesn't dissolve before eating, the primary reason for its existence is for koshering meat. (It is now used for other purposes as well, but the name comes from the original use.) Meat is very important for Passover. At the factory level (or even your local Kosher butcher) meat is often prepared, including Kashering, year-round to be Kosher for Passover.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The end result is that <em>most</em> people who use Kosher salt (whether for Kashering meat or other reasons) will still get enough other salt in their diet to provide iodine, except for Passover. And avoiding the problem for Kashering meat for Passover where it really matters is enough of a reason to not bother with the iodine in Kosher salt year-round.</p>\n\n\n",

The remainder of the people eating wash one after another. Honor is not paid to anyone with regard to [the order of washing], because honor is not extended with regard to dirty hands, crossing bridges, or on the roads, with the exception of an entrance that is fit to have a mezuzah, and even then only with regard to entering.\"</p>\n<p><strong>In Shulchan Aruch O.C.

However, if there are more than five diners the least important of the diners should be the first to wash his hands. The other diners should then wash after him in the order in which they are sitting  <strong>without honouring one another to wash earlier</strong>, until the turn of the last five diners is reached. Once there are no more than five diners left who have not yet washed , they should then begin from the person who says the blessings for all of them.</p>\n<p>So seemingly based on this, one doesn't give honour with regards to Mayim Achronim (and the Shulchan Aruch sets out the order that should be followed).</p>\n<p>With regards to the question, \"what if you finish eating before them, do you have to wait for them or no?\" Presumably one is having a <em>zimun</em>, if that's the case, one would need to wait for them so they can answer.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason for mentioning Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar [when it mentioned already “and his sons”] is that Moses should not think that by anointing the father to minister as priest, his sons would automatically become priests; instead he had to initiate them personally into the priesthood. Thus Phinehas [the son of Eleazar] and others already born were excluded [from the priesthood], for only these four sons who were anointed with Aaron, and their children born to them henceforth, were appointed as priests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pinchas doesn't become a Kohen until he is rewarded for slaying Zimri (Rashi on Bamidbar 25:13)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A COVENANT OF AN EVERLASTING PRIESTHOOD — for although the priesthood had already been given to Aaron’s descendants (cf. Exodus 28:40-41), it was given only to Aaron and his sons who had been anointed together with him and to their offspring whom they might beget after they had been anointed. But Phineas who had been born prior to that and had not been anointed, had not as yet attained the status of priesthood until now. So, too, do we read in Zevachim 101b: Phineas did not become a priest until he had slain Zimri.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why wasn't Pinchas (or any other living grandsons) included in the inauguration with Aaron and his sons?

    "content": "# Miluim- Blood from the mizbeach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The miluim sacrifices (Parshas Tetzaveh, Parshas Tzav) have a number of features that are unique. One of the most remarkable to me is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.29.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 29:21</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלָקַחְתָּ֞ מִן־הַדָּ֨ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר עַֽל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֘חַ֮ וּמִשֶּׁ֣מֶן\nהַמִּשְׁחָה֒ וְהִזֵּיתָ֤ עַֽל־אַהֲרֹן֙ וְעַל־בְּגָדָ֔יו וְעַל־בָּנָ֛יו\nוְעַל־בִּגְדֵ֥י בָנָ֖יו אִתּ֑וֹ וְקָדַ֥שׁ הוּא֙ וּבְגָדָ֔יו וּבָנָ֛יו\nוּבִגְדֵ֥י בָנָ֖יו אִתּֽוֹ׃<br />\n<strong>Take some of the blood that is on the altar</strong> and some of the anointing\noil and sprinkle upon Aaron and his vestments, and also upon his sons\nand his sons’ vestments. Thus shall he and his vestments be holy, as\nwell as his sons and his sons’ vestments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there anything like this anywhere else, taking blood <em>off</em> the mizbeach and reusing it for another part of the avodah? Does it matter which blood? - several korbonos have been brought by now.<br />\nWho talks about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.5.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 5:6</a>, paskened by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Trespass.2.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Meilah 2:11</a></p>\n<p>Normally, after the blood has been thrown, it only has monetary kedusha of hekdesh.  It can be redeemed and used for whatever chullin purposes you want.  (The example in the mishnah is for fertilizer, I'm not sure what else you'd use it for.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The suggested verse in the miluim procedure, according to Rashi on Shemos 21:22 corresponds to the second ram brought as a peace offering (<em>shlamim</em>). In a peace offering there are two applications of blood on the walls of the altar which are four (i.e. leave marks on 4 sides as they are done from two diagonal corners). This blood is not baked as it does not come close with the fire, and could be used for the miluim procedure. As we know, the altar was annointed with special oil Exodus 30:22-30. This was a second blood application on the kohanim, which touched the annointed altar. The first blood application is described in Exodus 29:20 and it is fully matched by a procedure of purification of the metzorah Vayikra 14:10-20, to permit him/her enter the camp. Thus, we have to conclude that the second application is a stringency of the concecration of kohanim.</p>\n<p>There are no other such cases in the Torah, in which a person gets permitted to a congregation, except for a <em>metzorah</em> to a camp of <em>Israelim</em> and <em>kohanim</em> to a camp of <em>kehunah</em>. The consecration of the camp of <em>Leviah</em> was exchange with the already consecrated firstborn. Therefore, the described procedure is unique.</p>\n\n\n",

He writes that animal hides are not considered to be meat (prohibiting its mixture with milk) by Torah law; they are, however, prohibited with milk by rabbinic law. If they are dried and processed, the resulting gelatin is not included in this rabbinic prohibition. Therefore, gelatin produced from kosher slaughtered animal hides may be intentionally used with milk, provided that the hides are cleaned in order to remove any meat residue. Some opinions disagree with Horav Feinstein’s conclusion, most notably Horav Aharon Kotler zt”l, who concludes that gelatin produced from kosher hides is considered to be a meat product. However, there is room for leniency when dealing with gelatin that is derived from kosher hides, as the gelatin has little or no taste.

While we do recognize martyrdom in Jews who were murdered sanctifying Hashem's name and laws, a Jew is not encouraged to pursue death. It is better to live than to die outside of a handful of exceptions.</p>\n<p>My question is how this philosophy fits into a war mindset? How are Jewish soldiers expected to act on the battlefield when we know that God ultimately does not want anyone to put themselves in a situation where they might die?</p>\n<p>Is there any Halacha which discusses this topic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is an <a href=\"https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/381422\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> from R’ Melamed on this topic that addresses your question at length, from all angles and is worth reading in its entirety. I will quote one paragraph that specifically addresses the crux of your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, there is no commandment to endanger oneself in a situation where it is probable that the would-be rescuer will be killed in order to save individual Jewish lives. However, during wartime, when it is necessary to endanger soldiers in order to win the battle, soldiers must be willing to enter situations where the danger outweighs the potential rescue. As Maran HaRav Kook wrote, the principle of “ve’chai ba’hem” (‘and you shall live by them’, i.e., the words of the Torah), from which we learn that pikuach nefesh (saving lives) overrides all commandments in the Torah, does not apply during warfare, since the laws for the public differ from those for the individual. And for the sake of sustaining the public, individuals must be willing to enter danger (Mishpat Kohen 143). Based on this, the responsa Tzitz Eliezer (13:100) wrote that also the principle of “chayecha kodmim le’chayeh chavercha” (“your life takes precedence over your friend’s life”) does not apply during warfare, “rather, all war recruits are obligated, together as one person, to sacrifice, each one his soul, for the sake of saving the life of his fellow. And this too is included in the laws of the public, and under the guidelines of national conduct and ordinances.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The characters of 𐎧𐏁𐎹𐎠𐎼𐏁𐎠 read \"x-sh-y-a-r-sh-a\". The \"x\" is a \"kh\" sound (as in IPA /x/), and vowels are written. So the transcription is something like \"khshayarsha\". That initial khsh is a mouthful for some but otherwise it's fairly straightforward, and the relation to Greek Ξέρξης shouldn't be too much of a stretch.</p>\n<p>For the rest, this amateur linguist follows Wikipedia's etymology with some commentary and nontechnical pronunciation guide:</p>\n<p>First the name gained an \"a\" at the front (I'm not sure why, since Babylonian doesn't seem to object to initial kh, maybe there's a grammatical cause), and then had the khsh cluster broken up (gaining another \"a\" in between), which leads to the \"achash\" beginning.</p>\n<p>The \"shaya\" was mutated in series to \"shiya\", then \"shiwa\" (exchanging one glide for another), then \"shwe\" (losing the \"i\" again), and finally \"shwe\" becomes \"shve\" in modern Hebrew.</p>\n<p>And for the ending, the vowel in \"-sha\" was lost (never much of a surprise in Semitic languages). An epenthetic “o” was later inserted between the “r” and the “sh\".</p>\n<p>The endpoints of this process are connected by reasonable, more-or-less predictable, sound changes, but there are so <em>many</em> of them across the languages and the years that it's near-impossible to see the relation without following the individual steps.</p>\n\n\n",

The leaders in charge of the transmission would keep their own notes, taken in class from their predecessors, and individuals would also make notes of their own in class.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבינו הקדוש חיבר המשנה. ומימות משה רבינו ועד רבינו הקדוש לא חיברו חבור\nשמלמדין אותו ברבים בתורה שבעל פה. אלא בכל דור ודור ראש בית דין או נביא\nשהיה באותו הדור כותב לעצמו זכרון השמועות ששמע מרבותיו והוא מלמד על פה\nברבים. וכן כל אחד ואחד כותב לעצמו כפי כחו מביאור התורה ומהלכותיה כמו\nששמע. ומדברים שנתחדשו בכל דור ודור בדינים שלא למדום מפי השמועה אלא\nבמדה משלש עשרה מדות והסכימו עליהם בית דין הגדול.</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Hakadosh composed the Mishnah. From the days of Moses, our\nteacher, until Rabbenu Hakadosh, no one had composed a text for the\npurpose of teaching the Oral Law in public. Instead, in each\ngeneration, the head of the court or the prophet of that generation\nwould take notes of the teachings which he received from his masters\nfor himself, and teach them verbally in public. Similarly, according\nto his own potential, each individual would write notes for himself of\nwhat he heard regarding the explanation of the Torah, its laws, and\nthe new concepts that were deduced in each generation concerning laws\nthat were not communicated by the oral tradition, but rather deduced\nusing one of the thirteen principles of Biblical exegesis and accepted\nby the high court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The notes would be quite similar to the way Mishna and Gemara look today. They would record the laws, and trace back who said them as best they could at the time. The Oral element of transmission in combination with the note making arrived at the days of Hillel and Shammai with accumulating ambiguities, leading eventually to lack of clarity, and even contradictions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most common example would be that the teaching arrived in the Beit\nMidrash with two opinions on record, and they would contradict. One\nwould say <em>mutar</em> in the name of so-andso, one would say <em>assur</em> in\nthe name of so-and-so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process to resolve these ambiguities and contradictions - well that's what we know well from studying gemara. They used logical reasoning, limited exegetical rules, and other standards to correct the issues.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: the opinions were not personal opinions in general, but notes of notes of notes, teachings of teachings of teachings, that trace back to their origin (either Sinai, or the date of the innovation by the sages of the law in question), with degraded quality. The reason they are recorded by the name of who said it was (in part) part of the process of keeping good records.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, yes for every karet prohibition you need to bring a separate chatat, except for Eshet Ish.</p>\n<p>Now the Gemara answers no, since the general pasuk forbidding Arayot already grouped the sister with the rest of the prohibitions, that’s how we can make the connection between the two.</p>\n<p>So now to my question, wouldn’t this answer of the Gemara ruin the idea before with the Shelamim? Now according to this Svara of the fact that they’re grouped together being proof to the similar law, so too by the Shelamim case since all forbidden Kodashim are grouped in one pasuk, then presumably even the קדשי בדק הבית would be an issur of karet like the rest (even though it doesn’t go on the altar).</p>\n<p>I thought this was such an obvious question.

And one is connected to the other, like rings of a chain [of causation]</strong>. Another tradition in our hands is that for every essence and every event among these lower being, supervisors from the angelic category we mentioned above are appointed.

And this means that according to what is created from these powers, the order in which they are set and the limits that have been set up, that is what unfolds afterwards according to the axiom of unfolding that the Creator, may His name be blessed, willed. And according to that which develops and will develop among them, is what develops and will develop among the lower creatures.</strong> Whereas the existence, condition, arrangement and all of the other distinctions among [the higher] powers are according to that which is appropriate for them in accordance with their true makeup; the existence, condition, arrangement and all of the other occurrences among the lower beings, unfold [from the spiritual beings] and are applied to that which is appropriate in them according to their true natures.<br />\nThree general processes in creation: See that according to this root concept, the beginning of all events is above with the higher powers and their end is below with the lower creatures. And likewise, the beginning of all developments is above and their end is below. However there is one component that is an exception to this rule. And that is that which relates to man's free choice.

    "content": "# The Status of the Deuterocanonical Books\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was wondering to what degree, if any, the Deuterocanonical books of the Septuagint are used in Judaism? I could not find a good answer on this anywhere.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the books get used in histories of Judaism, as primary sources on religious concerns during the Second Temple period. I didn't know if they ever played a role in actual religious discourse though. In general, Protestant Christians reject classifying these books as \"Holy Scripture,\" but they do often get cited in clarifying religious points, and I figured a similar situation might exist in Judaism since the Hanukkah story is laid out in the books of the Maccabees.</p>\n<p>Also, I seem to recall reading that at least some of these were cited in the Targum, but I haven't been able to find that again.</p>\n<p>I suppose I'd have a similar question on the Books of Enoch, which weren't in the Septuagint.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Among the Apocrypha, the Book of Ecclesiasticus, or The Wisdom of Ben Sira, is used in Jewish sources.  It is quoted by name in the Talmud 17 times, in the Midrash Rabbah 8 times, and in the Zohar once.  For example, the Talmud says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is written in the Book of Ben Sira [Ecclesiasticus 3:21-2] “Do not seek things that are too hard for you, and do not search things that are hidden from you.  Think about the things that have been permitted to you.  You have no need of the things that are secret.” [Ḥagigah 13a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sanhedrin excluded it from the Tanakh because it shows Epicurean and Sadducean tendencies.  However, the Talmud says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yosef said: [We may ban the book as a whole, yet still] we may expound to [the masses] the good things that the book contains. [Sanhedrin 100b; also Bava Kamma 92b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Midrash says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And furthermore, my son, be admonished: There is no end to making many books, [but] whoever brings into his house more than the twenty-four books [of the Bible] introduces confusion into his house, as, for example, the book of Ben Sira and the book of Ben Tagla. [The latter is lost.] [Ecclesiastes Rabbah 12:11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Isn’t it written: “If I had not [luleh] believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living” (Psalms 27:13). The dots that appear over the word luleh in the text indicate doubt and uncertainty of his piety, and whether he was deserving of a place in the land of the living (see Avot DeRabbi Natan 34). In the name of Rabbi Yosei, it was taught in a Tosefta: Why do dots appear over the word luleh, as if there are some reservations? Because David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe. I have every confidence in You that You grant an excellent reward to the righteous in the World-to-Come since God’s ultimate goodness is manifest in the land of eternal life, but I still harbor uncertainty with regard to myself, and I do not know whether or not I definitely have a portion among them. In any case, apparently David was uncertain whether or not he deserved to receive a portion of God’s reward for the righteous; how, then, could he characterize himself as pious?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֶׁמָּא יִגְרוֹם הַחֵטְא.\nThe Gemarra responds: His concern does not prove anything, as King David knew that he was pious. He was simply concerned lest a transgression that he might commit <strong>in the future</strong> will cause him to lose his opportunity to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What's the Chiddush? It is generally known that if one sins he or she might potentially lose his/her heaven. Duh! Why the need for the dots on the word? <em>Even if the verse would state - לוּלֵא הֶאֱמַנְתִּי לִרְאוֹת בְּטוּב ה׳ בְּאֶרֶץ חַיִּים - <strong>without dots,</strong> I would realize that David, the greatest Chassid of all time, certainly knew that with a future still in front of him he could not be assured of his place in heaven.</em> Do you mean to tell me that without the dots I would have thought that David was certain that his past and current Chassid status was going to guarantee him heaven?!</p>\n\n\n",

I wondered if anyone has any suggestions for precise equivalents within halachah? I’m not looking for midrashic expressions of equality, of which there are many well-known examples.</p>\n<p>There are also many examples, both positive and negative of discrimination within particular aspects of halachah, but is there a guiding overall definition, other than what is popularly known as the ‘golden rule'?

The Gemara relates: Avimi had five sons during his father’s lifetime who were ordained to issue halakhic rulings, and he too was ordained. And yet when Rabbi Abbahu, his father, came and called at the gate to enter, Avimi would himself run and go to open the door for him. And before he arrived there, he would already say: Yes, yes, so that his father would not think that he was being ignored. (Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi on that Gemara points out why he did this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואפילו הכי כי הוה קרי ר' אבהו אבבא היה אבימי רץ ופותח לו ואינו מניח לאחד מבניו לילך</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But even so, when Rabbi Abbahu called at the gate, Avimi would run and open [it] for him and he would not let one of his sons go [do it]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Meiri points out that this teaches us, even a son who is a talmid chacham and older already, should still do the mitzvah himself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפילו היה הבן תלמיד חכם וכן שהוא גדול בשנים אין לו להקל בכבוד אב ואם דרך הערה אמרו על אבימי בנו של ר' אבהו שהיה תלמיד חכם וכן שהיה גדול בשנים עד שהיו לו חמשה בנים בעלי הוראה ואעפ\"כ אמרו עליו כי הוה אתי אבוה וקרי אבבא רהיט ואזיל ואמר אין אין עד דמטי התם ופתח ליה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Exactly, how to understand all this, seems to be the matter of debate. If it is just a better way to do the mitzvah, “mitzvah bo yoser mibshlucho”, or is it a part of the actual mitzvah.</p>\n<p>The Zera Emes in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=741&st=&pgnum=346\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2 YD 148</a> says that Avimi’s sons would have been his shliach but he still preferred to do it himself even though the mitzvah could’ve been accomplished with a shliach.</p>\n<p>The Machaneh Chaim <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=788&st=&pgnum=642\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CM 29</a> says that there’s a part of the mitzvah that requires the son to actually do the kibbud himself. Although the Mitzvah can still be accomplished through a shliach, there’s a part of the positive commandment to actually do it, like tefillin.</p>\n<p>I got these last two sources from <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/kibbud-av-vaeim-chapter-5-the-mitzvah-to-honor-ones-parents-and-its-included-obligations/#_ftnref20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> site in the footnotes. Here is how they wrap up the practical application of this halacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is possible to fulfill the mitzvah of honoring one’s parents through hiring someone to do so on one’s behalf.[17] One may even hire a Gentile for this purpose.[18] Nonetheless, as is the general rule, it is a greater mitzvah for one to personally serve and honor his parents then to do so through a hired emissary. This applies even if the son is a Torah scholar.[19] Furthermore, from some Rishonim it is evident that the main mitzvah is only fulfilled when one personally attends to his parent, even if he could do it through an emissary.[20] If, however, the son lives a distance from the parent, or simply does not get along well with them, then he may hire someone to provide them their needs rather than do so himself.[21] In such a case, it is proper for one to pay the emissary for his troubles, even if the emissary is willing to do so for free.[22] Nonetheless, if the parent desires that specifically his son care for him, then he cannot delegate the duty to another person to do so, and is even to live next to his parents for this purpose.[23]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Would it depend on if the door is being opened/closed or no?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>According to a shiur I heard from a local Rav, a porta-potty has the halachic status of a בית הכסא קבוע, or permanent bathroom, because the waste is contained within the porta-potty itself. Thus it has the status of the waste itself, and one cannot pray as long as it is in his area of view.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This answer is based on the halachos found in Sefer אשי ישראל פרק נג׳. As mentioned in a previous answer, porta potties get the same halachos as a בית הכסא קבוע, because the waste remains in place. This is unlike our flush toilets which may be afforded certain leniencies due to its resembling a Persian latrine where the waste gets immediately carried away. Another factor regarding porta potties is the fact that the partitions surrounding them service only the latrine itself and do not serve as a functioning wall for anything outside, unlike most of our bathrooms where the wall to the bathroom also serves as a wall in the house/structure.</p>\n<p>The Halacha that emerges then, is that one cannot pray facing the porta potty from any visual distance. One can pray with their back to the porta potty at a distance of four amos, assuming that the smell does not exit the porta potty. If smell does exit, one should move to four amos from where the smell stops.</p>\n\n\n",

R. Huna in the\nname of R. Joseph explained: Always 'God seeketh that which is\npursued'. You find a case where a righteous man pursues a righteous\nman, 'And God seeketh that which is pursued'; where a wicked man\npursues a righteous man, 'And God seeketh that which is pursued';\nwhere a wicked man pursues a wicked man, 'And God seeketh that which\nis pursued'; even where a righteous man pursues a wicked man, 'And God\nseeketh that which is pursued.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does a <em>rodef</em> mean in this context (someone with an actual <em>din rodef</em>, a legally defined pursuer out to commit murder?)? And what does it mean that God is <em>yebhaqesh</em> (seeks/desires) them?</p>\n<p>At face value, the idea that the righteous ought not prosecute the wicked doesn't really conform to our sense of justice. Indeed, even the peshat of the originating pasuq seems to imply the opposite, i.e. that the wicked are held to account for their iniquity. Rashi Qoheleth 3:15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאלהים יבקש את נרדף - ליפרע מן הרודף לפיכך מה יתרונו של עושה הרעה\nבאשר הוא עמל הרי סופו להשתלם</p>\n<p>and God seeks the pursued: to punish the pursuer. Therefore, what is\nthe profit of one who does evil in what he toils? He is destined to be\ncalled to account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What idea is the Midrash trying to communicate here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My understanding of this midrash is that a righteous person pursuing a wicked person is punished when the righteous person's own pursuit is wicked or involves some wickedness, not when the pursuit is completely righteous.</p>\n<p>The meaning of יְבַקֵּשׁ is \"seek,\" and (as Rashi says, quoted in your question) it refers to meting out punishment, as in דֹרֵשׁ דָּמִים (<a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Tehillim/9/13#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 9:13</a>). בקש is a synonym of דרש; here as there the grammatical object of the verb is the victim (like the word \"avenge\" in English), and the object of the punishment is only implied. The <a href=\"https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=Vayikra_Rabbah_27:5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">same midrash</a> continues with a clear restatement of this idea (as learned from other scriptural sources) in different but synonymous terms (תּוֹבֵעַ דָּמָן שֶׁל נִרְדָּפִין מִן הָרוֹדְפִין).</p>\n<p>The technical case of רודף (i.e. attempted murder or rape) is not the general meaning of the term נִרְדָּף here (as I understand it), but it is a particular instance of it and it offers a perfect illustration: you are allowed to kill the attempted murderer, but if you were able to stop him in any way other than killing and you choose to kill, then you are guilty of murder (<a href=\"https://shas.alhatorah.org/Full/Sanhedrin/74a.2#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 74a</a>; the same is true in monetary cases, see <a href=\"https://shas.alhatorah.org/Full/Bava_Kamma/28a.4#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 28a</a>). The punishment of the pursuer could accordingly be due to some unlawful aspect in his pursuit.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the midrash could even be referring to lawfully pursuing someone for a personal reason (this seems to be the meaning of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Etz_Yosef_on_Vayikra_Rabbah.27.5.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Etz Yosef</a>'s comment here<sup>1</sup>), in which case this would apply even to a pursuer who is fully within his rights, for not going beyond the letter of the law (as in <a href=\"https://shas.alhatorah.org/Full/Bava_Metzia/30b.14#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 30b</a>).</p>\n<p>In either case, it is the very fact of being a pursuer that tips the scales towards the pursued. This is precisely the peshat of the verse which says that God seeks the נִרְדָּף, as such, and fits in precisely with the wording you quoted from Rashi: the person doing evil (עושה הרעה), not necessarily the more evil person, is punished.</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>לא שרודפו על רשעתו דא\"כ מצוה קעביד. אלא מיירי שרודפו להנאתו. The word להנאתו means not for fun (we're talking about a צדיק), but for something that rightfully belongs to him as an individual, as opposed to לשם שמים.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk (1717-1786) adds that the sacrifices on the Golden Altar effectively “slaughter” those evil forces, so it is therefore appropriately called a mizbeach,which is related to the word for “slaughtering”. Alternatively, Rabbi Yonah Ibn Janach (990-1050) and Rabbi Avraham Maimuni (son of Maimonides) write that it is called a mizbeach simply because it was fashioned in the same shape as the main altar, albeit on a smaller scale, as it too was required to be square and have four “horns” (Ex. 30:2). According to this explanation, the word mizbeach as applied to the Golden Altar is actually a “borrowed term” used because the Golden Altar resembles the Outer Altar. Radak in Sefer HaShorashim explains that because in some rare situations (like on Yom Kippur) sacrificial bloods are brought to this altar, it is justifiably called a mizbeach.</p>\n\n\n",

Deuteronomy 17:2—5). If there were witnesses but there had been no caution, they were destroyed by the plague, as it is said, (v. 35) “And the Lord plagued the people”.

And he said unto them: If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle). Samson's riddle is presented to the Philistines at his wedding: What is sweeter than honey, and what is a wilder than lion? without going into the essence of the riddle and its solution. According to the commentators, the riddle is based on a real case that was caught in a convention, that the bees nested in lion's belly that Samson killed. Samson gave the honey to his righteous parents to eat. And the halachic question is whether it is permissible\nto eat honey made in dead lion? Moreover, didn't his parents investigate where this honey came from?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why didn't ben-Qattin redesign the Kiyor to have more than 12 spigots?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Yoma 37a and Zebhahim 20a we learn that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בן קטין עשה שנים עשר דד לכיור אף הוא עשה מוכני לכיור שלא יהיו מימיו\nנפסלין בלינה</p>\n<p>Ben-Qattin made twelve spouts for the laver; he also made wheels\n[pulleys] for the laver, so that its water should not become unfit\nthrough the passing of the night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam writes (H. Beth ha-Behirah 3:18):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הכיור--היו לו שנים עשר דד, כדי שיהיו כל הכוהנים העוסקים בתמיד מקדשים\nממנו כאחד.  ומוכני עשו לו, שיהיו בה המים תמיד; והיא חול, כדי שלא יהיו\nהמים שבה נפסלין בלינה:  שהכיור מכלי הקודש, ומקדש; וכל דבר שיתקדש בכלי\nקודש--אם לן, נפסל.</p>\n<p>The washbasin had twelve taps, so that all the priests who were\ninvolved in offering the daily sacrifice could sanctify [their hands\nand feet] at one time. A mechanism was made so that it could be filled\nwith water at all times. [The mechanism itself] was not sacred, and\nthus, the water remaining in it did not become invalidated [for future\nuse] because the night passed. [This was necessary] because the\nwashbasin was a sacred vessel and sanctified [its contents]. Anything\nwhich is sanctified by a sacred vessel becomes invalidated [for future\nuse] after the night passes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Bartenura (Yoma 3:10) notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שנים עשר דד לכיור: כדי שיהיו שנים עשר כהנים הזוכים כפייש של תמיד השחר\nמקדשים בבא אחת ואע\"פ ששלשה עשר כהנים היו כדאמרן כפרקא כראשונה לא עשה\nדד לשוחט שהשחיטה כשרה בזר</p>\n<p>Twelve spigots for the Kiyor: In order so that the twelve Kohanim that\nmerited in the lottery to participate in the Tamid ha-Shahar could\nsanctify themselves all at once, even though there were thirteen\nKohanim as explained in the first chapter another spigot was not made\nsince the slaughter is acceptable even when performed by a non-Kohen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that even though thirteen Kohanim regularly participated in the daily routine, only twelve actually would have needed to wash their hands and feet. So far, so good... twelve makes (sufficient) sense. However we also learn that there were occasions on which a greater number than thirteen Kohanim participated. The Gemara in Yoma 26b teaches:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תני רבי חייא: פייס פעמים שלשה עשר, פעמים ארבעה עשר, פעמים חמשה עשר\nפעמים ששה עשר</p>\n<p>R. Ḥiyya taught: Sometimes the lottery [for selecting Kohanim for the\ndifferent abhodoth] was for thirteen, sometimes for fourteen,\nsometimes for fifteen, sometimes for sixteen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So there were definitely occasions on which more than twelve/thirteen Kohanim would have been chosen to participate (see Rashi ad loc on the different occasions that would give rise to necessitating the abhodah (service) of additional Kohanim).</p>\n<p>Given that there were times of the year that more than twelve Kohanim would have been selected to perform the various abhodoth, why did ben-Qattin redesign the the Kiyor to only have twelve spigots? If there is some advantage to having the Kohanim all wash at once, why weren't there more spouts?</p>\n<p>Some ideas that occurred to me are: A) maneuvering the Kiyor was kind of a big deal, so much so that the mechanism for raising/lowering it every day was said to be heard from Jericho (Tamid 3:8), maybe keeping it just to twelve alleviated the burden - but then I pushed that thought away with \"this is the Miqdash, go big or go home! what's a few more spigots?\" B) Perhaps any bigger and it would have interfered with the operational space, possibly infringing on the routes the Kohanim would have taken to perform their designated tasks C) Perhaps the additional abhodoth on the days with expanded abhodah didn't require washing?</p>\n<p>Are there any sources that discuss this? Am I overlooking something basic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_Yom_Tov_on_Mishnah_Yoma.3.10.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfos Yom Tov</a> on this Mishnah, asks a different question, which might be able to shed light on yours.

He concludes, that they removed the steps to the Ulam in that corner, and fit the kiur in there.</p>\n<p>Based on this, perhaps the reason they didn’t add more spigots, was because they didn’t want to take away even more space from the steps.</p>\n<p>(As an aside, this would answer another question that always bothered me.

Today, granola bars are made from whole grain oats that are first cooked until softened and then rolled into flat flakes. They are then combined with sugars, oils and syrups and baked. The Mishna Berura (Orach Chaim 208:3) states that if grains are reduced and broken down in the cooking process, even if they were introduced whole, one should recite Mezonos. The granola bar grains appear to remain whole. The Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 208:4) says that on whole toasted grains the proper Beracha is Borei Pri Hoadoma. In many granola bars the oats actually comprise less than fifty percent of the volume of the bar. The majority of the ingredients are those on which one would recite a Shehakol. Never the less, Rabbi Belsky and Rabbi Schachter have said that the proper Beracha Rishona to be recited when eating a granola bar is Borei Pri Haodoma. The oats (granola) are clearly considered the ikar, and all the other ingredients are considered tofel. We should therefore follow the regular rules of ikar vitofel and recite Hoadoma. Some poskim, however, consider the cooking process together with the subsequent baking to be a maiseh kideira. They posit that through all the cooking and baking, the grains must be partially broken down, and the proper beracha to be recited, as per the above mentioned Mishna Berura, would be Mezonos. Whether one recites Haodoma or Mezonos either way one would be yotzai bidieved. The disagreement is as to which beracha should be recited lichatchila.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Therefore this depends on the status of something that is batel: is it like it no longer exists or is it still there, ready to be reawakened (חוזר וניעור). If we say that something that is batel is considered to no longer exist, then a kohen would be allowed to enter a room even with sixty sleeping people. However, if we say that the thing that is batel can be reawakened, it would seem that the sixty sixtieths add up to one person. On the third hand, however, the sixty sixtieths would be reawakened, in which case they add up not to sixty sixtieths of a dead person, but to one awake person, so it is still permitted for the kohen to enter.</p>\n\n\n",

You are asking about eating a hot dog <em>bun</em>, which is unequivocally <em>not</em> a sandwich, any more than a slice of bread is.

    "content": "# How Does the Ramban Deal with לֹֽא־תֹ֥הוּ בְרָאָ֖הּ?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Isaiah 45 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹֽא־תֹ֥הוּ בְרָאָ֖הּ לָשֶׁ֣בֶת יְצָרָ֑הּ\nHe did not create it (earth) for a waste, He formed it to be inhabited ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But per the Ramban, the verb ברא means to create something from nothing. There is only one thing that was created from nothing - תהו.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... ואין אצלנו בלשון הקדש בהוצאת היש מאין אלא לשון \"ברא\";\nאבל הוציא מן האפס הגמור המוחלט יסוד דק מאד, אין בו ממש, אבל הוא כוח ממציא, מוכן לקבל הצורה ולצאת מן הכוח אל הפועל. והוא החומר הראשון, נקרא ליוונים \"היולי\". ואחר ההיולי לא ברא דבר, אבל יצר ועשה, כי ממנו המציא הכל והלביש הצורות ותיקן אותן.  ודע, כי השמים וכל אשר בהם – חומר אחד, והארץ וכל אשר בה – חומר אחד. והקב\"ה ברא אלו שניהם מאין, ושניהם לבדם נבראים, והכל נעשים מהם.  והחומר הזה, שקראו היולי, נקרא בלשון הקדש \"תֹּהוּ\", והמלה נגזרה מלשונם (קידושין מ ב): \"בתוהא על הראשונות\". מפני שאם בא אדם לגזור בו שֵׁם, תוהא ונמלך לקוראו בשם אחר, כי לא לבש צורה שיתפש בה השם כלל.\nNow we have no expression in the sacred language for bringing forth something from nothing other than the word bara (created) ...\nHe brought forth from total and absolute nothing a very thin substance devoid of corporeality but having a power of potency, fit to assume form and to proceed from potentiality into reality. This was the primary matter created by G-d; it is called by the Greeks hyly (matter). After the hyly, He did not create anything, but He formed and made things with it, and from this hyly He brought everything into existence and clothed the forms and put them into a finished condition.\nKnow that the heavens and all that is in them consist of one substance, and the earth and everything that is in it consist of one substance. The Holy One, blessed be He, created these two substances from nothing; they alone were created, and everything else was constructed from them.\nThis substance, which the Greeks called hyly, is called in the sacred language tohu, the word being derived from the expression of the Sages: “betohei (when the wicked bethinks himself) of his doings in the past.” If a person wants to decide a name for it [this primordial matter], he may bethink himself, change his mind and call it by another name since it has taken on no form to which the name should be attached.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the phrase from Isaiah seems very odd because there is nothing else that God was Boreh except for Tohu! <em>What do you mean that He was not Boreh it for Tohu? Tohu is precisely the only thing He was Boreh.</em></p>\n<p>I realize that the verse is speaking about the earth and God is saying that he did not create the earth to be desolate. But, technically, per the Ramban what happened during creation in fact contravenes the verse - The only thing actually 'created' was Tohu! The word Bara does not apply to anything else.</p>\n<p>The Sforno has a very interesting take on that verse in Isaiah which deals with some of this tension, but I do not think his opinion works with the Ramban:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכשבראתיה מאין, לֹא בראתיה תֹהוּ בלבד, אבל בראתי ׳תוהו ובוהו׳ יחד when I created the earth from nothing I did not create it as Tohu alone, but also created it as Bohu</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, the Ramban would not agree that ברא can go on anything other than תהו ...!!??</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>He would read it as not being descriptive of the creation process, but of the <em>purpose</em> of creation. That is, creation was not meant to remain <em>tohu</em>, but rather inhabited. This can be seen in the Targum to the passuk, which adds a \"ל\" before the word <em>tohu</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲרֵי כִדְנַן אֲמַר יְיָ דִי בְרָא שְׁמַיָא הוּא אֱלֹהִים דְשַׁכְלִיל אַרְעָא וְעָבְדָהּ הוּא אַתְקְנָהּ <strong>לָא לְרֵיקָנוּ</strong> בְרָהּ אֱלָהֵין לְאַסְגָאָה עֲלָהּ בְּנֵי אֱנָשָׁא אַתְקְנָא אֲנָא יְיָ וְלֵית עוֹד:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Therefore an exact half is in a <em>ruchniyosdikly</em> reactive state, since it will seek to combine with another exact half to form a whole.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we know that if the Jewish people would observe two <em>Shabassos</em> then Mashiach would come.

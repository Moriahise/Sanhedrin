    "content": "# How can Gentile that kept Shabbat repent?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have kept Shabbat for two and a half years. I stopped doing this almost half a year ago. I know that Gentile who does this deserves death according to Talmud. Any sources that can give me a little encouragement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>\"A Gentile who made his rest day like Shabbat even during one of the days of the week deserves a death sentence... although the death sentence is not applied, he will be punished by stripes or some other type of punishment\" (Maimonides, Laws of kings X). \nThere is no greater \"cancellation\" of Shabbat than resting like Shabbat on Tuesday, and it is also forbidden, so obviously just doing one Melacha on Shabbt does <strong>not</strong> cancel the prohibition of a Gentile observing Shabbat - especially since a Jew doing one Melacha is punished for that one deed and is not said he cancelled the whole Shabbat (which would be the case if he had transgressed all forty forbidden Melachot)! \nSome rabbis go into great pains in order to allow Gentiles to observe Shabbat - Rabbi Haim Richman says \"don't call it Shabbat but a Celebration of Creation\" (!), another one says \"it is not forbidden if it is done under our supervision\" (!!). \nThe ONLY case when a Gentile is to observe Shabbat is the \"Ger\" mentioned in Exodus 20:10. It cannot be the Ger Tzedek who is a Jew, and it cannot be the Ger Toshav who is a non-Jew and does work for himself. So, as Rambam explains in his Laws of Shabbat, the verse is taling about a resident stranger employed by a Jew or hired seasonally. He may work for himself, but we are commanded to let him rest like we do on Shabbat in our home. </p>\n\n<p>Our Patriarchs \"observed the whole Torah\" but NOT the specific commandments we received at Sinai - meaning they kept the SPIRIT of the Law in all their doings.     </p>\n\n\n",

Why isn't the above example a contradiction of this? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Good question, which shows the need to learn the source of poskim Acharonim in Rishonim.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Nat Bar Nat is allowed, according to Shmuel in Gemara (Chulin 111b),\nand the halacha is ruled as Shmuel.</p></li>\n<li><p>The prohibition treated in Nat Bar Nat is Bassar Vechalav, and things which aren't yet prohibited only, I mean by that, for instance, taste of meat, who is in itself permitted, or taste of milk, who is in itself permitted, or taste of Korban Shelamim who is still not notar. For taste of prohibited think, the presence of the taste is tested, no matter if it is directly or not from the first source of prohibition, e.g. taste of Kilae Hakerem.</p></li>\n<li><p>The prohibition Bassar Vechalav occurs when meat received taste from\nmilk when milk too received taste from meat. A reciprocal event is\nrequired to see the meat and the milk as prohibited. </p></li>\n<li><p>In our case, the meat component is a taste inside the maccaroni,\nwhich itself is comming after a step in the pot's wall. </p>\n\n<p>(Meat --/giving taste/--> pot (taste of degree 1) --/giving taste/->\nMaccaroni (taste of degree 2) -/giving taste/-> cheese (taste of\ndegree 3)). <strong>This taste of degree 3 received into the cheese is not\nrelevant</strong>. </p></li>\n<li><p>Since the milk component (our cheese) did not receive relevant taste\nof meat, no Halachic Mixture happened.

So the maccaroni\nis permitted because the cheese is permitted.</p></li>\n<li><p>But in your case <strong>cooking</strong> Maccaroni in the fleishig pot <strong>is\ndifferent</strong> according to some Rishonim, because the original case of\nNat Bar Nat in Gemara is not similar.</p></li>\n<li><p>Indeed, there is a debate  between <em>Rivan in name of his father in law Rashi</em> in one side\nand Ramban and his followers in the other side. </p></li>\n<li><p>Rivan said that the whole taste can get out of the pot through\nboiling, <strong>it is not a case of Nat Bar Nat</strong>.

According to Rivan, a true cooking in the pot will give in the maccaroni all the taste present in the wall of the pot without\nchanging degree from first to second degree, no nat bar nat in this\ncase.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ramban and its school learned that Nat Bar Nat is equally true for\neach taste of meat (or milk) which go out from a pot. </p></li>\n<li><p>The answer of the Rav quoted in the OP is an \"a posteriori psak\" only and follows Rama (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A6%D7%94_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">YD 95, 2</a>) who ruled \"as Rivan A Priori\" and \"as Ramban A\nposteriori\". </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The custom you have heard is the a priori common custom for Ashkenazi people.</strong></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If it's pareves cooked on meat equipment, don't eat it with milk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's a broad rule of thumb many have adopted to avoid problems. But it's not nearly that simple. The Gemara says that <em>dagim she'alu b'ke'ara</em> -- pareves \"handled fleishigs\" -- can be eaten with milk. There are three ways to read that Gemara:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The pareve was cooked pareve then put (hot) into a (ben yomo, clean) fleishigs bowl.</li>\n<li>The pareve was boiled in water in a (ben yomo, clean) fleishigs pot. [That's the macaroni case.]</li>\n<li>The pareve was grilled directly on a (ben yomo, clean) fleishig griddle.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Everyone allows the first case; many allow the second; and some allow the third.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The first point to discuss is that the normative halakhic practice throughout most of Jewish history is that while there are varying levels of forbidden, there is only one level of permissible. In other words, once something is permitted, it's completely permitted, with no reservations. So a piece of food that was produced by a process bedi'eved is just as permitted as food prepared  l'chatchilah. I'm not trying to say that you are allowed to do everything in a way that's only kasher bedi'eved, but attempting to highlight one should separate the process from the result. Once the result is permitted, it's equally as permitted despite the process that brought it into being, but when you do the process, you should attempt to do so in the most correct manner. This is why the page you quoted says \" it is 100% permissible to eat\" because once it's permissible, it's 100% permissible. Whether your Rav would suggest you go through the process to do this is another matter.</p>\n\n<p>As for whether this mixture is prohibited, the standard halakhic baselines are as follows:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.95?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Shulchan Aruch (YD 95:1-2)</a> rules that if a pareve food was cooked in a totally clean dairy vessel, the food may be eaten with meat, and that if a pareve food was cooked in a totally clean meat vessel, the food may be eaten with dairy. </p>\n\n<p>The Rema argues against this and rules that pareve food cooked in a dairy ben yomo vessel (i.e. a vessel used with hot dairy in the past 24 hours) may not be eaten with meat, and vice versa, but that b’dieved, if such foods were already mixed together, they may be eaten. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, according to the Shulchan Aruch (and therefore Sephardic practice), pareve soup cooked in a totally clean dairy pot could be eaten with meat, whereas the Rema would prohibit Ashkenazim from doing this as a practice, but allows that if you find yourself in a situation where the foods were already mixed, they are permissible to be eaten.</p>\n\n<p>Many Jews take extra chumrot or follow other Rabbinic opinions on this matter, which is where you get lines such as: \"If it's pareves cooked on meat equipment, you can't eat it with milk.\". Rather than rely on such a chumrah, it would benefit you to read the relevant texts for yourself, come to a decision about where you feel the truth is in this matter, and then consult your Rav for a final decision.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Has the biblical prophecy about God bringing us back to Egypt in ships been fulfilled?",
    "content": "# Has the biblical prophecy about God bringing us back to Egypt in ships been fulfilled?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I believe Jewish tradition states that many of the prophecies in Ki Tavo have transpired. Verse 68 says the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>And the Lord will bring you back to Egypt in ships</strong>, through the way about which I had said to you, You will never see it again. And there, you will seek to be sold to your enemies for slaves and handmaids, but there will be no buyer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this understood to have already been fulfilled? If so, when? If not, is it understood that it will be fulfilled in the future? Or is it because negative prophecies don't necessarily need to be fulfilled?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are a few possible solutions to this question.</p>\n\n<p>Sabbahillel commented: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have been told that the price of slaves dropped dramatically after the destruction of the second temple and Bar Kochva's revolt about 63 years later. I understand that many people consider that the fulfillment of that prophecy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra on this passuk (in brackets at alhatorah, as it was found only in the Paris 177 manuscript) suggests that this was fulfilled in the times of Mordechai and Esther, based on the wording of Esther in Esther 7:4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּ֤י נִמְכַּ֙רְנוּ֙ אֲנִ֣י וְעַמִּ֔י לְהַשְׁמִ֖יד לַהֲר֣וֹג וּלְאַבֵּ֑ד וְ֠אִלּ֠וּ לַעֲבָדִ֨ים וְלִשְׁפָח֤וֹת נִמְכַּ֙רְנוּ֙ הֶחֱרַ֔שְׁתִּי כִּ֣י אֵ֥ין הַצָּ֛ר שֹׁוֶ֖ה בְּנֵ֥זֶק הַמֶּֽלֶךְ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, for the adversary is not worthy that the king be endamaged. (JPS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/55746/16354\">Is Esther's comment in Esther 7:4 a reference to one of the curses in Devarim 28:68?</a></p>\n\n<p>The Seforno here has an alternate suggestion of what this Passuk means, and his interpretation is seen very clearly in our days (as well as throughout the ages):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהִתְמַכַּרְתֶּם – שֶׁתִּשְׁתַּדְּלוּ לַעֲשׂוֹת מִינֵי מְלָאכוֹת לְהִתְפַּרְנֵס בָּהֶן בְּקֶרֶב הָאֻמּוֹת.\n  וְאֵין קנֶה – אֵין אִישׁ מֵהֶם חָפֵץ בִּמְלַאכְתְּךָ, כְּדֵי שֶׁלּא תּוּכַל לְהִתְפַּרְנֵס בָּהּ.</p>\n  \n  <p>והתהכרתם, you will begin to manufacture or make by hand all kinds of goods the host country lacks in order to secure your economic well being, but\n  ואין קונה, no one will buy these goods due to antisemitic reasons, as they do not want you to gain a foothold in their country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another clear fulfillment of this is noted by Rav David Zvi Hoffman here, who quotes Josephus saying that Titus sent 17,000 Jews to Egypt as slaves, as well as another possibility from the Jerome, who notes a Historical event that happened in the times of Hadrian.  He does, however, note that it is unnecessary to show these events, and that they may simply refer to the general lower status of Jews:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טיטוס הרשע שלח (לדברי יוסף בן מתתיהו: מלחמת היהודים ו, ט׳:ב׳) 17000 יהודים למצרים לעבודת פרך. בזמנו של אדריאנוס קיסר נמכרו ליד קבר רחל בתור עבדים יהודים רבים לאין מספר (הירונימוס לירמיהו ל״א). אבל אין צורך לומר שנבואה זאת מתייחסת למאורע מסויים דווקא, אלא שבא הכתוב לומר שישראל ירדו, מפני שלא שמעו בקול ה׳, לשפל המדרגה, ובה יונח הגרעין לגאולתם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is so special about wine (grape-juice)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A lot of our rituals are done with wine (or grape-juice), e.g. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/45612/why-wine-for-kiddush\"><em>Kiddush</em></a>, <em>Havdalah</em>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27490/four-cups-of-wine-by-the-pesach-seder-from-the-torah\"><em>Pesach seder</em></a>, circumcision, weddings, and offerings. It even has special laws of becoming unfit (<em>yayin nesech</em>), that are much stricter than other things' rules about being set aside for idol worship. We also have a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28905/why-is-a-nazir-not-allowed-to-drink-wine\">special status</a> (<em>nazir</em>) which prohibits a person from wine.</p>\n\n<p>What is it that makes wine so special?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First the importance of wine is a worldwide reality. Wine was the favorite beverage in civilizations geographically adapted to viticulture.</p>\n\n<p>Gemara uses psalm verses to define the special features of wine.\nBerachoth 35b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is it not written, And wine that <strong>maketh glad the heart</strong> of man.</p>\n  \n  <p>and bread that <strong>stayeth man's heart</strong>, which shows that it is bread\n  which sustains, not wine? - The fact is that <strong>wine does both</strong>, it\n  sustains and makes glad, whereas bread sustains but does not cheer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those particularly appreciated qualities were enacted in blessing and some special ceremonies. This is not particular to Judaism, in idolatrous cults they also used wine. Owning good things is a sign of wealth and blessing.</p>\n\n<p>Nazir is linked to side effects of wine, which because of the same particular features may lead to excess and sin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Cover your eyes - this post contains chassidus!</p>\n\n<p>One of the powers/responsibilities of the Jew is to elevate the world by sanctfying it. In shema we say \"bekhol meodecha\" , \" with all your means\" does that mean selling all your possessions to buy a nice esrog? (yes it does. I will sell you one; put your email in the comment)</p>\n\n<p>No it doesn't. It means saying \"how is this next purchase going to be used for mitzvos and holiness\" similarly when we make blessings on food, we take eating, which even animals do and place it on the spiritual plane </p>\n\n<p>Wine is a very special item because it alters people's consciousness. When a chossid gets slightly tipsy, it enables him to let go of the world and sing to hashem and the chossid's wine is holy.\nHe has elevated the ordinary fermented grape mash tremendously.</p>\n\n<p>When a sheigetz drinks wine, he drinks and gets drunk, vomits and falls and lowers himself and the wine spiritually.</p>\n\n<p>Wine gets special treatment because it is capable of both spiritual heights and depths and the protections help insulate its consumption from the conditions that lead to depths.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where does the custom of the \"tossing of the sandal\" in Ruth come from? Why/How does it come to symbolize a successful business transaction?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Everybody loves a good Levirate Marriage story. Personally, I prefer the Ruth story over Tamar's (though that's interesting as well). But I have questions regarding the \"<strong>sandal tossing\" custom</strong> found in the <strong>Ruth</strong> passage. I cited the passage below of the process by which Ruth and her inheritance was given over to Boaz: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming\n  and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his\n  shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was the attestation in\n  Israel.--  So the near kinsman said unto Boaz: 'Buy it for thyself.'\n  And he drew off his shoe.  And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto\n  all the people: 'Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all\n  that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the\n  hand of Naomi. Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon,\n  have I acquired to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon\n  his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among\n  his brethren, and from the gate of his place; ye are witnesses this\n  day. Ruth 4:7-10</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Where</strong> does this custom come from?</li>\n<li><strong>Was this common</strong> in ancient negotiations/contracts? It seems from the\ntext that the scribes felt they needed to explain to the readers\nthat this was done according to \"the manner in [a] former.. time\" as\nif the readers would be unfamiliar with it too. </li>\n<li>Do we have any <strong>other sources</strong>, biblical or not, which report a similar incident?</li>\n<li>Are you aware of any <strong>scholarly articles</strong> that comment or elaborate on\nthis elusive custom?</li>\n<li><strong>How/Why does a tossing of a sandal come to represent \"Nice doing\nbusiness with you?\"</strong></li>\n<li><strong>What does the tossing of the sandal symbolize?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thanks!

The discussion is about the mode of transaction called Chalipin, i.e. excange, used in business, for barter and sale. This practice is still used nowadays. A deed of sale is very often manifested by this, called \"Kinyan Chalipin\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתנאי (רות ד) וזאת לפנים בישראל על הגאולה ועל התמורה לקיים כל דבר _שלף איש נעלו ונתן לרעהו__ </p>\n  \n  <p>גאולה זו <strong>מכירה</strong> וכן הוא אומר (ויקרא כז) לא יגאל </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Redeeming is sale</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תמורה זו <strong>חליפין</strong> וכן הוא אומר (ויקרא כז) לא יחליפנו ולא ימיר אותו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>exchanging is barter</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לקיים כל דבר שלף איש נעלו ונתן לרעהו מי נתן למי בועז נתן לגואל רבי יהודה אומר גואל נתן לבועז </p>\n  \n  <p>תנא קונין <strong>בכלי</strong>  tool אע\"פ שאין בו שוה פרוטה אמר רב נחמן לא שנו אלא בכלי אבל בפירי לא רב ששת אמר אפילו בפירות מאי טעמא דרב נחמן אמר קרא נעלו נעל אין מידי אחרינא לא מאי טעמיה דרב ששת אמר קרא <strong>לקיים כל דבר</strong> לרב נחמן נמי הכתיב לקיים כל דבר ההוא לקיים כל דבר דנקנין במנעל ורב ששת נמי הכתיב נעלו אמר לך רב ששת מה נעלו <strong>דבר המסויים</strong>  en entire object אף כל דבר המסויים לאפוקי חצי רמון וחצי אגוז דלא אמר רב ששת בריה דרב אידי כמאן כתבינן האידנא במנא דכשר למקניא ביה במנא לאפוקי מדרב ששת דאמר קונין בפירות דכשר לאפוקי מדשמואל דאמר קונין <em>דף מז,ב</em> גמרא  במרוקא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the verses we learn which object is regular for the Kinyan Chalipin, tool, whole object, not half object, according to diverses opinions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>למקניא לאפוקי מדלוי דאמר בכליו של מקנה tool from the seller or from the buyer קמ\"ל למקניא ולא לקנויי ביה רב פפא אמר למעוטי מטבע ורב זביד ואיתימא רב אשי אמר למעוטי איסורי הנאה איכא דאמרי ביה אמר רב פפא למעוטי מטבע   not a coin  דכשר אמר רב זביד ואיתימא רב אשי למעוטי איסורי הנאה אבל מוריקא לא אצטריך:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They discute too if the seller or the buyer provides this object. See <a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_soncino.php?ms=Baba-Metzia&df=47a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English translation of the Gemara</a></p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9989/jewish/Chapter-25.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 25:5-10</a>, we find the direct commandment for \"tossing the sandal\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If brothers reside together, and one of them dies having no son, the dead man's wife shall not marry an outsider. [Rather,] her husband's brother shall be intimate with her, making her a wife for himself, thus performing the obligation of a husband's brother with her\n  [...] so that his name shall not be obliterated from Israel.</p>\n  \n  <p>But if the man does not wish to take his brother's wife, the brother's wife shall go up to the gate, to the elders, and say, \"My husband's brother has refused to perpetuate his brother's name in Israel he does not wish to perform the obligation of a husband's brother with me.\"\n  Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him, and he shall stand up and say, \"I do not wish to take her.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Then his brother's wife shall approach him before the eyes of the elders and remove his shoe from his foot. And she shall spit before his face and answer [him] and say, \"Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother's household!\"\n  And that family shall be called in Israel, \"The family of the one whose shoe was removed.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aside from the story of Tamar and Er found in Bereishit 38, I could not find any other occasions. The practice was phased out by the times of the Talmud, thus we find in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l5401.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bechorot 13a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חליצה בראשונה שהיו מתכוונין לשם מצוה ועכשיו שאין מתכוונין לשם מצוה אמרו מצות חליצה קודמת למצות יבום מצות הגאולה באדון הוא קודם לכל אדם שנאמר (ויקרא כז, כז) ואם לא יגאל ונמכר בערכך:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially stating that the practice of Yibbum should be phased out in favor of Halitza. (Sorry for my inability to translate, but that fact can be confirmed by the <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9859-levirate-marriage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Encyclopedia's page on the matter</a> and other reputable sources)</p>\n\n<p>In terms of scholarly articles, one in the Journal of Biblical Literature can be found <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3266188\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and accessed in full by making a free account. Feel free to read it yourself, but it essentially offers two leading opinions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Sandals symbolized authority, thus removing them showed the widow's freedom from her brother-in-law's \"authority\" over her as future husband.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tied in to removing shoes when in mourning, if the brother-in-law refuses to continue on his brother's line, the death becomes even more of a hardship.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Possible reasoning for tossing a sandal after a business deal would thus be related to the ceding of authority. As land was very valuable, removing ones sandals after completing a land transaction was equivalent to ceding one's \"authority\" over the land. By voluntarily handing over this symbol of authority, it could easily show happiness and willingness in regards to a transaction.</p>\n\n\n",

I do not know that they, particularly Rav Moshe himself, took it to the level of a general prohibition on pas palter, but Dovid Feinstein <a href=\"http://matzav.com/rav-dovid-feinstein-a-treife-knife-and-halacha-lemaaseh-on-cholov-yisroel/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">does</a> distinguish pas palter as \"a vadai issur in theory\" (whatever that means for practice, and one might suspect more than nothing.)</p>\n\n<p>The question of whether one has to hold to the opinions of a single moreh hora'ah across the board seems to be a complicated one, but one does need to follow a consistent minhag -- and it seems that the Igros Moshe is generally a pretty good standard-bearer for, if not reflection of, modern (\"modern\") Ashkenazic minhag. So why don't those who hold by his leniency on cholov yisroel hold by his stringency on pas yisroel?* Shouldn't they? </p>\n\n<p>*\n<em>In my experience, few hold by pas yisroel but not cholov yisroel, though the reverse is quite common.</em> </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Igros Moshe (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=919&st=&pgnum=42\">YD 2:33</a>) writes that the common custom is to consume pas palter even where pas yisrael is easily available. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The piece you're quoting says <em>with regards to aseres yemei teshuva</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch writes that those are lenient concerning <em>pas paltar</em> year-round should be strict <em>during the Ten Days of Repentance</em>.

The problem with bread is related to mixed marriage. <strong>Two different concerns</strong>. The Pat Palter seems allowed in Gemara in certain conditions, e.g. when Israel's made bread cannot be found, far from the city. A discussion between Rishonim, based on contradictory suggiot is emphasized <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%91_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch YD 112, 2</a>. Some Rishonim allowed only Pat Palter in special condition only, and some others are allowing all pat palter (we don't want to give a comprehensive explanation) . But following one opinion, the prohibition is entire in some cases, no event cancelled it. </p>\n\n<p>Here concerning pat palter, we can speak about leniency and stringency. Stringency is strongly supported by lecture of the Gemara in AZ 45-47. </p>\n\n<p>But concerning milk, the prohibition was for a fear of unclean animal's milk mixture<sup>(1)</sup> The fact that milk production is nowadays a gigant industry generated new conditions in which no doubt can subsist concerning an eventually mixture of unclean animal's milk into the cow milk. However, as @Yishai mentioned, the Rama (in YD 115, 1) wrote that if there was no Israel from the beginning until the end of milking, despite that the non-Jew has only clean animals in his drove, we prohibit because of Chalav Akum. In other words, there is cases of prohibition without risk of mixture. We found this case in Mordechai (quoted in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bet Yossef</a>) and SMAK. But Bet Yossef read in Mordechai that this case also regards unclean milk from an other place. But most poskim soon this Mordechai as describing <strong>a global Gzera, somewhat enacted  which cannot be canceled</strong> despite changes in reality. See Aruch Hashulchan<sup>(2)</sup>. Indeed, the orthodox communities I know (outside from America) continue the Cholov Shamur Practice. </p>\n\n<p>Following the last view, milk and bread are involved in similar enactment, we can expect that the stringency or leniency in both is expected.

What was their intended meaning? The first word is apparently גֵּאָה, but what is the second word? The plural of יוֹנָה  is יוֹנִים (e.g., Song of Songs 4:1), but “the pride of doves”?</p>\n\n<p>I note that the New JPS Translation, among several others, seem to assume an otherwise unattested word גאיון, meaning “proud”.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra explains it in accord with your reference to the JPS translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיא מלה אחת, כמו עליונים מגזרת גאה</p>\n<p>It is one word, like \"<em>elyonim</em>\" of the group ג-א-ה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ibn Ezra seems to be basing himself on the noun form with \"-<em>on</em>\" suffix that we do find in Tanach - e.g. \"<em>pa'amon</em>\". The particular word may be unattested elsewhere, but the root is attested, including in a similar lexical context in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.31?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>T'hilim</em> 31:19</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תֵּ֥אָלַ֗מְנָה שִׂפְתֵ֫י שָׁ֥קֶר הַדֹּבְר֖וֹת עַל־צַדִּ֥יק עָתָ֗ק בְּ<strong>גַאֲוָ֥ה וָבֽוּז</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rada\"k considers his explanation of \"גְאֵי יוֹנִים\" to supplement a plain meaning such as this. He says the first word is the nominative(?) plural \"<em>g'ei</em>\" (similar to the plural noun it was as one word) which is modified by the plural \"<em>yonim</em>\", as in \"harsh mistreaters\", or \"harsh mishandlers\", or <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Zephaniah.3?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"overbearers\"</a>. This is consistent with his explanation of the related phrase describing a city most understand to be Y'rushalayim in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14261&st=&pgnum=295\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Tz'fanya</em> 3:1</a> as \"<em>ha'ir hayona</em>\", which he explains by comparison to <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Vayikra</em> 25</a>:17, where the verb means \"harshly mistreat\". This is the kind of activity that seems it could very well magnify the arrogance of the proud people in these <em>p'sukim</em>.</p>\n<p>Taking a different approach, <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7741-hirsch-samson-raphael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Hirsch</a> indeed translates the phrase very similarly to your initial suggestion, with \"יונים\" meaning doves. His explanation maintains that the theme of the chapter is \"the sad present in which the spirit is crushed\", but reverses the identification of the גאים as the nation of Israel. This is supported by the fact that the ל preposition after \"בוז\" usually indicates the object of the ביזה.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"the proud among the doves.\" As opposed to the imperious eagles which were the emblems of power and majesty of the nations of the world, the \"dove,\" the symbol of weakness and impotence, is entirely at the mercy of all its enemies. Among all the \"doves,\" among all the weak and powerless peoples of the world, Israel alone had the courage and moral energy to stand up with a calm eye to the eagle-like stare of the high and mighty, to remain erect with unbowed self-confidence, and, despite its lowly position, to sense itself as a great force among the national phenomena of world history. The high and mighty dismissed Israel's self-respect as גאי יונים, \"the poor man's pride\" and they turned away from the Jewish people with contempt.

Conversely, if we find out after the fact that a relative died (drowned at sea or died in the wilderness, for instance) one would presumably engage in the normative processes of mourning.</p>\n\n<p>What is the source for this differentiation in the halachos of mourning for those who chose cremation? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When I was a student at Yeshiva U, I supported my wife and myself by belonging to a chevrah kadisha, a Jewish burial society.   Our job was to prepare male corpses for burial.  (There was a corresponding group of women that prepared female corpses.)   I once walked into a taharah (the process by which we prepared the deceased) and was asked by the rosh (person in charge) if I would do a taharah on someone who was going to be cremated as Rabbi Mordechai Gifter ruled that the chevrah kadisha should refuse to do the taharah.   I went ahead with my participation with the taharah.<br />\nThe next day in class, I asked our teacher, Rabbi Joseph Dov Halevi Soloveitchik, זצוק\"ל, (aka the \"Rav\") what I should have done.   His response was that I had to assume that the family was responsible for ordering the tahara, and that the deceased wanted to be buried according to the halakhah.   In the Rav's words, he wanted to be buried k'dat k'din (according to the halakhah).</p>\n<p>The very next week I was at another taharah where I was told that the deceased had put it in his will that he wanted to be cremated.   Again I went ahead with the tahara.  And again I asked the Rav what should I have done.   His response again was the I had to assume the deceased died b'hezkat kashrut (in a correct frame of mind) and that just before he died, he did t'shuvah (repented) and decided he wanted to be buried k'dat k'din.</p>\n<p>My answer to the questioner is that you have to assume at the very last minute before death, the deceased changed his mind and decided s/he wanted to be buried as our forefathers and foremothers were buried.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It has nothing to do with whether the person had a Jewish burial. As you said, we find plenty of cases in halacha of a person who drowned or was killed in some fashion that a Jewish burial was not available; we still sit shiva. If a Jew slipped and fell into a furnace, God forbid; the family would absolutely sit shiva, even if the body was completely burned up.</p>\n\n<p>I've never heard of such a practice concerning cremation, but if so, it would be based on how someone applied <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9147&st=&pgnum=353&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch YD345:5</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those who deviate from the ways of the community, i.e. people who have thrown off the responsibility of mitzvoth from their shoulders, and are not included in the Jewish people concerning rituals, holidays, synagogues, or schools -- rather, they choose to be \"their own free people, like all the non-Jewish nations\" ... we do not exercise mourning rituals for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some could read that if a Jew ordered that his remains be cremated, he would fall in this category. As sabaHillel quoted, the Munkatcher Rebbe (early 1900s, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=10156&st=&pgnum=87\" rel=\"nofollow\">Minchas Elazar 2:34</a>) has a fiery diatribe against cremation. <code>And it is obvious to anyone who's studied a day that such people have deviated from the ways of the community and don't believe in the resurrection of the dead and any such thing, and should obviously not be mourned!</code> I would point out that a hundred years ago, it was a very harsh, shockingly-deviant-from-the-normal statement for a Jew to sign up for cremation.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously different communities and rabbis will have different readings of who fits the above category. In my humble opinion, someone who went to synagogue on High Holidays; had a Passover seder every year; gave some charity through the Federation; gave their kids a bar/bat mitzvah lessons; and then elected cremation because half the Jews they knew got it? I don't think YD345:5 was talking about them. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The source for this difference is that a person has deliberately transgressed the Will of his creator. We are commanded to treat the body with respect and to bury it in the Earth because it was created from the Earth in order to house the soul. Note that this is <strong>only</strong> when this horrible act is done of the person's own free will (at the request of the person before he died). If it was done through malice (by others) then the ashes can be reburied in a Jewish cemetery as an act of respect towards the mais.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, cremation was regarded as a deliberate attempt to <strong>deny</strong> resurrection of the dead and the coming of the mashiach, if not denial of the very existence of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>There are references that a \"tinok shenishba\" (ignorant through lack of education) can have the ashes reburied. However, the Ohr Sameach \"Ask the Rabbi\" seems to say that even nowadays, one should not sit shiva for anyone who requests cremation. Note that the answer below does not differentiate between cases.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, we see from a number of sources.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/239/Q5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cremation, Consequences</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>according to Jewish law, one should not \"sit shiva\" (observe Jewish\n  mourning rites) for someone who was cremated voluntarily, nor is one\n  obliged to bury their ashes. You will not be able to properly mourn\n  for her, and no kaddish will be said for her. This may have an impact.\n  In addition, the body of a voluntarily cremated person is not liable\n  for resurrection; this is not so much because of the physical\n  impediment, but rather in line with the concept that one who doesn't\n  believe in resurrection will not experience it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Cremation declares that this world is the beginning and end of Man. A\n  basis of Jewish faith is that this is not true. The body is held on\n  deposit, and together with the soul, it really belongs to G-d. G-d\n  decides when and where a person should die, and what should be done\n  with the body once it has fulfilled its \"this-worldly\" purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here are some of the reasons cremation is forbidden with the footnotes pointing to the Halachos involved. These help explain why someone should not sit shivah as explained in footnote <sup>4</sup></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/510874/jewish/Why-does-Jewish-law-forbid-cremation.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why Does Jewish Law Forbid Cremation?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jewish law (\"Halachah\") is unequivocal that the dead must be buried in\n  the earth.<sup>1</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>As a deterrent measure,<sup>2</sup> cremated remains are not interred in a Jewish\n  cemetery.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, we are told that many of the traditional laws\n  of mourning are not observed after the passing of an individual whose\n  body was cremated.<sup>4</sup> Kaddish, however, is recited for such individuals,\n  and it is certainly appropriate to give charity and do mitzvot in\n  memory of their souls.<sup>5</sup></p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Code of Jewish Law, Yorah Deah 348:3; 362:1.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The rabbinic responsibility to institute ordinances to deter people from violating Biblical commands is referenced in Mishna, Avot 1:1;\n  Talmud Yevamot 21a, based on Leviticus 18:30.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Melamed L'hoil Vol 2 #114 (Responsa of Rabbi David Hoffman, 1843-1921, noted German authority on Jewish law.) Whether or not there\n  is an obligation to bury the ashes elsewhere, in order to prevent\n  further disgrace, is the subject of dispute between halachic\n  authorities.</p></li>\n  <li><p>This is based on the principle (quoted in the Code of Jewish Law, Yoreh De'ah 345:5) that we do not mourn after individuals who have\n  \"strayed from the ways of the community\" (Responsa Minchat Elazar vol.\n  2 ch. 34).</p></li>\n  <li><p>Chatam Sofer Responsa (by Rabbi Moses Sofer, 1762-1839, famed rabbi of Pressburg, Slovakia), vol. 3 (Even Ha'ezer 1) ch. 69.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note the seriousness of this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our Sages teach that those who deny the notion of the resurrection\n  will not merit to be resurrected<sup>45</sup> within their own bodies, rather\n  their souls will be enclothed in different bodies when that awaited\n  day arrives.<sup>46</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>Based on this idea, many authorities conclude that a person who opts\n  for cremation is subject to this consequence as well.<sup>47</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>(However, this applies only to such instances where the cremation was\n  done at the behest of the deceased; only in such instances can it be\n  said that the person rejected the notion of the resurrection, etc. Not\n  too long ago six million of our people were denied proper burial, most\n  of them cremated. Without a doubt these holy martyrs will be at the\n  forefront of those who will return during the Messianic Redemption.)</p>\n  \n  <p>45.\n  Mishna, tractate Sanhedrin 10:1.</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"46\">\n  <li><p>See Igrot Kodesh by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, vol. 1 p.142-153.</p></li>\n  <li><p>See Minchat Elazar responsa cited above in footnote 3.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then summarizes the entire discussion and gives a number of reasons why cremation is wrong.

You can read more about Patriarch Blessings from their own website here: <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/topics/patriarchal-blessings?lang=eng\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.lds.org/topics/patriarchal-blessings?lang=eng</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But I'll cite directly from the website concerning what the Patriarchal Blessings says in regards to the lineage aspect of the blessing. : </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Declaration of Lineage: A patriarchal blessing includes a declaration\n  of lineage, stating that the person is of the house of Israel—a\n  descendant of Abraham, belonging to a specific tribe of Jacob.

There are many things, including science, that can expand our appreciation of Hashem but aren't taught in yeshivot. Furthermore, a yeshiva is not supposed to be a place whereby all life skills are acquired e.g. learning a skill for earning a living, which is also crucially important.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that most Rabbanim are not experts in the sciences so it seems inappropriate to ask yeshivas to teach/encourage study in this area specifically. In depth study in science is something that can be acquired in university and personal study. Yeshivot encourage dialectic learning in chavruta, this kind of learning is unique to yeshivas and often gets increasingly difficult when one leaves yeshiva - so utilizing this time for study of Jewish texts in chavruta is a prominent method of study.</p>\n\n<p>What is a shame, from my experience, is that many Rabbanim don't have a basic understanding of science and relevant sources in Jewish literature to discuss the interaction between Torah and Science. Meaning, that once a yeshiva student leaves the yeshiva environment and may study science, the Rabbanim that he relied on previously don't necessarily know how to answer the questions that he may have, and rather than tackle them head on, they are involved in apologetics.</p>\n\n<p>This is, in a sense, a cost benefit analysis; yeshivot would rather not teach outright science than talk about it in a mediocre non-expert manner, where they could run into problems.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "If two kosher witnesses are not specified at a wedding is the marriage valid?",
    "content": "# If two kosher witnesses are not specified at a wedding is the marriage valid?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a wedding ceremony, where many different people are present and many people see a wedding ring (or any item worth a <em>shaveh peruta</em>) being given by the man to the woman, <strong>do two kosher witnesses need to be uniquely specified as being witnesses?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>If no witnesses are <em>specified</em></strong>, but there are certainly two (or more) people that fit the description of a kosher witness and are present, can this be taken as 'testimony'<strong>despite there being other non-kosher witnesses</strong> (or invalid mixes of kosher witnesses, e.g. relatives) witnessing this event? If no kosher witness-pair is specified,_does the whole group become one witnessing entity that is then invalidated__ by the presence of 'witnesses' who are not kosher, or are kosher witness-pairs within the crowd considered a valid witnessing pair?</p>\n\n<p>This kind of scenario may arise in an irreligious 'wedding party' where some kosher-for-witnessing guests are invited, but the main body of guests are not religious i.e invalid witnesses. In such a wedding party a man may very well give a woman a ring (and vice versa) and declare that he wants to be married to her (as evidenced by the massive party they throw (!) and that they live or will be living together with assumed marital relations). In such a case, are pairs of kosher-witnesses dotted around the room witnessing this, enough to make this marriage valid (albeit in a not le'chatchila manner) despite the passive nature of the eidim? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is from a shiur that my Rav gave which involved a case that he brought up as a participant. As a result, this is from memory.</p>\n\n<p>That is why the Brisker will announce two aidim excluding everyone else. My rav was at a wedding and found out that the two aidim were relatives. He was not able to inform the mesader kedushim (privately) until after after the mesder kedushim made that announcement. The mesader kedushin told my rav and the other two (in a whisper so as not to embarrass anyone) that he and my rav would be the witnesses to the exclusion of anyone else. He then continued with the four of them standing there.</p>\n\n<p>There are people who were told to shut their eyes if they have to go to a Reform wedding just in case the couple get divorced. I believe that was advice from Rav Moshe Feinstein.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a case in Business Halacha newsletter that it is only witnesses who are called to testify that would invalidate the group. Thus, the implication is that the kosher witnesses would be valid if only they are called to testify as to what they saw. However, that fear is the source of the Brisk minhag. This way only the kosher witnesses are allowed to testify.</p>\n\n<p>I also recall a gemara where three people come to testify about the new moon, and one of them is invalid, then bais din can call the two valid witnesses to certify the new moon.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @kouty for pointing the link to <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x8816\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat 36:1</a> pages 62b to 64b</p>\n\n<p><em>My paraphrase in English</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a group of aidim (more than two) testify and one of them is pasul\n  or a relative, then the entire testimony is invalidated. This is only\n  in the case were they all intended to testify. However, if the invalid\n  aidim did not intend to testify, then the testimony is valid.</p>\n  \n  <p>Bais Din checks into the matter by asking if at the time they\n  witnessed the matter they intended to testify in court or just to\n  see what was happening. Bais din then examines those who intended to\n  testify in court. If one of the invalid\n  aidim is in that group then the testimony is invalid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end of that Halacha we see:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another way of expressing the matter, even if he observed the matter\n  in order to testify, he will not invalidate the testimony unless he\n  actually came to bais din and testified, since bais din only requires\n  two witnesses and they testified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rama gives more details and the Mechaber then continues</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the plaintiff has called kosher witnesses to testify, even if the\n  invalid witnesses are present and want to testify, they cannot\n  invalidate the testimony</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<h2>Prerequisite</h2>\n\n<p>I will try to explain the problems. first some sources. Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat, Hilchot Edut, 36, stated laws about numerous persons who did testimony and one of them was relative or unfit. But for a better understanding, we will begin from Mishna.\n<strong>Mishna Maccot 1, 7-8:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עַל פִּי שְׁנַיִם עֵדִים אוֹ שְׁלשָׁה עֵדִים יוּמַת הַמֵּת (דברים יז),\n  אִם מִתְקַיֶּמֶת הָעֵדוּת בִּשְׁנַיִם, לָמָּה פָרַט הַכָּתוּב\n  בִּשְׁלשָׁה, ... ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>A verse says that the testimony recquires two or three witnesses, what must we learn from the word \"three\"?</p>\n  \n  <p>מַה שְּׁנַיִם נִמְצָא אַחַד מֵהֶן קָרוֹב אוֹ פָסוּל עֵדוּתָן בְּטֵלָה\n  , אַף שְׁלשָׁה נִמְצָא אֶחָד מֵהֶן קָרוֹב אוֹ פָסוּל, עֵדוּתָן\n  בְּטֵלָה. ‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>As well as if one of two witnesses is parent or unfit, the testimony is rejected, as well, if one of the three is, the testimony is rejected.</p>\n  \n  <p>מִנַּיִן אֲפִלּוּ מֵאָה, תַּלְמוּד לוֹמַר, עֵדִים. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>We learn from the verse that the rule is the same even if the witnesses are hundred and one of them is unfit or relative.</p>\n  \n  <p>אָמַר\n  רַבִּי יוֹסֵי, בַּמֶּה דְבָרִים אֲמוּרִים, בְּדִינֵי נְפָשׁוֹת. ‏\n  אֲבָל\n  בְּדִינֵי מָמוֹנוֹת, תִּתְקַיֵּם הָעֵדוּת בַּשְּׁאָר. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yosse limited this rule to cases of criminal affairs,  no problem for business law. Rashi explained this following the general halachic tendency to searsh how to avoid death penalty.  RI explained that in business one witness alone can change the din,  contrarily  to  criminal affairs which need entire group of two witnesses, this is a sign of weakeness of criminal testimony. </p>\n  \n  <p>רַבִּי אוֹמֵר,\n  אֶחָד דִּינֵי מָמוֹנוֹת וְאֶחָד דִּינֵי נְפָשׁוֹת. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yehuda Hanassi, rejected Rabbi Yose's restriction.</p>\n  \n  <p>בִּזְמַן שֶׁהִתְרוּ\n  בָהֶן, אֲבָל בִּזְמַן שֶׁלֹּא הִתְרוּ בָהֶן, מַה יַּעֲשׂוּ שְׁנֵי\n  אַחִין שֶׁרָאוּ בְאֶחָד שֶׁהָרַג אֶת הַנָּפֶשׁ: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore he defined a own restriction concerning the rule application, in cases in which the the Kasher and  the unfit witnesses were intentionally together <strong>to alert the alleged perpetrator</strong> . E.G. if two brothers were witnesses of a assassination scene,, the perpetrator will never be condemned, despite other regular witnesses?  If only one of the brothers made the alert (with a third person, also a witness but non relative), in this case his brother  will  not  disturb the  testimony.  Rashi explained that this last rule is specific to criminal laws ( because the reference to alrrt which is necessary for criminal laws only). The gemara ruled as Rabbi Yehuda Hanassi. The Rosh in responsa 60, 5 said that to testimony is a duty in such a case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosfot asked: For Rabbi Yossi, who doesn't agree with this last restriction, how can we validate testimony on Get, which is public, in presence of relatives? He answered in name of Rabbenu Itschaq  that the rules of disqualification are only for witnesses who go to testimony in bet din (making punishment testimony {performative testimony}), but for their presence at time of the action only they don't disqualify. He rad th wordscof Rabbi Yehuda in the Mishna, as applyed in the case in which both brothers were comming in Bet Din. And tosfot adds in two places that even with a later appearence at court they disqualifie the testimony of Kasher witnesses.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfot answered that the presence of unfit witnesses don't disturb the regular testimony if they are not associated to the fit witnesses on bet din ( or Perhaps on the Get signature).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37946&st=&pgnum=15&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tosfot Yom Tov on the mishna</a> said that the  answer of Tosfot is not valuable for Rishonim who  think that at time of seeing only they already cancel the future testimony of the Kasher witnesses ( Rashi, Rambam for instance). </p>\n\n<p>He answered that if the relatives or infit witnesses didn't come toch kede dibbur after the Kasher group, they cannot disqualify the group ( against Tosfot opinion). For a testimony which is not linked to going at bet din,  as Get testimony, Tosfot yom Tov answered for Rambam and Rashi and Bartenura, following the SMA that the pre-selection of witnesses at seeing time excludes all enlargement of the witnesses group. The unfit and relatives are excluded by pre-selection. For this novelty a source is needed, Perhaps, later we would discuss this.</p>\n\n<p>In Gemara, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבא, הכי אמרי' להו: למיחזי <strong>אתיתו</strong> או לאסהודי אתיתו? ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Judges ask them,  why did you come  there to see only or to testimony? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Coming where?  <strong>Rashi</strong>, Ramban and Rosh said that <strong>judges ask unfit witnesses</strong>. <strong>Rabbenu Chayim Kohen</strong> said that <strong>they ask Kasher witnesses</strong>. The words of Rambam in chapter 5 of Edut are a condensation of the statement of Rabbi and the statement of Rava.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfot explained that rava stated for business laws {I understand that Tosfot included with this words all testimony which needs no alert (Azhara) and Rambam also explains as this.</p>\n\n<p>For Rabbi Yosse who ruled the rule of one witness who disqualify two good witnesses, in criminal law, without hatraa (the witness does not disturb if he did not alert), a relative can come and say that he was there as voluntary witness. Rav Chayim Kohen answered that we ask the good witnesses if they was associated with him. Tosfot Yom Tom answer that after kede dibbur he is not associated to the good group.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x8817\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shach SA CM 36 sk 5</a> rejected the Rav Chayim Kohen's chiddush and regarded it as incongruent with most Rishonim. He answered that when the unfit witnesses are comming after the good testimony, they cannot cancel the good testimony, excepted cases in which their presence at the time of seeing fact was already known by Bet Din.  So, separation of groups excludes problems of relative or unfit combination to the goog group as Tosfot Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The hearth of the matter</h2>\n\n<p>Now let's read poskim Acharonim. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x8819\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Shach CM 36, end of sk 8</a> adressed the problem of the OP</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לדידן העידנא פשיטא דכשר דהא <strong>מזמינים עדים כשרים מיוחדים לכך</strong> ואם כן פשיטא דהקרובים אינם מכוונים להעיד דאפילו יכוונו להעיד אינו פוסל דכיון דמזמינים עדים לכך הרי <strong>אנו מוציאים כל האחרים מכלל העדות</strong> ולאו כל כמיניהו דקרובים ופסולים להיות עדות בעל כרחנו וכך כתב מה\"ר פרץ בהגהות סמ\"ק סימן קפ\"ג. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shach said generally relatives are not here to testimony because they know their unfitness. He adds that the witnesses must to be pre-selected, and through this pre-selection,  we exclude all additional witnesses from the witnesses group. {accordin to this,  the case cited in the answer of @sabbahillel needs explanations}. Mefarshim reported that Mahari Ben Lev treat the case in which a non pre-selected witness come spontaneously to testimony. see Ramban quoted in Shach bellow, it seems that a spontaneous intervention is not avoidable {may be against the opinion of Rav Chayim Kohen in tosfot quoted above, which give to the Kasher wtinesses the right to select with who they were.}.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Q:</h3>\n  \n  <p><code>do two kosher witnesses need to be uniquely specified as being\n  witnesses?</code> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>A --> Yes.</h3>\n\n<p>It is a good practice, lechatechilla. The advantage is to avoid addition of unfit witnesses or relatives (SMA, TYT and SHACH encourage this practice, in the further stuff, we see that Ramban himself report this practice)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let's read further the Shach.</p>\n  \n  <p>ועוד יש לומר דמסתמא לא חיישינן שכיוונו\n  להעיד והא דאמרינן בש\"ס <strong>היכי אמרינן להו היינו כשבאין אחר כך מעצמן לבית\n  דין להעיד</strong> אבל כל זמן שלא באו לבית דין לא חיישינן להכי וכך כתב <strong><em>הרמב\"ן</em></strong>\n  בחידושיו פרק יש נוחלין שם במסקנתו, וזה לשונו ומעשים בכל יום בקידושין\n  וכתובות כו' ואפשר לומר שכל זמן שלא באו לבית דין מסתמא הקרובים לא\n  כיוונו להעיד והתם מפני שבאו לבית דין הם צריכים לישאל אלא  שאינו מנהג\n  אלא לזַמֵּן שם שנים כשרים להיות עדים ולא השאר עד כאן לשונו... ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The question of the Gemara \"how do we ask the witnesses?\" is only for\n  witnesses who enter the Bet Din. The Ramban writted this in Chidushin\n  Baba Batra perek Yesh Nochalim. He concluded that without spontaneous intervention of relatives in Bet Din,  we believe that relative persons were present only as not witnesses but spectators. Ramban also mentionned the practice of witnesses pre-selection.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Q</h3>\n  \n  <p><code>If no witnesses are specified, but there are certainly two (or\n  more) people that fit the description of a kosher witness and are\n  present, can this be taken as 'testimony' despite there being other\n  non-kosher witnesses (or invalid mixes of kosher witnesses, e.g.\n  relatives) witnessing this event?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>A --> Yes</h3>\n\n<p>According to the first words of Ramban, we believe that the unfit and relatives were here to show only. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>Q</h3>\n  \n  <p><code>are kosher witness-pairs within the crowd considered a valid\n  witnessing pair?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Even Haezer 42, 4 in Rama.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואפילו ייחד עדים יכולים אחרים שראו המעשה להעיד (ריב״ש סימן\n  תע״ט)‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Despite that a first group of witnesses were selected, we can use a second group (from Tshuvot Rivash) but they need to see accurately the transaction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See in the same Sayif also <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7654\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pitche Teshuva EH 42, sk 11</a> in name of the <a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95\"%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%9D_%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8?markasread=365491\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shut Chatam Sofer Even Haezer 100</a> mentioned by @Double AA a recomandation to pre-select witnesses for Kiddushin because for this kind of testimony there is no difference between to coming to look or to testimony. This tradition is reported in CS in name of Ritba. One of the Chidushim of this Chatam Sofer Responsa is that The Chatan an d Kalla are considered as they said that they want only Kasher witnesses to perform the Kinyan Kiddushin, and so they pre-exclude all to a unfit or relative witnesses, even if those witnesses was choose by the mesader Kiddushin. The Chatam Sofer make a difference in nama of the avne Miluim between Kidushin testimony and other testimonies. The Kiddushin tesimony is not only a testimony of the transaction but a part of it. He pointed that Tosfot in Makkot asked only about Gittin, not about Kiddushin.</p>\n\n<h3>A --> Yes</h3>\n\n<p>No mention is made that in a such case we need to ask them if they were intentionally wanted to testimony. They need to see the ring giving and hear the marriage statement \"hare at mekudeshet li...\". (I don't speak about an other kind of testimony, e.g. testimony that one woman is married). So the case of sabbahillel is understood.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I will first reorganize the multiple questions included in the OP.<br>\n1. Would the <strong>simultaneous presence of kasher and non kasher</strong> lead them to be a mixed group of witnesses in which applies the rule followin which disqualifying a part of the group <strong>results in a whole disqualifying</strong> of the group?<br>\n2. Is it possible to <strong>counter this problem by declaring that only two preselected</strong> witnesses are authorized to testimony?<br>\n3. <strong>If the presence of good witnesses was  not  really a choice for the couple</strong>  who wanted a non religious  marriage,  may  this presence make the kiddushin valuable?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>After a brief study (in SA CM 36, 1 and EH 42, 4 with commentaries, a study of Gemara Makkoth 6a, and additional rishonim in Shas kiddushin 43a BB 114a, Sanhedrin 9a,  thanks  to @DoubleAA I read also shut chatam sofer EH 100) , I will try a synthetic  answer.<br>\n1. Regarding the <strong>special status of kiddushin testimony</strong>  the presence of unfit witnesses doesn't interfere.  But the Chatan and Kalla must to know that the witnesses are here and are testimonying.  They want to combine this testimony to the ring giving as a part of the marriage act.  This testimony is not categorized as proof only but as a part of transaction doing.  No interference of unfit witnesses is possible.  This kind of testimony must be distinguished from a testimony in bet din that Avraham and Sarah was married.<br>\n2. We can counter the mixture  of good and bad witnesses by preselection in cases that it is needed  and make a separate  group. But this method,  if used wrongly,  cannot damage.  For instance <strong>if one of the selected witnesses is relative</strong> to the kalla,  the value of other non selected good witnesses remains and they will replace the relative.<br>\n3.  In non religious marriage the couple generally want a regular or at least are not opposed to it.  So,  the  presence  a couple  of good  witnesses has full  effectiveness even if they were not intentionally selected.  But in an hypothetic <strong>case  in which Chatan and Kalla was persued that no good  witnesses are here</strong>,  the good  witnesses are ineffective as if they was dissimulated. </p>\n\n\n",

Despite Avrahams\n  effort, purposes and bargain, HaShem turns these off every single\n  time. A fair question seems to be: \"What was the purpose of this\n  conversation, if HaShem already knew that there wouldn't be any\n  tzaddikim within (their midst of) the city?\" A lesson that could be\n  learned it that this converation wasn't ment for HaShem, but for\n  Avraham. HaShem confronts Avraham with the reality of this world, and\n  Avraham stuggles with this reality presented to him by HaShem: \"How\n  can I accept this\", Avraham seems to say: \"A world in which the\n  tzaddikim and innocent die with the godless people?\" </p>\n  \n  <p>One day Avraham has the guts to argue with HaShem about the\n  destruction of Sodom, and the next He's just watching it all happening\n  without giving a single kick. What has happened? It seems to be that\n  Avraham accepted the will of HaShem. The place Sodom isn't changed,\n  but Avraham is changed, by accepting a different perspective, a change\n  of view. I once learned from Bereshit 19:27 that the place where\n  Avraham stood, was a special place where he used to pray, and Rabbi\n  Yosef Chaim theaches that 'the place' wasn't a fysical place, but his\n  heart. Avraham had a change of heart, a change of mind, in which his\n  perception changed because he accepted the reality presented by\n  HaShem. </p>\n  \n  <p>Prayer is often about changing ourselves, but beside changing\n  ourselves, it's also about changing our perspective or accepting G-ds\n  will..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>How does one - like Avraham - accomplish such a change or accept through prayer?</strong> (See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/posts/76496/edit\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/posts/76496/edit</a>). </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr :</strong> The Jewish tradition - be it the Torah, the Nevi'im, or the Rabinnical literature - is full of stories of <em>not</em> accepting HaShem's perspective, but aspiring HaShem to accept <em>our</em> perspective. </p>\n\n<p><em>Some</em> sources - not all - conclude that once we come to understand that HaShem is refusing to accept our prayer and that this refusal is an irrevocable edict, then we should reconcile ourself to HaShem decree. </p>\n\n<p>[P.S. - Please excuse me for my grammar (I'm Hebrew native), and feel free to edit for correcting it.]</p>\n\n<p>Here are several examples:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Moshe Rabbeinu</strong></p>\n\n<p>Moshe begged Hashem to let him enter Eretz Israel in spite of HaShem telling him that it is a punishment for its sin in Mey Meriva.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...ג, כג וָאֶתְחַנַּן, אֶל-יְהוָה, בָּעֵת הַהִוא, לֵאמֹר.</p>\n  \n  <p>ג,כה אֶעְבְּרָה-נָּא, וְאֶרְאֶה אֶת-הָאָרֶץ הַטּוֹבָה, אֲשֶׁר, בְּעֵבֶר הַיַּרְדֵּן:  הָהָר הַטּוֹב הַזֶּה, וְהַלְּבָנֹן.</p>\n  \n  <p>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying: (...) \n  Let me go over, I pray Thee, and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly hill-country, and Lebanon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Midrash has some very intriguing, lengthy interpretations for these Psukim:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Midrash Dvarim Rabbah, Parash Yod-Aleph (Vezot Habracha), is saying that Moshe prayed 515 Tefilot (Gimartia of ואתחנן) and \"made earth and skies shake\", got refused prayer after prayer after prayer, but still didn't stop praying, trying to find the path to made its prespective be accepted. Only after he got refused for requesting HaShem to \"leave him as an animal\", and then \"as merely a bird\", he was left with no possibility but to accept the Din and bless HaShem:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיון שראה משה, שאין בריה יכולה להצילו מדרך המות, באותה שעה אמר: הצור\n  תמים פעלו כי כל דרכיו משפט אל אמונה ואין עול צדיק וישר הוא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/raba5/11.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">[source</a> of the above, in Hebrew]</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Midrash Tanchuma, Siman Vav (Va'etchanan), is saying that after Moshe got a refusal from HaShem, he went to asking the forces of nature to pass its prayers to HaShem, so that it may get accepted this way.

So Moshe sits there, listening to Yehoshua teaching, but simply can't understand its teachings!

(...) וְהִיא, מָרַת נָפֶשׁ; וַתִּתְפַּלֵּל עַל-יְהוָה, וּבָכֹה תִבְכֶּה.<br>\n  (...) she was in bitterness of soul--and prayed unto the LORD, and wept\n  sore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Talmud (Brachot, 31b) says that \"prayed unto the LORD\" means that she spoke insolently toward HaShem (\"הטיחה דברים כלפי מעלה\").</p>\n\n<p>Note also something interesting: Her husband tries to convince her to let go:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א,ח. (...) וַיֹּאמֶר לָהּ אֶלְקָנָה אִישָׁהּ, חַנָּה לָמֶה תִבְכִּי וְלָמֶה לֹא תֹאכְלִי, וְלָמֶה, יֵרַע לְבָבֵךְ:  הֲלוֹא אָנֹכִי טוֹב לָךְ, מֵעֲשָׂרָה בָּנִים.<br>\n  'Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy\n  heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>while Pnina, Elkana's second wife, acts to make her angry and cause her to cry, so that its prayer will be accepted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א,ו. וְכִעֲסַתָּה צָרָתָהּ גַּם-כַּעַס, בַּעֲבוּר הַרְּעִמָהּ:  כִּי-סָגַר יְהוָה, בְּעַד רַחְמָהּ.</p>\n  \n  <p>And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because the LORD had\n  shut up her womb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And time has passed (months? years? dozens of years? it it ambiguous: \"וַיְהִי לִתְקֻפוֹת הַיָּמִים\"), and finally HaShem accepted her prayer. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Job</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, no need to make things long: HaShem lets Satan hit Job, and Job demanded an answer: Why does he deserved it. \nAnd while his wife told me to let go, surrender to his suffering and death (\"ברך אלוהים ומות\"), and his friends told him he probably have sinned, and that he can't speak to HaShem the way he does for more than 30 Prakim, HaShem finally reveals to him. And though rebuking him, Job has stands to its arguments, and there's an interesting discussion, though very unclear, between Job and HaShem for the following Prakim. Does Job accept HaShem's Din? hard to say with certainty.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rabbi Hama Bar Hanina</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's an interesting saying of Rabbi Hama Bar Hanina (Brachot, 32b), concluding a short discussion, that in my interpretation regards the question: Should we keep praying if we see that our prayer is not answered? \nTwo different opinions are presented, but the Talmud chooses to conclude the disccussion with a saying in the name of Rabbi Hama Bar Hanina, supporting only one of these opinions, namely: Keep praying: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר חנין א\"ר חנינא כל המאריך בתפלתו אין תפלתו חוזרת ריקם מנא לן ממשה\n  רבינו שנא' (דברים ט) ואתפלל אל ה' וכתיב בתריה וישמע ה' אלי גם בפעם\n  ההיא איני והא א\"ר חייא בר אבא א\"ר יוחנן כל המאריך בתפלתו ומעיין בה סוף\n  בא לידי כאב לב שנא' (משלי יג) תוחלת ממושכה מחלה לב מאי תקנתיה יעסוק\n  בתורה שנא' (משלי יג) ועץ חיים תאוה באה ואין עץ חיים אלא תורה שנאמר\n  (משלי ג) עץ חיים היא למחזיקים בה לא קשיא הא דמאריך ומעיין בה הא דמאריך\n  ולא מעיין בה א\"ר חמא בר' חנינא אם ראה אדם שהתפלל ולא נענה יחזור ויתפלל\n  שנאמר (תהילים כז) קוה אל ה' חזק ויאמץ לבך וקוה אל ה':</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note, however, that this discussion doesn't say \"How long/much should we pray\", nor \"How should we know that our prayer won't be accepted\", nor \"Once we understand our prayer won't be accepted, we should accept HaShem decree\".</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sins mentioned in Yom Kippur davening\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the service of Yom Kippur, there are a series of lists of sins which are accounted for. Vayikra 16:16 says that the Kohen, when he sacrificed the he-goat, brought about atonement on behalf of the people for \"וְכִפֶּר עַל הַקֹּדֶשׁ מִטֻּמְאֹת בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל וּמִפִּשְׁעֵיהֶם לְכָל חַטֹּאתָם\", \" from the defilements of the children of Israel and from their rebellions and all their unintentional sins.\" (text from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9917\">http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9917</a>).</p>\n\n<p>When the Kohen does a confession on the other goat which he will send into the wilderness, he confesses upon it (16:21): \"וְהִתְוַדָּה עָלָיו אֶת כָּל עֲו‍ֹנֹת בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל וְאֶת כָּל פִּשְׁעֵיהֶם לְכָל חַטֹּאתָם \", \"confess upon it all the willful transgressions of the children of Israel, all their rebellions, and all their unintentional sins\". This confession adds a category, \"avonot\" which were not included in the list of sins atoned for by the sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>The next verse, when summarizing, says about the confessed-upon-goat, \"וְנָשָׂא הַשָּׂעִיר עָלָיו אֶת כָּל עֲו‍ֹנֹתָם\", \"The he goat shall thus carry upon itself all their sins\" listing ONLY the avonot.</p>\n\n<p>As if this isn't confusing enough for me, in the Musaf service, we recite the text of the confession which the Kohen said (text from Mishna <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h25.htm\">Yoma</a>, 6:2) \" והתוודה.  וכך היה אומר, אנא ה'--עוו פשעו וחטאו לפניך עמך, בית ישראל; אנא ה'--כפר נא לעוונות ולפשעים ולחטאים, שעוו ושפשעו ושחטאו לפניך עמך, בית ישראל:\"</p>\n\n<p>This confession lists all 3 categories but then quotes a verse (16:30) \"כִּי בַיּוֹם הַזֶּה יְכַפֵּר עֲלֵיכֶם לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם מִכֹּל חַטֹּאתֵיכֶם\", \"you shall be cleansed from all your sins\" with only 1 category being listed, \"chet.\"</p>\n\n<p>I know that the gemara discusses the <a href=\"http://www.torahinmotion.org/discussions-and-blogs/yoma-36-what-sin-comes-first\">order</a> of the wording of the sins, but there seems to be a discrepancy between the language/categories listed as sins confessed, covered by sacrifice, carried by the goat and ultimately atoned for in the various texts. Is there a resource to untangle the level of sins and explain what is included in each action?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It sounds like what you are looking for is all found in the ten chapters of Mishnah Torah, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Repentance.1?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Teshuvah</a>. It seems to cover everything you are inquiring about in the last paragraph of your question.

This info was told to me by someone working in the OU and supported by my local Orthodx rav (I won't mention his name, but he is also on my local Va'ad Harabbanim).</p>\n\n<p>When the coffee creamer was first served at Jewish weddings, there was a concern of <em>mar'it ayin</em> (if that's the correct term to use, here), because not enough people knew about this product. Mashgichim (kosher supervisors) instructed waiters to specifically place the Rich's container on the table and not pour the creamer into a glass or metal unmarked container. By seeing the product in the container, anyone who suspected that this was dairy could read the ingredients and verify that, in fact, this was non-dairy. After several years, as people became accustomed to this product, the <em>marit ayin</em> concept was no longer there, and caterers were allowed to pour the product into their own containers and place that on the table.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can, then make the analogy to the beef fry. I think that the majority of the religious community understands that when they buy a meat product having a trustworthy certification and coming from a trustworthy place, the name of the product doesn't matter and this is not <em>marit ayin</em>. That's my opinion in comparing this with the above, but verify with your local rav and / or mashgiach.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was quail available on Shabbat in the desert?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In reading the story about the manna, we see the following (all are in Shemot (Ex.) 16, so I'll just mention the verses:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14126&st=&pgnum=234\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 12</a> G-d says that in the evening they will eat meat and in the morning be satiated with bread.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14126&st=&pgnum=238\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 22</a> People collect a double portion on the 6th day; the elders wonder what's happening. It mentions that they took a double portion of man (implied by usage of the term \"bread\" in the verse.) Did they take a double portion of quail, too? (Not something apparent in the verse.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14126&st=&pgnum=240\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 23</a> In explaining things, Moses speaks in general terms by saying cook and bake today, and leave the left-over for tomorrow. He doesn't mention specifically the word \"man\". So is this commandment general meaning that he implied cooking the quail as well, since there would be none of that the next day?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14126&st=&pgnum=242\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 27</a> some people go out to gather. The verse does not say WHAT they were looking to gather. It seems to be just mahn, but, perhaps, quail was implied, as well?</p>\n\n<p>[verse 29] Moses says, don't go out on Shabbat. He also says that this is why on the 6th day G-d gave a double portion of <strong>bread</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>My analysis: It looks like there was no double portion of quail given on the sixth day, as there are a few verses that mention that the double portion was of mahn, only. However, what doesn't seem clear is if on Shabbat, they had meat (quail) at all, or they had to make the 6th day's portion of quail last through Shabbat or not eat any quail at all on Shabbat. (There is no implication anywhere on how much quail they could gather each day, or that the quail would spoil by leaving it over to the next day.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I read it the other way. That this is a special occurrence and it is only the man that was daily. Otherwise the later complaints that were answered with quail would not have happened and the quail would not have been an appropriate answer (and rebuke as in Kivros Hata'avah) </p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The quails were thrown to them in the camp itself</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the quails, which were sent to them, not as a blessing, but only to teach them that Hashem had noted their complaints. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would imply also that it was meant to be a one time occurance to teach them a lesson. In fact, since they did not need the lesson until the next set of complaints, it seems that at least some of the lesson stuck.</p>\n\n<p>ArtScroll cites Ramban that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After having said earlier that the daily portion of <em>manna</em> was\n  unrelated to the demand, Hashem now responded to the people, and by\n  referring to their request as a <em>complaint</em>, He let them know that\n  their anger displayed a lack of faith in Hashem and His prophet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I read this as well, it means that it was a one time lesson that they were supposed to learn and amend their behavior.</p>\n\n\n",

The Bnai Yisrael as newly freed slaves were basically infants with the implications and behaviors that immaturity brings. I go into some detail at <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2012/04/beshalach-why-israel-sinned-in-desert.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beshalach: Why Israel sinned in the desert - childishness and immaturity.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The commentators have been pointing out that בני ישראל are compared to\n  children when they went into the desert after the Exodus. Many, Jews\n  and nonJews, religious and nonreligious, have used this analogy to\n  explain what happened. In fact, that is why the term used is always\n  translated as \"Children of Israel\".</p>\n  \n  <p>As Yirmiyahu says in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15999#showrashi=true&v=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 2 pasuk 2</a></p>\n  \n  <p>ב  הָלֹךְ וְקָרָאתָ בְאָזְנֵי יְרוּשָׁלִַם לֵאמֹר, כֹּה אָמַר יְהוָה, זָכַרְתִּי לָךְ חֶסֶד נְעוּרַיִךְ, אַהֲבַת\n  כְּלוּלֹתָיִךְ לֶכְתֵּךְ אַחֲרַי בַּמִּדְבָּר, בְּאֶרֶץ לֹא זְרוּעָה</p>\n  \n  <p>2: Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the LORD: I\n  remember for thee the affection of thy youth, the love of\n  thine espousals; how thou wentest after Me in the wilderness, in a\n  land that was not sown.</p>\n  \n  <p>For example, Dennis Prager, a modern radio talk show host used this\n  analogy in 1996 to explain why the Exodus is unique. Only then did\n  Hashem actively and obviously intervene on a national level with open\n  miracles in this way. Even the open miracles of the desert and the\n  miracles in the time of Yehoshua can be connected to this. All other\n  miracles were either hidden or individual. Even the miracle of the\n  altar of Elijah was relatively restricted and for a specific\n  circumstance. Actually, the fact that the sacrifice was burnt by \"the\n  fire of Hashem\" was considered a normal response by a \"god\" rather\n  than a miracle. Similarly, the sins of the Bnei Yisroel in the desert\n  from the beginning to through the  חטא העל (Golden Calf) can be\n  attributed to the fact that as newly freed slaves they were indeed\n  immature \"children\". Indeed, the חטא המרגלים (sin of the Spies) can be\n  considered in the same way as an expression of childishness. The\n  punishment for that can therefore be considered a necessity of our\n  having to mature before we could progress to the next stage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Limits of Free Thinking\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is one allowed to trust his own views regarding reality if they conflict with the view of chazal? Where does one draw the line on this?</p>\n\n<p>I am not asking on things which are 100% proven such as that the earth is round or that it revolves around the sun. But rather on things not 100% clear cut.</p>\n\n<p>for example, chazal say everything in the universe was created for man's sake (Midrash Kohelet 7:13). Is one allowed to follow his own personal views (ex.dark matter whose function is not 100% known) thus rejecting the words of chazal due to his own \"free thinking\" opinion?</p>\n\n<p>As another example, Chazal tell us design proves the existence of a designer (<a href=\"http://www.vilnagaon.org/book/akiva.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">midrash</a> of Rabbi Akiva and the garment in Temurah 3) and that this is the reality. </p>\n\n<p>Is one allowed to deny this claim based on his own views and trusting the speculation of scientists. Can we assume just like Chazal were seemingly wrong about the sun revolving around the earth then we don't need to assume any other claims they make about reality?</p>\n\n<p>should one assume chazal were right unless proven 100% to the contrary. Or can one go after his own views even on things not proven to the contrary?</p>\n\n<p>please source</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To start, a belief in the infallibility of Chazal is not one of the Rambam's thirteen principles of faith, nor is it part of any other system of fundamental beliefs (as far as I know). So you are safe from charges of heresy.</p>\n\n<p>However, you may not be safe in the next world. The question here is where does free thinking cross the line of \"mevazeh divrei chachamim\", belittling the wisdom of the sages? And the converse is (and this is your question) - does respecting the wisdom of the sages mean we are not allowed to think?</p>\n\n<p>It should be pretty obvious that we are allowed to think (sorry, I guess that's not obvious...) and that as soon as we start thinking about the world we are bound to entertain ideas which conflict with a straight reading of the word of Chazal. Free thinking requires an ability to think hold in mind two conflicting ideas or statements until you can resolve them. </p>\n\n<p>To take your example, you see a conflict between dark matter in the universe and Chazal's statement that everything was created for man's sake. If you reject Chazal based on your understanding of dark matter I would say that that is belittling the wisdom of Chazal. It also means you are not gaining any insight from Chazal, and that might be worse. So let's move along by putting the words of Chazal \"on the side\" - we do not know how to interpret them, but without rejecting them. Now you can say \"I know of dark matter, I believe it has nothing to do with man, and I leave open the question of what Chazal meant by saying that all was created for man's sake.\" Now you have free-thought, but without rejecting or belittling the words of Chazal.</p>\n\n<p>Before continuing, I will point out that I think your example was needlessly dismissive of Chazal, and also that it should not really be called free-thinking. Both problems, and the fact that you find a challenge here in free-thinking, come from an unduly bland reading of both Chazal, and of the reality of dark matter. I know nothing about dark matter, and, unless you are a astrophysicist, you also know almost nothing about dark matter, because almost nothing is known about it. Therefore, there is no way, based on the reality of dark matter, to say if it does or does not affect humanity, and no way to form an opinion if it was necessary or not for mankind. On the other hand, there is nothing in the statement \"all was made for man's sake\" which tells us that everything in the universe is to be directly utilized by man, and obviously there is much which does not directly serve us, and Chazal were well aware of that.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can go back and ask what Chazal meant when they said \"all was created for man's sake\", and it is clear that it cannot mean that we are meant to utilize everything in the world. It is easiest to interpret it along the lines that everything in the world, one way or another, had to be there, so that humanity could arise and flourish as it did. This includes a massive galaxy that can serve as a host to our star which can then host our planet. This includes earthly phenomena which do not directly serve us, but are necessary results of the laws of physics which give us the world we know.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal are not teaching science with this statement. They are giving us a perspective on the world, and teaching us how to look at the entire creation from a human-centric perspective. Understood like this, there is no conflict at all between this statement and science. We can now bring back the statement of Chazal which we \"put on the side\" before, with a better understanding, and now turn back to dark matter. We do know enough about dark matter to say that the universe as we know it would unravel without it, and then there would be no galaxy and no solar system and no earth and no humanity, and therefore God created dark matter for the emergence of the world and for the sake of man.</p>\n\n<p>So to answer your question, the limit of free thinking is the limit of your ability to consider your idea without rejecting conflicting statements. As long as we can respect the words of Chazal even without understanding them, we may try to understand the world as well as we can, and to try to understand the words of Chazal and how they fit with the world we see, and also to learn from their statement -- even before we fully understand them -- to guide us in our own effort to understand the world.</p>\n\n\n",

That Tefilah is one way of actualizing Avodah Shebalev. So what are the other ways mentioned by the Rav (and other commentators)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems likely that the intent was Rambam's Sefer HaMitsvot (Asseh #5). (If I recall, the Rav would often quote it):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שצונו לעבדו יתעלה וכבר נכפל צווי זה פעמים, אמר (משפטים כג כה) ועבדתם את י\"י אלהיכם ואמר (ראה יג ה) ואותו תעבודו ואמר (ואתחנן ו יג) ואותו תעבוד ואמר (ס\"פ עקב) ולעבדו. <strong>ואעפ\"י שזה הצווי הוא גם כן מן הציוויים הכוללים</strong> כמו שביארנו בשרש הרביעי <strong>הנה יש בו יחוד שהוא צוה בתפילה</strong>. ולשון ספרי ולעבדו זו תפילה. <strong>ואמרו גם כן ולעבדו זה תלמוד</strong>. ובמשנתו של רבי אליעזר בנו שלרבי יוסי הגלילי (פרש' יב עמ' רכח) אמרו מנין לעיקר תפילה בתוך המצות מהכא את י\"י אלהיך תירא ואותו תעבוד. ואמרו <strong>עבדהו בתורתו עבדהו במקדשו</strong>. כלומר ללכת שם להתפלל בו ונגדו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, the commandment is a general one; to worship God (which would have been off topic as too broad), but it is interpreted as referring especially to prayer. It is also applied to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/62451/8775\">talmud Torah</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, this is stated in Reshimot Shiurim of the Rav to Berakhot 11b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה ליישב עפ\"י המתבאר <strong>מדברי הרמב\"ם בספר המצות (מ\"ע ה')</strong> וז\"ל...עכ\"ל. <strong>ומבואר מדבריו דתורה ותפלה תרוויהו הויין קיום של מצות \"ועבדתם את ה' אלוקיכם\" דמהוים קיום מצות עבודה שבלב.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Prayer inclusion because of fear?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Mishnah of Rabbi Eliezer, the son of Rabbi Yosi HaG'lili, the Sages said, \"What is the biblical source to include prayer among the mitzvos? From the verse, 'You shall fear G‑d, your L‑rd, and you shall serve Him.' \" Why is it from the verse to fear or have awe for HaShem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>I would like to know how he came to this conclusion, why is prayer included in the mitzvot because it's said that one should fear (have awe for) HaShem?</strong></p>\n\n<p>(I know that Ahavah and Yirah are two big pilars in faith, and that it's also said that prayer is Avodat Shebalev - Ta'anis 2a). </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's not the fear part; it's the <em>and you shall serve Him</em> part.</p>\n\n<p>In the second paragraph of Shema it says \"if you do the right thing, to both love God and serve Him with all your heart, soul, and wherewithal\", and the rabbis interpret <code>serving with your heart</code> as prayer; so that verse is saying \"if you do it, it's good.\" Okay then, where's the actual commandment to do so? \"And you shall serve Him.\"</p>\n\n<p>Notice the nice balance; the verse that commands it puts it next to awe of God, and the verse that offers reward for it puts it next to love of God, as we need both. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The source in the Torah that you quote from is <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14085&st=&pgnum=88\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 6:13</a>. This is as it is brought by Rambam in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46685&st=&pgnum=261\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Mitzvot, 5</a>. The <em>Mishnah</em> that <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Otzar_Midrashim,_Baraita_of_The_32_Midot_of_Aggadah,_Introduction/he/Otzar_Midrashim,_New_York,_1915?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam is referring to is the Baraita of the 32 Middot of Aggadah</a>. Like is stated in the Otzar Midrashim</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרמב״ם בספר המצות (עשין ל״ז) מביא מדה י״ז בנוסחא אחרת, ושם (עשין ה׳) מביא בשם משנתו של ר״א בנו של ריה״ג מנין לעיקר תפלה מצוה מהכא את ה׳ אלהיך תירא ואותו תעבוד, ואין זה בנוסחא לפנינו, גם הרשב״ץ מביא ממנו מה שאינו לפנינו בברייתא, ומזה ראיה כי היה לפניהם נוסח אחר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the specific version of text used by Rambam is not the same version of the text we have today. So to understand how Rambam understands this statement requires looking at his <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Tefillah, 1:1</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצות עשה להתפלל בכל יום שנאמר ועבדתם את ה' אלהיכם, מפי השמועה למדו שעבודה זו היא תפלה שנאמר ולעבדו בכל לבבכם אמרו חכמים אי זו היא עבודה שבלב זו תפלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam's statement \"מפי השמועה למדו שעבודה זו היא תפלה\" means according to <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14122&st=%25u05de%25u05e4%25u05d9+%25u05d4%25u05e9%25u05de%25u05d5%25u05e2%25u05d4&pgnum=387&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yad Malachi</a> that this is the meaning of the word as taught, teacher to student, generation after generation, directly from Moshe Rabbeinu and that this meaning has an allusion, meaning a type of metaphor, parable or other indirect reference to it in the written portion of the Torah (אסמכתא בקרא).</p>\n\n<p>A person who argues that it doesn't mean this and tries to argue that it means something else is essentially disagreeing with the teaching of Moshe Rabbeinu in a fashion similar to Korach and his group.</p>\n\n<p>The Targum Onkelos translates this expression like Moshe Rabbeinu saying <em>and serve Him</em> (ואתו תעבד) means <em>and worship Him</em> (וקדמוהי תפלח), the idea of prayer.</p>\n\n<p>Like is known from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.14?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hoshea 14:3</a>, prayer took the place of the service in the Temple after the destruction of the Temple. This follows what we say in the Tachanun each morning after reciting Korbanot.</p>\n\n<p>This source posuk from Devarim lists three different activities. The first listed is commonly translated, like you do, as <em>fearing the L-rd, your G-d</em> (from the verb תירא).</p>\n\n<p>But another way to understand this expression is like is taught by Rabbi Eliyahu De Vidas in the introduction to Sefer Reishit Chochmah. He explains that the idea of <em>fearing G-d</em> is about action.</p>\n\n<p>This is as it is understood from the use of the word in Tehillim 76:9. משמים השמעת דין ארץ יראה ושקטה</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From the Heavens judgement is heard, the earth shakes (quakes) and is silent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>David HaMelech is referring in this Psalm to the teaching found in tractate Shabbat 88a which explains that when the nation of Israel hesitated in accepting the oral Torah, this caused an earthquake. After they agreed to accept the oral Torah, the quaking stopped.</p>\n\n<p>In this context, the verb which is commonly translated as <em>fear</em> is meant here to emphasize the <em>expression of fear</em>, meaning shaking and movement. It is the idea of <em>action</em>, meaning the performance of the mitzvot of action, like wearing tzitzit and tefillin or shaking the lulav.</p>\n\n<p>And so the posuk you source from Devarim means that we were brought out of Mitzrayim in order to fulfill the mitzvot of action and to worship G-d through prayer.</p>\n\n<p>And through this we accomplish the third element of the posuk which is <em>establishing G-d's name</em> (like Onkelos translates \"<em>tishavea</em>\" as ובשמיה תקים) like it says at the end of Aleinu, On this day, He will be one and His name will be one.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are non-Jews held accountable for their deeds?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the \"Path of the Just\" by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/mesilat.php?d=5&e=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch.3</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For one who is still held captive in the prison of his evil\n  inclination - his eyes do not see this truth, and he is incapable of\n  recognizing it. For the evil inclination literally blinds his eyes. He\n  is like one walking in darkness, where there are stumbling blocks\n  before him but his eyes do not see them.</p>\n  \n  <p>כי מי שהוא עדין חבוש במאסר יצרו, אין עיניו רואות האמת הזאת ואינו יכול\n  להכירה, כי היצר מסמא את עיניו ממש, והנה הוא כהולך בחושך שיש לפניו\n  מכשולות ואין עיניו רואות אותם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and in (<a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/mesilat.php?d=8&e=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch.5</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For this we were commanded to fix times for torah study... In truth,\n  the evil inclination is exceedingly powerful on a man. Without a man's\n  knowledge, it goes and strengthens over him and comes to rule over\n  him. Even if he employs all possible strategies in the world, but does\n  not take the medication created for it, namely, the torah as I wrote,\n  he will not know nor feel the intensification of his illness until he\n  dies in sin and his soul will be lost...</p>\n  \n  <p>So too in our case, for no one recognizes the illness of the evil\n  inclination and its powers except for the Creator who created it. And\n  He Himself cautioned us that the only remedy for it is Torah. Who then\n  will abandon it, take something else instead and expect to live?</p>\n  \n  <p>Certainly the darkness of the physical will advance and strengthen\n  over him level after level, without his realizing it until he finds\n  himself sunk in evil, so distantly far from the truth that even\n  thoughts of seeking the truth will not enter his mind .</p>\n  \n  <p>על כן נצטוינו לקבוע עתים לתורה... כי הנה היצר הרע באמת חזק הוא באדם\n  מאד, ומבלי ידיעתו של האדם הולך הוא ומתגבר בו ושולט עליו. ואם יעשה כל\n  התחבולות שבעולם ולא יקח הרפואה שנבראה לו שהיא התורה, כמו שכתבתי, לא\n  ידע ולא ירגיש בתגבורת חליו אלא כשימות בחטאו ותאבד נשמתו. .. ודאי שחושך\n  החומריות ילך ויגבר עליו מדרגה אחר מדרגה והוא לא יבין עד שימצא שקוע\n  ברעה ורחוק מן האמת הרחק גדול שאפילו הרהורי דברים לא יעלו על לבו לבקש\n  האמת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now since non-Jews are not brought up with genuine torah study then should they be regarded as not accountable for their deeds? And if they are held accountable why is this so considering they are helpless against the blindness of the evil inclination without torah study.</p>\n\n<p>note I am not asking whether they have any torah study that could help them restrain the evil inclination but rather that they will never get around to seeing the need for it due to not being raised in torah study and thus \"the evil inclination goes and strengthens over them and comes to rule over them..until he finds himself sunk in evil...\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is clear that Noachides are forbidden certain things. See <a href=\"http://www.wikinoah.org/en/index.php?title=The_Prohibition_Against_Doing_Anything_that_Contradicts_the_Belief_in_One_God\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Prohibition Against Doing Anything that Contradicts the Belief in One God.</a> My logic suggests that if there is no accountability, there is no point in having a prohibition. </p>\n\n<p>So the question is do they have any form of Torah study that could help them restrain the evil influence.</p>\n\n<p>The question is addressed at <a href=\"http://www.wikinoah.org/en/index.php?title=Can_Righteous_Gentiles_study_the_Torah%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikinoah.</a> </p>\n\n<p>There Rabbi Zvi Freedman (Chabad) is asked “Is there an established study programme how to teach Noachides?”. </p>\n\n<p>He writes, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The halachah is that a gentile is not permitted to occupy himself in\n  Torah the same way a Jew does. Yet the Talmud also states that a\n  gentile who is occupied in Torah attains that which the High Priest\n  does not attain. How do we reconcile these two? The Jew studies all\n  aspects of Torah whether they are of practical relevance to him or not\n  — just for the sake of being immersed in Torah. The BN (<em>=Noachide</em>)\n  studies Torah to know and to understand his path. In a footnote, the\n  Rebbe mentions that according to the Meiri, a Talmudic commentator,\n  most of the Torah is of concern to a BN.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So a Noachide can study Torah and we assume that the Torah that he is allowed to study will have the effect mentioned by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato.</p>\n\n\n",

I found Rashi's commentary on [t deut 29:28 lr], which says in part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a dot placed over [each letter of] the words לָנוּ וּלְבָנֵינוּ here, to teach us homiletically that even for open sins [which were not brought to judgment, God] did not punish the whole community-until Israel crossed the Jordan. For then, they accepted upon themselves the oath at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, and thereby [formally] became responsible for one another (Sanh. 43b). [<strong>When dots are placed over letters of the Torah, this denotes an exclusion of some sort.</strong> In our context, our Rabbis teach us that the exclusion refers to the period prior to the crossing of the Jordan.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is about that (unsourced) editorial note at the end saying that dots over letters denote an exclusion of some sort.  I wanted to look at the other places where these dots appear to see what's being excluded in those cases.

It has the sense of repeating, doing again a second time, sheini, and in this sense it is used in Mishnah, the laws repeated by heart, and also in the sense of which the fifth book of Moses is called Mishneh Torah, the repeating of the Torah (by Moses before his death). However it also has the sense of change, l’shanot, to make other – and here, too, is the sense of ‘two-ness,’ a second one that is different than the first.\n    In Yiddish the same phrase with different inflections means the opposite.  היינט אזוי – מארגען אזוי  “Today like this; Tomorrow like this,”  can mean “Today like this > and also Tomorrow like this >” and it can mean “Today like this >”  (pointing to the right) and “Tomorrow like this <” (pointing to the left).\n    It thus has the possibility of being read both ways: repeat or change.

Rashi continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על גוזליו ירחף: <em>nesher</em> does not press heavily upon chicks, but hovers above them — touching them and yet not touching them. So too, the Holy One, blessed be He, (Job. 37:23) “The Almighty, we did not find Him to be too powerful in strength”: when He came to give the Torah to Israel, He did not reveal Himself from one side, (thus concentrating His power at one point), but from four sides, as it is said, (Deuteronomy 33:2) “The Lord came from Sinai, and shone forth from Seir unto them; He appeared from Mount Paran\"; also (Habakkuk 3:3) “God came from Teman” — this is the fourth side (Sifrei Devarim 314:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, if Moshe rabbeinu also describes himself as a <em>nesher</em>, he means that he was a very responsible <strong>leader of <em>geula</em></strong>. Indeed, the entire process of Exodus went easily for everyone as if on the wings of <em>nesher</em> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 19:4</a>, compared to what it could be in the desert. Moshe was a leader who carried everyone's needs. Even in the argument with Korah Moshe notes, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.16.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 16:15</a>: I have not taken the ass of any one of them, nor have I wronged any one of them.</p>\n<p>One can also see the connection to such a leader using example of Shimshon, a leader who brought <em>geula</em> from <em>pelishtim</em> and regarding him Yaakov avinu prophesized <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.18?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 49:18 and Rashi</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>For your salvation do I long, Hashem!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last words of Shimshon, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.16.28?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judges 28:16 Rashi</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Please remember me</em>. Remember the twenty years that I judged Yisroel without asking any of them to carry a staff from place to place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 49:17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.2.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Raba 2:7</a> the symbol of the tribe of Dan was נָחָשׁ / snake, who brought the original sin. However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.2.2?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra on Bamidbar 2:2</a> states: the flag of Dan had the image of a <em>nesher</em>. Regarding travels in the desert, Dan was an engatherer of all camps as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.10.25?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bamidbar 10:25</a> based on Yerushalmi Eruvin 5:1 explains: (they) marched in the rear so that if anyone of the other tribes lost anything, he (Dan) restored it to him.</p>\n<p>I.e. the members of the tribe of Dan took great care of all other tribes. Perhaps it also included the care for the tired and sick.</p>\n<p>The books on kabbala try to reconcile depictions of both images on the flag as either a body of a snake with eagle wings or that the <em>nesher</em> in the sky is parallel to the <em>nachash</em> on earth. Pehaps nesher was a flying dragon, now extinct, since no bird carries all 4 nonkosher signs as described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.59a.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 59a</a> (see R.

I know that there are various <a href=\"http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/621,18775/Why-dont-we-bless-the-month-of-Tishrei-on-the-Shabbat-beforehand.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reasons</a> why we aren't mevarchim the chodesh Tishrei and I figured that since, according to my siddur, we don't say Av Harachamim on a festive shabbat (when Tachanun would be skipped were it a weekday) as signified by blessing the month, the lack of said blessing would require saying the A\"Har -- the two seemed intertwined. During sefirah, when, regardless of blessing the month, the entire tone is sad due to bloody massacres, we say A\"Har even when we bless the month (from the commentary in the Artscroll siddur) to reflect this pervasive sadness.</p>\n<p><strong>But the shabbat before Rosh Hashanah is no more sad than any other</strong>. Our reasons for not blessing Tishrei are not because the month doesn't start -- the shabbat should be as festive as any other on which we do bless the month! In fact, the Koren siddur implies in the English instructions to omit A\"Har (\"It is also omitted on a Shabbat before Rosh Hodesh (except for the Shabbat before Rosh Hodesh Iyar and Rosh Hodesh Sivan)\"). The Hebrew makes the inference more tenuous, labeling the day not \"The Shabbat before\" but \"Shabbat Mevarchim\" though this doesn't clarify whether the Shabbat before Rosh Hashanah is a \"Shabbat Mevarchim on which we don't say the blessing for other reasons\" or \"not a Shabbat Mevarchim even though it precedes the new month.\"</p>\n<p>Is there an inherent connection between the saying of A\"Har and the saying of the text of birchat hachodesh? Is there some other, external reason why we DO say Av Harachamim on the Shabbat preceding Rosh Hashanah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/2010-07-02_Tefila_Newsletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">beureihatefilah.com</a> article explains the history of Av Harachamim as well as its various customs regarding when it should (not) be said. </p>\n\n<p>The part that best answers your question is on page 4 of the article. The custom that many Nusach Ashkenaz people follow seems to be that mentioned in Siddur Avodat Yisra'el (I gather this is of Germanic origin, but it's unclear from reading the article).</p>\n\n<p>He says that most people from Poland recite Av Harachamim each Shabbat except for when <em>tzidkatcha tzedek</em> is omitted, if there is a <em>chattan</em> (groom) or <em>brit milah</em> (circumcision) in shul that day, or when the new month is blessed (note, he mentions the activity, not the day), except during the days of <em>sefirah</em>. Some people from Prague recite Av Harachamim when the month of Av is blessed.</p>\n\n<p>On the SHabbat prior to Rosh Hashannah, <em>tzidkatcha tzedek</em> IS recited and there is no blessing of the new month. So, unless there is either a groom or circumcision occurring, Av Harachamim should be recited.</p>\n\n\n",

Who changed it, and Why?\"</p>\n\n<p>Short answer  </p>\n\n<p>Note- the bomberg bible, is a mikraot gedolot,  a hebrew bible with commentary. Often translated as \"rabbinic bible\" in English <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikraot_Gedolot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The christian chapter divisions came first   (though that doesn't include verse enumeration).</p>\n\n<p>Looking back one finds the 1517 bomberg mikraot gedolot uses the christian chapter divisions. The 1525 uses variant which it got from a concordance published by Bomberg, called the Meir Nativ, by Nathan. But he based his concordance on a latin concordance and it seems he didn't seek to deviate from those christian chapter divisions, as his stated reason to have them at all, was to reply to Franciscan Friars that would put arguments to him, so it's possible that that the latin concordance he was working from had that variant in it.</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>Longer answer</p>\n\n<p>The christian chapter divisions seem to have first been put into the Vulgate, and as wikipedia says  the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Malachi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">book of malachi</a> has \"four chapters in the Latin Vulgate.\"</p>\n\n<p>The WLC began as a digitized form of the BHS, which is based on(though not identical to), the Leningrad Codex, the WLC then moved towards being a digitization of the WLC away from the BHS <a href=\"http://bhebrew.biblicalhumanities.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=957\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ref link here</a>.  The Leningrad Codex dates to before there were chapter divisions. The dating of the first edition of the BHS dates to 1968.  I see the WLC uses the same chapter divisions as the BHS, which uses the same chapter divisions as the 1525 Bomberg which predates it by far. So the WLC uses the 'jewish chapter divisions'. Looking online, hebrew texts tend to use the WLC and the jewish chapter divisions that it uses, whereas many online english translations will be taking into account the latin vulgate which they use for their chapter divisions.</p>\n\n<p>The earlier I can go back to, for 3 in Malachi, seems to be Bomberg's Mikraot Gedolot printed in 1525.  (interestingly the earlier Bomberg uses the christian chapter divisions).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/RabbinicbibleotMikraotGedolotBombergshebrewtanach.jacobBenChaim.1525\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://archive.org/details/RabbinicbibleotMikraotGedolotBombergshebrewtanach.jacobBenChaim.1525</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bomberg#Innovations_in_use_of_Chapter_and_Verse_Numbers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia on bomberg says</a> \"Bomberg was the first to print chapter and verse numbers in a Hebrew bible.\"</p>\n\n<p>It may be possible to go further back, to a  Rabbi Solomon ben Ismael  if one had his bible which had the christian chapters written into the margins.

The beginning was made by Rabbi Solomon ben Ismael who first (c. A D. 1330) placed the numerals of these chapters in the margin of the Hebrew text....(Ginsburg)\"    </p>\n\n<p>The verses weren't numbered yet, the verse division is part of the mesora which has 'sof pasuk'(end of verse) markings / 'full stops', but the numeration of it was later, and seems to have been invented by Nathan as mentioned by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapters_and_verses_of_the_Bible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this wikipedia article on chapter and verses</a>. He might've used them in his concordance. They were added to the 1548 Bomberg.  according to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3259119?seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this GM Moore paper on p.76</a> written by GM Moore referenced by the wikipedia article on the bible's chapter and verses. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, while the christian version, the KJV, uses the christian chapters as added to the vulgate.. another fairly christian, or not very jewish, version, the NAB, uses the bomberg style of 4 in Joel 3 in Malachi. Though of course Bomberg wasn't jewish, despite the fact that he was the first to print all tracates of the talmud bavli!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Added</strong></p>\n\n<p>DoubleAA mentions a paper (available on jstor)</p>\n\n<pre><code>The Chapter Divisions in the 1525 Rabbinic Bible\nJordan S. Penkower\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It says the christian chapter divisions were added to the 1517 Bomberg rabbinic bible, by editor a Jewish born convert to Christianity  Friar Felix Pratensis.  </p>\n\n<p>And while I can't see it bring up the chapter difference between Joel and Malachi, it mentions</p>\n\n<p>The 1525 Bomberg Rabbinic bible was edited by Jacob Ben Hayim Ibn Adoniyahu  and became the textus receptus.</p>\n\n<p>And it uses different chapter divisions to the 1517 Bomberg Rabbinic bible.  </p>\n\n<p>The paper by Jordan notes that the Bomberg 1525 chapter divisions were based on the chapter divisions used in a Concordance called the Meir Nativ by Isaac Nathan.  The concordance was written between 1437 and 1447 as mentioned on wikipedia's page on the author Isaac Nathan ben_Kalonymus.   The Meir Nativ concordance was published in 1523.   The editor of the Meir Nativ was Jacob Ben Hayyim Ibn Adoniyahu (that's the same editor as the editor of the 1525 Bomberg rabbinic bible).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/2649227/Meir_Nativ_The_First_Hebrew_Concordance_of_the_Bible_and_Jewish_Bible_Study_in_the_Fifteenth_Century_in_the_Context_of_Jewish-Christian_Polemics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The article by Ram Ben Shalom</a> discusses the concordance, though doesn't mention any difference in chapter divisions from the christian ones (the difference with joel and malachi). But it mentions that the Nathan looked to use the christian chapters and also the christian book order, but worked out the verses based on masoretic markings.   He mentions that prior to the publication of the Meir Nativ, chapter divisions appeared as a gloss in the margins of the  imola bible 1451, and possibly also done by a few individuals that understood the usefulness of doing so.   </p>\n\n<p>Jordan's paper compares the bomberg 1525 with Nathan's  concordance, and finds that the chapter numbers are identical. Verses are not marked, and are only done in the 1548 bible(the second printing of the 1525 bible, see p365 of jordan's paper).   Jacob Ben Hayyim ibn Adoniyahu wrote an introduction to the rabbinic bible, translated by C.D. Ginsberg. In Jordan's paper he gives a revised translation, and that translation states. </p>\n\n<p>p 361 of jordan's paper translating jacob ben hayyim \"....I have adopted the biblical book division........and chapter division used by the author of the concordance [Meir Nativ, Venice, 1523]\"   </p>\n\n<p>I don't know about the 1517 book order, but the  concordance used the vulgate order(pentateuch,historical books, poetry wisdom and prophecy] - vulgate book order has malachi as the last book, and the 1525 used the hebrew \"tanach\" book order rather than the vulgate book order. So, divrei hayamim(chronicles) as the last book. see p363 of jordan's paper. That order, at least with the prophets at the end is apparently the order that the Septuagint uses.  </p>\n\n<p>Jordan's paper verifies that the 1525 does indeed exactly copy the chapters from the concordance.</p>\n\n<p>If and to what extent the 1517 agrees with the vulgate, would be another question. I don't know..</p>\n\n<p>As to where the concordance got their chapters from or whether it was made by the author's team of scholars.. I don't know.   </p>\n\n<p>Langton created the christian chapters in 1205(as mentioned by wikipedia's chapter verse page), and the paper by Ram Ben Shalom mentions that they were used in the first latin concordance.  Nathan looked here when he created his chapter divisions. And according to the paper by Ram Ben Shalom he intended to follow them, so I don't know why Nathan decided to make one difference.  Ram Ben Shalom quotes Nathan who says  \" I found among their books a book they call in their language Concordantias Bibliae. Its method is that of general roots, bringing together all of the verses of the Holy Scripture in a single table[luah] leaving none out....... I saw that it would not be useful to us to translate it into our Hebrew tongue, owing to the change of the nouns and verbs posited by the translator Jerome..... I preferred to produce it [anew] in our tongue(Hebrew)...And so as not to depart from his method and in order to make it easy to find any verse we seek, in both languages, I have written all of the twenty-four [books of the Bible] according to Christian enumeration of the sections, so that we need not toil to find what we seek therein.\"   </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4584-concordance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jewishencyclopedia's article on the word concordance</a> states \"The word, in this connection, was first used by Hugo de Sancto Caro (named from Saint-Char, a suburb of Vienne in southern France), who compiled a concordance to the Vulgate about 1244. The revised edition of this work, made by the Franciscan Arlotto di Prato (Arlottus), about 1290, served as a model for the concordance to the Hebrew Bible which Isaac Nathan b. Kalonymus, of Arles in Provence, compiled 1437-45\"</p>\n\n<p>There is a wikipedia  page on Italian Christian scholar Arlotto. It may have been Arlotto's revised edition that Nathan used as a model for his concordance.</p>\n\n<p>This book  titled \"The Hebrew Book in Early Modern Italy edited by Joseph R. Hacker, Adam Shear\" might mix the words adopted and adapted on at least one point on p257, and may be doing it again but on p257 they say that the concordance chapters were adapted from arlotti's latin concordance of 1290. </p>\n\n<p>So, the 1523 concordance would also have 3 chapters in Joel i.e. as the Bomberg 1525 does. Though it'd be interesting to check the Bomberg 1517, I don't see it online.  And Jordan's paper also, mentions a publication used by Christians with a hebrew text that also had the christian chapters, that is the Complutensian Polyglot Bible.  (added- according to Jordan the 1517 bomberg has the christian chapters , as in, properly. Not Nathan's joel malachi variant. Nathan's joel malachi variant was introduced to the 1525 bomberg)</p>\n\n<p>The 1517 chapters were not based on the concordance. The earliest source for the chapters of the 1525 is the concordance published in 1523.</p>\n\n<p>As to the why.  It looks like down to personal opinion about how many chapters to divide Joel and Malachi into, based on the size of a chapter and whether it's considered to be very much a continuation or not.  So the 1525 Bomberg one made 4 chapters out of Malachi, one of the chapters being quite small(As does the JPS and interestingly the NAB does that too). And the Vulgate(or KJV or for a more modern example of the same division, the RSV or NRS) made 4 chapters out of Joel, one of the chapters being quite small. They could have decided to make Joel and Malachi 3 chapters.  But still, Ram Ben Shalom's quotation of Nathan indicates Nathan's intention to use the Christian chapters so it's not clear why he seemed to vary them on Joel and Malachi, unless perhaps the latin concordance he used, used that variant. </p>\n\n<p>'Ultimately', as has been pointed out to me, the chapter divisions are late, and the person who divided Malachi into 3 chapters clearly felt that Malachi ch. 3, vv.19-24 are the direct continutation of the previous verses, especially vv.17-18. (similarly, the person who divided Joel into 3 chapters must have felt that what we now call \"chapter 4\" belongs together, content-wise, with \"chapter 3\".</p>\n\n<p>A next step could be to look at the concordance by Hugo de Sancto Caro  and the revised edition by   Arlotto di Prato (Arlottus) 'cos maybe the variant originated there and not with Nathan's concordance.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth bearing in mind that Bomberg was christian, so the chapter divisions that the bomberg 1525 rabbinic bible used weren't 'that jewish', though Nathan was, though nathan might not have made his own variant.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapters_and_verses_of_the_Bible#cite_ref-5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapters_and_verses_of_the_Bible#cite_ref-5</a> \n \"Archbishop Stephen Langton and Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based \"  </p>\n\n\n",

There are various reasons for this renewed interest: an increasing sensitivity to cultural and societal problems and a corresponding desire to learn about others; a renewed awareness of the importance of the Old Testament Scriptures as Christian Scripture; a desire or even a need in our modern world to recover a sense of the sacred through liturgy and sacrament; the willingness to find new and innovative ways to worship; and perhaps even the enjoyment that comes from acknowledging the continuity with a 3,000 year old community of faith.</p>\n  \n  <p>As a result, there has been an explosion of interest in adapting the Passover festival to Christianity. Various organizations, such as \"Jews for Jesus,\" have long promoted Christian Passover services as a means for Jews to retain their cultural heritage while confessing Christian faith. They have also used the Christian Passover as a means to communicate to Christians the Jewish religious heritage that they value. </p>\n  \n  <p>Our goal here in presenting a Christian adaptation of Passover is to retain the theological, confessional, and educational dimensions of the service. That is, it is presented as a way for people of Christian Faith to express that faith in the context of a gathered community by participating symbolically in the story of salvation. It is presented very deliberately and purposefully as a Christian service, with no apologies. Yet, there has also been a deliberate attempt to preserve the spirit of the Jewish traditions and experience in the service, and to respect the faith journey of Israelites and Jews across the centuries. For that reason, apart from the fact that it will likely be Christians who are participating in the service, the thoroughly Christian dimension will come at the end of the service. After all, that is really how God chose to work in history: to the Jew first, and then also to the rest of us!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Being a Catholic I would like to follow the following approach to celebrating the Christian Seder:  <a href=\"https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/activities/view.cfm?id=544\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Seder Meal as a Christian Home Celebration: Preparing and Celebrating the Holy Thursday Meal.</a> Some of our ministers are in favor of this, while others are afraid to offend the Jewish community.</p>\n\n<p>Is doing so considered to be offensive in any way to your holy religion? Or is it somehow frowned upon? </p>\n\n<p>How can we celebrate a Christian Seder that would be acceptable to the Jewish community in general?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>An ex-Christian once described to me the seder that her church did when she was growing up.  It was adapted from the <em>haggadah</em>, the text that we Jews use, but it had some Christian overlays.  I don't know if all Christian seders do this; from the description in the question it sounds like this is not uncommon.</p>\n\n<p>Adding Christian symbolism or theological claims to a Jewish practice feels to many Jews like misappropriation.  You see this in the deep, visceral reaction that many Jews have to \"Jews for Jesus\".  It's not just that they're luring Jews into Christian worship but that they use the symbols of Judaism to give the impression that what they're doing is compatible with Judaism.  (Many of us consider what they do to be fraud.)  In a similar way, a Christian \"Pesach seder\" that likens the three <em>matzot</em> to the trinity or to the eucharist, the <em>pesach</em> lamb to Jesus, or anything messianic that is not entirely in the future, is problematic.  In my experience, most Jews who are aware of these alterations would be somewhere between extremely uncomfortable and offended.</p>\n\n<p>You, as a Christian, want to celebrate the history that our religions share.  Further, Christianity holds that a key event in your religion happened on Pesach, so naturally you want to celebrate that.  I get that.  I have a suggestion for you to consider: study or re-enact <em>your</em> traditions for that night -- a re-enactment of the \"last supper\" rather than a Pesach seder, in other words.  After all, you're celebrating Easter, not Pesach.  Even if you hold that that meal occurred on Pesach (which doesn't work from the perspective of Judaism, but Christians might not be concerned about that), the Pesach seder of 2000 years ago was not the same as the seder we know today.</p>\n\n<p>If that suggestion doesn't appeal because you want to hold something like a Pesach seder because of your historical connection to Judaism, then consider <em>studying</em> the Pesach seder in an interactive fashion.  You could actually do many of the things that are most engaging (especially for children) -- songs like \"Dayeinu\" (it would have been enough) and the four questions, the recitation and possible re-enactment of the plagues, and learning about and eating the symbolic foods.  To this you could add a reading of the text from Exodus.  Further, there are parts of the traditional Pesach seder that would probably make <em>your</em> eyes glaze over because they're steeped in traditions of Jewish study that will probably be unfamiliar to you -- so go ahead and skip those.  Don't think of it (or bill it) as \"having a seder\" but instead \"studying the seder, with selected parts\".  (One detail: it would be best if you did <em>not</em> say any of the blessings that contain the phrase \"Who has commanded us\", since (a) you're not actually holding a Pesach seder and (b) you weren't actually commanded.)</p>\n\n<p>A Christian seder that <em>looks</em> sort of like a Pesach seder but is <em>actually</em> Christian in nature is very likely to bother Jews who know about it.  But this doesn't mean you can't teach your community about Pesach if you want; I presume that you teach other parts of the Tanakh (what you call the \"old testament\") too.  The key is truth in advertising; a Pesach seder is a Jewish, not Christian, observance.</p>\n\n\n",

However, it is quite likely that he will advise you to get something else - not microfoil.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://koshershaver.org/why.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Koshershaver.org</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Using Micro-Screen Foil Shavers</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Terumas Hadeshen, quoted by the Rema, maintains that when shaving\n  with scissors, a person should be extremely careful to either hold the\n  bottom blade still, using only the top blade to cut his hair, or to\n  use scissors where the bottom blade is incapable of cutting by itself.\n  The reason for this is because extra precaution should be taken to\n  prevent mistakenly shaving solely with the bottom blade, even a minute\n  amount, since this is equivalent to using a razor.<a href=\"http://koshershaver.org/why.htm#_ftn32\" rel=\"nofollow\">32</a></p>\n  \n  <p>There is a possibility that in micro-screen foil shavers, the\n  micro-screen foil itself has cutting edges that can cut by themselves.\n  This screen is comparable to the bottom blade of scissors, since it\n  touches one's skin. This might be problematic according to the Terumas\n  Hadeshen’s chumrah, requiring one to take the necessary precautions to\n  be certain that there is no possibility that the blade touching one’s\n  face will cut by itself.<a href=\"http://koshershaver.org/why.htm#_ftn33\" rel=\"nofollow\">33</a></p>\n  \n  <p>In fact, the company that manufactures the micro-screen foil shavers\n  claims that the foil itself has the ability to cut. The shaver is\n  marketed as having cutting edges which are approximately twenty times\n  thinner than a razor, and are very sharp. Their claim is that it is\n  actually the outer screen that does the cutting by itself at skin\n  level, and the inner mechanism just grinds the hair once it is already\n  detached and inside the shaver. If this is indeed the case, such a\n  shaver would be no different than a razor, since it uses one blade to\n  cut the hair flush against the skin. Therefore, one must ascertain\n  that his shaver has a screen that is incapable of cutting by itself.<a href=\"http://koshershaver.org/why.htm#_ftn34\" rel=\"nofollow\">34</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They also specifically mention braun shavers on their <a href=\"http://koshershaver.org/faqs.htm#FAQ6\" rel=\"nofollow\">FAQ page</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>What about other NON Philips Norelco (Remington, Braun, etc.) electric\n  shavers?</strong> ... It is important to\n  stress that ALL foil and 'Microscreen' shavers, (for example: ALL the\n  BRAUN brand shavers, the ENTIRE Remington MicroScreen line of shavers)\n  as well as other brand 'FOIL' shavers, may also raise serious Halachic\n  issues. Rabbi Avrohom Blumenkrantz ZT'L writes the following in his\n  Pesach sefer \"...The new problem being discussed today is that the\n  micro screen shields are so thin that they on their own have a cutting\n  ability. We tested it and found out that if you bring a hair through\n  the holes in the micro screen shield and by just moving the hair\n  without to much pressure it could cut the hair. This is true for any\n  brand of Micro Screen shield. It is interesting to note that Remington\n  Dual Foil Shaver, it is advertised as such: “Microscreen CUTTING\n  system with two ultra thin flexible foils and 112 diamond hooked\n  Cutting edges” The problem is two-fold: 1) the outside screen can cut\n  without the scissors action and 2) both blades are cutting and based\n  on what we wrote above it is not good.\" SEE BELOW FOR OTHER HALACHIC\n  OPINIONS</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Lashon hara and review businesses\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How does one reconcile a duty to warn of bad businesses and a duty to not speak lashon hara? Ex. Yelp</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to R. Menahem HaMeiri the definition of l'shon hara, is speech that is meant to be defamatory or hurtful. Thus, statements of a negative nature that are said for a positive reason (in this case warning others of bad businesses), and not to hurt others, are permissible since by definition they are not <em>l'shon hara</em>. These are his words in his Hibbur HaTeshuva (Meshiv Nefesh I:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עקר לשון הרע הוא המתמיד לספר בגנות האחרים ויתן דפי בענינים או שילעג להם למעוט הצלחתם...ומעין זה מי שילעיג על חבריו למעוט השגתם בידיעה...<strong>לכונת לעג וליצנות</strong>...<strong>וכלל הדברים כל אשר יתן מום באדם...ללא כונת ענין נבחר הוא ענין לשון הרע</strong>...<strong>שאין לספר במומי בני האדם על דרך לעג וליצנות, אם לא יעשה כן...לאיזו כונה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The archetypal <em>l'shon hara</em> is one who frequently relates embarrassing things about others, and adds falsehood to what he says, or he defames them on their lack of success...And similarly one who defames his fellows on their lack of intellect for the purpose of defamation and mockery...The rule is that anyone who ascribes a fault to others...without some specific intent is <em>l'shon hara</em>...For one should not relate the faults of others in context of defamation and mockery, unless he is speaking for some purpose. (Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This also appears to be the opinion of R. Elhanan Wasserman, who generalizes this to all interpersonal mitsvot. He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך... \n  וכן בלאו דלא תלך רכיל, מותר לספר לה\"ר על בעלי מחלוקת כדי להשקיט המריבה. וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים... \n  ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת  </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And so too with the prohibition of gossiping, it is permitted to tell <em>l'shon hara</em> on disputants to quell the dispute...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse]...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Importantly, they do not attach conditions to <em>to'elet</em>, as the Haffets Hayyim famously does.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What was the ultimate fate of Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah (Acher)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Unsong is a work of online serial fiction by Scott Alexander which is based heavily on Judaism.  (I highly recommend it to Jews and Gentiles alike.)  In <a href=\"http://unsongbook.com/chapter-26-for-not-one-sparrow-can-suffer-and-the-whole-universe-not-suffer-also/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this chapter</a> of Unsong, the archangel Uriel tells the Talmudic story of the heretic Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah, commonly referred to as Acher or the other one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Elisha ben Abuyah was a great Rabbi of ancient Israel. A brilliant kabbalist. A mighty miracle worker. A true saint. One day he was walking along a path when he saw a little boy climb a tree. The boy found a bird’s nest. He took the eggs to eat, and he also killed the mother bird. But this is in defiance of Deuteronomy 22:6, which says ‘He who shall hurt the little wren, will never be beloved by men.’  ... The little boy killed the mother bird, then climbed back down the tree and wandered off. ... A few months later, he was walking along the same path when he saw another little boy climb a tree looking for eggs to eat. This boy found a nest, took the eggs, but left the mother bird in peace, in accordance with the Law. On his way back down the tree, he stumbled, fell, broke his neck, and died. So Elisha ben Abuyah swore eternal vengeance against God.... The one boy did a wicked deed and was not punished. The other boy did a virtuous deed and was punished with death. Elisha ben Abuyah saw this and declared that whatever power in the Universe meted out judgment, he was in rebellion against it....</p>\n<p>Elisha was very angry. One by one, he broke all of the laws. He was a great Rabbi, so he knew every law and which ones most offended God when broken, and he devoted himself to the task with fearsome dedication. He lit fires on the Sabbath. He ate pork. He even boiled a goat in its mother’s milk. Which by the way is why there is no longer a city of Pompeii. But these were not enough for him. He swore to break the most important law of all....  The unity of God. Elisha ascended to Heaven, as one does, and he pointed at the archangel Metatron, the regent of the Divine in the finite world. And he declared ‘That guy there, he is also a God. There are two Gods. T-W-O G-O-D-S. Deal with it.’ The Rabbis decreed that his name must never be spoken. And all who heard of it said ‘Surely the great Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah would never do such a thing. It must be some other one.’ and so from that day on, he was called ‘the other one’....</p>\n<p>God refused to forgive him.... It is said that each year on the day of atonement, a great voice would ring forth from the holy places, saying ‘Repent, O children of Israel, for the Lord your God is merciful and shall forgive you. Except you, Elisha ben Abuyah.' ... <strong>The Babylonian Talmud says that he was too great a Rabbi to go to Hell, but too evil to go to Heaven.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm interested in the part in bold.  My question is, what was the ultimate fate of Rabbi Elisha ben Abuyah?</p>\n<p>Is it true that the Babylonian Talmud says that \"he was too great a rabbi to go to Hell, but too evil to go to Heaven\"?  And if so, what happened to him?  Was his soul cursed to eternally wander the Earth, or what?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The story is brought down in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.15b.1?lang=en\">Chagiga 15b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Acher died, they said, \"We cannot judge him to punishment [in Gehinnom], but we cannot enter him into the World to Come. We cannot judge him to punishment, because he toiled in Torah; we cannot enter him into the World to Come, because he sinned.\" Rabbi Meir said, \"It is better that they sentence him [so as to purge him of his sins], and he should go to the World to Come [afterwards]. When I die, I will raise smoke from his grave.\" When Rabbi Meir passed away, smoke came out from the grave of Acher. Rabbi Yochanan said, \"Is it a feat to burn one's teacher!? There was one between us [Torah scholars]; can we not save him? If I took him in the hand [and lead him out of Gehinnom], who would stop me?\" He said, \"When I die, I will douse the smoke from his grave.\" When Rabbi Yochanan passed away, the smoke ceased from the grave of Acher. A eulogizer opened [his remarks] upon him, \"Even the entrance guard [of Gehinnom] did not stand in front of you, our Master.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, when R' Meir died he [Acher] went to Gehenom and later R' Yochanan brought him to Heaven.</p>\n\n\n",

[In this manner, the Chazzan reads the second and third verses as well.] After the second verse and after the third verse, [the congregation also responds Amein.] The Chazzan should not recite (these verses) from memory but should read them from the Siddur in order not to get confused. The Chazzan, too, may respond Amein after these verses. It is not considered an interruption because it is necessary for the prayer. When reciting the following words, the kohanim turn (partially) toward the South and then to the North: Yevarechecha, Veyishmerecha, Eilecha [\"May He bless you\" \"and safeguard you,\" \"to you\"] Vichuneka, Eilecha, and Lecha, [\"and be gracious to you\" to you\" \"you\"] because these words are in the second person. therefore, the kohanim turn also toward the sides, in order to bless the entire congregation. They also turn thus when saying the word Ahalom, because it is the conclusion of the blessings. While the kohanim prolong the slow chant before saying the concluding words of each verse, which are Ve'yishmerecha, Vichuneka and Shalom, the congregation recites (the prayer) Ribono Shel Olam etc. \"Master of the Universe …\" The one who prompts the Kohanim, even though he is not the Chazzan, should not recite Ribono Shel Olam, in order not to get confused. Certainly the Chazzan should not recite it because it would be considered an interruption of the Amidah. <strong>The Kohanim should chant only the customary melody in order to avoid confusion.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Source: duchaning in various schuls.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, the volume of the sha\"tz's calling is dependant on his community of origin, as is his usage of singing.

Mishnah Berurah commentary explains this to mean \"a medium volume\". However, he says that if there are many people praying in shul, \"they\" have to be loud so that all the people will hear them.</li>\n<li>While not explicitly stated, I am logically concluding that the \"they\" mentioned in the previous statement refers to both the chazzan as well as the \"kohanim\".

There are various opinions. Rav Yosef Karo says outright that there should be no extended singing between words and the congregation should be silent and just listen to what the kohanim say. Rama states that it has become customary to say verses, but states that it's preferable not to. A look at Mishnah Brurah commentary #103 indicates that only Magen Avraham and Ta\"z allow the recital of the verses only while the chazzan is reciting the words, not from the kohanim.</p>\n\n<p>See halacha #21 that states a general rule that there should be just one tune. (In many shuls I have attended, I have heard the group of kohanim singing multiple tunes together. It sounds horrible, and, yes, in some cases the kohanim themselves get confused - exactly what Shulchan Aruch describes. It's a good reason for a \"kohen gadol\" to take charge and coordinate with the others as well as the chazzan <strong>beforehand</strong> which tune they will sing.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Were there multiple Isaiahs?",
    "content": "# Were there multiple Isaiahs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Modern scholarship recognizes multiple authors of the book of Isaiah. While Isaiah 1-39 is attributed to the pre-exilic Isaiah ben Ammoz, Isaiah 40-66 is attributed to one or more later prophets writing at a later time. This view holds that Isaiah is a composite work, gathered together into one book under the presumption of single authorship. Evidence for multiple authorship is taken from dating parts of the book of Isaiah to time periods during the reigns of four Kings of Judah (starting with Uzziah), during the Babylonian captivity, and after the release of the exiles by Cyrus. This span is taken to be longer than the average human lifespan at this time.</p>\n\n<p>My question is twofold:</p>\n\n<p>1) Have the sages commented on the authorship of the book of Isaiah? </p>\n\n<p>2) If multiple authors are recognized, why are their writings kept together in one book?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>To answer the first part of your question, yes the sages discussed the authorship of Isaiah, and he did not write his own book.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_15.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> Bava Bathra 15a </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hezekiah and his colleagues wrote (Mnemonic YMSHK) Isaiah,  Proverbs, the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi explains that the prophets would write their prophecies at the end of their lives and since Isaiah was murdered by Menasheh as seen in the talmud <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/yebamoth/yebamoth_49.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here, folio b</a>, Isaiah did not have a chance to write his own book.</p>\n\n<p>As an additional point. Do we assume that that changes were made until the book was written and 'sealed'. No, not necessarily. Is it possible? Sure. Just a few lines earlier in Bava Bathra, at the bottom of <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_14.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14b</a> we are told </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>David wrote the Book of Psalms, including in it the work of the elders, namely, Adam, Melchizedek, Abraham, Moses, Heman, Yeduthun, Asaph, and the three sons of Korah</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So even though David put the final touches on psalms, there were many authors. But we do see that whoever we accredit with writing it, got to put in what they chose to. (whether that itself was guided by prophecy seems irrelevant) So it would be possible that Hezekiah and his colleagues put content into the book we call Isaiah.</p>\n\n<p>Of interest is the opinion of the Netziv in his commentary to the Song of Songs where he writes that these final authors actually made changes to the earlier prophetic words. He says the Moses version of psalm 90 read 'the days of man are 120 years'. David switched it to say 70. This pliability was only until the books were formally written down. He however does not point to Isaiah as part of his discussion.</p>\n\n<p><em>Edit: We find in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.6.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabba 6:5(6)</a> that a different prophet's short two passage prophecy, which was deemed too short to have it's own book, was in fact interpolated into Isiah's. These are the verses beginning with vs 19 in chapter 8.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי סימון: בארי לא נתנבא אלא שני פסוקים ולא היה בהם כדי ספר ונטפלו בישעיה, ואלו הן: וכי יאמרו אליכם וחברו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the comments by @mevaqesh there are some secretive comments made by Ibn Ezra alluding to a later authorship of chapters 40 and on. His comments are found in 40:1, 49:7 & 53:12. You can see a blog discussing that <a href=\"http://torahandscience.blogspot.com/2005/11/ibn-ezra-on-two-isaiahs.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Of particular note is the ending comment there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note that Ibn Ezra wasn't motivated to come to his conclusion for any of the heretical reasons of the Modern Bible critics. Ibn Ezra obviously has no problem with a novi (prophet) seeing into the future, which is why he doesn't mention his ''secret'' in his peirush (explanation) either of the two places where Koresh's name is mentioned, which were the favorite proofs of the kofrim (heretics). Ibn Ezra came to his conclusions not because of any doubts as to the powers of nevuoh (prophecy), but rather as result of his sophisticated literary and grammatical sensibilities, his acute sensitivity to all the dimensions of what we call poshut pshat (simple understanding of the verse).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, these premises are built on the fact that no mortal man could have mentioned an event before it happened. So therefore any post exile account must have been written by someone who lived post exile. However, we who believe in prophecy, as we must according to any Jewish authority, think this argument falls short. Any reason we would believe who the author is will have nothing to do with these arguments.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that since the Melech Evyon verses were skipped, the congregation used to say immediately after the end of the verse Melech Elyon in order to indicate that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Most Piyutim were designed Chazan - Kahal (that the Chazan says a part, and the Kahal's says the following part or a chorus), both for the beauty of it (as is done by Anum Zmirot, and how the Gemara and Rambam describe how Hallel and Shira is done), and for practical reasons, as most users in the olden days did not have a Machzor. Therefore the Chazan would often lead into the Kahal's part (often, starting a pasuk, which the Kahal will understand to finish, as is done in some Yom Kippur Katon Piyutim), or the Kahal will only repeat a chorus. The chorus will sometimes be before the Chazan, like Melach Elyon, and sometimes after the Chazan, like Bedil Vayovor.<br>\nWhat happened with time, is that the Kahal got Machzorim, and they would like to sneak in the Chazan's part. So for example by Melech Elyon, the Kahal would whisper with the Chazan his part, and then yell loudly their part, which is Melech Elyon, so eventually the two got attached. The same by Vchol Maminim, where Vchol Maminim is obviously the Kahal's response to the Chazan's previous praise, but due to each one trying to whisper the other's part, with the Kahal saying their part, and quickly saying the Chazan's next part, till it got reversed. Same is by all the rest of the Piyutim.<br>\nYou can actually see this in action on Yom Kippur Katon, by the Vedil Vayovor Piyut, which most congregations still have it Chazan-Kahal, with the Kahal responding Vedil Vayovor. But you always see some people try to say along with the Chazan, and they say it quicker, so as to finish before Chazan. So they end up saying \"Vedil Vayovor Rachmono Itkar lon ...\". Sometimes due to noise level, the Chazan has to wait for them to finish. So there we have it in the near future, being said in reverse like most Piyutim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/2012-02-24_Tefila_Newsletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beurei Hatefillah</a> ascribes the problem to a general printing error, much of it begun by Birnbaum's Siddur and in some sense, \"enhanced\" by Art Scroll.</p>\n\n<p>He states that the general format of piyutim was pretty much as @lionscribe described. Most Piyutim follow an Aleph-Bet format, and the chazzan recited the Aleph line, the cong. said the Bet and Gimel, and the chazzan responded. </p>\n\n<p>Another format had the chazzan read half line and the cong. responds with a whole line. This is the original format used and written for <em>Vechol Ma'aminim</em>. You'll see this format on the site as printed in an Amsterdam Siddur dated 1768. It is quite clearly marked what the chazzan says, and what the cong. says.</p>\n\n<p>Another 20th century Siddur from Hebrew Publishing Co. 1922 follows the same layout, but is less clear. Birnbaum maintained the same layout as the Heb. Pub. siddur, but, left one instruction at the beginning that just says \"Responsively\". Thus, the author claims the confusion began. What does \"responsively\" mean,  and who starts what?</p>\n\n<p>Art Scroll added more to this confusion in particular with <em>Vechol Ma'aminim</em> by keeping Birnbaum's \"responsively\" instruction, and adding \"The chazzan says the first verse in the same breath as part of the previous verse. Granted, this additional instruction seems unique to <em>Vechol Ma'aminim</em>. But, the \"responsively\" instruction is for all the piyutim, and that's likely where the confusion remains.</p>\n\n<p>Many other siddurim I have seen place the first part of the piyut in the center of the margins, separate the other verses in 2 columns, and the last half verse is again in the center. This <strong>really</strong> confuses things. </p>\n\n<p>IMO, there is no question that a version that is clearly marked with the wording <em>chazzan</em> and <em>kahal</em> (or English equivalent) would easily clarify things. I'm not sure which \"modern\" Siddurim are doing this and are doing correctly restoring things to their original pattern.</p>\n\n\n",

Also, how can mystical meaning be derived from the Hebrew letters, as is currently done by many Kabbalists, if the shape of the Hebrew letters was different from what we use today?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Answer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shalom, Thank you for your question. You are correct that there is a\nmajor opinion that ktav ashurit was introduced by the prophet Ezra and\nuntil then the Jewish people used ktav ivri (see the Talmud Sanhedrin\n21b-22a). However, the matter is not so simple! The Talmud brings\nthree different opinions about this question –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That Ezra introduced the change in script from ivri to ashurit, as above. (R. Yosi and Mar Zutrah)</li>\n<li>That the Torah was originally given in ashurit, which was used until the end of the first temple, then forgotten until Ezra\nre-instated it. (Rebbi)</li>\n<li>That there was no change in the script of the Torah, and that we always used ktav assurit. (R. Shimon ben Elazar – also held by Rav,\nShmuel, R. Yochanan, and R. Ashi)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Geonim in their response (358) held the third view. The Rambam\nalso holds this view (see commentary to Mishna Yadaim 2,5). According\nto this, the questions you raise do not apply – the Torah was always\nin the same letters we have today – Assurit.</p>\n<p>However, even according to the first opinion there are at least two\nother explanations that may help us. Firstly, some say that the Torah\nwas given in Assurit, but Moshe and the Jewish people did not want to\nuse such a holy script for everyday use. As such, they used ktav Ivri\n– until the time of Ezra, when it became acceptable to use ktav\nashurit at all times. According to this, even the first opinion agrees\nthat the inherent holiness of the letters applies to Asssurit – and\nwhen we say that Ezra \"changed\" the text to assurit from ivri, we only\nmean for general open use.</p>\n<p>Another explanation is found in the Radbaz (III, 882) where he\nexplains that the first tablets were in ktav ashuri, but after the sin\nof the golden calf, the second tablets were in ktav ivri, which was\nused until the time of Ezra. This explains the holiness of the letters\nof ktav ashurit, together with the opinion that Ezra made the change\nfrom ivri to ashuri.</p>\n<p>You may be interested to read about this (and the general holiness of\nthe letters) in a wonderful book called \"The Wisdom in the Hebrew\nAlphabet\" by Rabbi M.L. Munk (published by Artscroll) [on which I\nbased this answer to you]. Also, Rav Kook zt\"l has a very interesting\nunderstanding of this issue that can be found (in Hebrew) in his\nintroduction to his Eiyn Aiyah.</p>\n<p>Blessings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It can be found at this link: <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=7095\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ktav of the Torah</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you have access to Margolios Hayam on Sanhedrin, see on daf 21b starting from #37 onward.\nHe brings many opinons from Rishonim that even according to the opinion that the Torahwas given in ksav ivri, there was always holiness associated with ksav ashuri.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, one of his sources, the Radvaz, IIRC, said the original luchos were given in ashuri.

(Depending on which Yom Tov, though, not necessarily a long one.)  I understand that the reason for cancelling <em>sh'loshim</em> might be the same as that for cancelling <em>shiva</em>, but I'm most struck by the \"early termination of mourning, period\" aspect, which is why I've asked particularly about <em>sh'loshim</em>.  I welcome further enlightenment about <em>shiva</em> too.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps in regard to this question we might distinguish between “noheg (customs of) avelut” and “nichum aveilim.”\nThe halachot of Shiva are: Mourners do not: engage in work or business (unless truly irreparable loss will result, in which case there is flexibility on this after 3 days) Do not: bathe/ wash clothing or wear clean clothing/use cosmetics/have sexual relations/wear leather/sit on normal chairs (only low stools)/ do not study Torah/ go out except on Shabbat to shul/ do not participate in any entertainment/</p>\n\n<p>Many mourners, however, do not associate shiva only with prohibitions, even if those prohibitions have the purpose of restricting a mourner from engaging in activities that would distract from the real need to grieve.\nThey understand that \"sitting shiva\" means being fed, taken care of, and surrounded by family and friends who come to share stories and offer consolation. Yet these activities are still encouraged even if the official halachic prohibitions are not in effect.</p>\n\n<p>So, does the postponement or termination of official shiva mean that there is no nichum avelim? No. The termination (of the prohibitions) of shiva mean just that, that these prohibitions are lifted.  The obligation and opportunity to comfort mourners by visiting them, sitting with them, feeding them, davvenen' with them... all remain operable.</p>\n\n<p>Look at this informative passage in Talmud (Sukkah 41b and elsewhere) which states:\n\"Kakh haya minhagan shel anshei yerushalayim, adam yotze mi-beito u-lulavo be-yado, holekh le-veit ha-knesset lulavo be-yado, koreh ba-tora ve-nose kapav, maniho al gabbei ha-karka, holekh levaker holim u-lenachem aveilim lulavo be-yado\"\nIt was the custom of the people of Jerusalem that when a person left his home, he would take his lulav, he would go to the synagogue with his lulav in his hand, when he would read the Torah or pronounce the priestly blessing, he would place the lulav upon the ground, he would go to visit the sick and to comfort mourners with his lulav….</p>\n\n<p>So obviously there was comforting of mourners even on Chag. \"Mai evel ika ba-hag?\" asks Sharira Gaon. \"Af al pi she-ein noheg avelut bi-mei he-hag, ela she-chaverav holkhin etzlo, ve-yoshvin etzlo, kedei leyashev da'ato, ve-ka midamei la tana leha milta ke-mi she-ba lenahem avelim.\"\nIn other words, while technically there is no formal aveilut on Chol Ha-moed, the bereaved still grieve, and friends visit to alleviate their suffering.\nSo yes, even when there is no official “shiva,” be with them and the family, share a meal of consolation, ask them to take out photographs and share stories... offer friendship, comfort, caring.... and help them be surrounded by the people who support them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yom Tov has an aspect of <em>simcha</em> - gladness - that Shabbat does not have. See <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Shiva_Shortened_by_Yom_Tov.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> for a more thorough explanation.</p>\n\n<p>Several aspects:</p>\n\n<p>Yom Tov has a communal outward aspect of joy. Thus, the concept of mourning is incompatible with Yom Tov. The article mentions that on Yom Tov, if someone was ritually impure, his impurity was waived so that he could go to the Temple in Jerusalem. Had that not happened, people would stay away from the dead and not bury them, because they wouldn't want to be impure. So, you can see the great importance of communal joy that Yom Tov has.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The great sage Chatam Sofer (YD 348) writes that a festival cancels\n  the shiva because a festival annuls that phase of heavenly judgment on\n  the soul of the deceased. These are deep kabbalistic matters that we\n  do not fully understand</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the missing \"therapy\" that shiva allows that has been \"cancelled\" by Yom Tov, the article explains that the joy of Yom Tov places someone on a higher emotional level such that the joy of Yom Tov cancels the \"therapy\" needed by shiva or shloshim.</p>\n\n<p>See the remainder of the article as well as his reference to <em>Book of Our Heritage</em> that discusses some of these and mentions other aspects, as well.</p>\n\n\n",

As the frame isn’t used to serve the idol, that point seemingly is not relevant here, which is why I left that bit out of my translation above.)</p>\n<p>If it’s just an ordinary frame that someone happened to put this painting in, it would seem to be permissible, based on ibid. 8:4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִילָן שֶׁמַּעֲמִידִין תַּחְתָּיו עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים כָּל זְמַן שֶׁהִיא תַּחְתָּיו אָסוּר בַּהֲנָאָה. נְטָלָהּ מִתַּחְתָּיו הֲרֵי זֶה מֻתָּר מִפְּנֵי שֶׁאֵין הָאִילָן עַצְמוֹ הוּא הַנֶּעֱבָד. בַּיִת שֶׁבְּנָאוֹ הָעוֹבֵד כּוֹכָבִים מִתְּחִלָּה שֶׁיְּהֵא הַבַּיִת עַצְמוֹ נֶעֱבָד וְכֵן הַמִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶה לְבַיִת בָּנוּי הֲרֵי זֶה אָסוּר בַּהֲנָאָה. הָיָה בָּנוּי וְסִיְּדוֹ וְכִיְּרוֹ לְשֵׁם עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים עַד שֶׁנִּתְחַדֵּשׁ נוֹטֵל מַה שֶּׁחִדֵּשׁ וְהַחִדּוּשׁ אָסוּר בַּהֲנָאָה מִפְּנֵי שֶׁעֲשָׂאָהוּ לְעָבְדוֹ וּשְׁאָר הַבַּיִת מֻתָּר. הִכְנִיס עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים לְתוֹךְ הַבַּיִת כָּל זְמַן שֶׁהִיא שָׁם הַבַּיִת אָסוּר בַּהֲנָאָה. הוֹצִיאָהּ הֻתַּר הַבַּיִת. וְכֵן אֶבֶן שֶׁחֲצָבָהּ מִתְּחִלָּה לְעָבְדָהּ אֲסוּרָה בַּהֲנָאָה. הָיְתָה חֲצוּבָה וְצִיְּרָהּ וְכִיְּרָהּ שֶׁתַּעֲבֹד אֲפִלּוּ צִיֵּר וְכִיֵּר בְּגוּף הָאֶבֶן וְאֵין צָרִיךְ לוֹמַר אִם כִּיֵּר עָלֶיהָ נוֹטֵל מַה שֶּׁחִדֵּשׁ וְהוּא אָסוּר בַּהֲנָאָה הוֹאִיל וְנַעֲשָׂה שֶׁיֵּעָבֵד וּשְׁאָר הָאֶבֶן מֻתָּר:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, the Rambam discusses two types of cases: 1) a tree that was planted for Avodah Zarah, wherein the tree is forbidden, and 2) a tree that was already there, and an idol was later placed under it, wherein the tree is only forbidden while the idol is under it. Likewise, a house built for Avodah Zarah is forbidden, but if it wasn’t build for Avodah Zarah, and only later an idol was brought into it, or the house was plastered for Avodah Zarah, only the new things have to be removed to permit the house.</p>\n<p>So, too, it would seem, the picture frame that was not made for Avodah Zarah would be permitted once the painting is removed. If, however, the frame was made specifically for the idolatrous image, it would be forbidden.</p>\n<h1>TLDR</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>If the image was made for decoration, it’s permitted, and certainly the frame.</li>\n<li>If the image was made for idolatry, but by a Jew, it’s only forbidden once it’s worshipped.</li>\n<li>If the frame was made specifically for a prohibited image, it’s forbidden. Otherwise, it’s permitted once the image is removed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What one must give up their life for\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is commonly known that there are 3 things that a Jew must give up their life for and not to be <em>ovar</em> (transgress) on these things: Giliah Ariyos (sexual relations that are not permitted), Shivchus Damim (killing someone), and Avodah Zarah (idol worship.)</p>\n\n<p>Recently I was told by someone that there is actually a 4th thing. That is if someone is in a situation where they are forced to profess a belief or do an action that would constitute \"kefirah and/or apikorsus\" (perhaps someone can help with the translation for this here) than they also must give up their life.</p>\n\n<p>They said the source can be found in Moreh HaNavuchim (\"towards the end\" as they told) and in many other seforim (rishonim as they said.)</p>\n\n<p>Is there such a source for this in Moreh HaNavuchim? And whether there is or isn't are there any other sources that one must give up their life in order to to be ovar on these things?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Besides for these three sins, the Gemara (Sanhedrin 74a) clearly writes that there are two other situations which require one to give up his life: in public and in the context of persecution against the Jewish religion. Thus, any threat to death which is directed towards the Jew to abandon his religion must be met with martyrdom.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, Rambam does not discuss this explicitly in his <em>Moreh Nevukhim,</em> but he does mention this case in a famous letter-responsum known as <em><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/mekorot/kidush-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iggeret ha-Shemad</a>.</em> There, Rambam actually rules that one is <strong>permitted</strong> to verbally announce that he believes that Muhammad was a prophet, even though doing so gives off the impression that one is accepting Islam, which is a heretical religion (Hil. Teshuvah 3:8, or <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1503.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:17 in this version</a>) despite not being idolatry (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5211.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Ma'achalot Asurot 11:7 or 11:4</a>). Although mere acceptance of Muhammad as a prophet might not be heretical (<em>kefirah/epikorsut</em>), in <em>Iggeret Teiman,</em> in the <em>Iggeret ha-Shemad,</em> Rambam appears to encourage that one <strong>not</strong> give up his life when forced to convert to Islam, and instead simply keep a low profile (and try to get out of that country ASAP). This seems to be because a person can't just change his beliefs because someone puts a knife at his throat, and so the Muslims must know that we don't actually believe in their religion even after forcing us to profess belief in it.  </p>\n\n<p>Here is the relevant passage from <em>Iggeret ha-Shemad</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דע שכל השמדות שהיו בזמן החכמים, היו מצווים בה לעבור על המצות, והיה בם עשיית מעשה. כמו שאמרו בתלמוד שלא יתעסקו בתורה, ולא ימולו את בניהם, או שיבעלו נשיהן נדות. ואולם זה השמד לא יתחייבו עשיית מעשה, זולת הדיבור בלבד... וכבר נתאמת אצלם שאין אנחנו מאמינים באותו הדיבור ואינו בפי האומרו רק להנצל מן המלך, כדי להפיס דעתו בדיבורים מן הדיבור. וכל מי שנהרג כדי שלא יודה בשליחות אותו האיש, לא ייאמר עליו אלא שעשה\n  הישר והטוב, ויש לו שכר גדול לפני השם, ומעלתו במעלה עליונה כי הוא מסר\n  עצמו לקדושת השם ית' ויתעלה. אבל מי שבא לשאול אותנו אם ייהרג או יודה,\n  אומרים לו שיודה ולא ייהרג. אבל לא יעמוד במלכות אותו המלך, אלא ישב\n  בביתו עד שיצא אם הוא צריך, ומעשה ידיו יעשה בסתר... ולא יראה מדברי רז\"ל\n  שיאמרו ייהרג ואל יעבור ואל יאמר דבר אחד שאין בו מעשה. אבל ייהרג כאשר\n  יחייבוהו לעשות מעשה, או על דבר שהוא מוזהר עליו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Shilat writes (Iggerot Ha-Rambam page 40, note 8):\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rnqlN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rnqlN.png\" alt=\"Shilat, page 40\"></a></p>\n\n<p>However, this lenient opinion appears not to have been shared by many others, and is relevant to the question of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28390/conversion-to-islam\">whether or not one should give up his life before being forced to convert to Islam</a>. Rabvaz (She'elot u­Teshuvot Radvaz, nos. 344 and 1163, or vol. 4 no. 92) quotes the Ritva as arguing with Rambam and require one to give up his life instead of admitting to Islam. He writes explicitly that one must give up his life before professing belief in <em>kefirah:</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והוי יודע שאמונת הישמעאלים אעפ\"י שהם מייחדים, ע\"ז גמורה חשיבא ליהרג ואל ישתמד שהרי המודה באמונתם כופר בתורת משה שאינה אמת כמות שהיא בידינו וכל כיוצא בו ע\"ז היא, ולא אמרו בשאר מצות יעבור ואל יהרג במתכוין להעביר אלא כשאומרין לו חלל שבת כדי לעבור על דתך, לא שיאמרו לו חלל שבת כמודה שאין תורתך אמת ולא ציוה הקב\"ה לשמור את השבת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This view may also have been held by Ran (Chiddushei ha-Ran to Sanhedrin 61a), but this was likely not actually written by Rabbeinu Nissim of Geronda.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Maybe the source you search is in the Sefer HaChinuch (25: מצות האמנה במציאות השם )</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא יודה בחילוף זה <strong>ואפילו יאמרו להרגו</strong> ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact, this is not a <em>4th</em> thing, but an <em>extension</em> of the first. There is a notion of <strong>אביזרייהו</strong> (= extensions, but dont know the exact litteral translation) of the three. See in Sanhedrin 75a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מעשה באדם אחד שנתן עיניו באשה אחת והעלה לבו טינא ובאו ושאלו לרופאים ואמרו ... תעמוד לפניו ערומה <strong>ימות ואל תעמוד לפניו ערומה</strong> ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The cause is Hashem, the consequence is a \"spiritual product\".</p>\n\n<p>At this stage he was breaking the first Negative  Mitsva (Lo Taasse 1, Rambam Sefer Hamitsvot), the second comendment :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הראשונה ממצוות לא תעשה\n  היא האזהרה שהוזהרנו מלהאמין [וליחס] אלהות לזולתו יתעלה. \n  והוא אמרו- יתרומם מליחס לו אמירה -: \"לא יהיה לך אלהים אחרים על פני\" (שמות כ, ג). וכבר נתבאר בסוף מכות שלאו זה הוא מכלל תרי\"ג מצוות, והוא אמרם שם: \n  \"שש מאות ושלש עשרה מצוות נאמרו לו למשה בסיני וגו'\". כמו שביארנו במצווה הראשונה ממצוות עשה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The prohibition to believe that there is divinity out of G-d. </p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Rectification: Experimental proof that Matat' has no own power.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אפקוהו למטטרון ומחיוהו שיתין פולסי דנורא. אמרו ליה: מאי טעמא כי\n      חזיתיה לא קמת מקמיה? ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara told us that they showed him that Matat' is not the chief and they mistreating Matat', thy did beaten him.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Second mistake, renouncing to the option of repentence: </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איתיהיבא ליה רשותא למימחק זכוותא דאחר, יצתה בת קול ואמרה (ירמיהו ג')\n      שובו בנים שובבים - חוץ מאחר, אמר: הואיל ואיטריד ההוא גברא מההוא עלמא\n      ליפוק ליתהני בהאי עלמא. נפק אחר לתרבות רעה. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After this Matat' went to take revenge. The second mistake of EBA was that he finally accepted the sentence of Matat' who declared the Impossibility to make Teshuva for EBA. EBA so decided to search pleasure in This world only..</p>\n\n<p>The sefer Hayikarim, in maamar 1, chapter 2 learns from our gemara the Talmud of Jerusalem ( Chagiga 9ab) a principle concerning the question who is heretic. The statement quoted in the Yikarim is:</p>\n\n<p>\"Everybody can return to teshuva excepted Elisha {called} \"one Other\" <strong>who knows his Creator and rebelled against Him intentionally</strong>\". The Ikarim deducted that an error occured in Torah learning doesn't make the student an heretic, even if the idea is heretical. An intentional rebelion was the sin of EBA. So it seems that at end, EBA did not be apikoros concerning the \"two powers\" hypothesis. </p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion EBA was initially wrong or at least sceptic and corrected his mistake but become wrong again, concerning his Teshuva option.</p>\n\n<p>This was the last mistake..\nThis passage of Talmud of Jerusalem is partially quoted in the Tosfot Chagiga 15a, and continues saying that EBA was a killer of Talmide Chachamim (I ask myself if we need to understand this concretly) and its problem was infringement. He <strong>was obviously 613ly spoken not a Tsadik.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>So, EBA was mezid (at least at the last step)  and disagree with Torah.The problem was not his first mistake in Torah learning.</em></strong> But his belief of the statement of Matatron (contrarilly to Eliezer Ben Dordea who heard the same sentence and despite that made teshuva and get in Olam Haba).</p>\n\n<p>See also More Nevuchim 1, 32. It seems there that EBA learned a far too deep and hard topic and infered false conclusions. The Moreh explains that he became confused and made a mistake logical inferences. This describes the first error which generated the process. {We can perhaps infer that this paragraph in Moreh illustrate his disagrement to the Yikarim novelty.}</p>\n\n<h3>Summary, EBA made an error, unintentionally, at begining, there was no problem of 613. Further  EBA neglected his duties intentionally. The first error started the process.. 613ly speaking, he committed crimes and several averot. A wrong belief  generated by an error in learning Torah is not a sign of minut according to Ikarim and Raavad.</h3>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>We have an ancient esoteric tradition, which is an advanced theology, and spiritual science, called Maaseh Merkava and Maaseh Bereshit (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.11b.6-24?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Chagiga, Perek Ein Dorshin</a>). This theology went underground around the time of Elisha Ben Avuya, and it seems that Elisha didn't understand it. I will explain why, and what the sin was, but first some background, much of which can be found explicitly written in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27ar_HaEmunah_VeYesod_HaChasidut%2C_Introduction_to_Beit_Yaakov.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to the Beis Yaacov</a>; Sha'ar HaEmunah VeYesod HaChasidut by Rabbi Gershon Leiner, the third Izhbitz Rebbe Zl, as well as many other places (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Moharan.64.5.2?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likkutei Moharan</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/The_Jewish_Spiritual_Heroes%2C_Volume_I%3B_The_Creators_of_the_Mishna%2C_Elisha_ben_Avuya_%22Acher%22.22?ven=The_Jewish_spiritual_heroes,_by_Gershom_Bader._New_York,_N.Y._1940&lang=bi&with=Topics&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Jewish Spiritual Heroes</a>, etc)</p>\n<p>For 1,000 years, the wellsprings of the mystical tradition were dry. What was available was a tradition passed from the elite of each generation of our Sages. By the time it arrived at the times of the Rambam, it had become fragemented, and had accumulated its own errors and losses (to be corrected by the rediscovery of the Zohar later).</p>\n<p>Rambam, who ostensibly did know the mystical tradition, was dealing with a particular situation affecting the intellectuals of his day, who were people who could only consider connecting to God through the philosophy of Aristotle (because there was a philosophical/intellectual movement in the Arab world at the time, and Aristotle was hotly popular). Aristotle said that Hashem is One, and Oneness means not composed of any parts, and no ability to comprehend whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Rambam dealt with this by writing the Moreh Nevuchim. Here, he took every argument of Aristotle seriously, and made a theological treatise of Hashem that should please those intellectuals of his time, who were starting to feel embarrassed about the Torah describing Hashem with emotions, and limbs and whatnot. Thank God he did, who knows if the cleverest Jews would have all left at that time!</p>\n<p>Either way, in the Moreh, he laid the foundations for a Judaism that treats all the descriptions of Hashem in the Torah as \"metaphor\", and \"of course they are not true, but alas, the Torah was written for such lowly beings that it had to resort to describe Hashem as thus, but we know that Hashem can't be described at all - in fact, Torah generally agrees with Aristotle - any description of Hashem taken literally is heresy\".</p>\n<p>We entered an age of people who don't want to really talk about Hashem, and proudly declare that Hashem \"doesn't really\" connect to us, and rational people know better, and Torah is only there to serve us to become loftier, more perfect, and achieve Olam Haba.</p>\n<p>Imagine the clash when the Zohar arrived, and the theology therein was exposed to these people who had grown very uncomfortable with philosophies that are not strictly rational and conform with the strong Grecian theology. Kabbalah has had  to go through it's own \"detoxication\" and \"dilution\" due to the pushback, and now we have all these Kabbalistic revelations, the likes of which even the Ramak (teacher of Ari) and Ari himself wanted to make known to all the masses, suppressed (Christianity and Shabbtai Tzvi didn't help either, but trying to keep this not too long).</p>\n<p>Yet anyone who looks at very uncontroversial sources, including the Zohar, Ramak, Ari, Derech Mitzvotecha etc, knows that there is indeed a whole Torah about how Hashem IS connected, and the philosophy of Hashem is rather more subtle and esoteric than the Grecian philosophies. Even though it agrees with Rambam's statements about Hashem's ultimate unity and trancendence, its theology is able to deal with things like Hashem having literal, actual emotions (e.g. <em>ours</em> are the mashal, claiming this is what Rambam really meant, and similar) which are Him emoting through the post-tsimtsum Sefirot of Atzilut (emanations of His very Essence), and much more, which ostensibly do not contradict His Oneness. Nonetheless, it demonstrates how our ancient mystical tradition is not completely compatible with Aristotelian philosophy, and describes esoteric truths about Hashem and Maasei Bereshit (works of creation), and Maasei Merkava (works of Chariot) that Greek philosophy is NOT equipped to deal with.</p>\n<p>So, we know that Elisha Ben Avuya was a big fan of Greek philosophy (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.15b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagiga 15b</a>), and was studying it even though it was forbidden by Rabbi Akiva, his teacher. The story of the Pardes is a warning to us in the future, Rambam onwards. Elisha Ben Avuya went to shamayim and saw Metatron in the throne of God. He saw something that, according to Aristotelian philosophy, implied that God is not one, <em>chas veshalom</em>, and didn't have the correct tools to deal with it - he realised that if God's presence is able to dwell in the chariot of Metatron (which is for example explained in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chesed_LeAvraham%2C_Even_Shetiya%2C_Maayan_1.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chesed LeAvraham</a> as a particular <em>madrega</em> of <em>hashgacha</em>), then He can't be one.... according to Aristotle!!</p>\n<p>So, he became a heretic by choice. He said, \"I don't believe in God's Oneness anymore, must be a Rabbinic invention because clearly it is not true\". Therefore he commited a litany of sins, in the choice, as well as his resulting actions. He denied God's Oneness, which is one of the 613 mitzvot; he misunderstood Hashem, which is a huge sin (according to the Moreh Nevuchim!); he broke away from the Sages, etc.</p>\n<p>Who didn't turn into a heretic? It was R Akiva Zl. He was the teacher of R' Shimon Bar Yochai Zl and part of the transmission of the authetic \"advanced theology\" i.e. Mystical Tradition (from Adam to Rashbi, who was declared being and recorded as the GREATEST and FINAL teacher in that tradition). He had enough of an understanding of the \"workings of the Chariot\" to understand what he saw when he encountered Metatron, without having any doubts or contradictions with Hashem's Oneness, because Maaseh Bereshit and Maaseh Merkava do explain how this can be, without contradicting Hashem's Oneness.</p>\n\n\n",

A possible explanation of this plurality is that G-d has many attributes by way of which we perceive His actions.

The only caveat (based on the mishna in Pesachim about a visitor respecting the locals' practice) is not to offend the Israelis around you. Many (including the Mishna Brurah 496:13) would tell you to do your yomtov davening at home. For visiting Anglos to form a yomtov minyan is a public act that clashes with the prevailing practice, and Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach zt'l remarked that the walls of Jerusalem shed tears each time it happens!

It included a Hashkafa section where it quoted R' Desler posing a reason for the holocaust, and although it was quoted to be in Michtav M'Eliyahu V.3, I have never been able to locate it.  Does anyone know of a source where he discusses the topic?\nThanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Perhaps you mean vol IV, pg 124:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are struck dumb at the terrible destruction that has been visited upon us in our generation, and we ask ourselves: For what reason has God done this to us… What is this great wrath? Let us examine this. </p>\n  \n  <p>The entire period that preceded the destruction was a time when the burden of the exile was lightened upon the shoulders of the Jewish people… </p>\n  \n  <p>Clearly, the period of the Emancipation was ordained by God to serve as a preparation for us for the coming of the Messiah, and it was for this purpose that the burden of exile was lightened upon us… Since we have turned the purpose upside down, and instead of understanding the hint from Above to prepare ourselves for redemption out of joy and expanding our consciousness, we used the new situation to assimilate. Therefore there awaited us the well-known danger of preparation for holiness that is not realized – as explained above. (And the fact that the destruction came only now, even though the process of assimilation was one that had developed gradually for a long time, is because God is long-suffering and does not bring punishment until the measure of sin is full, and there is no longer any hope of [a positive] influence bringing about a repair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He seems to be saying it was because we had gone irrevocably down the road of assimilation. Hashem gave us the Emancipation for the sake of our having more tools to bring His redemption to the world, and instead we took it the opposite direction. And that had Hashem continued waiting for us to reverse course, we would have been irrevocably lost.</p>\n\n<p>These words could be taken as an attack on the non-Orthodox, as David Landau did in \"Piety & Power: The World of Jewish Fundamentalism.\" However, given historical context, it is more likely he is talking about assimilation's inroads in the Orthodox community; that even in the yeshivos boys were leaving left and right to secular nationalism (non-religious Zionism) and Communism.</p>\n\n<p>There is even a hint of condemnation of chareidi life for becoming too insular and not taking advantage of the opportunity G-d gave us. Calling the Emancipation \"a preparation for us for the coming of the Messiah\" sounds more like Rav SR Hirsch or Neo-Orthodoxy in general than the stereotypical Lithuanian Jewish positions. (But then again, his own roots in Kelm were not stereotypical Lithuania; Kelm ran a gymnasia for a while.)</p>\n\n\n",

The <em>literal</em> translation of the word \"<em>shvuscha</em>\", however, is \"your captivity\", and apparently Artscroll elected to go with the literal translation of the word in their translation.</p>\n\n<p>(The first alternate translation you cited is not literal, as there is no Hebrew equivalent of \"from\" in the verse.

So shvut ami, those who have to return of my people, and shvutecha, yours who have to return are roughly equivalent in that they point to Jews who will be brought back, i.e. those who are currently captives.</p>\n<p>The poetic English is employing an obsolete use of the word</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/captivity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">captivity</a>\": \"obsolete :  a group of captives\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>We can find a machloket between Onkelos and Yonathan Ben Uziel</p>\n\n<p>Verse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְשָׁב יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֶת שְׁבוּתְךָ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Targum Onkelos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וִיתוּב יְיָ אֱלָהָךְ יָת שְׁבִי גַלְוָתָךְ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your captivity in exil.

That is the minimum Halakhic requirement. If you for some reason really, really can't have bread (eg. allergy, availability, repulsion), might as well satisfy some minority opinions in Rishonim who permit using other foods.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Arukh OC 291:5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צָרִיךְ לַעֲשׂוֹתָהּ בְּפַת; וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים שֶׁיָּכוֹל לַעֲשׂוֹתָהּ בְּכָל מַאֲכָל הֶעָשׂוּי מֵאֶחָד מֵחֲמֵשֶׁת מִינֵי דָּגָן; וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים שֶׁיָּכוֹל לַעֲשׂוֹתָהּ בִּדְבָרִים שֶׁמְּלַפְּתִים בָּהֶם הַפַּת כְּבָשָׂר וְדָגִים, אֲבָל לֹא בְּפֵרוֹת; וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים דַּאֲפִלּוּ בְּפֵרוֹת יָכוֹל לַעֲשׂוֹתָהּ. וּסְבָרָא רִאשׁוֹנָה עִקָּר, שֶׁצָּרִיךְ לַעֲשׂוֹתָהּ בְּפַת אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן הוּא שָׂבֵעַ בְּיוֹתֵר.‏<br>\n  You must make it with bread. And some say you can make it with any food made from the five species of grain; and some say you can make it with things that accompany bread like meat and fish, but not fruit; and some you can make it even with fruit. And the first opinion is primary, that you have to make it with bread, unless you are [already] exceedingly full. (all translations mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed if you are exceedingly full, you are exempt (ibid. :1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יְהֵא זָהִיר מְאֹד לְקַיֵּם סְעֻדָּה שְׁלִישִׁית, וְאַף אִם הוּא שָׂבֵעַ יָכוֹל לְקַיֵּם אוֹתָהּ בְּכַבֵּיצָה, וְאִם אִי אֶפְשָׁר לוֹ כְּלָל לֶאֱכֹל אֵינוֹ חַיָּב לְצַעֵר אֶת עַצְמוֹ. וְהֶחָכָם עֵינָיו בְּרֹאשׁוֹ (קֹהֶלֶת ב, יד) שֶׁלֹּא יְמַלֵּא בִּטְנוֹ בִּסְעֻדַּת הַבֹּקֶר, כְּדֵי לִתֵּן מָקוֹם לִסְעֻדָּה שְׁלִישִׁית.‏<br>\n  One should be very careful to fulfill the third meal, and even if he is full he can fulfill it with an egg's bulk [some (MB) say an olive's bulk is sufficient -- AA], and if he can't eat at all he is not obligate to pain himself. But the wise one looks ahead and doesn't fill his belly at the morning meal in order to give space for the third meal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, if people know about the option of leniency and they have a nice delicious morning meal in front of them, not everyone will behave so wisely...</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh haRav writes (ibid. :7):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין לסמוך כלל על כל זה אלא אם כן אי אפשר כלל בענין אחר כגון שהוא שבע ביותר ואי אפשר לו לאכול פת בלא שיצער את עצמו<br>\n  And one should not rely on [the lenient opinions] at all unless it is impossible any other way, such as he is exceedingly satiated and he cannot eat bread without paining himself [at which point he is exempt].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Chayei Adam writes (Shabbat 7:3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומי שא\"א לא כלל לאכול כזית פת בסעודה ג' בשעת הדחק יש לסמוך לצאת במיני מזונות  לפחות בבשר ודגים ואם אין לו כל זה עכ\"פ יאכל פירות אבל כ\"א חייב לדחוק עצמו\n  לאכול עכ\"פ כזית פת<br>\n  And one who is unable at all to eat an olive's bulk of bread at the third meal in a Sha'at HaDechak should rely to fulfill his obligation with Mezonot with meat and fish, and if he doesn't have all that at the very least he should eat some fruit, but every person is obligated to push himself to eat at the very least an olive's bulk of bread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Arukh haShulchan writes (OC 291:12) about those who are regularly lenient to not use bread:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה גם דעת בעלי הש\"ע דהעיקר לדינא שצריך פת, וכיון שדעת הרי\"ף והרמב\"ם והרא\"ש והטור והש\"ע שצריך דווקא פת - חלילה להקל בזה, ועבירה גדולה ביד המקילים בזה לצאת במיני תרגימא. ויש להזהיר על זה מאד מאד, ואין היתר כי אם לחולה, והמזלזלים בסעודה שלישית לצאת ידי חובתם בלא פת - עתידים ליתן את הדין.‏<br>\n  And behold, the authors of the Shulchan Arukh are of the opinion that the primary position is that bread is needed, and since that is the opinion of the Rif, Rambam, Rosh, Tur, and Shulchan Arukh that bread specifically is needed, [God] forbid to be lenient on this, and it is a big sin in the hands of those who are lenient to eat other foods. And one should be careful about this very, very much, and there is no leniency other than to one who is ill, and those who disgrace the third meal by fulfilling their obligation without bread will eventually be dealt justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, regarding most cases nowadays, we understand marriages sometimes don't work out and then divorce is the correct option for both parties. Separating from one's first love can be very sad and still be the appropriate action under the circumstances. Anyone having marital problems should speak with trusted counselors, rabbis, etc. to work out the best option for them in their particular circumstances.

Mordechai Breuer, in his טעמי המקרא, discusses these verses (page 106). He points out three verses with a <em>ma'ayla</em> (מאיילא, which is what the servus is on the same word as the <em>etnaḥta</em>) preceded by another servus: these two, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.2.31?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jer 2:31</a>, which has אִ֛ם אֶ֥רֶץ מַאְפֵּ֖לְיָ֑ה (<em>t'vir</em> <em>mercha</em> <em>ma'ayla</em> <em>etnachta</em>).</p>\n<p>He writes that the <em>ma'ayla</em> probably had a similar sound to a <em>tip'ḥa</em>, since none of the four verses that could contain the expected <em>tip'ḥa</em> before the <em>etnaḥta</em> are missing it (these three and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.28.26?vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num 28:26</a>), and the final <em>melech</em> is instead a <em>zaqef qaton</em>. He thus explains Jer 2:31: namely, <em>t'vir</em> <em>mercha</em> is a usual sequence leading into <em>tip'ḥa</em>, so the sequence makes musical sense. However, for the two Daniel verses, he writes that it is beyond us to give an explanation (\"אין בידינו להסביר את ההטעמה הזאת\").</p>\n<p>Another explanation is proposed by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%99%D7%90%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yochanan Breuer</a> in his article <a href=\"http://pluto.huji.ac.il/%7Eybreuer/personal/nikudteamim.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מחלוקת ניקוד וטעמים בחלוקת פסוקים</a> (again, thanks to DoubleAA for the link). In short (see page 38ff), he proposes that the accentuators have treated מאפליה as two words (מאפל יה), and although the written text has one word, the <em>te'amim</em> represent the intended <em>te'amim</em> for the two-word version, which is <em>tip'ḥa</em> <em>etnaḥta</em>. He then suggests that later <em>ba'alei masorah</em> reinterpreted this as a <em>ma'ayla</em> (and listed it in the <a href=\"https://www.mgketer.org/tanach/4/28/26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Masorah Gedolah</a> — see עין המסורה on בשבעתיכם). Breuer lists several similar words (שלהבתיה, כסיה/כס יה, ידידיה, הללו־יה, במרחב יה), and notes that in all cases, the <em>te'amim</em> treat them as two words (even though there is some disagreement regarding writing and <em>niqqud</em>); the same can be said for מאפליה. This gives an explanation for Jer 2:31 (whether it's a <em>ma'ayla</em> or a <em>tip'ḥa</em> is irrelevant to us). Thus, with only the Daniel verses containing an unexplained servus preceding a <em>ma'ayla</em>, we might conclude that the <em>qadma</em> in the Daniel verses preceding the is the usual servus preceding <em>ma'ayla</em>. However, with so few examples, any conclusion is only tentative.</p>\n<p>Regarding the question of Rabbinic commentary on these verses: I have not seen anything mention the <em>qadma</em> preceding the <em>ma'ayla</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Avaraham Yitzhak Kook HaCohein (Ashkenazi), and Hakham Benzion Uzziel (Sepharadi).</p>\n\n<p>The gist of the responsas were as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Rav Kook: Everyone should pronounce in the way that was customarily done by their ancestors. So even if you are now Israeli and are used to speaking Israeli Hebrew, you should revert back to Ashkenazi pronunciation for blessings and reading of the Torah. He said that each custom of speaking had their own strengths and weaknesses. Anyone who deviates from their \"ancestral pronunciation\" is at risk of not pronouncing Shema' properly.</p>\n\n<p>Benzion Uzziel: Pronounce it according to any legitimate tradition. Including Israeli pronunciation. Rab Uzziel also wanted people to conform to one univeral Hebrew, <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=2314\" rel=\"noreferrer\">which would have been the proper Sephardic Israeli Hebrew which no longer exists.</a> </p>\n\n<p>A brief synopsis of the two opinions (and others) can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwinl-7e6snjAhXQv54KHZb8Dh8QFjABegQIBBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.yutorah.org%2F2009%2F1109%2F735745.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3ps4IRT6N7qo5g8s1_ga9E\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwinl-7e6snjAhXQv54KHZb8Dh8QFjABegQIBBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.yutorah.org%2F2009%2F1109%2F735745.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3ps4IRT6N7qo5g8s1_ga9E</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>AFAIK, for most Brachos, any Hebrew is fine.

    "content": "# Source for tune sung when prayer leader pauses\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On <em>Rosh Hashana</em> and <em>Yom Kipur</em>, sometimes the prayer leader needs to cough or swallow or clear his throat or catch his breath or the like. The congregation then sings a little tune, I guess to avoid an awkward silence. In most synagogues I've been in, it goes (if I'm not mistaken) E͜EDEFEDCB͜BCBA͜A (<a href=\"https://onlinesequencer.net/329506\" rel=\"noreferrer\">rough representation</a>). Does anyone know the provenance of this tune, or of the use of this tune for this purpose? (I'm not seeking a source for singing (anything) when the leader pauses. I'm wondering about this tune specifically.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Are you sure about this?  It sounds like the (Ashkenazic) tune used between paragraphs in the third blessing, and it's quite common.  Even Virtual Cantor does it, and I've heard it in recordings that are much older.  That's not a tune for the shatz to catch his or her breath; it's just to break up the reading.  It just happens to be a good moment for the shatz to pause.  You'll notice that it's roughly in the mode of the nusach -- it's really just part of the nusach.  There are other little niggunim used the same way in Avot, Misod, V'hakohanim, and even Geshem.  Abraham Baer's Ba-al T'fillah even has a few, and that's from Germany in the 1870's.  If you have one handy (there's one <a href=\"http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/titleinfo/853537\">here</a>), check out number 1165, the Avot from Rosh Hashanah Musaf, where there are lots of repeated niggunim, and if the shatz can convince the kahal to sing one, he or she can take a break for a few seconds.  The niggun you quoted is actually listed in Zamru Lo: The Next Generation, Vol. II, p. 81, as \"Traditional\" under High Holy Days Musaf Interludes (that one's not available for free online, unfortunately).  So it's probably fairly old, maybe of Chasidic or Eastern European origin (since Baer didn't have it), and it just spread throughout Ashkenazic communities.  But again, the niggun isn't the \"shatz needs to cough\" niggun; it's part of the nusach.  Your leader probably just had an itchy throat!</p>\n\n\n",

There, since a person is eating other food we are afraid he will forget himself and eat the assur food he is touching. On Yom kippur this does not apply. Also  on Y.K. the fearfullness of the day is upon him. </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch HaRav verbalizes the M.A. differently. He writes in siman 611 that touching food is always allowed. Preparing food, which is naturally more involving is only allowed when preparing it for someone who needs it like a child or a sick person. The only difference would be preparing food for no express purpose which seems trivial and impractical and we might assume the M.B. and A.H. agree. (preparing food for after Yom Kippur is mentioned below)</p>\n\n<p>They all say that if the child can feed himself there is still no reason for the adult to be stringent.</p>\n\n<p>Since touching food leads into discussions of hachana, which is actually the point of siman 611, see there for the discussion. Nowadays we have no leniency and we do not allow preparing food for after Yom Kippur even though this was allowed in talmudic times later in the day.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't see anyone discussing the other items related to the affliction of the day, such as leather shoes. But let's remember that of all the five items, only eating and drinking would have a punishment of kareis. It would be logical to be stricter with those.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rosh (Kesubos 1:12) holds of the latter view; the Rambam (Ishus 1:1-2) holds of the former view.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, Ashkenazim follow the Rosh, who himself was Ashkenazi, while the Sefardim follow the Rambam, who was also Sefardi. (This is a bit of an oversimplification, but that's the general idea: Ashkenazim follow Ashkenazi poskim, and likewise for Sefardim.) Thus, it's understandable why Ashkenazim don't make a Shehechiyanu under the chuppah, as we hold that it's not a mitzvah in its own right. But why do Sefardim only make a brachah because of the Tallis (see <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/l/m/48969841.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>, at the end of the \"Chuppah\" section)? If they hold like the Rambam, they should be able to make a Shehechiyanu without having a Tallis!</p>\n\n\n",

What is the analogy of grapes? Are other fruit not pleasing and acceptable?

Wine is the exception. It gets better with age. So too a good marriage. If people build a home on the values of an Am HaAretz, then eventually, the superficial \"love\" will likely erode with time. As the couple grows, they tend to grow apart.</p>\n\n<p>A home built upon the values of a daughter of a Torah scholar, will have virtues like patience, self sacrifice for one another , and higher values etc. These things will cause the couple to compromise and become one over time; until the marriage becomes wonderful like a fine wine...with age.</p>\n\n<p>He uses this often when explaining the blessing to the couple.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think that the simple <em>peshat</em> is that if they are both virtuous, they are compared to two grapes; similar to the English idiom; <a href=\"http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/like-two-peas-in-a-pod\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">two peas in a pod</a>.

Yitshak Yosef writes a different explanation as a <em>derash</em> in Yalkut Yosef. That grapes [differ from many other fruit in that they] require a preexisting support structure, to be supported, and the species does not stand on its own. So too, in a proper shiddukh, the bride and groom ought not stand independently, but rather, rely on the traditional behaviours of their ancestors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ילקוט יוסף שובע שמחות א דרשות ענבי הגפן בענבי הגפן</p>\n<p>מה שהמשילו ענין זיווג איש ואשה לענבי הגפן בענבי הגפן, היינו מפני שהגפן אינו עומד בפני עצמו, אלא נתמך תמיד על העצים שכבר קדמוהו...וזה הוא גם שבח לאיש ואשה כאשר מראש צורים אראנו ומגבעות אשורנו, שהם מיוסדים על דרכי אבות ואמהות שקדמום,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A Pshat I thought of: </p>\n\n<p>All fruit juice rot with age, wine is an exception, it actually gets better as it ages.

This is the comparison. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve seen a beautiful parable regarding this point. Tomatoes grow green, they turn red only after they have already ripened and have grown to their full size. At this point, it can rot. A good marriage is one where the couple is constantly working on their marriage, for if they take a rest from growing, their marriage may begin to rot. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Fasting only physical?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What's the meaning of fasts, is it only a physical deed of abstain from food and drinks? Because often in scriptures it's listed or placed in context of prayer, repentance, mourning or done to show a certain depending on HaShem. What has a physical deed of abstaining from food and drinks has to do with all of this? It helps us humble ourselves or afflict ourselves but where does this lead to, what is it's meaning to do this through fasting? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I come from the mindset that no law is strictly physical/spiritual. They blur into one another and provide benefits which merge those aspects.</p>\n\n<p>Fasting is powerful in a spiritual sense because you are choosing to take control of a baser instinct. Hunger is as basic as breathing or sleepiness, so by choosing to overrule that instinct in reflection of a spiritual observance/exercise you are strengthening your divine traits and suppressing primal traits. Torah teaches that the <strong>Nefesh HaBehamit</strong> \"animal soul\" is in conflict with our <strong>Nefesh Ha'elokit</strong> (divine soul) </p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in a more detailed explanation of the parts of the soul, you can read more in the Tanya at this link:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7880/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7880/jewish/Chapter-1.htm</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>These comprise two different sections of our soul which are in a battle for control. By doing spiritual exercises (such as fasting) you can drive down the animalistic urges and raise yourself to a higher state of craving. You can move from craving that which is harmful to craving that which is beneficial if you practice and focus your time/energy. Fasting is just one of those exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Fasting also has a symbolism associated with it in relation to the pain that hunger causes. When we observe <strong>Tisha B'Av</strong> (just one example) we fast. This holiday is a memorial in reflection various wrongs of Jewish history. One of the main reflections is on the loss of the holy temples (first and second).</p>\n\n<p>Some reading regarding Tisha B'Av and the tradition of the observance:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/946703/jewish/What-happened-on-the-Ninth-of-Av.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/946703/jewish/What-happened-on-the-Ninth-of-Av.htm</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>This hunger pain is symbolic of the spiritual pain of our people. We sit in hunger and reflect on this pain and attach that pain to the wrongs and errors of Jewish history. By doing that, we take an impersonal history and we connect to it. I can't know what it was like to lose the holy temple because I never had the holy temple. That doesn't mean I can't reflect on what that loss has done to my ancestors and my peers of today.</p>\n\n<p>By connecting the pain of our people to a pain which is rooted in our biology, we groom ourselves to make the suffering of our past a part of who we are. That strengthens us and drives us to honor the past, make peace with the present, and overcome the trials and tribulations of the future.</p>\n\n<p>A very detailed reading regarding the purpose of fasting in relation to Judaism:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/What_is_the_Purpose_of_Fasting.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.aish.com/atr/What_is_the_Purpose_of_Fasting.html</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>From a physical/scientific standpoint.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fasting has been found to promote health benefits when done in a controlled manner over regulated periods of time. They recently discovered that if an individual fasts for a period of three days, their immune system resets itself. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/12/fasting-for-three-days-can-regenerate-entire-immune-system-study/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/12/fasting-for-three-days-can-regenerate-entire-immune-system-study/</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Your body uses the time without food to correct issues on a biological level. </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, these are controlled fasts which are not extended beyond this period of time. Going beyond this period of time can harm you if you withhold sustenance for too long. Our bodies need nutrition to function correctly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R' Hirsch writes in Horeb that the purpose of all fast days is Teshuva, and gives the following explanation (ch. 33, Dayan Grunfeld's translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Fasting, i.e. abstaining from all kinds of nourishment for one day, should help in mastering the animal in man, in calling a halt to striving for self-gratification and in showing that a firm will can well remain the victor. It should also bring home the thought whether what made it possible for us to control our impulses and cravings - or, at any rate, the most pressing ones - for one day, could not make it possible for every day; and if we cannot control all such impulses, then at least we should shun the impure, the exuberant and the forbidden. Fasting, therefore, should contribute towards the eradication of one of the sources of sin, pleasure-seeking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fasting is meant to demonstrate to ourselves the ability and purpose of not indulging in the physicality which leads to sin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Fasting is a way of attaining a more spiritual state/frame of mind by disconnecting from physical pleasures. This more spiritual state is more conducive to Teshuva. See Nesivos Olam: Nesiv Hateshuva chapter 7 (beginning from the second paragraph) and Derech Hashem part 4 chapter 8:5 (regarding Yom Kippur).</p>\n\n<p>However, today it is not recommended to fast (apart from the biblically/rabbinically mandated fasts) because it weakens the body and impairs the ability to think and learn Torah (Krina D'igrissa 1:16,17).      </p>\n\n\n",

There are two ways in which market value is determined. The simple case is if there is a published, set market price for the item. The more complicated and more common case is where there is a range of prices.</p>\n\n<p>The Beis Yosef (Choshen Mishpat 209, 2) rules that goods that are sold individually, without any specific price guidelines, are not governed by the laws of Onaah. If there is no set price for items such as raw wool and milk (see Bava Metzia 68b), these are outside the boundaries of the Onaah prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>Following the same principle, the Aruch Hashulchan (227:7) writes that goods usually sold at different prices by different stores are exempt from the laws of Onaah. Where some charge more and some less, there is no prohibition against being among those that charge more. According to this, for most goods today (except those subject to government or other price regulation mechanisms) Onaah is somewhat rare.</p>\n\n<p>The Machaneh Efraim (Mechero 24), however, cites the case of seforim as proof that Onaah applies even to items that have no single price. This is also the opinion of the Bach and Shach (Choshen Mishpat 209:1), who maintain that the lack of a fixed price does not necessarily preclude the laws of Onaah. Shut Shevet Haleivi (5:218) rules stringently on this matter, and prohibits Onaah even when there is no absolute price.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this reasoning, Erech Shai (209) prohibits selling at a higher price even when there is a degree of fluctuation between different shops. Presumably, however, there must be some average price on the market with which to index Onaah. If there is a recommended price given by the manufacturer it may serve as a yardstick on which Onaah calculations can be based. Where this is not available, Pischei Choshen (p. 296) suggests that the median price is followed for Onaah purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Another view is that market price is determined by what the majority of vendors sell the item for (Imrei Yosher Vol. 2, no. 155; see also Heshiv Moshe 102).</p>\n\n<p>Where it is accepted practice for different stores to sell the same goods at different prices (a luxury story may sell the same goods for a higher price, reflecting the high-end nature of the store), the price which is used to determine onaah is based on the prices which are charged by this type of store (Pischei Choshen ibid).</p>\n\n<p>And see <a href=\"http://5tjt.com/sky-high-prices-and-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://5tjt.com/sky-high-prices-and-halacha/</a></p>\n\n<p>HOW IS MARKET VALUE DETERMINED?\nThere are two situations in which market value is determined: (1)If there is a set market price for the item and (2) if there is a range of prices. If there is a set market price for the item in that neighborhood, some Poskim hold that there is a problem of Onaah even if it is less than 16.67% (see Aruch HaShulchan 227:7 and Machane Efraim Onaah Siman 7).\nThere is a debate in regard to where there is a range of prices in the community. The Beis Yoseph (CM 209) suggests that Onaah does not exist in such a situation. Most Poskim (see Bach and Shach cited in Shaivet HaLevi Vol. V #218) hold that even if there is a range of prices there is still a prohibition of Onaah. Some Poskim write that the figure is calculated by determining 16.67% above the highest price for the item within the range. Others write that one calculates 16.67% above the median price of the item. Rabbi Yaakov Yeshayahu Blau z”l in his Pischei Choshain (Vol. IV p. 296) seems to feel that this is the most authoritative view.\nThere is another view that the determination of the market price is based upon what the majority of vendors sell the item for (Imrei Yosher Vol. II #155). This may also be the view of the Haishiv Moshe (Responsa #102). [It is possible that the Haishiv Moshe may be in agreement with Rav Blau, however, as the language is not clear.]\nTherefore in the prices discussed above, it would seem that if General Kosher Supermarket charges $20 per pound and Acme Kosher Supermarket $22 per pound and Yiddel’s Kosher Supermarket charges $21 dollars a pound, then the fourth supermarket about to determine its pricing, cannot charge more than $24.50 per pound. The truth is that the fourth supermarket should not be charging above $21, but it is not considered an amount that should be returned until the price reaches $24.50 per pound.\nTHE RANGE VIEW\nThere is another understanding of these halachos as propounded by Rav Chaim Kohn in his book “Hilchos Mishpat” (page 294). His view, confirmed by this author in conversation with Rav Kohn, is that the true market price is what is determined by supply and demand in what the market will tolerate. Therefore, according to Rav Kohn, even if there is a minority of people that will purchase the item without looking at the price, this is still considered to be a valid market price. When this author suggested to Rav Kohn that this opinion may almost negate the concept of Onaah he responded as follows: “In your example, where three stores price an item at $20 per pound and a fourth store prices it at $30 per pound, there are still buyers. Yet there would be no buyers at $50 per pound. The $50 would be considered Onah.”\nRav Kohn’s view was not accepted by the author of the Pischei Choshen z”l, and it seems was also not accepted by Rabbonim in the area that I had spoken with.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/price_wage_levels.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/price_wage_levels.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kiddush on Sukkos before tzeit?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The first night of Sukkos we make kiddush after tzeit (Rama 639:3).  My understanding is that this is purely because of the bracha of לישב בסוכה which you can't say until it's definitely night (Magen Avraham and Biur Halacha).  The Dirshu Mishna Berura quotes someone, I believe it's R' Chaim Brisker, who makes the point that we worry about the possibility (R' Tam?) that accepting Yom Tov does not create a full reality of Yom Tov that would allow you to say this bracha.  Otherwise, you could make kiddush and eat, and just make sure to eat a kezayit of bread after tzeit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Are there situations when you can make kiddush before tzeit?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You are an woman and not eating in the sukkah, or a Sefardi woman and eating in the sukkah with no לישב בסוכה Does this allow for Kiddush to be made before nightfall? </li>\n<li>You're a man and will not be able to eat in the sukkah, e.g.a hurricane is building up and its pikuach nefesh if you go in after nightfull, should one recite Kiddush in the Sukkah before nightfall?</li>\n<li>It's pouring and it's obvious that it's going to continue all night.  The Rama (639:5) says that you should make kiddush in the sukkah, so that your שהחינו will apply to it, and eat a kezayit there; the Mishna Berura says that you don't make a לישב בסוכה because many Rishonim say that you are not yotzei.  Can you do this early, go inside and eat most of your meal, and then go back to the sukkah and eat another kezayit of bread?</li>\n<li>It's after sunset and not raining now, but it's going to start soon, before tzeit, and continue all night.  If you wait, you won't have any chance to fulfill the mitzva according to the opinions that rain ruins the sukkah on the first night.  Also, you won't be able to make a לישב בסוכה in any case.  Should you make kiddush and eat a kezayit in the sukkah now, to at least get a chance of doing the mitzva according to those opinions, and then eat another kezayit after tzeit, to get 100% chance according to the others?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A woman eating outside the Succah can make Kiddush before  Tzeis (nightfall) as Kiddush a woman is Obligated to do Kiddush Mideoraita, but she is not obligated to eat in the Succah. So if she chooses to the Mitzva waiting till night to eat in the Succah she makes a brocho if ashkenazi and ommits if she is Sefardi. But neither has an obligation therefore she can do Kiddush before Tzeis outside the Succah in-order to eat if she wants.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shavuos 20a:נשים חייבות בקידוש היום דבר תורה דאמר קרא זכור ושמור כל שישנו בשמירה ישנו בזכירה<br>\n  Kiddushin 29a:וכל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא אנשים חייבין ונשים פטורות</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>A man however is specifically obligated to eat in the Succah on the first night so making Kiddush on wine must be done in the Succah at Tzeis (nightfall). In the case where its pouring for next few hours the best thing to do is <strong>to eat before davening if you are hungry when you are not obligated to say Kiddush yet</strong> that way your not hungry and can wait all night until a lapse in the rain then make Kiddush and Hamotzi in the Succah so you have fullfilled your obligation according to everyone and you can make a brocho leishev and Shehechianu at the same time of Kiddush like Chazal instituted. If its getting close to dawn then just do kiddush and eat a kzais in the rain like the remo (639,5) says. Note that for elder and weak people just follow the Remo, כדאי הוא לסמוך עליו as soon as you think the rain won't stop.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Source that a man is obligated first night: אמר רבי יוחנן משום רבי שמעון בן יהוצדק נאמר כאן חמשה עשר ונאמר חמשה עשר בחג המצות מה להלן לילה הראשון חובה מכאן ואילך רשות אף כאן לילה הראשון חובה מכאן ואילך רשות<br>\n  It says with regards to eating on Chag hasuccos (the festival of dwelling in the succa) Fifteenth and with regards to the festival of eating matzos fifteenth. just there the first night is an obligation as it says \"in the night you shall eat matzos\" so too the first night of the festival of dwelling in the succas, it is an obligation to eat in the succah.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>If you know the Succah will blow away as there is a hurricane building up, and its past shekia (sunset) and still not yet such strong wind that you can do kiddush and Hamotzi, then do Kiddush now and having a kzais in the Succah until its no longer safe (unless you have neighbors  with indoor Succah that you can access safely even in the hurricane). This way you have at least done a Sofeik Mitzva deoraisa. The source that one should do a Mitzva deOraisa even in safek after bein Hashmoshos  if not possible otherwise is the Ran (quoted Beis Yosef OC 665): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ליכא למימר דמגו דאתקצאי לבה\"ש אתקצאי לכולי יומא משום דלבין השמשות גופיה לא אתקצאי שהרי בין השמשות אינו ראוי למצות אתרוג שאפילו לא נטל כל היום אינו נוטלו בין השמשות דכיון דלולב בזמן הזה מדרבנן בר מיום ראשון ובין השמשות ספק הוא ספיקא דרבנן לקולא -<br>\n  We do not say since that an estrog was muksa bein hashmoshos on the 7th day of Succos which would make it subsequently mukza for the 8th day, because a person cannot fulfill his mitzva of estrog bein hashmoshos since anyway the 7th day is only chayav miderabanan and Bein hashmoshos is safek 8th day and safek derabbanan Lekula. Succah which is min haTorah all 7 days so one should eat even during Bein hashmoshos on the first evening after shekia*(without a brocho) when in doubt (of pikuach nefesh later on because a hurricane might blow the Succah away.)</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Source that after shekia (sunset) is safek Layla Min Hatorah as it says in Biur Halacha S.A O.C 261,2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולשיטת הגר\"א הנ\"ל מיד אחר שקיעת גוף השמש מעל הארץ הוא בה\"ש גמור וכנ\"ל. ובאמת שיטתו זאת לאו חדשה היא דכבר הסכים כן בתשובת מהר\"ם אלשקר סימן צ\"ו דמיד אחר שקיעת גוף השמש הוי בה\"ש גמור והביא שם שכן כתבו בפירוש הגאונים הראשונים בתשובותיהם והמה רבינו שרירא גאון ורב האי גאון ורבינו נסים גאון גם הרב ר' אברהם החסיד בנו של הרמב\"ם ז\"ל גם כתב שם שכן משמע מהרי\"ף והרמב\"ם ורש\"י ע\"ש והביאו הש\"ך להלכה ביורה דעה סימן רס\"ו סקי\"א ).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In the case of your example, it is the א-ד-נ-י pronunciation. You can see this in the siddur.</p>\n<p>The shvah under the י corrosponds to the chataf-patach under the א. This is because the default vowel is Shva; but because א cannot take a Shva, it’s converted to a chataf-Patach.

That is, there are six (6) different forms of vowel pointing of the tetragrammaton, which was influenced by its use in context.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, the form יֱהוִה <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ySGPK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">appears twice</a> in Scripture in <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gzyDh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 15:2</a> and <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gzyDh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 15:8</a>; the form יֱהֹוִה <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/w7uGQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">exists once</a> in <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NrWdt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judg 16:28</a>; and the יְהוִה form appears <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/zm51c.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">271 times</a>. In all three cases, the vocative form appears to be at issue. </p>\n\n<p>However, other forms, such as יְהֹוָה, which <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nuEGG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">appears 44 times</a>, and יְהֹוִה, which <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/I3x2P.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">appears 31 times</a>, do not have any immediately apparent obvious grammatical indicators in context for their vowel pointing. The most common vowel pointing for the tetragrammaton is יְהוָה, which <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/X0MuN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">occurs 5,658 times</a> in Scripture. These last three forms of the sacred tetragrammaton (described in this paragraph) occur 821 times in conjunction with prefixes. </p>\n\n<p>The total then is 6,828 appearances of this word in the Hebrew Scriptures. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a ketiv-qere phenomenon, that is, one reads the word differently from the way one spells it. The four letters are those of the tetragrammaton, which is never pronounced today. The vowels correspond to the word that is said euphemistically instead: </p>\n\n<p>אֲדֹנָי→יְהֹוָה (equivalent to אְדֹנָי in Masoretic Hebrew, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/78078/1499\">my answer here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>אֱלֹהִים→יֱהֹוִה </p>\n\n<p>This particular ketiv-qere is assumed everywhere due to its frequency. The same can be said for הִוא which is pointed (and read) as הִיא, or יְרוּשָׁלַ͏ִם for יְרוּשָׁלַיִם.</p>\n\n<p>The original vowels of the tetragrammaton are not those of the Masoretic text.</p>\n\n<p>The cholem-free form should be seen as a simple variant of יְהֹוָה which was accepted during Masoretic times. Since it is clear what is meant by יְהוָה it was sometimes used. I am unaware of any ancient treatise that makes any distinction between the two forms. </p>\n\n\n",

How does this usage relate to usage of the word, or related words, in other contexts?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some food for thought regarding this root:</p>\n\n<p>I found something in the WTT Hebrew Text regarding Tehillim 9:19:\nעניּים and ענוים one from the root עניּ and one from the root ענו\nIn both cases these words are often used in reference to one being 'afflicted, poor, humble, meek' </p>\n\n<p>Found this on the website balashon.com:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The common word for a poor person is עני, and the etymology is clear: it derives from the root ענה meaning \"to humble, oppress, afflict\" and is related to such words as anav ענו - \"humble\", taanit תענית - \"fasting\" and inui עינוי - \"torture\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is a hint from the text that the עינוי referred to involves an abstention from food.</p>\n\n<p>The parsha both in Emor and in Pinchas lists all the holidays and says with regard to each \"כל מלאכת עבדה לא תעשו,\" \"all <strong>work of labor</strong> you shall not do.\" Except for Yom Kippur. There it says \"וכל מלאכה לא תעשו,\" and <strong>all work</strong> you shall not do (Lev. 23:28; Num. 29:7). The only other holiday or time-period during which the Torah invariably forbids \"all work\" as opposed to just \"work of labor\" is Shabbos (E.g. Lev. 23:3 \"כל מלאכה לא תעשו,\" <strong>all work</strong> you shall not do).*</p>\n\n<p>What kind of work is \"work\" but not \"work of labor\"? I.e. what kind of work is not laborious enough to be prohibited on most holidays but is prohibited on Shabbos and Yom Kippur?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is work related to food. On the one hand, the Torah expressly qualifies its prohibition of work on Pesach -- one of the regular holidays during which only \"work of labor\" is prohibited -- by saying \"אך אשר יאכל לכל נפש הוא לבדו יעשה לכם,\" \"only that which to every life is food, that alone shall be done for you\" (Ex. 12:16). That is, work related to food preparation is excluded from the prohibition. On the other hand, with respect to Shabbos the Torah gives an express prohibition against the quintessential food-preparation work -- \"לא תבערו אש בכל משבתיכם ביום השבת,\" \"you shall not burn fire in all your dwelling-places in the day of Shabbos. (Ex. 35:3)\" It seems what is going on is that the difference between \"all work\" and \"all work of labor\" is food-preparation-related labor, which is included in \"all work\" but not in \"all work of labor.\"</p>\n\n<p>It turns out then that work related to food preparation is prohibited on Yom Kippur. The question is why. Shabbos we have what to work with; we know it is a commemoration of Hashem's rest from the six days of creation (see Ex. 31:17), and making fire and food are creative acts. But why Yom Kippur?</p>\n\n<p>Well, one thing we know about Yom Kippur is that there is an obligation to cause עינוי to the נפש; pain or subjugation to the physical life-force. Now perhaps this could be interpreted in more than one way, but abstention from food is certainly a valid possibility. It is a subjugation of one's natural physical drive. And we now have corroboration for this possible interpretation. Why else would the Torah forbid work related to food-preparation if not because this is in fact the correct interpretation of ועניתם?</p>\n\n<p>*There are places where the Torah describes the prohibition on work on holidays as being a prohibition on \"work\" generally, but it seems logical to assume that the specific reference to \"work of labor\" in the detailed holiday lists of Emor and Pinchas clarify and qualify those general statements elsewhere. Yom Kippur and Shabbos, on the other hand, are never associated with a prohibition on mere \"work of labor.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Just like these four species can't be had without water, so to\nthe world can't exist without water.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we can see, one of the major themes of Sukkos brought in the Talmud, is rain. Sukkos comes right before the rainy season. On Shemini Atzeres as well, we start mentioning rain in the second blessing of the Shemoneh Esreh (according to another Talmudic opinion, we should be starting on Sukkos). We have the special water libation as well. So taking the four species is very appropriate for the time.</p>\n\n\n",

How does one understand this Midrash?</p>\n<p>Additionally, I'm looking sources that can provide other insights to this Midrash. Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Side-note: Some scholars believe that this is the midrashic version of the apocryphal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Tobit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book of Tobit</a> (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/119782/20472\">here</a> for more information). Personally, I am of the opinion that Chazal did not view the details of Tobit as historical<sup>1</sup>, but did see the core of the story as something that may have happened - thus writing it in the form of a midrash.</p>\n<p>To your question. You translate \"הקדוש ברוך הוא נוצר לבחוניו, כאדם הנוצר אישון עינו\" as \"G-d protects his chosen ones, like man protects the pupil of his eye\" - I disagree with this translation. That would be correct if the word was בחיריו, but the word is בחוניו - His <em>tested</em>, as more properly translated by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Ha%27Azinu.8.1?vhe=Midrash_Tanchuma_--_Torat_Emet&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>.</p>\n<p>Now we can understand how this relates to the story: In the story, two people are being tested: The young man and the young woman. The young man is tested to see if he will follow Eliyahu's guidance to the letter and the young woman is tested to see if she'll continue having faith in Hashem. This is most emphasized by the moment in which she says: \"The Holy One, Blessed Is He is truth and His Torah is true\" - despite the fact that she can see that she's about to lose her fourth husband. Having both completed their tests, they are both rewarded: The man is rewarded by being warned by the angel that he is about to die, and so is able to tell his bride. The woman is rewarded by Hashem telling the angel to back off, and so the two are able to remain married, alive and healthy.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As attested by the Church Father <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Origen</a> in his <a href=\"https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0414.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Letter to Africanus</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Where you get your lost and won at play, and thrown out unburied on the streets, I know not, unless it is from Tobias; and Tobias (as also Judith), we ought to notice, the Jews do not use. They are not even found in the Hebrew Apocrypha, as I learned from the Jews themselves. However, since the Churches use Tobias, you must know that even in the captivity some of the captives were rich and well to do.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here we see that the Jews at the time of Origen (the early Amoraic period, circa Rabban Gamliel III, son of Rebbi) thought Tobit could not be historically true, as how could exiled and captive Jews be rich and well to do (and I'll add, free enough to roam the Assyrian Empire as they pleased)?

The commandment is that any <strong>Jewish</strong> male must be circumcised at eight days old. The responsibility of the father is to ensure that the commandment is carried out. If the father cannot do so, then the responsibility moves to other <strong>Jewish</strong> members of the family.</p>\n\n<p>For example <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/932325/jewish/Milah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Milah Chapter 1:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Circumcision is a positive mitzvah [whose lack of fulfillment] is\n  punishable by karet, as [Genesis 17:14] states: \"And an uncircumcised\n  male who does not circumcise his foreskin - this soul will be cut off\n  from his people.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>A father is commanded to circumcise his son, and a master, his slaves.\n  This applies both to those who are born in his home and to those\n  purchased by him. If the father or the master transgressed and did not\n  circumcise them, he negated the fulfillment of a positive commandment.\n  He is not, however, punished by karet, for karet is incurred only by\n  the uncircumcised person himself. The court is obligated to circumcise\n  that son or slave at the proper time and should not leave an\n  uncircumcised male among the Jewish people or their slaves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You ask</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Doesn't HaShem teach one should get his son circumcised? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The basic answer is not exactly. As the Rambam says, Hashem commands that one should arrange for his son <strong>who is required to be circumcised</strong> to get a bris milah. If he fails it falls to the rest of the family or the court.</p>\n\n<p>Halachically, the child of a non-Jewish mother is not related to the (Jewish) father and no such responsibility exists.</p>\n\n<p>If the child is not Jewish, then he is not required to carry out any of the 613 commandments that are not also part of the <em>Sheva Mitzvos Bnai Noach</em> (7 commandment categories non-Jews are subject to). As a result, there is no responsibility for anyone to arrange for a (meaningless) \"ceremony\". It is only a surgical procedure as with any other non-Jew. If, when the child grows up, he decides to convert, then he would be required to undergo circumcision.</p>\n\n<p>An analogy would be that a non-Jew does not have to eat kosher food and would not be considered as having fulfilled the mitzvah even if he does. Nor would it be a violation of anything if he eats non-kosher food.</p>\n\n\n",

Since sukka is a Torah commandment, inclusion in the miracle cannot form the basis for obligation.</p>\n<p>2)**<strong>Rav Yosef Engel in Gilyon Hashas Meggilah 4a</strong> presents one possible explanation, and sides with the view that inclusion in the miracle can only obligate women in rabbinic-level mitzvot:</p>\n<p>דמשום האי טעמא לא מיחייבא אלא במצוה דרבנן אבל במצוה דאוריתא אפי[לו] מדרבנן אין מתחייבת…והטעם דבדאורייתא לא אזלי[נן] כלל בתר טעמא ולא דרשי[נן] טעמא דקרא ואין להם לחכמים לחייב נשים אפי[לו] מדבריהם מפאת שאף הן…</p>\n<p><strong>Translation:</strong> “This rationale [inclusion in the miracle] can obligate a woman only in a rabbinic-level mitzva, but in a Torah-level mitzva, it cannot obligate her even rabbinically. The reason for this is that in Torah-level mitzvot we don’t legislate based on rationales [behind the mitzvot] and we don’t [even] legally expound rationales for verses. So the sages cannot obligate a woman, even rabbinically, [in a Torah-level mitzva] from the vantage of inclusion in the miracle.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When enacting new rabbinic decrees, the sages can decide whom to obligate and whom to exempt, based on rationales such as inclusion in the miracle. But the Torah itself decrees who is and is not obligated in Torah-level mitzvot. Our sages cannot alter the Torah’s legislation by invoking a rationale, like inclusion in the miracle, to create any sort of obligation in a Torah-level mitzvah.</p>\n<p>3)<strong>Iggerot Ha-Grid Ha-Levi' (in Hilchos Chanukah 4:9-11):</strong></p>\n<p>נראה פשוט דכל הך טעמא של אף הן היו באותו הנס שייך רק לאותן המצוות דהנס הוא דין וחלות בפני עצמו בעצם קיום המצוה, דאיכא בה קיום של נס ופרסומי ניסא. … ועוד יותר הרי בנר חנוכה  ומקרא מגילה נתקנה ברכה בפני עצמה שעשה נסים, הרי דהך דינא של נס הוא קיום בעצם החפצא של המצוה ונתקנה ברכה עליה. והרי הך שאף הן היו באותו הנס מצינו רק גבי נר חנוכה ומקרא מגילה וארבע כוסות, והוא משום  דבכל הני מצות דין נס אינו רק טעם המצוה אלא דנאמר בעצם קיום ומעשה המצוה, וכדחזינן דאיכא ברכה מיוחדת עליה, אבל קידוש ומצה, נהי דאיכא בהם זכרון הנס, אבל דין קיום וחלות בפני עצמם בעצם מעשה המצוה הרי ליכא, ואם כן לכאורה כל הך טעמא של אף הן היו באותו הנס לא שייך</p>\n<p><strong>Translation:</strong> “It seems clear that this entire reason of ‘af hen hayu be-oto ha-nes‘ applies only to those mitzvot where the miracle constitutes an independent halakhic entity within the actual fulfillment of the mitzva, that it [the mitzva] entails a fulfillment regarding the miracle and publicizing the miracle… Moreover, regarding Chanuka candles and Megilla reading, a separate berakha was instituted – ‘she-asa nisim,’ for this halakha concerning the miracle constitutes a fulfillment within the actual mitzva itself, and so a berakha is established over it. Indeed, we find‘af hen hayu be-oto ha-nes‘ only regarding Chanuka candles, Megilla reading, and the four cups. This is due to the fact that in all these mitzvot, the halakha concerning the miracle is not merely the reason behind the mitzva, but is rather established as part of the actual fulfillment and act of the mitzva, as evidenced by the special berakha instituted over it. Regarding kiddush and matza, by contrast, although they involve a commemoration of the miracle, there is no independent halakha, requirement or entity within the actual mitzva act. It would therefore seem that the entire factor of ‘af hen hayu be-oto ha-nes‘ does not apply.”</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Rav Soloveitchik distinguishes commandments that include commemoration of a miracle, such as kiddush and matza, from commandments whose very fulfillment involves publicizing the miracle, such as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s three. As proof for this distinction he notes that we recite unique berachot before the fulfillment of mitzvot that publicize a miracle: she-asa nissim for Chanuka candles and megilla reading, and asher ga’alanu over the wine on Pesach. When a mitzva commemorates a miracle, that commemoration can still be peripheral to its fulfillment, so not everyone included in the miracle is obligated. In contrast, when publicizing a miracle is central to fulfillment of a mitzva, anyone included in the miracle must take part in publicizing it further.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to Rashi (Pesachim 108b), ״אף הן היו באותו הנס” means that they also had a part in bringing about the miracle - the exodus of Egypt was in the Merit of the righteous women, Esther by Purim, and Yehudis by Chanukah -</p>\n<p>According to this, maybe this is the reason why they are exempt from Succah, being that the clouds of glory - which the Mitzvah of Succah commemorates - did not come in the merit of women, but for Aharon</p>\n\n\n",

Even if it gives separate instructions for what to do in case of tithing out of doubt (where tithing is only likely and not surely necessary, i.e. where one acquired the produce from an unreliable source rather than, say, grew it), those instructions do not say to skip taking <em>t'ruma</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, something has changed over the years.

    "content": "# Source for Simchas Beis HaShoeivah nowadays\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the time when the Temple stood in Jerusalem, there was a ceremony called the Simchas Beis HaShoeivah. The central aspect of the event is, as the name implies, the drawing of water and pouring it as a libation onto the Alter. The event would continue with dancing for the greatest members of Yisrael, and musical festivities. The entire event is described in the fifth chapter of <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mesechet Sukkah</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many communities today hold what they call a Simchas Beis Hashoeivah as well. However, aside for singing and dancing (almost universal among every Jewish get-together), it seems to share nothing inherently in common with the event held in the Temple. In general, the notion of creating a mock- Temple event seems a little peculiar. </p>\nIs there a source for the contemporary practice of a \"Simchas Beis Hashoeivah\" celebration?

And the elders and people of\n  accomplishment [did so] as they did in the Bais HaMikdash. As it is\n  written <em>\"ציון היא דורש אין לה\"</em> which implies that it (Tzion) requires searching out.\n  And it is guaranteed to them <em>simcha</em> every year, as the early decisors\n  wrote. And it has been a number of years that they acted in this manner, and\n  so it will be continually. Just as He dwelt wit you in your poverty,\n  so too will it occur to you in your wealth. And they will merit to\n  rejoice in our Bais HaMikdash.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shortly thereafter, it seems the custom spread quite quickly across the globe.

This is because the natural order of existence was set by God in the most perfect way possible, and when necessity, due to providence, requires a change from this order, it is appropriate that God should divert from this as little as possible. Therefore God does not perform these miracles except via causes that divert very little from nature. (Ralbag, Commentary to Genesis, 6-9, HaTo’eles HaShevi’i)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam does not say, in this following quote, his reason explicitly, but while believing in miracles, won't ascribe to miracle what can be ascribed to natural law:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…Our efforts, and the efforts of select individuals, are in contrast to the efforts of the masses. For with the masses who are people of the Torah, that which is beloved to them and tasty to their folly is that they should place Torah and rational thinking as two opposite extremes, and will derive everything impossible as distinct from that which is reasonable, and they say that it is a miracle, and they flee from something being in accordance with natural law, whether with something recounted from past events, with something that is in the present, or with something which is said to happen in the future. But we shall endeavor to integrate the Torah with rational thought, leading events according to the natural order wherever possible; only with something that is clarified to be a miracle and cannot be otherwise explained at all will we say that it is a miracle. (Rambam, Treatise Concerning the Resurrection of the Dead)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Slifkin, in citing these two, summarizes it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One aspect of the rationalist approach is its approach to the natural order. The rationalist approach perceives nature as a superior way for God to run the world than using miracles. Related to this is the rationalist approach of seeing the natural order as being pervasive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can also refer to the book <a href=\"http://www.mohamedrabeea.com/books/book1_9039.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">History of Jewish Philosophy</a>, in a chapter by Howard Kreisel, where he describes Rambam's position as follows, that the world is a perfect creation which therefore requires no changes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maimonides goes to great lengths to show that all the prophecies regarding the end of the world are figurative descriptions of historical events. He regards the order in the world as being immutable, the world being a perfect creation requiring no changes. For this reason he even partially “naturalizes” the phenomenon of miracles. He cites, with apparent approval, the rabbinic dictum that, in the creation of the various elements, God implanted the miracles destined to occur (2.29).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding whether the sun in Giveon actually stopped, Ibn Balaam (who thinks it did) <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=sqmMqbZwTXEC&lpg=PA76&dq=jewish%20rationalists%20miracles%20perfection%20creation&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=jewish%20rationalists%20miracles%20perfection%20creation&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">records</a> (page 75) the following argument with R' Moshe ibn Gikatilla:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ibn Gikatilla believes that [the sun] did not stand still, but only the shadow (al fay') remained behind so that the light would continue.</p>\n<p>I once asked him: Is the shadow not the impression of the cause [= the source of the light], that is, the sun? He answered: Yes. I said to him: If the cause ceases to exist, will its impression also not nec-essarily (darfira) cease to exist? And he answered that the miracle here was that the light remained behind, although [the source] illuminat-ing it had set. And I said to him: What has brought you to such an opinion? He said: In my view, a cessation of the permanent motion (al-kharaka al-de bna) is not possible.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Dov Shṿarts, in <em>Central Problems of Medieval Jewish Philosophy</em> (linked above), writes about this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, Ibn Balaam ignores Gikatilla's last, rational argument, namely, that the laws of nature are absolutely inviolable. Underlying this argument, probably, was Gikatilla's belief that nature as created by God was perfect, and violation of its laws was inconsistent with the perfection of divinely created things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=sqmMqbZwTXEC&lpg=PA76&dq=jewish%20rationalists%20miracles%20perfection%20creation&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q=jewish%20rationalists%20miracles%20perfection%20creation&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel ben Chofni Gaon</a> records his dispute with contemporary Jewish rationalists, where he had heard them propound naturalist interpretations of the event at Giveon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People have in the past denied this, saying, Had the sphere stood still, the earth would not have remained in its place; and they said that [the earth] stands in the middle only through the motion of the sphere, so that if [the sphere] had stood still, [the earth] would not, therefore have remained in its place. It may therefore be said to them: Do you not admit that the Ancient One, may He be exalted, is able to make everything stand still? And if they should say, Yes, they must admit that such a standstill is logically possible, and that the standstill is necessitated by the true tradition. And [even] if they say otherwise, they are after all speaking of confirmation of the fact that die Creator is capable on His own [= omnipotent]. And if that be confirmed, what the Bible says of Joshua's situation is not impos-sible, and Scripture has said, \"He it is who stretched out Zaphon over chaos, who suspended earth over emptiness\" (Job 26:7). And others have desired to explain the biblical account of this episode in such a way as to reconcile themselves to the laws of nature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both Shmuel ben Chofni Gaon and his anonymous disputants agree with Hashem's omnipotence. What underlies their naturalist interpretation? Dr. Dov Shṿarts (page 78) gives two possibilities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, R. Samuel's major theological argument relics on the attribute of divine omnipotence (\"The Creator is capable on His own\"). Since God's abilities are unlimited, nothing prevents Him from making the sun stand still, while at the same time maintaining the Earth's position. Since we do not know the precise arguments of the anonymous commentators mentioned, the debate may be aimed at either of two alternatives (or at both): (i) one theological argument (omnipotence) versus another (the perfection of God's creation); (ii) a theological argument (omnipotence) versus a rationalist, philosophical argument (the universality and permanence of the laws of nature). It would appear, therefore, that the theological argument of divine omnipotence has won out over all other arguments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ibn Ezra also, based upon the perfection of Hashem's creation of the natural order, is of the belief that miracles will not violate the natural order. Dr. Dov Shṿarts writes (pg. 80):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ibn Ezra penned an enigmatic comment on the verse, \"The Rock His deeds are perfect, yea, all His ways are justice/law\" (Deut. 32:4), which was a crucial stimulant for philosophers discussing the sun's standstill. He first explains the term \"justice/law\" (Heb. mishpat) and then considers Joshua's miracle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yea, all His ways are law\"—for they do not vary, but they obey one single law, and that is the praise. For the actions of all created things vary according to their needs, but the actions of the Lord (were performed) for His Glory with might, in accordance with [divine] wis-dom, [and are therefore unchangeable]. And you cannot argue from the sun standing still, for its secret is clear from the words \"and the moon in the valley of Aijalon\" [Josh. 10:12], as I have explained in its place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The overall intent of the passage is clear: The laws of nature are fixed and stable, and the fact that the sun stood still for Joshua does not contradict this principle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Maimonides refers to the existence of miracles: In his “Guide for the Perplexed” III:17, he discusses how people without intellectual perfection are left to nature, while those who gain intellectual perfection are in some way recipients of God’s providence (providence: divine guidance; i.e. the way that God acts in the world on the behalf of individuals).\nThis leads readers to believe that Maimonides believes in supernatural miracles. However, while he uses the words “miracle” and “providence”, he has special definitions for those words.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides writes that God’s actions are never mediated by a violation of the laws of nature. Rather, all such interaction is by way of angels. Maimonides states that the layman’s understanding of the term “angel” is ignorant – to the wise man, Maimonides writes, one sees that what the Bible and Talmud refer to as “angels” are metaphors for the laws of nature, or the principles by which the physical universe operates, or even kinds of platonic eternal forms.</p>\n\n<p>In \"Maimonides' Thirteen Principles: the Last Word in Jewish Theology,\" Torah U-Madda Journal, Marc B. Shapiro (Modern Orthodox) writes :</p>\n\n<p>“One wonders whether any of the Orthodox spokesmen who have advocated acceptance of the Thirteen Principles are really aware of Maimonides’ view of reward and punishment, which goes against mainstream rabbinic tradition. Without going into detail, let it simple be stated that according to Maimonides there is no heavenly reward for the observance of mitzvot!\" </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, one wonders whether Orthodox spokesman are aware that according to Maimonides, God never interrupts the set laws of nature – ever.</p>\n\n<p>In “Miracles in Rambam’s Thought—a Function of Prophecy”, David Guttman writes:</p>\n\n<p>….”Following our understanding of Rambam we have defined miracles as properties present in nature that require certain convergences of cause and effect to occur. They are seen as miracles because of the way they occur either rarely or fortuitously. In reality they are preset and would occur with or without human (prophetic) intervention. It is up to the prophet to learn about them and use them where necessary. Depending on the circumstances and stakes involved, the level of certainty allows the prophet to act on his information. Moshe’s level of prophecy afforded him the courage and certainty to act even when the stakes involved put the future of the nation at risk.”</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ralbag is a good example that comes to mind. For example, Gersonides writes that Joshua did not perform this miracle since to perform this miracle would be greater than Moses, and Moses never performs this miracle. In other words, it would contradict Deuteronomy 34:10–12. Therefore, Gersonides felt that Joshua was speaking figuratively; that the army defeated the five nations while the sun was still in the sky. Maimonides agreed, writing that is it a song about the longest day of the year (Guide of the Perplexed 2:35).</p>\n<p>In short, the Rishonim felt that G-d created the world as the Bible states, “very good;” and therefore, there is no reason to alter natural law. Natural law is fixed and needs no change. Miracles are explained as natural phenomena that G-d created.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it safe to say that Eden, at least in a general sense, refers to Atzmus?

    "content": "# Can one charge coffee to one's room on Shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If one goes to a Hotel for Shabbos, can he order a coffee and charge it to his room, or is that forbidden, like other methods of buying food on Shabbos are? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Ramban in his commentary to Vayikra 23:24, explains that the Biblical word \"Shabaton\" is the Rabbinical source for forbidding business transactions on Shabbos. It implies that one should rest, by abstaining from weekday activity (commerce). </p>\n\n<p>Further support is taken by Chazal from Isaiah 58: 13-14. There it states that one should not pursue their needs on the Sabbath. This refers to business/ commerce. See also Nechemiah 13: 15-22. It is obvious there, that commerce is forbidden on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer goes so far as to say that based on the Ramban and others, one who operates his store/business on Shabbos is counted as a Mechallel Shabbos like someone who breaks any of the Torah laws of Shabbos. (Shailos U'Teshuvos on Choeshen Mishpat 195.) This would seem like it is counted as a D'Oraisa prohibition. (however, private transactions are admittedly forbidden merely due to the Rabbinical decree regarding writing. (see below; next comment)</p>\n\n<p>A second reason to prohibit buying and selling on the Sabbath (besides the above idea of refraining from business) is that the Rabbis prohibited these transactions because it would lead to the Biblical prohibition of writing; which is one of the 39 Biblical categories of forbidden Shabbos labor. (see the Rambam Laws of Shabbos ch. 23:12. \"...And so it is forbidden to acquire, sell, or rent as a decree, because he may come to write..\")</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, at first glance, it should be forbidden to buy a drink from a store on Shabbos. (or order one from a hotel's room service, to be written down on one's bill etc.)</p>\n\n<p>However, if the item you wish to buy is for the needs of that Shabbos or Yom Tov itself, (coffee Shabbos morning) (See Misnah Berurah 307:46) then one can order it under the following conditions.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>No one may use the words \"buy\" or \"sell\". You can say \"May I have/take..\" (see Mishnah Berurah 323:1).</p></li>\n<li><p>No one may mention that it will be \"..paid for after the Shabbos is over.\" You may hint by saying that \"things will be settled after Shabbos; or taken care of.\" See Shulchan Aruch 323:2 and Mishnah Berurah 307:44; also Magen Avraham 307:15</p></li>\n<li><p>No one may refer to the items by weight/measure, or price. (See Shulchan Aruch 323:4). Even referring to a previous balance is forbidden. (See the Rema on 323:4) One can say \"a bag of, 5 oranges, 3 packs, etc.\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course, obviously, a Jew may not actually open a store on Shabbos for the purpose of being available for \"Shabbos needs\" transactions. This is true even if all the above conditions are adhered to.</p>\n\n<p>So, one may order a coffee on Shabbos from room service, since the above conditions may be met. This applies to a Jewish hotel. A non-Jewish hotel seems like an easier concern. I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See mishna Shabbat  23, 1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מסכת שבת פרק כג, א; <strong>שואל אדם מחברו כדי יין וכדי שמן, ובלבד שלא יאמר הלווני</strong>; וכן שואלת אישה מחברתה כיכרות.  אם אין מאמינו--מניח טליתו אצלו,<em>ועושה עימו חשבון לאחר שבת</em>.  וכן ערב פסחים בירושלים שחל להיות בשבת, מניח טליתו אצלו ואוכל את פסחו, ועושה עימו חשבון לאחר יום טוב. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Borrowing on Shabbat and repaying promptly after Shabbat is allowed even if you need to leave your Talit as pledge. </p>\n\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim siman 307,  sayif 11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>השואל דבר מחבירו לא יאמר לו הלויני דמשמע לזמן מרובה ואיכא למיחש שמא יכתוב אלא יאמר לו השאילני ובלשון לעז שאין חילוק בין הלויני להשאילני צריך שיאמר תן לי:  ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem for which to trade is prohibited on Shabbat is because this could lead to a situation in which people write counts. To write is a Shabbat Work punished by stoning. If Chachomim have not stated that there is there such a risk, it's permitted.

    "content": "# May one sleep inside if one believes it will rain during sukkoth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The majority hold that it is forbidden to sleep for even a moment outside the sukkah. It is considered to be foolish to sleep in the sukkah if it's raining. However, all the sources I've found word this halakha along the lines of \"if it begins to rain, then he should go inside\". They don't seem to contemplate sleeping inside from the outset if it is forecasted to rain. Further, he is permitted to remain sleeping inside after the rain stops. So hypothetically, if one reasonably believed it would rain that night, may he sleep inside from the outset even though he would theoretically be comfortable in the sukkah at the time he goes to sleep if he is reasonably certain it will rain?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ritva' (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ritva_on_Sukkah.29a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukah 29a, s.v. ת\"ר היה אוכל</a>) says if one senses rain and a developing overcast (\"shamayim miskadrim b'avim\") you're patur from Sukah, under the same exemption as when it is actually raining -\"mitztaer\". This opinion was later relied upon by the Bikure Yaacov (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49325&st=&pgnum=27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">639:30</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The question contemporary Poskim deal with is if this concept applies to weather reports; that is, if meteorologists forecast rain which is not yet detectable in the sky, and it affects you setting yourself up in the Sukah for some time, like a long meal or going to sleep. So, the halachic jury is still out on this one.....</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Weather forecast are not always accurate and even when the predicted rain does come it may be delayed or possibly not fall in all the predicted locations equally.

What is a good way to recommend a different restaurant which is glatt kosher without offending him? </p>\n\n<p>Would a different response be appropriate for an Observant,  non-Observant or non-Jewish colleague?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>In most cases, when this sort of thing comes up I say something like: \"I have some dietary restrictions and wouldn't be able to eat there; could we meet at $other_restaurant instead?\".</p>\n\n<p>For someone known to be observant, I would instead say something like: \"last I heard they aren't kosher; has that changed?\"  That is, presume that the other person has the same problem you do.  So either he'll say \"no, they're under supervision now\" (great!) or he'll explain how he's planning to solve the problem (\"yeah, I know, but they have a fruit salad that works\").</p>\n\n<p>What to do if the person is a non-observant Jew is more complicated.  Unless it's someone you're close to, anything that sounds like rebuke over his non-observance is likely to cause resentment.  I've found that <em>modeling better behavior</em> without pushing works better, so I personally would use approximately the same approach as for gentiles, making it about <em>my</em> needs and leaving unsaid that perhaps he ought to be considering that too.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I've been assuming in this answer that this is a meeting between the two of you.  If, instead, it's a larger group for business purposes (your sales team is taking the customer out to a swanky steak house, for example), you might be better off going and drinking a Coke than trying to influence the decision.

The Rema does not argue here. The Magen Avraham mentions (532) that anyone who is on the exempt list in law 531 for haircutting, is also automatically exempted from any prohibition of nail cutting. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, S.A. 532:2 says that any medical need is permitted on chol hamoed.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, a baby's nails (child) may certainly be cut to save the baby from hurting itself (medical need).</p>\n\n<p>If this were a problem on Shabbos or Yom Tov (a much stricter case), a Rav should be consulted on what to do in a specific case. (A Rav might say perhaps that it is no danger to wait until Saturday night, or perhaps ask a gentile nursemaid to cut them for you... etc.)</p>\n\n<p>May you have lots of Yiddishe nachas and happiness from your new baby !</p>\n\n\n",

Why? If you buy a car and you get a\n  special key for your car and you don't use your key, can you open your\n  car? Even if you get a golden key and got it from the Queen of\n  England, it wont open your car. You need your own key for your car. If\n  you belong to a specific שבט, the only way for you to have your תפלה\n  accepted is to use your particular נוסח which was given to your\n  people, for your שבט. It's not going to help you if you if you use\n  something else. I am going to read out a few words from Rav Chaim\n  Vital. He says that there are many שינוים between the תפלות in the\n  סידורים of ספרד, Catalonia (in Spain itself there were two נוסחאות or\n  more), and מנהג אשכנז (which is the old German מנהגים which eventually\n  became אשכנז in the rest of Europe. Says the Arizal - אמר לי מורי ז''ל\n  (my Rebbe taught me): that we have twelve windows in heaven for the\n  י''ב שבטים and he builds it on the פסוקים in יחזקאל and there would\n  have been no need for twelve windows in heaven unless each שבט had its\n  own way. כי כפי שורש ומקור נשמת השבט ההוא כך צורך להיות סדר תפלתו. The\n  שורש הנשמה - we all have נשמות here and our נשמות cannot go on\n  different patterns than the ones which were given to us. Our נשמה is\n  linked with this window in שמים and it has its own way. If we start\n  now to play around with it, all our efforts even if we daven all day\n  long and we accept the מנהגי Gra, and מנהגי בעל שם טוב and the Arizal\n  and Rav Chaim Vital and the Chida - we did all their חומרות - it wont\n  help. If you belong to אשכנז or belong to ספרד or belong to Yemen, you\n  belong to that שבט. And the Arizal says because we don't know which\n  שבט we are from, everyone is מוחזק that where he comes from, that's\n  his own נוסח and his שבט - <strong>one must not change</strong>. A ספרד person must\n  not daven אשכנז and אשכנז person must not daven ספרד - <strong>there is no\n  way out of it</strong>. And he says 'and if a person שהרוצה לקרוא מנהג ההוא\n  and he changes it - ועתה בא לבטלו - he goes to the other one, אין\n  תפלתו עולה למעלה.' Now, one could say that's all fine for תפלות, but\n  we are talking about an item like תקיעות. Comes the של''ה הקדוש and he\n  say no - this doesn't mean just תפלות - he talked about תפלות but he\n  meant the rest of it. האריז''ל היה אומר כמו שיש דל''ת דגלים סביב המשכן\n  - like there were four דגלים around the Mishkon - כך יש דל''ת כיתות בישראל - there are four camps in Israel. וחלוקים באיזה מנהגים - not\n  תפלות, he says מנהגים. b  ספרד, אשכנז, קאטלוניה, איטליה וכל אחד ישאר\n  בדגלו לנהוג מנהגו - everyone needs to stick to his מנהג. Now, my\n  question is this - <strong>if I am not a Yemenite and I'm listening to the\n  wonderful Yemenite מסורה - will it help me?</strong> If you look at the\n  אריז''ל and his commentators - <strong>it doesn't help me.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To answer your question: No. You should not and must not change to the Yemenite מסורה in anything if you are not a תימני.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes you can change it. In fact, not only can you change it, you can change it whenever you want, over and over again.</p>\n<p>There's no such thing as a binding \"positive\" minhag. Although the idea of a positive binding minhag has taken over present day thought, it's a recent phenomena.</p>\n<p>The first large source to deal with this issue came from the Maharashdam (Rav Shmuel deMedina of the 16th Century), a large Turkish posek who was quoted by Sephardim and Ashkenazim after him. The issue was that after the expulsion of Spanish Jews from Spain, the indigenous Turkish Jews found themselves outnumbered by the Sepharadim. Now most of the Synagogues were using Nusach Sepharadi, and the Turkish Jews wanted to know if they had to use the Sephardi Nusach of prayers (the community standard), or if they could continue to use the prayers of Nusach Turkey.</p>\n<p>He ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בטורקיה נתקבל נוסח הספרדים. וקמו מערערים לומר שרוצים להתפלל כסדר\nמנהג אבותיהם.\nז\"ל שו\"ת מהרשד\"ם (אורח חיים סימן לה), לא מצאנו ולא ראינו שאין לשנות\nמנהג אבותינו כי אם בדבר שיש בו נידנוד איסור.\nבכי-האי-גוונא דליכא צד איסור כלל ועיקר, ולא הרחקת עבירה -- בהא פשיטא\nדלא שייך ביה משום \"אל תטוש תורת אמך\".\nוכן יש לדקדק מלשון הר\"ן שכתב (פסחים פרק ד ד\"ה ונמצינו = דף יז ע\"ב בדפי\nהרי\"ף): נמצינו למדים בתורת המנהגות שכל מנהג איסור שהוא מעיר אחת -- כל שאינו\nמנהג בטעות אלא שהם החמירו על עצמן לעשות סייג לתורה או לדבר שהוא מחלוקת\nבין חכמי ישראל ונהגו כדברי האוסר כל בני העיר, חייבין בו מן הדין, ואפילו בצינעא, עד\nשיעקור דירתו משם ויקבענה בעיר אחרת, עכ\"ל הר\"ן.\nומדאמר הר\"ן שכל מנהג איסור וכו', ולא קאמר שכל מנהג סתם, משמע דלא\nאמרינן הכי אלא בדבר איסור שנהגו במקומו הוא דאין לשנות. הא במידי דליכא צד\nאיסור כלל -- פשיטא שאין קפידא כלל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Summary: We have not found and we have not seen any example to block the change of your ancestral minhag. except, in minhagim which have a minud (a little bit of) prohibition in them. And he states this is not his new idea, but rather it was taught by the Ran.</p>\n<p>In other words, the only obligatory minhagim are those that have prohibitions involved in them. In practical terms, this means that refraining from rice during Pesach would be a binding minhag that cannot be changed because you are prohibiting yourself of something. As clarified by <a href=\"http://www.webyeshiva.org/course/minhagim-the-nature-of-the-obligation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dovid Fink</a>, a noted posek in Jerusalem: The nusach of your prayers, or the method of wrapping your tefillin, etc, have no aspects of prohibition, and therefore you can change them as you please. In this case of the Turkish Jews, they were allowed to pray in Nusach Sepharad, or Nusach Turkey, whichever they wanted, whenever they wanted.</p>\n<p>You will find that if you scour the sources before the Maharashdam you will not find anyone arguing that all minhagim are binding. Instead, all the examples of binding minhagim will be those that have to do with prohibitions. The closest thing to a “binding” minhag of another type you’ll find is one single example, which is the minhag of beating the willows on Hoashana Rabba, but this isn’t a normal minhag. Rather it was a tradition instituted by the nevi’im (prophets) and is the only one of its kind. I can find more sources regarding this, including Rabbi Benzion Chai Uzziel the former Chief Rabbi of Eretz Yisrael. He released a Teshuva allowing people to change their Hebrew pronunciations however they wished since there's no such thing as a \"positive\" minhag.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are there any teachings about \"tough love?\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sometimes, in order for one to learn, one must experience the failure of the ideas one believes to be true which are, in fact, not true. If the student in this process is a child or someone under the care of another, this process can sometimes be called \"tough love.\"</p>\n\n<p>Are there any Jewish teachings on this topic?</p>\n\n<p>So,  true love is often tough. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Whilst it is necessary to always treat children with immense love, there are sometimes occasions when parents must exercise what has become known as ‘tough love’.  This means to do something for the greater good, at the cost of potentially upsetting the child. For example, all parents will at some point have to send their young children to the doctor to receive a vaccination. Naturally, the parent is looking out for their child’s long-term health and welfare, ensuring the prevention of any threatening disease. However, to the child this might appear as a betrayal of trust. How could their loving parent make them endure such a painful experience? In truth though, situations such as these hardly represent a test for parents as such action is the generally accepted protocol. However, it is with issues such as substance abuse that parents are confronted with major tribulations as to how to act. In a case like this, a parent is put in the heart-wrenching situation of wanting the best for their child without putting them in a hurtful position. Nevertheless, action must be taken if it is to curb self-destructive behaviour. This idea although hard to accept is a notion that is shared by the Midrash. We are told:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רשב״ל אומר כל מי שנעשה רחמן במקום אכזרי סוף שנעשה אכזרי במקום רחמן</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon ben Levi says: All those who are merciful with the cruel, will come to be cruel to the merciful (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kohelet_Rabbah.7.16.1?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koheles Rabbah 7:16</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that whilst it is normal for one to be benevolent to a person they love; there are times when administering kindness will actually be more harmful than good. Ultimately, every parent has their child’s best interests at heart. If this means doing something necessary that will upset the child, whilst it may be painful, it is still crucial that it be acted upon.</p>\n<p>It is inevitable that at some point in one’s live, a parent will have to take the harsher route, even in instances where it may seem that exercising tough love is never an option. For example, the תורה commands:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל אלמנה ויתום לא תענון</p>\n<p>You shall not afflict any widow or orphan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 22:21</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first glance, it would seem that in such a delicate circumstance, a person must be very careful to show an elevated degree of sensitivity. Indeed, one would think that a person should greet such people with the utmost tenderness. However, Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.6.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos De'os 6:10</a>) notes that it is important to find a subtle balance. For the most part, it is important to treat them with this higher level of compassion, but there are instances when even these people must be guided with a more stringent approach. Rambam explains that a Rov is permitted to discipline them in order to teach them Torah, a craft or to set them on the straight path. Thus, even though one must predominantly treat the likes of orphans with care, it evidently must not come at the expense of over-indulgence. If one takes too muted an approach, orphans and the like will never learn how to take responsibility for themselves nor how to overcome the very real disadvantage that they have been faced with.</p>\n<p>One example of the need ‘to be cruel to be kind’ is found in the Hagada with The Four Sons. We are told concerning the wicked son, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_The_Four_Sons.3?vhe=Pesach_Haggadah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רשע</a>, that the best form of action is to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הקהה את שניו</p>\n<p>Blunt his teeth</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many mefarshim mention the famous dvar Torah surrounding this text: The gematria (numerical value) of \"רשע\" adds up to 570. We are instructed to knock out his teeth; therefore, if one takes the numerical value of שניו (366) and subtracts it from the (רשע (570, one is left with a (צדיק (204 – a righteous person. Perhaps we can take strength from this idea. In times when one needs to exercise tough love, it can be an emotionally formidable task. A parent is likely to feel the burden of their predicament weighing down on their shoulders as they consider how best to approach the situation. However, with guidance and perseverance, the end result, with Hashem’s help, will be positive.</p>\n<p>Also see Rabbi Twerski’s <a href=\"https://www.judaica-world.com/index.php/not-just-stories-hardcover.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Not Just Stories: The Chassidic Spirit through its Classic Stories</em></a>, (Shaar Press – 1997), pp. 136-137 has nice write up on this topic.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Proverbs 13, 24:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יג,כד  חוֹשֵׂךְ שִׁבְטוֹ, שׂוֹנֵא בְנוֹ;    וְאֹהֲבוֹ, שִׁחֲרוֹ מוּסָר. ‏</p>\n<p>He that spareth his rod hateth his son; but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.</p>\n<p>חושך שבטו. מי שהוא מונע שבטו מהכות בנו ליסרו הוא שונאו כי מפני זה יהיה באין מוסר ומי שהוא אוהבו שחרו מוסר בקטנותו לחנכו במוסר על פי דרכו: (רלב\"ג) ‏</p>\n<p>Gershonides explains that a father who refrains\nfrom punishing his son,  this father hates his son because the child will become rude.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He writes that the default concept of <em>yir'ah</em> without a qualifier is <em>yir'as hacheit</em>. To explain how it differs from fear of punishment, <em>yir'as hacheit</em> is fear of doing the wrong thing because it's the wrong thing. Someone with <em>yir'as ha'onesh</em> is afraid of being personally hurt, something with <em>yir'as hacheit</em> is afraid of defying what G-d wants as an end in itself.</p>\n<p>Someone without <em>yir'as hacheit</em>, who has no fear of doing something that defies Hashem's Plan for their life and for creation, will never get beyond focusing on their physical needs, and will never learn to delay beyond immediate gratification to find real meaning. Such people will never grow beyond operating on the animal level.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim Volozhiner writes (Nefesh haChaim 4:5):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the measure of the “silo” of <em>yir’ah</em> that the person prepared for himself, it is by that same measure that the “grain” of Torah will be able to enter, guarded and fulfilled within him, according to what the silo can hold.</p>\n<p>It is [like] a father who divides grain for his sons.  He divides it out and gives each one a measure of grain to match what the son’s silo can hold, which he [the son] prepared beforehand.  For even if the father wishes and his hand is open to give him more, the son cannot receive more since his silo is not big enough to hold more.  So too the father cannot now give him more.  And if the son did not prepare even a small silo, then also the father can not give him anything at all – for he has no guarded place where it will remain with him.</p>\n<p>So too Hashem, may His name be blessed:  His “Hand” is open, as it were, to constantly bestow every person according to his reward with much wisdom and extra understanding – when it will be preserved by them and will be tied onto the slate of their hearts.  Everything [is given] according to the volume of one’s “silo.” And if a person does not prepare even a small silo, which is that he does not, heaven forbid, have within him any <em>yir’ah</em> whatsoever for Him, may He be blessed, so too He, may He be blessed, will not bestow any wisdom at all, since it will not be preserved by him.  For his Torah would become disgusting, heaven forbid, as our Rabbis, whose memories are a blessing, said.  It is about this that the verse says, “the beginning of wisdom is <em>yir’as Hashem</em>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone who has no drive to pursue higher goals may have free will in principle, he lacks the countervailing drive to choose the spiritual path over the animal one. He doesn't speak the Torah's language.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think it can be understood in light of his earlier comments: \"Is it appropriate that we exert our intellects in speculation that we are not obligated in, in fruitless argumentation....and the great obligation to our Creator [which the Ramchal describes elsewhere as ideally being the central focus of one's life] we leave to mindless habit?\"  </p>\n\n<p>In other words, because fear of God plays such a central role in the fulfillment of one's life's purpose, it is fundamentally different from other fields of knowledge. Relative to the others, it is the only 'true' field of knowledge - in the sense that it is the field of knowledge that has ultimate significance and consequence. </p>\n\n\n",

In that case, the kohen must divorce her. However, if the kohen marries a permitted woman (widow for a regular kohen or virgin for a kohen gadol), then their children are kohanim. The reason is that the kohen does not lose his status as a kohen once he has left the forbidden woman.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/468267/jewish/Kohen-Marriages.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohen Marriages</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A kohen may not marry a ge’rusha (divorcee), chalalah (woman of\n  defective kohen status), zonah (woman who previously violated certain\n  sexual prohibitions), giyoret (convert) or chalutzah (a Levirate\n  widow).

Generally in strong acute P. Events the patient is 100% halachically defined as Shote and is patur from Teshuva.

Some persons has not good reality testing but conserve a +- good judgment  concerning social behavior.  They are psychotic but not  Shote. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the secular law the definition concerning capacity is not an exact replication of medical diagnosis.</p>\n\n<p>See Rambam Gerushin 2, 14:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[The following rules apply when] a person is <strong>troubled {terrified} by an evil spirit</strong>, and at the time when his infirmity begins to take hold of him says: \"Write a get for my wife.\" His statements are of no consequence, because his thoughts are not organized and settled.

Instead, it applies to anyone whose mind is disturbed and continually confused when it comes to <em>certain matters</em> although he can speak and ask questions to the point <em>regarding other matters</em></strong>. Such a person is considered unacceptable and is placed in the category of unstable people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding recollection of Avera, an other problem, see mishnayot in Shvuot, there are cases in which Korbanot, tsibur or yachid following the case, are adapted to problem of partial knowing. </p>\n\n<p>The two above halachot show by their appearent discrepancy that the matter is not so easy to decide.

Many outside Israel do hakafot on Shemini Atzeret to honor those in Israel who celebrate Simchat Torah on that night. Thus, the Israelis do likewise to honor those who live outside Israel who celebrate Simchat Torah</li>\n<li>Somewhat supporting the above idea is the concept that Succot, in particular, was meant as a holiday where both Jews and non-Jews gathered at the Temple in Jerusalem. I understand that numerous non-Jews come to Jerusalem during Succot, to this day, albeit without our Temple. Thus, Succot is notable as being a holiday of unity. There is a Midrash that says that G-d created Shmini Atzeret (Simchat Torah was a later concept) because our departing from him was difficult. Thus, G-d wanted Jews tolinger in Jerusalem an extra day to celebrate just with G-d. Thus, Shemni Atzeret is specifically a Jewish holiday. As this is meant for the gathering of Jews, and there are many Jews visiting Israel, perhaps this extra hakfa was meant also as a means of having them join in unity with their Israelis while in Israel visiting</li>\n<li>Isru Chag, which is the day following the holiday is mentioned in Shulchan Aruch as being a day of celebration and feasting, as well. The additional \"hakafot\" is partially attributed to Isru Chag.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

(The women's section of truly frum shuls often has no clue what is going on in the main service, mainly by virtue of architecture.) So I certainly could have missed something. That said, I don't recall ever having heard HaGomel made in shul, and certainly never by a woman--even though both men and women take transoceanic flights all the time (probably enough that a regular shul should have a HaGomel every week) and a significant number of authorities say that both men and women should bentch Gomel by a minyan. </p>\n\n<p>What's happening? Do people not bentch Gomel when they should? Why not? Why don't they ask for HaGomels at every Torah reading, like they do with Mi Sheibeirach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In my experience, people tend to say HaGomel in a quieter voice than just about anything else that the public is supposed to hear. I'm in the men's section and often can't make out what the person is saying, and sometimes can't even hear him at all. In such cases the tip off that it's HaGomel is the response of those who are closer to him and can hear it. So just because you don't hear it doesn't mean it's not happening! </p>\n\n<p>(As for the reason, I think that because it's a brocha that people don't say often and are therefore unfamiliar with, they're nervous about getting it right in front of the whole shul, so their voices get quieter. They often stammer through it in a halting, nervous manner.) </p>\n\n<p>In addition, as @DoubleAA pointed out in the comments, not everyone agrees that someone is required to make this brocha after a transoceanic flight.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Without knowing the demographics of your shul, I can only offer these possibilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hagomel is usually said following someone having an aliyah to the Torah. Thus, if someone does not get the aliyah, he may not be saying Hagomel, though, he should .. (next point)</li>\n<li>The aliyah is not a requirement, and it can be said by the person even after someone else's aliyah.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The above 2 make a general assumption in Orthodox shuls (which I gather is what you attend, given your description of being in the women's section) that men are receiving the aliyah, or Hagomel is made by a man in the men's section. This would explain why you aren't hearing women make the bracha, although, technically, they could from the women's section and everyone in shul could respond. Perhaps, shul minhag or protocol isn't allowing this.</p>\n\n<p>Another factor could be that people who SHOULD say Hagomel perhaps don't know when it should be said. I think most realize that they should say it after returning from the hospital / surgery or major illness. But, maybe they don't know that a transatlantic flight also qualifies them to say it, according to some opinions. There are others who feel that a flight doesn't necessitate the bracha.</p>\n\n<p>So, that pretty much may leave just those who are recovering from illness or were released from prison. Perhaps, you have a healthy congregation and no ex-convicts?</p>\n\n<p>As one of the comments mentioned, perhaps many of these people are saying it on a weekday when you might not be in shul? </p>\n\n<p>Or, the simplest reason - no one in your shul has experienced anything at all requiring them to say Hagomel.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In what way was Lemech foolish?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Rashi's second explanation (Bereishit 4:24 שבעים ושבעה) of what Lemech said to his wives, he explains that Lemech didn't kill anyone, but Ada and Tzila were worried because they knew the flood would come and kill all of Kayin's descendants, so they didn't want to have any more children.  Lemech argued that he hadn't killed anyone, so if Kayin was given 7 generations, he would be given 77.  Rashi says this is a קל וחמר של שטות.</p>\n\n<p>For something so foolish, it was amazingly accurate.  Based on the following Rashi, this happened in the year 129, around a year before Sheit was born.  Based on Rashi at the beginning of the perek, Kayin and (maybe) Hevel were born before Adam and Chava were thrown out of Gan Eden.  Kayin could have killed Hevel as early as the summer of year 1.</p>\n\n<p>Since 7 generations from Kayin ended in 129, 77 generations from Lemech would have ended no later than 129 + (129-1)*11 = 1537.  This is 1 year after Hashem decreed the flood (120 years before it happened, 1536).</p>\n\n<p>(Maybe you could play around with the numbers and lose another year.  I don't expect to be able to identify all the steps needed to make numbers come out exact unless I'm the Gr\"a, which I'm not.)</p>\n\n<p>I made some assumptions of when Kayin killed Hevel, but 1537 is an <em>upper</em> limit on when the 77 generations could have ended.  Lemech really did get 77 generations before the decree, and even more before his descendents were actually killed.</p>\n\n<p>Where's the שטות?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although your calculations are very interesting and thought provoking (I am sure they contain a lesson about Hashem listening to Lamech's claim etc.), the \"shtus\" or foolishness was not due to a wrong calculation.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, the reason why it is foolish has been given by Rashi. \"If so, then Hashem could never collect His due and keep his word.\"</p>\n\n<p>A kal vachomer is a logical argument, recognized by Hashem as a Torah true method of deduction. However, it has limits. One limit is that a logical proof cannot cause a reality that will nullify a specific Torah truth elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem had already decreed that a flood would wipe out Kayin etc. Hashem already was aware of Lamech's potential reasoning when He made that decree. He decided to make the decree anyway. This is possibly because the decree's importance outweighed and overrides Lamech's (or anyone's) potential claim. Perhaps Hashem would recognize Lamech's complaint and grant him something else to make up for his good behavior (Olam HaBah, or as you hint to, being granted 77 \"Kayin length\" generations?)  </p>\n\n<p>If there had been no specific Torah decree, then Lamech's logic would apply in the face of no opposition.</p>\n\n<p>But, once a decree is made, then logical proofs elsewhere have no force <strong><em>simply by virtue of logic</em></strong>. That is why the kal vachomer is foolish, even if the supplicant is granted what he wants. He may have been granted the claim through mercy working within the decree, but not by virtue of logical demand.</p>\n\n<p>A second reason may be the \"Dayo\" (\"enough\") principle as explained in chapter two of the Gemara Bava Kama. A K\"V is limited to grant only the conclusion of the first case, but no more than that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If his painting is worth $1,000.00, then mine is certainly worth $1,000,000.00!</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a foolish K\"V, because the conclusion is limited to the result of the first case and no more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If his painting is worth $1,000.00, then mine is certainly worth $1,000.00.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a correct K\"V, because my painting is logically worth just as much as his (not more). More cannot be proven using a logical comparison. So, Lamech could have reached for 7 generations for himself by logical comparison, but not 8; and certainly not 77.</p>\n\n\n",

In most situations, eating is prohibited before Havdala. But if he was eating (e.g.Seuda Shelishit which began before sundown), he can continue to eat, despite the end of Sabbath and even to drink (e.g. if he was eating peanuts and drinking wine), he can continue to drink coffee. But if he was drinking some beverage before sundown and continue until night, he need to stop the drinking. there is an opinion following which all the above is right only at a time which is not clearly night, but if there is clearly night, even in middle of meal, he need to cover the bread and to bless Havdala on a cup before the end of the meal. RMA said that the first opinion is most spread.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 299, 1:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>אסור לאכול שום דבר או אפילו לשתות יין או שאר משקין חוץ ממים משתחשך עד\n  שיבדיל</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>אבל אם היה יושב ואוכל מבעוד יום וחשכה לו אין צריך להפסיק (אפילו\n  משתיה) (בית יוסף). ‏</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>ואם היה יושב ושותה וחשכה לו צריך להפסיק:</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>ויש אומרים דהני מילי בספק\n  חשיכה אבל בודאי חשיכה אפילו היה יושב ואוכל פורס מפה ומבדיל וגומר\n  סעודתו: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>‏הגה: והמנהג פשוט כסברא הראשונה</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The source of the above Halachot is the snippet of Gemara immediately above the text cited by @RoshHaYeshiveh:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Said R'Amram to them, thus did Rab say: It makes [it an] appointed\n  [meal] in respect of kiddush, but it does not make [it an] appointed\n  [meal] in respect of habdalah.</p>\n  \n  <p>But that is only in respect of interrupting [the meal], viz. , that we\n  do not interrupt [it]; we may not however commence [one]. ; And\n  even about interrupting we said this with respect to eating only, but\n  not with respect to drinking.</p>\n  \n  <p>And with respect to drinking too we said this only of wine and beer:\n  but as for water, it does not matter.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now he differs from R'Huna.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Huna reported in name of Rabbi Akiva that to taste anything before havdala can lead to diphtheria. I am not sure that it is <em>the</em>  reason, the reason is apparently in the words of Rav Amram (Tur and Bet Yosef stated as Rav Amram, against Rav Huna probably because of  Rsv Ashi who is the latest Amora and disagreed with Rav Huna concerning water):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לקידוש - קובעת, ולא להבדלה קובעת. והני מילי - לענין מיפסק, דלא מפסקינן. \n  אבל אתחולי - לא מתחלינן. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shabbat is a caesura between before and after.  We are in duty to feel this concerning meals. Lifetime is delimited by Shabbat.  There are halachic translation:</p>\n\n<p>Shabbat fixed a prohibition to eat before Kiddush. Shabbat does also fix at its end a prohibition regarding eating before Havdala. This last point concerns only prohibition of beginning activities, but not prohibition to continue already started eating. Therefore to continue an already started drinking of beer (but not water) is prohibited.  </p>\n\n<p>If there is no wine,  see  SA 396:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם אין לו יין ולא שכר ושאר משקין יש אומרים שמותר לו לאכול ויש אומרים שאם מצפה שיהיה לו למחר לא יאכל עד למחר : ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some poskim who stated that he can eat and some else stated that if he will get wine tomorrow he cannot eat until the havdala of tomorrow. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are 2 Havdalas on shabbat.  One in the davening, and one on a cup.  There are 2 aspects to shabbat - shomor (keep) and zachor (remember).

    "title": "Range of Five Payments",
    "content": "# Range of Five Payments\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is known that if a man strikes another man, the damager must pay \"Five Payments\" - Nezek (damage), Tza'ar (pain), Ripui (doctors' bills), Sheves (unemployment), and Boshes (embarrassment). (<em>This is an explicit series of Mishnayos in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kama Chapter 8</a></em>.)</p>\n<p>What is the halacha if Reuven were to, c\"v paralyze Shimon such that Shimon is permanently stuck in a wheelchair? He obviously has to pay the same Five Payments. But is there a chiyuv for Reuven to pay for the fact that Shimon's life will never be the same? Is there a payment for forcing him into a lower quality of life, to which he will now have to become adjusted? <strong>Is there anything that can force Reuven to pay for Shimon's emotional pain from being unable to walk?</strong></p>\n<h1>Is it Nezek?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>No, the payment for damages is calculated by finding the loss in his value on the slave market. There's nothing in the calculation regarding payment for his quality of life, only what he's able to accomplish as a slave.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Is it Tza'ar?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>No. Tza'ar is how much one would demand to undergo pain. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Mishnah</a> gives the example of a fingernail injury \"in which there is no wound,\" so it would seem to apply to physical pain only, not emotional pain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Is it Ripui?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>I think we can all agree that quality of life isn't included in doctors' bills. As @DoubleAA pointed out, Reuven would be liable for the disability tools, but I don't see how there can be a payment for a lower quality of life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Is it Sheves?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Still no. First of all, Shimon might have been able to get his job back. Even if he couldn't, he likely would have been able to get another job. As the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah</a> makes clear, Sheves is paid as if he's a cucumber watcher, i.e. absolute minimum wage. As long as he gets <em>any</em> job, Sheves will not cover his new quality of life.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What about Boshes?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps you could argue, as @DoubleAA did, that there's a measure of embarrassment of being that nebach rolling around on the street in his wheelchair, but it doesn't exactly cover his lower quality of life.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So there's three options I see here at this point. Possibly the likeliest is that I've completely misunderstood what one or more of these categories cover, and indeed emotional pain is covered by one of them. The second option is that there's another payment I'm unaware of. And the third option is that, indeed, Chazal did not make a payment to cover emotional pain. So which is it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Mishnah (Babba Kama 90a) gives examples of shaming people and the various fines owed for each offense.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah on 92a, then goes on to say: \"..even though he paid the fine, he is not forgiven until he seeks forgiveness from him...\"</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara immediately comments: \"Tannu Rabbanan: All these fines are merely payment for the embarrassment caused. However, for the <strong><em>(emotional) pain</em></strong>, even if he offered all the rams of Nevayot in the world, he is not forgiven until he seeks forgiveness from him....\"</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains the meaning of the word \"pain\" used here as opposed to embarrassment itself. \"BUT THE PAIN\" : \"That he <strong><em>worries over</em></strong> his shame; for that there is no forgiveness.\"</p>\n\n<p>We see from here that the Boshet payment does not cover the mental anguish caused at all. In fact, the \"Tzar\" payment doesn't cover it either (or any of the 5 payments). He just has to secure forgiveness from the victim somehow.</p>\n\n<p>This makes sense when we also read Babba Kamma 85a. The Gemara asks how to calculate the payment for physical pain. The Gemara suggests that we establish how much this fellow would wish to earn if a sadist would pay him for the right to chop his hand off with a sword, instead of using a painless method (like a withering oil).</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara quickly rejects this idea by simply saying: \"Are we dealing with the insane??!!\" No one would accept any amount for such a thing! (or the amount would be so astronomical as to be absurd). The Gemara does settle on calculating how much the victim would pay to reduce his sentence from a chop to a painless method (assuming that either way he would lose the arm).</p>\n\n<p>Now if it is so for the temporary pain of a chopped hand, then what is the calculation for living the ruined life suggested by the OP? Or what is the fee the victim would pay to get his normal life back?? </p>\n\n<p>Since we are now dealing with intangibles, we can see how hard or outright impossible this would be to settle with money. Hence, anguish can only be paid for with forgiveness.</p>\n\n<p>R' Meir of Rottenburg holds that O'naas Devarim (the sin of hurting someone's feelings with words..which includes all kinds of mental and emotional anguish) is actually punishable by lashes. He explains this is because money doesn't help. So, another punishment that is fitting is used instead.</p>\n\n<p>The Mordechai also holds that the punishment is lashes. Those that argue with them about lashes, admit that money is no substitute either. (The Bes Yosef questions their opinion about lashes in Choshen Mishpat 1).</p>\n\n<p>Even if there were some clear way to calculate such a payment, we are stuck nowadays with the fact that Beis Din today lacks Semichah from Eretz Yisrael and therefore cannot enact fines. (Choshen Mishpat 1:2)</p>\n\n<p>However, Rav Yitzchak Zilberstein discussed a case with his father in-law, Rav Elyashiv Zt\"l. A dentist had slapped a patient. The patient was so outraged and the dentist was so remorseful, that the dentist offered and paid $10,000.00 for the patient to forgive him. This was considered about 4-5 times the amount the Gemara prescribes for a slap to the face.</p>\n\n<p>He points out that Bes Din today would have the right to impose a ban (cherem) on the offender until he placated his victim with a proper payment (Choshen Mishpat 1:5) even if they lack proper semicha authority. I am extrapolating, that such a grave offense like the OP envisions c'v, especially if done on purpose, would certainly trigger a Bes Din's right to enforce a ban until the offender offered a proper compensation. But I do not know if the case is truly similar.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, he does quote his father in-law as saying that if the victim truly feels that he wants that sum and no less, and if the offender is really agreeable, then the transaction is good and effective. It is not theft to accept the payoff. However, if the victim is pious, he should not demand such a sum.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, it seems everything is up to the intent, the feelings of both parties (especially the victim), and the healing of time?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(<em>Note: The following is from my own Sevaras based on my current understanding I do not claim that this answer is valid. Take the following with a grain of salt.</em>)</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Emotional pain</em></strong> different from Boshes is something which the individual feels separate of the other five payments, in that it can not be measured objectively from a Judge but rather is stated judged by the individual. </p>\n\n<p>Concepts discussed in Shas, for example in the Mishna in Kesubos 2:9 of אין אדם מעיד על ידי עצמו and in Sanhedrin 9b of אדם קרוב אצל עצמו which seem to imply that allowing a party involved to have an active role in deciding what a Halachic decision would create a possibility for corruption, so Chazal set it up so as to minimize the possibility of dishonesty and maximize impartiality in judging cases.</p>\n\n<p>That being said to have that as a measurement for a fine would mean that it is up to the damaged to decide, which leaves no room for scrutiny by Beis Din. This would create a possibility for dishonesty and removes the impartiality in its assessment of the payment, which would invalidate it as a form of fine.</p>\n\n<p>(<em>Take this with a grain of salt</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Hope this is insightful. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can you benefit from a lost animal while waiting to find the owner?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If we find a lost animal we must return it to its owner (seen most recently on Bava Metzia 30, but I know this is codified elsewhere and said directly in D'varim).  I also understand that we must care for it until that happens (I've heard this in the name of the Rambam, for one).  While waiting, is one allowed to derive benefit from the animal, if doing so doesn't decrease the animal's value?</p>\n\n<p>For example, a cow that is not milked when it needs to be suffers some pain.  Therefore, it seems that you would be required to milk the cow as part of caring for it.  Having done so, is the milk yours?</p>\n\n<p>A different example: after a hen lays eggs the bird is not further affected if you do or don't take the eggs.  Are the eggs yours?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not asking about working the animal (for example using a found ox to plow your field), which could lead to the animal being injured so might be a different case.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Babba Metziah 28b - 29a discusses the issue of reimbursing the finder for his expenses in caring for the lost animal. </p>\n\n<p>The idea is based on Devarim 22:2. The Mishnah points out that the verse tells us to return the lost object to its owner. So, infers the Mishnah, there must be something left to return. Therefore, an animal is not kept under the finder's care to rack up expenses, because then there would be nothing left to return!</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara then goes on to discuss various animals that earn their keep or not. In general, animals that can be worked to pay for their own feed, are worked and fed (up to 12 months, then sold). Animals that cannot earn their own keep are sold after a short time. The money belongs to the original owner, not the finder. However, the Gemara questions if the owner may borrow the money meanwhile.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088897/jewish/Gezelah-vaAvedah-Chapter-Thirteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, laws of gezeilah and aveidah 13:15-19</a> codifies this Gemara into law.</p>\n\n<p>Cows and donkeys may be rented out for work. Chicken eggs may be sold. The proceeds are used to feed the lost animals. After 12 months, the Rambam says that the value of the animal is assessed, and the finder becomes a partner with the original owner.</p>\n\n<p>Other animals have 3 month, 30 day, and 3 day limits until they are sold, because it is too expensive to feed them. So too, anything that is produce of the animal belongs to the original owner. However, if it will rot, it should be sold.</p>\n\n<p>The money may be used by the finder as a loan (apparently until the owner comes seeking his lost livestock). If someone finds a wallet, he cannot use the money. The reason the finder of an animal (who then sells it later) may borrow the money, is as an acknowledgment of his troubles dealing with the live animal for his brother.</p>\n\n\n",

In terms of content it speaks of restoring the sacrificial service and the allowance that prayer replaces sacrifice as mentioned in the R'tzei in all of our prayers.</p>\n\n<p>Because this introduces duchening, I would assume that the \"entreaty\" referred to is the priestly blessing and that, like prayer itself taking the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/76548/1362\">place</a> of sacrifice, we would like this prayer (or maybe, some other entreaty in the Amida which we make) to be as pleasing as a sacrifice.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure why we need this intro to duchening in general but also wonder why then we don't need it when we duchen in the shacharit service of Simchat Torah [as per the Kitzur, 138:8 סעיף ח\nביום שמחת תורה נוהגין בהרבה מקומות שהכהנים נושאים כפיהם בתפלת שחרית ולא במוסף משום דבמוסף יש חשש שכרות, ואין אומרים ותערב בתפלת שחרית copied from <a href=\"http://www.shtaygen.co.il/?CategoryID=1650&ArticleID=7227\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.]</p>\n\n<p>What does the paragraph mean or accomplish that it is called for before duchening and why is that need absent in Shacharit?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%91%D7%9C_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95_%D7%99%D7%97_%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Chevel Nachalato</em> 18:3</a> discusses this.

לכהנים לעלות לדוכן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Soloveitchik (<em>Shiurim le-Zecher Abba Mari</em>) explained the purpose of ותערב in a different manner, in light of his explanation of Retzei as the blessing in which prayer is transformed into sacrifice: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שתי חלויות ישנן בתפלה: א) שיח, וכלשון הברייתא (ברכות כו, ב) לגבי תקנת\n  תפלת מנחה: \"יצחק תקן תפלת מנחה שנאמר ויצא יצמק לשוח בשדה לפנות ערב\n  ואין שיחה אלא תפלה שנאמר תפלה לעני כי יעטף ולפני ה' ישפך שיחו\". חלות\n  זו מושרשת בתקנת אבות. הם תקנו את התפלה כשיח האדם אל הקב\"ה. ב) כקרבן;\n  ישנו קיום קרבן בתפלה. אדם מקריב את עצמו בשעה שהוא מתפלל. קיום זה נעוץ\n  בתקנת תפלות כנגד תמידים. והנה בתפלת שמנה עשרה אנו אומרים שתי ברכות\n  רצופות. \"שמע קולנו\" ו\"רצה\", אשר תוכנן, לפום ריהטא, די דומה, שהרי שתיהן\n  מבקשות קבלת התפלה: \"שמע קולנו ה' א-להינו חוס ורחם עלינו וקבל ברחמים\n  וברצון את תפלתנו\", \"רצה ה' א-להינו בעמך ישראל ובתפלתם וכו' ואשי ישראל\n  ותפלתם באהבה תקבל ברצון וכו'\". ואם כן צריך עיון, למה התקינו חז\"ל שתי\n  הברכות ולא הסתפקו באחת מהן? התשובה פשוטה. ברכת \"שמע קולנו חוס ורחם\n  עלינו\" קשורה בתפלה כשיח, על פי הכתוב, \"תפלה לעני כי יעטף ולפני ה' ישפך\n  שיחו\". בברכה זו אנו מבקשים את הקב\"ה לקבל את שיח שפתותינו ולרחם עלינו.\n  ברכת רצה, לעומת זאת, אינה מבקשת כלל מילוי הצרכים והמאוויים, כי אם\n  ריצוי התפלה וקבלת אשי ישראל ביחד עם התפלה . קבלת הקרבן באה לידי ביטוי\n  בברכת רצה. עד רצה התפלה היא שיח; על ידי ברכה זו הופכת התפלה לקרבן. לכן\n  קשרו חז\"ל ברכת כהנים ברצה, וכמבואר בדברי ר' יהושע בן לוי (סוטה לח, ב),\n  \"כל כהן שאינו עולה בעבודה שוב אינו עולה שנאמר וישא אהרן את ידיו אל העם\n  ויברכם וירד מעשות החטאת והעולה והשלמים מה להלן בעבודה אף כאן בעבודה\",\n  דתיכף כשהתפלה מתרוממת לדרגת קרבן, חייב הכהן לעקור רגליו ממקומו. המנהג\n  הנפוץ בישראל כי בשעה שהש\"ץ מגיע לרצה הציבור אומר, \"ותערב עליך עתירתנו\n  כעולה וכקרבן\" - בהרבה מקומות נוהגים לחתום במטבע העתיקה, \"שאותך לבדך\n  ביראה נעבוד\" (חתימת הברכה במקדש) - מראה בעליל, כי בברכת רצה משהו פלאי\n  מתרחש. שיח נהפך לקרבן, ואז עולים הכהנים לדוכן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Arukh haShulchan writes that the custom around him was not to say this blessing), and generalizing positions to whole communities based on the whims of Siddur-publishers is likely counterproductive.

    "content": "# Ona'as Devarim Paradox\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is Ona'as Devarim considered a subset of damage?</p>\n<p>On the one hand: you can't be forced to pay for it. As discussed in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/77168/9682\">this answer</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R' Meir of Rottenburg holds that O'naas Devarim (the sin of hurting someone's feelings with words...) is actually punishable by lashes. He explains this is because money doesn't help. So, another punishment that is fitting is used instead.</p>\n<p>The Mordechai also holds that the punishment is lashes. Those that argue with them about lashes, admit that money is no substitute either. (The Bes Yosef questions their opinion about lashes in Choshen Mishpat 1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, as I <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77138/range-of-five-payments#comment228536_77168\">commented</a> on that answer,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'll add to that ... the Gemara in BM 58b, discussing why Ona'as Devarim is worse than normal Ona'ah, that R' Shmuel bar Nachmani's understanding is that Ona'as Devarim can't be repaid, while Ona'ah can.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If something is considered damage, you can be forced to pay for it. If it's not considered damage, you cannot be forced to pay for it. This point is brought out more clearly in the Hezik Re'iyah sugya (BB 2a-3a) and the Hezik She'eino Nikar sugya (Gittin 53a). From the fact that Ona'as Devarim cannot be punished monetarily, it must be that it's not considered damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On the other hand: Ona'as Devarim is a subset of Ona'as Mamon. It's derived from the fact that Ona'ah is written twice (Vayikra 25:14,17, as derived in BM 58b). Ona'ah, in turn, could have been derived from Gezeilah, were it not for specific details of Ona'ah that don't exist by theft (BM 61a). Otherwise, though, Ona'ah might as well have been the same as Gezeilah. Thievery, in turn, is a type of damage (BK 4b). As we just said Ona'as Mamon is a subset of Gezeilah, it, too, is a type of damage. And as Ona'as Devarim is a subset of Ona'as Mamon, it, too, must be a type of damage.</p>\n<p>Again, if something is considered damage, you can be forced to pay for it. And yet, Ona'as Devarim cannot be forced to be paid for. Does this not leave us with a paradox? What is wrong with these lines of reasoning, as both cannot possibly be correct?</p>\n\n\n",

This is because God knew that the Jews would repent through love (<em>teshuvah me-ahavah</em>), and therefore, their sins would become merits. Thus, although it was a sin for them at the time that they partook of the feast, in retrospect it was a merit and in fact the source of their salvation. </p>\n\n<p>Also not an exact match, but according to the Maharam Chalavah and a number of other sources, we recite a bracha on the miracle of leaving Egypt, even though the bracha recited on a miracle extends only two generations, because on the night of the Seder it is considered as if we ourselves left Egypt. This might also be the reason for Hallel at the Seder, which seems not to be the ordinary Hallel of Yom Tov, but Hallel on a miracle, which we can recite because \"we ourselves left Egypt.\" Thus, the halachah that we are to see ourselves as having left Egypt has practical ramifications in other realms and may be considered a communal obligation to engage in (metaphorical) time travel. </p>\n\n\n",

Besides the image of a snake could be used as a metaphor because it reminds us of something comparable, this is why a king can be called a lion (Jer 8:17); When it says that 'the snake' was more 'arum' as the other animals it means that humankind had the most powerfull and creative mind of all living beings on earth, but this was cunning/crafty/subtle when it presents us with images, thoughts and feelings. The Or HaChayim explains that Adam and Chava could interpreter the language as  'spoken by the animals', while Arbarbanel explains this doesn't meant the snake spoke literally but through it's deeds and behaviour (see similar examples in Job 12:7-8, 28:14, 28:22 and Psalm 148:7), which Adam and Chava overthought in their mind. Chazal pictures the snake as a symbol of our imaginative power (to be ingenuity, creative), while the Zohar not only pictures the snake as a physical snake but also as a inner voice, so it could be that based on all this information that Chavah saw a real physical snake and held a intern dialogue (see also the commentary of Rabbi Twersky). </p>\n\n<p>This is only one example of the way one could give meaning to certain descriptions given in this fascinating story.

A site offering an online-only Conservative conversion is at best extremely misguided, and possibly a scam.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, Conservative Judaism would not accept a \"conversion\" that did not include <em>mikvah</em> and (for men) circumcision.

I have heard of people in isolated locations who have no local rabbi doing some of their study remotely (for example via Skype), but I've never heard of one who was able to <em>complete</em> a conversion that way (including the <em>beit din</em>).  This is anecdotal evidence only, I know.  The Conservative rabbis I know expect a convert to become part of a local Jewish community, which means in person.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Conversion is a major life changing decision that cannot be thrown out like the whims of an online dating account and something like this should be avoided as not being genuine. Any responsible rabbi will require a period of study and a knowledge test before proceeding. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally if someone tells you that you can convert to Judaism and it does not require all of the following 1. acceptance of the entire Torah both in practice and belief. 2. If male either circumcision or hatafas hadam bris. 3. mikvah 4. an understanding that when the beis hamikdash is rebuilt you will have to bring a sacrifice then the conversion being offered is a scam  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are the 10 utterances in Pirkei Avot 5:1\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53084&st=&pgnum=122\">Pirkei Avot (Chapters of the Fathers) 5:1</a> says that the world was created with 10 \"utterances\" (מאמרות). Both Rash\"I and Rav Ovadiah Mibartenura explain the term מאמרות to mean that it refers to the number of times that the term ויאמר is used in the story of creation. They both say that there are a total of 9 such occurrences, and the 10th utterance is the term בראשית. Rav Ovadiah explains why that word is considered an \"utterance\" by G-d.</p>\n\n<p>I checked the actual text in Breishit chapter 1, which includes the story of the six days of creation. There actually are a full 10 appearances of the word ויאמר as follows (all in Bresihit (Gen. chapter 1):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>verse 3</li>\n<li>verse 6</li>\n<li>verse 9</li>\n<li>verse 11</li>\n<li>verse 14</li>\n<li>verse 20</li>\n<li>verse 24</li>\n<li>verse 26</li>\n<li>verse 28</li>\n<li>verse 29</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, my 2 questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If there are actually 10 instances of ויאמר why do both of the commentators state that there are only 9 and rely on the 1st verse of Breishit as the 10th occurrence?</p></li>\n<li><p>I can <strong>somewhat</strong> understand a response to my previous question if we consider that occurrence #10 in the list does not seem to be related to the creation process itself, but it is G-d talking to the man. However, occurrence #9 is also G-d talking directly to the man, so even according to the commentaries' enumeration, they seem to refer to one expression of ויאמר that does not seem to be related to G-d's creating anything. How do we resolve this apparent conflict?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Chazal give a listing of the ten utterances is given in <a href=\"http://daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=2&mefaresh=raba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabba 17:1</a>, together with what to swap out.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר ה' אלהים לא טוב היות \n  תנינן: ‏\n  בעשרה מאמרות נברא העולם, ואלו הן: ‏\n  בראשית; \n  ורוח אלהים מרחפת; \n  ויאמר אלהים יהי אור; \n  ויאמר אלהים יהי רקיע; \n  ויאמר אלהים יקוו המים; \n  ויאמר אלהים תדשא הארץ; \n  ויאמר אלהים יהי מאורות; \n  ויאמר אלהים ישרצו המים; \n  ויאמר אלהים תוצא הארץ; \n  ויאמר אלהים נעשה אדם. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>מנחם בר יוסי: \n  מוציא ורוח אלהים מרחפת, ומביא ויאמר ה' אלהים לא טוב היות האדם.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>אמר רבי יעקב בן קורשאי:\n  מאמר ניתן לרוח בפני עצמה: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or, in English:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hashem said it is not good (for man) to be (alone):\n  A tannaitic source:\n  The world was created in ten utterances. And these are:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>verse 1, Bereishit</li>\n  <li>verse 2, middle, 'and the spirit of God hovered' / 'a mighty wind hovered'</li>\n  <li>verse 3, (God said) Let there be light</li>\n  <li>verse 6, (God said) Let there be a firmament</li>\n  <li>verse 9, (God said) Let the waters be gathered </li>\n  <li>verse 11, (God said) Let the earth put forth grass</li>\n  <li>verse 14, (God said) Let there be lights (in the firmament of the heaven)</li>\n  <li>verse 20, (God said) Let the waters swarm</li>\n  <li>verse 24, (God said) Let the earth bring forth (the living creature)</li>\n  <li>verse 26, (God said) Let us make man.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Menachem bar Yossi removed item 2 (the spirit of Hashem hovered) and inserted Bereishit 2:12, (God said) It is not good that the man should be alone.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yaakov ben Korshai said: One utterance was given to the ruach for itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the commentary <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14385&st=&pgnum=41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Etz Yosef explains</a>, Rabbi Yaakov ben Korshai is arguing in favor of the Tanna Kamma, that includes item 2.</p>\n\n<p>So nobody (at least in this source) counts either verse 28 or 29.</p>\n\n<p>The question then is why ruach would be included as its own utterance. According to Etz Yosef, the reason Menachem bar Yossi removed item 2 was that this refers to the spirit of Adam HaRishon and Melech HaMashiach, and was thus already included in the creation of man.</p>\n\n<p>The following is just a guess, but the idea might be that the first pasuk is taken (not like Rashi) as the initial creation of the raw materials, for which we then have tohu vavohu, and the tehom, and the shamayim and eretz. If the Ruach Elokim refers to Hashem hovering (as opposed to it meaning \"mighty wind\"), and it is interacting somehow with the creation, then it would have to count, perforce, as an \"utterance\".</p>\n\n<p>I'll just add that the question was well thought out, and that indeed your list of ten, including verses 28 and 29, may well be the originally intended ten utterances.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Consider the ויאמר that is in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#v=26&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">verse 26</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כווַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים נַעֲשֶׂה אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ כִּדְמוּתֵנוּ\n  וְיִרְדּוּ בִדְגַת הַיָּם וּבְעוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם וּבַבְּהֵמָה וּבְכָל\n  הָאָרֶץ וּבְכָל הָרֶמֶשׂ הָרֹמֵשׂ עַל הָאָרֶץ</p>\n  \n  <p>26 And God said, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,\n  and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the\n  heaven and over the animals and over all the earth and over all the\n  creeping things that creep upon the earth.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was not an utterance that actually caused the creation of man, nor was it a command or a blessing. This is a \"<em>consultation</em>\" with the mal'achim and it is only afterwords that the actual creation continues. Thus, this instance of ויאמר should not be counted and the total of \"utterances\" that were part of creation is indeed 9. As Rashi says</p>\n\n<p><em>Let us make man</em>: Even though they [the angels] did not assist Him in His creation, and there is an opportunity for the heretics to rebel (to misconstrue the plural as a basis for their heresies), Scripture did not hesitate to teach proper conduct and the trait of humility, that a great person should consult with and receive permission from a smaller one. Had it been written: “I shall make man,” we would not have learned that He was speaking with His tribunal, but to Himself. And the refutation to the heretics is written alongside it [i. e., in the following verse:]<strong>“And God created (וַיִּבְרָא)</strong> ,” and it does not say,“and they created וַיִּבְרְאוּ.” - [from Gen. Rabbah 8:9]</p>\n\n<p>Also note the explanation the @joshwaxman cites which pushes off both (28, and 29) as not involving actual creation for pasuk 2:18 which is the creation of Chava (instead of 1:2 which is also not ויאמר)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The reason the sages say there are only 9 utterances is because there are only 9 occurrences in Chapter 1 of ‘Vayohmer Elohim’. All other occurrences are different. Such as in verse 22 it reads, “Elohim LeAmor” which is actually, “God (to them) saying”. And also in verse 28 it reads, “Elohim Vayohmer,” which is not the same as, “Vayohmer Elohim” but still translated mostly as, “And God said,”.\nSo that is the reason there are only 9 audible utterances of creation because there are only 9 occurrences of “Vayohmer Elohim.”</p>\n<p>There is one more in Chapter 2 when woman is taken out of man but this too is different. It is “Vayohmer Adonai Elohim”, and seeing how this is a new section of Torah and not part of the first section, it is mostly considered not part of the Creation. The reason is that when Elohim made man He made Adam as both male and female as in the likeness of Himself. Then later Elohim Adonai takes woman out of man, so it is a division of male and female but not the original creation of Adam.</p>\n<p>So this is why the 10th utterance of Creation is unspoken. It is the First and the Last utterance as God was at Rest before Creation and on the 7th day He Rested. Elohim could have created everything with 1 utterance but in order that Righteousness would multiply He spoke 9 utterances. Since God is One He desired Creation to be divided from Himself. If He only spoke once then all would still be Him, but because He spoke 9 times we are individuals.\nFor the sages say that “Beresheit” is the first utterance. Some say that this is Wisdom because the beginning is Wisdom or put another way, “Wisdom is the principal thing.” Regardless, Elohim created the Heavens and the Earth and some would say this was a synopsis of the rest of Chapter 1, but what if it was just the first act of creation which was willed into being by Elohim. And when He saw that Heaven and Earth were still part of Him, He spoke the 9 utterances to divide and bring forth the whole of Creation. And so the 10th utterance is the same as the first because Elohim Rested and did not speak. Elohim is the Eternal Utterance which is unspoken. He is the same from Beginning to End and does not change. He is the 10th Utterance and His goal is Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason is that it is not considered as a jewelery, so while weared normally, this is <strong>not adapted to woman.</strong>  Similarly, a man wearing a ring without seal in same conditions is punishable by Korban Chat'at.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch OC 307, 10 which stated exactly as this.</p>\n<p>If tie pin is at first glance a masculine jewelery, with diamond or without diamond does not change the problem.

All of these vendors, too, except for\n  one, are Jewish. Like other Italian Jews, some of the vendors are\n  observant, though many are not. Most passersby and many Italians would\n  never know that Di Veroli is Jewish. </p>\n  \n  <p>At the end of World War II, several Jewish families managed to get\n  their licenses back. No new permits have been given out since the war\n  because there is no more public space available to be licensed. So\n  today, the vendors remain Roman Jews and the profession continues to\n  be passed on within the family, with young men usually learning the\n  business from their fathers, as they have done for centuries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This was not possible with Adam HaRishon because he had heard G-d's commandments directly.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Chava however, she had not heard the commandments directly from G-d, but only as Adam had taught them to her.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, Adam and Chava had been one being in a single body, like the single, simple light of the first day of creation. That is what is referred to as <em>Adam HaRishon</em>, the aspect of Adam which pertains to the first day. But then, like with the creation of the two great sources of light from that original single light on the fourth day of creation, they were split into two beings. Chava's body was <em>built</em> from the <em>tzela</em>. Like with the two lights, one of those two was <em>reduced</em> and made to receive and reflect what it received from larger.</p>\n\n<p>Adam's soul remained in the original body, the remnant of what existed originally. Chava's soul occupied a new body, built from a single element. This is the beginning of the concept of reincarnation (<em>Gilgul HaNeshamot</em>). When a soul is reincarnated into a new body, it generally does not retain knowledge and awareness of the prior incarnation. This is because what the soul perceives is filtered through the <em>lens</em> of the physical body it is dressed within. When that <em>lens</em> changes, perception and awareness is altered. It was for this reason that Chava became dependent upon Adam for her knowledge of what G-d commanded them to do and not do.</p>\n\n<p>It records in Midrash that Adam taught Chava about what they could eat and not eat from the garden. Adam feared that Chava might make a mistake in regard to the tree of knowledge and because the consequence of transgressing this prohibition was so serious, added an additional restriction <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/avot/1-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(סיג לתורה)</a> which G-d had not commanded. That additional restriction which Adam added was not to touch the tree of knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Later, when the Nachash questioned Chava about what G-d expected of them, she repeated what Adam had taught her. And it was over that additional restriction that the Nachash introduced the doubt into Chava's mind about what exactly G-d wanted from them. The Nachash pushed Chava against the tree of knowledge and she discovered that she did not die from contact as she had been taught.</p>\n\n\n",

The only instance that the more all encompassing term of \"עַל-פְּנֵי כָל-הָאָרֶץ\" is used is when the the dove is sent out, otherwise its not used. </p>\n\n<p>It seems, from the pesukim, that its not clear as to whether the whole earth was indeed covered. Since the plain meaning of the pesukim does not make it abundantly clear that the whole earth was covered do any commentaries address this issue by saying that only specific localities were affected by the flood?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Meiselman's book \"Torah, Chazal and Science\" addresses the concept of a local flood (p.556 heading 'A local deluge'):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the early 20th century the observant community of Germany was an\n  integral part of the surrounding intellectual world. Consequently, the\n  challenges posed by modern thought and research were grequent subjects\n  of discussion. One issue that was hotly debated was the lack of\n  geological evidence for the Mabul. A theory was advanced at that time\n  that the Mabul was actually a local flood, which is why it left no\n  mark in features far from the Middle East [50]. This theory came to be\n  widely accepted among observant German Jews wishing to preserve their\n  connections to the academic world.</p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, the concept of a 'local flood' is open to many\n  interpretation. It can mean anything from the coastal effects of a\n  Black Sea squall to a major deluge encompassing large portions of the\n  globe. The size of the Teivah, however, was far beyond what would have\n  been necessary for even a major squall on the Black Sea...</p>\n  \n  <p>[50] To the best of my knowledge, Rav Dov Tzvi Hoffman (1843-1921) was the first rabbinic authority to adopt this view.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In chapter 66, section 4 Rabbi Meiselman brings the opinion of Rabbi J B Soloveitchik (whom he calls <em>Mori veRebbi</em>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some of his students once asked Mori veRebbi, ztz\"l, his view of the\n  theory that the Mabul was a local flood. He answered that he did not\n  believe that it was, but in any case one must believe minimally that\n  it covered the entire part of the world inhabited by humans and most\n  probably animal life as well. Both the pesukim and Chazal record that\n  all life was destroyed and that Noach was the progenitor of all\n  subsequent human life; consequently this much cannot be deined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Meiselman's approach and understanding of other Rabbi's is contested <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2011/12/response-and-further-response-to-rabbi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yonasan Eibshitz (1690-1764) writes in Tiferes Yehonasan <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21286&st=&pgnum=21&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">top of second column</a> that the Mabul did not reach the okianus ocean that surrounds the world.

Can it be that the Bible is exaggerating the entire event in order to make a point? Is it possible that the entire world was not flooded, but just a single, local flood, as scientists now suggest? </p>\n\n<p>Yes! Rabbi Marc Shapiro has an <a href=\"http://www.ottmall.com/mj_ht_arch/v16/mj_v16i13.html#CCL\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> saying that the whole world was not covered during the flood.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the meaning of the metaphor?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The myth of Noah’s flood has a moral twist, a lesson that the pagan myths lacked. It also teaches us how to understand the Bible. For instance, the flood tells us that acts have consequences. It uses hyperbole, exaggeration to highlight the happening in saying that the whole world was evil so G-d returns it to it previous condition, that of water. </p>\n\n<p>But under the law of nature created by G-d, these consequences affect both the guilty and innocent (animals). This is what is meant when we read Exodus 20:5, “visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.” By analyzing the flood story we learn two things. That the Bible has morality unlike the Greek pagan myths and that natural law and reason demands that acts have consequences, even for generations. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong> </p>\n\n<p>In short, the story of Noah’s flood helps us understand the Bible. </p>\n\n\n",

Though the sixth chapter is technically not part of <em>Maseches</em> Avos, it is generally treated as thought it was: Mishna Yomis programs always include it and it's included in all standard version of the Mishna and Talmud Bavli.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of Pirkei Avos, the one that appears in the standard Shas (in the last volume of Seder Nezikin) and the one that appears in the standard siddur (usually near Shabbos Mincha). For the most part the differences are just the way the Mishnayos are broken up (which often leads to confusion when citations in Pirkei Avos appear to be erroneous because they are from the other version than the one being used) but there are also a few differences in the text itself. Also, the siddur version contains a brief introduction (Kol Yisrael yesh lahem chelek) and a brief conclusion (Rabbi Chananya ben Akashya omer)</p>\n<p>Avos d'Rabbi Nasan, which is usually printed along with the Masechtos Ketanos (though my understanding is that historically it was written long before the others) is a midrash that is closely related to Avos and seems to be the closest we have to a \"Gemara\" on Avos (which otherwise is the only Masechta that does not have a Bavli, Yerushalmi, or Tosefta). However, scholars are unsure if Avos d'Rabbi Nasan is a commentary on Avos or if Avos is actually a summary of Avos d'Rabbi Nasan (or perhaps they both indpendently stem from an original lost work or tradition).</p>\n<p>There are two versions of Avos d'Rabbi Nasan: the one that appears in the standard Shas and one that was published from manuscripts by Solomon Schechter  (I know the Artscroll Rashi sometimes quotes the second version as a source for midrashim/interpretations that don't appear in the standard version of Avos d'Rabbi Nassan).</p>\n<p>There is also a general discussion regarding how Avos was formed over the course of time. Rav Dovid Tzvi Hoffman wrote on this topic (and I saw recently that Dr. Boylan of Touro has as well), but I am not very familiar with the topic. In the same vein, some meforshim point out that it seems the last 3 mishnayos of the fifth Perek are a later addition (in the time of Chazal) that were appended to Pirkei Avos.</p>\n<p>[Pirkei d'Rabbi Elazar is unrelated]</p>\n\n\n",

Every case the vowels are either like elohim or like adonai. But rarely exactly like. </p>\n\n<p>A) When it(YHVH) has vowels like Adonai, the difference is that there is usually a simple shva under the Yud rather than a composite shva. (at least looking at the WLC)</p>\n\n<p>B) When it(YHVH) has vowels like Elohim, the difference is that in most cases there is a simple shva under the yud of YHVH.</p>\n\n<p>C) Usually there is no cholam on the vav of YHVH(funnily enough mechon mamre's text never puts the cholam on there, and bible.ort.org's text has the cholam on all of them. The WLC has a mixture, where thousands of cases don't have the vav and around 50-90 do)</p>\n\n<p>And interestingly, in WLC, for Judges 16:28 you get a composite shva under the yud, and a vav over the first heh, so the vowels (hataph segol, cholam, chirik), are exactly the vowels of elohim, in that instance. (I don't think there is any case in the WLC, of YHVH matching the vowels of adonai or elohim exactly, other than that one where it matches elohim exactly).</p>\n\n<p>The reason for the composite shva(on the aleph of elohim and of adonai), changed to a simple shva(on the yud of YHVH), is likely because(or at least something to do with the fact that), yud is allowed a simple vocal shva. (unlike aleph, which is in adonai and elohim, an aleph's vocal shva has to be composite).</p>\n\n<p>i.e. grammatically a gutteral e.g. Aleph, isn't meant to take a simple vocal shva but can take a composite shva, so adonai and elohim take a composite shva. So it's normal for a letter that would normally take a simple vocal shva, to take a composite shva if the letter is gutteral. (Note that there are cases of non-gutteral letters in tanach taking composite shva too)  Yud doesn't have that restriction that aleph has of not being able to take a simple vocal shva.</p>\n\n<p>The answerer, Pekuda, does explain when YHVH has the vowels like Adonai and when it has the vowels like Elohim. (I say <em>like</em> adonai and <em>like</em> elohim, rather than 'of' adonai and elohim, because see points A,B,C).</p>\n\n<p>His answer does leave open the question of why is it that sometimes the cholam is in there, (i.e. the cholam of elohim and adonai), leaving all the vowels in there, and sometimes not.  And indeed sometimes with the vowels like in the WLC,  elohim(1 Kings 2:26, Psalms 140:8, Isaiah 50:4), and sometimes with the vowels like adonai(Gen 3:14, Gen 9:26).</p>\n\n<p>Note- if you have a text editor with regex search and the tanach loaded in, you can use the regex <code>[\\u05D9][\\u0500-\\u05AF\\u05BC-05CF]*[\\u05B0-\\u05BB][\\u0500-\\u05AF\\u05BC-05CF]*[\\u05D4][\\u0500-\\u05AF\\u05BC-05CF]*[\\u05B0-\\u05BB][\\u0500-\\u05AF\\u05BC-05CF]*[\\u05D5][\\u0500-\\u05AF\\u05BC-05CF]*[\\u05B0-\\u05BB][\\u0500-\\u05AF\\u05BC-05CF]*[\\u05D4]</code> to search for e.g. YHWH with cholam.</p>\n\n<p>Note- It may be a bit flawed to look to the WLC for something as fine as this, (As the leningrad is thought to be a bit sloppy and doesn't even correspond with its own mesora notes in its markings), perhaps the Aleppo Codex sheds more light, though it isn't in digital text form and may just be in pdf or jpg which makes it harder to check).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Process of Gaining Hebrew Fluency\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm curious to hear from those who grew up in a community where Hebrew literacy was valued what progression of study enabled you to read Torah in Hebrew (with understanding)?  I have found through my own experiences and talking with others that even after studying grammar for some time and gaining a basic vocabulary reading is a very laborious task, which regardless is to be expected.  Are there any methodologies out there that help to apply that effort efficiently for the purposes of learning necessary vocabulary and gaining skill at quickly parsing grammatical forms?  Perhaps it is simply of issue of time applied but I'd like to hear if anyone has advice on this topic.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have no \"magic\" solution, and I don't think you will find a quick one, yourself.</p>\n\n<p>I learned in a yeshiva elementary school decades ago. Hebrew was taught for about 4 hours 5 days / week. We had to speak Hebrew to our classmates and the teacher for about 4 hours. I started with reading and writing the letters, words, sentences, etc. - much in the same way that anyone would learn any new language. But, one huge advantage was that when we learned Torah, the Biblical Hebrew was translated into \"simpler\" Hebrew. We red the commentary (mainly Rash\"i) in Hebrew. There was no Art Scroll around at that time. There were English translated linear Bibles, and I used these occasionally at home when I had trouble. But, they were forbidden in the classroom, because it was important to keep a Hebrew only (mostly) environment.</p>\n\n<p>This method, sadly, is not being followed as much these days. I also must admit, that young kids learn things much more quickly than adults do. That's not bias, it is a scientific fact. So, I'm sorry that age may be going against a lot of the \"magic\" you may be seeking.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, that becoming fluent and an expert requires serious diligence. Biblical Hebrew is much different from modern Hebrew, but I don't think it takes much to master it once you have a decent command of the Hebrew language. While I can't think of any offhand, I'm sure that are books and various online resources that can explain the mechanics of Biblical grammar. There aren't that many rules.</p>\n\n<p>Having said this, what you will get is a literal translation. If you want to understand the Torah, you will need to view some commentaries. For example, when you read \"An eye for an eye\", you would probably think that if someone knocks out your eye, you should knock out that person's eye. That's not what it means. You wouldn't know that unless you read a commentary that explains that this means you pay monetary compensation. Again, if you have a somewhat decent command of Hebrew, you can understand most of Rash\"i and other commentators. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using an English translation for any of these - I do this, myself when I need to, and my Hebrew is quite good!</p>\n\n<p>Talmud is a whole other story. Most of it is written in Aramaic. There are vocabulary books , sheets and online resources that explain some of the most frequent terms used in the Talmud. That can help, on some level. But, I would recommend a basic book such as Steinzalt's introduction to the Talmud, or something similar. Technically, you can delve into a Talmudic page and go through the \"mechanics\" of understanding the Aramaic. But, I feel that as a beginner, you would greatly appreciate the Talmud if you have a foundation of understanding how the Talmud, overall, operates. There is a methodology to it.</p>\n\n<p>Of particular importance is to understand the purpose of a Talmud tractate. When you open the first page of any tractate, there is an assumption that you understand what the topic is about and why such a tractate exists. For example, the first page of tractate Brachot asks when is the time to recite the nighttime \"Shema\"? Very nice! What if you never heard of the term \"Shema\"? WHat if you have no idea that there is any requirement for Jews to say this thing called \"Shema\"? I think you'd be immediately lost, bored, or confused. It would be a lot better if you had a general idea of what is discussed in this tractate, and review the Torah areas that comprise the key discussions in the tractate before delving into it.</p>\n\n<p>Those are a few ideas. In short, it will require much patience and diligence. No magic short cuts. If you're willing to put in the effort, you will receive many rewards.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ribbis offsetting a default\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Suppose a Jew charges and receives interest from a Jew, only finding out that the other party is Jewish after. He should refuse the interest. BUT he knows that the debtor has defaulted on a debt to someone else. May he give the interest collected to the other creditor who lost his principal?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>this is an attempt to respond.  Reuven loaned and charged   interest from Shim'on. After some time Reuven found that Shim'on is Jew. He needs to return  the interests. But Shim'on owes Levi money. Reuven want to give the interests to Levi. </p>\n\n<p>I think that the reasoning has two steps.\n- Is the ribbit a property of Reuven? If not, he can give it only to Shim'on. If yes he can give it to the third person as he can give  his own money.</p>\n\n<p>Gemara says (BM 61b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R'Eleazar said: Direct interest can be reclaimed in court, but not indirect interest. R'Johanan ruled: Even direct interest cannot be reclaimed in court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Halacha is follows Rabbi El'azar but there is two ways to understand this. The mitsva to return  is according to Rambam  a part of the mitsva to restore a stolen item. Ritba  see it  as an isolated Mitsva of Vechay Achicha Imach, an injonction to help your brother to remain alive. So,  the fact that Reuven need to return  the interests can be viewed as a paiement of a debt or as a Mitsva to help Shim'on. The question is if the transaction of Ribbit (called ktitsa) is a part of the debt  as a standart loan create a debt of Keren. Rishonim discussed this, Rambam viewed restoration of ribbit as restoration of stolen money, and Ritba viewed this as a mitsva to give this money, a gift. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Your question seems to be relevant according to  the Ritba</strong> opinion (and poskim seem agreeng with it), according to which Reuven can give valid Kiddushin to a woman with <strong>the Ribbit, it is owns</strong>. But despite that, I am not sure that he can give the money to Levi, as seen below.</p>\n\n<p>See Pitche Teshuva SA YD 161 sk 6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עי׳ בתשובת תפארת צבי\n   סימן מ\"ח אות א' להגאון החסיד מהר\"ר עקיבא איגר זצ\"ל נסתפק באם אחד נתן למלוה רבית קצוצה ועדין לא פרע לו הקרן ומת המלוה אם יכול לנכות להיורשים מהקרן שחייב לשלם להם מה שנתן ריבית קצוצה אי דומה לסלוקי בלא זוזי לדעת הסוברים באבק ריבית דהוי אפוקי (לקמן סימן קע\"ב סעיף א' בהג\"ה ועיין בש\"ך לקמן סימן קע\"ז ס\"ק ב') ה\"נ י\"ל דהוי אפוקי ומיורשים אין מוציאים או דלא דמי לאבק ריבית דשם הוי ממונו לכשנתן לו זכה בהן אבל הכא היה צריך להחזיר והוי כפרעון על חוב והוא ז\"ל כתב דלכאורה נראה דאף ריבית קצוצה נמי הוא קונה רק שמחויב להחזיר מצד המצוה ובריה אינו מוזהר והאריך בזה ולבסוף מסיק דמטעם אחר יכול לנכות דכיון שאילו אביהם קיים לא היה יכול לגבות אין בידו להוריש זה הממון ליורשים עיין שםועיין עוד בתשובת מהרע\"א הנ״ל סימן פ' מענין זה. ועיין בספר דגול מרבבה שנסתפק אם מת הלוה אם המלוה חייב להחזיר ליורשי הלוה  כיון שעיקר חזרת רבית הוא משום וחי אחיך אהדר לי׳ כי היכי ליחיה וכיון שמת הלוה לא יבא לחיותו והביא דברי הכל בו שכתב יש לו להשיב הרבית לו וליורשיו וכתב ואפשר דהיינו ברוצה לשוב אבל הב\"ד נראה שאין כרפין להשיב\n  ליורשי הלוה עיין שם: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>He presents two cases linked to your question. First, if Shim'on payed the Ribbit and not the loan itself, and  Reuven died. If the son of Reuven can retain the ribbit as a part of the due payment? Second question, if Shim'on is dead, Reuven need to restore the ribbit to Shim'on son. These two questions are a matter of our first consideration. We see that Rabbi Akiva Eiger stated that the Ribbit is a property of Reuven, only the mitsva of Vehay Ahicha... generates the \"restoration\". Rabbi Yechezkel Landau also seems to share this view. But anyway the difference is only from the point of view of the offspring of Reuven, not for Reuven himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Conclusion, <strong>Reuven cannot to give the Ribbit to the third person</strong>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is perhaps an other part of the problem if Reuven was allowed to achiev justice himself, but I don't know such a thing. I know a din of Adam Ose Din Leatsmo, a din of Tofes lebaal chov bimkom Shechav Laacherim but I cannot see a right link with the question.   But if Reuven want to take the interests for an other debt that Shim'on owes him,  anyway the question will be if this debt can cancel the mitsvat asse of Vechay. I think that the response is:No. </p>\n\n\n",

As a result, Hashem has to allow man to decide for himself what course he will take. However, the conditions before the flood were such as to not allow the rebellion of the youth to overcome the evil customs and behavior that were the status quo. Rav Hirsch in his commentary on Noach 8:21 points out that now, after the flood, the spirit of rebellion of the youth would now allow them to bring the world away from evil as well as towards evil. Rav Hirsch uses the analogy of Hashem specifically having picked the most stiff-necked and stubborn people to receive the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Hashem punished the generation of the dispersion (as explained by Rav Hirsch) by making the traits of rebellion and the development of local dialects so extreme as to change the languages that people spoke at once instead of over the course of generations. Thus, the society would have broken up anyway, but Hashem used that trait to prevent the complete destruction that would have resulted from the ant hill that the civilization was becoming.</p>\n\n<p>The people are not the same after the flood as before the flood. The lifespan of centuries is reduced to decades so that the new generation can take over before the evil becomes totally uniform. The evil as it was before the flood can no longer cover the entire world as a uniform set of evil tenets.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out in 8:22 that the new climate and geographical conditions forced by the flood also leads to the dispersion and independence of societies so that no single society can conquer the world and spread evil over the entire habitat of mankind.</p>\n\n\n",

For begining we will see two Gemarot which seems to teach that dead need tsitsit or that this is a shame for him to stress that they cannot make mitsvot.</p>\n\n<p>Gemara Berachot 18a.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והתניא לא יהלך אדם בבית הקברות ותפילין בראשו וספר תורה בזרועו וקורא ואם עושה כן עובר משום {משלי יז-ה} לועג לרש חרף עושהו </p>\n  \n  <p>But it has been taught: A man should not walk in a cemetery with tefillin on his head or a scroll of the Law in his arm, and recite the Shema', and if he does so, he comes under the heading of 'He that mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker'?</p>\n  \n  <p>רבי חייא ורבי יונתן הוו שקלי ואזלי בבית הקברות, הוה קשדיא תכלתא דרבי יונתן. אמר ליה רבי חייא: דלייה, כדי שלא יאמרו למחר באין אצלנו ועכשיו מחרפין אותנו.</p>\n  \n  <p>R' Hiyya and R' Jonathan were once walking about in a cemetery, and the blue fringe of R' Jonathan was trailing on the ground. Said R' Hiyya to him: Lift it up, so that they [the dead] should not say: Tomorrow they are coming to join us and now they are insulting us! He said to him: Do they know so much?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See  Gemara Menachot 41a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב טובי בר קיסנא אמר שמואל כלי קופסא חייבין בציצית ומודה שמואל בזקן שעשאה לכבודו שפטורה מ''ט {דברים כב-יב} אשר תכסה בה אמר רחמנא האי לאו לאיכסויי עבידא בההיא שעתא ודאי רמינן ליה משום {משלי יז-ה} לועג לרש חרף עושהו </p>\n  \n  <p>R' Tobi B' Kisna said in the name of Samuel, The garments put away in a chest are subject to zizith.\n  Samuel, however, admits that where an old man made it for his shroud it is exempt, for the Divine Law says, Wherewith thou coverest thyself, and this is not intended for an ordinary covering. Nevertheless, when the time comes for its use we should insert fringes in it, on account of the injunction, Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, see Gemara Nidda 61b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר: בגד שאבד בו כלאים - הרי זה לא ימכרנו לעובד כוכבים, ולא יעשנו מרדעת לחמור.\n  אבל עושה ממנו תכריכין למת.\n  אמר רב יוסף: זאת אומרת - מצות בטלות לעתיד לבא.\n  א\"ל אביי ואי תימא רב דימי: והא א\"ר מני א\"ר ינאי לא שנו - אלא לספדו, אבל לקוברו - אסור א\"ל: לאו איתמר עלה, א\"ר יוחנן אפילו לקוברו?\n  ור' יוחנן לטעמיה, דא\"ר יוחנן: מאי דכתיב (תהלים פ\"ח) במתים חפשי, כיון שמת אדם - נעשה חפשי מן המצות. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: A garment in which kil'ayim was lost may not be sold to an idolater, nor may one make of it a packsaddle for an ass, but it may be made into a shroud for a corpse.\n  R' Joseph observed: This implies that the commandments will be abolished in the Hereafter.\n  Said Abaye (or as some say R' Dimi) to him: But did not R' Manni in the name of R' Jannai state, 'This was learnt only in regard to the time of the lamentations but for burial this is forbidden'? - The other replied: But was it not stated in connection with it, R'  Johanan ruled: Even for burial'?\n  And thereby R' Johanan followed his previously expressed view, for R' Johanan stated: 'What is the purport of the Scriptural text, Free among the dead?\n  <strong>As soon as a man dies he is free from the commandments'</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosfot Nidda 61b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... וא''ת והאיכא לועג לרש שמלבישו בדבר האסור ומראה לו שאין לו עוד חלק במצות כדאמר בהתכלת (מנחות דף מא.) גבי ציצית וההיא שעתא ודאי רמינן ליה משום לועג לרש </p>\n  \n  <p>Tosfot asked why is it allowed to take for the decease a garment with problem of Shaatnez when the Gemara in Menachot said to give it a garment with tsitsit despit he is exempt, because\"Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker\".</p>\n  \n  <p>ופרשב''ם דאין בו איסור ואפילו לחי כי האי גוונא שאין המת נהנה בו</p>\n  \n  <p>Rashbam answered that there is no profit for the dead (he don't need to stay warm) and in such condition there is no Isur Kilayim even for a live person.</p>\n  \n  <p>וקשה דהא ציצית נמי אין החי חייב בו אם אין בו הנאת לבישה ומוכרי כסות דפטירי מכלאים פטורים נמי מציצית </p>\n  \n  <p>If this response is was correct, so why is it needed to give him tsitsit. A live person who wear a garment from which he receives no benefit must not bring tsitsit. </p>\n  \n  <p>ומפרש רבינו תם דדוקא שייך לועג לרש בציצית משום דשקולה כנגד כל המצות כדנפקא לן במנחות (דף מג:) מוזכרתם את כל מצות ה' </p>\n  \n  <p>Rabenu Tam answers that the only mitsva for which we say \"Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker\" is Tsitsit which remember all mitsvot as soon in Gemara Brachot. </p>\n  \n  <p>והא דאמר בפרק מי שמתו (ברכות דף יח.) אמר ליה (רבי לרבי חייא) דליה לכנפך דלא לימרו למחר באין אצלנו ועכשיו מלעיגים אותנו </p>\n  \n  <p>But why in Masechet brachot </p>\n  \n  <p>אע''ג דיש למתים ציצית מכל מקום מה שאנו מראים עצמנו בפניהם מקיימי מצות והם אינם מצווין קרי לועג לרש ואם תאמר </p>\n  \n  <p>Even though deads wear tsitsit, when we demonstrate that we are making mitsvot and they do not have to do mitsvot. </p>\n  \n  <p>ועכשיו שאנו רגילין להסיר ציצית מטליתות המתים היאך הוא זה והא אמרינן במנחות (דף מא.) שלכתחילה צריך ליתן ציצית בבגדי המתים משום לועג לרש ובמתי מדבר מצינו בהמוכר הספינה (ב''ב דף עד.) שהיה להם ציצית </p>\n  \n  <p>Tosfot is astonished by our custom to remove tsitsit from the Talith of deads, it seems to run completely contrary to the Gemara Menachot 41b above cited. This Gemara says that we need to give tsitsit to deads garments, because of \"Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker\". An additional Gemara which reflecting the fact that deads have tsitsit is in Baba Batra 74a, concerning the generation of those who deceased in desert.</p>\n  \n  <p>מיהו מהא לא קשה שבכל ט' באב היו נכנסים בקבריהם חיים ולמחר הכרוז יצא הבדלו חיים מתוך המתים כדאיתא באיכה רבתי </p>\n  \n  <p>The gemara in BB is not really relevant because they was they entered into they graves alive each day of Tish'a Beav.</p>\n  \n  <p>אבל על מנהגנו יש לתמוה מכח ההיא דהתכלת (מנחות דף מא.) ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>But our custom is strange considering the Gemara in Menachot. </p>\n  \n  <p>ואור''י דבימי חכמים שכולן היו לובשים ציצית אם לא היה להם גם במותם לעג גדול היה שדומה כמו שהיו אומרים הואיל ומת אין צריך עוד ציצית אבל עכשיו שאין הכל לובשים ציצית בחייהם אם ישימו ציצית לכולן הוא יותר לועג לרש שבחייו לא קיים ובמותו יקיים </p>\n  \n  <p>Rabenu Yitschack answered that the Mishna and Gemara period was different from our times. In M&G period, everybody was wearing tsitsit, so to leave a dead without tsitsit is as to say, since he is dead, he needs no more tsitsit. But nowadays, not everybody wear tsitsit when alive. If they give tsitsit to every dead, it is a greater mockery: when alive he was without tsitsit, when he is dead he wears!</p>\n  \n  <p>ואם ישים למי שהיה לו בחייו ולא למי שלא היה לו יתביישו החיים כדתניא בפ' בתרא (לקמן דף עא.) בראשונה היו מטבילין על גב נדות מתות והיו החיות מתביישות התקינו שיהיו מטבילין על הכל </p>\n  \n  <p>If they give tsitsit to those who wore tsitsit and not to the others would embarass live person who don't wear tsitsit. ... So our custom is not wrong</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>ועוד יש קצת סמך למנהגנו שמסירין הציצית ממסכת שמחות (פי''ב) שאבא שאול צוה את בניו קברוהו תחת מרגלותיו של אביו והתירו תכלת מאנפליונו מיהו טעמא של אבא שאול לא נתברר: ‏</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is an argument for our custom, from Masechet Smachot, Abba Shaul (Ben Botnit)  commanded his sons to burry him at the foots of his father and to remove the Techelet from his garment. But we have no explanation for Abba Shaul theaching.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosfot in Berachot 18a added that Rabenu Tam heard in name of Chochme Lautiere (Lorraine) that it is presomptious to show as if they (deads) made 613 (tsitsit = 605 + 8 threads --> 613) mitsvot in their life. Tosfot rejected this explanation. He concluded that we follow the custom described in Masechet Smachot (Abba Shaul). Ritsba was accustomed to hang the tsitsit to the corner, the tsitsit was not seen and not removed.</p>\n\n<p>In Tosfot Baba Batra 74a, Rabenu Chayim Kohen said that we follow the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan in Nidda 61b that mitsvot would be annulled in the future. He made a link between this Machloket about mitsvot in future and the custom to remove tsitsit or not.  RI explained that our custom is entirely congruent with the Gemara in Menachot because there are two steps in the custom.  Firstly we add tsitsiot to the garment as if we say \"he was making mitsvot in his life\" afterwards they was removed.  RI added that this corresoponds to the  minhag in Germany. </p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Where can we find that the mistsvoth are only for the livings ?</code> ---> Rabbi Yochanan in Gemara Nidda 61b.</p>\n  \n  <p><code>Why do we have to cut the tallith of a dead person</code>   ---> First possibility: We follow the example of Abba Shaul, not the Gemara in Menachot, second possibility: Nowadays not everybody wear tsitsit in his life, and we avoid to mocke deads who did not wear tsitsit in their life and we avoid to mocke live person who don't wear tsitsit. Maybe that it is the custom of Rabbi Yochanan who stated that in future (tchyat hametim) there is no need to mitsvat tsitsit.   Your link between mitsvot for living and tsitsit is very right according to rav Chayim Kohen (in Tosfot AZ it's written in name of Rav Yehuda). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope to add explanations from Rishonim later.</p>\n\n\n",

A comment of the book, Sefer Megilat Esther quoted Sefer Zohar Harakyia which explains the Rambam.  We will try to explain Rambam's view. What is called Oral law? What is called rabbinical? Are there Halachot (laws) entirely orally transmitted which are not rabbinical? Is there a hierarchy in rabbinical laws? In the __introduction to his <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/hakdama/tohen-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to Mishna__ </a>.  Rambam clarify all this as follows.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There are for some halachot <strong>written in Tora</strong>  and their  meaning  is unanimously understood only thanks to oral transmission (e. g.   concerning the 4 minim (the four vegetal species taken for Sucot) and Lex Talionis, Shechita (slaughtering)).  The orally transmitted information is not rabbinical, that is, not discovered by Chachamim (the wises). This is a first kind of oral law from Sinai considered Deorayita (from the Torah) and not Rabbinical. There's sometime a way to understand or deduct à postériori those Halachot from the written Tora.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some halachot are transmitted from Moshe from Sinai and have <strong>no scriptural allusion</strong> . They are called in Chazal \"Halacha Lemoshe Misinai\" (Law from Moses from Sinai) . Ramban (root 2) disagreed with the fact that Rambam called them \"from scribes words\" and Zohar Harakyia answered that Rambam too considered those Dinim (rules) as Deorayta concerning safek (rule in doubtful situations) as for Shyurim (regular quantities needed) (Cazait,  Cabetza... ) Deorayta which are purely Halacha Lemoshe Misinai. The term Divre Sofrim is ambiguous and makes the Rambam hard to understand.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some Halachot are found through reflection and reasoning, often in verses,  sometimes are very old,  even from Moses himself and are called from scribes words (Sefer Hamitsvot Shoresh 2). When we say reasoning, this includes the use of thirteen Midot (a kind of inference rules (13 rules) specific for verses learning) to interpret Torah .\nWhen we look at the 13 Midot,  we separate two kinds of Dinim learned from  13 midot.  The first kind  results from deduction without transmission.   The second kind is transmitted. Chazal (the blessed wises) said that the last are Torah equivalents.    Zohar Harakyia explains: The Dinim from the second group are Deorayta concerning rules as Sfeka Deorayta (doubtful situations regarding a rule from the Torah) but Rambam called them Derabanan to express that they cannot be counted in 613 M because they are stemming from roots which are the 613 M themselves . For each item of this second group,  Chazal said explicitly that this specific din is Deorayta (for instance tum'at nivlat clean bird (a rule regarding uncleaness) which Rambam called Derabanan in intro to  Deder Taharot, and followed for it the same rules as Deorayta,  Qiddushe Kesef (regarding marital status) also are called by Rambam Divre Sofrim but their Din is Din Torah for all aspects) .</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Are Halachos that were received at Sinai (or in the desert shortly after) but not recorded in Tanach--such as the method for kosher slaughter alluded to in Deuteronomy 12:21--considered rabbinical or biblical laws? </code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not recorded but alluded are this kind and are divided in two subgroups as mentioned above. Rambam calls them Divre Sofrim but those  transmitted from Sinai have the same rules as Torah exactly.</p>\n<p>There is no Machloqet (disagreement) between Chachamim in the two first kinds. But in the third (for his first part)  there are often Machloqtot.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><p>The fourth kind of Halachot are <strong>ordinances</strong> .  There are rabbinical even if Moses decreed them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The fifth are <strong>enactments</strong>  which are innovations called Taqanot, and are also rabbinical.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code> I ask because, if rabbinical, they would seem to be of a higher status than many other forms of rabbinical law (g'zeiras, takanas, derashah, etc.)</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gzeras are the fourth kind and are rules with specific Qulot (lightening) of Rabanan rules. Takanos are the  fifth kind.

A law given to Moshe from Sinai. Sinai here is broad, meaning the wilderness, not the mountain. There is no guarantee that this particular detail was received during Moshe's 120 days atop the mountain.</p>\n\n<p>Second, it is also used idiomatically, \"as sure as if it were given to Moshe from Sinai\". This idiom is used for laws that were known to be rabbinic enactments. It even later got used in Ashkenaz to refer to Nusach haTefillah -- traditional tunes used by chazanim.</p>\n\n<p>I will limit this answer to the first, literal, usage.</p>\n\n<p>What does it mean that the law is categorized deOraisa? The most notable pragmatic difference is that we err on the side of stringency when a doubt arises in a Torahitic law (safeiq deOraisa lechumera); while if the law were deemed rabbinic, we are permitted to be lenient in cases of doubt (safeiq derabbanan lequla).</p>\n\n<p>Among other potential pragmatic differences is that one person can only fulfill an obligation on behalf of another if the person doing the action is equally obligated. A person who is only obligated deRabbanan could not fulfill an obligation for someone who is obligated deOraisa. But the issue of safeiq (doubt) makes an easier to find litmus test.</p>\n\n<p>One last clarification before getting to actually answering. There is a middle ground between deOraisa and deRabbanan. Megillah reading for men was legislated by the Anshei Keneses haGedolah (the Great Assembly; the high court of the early 2nd Temple period), and therefore is not deOraisa. However, among the members of the legislating court were many prophets, so that the law had Hashem's imprompeteur. It is not just another rabbinic law. In contrast, it is rabbinic law that women hear megillah. For this reason, the aforementioned rule applies: because a woman is less obligated to hear megillah than a man, a man cannot fulfill his obligation by hearing a woman read. Some sources understand the term \"divrei soferim\" as referring to this middle ground -- prophet endorsed rabbinic law. After all, sages of this period are often called by the term \"soferim\", such as \"Ezra haSofer\".</p>\n\n<p>So, after all that, I would reduce your question to: When a law is deemed halakhah leMoshe miSinai in the sense that Moshe actually was given the law by G-d, would doubts in that law be ruled stringently? If so, it would make sense to apply the term deOraisa. But if not, we would need to see if other bellwethers apply. If the results are mixed, perhaps halakhos leMoshe miSinai also sit in the middle ground.</p>\n\n<p>Measures (shiurim) are halakhos leMoshe miSinai (Yerushalmi Pei'ah 1:1, Bavli Sukkah 5b, Yuma 80a). But when measuring something for the sake of a mitzvah deOraisa, we rule stringently. (Rav Avohu on Niddah 58b, and invoked by Tosafos, Berakhos 26b). We do not consider having the necessary size / weight / duration a rabbinic amendment to the original deOraisa law.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem that from a pragmatic point of view, the answer to your question would be that they are deOraisa.</p>\n\n\n",

The only exception that I can think of is when a patach is underneath a <em>chet</em> at the end of a word such as in the word נֹח.

This is not a full Patach, but a half-vowel (not unlike how a Shva Na' isn't counted as a syllable) known as a \"furtive Patach\" or \"פתח גנובה\". In classical texts, the Patach is actually written a bit before the letter to indicate this.

The most complete and well known one is the Habbakuk Pesher, but fragments were found of Peshers on Nachum, Isaiah, Zephaniah, Micah, and some Psalms.  These all are full of references to their Teacher of Righteousness and their sect, sometimes referred to as \"the Poor\" or \"the Simple\" or \"Council of the Community\" and their struggles against their enemies -the \"Scoffers in Jerusalem\", the \"Wicked Priest\", the \"Spouter of Lies\", the \"Furious Young Lion\", \"those who seek smooth things\", and assorted others.

There are a few exceptions, as when the Nachum Pesher mentions two Seleucid kings, Demetrius and Antiochus, and describes a known event when Demetrius III tried to enter Jerusalem after defeating Alexander Janneus, but didn't succeed.

So the first point is that God gave them the authority to interpret <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In the \"oven of Achnai\" incident in Bava Metzia, R' Eliezer offers various proofs of his position that are not \"kosher\".  <em>Halacha</em> provides rules by which the rabbis can interpret and expound torah and <em>halacha</em>, and they do not include carob trees walking across the field or streams running backwards.  R' Eliezer was trying to follow different rules and the majority voted him down because of it.</p>\n\n<p>As you note, the rabbis went on to excommunicate him.  (They also rounded up and destroyed vessels that R' Eliezer had declared kosher, as his interpretations were now suspect.)  If you read on in the g'mara, though, you'll see that God does not seem to approve of their actions either.  On R' Eliezer's account the world was smitten (crops died).  And when R' Eliezer prayed to God for relief, his prayer was granted.  None of this means the majority was wrong to rule against R' Eliezer; their error was in how they treated him after.  (I attended a fascinating lecture on this on Shavu'ot night and wrote up some <a href=\"http://cellio.livejournal.com/1046459.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">notes</a> after.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, finally, we come to the question you led with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How does orthodox Jews see rabbinic disagreements and on what basis do believers determine which school of thought to follow? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Individual Jews <em>don't</em> decide.  We have a system of authority.  If I don't know what to do in a particular situation I ask my rabbi; if he doesn't know either he researches it, seeking authoritative rulings from other rabbis.  We don't have the Great Assembly today, but if we did it would act as a sort of \"supreme court\".</p>\n\n<p>Individual Jews <em>do</em> study <em>halacha</em> and torah more generally.  But we don't presume the authority to rule for ourselves or to decide in our own communities that, hey, we kind of like bacon so we're going to declare it kosher (or whatever).  <em>Halachic</em> interpretation is based on established processes, processes that God gave Moshe on Sinai and that were passed down from there.  Arguments such as those recorded in the talmud are the <em>application</em> of those processes which, like modern science, don't always produce only one interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>When the rabbis responded to the <em>bat kol</em>, the heavenly voice that had said \"he's right\", saying that the torah is not in heaven, God <em>agreed</em> with them and validated their process.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Orthodox Judaism views rabbinic disagreements as differences of opinion regarding how to apply the divine principles given us by G-d, not arguing against any of them. </p>\n\n<p>Maimonides states in his Introduction to the Talmud that the Torah has three categories of laws: recieved, derived, and legislated. He says that every commandment that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Our Teacher Moses was given with its explanation. Sometimes this was different from the way that an uninformed reader might interpret it, or involved details not mentioned in the text, so it was necessary that this explanation be passed along with the text. This is the recieved law. </p>\n\n<p>However, not every detail in every possible situation was passed on. A system of 13 rules for deriving laws from the wording of the text was included in the explanation, so that the traditional explanation could be checked for transmission errors against the original text, and new details could be gleaned that were not stated explicitly. G-d so designed the text of the Pentateuch to lead to these conclusions by way of the special rules. Maimonides writes that there have never been rabbinic disputes regarding either of these first two categories. </p>\n\n<p>The third category is that the Pentateuch explicitly granted the rabbis the mandate to create legislation to safeguard and standardize the observance of the commandments. Legislation enacted on the basis of this mandate is binding by force of G-d's command as well, since it says to follow the rabbis' words whatever they will tell you. It is only in this area that disputes arise. </p>\n\n<p>Exodus 23:2 says not to follow the majority for evil, implying that if the majority position is valid, one should follow it. Rabbi Eliezer was able to get heaven to validate him because G-d had left the disputed question of law undecided and both sides of the dispute had valid arguments. Therefore, when Rabbi Eliezer refused to accept the majority vote, he was going against the stated will of G-d. </p>\n\n<p>To delve further into this fascinating system of Torah law, please see:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/812102\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What is the \"Oral Torah\"?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/624196\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Is It Really the Torah, Or Is It Just the Rabbis?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/3225640\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why Can’t the Rabbis Agree on Anything?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

The answer lies in the difference of the words themselves used in the verses (both Hebrew and English provided by <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0531.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mechon-mamre</a>): </p>\n\n<p>1) Tehillim (119:54)- \"<strong>זְמִרוֹת</strong>, הָיוּ-לִי חֻקֶּיךָ--בְּבֵית מְגוּרָי...Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.\" </p>\n\n<p>2) Devarim (31:19) \"וְעַתָּה, כִּתְבוּ לָכֶם אֶת-<strong>הַשִּׁירָה</strong> הַזֹּאת, וְלַמְּדָהּ אֶת-בְּנֵי-יִשְׂרָאֵל, שִׂימָהּ בְּפִיהֶם:  לְמַעַן תִּהְיֶה-לִּי הַשִּׁירָה הַזֹּאת, לְעֵד--בִּבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל. \"</p>\n\n<p>This difference of terminology is explained beautifully by <a href=\"http://www.torah.org.il/learning/ravfrand/5760/naso.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Frand</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gaon answers that there exists a tremendous difference between\n  \"Zemirah\" and \"Shirah\". Zemirah, like the Zemiros of Shabbos, are\n  finite. They have a beginning and end. [Kah Ribbon (a Sabbath song)\n  starts with a Yud, it ends with a Lamed -- and it's over. All Zemiros\n  are similar.] Shirah represents the infinite. Shirah represents the\n  articulation and expression of feelings, which have no end and no\n  beginning. When a person breaks out in Shirah, it is a manifestation\n  of what his essence is all about. There is no end to that. It is not\n  finite.\n   Torah can be called Shirah, but Torah can not be called Zimra. To refer to Torah as Zimra has the connotation that there can be a beginning to Torah and an end to Torah and then I would be finished with Torah. That is untrue. Torah can't be finished. Torah is Shirah -- the infinite expression of what a Jew is all about, his innermost essence. That was King Dovid's sin. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The simple answer is that the torah is much more than a song and Dovid is getting criticised because on his level he should not of called it a song. \nThere is a deeper answer that the שיר song, also is connected to שיר which means circle, a circle being seeing the whole picture, whereas dovid he shouldn't of called it a song as he could not see the whole picture. \nAnd with regards to Hashem calling it a song since Hashem can see the whole picture he has the ability to call it a song. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_ben_Abraham_of_Sens\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Samson of Sens</a> explains in his commentary to Ahilot (16:4) that in context of this Midrash, \"song\" refers to a mere metaphor:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואף על גב דאיענש דוד על שקרא לדברי תורה זמירות ר\"ע משל בעלמא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the pashtanim do not interpret the verse in a negative light, (cf. Radak, Alshikh, and Malbim to Psalms 119:54).</p>\n\n<p>Note also that on a <em>peshat</em> level, Deuteronomy (31:19) likely doesn't refer to the entire Torah, (cf. Rashi, Rashbam, and Ramban there).</p>\n\n<p>In summary, there is no contradiction since on peshat level, the Torah as a whole is not referred to as a song, and furthermore, according to peshat, the verse in Psalms indicates no wrongdoing on the part of Moses. Even according to the Midrash in Sotah, David's intent is interpreted as dismissing the Torah's laws as mere parables; something which Deuteronomy (31:19) does not imply.</p>\n\n\n",

This isn't the best translation. A better translation might be \"close friend\", or \"fellow\". The word is used to apply to any Jew, technically, as all Jews should be \"close\" to each other in terms of responsibility and caring. In any case, certainly, in the commandment, it is not restricted by geography.</p>\n\n<p>As for the general point of this commandment not to covet <strong>anything</strong> that belongs to your \"fellow\" (I'm using my loose translation, here. Also, see the end of the verse. that says \"everything\". I won't delve into the concept behind itemizing prior to saying \"everything\".) is a question raised by several commentators. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=318\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> asks how is it possible that someone cannot covet something nice that he sees? He explains that this is exactly the concept of training one's heart and mind. His example is that one does not covet the princess, because he knows that he can't do this (she's the king's daughter, and if he is a villager, he is unworthy to bother with the princess.) Likewise, one does not covet his mom even if she is beautiful.</p>\n\n<p>So the Torah is stating a general rule - train your mind to be satisfied with what G-d has given you so that you will have no reason to covert anything that belongs to any Jew, regardless of where he lives.</p>\n\n<p>@Danno is correct in that the Torah frequently expresses things in what is most \"familiar\". I.e., in this case, it would be relatively easy to covet your close friend's wife, because, after all, you are close to your friend, and maybe, you have become friendly with his wife. So, in a sense, the Torah may be making a specific point by stating don't do this with anyone, not even your close friend's wife. </p>\n\n\n",

But despite this,  they didn't even bother to go back and take them. Additionally, the place itself is not a secure place. Thus, even if the owner didn't left them intentionally, they are lost. But the main reason is called   <strong>\"Aveda Midaat\"</strong> (an intentional loss) as one who junk a seal in a non secure place.  By their behavior, they showed that they intentionally abandoned them. They cannot come afterwards the expect payment. At most, they can take back the esrogs if they are still here. But until they get them back, they are still not considered their property. Why a synagogue is not a secure place? It is  <strong>a public  place</strong>  and non-Jewish persons come regularly to cleaning up the spill. Children walk there and will potentially damage the Esrogim. To leave even not intentionally a valuable object in such a place maybe automatically considered as renunciation (Yeush) (They refused to recover them). Gemara told about synagogues and place where non Jewish people walk (Bate Knesiot and Makom Sheakum Metsuyim).</p>\n<h3>Thus we have strong  reasons to validate the mitsva without paying.</h3>\n<p>See SA CM 260, 7.   and 261, 4</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Many monetary arguments are a matter of a mere misunderstanding. The rule is always <strong>\"המוציא מחברו עליו הראייה\"</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>The presumption holds that <strong>whatever people possess they possess rightfully</strong>. Therefore the seller must prove his point, namely that the Esrogim were left intentionally and there was a note or a person that would ensure that people don't confuse then with Hefker, and not the taker. </p>\n\n<p>Until then the taker had fulfilled the Mitzvah of Esrog.</p>\n\n\n",

Amital with his co-Rosh Yeshiva R. [Aharon] Lichtenstein.\" The first story is also relevant to the broader question, but the second case is this one exactly.</p>\n<p>To quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second story concerns the scenario where one is in an extreme situation and has this choice: whether to either eat human flesh or pork. The standard halakhah designates pork as a biblical prohibition and human flesh as only a rabbinic prohibition (assuming the flesh is already dead and there is no question of murder); hence one should eat the human flesh. R. Lichtenstein is wont to go further and consistently point out that the punishment for the consumption of pork is only lashes while eating fruits from the priestly portion that has not been taken is excision (karet). In contrast, R. Amital almost shouts out from his soul that human flesh should be repulsive to everyone's natural sense of morality so that one should eat the pork, and the reason that the prohibition was not stated in the Torah was because this revulsion is a natural intuition not needing to be stated. R. Amital also adds a more halakhic reason that the calculation of choosing to violate a rabbinic prohibition over a biblical one is itself only rabbinic.</p>\n<p>He further cites as a paradigm for his thought the famous statement of Rabbi Moses Samuel Glasner (1856-1924) in his Introduction to Hullin...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>... for which you should see mevaqesh's answer.</p>\n<p>In the version I first heard, R Amital concluded that he assumes that in practice both would eat the pork. The difference is R' Lichtenstein would afterward feel he did something wrong.</p>\n<p>But, as R/Dr Brill stays in closing his discussion of the case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R. Amital guards himself in the halakhic realm by noting that some say R. Glazer went too far—and may not be correct as halakhah. However, for R. Amital, R. Glazer’s approach can still serve as our paradigm of ethics and as a rejection of legal formalism by affirming mandates outside of texts (page 40). Once again we are left without criteria about when to rely on this moral sense; rather, R. Amital asks the important questions of the moral dilemmas of collateral damage, triage, and wartime ethics, but he does not give answers. R. Amital’s consistent reliance on moral sense exemplifies his commitment to the idea that we should be trained to think for ourselves and figure out the needed and correct response in these difficult situations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Shmuel_Glasner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Moshe Shemuel Glasner</a> (1856-1924)  writes in the introduction of his <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=37184#p=50&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Dor HaRevi'i to Chullin</strong> <em>Pesicha Kolleles</em> § 2 <em>s.v</em> עוד משל אחת</a>  that if one has the option to consume human flesh or non-kosher meat, even though the former is at most prohibited by a positive commandment, while the latter is prohibited by a more stringent negative commandment, it is preferable to consume the animal flesh. This stems from meta-halachic concerns which he discusses there at length. The primary issue is that cannibalism is something which ought to be repulsive to us even sans technicalities, and is to be avoided even at the expense of the prohibition of forbidden meat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל מה שנתקבל בעיני בני אדם הנאורים לתועבה, אפילו אינו מפורש בתורה לאיסור, העובר על זה גרע מן העובר על חוקי התורה . . . ועתה אמור נא, בחולה שיש בו סכנה ולפניו בשר בהמה נחורה או טרפה ובשר אדם, איזה בשר יאכל, הכי נאמר דיאכל בשר אדם שאין בו איסור תורה אע\"פ שמחוק הנימוס שמקובל מכלל האנושי, כל האוכל או מאכיל בשר אדם מודח מלהיות נמנה בין האישים, ולא יאכל בשר שהתורה אסרו בלאו, היעלה על הדעת שאנו עם הנבחר עם חכם ונבון נעבור על חוק הנימוס כזה להינצל מאיסור תורה? אתמהה! ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>So we will now analyze the order of which comes first human or treif animal Flesh .</p>\n\n<p>Rambam Hilchos maacholos asuros 2,3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האדם אע\"פ שנאמר בו ויהי האדם לנפש חיה אינו מכלל מיני חיה בעלת פרסה לפיכך אינו בלא תעשה. והאוכל מבשר האדם או מחלבו בין מן החי בין מן המת אינו לוקה. אבל אסור הוא בעשה שהרי מנה הכתוב שבעת מיני חיה ואמר בהן זאת החיה אשר תאכלו הא כל שהוא חוץ מהן לא תאכלו ולאו הבא מכלל עשה עשה:<br>\n  A Man even though referred to as a \"Chaya\" is not included in the category of chaya which the Torah enlists with regards to kosher/nonkosher animals.

But its still forbiddon to eat as it says \"These are the animals which you should eat, which implies an exclusion to humans which are not in the category of \"chaya.\"\n  Therefore there is a prohibition implied from a permission which is a mitzvas asei.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maggid Mishna:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה דעת הרמב\"ן ז\"ל והרשב\"א ז\"ל שאין בבשר האדם איסור כלל מן התורה אלא שהרמב\"ן ז\"ל כתב שהישראל שמת בשרו אסור אף בהנאה מן התורה וכבר נתבאר דין איסור ההנאה של מת בדברי רבינו פי\"ד מהלכות אבל.<br>\n  The Ramban and Rashba say with regards to such meat there is no prohibition from the Torah whatsoever, but with a dead jewish corpse one cannot have benifit from it </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishne Lemelech Hilchos aveilus 14,21 says about benefiting from a dead body</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור בהנאה משום דאתיא שם שם מעגלה ערופה והיא הלכה פסוקה כתבוה כל הפוסקים ז\"ל ובכל איסורי הנאה המכירה היא אסורה מדין תורה דהא איצטריך הכתוב להתיר נבלה בהנאה - It is forbidden to have benefit from the dead body from the Torah as we learn from Egla arupha to Miriams body a Gezeira shava \"Shom Shom\" unanimously agreed from all the Poskim and this includes selling the body.<br>\n  He continues later on:תשובת הרשב\"א סימן שס\"ה שהשואל היה סבור דג\"ש זו לא נאמרה אלא במתי ישראל ועל זה השיב דאי איכא מת דלא מיתסר בהנאה יין נסך דאסור בהנאה מנא לן דאי משום דאיתקש לזבח וזבח איתקש למת ההוא מת גופיה מנא לן דמתי ישראל קאמר ע\"כ הרי דס\"ל להרשב\"א דאף מת עכו\"ם אסור בהנאה - basically not only a Jewish body but also a gentile body is Ossur Behanaa (prohibited to have benefit) Mideoraisa (from the torah) and this is the opinion of the Rashba Ramban and Rambam(aveil 14 21 see radvaz). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To explain the Rambam that says there is only a asei for eating a human and no prohibition or Issur hanaa the mishne Lemelech brings the Rashba that concludes רשב\"א ריש סימן שס\"ד שכתב אבל לפי דעתי יהיה זה בבשר מן החי אבל המת למדו בו ג\"ש מעגלה ערופה , this halacha -that there is only an asei on eating the meat- applies to meat from a live human i.e a limb fell off. But a dead man has a prohibition (Lo taaseh) that is even forbidon for benefit from Egla arufa which is in turn derived from Kodshim as it says in Sanhedrin 29b:  כתיב הכא (במדבר כ, א) ותמת שם מרים וכתיב התם (דברים כא, ד) וערפו שם את העגלה בנחל מה להלן אסור בהנאה אף כאן נמי אסור בהנאה והתם מנלן אמרי דבי רבי ינאי כפרה כתיב בה כקדשים: and Kodshim is prohibited with a Lo taase of וזר לא יאכל כי קדש הם (shemos 29,33)</p>\n\n<p>In summary if your in the dessert with a live guy who's limb fell off, a dog, a dead man (regardless of his religion) and loads of ants (they even live in the dessert) and it is pikuach nefesh to eat, according to the above <strong>This is the order:</strong><br>\n<strong>1.The limb from a live man,(Rambam-asei deoraisa)(Rosh-ossur derabanan)(Ramban-muttar)<br>\n2.The dog which is prohibited to eat but permissable to benefit from,(Lo taasee)<br>\n3.The dead human which is a even prohibited Biblically to benefit from,(Rambam-lo saase & asei)(Ramban Lo taase)<br>\n4.The ants for which each one is chayav 5 lo saasehs (see makos 13b).</strong></p>\n\n<p>Note:The halacha does not follow rabbi Glasner who says the worst thing is to eat human flesh as the Rashbash siman 518 quotes the baalei Tosfos saying that their was a Minhag for the mother of the child to eat the Orla forskin that was cut of during the Mila. This was not pikuach nefesh and yet permitted by the Baalei tosfos lechatchila. This ruling against Hagaon Harav Glasner is confirmed by Hagaon Harav Aharon Lichtenshtien Zatzal one of the 21st century poskimin in the quotation from Rabbi Dr Alan Brill cited in another answer.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi there comments</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בשלשה מקומות נאמר בעצם היום הזה,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(: Heb. בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה. In three places Scripture employs the phrase: בְּעֶצֶם הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה [which has the meaning, “at the strongest light of the day”].)</p>\n<p>[text and translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9996#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.]</p>\n<p>Rashi then goes to explain the 3 uses: Bereishit 7:13 (Noach entering the teivah), Shemot 12:51 (the Exodus), and the Devarim quote, Moshe's death. In each case the point is that Hashem ensured that the event took place at that time, over the objections of others.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/galeinai-5767-lechlecha/?print=print\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> website points out that Rashi, in his count ignores Bereisht 17:23 (and 26). The meaning there apparently does not indicate any objection that Hashem had to overcome. Rashi's commentary has to do with the specific day and Avraham's circumcising despite the challenges of others,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the very day that he was commanded (Mid. Ps. 112:2), during the day and not at night. He was afraid neither of the heathens nor of the scorners. [He circumcised in the light of day] so that his enemies and his contemporaries would not say,“Had we seen him, we would not have allowed him to circumcise and to fulfill the commandment of the Omnipresent” (Gen. Rabbah 47:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and later (17:26) simply an indicator of a particular day,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>when Abraham reached the age of ninety-nine and Ishmael [reached the age of] thirteen,“Abraham was circumcised, and [so was] Ishmael his son.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But there are also other uses of the phrase. In Vayikra 23, the phrase is used 4 times (21, 28, 29, 30) regarding the cessation of work on Shavu'ot and Yom Kippur and the self affliction on Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>While one could also say that these uses don't conform to the explanation Rashi gives so he doesn't include them, doesn't their existence indicate that Rashi's explanation is wrong? He identifies three uses and says that the uses point to the phrase's meaning, but ignores that the phrase is used 6 other times where its use DOESN'T point to that explanation. He draws a conclusion from an intentionally selective sample almost as if his conclusion came first (that the phrase had to mean something) so he only chose citations which support that conclusion.</p>\n<p>Is there any explanation to Rashi's selective comments and his excluding examples when coming to a decision about the significance of the phrase? If the phrase more often DOESN'T mean \"over the objections of others\" why insert that understanding at all? Why not just say that the phrase means what it says -- precisely on that day?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <em>Sefer Zikaron</em> explains that Rashi doesn't mean to suggest that these are the only instances of the phrase, nor that this is the only possible way of understanding its significance. Rashi is merely pointing out that in these three cases there is a similar meaning. </p>\n\n<p>Other commentaries point out that these three cases involve [historical] occurrences that were dictated by God to occur specifically by day, unlike the case of Avraham who chose to do it by day on his own.</p>\n\n<p>As for the necessity to explain a deeper significance to the phrase, the commentaries suggest that the word 'בְּעֶצֶם' doesn't add anything to the plain meaning of the verse, and therefore requires explanation.</p>\n\n\n",

Plus, people are out and about in the afternoon usually so it's not easy to have Tefillin around.</p>\n\n<p>In general nowadays most communities do not don Tefillin at Mincha, and doing so in those places could constitute Yuhara (see Igrot Moshe OC 4:34), yet there have been many individuals over the years who have been careful to don Tefillin at Mincha, at least in private (see eg. Magen Avraham OC 37, B'Yitzchak Yikarei ibid., Ma'aseh Rav 63, Ben Ish Chai I Vayaqhel 6, etc.).

This is also brougth down by the Ben Ish Chai in parashat Chayei Sara.</p>\n<p>In these circles they normally wear Shimusha Rabba tefillin or Rabbeinu Tam ones in their absence. Some chassidic background individuals do make a point of wearing Rabbeinu Tam tefillin at mincha to say kedusha with them on.</p>\n<p>As per raw halacha, see this shiur by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PBdFLeRW4EE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Avi Grossman</a> discussing how according to the Rambam, Bet Yosef, Aruch HaShulchan, and even Mishnah Berura one needs to wear a tallit gadol for all the prayers, including mincha. See Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 9:1 that every Jew should endeavor to wear a tallit gadol during prayer including Mincha.</p>\n<p>See also M”A 37:2 in name of Menahem Azariah da Fano that he instituted to wear the Tefillin also by Mincha (See Beer Heitiv, Eliyah Rabba, and Shaarey Teshuvah 37 ad loc; Reishis Chochmah 6:54 and 63; Biur Halacha 37 “Beshaaas”).</p>\n<p>See Rav Moshe Feinstein zt\"l in Igrot Mosheh 4:34 that is ok to do so if you have adopted this custom. Obviously, if it is not your minhag to wear tefillin at mincha, it is ok to wear them at mincha if you had no chance to wear tefillin on that day until that time.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, tefillin are not worn in that case on Erev Shabbos or Yom Tov (Shaarey Teshuvah 34:6; Biur Halacha ibid; Kaf Hachaim 37:11) unless you have not done so previously and this is the last chance to do the mitzvah. If this is the case, it would be advisable to wear them privately first and then join the minyan if possible.</p>\n\n\n",

Generally the Mesader Kiddushin is the boy's Rosh HaYeshiva or a Rabbi that the boy is close to. Regarding the reading of the Kesuba, most common I have found is that the girl's side selects the one to receive that honor. Witnesses are usually split with one from each side. The Brachos are split, however I found that it is more common that the boy's side gets more than the girl's side. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Most commonly, <em>mesader kiddushin</em> is a rabbi that the groom trusts. (Though it has been proposed that theoretically, it should be whichever rabbi the majority of the crowd knows/trusts/prefers.) Beyond that, from what I've seen it's usually a fairly even split when possible. It's not uncommon for each side to pick one of the witnesses; and the sheva brachos are usually divided more or less evenly between the sides. (I'm not aware of any formula which bracha has to belong to whom, but if you listen to how they're called out, it's usually three-to-four people on his side, and three-to-four people on hers.)</p>\n\n<p>I can't help but mention the (true) story of a chassidish fellow who married his second cousin. <em>Mechubad with third bracha, Rabbi Ploni BenPloni, great-uncle of the chosson.

Here are my results. </p>\n\n<h1>Three Digits</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Repeats</strong><br>\nAsterisks are the ones addressed by Rashi and the aforementioned question</p>\n\n<pre><code>Adam (Bereishis (5:5)\nSheis (Bereishis 5:6-8)\nEnosh (Bereishis 5:10-11)\nKeinan (Bereishis 5:13-14)\nMehallalel (Bereishis 5:15-17)\nYered (Bereishis 5:18,20)\nChanoch (Bereishis 5:23)\nMesushelach (Bereishis 5:25-27)\nLemech (Bereishis 5:28)\nNoach (Bereishis 9:28-29)\nArpachshad (Bereishis 11:13)\nShelach (Bereishis 11:15)\nEiver (Bereishis 11:17)\nPeleg (Bereishis 11:19)\nRe'u (Bereishis 11:21)\nNachor (Bereishis 11:25)\nTerach (Bereishis 11:32)\n*Sarah (Bereishis 23:1)\n*Avraham (Bereishis 25:7)\n*Yishmael (Bereishis 25:17)\nYitzchak (Bereishis 35:28)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Repeats for 2/3 digits</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Lamech (Bereishis 5:30-31)\nYaakov (Bereishis 47:28)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Doesn't repeat</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Adam (Bereishis 5:3)\nYaakov (Bereishis 47:9)\nYosef (Bereishis 50:22,26)\nLevi (Shemos 6:16)\nKehas (Shemos 6:18)\nAmram (Shemos 6:20)\nYears spent in Mitzraim (why limit it to people? - Shemos 12:40-41)\nAharon (Bamidbar 33:39)\nMoshe (Devarim 34:7)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Two digits</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Repeats</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Avraham (Bereishis 12:4, 16:16)\nYaakov (Bereishis 47:28)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Doesn't repeat</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Arpachshad (Bereishis 11:12)\nEiver (Bereishis 11:16)\nRe'u (Bereishis 11:20)\nAvraham (Bereishis 17:24)\nAharon (Shemos 7:7)\nYovel (Still not limiting it to people - Vayikra 25:8)\nAge of Leviim (Bamidbar 8:24)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So... In conclusion, if the number is three digits, it tends to repeat Shanah after all of them, while it's the opposite if it's two digits. There are exceptions to both. Notice how certain people, like Avraham (who Rashi asked about) appear in both categories. Notice also that although Yaakov appears in both categories, everyone who lived after him - and our non-people which also appear after Yaakov's death - appear only in the \"doesn't repeat\" category, regardless of the number of digits. </p>\n\n<p>Why this is the case is for another question. My question is: why does Rashi make such a big deal about Sarah and Avraham, and the Maskil L'Dovid on Yishmael, when that seems to be perfectly normal in the Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <em>Levush Ha'orah</em> explains that what makes these cases unique is that 'shanah' is written <strong>all three times</strong>: once after the hundreds, once after the tens, and once after the units. </p>\n\n<p>(Your examples of repetition only have 'shana' two times.)</p>\n\n\n",

But the Tenach  never talks about the brain (Moach; nor the Neshamah) but rather about the body and inner man in terms of soul and heart etc. Still there's this teaching about placing our Moach first.. pure intellect above the emotions (and subjective).. how does the Yetzarim fit into this all, and can we overcome our Yetzer hara by pure intellect (through our mind?) </p>\n\n<p>How do these different teachings complement each other? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Regarding intellect</p>\n\n<p>That in the Tenach we do see regarding intellect the word shma in shma Yesroel means to understand, the word \"<strong>heart</strong>\" in the Tenach is not excluding the brain, it is all of the inner man (there is a interesting intellectual book called \"the duties of the heart\", it is a logical book regarding the duties of the brain)</p>\n\n<p>The point that intellect rules over the heart is not that you can control yourself,<br>\n(you can control yourself in thought speach and deed anyway, if G-d blessed be he made something forbidden he gave you the power to control yourself (in a case of rape (when you can not control yourself) it is not forbidden))).<br>\nThe point is that the (subconscious) emotions are not wild, they do things which from their point of view is good for you, what intellect rules means is that if you think, understand and decided that someone is <strong>good</strong> for you this will effect your emotions, and your yezer (a lot of psychological disorders are caused by environmental factors, mainly that a behavior was/is beneficial to the person so he continues doing it, if the person himself wants to he can change it by <strong>understanding</strong> that other behaviors are better for him),  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Please clarify the rest of your question in the comments below</p>\n\n\n",

The Ramban 5:15\n  indicates that the opposite is true, and the Rama (O.C. 603:1)\n  actually quotes as accepted halakha: one must expend greater effort in\n  repenting from a sin that he might have committed than for one that he\n  know for certain that he has committed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can you expound or elaborate on the quotes given here. What is Rama? It'd  be great if you provide full quote and online reference link.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rama is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Moshe Isserless</a>. He wrote annotations on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan aruch</a>. Shulchan Aruch was written by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Ephraim_Karobhttps://enhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Ephraim_Karowikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Ephraim_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Karo</a>. Shulchan Aruch is divided in 4 parts (following the 4 parts of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arba%27ah_Turim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4 Turim</a>) The first part is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orach_Chayim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chayim</a> (= OC). 603 is the num. of the Chapter, 1 is the paragraph. This is in Halachot Rosh Hashana. Rama said: Doubt about sin is stringent than sin. this is a mixture of personal words of Rama mixed with words of Rabenu Yona on Brachot. You can find the quoted passage in Wikitext <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וספק עבירה צריך יותר תשובה מעבירה ודאי כי יותר מתחרט כשיודע שעשה משאינו יודע ולכן קרבן אשם תלוי הוצרך להיות יותר ביוקר מחטאת (דברי עצמו ורבינו יונה ריש ברכות):‏</p>\n  \n  <p>A doubt about sin need more repentance (a greater effort to reach repentance) than a sure sin, because one who know that he have erred (naturally) repents more than one who doesn't know if he have erred. Therefore the korban Asham Talui is more expensive than the korban Chat'at (to buy it needs more financial effort).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gaon Mivilna reported the source as a Gemara in Kretot 22b (the Gemara needs a special drasha for the minimum value of Asham talui, without this Drasha we would think that the value of 1/6 dinar is good enough as chat'at) and Avot Derabbi Nathan. This Drasha stresses that tshuva for doubt... as RAMA wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban is on Parashat <a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01585.html?dyn#HtmpReportNum0004_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra, 5</a>, 15:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וטעם אשם תלוי מפני שבעליו סבור שאין עליו עונש כי לא נודע שחטא מפני זה החמיר עליו הכתוב בספקו יותר מודאו </p>\n  \n  <p>The reason ... because of the tendency to think that there is no punishment when it is not certain that he made an error. This is the reason of the stringency for this offering which comes after a doubt... (there is above a large explanation of the word asham) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I ask whether any of the ingredients included one of the 5 grains susceptible to Chodosh. If there are, then I can't eat it, because it is possibly chodosh.

The pasuk in Psalms is quoted (85:14) [In Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, 8:1-2] and used to explain that first the Righteousness of the Creator must be declared (by praying), and only after that, can one set out to fulfill their needs, desires, and personal endeavors. </p>\n\n<p>If voting falls under \"personal needs\" then the above would lead one to believe that it is forbidden to vote before praying Shacharit. Furthermore, I cannot fine a source that classifies voting as a \"dvar mitzvah\" and even if it was, it would not be permitted as one must pray before fulfilling other mitzvot. </p>\n\n<p>One may argue that a mitzvah that one will lose the opportunity to fulfill may take precedence over the obligation of the Shacharit Prayer. However, I would contend that since voting is something one can do the entire day (and in some states even via mail) it would not supersede the obligation to pray Shacharit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would say voting is <em>Dvar Mitzvah</em> because for every vote that goes towards a moderate party, the extremists are another step away from coming to power. (This would apply in most western voting systems, but I'm not sure about the US.)</p>\n\n<p>Being a positive thing to do that is <strong>not</strong> for your own needs means that you could probably vote before praying if need be. However, the whole point of not doing things before tefillah is so that you don't get preoccupied and miss the tefillah. So if you are able to, it is commendable to pray (\"daven\" for our Yiddish-speaking brethren) first.</p>\n\n\n",

No matter how you slice these facts, my individual vote is pointless.

But until that point my vote doesn't matter. When the numbers change then we can knock this point off the list. Our country will probably be in deep trouble at that point as well.</p>\n<p>So, then, if my vote doesn't count any more than a grain of sand on the beach, why should I bother doing my hishtadlus? It's not called hishtadlus if it doesn't matter what I choose. <strong>The choice, then, of <em>whether</em> to vote is the same as the choice of <em>who to vote for</em>.

Rabbi Isbee of Ner Yisrael has said that only two entities in this world exhibit free choice, Hashem and <strong>living</strong> humanity. In this case it does not matter that the results may appear to be independent of the choice being made but that the person has made the choice and has exhibited his hishtadlus by doing so.</p>\n<p>My Rav also explained that by voting a person is showing his \"citizenship\" and that he is acting as a good and valid member of the society.

Note that Hashem delayed the mabul until after Mesushelach died even thogh he was only one person among however many millions there were in the world.</p>\n<p>We see that we are told to act as if the entire world has been placed in exact balance and our actions will place the weight in one side of the scale or the other. Rabbi Dessler explains that not only is a person to treat himself as if he is at the tipping point, but that the entire world will depend on the next action that the individual chooses to make.</p>\n<p>One can never know how what appears to be an insignificant action can change the world.

For it is considered proper hishtadlus - effort. And since it is hishtadlus, it falls into the realm of spiritual affairs. And Rabbis are considered sources of counsel and wisdom regarding spiritual matters.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the extrapolation is that, despite the mathematical insignificance, being that everyone is expected to employ his own personal histadlus, regardless of the outcome - It would be incumbent upon each person to fulfill their chiyuv hishtadlus.

Rabbi Akiva chose this particular verse because he understood it to be referring specifically to 'האידנא' - the time of the Roman Empire. See <em>R\"S Midessau</em> (found in the back of many <em>Gemara</em>s) who points out that Rashi on page 9a writes that עניים מרודים תביא בית refers to the Roman era specifically.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think the point was that TurnusRuffus assumed the state of the destitute proved that Hashem wants them to stay that way. Rabbi Akiva's response was that is untrue as Hashem commanded us to feed them.</p>\n\n<p>This is in line with the original statement in the gemara that led us into this discussion: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא היה רבי מאיר אומר יש לו לבעל הדין להשיבך ולומר לך אם אלהיכם אוהב עניים הוא מפני מה אינו מפרנסן אמור לו כדי שניצול אנו בהן מדינה של גיהנם וזו שאלה שאל טורנוסרופוס הרשע את ר''ע אם אלהיכם אוהב עניים הוא מפני מה אינו מפרנסם א''ל כדי שניצול אנו בהן מדינה של גיהנם וכו׳. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason this verse was chosen is that it specifically refers to the poor as wayward. That was part of Rabbi Akiva's response, when we keep the Torah we are children, when we are wayward we are slaves  who still deserve to be supported. </p>\n\n\n",

Others, however, such as the Tifferet Yisrael (Yakhin to Pesahim 4:5:24) write explicitly that the offering is not for atonement.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I searched in Rambam <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/9100.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hilchot Korban Pessach</a> and if I don't miss something, no Kappara (atonement) is mentioned.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to the answer of mevaqesh</em>  we can see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40744&st=&pgnum=392&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> the  Tif'eret Israel who is astonished by the Tosfot Yom Tov comparison between Pessach and taanit about  Kappara. The astonishing of Tif'eret Israel is perhaps also due to the lack of sources.</p>\n<p>But after an accurate lecture of <strong>Tosfot Yom Tov,  he also not said that the Pessach is Kappara</strong> . He said  a comparison between the sets: the  set of  korbanot and the set of  taaniot (not a comparison between the two items Pessach and taanit).  The major feature of the set of  korbanot is Kappara and  the set of taaniot also.  So Pessach as an item of the set of korbanot which is mainly characterized by  capara.  So the name capara is linked to pessach by his specie.</p>\n<p>But the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9223&st=&pgnum=144&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levush Hachur OC 468, 1 </a> <strong>also  found by  @mevaqesh</strong>  doesn't support this  teruts.  Anyway here It is probably right  to answer that to make himself exempt from caret because bitul mitsvat asse of Korban Pessach is the called  Kappara but  <strong>not at the sense of taanit.</strong></p>\n<p>So as suggested by the lecture of Rambam (and Gemara and Tora ) Pessach is not a Korban  Kappara and <strong>even the authors cited as thinking that it's Kappara don't really said that.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

To give wine from the pagum to the not pagum make the two pgumim.<br>\n2. So first from the not pagum to the pagum and back from it to the first. Don't mistake! </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אחרי שהוא שתה, היין שבכוסו פגום, וצריך לתקנו. ניתן לתקן אותו ע\"י מזיגת יין לתוכו מתוך הכוס של שבע הברכות, ובכך מרויחים שני דברים – גם ערבוב של יין ברהמ\"ז עם יין שבע הברכות, וגם תיקון הכוס הפגום. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3.Thanks to the mixture each cup contains finally wine from the  two  mitsvot.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אח\"כ צריך להחזיר מאותו כוס בחזרה לכוס של שבע הברכות כדי שגם בכוס השני תהיה תערובת של שני היינות.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The first one is regarding the demise of Tyre,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּנְתַתִּיךְ לִצְחִיחַ סֶלַע מִשְׁטַח חֲרָמִים תִּהְיֶה לֹא תִבָּנֶה\n  עוֹד כִּי אֲנִי יְדֹוָד דִּבַּרְתִּי נְאֻם אֲדֹנָי\n   יֱדֹוִד:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This verse contains two predictions: 1) that Tyre will be destroyed and never regain its previous stature. 2) that the island will become a spot for the fisherman to spread their nets (משטח חרמים). The first one indeed occurred in the times of Alexander the great. For six months he besieged it till he broke through their defenses and reduced it to ruins, and since then it was never rebuilt. The second one has also undoubtedly been fulfilled,  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Historian Philip Myers said, “Alexander the Great reduced it [Tyre] to\n  ruins (332 B.C.). She recovered in a measure from this blow, but never\n  regained the place she had previously held in the world. The larger\n  part of the site … is now as bare as the top of a rock–a place where\n  the fishermen that still frequent the spot spread their nets to dry”\n  (General History for Colleges and High Schools [Boston: Ginn and Co.,\n  1889], p. 55). That fulfills the prophecies of Ezekiel 26:4-5, 14. The\n  island city was repopulated, later to be destroyed by the Moslems in\n  A.D. 1281. However, God said the mainland city would never be\n  rebuilt–and it never has. Jerusalem has been rebuilt many times but\n  Tyre will never be rebuilt because a prophet in Babylon said\n  twenty-five centuries ago, “Thou shalt be built no more” (Ezek.\n  26:14).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is one more remarkable prophecy regarding Tyre that its accuracy astounds the reader,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי כֹה אָמַר אֲדֹנָי יֱדֹוִד בְּתִתִּי אֹתָךְ עִיר\n  נֶחֱרֶבֶת כֶּעָרִים אֲשֶׁר לֹא נוֹשָׁבוּ בְּהַעֲלוֹת עָלַיִךְ אֶת\n  תְּהוֹם וְכִסּוּךְ הַמַּיִם הָרַבִּים: (כ) וְהוֹרַדְתִּיךְ אֶת\n  יוֹרְדֵי בוֹר אֶל עַם עוֹלָם וְהוֹשַׁבְתִּיךְ בְּאֶרֶץ תַּחְתִּיּוֹת\n  כָּחֳרָבוֹת מֵעוֹלָם אֶת יוֹרְדֵי בוֹר לְמַעַן לֹא תֵשֵׁבִי וְנָתַתִּי\n  צְבִי בְּאֶרֶץ חַיִּים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed this has been fulfilled,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In his memoirs, a section is included concerning the city of Tyre.\n  From Sidon it is half a day’s journey to Sarepta (Sarfend), which\n  belongs to Sidon. Thence it is a half-day to New Tyre (Sur), which is\n  a very fine city, with a harbour in its midst.... There is no harbour\n  like this in the whole world. Tyre is a beautiful city.... In the\n  vicinity is found sugar of a high class, for men plant it here, and\n  people come from all lands to buy it. A man can ascend the walls of\n  New Tyre and see ancient Tyre, which the sea has now covered, lying at\n  a stone’s throw from the new city. And should one care to go forth by\n  boat, one can see the castles, market-places, streets, and palaces in\n  the bed of the sea (1907, emp. added.).</p>\n  \n  <p>From this twelfth-century A.D. text, then, we learn that by that\n  period of time the city known as ancient Tyre lay completely buried\n  beneath the sea and a new city, most likely on some part of the\n  island, had been erected.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition, Benjamin Tudela’s quote corresponds precisely to the\n  statement that the prophet made in the latter part of chapter 26: “For\n  thus says the Lord God: ‘When I make you a desolate city, like the\n  cities that are not inhabited, when I bring the deep upon you, and\n  great waters cover you’” (26:19, emp. added).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These prophecies have been so amazingly accurately fulfilled, that it caused some scholars to doubt the date of its composition (the book of Ezekiel). But  in reality it couldn't have been composed or even edited later than the second century BC (the time most of the Septuagint was written), and since the destruction of Tyre happened in the year 332 BC, there is not much room left for parts to have been inserted by editors. There is more evidence that the book has not been tampered with (since the prophecies of Ezekiel were written down during the exile), since the seemingly unfulfilled parts (the part with Nebuchadnezzar destroying Tyre, see below) were not excised from the book. In any case, the other two prophecies were surely not fulfilled until much later after the books of the Tanakh were canonized and reviewed by multitudes of people.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The block quotes are cited from <a href=\"http://apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=13&article=1790\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=13&article=1790</a></p>\n\n<p>Regarding the unfulfilled prophecy of Nebuchadnezzar destroying Tyre, see previous link where he tries to resolve the issue, however in my opinion the issue still remains unresolved. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are these statements about the Babylonian Talmud true?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently, I came across a website with a Q&A about whether there was any record of Jesus' miracles in non-Christian historical documents. The site claimed certain passages in the Babylonian Talmud show evidence of miraculous works. Here is the quote from the site:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first comes from the Babylonian Talmud 43a.    Babylonian Talmud \n  (late first or second century AD) Sanhedrin 43a-b: “On the\n  eve of the Passover they hanged Yeshu and the herald went before him\n  for forty days saying [Yeshu] is going forth to be stoned in that he\n  hate practiced sorcery and beguiled and led astray Israel.\"   Here Jesus\n  is accused of sorcery, in obvious parallel with the charge leveled in\n  Matthew 12:22-23.  The writer of the Talmud does not agree that Jesus\n  worked bona fide miracles, but he reports that he did things which, to\n  the enemies of Jesus, could only be written off as sorcery.    Also, in\n  Babylonian Sanhedrin 107b  it is claimed that Jesus practiced magic. In\n  tHul2:22-23  it is reported that healings were done in the name of\n  Jesus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am unable to read the Babylonian Talmud for myself, not to mention being grossly unqualified to interpret it (I am not Jewish, full disclosure). But I am very curious as to whether these statements are true, and what the Babylonian Talmud really says in the referenced sections.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although the quotation you provided is a true segment of the the Babylonian Talmud, there are multiple disputes regarding if this \"Yeshu\" character is actually Jesus of Nazareth or not.

The events surrounding this character often are similar to those in the Gospels, especially John.</p>\n\n<p>The events recorded in Talmud mss often reflect Jewish traditions recorded in the (later) Toledot Yeshu editions. Some details found in the Talmud are even recorded by earlier non-Jewish writers like Celsus (who describes what a Jew told him about Jesus). </p>\n\n<p>Still, the historical value of the Talmudic events is little. They were written as a sort of anti-Gospel to counter the narrative of the Christians. The Talmud generally describes Yeshu (ben Pandera) as a sorcerer who was rightfully executed by the authorities for a collection of reasons.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=IxIv_zqQx9kC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jesus in the Talmud</a> (Peter Schäfer) for a modern scholarly view.</p>\n\n\n",

According to Roman Law a finder obtained ownership of the object. Even now there is a slogan \"finders keepers, losers weepers\". However, there is a requirement to do a kiddush Hashem and an aveira to do a chillul Hashem (see Yerushalmi Bava Mezia 2:5 in Vilna ed. 8a regarding Shimon ben Shetach and the precious stone and Midrash Tehillim 12 regarding a certain chassid who returned an expensive object to a gentile aristocrat).</p>\n\n<p>Where the gentiles have belief in Gd and the rule of law some hold that here is a no prohibition to return it (Rambam according to Be'er HaGolah CM 266:2, Mammon Yisrael - Halachos of Others People’s Money by Rav Pinchas Bodner, pg. 153). Where the law requires the object to be returned or given to the lost and found or police there may be a requirement of dina d'malchuta (Rema CM 259:7 and 356:7 but see Shach 356:10; Ketzot 259:3).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This question is good,  first,  if you look carefully the Rashi, you will realize that the person in question does not accept to distinguish between Samaritan and Jew concerning  the Mitsva  to return. So,  if he returned the Samaritan's lost  by extra duty (in a duty free way) there is  no  problem.</p>\n<p>The words of Rashi are :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.76b.2?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Sanhedrin.76b.2.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">והמחזיר אבידה לכותי</a> - השווה וחבר כותי לישראל ומראה בעצמו שהשבת אבדה אינה חשובה לו מצות בוראו שאף לכותי הוא עושה כן שלא נצטווה עליהם:‏</p>\n<p>He decided to make an equivalency and a bound between Samaritan and Israeli.  He clearly shows that he refuses to consider  \"Hashavat Aveda\" as his  creator's order.  He demonstrates this when he returns the lost of the Samaritan while he has no \"Toraic\" obligation to return them.</p>\n<p><code>Not required I hear, but forbidden?!</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=89058&rid=12006\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (see  Kessef Mishne for sources) said  clearly that if by performing Hashavat Aveda to the Samaritan  you will make a kiddush Hashem and avoid a chilul  Hashem, then these would be reasons to  return it. The reason for the early prohibition is that  Tora doesn't regard the money of a gentile as dedicated to a good thing regarding avodat Hashem.  They are not fascinated by avodat Hashem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Not required I hear, but forbidden?!</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here you mean he is exempt from duty, and is forced to stop the instinctual act of returning.  Because the  mitzvah of hashavat aveda has a rationale beyond simply returning everything to the owner. The general rationale is to help him to continue to serve his  master (Hashem).</p>\n<p>We learn this from our Gemara:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמחזיר אבידה לכותי עליו הכתוב אומר (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.29.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דברים כט, יח</a>) למען ספות הרוה את הצמאה לא יאבה ה' סלוח לו</p>\n<p>One who returns a lost to  a Samaritan,  Tora says about him \"to add drunkenness to thirst\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.76b.2?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Sanhedrin.76b.2.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רוה</a> - עובדי כוכבים ששבעים ואינן צמאין ליוצרם צמאה זו כנסת ישראל שצמאה ותאיבה ליראת יוצרה ולקיים מצותיו: ‏</p>\n<p>Idolaters have more than enough of their creator.  Jewish people is called thirsty,  because it is thirsty and willing.   Id est to maintain a relationship with Hashem,  based on fear,  and to obey his  orders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The act is the same than the act of mitsva but the spiritual background is not the same.</p>\n\n\n",

Replacing it with \"rishon\" would imply that the tribe who starts is part of a chronological progression in which the next tribe to battle is called \"second\" and all the other tribes wait until they fight as well, then the \"third\" tribe gets to attack etc. It would describe a parade.</p>\n\n<p>However, Shoftim 1:1 simply has Judah attack first. The rest of the tribes then proceed in no particular chronological parade order into the land. They may or may not have been simultaneous. So there was no order of tribes as a group divided into place units. Therefore, a simple \"techila\" is a better choice of wording here.</p>\n\n<p>In Genesis 1:1, the technical translation (see Rashi) is \"In the beginning (1st stage) <strong>of</strong> (\"Bereishis\") G-d's creating of the heavens and the earth..\"</p>\n\n<p>Replacing this with \"At the start of (\"B'techilas\")G-d's creating of the heavens and the earth...\" would technically fit. However, G-d is teaching that his creation plan is a set of orderly days in which each day is assigned its chronologically dependent content. Therefore the word that means \"first\" (\"In the first stages of G-d's creating of the heavens and the earth..\") is a better choice of wording here. You will notice that this is true, since each day is called \"first second third...etc.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi (due to grammatical concerns (preposition \"of\" not fitting well)) offers a second pshat (explanation) based on a Medrashic hint.</p>\n\n<p>\"B'reishis\" -- \"For (the sake of) the \"Beginning\", (that's why) G-d created the heavens and the earth.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now the sentence reads better gramatically. The Medrash points out verses in Proverbs and Jeremiah which refer to the Torah and Jews as \"reishis\" or \"firsts\". The Torah is the first of G-d's path and the Jews are the first of G-d's crop. Here the Medrash views the meaning of \"reishis\" as \"head\" or \"chief\".</p>\n\n<p>\"For the sake of the Torah and the Jews \"B'reishis\" G-d created the heavens and the earth.\"</p>\n\n<p>If G-d did not use \"reishis\" instead of \"techilas\", then the verse would not be a link to the other two verses that also use \"reishis\", when describing the Torah and Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

I f the problem is the need of minyan,  and by modesty it's not recommended for a woman to talk in front of a male audience, so she can bless alone.  The best is to bless before a female audience containing one man (one of the 10 need to be a man) . Magen Avraham said that the reason that they don't bless it is because this kind of blessing are not really a duty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>so I am asking if women in fact bentch gomel less often than men</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>--></strong> Yes,  the Knesset Hagdola made the same observation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>and if so why?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>--></strong>  First Teruts: because of modesty they bless it without minyan; second  Teruts: they bless before an audience with a majority of women,  third teruts: the Ykar hadin is that blessing of this type are not a duty,  and they don't bless at all.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The mention of a minyan is from the Gemara itself Berachot 54b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abaye said: And he must utter his thanksgiving in the presence of ten, as it is written: Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people.\nMar Zutra said: And two of them must be rabbis, as it says, And praise Him in the seat of the elders.\nR`Ashi demurred to this: You might as well say [he remarked], that all should be rabbis! - Is it written, 'In the assembly of elders'?\nIt is written, 'In the assembly of the people'! - Let us say then, in the presence of ten ordinary people and two rabbis [in addition]? - This is a difficulty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@Double AA noted tha even t if the answer is the above,  women don't know it generally, this is a Kashia for him.   Right but I think that poskim searched to understand the minhag that women don't say Hagomel.

    "title": "Reconciling Young Earth Creationism With Racial Diversity",
    "content": "# Reconciling Young Earth Creationism With Racial Diversity\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm wondering whether the Young Earth Creationism can be reconciled with the racial diversity found on the globe. How, can a young Earth accomedate, in a manner consistent with science, Noah's descendants going from being whatever race they were, (presumably of middle eastern appearance) and becoming of Chinese, Japanese Vietnamese & similar. Can environmental factors really account for such changes in such a short span of time? Would people of disparate races really return to the original race just from returning to its environment?\nDoes this Creationist belief claim that all humans descend from the land of Israel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First, Young Earth Creationism is a position officially invented and held by Christian Bible believers. However, it is true that many Jews do believe (based on Torah and tradition) in some form of limited history for the Earth. For instance, the Jewish calendar is now 5777 years since Creation (Anno Mundi).</p>\n\n<p>But, many Jews will say that 5777 are the years since Adam was created, not since the world was created. Therefore, if you follow the interpretation that the 6 days of Genesis are not literal 24 hour periods, but rather epochs/stages called \"days\" then YEC is not needed for anything pre-Adam.</p>\n\n<p>There are two approaches to your question (assuming we wish to examine a defense for YEC as applied to racial diversity presented in the OP):</p>\n\n<p>1) The flood was a local Mesopotamian event (not covering the literal globe). The \"whole Earth\" of the flood was the portion of the planet that was populated by the evil descendants of Adam (except the righteous Noach etc.) Also, Adam may have been the first real full \"man\" with an intellectual soul. However, the species of man may have already existed earlier on the 6th day without a full human intellectual soul. Therefore, there were many more humans populating the world besides the \"Adam's family\".</p>\n\n<p>For the former to be true, consider that the Talmud and Medrash explain that the dove sent by Noach found the olive branch in the land of Israel, because the flood did not reach there. Similarly, the sage Rabbi Yochanan says that Og escaped the flood by entering (the land that would become) Israel. There are other possible proofs to a local (or incomplete) flood.</p>\n\n<p>For the latter idea to be true, consider Genesis 4:17 which tells us that Cain built a city. This guy was a farmer turned real estate developer? Cool. But <strong>who</strong> was he building condos for? He lived far away from his parents in eastern Nod and he killed his brother...is there anyone else left to sell the units to? :) There are more possible proofs that the \"Adam's family\" were unique among a larger human population around them.</p>\n\n<p>These ideas in interpreting the Biblical narrative, would allow for the biological diversity and development noticed by scientists, who claim the races of mankind needed about 30,000 years, and a larger population, to develop.</p>\n\n<p>2) The other approach is that the science of the human genome and racial anthropology etc. is a very new branch of research. It is constantly correcting itself and making new discoveries. No one knows if they can trace with accuracy, the exact number of years it would take for certain genes to change in the population.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, G-d may have simply diversified Noah's three sons and increased their offspring supernaturally to make up for the flood and to provide faster racial diversity. </p>\n\n<p>The Biblical account is primarily a spiritual teaching clothed in our reality. It may mention worldly events or scientific truths in passing, but it is not meant to be a historical or scientific textbook. So, it doesn't stop and explain itself like a manual. That doesn't mean it is a contradiction to anything.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is interesting to note that \"science\" does say that humanity can be divided among three major races - Asian, sub Saharan African, and India/European. Many have pointed out the interesting correlation to Noah's three sons Shem (Middle East - Asia), Ham (Africa), and Yapheth (Indo-Euro). </p>\n\n<p>Also, the origins of the Indian and European language connection was not known until the study of Sanskrit by Sir William Jones in 1786. He proved that the Europeans and Indians were descended from the same common people who spoke PIE (proto-Indo-European). Finally, in the 1980's Colin Renfrew, professor of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, revealed that the best evidence suggests that the original speaker of PIE lived in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>If the mountains of Ararat (mentioned as the landing spot of the ark in Genesis) are in Turkey (as many believe) then your last question is also answered.</p>\n\n<p>\"All humans\" (Noah's descendents) descend from the land of Turkey. :)</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps</p>\n\n\n",

Being as young children often have the Din of a Choleh (See Orach Chaim 328:17 for example) would someone taking care of their young children be Patur from Sukkah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are two  comparisons they need to be examined:<br>\n1. between bitul asse deorayta and shvut deshabbat  (davka shvut de amira lenochri),<br>\n2. between cooking meal and taking care of an ill person. In conclusion, the first comparison is hard to decide, but the second comparison is not credible.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim siman 640 sayif 3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש מי שאומר שאין המשמשים פטורים אלא בשעה שהחולה צריך להם. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Some poskim says that caretakers  are exempt  <strong>only at the time in which the ill person needs their help</strong>  (not  24/7). (Mishna Berura restricted this stringency for who is nursing a <strong>Non life threatened patient.</strong>  ).  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The leniency is a bitul mitsvat asse <strong>deorayta by  shev veal taasse.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thus concerning Succa a sick person in life threatening state and his  caretaker have the same status of entire ptor.  <strong>But a sick person in non life threatening state and his caretaker are not equivalents.  The sick person is entirely patur but the caretaker is partially patur.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 328, 17 RMA (see Bet Yosef at the end of the siman<sup>(1)</sup>) in name of Rabenu Yerucham <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11651&st=&pgnum=159&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">netiv 12, Chelek 9</a>,  Ramban and Rashba stated that <strong>to cook a meal for toddlers is equivalent to care of a non life threatening illness patient and we can ask a non-Jew to make it</strong> .

From the din of Rabenu Yerucham concerning cooking meals for children, we cannot learn that cooking meals generate a ptur from succa.</h3>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>(1)</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתב ר\"י בח\"ט ני\"ב שהרמב\"ם מתיר בישולי א\"י לחולה שאין בו סכנה והרשב\"א עשה לו סמוכות והעלה בידו דאיסור בישולי א\"י שהוא איסור קל משום שמא יבא לאכול עמו הותר בחולה שאין בו סכנה בשבת עכ\"ל ומ\"ש בשם הרמב\"ם הוא ממה שכתב בפ\"כ חולה שאין בו סכנה עושין לו כל צרכיו ע\"י א\"י כיצד אומרים לא\"י לעשות לו והוא עושה לבשל לו ולאפו' וכו' </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The quote of the Bet Yosef doesn't contain an explicit mention to a child who has no food, as it seems from the words of the RMA. </p>\n\n<p>Would the Gemara say this? </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Does the din by Shabbos that children and their needs being considered to be like sick people (that allows some kulos in regards to Shabbos) then turn into a patur from Sukkah?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--></strong>  no there is no link between food processing and nursing. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Where does the din of children being like sick people come from?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--></strong> From Rabenu Yerucham,  since this is not explicitly said. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I finally found an answer inside. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=46442#p=316&fitMode=fitheight&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nitei Gavriel</a> writes that if one is needed to take care of their child outside the Sukkkah then they are indeed Patur.</p>\n\n<p>(I asked this question to Rabbi Rudinsky about two years ago (shortly after posting the question here as a curiosity) and he said I was still Chayav in Sukkah but I no longer remember all the specifics. It could be that if there was no other choice but for me (and not my wife or anyone else) to watch my young children outside of the Sukkah he would agree I'd be Patur.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hataf-patah instead of sh'va na‘ in Sephardic and Ashkenazic tikkunim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my Yeshiva, we have Sephardic tikkunim called ״איש מצליח״—basically the Sephardic equivalent of סימנים.</p>\n<p>I own an Ashkenazi tikkun (not סימנים). In my tikkun, sometimes a Chataf-Patach will appear under letters other than אהח״ע, usually in a word from the root ברך, or in the case of double letters such as ויכנֲנך and יסבֲבנהו. However, in Artscroll Ashkenazi siddurim, these words always appear with a Sh'va instead.</p>\n<p>In the Sephardic tikkun, they appear with a Sh'va, with a footnote at the bottom saying, for example, ״וַיְכֹ<strong>נֲ</strong>נֶךָּ למנהגנו, וכ״ה בקורן״ (“According to our custom, and it's also like that in the Koren [Tanakh]”). Sometimes it will leave out that last part because Koren has it with a Sh'va and not a Chataf-Patach.</p>\n<p>My question is as follows: When should I, an Ashkenazi, pronounce it with a Chataf-Patach, and when should I pronounce it with a Sh'va Na‘? I don't bring my Askenazi tikkun to Yeshiva, and it's not the most accurate Tikkun anyway. My brother's Ashenazi tikkun and the Siddurim always have Sh'va Na‘.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have the תקוּן <em>איש מצליח</em> as well. In the introduction, it is stated that inserting a chataf-Patach in those positions is the Minhag of the author’s community, based on the Aleppo Codex. (Variants of this custom were adopted by some other communities, but it’s not a widespread phenomenon. Most Sephardim don’t follow it).</p>\n<p>That Minhag is misinformed. The Aleppo Codex does indeed use chataf-Patach more often than most other Masoretic Codices. However, in the Tiberian Masoretic tradition, Shva Naʿ and chataf-Patach were pronounced identically. The Aleppo Codex simply uses Chataf-Patach to indicate that the Shva isn’t silent in those positions. Its author never meant to indicate that a <em>different</em> vowel should be there instead.<br />\nNowadays, most of us pronounce Shva Naʿ differently from chataf-Patach, so it doesn’t make sense for us to pronounce these vowels as a chataf-Patach.</p>\n<p>So you have two reasons to ignore it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your community never accepted the Minhag described in the first paragraph.</li>\n<li>Nowadays, we don’t pronounce Shva Naʿ like a chataf-Patach. The intent of the Aleppo Codex was just to indicate that the vowel on those letters wasn’t a silent Shva; basically the ancient, handwritten version of printing Shva Naʿ in bold.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Quite simply, if there is a chataf-vowel under a non-guttural letter (i.e. not אהחע) then you can just pronounce it as a shwa na'. This is because chataf-vowels were originally added in order not to lose the sound of the pronounced shwa' on a guttural, something that can be hard to pronounce.</p>\n<p>The truth is that most Sephardim pronounce it with the additional chataf-vowel but the איש מצליח Tikkun is different. (In the grammatical introduction it says that they are generally added in relation to food or in some other contexts but I don't quite understand that myself...)</p>\n<p>Simanim have also made a Tikkun Kora'im for Sephardim which just shows shwa na' unless for a guttural.</p>\n<p>With practice you can get used to which words need it (א/ה/ח/ע) and which don't (any other letter). If in doubt, you can check any \"chataf\"s in another sefer (e.g. a reliable chumash) and don't pronounce it unless <em>both</em> sefarim print it that way.</p>\n<p>Either way, it is not serious to pronounce it with or without the help of the half- vowel like chataf-patach, just as long as you are consistent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In old Ashkenazi sidurim, ּבָּרֲכו is written with a chataf patach under the resh and in  German Kehillos, they would pronounce the chataf. Baer in <em>Seder Avodas Yisroel</em> states that by tradition, the root ברך always has a chataf. Same in Rödelheim Chumash, all ברך have Chataf. Modern Chumashim and Sidurim switched to the regular sheva, perhaps following other traditions.</p>\n\n\n",

So when the <em>midos</em> compilers examined <strong>those</strong> <em>halachos</em>, they didn't need to work too hard to reverse-engineer and figure out where they come from: they knew immediately the <em>halachos</em> come from <em>g'zera shava</em>, and added it to the list.</p>\n\n<p>So <em>g'zera shava</em> was the easiest item to add to the list.

It occurred to me recently (following the death of Leonard Cohen), that the Name is incorporated into various other words, as in “Hallelujah”. (That transliterated word is what appears in the NJPS translation of Psalm 150.) Then of course there are biblical names that incorporate the Tetragrammaton either in part or in whole (Elijah, Isaiah, Jehoshaphat, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>The question is, do these Tetragrammaton-incorporating names receive any special treatment in Jewish tradition? Has there been any reflection on the significance of the Tetragrammaton appearing in these names?</p>\n\n<p>(“Has there been any reflection?”—from previous experience in this site, I know that this must all have been worked out thousands of years ago; I just don't know where to look for the answer.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I have found an article on the following website that may answer your question.

Is there priority if one person is mourning for a parent vs. the other mourning for a spouse or sibling?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<h1><strong>Rule #1: Don't fight about it.</strong></h1>\n\n<p>First, one should never get into fights with others to do Mitzvot (Mishna Berura 53 sk 65). Regarding our case, the Chatam Sofer (YD 345) writes that if you deserve a certain spot and someone else takes it, he hasn't gained anything and you haven't lost anything (ie. you get the \"credit\" anyway). Plus fighting another Jew seemingly outweighs any benefit you can think to get from being Chazzan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> Like every Chazzan, the mourner needs to be qualified to lead the service (be able to read the words, etc.) (Mishna Berura 53 sk 60). Moreover, if the congregation wants a specific person to lead them (eg. he has a nicer voice), he has precedence over any mourner and any rule below (ShA OC 53:20).</p>\n\n<p>After that, the main if not only rule is to <strong>follow the custom of the community</strong> since these matters are not formal law (Arukh haShulchan YD 376:16). It seems like a good idea for a community to formalize a policy so as to avoid any fighting.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Various customs have been recorded and they can be used as a starting point if there is no other custom. Unless otherwise noted, what follows is from the set recorded in Beiur Halakha 132.</p>\n\n<p>A mourner can fall in one of five time-periods, listed in decreasing order of precedence: Shiva, Sheloshim, Yahrtzeit, last day of the 11 months, rest of the 11 months. (Some place Yahrtzeit before Sheloshim, see Arukh haShulchan ibid.) For these purposes Shiva and Sheloshim are the full 7 and 30 days, independent of partial final days or interruptions from Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple mourners on the same level split everything and can draw lots to see who goes first.</p>\n\n<p>If someone is a guest (Oreiach) in a Shul they have weaker rights than a regular member (Toshav). Thus, a Toshav who is in the same period as an Oreiach gets precedence, but the Oreiach gets to lead once during his visit (except in the case of Shiva when they split evenly, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/23248/759\">seemingly even in a Shiva house itself</a>). If they are in different periods, the Oreiach has rights equal to one level below what he would have at home (except if the Oreiach has a Yahrtzeit when he has no rights since he should have planned his calendar better). An Oreiach's \"last day\" is just like any other day in the 11 months. If there are two Orechim on the same level and one of them is mourning a deceased relative who was a Toshav, he gets precedence.</p>\n\n<p>A son mourning a parent has precedence over someone mourning any other relative. Some say this is when the son is in Shiva or Sheloshim, but if he is in the rest of the year, they have precedence if they are in Shiva or have Yahrtzeit (Gesher HaChayim 30:10:7). If the deceased had no living sons and a different relative is substituting, some say a grandson gets precedence over a son-in-law who gets precedence over anyone else (Sedei Chemed, Avelut 158).</p>\n\n<p>Two brothers mourning for the same parent each have full rights against a third person mourning his parent, ie. they split everything three ways (Rama YD 376:4).</p>\n\n<p>Some say that in determining who goes first when splitting, a Kohein has precedence over a Levi and a Levi over a Yisrael (Peri Megadim EA 53:14).</p>\n\n\n",

This is \"assur\" (English: not permitted).  That is why we say the \"Kaddish\" prayer as a start.  The \"Kaddish\" celebrates the eternal life of the soul (i.e. the spirit).  One must by strict Jewish Law bury the dead with a funeral within 24 hours after the death of that individual.  All the belongings of that person must be taken out of your home, for one example only. The \"Kaddish\" never once mentions death.  It is a praise of life itself and of G-d.  So, it seems that the dead are not physically part of the world of the living.  Is this because the soul never dies, but the body dies? Perhaps that is the true meaning of the \"Kaddish\".</p>\n\n\n",

There must be a ton of them, but it's surprisingly impossible to find a listing online.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I just called Washington Heights Keilim mikvah. Located on Bennet Ave. between W. 185 St and W. 186 St. Manhattan. </p>\n\n<p>Phone: 212 923 3582</p>\n\n<p>The woman told me that the entrance is to the right of the shul. There is a black gate. The gate requires a code which is written in Hebrew on the gate (Thanks Monica, for confirming this), with the Hebrew letters conveying their numerical value corresponding to the code (Aleph = 1, etc.) After entering the gate, there is a passageway then steps going down to the keilim mikvah. The code to the mikvah door is the same as for the gate. It is a \"manual\" punch lock (not electronic). She also explained that the mikvah is open 24-hours / day. You may want to call yourself to verify the exact instructions. I tried viewing the place on Google Earth, and I'm not sure what gate she is referring to. </p>\n\n<p>I will advise that parking in the area is almost impossible, so, if you go, I advise having one person sitting in the car while you and your keilim are in the mikvah area. (I used to live near that area, and occasionally visit.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another keilim Mikvah that is open 24 hours and may be closer to you is the </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mikvahminder.com/details/mikvah-of-far-rockaway.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Far Rockaway Mikvah</a></p>\n\n<p>1121 Sage Street</p>\n\n<p>Phone: 718 327 9727</p>\n\n<p>Sage St. is one way going from Central Ave. and ending at Empire Blvd. As soon as the street narrows and curves to the left, you will see a narrow driveway on your <strong>right</strong>. Look carefully for it, as it can be easy to miss, and going around the block is not that simple! Going up the driveway, you will see an agudah (has Hebrew on the front of the building) and the mikvah is the next shorter building after the agudah on your right. The keilim mikvah is the 1st door on the right when you face the building. I was there recently, and the door to the keilim mikvah was left open, and no one was there. They left a dipping basket in the mikvah. You can park your car right next to the door! They ask that you not leave boxes (I assume from newly opened flatware, etc.) in their dumpsters, but take all boxes & garbage with you.</p>\n\n<p>The person said that the place is open 24 hours and there is a Hebrew code on the door to operate a manual push button lock. Though, she says the door is usually slightly open and you just have to turn the handle on top of the door and push it open. (They place the handle on top so that little kids don't easily get in.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I saw a poster in a neighborhood store mentioning a keilim service where someone will pick up the keilim from you, toveil them and deliver them back to you, for a fee, of course.</p>\n\n<p>The number is <strong>516 341 2077</strong> or email <strong>tvilatkeilim@gmail.com</strong>. The top of the poster says \"servicing the 5 Towns and Far Rockaway\", so if you live outside that area, they may not do it. However, it can't hurt to call or email them and inquire. Perhaps, there is a similar service that will pick up from you.</p>\n\n\n",

These include the Mahzor Vitry (145) which emanates from Rashi's circles (11th cent.), Ra'avyah (Teshuvot Ubeiurei Sugyot 969) which dates from mid-12th century Germany, Sefer HaRokeah (Hilkhot Yom HaKippurim 218), which dates from late 12th century Germany, and multiple 13th-14th century works such as the Aggudah, and the Tashbets Kattan. It also appears in Tosafot to Megillah 4a (s.v. pasaq v'amar).</p>\n\n<p>The fact that both the Mahzor Vitry in France, and Raavyah, in Germany use term, makes me suspect that the term precedes them, and perhaps goes back to the beginning of the Ashkenazi culture.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted, however, that some of these works may have been textually corrupted by later Ashkenazim, so the aforementioned survey isn't foolproof.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, we also find rather early Ashkenazi works using the Talmudic term, such as Sefer HaOrah (1:16) and Mahzor Vitry (1) which are both products of Rashi's school, and Raavan (140) of early 11th century Germany.</p>\n\n<p>By the 14th century, we find Sephardi sources using the term, such as the Mnorat HaMaor (Kadmon).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It should be noted, that even if there is some significance to the change, that R. Mazuz S\"T has noted that Rishonim were not particular with grammatical correctness, often referring, for example to the tallit g'dolah, as a tallit gadol. Accordingly, it seems very likely to me, that the Geonim and Sephardim mostly maintained the Talmudic term, while Ashkenazim often used their own very old term, and this was probably not a conscious point on the part of the Ashkenazim, and certainly not on the part of the Sephardim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Regarding your question about the difference in meaning between the words, Rabbi Berel Wein writes (<em>Living Jewish: Values, Practices and Traditions</em>) that both words are indeed derived from <em>erev</em>/evening; <em>Maariv</em> is the verb meaning \"bringing on night\" (and the service is so named because of this word appearing in the first blessing), while <em>Arvit</em> is an adjective form, roughly translated as \"of the evening\".</p>\n\n\n",

We bake bread whenever.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is a mistake in your lecture of Rashi, the \"cakes\" are bread, ugot refers to  the shape form. Later rashi writes that they eat butter, milk and meat but the bread (& / the cakes) is not mentioned. Why? Because she became Nidda, and the dough became unclean.\nThey were stringent to eat \"Chulin Betahara\" according to Rashi. This is not a strict obligation from Halachic point of view. Nowadays, we have problem with dead uncleaness, or Tum'at Erets Haamim, we cannot be clean.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>About the \"Make cakes\".<br>\n1. The verse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַֽעֲשִׂ֥י עֻגֽוֹת: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the word is Ugot.<br>\n2. The translation of Onkelos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְעִבִידִי גְּרִיצָן:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the aramic translation is \"Gritzin\".<br>\n3. We found Gritzin in Mishna (Betsa 2, 6):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאֵין זוֹקְפִין אֶת הַמְּנוֹרָה בְיוֹם טוֹב, וְאֵין אוֹפִין פִּתִּין גְּרִיצִין אֶלָּא רְקִיקִין. אָמַר רַבָּן גַּמְלִיאֵל, מִימֵיהֶן שֶׁל בֵּית אַבָּא לֹא הָיוּ אוֹפִין פִּתִּין גְּרִיצִין, אֶלָּא רְקִיקִין.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Rabban Gamliel, to bake a great quantity of dough is prohibited on Yom Tov because of the great effort needed. This great quantity (גריצין gritzin) of dough (Pat, pitin). Rashi says that Pitin Gritzin are thick loaf of bread, Tosfot Betsa 22b says large loaf of bread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the translation \"Ugot\" =\"gritzin\" =  \"cake\" may be a consequence of the expression Ugot nowadays in modern Hebrew and doesn't come from the traditional lecture of the verse.</p>\n\n\n",

He explains that Abraham was told the directions starting with the north in order to acknowledge the merit of Abraham's korbanos, which are to be slaughtered in the north (of the Temple courtyard?). Yaakov was told about the west first, in order to let him know that in his merit the sea would split for his descendants. A remez is brought to prove this. The verse says \"And Israel saw the mighty hand...\" by the splitting of the sea etc. The Baal HaTurim explain the word Israel to refer to Yaakov himself. Later, by Gen. 28:14, The Baal HaTurim continues this explanation by showing that the gematria of \"U'faratzta yama\" is the same as \"krias yam\".</p>\n\n<p>2) </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Kli Yakar</strong> on Gen. 28:14, explains that it is Yaakov's sequence which is out of order. This is done to provide a remez to reassure Yaakov about the future tribulations of Klal Yisroel. West is the setting sun. This shows that the Jewish people may endure a crushing lowering of status. However, this will bring them to fully trust in Hashem, only; through humility. This will lead to their salvation which will turn the situation East; which is the strength of the new sun dawning. So, even if the Jews will be enduring darkness and a reduced state (represented by the North), they will eventually dwell in great heights. (Dar - Rom) The word South is seen here as a combination of two words \"dwell - high\". The descendants of Yaakov will eventually be elevated throughout the world. See there at length.</p>\n\n<p>3)</p>\n\n<p>I have been inspired to receive my own vort for you. I hope you like it.</p>\n\n<p>In Gen. 13:14, the exact order of the compass directions, seem to be given to Abraham midah k'neged midah. This measure for measure choice of wording would have the effect of providing approval for Abraham after he just passed another test by sending Lot away.</p>\n\n<p>When Lot was told to please choose a direction, the Torah tells us that he \"lifted up his eyes\" and saw Soddom. Now if a man lifts up his eyes and sees a place, it must mean that he was facing it to begin with. Therefore, Abraham and Lot were standing facing Soddom (East). Abraham then offered Lot use of a portion of the land he himself was promised, for the sake of peace. First he offered the \"Left\" and then the \"Right\" as an alternative. So, he first offers Lot the North, then South. Lot however picks East. Abraham accepts giving up the East. The West was not involved.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore the Torah uses the specific wording that Abraham should also \"lift up his eyes\" (as Lot did) \"from the place in which he was\" (referring to that same vantage point where he offered the choice to Lot) and look North, then South, then East, then West (in the same order he offered pieces to Lot). He was then told all of the promised land would be his anyway. This was a heavenly acknowledgement that he had passed the test and handled Lot correctly.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham's intent, was that Lot either pick the North or South of Eretz Yisrael. This is because the Land would keep Lot connected to Hashem because he would constantly need to pray for rain. However, Lot chose straight ahead, since Soddom was like a watered garden (like Egypt) which did not need rain. (see Devarim 11: 10-12)</p>\n\n<p>Yaakov however was about to leave the Holy Land, and was worried about returning intact. Therefore, Hashem wanted to reassure him by starting off with the West. Yakov was heading to the land of the East. So, in order to return, he would need to go West. So too, in any future exile, (Yaakov was shown the 4 exiles at this point) his children were first promised to spread out West which would represent a return to the place of the Shechinah's dwelling, (the Temple in the land of Israel) which is always in the West. </p>\n\n<p>Antoninus asked Rebbi: \"Why does the sun rise in the east and set in the west?\"</p>\n\n<p>Rebbi: \"If it were the opposite you would ask the same thing!\"</p>\n\n<p>Ant.: No, I mean why doesn't it just circle back to where it began. Why does it set?\"</p>\n\n<p>Rebbi: \"In order to give \"Shalom\"(bow in obedience) to its Creator.\"</p>\n\n<p>You see from here that the Shechinah (Divine Presence) is in the west. (see Sanhedrin 91b with meforshim.)</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I had the same question! Let me add my 5 cents to it.</p>\n<p>Mekubbalim interpret the phrase הלוך ונסוע הנגבה as a reference to the middah of chesed which is the middah of Avraham Avinu (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27arei_Orah%2C_Introduction.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Orah</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Lech_Lecha.10.72?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a>).</p>\n<p>We usually assume that the general main direction is East, probably based on the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.2.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">degalim</a>. If so, then south corresponds to right which is chesed, and north is left, that is din.</p>\n<p>North and south is a bit less obvious but still could work out nicely according to this pattern.</p>\n<p>So, when Avraham is told about the greatness of his descendants, then it starts by North (Gevurah / Din) which corresponds to his main descendant, Yitzchak. Similarly, by Yaakov it starts by west, which is downwards from Tiferet (which is the center), that can be Yesod. This it the middah of the Tzaddik, Yosef (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.2?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">כל מה שאירע ליעקב אירע ליוסף</a>).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, there is a third instance where the Torah mentions all four cardinal directions in a single pasuk (Deuteronomy 3:27), when the land is shown to Moshe Rabbeinu. There too it starts by West (Yesod).</p>\n<p>My theory is that it is because there are two types of influences of a tzaddik. One is through his descendants and the other is through disciples. By Avraham it was through his descendants. But Yosef's descendants are probably mostly lost amongst the 10 tribes, but still we read and are inspired by his stories. Similarly, we don't know much about Moshe's descendants. So they are more influential through their disciples.</p>\n\n\n",

The Medrash explains: What did it see? It saw Yosef's coffin. Just as Yosef ran away from Potiphar's wife, so too, the Sea split\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mekhilta_DeRabbi_Yishmael%2C_Tractate_Vayehi_Beshalach.4.19?lang=he&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechilta D’Rabbi Yishmael 14:15</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.87.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 87:8</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.114.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehillim 114</a>).</p>\n<p>The Maharal asks the question slightly different: Why did sea go against its natural order and by splitting?

There were exceptions of course like Birchas Hamazon and Birchas Hatorah, but even when fulfilling a mitzvah in the Torah, a blessing was generally not said.</p>\n\n<p>My question is concerning the nature of a prophet fulfilling the direct command from Hashem. Would that action get a bracha? Such as Yechezkel writing on the sticks and bringing them together, as found in chapter 37 of his book. Or Hoshea marrying a zona as in chapter 1 of his. Or perhaps only actions for the general population get brachos.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, as mentioned, these two time periods did not overlap much, if at all. But if they did, did those prophets make brachos? </p>\n\n<p>Besides my curiosity, there might be a practical application for this. Moshiach will come. He will be a prophet and he will fulfill Hashem's commandments. There is no reason to assume the institution of blessings will be abolished. So will he be making blessings on his fulfillments of Hashem's prophetic commands?</p>\n\n\n",

And this brings one to believe in the creation ex-nihilo\n  (something from nothing), which is similar to the revival of the dead.\n  And in the beginning, G-d's thought was to make man head of all\n  creation. But with the sin (of Adam), it says 'you will surely die',\n  and he fell from his lofty level. But the 'thought of G-d will forever\n  endure'. Therefore, in the resurrection of the dead, man will return\n  to his level and will be head to all the angels on high, as it is\n  written \"at that time, they (the angels) will say to Yaakov and to\n  Yisrael, what did G-d do\".

In the last chapter of Masechet Nidda we have a Mishna,  two Beraytot and a Gemara which address the issue. </p>\n\n<p>Let us take the case of a woman who is Nidda (to simplify She has menses).  The verse establishad that she is unclean for 7 days. At evening,  after the end of the 7th day,  she already can go to mikve and become clean. </p>\n\n<p>After \"the 7 days of nidda\" start \"11 days of ziva\". In ziva days, an other kind of uncleaness may appear. (Ziva is an other kind of uncleanness which characterises extra menstrual bleeding.) </p>\n\n<p>The period of nidda days is a period of time in which potentially bleeding is normally, may be expected. </p>\n\n<p>But the bleeding may interrupted before.  When we are sure that the menstruation is finished,  there is no a great risk for intermenstrual bleeding, even if the nidda days are not yet completed (how true is this is discussed by Tanaym). </p>\n\n<p>Case: A woman had a menstruation which ended,  and she  toveled leil shmini (biblical hilchot  nidda which don't need sfirat 7 nekiim).  After  a couple of days  she had a new uterine hemorrhage. We have to know for several reasons, the status of the days in the interval between the end of the first bleeding and the starting of the second bleeding. </p>\n\n<p>To do this we use an halachic principle called  chazaka.  When we are sure that the first bleeding interrupted we say that she is  bechezkat mesuleket damim,   the hemorrhage is remote. </p>\n\n<p>We found <strong>four opinions,</strong> three in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%99_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna</a> and a last in Berayta, concerning  how to ensure that she is not bleeding further by short intervals. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Tana Kama,  </li>\n<li>Rabbi Yehuda </li>\n<li>and Rabanan. </li>\n<li>A fourth opinion which does not appear in Mishna is cited in Berayta,  which Rashba ruled in Halacha and called it \"ziknute Derabbi\".

In such a day  we cannot state rule a Chazaka  of Mesuleket Damim before a further observation that the hemorrhage has stopped. Such a day is called in Gemara a day in which her <strong>\"source\"</strong>  was <strong>opened.</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>I've seen that the reason for a moch dachuk is to make sure there was no further blood flow from the time when the hefsek tahara bedika was done until nightfall.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--> Yes a Tana in Berayta, this view is a further layer in the stringent reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Explanation:</em></p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda is the most stringent.

The lenient opinion (ziknute deRabbi) is the opinion of <strong>Rashba</strong> (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%91%22%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%A9%22%D7%A1/%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%94/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chiddushim 68b</a>, and <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9381&st=&pgnum=387&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat Habait</a>), which allow to make hefsek with bdika of the first day on morning. The intermediate  stringency (Rababan in Mishna) from Ikar Hadin point of view is the <strong>Rambam,</strong>  which give Chezkat mesuleket danim with a bdika of 2nd day in morning. The <strong>RAH</strong> also ruled as Rabanan; there is no hefsek at the first day in morning, for the first day we need a clean bdika in afternoon. May be that for RAH each bleeding day has a din of \"first day\". </p>\n\n<p>This last issue, comparison between a day with bleeding and the first day according to Rabanan in Mishna is discussed by Rashba in Torat Habayt Hakatsar:</p>\n\n<h3>First mention in Rishonim</h3>\n\n<p>Rashba in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9381&st=&pgnum=387&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat Habayt Hakkatsar</a>,  in the fifth Shaar,  Dine Habedika Vehasefira.  He told about a day which was known as with oponed source and added an advice. To be stringent for each hefsek Tahara as if there was an opened source and to watch all the ben hashmashot with a moch dachuk. This,  despite that Rashba himself is the most lenient Meykar hadin.  Meykar Hadin according to Rashba, if she observed a stopping of the bleeding at first day morning.  She is already mesuleket damim. The Chavat Daat presented bellow addresses this with reference to a Berayta.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[*]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>but it won't matter anyway because the count will have to be restarted. So what's the point of the moch dachuk then?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--></strong>  To start 7 nekiim we need to know that she is mesuleket damim at the beginning of the count. If the day before (the day of hefsek Tahara) was  known as bleeding,  this day  has a problem of Opened Source (it is a risk day until its end) until a proof of siluk damim. If the woman made two bdikot in the morning, the first bdika was bloody and the second bdika was not bloody, it seems from the words of Tosfot that this is not sufficient to make a Chezkat mesuleket damim. Tosfot needs that the second bdika may not be before afternoon (מן המנחה ולמעלה). The Chavat Daat understood that the bdika needs to continue until the end of ben Hashmashot time (he takes the svsrat hamakshan from the Berayta, who add a layer to the Chashash of rabbi Yehuda (for morning), for a bleeding day regarding the second bdika) , i.e. a moch Dachuk. But Rishonim did not agree here with this rule. Rashba itself said that a bdika of non-bleeding in the first morning is a good hefsek. Rambam needs afternoon, no more. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5611\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chavat Daat</a> at the first paragraph of siman 196</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# I recently found out I have Jewish ancestry. I want to learn more about Judaism, but what is appropriate?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently found out I have Jewish ancestry through a DNA test (Ashkenazi; it helped to explain why I got bowel cancer at a young age since the risk is high in that group). Apparently my grandmother knew, but didn't tell my father. Previous to this, all my Jewish ancestors were open about their faith. My father and his siblings were not raised Jewish, but were socialised with Jewish children. I suspect my grandmother was keeping this a secret from my grandfather who was an atheist, but still had a desire to pass on something, or at least raise her kids so they weren't anti-Semitic. Whatever the reason, I feel a bit sad that this heritage was lost, and would like to know more about Jewish history, culture, and religion. I'm not interested in converting.</p>\n\n<p>After some digging, my father and I found out that our original Jewish ancestor was kidnapped by the British navy in the late 1700s and pressed into service. He escaped to Canada a decade later and never returned to Britain. It's a shocking bit of history. (In an interesting coincidence, as a Canadian immigrant to Britain, I now work a five minute walk from where he lived in London as a cloth merchant.)</p>\n\n<p>I've been learning more about Jewish history in Britain specifically, but most of what I've been reading has been academic. I'd like to connect to the Jewish community here in order to learn more, but I don't know what's an appropriate way to approach it, or where, who, how, or even if I should. Any suggestions or advice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodea, and I hope you find what you are looking for! </p>\n\n<p>For those interested in conversion, it is perfectly legitimate to become involved in the Jewish community, such as by attending classes, synagogue services, and community events, as well as meeting with a rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>You say you are not interested in converting, but at the same time you say you are interested in connecting with the Jewish community and learning more about Judaism. This suggests to me that you have not completely ruled out the idea of converting and rejoining the faith of your ancestors. </p>\n\n<p>For that reason, you could begin to explore Judaism, such as attending synagogue services or meeting with a rabbi, explaining to anyone who asks simply what you said above: that you found out you have Jewish ancestry and are interested in learning more about Judaism. If they ask if you are interested in converting, you can say, \"I don't know,\" if that is true. </p>\n\n<p>If you say that you are definitely not interested in converting, then they are likely to welcome you nonetheless to a service or event or two. But it would be somewhat strange to regularly attend Jewish community events and services despite having decided for sure you have no interest in converting. Even so, in many places you would probably find yourself welcomed anyway. In my Orthodox synagogue we were quite friendly to a Baptist minister who attended our services simply because he was curious. </p>\n\n<p>A final note on the subject of conversion: you may be interested to learn that even though, according to Jewish law, potential converts are initially discouraged (to ensure converts are truly committed), some rabbis rule that we are not to discourage potential converts who have Jewish ancestry, since they are seen as \"seed of Israel\" who were lost to the Jewish people but are now, fortunately, returning.

    "content": "# What is the point of Sheva Brachos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Kesubos 7b-8a (translation is mine, based on Rashi):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת״ר מברכין ברכת חתנים כל שבעה אמר רב יהודה והוא שבאו פנים חדשות מאי מברך אמר רב יהודה בא״י אמ״ה...<br>\n  The Rabbis taught [in a Braisa]: We make Sheva Brachos all seven days [after the wedding]. Rav Yehudah said: This is only when there are new people [on each day; otherwise only the last one is recited]. What is said? Said Rav Yehudah: [The Gemara proceeds to say the text of the blessings].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam, Ishus 10:6 (still my translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַמְאָרֵס אֶת הָאִשָּׁה וּבֵרֵךְ בִּרְכַּת חֲתָנִים וְלֹא נִתְיַחֵד עִמָּהּ בְּבֵיתוֹ עֲדַיִן אֲרוּסָה הִיא שֶׁאֵין בִּרְכַּת חֲתָנִים עוֹשָׂה הַנִּשּׂוּאִין אֶלָּא כְּנִיסָה לַחֻפָּה. אֵרֵס וְכָנַס לַחֻפָּה וְלֹא בֵּרֵךְ בִּרְכַּת חֲתָנִים הֲרֵי זוֹ נְשׂוּאָה גְּמוּרָה וְחוֹזֵר וּמְבָרֵךְ אֲפִלּוּ אַחַר כַּמָּה יָמִים.<br>\n  If one does Kiddushin and said Sheva Brachos [under the chuppah] but did not seclude himself in his house with her [which would accomplish Nisuin] she is an Arusah, as Sheva Brachos does not accomplish Nisuin - only entering the Chuppah does that. If he did Eirusin and Nisuin but did not do Sheva Brachos [under the Chuppah], she is a full-fledged Nesuah, but he must go back and say Sheva Brachos even after several days. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The last point in the Rambam is alluding to the Braisa at the very beginning of Kallah Rabasi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כלה בלא ברכה אסורה לבעלה כנדה שלא טבלה. מה נדה שלא טבלה אסורה לבעלה אף כלה בלא ברכה אסורה לבעלה:<br>\n  A Kallah without a Brachah is prohibited to her husband like a Niddah who has not tovelled: just as the Niddah who has not tovelled is prohibited to her husband, so, too, a Kallah without a brachah is prohibited to her husband.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The \"Gemara\" explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבא באי זו ברכה אמרו ברכת שבעה ולא ברכת אירוסין.<br>\n  Says Rava: Of which Bracha was this said? Of Sheva Brachos, not Birchas Eirusin. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ritva to the Gemara in Kesubos above says this obligation is only D'Rabbanan. The Braisa in Kallah proceeds to quote a passuk for the chiyuv Sheva Brachos, which the \"Gemara\" explains is an Asmachta (not a real source - a passuk on which the Rabbanan \"hung\" their own chiyuv).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So why did the Rabbanan institute Sheva Brachos, and why is it so important that the Kallah is prohibited to her husband if they don't do it? If, as the Rambam paskens, it doesn't help with either Eirusin or Nisuin, then what does it do? Furthermore, this only explains why we do it at the Chuppah. Why do we do it during the week?</p>\n\n\n",

According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.13.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabbah</a>, this period encompasses the ca. 11 years of Shmuel's time as judge, ca. two years of Shaul as king, and ca. 7.5 years of David as king in Hebron. After 7.5 years in Hebron David conquered Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Samuel.5.4-9?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samuel 2:5:4-9</a>), so that means that shortly after that, sometime into his eighth year, he made his first attempt at bringing the Ark.

    "content": "# La'asot meaning \"to prepare food\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In parshat Vayera, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 18:7</a>, the text relates that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֶל־הַבָּקָ֖ר רָ֣ץ אַבְרָהָ֑ם וַיִּקַּ֨ח בֶּן־בָּקָ֜ר רַ֤ךְ וָטוֹב֙ וַיִּתֵּ֣ן אֶל־הַנַּ֔עַר וַיְמַהֵ֖ר לַֽעֲשׂ֥וֹת אֹתֽוֹ׃</p>\n<p>Avraham ran, chose an animal, gave it to the youth \"and he rushed to do it.\" (the Haemek Davar says that it means that Avraham rushed the lad to do it)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead of any detail given about what was being done, or any verb specific to food preparation, the text simply says \"la'asot oto\" to do \"it\". The Radak indicates that the \"do\" was to prepare/cook the food, but the word seems unnecessarily vague.</p>\n<p>As far as I understand, \"la'asot\" indicates doing an action, with the object (that which is done) usually a specified task. Here, the object is either the unlisted command [cf pasuk 19 \"לַעֲשׂוֹת צְדָקָה וּמִשְׁפָּט\"], or the animal (as other transitive verbs are followed by the object of that verb). The term \"la'asot oto\" only appears one other time in the Chamisha Chumshei Torah, in Vayikra 17:9 but there the action done is explicitly spelled out in the previous verse (אֲשֶׁר יַעֲלֶה עֹלָה אוֹ זָבַח) . Why would the text use such vague language?</p>\n<p>The Chizkuni writes about the phrase \"לשון תקון\" but I'm not sure what he means by that.</p>\n<p>Is there any other discussion/insight into why the text does not say exactly what was done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.7?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv on Bereshis 18:7</a> uses the word <em>La'osos</em> as an incomplete work done by Abraham, which afterwards was finished by Ishmael. This is explained by R. Mordechai Kuperman in comment 41 (also analogously to Netziv's other comment on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.3?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 2:3</a> on the word \"la'asos\"): and so the youth made (<em>tiken</em>) the calf and Avraham only brought it before them (the guests), for otherwise what is the need for the youth (i.e. why Avraham gave the calf to him)? The same idea we find in Midrash Tanchuma. Such is the understanding of R. Sa'adia Gaon: why \"rushed\" - rushed to prepare. And why the next verse states that Abraham \"brought a calf that he made\", as if he made himself, rather the messenger (<em>shaliyach</em>) of the person is like the person himself. Ishmael was <em>shaliyach</em> of Abraham, so that the Torah states as if Abraham himself prepared the calf. The same meaning we also find in RaDaQ: \"which he made\" - i.e. which he made with the help of youth.</p>\n<p>Malbim gives an unusual comment on this part of the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Genesis.18.7.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 18:7-8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וימהר לעשות אתו</strong> שעשה אותו ע\"י ספר יצירה. נראה שרצו לתרץ בזה איך האכיל להמלאכים בב\"ח, ואמרו שהיה בשר שנברא ע\"י ספר יצירה שאין לו דין בשר, וז\"ש <strong>שלקח חמאה וחלב ובן הבקר אשר עשה</strong>, ר\"ל יען שעשאו ע\"י ספר יצירה היו יכולים לאכלו עם חלב. אבל בפשוט לא קשה כי נתן לפניהם תחלה חמאה וחלב ואכלו ואח\"כ שעשה בן הבקר נתן לפניהם הבשר</p>\n<p><strong>And he rushed to make it</strong> (Abraham) created it using <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>. It appears to me that some people seek to explain here how Abraham fed the angels meat and milk. So they answer that the meat created using <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> is not considered meat. That is why it is written that (Abraham) <strong>took butter and milk and a calf <em>that he made</em></strong>, the intention is to say that because he made it (the calf) using <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> they could eat it with milk. However, the simple meaning of the verse is not difficult. I.e. (Avraham) placed before them milk and butter, and then, after he prepared the calf, he placed meat before them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the mikra does not come out of the simple meaning, perhaps, the kabbalah answer simply means that Abraham offered the guests a fancy meat meal and gave them milk and butter to quench appetite from their journey. I.e. the guests did not sit hungry, they ate dairy thinking about the fancy meal coming, while Abraham was preparing the meat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question is answered by looking at the context of the expression.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Bereshit 18:7-8, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואל הבקר רץ אברהם <strong>ויקח בן בקר רך וטוב</strong> ויתן אל הנער <strong>וימהר לעשות אתו</strong>\n<strong>ויקח</strong> חמאה וחלב <strong>ובן הבקר אשר עשה</strong> <strong>ויתן לפניהם</strong> והוא עמד עליהם תחת העץ\n<strong>ויאכלו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That in context, לעשות means to make the calf into food. That the Avot kept all the 613 mitzvot and all the Rabbinic laws, even before they were given.</p>\n<p>In this context, it means that Avraham gave the calf to Yishmael, who is the only one referred to as הנער, <em>the youth</em>, between Yishmael and Eliezer, to quickly slaughter the calf, soak and salt it and cook it to serve as food for the (<em>angelic</em>) guests.</p>\n<p>So in context, לעשות here is referring to all the steps necessary to convert the living calf into actual food, ready to consume.</p>\n<p>But the deeper insight is understood when you look at Rashi’s comments about <em><strong>the tree</strong></em> (העץ) that Avraham is standing under or in place of (<em>meaning in the sense of serving as an agent for the tree</em>). Bereshit 18:4</p>\n<p>That Rashi emphasizes that this expression is referring to האילן. This is referring to a specific type of kabbalistic practice called <em><strong>Yichudim</strong></em>, unifications of the various names of G-d. That האילן is specifically connecting with the <em><strong>Shem HaMeforash</strong></em>, the name which is written one way and pronounced another. And so even though the language of the written Torah is according to its plain meaning, that plain meaning is actually about a paradigm for the <em><strong>Tikkun</strong></em> of all Creation.</p>\n<p>For those who are interested in learning more about this subject, see the 138 Keys of Wisdom (קל׳ח פתחי חכמה) by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato, <strong>Key 31</strong> and Sefer Kehillat Yaacov by Rabbi Yaacov Tzvi Yolles for the term, אילן.</p>\n\n\n",

The text of the bracha seems to reflect an explicit command -- but what command?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13592/1362\">This</a> answer indicates \"In Ashkenazic practice, the optimal blessing for a <em>tallit</em> -- to wrap oneself in <em>tzitzit</em> -- is said only on a <em>talit gadol</em>. For a *tallit katan\", we're not sure it's quite up to that level, so it gets a lesser blessing, regarding the mitzva of <em>tzitzit</em>. \" I'm not sure what any of this really means -- is there an extant commandment to wrap that is on a higher level than simply \"asu lahem tzitzit\"?</p>\n\n<p>Additional notes -- the <a href=\"http://www.shulchanarach.com/SAch8.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch</a> (O\"C 8:1) says, \"One should wrap himself in the ציצית and make a blessing on them while standing\" -- \" יתעטף בציצית ויברך מעומד\". But (8:3) \"the טלית קטן (small Talit) garments that we have the custom to wear, even though there is no concept of wrapping (היתעטף) by them, one is יוצא his obligation of ציצית.\" So we fulfill the obligation without wrapping. </p>\n\n<p>So, if so, where is there any additional textual obligation to wrap that would be reflected in the bracha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>(As background, know that there is an argument (see Tur OC 8) if a formal \"Arab-style\" wrapping is the only method of wearing a four-cornered garment which qualifies for the biblical command of Tzitzit. This is just a question of what the Torah commanded. Wearing four-cornered socks, for instance, or a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/79360/759\">four cornered scarf</a> is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8408/759\">not included in the Mitzva</a> according to everyone and you'd be exempt from putting Tzitzit on them.)</p>\n\n<p>So we have a blessing which uses what appears to be a very particular word describing the method of wearing clothing in its formulation. You can take this in 4 main ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This shows that the opinion limiting the Mitzva to the formal Arab-style wrap is correct. (See Or Zarua quoted in Terumat HaDeshen #45.) We only find this limiting because our sartorial styles have changed in the last few millennia. According to this you have to wear any garment with Tzitzit in the formal Arab-style wrap fashion always if you want to fulfill the Mitzva. (Some are stringent for this opinion when not doing so would be a leniency such as to avoid <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/80061/759\">a possibly invalid blessing said before donning a Talit</a>.)</p></li>\n<li><p>The wording of the blessing is not intended to be fixed and when wearing Tzitzit not in the old fashioned formal Arab-wrap style you should say a different blessing like \"LeHitlabbesh BaTzitzit\" or maybe \"Al Mitzvat Tzitzit\". (See Maharam of Rothenberg quoted in Terumat HaDeshen ibid.) According to this there is no need ever to do the formal Arab-style wrapping, as long as you pay attention to the wording of your blessing.</p></li>\n<li><p>The wording of the blessing is fixed but just indicates the most common usage when it was composed, namely, the formal Arab-style wrapping. This is not unlike other Mitzvot where (at least according to this school of thought) we use the standard text even when in non-standard circumstances (eg. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/33204/759\">washing hands for bread by dipping in a Mikva gets an \"Al Netilat Yadayim\"</a>). This is just a fixture of our liturgical system sans a Sanhedrin. (See Beiur HaGra to OC 8:6.) According to this there is [most likely] no need ever to do the formal Arab-style wrapping.</p></li>\n<li><p>This shows that the word \"LeHit'ateif\" isn't such a specific action and it doesn't have to mean formal Arab-style wrapping, but rather any type of wearing/wrapping. That which the Talmud (MK 24a) defines that word as a formal Arab-style wrap is either not how we rule (Beit Yosef OC 8) or was only intended for the laws of mourning (Mahari Abuhov cited ibid.). According to this there is no question from the language of the blessing and formal Arab-style wrapping isn't necessary for Tzitzit.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>One way or another, the blessing is just describing the process of putting on the clothing with Tzitzit, and while the word it chose may seem very particular, the Mitzva is just what we always thought it was which is wearing a garment with Tzitzit in accordance with various legal details, whatever they may be; tying Tzitzit onto clothing is not strictly speaking a complete Mitzva (more of a Hekhsher Mitzva or the beginning of a Mitzva, however we decide to define that).</p>\n\n<p>You are correct that the verb in the verses is related to making the fringes, but blessings don't always follow the verse exactly (eg. \"Lehaniach Tefillin\" not \"Likshor Tefillin\", \"Likboa Mezuza\" not \"Likhtov Mezuza\", or \"Lehafrish Challah\" not \"Leharim Challah\"). We apparently allow a bit of Oral Torah interpretation to frame exactly what Mitzva action we are performing when formulating the blessing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Looking at the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Mitzvot_Gadol,_Volume_Two.26?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Semag, Aseh 26</a>, it says that there are two posukim that obligate the mitzvah of tzitzit. One is BaMidbar 15:38 and the other is Devarim 22:12 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גדילים תעשה לך על ארבע כנפות כסותך אשר תכסה בה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that there are two parts to this mitzvah. The first part is the placing of the <em>g'dilim</em>, meaning the four threads which are doubled over to make eight strings, on the four corners of the garment (<strong>גדילים תעשה</strong> לך <strong>על ארבע</strong> <strong>כנפות כסותך</strong>). And the second part of the mitzvah is to be covered, meaning enwrapped, by them (אשר <strong>תכסה בה</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>This follows the statement found in the Kol Bo, Din Hilchot Tzitzit which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והעושה ציצית לעצמו מברך אקב״ו על מצות ציצית ושהחיינו. והרמבם ז״ל כתב שאין מברכים על הציצית בשעת עשיה לפי שאין המצוה אלא להתעטף בו כו׳ וה״ר יצחק כתב בטלית קטן יברך על מצות ציצית ובטלית של עטוף להתעטף.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One who makes tzitzit for himself makes the blessing, \"who has sanctified us through His commandments and commanded us concerning the commandment of tzitzit\" and the blessing of <em>Shehechiyanu</em>. And the Rambam z\"l wrote that we don't make a blessing on the tzitzit at the time of making it because there is no commandment except to be wrapped in it. Etc. And our teacher, Rabbi Yitzchok wrote in regard to the tallit katan, one will bless, \"<em>al Mitzvah tzitzit</em> and on a tallit capable of wrapping (של עטוף) one will bless <em>l'hitatef</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is explained further in HaIttur, Chelek 2, Sha'ar HaTzitzit, Sha'ar 3: Sha'ar Adam, Chelek 2, which says that this is a disagreement among the Sages as to whether there is a mitzvah concerning the garment or only in regard to the wrapping.</p>\n\n<p>The first opinion is that if you have a four cornered garment which is large enough to require tzitzit, you are obligated to make tzitzit on it whether you are using it at that moment or not. And this is the source for the text of the blessing, \"<em>al mitzvat tzitzit</em>. This first opinion says that the blessing of <em>l'hitatef</em> is said at the actual time of being enwrapped in the garment, but if you didn't need that particular garment when you made the tzitzit, you don't say l'hitatef.</p>\n\n<p>The second opinion is that you only make a blessing when the Mitzvah is completed and that is specifically when you wrap in the garment which has tzitzit on it.</p>\n\n<p>The Ittur points out that his tradition follows the view of Rav Chisda, that any mitzvah where making something is the completion of the act, you are <em>required</em> to make the blessing. And any mitzvah where making something does not complete the act, meaning something else is done in regard to it, does not <em>require</em> a blessing in regard to making it.</p>\n\n<p>The Ittur points out that this view maintains both opinions, that there is a Mitzvah in regard to the garment itself even though no blessing is <em>required</em> to be said at the time the tzitzit are placed on the garment and in regard to the second view that the blessing must be said  when the person wraps in the tallit.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting from the Kol Bo that with a tallit that is too small for <em>atifah</em> one falls back to the blessing of making the tzitzit on ones four cornered garment.</p>\n\n<p>The Semag goes on to explain from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.40b.28-32?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 40b</a> which says in the name of Shmuel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר שמואל\n  תכלת אין בה משום כלאים ואפי' בטלית פטורה\n  מאי טלית פטורה\n  אילימא דלית בה שיעורא והתניא\n  טלית שהקטן מתכסה בו ראשו ורובו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>that the minimum measure of the four cornered garment that is obligated to tzitzit is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טלית שהקטן מתכסה בה ראשו ורובו והגדול יוצא בה עראי חייבת בציצית, אין הקטן תכסה בה ראשו ורובו אף על פי שהגדול יוצא בה עראי פטורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It must be large enough to cover the head and the majority of the body of the child. (<strong>טלית</strong> שהקטן <strong>מתכסה בה ראשו ורובו...חייבת בציצית</strong>)</p>\n\n<p>It also distinguishes here between the child and the adult. With the child, if it is large enough to cover him completely, then the tallit requires tzitzit  and the child fulfills completely by making the blessing of <em>l'hitatef b'tzitzit</em>.</p>\n\n<p>That same size tallit, which is large enough for the child to fulfill the mitzvah completely is not large enough for an adult to fulfill completely. But in a temporary situation, (in the language of some sources it is called בשעת דחק, in others אקראי) the adult can rely upon it to fulfill in a minimal way (והגדול <strong>יוצא בה עראי</strong>). The adult cannot do <em>atifah</em>, which is the complete way of fulfilling, but he can have tzitzit on a four cornered garment.</p>\n\n<p>If the garment doesn't have the size required for the child to fulfill properly, then the garment is not required to have tzitzit at all. This would be considered like a scarf.</p>\n\n<p>The Semag goes on to emphasize that the size for covering sufficiently is dependent upon the size of the person wearing the garment. That means the size required for the <em>katan</em>, the child, is smaller than the size required for the adult.</p>\n\n<p>The Semag clarifies more about the katan and what his physical size will be from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.42a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 42a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קטן שיודע להתעטף בציצית חייב בציצית.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That it's not any size child, meaning for example, like a child of five or six, but one <em>who knows how to be enwrapped.</em> It also introduces the word <em>atifah</em> (עטיפה) here as a synonym for being covered (תכסה) around the head and the majority of the torso. This also follows the language of the Ittur cited above, Sha'ar 2: Sha'ar Tallit, Chellek 3 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אע״ג דמברכינין להתעטף בציצית לשון כסות היא כדכתיב <strong>אשר תכסה בה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this distinction of Atifah (עטיפה) is based upon <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.24a.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moed Katan 24a</a> which says in the name of Shmuel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל עטיפה שאינה כעטיפת ישמעאלים אינה עטיפה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That the wrapping practiced by the Yishmaelim is around the head with the face showing and around the shoulders down to the chest as described by the Alter Rebbe in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32581&st=&pgnum=11&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Tehillat HaShem, page 11</a> in conjunction with the blessings for tzitzit.</p>\n\n<p>This same reference to Moed Katan is also said in the name of the Gaonim in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Tur,_Orach_Chaim.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur, Orach Chaim, Hilchot Tzitzit, Siman 8</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This same expression is brought in Sefer Orchot Chaim, Hilchot Tzitzit, sief 21 which clarifies further:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושמעתי שהקטן רוצה לומר <strong>קטן שהגיע לחינוך</strong> כדאמרינן קטן היודע להתעטף חייב בציצית</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that the <em>katan</em> is Bar Mitzvah age like is understood from Avot 5:22. That also has implications about the minimum size of the tallit katan and when a garment is required to have tzitzit. Something that could cover a younger child isn't really required to have tzitzit at all.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Orchot Chaim goes on to say in sief 22:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ו<strong>העושה ציצית</strong> לעצמו <strong>מברך על מצות ציצית</strong> ושהחיינו והרמב״ם ז״ל כתב שאין מברכים על הציצית בשעת עשייה לפי <strong>שאין מצוה אלא להתעטף בו</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two ideas are brought out here. The first is that the blessing of <em>al mitzvah tzitzit</em> pertains to the placing of tzitzit on a garment that requires them. And the second idea according to Rambam is that the primary aspect of the mitzvah and its completion is the being wrapped in them. This is like is understood from the posuk cited above from Devarim 22:12.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Orchot Chaim goes further in sief 23 to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>המתעטף בטלית מצויצת מברך להתעטף בציצית</strong> והרב יהודה חסיד כתב <strong>בטלית קטן יברך על מצות ובטלית של עטוף להתעטף</strong>. ואם לא שח בין טלית קטן לתליט גדול כתב רבינו מאיר נ״ע שאין צריך לברך לגדול.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it appears from Sukkah 42a that <em>atifah</em> is a synonym for being completely covered and concealed by the garment which is defined as covering your head and the majority of your body.</p>\n\n<p>And this would be the basis for the language of the blessing <em>to be wrapped (or completely covered)</em> <em>by the tzitzit</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How were the patterned curtains for the mishkan woven?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9887#showrashi=true&v=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 26:1</a> describes the mishkan's curtains thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֶת הַמִּשְׁכָּן תַּעֲשֶׂה עֶשֶׂר יְרִיעֹת שֵׁשׁ מָשְׁזָר וּתְכֵלֶת וְאַרְגָּמָן וְתֹלַעַת שָׁנִי כְּרֻבִים מַעֲשֵׂה חשֵׁב תַּעֲשֶׂה אֹתָם:</p>\n<p>And the Mishkan you shall make out of ten curtains [consisting] of twisted fine linen, and blue, purple, and crimson wool. A cherubim design of the work of a master weaver you shall make them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had always assumed that, given that we're using four different colors here, the <em>cheruvim</em> were somehow woven in using contrasting colors (like maybe the background was one color and the other three were used to make the pattern).  But Rashi says the four colors were all plied together into one 24-strand yarn containing all four colors:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>of twisted fine linen, and blue, purple, and crimson wool: Thus there are four kinds [of material] together in each thread, one of linen and three of wool, and each thread was doubled six times. Thus, four kinds [of material], when they are twisted together, yield twenty-four strands to a thread. — [from Baraitha Melecheth HaMishkan, ch. 2, Yoma 71b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(I didn't find more info in Yoma, and I don't know Baraitha Melecheth HaMishkan.)</p>\n<p>One might think the <em>cheruvim</em> are then embroidered on top of this blended background, but Rashi points out that the text says \"work of a master <em>weaver</em>\", not embroiderer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A cherubim design of the work of a master weaver: Cherubim were drawn on them [the curtains] in their weave; not with embroidery, which is needlework, but with weaving on both sides, one face from here [one side] and one face from there [the other side]: a lion from this side and an eagle from that side, as silk girdles, called feysses in Old French, are woven. — [from Yoma 72b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I don't know a lot about the construction of the tabernacle, but I do know a little bit about weaving.  If you weave a pattern into the cloth, you get the pattern on one side and its inverse on the other.  So we can't be talking about that, according to Rashi.  Another technique is brocading, where you use a second weft thread to weave in the pattern on top of the cloth as you go (on one side).  This second weft doesn't contribute to the structural integrity of the cloth (that's what the first, main weft is for), but you can use it to make patterns like those shown in <a href=\"http://www.guntram.co.za/tabletweaving/docs/as2004/as2004.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guntram.co.za/tabletweaving/docs/belt2003/belt2003.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one</a>.  This technique was used in Rashi's time for silk girdles.</p>\n<p>It would be quite difficult to brocade on <em>both</em> sides of the cloth using the looms and techniques available in Rashi's time, let alone those in the time of the <em>midbar</em>, but the torah also tells us that the <em>mishkan</em> craftsmen were embued with exceptional spirit and skill, so maybe they could do that.</p>\n<p>If they did use brocading to make the images, though, then what did they use for the brocade thread?  The torah is very detailed in describing the materials for the <em>mishkan</em>, and it doesn't say anything about gold thread, for example.  You <em>can</em> brocade with the same yarn that you weave with, in which case you get a raised textured effect, but it'd be pretty hard to <em>see</em> because it's of uniform coloring.</p>\n<p>And all of this is being done with only a single blended thread color, according to Rashi.  (As opposed to having red, blue, purple, and linen threads separately available to make contrasting patterns.)  If you ply threads of different colors together as Rashi says, you get a thread with color that varies along its length as each component thread rises to the top alternately.</p>\n<p>It's possible, of course, that Rashi is mistaken, either about the colors all being twisted together into one thread or about the patterning.  None of the <em>chumashim</em> I checked, including Stone, brought an opposing opinion.</p>\n<p>So what did these curtains look like, both coloring and patterning?  How did they use linen, blue, purple, and crimson to make curtains with <em>cheruvim</em> (and maybe other things) woven into them?  Did they use some additional material beyond the four threads/colors the torah describes?  (Like gold brocading on top of this base?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Not everybody agrees with Rashi.</p>\n<p>Abarbanel (as cited in the JPS Miqra'ot Gedolot English translation) says that the linen threads formed the warp and the colored yarns were used in the weft to make the designs.  Gersonides adds that the design work involves calculating the number of threads that will produce the image when it's woven.  That's not very clear; I'll get back to that in a moment.  Finally (from JPS MG), Ibn Ezra says that it was a \"worked design\", meaning neither woven nor embroidered but \"like silk today\": two threads are held at a distance and each point on the drawing is pulled into a pucker.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra lived in the 12th century CE in Spain, which is to say al-Andalus.  I went looking for information about silk weaving in that time and place; I found this <a href=\"http://www.islamicspain.tv/Arts-and-Science/The-Culture-of-Al-Andalus/Textiles.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">high-level description (with photos)</a> but it's short on details of production.  <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/35633421/The_production_of_silk_Andalusia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Production of Silk, Andalusia by David Jacoby</a> (registration at Academia.edu required for download) describes silk from this time period in more detail but stops short of production details.  From that paper, it sounds like some of the finest silks are tapestries, so I then consulted this <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tapm/hd_tapm.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">overview of medieval and renaissance tapestry production from the Met</a>, which describes weaving a design through two sheds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The warps are arranged so there is a small space between the even and odd warps, called the shed, through which the weaver passes the colored weft threads that are wrapped around a handheld shuttle. Alternate warps are attached to drawstrings with which the weaver can pull them forward (on the high-warp loom) or backward (on the low-warp loom) to create a second shed, through which the weft is then passed back again. By passing the weft back and forth through the two sheds, the weaver inserts the weft over one warp and under the next in one direction and then back in the opposite direction over and under the alternate warps. Periodically, the weaver beats down the developing web so that the warps are completely covered by the weft. [...]</p>\n<p>In European medieval and Renaissance practice, the design was invariably copied from a full-scale colored pattern, known as the cartoon, a practice that continues to this day. Before starting work, the weaver traces the pattern from the cartoon onto the bare warps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a woven-in design, not brocade (and not embroidery).  The planning of the design aligns with Gershonides.  The weaving aligns somewhat with Ibn Ezra, <em>except</em> that I still don't know what he means about threads being pulled into a pucker.  Patterned weaving as described in the Met article is also consistent with Abarbanel.</p>\n<p>I cannot reconcile Rashi's description with results that would show a pattern.  The weaving technique described by Abarbanel would have been known to Ibn Ezra and was used for fancy silks, so I tentatively conclude that it was a woven pattern on a linen \"base\" and that Ibn Ezra was probably not a weaver who could provide a detailed, accurate description of silk production in his time.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara expounds upon this passuk in Erchin 16b-17a, which is the primary source about this chiyuv. Among the main points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a dispute whether you should continue rebuking him until he slaps you, curses you, or is merely upset at you. The Rambam paskens like the first opinion (not sure where off the top of my head, though Ein Mishlat to that sugya will tell you).</li>\n<li>The Gemara in BM 33a adds that you should rebuke him even 100 times otherwise, and even if he is your Rebbe (though respectfully - see Kiddushin 30a).</li>\n<li>People don't know how to rebuke properly anymore; those who say \"remove that thorn from between your eyes\" are responded to with \"remove that beam from between your eyes.\" I understood that line in the sense of devarim shevev nichnasim lelev - as they gave an insincere rebuke, possibly for selfish purposes and not because they actually want to help the other person, the rebuke wasn't effective.

For instance, if you speak to him in a very non-threatening way that conveys respect and goodwill, and he feels that you are on his side and only trying to help him, he is likely to consider what you're saying.              If, however, you confront him with hostility or condescension, not only isn't that the rebuke required by the Torah, it is probably <em>Onaat Devarim</em>, a very serious transgression. I recall hearing in the name of a recent Gadol that nowadays we don't know how to give rebuke, and therefore (generally speaking) we shouldn't.</p>\n\n\n",

He <strong>must</strong> learn in the Bais Medrash of Hashem.</em></p>\n\n<p>This means that while we cannot understand what happens when we reach Olam Haba, we can express it in terms that we understand to be a reward or a punishment. Since each person is different, the what would be reward for one could be a punishment for another. Thus, one cannot state that one reward is \"higher\" or \"better\" than the other in the case of the two girls you give in the question. Each one would receive the reward that she is capable of understanding and \"enjoying\". This is actually something that is based on the level that she manages to reach during her life.</p>\n\n\n",

May be that if you reached the second day, you are already good enough. Gemara clearly doesn't ask for one day only. Few than one day is counted in hours or in Onot which are half days.

This he should do 442 [in another reading 462] times. If he walks forward, the creature rises up alive, by virtue of the power inherent in the recitation of the letters. But if he wishes to destroy what he has mad, he goes around backward, reciting the same alphabets from the end to the beginning. Then the creature sinks into the ground of itself and dies. And so it happened to R.I.B.E. [probably Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha] with his students who busied themselves with the Book of Yetzeira and by mistake went around backwards, until they themselves by the power of the letters sank into the earth up to their navels. They were unable to escape and cried out. Their teacher heard them and said: Recite the letters of the alphabet forwards and walk forward instead of going backward as you have been doing. They did so and were released.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On practical kabbalah I would also suggest perusing this site <a href=\"http://kabbalahselfcreation.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://kabbalahselfcreation.blogspot.com/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If there was such a thing, it would be inappropriate to publicize in a forum like this. The way to further your understanding of these matters is make yourself more fitting for the information to be revealed to you. It's not like a magic trick that you look up. The book Path of the Just by R Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (a great kabbalist) is a path to achieve enlightenment. Reading and applying his insights will get you closer to your goal.

He writes on page xix:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are many interpretations as to exactly what these two sages accomplished in creating such a calf, and why they did it. Some say that they did not actually create a physical calf, but created such a clear meditative image that the spiritual satisfaction was the same as eating (Yad Ramma). Even such a Kabbalist as Abraham Abulafia maintains that their creation was mystical rather than physical. (Ner Elohim quoted in G. Scholem hakabbalah shel hetemunah vesehl Abraham Abulafia p. 217). Rashba saw particular significance in the fact that they would engage in this on Friday, the day which mammals were originally created. This entire question will be discussed further in our commentary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So although Rabbi Kaplan himself through many comments displays his belief in the ability to create life through various methods surrounding the seffer yetzira, he seems to be leaning here towards the idea that no actual physical calf was in fact created. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure where he is referring to further in his commentary and he certainly mentions a Golem creation many times, but this seems to be his thought on this matter.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If you get a psak, then hear that it is wrong, what must you do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If I get a personal psak from \"my\" rabbi, then hear something--let's say from a dayan who is advising me on a different, but related matter--to indicate that \"my\" rabbi's psak was somehow flawed, what am I obligated to do? Must I return to \"my\" rabbi with the information I heard from the dayan? Must I seek a new psak from someone else? (Whom?) Or may I be willfully ignorant of the additional information because it was not offered in the context of a formal teshuva to the original shaylo I asked my rabbi?</p>\n\n<p>Would the answer differ depending on whether the dayan's information made things stricter or more lenient?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>1) First you should approach a knowledgable Jew who is also someone you can trust enough to shmooze it over with.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This step is not asking for an actual \"psak halachah\" from a 2nd Rav. This is simply you getting an education on the Torah matter. Yes, you should not pretend ignorance when other information comes up. Rather, you should investigate it.</p>\n\n<p>It is important here to mention a point. In general, No Jew <strong>\"MUST\"</strong> ask a Rabbi something. You are supposed to know the Torah yourself. You only ask a Rabbi when you have a doubt.(Devarim 17:8 \"If a matter of judgment be hidden from you...\") Therefore, nothing stops you from learning Torah! So, go ask 10 people their opinion. Only, do not ask it as a request from a Rav for a psak. You may ask a Rav (or many) for a theoretical opinion, without being bound. (Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach)</p>\n\n<p>Also, did you in fact intend to go to the first Rabbi for a real psak? Did you ask with intent that his decision be legally binding upon you? Did the Rabbi understand that this was what you were doing as well and issue a psak in his intention? OR was it understood that the conversation was initially about serious advice and did not take the form of a formal psak Halachah? If the latter, then you are not bound at all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Three Possibilities</strong></p>\n\n<p>Decide, (once you have fully understood the new info from the conversation with the Dayan, and how it applies to your situation) if your 1st Rabbi:</p>\n\n<p>A) made an error that violates halachah, or goes against the \"overwhelming\" majority or mainstream accepted practice. OR his decision was based on a wrong presentation of the facts.</p>\n\n<p>B) He didn't make an outright error, but you now believe strongly that you can present the case in a way that the 1st Rabbi will admit the whole thing should be reversed. OR you found enough mainstream opinions that say against him and you feel he will change his mind due to those opinions.</p>\n\n<p>C) It is a question of basically equal balance and your Rabbi's opinion is perfectly valid, even if there are other conflicting opinions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Three Outcomes</strong></p>\n\n<p>If it is A, then you should disregard the 1st Rabbi's decision.(or at least you have the right to disregard) It is invalid. You should still respect him, and may even ask him questions in the future. After all, we are all human. :) (Tosfos to Avodah Zara, 7a; Bechoros 28b)</p>\n\n<p>If it is B, then you may bring the case back to him and ask him to re-examine the question in light of the new information. He is allowed to change his mind. (Shach to Yoreh Deah 242:58; Rosh Sanhedrin 4:6) Some say he may retract even if he doesn't believe he is proven to be in the wrong.(Levush 242:31, Aruch HaShulchan 242:60)</p>\n\n<p>If it is C, then his decision stands. Some authorities rule that even if he changes his mind, it has no effect.(Shach) Others rule that you may ask him to change his mind and he may do so.(Levush, Aruch HaShulchan)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if you discover that the 1st Rabbi was right all along, then this whole question is moot. :)</p>\n\n<p>However, in the first place, one should generally never approach a Rav for a psak. Rather, ask him to teach you Torah, give you \"eytzah\" advice, talk in learning, share his opinion on the subject, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If and when you are freely ready to give up your will and want to accept his opinion as obligation, because you don't know the answer yourself and have no choice, then and only then, ask for a real Halachic psak. Then it is binding. Otherwise it is not; and all of the above wouldn't matter.</p>\n\n<p>If you already asked for a psak, you are anyway only obligated to follow it for a one time event.(Rema 242:31) Example: If he forbids you to make ice cubes on Shabbos, then you can't make them this Shabbos. Next week you can ask another Rabbi. OR go learn the issue and pick a path for yourself. :) </p>\n\n<p>If you did accept a psak, from a Rabbi, then there are two possible reasons why you must now listen to the psak. A) Asking a second Rabbi would be an insult to the honor of the first Rabbi (and by extension dishonoring the Halachic system).(Ran, Rosh) OR B) Once you knowingly ask a Rav for a psak, it is as if you vowed to forbid the object the Rabbi forbids, upon your own soul. \"Shavya A'nafshey C'chatichah D'issurah\". (Raavad, Ramban, Rashba, Shach, Gra)</p>\n\n<p>So, if the psak was stringent, and now you seek to have a second Rabbi be lenient, then the self imposed vow applies. The second Rabbi cannot reverse it. But if the psak was lenient and now you want to ask a second Rabbi to be strict, its fine. </p>\n\n<p>(BTW, according to this, if a psak is neither lenient nor stringent (ex: Do you need to repeat Shmoneh Esrei?) then the reasoning doesn't apply, and you may ask another Rabbi too.) Finding out if your question is stringent or lenient can be quite a trick. :) Multiple and equal stringencies and leniencies in the same question usually cancel out so that the question is considered neither stringent nor lenient.</p>\n\n<p>But, if we are worried for the honor of the 1st Rabbi, then it doesn't matter if he was strict or lenient. A second Rabbi may not reverse it either way.</p>\n\n<p>Some are worried for both opinions. (Rosh, Rema)</p>\n\n<p>Either way, if you do ask a second Rabbi for a psak, you must explain to him that you already asked the first Rabbi and you are seeking his help to convince the first Rabbi to retract. (Tosfos to Avodah Zara, 7a)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

My question, however, focuses primarily on the opposite, and I think more interesting issue: whether one may aid or abet someone who may hold more stringently than one does. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The simple general answer is that:</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you hold its forbidden but they hold its allowed, then you may help them to do it.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But, if you hold its allowed and they hold its forbidden, then you may not help them do it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It all depends only on what they hold, not you.</p>\n\n<p>Explanation and sources with more specifics:</p>\n\n<p>The Torah in Vayikra 19:14 says \"...you shall not place a stumbling block in front of the blind..\" Rashi brings the Sifra which explains it to mean that one may not give bad advice to someone. The Rambam (based on Gemara) explains it to mean one may not help someone sin. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (Pesachim 22) says that the definition of lifnei iver  is that one may not give wine to a nazir or a piece of a limb torn from a live animal as meat to a ben-noach. However, the Gemara (Avodah Zara 6) explains that lifnei iver is only a problem if the wine is across the other side of the river and you are the one able to go across and bring the wine to the nazir. If the wine is on the same side and the nazir could reach it himself, then there is no issur of lifnei iver in bringing the wine to the nazir. The Rishonim discuss (linked also to a Gemara in Shabbos 3) that although there is no lifnei iver, there is a D'Rabbanan called m'sayea lidvar avera. This means that even if the wine were close to the nazir so that he could get it himself, you are still not allowed to give it to him D'Rabbanan.</p>\n\n<p>The K'sav Sofer in Yoreh Deah 77 says that if the other person holds something is permitted, then you may help them, but if the other person holds it is forbidden, then you may not help them. It is obvious that helping them do what they think is forbidden is bad advice for them, causing them to sin even if you don't think it is a sin for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Reb Moshe Feinstein (O.C., I.186 by esrogim of shemittah, and Even HaEzer 4:61, by heter mechirah during shemittah in Israel) says that if the other people rely on a legitimate poseik for a heter, then you may supply them with whatever they view as heter, even if you yourself hold it is forbidden. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach also agrees with this. (Minchas Shlomo A:42,44) </p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 119:7, says that it is OK for a Jew who holds a certain food is forbidden to eat at the same table with Jews who hold that food is permitted (and may be eating it). The Shach explains this is because we believe that the other Jews at the table would never feed issur to that fellow Jew. So we see from here that if they would, then they are in violation of lifnei iver.</p>\n\n<p>In Shulchan Aruch 163:2(also 169), we see that one may not give bread to someone who will not wash and make a blessing. The Minchas Chinuch (and Arugas HaBosem) both say that one could be in violation of lifnei iver D'Oraisa even by helping someone have bread who will not wash and make a blessing even if those mitzvos are just D'Rabbanan! After all, giving bad advice is the criteria, not the level of the sin. The Pri Megadim and MaHarshag both argue strongly against this.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the Minchas Chinuch calls it a D'Oraisa when they could not get the bread themselves. If they could get it themselves, then it would only be a \nm'sayea lidvar avera. The Pri Megadim then says that a m'sayea lidvar avera (itself a D'Rabbanan) does not apply at all to a D'Rabbanan (washing, blessings before eating) whatsoever since we do not make a gezeirah l'gezeirah!</p>\n\n<p>Although some other poskim argue against this Pri Megadim, the Mishnah Berurah on 163:2 does bring him at the end by saying one should \"look at the opinion of the Pri Megadim\". My rosh Yeshiva's son-in-law Rav Zev Smith explains this to mean that the Mishnah Berurah does not entirely endorse this opinion, but you could in fact rely on it if you need to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Apparantly, this opinion holds that being machmir on a shitah D'Rabbanan about something does not mean that the machmir is making a neder (vow) D'Oraisa by being machmir (or else m'sayea lidvar avera should apply like it does with nazir).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The OP said : \"..I don't mean a chumra or minhag, but a stricter position on some halacha about which there is a legitimate machloket rishonim...\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most legitimate machlokes is usually D'Rabbanan in nature. Therefore the Pri Megadim gets you off the hook on just about any situation where your friend is machmir. But, on any legitimate machlokes D'Oraisa; or if your friend cannot get it done without you, then the heter of the Pri Megadim wouldn't help.</p>\n\n<p>(On the side, Lubavitchers and other Kiruv professionals as well as businessmen dealing with non-religious fellow Jews, rely on this Pri Megadim and a Rabbi Akiva Eiger who explains that helping someone sin less is not a problem of lifnei iver. (example: eating kosher without a brachah is better than eating treif))</p>\n\n<p><strong>The OP asks: \"What is the correct approach to avoiding lifnei iver in the absence of knowledge of everyone's positions on various issues?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Certainly, to be aware of anyone's chumrah and plan for it at all times is not obligatory. This would be a doubtful \"safek-lifnei iver\" or less. Rav Elyashiv and other poskim permit a safek lifnei iver.</p>\n\n<p>However, as we said above, the Shach on YD 119:7 says that we would never try to feed our fellow Jew something they think is forbidden. So, it is definitely proper middos to try and learn what your community and friends hold. When living among them, we should be friendly and support their potential chumras if possible, even if you are not responsible to do so. </p>\n\n<p>I myself am a Lubavitcher and only eat Cholov Yisroel. Last week, I merited to sit with Rav Dovid Feinstein shelita and one of his shiurim. We were planning a siyum. The shiur had different Chassidim and Litvaks/ lower-East Siders together. One young man was joking and asked the Rosh Yeshivah if it was mutar to have a carvel turkey cake for the siyum on Thanksgiving? R' Dovid smiled and said \"What about Cholov Yisroel?\" The man answered: \"Rebbe is the master of the place! We can rely on your father's heter.\" R' Dovid smiled and answered: \"I'm not the master of everyone's mouth?!\". (Everyone burst out laughing.)</p>\n\n<p>So of course we had a siyum with only Cholov Yisroel products. I have always seen that among the greatest people, they always try to accommodate other people's needs, even when it comes to making them comfortable about their chumras.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the real reason that asking departed tzadikim to pray for us is not considered \"beseeching the dead\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Devarim 18:11 we are forbidden to beseech the dead. However, there is a long Jewish tradition of visiting the graves of tzadikim who have died and asking that the tzadikim petition G-d on our behalf. Every time I look for an explanation of why this is permissible, I read something different. (For example, that a Jew may serve as an intermediary between another Jew and G-d; that our conversation with the tzaddik is understood as unilateral and therefore is not \"beseeching\"; that we are only asking G-d to have mercy on us for the sake of the tzadikim; and many other miscellaneous explanations, such as the handful listed <a href=\"http://dev.dinonline.org/2012/01/18/prayer-at-kivrei-tzaddikim-why/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.) All this seems a bit like we're trying to explain away a practice we just really, really want to do and have a tradition of doing, despite the fact that it is is prohibited by Torah. So, what is the \"canonical\" explanation for why one may beseech a dead Jewish tzaddik, if indeed one may?</p>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34430/speaking-to-a-deceased-person\">Speaking to a deceased person</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The most simple answer to the question as formulated here is that even praying directly to a dead person would appear to not be in violation of 'beseeching the dead' as defined by the <em>Gemara</em>. See <em>Sanhedrin</em> 65b where it defines the prohibition as referring to fasting and sleeping in a cemetery in order to attain an impure spirit (this is explained by the commentators as either an attempt to receive help from a demon, or to receive information regarding the future from the spirit of a dead person). This is also how the prohibition is defined by <em>Rambam</em> (<em>M.T. Avodat Kochavim</em> 11:13 and <em>Sefer Hamitzvot L.T.</em> 38) and <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> Y.D. 179:13.</p>\n\n<p>(However, this prohibition is not the only potential issue - there is also the problem of praying to an intermediary, which is a separate concern. And there are a few <em>Achronim</em> who do mention 'beseeching the dead' as being relevant. So not only are there multiple explanations for permissibilty, there are also multiple explanations for why it should be prohibited in the first place! </p>\n\n<p>Practically speaking there are two camps: those who say you cannot ask the dead to pray on your behalf, but should rather daven in the <em>zchut</em> of the deceased <em>tzaddik</em>, and those who permit asking the <em>tzaddik</em> to pray on your behalf. No one, however, permits davening to the tzaddik that <strong>he</strong> help you instead of God. </p>\n\n<p>I strongly recommend seeing <em>Minchas Elazar</em> 1:68 for a lengthy and in-depth discussion about all this.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As the first answer in the linked question at the end of your question says one way communication does not violate the verse</p>\n\n<p>See rambam<br>\n<a href=\"http://chabad.org/912370/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishneh Torah »Sefer Madda » Avodat Kochavim Chapter Eleven - halacha 13</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Who is one who seeks [information] from the dead? A person who starves himself and goes to sleep in a cemetery so that a deceased person will come to him in a dream and reply to his questions. There are others who wear special clothes, recite incantations, burn a particular type of incense, and sleep alone so that a deceased person will come to them and speak to them in a dream. <strong>To summarize: Anyone who performs a deed in order that a deceased person should come to him and give him information is [liable</strong> for] lashes, as [Deuteronomy 18:10] states: \"There shall not be found among you one who passes..., one who seeks [information] from the dead.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The idea that we pray to Hashem and not to the dead is not regarding your verse,<br>\nbut regarding prayer, that we do not pry to other entities</p>\n\n\n",

For, if it weren't for the fact that people fear the government (afraid of breaking the law), people would swallow up each other (there would be anarchy without laws.)</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, fulfillment of this rule (praying for the government) is performed in many shuls on Shabbat morning in a special prayer for the welfare of the government, commonly recited after the Haftarah service.</p>\n\n<p>While I know that there are various versions of this prayer, a common form of the prayer said in the U.S. is the first prayer listed <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5014bdedc4aa0c0d03276ddd/t/52a1204ce4b0ddb90964c55f/1386291276744/Prayer+for+the+Welfare+of+the+Government.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which is transliterated.</p>\n\n<p>In it, there is a phrase:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>hu yevarekh, ve-yishmor, ve-ya’azor, vi-romem, vi-gadel, vi-nasei\n  lema’la et ha-nasi, ve-et mishneihu, ve-et kol sarei ha-aretz ha-zot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Loose translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He shall bless, watch, assist, exalt, magnify and raise to prominence\n  the president, vice president and all the officers of this country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Should such phrasing or any similar prayer that implies blessings and protection of the government be recited when the government is evil and encourages murder or consistent human suffering? For example, if the government were similar to the Natzi regime or Jews lived in constant fear of going to shuls because of government prohibitions on such activities, does Rav Chanania's adage apply?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rav Chanania lived during the time of the Roman Empire and it was referred to as \"the Evil Empire\". In spite of that, the point that he was making was that any government no matter how tyrannical would still be better than complete anarchy (as existed before the flood). Such a government would enforce rules to keep itself in power and not allow robbery murder and looting.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is Czarist Russia which was evil but the Jews in that empire still prayed for the Czar. Of course they also prayed that the officials would learn the correct way of behaving and be moved to act properly.</p>\n\n<p>Note <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16026#v=7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 29:7</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ז וְדִרְשׁוּ אֶת שְׁלוֹם הָעִיר אֲשֶׁר הִגְלֵיתִי אֶתְכֶם שָׁמָּה\n  וְהִתְפַּלְלוּ בַעֲדָהּ אֶל יְהֹוָה כִּי בִשְׁלוֹמָהּ יִהְיֶה לָכֶם\n  שָׁלוֹם:</p>\n  \n  <p>7 And seek the peace of the city where I have exiled you and pray for\n  it to the Lord, for in its peace you shall have peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another point is that when they are actively attempting to kill us then they must be resisted and we must pray to Hashem to defeat them. However, that is not the circumstance that R' Chanania was speaking about.</p>\n\n\n",

All the more so, it would be permissible to enter a situation where the sin itself is not guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<p>There is a general principle in halakha, stated in the Tosefta Shabbat (9:22), that nothing supersedes the protection of life:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם היה דבר של סכנה אין כל דבר עומד בפני פקוח נפש </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only exception to this is in the case of cardinal sins (ibid 15:17):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דין הוא שידחו את השבת להחיות נפש בספק הא לא נתנו מצות לישראל אלא לחיות בהן שנ' אשר יעשה אותם האדם וחי בהם וחי בהן ולא שימות בהן אין כל דבר עומד בפני פקוח נפש חוץ מע\"ז וגלוי עריות ושפיכות דמים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is quoted by the Talmud as well (Yoma 82a), and the resultant law is codified by Rambam (Hilkhot Ma'akhalot Assurot (14:4) and Hilkhot Sh'vitat Assor 2:9) and the Shulhan Arukh (OH 617:2).</p>\n\n<p>As is implied by the language above, even mere danger to life; not just certain death, allows one to violate any non-cardinal sin. This is also the implication of the Mishna Yoma (8:6) that one violates the Sabbath, even when this will not guarantee a life being saved, such as in a case where the victim may already be dead.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit: This has been getting a lot of commentless downvotes, so it could be it wasn't clear enough. To further clarify: it is pretty much impossible to prove the negative. If someone asks whether he may eat non-kosher food to save a life... <em>On Tuesday</em>, then if answer is 'yes', because the day of the week is not significant, then by definition there will be no sources that answer the question, and the best one will be able to do, is find general sources that omit the distinction. Similarly, here the OP introduces the possibility of a new legal category in the realm of yehareg v'al ya'avor; \"irreligious\". AFAIK this category does not exist as a relevant variable in the realm of <em>yehareg v'al ya'avor</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Given that there is no evidence that \"irreligious\" is a discrete halakhic category in the realm of cardinal sins, halakhically, it is just the composite of multiple sins. Thus, the best possible answer quotes the classical sources and notes the universal ruling of ya'avor v'al yehareg for <strong>all</strong> non-cardinal sins, with no exceptions made for sins on Tuesdays, or the \"sin\" of being irreligious.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the comments,there is a category of <em>sh'mad</em>, which has specific parameters, in the realm of yehareg v'al ya'avor, but being \"irreligious\" is not sh'mad.</p>\n\n\n",

These two elements are not mutually exclusive, so it is not true that everyone is \"<strong>just</strong> going to suffer forever\". The question projects human cognitive distortions onto souls in the afterlife, namely that if there is some negative aspect or pain then that overshadows all the positive which is then discounted and not enjoyed.

For\n  instance, the angel who obstructs Bilaam’s progress is described as a\n  satan (Bamidbar 22:22), and the captains of the Philistines are afraid\n  that if David fights by their side he will not be an ally but rather a\n  satan, an opponent (Shmuel I 29:4).</p>\n  \n  <p>But many times we find it has a more specific meaning: an angel who is\n  specially designated by God to act as a prosecuting attorney when He\n  judges men (Zekharya 3:2, Iyov 1,2). Although God already knows all of\n  our thoughts and actions, Divine judgment is described to us in\n  Scripture as following equitable and transparent procedures, with\n  advocates making claims and counterclaims, in order to educate us that\n  this judgment it is not arbitrary but rather fair and balanced.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the Talmud, we find an additional dimension: Satan is sometimes\n  presented not merely as an accuser, but also as a tempter, someone who\n  confronts our righteousness with trials in order to test us.</p>\n  \n  <p>While we certainly try to avoid Satan and his judgment and adhere\n  stead- fastly to the mitzvot, the Gemara also teaches us that we have\n  to respect his mission which is after all a necessary part of the\n  administration of justice in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I would like to know is: Does the word satan mean tempter (one who tempts) besides its possible meaning of adversary; prosecutor, accuser, or hinderer, and is there a common denominator between these kinds of translations? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>'The word 'satan' means 'adversary' and is derived from the verb 'satan' ('to lie in wait'). The word \"Satan\" is used 24 times in the Tanakh. In Job (1:6 f) and Zec (3:1 f) it has the prefixed definite article. In all cases but one when the article is omitted it is used in a general sense. This one exception is 1Ch 21:1 (compare 2Sa 24:1), where the word is generally conceded to be used as a proper name. . . .' Only in the Christians' New Testament does the term 'Tempter' as a proper name for Satan occur and there only twice (Matthew 4:5; I Thessalonians 3:5). (Louis Matthews Sweet in <em>International Standard Bible Encyclopedia</em>.) The term the Tempter is not connected etymologically with Satan.</p>\n\n\n",

And that on the contrary, others should see you and learn from you. He only adds that this should be done lishma - for the sake of heaven with pure intentions. But that one should not be worried about others opinions of you.</p>\n\n<p>Though the above Gr”a is not a unanimously agreed upon opinion. I personally have seen many great Scholars learning at the chuppa/other Smachot so as not to waste time, perhaps there actions were based on the Gr”a. The Gedolim that I have personally witnessed are:</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Sternbuch Shlit”a</p>\n\n<p>Rav Asher Arieli Shlit”a</p>\n\n<p>Rav Avigdor Nevenzahl Shlit”a</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yitzchok Berkowitz Shlit”a</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the feelings of the  chosson and kallah I think that is very subjective and one cannot presume their feelings. Some may appreciate that people are using their time wisely. Furthermore, it also depends on how conspicuous you are eg. is the book a pocket Sefer that may not be noticed? Or is it a large book that is noticeable to many? Are you standing in the back or in the front? Are you reading out loud or quietly reading? Maybe people will assume you are reading Tehillim, which is very common nowadays to give out parts of sefer tehillim to be said for the zchus of the chosson and kallah</p>\n\n<p>Rav Henoch Leibowitz Zt\"l, the Rosh Yeshiva of Chofetz Chaim, in a Hashkafa Shmuess in 1993 said that to learn from a sefer during the Chuppa would be a problem of Yuhara - Overt Haughtiness. Thus he suggests bringing a small inconspicuous sefer to learn from so as not to arouse attention. If this is not possible, one should try to think in learning.</p>\n\n\n",

But bediavad the beracha is good enough. You need to bless lechatechilla after leaving the bathroom.</p>\n<p><strong>Berachot 24b:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאמר רבה בר בר חנה א\"ר יוחנן בכל מקום מותר להרהר בדברי תורה חוץ מבית המרחץ ומבית הכסא</p>\n<p>Rabbah B'Bar Hanah has said in the name of R'Johanan: In every place it is permitted to meditate on words of Torah except in the bath and in a privy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>25b:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאמר רב יוסף בר חנינא בית הכסא שאמרו אע\"פ שאין בו צואה ובית המרחץ שאמרו אע\"פ שאין בו אדם</p>\n<p>The din apply even if there is nobody in the  bathroom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mishna Berura OC 84 sk 3:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל בית הפנימי שכולם עומדים שם ערומים ורוחצין שם הוא מאוס טפי ולכו\"ע דינו כבית הכסא</p>\n<p>The place in which people are naked and wash is disgusting and has a din of bet hakise (note I wrote a din)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>sk 4:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל לא וכו' וכן כל הברכות וד\"ת אסור שם. ומשמע מדברי הט\"ז דבדיעבד אם בירך שם אינו חוזר ומברך וכן בק\"ש אין חוזר וקורא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  if in the bathroom there is no separated areas all the bathroom is Cheder Hapnimi and is prohibited for blessing and learning Tora.  Bediavad if he already blessed the bracha is good and he must not repeat.  There are several details in poskim in siman 84.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanations:</strong> In poskim we found two reasons, the first, because people there are naked (prohibition to bless in front of Erva), the second because of the dirt and hot vapour level (prohibition to bless and to think divre torah even in silent thinking). An issue is the question: Can a woman bless in the Mikve room? If the place is cold and without vapours<sup>(1)</sup>. Taz ruled that she need to bless in the Mikve room, and count it as a is a Bediavad beracha, because of the fear of hefsek if she bless outside of the mikve. Then she need to bless in the place of the Mikve, even in the Mikne itself.</p>\n<p>There are bathroom with a door separating two areas, a \"whasing area\" in which water is splashed, and there is vapors, and from which is protected the \"non washing area\", protected from vapors and soiled water. In this conditions, there is lich'ora no problem to bless in \"non washing area\".</p>\n<p>For Bet Hakise, the problem is linked with the cleanliness level of the place. If people leave generally the toilet bowl clean and the floor is also cleaned regularly, there is no permanent bad smell, theoretically there is no longer din of Bet Hakise. If there are clay pipes (e.g. from the top floor appartment) in the room, perhaps may be a din of Avit Shel Tsoa and me raglayim. But the issue of bet hakisse is not needed for the OP.</p>\n<p><sup>(1)</sup> <strong>Kesef Mishne on Rambam Ahava, Kriat Shema, 3, 3, quoted Rabenu Manoach:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכתב ה\"ר מנוח וא\"ד דכיון דאיסור מרחץ <strong>מפני שעומדים שם ערומים</strong> ה\"ה להני מקואות שטובלות בהם הנשים אסור לברך או לקרות בתוכו ולא מסתבר דעיקר איסור המרחץ אינו אלא <strong>משום איסור זוהמא והבלא</strong> דאית ביה על ידי שתשמישו בחמין אבל הני מקואות שהמים שלהן צוננין ליכא זוהמא ומותר וצ\"ע דהא לענין מזוזה בית הטבילה כבית המרחץ עכ\"ל: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>See <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x655\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peri Megadim</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>The water from the bathroom for netilat Yadaym,</strong> see SA OC 160, 4; Bach 160, See Kaf Hachayim 4, sk 10-11:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכ\"ש בשתה מהן חזיר וכיוצא בהן שנמאסין בעיני רובא דעלמא</p>\n<p>If the water are not disgusting, no problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nowadays, tap water is not disgusting.

Firstly, the snake implied that Hashem got His power from the tree, and secondly it spoke rechilut because it implied that Hashem doesn't want them to eat from the tree because then they will be like Hashem, and therefore Hashem is greedy and wants to squander this power for Himself, <em>chas veshalom</em>.</p>\n<p>He derives this from Bereshit 3:4-5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּאמֶר הַנָּחָשׁ אֶל-הָאִשָּׁה: לֹא-מוֹת תְּמֻתוּן. כִּי יֹדֵעַ\nאֱלֹהִים כִּי בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְכֶם מִמֶּנּוּ וְנִפְקְחוּ עֵינֵיכֶם\nוִהְיִיתֶם כֵּאלֹהִים, יֹדְעֵי טוֹב וָרָע</p>\n<p>The snake said to the woman: You will not surely die.

A similar case is cited in Gemara Yoma 35b.</p>\n\n<p>Yoma 35b: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמרו עליו על הלל הזקן שבכל יום ויום היה עושה ומשתכר בטרעפיק חציו היה\n  נותן לשומר בית המדרש וחציו לפרנסתו ולפרנסת אנשי ביתו פעם אחת לא מצא\n  להשתכר ולא הניחו שומר בית המדרש להכנס עלה ונתלה וישב על פי ארובה כדי\n  שישמע דברי אלהים חיים מפי שמעיה ואבטליון אמרו אותו היום ערב שבת היה\n  ותקופת טבת היתה וירד עליו שלג מן השמים כשעלה עמוד השחר אמר לו שמעיה\n  לאבטליון אבטליון אחי בכל יום הבית מאיר והיום אפל שמא יום המעונן הוא\n  הציצו עיניהן וראו דמות אדם בארובה עלו ומצאו עליו רום שלש אמות שלג\n  פרקוהו והרחיצוהו וסיכוהו והושיבוהו כנגד המדורה אמרו ראוי זה לחלל עליו\n  את השבת</p>\n  \n  <p>It was reported about Hillel the Elder that every day he used to work\n  and earn one tropaik, half of which he would give to the guard at\n  the House of Learning, the other half being spent for his food and for\n  that of his family.</p>\n  \n  <p>One day he found nothing to earn and the guard at the House of\n  Learning would not permit him to enter.</p>\n  \n  <p>He climbed up and sat upon the window, to hear the words of the\n  living God from the mouth of Shemayah and Abtalion - They say, that\n  day was the eve of Sabbath in the winter solstice and snow fell down\n  upon him from heaven.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the dawn rose, Shemayah said to Abtalion: Brother Abtalion,\n  on every day this house is light and to-day it is dark, is it perhaps\n  a cloudy day.</p>\n  \n  <p>They looked up and saw the figure of a man in the window.</p>\n  \n  <p>They went up and found him covered by three cubits of snow.</p>\n  \n  <p>They removed him, bathed and anointed him and placed him opposite the\n  fire and they said: This man deserves that the Sabbath be profaned on\n  his behalf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Conclusion, if the Shiur is audible outside the door, you can hear, but maybe that you cannot go into the bet midrash.</p>\n\n<p>An other topic is if only morally accredited students can be admitted (Berachot 28a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For Rabban Gamaliel had issued a proclamation [saying].</p>\n  \n  <p>No disciple whose character does not correspond to his exterior may\n  enter the Beth ha-Midrash.</p>\n  \n  <p>On that day many stools were added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Takeway (thanks to @DoubleAA) the Bet Midrash is entitled to set the conditions of admission to Shiur.</p>\n\n\n",

But I have heard that abortion is justified based on the permission to kill a rodef (deadly pursuer).  But it seems to me that, logically, a fetus cannot be a rodef since it is part of the mother before it emerges.  I am looking for someone to clarify the status of a fetus before it emerges (e.g., is it a person? does it have free will?) and clarify the concept of rodef as it pertains to fetus and abortion.</p>\n<p>Update: <a href=\"http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/preemb.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> is relevant but does not really grapple with the question above:</p>\n<p>Update2: We do not postpone the death penalty of a pregnant murderer. She is put to death and her fetus with her.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a great question,  I found it almost exactly in Teshuvot Geone Batrae cited bellow. and I wrote a second answer based on this  Shut. Here is  my first draft.</p>\n<p>1.Gemara <strong>Sanhedrin 57b</strong> fetus: \"the man who is within the man\" is a person:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>בן נח נהרג</strong> ....‏\nמשום רבי ישמעאל אמרו: <strong>אף על העוברין</strong> .‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the authority of R`Ishmael it was said: [He (A  Ben Noach) is executed] even for the <strong>murder of an embryo.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאי טעמיה דרבי ישמעאל? דכתיב (בראשית ט') שפך דם האדם באדם דמו ישפך, איזהו אדם שהוא באדם - הוי אומר זה עובר שבמעי אמו.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is R'Ishmael's reason? Because it is written, Whoso sheddeth the blood of man within [another] man, shall his blood be shed. What is <strong>a man within another man?</strong> - An embryo in his mother's womb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>2.Gemara <strong>Sanhedrin 72b, Mishna Ohalot 7, 6</strong>  Embryo life is less important than standard person live (the mother life and less important than the killer's life, if someone kills fetus,  he is chayav mamon to the father and not exempt as he would be by kimleh bederaba mineh if fetus killing was chayav mita) .</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב הונא קטן הרודף ניתן להצילו בנפשו קסבר רודף אינו צריך התראה לא שנא גדול ולא שנא קטן איתיביה רב חסדא לרב הונא יצא ראשו אין נוגעין בו לפי שאין דוחין נפש מפני נפש ואמאי רודף הוא שאני התם דמשמיא קא רדפי לה נימא מסייעא ליה רודף שהיה רודף אחר חבירו להורגו אומר לו ראה שישראל הוא ובן ברית הוא והתורה אמרה (בראשית ט) שופך דם שופך דם האדם באדם דמו ישפך, אמרה תורה: הצל דמו של זה בדמו של זה.  ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R'Huna said: A minor in pursuit may be slain to save the pursued. Thus he maintains that a pursuer, whether an adult or a minor, need not be formally warned. R'Hisda asked R'Huna: we learnt: Once his head has come forth, he may not be harmed, because one life may not be taken to save another. But why so?\nIs he not a pursuer? - There it is different, for she is <strong>pursued by heaven.</strong> Shall we say that the following supports him? [Viz. ,] If a man was pursuing after his fellow to slay him, he (observer) says to him, 'See, he is an Israelite, and a son of the covenant, whilst the Torah hath said, <strong>Whosoever would shed the blood of a man, [to save] that man shall his own blood be shed, meaning, save the blood of the pursued by the blood of the pursuer'!</strong> - That is based on the ruling of R'Jose son of R'Judah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>3.We learnt a two Drashot from the words \"Adam Baadam\", <strong>Adam Baadam</strong> is an fetus. The din of chiuv mita for the murder of an embryo is only for Bene Noach, Gemara 57b told about Bene Noach, Rambam ruled it for Bene Noach excluding Jews (Shoftim, Melachim, 9, 4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֶּן נוֹחַ שֶׁהָרַג נֶפֶשׁ, אַפִלּוּ עֹבֶר בִּמְעֵי אִמּוֹ--נֶהְרָג עָלָיו.  וְכֵן אִם הָרַג טְרֵפָה, אוֹ שֶׁכְּפָתוֹ וּנְתָנוֹ לִפְנֵי הָאֲרִי, אוֹ שֶׁהִנִּיחוֹ בְּרָעָב עַד שֶׁמֵּת--הוֹאִיל וְהֵמִית מִכָּל מָקוֹם, נֶהְרָג.  וְכֵן אִם הָרַג רוֹדֵף שֶׁיָּכוֹל לְהַצִּילוֹ בְּאֶחָד מֵאֵבָרָיו--נֶהְרָג עָלָיו, <em><strong>מַה שְׁאֵין כֵּן בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל</strong></em> .‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>4.In Sanhedrin 72b <strong>Baadam</strong> is for the \"by the man (the rodef would be killed by a man)\".</p>\n<p>5.the two drashot regard two different cases,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The murder of an fetus.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>the status of a fetus before it emerges [sic] is it a person?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>--> yes</strong></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The fetus  (not the the newborn)  pursuing the mother.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>6.The fetuse's life is sufficiently similar to life to punish Ben Noach who killed it, according to the Gemara 57b (from this verse Gemara learnt also general killing prohibition in bne Noach) .</p>\n<p>7.The competition between the life of someone who already born and someone who has not yet been born is not an equal competition, two different kinds of life are compared.  You  asked in a comment</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>How does Shemot (Exodus) 21:22 fit with your answer \"murder of an embryo\"? (Shemot 21:22 says, \"if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no [other] harm [to the woman] follow, he shall be surely fined,\" JPS.)</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>--></strong> The answer is the same than with the Rodef,  When the life of the murder is more valuable than the life of the dead (here the value of the life of the fetus is even less than a the life of a trefa man) there is no \"nefashot case\" not only because of edut sheyi ata yachol lehazima,  but there is no  chiuv mita. For a ben Noach there is a special stringency,  for every sin he is chayav mita.</p>\n<p><em>But I must admit that the SMA CM 425 and the Noda Bihuda CM tiniana 59, and the Teshuvot Geone Batrae agrees entirely with you.</em></p>\n<p>If the childbirth migh kill the mother, the issue of Rodef begins.</p>\n<p>if this fetus was only a piece of meat, there wouldn't be question of redifa, but the fetus has its own life,  despite that he is not separated from mother body.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>a fetus cannot be a rodef since it is part of the mother before it emerges</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>--> The Gemara in Sanhedrin 57b proofs that he is not really a piece of meat</strong></p>\n<p>The Gemara (according to Rashi's comment) said that as long as he is not born,  despite that he is an other person, the lack of  separated  life eliminate the question of choice.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Sanhedrin 72B says a fetus becomes a person when its head emerges</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>--> That's not completely right.</strong></p>\n<p>8.The lack of what you called \"free will\" of the newborn is addressed by Gemara, his birth, his existence is not a free will and his life starting is the danger, Gemara called  this situation (after the head exit  but this is right even in the previous step) משמיא קא רדפי לה. Fetus (and new born)  has no free will and they said Mishamaya Kararadfe lah.  He is compelled to go out. Before head emergency, he has no independent life, this lack of separate life makes the superiority of the mother life beside fetus life, she has life and (mother life which is separated  life  is greater than  non separated (from mother)  life)</p>\n<p>9.Parenthesis concerning <strong>\"mishmaya karadfe lah\" :</strong>  For  instance,  idiocy is a lack of free will, which constitute a ptor in mitsvot for the idiot,  but not for a rodef who is idiot, I wanted only to say that this \"free will\" is not fully contrary of mishmaya karadfey lah.  A kind of will is referred by this expression,  not \"full  will\",  but a multitude of  possibilities. An idiot who pursues someone will be killed. But here the new born cannot,  even randomly, make something else.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>the status of a fetus before it emerges [sic] does it have free will?)</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>--> Not only he hasn't free will, but he also is not a Rodef</strong> he is just pushed. His redifa is not a real redifa after the maskana of the Gemara, because he also is pushed, \"mishamaya Karadfe leih\". <strong>But the Hava Amina of the Gemara was that there is no nuance between an idiot or a child who is pursuing someone with a gun.</strong> In maskana he is not a Rodef and there is no proof against Rav Huna. Despite the strange formulation of the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=32854&rid=12271\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, nezikin, rotseach 1, 9</a>, who cited the word rodef for a fetus, Acharonim explained that this was not precisely his intent, see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1558&st=&pgnum=71&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvot Geone Batrae 45</a> cited by the Leshed Hashemen in Rambam</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion,</strong>  Fetus has life, it is prohibited to kill it, Bene Noach are sentenced to death for this sin but not Jews. Concerning Rodef, the fetus-rodef's life is less valuable than the mother life which is already a separate life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This seems to be a dispute between Rashi and Rambam.</p>\n\n<p>According to Rashi (Sanhedrin 72b DH Yatza Rosho), the fetus is not considered a separate entity.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יצא ראשו - באשה המקשה לילד ומסוכנת וקתני רישא החיה פושטת ידה וחותכתו ומוציאתו לאברים דכל זמן שלא יצא לאויר העולם לאו נפש הוא וניתן להורגו ולהציל את אמו אבל יצא ראשו אין נוגעים בו להורגו דהוה ליה כילוד ואין דוחין נפש מפני נפש</p>\n  \n  <p>\"If its head came out\" – regarding a woman who is having difficulty giving birth and is in danger. The first section teaches, \"The midwife sticks out her hand and cuts [the fetus] and brings it out as limbs,\" for so long as it has not come out to the air of the world it is not a soul, and it can be given over to kill it and save its mother. However, \"if its head came out, we do not touch it\" to kill it, because it is like it is born, and \"we do not push off one soul for another.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam (Rotzeiach 1:9), on the other hand, seems to learn the first clause differently from Rashi. Rather than saying you can kill the fetus because it is not a person, he explicitly connects this halacha to those regarding killing someone who is trying to kill someone else.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַף זוֹ מִצְוַת לֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁלֹּא לָחוּס עַל נֶפֶשׁ הָרוֹדֵף. לְפִיכָךְ הוֹרוּ חֲכָמִים שֶׁהָעֻבָּרָה שֶׁהִיא מַקְשָׁה לֵילֵד מֻתָּר לַחְתֹּךְ הָעֵבָּר בְּמֵעֶיהָ בֵּין בְּסַם בֵּין בְּיָד מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוּא כְּרוֹדֵף אַחֲרֶיהָ לְהָרְגָהּ.</p>\n  \n  <p>Also this is a negative commandment, not to have mercy on the soul of a pursuer. Therefore, the Sages ruled that a pregnant woman who has difficulty giving birth – it is permissible to cut up the fetus in her innards, whether with medicine or by hand, because he is like one who is pursuing after her to kill her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even the Rambam, though, seems to be unclear on this point; while he explicitly connects this case to one of a pursuer, he does say that the fetus is only <em>like</em> one who is pursuing her, not one who <em>is</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=11&hilchos=68&perek=1&halocha=9&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides</a> is the earliest source (I know of) that directly connects the principle of <em>rodef</em> to the leniency regarding feticide in order save the life of the mother:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף זו מצות לא תעשה שלא לחוס על נפש הרודף. לפיכך הורו חכמים שהעוברה\nשהיא מקשה לילד מותר לחתוך העובר במיעיה. בין בסם בין ביד מפני שהוא\nכרודף אחריה להורגה. ואם משהוציא ראשו אין נוגעין בו שאין דוחין נפש מפני\nנפש וזהו טבעו של עולם:</p>\n<p>This too is a biblical prohibition - to not have mercy on the soul of a pursuer (i.e. it is forbidden to have mercy on a pursuer).  Therefore the Sages instructed that (in the case of) a pregnant women having a life-threatening labor, it is permitted to cut the fetus in her innards. Whether with a chemical or by hand, for it is similar to one who is pursuing her to kill her.  And if his head has already emerged, one is not allowed to touch him for it is not allowed to push (i.e. chose) one life over another, and this (i.e. the threat to the mother's life) is the nature of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From his language it is fairly clear that he is not entirely equating the two concepts.  Arguably, he is emphasizing a parallel between the two cases based on the underlying basis for why we generally do not kill to save a life.  In the case of murdering another to save oneself, the Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.74a.44?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 74a</a>) records:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סברא הוא דההוא דאתא לקמיה דרבה ואמר ליה אמר לי מרי דוראי זיל קטליה לפלניא ואי לא קטלינא לך אמר ליה לקטלוך ולא תיקטול מי יימר דדמא דידך סומק טפי דילמא דמא דהוא גברא סומק טפי</p>\n<p>It is common sense. Even as one who came before Raba and said to him, 'The governor of my town has ordered me, \"Go and kill so and so; if not, I will slay thee\"'. He answered him, 'Let him rather slay you than that you should commit murder; who knows that your blood is redder? Perhaps his blood is redder.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Arguably, this logic does not apply neither in the case of the <em>rodef</em> (because of his chosen state) nor in that of the dangerous pregnancy (because of his incomplete state).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it seems pretty clear that abortion is within the general rubric of murder, albeit of a lesser degree.  See e.g. how the Talmud, when discussing the basic Noahide laws (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.57b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 57b</a>), infers the prohibition from within the language of the prohibition of regular murder</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משום רבי ישמעאל אמרו אף על העוברין מאי טעמיה דרבי ישמעאל דכתיב (בראשית ט, ו) שופך דם האדם באדם דמו ישפך איזהו אדם שהוא באדם הוי אומר זה עובר שבמעי אמו</p>\n<p>In the name of Rabbi Yishmael it was said: [A Noachide may be put to death] even for the killing of a fetus. What is Rabbi Yishmael’s source? For it is written, “One who spills the blood of a person shall have his own blood spilled by another person [literally read: one who spills the blood of a person inside another person etc.].” (Bereishit 9:6). Which person is inside another person? This is referring to the fetus in the mother’s womb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See Igroth Moshe, Choshen Mishpat 2:69; I.Y.

But most of them do not seem to care about chometz on their lawns. (Exception: Some authorities do rule that one should check one's garden for chometz, especially if they have little kids. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/31534/rabbi-kaii\">[Source.]</a>)</p>\n<p>I recently asked someone why most people don't care about chometz on their lawns.

You may not store chametz on your lawn over Pesach, just like in your house. However, we must understand why we check our homes in the first place. We can then see the difference when it comes to lawns, which do not need checking (as well as why we empty bird feeders anyway).</p>\n<p>Earlier on, page 6b <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.6b.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>: When we search, we need to nullify the chametz (declare it ownerless and like dirt) as well. The Gemara asks: Why? If it's about crumbs, who cares? They are worthless anyway, and need no nullification at all. So we say that maybe (by accident on Pesach) we will find a \"gluska yaffa\" (tasty morsel of cake or challah) and want to keep it even for a moment. So we need to nullify it all beforehand, so that at the moment you find it, it is already nullified. (Rashi)</p>\n<p>However, it is obvious that larger amounts of chametz (greater in size than a stray gluska yaffa) will be removed or sold beforehand. Those things won't be missed easily. What are we searching for with our candle and feather? That stray pretzel which fell behind the couch. :)</p>\n<p>In your backyard, you can assume that such random tasty morsels of goodness will be quickly eaten by birds. But a large sack of chametz flour left in the backyard still must be removed or sold! You must check your backyard (without a candle and feather) for such items, unless you never store such things there all year anyway.</p>\n<p>That is why bird feeders must be cleaned out, if you use chametz feed. You are not searching by candlelight for a crack in the bird feeder that may contain some tiny crumbs. But you did deposit a large blob of chametz into the feeder yesterday, which was too big for the birds to finish off so quickly. Therefore, you must go back and discard the blob.</p>\n<p>Another reason some people strictly remove even small crumbs of chametz (an optional stringency) is this: The crumbs may find their way into food in the kitchen, or a baby may find and eat one Cheerio on the floor. On Pesach, a tiny crumb of chametz, even if it falls into a huge vat of food, renders the entire vat forbidden. So there is an extra stringency to clean such crumbs found in the kitchen / dining-room area. Still, we can assume that crumbs in your lawn will become disgusting, and will not make it to the kitchen anyway, even by accident.</p>\n\n\n",

He was asked if a Chazzan who actually said למלשינים aloud needs to be removed as a suspected heretic, and is unsure but leans towards yes if he refuses to recite the traditional version even when asked to. This is quoted by the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14597&st=&pgnum=35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keneset HaGedola</a> who in turn is quoted by the Magen Avraham (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x490\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">126:1</a>).

So if a prophet had the ability to bring people back from the dead (or even create life), would that make him something greater than a prophet?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>He would be a prophet through whom God worked a miracle.  In fact, this happened with the prophet Elisha, as recorded in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b04.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim II 4</a>.  Elisha had told a Shunammite woman who had treated him very kindly that she would have a son.  She did, and then the boy died.  She cried to Elisha, who ran to her house, closed himself in the room with the dead boy, <em>prayed to God</em>, and brought the boy back to life.  It is clear that it is <em>God</em> who did the reviving, through Elisha.  The prophet did not \"have the ability\" to bring the dead back to life; it wasn't his decision or his action.  It was his prayer/plea.  There is a similar incident with Eliyahu in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a17.htm#22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim I 17:22</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1237.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 37</a> the prophet Yechezkel (Ezekiel) prophesies, at God's command, to the dry bones, and they are reanimated and brought to life -- but it is God doing the reanimating.  Yechezkel doesn't have the power to do this independently; God used him as His vehicle for producing the miracle.</p>\n\n<p>Elisha, Eliyahu, and Yechezkel are prophets, same as many others.  They don't have any additional, special status by having been involved in these miracles.  They have no power to bestow life.  No man does.</p>\n\n<p>One might argue that in fact God has never raised the dead through a prophet -- that the people raised through Elisha and Eliyahu hadn't really died but merely fainted, and that Yechezkel saw a vision and not an actual resurrection.  Even if all that were the case, the answer would not change: <em>people</em> don't create life; <em>God</em> does.  That we have these prophetic events in our history reinforces that idea, but if you were to say that the incidents didn't actually happen that way, that wouldn't falsify our understanding.</p>\n\n\n",

However, nowhere does the Gemara describe them as being hidden. What is the original source for the notion that their righteousness is a secret?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Great question, your absolutely correct, that from the Gemora in Suka there is no indexation of them, of even some of them being hidden.</p>\n<p>However, there is a similar Gemora in <code>Chullin 92a</code>, but over there the sages tell us that their are 45 Tzadikim in the world. Some in Eret Yisroel and some in the diaspora.\nFrom that Gemora it seems that we learn that the majority of them are indeed hidden:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר אביי ורובייהו משתכחי בבי כנישתא דתותי אפתא</p>\n<p>Abaye said: And most of the fifteen righteous individuals in Babylonia\nare found in the synagogue under the upper room.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ben Yehoyoda over there clarifies that this is the intention of the Gemora, to be relevant in our days as well, not only giving us a fact about the Tzadikim in Abayes time.</p>\n<p>To paraphrase his words:\nTherefore if one was to go looking for the Tzadikim of the generation trying to enumerate them, he won't necessarily find them amongst the famous, respected \"Gedolim\", rather he will likely find the majority of them sitting in humility in Shuls.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the בני יששכר Nissan 2:5 he says that the tzadikim in each generation are hidden, sometimes being woodchoppers or water carriers;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש לפרש. דרצו לדרוש. החדש הזה לכם ראש וכו' מהו לכם. לגם כל הענין כפל. דהרי כתוב מבואר אח\"כ ראשון הוא לכם. ע\"כ דרש דהש\"י הראה למשה סימן שכבר נשלם הגלות. והסימן הוא. מיד גילו הצדיקים את ראשיהם. <strong>דהנה בכל דור ודור יש צדיקים גדולים יכולים לפעול פעולות נוראות. אבל הוא כשהדור אינו ראוי לכך. כל מדריגת הצדיקים הם באיתכסייא. ואינם נודעים בשם ובאפשר הם לפעמים חוטבי עצים ושואבי מים וכיוצא בשארי ענינים.</strong> וכמ\"ש בגמ' שיצאה להם ב\"ק יש בכם אחד שהוא ראוי שתשרה עליו שכינה וכו' אלא שאין דורו ראוי לכך. כיון שהוא בחשכות הגלות בכל דור ודור בימי גלותינו. וכן היה במצרים ודאי הוה בהם צדיק' גדולים. <strong>וכמו שאמרז\"ל אין לך דור שלא יהא בו כאברהם וכו'</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last reference to the Chazal about every generation having Tzaddikim like Avrohom Avinu is referring to the Medrash Bereishis Rabba Parsha 35 mentioned in my comment earlier;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Hezekiah in the name of Rabbi Jeremiah said: \"So spoke Rabbi Shimon son of Yochai: \"The world is not able to stand <strong>except by thirty men righteous like Abraham our father.</strong> If thirty, I and my son are two from them. If twenty, I and my son are two from them. If ten, I and my son are two from them. If five, I and my son are two from them. If two, I and my son are they.

What about a mother tying or adjusting, or putting on or taking off, her children's shoes -- something which probably happens at least twenty times a day for a mother with several little ones?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are two possible Halachic reasons why we should wash our hands after touching shoes. </p>\n\n<p>1) There is a mystical reason. An evil spirit rests on shoes. This is connected with the verse Gen. 3:17 \"...cursed is the ground because of you...\". Therefore, shoes which are the focal point for touching the ground (and feet) causes a bad spirit to rest on the hands that touch them. (see Kaf HaChaim 4: 60; 70-71; Shulchan Aruch HaRav; Rav Ovadiah Yosef)</p>\n\n<p>2) Shoes (and feet; some say sweaty dirty socks too) usually touch the ground and become dirty from inside with sweat and outside with dirt of all kind. Therefore, touching them requires handwashing by Halachah due to an obligation of physical cleanliness. There is no mystical issue. (see Shaarei Teshuvah and Mishneh Berurah on 4:18.)</p>\n\n<p>The Poskim bring both opinions and many are lenient to assume it is only due to cleanliness. One thing seems clear though. The shoes are a problem even if they are someone else's and even if they are not currently being worn(Pischei Teshuvos 4:22). A partial hand touch seems to be enough to cause a problem too (Kaf HaChaim 4:64).</p>\n\n<p>One thing is clear though. There is only an absolute <strong>obligation to wash if you are going to pray or learn Torah or be involved with some other davar sheh'b'kedushah.</strong> (of course, sticking your hand into that bag of chips wouldn't be advisable either. :) )</p>\n\n<p>True, some advocate that we are still worried about the mystical reason. So, according to them, there is a benefit in washing right away, (to quickly remove the evil spirit) even if you don't plan to daven etc. until much later. But if not for the mystical reason, then all washing in Shulchan Aruch is for cleanliness before kedusha, like prayer.</p>\n\n<p>But, if the octo-mom is busy multi-tasking or running a daycare, it seems she can rely on the opinions that only require her to wash when needed for something like davening or eating.</p>\n\n<p>There are also the following leniencies proposed by many Poskim: (But, there are those who argue to be strict anyway.)</p>\n\n<p>a) New shoes (or very clean shoes; if we don't worry about evil spirit)) should be OK. (No evil spirit from the ground, no dirt either) So trying on shoes in a shoe store is not going to cause a handwashing. (Sdei Chemed, Chalitzah:2)</p>\n\n<p>b) Shoes that were never once worn outside have not touched the ground. Therefore there is no evil spirit. However, cleanliness could still be an issue. (see Aruch HaShulchan 4:21 Pischei Teshuvos 4:22)</p>\n\n<p>c) Shoes that are not made of leather are exempt. (see Aruch HaShulchan 4:21)(The Steipler and Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach discuss if this is accepted or not.)</p>\n\n<p>d) Shoe laces and the tops of boots are exempt. (Pischei Teshuvos 4:22 note 215; on boots) Chazon Ish, Rav Shlomo Zalman Aurbach; Halichos Shlomo Tefilah, 20:18, Rav Ovadiah Yosef; Yabia Omer 5:1 about laces.</p>\n\n<p>e) Clean baby feet should be exempt. Your own clean feet should be OK (if you ignore the evil spirit issue too)</p>\n\n<p>f) You only need to wash the hand that touched the shoe. (see Kaf HaChaim 4:86)</p>\n\n<p>g) You only need to wash once with water. (not 3 times if you are not worried about the evil spirit) This can be accomplished by putting the hand under the faucet (no negel vasser cup needed). (Rav Ovadiah Yosef)</p>\n\n<p>h) If you have no water, you can rub your hands off on something that has friction to remove dirt. Yeshivah bochurim are always rubbing the wood of their shtenders if their hands get ritually dirty instead of running to the sink, because they don't want to fall into the sin of bitul Torah. (losing time from study) (see Shulchan Aruch 4:22)</p>\n\n<p>i) Touching via gloves or a rag is ok. (see Kaf HaChaim 4:87)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we might invoke the merit of Count Valentine Pototski. He is also known as Avraham ben Avraham. He was a Polish noble who refused to give up his Judaism and was burned at the stake by the Church in 1749 (or Avraham ben Yitzchak in 1753??). Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach has a tradition from the Vilna Gaon that after his death, the world changed. Through his merit, a Jew no longer needs to fill negel vasser by the bed, but instead may walk to the sink in the morning; because the power of the evil spirit has been reduced globally in his merit.</p>\n\n<p>Just a thought. If that's true about one Ger Tzedek, then what about the holocaust? Would the mystics pasken that the evil spirit has been removed so that hand washing about the evil spirit on shoes (and other things) is no longer an issue either? I have not heard.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Touching the shoe :</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.otzar.org.spertus.idm.oclc.org/wotzar/Book.aspx?50960&&lang=eng&lang=eng\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shevet HaKehasi 4:2</a> brings the case of a person who sells shoes and is constantly touching shoes.

He ends the teshuvah saying that it seems that one can be lenient and one would not have to wash after touching just the laces. He also notes that Chacham Ovadia(Yabia Omer 5:1) also holds that one would not need to wash their hands in such a case.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem if you don't want to wash your hands every two seconds then just tying the laces without touching the shoe would be good enough not to require a hand washing. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Holding like the majority opinion for a d'oraita?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In cases where there is a discussion among the Rishonim/Acharonim as to whether something is forbidden from the Torah (d'oraita), is it acceptable to go in accordance with those that deem it permissible (suppose they are in the majority if it makes a difference), or must one always take the stringent view, due to being stringent on cases of doubt with regards to biblically enacted commandments (safek d'oraita l'chumra)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The OP seems to be asking about a case where one opinion says something is an issur D'Oraisa and the other opinion says it is permitted in the first place with no restriction. (There is no opinion that it is an issur D'rabbanan?)</p>\n\n<p>I have seen Halachic cases like this. Although they are rare compared to D'Oraisa/D'Rabbanan arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, (and sometimes even if the heter is a minority opinion) sometimes, some still pasken like the lenient opinion or at least rely on them in a difficult situation.</p>\n\n<p>This is because when we rely on a Rishon/Acharon as a Poseik/Rav, we are saying that the man (and his adherents, and traditions) certainly knew what he was talking about, he is correct, and we are relying on him; even if others argue. Therefore, there is no doubt involved. It is about relying.</p>\n\n<p>It is true that today, Rabbis do gravitate towards paskening to the stricter view if that view holds its a D'Oraisa. This is because the Rabbi is assuming that he himself, really is not an expert to decide with his own mind when two great authorities from the past have already weighed in. He also doesn't have a reason to pick one Rishon over the other. So, he will treat it like a safek D'Oraisa L'Chumra situation and rule in accordance with the strict opinion (or at least caution that one should try to hold by it unless its a very difficult situation). Sometimes, a community has a tradition that they always held like the lenient authority in history past, and they have a right to rely on the leniency.</p>\n\n<p>This should not be confused with the real use of the term \"Safek D'Oraisa L'Chumra\". That is applied to a situation. If a substance might have fallen into a mixture... if it was suspected to be the pork, then we are more concerned than if it may have been chicken soaked in milk.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a woman is either obligated in Birkat HaMazon D'Oraisa or D'Rabbanan. She can pick who she wishes to hold like. If she picks D'Oraisa, then if she has a doubt about having recited bentching, she may need to repeat it. If she had chosen D'Rabbanan, then she would not. (The benefit of her choosing to say she is obligated D'Oraisa, is that now she can recite it for a man and he has fulfilled his obligation.)</p>\n\n<p>Picking the Halachic opinion is up to her. That is a choice, not a \"safek\". A situation of \"safek\" is then resolved based on the choice.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See e.g. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=81&perek=1&halocha=5&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hilkhoth Mamrim</em> 1:5</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שני חכמים או שני בתי דינין שנחלקו שלא בזמן הסנהדרין או עד שלא היה הדבר ברור להן, בין בזמן אחד בין בזה אחר זה, אחד מטהר ואחד מטמא אחד אוסר ואחד מתיר אם אינך יודע להיכן הדין נוטה. בשל תורה הלך אחר המחמיר בשל סופרים הלך אחר המיקל: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Two sages or two courts that argue (about a halachic ruling) either in a time without the Sanhedrin or while they (the Sanhedrin) are not sure of the thing (i.e. the correct ruling), whether (the disputed positions are presented) at the same time or one later than the other, one declares <em>tahor</em> (ritually clean) and one <em>tameh</em> (ritually unclean), (or) one allows and one prohibits, if you do not know which way the law leans, in a biblical (issue) follow the stringent view (and) in a Rabbinic issue, follow the lenient view.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In general, the rule \"<em>safek d'oraytha l'chumra</em>\" (uncertainties in Biblical law are toward stringency), is applied in cases of \"<em>safek hashakul</em>\" (halachically equiprobable uncertainties).

(I assume that he did  not yet know the Tosfot Yom Tov,  who is +/- contemporaneous). I will give an exact quote below.  Anyway,  it seems that he see limud hatalmud as understanding the Mishna and to reach the Halacha results from Mishna and Gemara together.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולעולם הוי רץ למשנה יותר מן התלמוד ומכל שכן האידנא שזכירו לפירוש הרמב\"ם והרב ברטנור\"ה שמבארים המשנה כפי ההסכמה שבתלמוד וגם כתבו פסק ההלכה הרי  מעלת המשנה רבה כי מה שאמרו תחילה תלמוד אין לך מידה גדולה הימנו כי גירסת המשנה בלא תלמוד לא יגיעהו לתכלית  המכוון ללמד חוק ומשפט בישראל שאם לא ידע טעמי הדבר פעמים ידמה דבר לשאינו דומה ויורה הוראות טעות ועל זה אמרו במסכת סוטה פרק ג' תנאים מבלי עולם הן וכי במבלי עולם הן והלא מיושבי עולם הן שנאמר הליכות עולם לו אלא שמורין הלכה מתוך משנתן עד כאן. אבל עתה בפירוש הרמב\"ם והרב ברטנורה מתוקן הכל. על כן רוב העסקו יהיה במשניות ללמוד ולחזור אותם בלי ערך ובלי הפסק  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>(2)</sup> Someone argued that I wrote my own conclusion instead the conclusion of the quotes. If it is not the intent of the Rambam, it is the conclusion of the commentary <strong>Avodat Hamelech</strong> after learning the Rambam. The source is a <strong>Rashi in Succa 28b,</strong> who explained <strong>the word Talmud</strong> (Gemara after the censorship):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גמרא. זו היא סברא שהיו התנאים אחרונים מדקדקים בדברי הראשונים הסתומים לפרשם וליתן בהן טעם כמו שעשו האמוראים אחר התנאים שפירשו דברי התנאים שלפניהן וקבעו בהן גמרא ואותו דיוק שבימי התנאי' נקרא הש''ס: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Rashi: This is reasoning, when the last tanayim were deducting from the former tanayim words, which were tight, and were explain them, to give a sense, as made Amorayim who explained the sentences of the tanayim who was before them, and this deduction which is known from the tanayim period is called Talmud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And <strong>Rashi in Berachot 5a:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זה גמרא. סברת טעמי המשניות שממנו יוצאה הוראה.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Rashi: This is Gemara (Talmud), to understand the reasoning under the mishna, from which ensue the Halacha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6714\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beur Hagra on Shulchan Aruch note number 14</a> which give a proof from the Gemara in Kiddushin 49b (this need a whole explanation, I skipped it).</p>\n\n<p>We see that a some activities with the book called Talmud are closer to the so called Mishna activity than to Talmud activity. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would guess that if one learns a Mishna in Gemara then he has fulfilled the obligation to learn Mishniyot.

A question on Berakhot 56b\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Berakhot 56b, two different reasons are brought as to why seeing a camel in one's dream is a sign of being spared from death. Both reasons are scriptural verses:</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hama bar Rabbi Hanina quotes Genesis 46:4, \"אנכי ארד עמך מצרימה ואנכי אעלך גם עלה\";</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Nahman bar Yitzhak cites 2 Samuel 12:14, \"גם ה' העביר חטאתך לא תמות\".</p>\n\n<p>As to why the first of these verses alludes to camels, Rashi states that גם עלה is close to the <em>notarikon</em> for camel (גמל), but offers no explanation for the second verse. We could assume that the reason is the same, but only if Nahman bar Yitzhak is pronouncing God's name as (something like) <em>allah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This is a pre-Islamic text, and I know of no evidence for Jews pronouncing God's name in this way at such a time, but without it the relationship between 2 Samuel 12:14 and camels is pretty hard to establish.</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible that Rabbi Nahman bar Yitzhak is making his drosh solely on the basis of the word גם?

Chazal say that  \"just as no two faces are exactly alike, so too no two people have the same knowledge and experiences in life.\" [Brochos 58a]</p>\n\n<p>That said, chidushim should be (I think) something that comes to you naturally. HaShem is speaking through you. The more you learn, daven, refine yourself, and strive to come closer to HaShem, the more you will be a conduit for novel ideas.</p>\n\n<p>So, part of the answer to your question is how much are time are you already giving to learning, davening, refining yourself, and coming closer to HaShem?</p>\n\n\n",

It should be noted that Midrashim interpret דמשק (literally Damascene) non-literally (e.g. Yoma 28b, Genesis Rabba 44:9, Midrash Agada (Buber) 15:2), which is perhaps consistent with the Midrashic identification of Eliezer with Canaan.</p>\n\n\n",

One man ran out of water and the other man has just enough water for himself to make it back to town. Should the man share his water with his friend, OR; should he use all the water for himself and let his friend die while saving his own life?</p>\n\n<p>Ben Petura says that he should share the water rather than save himself and witness his friend's death. Rabbi Akiva says that the Torah commands VaYikra 25:36 \"...your brother shall live <strong><em>with you</em></strong>...\". Therefore the man with the water saves himself since his brother's life is subordinate to his own.</p>\n\n<p>The Halachah follows R' Akiva (see Tur, Yoreh Deah, 251).</p>\n\n<p>Since the car is already hurtling forward, then certainly letting the car continue would be permitted, to avoid slamming into another deadly obstacle. You are not obligated to swerve and kill yourself in order to save your friend. (The man who stepped into the road, thereby blocking escape, may even be considered a \"rodef\". (an attacker who may be killed to save an innocent life)).</p>\n\n<p>If the person about to be hit is a greater tzadik and Torah scholar, or someone who the Jewish people rely upon, or saving them will save many lives etc. there are opinions that one may sacrifice themselves to save that person (and it might even be the better choice). <strong>However, it is not an obligation</strong>. (I have seen Poskim that reject this based on a teshuvas Radbaz. Some support it based on a Yad Eliyahu, and see further.)</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Horayos 13a says that the life of the Cohen annointed for war takes precedence. This is because the war effort depends on him.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara Ta'anis 18b (see Rashi there) praises Papus and Lolinus who falsely admitted to a murder of a princess in order to save the Jewish people from death.</p>\n\n<p>Sefer Chassidim 698 rules that it is a mitzvah for an unlearned person to sacrifice himself to save a Torah scholar. (Rebbe Reuven ben Itztraboli offered to die instead of R' Akiva)</p>\n\n<p>Mishneh Halachos (9:17) brings a case of a holy martyr who pretended to be the Belzer Rebbe and handed himself in to the Nazis in order to save the real Rebbe.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yaakov Emden (Migdal Oz Even HaBochein 1:85) holds that one is not allowed to sacrifice himself for love of a friend or even a son. (see Gemara Pesachim 25b...\"why is his blood redder than yours?!\") But he may do so for someone who he knows is a greater tzadik and Torah scholar than he is; his father or Rebbe, or one who's life certainly has much greater value. For instance, he considers if a father who is old may sacrifice himself to save a young son?</p>\n\n<p>I am not clear how one would know someone else is more valuable, even in Torah or righteousness??</p>\n\n<p>Rav Zilberstein did send a response to a man who wanted to take the job as a bodyguard for a high Israeli official. He was told that if he was sure the lives of many people depended on the official, then he could accept the job which involves jumping in front of him to take a potential bullet.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the case of the OP, I wonder if you are allowed to sacrifice yourself if the Tzadik or official blatantly jumps in front of your car knowingly??</p>\n\n<p>May we never need these answers in any practical case and continue to gain reward for learning it theoretically. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

In their words, it's \"לאפוקי מנהו דאמרי אשרי הרבה\", which either means to exclude or to exempt those who recite Ashrei many times (or those who recite many ashreis). Excluding somebody can denote marginalising them; exempting somebody can also denote allowing them to carry out a practice - like יצא in Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>What are they referring to? To put this into historical context, the tosafot recorded in this tractate are those produced in the school of Evreux, which <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> tells me flourished at the beginning of the 13th century.

In the <em>roughly</em> contemporary Machzor Vitri (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14643&pgnum=271\" rel=\"noreferrer\">89</a>), we find Psalm 145 introduced with Psalms 119:1, 119:2, 84:6, 112:1, 89:16, 84:5 (and possibly 144:15):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשרי תמימי דרך ההלכים בתרת יי: אשרי נוצרי עדותיו בכל לב ידרושוהו: אשרי אדם עוז לו מסילות בלבבם: אשרי איש ירא יי במצותיו חפץ מאד: אשרי העם יודעי תרועה יי באור פניך יהלכון:  אשרי יושבי ביתיך עוד יהללוך סלה וכו'.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il/nnl/dig/books/bk001163513.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this Romaniote Machzor (pg. 11)</a> we find just Psalms 119:1 before the familiar 84:5 and 144:15. In <a href=\"http://web.nli.org.il/sites/nli/Hebrew/library/Pages/BookReader.aspx?pid=1414197\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this Machzor from Aleppo (pg. 26)</a> we find Psalms 119:1, 119:2, Proverbs 8:34, then Psalms 84:5 and 144:15. Interestingly in light of the Gemara Tosfot commented on, in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20923&st=&pgnum=85\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this Siddur</a> from Persia we find 140:14 sandwiched between 84:5 and 144:15.</p>\n\n<p>Maharsha <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37952&st=&pgnum=280\" rel=\"noreferrer\">to that Tosfot</a> justifies the common practice of including 144:15, even though Tosfot seems to limit to just 84:5, because 144:15 is adjacent to Psalm 145. (I'm not sure I really understand that argument; Tosfot seems clear there is nothing between 84:5 and תהלה לדוד.) The Bach (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x136\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 51</a>) just accepts that the practice doesn't match Tosfot's.</p>\n\n<p>As for why Tosfot disapproves, it's not entirely clear. The Rokeiach (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49925&st=&pgnum=158\" rel=\"noreferrer\">27</a>) decries the \"French\" custom of adding Psalm 119:1 for various numerological reasons.

Said Beth Hillel to Beth Shammai, 'Did it not so happen that the elders of Beth Shammai and the elders of Beth Hillel went on a visit to R' Johanan B'Hahoranith and found him sitting with his head and greater part of his body within the sukkah while his table was in the house? ' Beth Shammai replied: From there proof [may be adduced for our view for] they indeed told him, 'If you have always acted in this manner you have never fulfilled the commandment of sukkah'.)

    "content": "# Why do we only put on tefillin once a day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have heard it said (but have no source) that the obligation to wear tefillin covers the entire day, and that people used to actually wear their tefillin all day long. (Various passages that I have seen in the gemara, of people removing tefillin to go to the toilet and replacing them afterwards would support this). Now that we are no longer able to focus our minds on clean thoughts for such a length of time (or so the story goes), we only put the tefillin on once and in the morning. This is why a person who forgot to wear tefillin by shacharis, or who forgot to daven shacharis, should put on tefillin in the afternoon for mincha.</p>\n\n<p>But if the mitzva of wearing tefillin goes for the entire day, why do we need to supplant it with a one-time obligation? Why don't we say that all day-time davening (shacharis and mincha) requires tefillin? Why don't we encourage the use of tefillin at other points of time as well - such as when saying birkas hammazon, for example, or learning/teaching Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have also heard that our Jewish ancestors, specifically during the time of the Temple, used to wear tefillin throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Kitzer Shulchan Aruch, as well as related questions, gives a good idea as to why the idea of wearing tefillin throughout the day is possible but not overtly practical.</p>\n<p>Kitzer Siman 10:1\n\"Whoever is scrupulous in the mitzvah of <em>tefillin</em>, to treat them [in accordance] with [their] holiness, not to speak idle words or of mundane matters while wearing them, he will live a long life and is assured that he is destined for the World to Come.\"</p>\n<p>Similarly, Siman 10:16\n\"The entire time that the <em>tefillin</em> are on a person, he must not divert his mind from them at all, except for the time when he is praying the <em>Shemoneh Esrei</em>, or when he is learning Torah.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is forbidden to eat a meal while wearing <em>tefillin</em>, but it is permitted to partake of a snack while wearing them. With regard to sleeping, it is forbidden to take even a short nap while wearing them.\"</p>\n<p>Significantly (Siman 10:20):</p>\n<p><strong>\"Because [in truth the optimal form of] the mitzvah [is for] the <em>tefillin</em> to be worn the entire day; [and it is] only because it is difficult to maintain a clean body (see Siman 10:23) [that] one removes them immediately after the <em>Shacharis</em> prayer.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Siman 10:23 :\n\"[The wearing of] <em>tefillin</em> requires [that one maintain] a clean body and one must [therefore] be careful not to pass gas while wearing them.\"</p>\n<p>Note that \"Eating up to the volume of an egg is considered a snack with regard to this halacha\" (Mishnah Berurah 40:20).\"</p>\n<p>And that \"Sleeping while wearing <em>tefillin</em> is prohibited lest one inadvertently pass gas while sleeping (Mishnah Berurah 44:1). According to some authorities, it is permitted to doze briefly (by placing one's head between his knees - see <em>Beur HaGra</em> ibid. 3 and <em>Magen Avraham</em> ibid. 3) up to the amount of time that it takes to walk 100 <em>amos</em>. This is approximately one sixty-seventh of an hour [less than a minute] (see Mishnah Berurah 44:4).\"</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/78795/wearing-tefillin-all-day?rq=1\">All day tefillin</a></p>\n<p>It seems that the main reasons to not prolong the use of tefillin center around uncleanliness, both in thought and in physical action. However, as noted, the optimal form of this mitzvah is to be worn throughout the entire day. I recommend trying to wear tefillin for a prolonged period as a spiritual endeavor. Just make sure to remove them when you eat anything more than the size of an egg, need to use the restroom, or take a nap.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.37?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">M\"A 37:2</a> brings a shita that holds one should indeed put on Tefillin by Mincha.

However, he says if someone feels they really can reach that level then they should wear it at Moncha as well. In the footnotes there he explains  that once you wore it once a day there is no need to wear it again, like Lulav. However, someone who feels the Kedusha can shake Lulav more than once (the Gemara mentions Yakirei Yerushalyim that did that), so too by Tefillin.</p>\n\n\n",

Does, perhaps, the owner forfeit the object altogether by his not returning, and I can keep it without paying its value?

Let's look Chazal and poskim. </p>\n\n<h3>1.Mitsvat Hashavat Aveda remains for ever.</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The Mishna BM 28b</strong> stated that a part of lost objects  which produces and consumes, will continue to produce and consume. Something which doesn't will be sold. Gemara asked,  according to Rashi understanding, \"needs he struggle for ever to watch the lost object?\" Basically,  the bottom line is that after a given period,  you can sell it and keep the money for ever,  according to Rabbi Tarfon he can even borrow this money.  We learn this from a verse from which Gemara learned <strong>\"consider how to return it unto him\".</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>But to leave at all is contrary to the mitsvat hashava, which is for ever i a certain form.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Thus, a lost object has a  <strong>Mitsvat hashava for ever.</strong>   But this is still different from the OP object  in several  points: the owner of the aveda has a good excuse for his delay,  he  probably didn't find where is the object.  But he perhaps wived. The last point (called \"yeush\") does not lead to a kula because of the mitsva to return which already began before yeush.  This person needs help and the Tora give it. </p>\n\n<h3>2.Custody becomes sometimes Hashavat Aveda.</h3>\n\n<p>For a custody, the delay may be  expression of a give it to the custodian, or can be a sign that <strong>the owner has an \"force majeure\" and became a kind of baal aveda.</strong>  In summary in shomer some cases may be interpreted as voluntary abandon by the owner,  which makes the shomer patur, but not all cases. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Mishna in third chapter of BM</strong> can help a lot. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a man deposits produce with his neighbour, even if it is suffering loss, he must not touch it. r' simeon b. gamaliel said: he must sell it by order of the court,    <strong><em>because it is like returning lost property to its</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can assume this the custodian is not in position to alert the owner. It is a bit similar to the OP case, the owner should have to come back and look for his fruits. To leave the fruits rotting is a lesser degree than stopping custody, but it is stiff prohibited. Here appears the \"hashavat aveda issue\". We ruled halacha as Raban Shim'on ben Gamliel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pesachim 13a:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For Rabin son of R' Adda related: It once happened that a certain man deposited a saddle-bag full of leaven with Johanan of Hukok, and mice made holes in it, and the leaven was bursting out.\n  He then went before Rabbi.\n  The first hour he said to him, 'Wait'; the second, he said to him, 'Wait'; the third he said to him, 'Wait'; the fourth he said to him, 'Wait'; at the fifth he sa to him, 'Go out and sell it in the market'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This case is almost the case of the OP,  why the owner of the Chamets didn't come back?  Gemara compared this case to the above for the sentence of Rashbag. </p>\n\n<h3>3.The custodian is not the slave of the bailor.</h3>\n\n<p>But there are cases of leniency in custody if we know that <strong><em>the owner is  located in the same city and doesn't care about his object.</em></strong>  For instance,  for some objects one must air them regularly,  as books or clothes.  If the owner is no far away from the place,  the custodian is exempt from airing the object. See <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=97694&rid=13604\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Sheela 7,  4</a></p>\n\n<h3>Finally perhaps in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=13612\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7, 12,</a> the Rambam addresses the OP :</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A question arose when a person entrusts an article to a colleague and then journeys overseas, and afterwards, the watchman also desires to travel overseas or depart in a caravan. There is an authority who ruled that if the watchman brings the entrusted article to the Jewish court, he is absolved of his responsibility.  These are well-reasoned words. For <strong>we do not imprison the watchman in this city because of the object entrusted to him by the person who departed overseas</strong> . The watchman cannot take the entrusted article with him, lest it be destroyed by factors beyond his control. The court should then entrust the article to a faithful person. This is like returning a lost object to its owner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This case is very linked which our case, but if the owner is located in the same city and the watchman desire to travel, obviously he can say it \"I leave\". If there is no way to find the owner, the case of hashavat aveda apply. But the duty of Hashavat Aveda is not only for the custodian, I assume that for hashavat aveda too, a similary din exists.</p>\n\n<p>The source is in <strong>BK 118a:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>MISHNAH:\n  If a man has robbed another, or borrowed money from him, or <strong>received a deposit from him in an inhabited place,</strong> he may not restore it to him in the wilderness; [but if the transaction was originally made] upon the stipulation that he was going into the wilderness, he may make restoration even while in the wilderness.\n  GEMARA:\n  A contradiction could be raised [from the following:] 'A loan can be paid in all places, whereas a lost article [which was found], or a deposit cannot be restored save in a place suitable for this'? - Said Abaye: What is meant is this: 'A loan can be demanded in any place, whereas a lost article [which was found] or <strong>a deposit cannot be demanded save in the proper place.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Concerning a time limited watching, I found something in Sefer Machane Efrayim Hilchot Shomerim,  siman 18.</p>\n\n<p>The ME said that following Tos.  in Meruba and Rashba in Kiddushin 13, Ran in Hashoel,  stated than Shomer Sachar and Shomer Chinam  <strong>can waive their function</strong>  even before the end  of the shmira,  and according to Ritba who is stringent, at least  <strong>at the end of a shmira limited in time,</strong>  he can say that he stop the Shmira.  {He can make a kind of  hachraza to make sure that the owner knows that he will end the shmira}. </p>\n\n<p>But the question is if there is nobody to say this to him. </p>\n\n<p>I believe that the absence of the owner must  be interpreted as voluntary if he remained here.  But as an Ones if he is far away ,  the Shomer becomes Shomer aveda.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Halacha:</h2>\n\n<p>SA CM 293, 3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המפקיד אצל חבירו והלך בעל הפקדון למדינת הים והנפקד רוצה לפרש בים או לצאת בשיירא אם בא והביא הפקדון לב\"ד נפטר מאחריות שמירתו <strong><em>שאין אוסרים זה במדינה זו מפני פקדון של זה שהלך</em></strong> [ואי אפשר] (וא\"א) לו להוליכה עמו שמא יארע לו אונס ויהיה חייב באחריותו <strong><em>ב\"ד מפקידים ביד אדם נאמן אצלם מפני השבת אבידה לבעלים:</em></strong> ‏\n  הגה: ואם לא היה יכול להניחו בישוב והוצרך להוליכו עמו למדבר מכח סכנה או מכח שומר שמסר לשומר ונאנס מידו י\"א דפטור הנפקד (מרדכי פ' הגוזל):‏</p>\n  \n  <p>קצות החשן ס\"ק ב': ... כל אחריות עליו... עד הזמן שנתחייב בדין שומרים...‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>He is not required to continue to watch, and can travel. </p></li>\n<li><p>He must seek assistance from Bet Din for a problem of hashavat aveda. </p></li>\n<li><p>If the watching is time limited the duty to watch ends with this time (Qtsot,  but maybe that everybody agrees), but the Sheela of Hashavat aveda is not eliminated.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

If so, Esav's thought seems to say something like, \"shortly my father's mourning period shall approach, and I will kill Ya'akov, then.\" rather than saying something like \"I'll wait to kill him just after the mourning is complete.\" </p>\n\n<p>Should we assume that Esav's loyalty and respect to his father immediately ended the day Yitzhak died?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar explains: Yitschak blessed Aisov and said that should Yaakov not toil in Torah then Aisov shall have the reigns over Yaakov.</p>\n\n<p>Aisov knew that in aveilut, Yaakov would not toil in his learning,since leHalacha an avel may not toil in learning being that Torah brings happiness to a person and therefore he shall seize the opportunity to have the upper hand over Yaakov and kill him. </p>\n\n<p>I would like to add another explanation.</p>\n\n<p>The Yaaros Devash in Derush 7' in the paragraph beginning with 'אבל דע כי מיתת הצדיק היא לתשובה' says that upon the death of a Tsaddik who his lifelong goal was to bring people up in their Avodat Hashem,the Tsaddik himself shall come down and bring the people strength to overcome their Yetser Ho'Rah.He will plant a new heart in them, a heart which longs to serve Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>However, says the Yaaros Devash, in order for the Tsaddik to connect to you and thereby lift you, you shall need to start longing to do good on your own and then he shall gain permission to intercede on your behalf and be granted the power to lift you up with him.</p>\n\n<p>How will that happen: By being Maspid (eulogizing) the Tsaddik, you are inspired to Teshuvah and to follow in his ways. In other words by crying over the Tsaddik you shall come to Teshuvah.</p>\n\n<p>Now, according to the words of the Yaros Devash,i would like to explain; Aisov, with his will do rid himself of Yaakov,feared sitting Shivaah and crying after his father, knowing that he just might come to teshuva and be elevated to great heights and then killing Yaakov or anyone else for that matter will certainly be out of the picture.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore he shall use the tactic of 'out of sight, out of mind' and ignoring the entire mourning he shall immediately turn to his goal, and kill Yaakov before anything good shall inspire him to Teshuvah.</p>\n\n<p>In short aveilut was purposefully as any other day fearing that it will have an affect on him and he won't want to carry out his plan anymore. </p>\n\n\n",

To summarize in a superficial way: The parental escort symbolizes spritual/kabbalistic ideas which are named 'Abba' and 'Imma' (these are borrowed terms). Since in Kabbalah the union between bride and groom achieves an elevation of spiritual levels, these escorts help to bestow the bride and groom the ability to achieve that unification. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מקומות שנוהגים כמנהג קדמונים\n  שבחופה מלוים את החתן אביו\n  ואמו , שהם מרכבה לאבא ואימא עילאין (או\"א)\n  והם נותנים את הכח להחתן להכנס לאור\n  הביטול, ואת הכלה מלוים אביה ואמה שהם\n  מרכבה לישסו \"ת (ישראל סבא ותבונה), שהם\n  נותנים את הכח להכלה להכנס לעבודת\n  ההשתוקקות , ומנהגינו שאת החתן מלוים שני\n  האבות, שהם מרכבה בכללות לאור דאבא\n  העליון (אור הביטול – ספי' החכמה), ואת הכלה\n  מלוים ב' האמהות שהן מרכבה לאור דאמא\n  (אש ההשתוקקות – ספי' הבינה), ועי \"ז נעשה\n  בחי ' ההתכללות ד 'הבן בחכמה' (בחי' אבי הכלה\n  שנכלל עם אבי החתן ) ו'חכים בבינה' (בחי' אם\n  החתן שמשתתפת עם אם הכלה), ומהתכללות זו\n  נעשה החתן מרכבה לז \"א סוד התפארת הכלול\n  מקו ימין וקו שמאל, וזה סוד דברכת 'יוצר\n  האדם' – ברכת השבח על החתן שעתה הוא\n  מרכבה להז \"א, (וההורים נותנים הכח לחתן וכלה\n  לעשות יחוד דאו\"א בחיק ובמקום הוריהם ,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The practice of lucid dreaming\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There has been a bit of discussion lately about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lucid dreaming</a>. This results from a state of consciousness in which the person dreaming is aware that they are asleep and can now control every aspect of their dream. With the proliferation of augmented- and virtual-reality software, there are now devices that purport to induce this state.</p>\n\n<p>From an aggadic perspective, an opinion is brought in the gemara that dreams are one sixtieth of prophecy (Berakhot 57b), and the gemara proceeds (throughout that perek) to delineate the meaning behind different things that a person might see or do when they are dreaming. If this is so, then what of a person who is experiencing a lucid dream? If they were to deliberately manipulate their dream, would that prophecy still take effect?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if dreams are one sixtieth of prophecy, does that preclude a person from deliberately tampering with them? Are there any sources that discuss this issue?</p>\n\n\n",

Most notably</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's too easy to corrupt</li>\n<li>Moses himself wrote that he wrote everything up</li>\n<li>Jews themselves jot that down knowing that it's too easy to forget or corrupt otherwise</li>\n<li>There are periods that even the Written Torah is gone. (Actually this is so suspicious I seriously suspect that Josiah made the whole thing up and Torah could have been written or compiled by Josiah).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I must admit that his reasoning is quite reasonable. So what would Judaism answer to those 4 problems?</p>\n<p>Btw I am an agnostic. Neither a Jew, nor a Christian.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The OP references 4 specific arguments against the validity of an oral law as they appear in a linked article. This answer will address the article's points.</p>\n\n<p>1) It's too easy to corrupt- The article claims that since humans tend to bungle perfect communication without writing it down, therefore there can be no authentic preserved oral law. An example is given about a wife who sends her husband to the store. If a list is not written, then wrong items will be purchased or correct items forgotten. This is known as the \"broken telephone\" argument.</p>\n\n<p>Answer: When one person tells one person something, it can be mistakenly repeated. However, if his wife sent 100 people to the store and asked each of them to buy the very same 5 items, we would easily know who made a mistake as the vast majority of people will return with the correct 5 items. In case of mass communication, an oral law is actually the best verification of facts there could be!</p>\n\n<p>A nation that teaches a set of oral rules to all their children as a religious duty is a mass population communicating to a mass population. Things will tend to be very accurate. Mistaken individuals will obviously be corrected by the masses.</p>\n\n<p>2) The article quotes a verse which occurred slightly before the 10 commandments were given which reports that Moses wrote all the words of G-d. Other supporting verses are brought showing that the Torah was written. So, where is the oral law?</p>\n\n<p>Answer: First of all, that verse appears before the entire Torah was given. Even the article's author must admit that the 10 commandments were not yet written in that verse either! The oral laws came later on Mt. Sinai. during the revelation and the 40 days and nights.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the oral law has to do with correct interpretations. Any book's interpretations, are by definition, not included in its writing. So if I told you that \"I wrote all G-d's words down.\", that doesn't mean I also wrote all the explanations and clarifications of anything.</p>\n\n<p>3) The oral law is open to corruption by the leaders. So how can we think we now have a true oral law?</p>\n\n<p>Answer: First of all, The OP's question is just as good when aimed at anyone's written laws! People in power can change the books and sell their new copy! Did all ancient populations know how to read?? Sometimes only the priests did. How easy was that to change? When it is a religious duty of the masses to recite and memorize things orally, you can't cook the books so fast.</p>\n\n<p>A society with only a written law is vulnerable to the risk of falsification on some level. A society with only an oral law is also subject to the risk of falsification on some level. However, a society that has both a written and oral law, is highly insulated against falsification. It is a check and balance system that defends itself.</p>\n\n<p>4) The article sites the incident in Tanach where King Josiah \"..finds the Scroll of the Law in the Temple..\". The claim is that Josiah wrote the Torah, and made it all up. Specifically, he invented the Passover laws.</p>\n\n<p>Answer: The Torah scroll in the story was a special copy of the Torah kept in the Temple. The people under previous Kings Amon and Menashe, fell into idolatry. King Menashe had tried to suppress the correct worship of G-d and did not safeguard ancient scrolls in the Temple properly. King Josiah was happy to \"find\" the scroll because he didn't think it would be easily found after the previous two kings controlled the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>However, any claim that he invented Passover laws or the idea of a ritual Passover rite which the people never heard of is absolutely absurd.</p>\n\n<p>Joshua 5 and II Chronicles 30 both describe great Passovers in history that the Jews celebrated (under Joshua and King Hezekiah respectively). No one claims that Josiah discovered the \"Book of Joshuah\" in the Temple. :) King Hezekiah reigned right before his son Menashe and was true to G-d and His Torah. Therefore, the people in the time of King Josiah, knew what Passover was, but they just fell into lax observance during the time of Menashe and his son Amon.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who draws absurd conclusions from the \"found the scroll\" story is making a mistake due to lack of scholarship. King Josiah did not live in a vacuum. :)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I highly recommend you read \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1568710992\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Permission to Receive</a>\" by Rabbi Lawrence Kelemen who discusses this in tremendous depth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It seems to me that Americans and Protestants view that there is no oral Torah because they have a new belief supposedly called \"sola scriptura\" which means that everything is in the Bible. Unfortunately, they rely on a lot of tradition, but they are ignorant of that reliance, but either way, not the point. From a historical perspective it makes no sense that there would be no oral torah.</p>\n\n<p>Europeans (and then therefore Americans) during the rise of Protestantism were not big on oral traditions, nor passing down stories orally. This is in stark contrast to every tribal people from the Middle East, the Far East, Native Americans, Aztecs/Mayans, Pacific Islanders, etc etc. All old tribal peoples have something in common, very few could read, and most stories and understandings are passed down orally, either via song or recitation. They are also passed down by either heads of household, special oracles, or by people who were tested and proven to be able to memorize and recite information without changing it.</p>\n\n<p>So regardless on what your personal stance on the authenticity of what the oral Torah says, it's actually MORE unlikely that there would be no oral traditions being passed down in the tribe of Judah. It would be a shocking anomaly if there was no oral Torah at all.</p>\n\n<p>So for me personally, I find the Catholic/Karaite view to be more sensical. Whatever Oral Tradition there might have been, it went off track somewhere.</p>\n\n\n",

He is 100% materialist, atheist in his world view.</p>\n\n<p>He keeps the most basic laws of Judaism: keeps Sabbath (not so strictly as Orthodox Jews do, but keeps), doesn't eat pork and doesn't mix milk and meat.

Not every weekend, but he is a regular visitor in a local synagogue.</p>\n\n<p>I think, he does it because although he doesn't believe the religion, he wants to honor his religious friends and ancestors. Furthermore, this is the way of life he is accustomed to.</p>\n\n<p>I think it would be nicer if he would do what God wants from him. But, somewhere I've read, that Judaism is more like law as simply a religion. And he keeps the law on a basic level.</p>\n\n<p>So, what will happen to a Jew, keeping basic laws, but not believing anything over the pure matter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One who does not believe in the principles of Judaism does not merit the World to Come. This is stated clearly at the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.90a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter of Talmud</a> that discusses the topic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל ישראל יש להם חלק לעולם הבא שנאמר (ישעיהו ס, כא) ועמך כולם צדיקים לעולם יירשו ארץ נצר מטעי מעשה ידי להתפאר ואלו שאין להם חלק לעולם הבא האומר אין תחיית המתים מן התורה ואין תורה מן השמים ואפיקורוס<br />\nMISHNA: All of the Jewish people, even sinners and those who are liable to be executed with a court-imposed death penalty, have a share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your people also shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever; the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, for My name to be glorified” (Isaiah 60:21). And these are the exceptions, the people who have no share in the World-to-Come, even when they fulfilled many mitzvot: One who says: There is no resurrection of the dead derived from the Torah, and one who says: The Torah did not originate from Heaven, and an epikoros, who treats Torah scholars and the Torah that they teach with contempt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea that Judaism is merely a religion of laws without concern for belief is a common misconception. As far as I can tell is that it comes from the Christian perspective that Judaism is a dry religion of laws and rote practice, which they believe Jesus replaced with a focus on belief. This is convenient and lazy caricature they use to explain why Christianity replaced Judaism.</p>\n<p>The truth is that Judaism is an all-encompassing religion, that deals with the physical, the mental, and the spiritual aspect of people, as the author of the classic work <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart%2C_Introduction_of_the_Author?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Duties of the Heart</a> explains in his introduction.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the TaNaKH and from the Talmud, we read about these two ultimate \"afterlife\"-destinations, inclusive of a time-frame:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,\n  some to everlasting life, and some to reproaches and everlasting\n  abhorrence.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3412.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 12:2</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Death is like sleep.

A sentence of condemnation condemns one into the hellish \"Gehenna\"-Destination, whereas an acquittal leads into the heavenly \"Garden of Eden\"-Destination.</p>\n\n<p>Thus is the \"afterlife\" nature, according to Orthodox Judaism as fleshed-out in both the above sources from the TaNaKH and Talmud.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>G-d says, “if only Me they would abandon but My Torah they would observe.” This means that an atheist Jew who keeps Torah is a Jew in good standing in the eyes of G-d.</p>\n\n\n",

Would it make a difference if she is already dating someone else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>Quick Answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In general you should keep praying. No, the door is never slammed from heaven permanently. However, you should reexamine your prayer and pray for the right things in the situation. You should also back it up with action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n\n<p>In general, there is no limit to constructive prayer. G-d always hears you and has mercy. (Here is a story I have heard in Yeshivah.) A woman once asked R' Chaim Kanievsky if she should stop praying for relief of her suffering because she sees no change? He answered that she should continue praying. 1) She may not have earned enough merit yet through the prayers. 2) She may have been decreed to undergo a certain amount of difficult times and the prayer may be speeding things up for her.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the specific case of praying that someone else should feel a certain way, there is a problem. How can you expect that G-d will brainwash someone for you? Lets look at it from another angle. How would you feel if, after you cultivated this romantic relationship with your friend successfully, another woman who you absolutely do not like, would pray that G-d change your mind and make you fall in love with her instead?? What would you think of G-d if he granted that prayer and forcibly changed your mind so that now you dumped your intended girl who you worked for, so you could falsely feel attracted to the other woman?</p>\n\n<p>Here are my humble suggestions on what you should pray for.</p>\n\n<p>1) To know if the romantic relationship you seek is good or bad for you?</p>\n\n<p>2) If it is bad, ask for help to realize you should keep your distance despite the attraction.</p>\n\n<p>3) If it is good, ask for help in recognizing why you are not succeeding in attracting her as well? Specifically, ask that your eyes are opened to the flaws in your character that may be blocking the relationship? Ask for help in knowing how to attract her if she is someone for you.</p>\n\n<p>4) Ask G-d to help you understand your friend's mind and feelings.</p>\n\n<p>5) Tell G-d you are lonely, and it is not good to be alone. Ask him to either grant you this one, or if she is not the one, to grant you someone good for you quickly instead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Next, you should take the advice of the Mishnah Pirkei Avos Ch 2:4. \"..nullify your will in front of G-d's will in order that He should nullify the will of others before your will.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Find something in your service of G-d that you are neglecting. Change your ways and do better. Then, if this girl is for you, but there are just issues blocking the situation, your merits of change, with your prayer, will nullify the opposition.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you should invest in a book about relationships and self esteem/self-confidence. Investigate how hard it is for some women (and why) to view a friend as a romantic interest. Discover if you are lacking in self esteem or confidence by wanting a specific someone else too much? This shows G-d you are willing to make a practical effort as well as praying for supernatural intervention.</p>\n\n<p>When you pray and also couple your prayer with serious honest and sincere effort in this world too, the combination will bear fruit and happiness.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Concerning the \"romantical\" issue, CYLOR, but you address a very interesting and important topic. </p>\n\n<p>This is one of a main issues in the life of everyone.</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/02-01-03/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> link:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולכן צריך אדם להתאמץ מאוד בתפילתו, ולא יחשוב שאם הוא מתפלל חייב הקב\"ה למלא את מבוקשו, אלא ימשיך ויתפלל, וידע שהקב\"ה שומע את תפילתו, ובודאי \n  ‏ תפילתו פועלת לטובה, אלא שאין אנו יודעים איך וכיצד‏</p>\n  \n  <p>A man need to make a great effort and not to think that if he pray, Hakadosh Baruch Hu is in duty to agree his requiest, but he need to continue to pray, and to know that Hakadosh Baruch Hu hears his prayer.

Others allow one who already started to learn before the Kriat Hatora to continue assuming that he indicated that he was not about to listen the Kriat Hatora but to learn, and had already beginning to learn before {I assume also that for prayer, the same rule apply}. But if he is one of the ten men (and there are only ten men) he has to listen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The source is a Gemara in Berachot 8a.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R' Shesheth used to turn his face to another side and study.

He will not be content to take silver mixed with dross\nand lead, that is, divine service mixed with impure motivations, but\nrather only with the clean and pure as is befitting. Then he will be\ncalled \"one who does a mitzva as it is stated\", of which our sages of\nblessed memory said: \"whoever does a mitzva as it is stated, will\nreceive no evil tidings\" (Shab.63a). Likewise they said: <strong>\"do [good]\ndeeds for the sake of their Maker, and speak of them for their own\nsake\"</strong> (Nedarim 62a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And what is this motivation that is clean and pure? Serving Hashem because it is the right thing to do i.e. because it is true:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעִנְיָנָהּ <strong>שֶׁלֹּא יַנִּיחַ הָאָדָם מָקוֹם לַיֵּצֶר</strong>\nבְּמַעֲשָׂיו, אֶלָּא יִהְיוּ <strong>כָּל מַעֲשָׂיו עַל צַד הַחָכְמָה\nוְהַיִּרְאָה</strong> וְלֹא עַל צַד הַחֵטְא וְהַתַּאֲוָה.</p>\n<p>Its matter is for a man to <strong>not leave any room in one's deeds for the\nevil inclination</strong>, but rather, that <strong>all of his deeds be from the\nside of wisdom and fear of G-d</strong>, and not from the side of sin and\nlust.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. pure motivations, based on the truth of the value of the actions themselves, and the One Who commands them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי אֵין דַּי לָאָדוֹן בָּרוּךְ הוּא בַּמַּעֲשִׂים לְבַדָּם\nשֶׁיִּהְיוּ מַעֲשֵׂי מִצְוָה, אֶלָּא הָעִקָּר לְפָנָיו שֶׁהַלֵּב\nיִהְיֶה טָהוֹר <strong>לְכַוֵּן בָּהּ לַעֲבוֹדָה אֲמִתִּית</strong>.</p>\n<p>For to the Master of the world, the deeds alone are not sufficient,\nnamely, to perform an act of mitzva. Rather, the primary importance\nbefore Him is that the heart be pure, <strong>so that its intent is to true\nservice</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The introduction to chapter 19, as you brought, explains that there is a level above this, and that is not to do it just because it is right, true and wise, but also because you love Hashem, with a simple love that seeks only to please Him. This is yet another level of \"<em>lishma</em>\", which I believe the Rambam covers in the same halachot, e.g.:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמַעֲלָה זוֹ הִיא מַעֲלָה גְּדוֹלָה מְאֹד וְאֵין כָּל חָכָם זוֹכֶה\nלָהּ. וְהִיא מַעֲלַת אַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ שֶׁקְּרָאוֹ הַקָּדוֹשׁ\nבָּרוּךְ הוּא אוֹהֲבוֹ לְפִי שֶׁלֹּא עָבַד אֶלָּא מֵאַהֲבָה</p>\n<p>This is a very high level which is not merited by every wise man. It\nis the level of our Patriarch, Abraham, whom God described as, \"he who\nloved Me,\" for his service was only motivated by love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is always a solar-based calculation, and on the Gregorian calendar it occurs on Dec. 4 or 5th, currently.</p>\n\n<p>If the starting time i sbased on a solar date, shouldn't we begin saying this when that solar date occurs, namely during shacharit or by davening Ma'ariv after 12 midnight when that solar date has occurred?

It bears zero relationship to \"true midnight\", in other words, which is the midpoint of the night itself.</p>\n\n<p><em>Halakhically</em>, we consider one day transitioning into the next when the sun goes down and the stars come out. As such, maariv is actually the first tefillah of the day - and not the third.</p>\n\n<p>Since we want to start saying ותן טל ומטר on the sixtieth day after tekufat tishrei (a day that corresponds to December 5th on the Gregorian calendar), we need to start doing this on maariv of December 4th.

    "content": "# Why do we use the masculine form in a Shabbat greeting?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My Israeli friend explained to me that the word \"שבת\" is a feminine word, since the plural uses the feminine ending - it is שבתות.</p>\n\n<p>If this is true, why is a common greeting שבת שלום ומבורך using the maculine format instead of שבת שלום ומבורכת ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>With respect to your friend, the fact that <em>shabbat</em> pluralises as <em>shabbatot</em> is itself insufficient for demonstrating that it's a feminine word. Lots of masculine words take that plural - such as אבות, for example - and some words can take both plurals (שמשים vs. שמשות, etc).</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, <em>shabbat</em> can function both as a feminine and as a masculine noun. An example of where a pronoun referring to Shabbat is masculine would be Isaiah 56:2 - שמר שבת מחללו (not מחללה). An example of where <em>shabbat</em> takes a feminine verb would be Leviticus 25:6 - והיתה שבת הארץ (rather than והיה).</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.ericlevy.com/revel/bdb/bdb/main.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the BDB</a>, the word was originally feminine but came to be thought of as masculine because of the influence of the phrase יום השבת, in which יום is masculine.</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Note</strong>: to see a discussion of this word's functioning both as a masculine and as a feminine noun, look at Tosafot on Ketubot 5a (s.v. שמא ישחוט בן עוף).]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a detailed analysis on why the formula is \"mevorach\" and not \"mevorechet\".</p>\n<p>שבת שלום ומבורך\nמאת: ניסן ברגגרין\nעיונים בלשון העברית, תשנ\"ה, עמ' 170-168\nלקריאת המאמר</p>\n<p>המחבר מתחקה על מקורה של הברכה \"שבת שלום ומבורך\" ומשיב על שתי תמיהות: (א) איך אפשר להסביר את צירוף שני הלוואים השונים – האחד שם עצם (שלום) והאחר שם תואר (מבורך), ו(ב) מדוע \"מבורך\" בזכר ולא בנקבה בהתאמה למין המילה שבת</p>\n<p>Google translation:</p>\n<p>Shalom and blessed Sabbath\nBy: Nissan Berggreen\nStudies in the Hebrew language, 5555, pp. 170-168</p>\n<p>The author traces the origin of the blessing \"Shabbat Shalom and Blessed\" and answers two questions: (a) how can one explain the combination of the two different words - one a noun (peace) and the other an adjective (blessed), and (b) why \"blessed\" is masculine and not feminine according to the gender of the word Shabbat.</p>\n<p>From: <a href=\"https://hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/06/25/%d7%a9%d7%91%d7%aa-%d7%a9%d7%9c%d7%95%d7%9d-%d7%95%d7%9e%d7%91%d7%95%d7%a8%d7%9a/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/06/25/%d7%a9%d7%91%d7%aa-%d7%a9%d7%9c%d7%95%d7%9d-%d7%95%d7%9e%d7%91%d7%95%d7%a8%d7%9a/</a></p>\n<p>Article located at: <a href=\"https://hebrew-academy.org.il/wp-content/uploads/nb-shabat.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrew-academy.org.il/wp-content/uploads/nb-shabat.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Google translation of article (revised by me):</p>\n<p>Page 1:</p>\n<p>The Hebrew Language Academy - protected by copyright</p>\n<p>Shalom and blessed Sabbath</p>\n<p>The blessing \"Shabbat Shalom\" that is common among us is not found in ancient sources, neither in the Talmud nor in the Midrash, nor in the books of the scribes. Yehuda Gur speculates in his dictionary that it's origin is in the words of the Baraita:</p>\n<p>\"On his way out he (the one visiting the sick on Shabbat) says: \"It is Shabbat and it is forbidden to make supplications, but may you soon get well.\" (Shabbat 12b)</p>\n<p>He writes there that the blessing is found in Sefer HaShelah, in the middle of the section on Tractate Shabbat:</p>\n<p>\"A person who visits his friend on Shabbat morning shall not say to him as in the way that he says during the week, 'Tzafra Taba' ['Good Morning']. He shall only say to him Shabbat Shalom or \"Good Shabbat\".</p>\n<p>The blessing, accepted by Sephardim and Chasidim of the Ashkenazi sect, \"Shabbat Shalom and Blessed\", is found in the book \"Chemdat Yamim\". And Mr. Madan pointed out to me that it has an earlier testimony - R. Ya'akov Emden adds in his siddur, \"Hanhagat Lail Shabbat\":</p>\n<p>\"And the writings of the Ari: When you enter the house, you shall say in a loud voice \"Shabbat peace and blessing\"; And he adds and says: \"That was the custom of Avi Mori Rabbi, of Blessed Memory.\"</p>\n<p>Page 2:</p>\n<p>This blessing has long puzzled some linguists: (a) in the combination of the two different endings for the noun Shabbat - the first ending is a noun (in the genitive), followed by an adjective ending (in the nominative); (b) In the form of the following adjective, which is in the masculine form, and Shabbat is a feminine name, and it would have been better to formulate the blessing with these words: \"Shabbat Shalom and Beracha\", or \"Sabbath Shalom\", Shabbat Mevorechet\"</p>\n<p>The second difficulty is not a difficulty. Although in the Bible, the Mishnah and the Talmud, and even in later literature, Shabbat is feminine, but we also find in the Bible Shabbat is  masculine: \"Shomer Shabbat mechallelo\" (desecrates the Sabbath day):\"</p>\n<p>And this phrase, which is a major principle of Shabbat, is a commonly known phrase and also influenced the use of Shabbat in the masculine, which is found throughout rabbinical literature. The author of the song \"Kol Mekadesh\" for Shabbat night inserted the phrase in Isaiah at the beginning of the song: \"All who sanctify the Sabbath as it deserves; All who protect the Sabbath from its desecraters\". The song continues: \"Those who delay taking leave of Shabbat; Who delay ending the Sabbath, and hurry to begin it.\" In another psalm for Shabbat night (\"Yom Shabbat Kodesh Hu\"), the words are, \"Sabbath comes, rest comes\".</p>\n<p>As for the first difficulty, it is possible that peace is used in Hebrew as a noun but also as an adjective. Thus in the verse \"They shall be persecuted, and peace shall pass\" (Isaiah 1:3), Rashi and Radek interpret as in peace, that is, a description; Radak adds \"And peace should be interpreted as an adjective like \"and Jacob will come safe and there will be peace near and far.\" Gaznius-Kautsch also comments (p. 379) that peace is here an</p>\n<p>Page 3:</p>\n<p>adjective and Zolai already showed that peace is an adjective in the language of the sages and the poets, and there is peace (masc.), peace (fem.), and peace (pl.) as an adjective, and the two words are synonymous.</p>\n<p>Z. Ben-Chaim also found this phenomenon in Hebrew and Aramaic of the Samaritan version...The combination of the various suffixes (noun and adjective) can also be reconciled in terms of language rules. The matter of abbreviation in tongues (ellipsis) is well known. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yossi HaGalili has already spoken about this way in the Hebrew language in his \"Thirty-two measures\". The ninth measure for him is the \"short way\" (abbreviated). Even our first grammarians and commentators knew it. Rabbi Yonah Ibn Janah's \"Sefer HaRakama\" dedicated an entire chapter to it.</p>\n<p>Here in the greeting, the abbreviation of words is due to the tendency of the ones reciting the greeting to omit the word Shabbat for the second time, because there is no noticeable change in the pronunciation of (Shabbat Shalom, Shabbat Mevorach). However, this kind of greeting abbreviation is a novelty and is not found either in the Bible or in the literature that followed it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iVhippGj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iVhippGj.png\" alt=\"Shabbat Shalom U'Mevorach page 1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yl7tDS0w.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yl7tDS0w.png\" alt=\"Shabbat Shalom U'Mevorach page 2\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UDeU6x0E.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UDeU6x0E.png\" alt=\"Shabbat Shalom U'Mevorach page 3\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

It seems likely that some people learning gemara may not have had access to it. As such, whenever the tosafists want to refer to something that Rashi said, they quote the relevant part of his commentary, and they attribute it to him either by name (eg: Berakhot 53b, s.v. באכילה), or as the “booklet” (<em>kuntres</em>; eg: Bava Batra 2a, s.v. השור). But sometimes it also happens that they say exactly the same thing that Rashi says, without attribution and without adding anything new. An example of this would be Berakhot 6a, s.v. כי כסלא לאוגיא.</p>\n\n<p>Why do they do this? Did the tosafists only name their sources when they were disagreeing with them or adding something new? Alternatively, is it possible that in the version of Rashi’s commentary that they had access to, that particular section wasn’t there? I’m trying to understand why a group of people who are usually so careful to quote Rashi might sometimes say exactly the same thing that he said, but without giving any indication as to the fact that he had said it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>This is one of the considerations that led <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Tzvi Hirsch Chajes</a> to question the attribution of Rashi on Maseches Taanis. He writes in the beginning of the Masechta:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וברוב פעמים פירושים של בעלי התוס' דומים לדברי רש\"י ולפעמים הם אות באות\n  דומים לפירש\"י מה שלא מצאנו בשום מקום</p>\n  \n  <p>And many times the explanations of the Tosafists are similar to the\n  words of Rashi, sometimes even letter-for-letter, a phenomenon which\n  we don't find anywhere [else].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, the Tosafists might not have had the same Rashi that we have. As  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Yosef_David_Azulai\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Chaim Yosef Dovid Azulai</a> writes in Shem Hagedolim in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30594&st=&pgnum=141\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the entry for Rashi</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רש\"י עשה שלשה מהדורות בתלמוד ומהדורא שלישית היא זו שבידינו</p>\n  \n  <p>Rashi composed three editions of [his commentary to] the Talmud, and\n  the third edition is the one in our hands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תוספות מקשים על דברי רש\"י במקומות רבים שהם מהדורא קמא וכיוצא</p>\n  \n  <p>Tosafos often ask on the words of Rashi from the first edition and the\n  like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have wondered about this as well. I think the answer might be as follows. The Tosafos that we have on the side of our Gemaras are a collection of notes on the Gemara written by various different scholars over hundreds of years. Before printing the notes were passed down with additions being made along the way. The printers who decided to add Tosafos to the side of the Gemara didn't necessarily choose which Baalei Tosafos' notes would be most useful, but took notes wholesale from one Baal Tosafos or another (or decided based on what fit on the page best).</p>\n\n<p>Now when an individual Baal Tosafos wrote, he did not necessarily have Rashi's commentary in front of him <strong>at that time</strong>. A particular Baal Tosafos might have written the note making the same comment as Rashi not realizing that Rashi had already said it. But just as you don't go back and amend the insight you wrote on the side of your Gemara despite late learning that it was a mefurash Nimukei Yosef, the Baal Tosafos didn't necessarily go back and amend his note. Later on, this note was kept despite Rashi having said it because it was among the notes of that Baal Tosafos. If notes of that Baal Tosafos (or one of his students) made it into an early printing of the Gemara, that Tosafos will be in our Gemaras.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A very common reason for this, is that Tosfat were compiled and edited by each generation and group of scholars. Thus it happens, that the original scholar quoted Rashi and then argued with him. A later scholar, disagreed with the argument, or felt it was off topic, so he did not copy that part, but the first part with Rashi remained, though without the attribution. You can see this at times, that in alternate Tosfat, like Rosh or Rabeinu Perez, have the original arguments. Unfortunately, I haven't noted any of these locations. Hopefully I will find them soon.</p>\n\n\n",

And yet, there is also the widespread custom of reciting the Shema prior to one's death, but none of us can choose the circumstances under which we die.</p>\n\n<p>My gut instinct is that if one were close to death but in a situation or an environment that would normally preclude reciting the Shema they should say it anyway - but is that correct? Are there any sources that discuss this, or that provide a logical (meta-halakhic) reason as to why it is the case?

There it is established that keeping that goat would be a sin mi d'rabban, the discussion about the chassid is a continuation of that piece of mishna.</p>\n\n<p>I came across a very intesting answer to your question from Kollel Iyun Hadaf of Yerushalayim, who wrote the following about this specific case on their website <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/bkama/insites/bk-dt-080.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dafyomi.co.il</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2) THE SIN OF THE CHASID</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> The Gemara quotes a Beraisa which relates an incident about \"a certain Chasid\" who became ill, whom the doctors told that\n  the only thing for him to do was to drink raw milk of a goat every\n  morning. They brought him a goat, which he tied to the legs of his bed\n  in order to prevent it from grazing outside so that he not transgress\n  the prohibition against raising a Behemah Dakah in Eretz Yisrael.\n  Nevertheless, when his friends saw that he had a goat in his home,\n  they abstained from visiting him and they called him a robber. The\n  Beraisa relates that this Chasid had performed no other sin in his\n  life.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why did his friends accuse of him of sinning? The Gemara in Sanhedrin\n  (74a) teaches that when a person's life is in danger he is permitted\n  to transgress an Isur in order to save his life (except for the three\n  Isurim of Shefichas Damim, Giluy Arayos, and Avodah Zarah). Hence, he\n  was permitted to keep the Behemah Dakah in order to save his life.\n  What sin did he commit?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ANSWERS:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>(a) The TORAS CHAIM in Eruvin (21b, DH Mutav) answers based on the\n  opinion of the ROSH and the TUR (YD 157) who rule that if a person\n  wants to conduct himself stringently and allow himself be killed in\n  order to avoid a transgression, he is permitted to do so. This Chasid\n  was on such a lofty level of Avodas Hash-m that the act of keeping a\n  Behemah Dakah in his home, instead of giving up his life, was\n  considered a sin. (This is also the view of the RAMBAN in Kesuvos\n  (19a), who writes that it is a \"Midas Chasidus\" to let oneself be\n  killed and not transgress an Aveirah. Accordingly, this act was\n  considered a sin according to the great degree of Chasidus of Rebbi\n  Yehudah ben Bava.)</p>\n  \n  <p>(b) The Toras Chaim also explains the Gemara according to the view of\n  the RAMBAM. The Rambam (Hilchos Yesodei ha'Torah 5:1) rules that one\n  is not permitted to be stringent and let himself be killed instead of\n  doing a sin. The Rambam writes that one who lets himself be killed\n  instead of doing a sin is \"Mischayev b'Nafsho\" (\"guilty for his\n  life\"). Why, then, was the Chasid's act of keeping a Behemah Dakah\n  called a sin?</p>\n  \n  <p>The Toras Chaim explains that although the Chasid had no way to cure\n  himself other than by drinking the milk of a goat each morning,\n  nevertheless he would not have died without the milk. His condition of\n  \"Gone'ach mi'Libo\" would have persisted.</p>\n  \n  <p>The MAHARSHA (Chidushei Agados) also suggests this answer.</p>\n  \n  <p>RAV BETZALEL RENSBURG (in Hagahos) questions this approach. The Gemara\n  in Kesuvos (60a) teaches that a sick person is permitted to drink the\n  milk of a goat on Shabbos, because even though milking a goat on\n  Shabbos is an Isur d'Rabanan (Mefarek kel'Achar Yad), nevertheless \"in\n  a situation of pain, the Rabanan did not prohibit it.\" Here, too, the\n  Chasid was in pain, and since the prohibition against keeping a\n  Behemah Dakah is only an Isur d'Rabanan, \"in a situation of pain, the\n  Rabanan did not prohibit it\"!</p>\n  \n  <p>This question may be answered with the words of the ME'IRI. The Me'iri\n  explains that in a case in which the Isur d'Rabanan involves an\n  enactment made to prevent loss to other people, one must be\n  exceedingly stringent. Although the Me'iri himself maintains that the\n  Chasid should have given his life and not transgressed the Isur\n  d'Rabanan (since keeping a goat in one's home is a potential source of\n  damage for others), and the Maharsha maintains that the Chasid's life\n  was not in danger, nevertheless the Me'iri's explanation that this\n  Isur d'Rabanan is an especially stringent one suffices to explain the\n  difference between the case in the Gemara in Shabbos, where the sick\n  person is allowed to perform the Isur d'Rabanan, and the case here,\n  where keeping a goat in one's home is considered a sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've included the entire text of the question and answer here, including a link to the website and this article. I hope this falls under fair use.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# May one join a holiday choir that sings \"neutral\" songs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that generally, Jews should not devote attention towards celebrating non-Jewish holidays. Christmas, particularly, is also specifically a religious Christian holiday (vs., say, Thanksgiving) which may make such celebration more problematic.</p>\n\n<p>A rabbi had told me that a Jew should not join in a choir to sing Handel's Messiah as it contains references to Jesus and it is inappropriate to sing religious works. A main concern regarding celebrating non-Jeiwsh holidays is <em>chukot hagoyim</em> - not imitating the ways and \"laws\" of Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>I am curious if one would be prohibited from joining a holiday choir singing \"neutral\" holiday songs such as \"Rudolph the red nosed reindeer\" or \"Frosty\". These songs aren't considered religious songs as they discuss generally snow and Santa and Christmas scenes. What about singing parodies such as <a href=\"http://www.hackensacknow.org/index.php?topic=1313.0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O Little Town of Hackensack</a>? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is a good question and the answer to the specific example here is no, it would not be permissible. The concept of <em>not following their ways</em> is not only restricted to religious elements. It applies to their distinctive habits and customs (minhagim) anything that in a specific time period distinguishes between traditional Jewish behavior and fashionable, non-Jewish behavior.</p>\n\n<p>For example, what follows is from Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 3:2 dealing with clothing and modesty.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We do not act in the ways of the nations, and we do not emulate them--not in dress, nor in hair style, and the like--as it says, \"And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation\" (Leviticus 20:23). And as it says, \"Neither shall ye walk in their statutes\" (Leviticus 18:3). And as it says, \"Take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them\" (Deuteronomy 12:30). One must not dress in clothing unique to them for pride, i.e. clothing worn by officers. For example, it is stated in the Gemara (Sanhedrin 74a) that it is forbidden for a Jew to act like them, even regarding shoelaces. If they would tie [their shoes] in one way, and Jews would tie another way, or if their custom was to have red laces, and Jews would have black (for the color black is instructive in humility, lowliness, and modesty), it is forbidden for a Jew to differ. And from this every person should learn, according to his time and place, that the clothing that is made for arrogance and licentiousness--a Jew may not use it. Rather, his dress must be made in a way that is instructive of submissiveness and modesty. So it is said in the Sifri that you must not say, \"Since they go out in purple, I too will go out in purple,\" or \"Since they go out with kolasin, i.e. weapons, I too will go out with weapons.\" For these are matters of arrogance, and this is not the portion of Jacob. Rather, their [the children of Jacob] way is to be modest and humble, and not to turn toward conceit. And so too anything which they [the nations] do that can be suspected of containing an iota of foreign worship, a Jew may not do it. And so he may not shave his head or grown his hair like them. Rather, he must separate himself from them in dress and speech and in all his other actions, just as he separates himself from them in his knowledge and opinions. And so it is said, \"And I have set you apart from the peoples\" (Leviticus 20:26).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also the view expressed in Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 178:1 which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור ללכת בחוקות העובדי כוכבים וא\"צ לומר שלא לקסום ולנחש ולעונן שכל אלו מפורשין בתורה דכתיב לא תלמד לעשות כתועבות הגוים ההם לא ימצא בך מעביר בנו ובתו באש קוסם קסמים מעונן ומנחש ומכשף וחובר חבר ושואל אוב וידעוני ודורש אל המתים אלא אפי' מנהג שנהגו אסור לילך בו דכתיב ובחקותיהם לא תלכו וכן כתב הרמב\"ם אין הולכין בחוקות העובדי כוכבים ולא מדמין להם לא במלבוש ולא בשער וכיוצא בהן אלא יהיה הישראל מובדל מהם וידוע במלבושו ובשאר מעשיו כמו שהוא מובדל במדעו ובדעותיו ולא ילבש מלבוש המיוחד להם ולא יגדל ציצית ראשו כמו ציצית ראשם ולא יגלח מן הצדדין ויניח השער באמצע כמו שהם עושין וזהו שנקרא בלורית ולא יגלח השער מכנגד פניו מאוזן לאוזן ויניח הפרע ולא יבנה מקומות כבנין היכלות של עובדי כוכבים כדי שיכנסו בהם רבים כמו שהם עושין וכל העושה אחד מאלו וכיוצא בו לוקה. מי שקרוב למלכות וצריך ללבוש כמלבושיהם ולדמות להם מותר בכל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The conclusion of this halacha is the basis for the possible prohibitions related to sports stadiums. It reads that we do not build big <em>palaces</em> like they do, for big communal meetings. The commentaries to this section of Shulchan Aruch explain that this was related to the Colliseum, not their places of worship. The Colliseum was the site of the gladiator contests and other public sporting events. What transpired at those sporting events was very much the opposite of traditional Jewish behavior. And as is mentioned in a related question already on this site, that was the view expressed by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71217/do-any-gedolim-forbid-attending-a-sporting-event\">Rav Moshe Feinstein</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

(if the kosher food is dry there is no transferal of taste from a non kosher vessel unless it is very spicy/sharp like with a Beis Seor vecharoses see SA OC 451):              </p>\n\n<p>This is the Beer Haitev on seif alef :<br>\n באו\"ה כ' דאם נשתהה הבשר בשרייתו מע\"ל אף הכלי אסור בדיעבד וצריך ס' נגד כל הכלי אם הוא של עץ או חרס דקי\"ל כבוש כמבושל אפילו בכלים ולא דמי לחבית דיין נסך דשרי לשום בו שכר לכתחלה דביי\"נ הקילו אמנם בשל מתכות אין מצריכין ס' נגדו בדיעבד כי אם שנאסר ע\"י רותחין וכן בהיתר ששרוי בכלי של איסור ב\"י וכן איסור ששרה בכלי של היתר מע\"ל שאסור הכלי עכ\"ל ו<strong>הט\"ז כתב ע\"ז וזה לשונו ולא אוכל להבין למה יאסר ההיתר בכלי של איסור בן יומו דהרי האיסור מחמת כבוש הוא אחר שיעור כבישה שהיא מע\"ל דאז נעשה מבושל והרי באותה שעה אינו בן יומו</strong> וכו' והגאון המחבר מ\"א שמע בשם מורינו <strong>רב יעקב מלובלין בשלמא אם הכלי עומד ריקן נפגם הטעם אבל כאן שעומד בו היתר תדיר א\"כ כבר התחיל לקבל טעם בשבחו ולאחר מעל\"ע נעשה כמבושל ממש ולכן אסור. וכ\"כ בה\"י סי' ס\"ט וריש סימן זה ע\"ש דלא כאחרונים שכתבו להקל בזה ועי' פר\"ח שחולק ג\"כ על ט\"ז</strong>. <strong>ולפי הנראה דאין לאסור בדיעבד מה שנשרה היתר בכלי של איסור מע\"ל (ובט\"ז יש כאן ט\"ס ע\"ש) אלא לכתחילה כדין נטל\"פ</strong> גם מ\"ש האו\"ה לחלק בין כלי עץ וחרס למתכות לא מצינו חילוק זה בשום מקום אלא העיקר בזה דבכל הכלים אין לאסור אותם בדיעבד כנ\"ל. והש\"ך כתב שמצא בכת\"י הרב בגליון או\"ה שהרגיש בזה הקושיא וכ' שמיירי שהאיסור קצת בעין ולישנא דבן יומו לא משמע הכי ועוד דהא בכלל ל' כתב קערה מודחת וצ\"ע.</p>\n\n<p>Basically it is machlokes.<br>\n-The Taz (seif 1) and Shach (seif 2 near the end) who both hold that a cli (vessel) that had Issur (non kosher) for 24 hours can no longer cause kosher food to be ossur (prohibited), as by the time 24 hours of the kosher food waiting to receive flavour from the pot passes, the flavour is Nosein taam liphgam (unfit taste) so the kosher food remains permitted.<br>\n-However Rav Yaackov Milublin holds that since the kli is filled with liquid, it can't become pogum unless it is empty for 24 hours, so as long as the kosher liquid is inserted before 24 hours has passed from the non kosher liquid, the kosher liquid becomes ossur after 24 hours.<br>\n-The Pri chodosh says that kovush happens just before 24 hours therefore f the non kosher lquid in the cli is directly replaced the kosher liquid becomes ossur just before the non kosher flavour inside the walls of the cli becomes pagum (un fit) therefore the kosher liquid if straight away replacing the ossur liquid that was emptied.</p>\n\n<p>The Beer Haitev concludes that everyone agrees that Lechatchila one should not place kosher liquid or wet solids in a non kosher kli just like one shouldn't use treif pots that have not been used to cook with for after 24 hours from previous usage.</p>\n\n<p>A bag will not make a hephsek (barrier) between the the juice on the outside and inside as the taste transfers straight through the bag as it is less than a klipa (peel) thick container when Kovush. This is evident in the Taz seif alef: הרשב״א בתה״ה דהחבית שנאסרה ע״י בלע יין עובד כוכביס בצונן אינו אלא מועט וע״כ סגי ליה בקליפת הכלי להכשיר וכ״כ הטור סימן קלה ומשס יליף הרשב״א לדיניס אחריס כגון חלב ודס לענין איסור מועט בכלי גדול כמו שנזכר שס. (accoring to some rishonim the taste even transfers through a thick wall but the Taz chooses not to follow that opinion and relies on the Tur and Rashba). </p>\n\n<p>Conclusion Don't try this at home, but if you left kosher food in a bag in pot that was used for 24 hours with non kosher liquid, which was replaced straight away with kosher liquid and left for 24 hours ask a rabbi if you can rely on the Shach and Taz to permit the dish and he'll decide.</p>\n\n\n",

The Ran said that even nobody needs more than a Reviit. </p>\n\n<p>In siman 472, 9 he said,  following the comment of Magen Avraham that he needs to drink the whole cup lechatechilla and Bediavad the majority of the cup. </p>\n\n<p>The Bet Haddash on the Tur at the same siman said that the difference between the kiddush and the four cups of Pesach is that at Pesach we have a special requirement of \"cups\"  which refers to a whole cup.  For this reason the Ramban stated that even if the cup is big and contains several reviiyot,  the din in Pesach is the same,  to drink the whole cup lechatechilla and bediavad the majority. The Beur Halacha <a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%90_%D7%99%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on Siman 271</a>: adds a proof from the Shulchan Aruch in the same siman. For Kiddush SA wrote melo lugmav in a lechatechilla statement.  Indeed,  in Gemara Pesachim 107a melo lugmav is mentioned in bedivad sentence.  Beur Halacha explains that the intent of SA is to explain that there is no din of full cup or majority of cup lecatechlla</p>\n\n<p>For Kiddush the needed quantity is Reviit and according to some poskim the reviit can be drunk by several persons. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The person making Kiddush for Shabbos (Friday night) only needs to drink the shiur. Other uses of the cup also involve the shiur. However, since the becher is usually small enough, then it is a \"rov kos\". Since many bechers are of the size for which the shiur is a rov kos, people would tend to regard it as easier to always do that rather than measure. Alternatively, many bechers are designed to be used for the entire family. That is, a person pours out much of the wine to be distributed to the family and only drinks the remainder. Here too, people tend to think of what they drink as \"rov kos\" because it is the rov of what is left after what has been distributed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/04/07/size-of-kiddush-cup/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Size of Kiddush Cup </a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The minimum size for a kiddush cup is 86cc (2.91 fl oz). For Friday\n  Night kiddush, some poskim write that one should use the larger cup of\n  150cc (5.07 fl oz), which is the Chazon Ish shiur (Biur Halachah to\n  271:13 writes that for Torah mitzvos one should use the larger shiur,\n  and adds that although kiddush on a cup is not a Torah mitzvah,\n  because the actual kiddush is de’oraisa, it is proper to use the\n  larger shiur, or at least two kebeitzim, which works out to 115 cc or\n  3.9 fl oz). Others rely on the smaller shiur even for the Friday Night kiddush, citing proofs that this is the ‘true shiur,’ and that this is\n  the custom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/sh/ht/fn/48967396.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friday Night Kiddush: How To</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You should use a special kiddush cup that holds at least 4 1/2 ounces.\n  Fill the cup to the rim (our joy should be \"full\"). If you don't have\n  a kiddush cup, any cup many be used, as long as it holds 4 1/2 ounces\n  and is not disposable.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the blessings are complete, everyone should be seated (if they\n  weren't already). The one who led the blessings then drinks at least 2\n  ounces of the wine or grape juice in one or two gulps (this is no time\n  to savor and sip). \"Drinking,\" according to the Talmud, constitutes at\n  least a \"cheekful,\" or approximately two ounces. Only the person\n  making kiddush on behalf of everyone present need do this.</p>\n  \n  <p>The balance of the kiddush wine or grape juice is then distributed in\n  little glasses, or cups, to all those who were included in kiddush\n  (they need have only a taste).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He writes there that the base and the legs of the menorah need to be less than 10 tefachim. However ,the wicks and the fire can be above 10 tefachim.

In Israel his music is often performed.  Isaac Sterns, one of the greatest violinists ever to live, an Israeli played J.S. Bach's music on numerous occasions - Jacqueline Du Pre, as well. The compositions of J.S.

    "content": "# Using obsidian or titanium for shechita knives\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm learning shechita and was wondering whether anyone has tried using obsidian or titanium for shechita.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that due to the hardness of the material in the case of titanium and the tendency of obsidian to flake would make the knives less susceptible to pgimot (blemishes).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, maybe it would make the blades harder to sharpen.</p>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I make chalafim for a living. Neither is feasible. Titanium is not a knife metal because it can’t be sharpened. It’s only considered to be strong in relation to its weight. Titanium is very light, so it’s useful for some industrial projects but is very difficult to grind even on professional machines. Should one attempt to sharpen it anyway, they’d find that it will never achieve a sharp edge. \nObsidian is too brittle to make a shechita knife from. Any matarial that sheds shards can cause ikkur in the simanim. It also is not a matarial that can be sharpened and smoothed. While Chazal permitted the use of a knife that’s edge is similar to “Rosh Hashibolet”, The Halacha today is to forbid it.  (Rema on yoreh deah simian 18, sif vav)\nKnife makers spend years researching the best metals for each type of knife they make. Shechita knives are amongst the hardest knives to produce. It would be technically impossible to manufacture a chalaf out of either titanium or obsidian. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Yaakov buy the Bechora from Esav?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question came up recently, and the immediate answer that I got from people around me is that Yaakov was securing the brachos which are due to the bechor.</p>\n\n<p>However, the problem with this answer is that ultimately, having bought the bechora did not actually help in obtaining the brachos. After all, instead of doing any trickery, Yaakov could have simply went over to Yitzchak and told him that he had bought the bechora and was therefore entitled to the brachos.</p>\n\n<p>Others mentioned the idea of being entitled to bring korbanos. Once again, I don't see the connection between being a bechor and bringing a korban. After all, all the avos brought korbanos as well, and none of them were a bechor.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, why was Yaakov so interested in acquiring the Bechora from Eisav? What did he ultimately gain (or attempt to gain) from the purchase?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are two main approaches to the purchase, found in the Rishonim.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>That Ya'akov purchased the monetary inheritance right generally held by the firstborn.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Suggested by: Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Rabbenu Hayyim Paltiel, the Da'at Z'kenim Tosafist compilation, the Hadar Z'keim Tosafist compilation, the Toldot Yitshak (by the uncle and mentor of R. Yosef Karo), and the Meshivat Nefesh (15th cent.) (Gen. 25:31).</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>That the firstborn generally has certain authority over the younger siblings, who must show a degree of deference to him.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Suggested by: Ibn Ezra (ibid), Radak (ibid), Hizkuni (ibid), and Rabbenu Hayyim Paltiel (ibid) who specifically uses it to avoid the difficulties with the Midrashic explanation that the firstborn carried the right to offer sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p>R. Bahye (ibid) writes that both are true; the firstborn had both unique inheritance rights, and the right to honour from the other siblings.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that the firstborn was designated, at least by default to offer sacrifices is stated by Rabbenu Avraham ben Harambam in his commentary to Genesis (25:31). He gives Kayyin and Shem as examples.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Shadal (there) suggests that the firstborn would take over the household affairs after the death of the father.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>He was indeed interested in the right to bring <em>korbanos</em>. The Midrash (Bamidbar 4:8) explains that the right to bring <em>korbanos</em> originated with Adam (the original '<em>bechor</em>') and had to be <strong>transmitted</strong> through the generations, either to another <em>bechor</em>, or to a <em>tzaddik</em> (depending on the circumstances. The Midrash delineates each step of the transmission). The Midrash continues that Yitzchak gave it to Yaakov <strong>because of</strong> the purchase from Eisav. The Etz Yosef cites Rashi (Bereishis 27:36) who describes how Yitzchak became aware of the purchase and gave his blessing to it. Putting this together with the Midrash and Etz Yosef, it would seem that Yitzchak was transmitting the right to bring <em>korbanos</em>, and that the purchase itself was not final/effective immediately (Yitzchak had not yet transmitted it to Eisav, after all), but was rather a necessary step in procuring the right from Yitzchak.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Could it be that Yaakov knew he had to get the Berocha, and with the guidance of his mother knew he would need to resort to trickery to obtain it.  He then would have had a concern that obtaining the Berocha in this way would constitute stealing, which must have been a moral negative even that early.  </p>\n\n<p>So he bought the right to the Berocha from Esau so that it would not be stealing when he obtained it.</p>\n\n<p>I think I got this explanation from Rabbi Shmuel Mann after shul one Shabbos, after the Torah reading of this portion. But although he was very knowledgable, I am not certain that he was quoting from a source.  And unfortunately, it is too late to ask him now.</p>\n\n\n",

The Midrash Rabbah in Bamidbar 4:8 states that the right to perform the <em>avodah</em> originated with Adam and was transmitted through subsequent generations from individual to individual (either to a firstborn or to a <em>tzaddik</em>, depending on the circumstances). It was also originally linked with special garments that were given to Adam, which were also passed along.</p>\n\n<p>There are sources (Pirkei Dr\"E chap.24 and others) that Nimrod somehow ended up with these garments, and that Eisav killed him and took them for himself. I believe there is also a source (don't recall where) that when Eisav met Yacov that day he was exhausted from having just killed Nimrod. The aforementioned Midrash also mentions that Yacov wanted the birthright from Eisav in order to obtain the <em>Avodah</em> rights which generally went along with it. Rashi (25:31) writes that Yacov thought to himself \"This wicked person is not worthy of bringing offerings to God\".</p>\n\n<p>If we put all of these pieces together, there emerges the following possibility: Yacov saw Eisav carrying (or perhaps even wearing!) the garments of Adam used for the <em>Avodah</em> after having just gotten them from Nimrod. This brought into stark focus the fact that Eisav would likely receive the rights to bring offerings to God (as he was the firstborn), and this thought repelled Yacov and inspired him to immediately go about stopping that from happening by acquiring the firstborn rights from Eisav.   </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Isaac_Bekhor_Shor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

He explains the incident as follows:</p>\n<p>Eisav was a hunter, and as such would often go hunting in the forest for several days at a time, becoming prone to hunger and thirst. When the Torah describes Eisav as עיף (tired), it doesn't simply mean that he was a little tired. This is a description of the perilous situation Eisav was in at the moment. After going on a hunt for several days Eisav was on the brink of death. He was in fact so exhausted that he was not even capable of lifting his hand to his mouth to feed himself. He was far from the city, and any delay in food getting to him would kill him. At that moment Yaakov was out shepherding the sheep when he came upon Eisav. Eisav asked Yaakov to pour him the food (הלעיטיני נא) because as mentioned he did not even have the strength to feed himself.</p>\n<p>At this point, Yaakov made the following calculation: if Eisav would die here on his own Yaakov would be the sole inheritor of everything. If he would feed Eisav thereby saving him from death Eisav would remain as the firstborn and get everything. So Yaakov told Eisav that he doesn't want to save him if it will cost him such a loss. But if Eisav would sell him the birthright then Yaakov would keep everything and suffer no loss by saving Eisav. Thus, Yaakov gave Eisav a choice. Either give him the birthright and be saved, or don't give him the birthright and die of hunger/exhaustion. If Eisav would not care enough about his own life to sacrifice the inheritance, Yaakov would certainly not have to care enough about Eisav's life to sacrifice the inheritance.</p>\n<p>Thus, the connection between Eisav asking for food and Yaakov asking for the birthright becomes abundantly clear. It was only because Eisav needed Yaakov to save his life that Yaakov was able to force Eisav to give him the birthright. Yaakov never brought up the birthright at another time, because there never was another time when he had something to hold over Eisav as he did in this case.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>והוא עייף</strong>. דרך הציידים להיות עייפים ורודפים אחר החיות ופעמים טועים ביער שלשה וד' ימים [ויגיע] להם רעב וצמא וכן היה לעשו עד שהגיע לשערי מות ולא היה יכול להשיג ידו אל פיו כמו שהוא אומר</p>\n<p><strong>הלעיטיני נא</strong> וגו'. כלומר שפוך לתוך פי ואני אוכל  שאיני יכול אפילו לתת לתוך פי ולא ללכת אל בית אבי אך מצא יעקב אחרי הצאן במרעה רחוק מן העיר אם היה האוכל מתמהמה לו הי מיד מת ולכך אמר לו יעקב אם אתה מת מיתת עצמך הרי כל אשר לאבי בידי וכל בני קטורה וישמעאל ולוט שמילט זקיני מן השבי ומן המות יהו משועבדים לי ואם אוכילך ותחיה הריני מפסיד שרות גדול וממשלה גדולה שאתה בכור ותקח הכל אבל אם תמכור לי בכורתך אז אוכילך ותחיה ולא תמות ואני לא אפסיד במה שאוכילך ואם לא תחמול על עצמך  בשביל שלא תרצה שלא תבא לי הממשלה גם אני לא אחמול על עצמך כי כמו שאתה רוצה לעצמך  אני אוהב לעצמי ואיני אוהבך יותר ממני ומחמת טענה אמר לו יעקב</p>\n<p><strong>מכרה כיום את בכורתך לי</strong>. כלומר שתעמוד במכירתך לעולם כמו היום</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Beracha before the Mia: Two girsaot in Gemara. Acccording to our Gemara (Shass Vilna)  in Shabbat 137b  the beracha is \"al hamila\" as for a Jewish boy. The girsa of Rif and Rambam taught that the beracha is \"to  circumcise the converts...\"  (\"למול את הגרים\").  The halacha followed this last version. This beracha is referring to the fact that the custom is to make the mila before the mikveh,  Bet Yosef explained that to make the mila before the mikve is not really a necessity.  But he reported a Magid (Isure Bia 4)  in name of Ramban to explain what is  the rational for circumcision first.  Circumcision is less easy than mikve in the conversion process.  There is a risk that the man would become discouraged before the mila.  We prefer to avoid such cases  after mikve. Because a Jewish man who doesn't want to make mila is a bad result.</p>\n<p>Consequently,  the mila is generally made before the mikve.  In this case the mohel cannot bless  \"al hamila\",   \"on fulfilling of mitsvat mila\" because the man is still not commanded. Kesef Mishne  (Mila 3, 4) explains that for this reason Chachamim made an other Beracha which point not on the present circumcision,  which is not really a mitsva. The  mitsva is that this man will be actually  mahul when he would become Jewish. This beracha,  is a kind of birkat hashevach,  a praise of G-d,  not a blessing for fulfilling a commandment  (Kesef Mishne Mila 3, 4) . Rambam himself said (in the end of chapter 3 of hilchot Mila,  paraphrasing AZ 26b) that to circumcise a non Jewish man who wants to convert is allowed,  (not a mitsva but is allowed) .</p>\n<p><strong>So, in summary the  nusach \"to circumcise converts\"  is for a blessing of praise,  not for  mitsva fulfilling.</strong></p>\n<h3>For the beracha al hatevila (on immersion)</h3>\n<p>All poskim mentioned the fact that to bless it before the immersion is not adapted because the still non Jewish candidate has no duty to immerse.  On the other hand Gemara Pesachim 7b cited this case as an exception to the principle following which a blessing on a mitsva needs to be said before the mitsva making,  following the understanding  of Rabenu Chanan'el and the Rif. The immersion in  the  mikve has a double effect,  to make the man Jewish,  and to clean him from a special uncleanness. For a Jewish man,  to rid of this uncleanness is a mitsva. <strong>He says this beracha as already  member of Jewish nation, as a beracha acharona,  regarding the cleaning of the uncleanness.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The wording of the blessing is \"to circumcise the converts\". That means that <strong>once someone qualifies to be converted</strong>, there is a <em>mitzvah</em> (see Krisus 9a where the Talmud learns from the verse in Bamidbar 15:15 that a convert must undergo <em>milah</em>) to circumcise them. There is no implication that we are supposed to circumcise just anybody!</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, Yosef showed that he had \"inside information\" and his interpretation was accepted.</p>\n\n<p>A similar idea (without the clever reference to Tehillim 81) can be found in Medrash Tanchuma 3, in which the Medrash contrasts all of the discrepancies between what Pharaoh actually dreamed with what he told Yosef. Yosef told Pharaoh that G-d would provide the answer (Bereishis 40:16), at which point Pharaoh changed things in order to test him. The Medrash relates that Yosef called him out on each one (the Medrash actually leaves out the aforementioned, about the bank of the Nile). Realizing that Yosef was getting his info from G-d, he accepted his interpretation and appointed him as viceroy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/let-my-nation-descend.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Let My Nation Descend\"</a> says that Paroh also dreamt and forgot the interpretation, and he was hoping that someone could jog his memory.

He notes the word \"<em>chazar</em> - returned\", but also that it was said that Rabbi Aqiva hadn't studied Torah until he was 40. In his depiction, Akiva starts studying and feels like he's not getting anywhere. About to give up, others show him the water on the stone, letting him draw the conclusion about carving. Akiva learns that these things take time, and giving up that soon was premature.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>באבות דר׳ נתן פ״ו וז״ל: מה היתה תהילתו של ר׳ עקיבא , אמרו בן ארבעים שנה היה ולא שנה כלום. פעם אהת היה עומד על פי הבאר, אמר \"מי חקק אבן זו?\" אמרו לו \"המים שתדיר נופלים עליה בבל יום.\" אמרו לו \"עקיבא, אי אתה קורא אבנים שחקו מים.\" מיד היה דן ר' עקיבא קו״ח בעצמו, מה רך פסל את הקשה , ד\"ת שקשה בברזל, על אחת כמה וכמה שיחקקו את לבי שהוא בשר ודם! מיד חזר ללמוד תורה כו׳ ע״ש.</p>\n<p>כי ר׳ עקיבא בתחילת לימודו , באין רושם מוצאת אצלו; אמר נואש לנפשו, והראו לו סתירת הדבר משפיכת המים על האבן ׳ אשר לא יראה מאומה השתנות בהאבן, ועכ׳׳ז המחקרים בשכלם גוזרים, כי נעשה רושם נעלם מהרגש אנושי, היא הסיבה לחקיקת האבן ׳ מריגוי המים ברבות הימים , מחתקבצות הרשימות הבלי נרגשות:</p>\n<p>Avos DeRabbi Natan ch. 6: What was R' Aqiva's beginning? They said he was 40 years old and hadn't studied anything. One time he was standing by the mouth of a spring. He said, \"Who engraved into this stone?\" They told him, \"The water that constantly falls on it every day.\" They said to him, \"Aqiva, do you not encounter [other] stones that were engraved by water?\" Immediately, R' Aqiva made an a fortiori argument about himself. \"If something soft can carve something hard, Torah thoughts which are as 'hard as iron' all the more so it can engrave itself one my heart which of flesh and blood!\" Immediately he returned to his Torah study. (Etc... See there.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Yisrael explains the quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Rabbi Aqiva was starting his learning, there was no impression left on him. He said he felt desperately alone. So they showed him a contradiction to this idea [his frustration and desperation -mb] from the pouring of water upon stonem which does not appear capable of changing the stone.  even so those who seek with their minds conclude that it makes an impression that is hidden from human perception. It [that invisible impression] is the reason for the engraving in the stone from all the water in the multitude of water in the accumulation of unfelt impressions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To Rabbi Yisrael, the story is one of not giving up hope when one's learning just isn't working. We might think nothing is happening, but we are wrong. Every exposure is an impression, and added up over time change is real.</p>\n<p>(The advertising industry is built on abusing this same idea. No one thinks someone will choose heart medication or a political candidate because they saw an ad once. But many such impressions, over time, does end up swaying attitudes.)</p>\n<p>Notice that R' Yisrael's message requires understanding that R' Aqiva didn't once learn in his youth and pick it up a long time later when he saw the stone. Rather, the stone was a step within his starting to learn. Just not the very first step.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that if you do not actually know if the piece of meat you are eating is \"chalak\" or not, (of course you know the hechsher is definitely not \"chalak\" but that doesn't matter here) then you can eat it at an Ashkenazi home; especially if it is a seudas mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Ashkenazi meat processors do not remove the better meat and throw it out! They just allow for the lenient meat to be included in the food offered. Therefore, no one knows if this steak from the package is from an extra smooth lunged cow or from one where the Ashkenazi Rabbi allowed for certain innocent lung issues that a Sefardi would not accept.</p>\n\n<p>So it becomes a doubt of a doubt.

    "content": "# Understanding Rashbam to Vayishlach 32:27\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/tnh_text.asp?id=168\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Rashbam</em> to Genesis 32</a> says that the purpose of <em>Yaakov</em>'s crossing <em>Yabok</em> river was to avoid meeting <em>Esav</em>. (See his commentary to verses 21–26.) In verse 25, he explains, an angel fought with <em>Yaakov</em> to prevent that escape, so that <em>Esav</em> could hurt him. In verse 26, then, the angel was unable to win the fight, <em>Yaakov</em> sought to escape against the angel's will, and the angel injured <em>Yaakov</em>'s leg [seemingly as a last-ditch effort to prevent the escape, though <em>Rashbam</em> doesn't say]. Then verse 27 reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said, \"Let me go [<em>or:</em> send me] for dawn has broken.\" He replied, \"I won't let you go [<em>or:</em> send you] unless you've blessed me.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most commentaries attribute the first of those speeches to the angel and the second to <em>Yaakov</em>. <em>Rashbam</em> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>for dawn has broken:</strong> and because the day has illuminated, now you should go on your way</p>\n<p><strong>unless you've blessed me:</strong> that you send me from you in peace, that I not be damaged by the fact that I fought with you, for now dawn has broken. Then <em>Yaakov</em> knew that he's an angel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't understand this <em>Rashbam</em>. Specifically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What does \"for now dawn has broken\" have to do with the request for a blessing that the speaker (<em>Yaakov</em>?) not be damaged by having fought? Why does <em>Rashbam</em> write that phrase there?</li>\n<li>How did <em>Yaakov</em> learn just at that juncture that the angel was an angel, and how does the <em>Rashbam</em> know this?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A possible answer.</p>\n\n<h2>Rashbam Bereshit 32, 27:</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי עלה השחר - ‏\n  וכיון שהאיר היום מעתה יש לילך לדרכך. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The angel said that now he will to leave Yaakov continue on his way (\"you can,  if you want,  to continue on your way\") because the angel cannot continue to lock Yaakov after the dawn.</p>\n  \n  <p>כי אם ברכתני - \n  שתשלחני מאתך בשלום, שלא אהיה ניזוק (1) במה (באתר דעת כתוב כמה, ונראה שהוא טעות סופר) שנתאבקתי עמך, כי עתה עלה השחר אז ידע יעקב שהוא מלאך. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>When Yaakov identified his aggessor at dawn, he realized this wrestler was not a man, but an angel. Therefore, Yaakov was afraid of the the possibility of angel's resentment. He required a guarantee that the angel does not bear a grudge. {we can reflect about the deeper meaning of the light of the day}. \"תשלחני לשלום\" is a paraphrase of \"כי אם ברכתני\". \"you wish me Shalom, entirety\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"כי עלה השחר\" (for dawn has broken) The intent of the angel to leave is linked with the end of the time alloted to him. Additionally, the dawn added visual acuity to Yaakov, who became  able to discern that the man was actually an angel.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>1.What does \"for now dawn has broken\" have to do with the request for a blessing that the speaker (Yaakov?) not be damaged by having fought? Why does Rashbam write that phrase there?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--></strong> Yaakov discerned that he is a angel, and may bear a gruge. Rashbam explains that the dawn has a second consequence, the discernement of Yaakov was enhanced thanks to the sun light.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>2.How did Yaakov learn just at that juncture that the angel was an angel, and how does the Rashbam know this?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--></strong> Thanks to the power of the sunlight.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(1) See <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14034&st=&pgnum=42&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni on the verse</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא תהיה נוטר איבה. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>That you will not bear grudge against me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the note 17 in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40236&st=&pgnum=80&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> page, an other explanation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Keeping in mind the idea that the actions of the Patriarchs are a sign for the children, like is learned from Sefer Noam Elimelech explaining Chullin 7a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ואך דהענין הוא דאבות סימן לבנים:</strong> והפירוש הוא כך שכל דבר ודבר בתחילתו לפעול איזה נס הוא קשה מאד אבל כיון שכבר נעשה פעם אחת כבר יכולים הצדיקים שיהיו אחר כך לעשות כזאת אפילו כמה פעמים כיון שנפתח השער. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"<em>Thus, the concept is that the Avot are a sign for the descendants: And the meaning is that everything that occurs via some miracle, in its first occurrence is extremely difficult. But since it was already accomplished once, the Tzaddikim who come after that time will be able to do like this, even many times since the door was already opened.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>And also from the commentary of Ramban to Sefer Bereshit, parshat Lech Lecha 12:6 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויעבור  אברם בארץ עד מקום שכם. <strong>אומר לך כלל תבין אותו בכל הפרשיות הבאות בענין אברהם יצחק ויעקב</strong> והוא ענין גדול הזכירוהו רבותינו בדרך קצרה ואמרו <strong>כל מה שאירע לאבות סימן לבנים</strong> ולכן יאריכו בכתובים בספר המסעות וחפירות הבארות ושאר המקרים ויחשוב החושב בהם כאלו הם דברים מיותרים אין בהם תועלת <strong>וכולם באים ללמד על העתיד</strong> כי <strong>כאשר יבוא המקרה לנביא משלשת האבות</strong> יתבונן ממנו <strong>הדבר הנגזור לבא לזרע</strong>ו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"<em>And Avram passed over the land until Shechem:</em> This says a general rule to you. You will apply it as a construct in regard to all the coming parshiyot in regard to the concept of Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov. And it is a major concept which our Rabbis recall in a brief way. They say, \"Everything which happens to the Avot is a sign for the descendants.\" And therefore, the travels, and the digging of the wells and the other events will go on at great length in the texts of the sefer. And one might come think about them as if they are extraneous and that they are of no importance. And all of them come to teach about the future. Because when an event will happen to a Prophet from among the three Patriarchs, it is to be understood from it that the thing is decreed to happen to their descendants.\"</p>\n\n<p>And so this episode too is a spiritual wrestling match which is setting up a paradigm within the Torah to help clarify the future of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning how Rashbam understood here that the opponent was an angel is likely following the same line of reasoning which Rashi expressed in Bereshit 33:10.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=432\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siftei Chachomim to 32:25</a> explains that Rashi understands grammatically that the word <em>ויאבק</em> must be understood according to its alternate, Aramaic meaning of <em>wrestling</em> and not the simple Hebrew meaning, as Machberet Menachem explains, of <em>raising up the dust</em>. This is because, as the Maharshal explains, this conflict reached up to the Throne of Glory as found in Bereshit Rabbah. This also follows the comment of <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=433\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ba'al HaTurim</a> to the same word. Menachem took the conflict to be literal but Chazal understood it to be a spiritual conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Because the episode was not according to the plain meaning, Chazal understood Yaacov's opponent to be an angel and not a human being. And so, in context, it would mean that Yaacov recognized the true identity of this angel via prophecy and not through his physical eyes which follows the comment of Ba'al HaTurim to 32:23 who explains that Yaacov was seeing his future descendants in this episode. And this would also agree with the precise wording of Ramban and the concept of <em>the actions of the Patriarchs are a sign for the descendants</em>. Because the Patriarchs are prophets.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning the question of what this spiritual paradigm corresponds with, it appears to relate to the final redemption.</p>\n\n<p>Like is found in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9754&st=&pgnum=65\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary of Ohr HaChayim to VaYikra 6:2</a>, the period of exile is compared to night. Similarly, redemption is compared to day. In the context of this episode between Yaacov and the angel of Eisav, the sunrise corresponds with the beginning of the final redemption and the conflict that will be manifest between the descendants of Yaacov and Eisav.</p>\n\n<p>In the spiritual paradigm, Yaacov is not simply an individual but rather the representative of the entire Jewish people (All twelve tribes arose from Yaacov) like is explained in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9617&st=&pgnum=415\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary of Ohr HaChayim on Devarim 32:9</a>. This is just as the angel is the supervising angel for all of Eisav, not just a single person, like the Ohr HaChayim explains on Devarim 32:8.</p>\n\n<p>As the story relates, Yaacov feared that the angel of Eisav might be able to hurt him. This angel intended to kill Yaacov. But the angel was unable to overcome Yaacov due to HaShem's decree. So the angel settled for touching the <em>Kaf-Yerech</em> (כף-ירך יעקב), <em>the sciatic nerve</em> of Yaacov's thigh, meaning he damaged or <em>took the soul</em> so to speak (ותקע כף-ירך יעקב) via Yaacov's sciatic nerve. This follows the meaning of the word according to the Malbim on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeremiah 6:8</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>תקע נפשי ממך. שרשו יקע, ובא על הסרת הדבר ממקום דבוקו, ותקע כף ירך יעקב</strong>, והומלץ פה על הסרת דבקת הנפש לאהבה אל השנאה, כמו ותקע נפשי מעליה (יחזקאל כ''ג) :‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In context, it means that the <em>Kaf-Yerech</em> represents something specific pertaining to the whole of the Jewish people as it relates to the final redemption.</p>\n\n<p>This allusion to the redemption also appears to connect with the root <em>Taka</em> (תקע) which relates to the blowing of the Great Shofar (תקיעת שופר הגדול) three times, signaling the time of the final redemption like is found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38251&st=&pgnum=31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Avkat Rochel at the beginning of the eighth sign of Moshiach</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Kaf-Yerech</em> appears to be an allusion to Moshiach be Yosef who, according to Midrash, appears at the beginning of the final redemption and is either prematurely murdered by the soldiers of Armilus or simply dies upon completing his mission as is explained in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38251&st=&pgnum=30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Avkat Rochel in the seventh sign of Moshiach</a> concerning Nechemiah ben Chushiel who is Moshiach ben Yosef. And so the blessing which Yaacov Avinu demanded was that he incur no damage as a result of wrestling with this angel. That Moshiach be Yosef would not be murdered, but that he would complete his mission.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of <em>Crossing the Yabbok</em> which is mentioned in this story also appears to hint to this idea of death and mourning as it relates to attaining a higher level of life like is found in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14051&st=&pgnum=14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">authors introduction</a> to the classic book on death and mourning, Sefer Maavar Yabbok by Rabbi Aaron Berechiah ben Moses of Modena.</p>\n\n<p>One of the longstanding traditions throughout the ages has been to pray for the welfare of Moshiach ben Yosef, that he should not be murdered by Armilus like is found in the siddur of the Ari z\"l on the blessing for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Nachem prayer for the 9th of Av following Sha'ar HaKavannot by Rabbi Chaim Vital, Sha'ar HaAmidah, chapter 6, the siddur of the Ramchal, the siddur of the Ben Ish Chai and as stated in the introduction of Rabbi Menachem Kasher to his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=54679&st=&pgnum=336\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaTekufah HaGadolah</a> quoting the Ohr HaChayim in the name of the Ari z\"l, and in quoting the prayer composed by the Vilna Gaon, which states that the faithful shepherd, Moshe Rabbeinu, David HaMelech and other Rishonim who were compared to angels all prayed that Moshiach ben Yosef should be successful and not be murdered by Armilus.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כמוזכר לעיל <strong>כותב ״אור החיים״ הק׳ שיש להתפלל על משיח בן יוסף שלא יהרג, בשם קבלת האר״י</strong>, בספר ״קול התוד״ מיסודו של הגר״א מובאת תפילה מיוחדת בשם ״עוד יוסף חי״ למען משיח בן יוסף. וז״ל שם בפרק ה׳:</p>\n  \n  <p>תפלת עוד יוסף חי\n  אבינו שבשמים, רחם נא על שארית יוסף עמך, אב הרחמן גואל ישראל וירושלים, מצמיח קרן ישועה, <strong>הושיעה נא והצליחה נא, ציר אמונים משיחא דאתחלתא משיח בן יוסף</strong> נושא חליינו וסובל מכאובינו במלחמתו נגד צורר ישראל ארמילוס הרשע, וכמו שנאמר והיה בית יעקב אש ובית יוסף להבה ובית עשיו לקש, ועלו מושיעים בהר ציון לשפוט את הר עשו והיתה לה׳ המלוכה, והי׳ ה׳\n  למלך על כך הארץ.</p>\n  \n  <p>עוד יוסף חי, יוסף עוד חי, חי יוסף עוד. בן דוד חי וקיים.</p>\n  \n  <p>אבינו האב הרחמן הבוחר בירושלים ושוכן בציון, בטובך הגדול ישוב נא חרון\n  אפך מעמך ומעירך ומנחלתך. ונזכה כלנו לראות מהרה בהתגלות החזון הקדוש\n  שנרמז ממעון קדשך לרבנו אליהו בן שלמה נהורא דמב״י בדרגא דטוב. בפסוקים\n  הקדושים: אל תירא עבדי יעקב וישרון בחרתי בו, ־ ויהי בשלם סוכו ומעונתו\n  בציון, ־ חזה ציון קרית מועדנו עיניך תראנה ירושלים נוה שאנן. במעליתא\n  דזיהרא עילאה. צור משגבנו מגן ישענו, הגן בעד עץ יוסף אשר ביד אפרים, הרם\n  קרנו קרן משיחך \n  בן יוסף כאמור: וקרני ראם קרניו בהם עמים ינגח. השגיבה כחו לעמוד אי כאמור ותשב באיתן קשתו. במלחמתו הקשה נגד אויבי עמך צוררינו, כדבר הבטחתך על נפילת גוג ומגוג (יתזקאל ל״ט): על הרי ישראל תפול אתה וכל אגפיו ועמים אשר אתך. ויצאו יושבי ערי ישראל ובערו והשיקו בנשק ומגן וכו׳, והיה ביום ההוא אתן לגוג מקום שם קבר בישראל וכו׳ וקברו שם את גוג ואת כל המונה וקראו גיא אמון גוג. ונתתי את כבודי בגויים וראו כל הגוים את משפטי אשר עשיתי ואת ידי אשר שמתי בהם. וידעו בית ישראל כי אני ה׳ אלקיכם עתה אשיב את שבות יעקב ורחמתי כל בית ישראל וקנאתי לשם קדשי. שגבנו ועזרנו צור משגבנו להגיע במעשה ידינו על נתלת קדשנו לדרגת מספרו הגדול והמקודש (מטטרון שר הפנים) שרו של משיחא דאתחלתא ״טצ״ץ ביסוד״ אחוז בשני צבאות\n  ימינא ושמאלא — וראו כל עמי הארץ אח ישועוח אלקינו מהרה.\n  אבינו האב הרחמן, תהא השעה הזאת שעח רחמים ועת רצון מלפניך וכו׳ בזכות העוסקים בתקוני צפנת פענח וכונותיהם לביעור רוח הטומאה ולקדוש שמך הגדול והקדוש, בזכות העוסקים בישוב ארצינו הקדושה ובבנין ירושלים, בזכות בניך יושבי נחלתך הסובלים יסורי ארץ ישראל ומקבלים את היסורים באהבה למען\n  קידוש שמך וקירוב גאולת עמך ונחלתך במהרה.\n  <strong>בזכות כל זאת יתיה בן יוסף משיחא דאתחלתא ולא יפול כתפילתו של רעיא מהימנא</strong> <strong>מרע״ה ודוד המע״ה ותפילתם של עוד ראשונים כמלאכים, בעד תיי והצלחת משיחא דאתתלתא מבי״א.</strong> <strong>וכפי שגזרו צדיקי עולם, צדיקים גוזרים והקדוש ברוך הוא מקיים. עוד יוסף חי, יוסף חי עוד, חי יוסף עוד, בן דוד חי וקיים, צדיק באמונתו יחיה, והיו עץ יוסף ועץ יהודה לאחד ביד ה׳, וכל אשר הוא עושה ה׳\n  מצליח בידו.</strong>\n  הבן יקיר לי אפרים אם ילד שעשועים כי מידי דברי בו זכור אזכרנו עוד על כן המו מעי לו רחם ארחמנו נאם ה׳. ויהי נועם ה׳ עלינו ומעשי ידינו כוננה עלינו. בכל ח״י הסגולות והנאצלות של משיתא דאתחלתא במלא השלמות של כל סגולה וסגולה עם דרגת טצ״ץ ביסוד, בסוד הכתוב הקטן יה״י לאלף והצעיר לגוי עצום\n  אני ה׳ בעתה אתישנה. מן המיצר קראתי יה ענני במרחב יה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is one of the meanings of the <em>Nachem</em> prayer said at mincha of Tisha b'Av. When it refers to the mourners of Tzion (ציון), we are taught that this is a reference to Moshiach ben Yosef (יוסף) because <em>Tzion</em> and <em>Yosef</em> share the same gematria of 156 like is taught in the commentary Pnei David to Devarim 9:4.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וגם יוסף גימטריא ציון</strong> ובזהר פ' ויחי דף רמ\"ח יברכך ה' מציון דמיניה נפקין ברכאן לאשקאה לגינתא ובזה יבא על נכון משז\"ל באגדתא דבראשית פרק ס\"ז <strong>כל מה שאירע ליוסף אירע לציון</strong> והאריכו מאד בזה עיין שם באורך <strong>כי יוסף גי' ציון</strong> והוא בחינת יסוד כיוסף ודוק היטב.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a similar fashion, the small-sum gematria of <em>Yosef</em> (יוסף) shares the same value as <em>Kaf-Yerech</em> (כף-ירך) when including the letters and kollel (a sum of 21).</p>\n\n<p>So it appears that Rashbam is showing that we learn the tradition to pray for the welfare of Moshiach ben Yosef from the prophetic insight of Yaacov Avinu.</p>\n\n<p>Moshiach ben Yosef, who appears at the beginning of the redemption, meaning <em>with the breaking of the dawn</em>. That Moshiach ben Yosef should successfully complete his mission and not be murdered prematurely. That is the connection of the <em>Breaking of the dawn</em> to his request for a blessing.</p>\n\n\n",

Christians in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm an Israeli Jew and for a few days I'm in an ongoing online argument with this Swedish white-nationalist who tries to prove me that blood libels are not completely made-up.</p>\n\n<p>He gave me the next two \"quotes\" which he claims Jews use in order to justify \"ritual murders of gentiles\". Now, in the past I've already encountered many times when anti-Semites either complete fabrications (sexual intercourse between gentiles is like sex between animals\") or taking things out of context. But they at least those anti-Semites TRY to cite a source, making it easy to debunk - you just go to the Masechet/passage they give you and just see what is ACTUALLY in there. If not complete fabrications, Those lies are at least loosley based on an existing quotes.</p>\n\n<p>But my guy does not give any sources, which makes we wonder if they are complete fabrications or loosley based on something. Since he gave the supposed English translations of said quotes, I couldn't really search anything for myself (googling those quotes in English just gave me a bunch of other nazi sites using them), so I'm here seeking help from Jews who actually know the English versions.</p>\n\n<p>So, the quotes he gave me - </p>\n\n<p>1.\n\"in the jewish most holy book the talmud we read 'those who kill christians shall have a high place in heaven'.\"\n- he only says that it's from \"The Talmud\", he does not give the masechet and passage which it supposedly comes from.</p>\n\n<p>2.\"In Zohar, I, 38b and 39a: 'Jews must never cease to exterminate the goim; they must never leave them in peace and never submit to them'\n - Now I don't know really how the Kabbalah works it terms of structure, so I couldn't really find \"I 38 and 39\" (I tried searching ט', ל\"ח א' but it didn't help), and even fiding a PDF of the entire book is not helpful since I can't read Arameic (no use for Control+F).</p>\n\n<p>So, are those quotes based on anything?

The topics are divided into sections labeled with Roman numerals under which different \"proof texts\" are brought.\nOn the linked page it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>VII. THOSE WHO KILL CHRISTIANS SHALL HAVE A HIGH PLACE IN HEAVEN</p>\n  \n  <p>In Zohar (I,38b, and 39a) it says:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"In the palaces of the fourth heaven are those who lamented over Sion and Jerusalem, and all those who destroyed idolatrous nations ... and those who killed off people who worship idols are clothed in purple garments so that they may be recognized and honored.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what its actually saying, is that this Zohar is a proof that Jews are given a high place in heaven to kill Christians. I don't think that person understood what he was reading.</p>\n\n<p>I found the actual quote from <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%96%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A8_%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Zohar here</a> in Chelek Beis right at the end of 38b and a few lines into 39a.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונטיל מהאי היכלא, ועאל בהיכלא רביעאה ותמן כל אינון אבלי ציון וירושלם, וכל אינון קטולי דשאר עמין עעכו\"ם... ותמן חקיקין ורשימין כל אינון קטולי דשאר עמין עעכו\"ם בההוא פורפירא, וסליק ההוא פורפירא לעילא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which translates to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And he is taken from that palace and goes up to the fourth palace. And there are all those mourners of Zion and all those who were killed by the other nations of idol worshipers... And there is engraved and imprinted all those who were killed by other nations of idol worshipers in that <em>porfira</em>. And that <em>porfira</em> goes up...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what a <em>porfira</em> is. From what I was able to find, it seems to be some type of wall of fire others have pointed out that is a purple colored cloth.</p>\n\n<p>They seem to be translating קטולי as \"those who kill\", but it means \"those who were killed\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>There is actually only one quote here, and it is taken directly from <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talmud_Unmasked\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Talmud Unmasked: The Secret Rabbinical Teachings Concerning Christians</a></em>, which was originally written in Latin (with accompanying passages in Hebrew/Aramaic) by Reverend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinas_Pranaitis\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I.B. Pranaitis</a>. The quote is real, as are all of the quotes within his tract, and is from the Zohar. The supposed Talmudic quote doesn't actually exist, but is copied and pasted from Pranaitis' book, where it serves as his title for the Zoharic passage beneath it.</p>\n\n<p>Context is a tricky thing to ascertain when it comes to Talmudic literature in particular (and for the Zohar as well, but for different reasons). Pranaitis, together with various other critics of the Talmud, seemed to think that reading the preceding text and reading the following text (indeed, even reading an entire tractate in sequence) provides context. It doesn't. It provides what scholars call <em>co-text</em>: the surrounding text only.</p>\n\n<p>Context is historical and sociological. To provide that, we need to consider statements in light of other statements that are attributed to the same individuals, in light of the time of their presumed composition and - most importantly - in light of the time in which they were edited together in the formation of the Talmud. When you do this, you discover that extremely few of these passages are about Christians at all.</p>\n\n<p>The authors of the Talmud didn't give two damns about Christians and Christianity, since Christianity was by their time a separate religion to Judaism (animosity towards <em>minim</em> in earlier sources notwithstanding), and since it was also a minority religion in Sassanid-era Persia, where the Talmud was written. References to \"foreigners\" or to \"idolaters\" have a long history of being mistaken for references to Christians and censored accordingly, but they were not.</p>\n\n<p>I would go further, of course, and say that even if they <em>were</em>, assuming that Jews act on statements found within the Talmud evidences a phenomenally poor understanding of the development of Jewish law. But then, Pranaitis <em>did</em> serve as witness for the prosecution in the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_Mendel_Beilis\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beilis blood libel case</a>, so his <em>tendenz</em> is not too difficult to establish.</p>\n\n<p>The Zohar is another story of course, but interpreting the Zohar is a problem of its own: as a mystical midrash, it presumes a tremendous degree of familiarity with a large array of other literatures, including the Talmud, so I am certainly in no position to assess it.</p>\n\n<p>As for how much time you are wasting in debate, I would say that it depends. Plenty of well-meaning people frequent the sorts of sites on which those debates occur, and they can certainly benefit from encountering somebody who isn't an idiot. But the purveyors of this material are not going to learn anything from you, since the sort of stuff peddled by modern-day antagonists of the Talmud is already quite sophisticated, and is generally authored by people who know better. They will argue, for example, that the Talmud also encourages Jews to lie about what the Talmud says, so try getting past that one.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to read more about this sort of thing, Rabbi Gil Student provides a variety of sources <a href=\"http://talmud.faithweb.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Also, Peter Schäfer has a book called <em>Jesus in the Talmud</em>, which investigates the Jesus references, and which does not take an apologetic approach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I am new to this site and am shocked to see the old Jews-killing-Christians \"blood lible\" revived and even entertained as a serious topic for \"academic\" discussion in these pages! </p>\n\n<p>My answer to the Jew hater who confronts you with this repulsive canard is that only someone seeking truth is worthy of an answer. He is obviously not seeking to be enlightened. He is simply trying to cause anguish and insult with his specious assertions. If, as a Jew, you try to answer his accusatory \"questions\", you are just groveling for his approval and he'll just despise you even more!</p>\n\n<p>How am I so sure that his \"questions\" are insincere and that he is fully aware that his \"proofs from the Talmud\" are lies and distortions? For rather obvious reasons!</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>As you noted, the anti-Semitic \"proofs\" are invariably vague, non-existent, misquotes, misunderstandings, or, in rare cases, possibly real, but taken from extremist views that were not accepted by the mainstream. It would be akin to my taking the anti-Semitic ranting of the KKK as being characteristic of mainstream Christian doctrine. It is not.</p></li>\n<li><p>In our world which is filled with extremist violence with tens of thousands of Christians being tortured and murdered by fanatical Islamists on a daily basis, is it not laughable that the moronic anti-Semite finds time to focus his venom against the Jews? When was the last time a Christian was found murdered and baked into a matzoh? </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Wait - perhaps that's what puts the \"Man\" in \"Manishevitz!!!</p>\n\n<p>(Watch, the humorless idiots will probably run with this one.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, ask the hypocrite when was the last time he feared for his life walking around in a Jewish neighborhood?</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The most compelling sign, however, that your anti-Semite is not really looking to be correctly informed, is that for all the supposed denigration of \"goyim\" in the Talmud, he has overlooked (deliberately) an overwhelming number of instances where the Talmud instructs Jews to treat \"goyim\" - even those living under Judaic rule, with kindness, respect and humanity.\nFor example - Talmud Gittin 59b and again in 61a: \"Do not prevent the gentile poor from collecting the gleanings of your field. Also a community must support the poor of the gentiles and visit their sick together with the Jewish ones, etc., for these are the ways of peace.\"</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Also, Talmud Baba Metziah 32a: (One who finds) an animal of a gentile must care for it (until it can be returned to him), just as for a Jew's animal... so there should not be hatred (caused by discrimination).</p>\n\n<p>Many, many such passages can be sited in the Talmudic canon as well as in the classic Talmudic commentaries and more recent codifiers of Jewish law. So, in contrast to the savage ravings of anti-Semitic literature, the Talmud is hardly a manifesto for \"Goy murder\" - only in the fervid imagination of the anti-Semite.</p>\n\n\n",

And then there is a dispute if the orientation of parashas should be placed vertical or horizontal.  And there is another dispute if the writing should be on the hair side of the skin or the meat side.  This makes 16 pair (of systems) and there is a dispute of the R\"osh and the R\"ambam regarding leaving space when a \"stuma\" paragraph (i.e. one that finishes in the middle of a row) is written -- 32 systems.

The coat went from Noach to Cham and was then given to Nimrod. Later we know that Eisav killed Nimrod and took the coat. (Ibid.)</p>\n\n<p>Later we learn the story of Yaakov and the blessings where Rivka gives to Yaakov a wool garment that belonged to Eisav so as not to get caught by Yitzchak. </p>\n\n<p>In Vayeishev all of a sudden as a sign of love, Yaakov gives a coat to Yosef. Perhaps this coat is the same coat passed down from Adam Harishon?</p>\n\n<p>If it's true, that the coat was given over to Yaakov when Rivka took it. How could that be? If the special powers of the garment were its aid in hunting, why didn't Eisav take it along with him, he just went out to hunt for his father so he should bless him, surely he would have brought it along?</p>\n\n<p>Further, why would Yosef's brothers, who surely knew the great lineage and significance of the coat, destroy it? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22744&st=&pgnum=94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Drebbi Eliezer</a> (end of chapter 24) writes that Yaakov buried the coat after receiving the blessing from his father, in order to prevent it from returning to the hands of Eisav. I would assume that was the end of the line for the coat, though it could be argued that some time later he retrieved it at a time when he felt confident that Eisav wouldn't get it (and that it was somehow preserved in the interim). Also, the wording of the verse, that he \"made\" a coat for Yosef, would suggest it was a new coat.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24980&st=&pgnum=46\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Korban Shabbos</a> (based on Targum Yerushalmi and other sources) seems to suggest that Yosef's coat  was indeed that of Adam.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your second question, I haven't seen any sources that discuss it, but here's my own (arguably far-fetched) theory: Alshich writes that they had animals readily available and thus there was no need for Eisav to hunt in order to obtain meat for his father. However, Yitzchak specifically wanted to make it difficult for Eisav, so that it would be a bigger mitzvah. Perhaps Eisav, in the spirit of this request, purposefully made it more challenging for himself by hunting without the coat. Maybe it could even be suggested that Yitzchak himself was instructing him to do so: he commanded his son to bring \"your sword and bow\", but not the coat! </p>\n\n<p>Regarding your last question, first of all the plain meaning of the verse and the understanding of most commentators and translations is that they merely dipped the coat in blood, but did not necessarily tear it. Even according to the opinion (cited by Ramban) that they did tear it, one could explain as follows: the brothers needed their father to believe that Yosef was dead for their plan to succeed. There are commentators who write that the brothers believed that their plan was the right thing to do; they didn't view themselves as simply acting out of jealousy. Destroying the coat was thus, in their eyes, an act of service to God, which according to the Midrash was the originally intended purpose of the coat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the brothers' point of view, the coat was owned by two consecutive black sheep of their family, Eisav and Yosef.  They may have viewed destroying it as a good thing, like Chizkiyahu hiding the ספר רפואות and destroying the snake: all good things that had been put to corrupt use.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Induction Cooktop on Erev Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are statements on the web, for example from Star K, to the effect that an induction cooktop cannot be used on Shabbat. My question: are those statements outdated? \nConsider this:\nOne could purchase an induction cooktop that has a timer. There are even brands that have a separate timer for each element. Before Shabbat, set a timer to turn the element off, say, after 45 minutes (to coincide roughly with the start of dinner). Place a pot (e.g., of soup) on the hot element before Shabbat starts. Wait until the element turns off, and voilà -- you can now retrieve the pot and its contents. Does that make sense? Granted this is a very limited Shabbat use (only Friday night), but would the described use of induction cooktops on Shabbat be halachically permitted?\nWould the following be a halachic issue in the above situation? if you set the timer too late, and it does not turn off when you're ready to eat, you might be tempted to remove the pot with the induction element still on.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If I understand, your question doesn't seem to be about induction cooktops so much as it is about timers: can I leave my pot on an open element before shabbos, with a timer that will turn it off some point after shabbos starts?</p>\n\n<p>At first glance, we fall back on the Mishna Shabbos 3:1 -- a pot left on a burning stove before shabbos always requires that the flame be covered, to prevent someone from being tempted to fiddle with it. I'm not aware of anyone who's suggested (or even considered) that this Talmudic requirement is lifted if you have the fire on some kind of a timer. (Or more simply, there's only enough fuel on the fire to last half an hour into shabbos.) The temptation to fiddle with it would still be there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Although induction cooking offers a koshering benefit, the cooktop cannot be used on Shabbos or Yom Yov because the cooking connection is made once the pot is put onto the coil area.  Similarly, one would not be able to remove the pot from the cooktop on Shabbos or Yom Tov because one would be “disconnecting” the magnetic field by removing the pot. </p>\n\n<p>-Star K <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/kosher-appliances/467/shattered-dreams/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/kosher-appliances/467/shattered-dreams/</a></p>\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Miller expressed concern of adjustment and chazara issues on Shabbos with induction cooking. \n<a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=447\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=447</a> Any use of a burner, an open flame or other uncovered source of heat, e.g. an electric burner is forbidden according to all opinions, even for keeping food warm that had been fully cooked before Shabbat. (Mishna B’rura Siman 253, Sa‘if 100, Sh’mirat Shabbat Kehilchata Perek 1, Sa‘if 26.) The induction magnetic field requires the connection directly between pot and stove, thus making a blech unusable. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The following question was submitted to star k March 2017:</p>\n\n<p>Many induction cooktops have inbuilt timers on all 4 burners so you can program them to keep food warm and to turn off at a specific time. What if the timers were set before shabbos and then turned off to coincide with the seuda? Once off they would stay off for the rest of shabbos. Is this permitted?</p>\n\n<p>Star-K's Rabbi Avrohom Mushel's answer:\nIt should be OK if the control is covered.</p>\n\n\n",

Even if his father was a miscreant and a sinner,  one should honor him and fear him.</p>\n<p>Annotation (from the RMA) Some say that one has no duty to honor him if his father is miscreant,  only if he is repented (Tur and Mordechai in chapter \"Ketsad', annotations on Maimonides sixth chapter of\" mamrim\")</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Tur (above cited):</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rambam wrote: A bastard has a duty to honor his father and his mother, despite that he is exempt from punishment for blows and curses unless they repent. Even if his father was miscreant and sinner,  one should honor and fear him. It seems to me (the author of the Tur says this) that because he is miscreant,  one has no duty to honor him. We see this from the Gemara Baba Kama 94: <em>\"'Where the father left them a cow or a garment or anything which could [easily] be identified, they are liable to restore [it], in order to uphold the honour of the father the earlier clause similarly spoke of them. But why should they be liable to restore in order to uphold the honour of the father? Why not apply to them [the verse] 'nor curse the role, of thy people', [which is explained to mean.] <strong>'so long as he is acting in the spirit of 'thy people'?!</strong>  - As however, R'  Phinehas [elsewhere] stated, that the thief might have made repentance, so also here we suppose that the father had made repentance.\"</em> The  Gemara answers that the sons have a duty to honor their deceased father because he repented.  Thus,  if he did not repent,  there is no duty to honor him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Bet Yosef:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Bet Yosef explained that the root of the difference of opinion comes from the understanding of a Mishna in the second chapter of Masechet Yevamot (Mishna 5). The Gemara asked why is the bastard punishable of death  for blowing and cursing his father? this father is not acting as his people acts. The Gemara answered that the father already repented.  The Rif clarified that the son is exempt from punishment,  but the prohibition to hit and curse remains even when the father is miscreant or sinner. The Rif gives a proof from the Gemara Sanhedrin 85a, there,  the Gemara said that the son cannot be dispatched by the tribunal to make use of force against his father.  The Rif deduced from this Gemara that despite the fact that the father is a sinner,  the prohibition to blow and curse remains.  The  Bet Yosef rejected the proof of the Tur in a short Pilpul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Bait Chadash:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Bach gives a proof for the Rambam view from the Midrash which says that Tora gives account of the death of Terach before she tells us the loss of Avraham,  contrary to chronogical order. The Midrash says that it was intentional in way to mask the lack of honor from Avraham to his father. Indeed,  Terach was a miscreant. The Bach made the Tur's opinion less extreme than it seems by a simple lecture,  he said that The Tur allowed to skip the mitsva to honor and fear when this is only by inaction. But finally the Bach conclusion is to follow the stringency of the Rambam.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Conclusion: two views in halacha concerning the honor of bad father and mother,  everybody stated  that the fact that one parent does not behave righteously,  the duties toward him are weaker.

While the Rambam and the Mechaber (YD 240:19)\n  rule that there is an obligation to honor a wicked parent, the Ramo (ibid) and the majority of\n  poskim disagree. The Oruch Hashulchan (240:33) rules like the Ramo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Yam Shel Shlomo then relates a dispute between the Rambam (Mamrim 6:10) and Ravad (ibid)\n  regarding the obligation to personally care for a parent who acts inappropriately. He\n  distinguishes between such behavior when it is due to tiruf ha’daas (e.g., suffering from\n  Alzheimer’s disease) where according to the Ravad there is such an obligation, and where\n  the parent is acting out of ro’ah lev (a wicked heart) where there is no such obligation.\n  While we do not hesitate to describe acting out teens as having a lev rah (wicked\n  heart), we resist thinking of abusive parents as acting out of ro’ah lev. However, the\n  Yam Shel Shlomo (Kiddushin 1:64) and others recognize this possibility and make it clear that there is no\n  obligation for a child to honor such a parent. Where possible, it is best for the child to\n  move away. However when not possible, according to these poskim a child is permitted\n  to take steps to protect himself from abuse and can seek recourse in a beis din after the\n  fact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Harav Dovid Cohen shlit”a has stated [see addendum] that if interacting with an\n  abusive parent makes a person emotionally ill then the child is exempt from this\n  obligation. Since one is not required to spend more than a fifth of his assets for a mitzvas\n  aseh then certainly one is not required to make himself sick.

But is there a connection between the numbers 17 and 8 and YHVH, His Torah and that which is called Good (Tov?). </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The only thing I could think of is a shiur I once read: <a href=\"http://www.berotbatayin.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Iyarlagbomer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a></p>\n\n<p>B’nei Yissascher \nexplains that the forty nine days of counting the Omer can be broken down to the \nnumerical value of the Hebrew “A good heart” consisting of (\nלב\n/l\nev\n – 32) and \nטוב(\n/\ntov \n– \n17). (32+17= \n49) If you count from the firs\nt word of the Torah until the word “good” (“\ntov\n”) in “Hashem saw that it \nwas \ngood\n\",\n you will find exactly thirty two words. Together the first thirty two words (\nלב\n/lev\n) and \nthe word (\nטוב\n/\ntov\n)\n – good \nspell out the expression \nלב טוב\n/\nlev tov\n – A good heart.\n” Hashem \ncommanded us to count the numerical value of “A good heart” in preparation for receiving the Torah, \nwhich embodies the quintessence of “A good heart.” The Torah is the heart of the world. Therefore, it \nhas thirty two paths of wisdom. On the first day of Creation, after creating light, the Torah states that \nHashem saw that the light was good. According to the Midrash, He concealed this light in the Torah. Therefore, the Torah is the essence of good corresponding to the hidden “light that is good.” This explains why Hashem commanded us to count 49 days (32+17) in order to be worthy to receive the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I liked was founding out that the word Elohim occurs 32 times (the gematria of lev, but this number is also literally written with a Lamed and a Beth in Hebrew) in Bereshit, and the 17th word (refering to that which is \"tov\") of Bereshit is Elohim.   </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Maharal speaks about seven being Teva and the number eight being higher (L'Maalah) than Tevah.

And this is a point where I would like to understand you, my neighbour.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>First, my simple answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am an experienced Rabbi who has worked in the field of outreach. That means I help fellow Jews (and non-Jews) reconnect with G-d. In my humble opinion, this is what I have seen among my fellow Jews over the years when faced with the issues of the age of the universe/evolution/abio-genesis etc. :</p>\n\n<p>In general (among the vast majority of Jews), nobody really gives a care. Jews view spending time on this question as a waste of time. They are not swayed either way by scientific or religious argument. Rather, we just have better things to do with our lives. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Detailed answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>1) Very religious Jews - </p>\n\n<p>A) They are very busy building their lives and communities. If the questions come up, some will simply make fun of science as heresy, and publicly condemn anyone who even considers the question. Simple faith will rule in face of any scientific challenge. Science will be assumed to be the evil secular influence and anyone asking questions will be counseled to strengthen their faith and forget about the question. If they persist, they may even be ostracized and may be removed from the community. Most people in this camp will then simply move on until such a question makes the news again. The vast majority will not care; mostly because no one has the time for it! They have no use to actually answer the question and therefore could care less about YEC. :)</p>\n\n<p>Rarely, those in this camp who delve into these questions are failing in life in other ways and are already hurt by their family/community. So, they use this question as a doorway to rebel/complain or justify leaving the fold. They don't actually care about origins. :) They simply want attention and are wishing people would be kinder to them in life. They are not looking for an answer anyway, and therefore don't care about YEC. :)</p>\n\n<p>B) Another camp among the very religious (a minority) actually likes grappling with science vs. Bible questions. They won't actually care if they can't come up with an answer, because they solidly know G-d is the Creator and its OK if a human doesn't understand how to explain everything. But, they really explore the science and Biblical commentary of the Rabbis on this subject until they are satisfied. When these people check out Christian Young Earth Creationist doctrines, they laugh because it is filled with bad science and some fraud as well. :) They also will subject any Jewish answer to rigorous skepticism and may reject it as well ! However, their faith remains strong. After all, its only a question. :)</p>\n\n<p>2) Secular or non-religious Jews -</p>\n\n<p>A) Most don't care. Its simply irrelevant to life. What's a YEC?? :)</p>\n\n<p>B) Many are proudly Jewish religiously despite their lack of religious observance. Some are nagged by the claims of science which seem to contradict the Biblical position. However, this nagging is something they are proud of as a testament to their own intellectual honesty. The vast majority still believe in G-d and the Bible. They will just assume that if G-d wishes, he will answer the question one day for us. No further effort will be spent on harmonizing the question with the Bible. YEC will either be laughed at as intellectually dishonest or ignored in the first place because they don't need to spend time researching it anyway. :) Jewish solutions will be met with skepticism as well; or rarely find a place of acceptance in their hearts. Either way, they are busy and quickly move on, still believing in G-d.</p>\n\n<p>C) Very non-religious or anti-religious Jews (this is rare) will believe \"science is right\" and once again disproves the Bible. They also could care less to hear an answer that harmonizes anything. They also continue to attend Synagogue now and then. :) Needless to say, YEC is irrelevant. :)</p>\n\n<p>D) Some in this secular camp of Jews are actually sincerely bothered by origins questions. They are seekers of truth. If they could be convinced, they will become religious! Still I have never seen such people become convinced by Christian YEC. Certainly they will give credit to some YEC ideas, but the whole doctrine seems flawed to them. They find other answers and become religious that way.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, Jews who honestly want an answer and have the intellectual thirst for it, have found that they will only accept something that agrees to the truth of both science and the Bible while harmonizing both. <strong>This usually uses the concept that science is not a religious method, and the Bible is not a science textbook. I think the main difference you will find between YEC and Jewish thought, will be that YEC finds it easier to discredit science as a means to their answers. Jews will be willing to accept science as valid, and try to harmonize both fully; or accept defeat while preserving faith anyway.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I suggest you read \"Genesis and the Big Bang\" and \"The Science of G-d\" by professor Gerald Schroeder of MIT. He is an Orthodox Jewish scientist. He is credited with convincing Antony Flew to believe in G-d.(a well known English Atheist/Agnostic philosopher who came up with the famous \"...No True Scottsman...\" argument) When it happened, the TalkOrigins website went berserk! </p>\n\n<p>\"Fossils and Faith\" by Professor Natan Aviezer (another Orthodox Jewish scientist) and \"Not By Chance\" by Dr. Lee Spetner (I believe he is an Orthodox Jew as well) are a great read. These books can give you an insight into how the Jewish mind approaches the origins question as opposed to Christian YEC.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

E.g. In Gemara 56a  Berayta said that  non Jewish are prohibited from blasphemy and killed by beheading.  So for RE there is no stoning,  thus,  no  hunging.  For Chachamim maybe hunging.</p>\n\n\n",

It's not unheard of that somebody who is used to davening a certain way might make a mistake, and s/he might not realise that they had done so until a paragraph or two has elapsed.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the rules that concern what a person should do in these situations are correspondingly varied, and many siddurim see fit to include them. Some print them, for example, at the back of the book, while some print them closer to the beginning. It's not too hard for a person to familiarise themselves with some of these rules, but there are a good few of them.</p>\n\n<p>My question relates to a person who has made a mistake but does <em>not</em> yet know how that particular error is supposed to be fixed. As a general rule should they pause their tefillah, flick to the appropriate page and find out how to rectify their error? Is it better that they just keep davening and then learn afterwards what it is that they should have done? Or should they simply go back to the place where they had made the mistake (or even to the very beginning) and continue from there?</p>\n\n<p>In my own experience, there is often a temptation to find out there and then how that particular error should be fixed, yet interrupting the davening to learn something (even though it doesn't necessitate movement or speech) seems improper.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Mishna Berura on SA  OC  104 sk 2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‏ (ב) בתפלתו ואפילו במקום הפסד ממון אין לו להפסיק. כתב הח\"א <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49397&st=&pgnum=95&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">כלל כ\"ה  סעיף ט'</a> העומד בתפלה ונסתפק באיזה דין איך יתפלל כגון ששכח איזה דבר בתפלה מותר לילך ממקומו למקום מיוחד ולעיין שם בספר ואם מותר לשאול הדין צ\"ע ונ\"ל ‏דמותר (עד כאן לשונו של החיי אדם):‏</p>\n<p>The Chaye Adam  wrote (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49397&st=&pgnum=95&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">klal 25, paragraph 9</a>): One who is praying and  has a doubt about one rule concerning how to pray,  e. g.  what to do after he realizes that he had forgotten something; he is allowed to move from his place and to verify (for instance in a book).

    "title": "Keeping the last part of a learnt text for a siyum",
    "content": "# Keeping the last part of a learnt text for a siyum\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a widespread custom, discussed in a few places on Mi Yodeya (such as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9409/group-coordination-for-a-siyum/9415#9415\">here</a>), to keep the last part of a masekhta unread in advance of the siyum. So, for example, if a person has just learnt Pesachim, they might wish to leave the final part of the final sugya unrevised, then learn it in the company of those who are joining them for the seudah. So far as I understand it, this is a <em>custom</em> only, and does not preclude reciting the hadran or the kaddish, and certainly not eating the meal.</p>\n\n<p>My question concerns those who wish to observe this custom, but who are making a siyum in the morning, having just finished either Berakhot, Nazir, Yevamot or Kareitot. All four of those masekhtas conclude with the same brief sugya, which is also included at the conclusion of the davening:</p>\n\n<p>אמר רבי אלעזר אמר רבי חנינא תלמידי חכמים מרבים שלום בעולם שנאמר וכל בניך למודי ה׳ ורב שלום בניך אל תקרי בניך אלא בוניך שלום רב לאוהבי תורתך ואין למו מכשול יהי שלום בחילך שלוה בארמנותיך למען אחי ורעי אדברה נא שלום בך למען בית ה׳ אלהינו אבקשה טוב לך ה׳ עוז לעמו יתן ה׳ יברך את עמו בשלום</p>\n\n<p>Granted, this is only a custom, and granted that there is nothing problematic about omitting this part from one's davening anyway. My question is really about whether one might recite it in their davening and still be observing the minhag of keeping the last part of the masekhta unrevised. Is davening sufficiently distinct from learning as to permit this possibility? Or should one who wishes to observe this minhag be careful not to recite this section in any of their tefillot between completing the masekhta and having the siyum?</p>\n\n\n",

Any advice for girls/women like me with ADD?\nCan I talk to Hashem straight?\nalthough I know the meaning of the words and am fluent in reading I cant really relate to them enough to stop me travelling all over the place while saying them...\nplease help</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is a very challenging question.  As others have mentioned you should ask your Posek to guide you.  However, I would like to share some thoughts for you to consider.</p>\n\n<p>First of all it is important to identify what is actually considered the prayer that you would have to focus on to fulfill your minimum requirements of prayer.  In terms of your basic prayer obligation the Shmoneh Esreh is the central obligation.  The Pesukei Dezimrah are preliminaries that help put you in the proper framework to pray.  The Shema is a separate daily Torah obligation to recite those verses. So without utilizing any of the other blessings in Shachrit, the morning service,  to fulfill ones obligation, the Shmoneh Esreh is going to be the main way you fulfill your obligation. I can give you more detail if necessary, but my main point is to try to limit what you actually would need to focus on to fulfill the basic obligation. </p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam in the laws of Prayer Chapter 4, Law 1(as understood by Reb Chaim Soloveitchik, see below) one need only have intent that they are standing before God in prayer for the blessing of the Shemoneh Esreh to fulfill the minimum obligation of Prayer with the exception of the first blessing. With regard to the first blessing of the Shmoneh Esreh one must have concentration of Peirush Hamilim, the concentration on the meaning of the words.</p>\n\n<p>So if you could practice really focusing your attention on the first blessing to focus on the meaning of the words, you would be in good shape.  The rest of the prayer, you would just need to try and be aware that you are standing before God.  If you find your mind wandering for a moment, just pull back and consider that you are standing before God.  By the way, this is a challenge that I believe all people goes through, regardless of ADD or not.  It just may be an even bigger challenge for you to address.  </p>\n\n<p>Some times ADD can be a result of ones mind moving so fast that the persons mind is thinking about many things and moves faster than what their body or lips can do.  Learning to slow things down in your head can help.  </p>\n\n<p>My response to you above is not to solve your challenge, however, I am attempting to at least minimize the challenge to a more manageable piece that you may be able to strive for.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik’s Essay on Chapter 4, Halacha 1 Translation\n  by Jonathan Eskreis-Winkler<br>\n  It appears correct to say that there are\n  two types of kavannah in t’fillah. The first type is a kavannah of the\n  words’ explanation, and its basis is from the law of kavannah. The\n  second type is a kavannah that he should be m’kavven that he stands in\n  t’fillah before G-d. As it is explained in his (Maimonides’) words in\n  the fourth chapter: “What is kavannah? That he should direct his heart\n  from all thoughts and see himself as if stands before the shechinah\n  (presence of G-d).” And it seems that this kavannah is not from an\n  aspect of the actual principle of kavannah, but rather it is just the\n  definitive act of t’fillah, and if his heart (mind) is not free, and\n  if he does not see himself as if he is standing before G-d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Or was it small and symbolic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ner Tamid is actually a reminder of the Menorah that stood in the Temple. There was no <em>Ner Tamid</em> as we have it in shul in the temple. I think that you mean the menorah which was lit every day (tamid as continually <strong>not</strong> always burning) and burned as long as the oil each day lasted. One of the miracles of the first temple was that the westernmost lamp lasted from the initial lighting until it was put out to relight the menorah for the next day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/ner_tamid.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ner Tamid</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An Eternal Light (Ner Tamid) hangs above the ark in every synagogue.\n  It is often associated with the menorah, the seven-branched lamp stand\n  which stood in front of the Temple in Jerusalem. It is also associated\n  with the continuously-burning incense altar which stood in front of\n  the ark (see First Kings, chapter 6). Our sages interpreted the Ner\n  Tamid as a symbol of God's eternal and imminent Presence in our\n  communities and in our lives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9925#showrashi=true&v=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 24:4</a> The Ner Tamid referred to is the menorah.

However, I have seen reports that there were extra copies of the Menorah.</p>\n\n<p>We have seen that Shlomo Hamelech had an additional ten copies of the menorah so that they may have been used to light the bais hamikdash and the second temple would have done something similar</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.templeinstitute.org/history-holy-temple-menorah-14.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The 11 Menorot of King Solomon</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Holy Temple that King Solomon built was very similar to the\n  Tabernacle (משכן) in its basic layout, albeit on a much larger scale.\n  One very significant difference, however, was the fact that Solomon\n  added an additional ten Menorot, as well as an additional ten Tables\n  of the Showbread, which stood in the Kodesh Sanctuary. Altogether\n  there were eleven Menorot and eleven Tables of the Showbread. The\n  Menorot stood along the southern side of the Sanctuary and the Tables\n  of the Showbread stood along the northern side.

One aspect I find fascinating is <em>kvi'ot</em>. </p>\n\n<p>A <em>kvi'ah</em> is a 3 letter mnemonic (in some cases, a 2-letter mnemonic is used) to indicate the day of the week Rosh Hashannah starts, the type of year, and the day of week for 1st day of Passover.

Offhand, it seems that the 7 <em>chaser</em> kvi'ah is the rarest (or close to it). This <em>kvi'a</em> causes the 1st day of Chanukah to fall on Friday. It looks like the next time this will occur is in 5784 (Gregorian 2023). I can't recall the last time this <em>kevi'ah</em> occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than manually scanning a historical calendar or typing in trial & error years into <em>Hebcal</em> to see if there's a match, I'm wondering if there is some online program or some way that I can develop a program that will provide a list of specific <em>kevi'ah</em> occurrences. For example, I'd like to input the <em>kevi'ah</em> and a number representing the number of occurrences or perhaps, input a start and end year range.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything like this, around, or can any \"tecchie\" out there provide pseudo code or an alogorithm?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm not aware of any online resources for what you are seeking, but I happen to have created a helpful calendar in Excel, and have made the first 6000 years available as a Google Sheet <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GQw5RHfE3DVf_ZyYq2Ekj_6_u-Hdl2X-0H6UpsNwY7g\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For your purposes, you could use a COUNTIF formula on column I for the period you are interested in, which will return the number of years of that type in the given period.</p>\n\n\n",

In the case of a man, he needs to uncover two tefachim forward and one  tefach backward. Forward it is allowed to uncover one tefach more than the minimum because of fear from inadvertent spraying.

    "content": "# Commentaries on Sifra\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any good, modern commentaries on Sifra (Torat Kohanim)? I am specifically asking for modern commentaries - I have mediaeval commentaries (like that of the Raavad), but I want something more recent. Doesn't need to be academic; just explanatory. Can be Hebrew or English.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I completely agree with @YK's comment, the Malbim is a great commentary on Sifra.  I believe he had already written on some of Nach, but his commentary on Vayikra was the first sefer of Chumash that he wrote on.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning is the Ayelet Hashachar, which he recommends you skip on your first time.  In it, he lists 613 rules of grammar and drash.  Then on each \"paragraph\" of Sifra (he uses his own divisions which are not always the same as the typical perek/parsha + mishna divisions), he uses those rules to describe how the midrash comes directly from some feature of the words of the pasuk.</p>\n\n<p>On Vayikra he wrote in this style for the entire sefer, including the aggadeta parts like the beginning of Bechukotai.  On Shemot, Bamidbar, and Devarim, he only covered the Mechilta/Sifri for the halachic parts, and did his own thing for the aggadeta.</p>\n\n<p>A minor detail - the Malbim does not cover the introduction to Sifra (Rabbi Yishmael Omer and a few more braitot explaining it), and my Malbim chumash doesn't even print it.  You may want to go through that from somewhere else before you start.</p>\n\n<p>It's an ambitious project, but very rewarding.  (Actually, after 4 pesukim the Malbim realized that his original plan was too ambitious even for him, and scaled it down a bit.)</p>\n\n\n",

What was his objective? Was he trying to demonstrate his strength? If so, why? He could have just waited for the normal procedure of the shepherds removing the rock as a group. Why even get involved?</p>\n\n<p>2)  Yaakov ultimately wanted to find Lavan, why did he need to go through all the conversation with shepherds (previous verses) and remove the rock?  Why not just go to Lavan’s house and say hello?</p>\n\n<p>3)  Why does the Torah include this story?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Seforno writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sforno on Genesis 29:13:1</p>\n  \n  <p>(13) את שמע יעקב, that he had succeeded in single-handedly rolling the\n  rock off the top of the well. </p>\n  \n  <p>ספורנו על בראשית כ״ט:י״ג:א׳</p>\n  \n  <p>יג) את שמע יעקב שגלל את האבן הוא לבדו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on this Sforno I came across a fascinating answer provided by Rabbi Darrell Ginsberg. He was addressing a different issue, but in doing so he addresses the question I raised. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...What plan did Yaakov have then? The Torah tells us (ibid 13) that\n  “When Lavan heard the news of Yaakov, his sister's son, he ran to\n  greet him.” The Sforno (ibid) points out that the “news” here refers\n  to Yaakov’s moving the stone off the well, meaning that Lavan had\n  heard about this event. Why is this significant for us to know? As\n  mentioned above, Yaakov came to Charan without anything or anyone. His\n  objective, as related by his parents, was clear – escape from Esav,\n  find Lavan, and eventually search for a spouse from within Lavan’s\n  family. Why not just walk up to Lavan’s door and knock, rather than go\n  through all the conversations with the other shepherds and the\n  displacement of the rock? As a result of his wealth, Lavan, as the\n  Malbim (ibid 5) points out, was the most well known man in Charan.\n  Showing up at Lavan’s house as a desperate, poor relative would\n  certainly engender sympathy from his host. But Yaakov knew that in the\n  long term, a sudden appearance would work against him. Eventually, the\n  sympathy would fade and Yaakov would be seen as a burden, someone in a\n  constant state of need. For someone whose value system revolved around\n  the acquisition of wealth, power and fame, to relate to someone as\n  being a needy individual would compromise the relationship. Yaakov\n  understood that in order for the plan of his parents to succeed, he\n  needed to take the initiative. He realized that obtaining a\n  reputation, like becoming known for some great feat in the local\n  community, would go a long way to establishing an identity that Lavan\n  would relate to. Based on this approach, it could be Yaakov’s plan\n  developed when he saw this unique situation at the well, where a stone\n  was covering it and was not able to be moved by anyone. By removing\n  the stone, he would achieve instant fame, which he sensed would be\n  appealing to someone of Lavan’s position. As mentioned above, the\n  Torah (ibid 10) tells us that “When Yaakov saw Rochel, the daughter of\n  Lavan, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Lavan, his mother's\n  brother, he stepped near and rolled the stone from the mouth of the\n  well”. It is interesting that Yaakov looks towards both, Rochel and\n  the sheep of Lavan. The obvious result of moving the rock would be to\n  benefit Rochel. Yet he realized it would also benefit the flocks\n  belonging to Lavan, something Lavan would certainly appreciate. This\n  would then demonstrate the importance of the words of the Sforno. \n  Lavan greeted Yaakov not based on the fact that they were\n  related--instead, it was the fame attributed to Yaakov that ultimately\n  enticed him. Therefore, we see from Yaakov the chachma used in this\n  plan, chachma characterized by a good deal of confidence. This could\n  only emerge from his knowledge of the true ideas of God and his\n  ability to place his security in Him...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

After  a  thorough  explanation  of   the  vast  rewards \n  and  ghastly  punishments   that  hinge  on  the  choices  made,  he \n  offers   a final note: Let the heavens and the earth  bear witness. </p>\n  \n  <p>Rashi explains that Moshe was giving them  a tool to help them stay on\n  the proper path.  “Look at the heavens and the earth did they  change \n  their  ways?  Did  the  sun  ever  say,  ‘I   won’t  rise  this \n  morning?’  Did  the  ground   ever say, ‘I won’t produce?’ Or did it\n  say, ‘I  will grow wheat instead,” when you planted  barley?  As  they\n  dutifully  follow  Hashem’s   commands, so too should you.”</p>\n  \n  <p>In  our  modern  world  we  regularly  harness   forces that our eyes\n  don’t see.

They\n  experienced  all  of  the  miracles  in   mitzraim .  They  lived<br>\n  through  the  splitting  of  the  sea.  They  were   there at the foot\n  of Har Sinai, when Hashem  spoke. The heavens were opened up and they \n  witnessed things that no other people saw.  And  so  they  had  an \n  understanding  of  the   ways of the world that we don’t.

There, the passuk tells us that whenever Moses entered the Tent of Meeting he would hear the voice of God speaking with him, only the word for \"speaking\" (מדבר) is spelled abnormally. Instead of a <em>shewa</em> under the <em>mem</em>, there's a <em>chireq</em> under the <em>mem</em> and a dagesh in the <em>daled</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Some grammarians, like Ibn Ezra, see it as a contraction of מן דבר: that Moses heard God <em>as a result of</em> his speaking to him, but Rashi disagrees. Rashi reads the dagesh as indicative of an assimilated <em>tav</em>: מתדבר. In Rashi's words, this indicates that God was conversing with <em>himself</em> (kind of like a background chatter to the universe), and Moses' skill was an ability to tune in (if you will) and listen in.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the passuk, followed by Rashi's comment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּבְבֹ֨א מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶל־אֹ֣הֶל מֹועֵד֮ לְדַבֵּ֣ר אִתֹּו֒ וַיִּשְׁמַ֨ע\n  אֶת־הַקֹּ֜ול מִדַּבֵּ֣ר אֵלָ֗יו מֵעַ֤ל הַכַּפֹּ֨רֶת֙ אֲשֶׁר֙\n  עַל־אֲרֹ֣ן הָעֵדֻ֔ת מִבֵּ֖ין שְׁנֵ֣י הַכְּרֻבִ֑ים וַיְדַבֵּ֖ר אֵלָֽיו׃</p>\n  \n  <p>מדבר: כמו מתדבר. כבודו של מעלה לומר כן מדבר בינו לבין עצמו ומשה שומע\n  מאליו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Like <em>mitdabber</em>.

It says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש שכתבו שלא הייתה להם עצה אלא לשים חצי כזית שמן ותו לא, וזאת היות\n  והמנורה הייתה טמאה בטומאת מת[7], ומתכת הטמאה בטומאת מת מטמאה כמת (חרב\n  הרי היא כחלל – שבת קא: ועוד), וא\"כ כל שמן שישימו במנורה יטמא. ואין\n  פתרון אלא לשים חצי כזית שמן, שלשיטת רש\"י (דרוש מקור) אינו מטמא (ברכת\n  יצחק - מובא בספר דיני חנוכה, הוצאת דגל ההלכה, ירושלים תש\"ס, עמ' קנ). </p>\n  \n  <p>That they had to use half a kezayis of oil and no more because the\n  metal menorah was impure with the impurity of a dead body  and\n  therefore any oil put in the menorah would become impure too. If they\n  used half a kezayis of oil, according to the opinion of Rashi, the oil\n  would not become impure. The article is from the Bircas Yitzchok in\n  the book “Laws of Chanukah” brought out by “Degel HaHalocho”, Jerusalem\n  5760, page 150. No source is given for the “opinion of Rashi”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where does Rashi say that less than a kezayis of oil does not become impure?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Where does Rashi say that less than a kezayis of oil does not become impure?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--> Possibly nowhere, this is against the opinion of Rashi (min Hatora), and against all opinions (miderabanan<sup>(2)</sup>) see bellow:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Tosfot in Nazir 36a, paragraph \"amar Rabba\" <sup>(1)</sup></strong> said that according to Rashi, a food can become unclean min Hatora, even if he is less than a Kezayis.

This Gisra is right according to Rabenu Tam, who stated that Min Hatora, a food cannot became unclean if its volume is less than the volume of one egg. But Rashi refuted this Girsa, because he was thinking that a food can become unclean Min Hatora regardless of its volume. Rashi gave a proof from the Torat Kohanim which learn from a verse that food becomes unclean regardless of its volume. Rabbenu Tam, said that this is not a true drasha but an Asmachta. According to Rabbenu Tam, food becomes unclean when its volume is less than Kebetsa, but rabbinically only. Thus Rabbenu Tam rehabilitated the old version of the Gemara. Gemara asked why the touched part became unclean (the word is PASAL פסל which has a Toraic connotation according to Tosfot).</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Summary, according to everybody less than kezayit of oil can be unclean, according to Rashi Min Hatora, according to Rabenu Tam Miderababan. </p>\n\n<p><em>The wikipedia annotation wrotes \"דרוש מקור\" (needs sources) meanwhile, on top of that, we are very surprised.</em></p>\n\n<p><sub>BTW, the controversy between Rabenu Tam and Rashi gives a proof that the Perush Rashi is not from Rashi, as The Shem Hagedolim reported in name of Yad Mal'achi, because this perush ruled as Rabenu Tam about food less than Kabetsa.

    "content": "# Liability for damage caused by a fallen wall or fence\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Who is liable for the damage caused if a person's fence or wall falls into public property? According to Bava Qama 3:2, if a person's fence falls into a public thoroughfare and somebody is harmed, the owner of the fence must pay compensation. According to Bava Metzia 10:4, if a person's wall falls into a public thoroughfare and somebody is harmed, the owner of the wall is <em>exempt</em> from paying compensation.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an important difference between fences and walls of which I'm not aware? Or are these mishnayot simply speaking of different cases?</p>\n\n<p>Here they are, with the relevant sections in bold:</p>\n\n<p>השופך מים ברשות הרבים והוזק בהן אחר,  חיב בנזקו.  המצניע את הקוץ ואת הזכוכית והגודר את גדרו בקוצים <strong>וגדר שנפל לרשות הרבים והוזקו בהן אחרים חיב בנזקן</strong></p>\n\n<p>If somebody pours water in a public thoroughfare and somebody else is harmed as a result, he is obligated to pay compensation. If somebody hides thorns or glass [in a public thoroughfare], or places thorns in their fence [in such a way that they abut onto a public thoroughfare], <strong>or if a person's fence falls into a public thoroughfare and somebody is injured as a result, he is obligated to pay compensation</strong>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bava Qama 3:2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>וכן בית הבד שהוא בנוי בסלע וגינה אחת על גביו ונפחת הרי בעל הגינה יורד וזורע למטה עד שיעשה לבית בדו כפין. <strong>הכתל והאילן שנפלו לרשות הרבים והזיקו פטור מלשלם</strong>. נתנו לו זמן לקוץ את האילן ולסתור את הכותל ונפלו בתוך הזמן פטור, לאחר הזמן חיב</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, regarding an olive press built on stone with a garden on top of it, if the roof caves in then the owner of the garden may plant below [on the floor of the olive press] until the owner of the olive press makes a roof. <strong>If a wall or a tree falls into a public thoroughfare and harms somebody, he [the owner of the wall or the tree] is exempt from paying compensation</strong>. Time is given him to chop up the tree and to mend the wall, and should it fall again within the allotted time he remains exempt, but if it falls after the allotted time he is obligated [to pay compensation].</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bava Metzia 10:4</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>In the Mishna of  BK,</strong>  Ykar TYT said that the fall of the wall was unpredictable and the debris were in public  domain,  he did not make them Hefker and had time enough to clear the place and did not clear, his negligence caused the damage. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In the Mishna of BM,</strong> the same author said that in this case too the fall was unpredictable and the damage occurred or at the time of the fall,  or quickly after the fall when the owner had not the time to clear the  debris or in a case in which the owner did make Hefker and the debris are no more his mamon hamazik. </p>\n\n<p>All this is in Gemara. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Whose translation is this? It seems to be a misleading one. This one's my own translation, but it's a much more literal one. </p>\n\n<p>In the Mishnah in BK:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גדר שנפל לרה״ר <strong>והזיקו בהן אחרים</strong> חייב בנזיקן</p>\n  \n  <p>A fence that fell into a public domain <strong>and others are damaged by them</strong>, he is obligated for their damage. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In that Mishnah it seems like it's discussing a case where the fence fell and others were damaged post-facto. It uses the terminology that \"others\" were damaged \"by them\" and not that it damaged, and it used a singular subject but a plural verb which clearly means that the \"others\" is in fact the subject, not the fence. </p>\n\n<p>But in the BM Mishnah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הכותל והאילן שנפלו לרה״ר <strong>והזיקו</strong> פטור מלשלם. נתנו לו זמן לקוץ את האילן ולסתור את הכותל ונפלו בתוך הזמן פטור. לאחר הזמן חייב. </p>\n  \n  <p>A wall and a tree that fell into a public domain <strong>and they damaged</strong>, he is not obligated to pay. If [Beis Din] gave him time to cut down the tree and to knock down the wall but they fell within that time, he is not obligated. After that time, he is obligated. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case the verb is both of the same number as the subject and not in the context of others being damaged \"by them\". This time it seems to imply that the tree fell <em>on somebody</em>, not that someone tripped over it. </p>\n\n<p>The distinction is clear. In the Mishnah in BK, it's discussing a case where it had already fallen even before someone was damaged. He's obligated because he needs to clean up his mess - it's equivalent to a pit (see BK 2b). In the Mishnah in BM, it hadn't fallen yet. In the first case, there was no way for him to be able to tell if it could harm. In the second case, although he still needed to take it down, he should have been able to leave it up to the end without it hurting anyone and thus he is still not obligated. Only in the last case was he negligent in not taking it down, and therefore he is liable when it falls on someone. </p>\n\n\n",

The reason given there is because of the ruach ra'ah (evil spirit) that rests on the hands before washing. The remedy given is to wash the hands three times alternating each hand.</p>\n\n<p>The Zohar (I 184:2) discusses the reasoning for this. When a person sleeps, they experience a taste of death. This evil spirit then rests on the person. When they awaken and the soul returns, the evil spirit remains just on the end of the hands.</p>\n\n<p>Poskim from the Rishonim until our times debate if this evil spirit does not exist today at all, or it does exist in a limited version, or it exists just as it existed as mentioned in earlier tradition.

    "content": "# Will people have the capacity to act out of free will in the next world?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The next world/techias hameisim/any world after that- is a place to receive <em>sechar</em> for the work done in this world. I was wondering if in any of these worlds people will have free will (more specifically, the capacity to make a free-will decision).</p>\n\n<p>Another similar question: will there be an <em>avodas Hashem</em> that we can/will perform in any of these worlds?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Free will is premised on the existence of a domain which need not submit to Hashem's will. As the Ramchal writes in the Daas Tevunos, the existence of this domain, while requisite for receiving reward for what we accomplish in this world, at some point will disappear, since ultimately Hashem's will is to reveal his oneness, and the existence of this domain is contrary to this end. So ultimately, there will be no free will.</p>\n\n<p>There will be growth at this point, which Rav Dessler in the end of the first volume of Michtav MeEliyahu describes as a never-ending cycle of discovering Hashem's greatness, humbling oneself, and then discovering more of Hashem's greatness, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>However, before that time, there will be the times of Moshiach. In this period of time, as the Ramban writes in his commentary on the Torah (Devarim 30:6), we will have free will comparable to what Adam HaRishon has before he ate from the Tree of Knowledge. While the distinction between this free will and our free will presently is not so well defined, the most classical approach is outlined by the Nefesh Hachayim: Just like one doesn't have a desire to put his hand in a fire, since he perceives the fire as outside of himself, so to was that existence of Evil before Adam HaRishon's sin. I'd recommend reading Rav Chaim Freidlander's Sefsei Chaim (Emunah VeBachira, Vol I). He has a whole section devoted to this subject.</p>\n\n<p>But practically speaking (whatever that means in this context...) in the times of Moshiach we will have the ability to actualize the potential of our connection to Hashem, according with the effort we exerted while we still had full free will.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Mishna in Avot (4:17) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יפה שעה אחת בתשובה ומעשים טובים בעולם הזה מכל חיי העולם הבא </p>\n  \n  <p>One minute of correcting one's ways and performing good deeds in this era, is better than all of life in the future era.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadok_HaKohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Zaddok HaKohen of Lublin</a> explains that the former is so valuable, since only it allows for free-will.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מחשבות חרוץ אות ז </p>\n  \n  <p>ידוע דיפה שעה אחת בתשובה ומעשים טובים בעולם הזה מכל חיי עולם הבא ויש מצד זה מעלה בעולם הזה שהוא רק לפי שעה אבל בו הוא מקום ההשתדלות והבחירה </p>\n  \n  <p>It is well known that one minute of correcting one's ways and performing good deeds in this world, is better than all of life in the world to come, and in this respect, there is an advantage to this world, which is only temporary, but in it, is the place of exertion and free-will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam understands the Mishna to refer to the period after death. He seems to understand that not only is there no <em>behirah</em> in the World to Come, there are no acts at all; it is simply a static state of being:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאין אחר המוות שלימות ולא תוספת </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems (to me) to be consistent with his understanding of the world to Come, as bonding with the active intellect (referenced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides#Resurrection.2C_acquired_immortality.2C_and_the_afterlife\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>More explicitly, R, Mattitya Hayitshari writes in his commentary to the Mishna, that in the period of the resurrection of the dead, according to R. Shim'on ben Elazar (Shabbat 151b) there will be no free-will:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שבזמן תחיית המתים... אין שם בחירה לעשות טוב או רע </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, (as noted by @EsterLin) Ramban writes (Deut. 30:6):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל לימות המשיח, תהיה הבחירה בטוב להם טבע, לא יתאוה להם הלב למה שאינו ראוי ולא יחפוץ בו כלל </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, in the days of the messiah, there will be no desire to behave badly, and the only urge will be to do good.</p>\n\n<p>This is in turn references by the Recanatti, and Tol'dot Yitshak (the uncle and teacher of the Beit Yosef) there. However, the latter disputes this view, writing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולפי דעתי אינו ביטול בחירה שא\"כ לא יהיו אנשים, וכבר אמרו [ברכות לד ב] אין בין העולם הזה לימות המשיח אלא שעבוד מלכיות בלבד, אבל הוא נטיה כדרך החסידים ופרושים שנולדו מוכנים לכל טובה ומדות טובות </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, he explains that people will not fully lose the will to do bad, rather the scales will merely be shifted, so that like the very righteous, people will have more of a proclivity to good.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>read in Rabbi Avigdor Miller's books (Forget where) that the gemora which says sleep is 1/60th of death does not mean that after death one has no consciousness but rather that one has no free will. that is the \"taste\" one gets from sleep</p>\n\n\n",

Does it begin when the Chazzan (after waiting for the kahal to say the opening words) begins saying \"Nekadesh\"/\"Na'aritz'cha\"/\"Na'aritzach\"?

    "content": "# Was Onan turning Yibum into Arayot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many commentators that invoke the story of Onan as a source for the prohibition behind onanism, but there seems to be a distinctly different issue going on that is \"evil in the eyes of Hashem.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ordinarily, the former wife of your brother through widowhood would be expressly forbidden. It is only due to the positive mitzvah of yibum that the kum aseh is docheh the lo sa'aseh because we are commanded \"lehakim zera le'achiv.\" Onan engaged in the \"act\" of yibum, yet it is expressly stated in the Torah that he engaged in coitus interruptus because he refused to fulfill this positive command. As such, he was not fulfilling the kum aseh and therefore there would BE no heter for him. Thus, Onan wasn't engaged in masturbation, but in an act of gilui arayos with eishes ach!</p>\n\n<p>We find later <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/558049/jewish/Yibum-and-Chalitzah.htm#footnote1a558049\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in the Talmud</a> that some Chachomim decreed that because we are concerned with the \"purity of the intent\" behind the act they prefer chalitzah over yibum, though this is one of the many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum#History\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">splits between Asheknazim</a> (following Rabbeinu Tam) and Sephardim (following Rambam). This would appear to directly mirror the incident with Onan.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a source that interprets Onan's behavior in this manner - as a violation of gilui arayos due to his refusal to fulfill the heter of yibum?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The basic answer to your question appears to be <em>no</em>. The meforshim do not connect the actions of Onan to <em>aishes ach</em>. One reason is that they explain the pesaukim as showing that both Er and Onan did the <strong>same</strong> aveirah. Thus, Er could not have been involved with <em>aishes ach</em>. Additionally, the discussion of Chazal about preferring chalitza rather than yibum does not invalidate the yibum. It is a matter of hashkafa. however, if the yibum had been done, it was valid and the isur of <em>aishes ach</em> does not apply.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8233/jewish/Chapter-38.htm#v=7&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> points out that Er also deliberately refused to allow Tamar to become pregnant. This refusal to fulfill the mitzvah of pru u'rvu is what caused Hashem to punish him. Rav Hirsch connects this with the mitzvah of Pru U'Rvu</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>was evil in the eyes of the Lord:</strong> [His evil was] like the evil of\n  Onan, viz. that he wasted his semen, as it is written in connection\n  with Onan: “and He put him to death also,” meaning that, as Er’s\n  death, so was Onan’s death. Now, why should Er waste his semen? So\n  that she (Tamar) would not become pregnant and her beauty be impaired.\n  [From Yev. 34b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Onan committed the same sin (though for a different reason). That is, since any children that they might have would be called \"children of Er\", he refused to allow her to become pregnant. The first born child is treated as the child of the deceased brother. Thus, the child would have been treated as the heir of Er and not of Onana.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and raise up progeny:</strong> The son shall be called by the name of the deceased. [From Targum Jonathan ben Uzziel]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>he wasted [his semen] on the ground:</strong> He practiced coitus interruptus. [From Gen. Rabbah 85:5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/558049/jewish/Yibum-and-Chalitzah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yibum and Chalitzah</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah dictates that if a married man dies childless, the widow is\n  to marry her dead husband's brother, preferably the eldest.

I know the mean length of the Gregorian year (365.2425 days), but I do not know the length of the Hebrew year. So I come here to find out. What is the mean length (in days) of a Hebrew year, to seven significant digits, like I've shown for the Gregorian year?

Ultimately, the main reason for the variation is to keep it from drifting too much from the solar year, such that Passover stays in the Spring time. Therefore, the mean length of the Hebrew year, after all of the variations, ends up, by design, very close to the mean length of the solar year.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Seasonal_drift\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this WP article</a>, the mean length of the Jewish year is 365.2468 days, or just a smidge longer than the Gregorian year.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>A mean Hebrew month is 29 days + 12 hours + 793/1080 of an hour.</p>\n\n<p>Back then they would add a 13th month into the year whenever the drift appeared to be getting too big, but not on a regular schedule, so it's hard to give an exact estimate of mean year length.</p>\n\n<p>Currently we use a regular schedule of 7 leap years every 19 years, for 235 months in 19 years. Do your math to find a mean year length of 365.2468 days. (No year is actually that long.

A <em>bris</em> is on the eighth day, not the seventh or ninth.  Similarly, we wouldn't put off the Pesach seder or <em>chag</em> service just because that year it happens to coincide with Easter.  The commandment has a timing component and we follow that.</p>\n\n<p>The negative examples (the ones you should reschedule), on the other hand, have in common that their timing is not constrained.  When you celebrate a boy becoming <em>bar mitzvah</em>, which isn't necessarily exactly on his 13th birthday to begin with, is flexible.  If you have to wait a few days or a week, you wait.  A wedding is even more flexible.</p>\n\n<p>A Chanukah party, while not as flexible as a wedding, is way more flexible than a <em>bris</em> or <em>pidyon haben</em>.  Further, while we have a custom of celebrating a <em>bar mitzvah</em> or a wedding with a <em>seudah mitzvah</em>, to the point that people might inquire if you chose not to have a celebration, there doesn't seem to be as strong and universal a tradition for Chanukah parties.  Some families and communities have them; some don't.  As you say in the question, a Chanukah party is not a <em>seudah mitzvah</em>.  There appears to be no imperative that counter-balances the non-Jewish holiday.</p>\n\n<p>You have eight days in which to schedule it.  You can pick one of the other seven.</p>\n\n\n",

He describes how Yosef had experienced a great deal of trauma - he was the 'ben zekunim' (the son of old age) of his father, who was now being sold into slavery, heading to Egypt which was entrenched in tumah (impurity). It was pretty much impossible to escape from a place like Egypt, and it all happened so suddenly. As such, Yosef was in a state of mind where he could well have completely given up all hope.</p>\n<p>However, by having the sweet smelling spices it was sign from Hashem that Yosef had not been forgotten. Hashem was still very much there 'holding his hand'. Rav Shmulevitz writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בשעה קשה זו נרמז לו מן השמים שאין הדבר כן, ד' עמו ועדיין תחת השגחתו יתברך, ואין לו לאבד את בטחונו בהשי\"ת. <strong>הקב\"ה מזמין לו ריח טוב שלא כדרך הטבע , להורות לו שאין \"אבוד\" ו\"נשכח\", אלא אדרבה הקב\"ה מוליכו יד ביד והוא וירד עמו מצרימה</strong>, כדרך שאמר הקב\"ה ליעקב: \"אנכי ארד עמך מצרימה ואנכי אעלך גם עלה\" (בראשית מו:ד) ריח בשמים זה הרי אוה קרן אורה בחשך שבו הוא נתון, ועל ידו נפתח ליוסף פתח תקוה לחזור ולהתרומם משפל מצבו, כענין שאמר יונה הנביא (יונה ב:ה): \"ואני אמרתי נגרשתי מנגד עיניך [העלמת עין ממני] אך אוסיף להביט אל היכל קדשך\". ופרש\"י \"כשראיתי שקיימתני כל הימים, ידעתי כי אוסיף להביט אל היכל קדשך\"</p>\n<p><em>At this hard time it was hinted to him from Heaven that the matter was not so (i.e. so difficult and terrible), Hashem was with him and he was still under His blessed Providence, and he mustn't lose faith in Hashem. <strong>G-d prepared for a him a nice smell that was not the natural way to teach him that he was not \"lost\" and \"forgotten\", and rather quite the opposite, Hashem was leading him hand in hand, and descending with him to Egypt</strong>, just like what Hashem told Yaakov -\"I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you back up\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.4?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 46:4</a>). The smell of spices, was a sign. It was a ray light in the darkness in which it was placed. And through this, it opened to Yosef a sense of hope that he would rise again from the depths of his situation. Like it says by Yonah HaNavi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jonah.2.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yonah 2:5</a>) \"I thought I was driven away Out of Your sight (i.e. You turned a blind eye to me), Would I ever gaze again Upon Your holy Temple?\" - And <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jonah.2.5?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Jonah.2.5.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains, \"I saw that You have kept me alive all these days. I know that I will continue to gaze upon Your Holy Temple.\"</em>\n(My translation and emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, according to Rav Shmulevitz, the sweet smelling spices served to show Yosef that Hashem was with him, and that all the suffering he was to endure still came from a place of love.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Jachter</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Depths_of_Yonah.4.4.9-13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Depths of Yonah</a>, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Torah records that the caravan that transported Yosef to slavery in Egypt was carrying fragrant spices such as balsam and lotus. Chazal and Rashi wonder why the Torah records this seemingly-trivial detail, which appears entirely irrelevant to the story. Why does Hashem feel it is important for us to know the cargo contents of the caravan?</p>\n<p>Rashi (to Bereishit 37:25), following Chazal (citing Bereishit Rabbah 84:17), explains that normally Arab caravans carried foul-smelling items such as resin and tar. Hashem arranged that the caravan transporting Yosef would feature fragrant spices so that Yosef need not suffer from the malodorous wares.</p>\n<p>This teaching is quite puzzling. Yosef is being transported to Egypt to live a miserable existence as a slave. Yosef’s privileged life as Jacob’s favorite son was transformed instantly to a wretched reality. How would Hashem’s arranging for the caravan to carry sweet smells help Yosef in any significant manner? Odoriferous cargo would have appeared to constitute the least of Yosef’s newly-encountered problems. The situation would seem analogous to someone who, God forbid, was kidnapped by ISIS and Hashem arranged for the vehicle transporting the victim to be pleasant-smelling. What benefit does the victim in such horrific circumstances have from the pleasant smell?</p>\n<p>One answer is that Yosef was a highly intelligent person, as Onkelos and Rashi (to Bereishit 37:3) point out. He therefore realized that it was unusual for an Ishmaelite caravan to be carrying sweet-smelling spices. Add in the fact that caravans tend to be terribly malodorous because they are filled with sweaty men and animals traveling through a scorching desert, and having a good smell in such circumstances becomes not just rare but almost unheard of.</p>\n<p>Yosef realized that this rare occurrence must have been a subtle message from Hashem that He is with him and that He orchestrated his sale to Egypt for a purpose. This message Yosef eventually articulated confidently to his brothers. Yosef did not need a divine revelation to ascertain this information; he needed only a sense of logic and sensitivity to his surroundings to become conscious of Hashem’s involvement. The ongoing and eventually dramatic turn of events during Yosef’s time in Mitzrayim (Egypt) encouraged the same train of thought and led Yosef to detect and identify Hashem’s continued support and intervention.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I infer from his chiddush that had Yosef gone on a regular caravan, with the foul-smelling \"works\", he would have felt total despair. This uncharacteristically sweet-smelling caravan was a sign of continued hashgachah from Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

The Ashkar-Gilson fragment has been described as part of a \"model scroll\" for the Massoretes a little later on, mainly due to its arrangement of the Song.  Both those examples, however, have Chets that are extremely difficult to tell from Hays-or maybe more properly stated as the reverse, since the Hays look more like Chets.  I've noticed the same thing in the Aleppo and Leningrad Codexes(never mind the Dead Sea Scrolls), but those weren't meant for public reading like official Torah scrolls are.  I don't know when the \"ask a child when letter identity is in doubt\" rule took effect, but it seems like the kids were kept pretty busy until around the 1400's, when it looks like the problem was fixed by making the Chets look like bridged Vavs/Zayins, and detaching the left leg of the Hays. </p>\n\n<p>So how/when/by whom did this change occur and spread to become the norm, and make the kid's(and sofer's?) lives easier?</p>\n\n<p>Here's part of the Song from the Askar-Gilson fragment using infrared for clarity:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5NCod.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5NCod.jpg\" alt=\"Infrared photo of part of the Askar=Gilson Manuscript\"></a></p>\n\n<p>And here's the Perani photo of the Song from the Bologna Scroll:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2YyGY.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2YyGY.jpg\" alt=\"Perani pic\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I believe that it is a machlokes between Rashi and Tosefos in tractate menachos 29b how a ches looks.

In verse 8, trying to protect his guests, Lot offers the Sodomites his two daughters \"who have not known(Sefaria)/were not intimate with(Chabad) a man\".  Then, verse 14, there's a difference in the translations that has me confused. Lot speaks to his \"sons-in-law\" in a futile attempt to save their lives, who were either \"the suitors of his daughters\"(Chabad), or \"had married his daughters\"(Sefaria).  Which was it?  If they were just suitors/engaged, that would explain Lot's words in verse 8.  But if they were actually married, then -- what?  Was he just stalling for time(maybe recognizing and hoping for the angels' help?) by offering them virgin daughters? Did he actually have four daughters, two married and two virgins? Verse 15 doesn't seem to help, describing two \"remaining daughters\"(Sefaria), which could mean two of four total, or two daughters \"who are here\"(Chabad), which might mean either that there are just two and they were in the house during the incident or two in the house and two stayed with their unbelieving husbands.</p>\n\n<p>How has this been historically understood in the literature - were there two (just engaged) or actually four daughters?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have no source for any of this, but I always thought of Lot has having four daughters: two are married (and are not mentioned within the text), while two of them are unmarried.

See <em>Rashi and Tosfot Chulin 116b,</em>  Tosfot in name of Rabenu Tam  says that there are two types of gastric content,  <strong>not fermented (or chemically altered) and fermented.</strong>  Not fermented milk which is in stomach and the both are cooked together leads to  prohibited basar bechalav (this is the case of Berayta Chulin 109b according to Rabenu Tam).  But when the milk was already fermented,  the cooked stomach would  not be prohibited. This halacha is in <strong>Shulchan Aruch Yore Dea 87, 9</strong> . In Shulchan Aruch a first opinion (Rif and Rambam) says that even non fermented milk cooked in stomach would not lead to prohibition but a second opinion prohibited it. For the fermented the Shach reports several opinions,  some opinions allow to cook stomach with gastric fermented milk lechatechilla (linked to Rabenu Tam)  and some other prohibited even bediavad (Rashi,  ruled halachically by Maharshal).

But this is not excrement concerning the prohibition to read Shema and pray in front of it (Rabbi Akiva Eiger,  see <strong>Mishna Berura OC 76 sk 20</strong> ).\nAnyway when the vomit is sufficiently fermented and the milk or the meat seems denatured it is not besari or  chalavi according to most opinions in poskim.</p>\n<p>But something not fermented is milky or meaty following many poskim.</p>\n<h3>According to Shulchan Aruch I think that vomited milk is not milky, according to the Shach it is milky, at least lechatechilla. The RMA (according to Taz) prohibits only if the milk is not denatured (by digestion).</h3>\n<p>For meat, I assume that the same rules are applicable.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What do our sources say about the principle of plenitude?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the book Nature's Destiny, Michael Denton discusses the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_plenitude\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">principle of plenitude</a>, where he claims that all possible viable life forms on a planet like earth appear to have been actualized (as a sort of perfection of nature. see wikipedia link).</p>\n\n<p>Do our sources discuss this at all, i.e. whether the principal of plenitude is correct?</p>\n\n<p>To quote from Denton's book one of many examples of this (pg.306):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another example where all possibilities consistent with biological\n  design may have been realized is seen in the ways by which organisms\n  move. We have in air, jet propulsion, gliding flight, flapping flight,\n  ballooning; on land articulated legs; in water, jet propulsion,\n  swimming, and even by propeller in the case of bacteria.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The principle appears compatible with the idea of the perfection of nature to teach on the infinite ability of the Creator as brought in the Duties of the Heart <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=414#ch3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ch.3</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Examination of created things means a close study of the elements of\n  which the Universe is composed..the marks of wisdom exhibited in its\n  production, form and shape, and in the purpose for which it was\n  created; the beautiful spirituality of this world; its causes and\n  effects; and the complete perfection for which it was created... and\n  to realize that the Creator created the Universe in a perfect and\n  orderly combination - each of its parts distinctly recognizable, - so\n  that it hints and teaches on the Creator, as a work points to the\n  workman, or a house indicates the builder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>it also convincingly explains entire fields' worth of observations in nature and may also explain what the dinosaurs were doing here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Torah states in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.3?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 2:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְבָ֤רֶךְ אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־י֣וֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י וַיְקַדֵּ֖שׁ אֹת֑וֹ כִּ֣י ב֤וֹ שָׁבַת֙ <strong>מִכׇּל־מְלַאכְתּ֔וֹ</strong> אֲשֶׁר־בָּרָ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים <strong>לַעֲשֽׂוֹת</strong>׃</p>\n<p>And G-d blessed the seventh day and declared it holy — having ceased on it from <strong>all the work</strong> of creation that G-d <strong>had done</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the verse speaks of \"all work\" the verse also notes incompleteness of Creation, the process of which will continue to develop later on. Netziv in haEmek Davar states first the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.3?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">simple meaning</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The plain meaning is that certain things in Creation were not yet complete. It was God's intention to create those things and then do the changes later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When focusing on the difficult word <em>la'asot</em>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.3?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">he adds</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, a deeper explanation of the word \"to do\" is that \"doing\" sometimes implies bringing an object to its <strong>ultimate purpose</strong>. This stage is the true \"creation\" of something because without its purpose it cannot be said to exist. (See also Bereshit 39:22 and 41:34.) Now the purpose of Creation is God's glory as Isaiah (43:7) says: \"Everyone that is called by My name, and whom I created for My glory, I formed him, yea I made him.\" I have explained in Bamidbar (14:21) on the verse \"However, as surely as I live, and as the glory of the Lord fills the earth\" that <em>God truly lives when Creation achieves its purpose and the world is filled with His glory</em>. This goal is reached, however, only when God makes changes in Creation, either temporarily or permanently, which reveal Him as the Creator and Sustainer of the world. God causes those changes which are needed in each hour of need.  All this is included in the words \"His work that God created to do.\" God's personal Providence continues to create changes which bring the world to its ultimate perfection - being filled with His glory. See also the Introduction to H.D. (d) where I explain that man is commanded to bring glory to God by releasing the forces of nature contained in all things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, yes Creation reflects perfection at the given time, but also G-d changes the Creation so that it could eventually achieve its ultimate purpose. Netziv further elaborates in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Harchev_Davar_on_Genesis.2.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Harhev Davar Bereshis 2:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the meaning of the verse in Koheles 3:14: \"For all that G-d will make will last forever; nothing can be added to it nor taken away; and G-d made it so that they will revere Him.\" The meaning is that really G-d's creatures should remain in the state in which they were created. However G-d made it so that He changes the nature of creatures according to time so that they will revere Him. <em>For without this there would be room to say, G-d forbid, that nature is eternal (<strong>kadmon</strong>) and that G-d did not create all this.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These statements are short of support for evolution theory, although they clearly show a degree of perfection of Creation at each moment of history. One has to be careful though with interpreting the Torah because the term \"viable life forms\" is also defined in genetics (1). Many dangerous viable life forms can be constructed in the lab. The perfection that we observe in nature is the fact that the whole multitude of biomes exist in balance with each other within prescribed territory and suitable for extended human life. However, the nature itself may present with many viable forms which can impose a different balance. Netziv was aware of some of the discoveries of the modern science. In commenting to the Flood story's description of the destruction of all terrestial life, he speaks about the discovery of fossils of unknown creatures and wonders about their significance, haEmek Davar, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.7.23?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 7:23</a> (translation of <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1568215215\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Howard Joseph</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, many bodies remained upon which much earth fell because of the force of the waters and these bodies renmained whole. These are the bones that being found by <em>hophnei haaretz</em> (paleontologists), and they find bones of creatures that do not exist today. From this, many judge that before our creation there was a different world with different creatures [Bereshis Rabba and the Zohar are quoted to support the view that prior worlds existed]... However, I find this difficult since it is explained in SHemos Rabba ... that G-d returned all the previous worlds to chaos. Therefore, nothing whatsoever of them remained. It therefore seems to me that these creatures are from before the Flood. Even though they are found in climates not suited to them, that is because they changed their ways before the Flood and moved elsewhere. That strange creatures are found <strong>is a result of hybridization</strong>.... It was Providence that these bones would remain so that at a later generation would come and understand the secrets of nature - and this is  His glory, may He be blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This train of thought Netziv also extends in his conclusion regarding the animals taken by Noach into the ark in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Harchev_Davar_on_Genesis.7.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Harchev Davar on Bereshis 7:2</a>. There the Torah specifies that the Torah specifies that seven pairs of each animal that is <em>tehorah</em> (clean) should be taken and only two pairs of those who are not <em>tehorah</em>. Usually, the opposite of <em>tehorah</em> is <em>temayah</em> (unclean), a term avoided by the verse. After a lengthy discussion, Netziv concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the essential meaning of <em>tehorah</em> and not <em>tehorah</em> in the Noach story refers to the fittest (<em>temimim</em>) as against the unfit (<em>ba'alei mum</em>)...And there is a variant reading in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.116a.9?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 116a</a> that states: <em>And were there pure and impure species at that time, during the period of Noah? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says that Rabbi Yonatan says: The pure animals that Noah took were from those that had not been used in the performance of sin.</em> And it is possible to derive from the language \"male and female\" used for animals <em>ish v'ishto</em> i.e. they were used for sin, as opposed to *zachar unekeivah\" for birds - not used for sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, according to Netziv, each family of creatures was represented by seven pairs of animals from the fittest and two were used from less fit animals, whether or not they will eventually be kosher as the Torah later defines. I.e. a total of 9 animal pairs for each family to have bigger genetic diversity. We also know that 9 is letter ט as in טוב מאד - very good.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) Nathaniel Jeanson \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1683440757\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Replacing Darwin: The New Origin of Species</a>\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Maoz Tzur and Chanukah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The piyut Maoz Tzur mentions both Purim and Chanukah.  Why then was it chosen to be said on Chanukah and not Purim? I've tried researching the subject and asking scholars but have not received a satisfactory answer. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It isn't known who wrote Maoz Tsur, although some scholars think that it was a 13th century German-speaking Jew named Mordekhai (sorry - only a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27oz_Tzur#cite_ref-1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> reference for that one). It makes reference to several stages of Israelite history, and more than one festival:</p>\n\n<p>The second stanza references the slavery in Egypt, the redemption at the time of Moses (although Moses isn't himself mentioned) and the drowning of all of the Egyptians in the sea. This corresponds to Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>The third stanza speaks of the erection of a temple in Jerusalem, and of the fact that even then the Israelites did not experience peace. Due to their having worshipped foreign gods, the temple is destroyed and they are exiled, but brought back to the land of Israel in the time of Zerubbabel. (No festival in this one, but the general theme of persecution => salvation.)</p>\n\n<p>The fourth stanza references the plans of Haman (\"the Agagite\"), the elevation of Mordekhai (\"the Benjaminite\") and the hanging of Haman and his sons. This corresponds to Purim.</p>\n\n<p>The fifth stanza makes reference to the festival of Hanukkah: the torments of the Seleucid Greeks, the ascension of the Hasmoneans, the battle over Jerusalem and the miracle of the oil.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the sixth stanza (in which the first three words serve as an acrostic for חזק) speaks of the messianic era. In doing so, it makes reference to God bringing back \"the seven shepherds\", which is a reference to Micah 5:4, but also a none-too-subtle allusion to the seven shepherds in Sukkah 52b, who are Seth, Enoch, Methusaleh, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and David. In the Zohar (III:103a-104a), these are the seven visitors on the nights of Sukkot (the <em>ushpizin</em>). Whether the author of this text knew the Zohar or not, it's not unreasonable to suppose that this is a subtle reference to that particular festival too.</p>\n\n<p>So, with references to Pesach, Hanukkah, Purim and Sukkot, why do we sing this on Hanukkah in particular? If there is an historical reason, I do not know it, and I am tempted to point out that if we were to sing it on Purim or Sukkot instead, we'd still be asking this question. (In other words, it may have no greater significance as a Hanukkah song than, say, Chad Gadya has as a Pesach song.)</p>\n\n<p>But that said, consider the first stanza. There, the text explicitly mentions the dedication of the altar (חנכת המזבח), which gives us two references to Hanukkah instead of only one. Since the story of Hanukkah constitutes the latest event spoken of explicitly within the poem (notwithstanding the veiled allusion to crusaders in the final verse), and since it serves as a frame for this text, being mentioned both at its beginning and just before its end, it is therefore also able to function as the time at which the poem itself is set.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj5mjVSq4Zk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">According</a> to Dr. Yossi Baruchi, the key stanza is the last one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חֲשׂוֹף זְרוֹעַ קָדְשֶׁךָ וְקָרֵב קֵץ הַיְשׁוּעָה</p>\n<p>נְקֹם נִקְמַת עֲבָדֶיךָ מֵאֻמָּה הָרְשָׁעָה</p>\n<p>כִּי אָרְכָה הַשָּׁעָה וְאֵין קֵץ לִימֵי הָרָעָה</p>\n<p>דְּחֵה אַדְמוֹן בְּצֵל צַלְמוֹן הָקֵם לָנוּ רוֹעִים שִׁבְעָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This stanza alludes to the time of the writing to be circa the Crusades. חֲשׂוֹף זְרוֹעַ קָדְשֶׁךָ וְקָרֵב קֵץ הַיְשׁוּעָה alludes to Raavan's piyut \"Elokim Be'ozneinu Sham'anu\". נְקֹם נִקְמַת עֲבָדֶיךָ מֵאֻמָּה הָרְשָׁעָה alludes to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Av_HaRachamim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Av Harachamim</a>, which was composed around the time of the Crusades. כִּי אָרְכָה הַשָּׁעָה וְאֵין קֵץ לִימֵי הָרָעָה alludes also to Raavan's piyut.</p>\n<p>The key verse in this key stanza is the last one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דְּחֵה אַדְמוֹן בְּצֵל צַלְמוֹן הָקֵם לָנוּ רוֹעִים שִׁבְעָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this verse, he brings a few explanations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>אדמון - Admon - refers to Esav, who was born \"admoni\". Esav and Edom in the midrash are references to the Romans and when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity, Esav, Edom and Se'ir became references to Christianity. The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.15b.29?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot</a> explains that צלמון - Tzalmon - means \"tzalmavet\" (the shadow of death), so according to this understanding, the verse is prayer to Hashem asking that He smite the Christians and redeem Am Yisrael.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, this explanation does not explain what Maoz Tzur has to do with Chanukah. Dr. Baruchi explains that the answer to that is hidden in the last verse. He first brings an older suggestion:</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\"Admon\" refers to the German emperor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frederick I</a>, as his other name \"Barbarossa\" <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/barbarossa-the-red-bearded-hero-a-symbol-of-german-unity/a-15338091#:%7E:text=Barbarossa%20means%20%22red%20beard%22%20%2D,he%20was%20born%20in%201122.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">means</a> \"red-beard\". He was one of the leaders of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Crusade\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Third Crusade</a>. He travelled to the Holy Land through Anatolia and at one point conquered the city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Konya</a>, known at the time as \"Ikon\", and that is \"Tzalmon\" - \"icon\" = \"צלמית - tzelem\" in Hebrew. Per this understanding, the end of the line is a prayer for the success of the Crusaders' enemy at the time, Saladin and his men - we have no way of knowing whether this was the case (as sources are sketchy on this), but it's possible that he had six generals with him leading his army, which would make seven.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This suggestion, however, is not without problems:</p>\n<p>a. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iconium_(1190)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Battle of Iconium</a> was of little importance to the Jews at the time, and highly unlikely that the <em>Jews</em> at the time even heard about it.</p>\n<p>b. A short time after the Battle of Iconium, Emperor Barbarossa drowned in the Saleph river and died. If Admon is Barbarossa, we must assume that the author of Maoz Tzur heard of the Battle at Ikon but still hadn't heard of the death of the emperor, which is unlikely, seeing as his death was such a short time afterwards.</p>\n<p>c. At that time, there weren't pogroms in Germany. Moreover, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephraim_of_Bonn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Efraim of Bonn</a> who wrote about the Crusades, it was none other than Barbarossa himself who made sure that there wouldn't be pogroms in Germany.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Dr. Baruchi offers his own explanation:</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The historical background of the verse is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Clermont\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Council of Clermont</a>. The enthusiastic speeches at the time brought about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusade\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the First Crusade</a>, and on their way to the east, the Crusaders murdered thousands of Jews. What does this have to do with Chanukah? The Council of Clermont took place during Chanukah. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pope Urban II</a>'s infamous speech there was given on the 26th of Kislev, the second day of Chanukah. This may explain why Maoz Tzur was written specifically for Chanukah. Tzalmon likely hints towards Clermont (pronounced in French as Clarmohn): \"Cler\" means \"clear\" or \"lit with a bright light\" and the author of Maoz Tzur changed the \"light\" in the name to \"shadow\" (tzel), thus, from Clermon to Tzalmon. Similarly, in the piyut also written during the Crusades, \"Elokai Ekra'acha Be'machashev\" by Rabbi Shmuel ben Yehudah, it says: ועדו לקרן אפלה - this also refers to Clermont, as the \"mont\" means \"mountain\" and so does \"קרן - keren\", but instead of a mountain of light, it's a mountain of darkness. And also in Raavan's piyut there's a reference to Clermont: \"טוב קיוינו והנה אופל ואשמנים...יחדיו נועצו השונאים גוי עז פנים...\" - both \"ofel\" and \"ashmanim\" mean shadow, however, ashmanim is a very rare word which appears only once in Tanach. It seems that it was chosen because it includes the letters מנ which allude to \"mont\" from Clermont and the first shadow, the ofel, comes instead of the \"Cler\".\nTherefore, it seems that Admon is Pope Urban II, and he is described here as standing the shadow of the mountain of shadows. Furthermore, the word בצל, rearranged, is צלב, cross, so this may be another reference to the Crusades (מסעי הצלב in Hebrew).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If this is the correct understanding, then we can now find another hint to the Crusades in the first stanza:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְעֵת תָּכִין מַטְבֵּחַ מִצָּר הַמְנַבֵּחַ.</p>\n<p>אָז אֶגְמֹר בְּשִׁיר מִזְמוֹר חֲנֻכַּת הַמִּזְבֵּחַ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last line refers to the Ashkenazi customs of Chanukah - אז אגמור - saying Hallel, בשיר מזמור - saying Mizmor Shir Chanukat (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.30.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 30</a>) and חנכת המזבח - reading the portions of the Torah that deal with the sacrifices of the Nessi'im during Chanukat Hamishkan.</p>\n<p>The second-to-last line says \"מצר המנבח\" - the מנבח is a reference to Pope Urban II and the Christians, as durring the Middle Ages the root נבח was often used to refer to Christians (this same root appears in what Rabbi Efraim of Bonn wrote about Barbarossa).</p>\n<p>Per this understanding, Dr. Baruchi suggests correcting these last two lines to read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְעֵת <strong>הֵ</strong>כִין מַטְבֵּחַ <strong>צָּר</strong> הַמְנַבֵּחַ</p>\n<p>אָז אֶגְמֹר בְּשִׁיר מִזְמוֹר חֲנֻכַּת הַמִּזְבֵּחַ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning: At the time of the \"barking\" of the vile man (Pope Urban II), we celebrated and continue celebrating Chanukah, despite what he did.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The song seems to be written for Chanukah. It refers to Chanukas Hamizbeiach in the first line, and has a stanza about Chanukah. In between it also has stanzas about the Egyptian and Babylonian exiles, but those seem to be pointing to a historical pattern as context for the story of Chanukah.</p>\n<p>It is interesting that much later, the Maharal used his work on Chanukah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ner_Mitzvah?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ner Mitzvah</a>) to discuss all the exiles together.</p>\n\n\n",

Keeping Shabbat is not culturally driven (or to a much smaller extent).  Violating Shabbat is a capital offense, and dressing immodestly is not.

Pride for what?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban means that only Hashem is deserving of the title of \"Proud\" because He is the ultimate cause of everything in this world. For example, if a fireman saves someone from a burning building, the fireman would be wrong for feeling proud about his accomplishment because it is only Hashem who gave him the physical capabilities as well as intellectual capabilities to make the rescue. Hashem also created the scenario that allowed him to make the rescue and was overseeing the rescue and controlling it from beginning to end. This concept applies to everything in life - whether you passed your CPA test, finished a Mesechta, or drove from Brooklyn to Lakewood. For this reason someone who feels pride about an accomplishment is actually limiting in sone sense his recognition of Hashem being in full control of everything. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It appears that you may be misinterpreting the intent of the reference to \"<em>pride</em>\" as shown in the translation of the Igeres HaRamban.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16314#v=1&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim - Psalms - Chapter 93</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יְהֹוָה מָלָךְ גֵּאוּת לָבֵשׁ לָבֵשׁ יְהֹוָה עֹז הִתְאַזָּר אַף\n  תִּכּוֹן תֵּבֵל בַּל תִּמּוֹט</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Lord has reigned; He has attired Himself with majesty; yea the Lord has attired Himself, He has girded Himself with might. The world also is established that it cannot be moved.</p>\n\n<p>The word that you translate as <em>pride</em> is translated here as <em>majesty</em>. That is, since Hashem is the ruler, He is the one who \"<em>dons majesty</em>\". Thus one who attempts to exhibit <em>pride</em> or <em>majesty</em> is stating that he is the ruler and takes precedence. The analogy is to one who attempts to wear the robes (or crown) of the king. This could, in modern times, be like wearing judicial robes in a court room. Only the actual judge is allowed to wear judicial robes. It would be like the idiom of \"<em>donning judgement</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>I think that this is the way the Ramban is expressing the idea in the Igeret. The translator used \"pride\" in the way that I used Judgement above or Majesty in the Chabad translation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The sefer Hachinuch explains in numerous places that the attributes of G-d in the words of Tora are \"כלפי המקבלים\". This is a language which makes sense for the listener or the reader. גאות is eight, altitude, a gap between a man and G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly if we admire someone, we are impressed by the gap. If someone feels a gap between himself, he take for himself the feeling of gap he needs to feel for hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does a mute get married?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During a traditional wedding ceremony, the groom makes a formal declaration that he is making the bride his wife with a ring \"הרי את מקודשת לי...‏\" and then gives her the ring . Obviously if the groom is unable to speak, he cannot make this statement. What happens in such a case? Has this scenario ever been asked about (where a mute man wanted to marry) and what was the determined course of action?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<h3>In writing or in sign language.</h3>\n\n<p>You are talking about someone that can hear and understand. For the Din of Cheresh (which imply inability to be Chayav bemitsvot) is a man who cannot speaking nor hearing (mishna Terumot 1, 2).</p>\n\n<p>A mute is mentioned in mishna Teruma 1, 6, the mishna says that he is not allowed to levying the Teruma, but if he did this, the teruma is regular. What is the problem of the mute regarding teruma? First the Bartenura explains that the mute we're talking about is a man who has lost the ability to speak because of an illness (e.g. because of a CVA yerachem Hashem). The reason we don't allow him to levy teruma is his lack of capacity to say a Beracha. This generate also a inability to teach, so they are exempt from mitsvat Hakhel and Chagiga.</p>\n\n<p>A mute is regarded as able of all mitsvot which are not dependent from speaking. See this anecdote in Gemara Chagiga 3a.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But behold there were two dumb men in the neighbourhood of Rabbi, sons of the daughter of R'Johanan B'Gudgada, and according to others, sons of the sister of R'Johanan, who, whenever Rabbi entered the College, went in and sat down [before him], and nodded their heads and moved their lips. And Rabbi prayed for them and they were cured, and it was found that they were versed in Halachah, Sifra, Sifre and the whole Talmud! Said Mar Zutra, Read, That they may teach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How can he say his volunty from an halachic point of view, see Gittin 71a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R'Kahana said in the name of Rab: If a deaf-mute can signify his meaning by writing, a Get may be written and given to his wife. {Rashi explains that the case is as follow. A man had the faculty of speech and gave a good Kiddushin to the woman. Now he had lost the speech and want to make a Get. He can write on a scroll \"write and give Get to my wife, you, Ploni and Ploni.\" and he pass them the scroll. This is good enough.}  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Equally he can write to the woman \"הרי את מקודשת לי בטבעת זו כדת משה וישראל\", she and the witnesses are going to read the scroll and she is mekudeshet. If he makes this by sign language, we need to check before the kiddushin, by a triple check, that through his signs he speak as a reasonable person (Rambam Gerushin 2, 16).</p>\n\n<p>See SA EH 121, 6. </p>\n\n<p>For a man who has a status of Cheresh, the first mishna of the 13th chapter of Yebamot said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>as he marries [the woman] by gestures so he divorces her by gestures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This case is a case in which Kiddushin is not 100% (only miderababan see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7659\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 44, 1</a>), and Get is not 100%, but in the same way that we take into consideration the kiddushin that were made by a sign language, we take into consideration the Get which was ordinated by a sign language. (From this mishna we have no proof of a whole validity of kiddushin, because if he was healthy at the time of  kiddushin and give them normally, he cannot give a get when he has a status of cheresh).</p>\n\n<p>About the din of היה מדבר איתה על עסקי גיטה וקידושיה (a clear context of kiddushin) the same question is how a mute makes clear that he want to give Kiddushin. The same question (the OP) should be asked but at a different time (if he was already mute before the kiddushin). How made he this clear for the woman and the witnesses that he want to give Kiddushin?</p>\n\n<p>About Kiddushe Shtar. See the Bet Shmuel EH 136 sk 1, who said that Kiddushin by shtar is according to some more stringent than Get, because that \"אין ניכר אם דעתה ג\"כ לקידושין \" (we need to show that she takes the shtar with the intent to be mekudeshet)  when he says nothing. Thus the fact that something is clearly written in the shtar does not resolve our question with a mute man.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The implication of the Mishna (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Maaser_Sheni.4.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'aser Sheni 4:7</a>) is that a formal declaration is not necessary, and context suffices:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היה מדבר עם האשה על עסקי גיטה וקדושיה ונתן לה גיטה וקדושיה ולא פירש רבי יוסי אומר דיו. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the halakha as recorded by Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Marriage.3.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Ishut 3:8</a>) and the Shulhan Arukh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.27.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 27:1</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, a mute could get married without difficulty by simply clarifying through context that that is what he is doing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishnah (Kiddushin 2a) gives three ways to get married: money, document, or marital relations. So if he can't give the ring, he can always give the document. One merely has to write in the document הרי את מקודשת לי - it need not be said (ibid. 9a), unlike by the money (ibid. 6b).</p>\n\n\n",

Nothing has changed: she still has bad middos; I still don't like her.</p>\n\n<p>But everything has changed. Suddenly, by not liking her, I am committing at least two and possibly three major aveiros. I am ashamed that I find it incredibly hard to accept her as a fellow Jew, even though the Rabbinate has pronounced her such and she is therefore such by all accounts. </p>\n\n<p>1) How does one suddenly come to love (and not hate) someone one had not previously loved (and had hated) when there is a new obligation to do so?</p>\n\n<p>2) How can one quickly start seeing someone as a fellow Jew when one had not seen them as a Jew before? </p>\n\n<p>3) (Bonus, philosophical:) \"Ahavas habrios\" seems to be a bit disputed as an actual mitzva. But is it possible that ahavas habrios is necessary as a fence around ahavas yisroel (and loving the ger, etc.) because of the suddenness of conversions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You have asked some good general questions, here, SAH. But, within this, I have to ask - or rather, I think YOU have to ask yourself - if you may be judging her too harshly. Pirkei Avot states that one should not judge others until you have reached their position. I don't know if that adage applies to non-Jews, halachically. Even if not, I would venture that this is a common ethical behavior for humanity.</p>\n\n<p>I can't evaluate what factors went into your judgement of \"bad middos\" as a Gentile. Perhaps, you viewed her by your own \"higher\" ethical standards - meaning by your personal behavior. Did you expect her to live up to your standards, or common Jewish standards? Either way, she was a Gentile, so that may have been an unfair judgement.</p>\n\n<p>OK, now she converted. I don't know what her motives were, but, yes, she is expected to live up to a different standard than when she was Gentile. But even within Judaism, there is a huge gamut of what is considered \"good middos\". It may not be your personal standard, but it may be acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>Even if not, I think you need to keep that Pirkei Avot adage in mind, esp. now that she is a fellow Jew. Converts frequently undergo \"post Judaic\" stress. Suddenly they realize that being Jewish is far more challenging than they thought. Maybe your friend realizes that she made a mistake, but she can't reverse, now. This could be quite traumatic for her.</p>\n\n<p>I think a good (not necessarily the BEST) option is to be a true caring friend, if you want to deal with this person at all. Ask questions to discover her challenges and problems in the process of conversion as well as now. Get a sense of what her position is before you judge her. If you can be helpful, wonderful. If you can't, refer her to someone who can. You're not obligated to shoulder the burden of the solution on your own. But, I think the proper \"Jewish\" behavior is to at least offer a caring shoulder and not be quick to judge others.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>UPDATE: I tried and tried to love this convert. My biggest advances came from learning <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29326/source-for-the-baal-shem-tovs-idea-of-seeing-ones-own-flaw-in-others\">the Baal Shem Tov's teachings about the ayin tov</a>. As the BeShT taught, I looked hard for the same qualities in myself that I had reviled in her. Initially and for a long time, I did not find them, but I kept looking for them in myself. One day I did find them, in great measure and to shattering effect. Doing so was a very humbling experience that changed my entire Avodas H' as well as my self-perception. </p>\n\n<p>I also tried to think about how I could help this person; through this, we are taught, the mirror becomes a window. </p>\n\n<p>As soon as I started to think this way, something remarkable happened --although I had not yet succeeded in either helping this person or loving her personally. Her middos dramatically improved. She not only stopped treating me and others cruelly but actually began to treat us decently and even kindly. I see this as a small miracle and a small but infinitely large corroboration of the Baal Shem Tov's hasbore.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, he wrote (my own translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Our Rabbis, za'l, deduced from this that a person (adam) is obligated to visit his teacher on Shabbat and the festival, as it states (in this verse) 'it is neither Shabbat nor Chodesh', implying that on Shabbat and Rosh Chodesh she would (be obligated to) travel to him (Elisha).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reference to Chazal saying this is to Rosh Hashana 16b and Sukkah 27b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"ואמר רבי יצחק: חייב אדם להקביל פני רבו ברגל, שנאמר 'מדוע את הולכת אליו היום לא חודש ולא שבת' - מכלל דבחודש ושבת איבעי לה למיזל\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This does NOT say that <strong>women</strong> in general visited <strong>prophets</strong> in general, as a custom.</p>\n\n<p>The Shunamite woman had a special connection to Elisha, in that he was reckoned to be her teacher / Rebbe. Thus he would always stay in her (and her husband's) home when he visited the area. (See II Kings 4:8.)</p>\n\n<p>Based on Rabbi Yitzchak's statement, this would apply to any other person who had a similar connection to the prophet, as rebbe. But it is not cast as a custom for women, or for husbands accompanying their wives to visit the prophet.</p>\n\n<p>Further, this is casting a rabbinic practice back to Biblical times, akin to other midrashim claiming that the patriarchs kept the entire Torah. If we choose to take this non-homiletically,  then I do not think that we should recast it into some sort of proto-custom, involving women in general and prophets in general, and then seek to establish the contours of this reconstructed custom. There won't be any sources to establish those contours.</p>\n\n<p>As to the reason for the obligation of visiting one's rebbe, see here at <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/en/celebration-yom-tov-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Virtual Bet Midrash</a>, it is possibly an expression of kavod, honor. R. Yonasan Eybeschutz explained it as a replacement for visiting the Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rebuking someone for something that is not an aveira\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many sources suggest we rebuke so as not to bear a grudge (lo titor). But the Midrash and several meforshim (discussed <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/01/06/halachos-of-rebuke/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) suggest that the main purpose of rebuke is to keep one's fellow, and oneself by proxy--as one shares responsibility for the sin--from sinning. </p>\n\n<p>Which of these interpretations is correct as it concerns the question of whether we should rebuke someone for doing something that is offensive to us, but not necessarily a sin? For example, asking for very trivial favors or berating us for trivial oversights when we have just told them we are going through something terrible, ch\"v. In this case, or similar: </p>\n\n<p>1) May we rebuke them? (There is always some risk of embarrassing the addressee, which I see as a potentially competing halacha in such cases)</p>\n\n<p>2) Must we rebuke them?</p>\n\n<p>3) What is the best way to rebuke them? </p>\n\n<p>Assume we are at risk of bearing a grudge if we do not rebuke. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam in Hilchos Deos Perek 6, Halacha 6 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>6 When one person wrongs another, the latter should not remain silent\n  and despise him as [II Samuel 13:22] states concerning the wicked:\n  \"And Avshalom did not speak to Amnon neither good, nor bad for\n  Avshalom hated Amnon.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Rather, he is commanded to make the matter known and ask him: \"Why did\n  you do this to me?\", \"Why did you wrong me regarding that matter?\" as\n  [Leviticus 19:17] states: \"You shall surely admonish your colleague.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>If, afterwards, [the person who committed the wrong] asks [his\n  colleague] to forgive him, he must do so. A person should not be cruel\n  when forgiving [as implied by Genesis 20:17]: \"And Abraham prayed to\n  God...\"</p>\n  \n  <p>ו כשיחטא איש לאיש לא ישטמנו וישתוק כמו שנאמר ברשעים ולא דבר אבשלום את\n  אמנון מאומה למרע ועד טוב כי שנא אבשלום את אמנון אלא מצוה עליו להודיעו\n  ולומר לו למה עשית לי כך וכך ולמה חטאת לי בדבר פלוני שנאמר הוכח תוכיח\n  את עמיתך ואם חזר ובקש ממנו למחול לו צריך למחול ולא יהא המוחל אכזרי\n  שנאמר ויתפלל אברהם אל האלהים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on this Rambam one should rebuke his/her friend that has done something to him/her that bothers them. The person should not keep it in, but rather share it with the other person.  </p>\n\n<p>With regard to your question of how to rebuke them, the Rambam continues and says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>7 It is a mitzvah for a person who sees that his fellow Jew has sinned\n  or is following an improper path [to attempt] to correct his behavior\n  and to inform him that he is causing himself a loss by his evil deeds\n  as [Leviticus 19:17] states: \"You shall surely admonish your\n  colleague.\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>A person who rebukes a colleague - whether because of a [wrong committed] against him or because of a matter between his colleague\n  and God - should rebuke him privately. He should speak to him\n  patiently and gently, informing him that he is only making these\n  statements for his colleague's own welfare, to allow him to merit the\n  life of the world to come.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>If he accepts [the rebuke], it is good; if not, he should rebuke him a\n  second and third time. Indeed, one is obligated to rebuke a colleague\n  who does wrong until the latter strikes him and tells him: \"I will not\n  listen.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Whoever has the possibility of rebuking [sinners] and fails to do so\n  is considered responsible for that sin, for he had the opportunity to\n  rebuke the [sinners].</p>\n  \n  <p>ז הרואה חבירו שחטא או שהלך בדרך לא טובה מצוה להחזירו למוטב ולהודיעו\n  שהוא חוטא על עצמו במעשיו הרעים שנאמר הוכח תוכיח את עמיתך המוכיח את\n  חבירו בין בדברים שבינו לבינו בין בדברים שבינו לבין המקום <strong>צריך\n  להוכיחו בינו לבין עצמו וידבר לו בנחת ובלשון רכה ויודיעו שאינו אומר לו\n  אלא לטובתו להביאו לחיי העולם הבא</strong> אם קיבל ממנו מוטב ואם לאו יוכיחנו\n  פעם שניה ושלישית וכן תמיד חייב אדם להוכיחו עד שיכהו החוטא ויאמר לו\n  איני שומע וכל שאפשר בידו למחות ואינו מוחה הוא נתפש בעון אלו כיון שאפשר\n  לו למחות בהם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, the one giving rebuke is trying to convey that they are doing it for the benefit of the other person.  People are perceptive and will pick up if you are doing it sincerely for their benefit or not.<br>\nOnes very tone and word choice should convey this attitude.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this answers some of what you are asking.</p>\n\n\n",

Any attempt at rebuking prior to reinstating peace in between yourselves shall be untruthful as your intentions are automatically to let out your anger.

This was to show them that he was the number two in Egypt, only a little below the \"god-king\" (Par'o). He could imprison all of them at a whim.

    "content": "# Looking for a text by Yosef Perl (a parodist of Rebbe Nachman)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yosef Perl was a satirist, and is often described as a maskil. A vigorous opponent of hasidim in particular, he was active in the middle of the 19th century when the stories of Rebbe Nachman and <em>Shivchei haBesht</em> were first published. His most famous work is <em>Megaleh Temirin</em> (1819), which he published under a pseudonym.</p>\n\n<p>His first satirical work was not published during his lifetime, and I've been unable to even find what it was called. It was a parody of Rebbe Nachman's stories, written in the same style (in a combination of Hebrew and Yiddish), providing a comic conclusion to one story that ended suddenly in the original, and inventing another story from whole cloth. Perl's style in all of his writings was to ridicule hasidim by way of imitation, and I would very much like to see an example of this.</p>\n\n<p>If anybody here is familiar with maskilic literature and could recommend to me where I might find more information about Yosef Perl, that would be great. Ideally, I would love to see a copy of this particular text (his parody of Rebbe Nachman's stories). I understand that it's almost certainly not for sale, but if there is a published version in a library somewhere, I should be able to get it through an interlibrary loan. (And, if not, maybe one day take a vacation...)</p>\n\n<p>From what I understand, Perl had a negligible impact upon the subsequent history of maskilic literature. He was a frum Jew, and is probably better classed together with misnagdim than maskilim, but for the fact that he also published in German and availed himself of the writings of other wordly, cosmopolitan Jews (like Menachem Mendel Lefin, for example).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The text that you are looking for is <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/maasiyot-ve-igrot-mi-tsadikim-amitiyim-ume-anshe-shelomenu/oclc/19147235\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">referred to</a> by @Loewian in the comments. However, it should be noted that some strongly doubt the ascription of this book to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Perl\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joseph Perl</a>; most notably was the bibliographer A.M. Habermann (Kvuzei Yachad 143ff.). One of the main reasons for the skeptics' doubt is because Perl was <em>anti-Yiddish</em>, while this book incorporates Yiddish into its text (as noted by OP). However it may be argued that Perl may have made an exception as alluded to at the end of his intro. to his Megaleh Temirin <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=czo_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PT7#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Another book that was posthumously printed and ascribed to Perl is the collection of <a href=\"http://www.rachelnet.net/media/medem/livres/000054170.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yiddish letters</a>.

So, if Reuven, in fact IS confessing his guilt with his brothers, then, in the next verse, when he chastises them, what purpose does that accomplish? His suggesting that they place Joseph in a pit might have also caused his death.</p>\n\n<p>Another angle - If Re'uven knew, in advance, that he had to leave his brothers, why did he trust them that they would leave Joseph alone in the pit while he was gone? Even discounting the factor, we see that despite his intentions to retrieve Joseph from the pit, he doesn't do this, immediately, but he disappears from the scene. </p>\n\n<p>Something to note in verse 21 - the brothers say, \"Therefore all this trouble has come upon <strong>us</strong>.\" Even if Re'uevn is not part of that actual confession, the \"trouble\" the brothers are referring to is the claim of being spies, which includes Re'uven as well. So, they would be including Re'uven in the consequences, anyway.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The simplest answer is that your translation is not accurate. The verse actually states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמְר֞וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־אָחִ֗יו אֲבָל֘ אֲשֵׁמִ֣ים׀ אֲנַחְנוּ֘ עַל־אָחִינוּ֒ </p>\n  \n  <p>And they said to each other: we are guilty for [what we did to] our brother.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no indication that Reuven (or any other given brother) admitted guilt. The simple reading of verse 22, indicates that Reuven said \"to them\", as opposed to himself who was not included in the confession of verse 21.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the Meshivat Nefesh to verse 21 suggests that they didn't initially think that they were being punished for Yosef, since they were all in the same boat, but Reven was innocent! </p>\n\n<p>However, Ohr Hahayyim to verse 21 suggests that Reuven was aware that Yosef was thrown into the pit, and therefore shared a degree of culpability for not saving Yosef when he cried for help. (Ohr HaHayyim references the snakes and scorpions in the pit, indicating that he believes in that Midrashm, although he also references fear of dehydration as a reason why Yosef would have cried for help.)</p>\n\n<p>Also regarding the Midrash about the snakes, Ramban (Genesis 37:22) notes it isn't peshat. Hizkuni (there) suggests that even according to the Midrash about the snakes, Reuven wasn't culpable, since Reuven wouldn't have put him into an infested pit. Rather, Reuven had him thrown into a non-infested pit, and after Reuven left, they switched him into a different, infested, pit. Rabbenu Hayyim Paltiel (there) suggests a variation of this explanation. He suggests that Reuven suggested that they throw him into one (not infested pit), and instead they threw him into a different pit (that was infested). This is suggested by Riva al HaTorah as well. Alternatively, if one accepts this Midrash, one could suggest that Reuve didn't know about the snakes (Ramban, Riva's second explanation). Alternatively, Riva suggests that Reuven assumed that Yosef would simply use sorcery to protect himself from the snakes.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, regarding the question of Reuven's culpability for leaving Yosef in the pit, the Midrash Tanhuma (ed. Buber Parashat Vayeshev 13) suggests that had Reuven known that he would be mentioned in the Torah as trying to save Yosef, the wouldn't have left him there, but would have just taken him home. This indicates that Reuven didn't do his best, since if he was already doing his best, why would he act differently if he knew it would be mentioned in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Other Midrashim, however, portray Reuven's leaving in a positive light, such as suggesting he was doing t'shuva (B'reshit Rabba: Parashat Vayeshev 84), or going take care of Yaakov, or that he was hiding out for the purpose of coming back to save Yosef (Pirkei D'rAbbi Eliezer (ed. Higger 37),  Midrash HaBeiur to Genesis 37:29).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As you point out in the question, it's unclear whether Reuven is included in וַיֹּאמְרוּ אִישׁ אֶל-אָחִיו, and they said one to another. Reuven's response might mean either (a) he didn't speak before and now he's telling them why they were wrong (\"I told you so\"), or (b) he was part of the group and now he's defending himself (\"I'm less guilty than you\").</p>\n\n<p>I saw a <em>d'var</em> torah about Reuven and this incident last week, but unfortunately I no longer remember to whom to give credit.  It pointed out Reuven's failure to <em>actually</em> protect Yosef; he was able to prevent the others from killing him, which is good, but he wasn't able to prevent the sale.  (He didn't know in advance about the sale, but by leaving he wasn't able to prevent it.)  Had he been a stronger leader (the <em>d'var</em> author suggested), he would have spoken up to his brothers instead of compromising on the pit.</p>\n\n<p>If he is part of the group saying \"we are guilty\", perhaps it is this failing that he is acknowledging.  \"We are guilty\" doesn't need to mean that each is guilty of the same thing, just that each bears guilt for Yosef being sold -- most through direct action and one through inaction.</p>\n\n\n",

[By this,] our Rabbis taught us that we should not say that darkness is only the absence of light, like when - in the middle of the day - we close the windows, it becomes dark. For, if so, it would not be a creation. <strong>But in truth, darkness is a creation, on its own as well, as it is written (Isaiah 45:7), \"and created the darkness.\"</strong> And <strong>it is great distortion to say that darkness is only the absence of light. But rather, God makes both of them,</strong> just as He concerns Himself over holiness and impurity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explanation states that darkness is a creation on it's own rather than just the absence of light, and it even quotes Isaiah as direct evidence. However, the creation of light is explicitly narrated in Bereshit <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.3/en/The_Holy_Scriptures:_A_New_Translation_(JPS_1917)?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:3</a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר וַֽיְהִי־אֽוֹר</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and it's separation from darkness is recounted in Bereshit <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.4/en/The_Holy_Scriptures:_A_New_Translation_(JPS_1917)?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:4</a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶת־הָא֖וֹר כִּי־ט֑וֹב <strong>וַיַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים\n  בֵּ֥ין הָא֖וֹר וּבֵ֥ין הַחֹֽשֶׁךְ</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But darkness (as well as <em>the deep</em>/תְה֑וֹם) is named on Bereshit <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.2/en/The_Holy_Scriptures:_A_New_Translation_(JPS_1917)?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:2</a> without a narration of its creation earlier:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָאָ֗רֶץ הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ <strong>וְחֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם</strong> וְר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הַמָּֽיִם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand that the account of Creation of Bereshit contains really deep meanings and may not be as literal as I may be taking it according to the sages' interpretations. However, I believe it is a valid question to ask: <strong>When did G-d create darkness?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><em>I suspect darkness (and the deep) may've been in some way part of the creation of the heavens and the earth in Bereshit <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1/en/The_Holy_Scriptures:_A_New_Translation_(JPS_1917)?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:1</a>, but this is just a thought.</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The answers I've received are wonderful and really well researched, however I will not be choosing one as the correct answer for the following reason: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/78616/11052\">Menachem's</a> answer explains the perspective of the Ohr HaChaim and the Talmud, which states that darkness was created in the first day, with a solid reasoning. While <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/78584/11052\">Mevaqesh's</a> answer argues that darkness is in fact just the absence of light (and not a creation), and he justifies this point by quoting many different rabbinical authorities from different backgrounds and centuries who all agree with this interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>I don't feel I'm entitled to choose which answer is the most correct based on my subjective opinion and I encourage the readers to check both of this great answers to get an understanding of both conflicting yet fascinating interpretations.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The Ohr hachaim on the beginning of bereshit quotes the Talmud <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=13&daf=12&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chagigah 12a</a>. There it lists 10 things were created in the first day, and one of them is Choshech.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמר רב יהודה אמר רב <strong>עשרה דברים נבראו ביום ראשון</strong> ואלו הן שמים וארץ תהו ובהו אור ו<strong>חשך</strong> רוח ומים מדת יום ומדת לילה שמים וארץ דכתיב בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ תהו ובהו דכתיב והארץ היתה תהו ובהו אור וחשך חשך דכתיב וחשך על פני תהום אור דכתיב ויאמר אלהים יהי אור רוח ומים דכתיב ורוח אלהים מרחפת על פני המים מדת יום ומדת לילה דכתיב ויהי ערב ויהי בקר יום אחד</p>\n<p>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, \"Ten things were created on the first day...darkness...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The premise of the Talmud is that if they are mentioned in the creation process of the first day this implies that they were created then, because if not, how could they exist.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#showrashi=true&v=2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishit 1:2</a> (which talks about the first day of creation) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָאָרֶץ הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ <strong>וְחשֶׁךְ עַל פְּנֵי תְהוֹם</strong> וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם:</p>\n<p>Now the earth was astonishingly empty, <strong>and darkness was on the face of the deep</strong>, and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since there was nothing before the begining of creation, where did darkness come from. This proves that darkness was also created on the first day.

And some say that the term is appropriate since through the rotation of the heavens downwards, the darkness comes to Earth. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Orchot Chaim's words are repeated in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kol_Bo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kol Bo</a> (8). </p>\n\n<p>This is also stated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissim_of_Gerona\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ran</a> in his derashot (3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל החשך שהוא העדר האור אינו נתלה בפועל רק בהעדר סיבת האור </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also stated by the interestingly titled <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethanel_ben_Isaiah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'or Ha'afelah</a> (14th century Yemen) who writes (as per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Therefore, darkness was not created, but is the absence of light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also implicit in the commentary of the uncle and mentor of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Ephraim_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Karo</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Toledot Yitschak</em></a> to Genesis (1:5) who asks how the verse can state that there was evening and then day if the very definition of night is the darkness of absence of light. Before light even existed, how can one meaningfully speak of darkness:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויהי ערב ויהי בקר יום אחד, ערב הוא העדר האור, והוא החשך והנה לא קדם אור, ואיך אמר ויהי ערב בלא שקדם אור</p>\n  \n  <p>And there was evening and there was morning, one day: 'evening' is the lack of light, and this is the 'darkness', and note that the light didn't precede it, so how can it state \"there was evening\", without light having preceded it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> writes this as well in explaining the verse in Isaiah (45:7) that speaks of God fashioning light and creating darkness:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ימצא החשך שהוא העדר האור מקום, עת ישנה האור מצבו ע\"י התנועה שהוא מקרה קרה אל עצמו ומצד זה יאמר ג\"כ שה' ברא את החשך, הגם שההעדר לא נברא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, many many traditional rabbinic authorities from a broad range of backgrounds, living over more than a millennium, agree that darkness is just the absence of light. God's creation of darkness refers to the newly significant lack of light, or in some contexts can refer to the created cycle which triggers both the light of day and the darkness of night.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the plain meaning of the words from Bereshit 1:1-2, it states what the order of creation was.</p>\n\n<p>בראשית ברא אלקים את השמים ואת הארץ. והארץ היתה תהו ובהו וחשך על-פני תהום כו׳</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning, G-d created <em>the Heavens</em> and <em>the Earth</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Or as Rashi points out from Midrash, בראשית means, <em>For the sake of Israel and the Torah</em>, G-d created the Heavens and the Earth.</p>\n\n<p>There were two distinct categories or aspects to the process of creation. The first is the upper category of <em>the Heavens</em> and the second is the lower category of <em>the Earth</em>. The creation proceeds from <em>Above</em> to <em>Below</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And the Earth was <strong><em>Tohu</em></strong> and <strong><em>Vohu</em></strong> and <strong><em>Darkness</em></strong> over the face of <strong><em>Tehom</em></strong>, etc.</p>\n\n<p>And that lower category, which is called <em>the Earth</em>, is comprised of four sub-categories which are called <em>Tohu</em> and <em>Vohu</em> and <em>Darkness</em> over the face of the <em>Tehom</em>. All these details are discussed at length in the commentaries of Ramban, Rabbeinu Bechai and the Abarbanel to Bereshit 1:1-2.</p>\n\n<p>This is defining the four categories or types of <em>Kelippot of Tumah</em> (<em>Shells</em> or <em>Degrees</em> of <em>Unfitness</em>). The three more severe categories are called Tohu, Vohu and Darkness. They are completely unclean and prohibited. They are the most external and pertain to those things which are absolutely prohibited and cannot be refined via the mitzvot, like orlah for example as is explained in detail in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7885/jewish/Chapter-6.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likuttei Amarim, Tanya, 1:6</a>. Like is explained there, this is also based upon the same idea with the nomenclature of the Prophets as found in Yechezkel 1:4.</p>\n\n<p>The fourth category is called Kelipat Nogah which is a mixture of Tov and Ra. It is the innermost aspect of the four sub-categories and is thus referred to with the expression, \"על-פני תהום\". The three more severe kelippot cover over the <em>inner</em>, refinable aspect of Nogah, like a shell or skin like is found in Likkutei Amarim, Tanya 1:7.</p>\n\n<p>This concept of Tehom being related to the aspect of Kelipat Nogah is also brought up in <a href=\"http://www.kab.co.il/heb/content/view/frame/29640?/heb/content/view/full/29640\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Kol HaTor, Chapter 5, Part 2, Paragraph 2</a> citing the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14253&st=&pgnum=650\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, parshat Vayeira, 117a</a>, which is based upon the Chumash, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.7.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parshat Noach 7:11</a> which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בִּשְׁנַ֨ת שֵׁשׁ־מֵא֤וֹת שָׁנָה֙ לְחַיֵּי־נֹ֔חַ בַּחֹ֙דֶשׁ֙ הַשֵּׁנִ֔י בְּשִׁבְעָֽה־עָשָׂ֥ר י֖וֹם לַחֹ֑דֶשׁ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֗ה נִבְקְעוּ֙ כָּֽל־מַעְיְנֹת֙ <strong>תְּה֣וֹם</strong> רַבָּ֔ה וַאֲרֻבֹּ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם נִפְתָּֽחוּ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is Kelipat Nogah which the Jewish people work with when performing mitzvot, meaning those aspects of creation which are permitted to us.</p>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question in brief, <em>the Darkness</em> is included in the general creation of that lower category called <em>the Earth</em> which is prior even to the first utterance for light.</p>\n\n\n",

Later it was decreed that in order to preserve knowledge of tradition (eis la'asos hashem, heferu torasecha) they permitted the codification of the mishnah and later the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>There are opinions who consider the buying of a sefer (and certainly publishing your own) to be a fulfillment of the mitzvah of ketivat sefer torah. (Shulchan Aruch YD 270:2)</p>\n\n<p>Do we consider Divrei Torah explaining the pshat of a possuk (like Rashi) to fall under the latter category, by which one is impelled to teach torah (udelo yalif katala chayiv), but not necessarily to write it? </p>\n\n<p>Or, since it is torah solely derived from Torah shebichtav, does it have the status of Torah shebichtav (and may fulfill the requirement to make a Torah shebichtav) and, consequently, one would potentially be <strong><em>required</em></strong> to commit it to writing?</p>\n\n\n",

On Shabbat Chanukah one year, the gabbai placed one Torah in the ark before minyan began, and it seems that with a mainly \"secular\" congregation (I.e., the 15 people that formed the minyan), no one else realized that on Shabbat Chanukah you need 2 Sifrei Torah.</p>\n\n<p>They read the weekly portion (Miketz), say Kaddish, and just before hagbah, the gabbai realizes that they should have had two Sifrei Torah! But the other Torah is in another room in another wing of the shul. It would actually be quicker to just roll the current Torah from Miketz to the Chanukah portion than get another Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Should they roll this Torah, as it is less of a <em>tircha detzibbur</em>, or do they still need to get the 2nd Torah from the other room?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> - The story is an example.

The point of the wells is to teach us a fundamental lesson about doing <em>kiruv</em>; bringing Godliness to the world.</p>\n<p>One way to do it, is to import water from where it is, to a place that is dry. This was Avraham's \"Chesed\" approach to teaching the world about Hashem. He would \"draw water from heaven\" and teach people about the One God.</p>\n<p>The issue is, such water is very easily stopped up. He would explain convincingly that there is only One God, and the Plishtim would be able to just as easily convince people that nah, there are many gods.</p>\n<p>So, Yitzchak built wells in a different way. He would draw water from the place that is dry, itself. If you dig deep enough, you will find real inspiration within. He would have a personal touch when teaching people about God, explaining things to them in the way that worked for them - and finding <em>their own</em> inspiration.</p>\n<p>This is a very important lesson, absolutely timeless. Inspiration is <strong>not</strong> contagious! One cannot inspire others with one's own inspiration. One must encourage people to find their own inspiration, because that's the only thing that's going to work.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>See Likkutei Sichot Vol. 25 p. 123FF, adapted from Sichot delivered on Leil Beis D'Chag HaSukkos, 5743, 5745, and Shabbos Parshas Toldos 5745</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban discusses that each one of the wells is compared to the Beis HaMikdash and each one being built and fighting over it and its name is connected to each Beis HaMikdash.</p>\n<p>The Ramban understands this as a Remez. On P'shat we see how Yitzchak behaves in confrontation, but on a deeper level Ma'aseh Avos Siman Le'Banim (what happens to the parents occurs to the children) and this is a major reverberation to our people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Guggenheimer in \"<a href=\"https://www.urimpublications.com/reading-the-torah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reading the Torah</a>\", parsha Toledot on Bereshis 26 suggests a very simple explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Avimelekh to whom Yitzchak goes in the famine, in contrast to Avraham's king of Gerar, is not Canaanite but Philistine (\"invader\") even though he and his army chief retained the Canaanite titles from people which they displaced. This means that one has to fix time of Isaac shortly after the big earthquake which destroyed Knossos, the capital of Crete, and forced the Sea People to invade the Eastern shore of Mediterranean. The example here shows that the invaders at first took over the names and institutions of the people which they displaced. By the time of Yehoshua they had no kings any more but rulers סרנים, Greek τυραννοι - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrant\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tyrants</a>. <em>The Avimelekh here could not possibly have learned from experiences of Avimelekh of Avraham's time, and as a Greek style king could not take citizen's property (including wives) at will</em>.</p>\n<p>Bereshis 26:15. Yitzchak returns to Beer Sheva. The Philistines had destroyed all the cisterns in the foothills. Which person in his senses would destroy water sources in an arid area? It seems the Philistines deliberately created an empty space between themselves and the Canaanites, as a defensive glacis. They did not give up claim to the surrounding land and therefore laid claim to the water. The permanent trouble with the Philistines started only with Yehoshua attaking through the defense area (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.10.41?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 10:41</a>).</p>\n<p>Bereshis 26:26-31. Yitzchak in Beer Sheva receives Avimelekh and his army chief as a friendly sovereign. He swears not to have hostile relations with the Philistines but does not pay tribute to this Avimelekh either for land or for water. The political situation is totally different from that of Abraham's time. (By the way - this is the second naming of the place Beer Sheva, why the need?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Guggenheimer follows the opinion of Ramban on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.10.13?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 10:13</a>. Ramban himself on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.23?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 2:23</a> proves that the Avvim were the Canaani nation of Chivi.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>However, his words go against Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.60b.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 60b</a> (thank you @Yø-c Ro for helpful discussion):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The verse states: “The five lords of the Philistines: The Gazite, and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite; also the Avvim” (Joshua 13:3). The verse is difficult, since it first said there are five lords of the Philistines, but it then lists six. Rabbi Yonatan said: There were in fact six lords, but the greatest of them were only five. Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Taḥlifa bar Avina: Write this statement about the greatest [arunekei] in your book of aggada, and explain that word. The Gemara notes: And this statement disagrees with the opinion of Rav, as Rav says: The Avvim were not Philistines; rather, they came from Teiman.</p>\n<p>This is also taught in a baraita: The Avvim came from Teiman. And why were they called Avvim and not Teimanim? Because they corrupted [ivvetu] and destroyed their place of origin when they left. Alternatively, they were called Avvim since they desired [ivvu] many deities. Alternatively, they were called Avvim since they were so fearsome that all who saw them were seized by convulsions [avit]. Rav Yosef said: And each one of them has sixteen rows of teeth.</p>\n<p>The Gemara cites another statement related to the Avvim: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: There are many verses that are seemingly fit to be burned as books of the heretics, since they appear redundant or frivolous, and yet they are themselves the essence of Torah. For example, the verse states: “And the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead” (Deuteronomy 2:23). What practical difference does this make for us?</p>\n<p>The verse teaches the following: Since Abimelech, king of the Philistines, administered an oath to Abraham: “That you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson” (Genesis 21:23), the Jewish people were prohibited from conquering the land of the Philistines until four generations had passed. Therefore, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let the Caphtorim come and remove the land from the Avvim, who are the same as the Philistines, and let Israel come and remove it from the Caphtorim, circumventing the prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we follow the gemara then we must conclude that the Philistines were descendands of the original warriors who originated in Mitzrayim as the Torah says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.10.13-14?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 10:13-14</a>, who were later overtaken by the Avvim and then by the Caphtorim at the time of Moshe.</p>\n<p>According to both opinions of Gemara and the Ramban, we can follow the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Onkelos_Genesis.26.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Onkelos on Bereshis 26:28</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.26.28?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi there</a>, who both state that the covenant between Yitzchak and Avimelech of parshas Toldos was just an extension of the covenant of their fathers, between Avraham and Avimelekh described in parashas Vayeira. Thus one  can conclude that at the time of Yitzchak either the Egyptian Philistines or the Caphtorim separated from Canaanim with the defensive glacis as R'Guggenheimer explains to prevent invasions at the time of drought!</p>\n<p>Additional details on the Philistines can be found <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/149981/36610\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on this clarification, one can answer the questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The wells were important for people to survive during the famine.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Torah shows that Yitzchak did not give up and gave his best effort to survive in Eretz Yisrael without descending to Mitzraim, like Avraham did.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Philistines stopped up the wells in the periphery of their territory as it became the defensive zone to separate themselves from Canaanites.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Philistines contested that Yitzchak was using their water.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the arid area it is really difficult to find new wells of water, especially if it is a desert. Yitzchak tried to rely on Avraham's findings, whose servant Eliezer was <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/145773/the-meaning-of-dammesek-eliezer\">master of finding where to dig for water</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Yitzchak gave the wells the same names as his father did out of respect and grattitude for his father, whose efforts helped him and his household survive. In an arid area, each well could give rise to a settlement, and that's why it was getting a name.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

When Sisera finally fell asleep, Yael took a tent peg and drove it into his skull, killing him. The reason she was not punished is because it was an aveirah lishmah - she had good intentions, namely, saving Klal Yisrael, when she did so. Nevertheless, the Gemara discusses whether she received any benefit from her act - in the event that she did she would have been punished. </p>\n\n<p>The aforementioned Gemara also notes Lot's daughters (Bereishis 19), who had relations with their father on successive nights, believing themselves to be the only remaining people alive after the destruction of Sedom.

We know the sacrifices at the temple were not acceptable until after they properly dedicated the altar, but why does it take 7 days?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ezekiel 43: [26]Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and\n  cleanse it; so shall they consecrate it.[27]And when they have\n  accomplished the days, it shall be that upon the eighth day, and\n  forward, the priests shall make your burnt-offerings upon the altar,\n  and your peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br>What writings explain this? Or is this simply a commandment/requirement and the way YHVH wants to be worshipped?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exodus 29: 37 Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and\n  sanctify it; thus shall the altar be most holy; whatsoever toucheth\n  the altar shall be holy. ...44 And I will sanctify the tent of\n  meeting, and the altar; Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to\n  minister to Me in the priest’s office. 45 And I will dwell among the\n  children of Israel, and will be their God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is in the 7 day length that is so special? In vs 44 above, YHVH says that HE will sanctify and will dwell among our people and be our elohim. So he will do the sanctifying of the tent of meeting, the altar, and Aaron and his sons but sequentially after this period of atonement for the altar.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this uncleanness period of 7 days applied to a person and then on the 8th day they're able to establish the sign of the covenant? <em>(Not counting researched medical reasons of vit.K production and all that.)</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Leviticus 12: 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If a woman\n  be delivered, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven\n  days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be\n  unclean. 3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be\n  circumcised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there a meaning to this pattern? What is it? Obviously 7s are a big deal. Several patterns of atonement for 7 days and acceptance on the 8th are here in Torah and Nevi'im. I guess the root of my asking this is application to my own life and obedience to Torah and noting what it means to have something anointed/dedicated/consecrated and if there's a relationship with a 7 day period of cleansing/purging things in my own life, physically or spiritually. So in general, is there a deeper meaning of what's going on during the 7 days that I'm missing in the scriptures or is it simply a commandment for the priesthood to follow specifically regarding how/when to sacrifice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out (especially with Bris Milah - circumcision) that seven is symbolic of the completion of the natural world, while eight is the moving above the natural world into the world of spirituality. Thus, six involves the complete physical world (such as right, left, forward, back up, down) while seven is Shabat - the completion of the physical universe (as with shabat completing creation).</p>\n\n<p>Eight now takes the universe into the area of spirituality and taharah (translated as purity) which brings matters to the next level.

There may be a line of reasoning to permit such a thing. We find in the laws of Purim (Shulchan Aruch, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.696.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim, 696:8</a>) that the Rema writes that some people have a custom for men to dress as women on Purim. Even though this is normally forbidden (as is mentioned explicitly in the Torah), because it is done in the spirit of levity of the holiday, some opinions believe it to be permitted. Perhaps one could say that this applies to the Santa costume – because it is worn in the spirit of Purim fun, and nobody seriously thinks that the person has any real connection or feelings for Santa (or the Christian festival associated with Santa), it could be permitted.</p>\n<p>Even though this line of thought might be enough to refrain from rebuking another person who did in fact wear such a costume, <strong>one should certainly not rely on this to themselves dress in such a way (or dress their children up as Santa)</strong>. The Rema quotes Rabbis who forbid forbidden dressup on Purim, and the Mishna Brurah (ibid) quotes major sources who are explicit in their disapproval of such actions. That would rule out using such logic in our case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Read full article <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=8308\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Arizal is post-shvirah tikkun.</p>\n<p>What that means is this: The key difference between the Kabbalah of the Ramak and HaAri is how they describe the structure of creation and divine flow.</p>\n<p>Pardes Rimonim explains the sefiros as a harmonious, interconnected system, where divine energy moves in an orderly way through structured vessels (Pardes Rimonim 2:1). This reflects a view of the world before the Sheviras HaKeilim, meaning creation was originally whole and functioned in perfect unity.</p>\n<p>HaAri in Eitz Chaim describes a different picture. The flow is not linear, but move through different avenues.  After tzimtzum, the Ohr Ein Sof emanated into the sefiros, but the lower vessels were too weak to contain the divine energy and shattered as is known (Eitz Chaim 2:4). The world we live in is after this catastrophe, meaning reality is broken, and our purpose is Tikkun—to gather the sparks of holiness and repair creation through mitzvos, Torah, and yichudim. Because otherwise, as per the Ari's approach, divinity is completely hidden from us.  For the Ramak, everything prior to the shvirah was completely revealed.</p>\n<p>In Chassidus, this contrast is often framed as Ohr Yashar (direct light) vs. Ohr Chozer (returning light). The Ramak’s system corresponds to Ohr yashar, where divine energy flows in a structured, logical way, while the Arizal’s approach focuses on Ohr Chozer—how brokenness itself creates a deeper light through Tikkun. Tanya explains that our work in refining the physical world releases a higher divine energy than what existed originally, echoing the Arizal’s idea that Tikkun elevates creation beyond its initial state. The plethora of seforim that make up Toras HaBaal Shem Tov reinforce the idea that the world is not in its original harmonious state (Ramak’s view), but rather a fractured reality requiring human effort (Arizal’s view).</p>\n<p><strong>A Few Sources that Reflect on the Ramak’s View of Structured Divine Order</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tanya – Shaar HaYichud VehaEmunah:</strong> Before the Shevirah, the world existed in a clear, structured unity (or yashar), but our perception of separateness is an illusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Ohr HaMeir (Rav Zev Wolf of Zhitomir) – Parshas Bereishis:</strong> The sefiros are interconnected and function in harmony, reflecting divine order.</p>\n<p><strong>Torah Ohr (Ba’al HaTanya) – Parshas Vayeishev:</strong> While the Shevirah caused fragmentation, the underlying divine structure still guides existence.</p>\n<p><strong>A few sources that Follow the Arizal’s View of Shevirah & Tikkun:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Noam Elimelech – Parshas Vayeishev:</strong> The tzaddik rectifies the shattered world by revealing divine light through suffering and avodah.</p>\n<p><strong>Maor Einayim – Parshas Bereishis:</strong> The purpose of creation is to uplift sparks hidden in the material world, fulfilling Tikun Olam.</p>\n<p><strong>Toldos Yaakov Yosef – Parshas Shemos:</strong> The Baal Shem Tov emphasized avodah b’gashmiyus—engaging with the physical world to extract sparks of holiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Kedushas Levi – Parshas Bereishis:</strong> Descent is necessary for ascent; Tikun comes through struggle and teshuvah, bringing one to a higher level than before.</p>\n<p><strong>Sfas Emes – Parshas Beshalach (5642):</strong> The world’s broken state hides divine unity, but human effort in Torah and mitzvos redeems it.</p>\n<p><strong>Degel Machaneh Ephraim – Parshas Bereishis:</strong> Before the Shevirah, divine light was too great to be contained, but Tikun restores balance by refining lower realities.</p>\n<p><strong>Tzemach Tzedek (Derech Mitzvosecha, Mitzvas Ahavas Yisroel):</strong> Every Jew has a role in Tikun, elevating fallen sparks through ahavas Yisroel and mitzvos.</p>\n<p><strong>Likutei Moharan I, 4:</strong> Divine light is hidden within golus and hester panim; through faith and speech, one reveals Hashem’s presence in darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Likutei Halachos – Hilchos Hashkamas HaBoker 1:6:</strong> The Shevirah resulted in chaos, and every mitzvah we perform repairs this fragmentation.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Ramak describes the ideal divine order before the break, while the Ari focuses on the world after the break and our role in fixing it.</p>\n\n\n",

Both are found elsewhere. Example of the former: Deuteronomy (22:7) which relates to <strong>sending away the mother bird</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, but the young thou mayest take unto thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. (Trans. JPS)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, there are associations between general mitzvah observance, and reward, e.g. Deut. (4:1), (5:30), (6:2), (6:18), (8:1), and (11:8). </p>\n\n<p>Example of the latter: Exodus (13:9); <strong>the mitzvah of <em>tefillin</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And it should be a sign on your arm for you, and as a remembrance between your eyes, so that the law of God will be in your mouth. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, note Leviticus (23:43-4); <strong>the mitzvah of sitting in <em>sukkot</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths; so that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. (Based on JPS).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, Numbers (15:39-40); <strong>the mitzvah of <em>tsitsit</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray; so that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God. (Based on JPS).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sometimes the nature of a reason; i.e. whether it is an incentive or the very reason for the command, or both, may not be self evident. E.g. Exodus (23:12); <strong>the mitzvah of Shabbat</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; so that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. (Based on JPS).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cf. Deut. (5:14).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Esau honored his father; why didn't he honor God?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.aish.com/f/hp/48964606.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according to Aish</a>), the reason that the commandment to \"Honor Parents\" is included in the first group of the Aseret Hadibrot (Ten Commandments) is because the child-parent relationship is a model for human-God relationship.</p>\n\n<p>We know that Esau had an immense respect for his father and honored him perhaps even more than Jacob did. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel goes as far to say that <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=tPQOX87XxaUC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=esau%20honor%20parents&source=bl&ots=eN-ZEJRrbm&sig=JGUyzKaMNBIbaJgCagBPndCCBrE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjquJGTq6DRAhUp34MKHeVJBusQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=esau%20honor%20parents&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esau was the embodiment of this mitzva</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Why then, in the Rambam's view, would this relationship have not at all translated to his relationship with God? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The statement of Rambam in question, is Hilkhot Mamrim (6:1)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיבוד אב ואם מצות עשה גדולה, וכן מורא אב ואם--שקלם הכתוב בכבודו ובמוראו: כתוב \"כבד את אביך, ואת אימך\" (שמות כ,יא; דברים ה,טו), וכתוב \"כבד את ה', מהונך\" (משלי ג,ט); ובאביו ואימו כתוב \"איש אימו ואביו תיראו\" (ויקרא יט,ג), וכתוב \"את ה' אלוהיך תירא\" (דברים ו,יג; דברים י,כ). כדרך שציווה על כבוד שמו הגדול ומוראו, כך ציווה על כבודם ומוראם</p>\n  \n  <p>Respecting one's father and mother is a great positive commandment, and also revering one's father and mother--Scripture equated them to His respect and reverence. It is written: \"respect your father and your mother\" and it is written: \"respect God with your wealth\". And [similarly] regarding one's father and mother it is written: \"A man should fear his father and mother\" and it is written: \"You shall fear your God your Lord\". In the same manner that He instructed regarding respecting his great name, and its reverence, so too did he instruct regarding their honour and reverence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, Rambam is discussing the importance of honouring one's parents, and God, respectively. He says absolutely nothing about there being any causal link between the former and the latter.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, there is absolutely no question of why according to Rambam, someone possessing the former, might nonetheless lack the latter.</p>\n\n\n",

A divorced woman, or a widow, or a woman which is not virgin because of a reason x, has no problem to marry. To marry for a non virgin woman is not prohibited. For most men, to marry a non virgin woman is not prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>An exception is the Kohen Gadol (Great priest) who is prohibited to marry a divorced woman (as last kohanim) or a widow (Leviticus 21, 14): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‏ אַלְמָנָ֤ה וּגְרוּשָׁה֙ וַחֲלָלָ֣ה זֹנָ֔ה אֶת־אֵ֖לֶּה לֹ֣א יִקָּ֑ח כִּ֛י אִם־בְּתוּלָ֥ה מֵעַמָּ֖יו יִקַּ֥ח אִשָּֽׁה׃\n  ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>A widow, or a divorced woman, or defiled, or a harlot, these shall he not take; but he shall take a virgin of his own people t wife. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No woman is in duty to marry a \"virgin man\".</p>\n\n<p>Aside from this issue, there are difference in marriage settlement between a virgin and a non virgin woman. The virginity is linked to the hymen (virginal membrane).</p>\n\n<p>The verse says in Exodus 22, 16:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִם-מָאֵ֧ן יְמָאֵ֛ן אָבִ֖יהָ לְתִתָּ֣הּ ל֑וֹ כֶּ֣סֶף יִשְׁקֹ֔ל כְּמֹ֖הַר הַבְּתוּלֹֽת:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>If her father refuses absolutely to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.\n  Rashi explains that the amount is written in Deuteronomy 22, 29:\n   וְ֠נָתַן הָאִ֨ישׁ הַשֹּׁכֵ֥ב עִמָּ֛הּ לַֽאֲבִ֥י הַֽנַּעֲרָ֖ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים כָּ֑סֶף...‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From those verses the Talmud (Ketubot 11a) learns the minimal value of a Ketuba for a virgin. For a non virgin, the minimal value is lower. (this last paragraph is oversimplified, to be accurate a length paragraph would be necessary).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding extramarital (rules are different for men and women,  because a woman becomes prohibited to her husband and not the contrary,  a man can spouse several women and a woman cannot have several husbands), or non marital sexual relationship, indeed it is prohibited for men and women.  But the past  is not linked to the ability to marry.  </p>\n\n<p>A problem is when there is an accusation of lying (I do not explain the cases),  when the bride was supposed to be virgin and is accused is accused of lying by the groom.  If the bride discovered that the groom who was supposed to be \"virgin\"  is not,  this is not a case of taking a legal action.  I think that for a  man the fact to be \"not virgin\"  is not different from every other sins,  because this is not a special,  different from other  problems for a man,  I have no proof from halachic litterature. </p>\n\n\n",

The latter set reference the reason given in the first set with the words כאשר צוך, and adds an additional reason: למען ייטב לך; that God will do good to us. To understand the additional good, one must first consider the implications of the first blessing. Although it promises a long life, this may be more of a blessing to one's parents than to one's self. Therefore, Moshe added the phrase ולמען ייטב לך to reassure them that the reward for honouring one's parents isnt merely a long life, it has a further benefit to the son; that his own children will honour him as well.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding ולמען ייטב לך, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hizkuni</a> Deut.

Simchas Torah's answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/704/yisrael-or-yaakov\">Yisrael or Yaakov?</a> says that Yisrael refers to the spiritual. So why don't we say ואלקי ישראל?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This answer is partial,  it gives sources for the choice of words used, but not in the context of the dialectical relationship between the two names  Yaakov and Israel.  <em>I am not sure whether it is necessary to explain the blessing through this dialectic.</em>  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44589&st=&pgnum=70\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abudarham</a> said that the nusach follows the verse in Exodus 3, 15:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֩אמֶר֩ ע֨וֹד אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה כֹּֽה־תֹאמַר֮ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵל֒ יְהֹוָ֞ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתֵיכֶ֗ם אֱלֹהֵ֨י אַבְרָהָ֜ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֛ק וֵאלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁלָחַ֣נִי אֲלֵיכֶ֑ם זֶה־שְּׁמִ֣י לְעֹלָ֔ם וְזֶ֥ה זִכְרִ֖י לְדֹ֥ר דֹּֽר׃ ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The comments explain that zichri is \"how does one call me when praying\". See Ramban e.g. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"וזה זכרי לדר דר\" - יחזור אל אלהי אברהם אלהי יצחק ואלהי יעקב כי לא לעולם ישכח ברית אבות וכל הדורות כאשר יזכירו \"אלהי אברהם יצחק ויעקב\" ישמע אל ויענם (תהלים נה כ) ועל דרך האמת זה שמי לעולם אלהי אברהם אלהי יצחק וזה זכרי ואלהי יעקב ולכך הוסיף בו ו' וזה טעם זכרי לדר דר חסר והמשכיל יבין </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason is that G-d would not forget the alliance with the fathers. Ramban adds a special need for the name Yaakov, but I don't understand it.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Psachim and Kiddushin use this verse to explain why when we read the name Y-H-V-H we need to pronune the name  ADO-, i.e. the original  name and the the name used to call Him are not equals. The issue is how to call.  But the Abudarham adds an additional meaning in the same spirit, close to the words of the Ramban.</p>\n\n<p>The perush Keter Nehoray said that we mention avot because the avot have put  in place the prayers. {may be that since when Yaakov instituted Arvit he was not yet called Israel}. </p>\n\n<p>The formal answer is that, looking for the verse that  the blessing do paraphrase, we found  (According to Abudarham)   Shemot (3, 15) Eloke...Eloke...Eloke... This verse uses the name Yaakov,  not Israel. The reason for the choice of this verse may be, according to the Ramban, that in this verse G-d explains how to talk to Him, and to use this formula is indicated. The question \"why not Israel\" from the symbolic point of view is not answered by the cited sources. </p>\n\n\n",

Tosafot Kiddushin 30a s.v. Lo) into Scripture, Mishna, and Talmud:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושננתם לבניך? אל תקרי ושננתם אלא ושלשתם, לעולם ישלש אדם שנותיו, שליש במקרא, שליש במשנה, שליש בתלמוד. מי יודע כמה חיי? לא צריכא - ליומי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishna Berurah is inserting the study of poskim into the lineup, possibly because today poskim are the equivalent on Mishnah and Talmud in the times of the Amoraim.</p>\n\n<p>With the context of the Mishnah Berurah, we can fairly confidently suggest the amount necessary to study.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Amram Gaon writes that the daily recitation of the Korban Tamid, the fifth chapter of tractate Zevahim, and the B'raita \"R.

On the one hand, the episode of Noach getting\n  drunk illustrated that the attitudes of his three sons had indeed not\n  remained identical. On the other hand, the Torah seems to stress <strong>their\n  unity of purpose which resulted in the enterprise of building the\n  tower of Babel.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Mankind believed that their goal must be a unified one, and that all\n  of them should reside close together. Observing the order prevailing\n  in the heavenly constellations, and the fact that they all seemed\n  arranged around a central figure, i.e. the sun, they decided to build\n  their civilization by emulating that system. They did this once they\n  had moved into the valley out of their mountain caves, having learned\n  to use rainproof bricks for building.</p>\n  \n  <p>G'd in His wisdom, did not intend for mankind to remain closely\n  bunched together. <strong>Man erred in believing that their concentration was\n  an end in itself, rather than a means to an end.</strong> When urbanization is\n  the means to achieve moral perfection of man, then it is laudatory.</p>\n  \n  <p>2) Granted that stones and rocks are more enduring building materials\n  than fired bricks, the fact that they were prepared to abandon the\n  former in favour of the latter, showed that their primary objective\n  was the policy of clustering together, as stated in Genesis 11:5 \"lest\n  we be scattered on the face of the earth.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Having thus traded a higher moral purpose for the lower political\n  purpose of togetherness, G'd decided to interfere before further\n  unwelcome negative manifestations had a chance to develop.</p>\n  \n  <p>Man's collective thinking had become dangerously close to the thinking\n  of Cain, who had excelled at being a \"builder of cities\" (Genesis\n  4:17), and who also believed that this would bring him closer to\n  Heaven.</p>\n  \n  <p>4) G'd decided that some physical dispersal, while preserving the\n  spiritual ideal of striving towards moral perfection intact, was\n  preferable to mere physical togetherness. In this way, parallel to the\n  advent of the deluge, a further step was taken towards making man\n  concentrate on the attainment of higher objectives.</p>\n  \n  <p>5) When G'd \"descended,\" He examined their basic reasoning. <strong>When He\n  found that their actions were rooted in their being united, i.e. like\n  a regiment, single minded and of identical modes of expression, He\n  decided to change the course of their actions and disperse them.</strong> Thus\n  He caused linguistic changes due to change of habitat. Unity\n  henceforth ought to prevail in their striving to become servants of\n  the Lord etc., not in matters pertaining to boundaries etc. Thus their\n  error was of a kind that did not require further corrective action.\n  (punishment)</p>\n  \n  <p>One of the basic lessons we learn is that man must employ his\n  speculative faculties and not remain content with remaining static.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I mean the narratives contained in the Law which many\nconsider as being of no use whatever; e.g., the list of the various\nfamilies descended from Noah, with their names and their territories\n(Gen. x.); the sons of Seir the Horite (ibid. xxxvi. 20-30); the kings\nthat reigned in Edom (ibid. 31, seq.); and the like. There is a saying\nof our Sages (B Ṭ. Sanh. 99b) that the wicked king Manasse frequently\nheld disgraceful meetings for the sole purpose of criticising such\npassages of the Law. \"He held meetings and made blasphemous\nobservations on Scripture, saying, Had Moses nothing else to write\nthan, And the sister of Lotan was Timna\" (Gen. xxxvi. 22)? With\nreference to such passages, I will first give a general principle, and\nthen discuss them seriatim, as I have done in the exposition of the\nreasons of the precepts.</p>\n<p>Every narrative in the Law serves a certain purpose in connexion with\nreligious teaching. It either helps to establish a principle of faith,\nor to regulate our actions, and to prevent wrong and injustice among\nmen; and I will show this in each case.</p>\n<p>It is one of the fundamental principles of the Law that the Universe\nhas been created ex nihilo, and that of the human race, one individual\nbeing, Adam, was created. As the time which elapsed from Adam to Moses\nwas not more than about two thousand five hundred years, people would\nhave doubted the truth of that statement if no other information had\nbeen added, seeing that the human race was spread over all parts of\nthe earth in different families and with different languages, very\nunlike the one to the other.

Egypt is only six days’\n  travel from Hebron, and respect for his father would have justified\n  even a year’s journey! (It would) have been a grave sin to torment his\n  father by leaving him in mourning and bereavement for himself and for\n  Shim’on; even if he wanted to hurt his brothers a little, how could he\n  not feel pity for his aged father (Ramban to Gen. 42:9)?” </p>\n  \n  <p>Abarbanel poses the same question, but more bluntly:</p>\n  \n  <p>“Why did Joseph hide his identity from his brothers and speak harshly to\n  them? It is criminal to be as vengeful and recriminating as\n  a serpent!… How is it that as his brothers were starving and far from\n  home, having left their families and small children and, above all,\n  his aged, worried and suffering father waiting for them, did he not\n  show compassion, but rather intensified the anguish by arresting\n  Shim’on?” (chap. 4, question 4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>1) RAV YOEL BIN-NUN’S SOLUTION:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our entire outlook on this story changes, however, if we accept the\n  fact that Joseph did not know that his brothers had fooled his father\n  with the coat, the blood, and the lie that Joseph had been devoured by\n  wild animals.</p>\n  \n  <p>Joseph’s wonder at his father’s silence is joined by a terrible sense\n  of anxiety which grows stronger over the years, as seasons and years\n  pass by and no one comes. Joseph’s anguish centers on his father: the\n  voice inside him asking where is my father? is joined by another harsh\n  voice: Why did my father send me to my brothers that day? He concludes\n  that his brothers must have succeeded in convincing Jacob, and he has\n  been disowned. Years later, when Joseph rides in the viceroy’s\n  chariot, when he shaves his beard and stands before Pharaoh, it is\n  clear to him that God must have decreed that his life would be lived\n  separately from his family’s.

Therefore he hid the goblet by Binyamin to see if the brothers will come to his aid. That way he will know it is truly Binyamin. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה ששם עלילה על בנימין, לפי שלא היה מכירו, וחשב אולי הביאו אסופי מן\n  השוק, ואם יעליל עליו ואינו אחיהם יניחוהו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps the brothers realized that they can not play games as Shimon was imprisoned.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First of all, the brothers knew that they could not hide the \"relationship\" with a ringer. They had already shown this with Yosef, when they had been unable to act pleasantly after the dreams. Consider the way they had revealed the existence of Binyamin and the way Yosef had gotten them to speak of their family.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, they realized that they were dealing with <em>Tzafnas Paneach</em>, he who reveals the secrets. They would have been told about the dreams and about how Yosef had been raised to his position. By this time in his career, no-one would have dared attempt to deceive Yosef in any matter. After all, people would have been trying (and failing) to trick him for (at least) the previous nine years. They would know that any attempt to trick him could cause the death of all of them.</p>\n\n<p>Par'o had publicized the dreams and his displeasure with the \"answers\" that they had given him. He then declared before the entire court that Yoseph had successfully interpreted the dream and that had given the advice that would avoid the trouble that was coming and that he was the \"wise man\" who would lead Egypt. He then paraded him before the entire kingdom. The butler had announced exactly what Yosef had done.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, only by publicly announcing the famine to come and how Yosef had discovered what was to be could they justify the storage of the grain during the years of plenty. The pasuk says <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8236#showrashi=true&v=54\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Miketz 41:54</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the seven years of famine began, as Joseph had said, and there was\n  famine in all the lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was\n  bread.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the years of plenty were not attributed to Yosef, the years of famine were acknowledged as the result of his prediction.</p>\n\n<p>Third, Yosef had already shown intimate knowledge of the brothers. The medrash explains that he had seated them in order of their ages(which was not obvious) and had returned the money into the sack of each brother that a particular bag of money had come from. Note that it does not say that he returned the amount of money to each brother, but each brother received <strong>his</strong> money. Of course a medrash may not be fully accurate and it is not pshat, <strong>but</strong> it does show what was going on and how Yosef was regarded. Thus, it can be used to show that Yosef did have details at his fingertips that would have prevented trickery.</p>\n\n<p>All of this serves to explain why they did not dare to try to fool Yosef with someone else, even if they could have brought themselves to risk an innocent party. Indeed, since they realized the wrong they had done to Yosef, they could not do a similar action to someone who had not harmed them.</p>\n\n\n",

I assume these have some sort of tangible existence.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See More Nevuchim,  III,  10.</p>\n\n<p>Evil and darkness are only lack of goodness and light respectively.  Rambam explained that for such \"things\",  the verb \"ברא\" may be used in Tora,  as a verse in Yesha'ya says \"creates darkness,... creates evil\" . But the verb \"עשה\", to make is found only for actual creation.  </p>\n\n<p>The last words of the chapter, (from the Ibn Tibon's Hebrew translation) are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמיתת פעולת השם כולו טוב מאחר שהוא מציאות. וזכור מה שאמרתי לך בזה הפרק והבינהו ויתבאר לך כל מה שאמרוהו הנביאים והחכמים שהטוב כולו מפעולת השם בעצם ולשון בראשית רבה \"אין דבר רע יורד מלמעלה\".‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>English translation (Friedlander 1904):</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He creates evil only in so far as He produces the corporeal element such as it actually is: it is always connected with negatives, and is on that account the source of all destruction and all evil. Those beings that do not possess this corporeal element are not subject to destruction or evil: <strong>consequently the true work of God is all good, since it  is existence.</strong> The book which enlightened the darkness of the world says therefore, \"And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, <strong>it was very good\"</strong> (Gen. i. 31). Even the existence of this corporeal element, low as it in reality is, because it is the source of death and all evils, <strong>is likewise good for the permanence of the Universe and the continuation of the order of things,</strong> so that one thing departs and the other succeeds. Rabbi Meir therefore explains the words \"and behold it was very good\" (tob me’od); that even death was good in accordance with what we have observed in this chapter. Remember what I said in this chapter, consider it, and you will understand all that the prophets and our Sages remarked <strong>about the perfect goodness of all the direct works of God.</strong> In Bereshit Rabba (chap. i.) the same idea is expressed thus: <strong>\"No evil comes down from above.\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In conclusion,  according to  Maimonides,  because G-d's work  is good,  and there is no positive existence independently from G-d work, evil per se is not a part of  existence,  but evil is a lack of existence  perhaps may one say without intellectual discipline that evil is  'a lack of \"presence of  G-d\"' and a bit more rigorously 'a lack of perception of existence of G-d'. </p>\n\n<p>The Ramchal in Derech Hashem part I,  chapter  5, paragraph 8, addresses precisely the issue of this passage of the More Nevuchim. The language is different. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצריך שתדע כי הנה אע\"פ שבאמת סבת כל עניני הטוב בכל מקום שהם, פירוש - בין בכחות בין בתולדותיהם, הנה היא הארת פניו ית' כמ\"ש, וסבת הרע בכל מקום שהוא, העלם הארתו, אמנם לטוב יתואר האדון ב\"ה בשם סבה ממש לכללו ולפרטיו,  <strong>אך לרע לא נתארהו ית\"ש סבה ממש, כי אמנם \"אין הקב\"ה מיחד שמו על הרעה\", אלא העלם אורו והסתר פניו יחשב לשורש לו,</strong>   כי זהו סבתו באמת, וזה על צד העדר הטוב. </p>\n  \n  <p>אבל לפרטי עניניו במציאותם, הנה האדון ב\"ה שהוא כל יכול ואין לחפצו מניעה ולא ליכולתו גבול כלל, <strong>ברא שרש ומקור פרטי, מכוון בו התכלית הזה של הוצאת פרטי עניני הרע,</strong>  כפי מה ששיערה החכמה העליונה היותו מצטרך למצב הנרצה באדם ובעולם. והוא מה שאמר הכתוב, יוצר אור ובורא חשך עושה שלום ובורא רע. וענין השורש הזה הוא כלל כחות שונים, ישתלשלו מהם עניני החסרון והרעות כלם בכל בחינותיהם, בין מה שנוגע לנפש בין מה שנוגע לגוף, בכל פרטיהם למחלקותם, ועוד נדבר מזה בחלק הב' בס\"ד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=a0VRxo5_3_cC&lpg=PP1&dq=inauthor%3A%22Moshe%20%E1%B8%A4ayyim%20Luzzatto%22&hl=iw&pg=PA83#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here you can read the English translation</a> </p>\n\n<p>The two  statements in bold,  the first is equivalent to the words of the Rambam above cited,  the second,  addresses the way in which the \"absence of G-d\"  is orchestrated,  as an integral component of the creation. {if I was  mekubal,  the word Tsimtsum was a part of the explanation,  and address the discussion around the concept of tsimtsum but I am not} </p>\n\n<p>The second part of the Ramchal explanation addresses the subjective point of view of the evil existence. the fact that the presence of  G-d is hidden in, so to speak, our perceptible world. The existence of the world from an objective point of view is not clear and is  discussed in deep masterworks of Kabbalah. \nI am embarrassed to address this issue so succinctly. </p>\n\n<p>As @sabbahillel mentioned Sifre chasidut they use often the verse \"זה כנגד זה ברא אלוקים\" and the concept \"עולמות התמורה\" concerning the presence of an evil which seems equivalent to the good. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As you said in your question, all things are within Him, the First Cause.</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah writes it explicitly in 45:7 (Chabad translations):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Who forms light and creates darkness, Who makes peace and creates evil, I am HaShem, Who makes all these.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, later on in Deuteronomy the Song in Chapter 32, Verse 39:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"See now that it is I!

I read the novel \"Creation\" by Gore Vidal but did not find any satisfying answer by the two philosophers, Confucius or the Buddha. Though well-intended, there are, to them, two possibilities. Either (1) G-d is not all-good or all-powerful or (2) karma dictates that people should suffer as explained in reincarnation.[1] Both explanations are not satisfactory. I take a third approach. As Rambam pointed out, there are three things that cause suffering. I think Maimonides answered this well.</p>\n\n<p>Since G-d is good, He doe not emit evil. Evil is the result of three things, (1) people harm themselves when stepping in front of a red light or (2) people harm others as when one nation decides to dominate over another and (3) natural law, although good for the world at a whole as when a hurricane cleans the earth may harm people residing near the proximity.</p>\n\n<p>[1] Genetics, disease, drugs and diet can all effect an embryo, and are scientifically proven.

How then can his kingdom stand? 27And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out?\"</em></p>\n\n<p>What rebuttal could the Pharisees give in this context, to this seemingly rhetoric question?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>Deut. 13:2-4</strong> (numbered 1-3 in Christian Bibles)</p>\n\n<p><strong>If there will arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of a dream, and he gives you a sign or a wonder, <em>and the sign or the wonder of which he spoke to you happens</em>, [and he] says, \"Let us go after other gods which you have not known, and let us worship them,\" you shall not heed the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of a dream; <em>for the L-rd, your G-d, is testing you</em>, to know whether you really love the L-rd, your G-d, with all your heart and with all your soul.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Judaism accepts that it is possible for someone to actually be able to produce a miracle and yet still be an evil-doer. The main proof of any would-be miracle worker's righteousness, is that his message not contradict the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if in fact Jesus did exorcise demons, it is still possible that this was a test to see if the Jews would accept teachings contrary to the Torah. Rather than being a house divided, the evil pawns (demons) agreed to be removed in order to ensnare innocent souls into joining a new religion other than true Judaism. That is what a \"test\" of faith is, according to the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>Since the OP is bringing Christian sources, (and although Jews do not believe in the New Testament) it is also proper to answer that the OP's question is easily solved even according to the New Testament.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew 7:21-23</strong> - The Sermon On The Mount: False Followers</p>\n\n<p>\"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter. \"Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, <strong>did we not prophesy in your name, and <em>in your name cast out demons</em>, and in your name perform many miracles?</strong>' \"And then I will declare to them, '<strong>I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.'</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here we see that Jesus himself does not accept the successful casting out of demons as a certain sign of the exorcist's righteousness. He actually says that casting out demons can be accomplished by people who practice lawlessness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:9</strong></p>\n\n<p>The coming of the <strong>lawless one</strong> will be accompanied by the <strong>working of Satan</strong>, with every kind of power, sign, and false wonder.</p>\n\n<p>So now we come full circle. If the NT agrees that the anti-christ is the \"lawless one\" and he is called \"lawless\" because that is how Satan works...and casting out demons can also be performed by lawless people...then ipso facto :) the NT just said that Satan also casts out demons!</p>\n\n<p>So if Jesus knows this, why can't the Pharisees use this as an answer too??</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the apostle Paul is also in agreement with this line of reasoning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2 Corinthians 11: 12-15</strong></p>\n\n<p>But I will keep on doing what I am doing, in order to undercut those who want an opportunity to be regarded as our equals in the things they boast about. For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, <strong>for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light</strong>. It is not surprising, then, if <strong>his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness</strong>. Their end will correspond to their actions.</p>\n\n<p>If a demon (servant of Satan?) masquerades by pretending he is listening to the \"righteous decree\" of a true prophet, and running out of a victim's soul; then maybe the one telling him to leave is Satan pretending to be of the light?</p>\n\n<p>There is no \"house divided\". It is just a con game. The NT tells us that Satan is capable of really good cons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mathew 24:24</strong></p>\n\n<p>For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders that would deceive even the elect, if that were possible.</p>\n\n<p>So the Pharisees were just thinking what the New Testament was thinking all along. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The answer is that, for Jews, Satan is <strong>not</strong> an entity running a kingdom in opposition to God. Believing Satan to be a separate power wholly apart from God and His influence, and that the demons are working for him, would be deemed idolatry.</p>\n\n<p>Google \"shtei reshuyos\" or \"shtei reshuyot\" for sources on why Jews consider this heresy or idolatry.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer is simple. If the original statement was \"<strong>this man</strong> drives out demons...\", the Pharisees could have said that they drive out demons by asking God.  They perhaps could have continued that by saying, 'You aren't really driving out the demons. You are \"horse trading\" with Beelzebul.' But at that point of the conversation, it didn't really matter because Jesus's answer was too snappy and could only be countered with another zinger.</p>\n\n\n",

However, this is only discussing the concept of kinyan gezeilah. Is the property deemed part of the thief's domain while he is in possession, or is it always halachically viewed as being in the victim's domain? For instance, everyone holds that movables (metaltelin) do in fact enter the thief's domain even though the object rightfully still belongs to the victim. This \"entering of the thief's domain\" is a halachic status of domain regarding accidental loss.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Sages have a drashah from a verse which excludes land from being treated as having entered the thief's domain regarding accidental loss.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone however holds that land can be stolen by using it without the owner's permission.

If karka is nigzeles, then the sukkah is stolen property. It may be in the thief's domain for responsibility, but it still essentially belongs to the victim. R' Eliezer holds that a sukkah needs to be \"yours\" (\"Lecha\") like a lulav. If karka einah nigzeles, then the sukkah never enters the thief's domain. The sukkah might not be halachically viewed as switching domains, but it is at least \"borrowed\" without permission. This also does not qualify as \"your\" sukkah.</p>\n\n<p>This seems to be <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Sukkah.31a.4.1?lang=bi&p2=Sukkah.31a.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's explanation</a> on Sukkah 31a.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sarah nursing idolaters' children\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (BM 87b) relates that at the time that Avraham made a feast for Yitzchak'a birth, the nations mocked him and Sarah, saying that they adopted him, or that he was Avimelech's son with Sarah. HaShem made Yitzchak look just like Avraham so everyone could see he was the father, and Sarah nursed all of their guest's children to show that she was physically capable of being his mother.</p>\n\n<p>In those times, everyone worshipped idolatry except for Avraham and his family and followers. After all, Avraham was called the Ivri because he was on one side and the world was on the other (Pesikta Rabasi 33:1). So how was Sarah able to do this, when the Mishnah (AZ 26a) says that one may not nurse an idolatress's baby? Avraham and Sarah observed the Torah before it was given (see, for instance, BM ibid., Bereishis Rabbah 84:4, et. al.). Granted that the Gemara there discusses that one may do so in cases of Eivah, what Eivah would there be in our case if she refused? The heter is Eivah, not Leitzanus.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The woman is permitted to nurse if <em>she has too much milk</em> and it hurts (see Shul.Ar.

But, I heard once --source?..-- that all converts that arrived are \"from Sara's milk\" (חלב מטהר , see the history with Antoninus; apart that it was a great קדוש השם that the two Judaism's leaders had such a miracle). So, here, it was permitted. [But then, why not <em>always</em> say that, in place of \"she grows a child for idolatry?...]</p>\n\n\n",

The eight days of Sukkos consist of the seven days of the festival of Sukkos and conclude with the festival of Shemini Atzeres. During the first seven days, there are a total of seventy bulls that are brought as offerings. These seventy bulls represent all the nations of the world<sup>1</sup>, commonly categorized into seventy nations<sup>2</sup>. The eighth day, Shemini Atzeres, requires only one bull offering. This lone bull represents the nation of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of these offerings is that after all is said and done, the Jewish people are Hashem’s unique nation. After all the nations in the world partake of the party of Sukkos, Hashem specifically asks us to stick around for one extra day<sup>3</sup>. Sukkos culminates in a single offering, showing the intimate relationship G-d has with the Jews<sup>4</sup> <sup>5</sup>. We are described as Hashem’s unique portion<sup>6</sup>, and the eight-day festival of Sukkos makes that clear.</p>\n\n<p>Until the Greek subjugation, all nations of the world knew the Jewish people’s uniqueness. Indeed, this was often the cause for antisemitism. The Greeks were the first to have the audacity to question this unique relationship with Hashem. They were bold enough<sup>7</sup> to claim that we had no portion in Hashem<sup>8</sup>. They felt that the Torah was just another intellectual pursuit, and was just as much theirs to learn. It belonged with their study of math and science and philosophy. There was nothing unique to the Jewish people. The Greek’s many decrees against Judaism were to emphasize this belief.</p>\n\n<p>When the Maccabees defeated the Greek army, there was no better way to celebrate than to celebrate similar to the festival of Sukkos. The Greek’s denied the uniqueness of the Jewish people, and Sukkos epitomizes that uniqueness. Although Chanukah became its own distinct holiday, it still shares aspects with Sukkos. This is because it reestablished the Jewish people’s unique role in history, and confirmed their intimate relationship with Hashem.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <strong>Sukkah</strong> 55b</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> For example, see <strong>Midrash Tanchuma</strong> <em>Noach</em> § 3, <strong>Bamidbar Rabbah</strong> 2:3, <strong>Rashi</strong> to <strong>Exodus</strong> 2:14</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> <strong>Sukkah</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em>; <strong>Rashi</strong> to <strong>Leviticus</strong> 23:36 and <strong>Numbers</strong> 29:36</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> See <strong>Ma’aseh Rav</strong> § 233 for a deeper insight into this differentiation</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> See <strong>Meshech Chochmah</strong> <em>parshas VeZos HaBeracha</em> (end) who uses this to explain why we read <em>parshas Vezos HaBeracha</em> on Shemini Atezeres, and it’s not because that’s when we finish the Torah. Even those that completed the Torah every three years would read every Shemini Atezres <em>Vezos HaBeracha</em>. It’s also why we read <strong>I Kings</strong> Chapter 8 for the haftarah (<strong>Megillah</strong> 29b).</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> <strong>Maharsha</strong> to <strong>Sukkah</strong> <em>loc. cit. s.v.</em> הני ע' פרים</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> The Greek empire is symbolized by a leopard (<strong>Daniel</strong> 7:6, see <strong>Rashi</strong> <em>ad. loc.</em>), which is associated with boldness (<strong>Avos</strong> 5:20)</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> <strong>Bereishis Rabbah</strong> 2:4.

One could therefore claim that their \"real\" names were something other than their popular names.

He lived from 1140 until 1217.</p>\n\n<p>He wrote a \"will\" containing 78 mystical instructions for life. Among them is #20 which says that one should never close up a window or doorway.

Doesn't that mean that Moses was a product of incest since his mother was married to her nephew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Avunculate marriage is marriage between an uncle and a niece or between an aunt and a nephew.</p>\n\n<p>The latter is Biblically forbidden (Leviticus 18:12-3). The former, however, is not, and the Talmud actually encourages it (Yevamot 62b-63a).</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, R. Saul Lieberman z\"l contends that the Talmudic encouragement for marrying one's niece, was specifically meant to counter a Sadduceean position that banned marriage to nieces, in spite of the lack of explicit Biblical prohibition. (Tosefta Ki-fshutah (New York: JTS, 1973) pg. 915).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Moses, he was indeed the product of a union that was subsequently forbidden after the Law was given. (Exod. 6:20). Regarding a possible violation of Noahide incest laws, some state that she was a paternal aunt, rather than a maternal aunt. (Yalkut Shim'oni B'reshit: 25, cf. Rashi Exod. 6:20). Others are of the opinion that Noahide law does not include a prohibition to marry an aunt (cf. Sanhedrin 58a, Hilkhot Issurei Biah 14:10).</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hizkuni</a> suggest <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni,_Exodus.6.20.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in his commentary to (Exod. 6:20)</a> that Moses' lineage wasn't a bug; it was a feature!

Nattan Adler</a>, the mentor of the Hattam Soffer, was of the opinion that the Oral Law may only be written to avoid it being forgotten, and he, who would remember it anyway, was not permitted to write it. (Cf. for example Yalkut Yossef: Pesukei D'zimra V'kriat Sh'ma; notes to chapter 49).</p>\n\n<p>One can certainly question how compelling this argument is, given that writing is a crucial way of conveying information to future generations, but regardless a very similar statement is actually made by his student <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sofer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hattam Soffer</a>, in a responsum to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ts'vi Hirsch Hajes</a> (Vol. I OH #280):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מלבד שהוא עובר איסור דאורייתא דברים שבעל פה אי אתה רשאי לכותבן ולא הותר אלא משום עת לעשות לה' [כגיטין ס' ע\"א] ואם איננו עושה לה' הרי איסורו במקומו עומד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes that one who publishes a work with ulterior motives, violates the injunction against recording the Oral Law, which is only permitted for one with the intention of acting for the sake of God.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is important to note, that while he does indeed indicates that the prohibition is still active, and is merely held in abeyance by appropriate exceptions, this statement is made in the somewhat flowery beginning of the responsum, and not as part of an involved halakhic discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is certainly a minority view. As many have noted (e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Faur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hakham Faur</a> S\"t in Golden Doves With Silver Dots p. 102), Rambam omits this rule entirely from his halakhic writings, (referencing it only as a historical practice in Moreh Nevokhim I:71) indicating that it is no longer a concern, if it ever was.</p>\n\n<p>The, the mainstream approach in poskim is to assume as a matter of fact that the prohibition is totally obsolete today, and it is thus not generally invoked in halakhic works. Like Rambam, the Tur and the Shulhan Arukh, for example, only mention the issue of reciting the Written Law orally, but not the issue of writing the Oral Law.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, the Talmud (Niddah 13b) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מאי דכתיב ידיכם דמים מלאו - אלו המנאפים ביד</p>\n  \n  <p>What is the meaning of the verse: \"your hands are full of blood\" (Isaiah 1:15) - these are those who commit forbidden sexual acts with their hands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi (ibid) explains that this refers to masturbation.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this passage, Rambam writes (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5121.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Issurei Biah 21</a>:18):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אסור להוציא שכבת זרע לבטלה</strong>; לפיכך לא יהיה אדם דש מבפנים וזורה מבחוץ, ולא יישא קטנה שאינה ראויה לוולד.  אבל <strong>אלו שמנאפין ביד, ומוציאין שכבת זרע--לא דיי שהוא איסור גדול, אלא שעושה זה בנידוי הוא יושב</strong>; <strong>ועליהם נאמר \"ידיכם, דמים מלאו\" (ישעיהו א,טו), וכאילו הרגו נפש</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is forbidden to masturbate...One who does; besides for the fact that it is a great sin, becomes excommunicated. And regarding them it is stated: \"your hands are full of blood\", and it is as though he committed murder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also noteworthy, is that even thoughts that can lead to nocturnal emissions are presented as being prohibited by Hazal (Avodah Zara 20b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר: ונשמרת מכל דבר רע - שלא יהרהר אדם ביום ויבוא לידי טומאה בלילה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosafot there understand that this is a full derasha (and thus in their view, a biblical commandment). This is also the implication of Ramban (Hullin 37b) who is in turn quoted (without citation) by Ran's commentary there. If even these thoughts are biblically forbidden, masturbation would certainly seem to be considered biblically inappropriate. Other Rishonim dispute this this is actually a biblical prohibition (e.g. Ye'reim 45).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Mishna (Nida 2,  1) already mentions this issur. (And this is the only place where there is such cruel expression.)</p>\n\n<p>Here you have the mishna and the Talmud on it:</p>\n\n<p><strong>מתני': כל היד המרבה לבדוק בנשים משובחת ובאנשים תקצץ</strong>: גמ' מ''ש נשים ומאי שנא אנשים נשים לאו בנות הרגשה נינהו משובחות אנשים דבני הרגשה נינהו תקצץ אי הכי מאי איריא מרבה כי לא מרבה נמי כי קתני מרבה אנשים   […]   גופא <strong>ר''א אומר כל האוחז באמה ומשתין כאילו מביא מבול לעולם</strong> אמרו לו לרבי אליעזר והלא נצוצות נתזין על רגליו ונראה ככרות שפכה ונמצא מוציא לעז על בניו שהן ממזרים אמר להן מוטב שיוציא לעז על בניו שהן ממזרים ואל יעשה עצמו רשע שעה אחת לפני המקום תניא אידך אמר להן רבי אליעזר לחכמים אפשר יעמוד אדם במקום גבוה וישתין או ישתין בעפר תיחוח <strong>ואל יעשה עצמו רשע שעה אחת לפני המקום</strong> הי אמר להו ברישא אילימא קמייתא אמר להו ברישא בתר ד<strong>אמר להו איסורא</strong> הדר אמר להו תקנתא אלא הא אמר להו ברישא ואמרו ליה אין לו מקום גבוה ועפר תיחוח מאי אמר להן מוטב שיוציא לעז על בניו ואל יעשה עצמו רשע שעה אחת לפני המקום <strong>וכל כך למה מפני שמוציא שכבת זרע לבטלה דא''ר יוחנן כל המוציא שכבת זרע לבטלה חייב מיתה</strong> שנאמר {בראשית לח-י} וירע בעיני ה' אשר עשה וימת גם אותו רבי יצחק ורבי אמי אמרי <strong>כאילו שופך דמים</strong> שנאמר {ישעיה נז-ה} הנחמים באלים תחת כל עץ רענן שוחטי הילדים בנחלים תחת סעיפי הסלעים אל תקרי שוחטי אלא סוחטי רב אסי אמר <strong>כאילו עובד עבודת כוכבים</strong> כתיב הכא תחת כל עץ רענן וכתיב התם {דברים יב-ב} על ההרים הרמים ותחת כל עץ רענן</p>\n\n\n",

My first encounter was in the Bucharim section with a certain \"chacham Betzalel\" many years ago. There was a line of people waiting there. When my turn came, he asked me my father's name which he wrote down, then asked me my name and he wrote it down. Then he wrote down my mother's name without asking me. He then proceeded to tell me all sorts of things about both without my saying a word. He also said they were not compatible (turns out they divorced). All of what he said was spot on. However, I then went to Rabbi Yaakov Hillel and he told me, yes i know him but don't trust him. I found out later from other sources that this man uses forces of tum'a to do what he does. So from my experience the phenomena is real (and Rabbi Hillel <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/45058/1857\">agrees</a>) but one must be very careful to ask one of the Gedolei Hador (greatest torah scholars of the generation) to be sure it is not from the bad side.

Cast him into this pit, which is in the desert, but do not lay a hand upon him,\" in order to save him from their hand[s], to return him to his father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The same word is then used in 25, 28, and 30. Later, when Yosef gets in trouble because of the accusations of Potifar's wife, he is put into the Beit hasohar [בֵּית הַסֹּהַר ] 39:20, the jail. This term for jail repeats in 21, 22, and 23.</p>\n\n<p>In perek 40, beit hasohar is used in pasuk 3, and 5. Then, when Yosef is explaining his plight and asking for help from the cupbearer, he asks to be taken out of \"habayit hazeh\" this house [הַבַּיִת הַזֶּה] (40:14).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But remember me when things go well with you, and please do me a favor and mention me to Pharaoh, and you will get me out of this house.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He explains that he was stolen from the land of the Ivrim, and he insists that also here (Egypt) he did nothing wrong</p>\n\n<p>\"כִּי שָׂמוּ אֹתִי בַּבּוֹר\"</p>\n\n<p>this is translated as \"for them to have put me in the dungeon\" (Artscroll), \"for which they have put me into the dungeon.\" (Judaica Press, on the Chabad site).</p>\n\n<p>Both of these translations follow Onkelos and T\"Y and translate \"habor\" as \"the dungeon\" but if Yosef knows the term beit hasohar and that is the term the text consistently uses, and he is relating that everything happened because he was stolen from his original land, wouldn't it make as much sense to explain it as \"all because they [the brothers] put me in the pit\" or something to that effect? Textually, Yosef was never placed in a dungeon! Just a jail.</p>\n\n<p>In 41:14, in order to get Yosef to interpret Paroh's dreams, he is taken \"min habor\" which is translated as \"from the dungeon\" even though he was never in a dungeon and this moment is a symbolic rising from the pit (physically or emotionally) which leads to his reuniting with his family.</p>\n\n<p>Why would the translations choose to have \"bor\" suddenly refer to the prison/dungeon and not the pit, the way it had been used?</p>\n\n<h2>Do any meforshim explain \"bor\" as referring to the pit and not the prison/dungeon?</h2>\n\n<p>A thought -- going to Far'oh was the ultimate reversal of what had happened via his brothers. Bor always means \"pit\" not dungeon (apologies to Rashi) and refers to the state created by the initial action. They threw him into a pit, now he is taken out of THAT pit. They removed his cloak, now he is given new clothing. They caused mourning, now he is shaved. So the text is not speaking literally of his being taken from jail but of his rise to power.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Peshat, two Rishonim deal with why this term is used to refer to jail here, although neither interprets it as the \"original pit\" that Yosef was thrown into by his brothers.</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Ibn_Ezra_Second_Commentary/Shemot/11.5#t2e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to Shemos 11:5</a>) notes that at night, Egyptian prisoners were thrown into pits to sleep in.  Therefore (my conclusion), these two times when Yosef is speaking in regards to dreams that just occurred, and it is likely early in the morning, he is in the \"pit\" of the jail, as opposed to the general or \"day\" jail.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Avraham ben Harambam (to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/40.15#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 40:15</a>) suggests that being thrown into the pit was some form of extra punishment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>או (בור) ממש כמו שאנחנו רואים המלכים בימינו חובשים בדות החפור בתוך ההר למי שרוצים להכביד (עליו) במשמרו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, it could have been that he had recently been transferred to the \"maximum security\" pit, and was explaining that this level of jail was especially unfair for him.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Bereishit.41.14.1?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gur Aryeh (to Rashi Bereishis 41:14)</a> suggests that Yosef had been placed in the \"bor\" as a punishment before being sent to jail.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now that I've done a quick search, it looks like the Tzeror Hamor says that it refers to the original pit (although I'm not quite sure what he's actually saying):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואיני שואל ממך דבר גדול אלא והוצאתני מן הבית הזה ולא מן הבור. כי אתה רואה בעיניך שאיני אסור בבית האסורין אלא פקיד וממונה עליהם. והטעם כי גנוב גנבתי מארץ העברים וגם פה לא עשיתי מאומה בפועל ממה שדברו עלי כי שמו אותי מתחלה בבור.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Also, Keli Yakar (42:7) and Alshich (42:6) make the connection between the two stories, as you suggest.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some alternate notes: Firstly, even if it refers to the dungeon, it is very likely that Yosef could have said it with the \"pit\" in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, \"thrown in a pit\" could be used simply as a figure of speech by Yosef in order to elicit more pity, etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Peshitta translates <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37701&st=&pgnum=80\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">41:14</a> as 'pit'. </p>\n\n\n",

Yosef wanted to interview  the young brother, to verify they were telling the truth. Kli Yakar says that commentators are focusing on a change in the manner in which Yosef expresses the reason of his need to speak with the young brother. in verse 42, 16, he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שִׁלְח֨וּ מִכֶּ֣ם אֶחָד֘ וְיִקַּ֣ח אֶת-אֲחִיכֶם֒ וְאַתֶּם֙ הֵאָ֣סְר֔וּ</p>\n<p><strong>וְיִֽבָּֽחֲנוּ֙ דִּבְרֵיכֶ֔ם</strong> הַֽאֱמֶ֖ת אִתְּכֶ֑ם וְאִם-לֹ֕א</p>\n<p>חֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה כִּ֥י מְרַגְּלִ֖ים אַתֶּֽם:‏</p>\n<p>Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and you shall be kept in prison, that <strong>your words may be proved</strong>, whether there is any truth in you; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The commentators explained that \"בחינה\" (testing) refers to a detailed questioning about the facts {see Sanhedrin chapter 4}, there is an advantadge to interview a child, who responds spontaneously to questions. The brothers did not accept such an approach. <strong>They were worried Binyamin get confused and say something against them because Yosef will causing him to confuse.</strong> They chose therefore  to go to jail. Afterward, Yosef  released them from prison and change his way of talking, saying  \"ויאמינו דבריכם\" (your words will be taken seriously). Her ccorrected his  vocabulary  and said that he want not  to ask the young brother anything. Then, they agreed to bring him. According to this we understand the words of Yehuda \"you said 'ואשימה עיני עליו'\". The fact that he comes is a sufficient proof that we tell the truth. How have you changed your mind about him and you, against us.\nI hope that this help a little bit.</p>\n\n\n",

But it does seem like a quite prevelalant practice. Where did this practice begin and what is the reason for doing so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Zvi Ron wrote an <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol13Ron.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">entire article</a> about this in Ḥakirah (vol. 13).</p>\n\n<p>To quote and summarize: the earliest source is the Hattam Soffer (19th century) [i]: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He explains that mirrors were turned around to face \n  the  wall  based  on  the  mourning  practice  of kefiat  hamittah,  overturning  the  beds.  The  Babylonian  Talmud  (Mo‘ed  Katan\n    15b)  gives Bar Kappara’s reason for this practice. Man was created in the image of God; because of human sin resulting in death this Divine image is \n  ‘overturned.’  To  represent  this  idea  we  overturn  our  beds.  The Jerusalem Talmud (Mo‘ed Katan\n   3:5) gives another reason. The marital bed is the facilitator for relations between husband and wife to create  new  life. This  facilitator  is  overturned  when  a  life  has  ended.</p>\n  \n  <p>Hatam Sofer explains that although we no longer practice the overturning  of  beds, the  reasons  given  in  both  Talmuds  apply  to  mirrors  as  well.  Mirrors  contain  the image  of  the  person  looking  into  them, so mirrors are turned around because the Divine image in the \n  deceased  has  been  ‘overturned.’  Additionally,  Rashi  (Ex.  38:8)  explains  that  in  Egypt  mirrors  facilitated  relations  between  husband  and  wife,  just  like  the  beds.  Therefore  the  mirrors  are  turned  around  in  a  house  of  mourning,  just  as  beds  were  overturned  in Talmudic times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Aharon\n Ziegler reports in \nthe  name  of  R.  Soloveitchik  th\nat  the  connection  between  overturned beds and mirrors is that both act as reminders that intimate \nrelations are suspended during the \nshivah;\n furthermore, mirrors are \nan \nexpression  of  vanity  and  should  not  be  used  in  a  house  of  mourning [ii]</p>\n\n<p>A variety of other explanations have been proposed, such as mirrors bringing joy, mirrors being covered to facilitate prayer in their presence, avoiding seeing evil spirits that lurk in the house of the mourner.</p>\n\n<p>Particularly this last reason which associates reflective surfaces with spirits; particularly of the dead, seems to have been a fairly common non-Jewish idea. Indeed, even the practice of covering the mirrors was practiced by gentiles, although sometimes without connecting it to this reason.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, decades before the earliest mention of the practice in Jewish literature, we find funerals in Scotland being described [iii]:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I know not for what  reason  they  lock  up  all  the  cats  of  the  house,  and  cover  all  looking glasses as soon as any of the family dies, nor can they give any  satisfactory  account  of  it</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, reflective surfaces were covered for President Lincoln's funeral:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The  East  Room,  in  which  the  remains  were  laid, was decorated in mourning... the windows at either end of the room were draped with black barege [a sheer fabric], the frames of the mirrors...being  heavily  draped  with  the  same  material. [iv]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even earlier, in 1841, we find the same thing upon the death of President Harrison. [v]</p>\n\n<p>Fascinatingly, This  custom  to  cover  mirrors  after  a  death  occurs  is  found  all  over  the  world,  including  the  places  where  all  the  earliest  Jewish  references  to  the  custom  originated,  Hungary, Romania  and  Transylvania.</p>\n\n<p>Besides  the  countries already mentioned it has been documented in places as diverse as  the  Dominican  Republic, England, China, India  and Madagascar.</p>\n\n<p>While today a popular Jewish custom, R.  Moshe  Tzuriel,  has  written  that  this  is  an  inappropriate  custom  and  should  be  discontinued.

This was allowed to them by Rabbis E Hildesheimer and S R Hirsch. Rav Weinberg supported this teaching with the views of those Rishonim who held that there was only a prohibition when the man had intention to enjoy the voice of the woman. Additionally, singing together meant that the voice of one individual woman could not be distinguished. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Weinberg decided that one could rely on the views of these German Rabbonim in order to develop love of Torah etc. in boys and girls and to guard against assimilation. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Waldenberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav E I Waldenberg</a> does not support the view of Rav Weinberg. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%95%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikiyeshiva</a> does not mention Rav Weinberg. It says that there is no difference if one or more women sing together. There are those (Chasan Sofer) who are unsure whether men and women may sing together insofar as the man does not distinguish the voice of the woman (and so it should not be forbidden). But Wikiyeshiva says that most other poskim reject this view and hold that one may not hear the voices of men and women singing together. </p>\n\n<p>Conclusion:\nThere are some authorities that have allowed hearing multiple women singing and some others hold that it is forbidden.

Why was this new teaching accepted since it was not received from one's Rabbi? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe the Alter Rebbe (although I don't remember where) mentions that each 1,000 year period in history can be compared to one of the days of Creation. For instance, the years 0-1000 are compared to the first day of Creation, 1000-2000 are compared to the second day, 2000-3000 are compared to the third day, and on and on. The years 5000-6000, the years we live in now (5777), is compared to the sixth day of Creation, or Erev Shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>Once Moshiach arrives, he will teach everyone the secrets of the Torah (kabbalah) in a way where everyone will fully understand. This is the one thousand year period (6000-7000) that is compared to Shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>There is a mitzvah to taste the foods prepared for Shabbos on Friday. From this the Alter Rebbe teaches that we are allowed to \"taste\" so to speak the secrets of the Torah during the period of Erev Shabbos before Moshiach comes and teaches us the secrets in a true, fully explained light. This is why we can learn the Zohar openly, and there is no more secretive teaching of it from one teacher to one student.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a scan of the notes I took from my rebbi concerning this principle.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TkQan.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TkQan.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>First a disclaimer; I have not learnt much Kabbalah seforim and alot of what I will be saying is based of what my teachers told me not experience. </p>\n\n<p>If you look at the very old Kabbalah seforim such as raziel hamalach, Sefer yetzirah, bahir to the average student it means nothing it simply isn't saying anything one could understand without it being taught and explained to you by somebody who already knows. Possibly, I assume once one would have a certain amount of understanding they would be able to figure it out on their own. For example the Sefer yetzirah says there are \"10 sefiros, bli mah\" literally 10 sefiros without anything. That tells you basically nothing. </p>\n\n<p>Zohar is written very differently. It's more like a shuir on the various topics (which in fact it was, to the rashbi's students). There are moshulim and concepts are elaborated on to some extant. I am not going to say it's easy to understand, but whereas the older seforim, things are just stated as they are, Zohar tries to teach it. I would like to compare it to Mishna vs Gemara. The Mishna says in case X the din is Y. No explanation what X is or why the din would be Y. The Gemara comes and explains. Now to us the Gemara still needs much commentary but it's definitely a much more open book than the Mishna. (This is my own comparison, and definitely not a perfect one.)</p>\n\n<p>So to state it philosophically. Pre Zohar kabbalah was meant only for a select few, the greatest of the generation. Post Zohar kabbalah became for everyone. </p>\n\n\n",

Can someone else clarify this for me? Is  there really some sort of Jewish custom to avoid handshaking? Is it based on any particular halacha? Is it because it's considered a gentile custom? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/09/04/shaking-hands-with-a-woman/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dinonline</a> where they discuss the question of shaking hands with the opposite gender. In the course of the answer, they quote sources which assume there is no question of shaking the hands of the same gender: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Ben Ish Chai (Od Yosef Hai, Shofetim 22) records the European\n  practice of tightly grasping the hands of the host and hostess upon\n  arriving in a person’s home, and states that because this expresses\n  mutual feelings of friendship and affection, it is considered derech\n  chibah and is forbidden...From Sefer Chassidim (1090), which is quoted by the Ben Ish Chai, it is clear that this will apply even when both parties are wearing gloves. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seemingly, there wouldn't be a halachic reason in \"ultra-orthodox\" circles to avoid shaking hands with the <em>same gender</em> as the seforim view handshakes as a form of friendship. Nonetheless, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1051760/jewish/May-I-Shake-the-Ladys-Hand.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> is interesting to note within the context of not shaking hands with the opposite gender:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This concept is also evidenced with regards to touching someone (even\n  of the same gender) for whom one has a great deal of respect. For that\n  reason, when the late Rebbe of Chabad was alive, his followers did not\n  shake his hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps some of the Chassidim you notice are following similar lines as a sign of respect towards one another or they might just be following their own cultural custom which I personally see with some of my friends from chassidish circles. At the same time, other friends from the same circles who seem to be more outgoing are not shy when extending their hands.  </p>\n\n\n",

His reaction seems disproportionately passive. (Bereishit 45):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>כו</strong> וַיַּגִּדוּ לוֹ לֵאמֹר, עוֹד יוֹסֵף חַי, וְכִי-הוּא מֹשֵׁל, בְּכָל-אֶרֶץ מִצְרָיִם; וַיָּפָג לִבּוֹ, כִּי לֹא-הֶאֱמִין לָהֶם.  <strong>כז</strong> וַיְדַבְּרוּ אֵלָיו, אֵת כָּל-דִּבְרֵי יוֹסֵף אֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּר אֲלֵהֶם, וַיַּרְא אֶת-הָעֲגָלוֹת, אֲשֶׁר-שָׁלַח יוֹסֵף לָשֵׂאת אֹתוֹ; וַתְּחִי, רוּחַ יַעֲקֹב אֲבִיהֶם.  <strong>כח</strong> וַיֹּאמֶר, יִשְׂרָאֵל, רַב עוֹד-יוֹסֵף בְּנִי, חָי; אֵלְכָה וְאֶרְאֶנּוּ, בְּטֶרֶם אָמוּת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One may say that he was caught in the moment and was so happy of the good news that he didn't rebuke his sons. But this is difficult, since we <em>never</em> hear a word of rebuke even at a later stage. If one were to say that Yaakov saw the hand of God despite their negative actions, and it was a blessing; you could say that about any bad thing that happens i.e. Hashem has a plan which comes to pass through negative things in any case. But this doesn't mean that we are 'ok with' those bad things, or poor decisions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=583\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Da'at Z'keinim Miba'alei Hatosfot</a> on Breishit 45:4.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, he states that when Joseph reveals himself, he says, \"I am Joseph.

Why do we treat tzitzit like seforim, which cannot be on the floor, instead of like other tashmishei mitzvah such as the lulav, the Sukkah, wine for kiddush etc which can touch the floor?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To turn attention to this issue is reported in name of the Agur.</p>\n\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 21, 4, the SA recommends not  to letting  the Tsitsit drag on the floor  when he wears  a Talit, Mishna Berura explained that this is <strong>an abasement of the mitsva.</strong> Magen Avraham says in name of the Agur (quoted in Bet Yosef) that about one who drags his tsitsit on the floor,  the verse (Isaiah 14, 23) says \"and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction\". </p>\n\n<p>In Magen Avraham and Kaf Hachayim the statement of the Agur is discussed, and this results in halachic controversy. </p>\n\n<p>The \nMagen Avraham cites two Gemarot that contradict  apparently the Halacha stated by  the Agur. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Berachot 18a:\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Hiyya and Rabbi Jonathan were once walking about in a cemetery, and the blue fringe of Rabbi Jonathan was trailing on the ground.

From this Gemara, we learn to hide Tsitsit in cemetery.  To walk in cemetery with appearing tsitsit seems as we make fun of death they have no more mitsvot. Magen Avraham asks. The disrespect for death is the only problem! What about the problem of dragging the ground.?  </p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Gittin 56a:\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ben Zizith Hakeseth was so called because his fringes [zizith] used to trail on cushions [keseth].</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If his tsitsit trailon cushions,  the tsitsit of standard men trail on the ground, and this is not a problem. </p>\n\n<p>The Kaf Hachayim says in name of the Nahar Shalom that the problem cited by the Agur is a case in which the tsitsit drags constantly on the ground.  But if the tsitsit touch from time to time the ground,  there's no problem. Other poskim said that the problem is when one steps on tstsiot. </p>\n\n<p>According to the Kaf Hachayim the reason for which the mechaber did not quote the words of the Agur in SA is the fact that the two Gemarot above cited seems to contradict him. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So,  at least following some poskim, people who are makpid to pick up your tsitsit when you are sitting can be allowed to cool down.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham indeed,  said that the graves were high and far from the ground, so there was no problem with the ground apart from graves.Thus, if the graves were at the level of the ground, there was a double problem of honoring death and honoring tsitsit, despite the lightness of the touching of the tsitsit of Rabbi Yonathan. The Magen Avraham thinks that the two Gemarot above cited are easily answered and don't contradict the Agur at all. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><code>Why do we treat tzitzit like seforim instead of like other tashmishei mitzvah?</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>--></strong> We do not this,  see the three previous seifim in the siman,  saif 3 for instance,  permits to enter the washroom with tsitsit,  Saif 1, according to the SA, we can throw in the garbage scratched tsitsit.  Sefer Tora is different from those points of view. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Vayigash - Why didn't the family go back?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The brothers and Yaakov moved to Egypt after Yosef revealed himself. Yosef asked them to move to Goshen because \"there still remains 5 years of famine, and [if you were to stay in the land\" you may become destitute, you and your household, and all that is yours\" (45:11)</p>\n\n<p>However the Rambam rules (Melachim 5:9): \n“It is always prohibited to go from the land of Israel to outside of the land, except to study Torah or to marry a woman or to save (possessions) from non-Jews, and [then] to return to the land. And so [too] may he go out for business. But to dwell outside the Land is prohibited unless there is intense famine…”</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam explains the difference between a famine and leaving Eretz Yisrael for other reasons e.g Torah study is only temporary. As opposed to leaving because of a famine, it is permitted to actually live and settle in Chutz La'aretz.</p>\n\n<p>If so, once the famine was finished, why didn't the family, and Yaakov included not return back to Israel once the famine was over? As we know in Parshas Vayechi it says that Yaakov lived in the land for a total of 17 years, meaning he stayed post-famine another 12 years.</p>\n\n<p>Why was Yaakov and the family permitted to stay?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>One reason given is that Par'o did not allow them to leave. Note that when they wanted to bury Ya'akov in <em>Mearas Hamachpelah</em>, Yosef had to request permission to do so and push hard. As Rashi says in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8245#v=5&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vay'chi 50:5</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>as he adjured you</strong>: But were it not for the oath, I would not permit you [to go]. He (Pharaoh) was afraid to tell him (Joseph) to transgress the oath, however, lest he say, “If so, I will transgress the oath that I swore to you that I would not reveal that I understand the holy tongue (Hebrew) in addition to seventy languages of the nations of the world, but you do not understand it (Hebrew),” as is found in Tractate Sotah (36b).</p>\n\n<p>Also, they had to leave their families behind in Egypt in order to ensure that they would return.</p>\n\n<p>This implies that if he was reluctant to let them leave after Yaakov died, he would have been even more reluctant to let them leave (and give up his hold on Yosef) while Yaakov was alive (and possibly holding off the return of the remaining five years of the famine).</p>\n\n<p>Also see below where I point out that Hashem had said that Yaakov would die in Mitzraim with Yosef to tend him and would be brought back to Canaan.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, they did not dare try to take Yosef out even to be buried.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8245#v=26&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vay'chi 50:26</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Joseph died at the age of one hundred ten years, and they embalmed\n  him and he was placed into the coffin in Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also Hashem had told Yaakov that he would die in Mitzrayim, so they could not go back earlier.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8241#showrashi=true&v=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayigash 46:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up, and\n  Joseph will place his hand on your eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>and I will also bring you up:</strong> He promised him (Jacob) that he would be\n  interred in the [Holy] Land. — [from Yerushalmi Sotah 1:10]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once conditions started turning bad, there are several reasons given for not leaving.</p>\n\n<p>During the days of the Soviet Union, Jews were persecuted but were treated as traitors if they tried to leave. People writing about the parshah would use this as an analogy to the condition of the Jews especially within the <em>Student Struggle for Soviet Jewy</em> (SSSJ). Par'o did not want the Jews but he also did not want to expel them. That is why he enslaved them, and slaves were forbidden to run away from their master. Par'o owned the Jewish slaves. They were not owned by individual masters as Yosef had been owned by Potifar.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason is that by the time the Jews could have left, they had increased so greatly that they could no longer travel as a family (by natural means) and make the trek. It was difficult for the family of 70 to actually get to Egypt and they would not have made it had Yosef not sent wagons and supplies for the trip <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8240/jewish/Chapter-45.htm#v=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayigash 45:19</a> and guaranteed support once they had arrived in Egypt. See <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8242/jewish/Chapter-47.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayigash 47</a></p>\n\n<p>As we see in the discussions about the Valley of the Bones <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8240/jewish/Chapter-45.htm#v=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 37:1</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>and that was full of bones:</strong> Our Rabbis said (Sanh. 92b) that they were of the tribe of Ephraim, who left Egypt before the end [of the exile], and the people of Gath who were born in the land slew them, as is stated in (I) Chronicles (7:20ff.)</p>\n\n<p>When a band of Ephraim fought their way out, they all died.</p>\n\n<p>@DanF brought up the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8210#v=13&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>bris bain habesorim</em></a> which decreed 400 years of oppression.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And He said to Abram, \"You shall surely know that your seed will be\n  strangers in a land that is not theirs, and they will enslave them and\n  oppress them, for four hundred years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to those who say that this is counted from the birth of Yitzchak, we see that the troubles in Canaan (such as with Avimelech and the Pelishtim) were counted in this way. Thus, it would not necessarily be a reason <strong>for the Bnai Yisrael</strong> to decide to stay in Egypt. Additionally, it would not be up to them to decide matters on the basis of this prophecy. Note that Yaakov did not go to Egypt in the first place without having gotten permission from Hashem that this was the right step. As a result, I am not including it in the explanation as to why they did not leave Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>While this may have been part of the underlying reason why Hashem set up matters in this way, it was not the reason that the Bnai Yisrael reacted to events they were living through. The reasons that I gave were the outside and visible events that kept them in Egypt.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I would like to suggest a different answer. </p>\n\n<p>-- It would seem clear to me that Yaakov knew through prophecy not to go back to Eretz Yisrael as it is stated explicitly in 46:3-4 \"And He [Hashem] said 'I am the G-d - G-d of your father. Have no fear of descending to Egypt, for I shall establish you as a great nation there. I shall descend with you to Egypt, and I shall also surely bring you up; and Yosef shall place his hand on your eyes.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hashem is telling Yaakov clearly that His plan is for the family to move down to Egypt and to dwell there, and they will stay long enough that they will be a \"great nation\". Seemingly the original 70 that went down to Goshen would not classify as a \"great nation\", so it must be that they stay long enough in Egypt to become a great nation. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore it is clear that were Yaakov to leave Egypt directly after the 5 years of famine, it would (seemingly) not allow for the possibility for Yosef to be the one who \"place his hand on your eyes\" (I am willing to concede that Yosef could travel to Yaakov death bed in E'Y to be present to do that, but the implication of the verses there is that this would take place in Egypt.)</p>\n\n<p>Also it seems clear from the commentators on this verse (Ibn Ezra, Or Hachaim) explain that Hashem came to assuage Yaakov's concern that he would be buried in Egypt, and not in E'Y. Hashem assures Yaakov that both Yosef would outlive him (i.e. because he is present at Yaakov's death) but that he would be buried in E'Y. This implies that he knew he would be in Egypt longer than the years of the famine.</p>\n\n<p>-- Along the same lines (as previously mentioned by others in comments) Yaakov knew of the Bris Bein Habesarim which decreed living in Egypt for longer than the famine. (Although according this understanding why does Yosef argue that they should move because of the famine? Shouldn't they move because it had been decreed that they <em>have</em> to be there?)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are several possibilities.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>R. Saadya Gaon doesn’t list the prohibition for an individual to dwell in Egypt in his listing of the 613 precepts, but only a proscription of a monarch to send people there as implied by the verse “He shall not return the nation to Egypt”  (Deuteronomy 17: 16) (negative commandment: 235).  This might have suggested that he held that there was no prohibition on the individual.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המלך אל ישיב עם. ואל ירבה סוסים. ונשים. וממונים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, assuming that neither Ya'akov nor his children were considered kings, there prohibition wouldn't apply to them. (Whether Yosef would have violated the prohibition in bringing them, is a separate question.</p>\n\n<p>Cf. R. Yeroham Fischel Perlow, however, who gives a variant explanation of Rassag in his commentary there.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>Ritva (Yoma 38b) suggests that the prohibition does not apply during the exile. It could be argued that when B'nei Yisrael, Ya'akov and his sons, were in Egypt, it was by definition a period of exile, and hence, there was no prohibition.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many Rishonim, such as R. Mordekhai b. Hillel (Commentary to the end of 8th chapter of Yevamot) rule that the prohibition only applies during the time that the Egyptians behaved particularly inappropriately. Accordingly, we could suggest the when they first came to Egypt, the locals hadn't reached this level of behaviour. A variation on this would suggest that since the prohibition was only meant to distance themselves from Egyptian behaviour, they were fine while living in their isolated enclave of Goshen.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Talmud (Berakhot 8a) asks how people live long lives in Babylonia. After all, the verse (Deut. 11:21) speaks of lengthening one's days specifically in the land of Israel. It answers, that they stay long in the Synagogue. Evidently, a synagogue is considered the land of Israel. Since the Midrash (cited by Rashi to Genesis 46:28) claims that Yehuda founded a Yeshiva, for them, perhaps they founded a synagogue as well, and were therefore considered to be in Israel.</p></li>\n<li><p>Perhaps, they held like <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37805/8775\">Rambam, Rabbenu Avraham b. HaRambam, Meiri</a>, et al. that the forefathers did not observe the mitsvot.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Ideally, please also include the section of the Shulchan Arukh on which the Gra is commenting when he says it, and please include the full quote.

However, Rav Ovadiah Hadaya (Yaskil Avdi 8:YD:5:3) disagrees, and permits lottery tickets even for Sephardim, by arguing that it does not fall under the general rule of asmachta, since the company paying out the money always intends to do so. Rabbi Yosef counters by saying that the proceeds from each individual ticket are stolen, see there for details.

We were chosen to do this job. Non-Jews aren't obligated to follow the Torah. When we see non-Jews eating non-kosher we don't view that as an abomination. </p>\n\n<p>There are, however, basic ideas that we believe all humans should follow.

There are many statements in the Torah attesting to the great love of converts. However, we cannot initiate this since they would convert at a faster pace than they are really holding by doing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>the truth is always out there for the true truth seeker see as the Chovot Halevavot writes (<a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=388#ch6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gate 7 ch.6</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the Creator rebukes and humiliates him on his evil ways and\n  deeds, whether through the prophet of his generation, if he lives in\n  the era of prophecy, or from the Torah of G-d, or through a Rabbi who\n  preaches to him on the service of G-d.

If someone doesn't have <em>the truth</em> and you love them, you share it with them. They try to convert others to their faith. They call it <em>Witnessing</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Jewish way is learned from Hillel HaZaken from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.82?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 31a</a>. Interestingly enough, the conversation is with a non-Jew who comes to him to convert <em>if Hillel can teach the whole Torah to him while the non-Jew is standing on one foot.</em></p>\n\n<p>Hillel's response was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דעלך סני לחברך לא תעביד זו היא כל התורה כולה ואידך פירושה הוא זיל גמור.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor, that is the\n  entire Torah, the rest is just commentary, now go and study.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We do not seek to convert everyone to our faith, just as we do not desire others to attempt to convert us from our faith. The Torah values diversity. This follows <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2516927/jewish/Shabbos-Parshas-Vayeitze-11th-Day-of-Kislev-5743-1982.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an explanation of the Lubavitcher Rebbe to comments from Rashi of Bereshit 30:35-37</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rashi’s comment that the streaks (b’rudim) were white can be understood in reference to an earlier verse. When Ya’akov peeled stripes from the wooden sticks (30:37) he “uncovered the white layer underneath.” When the animals saw these sticks and mated, the offsprings had markings instead of uniform coloring like their parents -similar to the sticks which also had various colors, the color of the bark and the revealed white of the fresh wood underneath. Rashi therefore derives that the streaks were white, since they resulted from the animals’ gazing at the sticks, which also contained white (cf. 30:35 and Rashi there).</p>\n  \n  <p>We have often discussed the fact that Rashi’s commentary, although it\n  primarily addresses the simple meaning of the verse, alludes to deep,\n  esoteric concepts in Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>As previously mentioned, “b’rudim” represents the world of “Tikkun,”\n  which is characterized by the presence of differing entities which\n  nevertheless coexist and intertwine together. This aspect is compared\n  to a multi-colored object, the beauty of which derives from the\n  combination and proximity of the many colors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is like is found in regard to the coat of Yosef (Bereshit 37:3). What distinguished his coat was that it contained many colors.</p>\n\n<p>And so, in keeping with that idea, Jews do not seek to convert non-Jews to Judaism. Like with any healthy ecosystem, our diversity is the way of life.</p>\n\n\n",

(This is an oversimplication, but that's the gist of it.)</p>\n\n<p>What if one was a Techilaso bePeshi'ah veSofo beOnes? That is: he was negligent, and because of his negligence he was unable to daven. Had he not been negligent he would have been able to. </p>\n\n<p>For instance: Someone stayed up too late one night, knowing that he would not be able to wake up in time to say Shemoneh Esreh within the Zman. He was negligent, but ultimately it was the fact that he was asleep that he missed Shacharis. Is he able to make it up? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See SA OC 108, 8, and specially Mishna Berura sk 23:</p>\n\n<p>Mishna Berura sk 23:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אותו עסק - ואפילו אם העסק הוא מהדברים הנזכרים בסימן רל\"ב לאיסור משהגיע זמן תפלה והוא התחיל בעסק זה באיסור כיון שלא ביטל התפלה בשאט נפש אלא היה סבור להתפלל אחר שיגמור העסק ושכח אח\"כ:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A man was in at the time of Mincha,  but there was a  lot of time until the end of Mincha's time. He began an activity forbidden at this hours  (e. g.  one of the activities enumerated in siman 232, 2, for instance to go to the hairdresser) and he finished this activity early,  he has time to pray Mincha,  but he forgot.   Mishna Berura writes clearly that he is Chayav tashlumim. This case is very close to your question. He began by a peshia,  transgressing a seyag derabanan for Mincha,  but the real cause of Mincha was an oversight not linked to the previous transgression. </p>\n\n<p>The case described at the end of the question is perhaps more problematic. See the Beur Halacha,  BH said that if the consequence is probable,  despite the fact that the consequence is one of the enumerated in the אונס,  he cannot make tashlumim because he is poshea.      (I think for instance that this applies to  drunk people,  when they know when they start to drink  that they probably will be shikor.  Although that shikor is Chayav tashlumim,  here this man is poshea).     Eliahu Rabba says that he is only shogeg and can pray tashlumim.  Beur Halacha concluded that he needs to pray tashlumim with a condition: if he is exempt from tashlumim this Tefila will be a nedava. </p>\n\n<p>Thus in the case of a man who stays up late  too,  and knows that he is unable to stand up at time.  this is a safek for tashlumim and he needs to pray tashlumim with a Tnay</p>\n\n\n",

It is presumably possible to \"convert\" to their religion as their main mode of operation is to lure Jews into their churches, but that won't have any standing with most Jews.  A conversion to Judaism not overseen by torah-observant Jews isn't valid, and by definition their leaders aren't observing the torah.  If they \"convert\" a gentile he's therefore still a gentile, and if they \"convert\" a Jew he's still a Jew (who has gone off the path) (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/34741/472\">here</a> for example).</p>\n<p>See this <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/sp/ph/48918997.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">article from Aish HaTorah</a> about these groups:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No matter how disconnected a Jew may be from Judaism, he is still likely to be appalled by the idea of worshipping Jesus.

They invented \"Jews for Jesus,\" which uses a whole lexicon of Jewish-sounding buzz words in order to make Jesus more palatable to Jews.

Could someone please explain me what this (the light and it's hiding within Torah) means? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, this is discussed in Reshimot Shiurim of Rav Soloveitchik to Berakhot 34a. He writes that the \"hidden light\" is the light of knowledge that is found in the Torah and will be fully expressed in the future epoch. Particularly, it refers to an understanding of the underlying philosophy of Halakha.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ו<strong>הסוד שבההלכה היא השקפת העולם של ההלכה</strong> - והיא בחינת הנשמה של התורה. וזהו באמת הענין של סתרי תורה. וזהו בחינת יינה של תורה דיין נמשל לסוד...ואילו גוף ההלכות נמשלו ללחם ובשר וכמש\"כ הרמב\"ם (פ\"ד מהל' יסודי התורה הי\"ג)...וכתיב \"ולחם לבב אנוש יסעד\" דיהודי צריך לדעת גופן של ההלכות כדי לחיות - כמו שלחם היא מצרכי החיים הבסיסים. אמנם לגבי יין כתיב \"יין ישמח לבב אנוש\" - ש<strong>אם יודעים הסודות והשקפת העולם של התורה</strong> זה מביא אדם לידי שמחה, ש<strong>ע\"י הבנת השקפת התורה יודע איך לחיות ולהתנהג. שהתורה מדריכתו בכל צעד</strong>...וי\"ל דזהו כוונת ריב\"ל דפירש שעין לא ראתה וכו' דהיינו השכר שבעוה\"ב וזהו יין המשומר מששת ימי בראשית - דיין המשומר היינו סודות התורה, <strong>וזהו בחינת האור הגנוז מששת ימי בראשית, דהכוונה היא לאור הדעת, ויתגלה לעת\"ל בעוה\"ב</strong> וכדכתיב \"כי מלאה כל הארץ דעה את ה' כמים לים מכסים\", <strong>דבעוה\"ז יש רק גילוי ניצוצות של האור הגנוז ולעת\"ל יתגלה האור עצמו</strong> - דיתגלה כל סודות וחכמת התורה. </p>\n  \n  <p>The secret of halakha is the weltanschauung of halakha...if one knows the secrets and outlooks of the Torah...through understanding the outlook of the Torah, one knows how to live and behave, for the Torah directs him at each step...And this is the characteristic of the light hidden from the six days of creation; that the intent is to the light of knowledge, and it will be revealed in the future in the future epoch...For in this world, there is only a revelation of sparks of the hidden light, but in the future, the light itself will be revealed.

Isaiah Horowitz, writes in his <em>Sh'nei Luhot Hab'rit</em> (Toldot Adam: Beit Hokhmah; second: 189) that the Oral Law is encoded in the Written Law. This is the intent of hidden light (ibid 191):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמרומז כל תורה שבעל פה בתורה שבכתב...וזהו ענין אור הגנוז בחמשה חומשי תורה </p>\n  \n  <p>That the entire Oral Law is hinted to in the Written Law...And this is the idea of the light which is hidden in the Pentateuch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Yitzchak was very careful that Ya'akov not marry a Canaanite and as we know he married Leah and Rachel bnos Lavan ben Besuel ben Nachor. The pasuk in VaYeishev specifically says that Yehudah married the daughter of Shua the Canaanite. VaYigash says that Shimon's youngest son Shaul was a son of a Canaanitess.</p>\n<p>Sefer HaYashar to Parshas VaYeishev (Chapter 45) says as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Then Re'uven ben Ya'akov went towards Timnas and took Elioram bas Evi the Canaanite for a wife for himself and he came to her. She conceived and Elioram wife of Re'uven bore him Chanoch and Pallu and Chetzron and Karmi four sons. And Shimon his brother had taken Dinah his sister for a wife and she bore him Yemuel and Yamin and Ohad and Tzochar five sons. And after that, Shimon had come to Bonah the Canaanite that is Bonah who Shimon had captured from the city of Shechem. Bonah was before Dinah and she attended to her and Shimon came to her and she bore him Shaul. And Yehudah had gone at that time to Adulam and he turned to an Adullamite man and his name was Chirah.

Indeed, the very notion is so inconceivable that that the Talmud interprets Genesis (38:2) as not implying that Judah married a Canaanite wife:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכתיב וירא שם יהודה בת איש כנעני. מאי כנעני? אילימא כנעני ממש - אפשר בא אברהם והזהיר את יצחק, בא יצחק והזהיר את יעקב, ויהודה אזיל ונסיב? אלא אמר רבי שמעון בן לקיש: בת גברא תגרא </p>\n  \n  <p>For it is written 'And there Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man'. What is meant by Canaanite? If you say an actual Canaanite, is it possible that Abraham warned Isaac, and Isaac warned Jacob [not to marry Canaanites] and Judah went and marries [one]? Rather Said R. Simon ben Lakish, [it means that] she was the daughter of a merchant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Paltiel_(Paltiel_of_Falaise)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Hayyim Paltiel</a> (Genesis 37:35) even according to the opinion that the tribes married Canaanites, it is possible that they weren't ethnic Canaanites, but only resident there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' יהודא אמר כנעניות היו. וצ\"ע דסוף פרק אילו עוברין אמרינן בת איש כנעני אילימא בת כנעני ממש, אי אפשר, בא אברהם והזהיר בא יעקב והזהיר ויהודה נשא כנענית, ואילו הכא אמרינן השבטים נשאו כנעניות... ושמא י\"ל דלא היו אלא מארץ כנען </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the above understanding the the brothers didnt marry Canaanites, Simon seems to be the exception that proves the rule. As Radak writes in Genesis (38:2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בת איש כנעני ...וכנעני כתרגומו סוחר היה משאר האומות והתגורר שם, כי בני יעקב היו נזהרים מלהתחתן עם בנות כנען כמו האבות, כי שמעון שלקח אשה מבנות כנען זכרו לגנאי והפרידו מאחיו ואמר ושאול בן הכנענית:</p>\n  \n  <p>The daughter of a Canaanite...And 'Canaanite' is identical in meaning to its Targumic explanation; that he was a merchant from a different nation [other than Canaan]. For Simon who took a wife from the daughters of Canaan, was mentioned negatively, and [listed] separately from his brothers, and it is said 'and Saul the son of the Canaanite'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also Ramban to Genesis (38:2).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R' Moshe Luriah addresses this question following the to Ariz\"L tradition (a little Kabbalic though).</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There are two sorts of \"bad\" - a \"not so bad\" bad and \"really bad\" bad.

This idea is already found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.31.52?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Midrash_Tanchuma_Buber%2C_Devarim.3.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma Devarim 3:1</a> regarding David and Yoav's attempt at conquering the Arameans - they were blocked from crossing into Aram by claims that they were defying the agreement set by Yaakov and Lavan. Therefore, Yaakov didn't really have much of a choice.</p>\n<p>This explanation works particularly well with the p'shat reading of Beresheet (where Yehudah and Shimon marry Canaanite women), but still a bit problematic with Sefer Hayashar because Binyamin marries a woman from Aram Tzova. While Aram Tzova (Aleppo) is south of Aram Naharaim, it's still significantly north of the Gilad.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> The older but apocryphal Book of Jubilees however, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Book_of_Jubilees.34.27-33?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">claims</a> that besides for Yehudah, Shimon and Yosef, all of the brothers took Aramean wives, and Shimon later \"repented\" and took an Aramean second wife (Yosef didn't need to repent because Asnat was Egyptian).</p>\n\n\n",

I am separating out different reasons, each of which is enough to make it wrong to attend. Since I am writing this edit on Purim, I will point out that even if it is kosher, it is like the Jews attending the celebration of Achashveros.</p>\n\n<p>As explained in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/99/orthodox-visits-to-other-denomination-sanctuaries/17964#17964\">Orthodox Visits to Other Denomination Sanctuaries</a> Rav Moshe is cited as having stated that one cannot go to a wedding in a Reform Temple (especially if it takes place in the <em>sanctuary</em> as opposed to a social hall). This applies even if this is supposed to be between two Jews. Additionally, if the person <em>officiating</em> is a reform or Conservative <em>rabbi</em> it would probably not be valid either (even if not in a Reform venue as sapecified in the question).</p>\n\n<p>The second part (Reform conversion) can be addressed by pointing out that the <em>convert</em> is not Jewish and this is like going to any other intermarriage of a Jew and a nonJew. An example of this question is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12713/intermarriage-attendance\">Intermarriage Attendance</a> as well as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/37939/invited-to-engagement-of-girl-intending-to-marry-out-attend-not-attend\">Invited to Engagement of Girl intending to marry out: Attend/Not-attend?</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These point out that even an \"engagement party\" should not be attended because it appears as if one is <em>accepting</em> such a \"marriage\".

Inviting the couple as such eo ipso\n  acknowledges and accepts their illicit marriage. Under no\n  circumstances may this acceptance be forthcoming. Let us not delude\n  ourselves into thinking that we would be simply maintaining relations\n  for purposes of kiruv.

According to the aforementioned lecture, even up to much more recently significant numbers of people knew gemara, rashi and tosfos off by heart. <strong>How?</strong> <br>\nI find it very difficult to accept that everyone had incredible memories in those days... </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I would suggest two points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Necessity is the mother of invention.</strong> We have <em>gemara</em> and <em>meforshim</em> written down, printed, and readily available, and even readily searchable via online repositories; so we feel less pressure to learn them by heart. In contrast, IIRC, in the <em>shtetlach</em> in Europe there was frequently only a single <em>Shas</em> in the entire town; under those circumstances it was either memorize all of <em>masechta Sanhedrin</em> when you had it, or waste time conducting a house-to-house search each time you wanted to look something up. Presumably, <em>sefarim</em> were more expensive and time-consuming to produce the further back in history we go, and thus were less available.</p>\n<p>A similar example is the ability of Yemenite children to learn to read from the Torah sideways and upside-down, owing to the fact that there was only one <em>chumash</em> available for the children.</p>\n<p><em>L'havdil</em>, I can do long division on paper with some difficulty, but I never mastered extracting square roots by hand. And yet the techniques for doing so were taught and mastered by multiple generations of students — exceptional and average — before calculators, computers and mobile phones became commonplace. The ability to learn by heart is no different.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>We live in an age of distractions.</strong> The <em>gemara</em> describes how Rabbi Akiva came home after twelve years, and turned around and left upon hearing his wife say that he should stay to learn for another twelve years. Would it have been so bad for him to go in, say hello to his wife, maybe sit down to a cup of tea? But we, for whom a cellphone-free 3-3.5 hour <em>seder</em> is not a trivial undertaking, cannot appreciate the magnitude of a 5-minute interruption between two 12-year <em>sedarim</em>.</p>\n<p>Previous generations, which were not burdened by such distractions, were able to memorize large parts of the Torah, because a) the longer you focus on a single concept, the more deeply embedded it becomes in your memory, and b) even focusing on a group of related concepts for a longer time means that each concept reinforces the others in memory.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

However, he emphasizes that he is equally entitled to recite the traditional formula that references our forefathers, (and he seems to prefer this latter option):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אבל שהוצאתנו ממצרים או שעשית נסים לאבותינו אם רצית לשנות ולומר שהוצאת את ישראל ממצרים ושעשית נסים עם ישראל אמור. ואם לא שנית אין בכך הפסד כלום</strong> מאחר שנכנסת תחת כנפי השכינה ונלוית אליו <strong>אין כאן הפרש בינינו ובינך. וכל הנסים שנעשו כאלו לנו ולך נעשו</strong>. הרי הוא אומר בישעיה ואל יאמר בן הנכר הנלוה אל ה' לאמר הבדל הבדילני /יבדילני/ ה' מעל עמו וגו', אין שום הפרש כלל בינינו ובינך לכל דבר. ודאי יש לך לברך אשר בחר בנו ואשר נתן לנו ואשר הנחילנו ואשר הבדילנו. ש<strong>כבר בחר בך הבורא יתעלה והבדילך מן האומות ונתן לך התורה שהתורה לנו ולגרים שנ' הקהל חוקה אחת לכם ולגר הגר חוקת עולם לדורותיכם ככם כגר יהיה לפני י\"י</strong>. תורה אחת ומשפט אחד יהיה לכם ולגר הגר אתכם. ודע כי אבותינו שיצאו ממצרים רובם עובדי ע\"ז היו במצרים נתערבו בגוים ולמדו מעשיהם עד ששלח הקדוש ברוך הוא משה רבינו ע\"ה רבן של כל הנביאים והבדילנו מן העמים והכניסנו תחת כנפי השכינה לנו ולכל הגרים ושם לכולנו חוקה אחת. ואל יהא יחוסך קל בעיניך אם אנו מתיחסים לאברהם יצחק ויעקב אתה מתיחס למי שאמר והיה העולם. וכך מפורש בישעיה זה יאמר לי\"י אני וזה יקרא בשם יעקב וגו'. <strong>וכל מה שאמרנו לך בענין הברכות שלא תשנה</strong> כבר ראיה לזה ממסכת בכוריםו תמן תנינן הגר מביא ואינו קורא שאינו יכול לומר אשר נשבע י\"י לאבותינו לתת לנו. וכשהוא מתפלל בינו לבין עצמו אומר אלהינו ואלהי אבות ישראל. וכשהוא מתפלל בבית הכנסת אומר אלהינו ואלהי אבותינוז זהו סתם משנה. והיא לר' מאיר ואינה הלכהח אלא כמו שנתפרש בירושלמי תמן אמרינן תני בשם ר' יהודה גר עצמו מביא וקורא מאי טעמיה כי אב המון גוים נתתיך לשעבר היית אבי לאברהם מיכאן ואילך אב לכל הבריות. ר' יהושע בן לוי אמר הלכה כר' יהודה. אתא עובדא קמיה דר' אבהו והורי כר' יהודה. הנה נתברר לך שיש לך לומר אשר נשבע י\"י לאבותינו לתת לנו. ושאברהם אב לך ולנו ולכל הצדיקים ללכת בדרכיו והוא הדין לשאר הברכות והתפלות שלא תשנה כלום. וכתב משה ב\"ר מימון זצ\"ליב </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This responsum is referenced by the Elya Rabba (676:2) who seems to rule accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>However, R. Saadiah Halevi Mirkado (18th-19th cent.) notes in his Neve Tzedek (Hilkhot Megillah v'Hannukah 3:4) that Rambam rules in Hilkhot Ma'aser Sheni (11:17) that converts cannot recite the declaration on <em>ma'aser</em>, since it contains the words \"the land that you gave to our forefathers\". R. Mirkado, therefore seems to prefer that a convert similarly recite the variant formula for Hannuka candles.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that even the Kitsur Shulhan Arukh (139:12) who prefers the variant formula concedes that if the traditional formula is recited, that is sufficient.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גר אומר שעשה נסים לישראל ואם אמר לאבותינו יצא </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Excellent question, the Kitsur Shulchan Aruch here addresses a point which is not apparent in Shulchan Aruch in hilchot Chanuka. </p>\n\n<p>See Mishna Bikkurim 1, 4.  This Mishna says that a convert cannot read mikra  Bikkurim because he cannot say \"the country which the Lord swore to our fathers to give us\"  (Deuteronomy 26, 3). When a convert prays alone,  he says \"the G-d of the fathers of Israel\" . When he prays in synagogue for the congregation,  he says \"the G-d of your fathers\". Commentators on the Mishna report that in Talmud of Jerusalem the conclusion follows a Berayta that says that  converts say \"the G-d of our fathers\" and read mikra Bikkurim because the land of Israel was given to Avraham who is the father of converts. Rambam rules as this Jerusalem's Talmud. </p>\n\n<p>But for Vidui maasser it is different. Convert cannot say \"and the land which you have given us,  as you swore to our fathers,  a land that flows with milk and honey.“ (Deuteronomy 26, 15). </p>\n\n<p>Some Rishonim and poskim acharonim see no difference and concluded that convert bless.  But if we want to understand the Rambam we need to understand why in mikra Bikkurim he rules that convert says the verse mentioning the land and the fathers and in Maasser sheni,  he cannot. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=7553&rid=7179\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Meir Itschaki on Rambam Maasser sheni 11, 17</a> writes in name of Rashi on Chumash explains the difference. Rashi points that for the verse of Maasser Sheni the Mishna needs to quote the verse up to \"milk and honey\". The REM on Rashi explains that the mention of \"flows milk...\"  was a swore said to the generation which get out of Egypt. Not to Avraham. In the same way regarding Al Hanisim. The commentators on Rambam report <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1405&st=&pgnum=26&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shut Shaar Efraim 14</a>  with two answers to the contradiction in Rambam (First teruts: for Vidui Maassrot the Vidui contains a prayer, and for a prayer one needs to feel wholly each word. As in some periods people didn't say Gadol Gibbor and Nora in prayer. But for  mikra Bikkurim the recitation is a praise and no problem. BTW the blessing of Sheassa Nissim is also  a prise as mikra Bikkurim and we can understand the  Shut  Harambam quoted by @mevaqesh in which Rambam says that the convert can say laavotenu. Second teruts by the  son of the author: in Bikkurim the point is on the promise to give the land to the whole Israeli nation but in Maassrot) the point is on the personal ownership)   and the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9204&st=&pgnum=123\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shut Shay Lamora 54</a> (the teruts he retained: maasser the accent is on the actual giving of the land. In Bikkurim the accent is on the promise. potentially all descendants of Avraham were able to  receive a part of the land.  But  those who reached Israeli people after the division of the land or who were excluded as the tribe of Levi did not get any part. They are linked to the promise but not to the division. No problem for mikra Bikkurim. Indeed for Vidui Maasser,  we search an actual part.  E. g.  for Leviim Rabbi Yose says that they make Vidui because their ownership of Are Miklat. Second teruts, the gift pointed in Bikkurim is the fruits of the land,  not the land. But in Maasrot the land itself is pointed)  . I hope to find time to explain their  Teruts.  A master piece of the Suggia is the Tosfot Baba Batra 81a with the opinion of Rabenu Tam regarding Zimun for a convert. </p>\n\n<p>(The Peri Megadim Eshel Avraham OC 186, sk 1 addresses the question of convert regarding second blessing of Birkat Hamazon.) </p>\n\n<p>Even if we follow the Rambam,  regarding the miracles of Chanukka,  they were not made at the time of Avraham. So,  possibly, in Al Hanisim we expect that a convert says \"the miracles you made for fathers of Israel\",  not  \"our fathers\". But this pilpul is not inescapable. </p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: The KSA understanding of Sheassa Nissim disagree with the two  terutsim of the Shaar Efraim and the tertsim of the  Shay Lamora in Rambam,  but is congruent to the Teruts of Rabbi Meir Itschaki in Rambam. </p>\n\n\n",

In other words: If you cause an act of commitment then you must commit! </p>\n\n<p>We know that a man, in the natural course of seeking a wife, must of course interact with potential women. However, he should not do anything that will cause too much personal closeness, unless he already intends to be serious about marrying her (even then there are balanced limits).</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Is a man permitted to woo the maiden (/her parents)?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes. A man should try his best to a) Be himself b) Show he is of good character c) Engage in as much talk and activity with a girl as is needed to decide if he wants her as his wife. d) Be a good salesman and show her and convince her of who he really is and that he likes her etc. --- <strong><em>provided that he only displays affections equal to his seriousness about her.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If he does express extra displays of affection, and then rejects the girl, he will probably hurt her heart and have caused inappropriate feelings of closeness between them.</p>\n\n<p>So, on a first date, he will get to know her. He will display courtesy, manners and his own personality. He will not express his undying love. :) </p>\n\n<p>As the relationship escalates. He certainly should tell her what he is truly feeling; namely, that he wants to get serious/ get married to her.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, saying things and giving gifts that would usually be taken as serious bonding attempts of a personal nature, need to be toned down or eliminated until he has decided he wants her as his wife.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, taking her out for ice cream is fine. Giving her a bracelet is inappropriate. (even if not for the sake of kiddushin with witnesses)</p>\n\n<p>I heard in Yeshivah, that the following deal was made for all time between Adam and Eve. They discussed, that in the future, if humankind would go out on dates; who should pay for dinner? Eve remembered that she was told she would give birth in pain. Adam was told that he would work hard for a living. So, they concluded: If the woman has to go through childbirth, the least the guys can do is pay for dinner. :)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, buying ice cream for her is a normal standard by which a guy shows he is a \"mentch\" and has class enough to pick up the tab. (manners, not intimacy). However, buying her a personal gift, would create an attachment that may make her think they owe each other something prematurely.</p>\n\n<p>Comments are similarly judged. He does not say: \"You look beautiful in that dress\". He does say: \"You have good taste in how you match your outfit.\"  He does not say: \"I think you are very attractive.\" He does say: \"You have great energy this evening.\"</p>\n\n<p>That is the dividing line between what wooing is acceptable and what is not. <strong><em>Be normal when scouting a relationship without acting prematurely.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Is it preferable that he (or family) do it?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Torah tells us: Bereishis 29:26 \"And Laban said, \"It is not done so <strong>in our place</strong> to give the younger one before the firstborn.\"</p>\n\n<p>Bereishis 18:8 tells us that the angels ate food when they visited Abrahahm.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains: \"<strong>and they ate</strong>: They appeared to be eating. From here we learn that <strong>a person should not deviate from custom</strong>. (see Gemara Baba Metziah 86b)</p>\n\n<p>The answer to the question of how exactly one should choose to act in shidduchim, depends on the local custom. You need to ask Rabbis, neighbors, and friends, about what is acceptable and proper behavior in your local society. There is no set of Halachos that cover all possible details of these situations. Rather you should know your local custom. Some places have the girl meet in her home. Some want to go out on a date. Some talk on the phone first etc. In some places flowers may be accepted, in others it is not acceptable. etc. In some places, the parents have a lot of involvement before the couple meets. In others, it is up to the couple etc. Everything is according to the Jewish custom of that community and family.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Or should he (and his family) just be himself and not do for her any special favors and let her want to marry him by herself?</strong></p>\n\n<p>He should just be himself, while being his best self. He should do her favors, without doing her \"special\" favors. However, just standing there like a fire hydrant while she \"decides\" to marry him \"by herself\", is ridiculous. What girl would respect such a person? Communication must take place both ways so they both want to marry each other.</p>\n\n<p>Yes he should open doors for her and act with manners and chivalry. If he doesn't plan on continuing this practice, then he should change his mind and continue to do so! :)</p>\n\n<p>What is over doing it?</p>\n\n<p>Bereishis 38:23 \"So Judah said, \"Let her take [them] for herself, <strong>lest we become a laughingstock</strong>. Behold, I sent this kid, but you did not find her.\"</p>\n\n<p>In general, be discreet in matters of one's relationship with a woman. Do what you have to do, but not in a way that the matter causes embarrassment to her or to you (or the family etc.) .</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Should he also inform of his negative traits (which he is not Halochikly obligated to)? (Or should he avoid them to speed up his marriage?)</strong></p>\n\n<p>He should of course ask his Rav advice on what issues he should and shouldn't reveal (even if he is not obligated to reveal them).</p>\n\n<p>The Ben Ish Chai (Niflaim Ma'asecha 71) tells a story of a man who was very desperate, and broke into a widow's home to steal money. He regretted the act, and left her valuables on the table. The next morning, she awoke and went to the Rav to find her a shidduch since she needed a husband to protect her! The Rav suggested the nice young man who happened to (unbeknownst to anyone) be the burglar himself! (The moral of the story was that if you are destined to have money, you will receive it without having to steal it, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yitzchak Zilberstein asks if the chassan should honestly reveal to the kallah that he was the burglar?</p>\n\n<p>He answers that he does not need to reveal it. He proves this from the Urim V'Tumim (Urim 28:3). A Bes Din, does not accept testimony from a biased witness because they cannot be sure the witness isn't twisting the story. However, if the witness has a bias against the defendant that the court is not aware of, he can still testify as long as the witness himself knows he is telling the truth. He need not admit his bias to the court. The burglar knows he sincerely repented in the middle of the act. Therefore, he is allowed to become the widow's husband without telling her he was the burglar.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In addition to the sources you mentioned, Rav Avigdor Miller, in his commentary on Bereishis, explains that the Almighty orchestrated the events by the well to ensure Yaakov would be able to exhibit his strength to Rachel (Bereishis 29:10). Moreover, Hashem beautified Chava for her marriage to Adam HaRishon as He braided her hair and surrounded her with light. Finally, the concept of tosefes kesuba, adding on more monetary value to the marriage contract, may also play a part in 'wooing' a wife. </p>\n\n<p>Although it seems men take on the more active role in winning over a potential partner due to tznius constraints, women certainly strive to make themselves desirable as well, as the Mishna in Taanis (4:8) accounts how many women would tell their potential suitors to look at the family money or lineage in order to woo the men. </p>\n\n<p>There is an important difference between being yourself and putting your best foot forward. Meaning, you might feel like schmoozing about a hobby you enjoy but realize you should be discussing valuable qualities when on a job interview. Does talking about your values and character traits mean you're not being yourself because you would ordinarily talk about sports or cooking (both are great outlets!)? Absolutely not. But when we date with the seriousness of marriage, we need to HONESTLY present ourselves as great as possible by focusing on our positives and what we can bring into a relationship. Sometimes other factors, like money or power, makes forming a relationship more enticing, although both are fleeting in contrast to the individual's qualities. Overdoing it would translate into offering a false sense of who you are. If a man truly wishes he could open the car door for his wife for as long as they live, then it's fair for him to do so during the courting stage when both aim to show their positive side. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>here's something regarding honesty in business dealings from <strong>the Path of the Just <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/mesilat.php?d=14#theft\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ch.11</a>,</strong>   which I think also applies to selling oneself to a prospective wife:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a great distinction in the matter.

But anything which is to conceal its\n  defects is fraud (Onaah) and forbidden. This is a general principle in\n  faithful business dealings</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is \"Siddur Korban Mincha\" a good name for a siddur for women?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have recently found amongst several old siddurim and machzorim in my father's books a siddur korban mincha. Thanks to the folks in chat (<a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/34626261#34626261\" title=\"link to chat\">link to the chat</a>) who were able to help me identify what this book was I could start to google these siddurim and found they are commonly available and definitely aimed at women. Fair enough but the question I could not find an answer to is this:</p>\n\n<p>Why is \"siddur korban mincha\" a good name for a siddur specialized for women?</p>\n\n<p>Please use English sources or provide translations. My lack of Hebrew is how I came to ask this question in the first place. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xlrjy.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xlrjy.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Siddur was written I believe in the 18th century originally Nusach Ashkenaz and aimed at married women, particularly with children. It contained a complete siddur with Yiddish commentary. Around the beginning of the 19th century it was adapted for use by Nusach Sefard (Chasidishe) and Nusach Ar”I (Chabad).</p>\n<p>It was the Chasidim who began the tradition to give this Siddur as a wedding present to the bride. The Siddur contains a Yiddish commentary of both the prayers and Tehillim (Psalms) geared especially to women.</p>\n<p>The reason why it is called Korban Mincha is because according to Jewish law, women have the obligation to pray only once a day, (as opposed to men which is three times a day). Because of the busy schedule of a traditional religious woman living in Eastern Europe, the most common time when women prayed was the afternoon prayer - or the Mincha prayer. Indeed many women today still have the custom to davan Mincha. On Friday afternoon or Erev Yom Tov they will davan Mincha and then light candles.</p>\n<p>The Mincha prayer was instituted in place of the Korban Mincha, the Afternoon offering in the Temple which consisted of grain meal offering (flour, oil and spice). We have the tradition that the Mincha is associated with Yitchak.</p>\n<p>In a poem by the great Argentine Yiddish poet, Kehos Kliger, he mentions that he remembers his mother every afternoon crying into the Korban Mincha, (presumably while she davaned Mincha and recited Psalms for the welfare of her children).</p>\n<p>It is ironic that I once was present at a lecture in Tel Aviv when a Yiddish expert from the Israel Yiddish Society spoke about this poem. He however was totally secular and assumed incorrectly that the Mincha offering was an animal offering and was totally unaware that it actually referred to a Siddur. Consequently he had this image of the author's mother holding a dead animal in her hands and crying. The lecturer then proceeded to propose some poetic symbolism to this image. I spoke to him afterwards and explained that in fact it was referring to a prayer book which was still in use today by thousands of religious women around the world.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is a perfect name for a gift  which is itself a prayer object. More than a siddur for women it a siddur for bride, as we will demonstrate. </p>\n\n<p>Mincha is a synonymous of gifts,  see.  e. g.  when Yaakov said to Esav to take his gift (1),  Korban also see for instance Mishna Nedarim \"korbanot shel melachim\" (2).  In the first page of the siddur they called it Siddur Sivlonot,  Sivlonot (4) is a gift for the bride before the wedding. Additionally Mincha is a sacrifice and today the prayer fulfills the role of sacrifices. </p>\n\n<p>So,  the name Korban Mincha seems well adapted for this siddur which is a gift for the bride before wedding. </p>\n\n<p>The word Sivlonot is perfectly adapted to the gift for the bride. </p>\n\n<p>(1)  Genesis 33, 10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Jacob said, No, I beg you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present (\"מנחתי\"  mincha)  from my hand; for therefore I have seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(2): Mishna Nedarim chapter  2 (folio  20a in Gemara):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>IF ONE VIEWS BY   ....,  BY KORBAN, AND THEN SAYS, I VOWED ONLY BY ROYAL GIFTS',</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(3): Kiddushin  50a, Mishna: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>IF HE BETROTHS TWO WOMEN WITH THE VALUE OF A PERUTAH, OR ONE WOMAN WITH LESS THAN A PERUTAH'S WORTH, EVEN IF HE SUBSEQUENTLY SENDS GIFTS (sivlonot) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a meteg make a difference in meaning?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a book called ספר הקריאה השלם: חלק ג, פיתוחי חותם.  I bought it from my shul and don't have any other chalakim or further information on it.  It's not a kids' book, but it looks like one (pages about the size of Little Midrash but only about 100 of them, big font, colorful picture on the cover).</p>\n<p>On page 79, they talk about metagim, which are short vertical lines that act as secondary accents for the word.  (NOT the sof pasuk lines, although those look the same.  Also NOT the lines that siddurim put to indicate the primary accent on words where that is the last syllable.)  See the blue letters <a href=\"http://www.gentlewisdom.org/qaya/academic/hebrew/Gen_1-7-9_Rabbinic.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, except for the last blue letter of each pasuk which is a sof pasuk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וראוי להזהר לקרות המתגים במקומן הראוי להן כי לפעמים משתנה הענין...וכיון שהמתג מורה על כוונת הענין לפעמים, על כן מחוייב להזהר בקראיתו ולהדגישו</p>\n<p>And it's appropriate to be careful to read the metagim in their proper place because sometimes it changes the meaning of the word...and since the meteg sometimes tells you what the word means, therefore it is required to be careful when reading it and to emphasize it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the middle of the paragraph, where I put the ..., they give examples: זכרה and ויראו.  I am not convinced that those are good examples.  I understand that before some publishers started marking kamatz katan and sheva na the only written difference was the meteg, but the main <em>audible</em> differences are the sheva na vs. nach and kamatz rachav vs. katan/chirik malei vs. chaser.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is there any place where a meteg alone changes the meaning of a word?</li>\n<li>Assuming (1), is their argument correct?  Because metagim sometimes change the meaning, you have to be careful even when they don't?  And conversely, is it less important to be careful about a grammatical rule that never changes the meaning?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are a few examples of how the meteg (or gaʿya) changes the meaning of words are recorded in grammatico-masoretic manuscripts.</p>\n\n<p>Diqduqe hat-Teʿamim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38509&st=&pgnum=72\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baer-Strack §32</a>) notes that י(י)ראו referring to \"fear\" (e.g. וַיִּֽירְאוּ in Gen. 20:8 or וְיִֽרְאוּ in Mic. 7:17) has a gaʿya, while יראו referring to \"sight\" lacks a gaʿya (e.g. וַיִּרְאוּ in Num. 17:24).</p>\n\n<p>Horayat haq-Qore (<a href=\"http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/pageview/6483167\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derenbourg, p. 398</a>) also records that words formed from ירא take gaʿya but words from ראה do not. As another example, the book compares the gaʿya-free word תִּשְׁנוּ (Neh. 13:21) with the root שנה, against the word יִֽשְׁנוּ (Prov. 4:16) which has a gaʿya and derives from the root ישן (<em>contra</em> יִשְׁנוּ in Job 29:22 and וַיִּשְׁנוּ in Kings 18:34).</p>\n\n<p>The primary phonological purpose of the gaʿya is to extend the length of the vowel. For precise reading according to the masoretic signs, the gaʿya should be audible in every situation. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the second kaf hard in שעשה לי כל צרכי?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the daily berakhah for having shoes, שעשה לי כל צרכי, why is the letter kaf pointed with a dagesh kal? I.e., why is the word pronounced tzorki rather than tzorkhi? My sense is that similar forms of the word are pronounced with a soft khaf, e.g., צרכי ציבור.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The vowel symbol kametz is a single symbol which covers two sounds, namely the kametz gadol (which is the usual kametz, in most places we encounter is) and the kametz katon, which is a cholam which is reduced to a kametz katon when the stress shifts to later in the word. The kametz gadol is a long vowel (tenuah gedolah) and the kametz katon is a short vowel (tenuah katanah).</p>\n\n<p>In general, the rule is that a long vowel appears in an open syllable (that is, consonant vowel) and a short vowel appears in a closed syllable (consonant vowel consonant). A sheva nach will close a syllable, and the letters bgdkft, after such a sheva, will be the plosive (hard) kind, with a dagesh, rather that the fricative (soft) kind, without the dagesh.</p>\n\n<p>So, for instance, in the word \nכָּתְבוּ\nthe kametz under the kaf is a kametz gadol, a long vowel, so the sheva under the thav is a sheva na (moving sheva), and the bhet is fricative. This is the usual case, which you would expect.</p>\n\n<p>Certain times, the kametz is the kametz katon. For example, in ch<strong>o</strong>chma, or <strong>o</strong>zni. Many cases we know it to be a kametz katon on the basis of the full form, which has a cholam. In such cases of a short vowel, the syllable needs to be closed, and so the sheva is a sheva nach, and so the bgdkft letter afterwards has a dagesh.</p>\n\n<p>This does not answer your question about tzorchei tzibbur. Assuming the spelling is indeed with a kametz katon vs. a cholam, I would suppose that this is a result of the weirdness of sheva merachef, which is inconsistent. (See <a href=\"http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/b-hebrew/2010-February/041094.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, about birkat vs. birchat, after the short vowel of chirik chaser.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The word is \"tzarki\" rather than \"tzarchi\" because the kaf begins a syllable. And the rule is that the \"beged kefes\" letters (beis, gimmel, dalet, kaf, pey and sav) have a dagesh when they begin a syllable. It seems to me that this rule is widely known, but in my 15 minute search in a beis medrash, I could find no great source. Here's what I did find. (1) ArtScroll's publication of Rashi's commentary on the Chumash, at Numbers 7:89, footnote 10. The author of that footnote gave no source. (2) A Wikipedia article to be found here: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagesh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagesh</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When I got home I looked in the books I've got there. A Grammar For Biblical Hebrew by C.L. Seow contains the following pages 4 to 5. My understanding of his analysis is that in the word Tzarki, the Kaf is medial and preceded by a consonant (that is, a Reish with a Sheva). Therefore, following rule 4.b.iii, the Kaf is a stop; and then following rule 5, it takes a Dagesh.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z9Aj6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z9Aj6.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Introduction to Hebrew by Moshe Greenberg contains the page 13 attached.

I don't know if complete explanation of the Dagesh is really possible, and I had not thought about Tzarchei Tzibor last night when looking at the books, only this morning when you posed the question. Just off the cuff I would say that perhaps the change in the vowel FOLLOWING the Kaf is relevant; and perhaps there's no strong explanation.</p>\n\n<p>In Exodus 15:11, the song Mi Chamocha... Mi Kamocha, the first Kaf has no Dagesh, and the second has a Dagesh, although they appear in exactly the same phrase. I really don't know if that's explicable, 'tho I see now that there's a Mi Yodeya question on this last point from 2014.</p>\n\n<p>-Chaim</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Maggidim (angelic mentors) in Jewish history. How new is it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Did the phenomenon of \"maggidim\" (celestial/angelic mentors) who come to teach a person kabbalistic mysteries and other revelations, but begin with those who studied Lurianic kaballah in the 1500's - 1600's or was it always a part of Jewish history after prophecy ended? We have written records of many kabbalists in the 1500's - 1600's and on,being visited by maggidim such as Rav Yosef Karo of Maggid Meisharim fame and the lesser known Rav Shimshon Pesach of Ostropol as well as many others. Was that the beginning of this phenomenon? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The idea of celestial/angelic mentors beings revealing esoteric knowledge goes back to the Talmud and did not start in the 16th century. For example, Elijah reveals esoteric knowledge. In Talmud, Elijah appears as a supernatural being, associated with other angels. See for example <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.4b.26?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot 4b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It was taught in a Tosefta: Michael, as stated above, in one flight; Gabriel, in two flights; Elijah, in four flights; and the Angel of Death, in eight flights. (Sefaria).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fairly early sources such as Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer (ch. 28) also refer to Elijah as \"the angel of the covenant\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שנקרא אליהו ז\"ל מלאך הברית </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Ta'anit (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.22a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">22a</a>) Elijah reveals which people will merit entry to <em>olam haba</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' ברוקא חוזאה הוה שכיח בשוקא דבי לפט הוה שכיח אליהו גביה א\"ל איכא בהאי שוקא בר עלמא דאתי א\"ל לא אדהכי והכי חזא לההוא גברא דהוה סיים מסאני אוכמי ולא רמי חוטא דתכלתא בגלימיה א\"ל האי בר עלמא דאתי הוא </p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Beroka Ḥoza’a was often found in the market of Bei Lefet, and Elijah the Prophet would often appear to him. Once Rabbi Beroka said to Elijah: Of all the people who come here, is there anyone in this market worthy of the World-to-Come? He said to him: No. In the meantime, Rabbi Beroka saw a man who was wearing black shoes, contrary to Jewish custom, and who did not place the sky-blue, dyed thread of ritual fringes on his garment. Elijah said to Rabbi Beroka: That man is worthy of the World-to-Come. (Translation from Sefaria).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yoma (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.19b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">19b-20a</a>) similarly describes Elijah transmitting esoteric information:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דא\"ל אליהו לרב יהודה אחוה דרב סלא חסידא אמריתו אמאי לא אתי משיח והא האידנא יומא דכיפורי הוא ואבעול כמה בתולתא בנהרדעא אמר ליה הקב\"ה מאי אמר אמר ליה (בראשית ד, ז) לפתח חטאת רובץ ושטן מאי אמר א\"ל שטן ביומא דכיפורי לית ליה רשותא לאסטוני</p>\n  \n  <p>Elijah the Prophet said to Rav Yehuda, brother of Rav Salla Ḥasida: You have said and wondered: Why has the Messiah not come? Why is that surprising? Isn’t today Yom Kippur, and relations were had with several virgins in Neharde’a, as the men and women stayed awake all night and that led to promiscuity? Rav Yehuda said to him: What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, say about those sins committed by the Jewish people? He said: This is what God said: “Sin lies in waiting at the door” (Genesis 4:7), and it is no wonder that men sin. He asked him: And what did Satan the prosecutor say about their sinning? Elijah said to him: Satan, on Yom Kippur, has no license to prosecute (Trans. Sefaria).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If yes, what would that include?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><strong>\"You are not responsible to finish the work (Torah learning), yet you are not allowed to quit (learning) either.\" - R' Tarfon, Pirkei Avos 2:16</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since the Torah is the will and wisdom of Hashem, it has no end. So, you are not obligated to \"finish\" it. You must simply keep learning it. You shall toil in Torah learning day and night constantly. (See The Book of Joshuah 1:8) </p>\n\n<p>So, by definition, Torah includes an infinite amount of wisdom, even though we have known categories to identify its contents, like: Written, Oral, Tanach, Shas, Medrash, Halachah, Hashkafa, Kabbalah, etc. You must simply accomplish as much as you can as often as you can.</p>\n\n<p>The actual Mishnah quoted does not specifically say the \"work\" is \"learning Torah. However, it can be readily seen from context that it is what R' Tarfon means. (There are many mefarshim that explain R' Tarfon's words this way; as specifically referring to the mitzvah of learning Torah.)</p>\n\n<p>The very next words of R' Tarfon in the Mishnah say \"..If you have learned much Torah...\". This context tells us that the whole Mishnah refers to the mitzvah of learning Torah. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in his Peirush HaMishnayos on Avos , The Tosfos Yom Tov, Rav Ovadiah MiBartenura, and the Meleches Shlomo, as well as the Maharal of Prague all interpret Rabbi Tarfon as describing the mitzvah of learning Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in the Yad HaChazakah, Laws of Talmud Torah (in Sefer Mada) 3:6 says about the mitzvah of learning Torah: \"..you are not responsible to finish the work, but you may not stop from it...\". This exactly echos R' Tarfon's wording.</p>\n\n<p>A source in Gemara for this idea can be found in Menachos 99b; a few lines from the bottom of the page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"The House of R' Yishmael taught: The words of Torah should not be upon you like an obligation, but you also may not exempt yourself from them either.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains: \"..Like a man who has a debt and says \"Oh when will I be done with this debt?\" So a man must not say: \"I will learn one chapter and then have fulfilled the obligation.\" for you have no permission to exempt yourself from them (the words of Torah learning).\"</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos in his final explanation of the above words of R' Yishmael's House:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"You do not have to learn the whole Torah. - as it is taught already in the Mishnah (Avos 2:16) \"You are not responsible to finish the work, but you may not quit either.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>In codifying the obligation to study Torah, Rambam never delineates any set components of Torah that a person must study (in the first chapter of Hilchot Talmud Torah, in the rest of that section, or anywhere else that I am aware of).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, we can infer that there is no obligation to learn \"kol haTorah kulah\".</p>\n\n<p>This inference is made by Heshy Zelcer as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Studying the entire Torah: Is there a requirement to study the entire Torah including the Written and Oral Law? Rambam clearly expects one to learn all of the Written and Oral Law early on in his learning process, but he does not seem to formalize this obligation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: Ḥakirah (vol. 2 p. 125)</p>\n\n<p>However, presumably Rambam would agree that one must learn practical halacha (something he places great emphasis on in numerous places, e.g Perush HaMishnayot to Niddah (6:15)), for otherwise, how would one know how to practice halacha.</p>\n\n<p>The Semag, however, implies that besides for the obligation to learn practical halacha, there is an obligation to study each of the 613 mitzvot. In his introduction to the Positive Commandments in Semag, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כבר הקדמתי בספר מצות לא תעשה עניין ספר הזה כי הוא <strong>לידע יסוד המצות על פי הקבלה ולא [כל] חילוקיהם באורך</strong> ויש מצות שאין נוהגים לדורות ולא היו כי אם לפי שעה ואין ראוי למנותם כגון ברכות וקללות דהר גריזים והר עיבל וסיד אבנים גדולות ועשיית המשכן וכיוצא באלו:</p>\n  \n  <p>ויש מהמון [ה]עם שאומרין מה לנו ולמצות סדר קדשים קל וחומר למצות סדר זרעים ולמצות סדר טהרות לדברים שאין נוהגין בזמן הזה, אל יאמר אדם כן כי המצות אשר צוה אדון העולם יש לידע יסודותיהם אף על פי שאינם צריכין עתה כי על כל המצות נצטוינו ולמדתם אותם (דברים יא, יט) ונאמר (דברים כז, א) שמור את כל המצוה אשר אנכי מצוה אתכם וגומר, ונאמר (ויקרא כב, לא) ושמרתם מצותי ועשיתם אותם...וכן אמרו רבותינו (תו\"כ אמור פרק ט ה\"ג) ושמרתם זו המשנה ועשיתם זו העשייה. ויש אדם שילמוד כל ימיו ולא יכול להשיג לדעת מצוה אחת כמאמרה בעל פה מחמת אורך הגמרא ופלפולה...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, there is an obligation to know the basics of all of the mitzvot - even the ones which may not apply to the learner.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted, that like Rambam, I am unaware of Rif, Rosh, Tur, the Shulhan Arukh, (or any other Rishon, for that matter) expressing the Semag's view; or delineating a particular corpus that a person is obligated to master.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, neither Rambam (Hilkhot Talmud Torah 1:1) nor Semag (Assei 12) obligate women in the study of Torah.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you are interested in the term \"kol haTorah kulah\" note that in Hazal it often (always?) means the entire Pentateuch. See for example, the Sifrei to Devarim (Piska 1) that Moshe Rabbenu wrote \"kol haTorah kulah\"; i.e. the Pentateuch.</p>\n\n\n",

An unrelated party appealed the decision, and the same local court rejected his appeal on the grounds that he had no standing. He then appealed again to the High Rabbinical Court, which agreed to take up the case and reversed the lower court's award of a divorce.</p>\n<p>Ms. Jaskoll argues that the high court should never have heard the appeal from the unrelated party:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Asking the rabbinical court to reverse a decision is really only the province of the interested parties — for example, if the man were to come out of his coma, he might have a legitimate basis for filing an appeal. Or if the Tzfat court itself were to have stumbled upon new information — it might have the basis for reopening its own decision.</p>\n<p>However, this appeal was filed by a disinterested party — someone with no connection to the comatose man, the divorced woman, or even the Tzfat Beit Din. Moreover, his petition was rejected immediately by the Tzfat Beit Din for exactly this reason — his lack of standing in the case.</p>\n<p><em>(Indeed, there are areas in Halacha where a disinterested person can get involved. Most notably, the case of “rodef,” where Halacha goes so far as to permit one to kill another party for the sake of saving the life of a third party. Also — on the other end of the life-or-death spectrum — when one accepts a Shabbat gift on behalf of a third party. Both of these examples entail a clear benefit to the third party.

    "content": "# Backlash from ownership of all the land/people?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The simple reading of the Torah text implies that, through Joseph's leadership, in exchange for the grain, Egypt/Pharoah came to own all the land all over the world and the people were indentured to him (except the Jews). Therefore, was our eventual enslavement somehow connected as a backlash to this situation? During the 7 years of famine, Bnei Israel were free when the rest of the population was indentured.  Then the situation flipped when a new Pharaoh came to power. We became enslaved and the Egyptians were free. I'm not exactly sure what my question is, I'm just bothered by the implication that indirectly through Joseph's leadership in saving the world from hunger, Egyptians lost their land and their freedom. Might this have sown resentment toward Bnei Israel, laying the seeds of our eventual slavery in Egypt? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are mistaken in your first sentence. It was the Egyptian people who had become serfs to Par'o and had to sell their land, their goods, and themselves to Par'o.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8242/jewish/Chapter-47.htm#v=15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayigash 47:15</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now the money was depleted from the land of Egypt and from the land of\n  Canaan, and all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, \"Give us food;\n  why should we die in your presence, since the money has been used up?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It was not backlash because of this, but the politics of the \"upper class\" that resented the Bnai Yisrael. That is why Par'o had to act slyly to get everyone to resent the Bnai Yisrael as \"foreigners\" and use the standard tropes found in anti-semitism to get the populace stirred up against them. It is what the left are doing now to try to destroy Israel and the Jews, as with the BDS movement.</p>\n\n<p>There are meforshim who say that מלך חדש means that there was a coup (or an invasion) that took over the country. In order to make sure that there was no revolt, the new king divided the country into different groups. Since Bnai Yisrael were unified, he needed to make them powerless. He also used them as the scapegoats and turn everyone else against them (as is being done by the left nowadays).</p>\n\n<p>for example <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9862#v=8&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 1:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A new king arose over Egypt, who did not know about Joseph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A new king arose: [There is a controversy between] Rav and Samuel. One\n  says: He was really new, and the other one says: His decrees were new.\n  [From Sotah 11a, Exod. Rabbah 1:8] Since the Torah does not say: The\n  king of Egypt died, and a new king arose, it implies that the old king\n  was still alive, only that his policies had changed, and he acted like\n  a new king. [Rashi on Sotah 11a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first causes of the oldest רשעות, anti-semitism, can unfortunately\n  not be definitely established from these first sentences. ויקם מלך חדש\n  by no means designates an ordinary lawful change of dynasty. קום על is\n  always an overthrow by force. So it seems that the old dynasty was\n  overthrown and Egypt fell under the invading power of an invading\n  dynasty. from outside, hence also אשר לא ידע את יוסף, to a fresh\n  native dynasty Joseph would not be unknown. It is quite characteristic\n  that the motive given for the whole subsequent enmity against the Jews\n  is that the new King did not know Joseph. The people did know of him\n  and did notlook askance at the Jewish people growing in it. They\n  considered the jews as benefactors and not as intruders and did not\n  feel their own security threatened by their growth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rav Hirsch says about verse 9</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jew hatred was a political measure which the new dynasty used to\n  strengthen their own position of force and violence</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whenever a tyrant wished to oppress a people, he liked to give them a\n  lower class whom they could oppress and thus be indemnified for his\n  own oppression.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The reason it cannot be formulated as thanks is presumably because the Anshei Keneset Hagadola established a specific order for Shmoneh Esrei (see Megillah 17b) and Thanks was established for the eighteenth blessing not anywhere else.

Sarah was indeed old, and so the \"paraphrase\" by the Angel of the Lord was truthful and relevant, but not unkind to Abraham.

That is, they thought that Joseph was waiting for his father to die before settling scores with his brothers (and in this way Joseph would be avoiding any heartache for his father Jacob).

If we analyze the verses carefully, we will\n  see that the delegation was actually comprised of two separate groups.\n  One group consisted of Jacob’s family: “Joseph’s household, his\n  brothers and his father’s household.” The second group consisted of\n  “the officials of Pharaoh, the senior members of his court and all of\n  Egypt’s dignitaries,” and with them, chariots and horsemen – a very\n  large troop. In other words, it is a small group of Israelites\n  traveling alongside a large Egyptian delegation. A close reading of\n  the verses demonstrates that, following the mourning ceremony in Goren\n  Ha-atad, Jacob’s sons alone proceeded on to bury their father: “His\n  sons did for him as he had instructed them. His sons carried him to\n  the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of\n  Machpelah, the field near Mamre, which Abraham had bought” (50:12-13).</p>\n  \n  <p>What perhaps seemed like a joint procession of Egyptians and\n  Israelites was actually two separate delegations traveling alongside\n  each other for the first leg of the journey. The Torah lingers on the\n  actions of Jacob’s sons, as well as on the large portion of the\n  journey that was dedicated to mourning for Jacob. However, it seems\n  very likely that the Egyptian delegation that set out to bury Jacob\n  actually had an ulterior motive for its journey. While they certainly\n  had great respect for Jacob – they “bewailed him seventy days” (50:3)\n  and embalmed him as they would their most respected figures – the\n  journey seems to have had a different purpose as well.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Egyptian sources, Egypt ruled over the land of Canaan\n  during that period. To maintain their hold on the land, the Egyptians\n  would set up garrisons in various locations. The most important of\n  these garrisons were located in Beit She’an and Gaza, and each year\n  the soldiers manning these garrisons would be replaced with fresh\n  troops. Apparently, this yearly changing of the guard would be\n  accompanied by a large military delegation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Professor Elitzur thus concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To summarize, our parasha describes a large-scale Egyptian military\n  expedition, a yearly operation that involved numerous chariots and\n  horsemen. The purpose of this expedition was to replace the troops\n  manning the Egyptian garrisons throughout Canaan with fresh soldiers\n  from Egypt.</p>\n  \n  <p>Before each group of soldiers went off to their respective garrisons,\n  the delegation stopped at a central location – Goren Ha-atad – for\n  seven days, to mourn the loss of Jacob, the father of the\n  second-in-command of Egypt. After this ceremony, the Egyptian troops\n  all traveled to their designated garrisons, and Jacob’s twelve sons\n  departed for Hebron to bury their father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If everyone could have the afternoon off on a fast day, that would be the ideal, but, of course, in the regular working world it isn't usually possible.

There is no way of getting divorced by Jewish law and she can therefore not remarry. </p>\n\n<p>The Torah's laws are always so fair and balanced. How can it be so cruel and unfair? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The problem is that a beth din used to have teeth, and could force, even by physical force if necessary, a man to give a get. When the rabbinate makes a ruling that a get should be given, a man is compelled to follow them. If the man refuses, this carries consequences. For example, as stated in Ketubot 86A:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל רב כהנא לרב פפא לדידך דאמרת פריעת בעל חוב מצוה אמר לא ניחא לי\n  דאיעביד מצוה מאי א\"ל תנינא במה דברים אמורים במצות לא תעשה אבל במצות\n  עשה כגון שאומרין לו עשה סוכה ואינו עושה לולב ואינו עושה מכין מכין אותו\n  עד שתצא נפשו:</p>\n  \n  <p>Said R. Kahana to R. Papa: According to you, that you said that the\n  repayment of [a debt to] a creditor is a mitzvah,  what is the ruling\n  where [a debtor] said, 'I do not want to perform [this] mitzvah'?  He\n  replied, \"We have learned: [We whip someone 40 lashes] in what case?\n  For [someone who refuses to perform] negative precepts, but in the\n  case of positive precepts, as for instance, when a man is told, 'Make\n  a sukkah'  and he does not make it or, 'Perform the commandment of the\n  lulav',  and he does not perform it he is beaten until his soul\n  departs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Ad sheteitzei nafsho\" does not mean to 'kill', but I lack a source for that. At least take this as an enforcement of the powers that the beth din had to prevent a woman from becoming an aguna. Nowadays the rabbinate lacks such power, which creates a situation in which people can abuse the system with relative impunity. The state has the monopoly on law enforcement, so the rabbi's powers are limited to administrative handling of the get, and can't assign agents to enforce their rulings like they could when the rabbinate was the state's judicial system. The system itself isn't cruel, but the current system  lacks the power to make it work.</p>\n\n<p>It is a myth however that this system is uniquely cruel to women. Men can also be in the position that women refuse the get. According to the israeli rabbinate in 2007 <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/123472\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the ratio of women to men who suffer as 'agunot' is about 50-50</a>. I don't have more recent statistics but it would suprise me if this has shifted drastically</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your question refers to two cases - Aguna and Mesurevet Get. Your question seems to address the cases where she is really stuck through no fault of her own, as when her husband is in a coma, or the classical case where her husband is presumed dead but there is no proof. Mesurevet Get is generally through her own fault and is a very different question, so I suggest removing it from this question. It is really a duplicate of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/66967/759\">Why can't a woman demand a divorce?</a> as @DoubleAA pointed out. I will not specifically address Mesurevet Get in this answer.</p>\n\n<p>As others have pointed out, it is never possible to say definitely why the laws of the Torah are what they are, but we can give suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding a legitimate Aguna, we have to understand why the basic arrangement is as it is, and then why there are no special rules for handling exceptional cases. Many people today look at marriage as simply a formalized bond of love, or something like that, and then they cannot understand why a woman cannot simply dissolve a marriage when she no longer feels the love. Jewish marriage encourages love, obviously, but it is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition. In order to understand Jewish marriage it is important to understand the basic social function of marriage - why marriage is almost universal, what social/anthropological pressures it addresses, and why marriage must be formalized as a social institution.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, marriage involves two aspects. One is a woman guaranteeing her exclusivity to the man, and the other is the man committing to care for her and her children. From the social perspective, everyone else is agreeing to respect her exclusivity to this man, and they are also requiring him to provide for her, and they will enforce this if necessary. This is why marriage must be an official, public ceremony. This is how marriage addresses the very basic social needs of protecting women and providing for them, and of regulating intra-social competition over women. This is also why a women cannot just walk out of a marriage. Her husband has taken on a very serious commitment, basically dedicating his entire life to take care of her, and we cannot expect men to do this if there is no long-term guarantee that she will stay. From the perspective of the society they have told him, \"this woman is yours, and only yours, and you must take care of her for your entire life\", and after that she is his, and no one else has the right to take her away from him. This is why a court cannot decide on their own that a marriage should be dissolved. That would be a gross violation of their commitment here, which says that so long as the husband is keeping his commitments to the best of his ability, they are guaranteeing his wife's exclusivity to him. (This is why a flagrant violation of his responsibilities is really the only time a Beit Din may force him to divorce her.)</p>\n\n<p>If divorce were up to the Beit Din, instead of being up to the husband, that would mean that society basically enslaved the husband, making him care for the woman as long as they want him to (and we see that they will make him care for her even after the marriage) but only giving him access to her as long as they see fit. Hiw wife and his marriage and his family are not his - they all belong to the society, who may take it all away from him whenever they want, but his commitment is absolute. When this happens (as is done today, both in Jewish and non-Jewish courts) men stop marrying, because marriage does not make sense anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Much ink has been spilled on this topic. I suggest you begin by googling \"<a href=\"https://www.google.co.il/search?q=evolutionary%20basis%20marriage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">evolutionary basis marriage</a>\", and explore from there.</p>\n\n<p>As with any formal social institution, marriage is designed to be the best possible arrangement for the majority of cases. There are obviously individual cases where it would be more fair to have different rules, but if we make new rules for each case that means there are no rules at all, and we have destroyed the institution. Therefore, even in the case of a bad marriage we cannot force someone to divorce, because that would mean that the marriage is the responsibility of the court, and not of the husband.</p>\n\n<p>Given all this, you can still expect that in extreme, well defined cases there should be some way to declare the marriage over, for example after the husband is completely incapacitated for some time, or missing and presumed dead, or maybe even where he did not keep up his commitments but still refuses to give a get. I think that answer here is that courts simply cannot be trusted to have any right to take a woman away from her husband, as they will not use this power responsibly. These women are stuck because there is no way to give courts partial power over marriages. Once courts believe they are the protectors and providers of women they forget what marriage is about, and will abuse their power, and decide that they have the authority to destroy any marriage. (If you will look around, you will see that this happened.)</p>\n\n<p>I think that a good, short answer to this question about Agunot is \"Marriage must have clear rules, and cannot depend on the arbitrary feeling of outside parties, and therefore the courts cannot have the authority to nullify a marriage. Even in cases where it is clear that this is hurting someone we still need to hold to the same rules, otherwise marriage loses its function, marriages fall apart, and society falls apart, as you can see happening all around you.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another important consideration is the long-term expectations we want to offer people in their marriage. If someone knows their marriage is only valid as long as its going good, but will be terminated without their consent if something really bad happens to them, then they are hedging their bets the entire marriage. They will not feel truly committed, because they know that their wife is only their as long as everything else is ok. Even though divorce is allowed and marriages are not always permanent, we want people to invest in their marriages as if they were permanent. We encourage them to give it all their strength in thick and in thin. For this to make sense, marriage has to be as permanent as possible, and cannot have a annulment clause specifically for when bad things happen, which is when the guarantees of sticking it through are most important. The risk of being an Aguna in case of disaster is the price for having strong and stable marriage under normal circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>I will suggest another consideration, which applies to many cases in Judaism. Hashem created laws of nature, and gave us the laws of the Torah. Both are immutable, both are very well suited to their purpose, and both create situations where people suffer, and we do not know why. From a religious perspective, just as we appeal to Hashem's control when people suffer from nature, we must also realize the Hand of God when people suffer in Halachic edge case. If a woman cannot marry for health reasons we would say that she should recognize that it is from Hashem. If her husband is in a coma, it is just another way that Hashem arranged the same life challenge for her. Likewise of someone loses their home from a natural disaster, or from a fire which spread because it was Shabbos. (Obviously, the possibility of human agency intervening in the Halachic cases changes how we relate to it.) As long as we can see the value and the logic of the Halacha for the typical cases, and we see why it is needed in general, addressing the unpleasantness of individual cases is not very different from dealing with any other evil and suffering in the world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The OP asks about the \"fairness\" of two cases in Torah Law claiming that they seem \"unfair\":</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A man who refuses to give his wife a get (divorce); for whatever reason.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A woman who never received a divorce from a husband who is still alive, but incapacitated, or his whereabouts and/or living status is unknown. (missing but we do not know if he is in fact dead)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In both cases, Torah law does not have any simple usual way to dissolve the marriage other than waiting until the husband willingly issues a get (bill of divorce). This unfortunately leaves the woman as an \"agunah\" or chained to a (seemingly) dead marriage.</p>\n<p>Of course, the true depths of Hashem's wisdom on any matter is not known to me. However, I feel it is better to present what we do know, since the best partial answer is better than none at all IMHO. People will benefit from an answer that guides us to the proper conclusion for the most part, despite the limitations on human wisdom and understanding.</p>\n<p>Lets start with #1.</p>\n<p>First of all, the assumption that justice and fairness would dictate: \"that a man who refuses to give a get is evil; or that any woman who claims she wants a divorce is certainly allowed to move on with her life\", is absolutely wrong. Actually, common sense dictates that the only true justice in the matter is to simply wait until the husband wants to willingly grant a divorce.</p>\n<p>Please consider, in any other transaction or relationship (besides marriage) between human beings in this world, agreements are considered binding by society. Secular law, which many of us look to as a first sign of the definition for common sense justice, has two laws available (in many countries; not just the USA) for those who break, or want to break, agreements.</p>\n<p>a) Specific performance. This law allows a court to order someone breaking an agreement, to fulfill it anyway even if that party wishes to get on with their life without fulfilling the deal any longer.</p>\n<p>b) Detrimental reliance. A person who breaks an agreement can be sued for heavy damages if the other party suffers by relying on their partner's word to fulfill a deal.</p>\n<p>If two people agree to the sale of a house, and enter a binding mutual contract, we all know that \"justice\" assumes they must complete the deal, and anyone who breaks it (seller or buyer) is obviously in the wrong. We never say that the sudden wish of one party to back out and \"move on with their life\" is ever considered \"fair\" behavior. We have a word for such people: liars and cheaters.</p>\n<p>This is almost always true <strong>even if the party backing out proves it has some new unforeseen loss at stake.</strong> The court says: Tough Luck. You promised. Your partner doesn't have to suffer because you have an issue.</p>\n<p>The Torah describes the marriage bond/agreement in Genesis 2:24:</p>\n<p><strong>\"Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife, and <em>they shall become one flesh</em>.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Now undergoing surgery to willingly become \"one flesh\" with someone is a serious life changing move. Certainly, we understand that such an operation is probably permanent and any attempt at reversing it will be rare, and probably quite exceptional and painful.</p>\n<p>If someone agrees to sell their home, and has received money etc., a secular court would demand that the seller fulfill transferring the deed!</p>\n<p>So why would we think that a woman can simply tell a man after being married for some time, that she simply wishes out and it would be automatic justice to have the man grant it??!! That's ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Since when does a man invest his life, money, and emotion, into a \"one flesh\" transformation, have children etc. only to be told that just because his partner (who promised to be his wife) is now changing her mind, that justice demands he simply accept it? Obviously just the opposite should be true. Justice would demand that no woman can simply dictate that her partner dissolve the status of \"one flesh\" because she is changing her mind. Who gave her the right to break the deal??!</p>\n<p>Now you might say that if we can show the husband is abusing his wife, so that it is obvious she deserves to be released from her obligation to keep the deal, then the court can issue a divorce without him?</p>\n<p>The simple answer here, is a verse in Koheles 3:15 \"...V'HaElokim Y'vakesh es nirdaf\" (\"...and G-d seeks the pursued.\") G-d himself finds out who is the pursuer and who is the pursued. Who is wrong and who is the true victim.</p>\n<p><strong>A marriage is such a complicated state, that it is impossible for fellow humans to be able to know what went on behind closed doors and decide who is right and wrong in a marriage. Only Hashem can do that. Also, they can both be guilty.</strong></p>\n<p>If so, there is no human court that can regularly dissolve a marriage between two people. They just do not know who is at fault and to what extent. They lack the ability to justly deprive a man or woman of their marital bond (especially if there are children involved).</p>\n<p>Now the fact that one side's alleged abuse may be enough to grant a divorce is a safek (doubt of human judgment). The existence of a \"one flesh mutual bond\" between the man and wife is an undisputed fact. (vadai)</p>\n<p>The Talmud throughout often says: \"aino safek motzi midey vadai\". <strong>\"A doubt in judgment cannot remove the status of an undisputed fact.\"</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore, the courts are not empowered to touch the marriage directly. The husband must willingly issue the release.</p>\n<h1>2 What about a missing husband or one in a coma?</h1>\n<p>a) All of the above applies because we cannot deprive a man of his marriage since he may wake up from his coma today or he may walk in with a good excuse for being absent.</p>\n<p>b) A Jewish woman by entering marriage is not just doing so for herself, but is becoming the guardian of the office of the Jewish married woman. It is a public status. She is responsible to uphold the sanctity of the institution of marriage, for the public, even at the price of her own suffering.</p>\n<p>When a woman accepts a ring under the chuppah and becomes \"mekudeshes to a man\" she has willingly accepted that she may only have relations with that man only, for all time, until death or willing divorce occurs. If we were to be able to cancel marriages due to comas etc., we would cause such a weakening of the respect for marriage laws that courts would start tampering with just about any marriage; causing adultery to increase and marriage to become meaningless in society.</p>\n<p>However, the Talmud does record that a husband may grant his wife a conditional divorce when faced with risk of his disappearance. For instance, all the soldiers of the house of King David would regularly issue conditional divorces to their wives, on the eve of war, in case they became MIA. That way, their wives would not become agunahs. (Ketubot 9b)</p>\n<p>We see though, that for whatever reason, (perhaps because of the \"weakening of the respect for marriage laws\"- King David unfortunately was tempted by this very loophole with Batsheva; or simply because people do not feel emotionally good about writing conditional divorces) <strong>people just do not avail themselves of such insurance policies although they are halachically available</strong>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such chained women are no different than any other tragedy that we must rely on G-d to answer with our full faith.</p>\n<p>This entire answer by no means could possibly cover every angle in such a short post. I am aware of other issues. However, this does serve as a firm core basis to approaching the issue of the justice and fairness of Jewish divorce law.</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, learning a profession in order to support oneself is a <em>mitzvah</em>.  Nevertheless, if one sees that his son desires the Torah (נפשו חשקה בתורה) and that he is able to become great in Torah (מוכשר להיות גדול בתורה) then one can apply the teaching of R. Nehorai (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.82a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 82a</a>) who did not teach his son a profession, but rather only Torah.</p></li>\n<li><p>If one is not engaging in secular studies for the purposes of learning a profession, but instead because he wishes to entertain himself (להשתעשע בה) then there is room to forbid this under the rubric of <em>bittul torah</em>.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, was opposed to Jewish lads attending college in the 1950s - despite the fact he attended two universities himself (the University of Berlin and the University of Paris).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the 1950s, a nineteen-year-old student at the Lubavitch yeshiva came for a <em>yechidus</em> to discuss his intention of going to college. More than three decades later, the then middle-aged man related to Rabbi Simon Jacobson the story of the encounter he had that day with the Rebbe.</p>\n<p>\"I told the Rebbe that the reason I wanted to go to college was because I felt I had done my studies in Torah and I wanted to expand my horizons.\" He explained that he intended to remain a Chasid but hoped a secular education and college degree would help prepare him for a future livelihood.</p>\n<p>After the student concluded his presentation, the Rebbe responded, \"Are you asking for an <em>eitzah</em> [advice] or for a <em>bracha</em> [blessing]? The young man, perhaps sensing the response that was coming answered, \"I came in for a blessing.\"</p>\n<p>\"A blessing with advice is always better than one without advice.\" The Rebbe than proceeded to tell him, \"In my opinion, you shouldn't go.  You should continue your studies in yeshiva. You will be <em>matzliach</em> [successful] and you can be a leader in the Jewish community with that.\"</p>\n<p>For the young man, the stakes were sufficiently high and he found it impossible simply to accept the Rebbe's veto of his plan. \"How can the Rebbe tell me that when the Rebbe himself went to college?\"</p>\n<p>\"Precisely because I went to university, I know what it's about. I know the environment, and I think it will have a detrimental effect on you instead of a positive one.\" Seeing that the young man was still unconvinced, the Rebbe tried another track. \"Can you draw a circle?\" he asked.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" the young man answered, presumably perplexed by the question.</p>\n<p>\"Can you draw a perfect circle?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, I can't, not on my own.\"</p>\n<p>\"What would you need to draw a perfect circle?\" the Rebbe pressed.</p>\n<p>\"A compass.\"</p>\n<p>The Rebbe, whose interest in and aptitude for mathematics was well known, continued. \"Tell me the difference between the circle you would draw on your own and the circle you would draw with a compass.\"</p>\n<p>\"The circle I draw on my own won't have a sturdy center around which to draw borders, but the compass's center creates a perfect circle.\"</p>\n<p>The Rebbe then elaborated: \"All knowledge you'll ever learn, every experience you'll have in your life, are the circles. They're not the center. If you don't have a solid center, you'll have jagged circles, incomplete circles, many different circles. I sense that you need that center before you start building your circles.\"</p>\n<p>When the man, then in his early fifties, related this story, he added, \"I didn't listen. I went anyway.\" He started to cry softly. \"And I still don't have a complete circle. I have many circles, this one, that once, incomplete.\"</p>\n<p><em>\"Just because one person goes into a fire and comes out unhurt, doesn't mean that everybody should go into the fire.\"</em></p>\n<p>Telushkin, Joseph. <em>Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History.</em> Harper Wave, 2014. Pages 328-329.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, from the above quotation, we see that the Lubavitcher Rebbe's opinion that Jewish lads should not attend college does not stand within the parameters of halacha, but is rather an opinion of his (because he believed \"college-aged\" youths were not firm enough in their faith and understand to be able to tackle the concepts and teachings that are taught in universities).</p>\n<p>Hope this answers your question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are the halachic issues with self-driving cars that minimize overall damage instead of protecting the passengers?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As self-driving cars are becoming more common, I hear more and more people talking about the benefits when <em>most</em> of the cars on the road are self-driving and programming can optimize traffic flow.  This, in turn, makes me wonder about other things that could be programmed in.  One thing that programmers of self-driving cars (or governments that regulate them) could implement is an algorithm that minimizes overall damage in the case of an accident.  For example, if a self-driving car is about to have a head-on collision with a loaded school bus, the car might avoid the accident by driving off the road, killing its passengers.</p>\n\n<p>A human driver might make the same decision, but I understand that to be the unusual case.  My question is about passengers in self-driving cars who wouldn't, were they driving, make the decision to sacrifice themselves on the spur of the moment.</p>\n\n<p>What halachic issues would face the person who either owns or hires (e.g. through Uber) a self-driving car programmed in this way?  A few aspects of the question seem relevant (there are probably others):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>From the story in Bava Metzia 62b of the two people in the desert with enough water for one, where we learn (per R' Akiva) that the owner of the water bottle has priority, we might conclude that the owner/hirer of a self-driving car has priority and can't give that up.</p></li>\n<li><p>Perhaps the car or its programmer is an \"agent\" for the owner/hirer and perhaps must prioritize that life over others.  (I am not well-versed in the <em>halachot</em> of agency.  I understand that a machine can't be an agent, but maybe the one who programmed it can be.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Because a Jew seems to be <em>allowed</em> to sacrifice himself to save others (citation needed, but consider the military, police, and fire-fighters), we might reason that using such a car is fine so long as the owner/hirer is aware of the programming and \"opts in\".  (Rambam says in Yesodei HaTorah 5 that self-sacrifice isn't allowed, though (h/t DonielF), so maybe there are additional factors.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Because the torah places such a high value on human life, we might reason that driving carries with it higher risk of death but we now have the ability to globally minimize it, so we would be required to use this programming if it's available.  (That is, the torah would have always preferred this but only now can we implement it.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This future isn't that far away.  Have any <em>halachic</em> authorities begun to explore this issue?  What do they say?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why can we do some melachos for eating on Shabbos but not others?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I learned that certain melachos are permissible on Shabbos in the course of eating or for the purposes of eating. For example, the question of borer in light of \"derech achilah\"/\"derech melacha\" is discussed <a href=\"http://halachafortodaycom.blogspot.com/2013/02/archives-hilchos-shabbos-39-melachos_6.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. It seems that certain permissible forms of food preparation, such as making a salad, are also permitted for this reason. (If not--if these were permitted because there is no melacha involved--I would wonder why some stipulate that the salad needs to be made <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=435\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shortly before</a> eating. And, more generally, it seems clear that some of these permitted forms of food preparation, such as peeling vegetables, do involve what would otherwise be considered a melacha.) </p>\n\n<p>If this is the case, and if we are in fact more lenient on many melachos because of derech achila, then why wouldn't cooking on Shabbos be allowed for the same reason? Although it is obvious enough that cooking is stringently prohibited on Shabbos, a secular Jew recently asked me this question, and I didn't know how to answer. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here's my take on it:</p>\n\n<p><em>Borer</em> is the act of sorting (anything, not just food).  <em>Bishul</em> is the act of cooking.  Both are prohibited on shabbos.  Then there's an act called <em>eating</em>, which is (obviously) permitted.</p>\n\n<p>When you \"sort\" food in a permitted way (as @sam mentioned in the comments), then this is no longer considered an act of <em>borer</em>, but rather an act of <em>eating</em>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>Ochel mitoch p'soles</em> (taking food that you <em>want</em> out of whatever you <em>don't</em> want) - because if you want to eat something, you pick it up and eat it.</li>\n<li>For immediate use (or in very close proximity to the meal) - because this shows you're doing it for the sake of eating, not for the sake of having your things sorted.</li>\n<li>B'yad (with your hand - or at least, not a specialized tool) - because eating is done with your hands or simple cutlery; you don't typically eat with specialized tools.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now that the act is one of <em>eating</em>, and you've made it clear you're <em>not</em> interested in the <em>sorting</em> aspect of your actions, it's perfectly permissible.</p>\n\n<p>None of this is true of <em>cooking</em>, though, because the act of cooking is inescapably prohibited on shabbos.  You can't apply the rationale of \"I'm not <em>cooking</em>; I'm just <em>eating</em>\", because you <em>are</em> cooking, even if you're <em>also</em> eating.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A general idea used throughout Shulchan Aruch is that The Torah does not forbid \"derech achilah\". This means that if through the normal act of eating, which is from the point of lifting the food until it is chewed and swallowed, you happen to perform something that can be called a melachah, that is generally not forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, grinding is one of the melachos. While chewing food in the normal act of eating, you are indeed grinding it up. But, since it is \"derech achilah\" the Torah obviously did not forbid that kind of grinding.</p>\n\n<p>Cooking is not \"derech achilah\". One's mouth is not hot so that if you put raw food into it, it will become cooked before you chew and swallow! :)</p>\n\n<p>Since cooking happens outside the actual eating process, it has no aspect that would fall under the permit called \"derech achilah\".</p>\n\n<p>Also, the allowances for various amounts of time before the meal, in preparation of the meal to perform borer and tochein, is allowed because these acts are just considered an \"early form of the soon to be eating process.\" This is opposed to borer or grinding for storage, which obviously cannot be called an early part of the eating process.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is only valid because borer and tochein do take place during eating anyway; so doing some of it early is the same thing. Cooking however, as we said above, does not happen at all during the eating process. see Tur, Beis Yosef, and Shulchan Aruch 321.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, the Pri Megadim in 321 points out that we do not grind spices (like fresh pepper balls) even if done right before eating, because it is not considered a true food, but rather something that prepares the other food for eating.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

Judah commenced [the discussion] by observing, 'How fine are the works of this people! They have made streets, they have built bridges, they have erected baths.' R. Jose was silent. R. Simeon b. Yohai answered and said, 'All that they made they made for themselves; they built market-places, to set harlots in them; baths, to rejuvenate themselves; bridges, to levy tolls for them.' Now, Judah the son of proselytes went and related their talk, which reached the government. They decreed: Judah, who exalted [us], shall be exalted, Jose, who was silent, shall be exiled to Sepphoris; Simeon, who censured, let him be executed.</p>\n  \n  <p>He and his son went and hid themselves in the Beth Hamidrash, [and] his wife brought him bread and a mug of water and they dined.  [But] when the decree became more severe he said to his son, <strong>Women are of unstable temperament: she may be put to the torture and expose us.'</strong>  So they went and hid in a cave.

Johanan said: Words of Torah only remain with him who makes himself like one who is as nothing, as it is said: Wisdom shall be found from nothing.</p>\n  \n  <p>R.

    "content": "# Why would an innocent sotah want to return to her husband?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There should presumably be two likely outcomes to the Sotah ordeal (Bamidbar 5:1-5:31) after drinking the embittering waters:  Either she is guilty and then dies, or she is innocent and lives and goes back to her husband.</p>\n\n<p>What about a third possibility:  She is innocent but does not want to go back to her husband.  If she knows she has never committed adultery, she has just been suspected on little grounds (even circumstantial evidence) for whatever motives by her (seemingly) faithful and loving husband.  He has the Kohen subject her to an ordeal of being publicly embarrassed in front of everyone (at the gate of Nikanor).  He removes the clothing of her upper body and hair, he tires her by having her run around and hold the meal offering of remembrance (jealousies), and he subjects her to more humiliating rituals.  Although the Torah says that she may resume relations with her husband and that they will have healthy children afterwards, do you really think that a woman whose husband just embarrassed her like this would have any respect for her husband anymore and would want to be with her husband?  What is even worse, if the woman resents what her husband did and doesn't want to go back to him, she can't even give him a get.  She is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  She is forced to (re)love her husband who because of a baseless hunch or feeling had her go through the Sotah ordeal.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Note that the husband is overcome by a <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9933#v=30&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"ruach kinah\"</a>. According to some meforshim (from memory) he could be literally insane because of jealousy or he can be overcome by this feeling because of her behavior. We have seen this in our days. The proof that he was wrong is a shock to his system and can turn him around to be on the right track. Consider couples who in modern days go to \"couples therapy\".</p>\n\n<p>Also consider that her behavior was not completely innocent. She allowed herself to be in a \"compromising\" situation with a man even though she was not guilty of adultery. </p>\n\n<p>As we see in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960640/jewish/Sotah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchos Sotah 3:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the process through which a sotah is compelled to drink the\n  bitter water? First the husband comes to the court in his city and\n  tells them: \"I warned my wife [not to enter into privacy] with so and\n  so, and she entered into privacy with him. These are the witnesses who\n  will confirm my statements. She claims not to have committed adultery.\n  I desire to have her drink the bitter water to verify this matter.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fact that she is willing to undergo the ordeal and allow her name to be defamed, means that she sees something that can be redeemed from the situation.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that the husband can have divorced her at any time before taking her to the bais hamikdash. The relationship is not as simplistic as you seem to say.</p>\n\n<p>There are those who say that she can insist that the husband give a get after the sotah procedure has found her innocent.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/tp/i/m/48964791.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah</a> (as an example) points out that at any point in the procedure she can refuse to drink as long as she is willing to forego the kesuvah. Even after the ordeal she can refuse to go back to him. Note that there are other opinions, but this is an example.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Jewish law (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Even_HaEzer.77.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Even Hoezer Ch. 77</a>) every\n  Jewish woman has the right to force her husband to give her a divorce.\n  If she comes to court and declares that she can no longer endure\n  cohabitation with her husband for no reason whatsoever other than the\n  simple fact that she simply doesn't like him any more, and she is\n  willing to forego her ketubah, he must give her a divorce.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the citation uses the term \"right to force\" based on the Rambam that the man must appease her within a certain amount of time or bais din can force him to give a get. That does not have to do with the point being made here and would need to be addressed in a different post.</p>\n\n<p>Meforshim point out that when Chana (the mother of Shmuel Hanavi) was praying, she said that if necessary, she would deliberately put herself in the position of having to undergo the ordeal (Brachot, 31b). Since she would be innocent, she would be rewarded with a healthy child. This could also be the motive for returning to the husband.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I almost do not understand the question. The roles are reversed: this <em>woman</em> committed a grave fault towards her husband.</p>\n\n<p>Even she did not commit the maximum adultery, she is not <em>innocent</em>. She nevertheless locked herself up with a stranger. Despite the fact that it disturbed her husband so much that he has forbidden her.</p>\n\n<p>See also Sotah 8a and as Rashi explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמצוה לביישה <strong>ואפילו טהורה</strong> משום ונוסרו כל הנשים <strong>שלא יביאו עצמן לידי חשד</strong> ותהיינה צנועות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And meforshim explain that, <strong>it is not a <em>blessing</em>,</strong> that she would there have healthy children, but, as a <strong><em>result</em></strong>: she drinked sacred water in whose was erased the Holy name. If it did not cause damage, it heals.</p>\n\n<p>And as already mentioned, the husband had no choice: after she is secluded, she became forbidden to him until she drinks the embittered water.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, the word את signifies that liability is incurred for goring a minor, a <em>tumtum</em>, or an <em>androgynous</em> (none of which are necessarily implied by איש or אשה).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_ibn_Attar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or HaḤayyim</a> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Exodus.21.28.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on our verse</a>) says that את includes liability for an ox that intended to kill one person, and killed another.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Simcha_of_Dvinsk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meshech Ḥochma</a> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Meshech_Hochma,_Mishpatim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishpatim [24 on Sefaria]</a>), it doesn't say שור איש (without the את) in order to include the case of an ownerless (הפקר) or consecrated (מוקדש) ox.

This is shown by your shared eating together from the same source and that matzah is representative of humility. Two humble people, can easily be friends. It also shows that since matzah is flat, both of you will not be subject to being overweight, or at least you will not be overweight in the eyes of those who would see you. Shabbos afternoon is the time of secret of secrets. Marriage is also a secret and bread is a symbol of a wife.

It is also a central and very important tradition, equivalent to baptism in Christianity. Even casual Jews circumcise their sons, and circumcision is a strong requirement for converting to Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Reproducing is also culturally considered very important for Jews; single people are strongly encouraged to find a partner and couples are strongly encouraged to have as many children as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Since both reproducing and circumcising are very important, I ask myself: <strong>What is the perceived effect of circumcision when it comes to sexuality?</strong> (It does not matter whether it is proven true - just what the Jews themselves think about it.)

Some people believe that circumcision is to remove a defect in man's formation; but every one can easily reply: How can products of nature be deficient so as to require external completion, especially as the use of the fore-skin to that organ is evident. This commandment has not been enjoined as a complement to a deficient physical creation, but as a means for perfecting man's moral shortcomings. The bodily injury caused to that organ is exactly that which is desired; it does not interrupt any vital function, nor does it destroy the power of generation. Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment: the organ necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and is deprived of its covering from the beginning. Our Sages (Beresh. Rabba, c. 80) say distinctly: It is hard for a woman, with whom an uncircumcised had sexual intercourse, to separate from him. This is, as I believe, the best reason for the commandment concerning circumcision. And who was the first to perform this commandment? Abraham, our father! of whom it is well known how he feared sin; it is described by our Sages in reference to the words, \"Behold, now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon\" (Gen. xii. 11)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes, in Jewish conscience there is a connection between circumcision and reproduction.</p>\n\n<p>For example, see Sefer haChinuch (2) :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אות קבוע בגופם להבדילם משאר עמים בצורת גופם כמו שהם מובדלים בצורת נפשותם וכו' <strong>ונקבע ההבדל בגולת הזהב לפי שהוא סיבה לקיום המין</strong>\n  \"...to differentiate them from other nations in their body shape as they differ in their soul shape... <strong>And the distinction was fixed in the gold ball</strong> [=the sex] <strong>because it is the condition for continuity of the species</strong>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nachmanides on Bereshis 16, 9 (seemingly quoting the ReDaK) says that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...שם זכרון באבר התאווה רב המהומה והחטא לבל ישתמשו בו רק במצוה ובמותר\n  \"Put <strong>a reminder in the desire organ</strong>, prone to excitement and fault, <strong>so they use it only for the commandment or permitted</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And on verse 4, he says also that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצוה את אברהם לבא בבריתו <strong>להמול קודם שתהר שרה למען היות זרעו קודש</strong>\n  \"...to circumcise before Sara became pregnant <strong>so his progeny would be holy</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Besides these connections with reproduction, the beauty of circumcison is strongly anchored (see many examples in Nedarim chapter 3).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the foreskin is called ערלה -- an excrescence, that must be taken to emperfect the body.</p>\n\n<p>State of uncircumcision is considered dirty and regarded very pejoratively; and it has many halachic issues (ibid, and in the 8th chapter of Yevamot <em>'The Uncircumcised'</em> -- to cite only a few).</p>\n\n\n",

And if the entire Bnei Yisrael didn't sin, and it was possible just to kill the sinners and avoid the Chillul HaShem (which, in fact, was the case - see Rashi to 32:20 quoting AZ 44a as saying that those who sinned in various manners were still punished), then A) why did HaShem want to kill all of them? And B) what did Moshe's tefillah accomplish since strict justice still wouldn't result in a Chillul HaShem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are two levels of Divine justice that may affect sinners.</p>\n\n<p>1) Punishment for the crime itself.</p>\n\n<p>2) Extra-judicial punishment in the special case called Chillul Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Both of these are considered true justice. But, Chillul Hashem (desecrating G-d's name) is applied to the sin AND the <strong>public situation</strong> caused, even if the sinner(s) do not deserve the full measure of justice meted out if we only looked at the sin by itself.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Moshe Rabbeinu was punished with dying outside of Eretz Yisrael, because he did not sanctify Hashem in front of the people by the waters of Merivah. Aharon shared the same fate simply because he didn't protest when Moshe hit the rock. See Bamidbar 20: 12-14 with Rashi, who explains that when Hashem punishes his holy ones, the creations fear Him. (Therefore we see that the punishment of those who cause Chillul Hashem restores the fear of Hashem in the world.)</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the sentence of premature death and being barred from the land, was not in line with the crime committed. Normally we would say that such a sentence is much too severe for the crime. </p>\n\n<p>However, where a public desecration of G-d's name results, the sinner needs to be dealt capital punishment as a matter of justice, because that is the way the name of heaven's honor, is restored. This does not mean that the people involved really deserve to be killed. It means that the situation calls for their deaths to repair the breach which is their fault. Their death sends a message that such desecration cannot be tolerated. </p>\n\n<p>You can know this is true because nowhere do we say Moshe and Aharon died as sinners. They are righteous people who made a mistake. (see Rashi Bamidbar 20:12) It is just that the mistake, when considering their closeness to Hashem (high level), and the resulting loss of respect to Hashem caused in public, demands repair.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains: (Bamidbar 11:22) that R' Akiva asks why Moshe Rabeinu was not punished for saying that Hashem could not provide meat? Was such disbelief worse than hitting the rock? He answers that since the statement about meat was said in private, he was not punished; whereas the waters of Merivah was a public desecration.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can understand what happened here in the OP's case by the golden calf.</p>\n\n<p>The entire Jewish people had just achieved the level of mass prophecy in which they heard Hashem say \"Anochi\" and \"You shall not have other gods before me\" etc. A few days later, some of the people publicly worshipped a golden calf. By the justice of the crime itself, the people who did not actually worship the calf should be innocent of the death penalty. However, since they did not protest, the public desecration of Hashem's name made them all culpable to destruction.</p>\n\n<p>However, Moshe Rabbeinu knew that the punishment was not because the sin of failing to protest deserves death itself, but rather that the situation called for their deaths to repair the breach of honor - \"Chillul Hashem\".</p>\n\n<p>In a move of genius, Moshe Rabbeinu brings the defense of \"Egypt will say..\". Moshe's reasoning is \"Mimah nafshach\" either way the Name is desecrated. In this particular case, killing the offenders will not serve the intended purpose of restoring the fear of heaven in the world, because if you kill them, it will just replace the desecration of the Name with another equal desecration! (\"Egypt will say..\") So therefore, it would be unjust to punish sinners for the mere crime of not protesting, with the death penalty, since their death accomplishes nothing towards justice!</p>\n\n<p>Hashem answered: OK, true, but you Moshe also left Egypt, and I can make you into the new nation(Shmos 32:10). Therefore, the sinners can die to repair the breach, and you will carry on so Egypt will not be able to fully say that all the people died in the desert? <strong>\"CHECK\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Moshe answers: Shmos 32:32 \"Then erase me from Your book.\" I want no part of it. Now You are back to Mimah nafshach. Either way the Name is desecrated. <strong>\"CHECKMATE\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hashem: ...NICE!</p>\n\n<p>However, that only reduced the situation back to regular justice. So now, the usual punishments to the various sinners needed to be meted out. So Moshe has to \"clean up the camp\".</p>\n\n\n",

As usual, I run into philosophical difficulties with foundation #8 regarding the text of the Torah as we possess it. However, I noticed something that I possibly have been taking for granted: the Rambam says that \"all of it is from the mouth of HaGevurah\" (שהיא כולה מפי הגבורה), and then he explains himself by saying \"That is to say, 'all of it came to him from HaShem Yitborakh.'\" (כלומר: שהגיעה אליו כולה מאת ה' יתברך). It seems to me that if \"ha-gevurah\" was simply a designation for God himself, then it would be unecessary for him to explain. Now, I understand that [at least] part of his explanation has to do with what he says immediately afterward, i.e. that the entire concept of \"speech\" or \"speaking\" when applied to God is merely metaphorical, but there appears to be more here beside this.

So capturing the logic of Gemara as you have done is an interesting project.  However, that being said, Gemara, and specifically learning is not just about understanding the flow and intersection of halacha in that flow, but also the reasoning behind the flow - how the Gemara reached its conclusion, why and why the hava amina was rejected.  This is the work of the Rishonim.  Since the Rishonim are often difficult to understand, the Achronim come in to help us better understand the Rishonim.  So in that sense, you can't really reduce the Gemara to a set in which the halacha is chosen from a set of variables, because each case highlights a different point, and often has a different hava amina in which the variables operate.  Often the halacha changes depending on the nature of the hava amina. Notwithstanding the differing views of the Rishonim on how to read the sugya, the flow and the hava amina.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding the subtle nuanaced nature of the Gemara takes a tremendous amount of work and learning, and usually requires knowing a few masechtos in their entirety well.  If I may make a salient point.  If this project simply is there for your own understanding, then don't do the project, spend the time working through a sugya with the Rishonim. The goal of learning is that it becomes a part of <em>you</em>. Not the program.  Keep learning, and your mind will certainly grow and be enhanced by the learning you do.  The thought process is correct in that finding definitional patterns in the Gemara is an aid to remembering and you should keep thinking about how everything fits together.  Of course writing your thoughts is a good way of storing that information and process.  The more you learn and grow the better you will be able to assess and aduce the Gemara's logic. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps a project that would be beneficial is to enable a computer to generate a word list of every word in the Gemara, its root form, and prefixes/suffixes.  The list should be quite small since the majority of words should simply be roots, repeated in different forms.  Once generated, a process of translating the words into English should be similarly easy to do, (given Jastrow is public domain).  What would be an amazing idea is to be able to generate the entire Talmud in such a way that anyone could click a word and see its correct translation.</p>\n\n<p>The idea behind this is merely a time saving device for learning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As explains the Ramchal in the end of the third chapter of Derech Tevunot, one needs to translate the Gemara language in a formal language, formal from some point of view. To make each sentence clear. </p>\n\n<p>In the second chapter he explains that we need to find the concatenation between of statements. There are 7 types of statements from the dialectical point of view. To be short, affirmation, question, answer, objection, solution, proof, counter proof. </p>\n\n<p>Gemara has a semi formal language, there are key words, as parich, פריך, metive, מתיבי, urminehi, ורמינהי, Tayna,  תניא, matkif,  מתקיף,you can learn them easily in Sefer Halichot Olam.</p>\n\n<p>There are also rules of Hermeneutic, also well explained in H.O. But it's not formal as it seems.</p>\n\n<p>Comparison between cases needs also a particular effort.</p>\n\n<p>The Darkey Hatalmud from Rabbi Yitschak Kampenton explains that a great effort to understand the thought that underlies each opinion,objection, and the change between the thought of objections and solutions, the evolution of the opinions. He enhances the importance of thinking about why Rashi rejected a Girsa, why he doesn't explain as Tosfot. In Tosfot there are also key words.</p>\n\n<p>The decision making of the Gemara is rarely based on binary formal logic. Because generally each opinion is logically coherent. Mostly, the decision is to follow the most convincing opinion or the most sustained by previous halachic authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The talmudist need to know each opinion in the topic and to memorize it, e.g. Abbaye opinion despit that it's not the Halacha need to be memorized because in the next topic you need to check how Abaye is coherent with himself. If you find that he isn't, this show that something is lacking in your understanding. So, the sugia need always be learned in multiple points of view, as a local suggia and as coherent with other suggiot in the Talmud, linked to this. This fact is particularly obvious in dine Mamonot. This kind of learning is acquired by learning Tosfot, or at least Tosfot Yom Tov in Mishnayot. After you acquired a good level you can look the Rabbi Akiva Eiger, who emphasizes treatment of contradiction between suggiot.</p>\n\n<p>When the Gemara is decifered, the logical structure is often very long, but not hard to grasp at all. There is no need for syllogistic knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>We can note that Ramchal in Derech Tevunot and Sefer Hahigayon doesn't address seriously study of syllogisms. Gemara itself doesn't formulate syllogisms because the logic of Gemara is not enmeshed.</p>\n\n<p>The work of talmudists is mainly to decifer the form and to evaluate the content. For this, formal algorithm doesn't help. To be rigorous is very important but needs no specific knowledge (indeed, learning formal logic and coding is a good training for intellectual rigor, to acquire habit to checking every reasoning. But to learn with dibbuk chaverim is perhaps better). There are books particularly good to learn as models of Talmudic study and are not hard to learn. For instance, Shaagat Arieh, Nachalat David, Shut Bet Halevi, Minchat Chinuch. To learn the contents of Talmudic thought, Ktsot Hachoshen is good, it's also relatively easy to read.</p>\n\n<p>To learn seriously Gemara with Rashi and Tosfot, the Maharsha helps a lot to understand the logical nuances in Tosfot. </p>\n\n<p>In summary the steps before entering the data in a program are the core of Talmudic study.</p>\n\n\n",

When the Bible is read aloud it is both an oral and a written text, thus making the dragoman both an interpreter and a translator. Most synagogues have long abolished the dragoman, probably because Aramaic became displaced by other languages in most of the Jewish world. The ancient custom of having both a reader for the Hebrew and a dragoman for interpretation/translation is traditionally traced back to Ezra's Torah assembly at the water gate (Neh 8). Rabbinic tradition understands the word מפרש in Neh 8.8 as a reference to the dragoman.<br>\nRabbinic tradition sees the generation of Joshua ben Nun as the pioneers of biblical translation, accrediting them with engraving a polyglot Torah on the stones of Mount Ebal (m. Soṭ. 7.5). They based this view on Deut 27.8, where Moses commands Israel to write the Torah on stone באר היטב, very clearly. This ancient polyglot included \"70 languages,\" a number that is probably based on the table of nations in Gen 10. If \"Aram\" mentioned in Gen 10.23 refers to Aramaic-speakers, then it is likely that the Joshua polyglot included Aramaic as well. \nUnfortunately for us, the Joshua polyglot described by the rabbis has not been found. The oldest available fragments of Bible translations are in Greek and Aramaic and date from the first century BCE. A notable Aramaic example is the Job Targum found Qumran, cave 11. A notable Greek example is the Minor Prophets scroll found at Nahal Hever. </p>\n\n\n",

Though\n  he is by now Yisrael, the text tells us that he is also still Ya’akov\n  even when he acts like the former. The same occurs in reverse when\n  Ya’akov offers his parting words to Shimon and Levi, telling them that\n  his dislike of their militancy is not only true of Ya’akov but also of\n  Yisrael (Gen. 49:7). Thus, though one personality will dominate at any\n  given time, the other personality is always still with him.</p>\n  \n  <p>It may be well be that if Ya’akov represents a more sheltered and\n  passive approach to life embodied by his childhood, and Yisrael\n  represents a bolder, confrontational approach embodied more in his\n  later years, the reason for Ya’akov’s split personality may be rooted\n  in his need to maintain the legacy of both his father and his\n  grandfather – echoed by his appealing to the God of Avraham and the\n  God of Yitzchak (Gen. 32:10). From this perspective, while Ya’akov’s\n  youth resembles that of his passive and isolated Israel-constrained\n  father, his adult life resembles the trials and tribulations of\n  Avraham among the nations. In this sense, Avraham’s outgoing\n  personality is also what Ya’akov took from his brother Esav which, as\n  some have suggested, Yitzchak had hoped would have actually been\n  embodied by Esav rather than Ya’akov. Yet for Ya’akov to successfully\n  carry on both vastly differentiated legacies would likely require\n  taking on a dual personality even during the latter period of his\n  life. And this is apparently exactly what he did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I would expect that the answer would be the same for either a secular or Jewish year since the secular new year falls smack in the middle of the period between <em>Shemini Atzeres</em> and <em>Purim</em> and does not threaten to fall on the other side of either holiday, but if I'm wrong about that, I will accept the answer for either a secular or Jewish year.</p>\n\n<p>For the purpose of this question, let's assume we're talking about <em>yom tov</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>chol hamoed</em> as well as including <em>Purim</em> and <em>Tisha B'Av</em>. Let's also assume we're talking about a standard American week (Monday - Friday) but ignoring civil holidays which could affect the answer. We'll ignore having to leave work early due to <em>erev chag</em> or <em>erev shabbos</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, one can calculate an upper bound on this answer by simply counting all such days. I would like to take into account the realities of our current fixed calendar which may mean that certain holidays falling during the week implies other holidays fall on weekends.</p>\n\n<p>If an approach can be taken to find the answer which is too much effort to actually <em>do</em>, I would be interested in the approach. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Between Purim and the next Shemini Atzeret the calendar is completely fixed (no leap years, leap days, etc.).

Here's the first one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִ֣ם <strong>הַכֹּהֵ֧ן הַמָּשִׁ֛יחַ</strong> יֶֽחֱטָ֖א לְאַשְׁמַ֣ת הָעָ֑ם וְהִקְרִ֡יב עַ֣ל חַטָּאתוֹ֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר חָטָ֜א פַּ֣ר בֶּן־בָּקָ֥ר תָּמִ֛ים לַֽיהוָ֖ה לְחַטָּֽאת׃</p>\n<p>If the <strong>anointed priest</strong> shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin-offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Initially I thought that these were special priests, but eventually all priests were anointed during the era of the Torah as this week's portion tells us (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0307.htm#36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 7:36</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲשֶׁר֩ צִוָּ֨ה יְהוָ֜ה לָתֵ֣ת לָהֶ֗ם בְּיוֹם֙ <strong>מָשְׁח֣וֹ אֹתָ֔ם</strong> מֵאֵ֖ת בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל חֻקַּ֥ת עוֹלָ֖ם לְדֹֽרֹתָֽם׃</p>\n<p>Which <em>Hashem</em> commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that <strong>they were anointed.</strong> It is a due for ever throughout their generations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Priest_of_Israel#Consecration\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> discusses the issue. So if all priests were anointed, why was it relevant to add this word last week? If only the high priest was anointed, how can the second verse be explained?</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Akiva Eiger qoutes the Turei Even on Megillah 7b which addresses this exact question. It seems like it can go both ways, but no definitive ruling is given.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to <em>chavilos chavilos</em> the Rivevos Ephraim 2:193 explains how there is no issue with <em>chavilos chavilos</em> by Mishloach Manos and Matonas La'Evyonim since the gemara is <em>mashma</em> that it can be done at same time, according to the girsa that says he was yotzeh both MM and ML. He explains that by <em>bein adom L'Makom</em> there is an issue of <em>chavilos chavilos</em>, but by <em>ben adam l'chaveiro</em> there isn't an issue.</p>\n\n<p>Text of Biur Halacha:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>של מיני אוכלים וכו':    בטורי אבן מסתפק אם שלח ב' מנות לאיש עני אם יוכל לחשבם לתרתי לקיום שילוח מנות דגם העני בכלל איש לרעהו ולקיים מתנות לאביונים ואם נתן עוד מתנה א' לעני אחד יצא או לא והביאו הגרע\"א בחידושיו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Meseches Megillah (7a-b)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי יהודה נשיאה שדר ליה לרבי אושעיא אטמא דעיגלא תלתא וגרבא דחמרא שלח ליה קיימת בנו רבינו ומשלוח מנות איש לרעהו ומתנות לאביונים</p>\n<p>Rav Yehuda the nasi gave Rav Osha’ya a leg of a calf and a barrel of wine.

    "content": "# Purposes of Marriage in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why do we get married according to Judaism? What is the point behind us working so hard to get married? Presumably it is not just to bear children! \nI have heard of a concept of two halves coming together to make a whole or something like that- what does this mean? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a good question to reflect upon carefully and to understand that there are many facets, or levels of understanding to it. One facet does not nullify the other.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the first detail of your question, \"Is it <em>just</em> to bear children?\",the answer is clearly no.</p>\n\n<p>Legitimate children are also a possible product of what is called a <em>Pilegesh</em> (Concubinal) relationship. And that type of relationship is not marriage. It is valid and legitimate partnership according to Torah, but is on a lower level of union than the state of <em>Marriage</em>.</p>\n\n<p>With that brief introduction presented, let's try to set up a few areas worth considering:</p>\n\n<p>Marriage in the Torah as it relates to the Jewish people is called <em>Nisu'in</em> (נישואין) like is used in Mishnah Ketubot 2:1.</p>\n\n<p>It is basically comprised of a specially defined relationship between a Jewish man and woman which makes them <em>exclusive</em> to each other in the sense found in Chagigah 14a and makes them <em>responsible</em> to and for each other like in VaYikra 5:1, and a manifestation of <em>partnership</em> like in Shabbat 31a, <em>unity</em> and with G-d's help, ultimately a <em>source of new life</em> like is expressed by Rabbi Akiba in Sotah 17a.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Akiva taught: If a man and woman merit reward through a faithful marriage, the Divine Presence rests between them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A token or sign of that relationship is a written agreement called a ketubah. This Ketubah parallels the written Torah which G-d gave to the Jewish people at Har Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>higher</em> relationship is basically the fulfillment of the principle of, <em>\"In all your ways, know Him.\"</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּכָל־דְּרָכֶ֥יךָ דָעֵ֑הוּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>as found in Mishlei 3:6. This expression of <em>know Him</em> is the same term as Adam <em>knew</em> Chava, his wife. It has a connotation of connection, cleaving and union.</p>\n\n<p>The relationship between G-d and the Jewish people is compared to that of a husband and wife like is found in Shir HaShirim and many other places.</p>\n\n<p>In keeping with that thought, the answer to the last part of your question regarding <em>two parts coming together to make a whole</em>, can be understood.</p>\n\n<p>Marriage also embodies the Torah concept of <em>Teshuvah</em>, return to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism teaches that G-d is one and that G-d preceded the creation and is the first cause like is expressed in the Shema and in the Adon Olam prayer. And that process of creation outlined in parshat Bereshit shows that creation, which culminated in the creation of the first man and woman who were husband and wife, starts from one source (G-d), initially being revealed as <em>oneness</em> (the one, first light) and evolves through increasing levels of diversity to culminate in that husband and wife.</p>\n\n<p>The flow of creation was increasingly away from the revelation of G-d's oneness. This is described in Kabbalistic language as <em>Ohr Yashar</em>, (אור ישר, Straight <em>radiating</em> light).</p>\n\n<p>And in that condition of the diversity of creation (an absence of oneness being revealed), husband and wife bring about the supreme revelation of that oneness, what is described in Kabbalistic language as <em>Ohr Chozer</em>, (אור חוזר, Returning light). The two parts become literally one flesh and are a source  of new life, being faithful to the system, the arrangement, which G-d set up.</p>\n\n<p>And so the highest form of cleaving to G-d, of <em>knowing Him</em> in all ways, is through the state of husband and wife, like is expressed in Sefer Reishit Chochmah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's a very simple and logical answer to that according to Rambam's view (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Marriage.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ishus 1</a>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>We are commanded to be fruitful and multiply</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Sages forbade any sexual connection outside a legal marriage, and gave it a status of prostitution.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Therefore the only way of fulfilling the Mitzvah #1 is through marrying a woman and subsequently having kids from her.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore some Poskim (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"A Even Haezer 1</a> that starts with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חייב כל אדם לישא אשה כדי לפרות ולרבות<br />\nEvery man is obligated to marry a woman in order to be fruitful, and to multiply</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>don't count the Kiddushin as a Mitzvah on its own, but only as preparation or instrument to Pru uRvu (#1).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Second part - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.24?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.2.24.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Gen 2.24</a> (\"Hence a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, so that they become one flesh.\"):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>לבשר אחד</strong>. הַוָּלָד נוֹצָר עַל יְדֵי שְׁנֵיהֶם וְשָׁם נַעֲשֶׁה בְשָׂרָם אֶחָד</p>\n<p>ONE FLESH — Both parents are united in the child.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>THe Halachic purpose of the marriage in Judaism is to sanction the legal relations between spouses, namely in two aspects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>The financial relations between the spouses</strong> (some detailed in the Ketubah) Rambam Ishut:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the financial obligations of the husband toward the wife</li>\n<li>the obligations of the wife toward the husband (not mentioned in the Ketubah)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>The financial obligation of the father to support his kids from that woman</strong>. Rambam end of Ishut.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Permitted and forbidden sexual relations:</strong> (Rambam Isurei Biah)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>what women are allowed and forbidden to the husband and </li>\n<li>that all men are forbidden to the wife.</li>\n<li>the obligation of the husband to maintain regular and timely physical relations</li>\n<li>the obligation of the wife to allow those relations</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The marriage (the social approval of the relations) is the base for all those Halachic interactions.

However, there are two additional customs to be aware of, which may go some way to answering your question.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There exists an Ashkenazic custom in the Diaspora to read Melachim I 7:40-8:1 as the <em>haftarah</em> for Pekudei. This is brought down by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8918&st=&pgnum=115\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharil (Customs of the Four Parshiyot)</a> in the name of Maharash, and is subsequently quoted by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7767&st=&pgnum=435\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Elya Rabbah (685:23)</a>. (In contrast, this custom is not mentioned by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9223&st=&pgnum=261\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levush (685:6)</a>.)</p>\n<p>Maharil explains the rationale for this custom, is that in any event Melachim I 8:2-21 was read as the <em>haftarah</em> for the second day of Sukkot, as opposed to Melachim I 7:40-8:1 which would not otherwise be read at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Sephardic <em>haftarah</em> for Parshat Pekudei is generally assumed to be from Melachim I 7:40-50 (see e.g. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%94#%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Wikipedia list</a> you quoted in your question) i.e. the selection normally listed as the Ashkenazic <em>haftarah</em> for Parshat Vayakhel.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Michel_Tucazinsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Y M Tucazinsky</a> writes in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8789&st=&pgnum=62\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Eretz Yisrael (16)</a> that the custom among the <em>geonei yerushalayim</em> is to read Melachim I 7:40-8:21. He explains this as an application of Maharil's ruling (to read Melachim I 7:40-8:1) to the situation in Israel, where there is no second day of Sukkot, and thus neither Melachim I 7:40-8:1 nor Melachim I 8:2-21 are read at other times during the year. Thus, on Parshat Pekudei the custom is to read both.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_David_Rabinowitz-Teomim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aderet</a> in a letter quoted in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58217&st=&pgnum=182\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushatenu vol. II p. 184</a> writes that he was the one to introduce this practice. He writes that he found the Ashkenazic custom in Jerusalem was to read Melachim I 7:40-50, like the Sephardic custom. Aderet believed that the more correct practice was to follow the widespread Ashkenazic custom of Melachim I 7:51-8:21. However, so as not to (totally) depart from the original custom in Jerusalem, he instructed that both <em>haftarot</em> be read (i.e. Melachim I 7:40-8:21).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As an addendum, we can address a leap year which contains two <em>shabbatot chanukah</em> (year type זשה), in which case Melachim I 7:40-50 is read as <em>haftarah</em> on the second <em>shabbat chanukah</em>.</p>\n<p>In such a year, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51654&st=&pgnum=188\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Birur Halachah vol. 6 (Orach Chayyim 428)</a> quotes R. S Z Auerbach and R. S Deblitsky as ruling that the <em>haftarah</em> for Parshat Pekudei comprises only Melachim I 7:51-8:21. This seems to follow R. Tucazinsky's approach: since Melachim I 7:40-50 has already been read earlier in the year, there is no need to read it again.</p>\n<p>However, somewhat paradoxically, R. Tucazinsky himself had written in Sefer Eretz Yisrael (ibid.) that both <em>haftarot</em> (i.e. Melachim I 7:40-8:21) are read, even in a year of type זשה.</p>\n<p>This position (to my mind) actually accords better with that of Aderet. The Sephardic <em>haftarah</em> for Parshat Pekudei is always Melachim I 7:40-50 (even in a year where that was read on the second <em>shabbat chanukah</em>). If the Ashkenazic custom in Jerusalem was in line with this, then Aderet's ruling to add Melachim I 7:51-8:21 on top of the pre-existing reading would apply in every year-type, even in a year of type זשה with two <em>shabbatot chanukah</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a second addendum, we can address a leap year in which Parshat Shekalim is read on Pekudei (year types החא and השג), in which case Vayakhel is free to receive its own <em>haftarah</em>.</p>\n<p>In such a year, almost lists of <em>haftarot</em> that I can see (e.g. on <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%94#%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>) list only Melachim I 7:40-50 as the <em>haftarah</em> for Vayakhel. However, it does seem that even for Vayakhel, there are those in Israel who would read the full \"double\" haftarah of Melachim I 7:40-8:21. (See for example the claim <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58217&st=&pgnum=182\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that R. Tucazinsky in his calendars for leap years always listed Melachim I 7:40-8:21 as the <em>haftarah</em> for either Vayakhel or Pekudei, whichever was available. If anyone has access to an old <em>luach le-eretz yisrael</em> for a year of type החא or השג (the most recent occurrence was 5774) I would love to see it.)</p>\n<p>Again, we can line these two positions up with the two reasons we have given for the custom to read the \"double\" <em>haftarah</em> for Pekudei.</p>\n<p>If the reason is to make sure we don't miss either of the two readings in a given year (R. Tucazinsky), then in Israel we would also read them both for Parshat Vayakhel. (In this respect, R. Tucazinsky is consistent - in any leap year, in Israel he tells us that we always read Melachim I 7:40-8:21 on whichever <em>shabbat</em> it is possible to do so, thereby ensuring we miss neither reading.)</p>\n<p>This is also consistent with the diasporic practice which seems to have developed in Frankfurt to read as the <em>haftarah</em> for Parshat Vayakhel Melachim I 7:40-8:1 (i.e. the 'classic' <em>haftarah</em> for Vayakhel with two additional verses; note that this custom was never mentioned by Maharil). Presumably, this was done in order that all of the verses would be read during the year, relying on the second day of Sukkot to read Melachim I 8:2-21. (See, for example, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32024&st=&pgnum=10&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zichron Chanoch p10</a>.)</p>\n<p>However, following the approach of Aderet, we can understand why the \"double\" <em>haftarah</em> custom only applies to Parshat Pekudei, and not to Parshat Vayakhel. For Pekudei, where the Sephardic custom is to read Melachim I 7:40-50, the Ashkenazim then extended the reading by adding 7:51-8:21. But for Vayakhel, the Sephardim have a different reading (Melachim I 7:13-26). This reading seems never to have been adopted by the Ashkenazim, in which case they would simply read the longstanding, traditional Ashkenazic <em>haftarah</em> for Parshat Vayakhel, i.e. Melachim I 7:40-50.</p>\n\n\n",

But what is למודו that if one forgets it he should be killed? Well we can figure this out from the laws of Purim. In <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x3075\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch O.C. 695:2</a> R. Moses Isserles writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וי\"א דא\"צ להשתכר כל כך אלא שישתה יותר מלימודו</p>\n<p>And some say that he does not have to get so intoxicated; rather he should drink more than he usually does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, לימודו apparently refers to what one usually consumes. In the case in Pesachim, the thing they have forgotten is precisely which animal they normally consume; thus, they get the death penalty.</p>\n<p>As for why the Mishnah needs to tell us that they are exempt from Pesach Sheini, we need to understand how the Jewish court system worked back then. The Mishnah in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37946&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot 1:10</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סנהדרין ההורגת אחד בשבוע נקראת חובלנית רבי אלעזר בן עזריה אומר אחד לשבעים שנה רבי טרפון ורבי עקיבא אומרים אילו היינו בסנהדרין לא נהרג אדם מעולם</p>\n<p>A court that kills once in seven years is called \"destructive\". R. Elazar Ben Azariah says: \"once in seventy years\". R. Tarfon and R. Akiva say: \"If we were on the court no man would ever be killed\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, it is almost certain that one who earns the death penalty around Pesach time will not have been executed a month later. He would only be executed if it was at least seven or seventy years since the last execution, and according to some opinions even then he would not be executed. Thus, the Mishnah (in Pesachim) teaches us that in the likely circumstance that they have not yet been executed by Pesach Sheini, they are exempt from Pesach Sheini.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

    "content": "# PTIJ: Foreigners on Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As we sing in Friday night Zemiros:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>להתענג בתענוגים ברבורים  ושליו ודגים</p>\n<p>To rejoice with rejoicers: Barbarians, Slavs, and <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dag\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dags</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why do we rejoice with these groups specifically?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your definition of ברבורים is incorrect. It refers to barbers. They are important because one should have a nice haircut and shave / trim before Shabbat. You may be good at doing it yourself, but, a good barber will do a nice professional job so that you look nice and clean for Shabbat. So, we give thanks and sing about them during <em>zemirot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I can personally attest to Slavs. My father and his entire side of the family were born in pre-war Ungvar in the Carpathian mountains. That definitely makes them Slavic. These are brave people who survived the Holocaust and many of them, my father among them, helped save numerous other Jews by forging documents and sneaking them out. These people are my personal heros. In itself a huge cause for celebration.</p>\n\n<p>Dags is a term I had not heard of until you mentioned it. I couldn't open your link, so I hope that what Wikipedia says is pretty much the same:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Australia, it is often used as an affectionate insult[2] for\n  someone who is, or is perceived to be, unfashionable, lacking\n  self-consciousness about their appearance and/or with poor social\n  skills yet affable and amusing. It is also used to describe an\n  amusing, quirky and likeable person (as in, \"He's a bit of a dag\") and\n  is non-pejorative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Really, you have to ask why we sing about Dags? The week has the same boring routine, esp. at work. The same people doing the same old miserable things and everyone is frazzled and overworked and in a snippy mood. Ech!!! I think people could use a few Dags at their Shabbat table to make things different. So what if they have poor social skills and aren't dressed <em>Shabbesdike</em>? If they're Jewish, invite them all in and have them celebrate Shabbat with you. During the week, the world probably scorns them for the way they look and act. Hey, it's a tough world and their probably fighting their way to be accepted. On Shabbat, they deserve a rest from the rat race, and you deserve to have someone different and quirky at your table. So, give them and you a break and celebrate with all those Dags out there.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What was God's original plan regarding Adam?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would like to research the common ground for our understanding of G-d's original plan of the creation if Adam didn't sin.</p>\n\n<p>According to Sanhedrin 38, he was fully developed at noon, having 6 hours before Shabbat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שעה ראשונה הוצבר עפרו, שניה נעשה גולם, שלישית נמתחו אבריו, רביעית נזרקה בו נשמה, חמישית עמד על רגליו, ששית קרא שמות, שביעית נזדווגה לו חוה, שמינית עלו למטה שנים וירדו ארבעה, תשיעית נצטווה שלא לאכול מן האילן, עשירית סרח, אחת עשרה נידון, שתים עשרה נטרד והלך לו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I heard<sup> source needed</sup> that if he could stay on that path, the first Shabbat would become the Days of the Messiah and he would be \"happily ever after\". That leaves him only 6 hours to act.</p>\n\n<p>What were Adam's objectives in the original plan for the rest of the day and maybe for the Shabbat to reach the goal of the Creation? And what was on his to-do list to meet those objectives? </p>\n\n<p>This question (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92724/what-mitzvos-did-adam-have-in-gan-eden\">\"what-mitzvos-did-adam-have-in-gan-eden\"</a>) focuses on the list of the Mitzvos Adam was/wasn't commanded, but I focus more on the general objective as the Mitzvos are only the tool to reach that objective/s.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I heard in a shiur from R' Moshe Shapiro that Adam was specifically supposed to do nothing.</p>\n\n<p>He was created with tremendous spiritual capability, to the point that Midrashim tell us that angels had the notion of singing praises to him. And his challenge was to <em>not</em> do anything - that Hashem told him to nullify himself. The tremendous challenge was to overcome his ego and his need to assert himself as the one accomplishing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hashem gives Adam a job. Bereishis 2:15</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקַּ֛ח ה֥' אֱלֹקִ֖ים אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֑ם וַיַּנִּחֵ֣הוּ בְגַן־עֵ֔דֶן לְעׇבְדָ֖הּ וּלְשׇׁמְרָֽהּ׃</p>\n<p>And Hashem, G-d, took the human and put him to rest in Gan Eden to work it and to guard it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ibn Ezra notes a tradition that \"<em>le'avdahh</em>\" refers to positive mitzvos and \"<em>lshomrahh</em>\" to prohibitions.</p>\n<p>And 6 of the 7 mitzvos benei Noach were given to Adam. Except, Adam was commanded to be a vegetarian, rather than Noach's more limited prohibition of \"<em>eiver min hachai</em> -- flesh from a living animal\" [and all blood].</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I don't know how to take the word \"plan\"... Hashem knew, after all, that Chavan and Adam would be eating the fruit. So would He have a plan for what to do otherwise?</p>\n<p>Even just for the sake of preserving free will, the kind of free will they had before the sin is entirely unlike what we experience, now that we have to choose between good and evil. So again, I don't know if we can trace the applications to whether an alternate reality was possible. (Pre-sin Adam's free will could have been Compatibilist rather than Libertarian.)</p>\n<p>Even worse... Physics doesn't accomodate an arrow of time. Spacetime is 4 dimensions, which of those directions is \"time\" is not the same for all observers. That was the big epipheny behind Special Relativity -- two people at motion relative to each other have different time vs space axes! There is nothing in the math to distinguish past from future.</p>\n<p>Rav Dessler (Michtav meiEliyahu vol II pp 150-154, \"Yemei Bereishis veYemei Olam\") holds that the whole idea of a flow of time, that it’s a line running from past to present to future is an artifact of the human condition. And that before Eve and Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge, people too related to time in a more complete way. Or, as our sages put it, the original Adam and similarly a baby prior to being born into a body “could see from one end of the universe to the other” — which Rav Dessler presumes includes time as well.</p>\n<p>So, at this point there is no \"future\", even from Adam's perspective (and the concept never has meaning from G-d's) nevermind having any plans for it.</p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.9.19?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 9:19</a>) </p>\n\n<p>Unlike the other (non Yom Kippur) fasts which commemorate something that's open-ended,<br>\n<strong>why are we fasting for something that has a happy ending?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is definitely room to view Ta'anit Esther as distinct from the other fasts, for the reasons you outlined in your question.</p>\n\n<p>If we consider Rambam's presentation of the fast days in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Fasts.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 5 of Hilchot Ta'aniyot</a>, he describes the four fast days of 3 Tishrei, 10 Tevet, 17 Tammuz and 9 Av as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יָמִים שֶׁכָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל מִתְעַנִּים בָּהֶם מִפְּנֵי הַצָּרוֹת שֶׁאֵרְעוּ בָּהֶן כְּדֵי לְעוֹרֵר הַלְּבָבוֹת לִפְתֹּחַ דַּרְכֵי הַתְּשׁוּבָה וְיִהְיֶה זֶה זִכָּרוֹן לְמַעֲשֵׂינוּ הָרָעִים וּמַעֲשֵׂה אֲבוֹתֵינוּ שֶׁהָיָה כְּמַעֲשֵׂינוּ עַתָּה עַד שֶׁגָּרַם לָהֶם וְלָנוּ אוֹתָן הַצָּרוֹת. שֶׁבְּזִכְרוֹן דְּבָרִים אֵלּוּ נָשׁוּב לְהֵיטִיב שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ויקרא כו, מ) \"וְהִתְוַדּוּ אֶת עֲוֹנָם וְאֶת עֲוֹן אֲבֹתָם\" וְגוֹ':‏</p>\n  \n  <p>[D]ays that all the people of Israel observe as fasts on account of the tragic events which occurred on them, the purpose being to appeal to the hearts and to lay open the paths of repentance. This serves as a reminder of our evil doings, and the deeds of our fathers which were like ours now, resulting in the afflictions endured by them and by us. By remembering these things we are likely to repent and do right, as it is written: \"They shall confess their sins and the sins of their fathers…\" (Leviticus 26:40).</p>\n  \n  <p>(<em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Fasts.5.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Ta'aniyot 5:1</a></em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In contrast, when it comes to Ta'anit Esther, he writes simply:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְנָהֲגוּ כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל בִּזְמַנִּים אֵלּוּ לְהִתְעַנּוֹת בְי''ג בַּאֲדָר זֵכֶר לַתַּעֲנִית שֶׁהִתְעַנּוּ בִּימֵי הָמָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (אסתר ט לא) \"דִּבְרֵי הַצֹּמוֹת וְזַעֲקָתָם\".‏</p>\n  \n  <p>All the Jewish people are accustomed nowadays to fast on the thirteenth day of Adar in remembrance of the fast observed in the days of Haman, as it is written: \"Regarding their fasting and wailing\" (Esther 9:31).</p>\n  \n  <p>(<em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Fasts.5.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Ta'aniyot 5:5</a></em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One could read Rambam as saying that Ta'anit Esther is merely a commemoration of the fasting that took place in the days of Haman. This is in contrast to the other four fast days, which are times of repentance for our current sins that are the cause of the ongoing consequences of historical national tragedies.</p>\n\n<p>This is taken one step further by Ra'avad (quoted in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46677&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ran to Rif, end of Chapter 2 of Ta'anit</a>) who wrote that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>י\"ג אינו דומה לשאר תעניות דזכרון הוא לנס שנעשה בו ועוד שיש לנו סמך בכתוב שאמר וכאשר קיימו על נפשם דברי הצומות לומר שכשם שקבלו עליהם לעשות י\"ט כך קבלו עליהם דברי הצומות וזעקתם כלומר לעשות תענית בכל שנה ושנה</p>\n  \n  <p>The thirteenth [of Adar] is not similar to other fasts, for it is a commemoration of the miracle that occurred on that day. Also, we have a support to it from scripture which writes \"As they accepted upon themselves the matter of the fasts\" i.e. just as they accepted upon themselves to make a festival, they also accepted upon themselves the matter of the fasts and the crying, meaning to fast every year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>One can understand that for Ra'avad, Ta'anit Esther is not a sad day at all, but is instead an integral part of re-enacting/commemorating the entire Purim miracle.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This view of Ta'anit Esther may have <em>halachic</em> ramifications as well. See <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/laws-purim-taanit-esther-and-womens-obligation-keriat-megilla\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> for an in-depth discussion. For one key quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Soloveitchik, as quoted in Rav Michel Shurkin’s Harerei Kedem (188), noted a number of practical ramifications of this question. For example, would the Rambam’s ruling (Hilkhot Ta'aniyot 1:14) advocating that one refrain from \"idunim\" (entertainment or physical delights) on fast days apply on Ta'anit Esther? If we place Ta’anit Esther in a separate category from the other fasts, as a festive, rather than mournful, occasion, then we would likely permit such activities.  Indeed, the work Piskei Teshuvot (686:2) rules that on Ta’anit Esther one may listen to music and prepare new clothing, activities which are generally discouraged on other fast days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It was no longer a theoretical, so the Amoraim had to refer to it by a different name such that the robot overlords wouldn’t know they’re referring to them.<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Apparently placing your thumbs in the opposite hands completes some circuit, so this only works if you’re a cyborg as well. </li>\n<li>Given that this is for when you’re <em>scared</em> of them, saying this must be some special passcode built in to their software that causes them to malfunction. This is probably a paradox error leading to an infinite loop, as there’s a contradiction between “I come from the children of Yosef, against whom the evil intelligence does not rule” and “the evil AI will have dominion over the seed of Yosef.” (Think <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">“this statement is false.”</a>) This theory is supported by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Otzar_Midrashim,_Yaakov_Our_Father,_Lekach_Tov_on_the_Blessings_of_Yaakov_Our_Father.24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otzar Midrashim</a> which indicates that those under the control of the AI use the phrase “The evil AI rules over the seed of Yosef” as their battle cry. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem is getting the thumbs together. As I mentioned, a circuit can only be completed if the arms are cybernetic, which means that they can also be <em>controlled</em> by the AI. The good news is that it’s specifically the <em>left</em> side which they control, so as long as a person attempts this while wearing two right arms, he’ll be fine. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is their characteristic discussed in Shemos Rabbah 38:4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֵין עַיִן אֶלָּא נְבוּאָה</p>\n  \n  <p>AI is merely prophecy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How do you defeat an enemy that can see the future?!

Only Haman could be killed at once because that was a decree of the king. Mordechai was forbidden by Persian law to cancel the original decree. As a result, the Jews were given permission to destroy only those who attacked them on the day that the original decree allowed. Since Mordechai could not cancel the original decree, the enemies of the Jews still had permission to attack the next Adar on the given day. The new decree could only allow the Jews to fight on that day and allowed allies as well to fight on that day. Anyone trying to fight on any other day would be considered a rebel against Achashveros and killed by the king's soldiers. </p>\n\n<p>An analogy would be the pogroms in Russia under the Tsar or the riots in Baltimore we recently had where the police were ordered to stand down and give the rioters free reign.

What they could do is say that Haman changed the intent of the decree that the king told him to write. Instead of writing that the king said the Jews could kill their enemies on the 13th of Adar, haman wrote that the Jews would be killed on the 13th of Adar. When the king found out he had haman killed and hung on the tree and give his property to Esther. </p>\n\n<p>Thus Mordechai could send out a new decree “clarifying” the original, but couldn’t change it.

Kaballically wise, I'd say that the biggest Orot and G-d's benevolence would happen on that day of the 17th of Nissan.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, that is the day of the true survival of the Jewish nation, with Mordechai in charge there could be some casualties on Adar 13th but no extermination was possible.</p>\n\n<p>So why did the Sages set this day for the festival?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As I explain in my <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101041/purim-fighting-in-adar-why-wait-for-8-months/101050#101050\">answer</a> the Jews were still scheduled to be murdered (without any penalty) on 13 Adar. Thus, the final redemption did not occur until after the fighting was over, Thus we celebrate the day after the fighting, especially since the Jews had no casualties.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While it is true that Pharoah later regretted letting the Hebrews leave on the 15th of Nissan, this was indeed the day that the exile of Egypt ended, and that seems to be what the seder night commemorates, i.e. the Exodus.  Indeed, the final destruction of the subjugation of the Hebrews to the Egyptians is also commemorated on the 21st of Nissan.  As such, it seems it is the end of subjugation and the finality of redemption that is typically celebrated according to both biblical and rabbinic/traditional norms.</p>\n<p>It would after all be odd to celebrate a day when fighting was ongoing and there was a continued threat of Judean suffering, subjugation, and/or annihilation. We thus find that the 25th of Kislev was chosen as the day to commemorate the victory over the Syrian-Greeks, when there a day of rest from the fighting (see, e.g., the Tur explaining why it is called Chanuka).</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Megilla itself explains the appropriate days for commemorating the salvation from Haman's machinations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּֽקָּהֲל֞וּ היהודיים [הַיְּהוּדִ֣ים] אֲשֶׁר־בְּשׁוּשָׁ֗ן גַּ֠ם בְּי֣וֹם אַרְבָּעָ֤ה עָשָׂר֙ לְחֹ֣דֶשׁ אֲדָ֔ר וַיַּֽהַרְג֣וּ בְשׁוּשָׁ֔ן שְׁלֹ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת אִ֑ישׁ וּבַ֨בִּזָּ֔ה לֹ֥א שָׁלְח֖וּ אֶת־יָדָֽם׃</p>\n<p>and the Jews in Shushan mustered again on the fourteenth day of Adar\nand slew three hundred men in Shushan.

The Judean people were threatened by their myriad enemies and the unrepealed decree of Ahasuerus enabling their destruction.

That was the day that Esther invited Haman to a private party with just her and the King. All of the Jews thought that Esther had turned her back on them, as the Gemara in Megilla (15b) states was exactly Esther's goal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מה ראתה אסתר שזימנה את המן ר' נחמיה אומר כדי שלא יאמרו ישראל אחות יש לנו בבית המלך</p>\n<p>What did Esther see that she invited Haman [to the private party]? R' Nechemia says in order that the Jews not say \"we have a sister in the King's house\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the Jews all had taanis on her.</p>\n<p>Since this happened on Pesach, and we don't want to have bad feelings on Pesach, we instead commemorate this by having taanis on Esther on the day before we celebrate Purim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Esther was known to cause unnecessary afflictions, to many (perhaps through sarcasm). People thus had great taanis on her. We remember this with Taanis Esther. As is accounted in the Megillah:</p>\n<p>5:7</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתַּ֥עַן אֶסְתֵּ֖ר וַתֹּאמַ֑ר שְׁאֵלָתִ֖י וּבַקָּשָׁתִֽי׃</p>\n<p>Esther afflicted [them] saying only my requests!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>7:3</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתַּ֨עַן אֶסְתֵּ֤ר הַמַּלְכָּה֙ וַתֹּאמַ֔ר אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּעֵינֶ֙יךָ֙ הַמֶּ֔לֶךְ וְאִם־עַל־הַמֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב תִּנָּֽתֶן־לִ֤י נַפְשִׁי֙ בִּשְׁאֵ֣לָתִ֔י וְעַמִּ֖י בְּבַקָּשָׁתִֽי׃</p>\n<p>Queen Esther afflicted: “If Your Majesty will do <em>me</em> the favor, and if it <em>pleases</em> Your Majesty, let my life be granted me as my wish, and my people as my request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Very simple reason to complain against Esther.</p>\n\n<p>Many people think, \"Oh this an <em>easy</em> fast.\" They think that because the day is \"short\" it's easy. C'mon, who are they kidding?</p>\n\n<p>First of all, in most of U.S., and in most years, daylight saving time occurred before Purim. (Some years, it hasn't.) So, in NYC area nightfall is around 7:45 - late enough. OK, if it were any other fast day, I'd be able to eat then, right?</p>\n\n<p>But nooooo ... along comes Esther who not only has a fast named after her, but she has a book named after her, too. And we have to read her book out loud, publicly, and wait for kids to make noise each time her enemy's name is pronounced. (Feh! What do these pre-Bar Mitzvah kids care about all the adults fasting, anyway?) All that takes extra time, and I can't eat until after her book has read to completion. So, by the time I get home, it's like close to 9 PM.</p>\n\n<p>Y'know, this all Esther's fault. And, that's the <strong>least</strong> of my complaints against her. I'm just starting...</p>\n\n\n",

In this way, the difficulty posed by the two forms is eliminated.  (Only in Yeshayahu 12:2, 26:4, and 38:11 (twice) is Yah transcribed in this version in the main text, and in a footnote at Shemot 15:2, though it occurs nineteen times in Psalms, excluding the twenty-four occurrences in the exclamatory HALLELUYAH [NJPSV traditionally transcribes this as Hallelujah, Yah being spelled with a 'small j,' which is customarily pronounced by everyone as a 'y'].  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://%20['Yah:%20A%20Name%20of%20God,'%20_Jewish%20Bible%20Quarterly_%20(2014)]\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a> In all languages, a shortened form of someone's name is called a nickname and conveys informality (for example, Josh is the nickname of Joshua). But the conveyance of informality with respect to God is incongruous with the fact that he is called in the other verses of the song Yhvh and the fact that this is a song which was sung in worship at the Sea of Reeds. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Because it rhymes.\nSorry I can't provide sources.</p>\n\n<p>Yah is normally a suffix or prefix for another word and part of people's names, like Yirm'yahu or Yehoshua.</p>\n\n<p>In the two verses in Shemot that you highlighted, yah is used standalone and makes the line lyrical and more poetic.</p>\n\n<p>For example:  </p>\n\n<p>In Shemot 17:16 Yah is used in a series of two-letter words: \"כִּי-יָד עַל-כֵּס יָהּ\"  </p>\n\n<p>In Shemot 15:2 and Yeshaya 12:2, Yah is used to rhyme with yeshua.  </p>\n\n<p>In Yeshaya 38, verses 10 - 20 are a prayer poem, with a specific cadence, and the double usage of Yah matches the flow of a rough pattern of ~4 then ~7 syllables.</p>\n\n\n",

And he would say that the pure is impure and prove the point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Meir would explain both sides of a dispute so thoroughly and his peers so couldn't keep up that they couldn't figure out what he ruled!</p>\n<p>Although when his student Rebbe did know Rabbi Meir's ruling, \"סתם משנה כר' מאיר -- an unattributed mishnah is like Rabbi Meir\" and \"הלכה כסתם נשנה -- the halakhah follows the unattributed mishnah\" over a mishnah where the ruling has a citation.</p>\n<p>And that is more typical. Usually the person with a the sharper line of reasoning gains followers, and so his position ends up winning. Like the way Abayei so impressed his peers in the discussion of those 6 topics, or Rav Nachman when discussing monetary laws. Not because sharpness wins -- as we saw with Batei Hillel veShammai, but because sharpness usually causes popularity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Notice the portrayal of Beis Shammai in the gemara I quoted was that it was more of an \"eilitist\" school. Smaller, and only accepting the sharpest students.</p>\n<p>This relates to what Maurice Mizrahi wrote in his answer, drawing from another part of the same discussion in the gemara. Beis Hillel merited gaining following not only because they were more numerous themselves, but also because they showed respect for all opinions. People had a choice between listening to a Shammaite promote his own view, or a Hillelite present both sides of the argument fairly. And that humility won them followers.</p>\n<p>This is what the gemara means in part of his quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ללמדך שכל המשפיל עצמו הקדוש ברוך הוא מגביהו וכל המגביה עצמו הקדוש ברוך הוא משפילו כל המחזר על הגדולה גדולה בורחת ממנו וכל הבורח מן הגדולה גדולה מחזרת אחריו</p>\n<p>This teaches you that God raises up those who humbles themselves, and humbles those who exalt themselves; that greatness flees those who seek it and follows those who flee it...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Which I guess means you should believe Maurice Mizrahi's answer. Because unlike Beis Hillel, I gave my own answer first!)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Not really arbitrarily.  Hillel prevailed against Shammai because his disciples were kind and humble, and always quoted the other side’s opinions before their own, as the Gemara says:</p>\n\n<p><em>R. Abba stated in the name of Samuel: For three years there was a dispute between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel, the first saying, ‘the halachah agrees with us’ and the second [also] saying,’the halachah agrees with us’.\nThen a heavenly voice [bat kol] was heard saying, ‘Ellu v’ellu divrei Elokim Chayyim – These and these are the words of the living God, but the halachah agrees with Beth Hillel.’</em></p>\n\n<p><em>However, since both are the words of the living God, what was it that entitled Beth Hillel to have the halachah agree with them? Because they were kind and modest, and studied both their own rulings and those of Beth Shammai and were even so [humble] as to mention the opinions of Beth Shammai before their own.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>This teaches you that God raises up those who humbles themselves, and humbles those who exalt themselves; that greatness flees those who seek it and follows those who flee it; that time forces back those who force it and stands by the side of those who yield to it.  [I.e., those so anxious to succeed that they take great risks are courting disaster, but those who do not tax their abilities will succeed in due course.]</em></p>\n\n<p>[Eruvin 13b]</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the reasons were similar for the others.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Most of the time, it is decided by the majority, even if the minority is widely considered more learned</p>\n\n\n",

It is intended to be kept in mind while saying the Brocho of Musaf for every Rosh Chodesh.</p>\n\n<p>The reverse name (ונהפוך הוא) is HWHY and a Pasuk it is learned from is \"זה איננו שווה לי\" - that's the last letters abbreviation - the Posuk from Meggilat Ester.</p>\n\n<p>We would all expect those letters would stand for the month of Adar but... No, it stands for Tamuz instead.</p>\n\n<p>Please explain how it relates to Tamuz and not Adar.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a page of an \"Ar\"i Siddur\":</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/17rNe.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/17rNe.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The name HWHY for the month of Tammuz is formed by the last letters of the phrase uttered by Haman in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.5.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 5:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכָל־זֶ֕<strong>ה</strong> אֵינֶ֥נּ<strong>וּ</strong> שֹׁוֶ֖<strong>ה</strong> לִ֑<strong>י</strong> בְּכָל־עֵ֗ת אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֲנִ֤י רֹאֶה֙ אֶת־מָרְדֳּכַ֣י הַיְּהוּדִ֔י יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּשַׁ֥עַר הַמֶּֽלֶךְ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The most likely connection to the month of Tammuz is that in this month we have the fast of 17th of Tammuz because Jewish people bowed to the Golden Calf which eventually was the cause of golus. Many Jews but Mordekhai bowed to Haman and the idol he had with him. I agree, that Mordechai refused to bow to Haman (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3.5?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 3:5</a>) in Adar, because as a consequence on 1st of Nisan  Haman and Harvona threw dice (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3.7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 3:7</a>). However, the quoted words of Haman \"all of that does not have value for me\" is similar to the reaction of the Jews to the Golden Calf just days after Sinai revelation, after getting <em>manna</em> and <em>slav</em> in the desert, after splitting of the Sea and destruction of the Pharaoh's army, after geula from Mitzrayim and after 10 plagues.</p>\n<p>As far as the month of Adar, we use the letters of the last words of the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.11?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 49:11</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֹסְרִ֤י לַגֶּ֙פֶן עיר<strong>ה</strong> [עִיר֔וֹ] וְלַשֹּׂרֵקָ֖<strong>ה</strong> בְּנִ֣<strong>י</strong> אֲתֹנ֑<strong>וֹ</strong> כִּבֵּ֤ס בַּיַּ֙יִן֙ לְבֻשׁ֔וֹ וּבְדַם־עֲנָבִ֖ים סותה [סוּתֽוֹ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which speaks about wine and final recognition of Yehudah.

The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.10b.26?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 10b</a>*, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.39b.5?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 39b</a>**) says that when the Egyptians drowned in the Sea of Reeds, God prevented the angels from singing songs of praise because “His handiwork was drowning in the sea.” The Taz (Orach Chaim 490:3), Chavot Yair (225) and Or HaChaim (on Exodus 13:17) conclude from that that a full Hallel cannot be said on the last 6 days of Pessah.</p>\n\n<p>Why, in both cases?  Isn't not reciting a full Hallel equivalent to telling God: \"You could have done better, so we are toning down thanks and praise\"?  Is this the proper attitude?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Re Purim as @DonielF said \"The Rambam paskens like Rav Nachman that the Megillah takes the place of Hallel (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Scroll_of_Esther_and_Hanukkah.3.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Chanukah 3:6</a>)\".</p>\n<p>Re Pesach, the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.10a.14-10b.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arachin 10</a>) writes the reason is because there is no special Mussaf offerings (see this <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/5712/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OU article</a>).</p>\n<p>But even within the reasons you quoted. It was our fault, not Hashem's. Regarding Purim, we didn't merit that it would lead to any open miracles (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.4a.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'rachot 4a</a>). Regarding the Egyptians drowning, Hashem also killed the Egyptian firstborns on the first day of Pesah and didn't let the Angels sing (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Beha%27alotcha.2.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar B'haalot'cha 149a</a>), yet we say double hallel in the Seder (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.118a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesahim 118a</a>). Edot Hamizrah also say full Hallel in Arvit. The death of the Egyptians isn't THE reason. I think it is because the killing of the Egyptians at the sea caused the Jews to take all their gold, which they were a bit too excited about (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi%20on%20Isaiah%209:2:4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Y'shaya 9:2</a>) and that led to the golden calf (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.32.31.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Sh'mot 32:31</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

Thank you for making me realize that I had no idea where it actually comes from.</p>\n\n<p>It gets intricate, so buckle up. I tried to explain it below, but just let me know if I should explain further.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.77b.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos 77b</a>, the Gemara derives that any loaf brought must be exactly one tenth-eiphah. It's a long, convoluted exposition, so I'll just quote the bottom line:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תלמוד לומר (ויקרא כג, יז) ממושבותיכם תביאו לחם תנופה שתים שאין תלמוד לומר תביאו ומה תלמוד לומר תביאו שכל מה שאתה מביא ממקום אחר הרי הוא כזה מה להלן עשרון לחלה אף כאן עשרון לחלה אי מה להלן שני עשרונות אף כאן שני עשרונות תלמוד לומר תהיינה למדנו עשרה לחמץ עשרה למצה מנין תלמוד לומר (ויקרא ז, יג) על חלות לחם חמץ נגד חמץ הבא מצה נמצאו עשרים עשרונות לחמי תודה עשרה לחמץ ועשרה למצה</p>\n  \n  <p>The passuk says (Vayikra 23:17 [regarding the Two Loaves brought on Shavuos]), \"From your dwelling places you will bring the bread of waving – two.\" The passuk does not need to say \"you will bring.\" Why does it say \"you will bring\"? [To teach] that anything which you bring from another place, it must be like this: just as there, it's one tenth-eiphah per loaf, so, too, here, one tenth-eiphah per loaf. But [maybe we should expound] just as there it [totals] two tenth-eiphahs, so, too, here, two tenth-eiphahs! The passuk says, \"they shall be.\" We have learned ten for the chametz; how do we know ten for the Matzah? The passuk says (Vayikra 7:13), \"for loaves of leavened bread\" – corresponding to the Chametz, you should bring Matzah. We have found that twenty tenth-eiphas are the loaves of the Todah: ten for the Chametz and ten for the Matzah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.78a.1?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Menachot.78a.1.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">78a</a>) explains the exposition from \"they shall be\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב יצחק בר אבדימי תהיינה כתיב אימא עשרה קפיזי אמר רבא בעשרונות דבר הכתוב</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Yitzchak bar Avdimi said, תהיינה is written. Maybe it's ten half-kav [a much smaller amount]? Rava said, the passuk is talking about tenth-eiphahs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תהיינה - בתרין יודין דחד יו\"ד דמייתר אתיא ללחמי תודה:</p>\n  \n  <p>תהיינה – with two yud's: the extra yud comes for the loaves of the Todah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The last step is the remaining twenty loaves. The Gemara explains (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.77b.16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">77b</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יכול עשרה שבמצה לא יהו כולן אלא ממין אחד תלמוד לומר (ויקרא ז, יב) אם על תודה יקריבנו והקריב על זבח התודה חלות מצות בלולות בשמן ורקיקי מצות משחים בשמן סלת מרבכת וגו' נמצאו שלשה עשרונים ושליש לכל מין ומין ושלש חלות לעשרון</p>\n  \n  <p>I might have thought that the ten Matzah loaves are only from one type; the passuk says (Vayikra 7:12): \"If he brings it as a Todah, he will bring for the Todah offering loaves of Matzos kneaded with oil, and cakes of Matzos spread with oil, of poached fine flour.\" It comes out that there are 3 1/3 tenth-eiphahs for each type, and three loaves per tenth-eiphah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, as the Gemara concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונמצאו לחמי תודה ארבעים</p>\n  \n  <p>It comes out that the Todah loaves are forty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A slave is responsible for mitzvos like a woman. However, Haman had a computer. It's not that his computer was broken. It's just that all computers are intrinsically bad, like the pasuk in Mishlei (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.24.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">כד:ח</a>) tells us.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מְחַשֵּׁ֥ב לְהָרֵ֑עַ - A computer is for evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why are they evil?

Probably because they're so distracting. If you're on the computer, you will end up missing out on mitzvos. </p>\n\n<p>So therefore, the whole time Haman was in possession of a computer, he was unable to do mitzvos! We know because of the rule of כל ישראל ערבים זה לזה that Esther and Haman (who both had the same חיוב in mitzvos) were responsible to make sure each other was fulfilling them. Since Haman had a computer and wasn't doing any mitzvos, Esther was responsible to get rid of it. Therefore, she asked Achasveirosh for the computer, not because it was broken so she could fix it, but rather to destroy it, so Haman could get back to doing mitzvos.</p>\n\n<p>(considering all this, I should probably get off my computer now...)</p>\n\n\n",

In the case of Mordecai's decree it likely would have been rolled out upon a clay tablet by a engraved ring, stone or urn and then distributed throughout the 127 provinces of Persia. Thus this \"lot\" or seal would have been sort of an ancient printing press if you will from which the earlier decree of Haman was effectively annulled. Xerxes signet was taken from Haman and given to Mordecai. (Esther 8:2) The actual practice of the casting of lots would go back I believe also to the Aaronic priesthood and Urim and the Thummim of Exodus 28:30 in communicating with and understanding the will of the Creator.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>1</strong> - See the article <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/8299\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Playing the Lottery</a> by Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein from his <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/this_week/whats_in_a_word/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's in a Word</a> series. Much of the article delves into use of the word <strong>פור</strong> and its meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> -  <em>I will present some ideas below - some of which possibly overlap with that article:</em></p>\n<p>The fundamental two letters of the word Purim are <strong>פר</strong> being the flip side of <strong>רפ</strong> which is a very critical part of the backstory of Purim - the original מלחמת עמלק at <strong>רפידים</strong> from the end of פרשת בשלח and its associated connotations in Chazal of <strong>רפיון ידים</strong> - a sense of weakness.</p>\n<p>These two letters in their original sequence of פר can also be interpreted as a type of weakness that we must utterly destroy in connection to Haman’s use of \"פור הוא הגורל\".  The following Mishna and Gemara indicate that חלש has a meaning of פור or גורל and when taking מפרשים in Yeshaya into account, a possible additional hint to Amalek.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>משנה שבת כג:ב</strong> - ומטילין <strong>חלשים</strong> על הקדשים ביום טוב</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>גמ' שבת קמט:</strong> - מַאי מַשְׁמַע דְּהַאי <strong>\"חֲלָשִׁים\"</strong> לִישָּׁנָא <strong>דְפוּרָא</strong>\nהוּא? — דִּכְתִיב:\n(ישעיה יד:יב) \"אֵיךְ נָפַלְתָּ מִשָּׁמַיִם הֵילֵל\nבֶּן שָׁחַר נִגְדַּעְתָּ לָאָרֶץ <strong>חוֹלֵשׁ</strong> עַל גּוֹיִם\" וְגוֹ׳,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ראב\"ע ישעיה יד:יב</strong> - חולש. כמו (שמות יג:יז) \"<strong>ויחלש</strong> יהושע\" , ויש אומר\n<strong>מפיל גורלות</strong> כטעם (יחזקאל כא:כו) \"קלקל בחצים\" וגוֹ׳'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>רד\"ק</strong> שם - <strong>חולש</strong>. כמו <strong>ויחלש</strong> יהושע.....ורז\"ל פי' כי <strong>חולש מפיל\nגורל</strong>, כמו שאמר מטילים <strong>חלשים</strong> על הקדשים בי\"ט</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aside from the several times the word פור is mentioned in the Megilla, related words seem to appear such as here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(ישעיהו כד:יט) רֹעָה הִתְרֹעֲעָה הָאָרֶץ <strong>פּוֹר הִתְפּוֹרְרָה</strong> אֶרֶץ מוֹט הִתְמוֹטְטָה אָרֶץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to be the consensus of the major מפרשים that this is a לשון חלקים \\ חלוקה. The word family starting with <strong>פר</strong> branches into several forms noting <strong>division</strong> or <strong>breaking/spreading afar into many parts</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is also connected to the wording <strong>הפרה</strong> which we see in connection with נדרים where it acts as a <strong>nullification or ביטול</strong> while the opposite action is a קיום.  We see this language fleshed out in the first line of the פיוט said after reading the Megilla:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲשֶׁר הֵנִיא עֲצַת גּוֹיִם, <strong>וַיָּפֶר</strong> מַחְשְׁבוֹת עֲרוּמִים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have wondered whether the connection between <strong>פר</strong> and a לשון of weakness/breaking apart might be connected to the words ע<strong>פר</strong> and א<strong>פר</strong>, representing a breakdown of something that was originally large into tiny specs.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough one can sense a very rich multitude of words in the Megilla that have both letters <strong>פ,ר</strong> such as: פרס, פרתמים, תפארת, כרפס, רצפת, ספר, פור, מפזר, מפרד, אחשדרפנים, אפר, פרשת, פרשנדתא, פורתא, פרמשתא, פרזים, פורים.</p>\n\n\n",

For instance, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=49968#p=115&fitMode=fitheight&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Elisha Galiko writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד אני מדקדק שכתב את בכל אחד ואחד לומר כי כל אחד מהם היה כחמש מאות איש הידועים ההרוגים עם היות שהיו כולם חשובים ושרים</p>\n  \n  <p>And I infer further that it writes את by each one to say that each one was like the 500 known men who were killed, in that they were all important and officers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, of all of Haman's wives, it's Zeresh that he repeatedly turns to in the Megillah for advice; while he also calls other family and friends, Zeresh is the only one who's singled out. She's not the only one who actually gives advice, and she's singled out even before anyone opens their mouths. Maybe Haman singles her out because she's the most important of his wives... and maybe Haman's ten sons who were so important were specifically her children?</p>\n\n<p>Am I totally off-base here, or is there any merit to this line of logic?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can the Passover seder be held on a different night during the week to satisfy family constraints?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know many families have both a first night seder and a second night seder with a separate set of guests. How flexible is this? If a family has travel constraints, could they just have a 5th night seder, while following the other laws for the whole period?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><em>Halacha</em> requires that one have a <em>seder</em> with certain elements on the evening of Pesach, meaning the first night (and second in the diaspora).  An <a href=\"https://www.aish.com/h/pes/l/48968741.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">article from Aish HaTorah</a> lists the mitzvot that are obligatory then:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are actually seven different mitzvot that we perform at the Seder. Two are from the Torah:</p>\n  \n  <p>1) telling the Exodus story\n  2) eating matzah</p>\n  \n  <p>The other mitzvot are rabbinical:</p>\n  \n  <p>3) eating Marror (bitter herbs)</p>\n  \n  <p>4) eating the Afikomen (an extra piece of matzah for dessert as a reminder of the Passover offering)</p>\n  \n  <p>5) saying Hallel (Psalms of praise)</p>\n  \n  <p>6) drinking the Four Cups of wine</p>\n  \n  <p>7) demonstrating acts of freedom and aristocracy ― e.g. sitting with a pillow cushion and leaning as we eat and drink, and beginning the meal \"with a dip.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/seasonal/359/the-pesach-seder/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">guide from Star-K</a> includes more details (with citations) of the <em>halacha</em>, including timing.  All of this takes as given that you will hold the <em>seder</em> on that night; the timing details are about how early or late you can do things, not about deferring to another day.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's nothing that says your <em>seder</em> needs to be a big, elaborate thing.  I've heard of people who couldn't go to a larger family gathering who just made a small one at home with just a couple people.  If your family can't gather until later, don't <em>skip</em> the obligations of the first night(s) -- do something then, and if you want to do something else later, you can.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you're holding a <em>seder</em>-like gathering other than on the first night(s), you need to be careful to avoid making blessings in vain.  The fifth night of Pesach isn't <em>yom tov</em>, so making <em>kiddush</em> then would be inappropriate.  Similarly, some of the other <em>b'rachot</em> refer to obligations that you will not actually have on that night.  Consult your rabbi for what specific changes you need to make.  But since the main point of the <em>seder</em> is to tell the story, you can still have a meaningful gathering even if it's not actually a <em>seder</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

He was the leader of Israel at the time, and it was in his power to suspend a matter of Torah law through inaction, in times of need (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torah_Temimah_on_Esther.4.16.1?vhe=Torah_Temimah,_Vilna,_1904&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Temima on Ester 4:16</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.50?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei D'Rebbi Eliezer 50</a>).</p>\n<p>So, Ester was saying, show some leadership and chutzpa: Hashem, without Jews, there is no Pesach, so now that you have suspended a decree of annihilation over our head, we will forgo the joyful mitzva of Pesach, and afflict ourselves, praying that You abolish the decree so we can have another Pesach with You next year and continue to serve You for all time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My grandfather, Rav Eliezer ben David (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=67284&st=&pgnum=85\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eleh Moadei 10</a>) writes the reason was to rectify not listening to the Hachamim by going to the feast of Ahasuerus when they did not understand his reasoning. Now they had to listen to him when his reasoning was even more confounding.</p>\n<p>In his view \"not listening\" is one of the 2 root character traits of Amalek, the other being love of money (see further in Eleh Moadei and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135511/24781\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This answer is not a \"traditional\" answer and not for the faint of heart, it follows what's called \"דרך העבודה\" in my Rabbi Moshe Luria's Z\"L tradition (the idea is mine). <em>The answer is trying to consolidate numerous phenomena found in our sources (and a lot of my questions) into one solid picture.</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Background info:</strong> Two luminaries were created and The Moon complained and was diminished and it only has the light that the Sun shines on it. So a יממה is divided into יום ולילה, day governed by the Sun and night governed by the Moon. So the Sun is metaphorically compared to Hashem and the Moon to Am Israel (see Birkas Halevonah). The same pattern is true for Jewish history, where some times are compared to the day and some to the night.</p></li>\n<li><p>Hashem's revelation (גילוי שכינה) (the daytime, בחי' ז\"א) time spanned from the Exodus and through the first Temple, as long as there was the prophecy. When Binyomin met Yosef he cried on his neck(S) hinting on the destruction of the two Temples (M\"R) and thus hinting on the fact that the \"daytime\" will not be permanent and the era of the nighttime (חושך, בחי ב\"ז, מלכות) will follow the destruction of the first Temple. This is pronounced in the Tfilos ofShabbos when we say \"בה\" in the evening time, \"בו\" in the daytime and \"בם\" at Minchah\".</p></li>\n<li><p>The Meggila says \"קיימו וקבלו\", Pirush, \"<em>started to observe what they received long time ago</em>\", hinting on the fact that the Jews did not accept the Oral Torah from Mt. Sinai to Purim, and indeed we don't see Chachamim and Halachic debates throughout all this time. The explanation for this would be simple - as long as there was the \"Godly light\" in the form of the prophecy, there was no use of the \"human wisdom\", in the words of the Gemmorah in Hulin \"שרגא בטיהרא מאי מהני\". In other words, Chachamim's wisdom would not be recognizable in the light of the prophecy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ultimately, a new era of lights-out begun, and there weren't so much Chachamim (which explains my question \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101215/where-was-the-sanhedrin-in-the-purim-story\">where-was-the-sanhedrin-in-purim</a>\"). So Mordechai and Ester were pretty much on their own when deciding on the continuation of Am Israel after Haman's decree. And there were two ways to resolve the Gzerah: Mordechai actually proposed to follow the \"traditional way\", to make use of Pesach to facilitate G-d's redemption, to observe it with great Kavanah and let G-d shine His lights to get His people out of trouble. But Ester thought differently.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ester learned from Moses that broke the Luchos, that the rebuilding of the nation from the aspect of the (the Moon - the Chachamim) can come only from the lowest point, of being cut off completely from Hashem (the New Moon - the total absence of light). To achieve that she offered not only to cancel Pesach with all the Kavonos, but to deliberately stop eating for 72 hours which is a certain \"anti-Halachic\" danger (see my other question \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101081/how-the-72-hours-straight-fast-was-possibly-allowed\">how-the-fast-was-allowed</a>\") and thus showing Hashem that <em>כביכל</em> we don't need His help, we can stand on our own. </p></li>\n<li><p>The claim was so powerful that Mordechai decided to follow it.  And this is the main reason the whole Meggilah is called Ester after her \"revolutionary\" decision. And that's all - no miracles (as I asked here \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101195/what-miracles-occurred-on-purim\">what-miracle-occurred-on-purim</a>\"). The whole point of the decree was not to exterminate the nation (which is impossible) but to see if they are mature enough to begin the era of the light of the Chachamim - following their own decrees (בחי' לא בשמים היא), to be able to  institute their own laws that directly contradict the Heavenly law (see R\"E and the Sages in תנורו של עכנאי - that G-d admitted \"נצחוני בניי\").</p></li>\n<li><p>In continuation to that, they were able to build \"their\" Temple, the Temple where the 5 major attributes were missing and that was held by the people's unity (שנחרב על שנאת חינם) and not by G-d's will (like the first one).</p></li>\n<li><p>It should be noted that the change (from one Bechinah to another in #1) wasn't immediate, and Mordechai's general approach remained relevant through Bet Shammai and later by its followers like R\"E and to some point R' Yehoshua for the whole period of the Second Temple. I would dare to claim that the Sadducees (and the current Karaites and Shomronim) were/are actually the followers of the First Temple tradition that did not accept the second Bechinah of Chahamim and their possible control over the Heavenly Torah and the changes they set in the Oral Law.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>(for the Kabbalah lovers)</em> <sub> I think that was the בחינה of נסירה and the following פב\"פ which is articulated in Ester coming from the front of Achashverosh (answering my other question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101248/why-should-ester-come-from-the-front-instead-from-the-back-of-achashverosh\">here</a>) as נוק' which is fully grown and can stand as a separate entity (as in Adam story).</sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>A personal request - this question offers a wide-angle view on the evens spanning thousands of years and behaviors of G-d and the whole nation in the tradition of \"דרך העבודה\". I am sure it is not widely known and accepted and even contradicts many mainstream commentators and Poskim.

    "content": "# How does Rav Saadia Gaon account for the suffering of children?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I came across <a href=\"http://www.mesora.org/SaadiaGaon-Reincarnation.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this excerpt from Rav Saadia Gaon on reincarnation</a> (on mesora.org, where they cite it as Saadia Gaon: “The Book of Beliefs and Opinions” “Refutation of Reincarnation” Yale Judaica Series, Vol. I “The Soul” chap. VIII pp 259\") and I'm having trouble understanding part of what he's saying. For context, in the excerpt, Rav Saadia Gaon strongly objects to those who consider reincarnation to be an authentic part of Judaism. In it, he identifies one of the arguments made by proponents of belief in reincarnation as being that the suffering of small children is inconceivable given the idea that God is just, unless their soul had sinned in a previous life. (Setting aside how that could actually work, for the purposes of this question.)</p>\n\n<p>Within the excerpt, Rav Saadia Gaon refutes this in two ways, with the first refutation being that people get compensated in the afterlife for suffering in this world. (Again, setting aside whether that would actually make the suffering itself morally justified, for the purposes of this question.) So I understand that part. But then, it's Rav Saadia Gaon's second refutation I'm having trouble making sense of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Furthermore we should like to ask [proponents of belief in reincarnation] what they conceive the original status of the soul to be – we mean its status when it is first created. Is it charged by its Master with any obligation to obey Him or not? If they allege that it is not so charged, then there can be no punishments for it either, since it was not charged with any obligations to begin with. If, on the other hand, they acknowledge the imposition of such a charge, in which case obedience and disobedience did not apply before, they thereby admit that God charges His servants with obligations on account of the future and not at all on account of the past. But then they return to our theory and are forced to give up their insistence on the view that man’s suffering in this world is due solely to his conduct in a previous existence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is Rav Saadia Gaon getting at with statements about whether a soul initially is charged with obligations, and what is his subsequent reasoning on that? Is he simply suggesting that people are punished for their future crimes? And if so, why bother with that suggestion at all when it wouldn't cover all circumstances (in particular, small children who suffer and do not survive long enough to sin), when his earlier suggestion (that compensation in the afterlife makes it justifiable to cause children to suffer) would apply to more circumstances?</p>\n\n<p>My best attempt at understanding what he said is that the only way a soul could be subject to punishment for sins is if at one point an obligation is imposed on the soul for the future, and if an obligation can be made now for future actions, then God interacts with the soul at one point based on something in the future, so we should just say that it can also be punished at one point based on future actions. Is that what he's saying, did I miss part of the reasoning, or am I totally off the mark?</p>\n\n\n",

Let me explain.</p>\n\n<p>The events in Esther occurred over the Passover. While Haman the Agagite relied on the timing of the divination of dice, or the <em>purim</em>, Esther had banked on the timing of Passover. In other words, the day that Haman hanged on the gallows was the turning point in the Exodus narrative, when the fate of the Egyptian army was cast (like <em>purim</em>, or dice) by Pharaoh, who decided to pursue the Jews. Remember, Esther delayed the disclosure of her petition to King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) by one day (until the 17th of Nisan), because this was the precise date for the turning point day in the Exodus narrative, when the fate of Pharaoh's army was \"cast.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please remember:</strong> Haman first announced the proclamation of the destruction of the Jews on the eve of the Day of Preparation, which is the 13th of Nisan (which is the eve of Passover).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=esther%203%3A12&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Esther 3:12</strong></a><br>\n  <sup>12</sup> Then the king’s scribes were summoned on <strong><em>the thirteenth day of the first month</em></strong>, and it was written just as Haman commanded to the king’s satraps, to the governors who were over each province and to the princes of each people, each province according to its script, each people according to its language, being written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet ring. (<em>emphasis added</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the story starts on Passover! From this point in the narrative until the end of Chapter 7, the events in the Book of Esther span the Passover meal on the Jewish calendar (14-21 Nisan). That is, the Law of Moses had commanded the Passover meal and then the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. However, Esther invoked a fast instead. The three days of Esther's fast are remarkable because they coincide with the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt. If this hypothesis is correct, then Esther may have chosen three days to fast because that was the time that Moses requested from Pharaoh as the time necessary needed to worship (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%205%3A3&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exod 5:3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%208%3A27&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exod 8:27</a>). If this hypothesis is correct, the three days of fasting by Esther and the Jews was their worship time. The following graph depicts the Passover in relation to the decisive day when the fate of the Egyptians was cast (like <em>purim</em> or dice) three days after Passover.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y9WZe.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/y9WZe.png\" alt=\"This graph depicts the 14-17 of Nisan, which were the dates that Moses led the Jews out of Egypt and Pharaoh made his fateful decision, which was the turning point of the Exodus narrative for the fate of the Egyptian army.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Esther fasted during the 14-16 Nisan, and prepared her banquet for the king on the late afternoon of the 16 Nisan. (As noted, she and her fellow Jews would therefore not have eaten the Passover nor have partaken of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.) The late afternoon would mark the end of her fast for three days \"night or day\" according to <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=esther%204%3A16&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 4:16</a>. At this very point in the Book of Esther (when she gives the first banquet) appears the following verse.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=esther%205%3A7&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 5:7</a></strong> (NASB)<br>\n  <sup>7</sup> So Esther replied, “My petition and my request is <strong>[. . . .]</strong><br>\n  (<em>ellipses added for emphasis</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the Hebrew text, she does not finish the thought of the sentence. This verse is PIVOTAL (the turning point), because it occurs in the very center of the Book of Esther <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/VamvX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according to the endnotes of the Masoretic Text</a>, which is found at the top of <a href=\"http://www.seforimonline.org/seforimdb/pdf/264.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Page 932 of the PDF version online</a>. <strong>This verse is in the very middle of the book, and so is the literary \"hidden miracle\" or TURNING POINT in the narrative.</strong> This verse is also the day that Esther breaks her fast, which occurs on the Festival of First Fruits, when a sheave offering was waived before the Lord in anticipation of his blessing to the Jews. Fifty from this date was when God gave the Law to the Jews at Sinai according to the Babylonian Talmud (<em><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gG9xE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesahim</em>, Folio 68B</a>). In other words, these very days portended very ominous spiritual power, but in the favor of the Jews. This was the apparent \"script\" followed by Esther.</p>\n\n<p>If the foregoing paragraphs are correct, then Esther was following the \"script\" of the Exodus narrative. While there is no explicit mention of God (or even prayer) in the Book of Esther, it is very evident that Esther relied on the literal Torah (the Word of God as divine revelation) as her guide through the darkness of an imminent holocaust event. She met spiritual darkness with the divine power of the Word of God as typified in the Exodus narrative. In this regard, she postponed her petitions to King Ahasuerus (Xerxes), because the following day was the 17th of Nisan, which was the fateful (turning point) day when God had ordained the destruction of the army of Pharaoh, who was the enemy of the Jews. This is the logic of the apparent \"script\" followed by Esther.  She did not know what tomorrow would portend, but she knew the \"die would be cast\" according to the Exodus \"script\": that is, the following day would somehow have to be the very day that God would ordain the destruction of arrogant Haman.  <strong><em>And that is what happened.</em></strong></p>\n\n<h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1>\n\n<p>The Book of Esther revolves around the timing of Passover and its significance as the \"hidden miracle\" for the demonstration of the power of God. This divine power destroys not only the enemies of the Jews, but also defeats the wicked spiritual powers behind them. Haman relied on dice (<em>purim</em>) to divine the most auspicious time to destroy the Jews, and implied here was divination, or reliance on outside wicked spiritual power. The Torah and Psalms are replete with references to defeating \"the gods of the Egyptians\" during the Exodus narrative (see <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2033%3A4&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num 33:4</a> for example), and of course, as many, many scholars have observed, the ten plagues of Moses appeared to be in direct confrontation with Egyptian deities, or wicked spiritual powers. </p>\n\n<p>In the same way, following the same \"script,\" Esther's faith had demonstrated that complete reliance and trust in the Torah (Exodus narrative) was sufficient power to defeat the Jew's enemies and the wicked spiritual powers behind them. Prayer and God are never mentioned in any explicit terms in the Book of Esther, but the \"script\" of the Exodus narrative is very pronounced as the fate of Haman (and Pharaoh's army) was cast that fateful day of the 17th of Nisan, and that is the \"hidden miracle\" of <em>Purim</em> (the casting of fate).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In his introduction to Pirkei Avot, Rambam famously explains that all miracles are actually just pre-programmed into nature, so basically, they are all natural (or, more deeply, all of nature is a miracle). In Mishneh Torah, Yesodai Hatora 8:1, the Rambam strongly explains how a miracle is not meant to be there to enhance our belief in God.</p>\n<p>So, in order to explain my answer, I have to disagree with your definition of \"miracle\" in the question.</p>\n<p>The Torah idea of a miracle isn't the same as we understand the english word \"miracle\". The word is \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.21.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&lookup=%D7%A0%D6%B5%D6%91%D7%A1&with=Lexicon&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nes</a>\", which means \"banner\" or \"sign\". The connotation is that Hashem is raising a flag. When something happens, <em>in nature</em>, that points a finger to something Hashem wants us to see, that is a sign, a banner of His involvement, a נס.</p>\n<p>As I heard from my Rav in shul this shabbat, the Maharal (חידושי אגדות - שבת כ״א:ד״ה כשנכנסו יוונים להיכל) talks about two types of נס. A Nes Nigle - an open miracle, and a Nes Nistar - a hidden miracle. This helps us understand something we say 3 or more times a day in davening: וְעַל נִסֶּֽיךָ שֶׁבְּכָל־יוֹם עִמָּֽנוּ. As the Rambam said, nature and miracles are one and the same, sometimes Hashem's signs are obvious, and they break the patterns of nature (perhaps even the law of nature, according to some opinions), and some, the vast majority, are hidden, and take the eye of emuna to see and appreciate.</p>\n<p>If we continue this line of thought, Purim represented the beginning of the Jewish nation's full maturity, to escape the \"miracle\" system as part of our relationship with Hashem, and get a chance to engage in a relationship with Him without miracles, which is the ideal.</p>\n<p>The avodah in this system is to see Hashem without the crux of miracles. The Purim story is told in this fashion. There are no \"typical miracles\" (clear breaks from the normal rules of nature), but that doesn't matter, you can still see that normal, routine nature is full of signs of Hashem. The story of Purim, read with the Oral Torah's commentaries, demonstrates this in many ways, which many of the answers here have already presented (and a great link collecting them is provided in the tl;dr). There are lots of things that \"happen\", that are seemingly happenstance, but when you are a person of emuna, and know that Hashem loves and protects His people, you put all these happenings together and are meant to come to the conclusion that Hashem was there, the Elokim, Master of Nature, watching over His people.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr: a miracle means a \"sign\" in lashon hakodesh. The Purim story is <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/holidays/hidden-messages/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">full of <em>signs</em></a> of Hashem and His will. They just happen to be non-<em>miraculous</em> (english word).</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Additional thoughts/philosophisings</em></p>\n<p><em>We aren't meant to view these miracles as signs that Hashem <em>exists</em>, according to Rambam. However, I would posit that we are supposed to view these miracles as signs that He still loves us and wants us, and our convenant with Him are eternal. Clearly, this is the \"sign\" that Hashem is giving at this critical part in our history.</em></p>\n<p><em>All this was preparation for the future. The Chanuka oil marked the last obvious miracle, the last time Hashem held our hand before our big journey and mission into Galut, and ever since then, we have been plunged into a world of ceaselessly <em>normal</em> nature. As Jews, according to the Rambam, our job is to still see Hashem everywhere, in everything. Our job is to realise the true signs of Him, His love, and His greatness, which don't need no miracles to prove!</em></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Frequency of inspection at vegan restaurants\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does a vegan restaurant require a permanent mashgiach on the premises to be certified kosher?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For large factories that get a hechsher, supervision is limited to sporadic surprise inspections.  (No permanent presence of inspectors.)</p></li>\n<li><p>For meat or dairy restaurants, you need a permanent presence (mashgiach) because the temptation to cheat with meat or cheese is high, given the price differential.  But there is no such temptation in vegan food.  (I know that bugs in lettuce need to be removed, but this matters even to non-Jews, so there is no temptation to cheat.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I conclude that surprise inspections are enough to certify a vegan restaurant as kosher.  Is that the case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems to me that a constant <em>mashgiach</em> would still be required.</p>\n\n<p>For background, there are 4 main problems with a vegan restaurant without any mashgiach, as summarized from <a href=\"http://www.ok.org/ja/kosherspirit/spring-2018/keeping-kosher-ina-vegan-restaurant/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ok.org</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/547235/jewish/Are-vegan-restaurants-kosher.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chabad.org</a>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Vegetables can often have insects. The Vegan Society allows for a minute quantity of animal products to be included in food advertised as 'vegan'. That does not, however, make the food kosher.</li>\n<li>A second issue is the restaurant equipment. Many restaurants use pre-owned utensils. It is not possible to know if the equipment was only used for kosher food (also unlikely). Although there is a <em>heter</em> if the vessels were not used for 24 hours (<em>ein ben yom</em>o), that is only permissible <em>b'dieved</em>. But even with that, employees will often use restaurant equipment to prepare their own food. Therefore, even <em>ein ben yomo</em> will not help.</li>\n<li>A 3rd problem is that the food itself is likely to be <em>bishul aku</em>m. <em>Bishul akum</em> is permitted by a) food that is edible raw, and b) food that is not fit to be served by a king's table. Granted, most food will fall into either one of these categories, but other foods, like fancy potatoes, or grains and rice, will be prohibited because of <em>bishul akum</em>.</li>\n<li>Wines and grape juice need a valid <em>hechsher</em>. The restaurant may not have a wine list, but these beverages may be used as ingredients for some dishes. (I haven't found a source for this, but it is also possible that if they wine is not mevushal, there is also the problem of <em>yayin neshech</em>.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regarding factories only requiring surprise <em>mashgichim</em>, that is the exception, not the rule. A sporadic <em>mashgiach</em> only helps if we're afraid of intentional cheating in a long term scheme, in a case where if the <em>mashgiach</em> shows up unexpected he is very likely to catch them in the act. However, in the case of the vegan restaurant, (as you yourself said) we are not worried about intentional cheating, as the prices are similar (also R' Moshe's <em>heter</em> of <em>uman lo mera umnutei</em>-they won't risk their business by buying nonkosher ingredients). Because we are afraid of innocent, unintentional mistakes which may happen at any time, the restaurant will need a constant <em>mashgiach</em>.

They are alive and stand in recognition of the One who spoke and [thus brought] the world into being. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What are we to understand from this? It's a rather strange concept indeed when you get to thinking about it. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Rambam discusses this at length in Book II of <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em>. Particularly chapters 4-5 would be informative on this topic. You can read them online in the Friendlander English translation <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp091.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Chapter Four in fact opens by noting that you might find it strange at first:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>THE enunciation that the heavenly sphere is endowed with a soul will appear reasonable to all who sufficiently reflect on it; but at first thought they may find it unintelligible or even objectionable; because they wrongly assume that when we ascribe a soul to the heavenly spheres we mean something like the soul of man, or that of an ass, or ox. We merely intend to say that the locomotion of the sphere undoubtedly leads us to assume some inherent principle by which it moves; and this principle is certainly a soul. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A little later he states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The circular motion of the sphere is consequently due to the action of some idea which produces this particular kind of motion; but as ideas are only possible in intellectual beings, the heavenly sphere is an intellectual being.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And a little later:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It follows that the heavenly sphere must have a desire for the ideal which it has comprehended, and that ideal, for which it has a desire, is God, exalted be His name! When we say that God moves the spheres, we mean it in the following sense: the spheres have a desire to become similar to the ideal comprehended by them. This ideal, however, is simple in the strictest sense of the word, and not subject to any change or alteration, but constant in producing everything good, whilst the spheres are corporeal: the latter can therefore not be like this ideal in any other way, except in the production of circular motion: for this is the only action of corporeal beings that can be perpetual; it is the most simple motion of a body; there is no change in the essence of the sphere, nor in the beneficial results of its motion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These quotes should give you a taste of the general idea, but again you may want to read the chapters at length for the full experience.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think this requires a background in Aristotle's Metaphysics. In fact, this is the reason why many communities skip the first chapters of the Rambam's Code, and don't bother at all with the Guide to the Perplexed or with Rabbeinu Bachya ibn Paquda's Chovos haLvavos. As our surrounding culture has moved on from the Aristotelian worldview, these explanations aren't particularly relevant to us. And, in the eyes of some, involve spending more time learning Aristotle than is wise to do.</p>\n<p>Since I am not among that \"eyes of some\", to take the complicated and try to put it into an oversimplified nutshell:</p>\n<p>According to Artisotle's Physics, action starts with an intellect. The intellect moves an object by imparting impetus to it. Since no one had separated out the concept of friction (including air drag), there was no law of conservation of impetus; it’s not just another word for momentum. So, eventually impetus would run out, and the object would stop moving.</p>\n<p>So, Aristotle's Metaphysics -- which literally means \"Beyond Physics\" (and I think referred to the fact that it was the volume after Aristotle's Physics) -- is all about intellects. They are the unseen that make the seen things happen.</p>\n<p>The Rambam writes about angels Guide to the Perplexed 2:6, tr. Freidlander, which is flawed, but in the public domain):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have already stated above that the angels are incorporeal. This agrees with the opinion of Aristotle: there is only this difference in the names employed — he uses the term ‘Intelligences,’ and we say instead ‘angels.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to the Rambam, angels are the intellects that mediate between Divine Will and things happening on earth. He writes in his code (Yesodei haTorah 2:5-6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5: Since they [the angels] possess no body, what separates the form [of each] from the other? Their existence is not alike. Rather each one is below the level of the other and exists by virtue of its influence, one “above” the other. Everything exists by virtue of the influence of HQBH, and His Goodness. Solomon alluded to this idea in his wisdom, saying (Qoheles 5:7): “Because above the one who is high there is a watcher [and there are others higher than them].”</p>\n<p>6: The expression “‘below’ the level of the other” does not refer to height in a spatial sense like, “He is sitting higher than his colleague”. For example, when speaking about two sages, one of whom is greater than the other, we say, “one is above the level of the other.” Similarly, a cause is referred to as “above” the effect [it produces].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, to the Rambam, G-d had a Thought, which had a thought, and so on down a chain of ever more coarse intellects which eventually gets us to the highest level of angel (chayos haqodesh, in his system), down the various levels until you get to the 10th (ishim).</p>\n<p>Bereishis Rabbah (10:6-7) says that every blade of grass has a mal'akh standing over it saying \"Grow! Grow!\" In the Rambam's worldview, this is because the mal'akh is the intellect that gives the impetus to the grass for the motions within its organs for it to grow.</p>\n<p>And in his worldview, the reason why each angel can only have one task in this world is because two such processes would be two impetuses, and therefore by definition be two angels.</p>\n<p>After the ishim, we get to the sefiros (spheres). The sefiros are so coarse that they are embodied. Not in the usual material, made of one or more of the 4 elements (fire, air, water or earth) but of a fifth essence, or \"quintessence\". The outermost sphere has the stars embedded in it. Then the spheres that have each of the planets in them, and these spheres could themselves have spheres embedded in them, which have spheres embedded in them, a whole complicated system to explain why planetary motion doesn't look like a simple rotation around the earth. (Google \"epicycles\".) And similarly the sun, and finally the moon. Now we get to normal matter. But what is important here is that the Rambam's sefiros are more like what we call \"orbits\" than the stars, planets, sun and moon. The sefirah moved the kokhav; the kokhav is a thing embedded in a transparent and quintessential seferah.</p>\n<p>But we have orbits, because we live with an explanation that involves gravity and momentum. The path works because gravity and centripetal force are matched, and angular momentum is conserved. In Aristotle's description of the world, we're working with impetus. And impetus gets used up. So if the sefirah spins eternally, there must be an intellect involved replenishing the impetus.</p>\n<p>At this point, I think we have the context to more fully understand the texts <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/13438/alex\">Alex</a> cites in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/101236/1570\">his answer</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Rambam's reasoning is [seemingly] simple (to elaborate Alex's quote <em>\"...leads us to assume some inherent principle by which it moves; and this principle is certainly a soul.\"</em>): </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Nature is divided into animated and unanimated. </p></li>\n<li><p>Animated world possesses the lowest form of a soul - the Nefesh (out of נרנח\"י).

    "content": "# Can a Gentile theist be saved?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I belong to a Christian family but I could never accept the fact that God can incarnate as a human. But I do not follow all 613 commandments either. I guess nobody can. I only follow Noahide commandments and never broke them.</p>\n\n<p>Is that enough for a Gentile to be saved? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 30)\n\n<p>Judaism doesn't have a notion of \"being saved\". What we know is what is required of a righteous gentile. The Rambam (one of the greatest codifiers of Jewish law) writes explicitly (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188353/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-8.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishne Torah Hilchot Melachim 8:11</a>) that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Anyone who accepts upon himself and carefully observes the Seven\n  Commandments is of the Righteous of the Nations of the World and has a\n  portion in the World to Come.</strong> This is as long as he accepts and\n  performs them because (he truly believes that) it was the Holy One,\n  Blessed Be He, Who commanded them in the Torah, and that is was\n  through Moses our Teacher we were informed that the Sons of Noah had\n  already been commanded to observe them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So a Gentile who never broke the Noahide commandments for the right reasons has a portion in the World to Come.</p>\n\n<p>Also, and for information, not all 613 commandments apply nowadays that we don't have a Temple. R Isaiah Horowitz (the Shelah) counted there are only 369 commandments applicable today, and some only apply to specific classes of individuals (e.g., Kohanim or Leviim, men or women) or in unique circumstances (e.g., building a house). As a result there are \"only\" 270 <em>mitzvot</em> \"that every Jew is required to observe, without any particular circumstance ever having to come about\" (see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/541686/jewish/How-Many-of-the-Torahs-Commandments-Still-Apply.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for more details).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Judaism, there are several core figures that Yahweh makes covenants with: </p>\n\n<p>Noah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands. Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. “But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it. And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each human being, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being. “Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind.[Genesis 9: 1-6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[New International Version (NIV)]</p>\n\n<p>Abraham</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. [Genesis 17:7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moses</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel: ‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. [Exodus 19:3-5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Noahide covenant was with Noah and his descendants. The Abrahamic covenant was with Abraham and his descendants. The Mosaic covenant was with the descendants of Jacob. Since, in the Judaic tradition, everyone is descended from Noah, his covenant applies to everyone. The Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants are taken to apply only to Jews.</p>\n\n<p>There was also a covenant with Adam, which Adam broke, which in many Christian traditions is taken to represent the Original Sin that people must be \"saved\" from, but that concept does not exist in traditional Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

I picked out a section to study, and now I need to find a convenient resource to learn from. I don't necessarily have time to make a comprehensive study of all of the relevant commentaries and Talmud, but I do want to understand what's going on in the Mishna. I prefer resources that include English translation, and I'm open to both in-print and electronic resources.</p>\n\n<p>What resource would you recommend, and why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I have learned the entire Mishna based on the <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/YAM.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Artscroll Yad Avraham</strong></a> series in English. I also own many of the newer <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/MEL.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Artscroll Schottenstein Edition</strong></a> of the Mishna. Here are a few thoughts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I found the introductions to each tractate to be incredibly well done and useful. Just reviewing the introductions to all tractates would be in itself wonderful learning. I compared the introductions to Brachot and it is somewhat more detailed in the Yad Avraham edition</li>\n<li>The commentary in the Yad Avraham edition is very very very (!) detailed. It was too much for me when learning the text but is obviously what you want if you are interested to go in depth in certain places</li>\n<li>The translation between both is very different. Yad Avraham translates the English \"in one go\", like the Stone Chumash does, while Schottenstein has the literal translation a few words, then a few words of explanation to make it a running text, then again literal translation. Exactly as the elucidation of the Talmud Bavli you refer to. The latter (Schottenstein) is far more readable and avoids to constantly need to refer to the notes</li>\n<li>The Yad Avraham has 44 volumes, the new Schottenstein has 21. In the introduction to Schottenstein, artscroll themselves address the difference between them. They write</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Yad Avraham is an encyclopedic, in-depth commentary that presents\nmany explanations and explores nuances and complexities, raises\nquestions and cites a wide variety of works on the Mishnah and Talmud.\nIts thoroughness has won the praise of even masters of the Talmud\nthroughout the world so that those who study and benefit from the\nSchottenstein edition may turn to the Yad Avraham commentary when they\nwish to delve into the nuances of the Mishna more deeply and explore a\nwider range of comments. Thus, in effect, the two editions complement\neach other</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For someone new to Mishna study or someone who wants to participate in a communal effort without necessarily having time to make a comprehensive study of all of the relevant commentaries and Talmud, I would recommend the Schottenstein edition. It also exists now in a digital formal for iPad and Android, the entire set costs 140$ as of this writing which seems a bargain, but you can also buy individual <em>sedarim</em> (21-28$) or tractates (7$). Brachot is free to download as a trial.</p>\n<p>Moving beyond Artscroll, there is a free app (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/il/app/kehati/id1059791961?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nocker.kehati&hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google</a>) with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Kehati\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Kehati</strong></a> commentary of the Mishna, in Hebrew and English. This commentary is very popular in Israel, it is focused on simplicity and clarity rather than completeness and sources. This commentary has also been printed by <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1583300805?pf_rd_p=1581d9f4-062f-453c-b69e-0f3e00ba2652&pf_rd_r=FFK85R7QAGXC51F0KNRR\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Feldheim</a>.</p>\n<p>It is easy to try both the Kehati and Artscroll online for free (through their apps) - and decide based on individual preferences.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The classic modern Mishnah commentary was written in Hebrew by R. Pinchas Kehati, and is also available in English translation (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.eichlers.com/books/books/talmud-and-mishnah/hebrew-english-mishnah/kehati-mishnah.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>). As a bonus, there are free <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kehati/id1059791961?mt=8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nocker.kehati&hl=en_US\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Android</a> apps available which contain the entire Hebrew and English texts.</p>\n\n<p>Major advantages of this edition include a running commentary on every phrase of the Mishnah, as well as introductions to each tractate, chapter and (where necessary) <em>mishnah</em>, explaining relevant concepts before one dives in to the text of the Mishnah itself.</p>\n\n<p>The commentary is relatively concise, but (I find) provides the reader with a good understanding of at least one approach to each <em>mishnah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, where the classic commentators had different approaches in explaining a given <em>mishnah</em>, R. Kehati will present alternative opinions and explanations as an end-note to his commentary on that <em>mishnah</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>More recent entrants to English language Mishnah commentary were produced by Artscroll.</p>\n\n<p>Their first effort was the <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/YAM.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yad Avraham</a> series which contains a translation as well as in-depth commentary (culled from many of the traditional commentators) on each <em>mishnah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This was followed by the <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/MELSET.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Schottenstein</a> edition, which contains a running translation/elucidation (in the style of Arscroll's successful Schottenstein edition of the Talmud) as well as footnotes. The commentary here tends to be somewhat briefer and less comprehensive than in the earlier Yad Avraham version, but still provides a thorough understanding of the <em>mishnah</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>One final thought: If your Hebrew skills are up to it and you have had some prior exposure to learning Mishnah, you may want to try simply learning each <em>mishnah</em> with the classic commentary of R. Ovadiah miBartenura. </p>\n\n<p>I have personally learned through the whole Mishnah corpus with his commentary, and found that it is (generally) short enough to learn in a reasonable amount of time, but still provides a deeper understanding of the <em>mishnah</em> (often based on the relevant Talmudic discussions) as well as a summary of final <em>halachic</em> decisions.   </p>\n\n<p>Bartenura's commentary is published in the vast majority of editions of the Mishnah, and is also available online at <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/14284\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hebrewbooks.org</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berakhot.1.1?lang=he&with=Bartenura&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria.org</a>. I note that Sefaria appears to have a \"community\" English translation of at least some of the Mishnah together with Bartenura's commentary, but I can't vouch for the accuracy of either.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>When I first learned Mishnayos, the only translation available to me was that of Phillip Blackman. I happened to like it a lot. The goal of the translation was to make it accessible, and to provide enough understanding to equip the reader for further study.</p>\n\n<p>It provides an introduction to each Tractate, and a straight-forward translation with notes explaining or justifying finer points of translation. In his introduction, he <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9675&st=&pgnum=5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">gives</a> Rashi, Bartenura, Tosefos Yom-Tov, Tiferes Yisroel, and Hilcheta Gevirta as his sources for explanations.</p>\n\n<p>The entire collection is available on Hebrewbooks.org, in the following six volumes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/9675\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeraim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/9670\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/9674\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nashim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/9671\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nezikin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/9672\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kodashim</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/9673\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Taharoth</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

As it is stated: “Just take heed and\nguard your soul diligently lest you forget the things your eyes have\nseen, and lest they depart from your heart, for all the days of your\nlife, and you shall impart them to your children and your children’s\nchildren” (Deuteronomy 4:9), from which we derive, among other things,\nthe obligation to study Torah. And, juxtaposed to it, is the verse:\n“The day that you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb”\n(Deuteronomy 4:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later on in the daf, the second is to show that one who teaches his son Torah, the verse ascribes to him credit as if he received the Torah from Mount Horeb:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והני סמוכין מבעי ליה לאידך דריב\"ל דאמר ריב\"ל כל המלמד לבנו תורה מעלה\nעליו הכתוב כאלו קבלה מהר חורב שנאמר והודעתם לבניך ולבני בניך וכתיב\nבתריה יום אשר עמדת לפני ה' אלהיך בחורב</p>\n<p>but he requires these juxtaposed verses in order to derive another\nstatement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:\nOne who teaches his son Torah, the verse ascribes to him credit as if\nhe received the Torah from Mount Horeb. As it is stated: “And you\nshall impart them to your children and your children’s children”\n(Deuteronomy 4:9) after which it is written: “The day that you stood\nbefore the Lord your God at Horeb.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemoro deduces from this (in the words of the Sefaria translation)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda cannot derive from that same juxtaposition a\nprohibition banning one who experienced a seminal emission from\nengaging in matters of Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemoro implies that only one deduction can be made from a set of juxtaposed verses (סמוכים).</p>\n<p>Are there accepted rules for the exposition of a set of juxtaposed verses (סמוכים)?

It would seem that viewing the totality of all the reasons, the Rema concluded that the custom of a Shalom Zachor applies only to a boy and not to a girl.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here are several reasons why the Shalom Zachor applies only to a boy:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.265.12?lang=bi&with=Turei%20Zahav&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Taz 265:12</strong></a> (earlier in the piece you quoted):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וראיתי סמך אחד לזה ממדרש רבות פרשת אמור פרשה כ\"ז ר' לוי אמר משל למלך\n  שגזר ואמר כל אכסנאין שיש כאן לא יראו פני עד שיראו פני המטרונא תחילה כך\n  אמר הקב\"ה לא תביאו לפני קרבן עד שתעבור עליו שבת שאין ז' ימים בלא שבת\n  ואין מילה בלא שבת עכ\"ל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, this meal is an 'extension' of a Seudah for a Bris. Since having experienced a Shabbos is a requirement for having a Bris, we celebrate on the Shabbos as an extension of the Bris.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ספר מגדול עוז - יעב\"ץ</strong></p>\n\n<p>He paraphrases the Medrash that says the fetus is commanded in keeping the all the Mitzvos. Since Shabbos is the first Mitzvah that the baby 'encounters', a feast is made to remind him of his obligation (note that this would also apply to a woman, and while the יעב\"ץ does ask about why there isn't a 'Shalom Nekeivah', he brushes off the question by saying it applies more to men since men are obligated in more Mitzvos).</p>\n\n<p><strong>תשובות והנהגות כרך ב סימן רב</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומיהו נראה שעיקר הטעם שמשום בשבת הוא ע\"פ מה שמבואר בזוה\"ק שכל השבוע\n  מתברך משבת   קודש, ולכן יש חשיבות לשבת שלפני הנשואין או לפני מילה או\n  אפילו לפני יאהרצייט כי אז הזמן שהשפע כבר מוכן, רק יורד כל דבר בזמנו,\n  ולכן בשבת מודה אבי הבן ומשבח לה' על השפע וברכה דמילה שבא כבר אז בשבת,\n  וכל אחד בא ומברך אותו, ומסייע זכות הרבים לזכות בברכה ושפע, ומודים\n  ושמחים ומשבחים    אלקינו ית\"ש על חסדי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similar to the Taz above, R' Moshe Shternbuch says that the Shabbos before the Bris has a special holiness, and we make a gathering for people to give blessings and receive the special holiness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Admittedly, there are also several reasons (in addition to the one mentioned in the question) as to why we celebrate a Shalom Zachor that would seemingly apply to girls as well. However, in practice (at least among Ashkenazi Jews), it seems that in spite of the below reasons, we only make a Shalom Zachor for boys:</p>\n\n<p><strong>תרומת הדשן סימן רסט</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואע\"ג דמפרשי אינהו בשם ר\"ח דהיו רגילין לעשות סעודה כשנולד זכר על שנושע\n  ונמלט ממעי אמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially, this is a Seudas Hoda'ah for the child surviving the dangerous trauma of childbirth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>נפש הרב [הר' צבי שכטר שליט\"א] עמ' רמ\"ב</strong> </p>\n\n<p>In summary, a woman within the first week of giving birth is considered someone who is deathly ill, and if there is any need to be Mechalel Shabbos for her wellbeing, we do so. The Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbath.2.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Shabbos 2:3</a> writes that when desecrating Shabbos for the sick, it should be done by 'scholars and sages of Israel' (seemingly in order to stress the importance of saving a life). Once we had the scholars of the generation going over to the home of the woman who gave birth, we made it into a big party.</p>\n\n\n",

A good number of them are confirmed by modern science to not cause any (physical) harm (ex. meat and fish, leaving peeled garlic overnight).</p>\n\n<p>I can understand the two extreme approaches:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since it's because of a potential danger, if it can be confirmed that there's no danger, then there's no problem with eating it.</li>\n<li>Once Chazal instituted not to eat these foods, then even if the apparent reason is proven false, we still uphold the original prohibition; perhaps there's a different reason they didn't reveal, and even if not, it's not in our authority to overturn decrees of Chazal.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To me, the Shulchan Aruch seems to follow the former approach, as while many Rishonim pasken like the Gemara not to leave peeled garlic uncovered, the Shulchan Aruch doesn't seem to hold that it's an issue (more on that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/53208/\">here</a>). Likewise, he paskens that in areas where snakes aren't common, there's no issue of leaving drinks uncovered (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.116.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD 116:1</a>). He <em>does</em> list many other things, such as eating meat and fish together, as being dangerous (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.116.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid. §2</a>), but that wasn't known in his time to be otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>What I don't understand is the middle approach – among those which are no longer considered dangerous, some of them are forbidden, and some of them are permitted. This seems hypocritical: at the same time that they insist Gilui is fine since snakes aren't around, they refuse to eat meat with fish. (Admittedly, just my saying that is itself hypocritical.)</p>\n\n<p>What is the logic behind this approach? Is it just blind reading from the Shulchan Aruch, without any thought as to the reason behind the Halachos, or is there an actual reason behind this approach?</p>\n\n<p>(I discuss food in this post only because it seems to come up the most often; the same discussion would apply to, say, walking alone at night in a safe neighborhood.)</p>\n\n\n",

I've occasionally seen men do this in my neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>However, practically, in many neighborhoods that have one mikvah or even a few, most of these are used by women for their <em>tahara</em> that ends <em>niddah</em>. So, of course, not only can't men go when women are there, but they really shouldn't even be roaming or \"loitering\" anywhere near the mikvah at night when women are there.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, places have dedicated men's only mikva'ot so going at night to these poses no problem. I recommend that before you go at night, inquire about the mikvah's night usage.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, I have heard of some places that send men to \"dunk\" in the <em>keilim</em> mikvah - the one that's used for utensils. Apparently, this occurs somewhat more frequently than I imagined. The keilim mikvah tends to be ice cold and, honestly, not only would I not want to dunk my body in the keilim mikvah but, I wouldn't want to dunk my <em>kli</em> in that mikvah afterwards. So, somewhat aside, but, perhaps, relevant - anyone that thinks of going to a \"men's mikvah\" should ask about this. It's not always obvious if you're unfamiliar with the mikvah setup of that place, and, unfortunately, many places aren't volunteering this info.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As stated by others -- primarily it's about giving the women their own space and time.</p>\n\n<p>But furthermore -- the primary halachic grounding for men going to mikva today is the enactment of Ezra against studying Torah after a seminal emission without first going to mikvah. If someone followed that, it would make sense for them to go to mikvah in the morning, before studying Torah.</p>\n\n<p>But supposing that a man (and his wife) were on a nocturnal schedule and thus he wakes up at 9pm and wants to study Torah now, then yes following this logic that would be the time to go to mikvah.</p>\n\n\n",

Poskim discusse that but there is no prohibition (see Magen Avraham OC 239 sk1, Rambam, Tosfot, Abudarham say one must say KS afer Hamapil). You can recite KS 1000 times if you want, there is also a minhag to say KS many times and falling asleep reciting it (Rema OC 239.1, source is Rabbi Zeyira in Yerushalmi). </p>\n\n<p>2) If the question was if there is a safek i you already recited hsmapil. Out of birkat Hatora (see for instance Baer Heytev oc 47 sk1) and bircat hamazon (and and emet veyatsiv for people who don't say vayomer, berachot 20a, this is a problem of Safek derabanan lekula) all berachot are only chyuv miderabsnan. In case of safek, you cannot recite the beracha. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi in Berachot 2a says that if you prayed Arvit before the night, you can use KS al hamita as mitsva. And Rashba says that people who were praying before the night did say a beracha before reciting KS al hamita, this Beracha is in the Siddur Rav Amram Gaon, and in Tosfot Rabbi Yehuda HaChasid. This is another beracha, not Hamapil. </p>\n\n\n",

The concern for the latter impingement of the efficacy of the offering gives rise to limitations on the acceptance of voluntary donations to those from donors whom we can be sure are wholeheartedly donating to the public and not retaining ownership of the money or the animal therewith purchased. (<em>Aruch Hashulchan, Hilchos Sh'kalim</em> 83)</p>\n\n<p>The procedure for collecting the donations is described in <em>mishna</em> (<em>Sh'kalim</em> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Shekalim.1.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:3</a>) and elsewhere as involving</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>tax collectors collecting <em>sh'kalim</em> locally - outside of Y'rushalayim/outside of Israel - or</p></li>\n<li><p>counters set up in and outside Y'rushalayim with one-way labeled collection boxes gathering coins for particular uses in the <em>mikdash</em>, including public offerings.

The fact that the authorities in charge of collecting the <em>sh'kalim</em> wouldn't accept them from some people implies that there was some screening at the time of payment and anonymous tossing of coins into the boxes would be impossible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is this accounting done, given the need to know a lot about the sources of the money</strong> and at risk of invalidating one or more public offerings? I've done a fair amount of conjecturing of my own (See below.) but I am looking for a detailed description based on more than conjecture - either solidly inferential or historical and corroborating or denying my assumptions above - such that I can picture/one could execute the procedure.</p>\n\n<p>E.g. Do we start with census data to tell the tax authorities who is subject, keep a written record of who reports (and authenticates) for donation, then compare them? How does that account for the screening step? Or is there no need for a screening because of an administrative corrective procedure at some point to conditionally replace/buy any money that may have come from invalid sources with valid money?</p>\n\n\n",

Does this mean someone with moles is of lower value and less holy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Sefer HaChinuch explains (§286):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שרש המצוה נגלה, עם מה שהקדמנו למעלה, בענין הקרבנות על צד הפשט, שהם לעורר ולכון מחשבת בני איש אל השם ברוך הוא, כי האדם מתפעל בכח מעשיו, על כן ראוי על כל פנים להיות הקרבן בלי מום, כי מזמות בן אדם לא ינוחו ולא יתפשטו במין הפחות כמו בחשוב, כי הלבבות יתעוררו בחשוב ובשלם במינו יותר, וזה דבר ידוע לכל מבין.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For background, in §16, the Chinuch sets down a fundamental principle he applies in many (most?) of the Mitzvos from that point on: a man is influenced by his actions, so many Mitzvos were given in order that a person feel a certain way (about himself, about others, etc.), or be motivated in a certain way. </p>\n\n<p>Based on this, he sets forth another foundation when he discusses the purpose of the Beis HaMikdash and Karbanos in §95: Rather than Hashem gaining anything from our Karbanos (which is impossible), it is <em>we</em> who gain from it. He discusses specifically what each type of Karban is meant to accomplish in great depth, but the main idea is that each one represents that one is willing to give himself over to Hashem, with the animal being a symbol for himself. </p>\n\n<p>With these foundations, what he says here in §286 should be self-evident. If you’re trying to draw close to Hashem, how can one bring an inferior animal? One will be drawn after Him more greatly if he shows its importance to him by bringing a better animal; if he brings a blemished one, he shows that it’s worthless to him. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the hearts are aroused in thought and in wholeness with a better specimen. This is known to anyone who can reason. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, the Chinuch writes a similar reason in §277 regarding that the <em>Kohanim</em> can’t be blemished, in that case to increase the perceived importance of the Beis HaMikdash, for the same reasons as above:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משרשי המצוה. להגדיל כבוד הבית והדרה על כן אין ראוי לבוא שם בעל מום, כי הוא מקום השלמות, אינו בדין לעמד שם מי שיש בו שום חסרון. וכבר כתבתי למעלה (מצוה צה) הרבה פעמים התועלת הנמצא לנו בהגדילנו מעלת הבית הקדוש ותפארתו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The source for the idea that even a minute amount of a nick(kol shehu) is problematic is from the gemara itself. The gemara in Chullin 17 brings Amoraim who check the knives with the sun ,water, tip of the tongue, and with hair. These tests seemingly check for even the most minute nicks(Kol Shehu). Rav Chisda is the opinion that a nick that a nail gets stuck is an issue. </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch 18:2 says that the amount of a pegima is a kol shehu(a tiny nick)[see the Tevuos Shor (6) who seems to be concerned that a small nick may turn into a bigger nick during shechita]. However ,he adds that it has to be big enough to catch a strand of hair. The Ran, Rashba, Ramban, and Rambam are all in agreement regarding a kol shehu(They hold that we don't go like Rav Chisda L'chatchila).(I do believe the Rosh is only concerned about a nail getting caught nothing less). The Bias Yosef explains that anything less then a strand of hair we aren't concerned. However, the Maharshal is machmir for even less than that and holds one should be machmir and check the knife using the sun or water test to catch even smaller nicks. The Ritva notes that the Amoraim who checked with sun, water and so on did so lchatchila ,but would agree that b'deved only a nail pegima is a problem. </p>\n\n<p>The Shach also notes that the Bach is meikel and holds only a fingernail nick is an issue, but the Shach writes that chalilah for people to be lenient ,since the minhag Yisrael is to pasul even a pegima kol shehu. However, we aren't concerned enough for a kol shehu to do a check with the sun or water ,but if it becomes known that there was a pegima kol shehu it is a problem(however, maybe in hefsed merubah there is what to rely on since there are shittos which allow it, tzarich iyun)    </p>\n\n<p>The Simla Chadasha(Lmaaseh) 18:2 writes that a kol shehu is an issue but up to a strand of hair. So it would seem that l'chatchila one should be concerned even for less than a strand of hair nick ,and b'deved one can be lenient and use a knife that does not have a strands nick nor a fingernail nick.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Were Rabbinic Laws like Muktzeh given at Sinai\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Did Rabbinic Laws such as Muktzeh exist in the time period between the receiving of the Torah and the time they were written down and institutionalised in Halacha? </p>\n\n<p>Are there different opinions on how this developed over time? Do some say that in fact all the Rabbinic laws we have today were given at Sinai as part of the Oral Law? Which were, which weren't?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>By definition, no. That is what makes those laws rabbinic. But...</p>\n\n<p>There are cases where the Talmud finds a derivation from the Torah using the principles of derashah, and then says that despite this, the law is rabbinic. The derivation is declared to be an asmachta, something to attach to. My rebbe in grade school compared it to a hook to hang your hat on. I think of an asmachta as a mnemonic tool -- the law doesn't really come from the verse, but the verse can help you remember the law.</p>\n\n<p>The Raavad has an interesting position on asmachtos. (Rabbi Avraham ben David, c. 1125 – 27 November 1198, Prevence, best known for his gloss on the Rambam's code where he generally disagrees with the Rambam's rulings. In his lifetime he worked hard at resisting the growing influence the Rambam was having on 12th cent Prevence.)</p>\n\n<p>According to the Raavad in his gloss on Hikhos Mamrim ch. 2, asmachtos were given by G-d. G-d \"Thought\" this law could be worth legislating in the right circumstances, and therefore suggests it in the Torah. However, He left it up to the rabbis to decide whether to actually decree it or not, whether the situation it would be good for arose.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a middle ground -- divrei soferim (\"the thoughts of the soferim\"), where \"soferim\" is the term used for the religious leasership during the early Second Temple period, i.e. the members of the Great Assembly. Like when Ezra is referred to as \"Ezra haSofeir\". Sometimes this category of laws is called \"divrei qabbalah\" -- the words that were received; i.e. laws enacted by an early beis din like the Great Assembly.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, divrei soferim were rabbinic laws, but where some of the rabbis were also nevi’im (prophets). While halakhah cannot be made by prophecy, at least not since Moshe, halakhos made through rabbinic means where the rabbis can \"hear\" that G-d gives His after-the-fact approval could be something more than regular rabbinic laws.</p>\n\n<p>As an example: Those who believe this is a distinct category would include Purim as divrei Soferim rather than usual rabbinic law. Some achronim rule that the obligation for women must hear megillah and the other mitzvos of Purim is rabbinic but for men it’s divrei qabbalah (to use the phrase that is usually used in the discussion of Purim). Thus, their obligation is lesser.</p>\n\n<p>So, the answer is -- rabbinic laws are created by rabbis. Some might have been suggested by G-d for the rabbis to create if and when appropriate. (According to the Raavad, and not, say, the Rambam.) And others are a bit more than rabbinic, because after they were created, G-d ratified them.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the above overlaps with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/86014/1570\">my answer to \"What is the difference between a takana and a gezera?\"</a> It is a general taxonomy of rabbinic law, as taught in a class Rabbi Yonasan Sachs. (Not the former chief rabbi, that's Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks. This is the head of the yeshiva at Lander's College and the Rabbi of the Agudah of Passaic-Clifton.) And then embellished over time.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabenu Gershom Maor Hagola says that Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi in Berayta rules against Rabbi Eliezer Ben Yaakov (it's important to say because it's an exception to the rule, generally we pasken as REBY because his Mishna is \"kav venaki\"). Ramban too in his comment writes that the Halacha is not as R.E.B.Y.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yachin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וקיי\"ל דבזה\"ז שאין מקדש, משמל וטבל מותר בקהל [י\"ד רס\"ח ס\"ב]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tiferet Israel says that nowadays, that we have no Mikdash, convert can marry a Jewish woman despite the lack of Korban. The source is in Gemara 9a.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא מעתה, האידנא דליכא קרבן לא נקבל גרים אמר רב אחא בר יעקב: (במדבר ט\"ו) וכי יגור אתכם גר אשר בתוככם... לדורותכם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If converts need a Korban to marry a Jewish (man/woman), how can they marry with Jews nowadays? Rabbi Acha Bar Yaakov learns from the verse that when we have no Mikdash, a stranger can convert, because this Halacha to convert is permanent through generations. This Gemara is reported by Bach in Y.D 268.</p>\n<p><strong>In summary:</strong> You can say to your friend that indeed Teacher's words has source in Gemara, both Rabbi Eliezer Ben Yaaqov and rabbanan say that convert must make a korban to join Jewish community at the time of Bet hamikdash. <strong>However</strong>, the Halachical conclusion of Gemara is that is not relevant nowadays, a convert is 100% truely Jew despite the lack of Korban. When Bet hamikdash will come back, he will give two Olot Haof.</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah tells us (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.30.20-21?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ex. 30:20-21</a>) that making sure to wash before serving in the Temple is a matter of life and death:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּבֹאָ֞ם אֶל־אֹ֧הֶל מוֹעֵ֛ד יִרְחֲצוּ־מַ֖יִם וְלֹ֣א יָמֻ֑תוּ א֣וֹ בְגִשְׁתָּ֤ם אֶל־הַמִּזְבֵּ֙חַ֙ לְשָׁרֵ֔ת לְהַקְטִ֥יר אִשֶּׁ֖ה לַֽיהוָֽה׃ וְרָחֲצ֛וּ יְדֵיהֶ֥ם וְרַגְלֵיהֶ֖ם וְלֹ֣א יָמֻ֑תוּ וְהָיְתָ֨ה לָהֶ֧ם חָק־עוֹלָ֛ם ל֥וֹ וּלְזַרְע֖וֹ לְדֹרֹתָֽם׃</p>\n<p>When they enter the Tent of Meeting they shall wash with water, that they may not die; or when they approach the altar to serve, to turn into smoke an offering by fire to the LORD, they shall wash their hands and feet, that they may not die.

There are many details of the service about to be performed that the kohanim could remind ash-clearer of, including the location to deposit the ash (described later in this mishna).

The Gemara, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.12a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 12a</a>, says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין מעברין את השנה לא משנה לחברתה ולא שלש שנים זו אחר זו אמר רבי שמעון מעשה ברבי עקיבא שהיה חבוש בבית האסורים ועיבר שלש שנים זו אחר זו אמרו לו משם ראיה ב\"ד ישבו וקבעו אחת אחת בזמנה</p>\n<p>The court may not intercalate the year from one year to another, and it does not intercalate three successive years, one directly after the other. Rabbi Shimon says: There was an incident involving Rabbi Akiva at the time when he was incarcerated in prison, and he intercalated three years, one after the other. The Sages said to Rabbi Shimon: Is there any proof from there? Rabbi Akiva merely made the calculations, but a special court sat and established each one at its time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there (first explanation) says that the question is actually about whether you can have three consecutive leap years, with the Tanna Kamma saying no and R' Shimon saying yes. According to that explanation, the maximum would be 3 according to R' Shimon and 2 according to the Chachomim.</p>\n<p>But Tosafos there finds that explanation difficult, since two consecutive leap years would also put the Yomim Tovim out of season, and so they prefer Rashi's second explanation, that the question is how many future leap years they can plan ahead for at one time. In that case, it sounds like there could never be even 2 in succession.</p>\n<p>Rabbeinu Chananel there seems to understand somewhere in between: everyone agrees you can have 3 consecutive leap years, and the argument is just whether those can be predetermined or whether they have to declare each one in its time. He gives a scenario in which you could have three consecutive leap years: suppose that in the 14th year of the machzor (which is supposed to be a leap year) there was a famine, the 15th was Shmita, and the 16th is the year after Shmita (and the Gemara there earlier says that you're not supposed to declare a leap year in such cases). Since there still need to be 7 leap years in every 19, that means they'd need to make years 17-18-19 all leap.</p>\n\n\n",

The laws regulating marriage and divorce, as developed more especially in Talmudic casuistry, often operate unjustly (see Get) and are, in view of the better provisions in the civil codes of modern nations, amended and in many respects superseded by the law of the land (see Monogamy). Woman is no longer deemed to be a minor, but is admitted to full participation in the religious life of the congregation.'  This is essentially the thought expressed in the Chumash of Reform Judaism <em>The Torah: A Modern Commentary</em> (2005) edited by Rabbi Gunther Plaut.</p>\n<p>For the changes in Conservative Judaism, see <em>Etz Hayim: Torah and Commentary</em> (2004).</p>\n<p>For Orthodox Judaism, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, former Chief Rabbi of England, in <em>Crisis and Covenant: Jewish Thought After the Holocaust</em>, states:</p>\n<p><strong>God’s Law is Unchanging, but Its Application Does Change</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Torah does not change. But in one sense, halakhah does change. For halakhah is the application of Torah to specific circumstance, and circumstances change. What then are the parameters within which the law is given to adjustment? This is Maimonides’ classic formulation:</p>\n<p>\"God knew that the judgements of the Law will always require an extension in some cases and curtailment in others, according to place, event and circumstance. He therefore forbade adding to or subtracting from the Law … but at the same time gave permission to the sages–the Great Sanhedrin–of every generation to make fences around the judgements of the Law for their protection … and similarly they have the power temporarily to dispense with some religious act prescribed in the Law or to allow that which is forbidden if exceptional events and circumstances require it … By this method the Law will remain permanently the same but yet will admit at all times and under all circumstances of such temporary modifications as are indispensable.\"</p>\n<p>So halakhah can and does change, but always to preserve the essential integrity of biblical law. We should note however that Maimonides makes a distinction that substantially tilts the balance of halakhah in the direction of conservatism. A protective decree or enactment created by the sages–a \"fence around the law\"–is permanent, whereas a suspension of the law is always only temporary.\" Rabbinic law, that is to say, has an inbuilt bias toward greater stringency over time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Who May Authorize Changes in the Application of Halakhah?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is compounded by the issue of juridical authority, hinted at in Maimonides’ reference to the Great Sanhedrin. This supreme court had considerable powers to create new law. But as its jurisdiction grew more circumscribed under Roman rule and as the center of Jewish life shifted to Babylon, Jewry was left without a central authority.</p>\n<p>According to Maimonides, after the closure of the Babylonian Talmud no one had the power to legislate for all Israel. At most, a court was able to issue rulings for its own immediate locality, although some post-talmudic rulings gained widespread acceptance. The power to create new law had lapsed. The rebirth of the state of Israel led some thinkers, most notably Rabbi Judah Leib Maimon, to advocate the reconstitution of the Sanhedrin. But this would have required broad support among Israel’s religious leaders, and it was not forthcoming.</p>\n<p>We would be wrong to conclude that there is no scope for development in Jewish law. For what cannot be achieved through legislation can sometimes be achieved through interpretation. A new problem is rarely so exactly like others in the past that precedent dictates an unequivocal answer to a halakhic query. Since there are differences in the details and circumstances, it can be argued that the extant rules do not apply to the present case. Halakhic authorities are constantly called upon to adjudicate new questions and, as we will see in due course, there have been areas in which significant changes have occurred in Jewish law in the twentieth century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Change in Jewish Law is a Reality, Not a Value</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But it would certainly be wrong to see change as a value in Jewish law. To the contrary, the central underlying proposition of the halakhah is that it articulates, within the limits of human understanding, the will of God as set forth in the Torah. Rabbinic tradition sees all valid Jewish law as inherent in the original revelation at Sinai. It is uncovered rather than made. Neither a prophet nor a sage has the authority to alter the terms of the covenant.</p>\n<p>The rabbis were emphatic in seeing their interpretations and decisions as strictly continuous with biblical precedent. As the third-century teacher Rabbi Joshua ben Levi put it, \"Bible, Mishnah, Talmud and [Aggadah], even what a senior disciple is due to teach in the presence of his master, were already stated to Moses at Sinai.\" Procedurally, therefore, any new ruling must be rendered consistent with the antecedent sources. Any departure from precedent must be temporary, justified by emergency conditions and undertaken with the express purpose of safeguarding Jewish law as a whole.</p>\n<p>Developments within the halakhic system are thus homeostatic rather than evolutionary. They are undertaken to restore equilibrium rather than to transform. Halakhah is the application of an unchanging Torah to a changing world. Halakhah changes so that the Torah should not change. (See '<a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/.../orthodox-judaism-hal...\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orthodox Judaism and Halakhah' - My Jewish Learning.com</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The main (theological) principle of the change is the switch from prophet-guided Judaism in the era of receiving the Torah to the destruction of the First Temple to Sages-guided Judaism in the times of the Second Temple.</p>\n<p>In short, during the Second-Temple era, it became widely accepted (for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pharisee's</a> lineage of course) that the Sages (aka Rabbis) have the free authority to interpret the Torah and not only to institute new laws but override the existing, Torah based laws.</p>\n<p>That was based mainly on their [own] interpretation of the Torah verse \"לא בשמים היא\" - \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Heaven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Torah is not in Heaven</a>\", metaphorically \"the Torah is to be decided [by us] on the Earth\". (please read the wiki in full). Additional strengthening of their point was their interpretation of another verse (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.17.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut 17</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעָשִׂיתָ עַל־פִּי הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לְךָ ... וְשָׁמַרְתָּ לַעֲשׂוֹת כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ׃</p>\n<p>you shall carry out the verdict that is announced to you from that place that the LORD chose, observing scrupulously all their instructions to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the verse is speaking of submitting to the decisions of the Supreme court only (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin</a>), the commandment was expanded to following the orders of all the [accepted] Rabbis.</p>\n<p>So from about 300BC, the Sages took the exclusive authority to decide on the active Torah laws - canceling some (like corporal punishment is dependent on the Temple) and adding many others.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is Hashem being separate from his creation a more acceptable belief than His creation being within Him?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've read and been told that Hashem is separate from his creation because he is infinite and therefore he can't have the finite objects of the universe be a part of him. He must be uniform. </p>\n\n<p>I've also read that the idea of creation being within Hashem is generally thought to be a potentially heretical belief.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, what's the difference? If the creation is separate from Hashem, then it's as if He is not infinite and has boundaries, outside of which exists the creation (paradox), as opposed to the creation being within Him, which would mean there are finite objects that are a part of His Being (paradox).</p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems the creation being a part of him makes more sense, because if he is infinite then he is everything. The fact that our faculties of sense divide the objects out there into discrete units doesn't necessarily mean that this is the reality or truth of the world. So this type of idea doesn't really preclude the infinite quality of Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>So what's the argument in favour of a separate creation that is paradoxical in its nature rather than the above suggestion?</p>\n\n<p>Also, if we were to mention the topic of Hashem's will and whether having a will that changes to create, destroy, nurture, etc isn't contradictory to His infinite nature, that could be a whole other can of worms. You can mention it in your answers though if you think it's necessary.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>By \"His creation being within Him\", I assume you mean panentheism.</p>\n\n<p>Pantheism is the belief that the universe is god. This would be heretical. (Ask the court that excommunicated Spinoza.)</p>\n\n<p>Pan<strong>en</strong>theism (with an extra \"en\" in the middle) is the belief that the universe is of God, but that God is more than just the universe.</p>\n\n<p>Panentheism is a fully accepted way of viewing Judaism, as per nearly all ways of reading Qabbalah. The question is how to understand the Lurianic concept of \"tzimtzum\". This is the notion that creation was less an act of making things as an act of G-d constricting His Infinity to that one option can exist rather than all of them. To \"make room\" in concept, not physical space, for existence.</p>\n\n<p>1- Tzimtzum kepeshuto (tzimtzum in the simple meaning) -- G-d literally constricting His Essence. This is the position of the Yosher Leivav (1:1:12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From these things, we have learned that one who takes pity on His Creator must think in his heart that tzimtzum is literal so that he doesn’t come to insult God’s honour and think that God’s essence is present in the lowly, dishonourable, physical and even in the lowest things, God forbid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the overwhelming majority share variants the objection of the Shomer Emunim haQadmon (2nd dispute no. 35 ff.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anyone who wants to understand tzimtzum literally will come to make many mistakes and will come to contradict many of the principles of faith. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since G-d cannot change, how could we speak of Him contracting?</p>\n\n<p>So there are two basic alternatives, and the choice between them is one of the fundamental points of dispute between Chassidim and Misnagdim (those who fought the innovations of Chassidus).</p>\n\n<p>3- The Chassidic approach is that tzimtzum is an illusion, and G-d being unchanging means it couldn't really have happened. In fact, we only think we exist as independent entities; and in reality only G-d exists. This is typified by the Tanya (Shaar haYichud vehaEmunah ch. 3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... [E]very intelligent person will understand clearly that each creature and being is actually considered naught and absolute nothingness in relation to his Activating Force and the “Breath of His mouth” which is in the created thing, continuously calling it into existence and bringing it from absolute non-being into being…. The spirituality that flows into it from “That which proceeds out of the mouth of God” and “His breath” – that alone continuously brings it forth from naught and nullity into begin, and gives it existence. Hence, there is truly nothing besides Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a Divine Mystery here, since if our own existence is merely an illusion, then no one exists to be prey to that illusion.</p>\n\n<p>3- Misnagdim objected to the implication that everything is G-d, considering it tantamount animism and tree worship. As the Vilna Gaon put it (in a letter dated 1796):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They call themselves Chasidim – that is an abomination! How they have deceived this generation, uttering these words on high: “These are your Gods, O Israel: every stick and stone.” They interpret the Torah incorrectly regarding the verse “Blessed be the name of the glory of God from His dwelling place” (Ezekiel 3:12) and also regarding the verse: “… and You give life to everything.” (Nehemiah 9:6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a dispute about what the Vilna Gaon's own position was. His Asarah Kelalim (kelal #2) appears to say that tzimtzum was literal, in terms of the verb -- there was a real contraction. But the tzimtzum was of G-d's Will, not of His Essence, so the phrase \"G-d contracted\" is non-literal. And as we see, the universe generally runs by rules and laws of nature, and the Divine Will is usually hidden.</p>\n\n<p>His student, R' Chaim Volozhiner, gives a resolution that harmonized these two positions.</p>\n\n<p>In Nefesh haChaim (shaar 3 ch. 2 Rav Chaim) explains that calling Hashem “haMaqom -- the Place” is a rather limited metaphor. A literal maqom is a place or holder of an object without being the cause of its existence. However, if Hashem were to retract his Will from anything, it would cease to exist; He is the Cause of existing. Thus the understanding that his position is like the Tanya’s.</p>\n\n<p>But in chapter 4, Rav Chaim discusses the literal absence of Kevod Hashem, and the first appearance of the word tzimtzum, at the beginning of ch. 5, reads “…צמצם כביכול כבודו ית’ שיוכל להמצא ענין מציאות עולמות וכחות ובריות נבראים ומחודשים — He ‘constricted’, as it were, His Blessed Kavod that He could bring into existence the idea of existing worlds, forces/potentials, and creatures that are created and newly made.”</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that Nefesh haChaim is describing a literal tzimtzum of Hashem’s glory which then causes the illusion of an absence His Essence. That tzimtzum includes the conception one gets from the Vilna Gaon's Asarah Kelalim which in turn causes the tzimtzum as understood by Chassidim.</p>\n\n<p>This dispute about what is tzimtzum goes to the heart of panentheism. The Chassidic position is frankly panentheistic. The Misnagdic view sites somewhere in between, as\nthe universe is of G-d. but in a way that it isn't a full embodiment of His Will (and thus giving me room to have my own will).</p>\n\n\n",

As such, it’s certainly prudent to say this Mishnah, to emphasize this point. </p>\n\n<p>§7:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכָל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד בֵּין אֲנָשִׁים בֵּין נָשִׁים חַיָּב לִשְׁתּוֹת בַּלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה אַרְבָּעָה כּוֹסוֹת שֶׁל יַיִן. אֵין פּוֹחֲתִין לוֹ מֵהֶם.</p>\n  \n  <p>Everyone, both men and women, are obligated to drink four cups of wine on this night, no fewer than that. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>§10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל כּוֹס וְכוֹס מֵאַרְבָּעָה כּוֹסוֹת הַלָּלוּ מְבָרֵךְ עָלָיו בְּרָכָה בִּפְנֵי עַצְמָהּ. וְכוֹס רִאשׁוֹן אוֹמֵר עָלָיו קִדּוּשׁ הַיּוֹם. כּוֹס שֵׁנִי קוֹרֵא עָלָיו אֶת הַהַגָּדָה. כּוֹס שְׁלִישִׁי מְבָרֵךְ עָלָיו בִּרְכַּת הַמָּזוֹן. כּוֹס רְבִיעִי גּוֹמֵר עָלָיו אֶת הַהַלֵּל וּמְבָרֵךְ עָלָיו בִּרְכַּת הַשִּׁיר.</p>\n  \n  <p>On each of these four cups, we make an individual blessing on it. On the first cup, he says Kiddush. On the second cup, he reads the Haggadah. On the third cup, he bentches. On the fourth cup, he finishes Hallel and recites Yehalelucha. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The identity of Birchas HaShir is disputed in the Gemara (Pesachim 118a), whether this refers to Yehalelucha or Nishmas. In practice, we say both in Hallel; however, in 8:10, the Rambam explicitly identifies it as Yehalelucha. </p>\n\n<p>What about the rest of the Seder? In chapter 8, the Rambam gives the basic rundown of the Seder. Some notable parts:</p>\n\n<p>§1-2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאַחַר כָּךְ מְבָרֵךְ עַל נְטִילַת יָדַיִם וְנוֹטֵל יָדָיו. [...] מַתְחִיל וּמְבָרֵךְ בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה וְלוֹקֵחַ יָרָק וּמְטַבֵּל אוֹתוֹ בַּחֲרֹסֶת וְאוֹכֵל כְּזַיִת הוּא וְכָל הַמְסֻבִּין עִמּוֹ כָּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד אֵין אוֹכֵל פָּחוֹת מִכְּזַיִת. וְאַחַר כָּךְ עוֹקְרִין הַשֻּׁלְחָן מִלִּפְנֵי קוֹרֵא הַהַגָּדָה לְבַדּוֹ. וּמוֹזְגִין הַכּוֹס הַשֵּׁנִי וְכָאן הַבֵּן שׁוֹאֵל. וְאוֹמֵר הַקּוֹרֵא מַה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה הַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה מִכָּל הַלֵּילוֹת שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אֵין אָנוּ מַטְבִּילִין אֲפִלּוּ פַּעַם אַחַת וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה שְׁתֵּי פְּעָמִים. שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין חָמֵץ וּמַצָּה וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלּוֹ מַצָּה. שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין בְּשַׂר צָלִי שָׁלוּק וּמְבֻשָּׁל וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלּוֹ צָלִי. שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין שְׁאָר יְרָקוֹת וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה מְרוֹרִים. שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין בֵּין יוֹשְׁבִין בֵּין מְסֻבִּין וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלָּנוּ מְסֻבִּין: </p>\n  \n  <p>After [Kiddush], he makes an Al Netilas Yadayim and washes his hands. [...] He begins and makes a Borei Pri Ha’adamah, and he takes a vegetable and dips it into Charoses and eats a Kezayis - he and all those seated with him. Nobody may eat less than a Kezayis. Afterwards, we remove the table only from the one who recites the Haggadah; we pour the second cup, and here the son asks, “Why is this night different from all other nights? [...]”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam is clearly implying that Urchatz and Karpas are performed in order that the children ask; while this is not his suggestion in 7:3 regarding how to do this, it’s for that reason that it’s done. This is borne out by Pesachim 116a as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה נשתנה הלילה הזה מכל הלילות שבכל הלילות אנו מטבילין פעם אחת הלילה הזה שתי פעמים: מתקיף לה רבא אטו כל יומא לא סגיא דלא מטבלא חדא זימנא אלא אמר רבא הכי קתני שבכל הלילות אין אנו חייבין לטבל אפילו פעם אחת הלילה הזה שתי פעמים מתקיף לה רב ספרא חיובא לדרדקי</p>\n  \n  <p>”Why is this night different from all other nights? For on all nights we dip once, but tonight we dip twice.” Rava challenges this: “Do you think every day a person manages to dip once?!” Rather, Rava said, “This is how it should be taught: ‘For on all nights we are not obligated to dip once, but tonight, we dip twice.’” Rav Safra challenged this: “Is there an obligation for the children?!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Karpas is only meant for the children to ask, it seems strange to refer to it as an obligation. What we see from here is that while Karpas specifically isn’t mandatory, something to the effect of getting the children to ask is. </p>\n\n<p>I should also note that the Rambam did not seem to hold of Yachatz or Ha Lachma Anya, as he jumps from Karpas straight to Mah Nishtanah. </p>\n\n<p>It should go without saying that Matzah and Marror are obligatory (the latter Rabbinically nowadays, but still obligatory), but the Rambam discusses them in 7:12-13 and 8:6-8. At the end of §8, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְחוֹזֵר וְכוֹרֵךְ מַצָּה וּמָרוֹר וּמְטַבֵּל בַּחֲרֹסֶת וְאוֹכְלָן בְּלֹא בְּרָכָה זֵכֶר לַמִּקְדָּשׁ: </p>\n  \n  <p>He goes back and wraps Matzah and Marror and dips it in Charoses and eats them without a Beracha, as a remembrance of the Mikdash. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s unclear to me from this whether the Rambam holds Korech is an absolute obligation or not. </p>\n\n<p>§9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאַחַר כָּךְ נִמְשָׁךְ בַּסְּעֻדָּה וְאוֹכֵל כָּל מַה שֶּׁהוּא רוֹצֶה לֶאֱכל וְשׁוֹתֶה כָּל מַה שֶּׁהוּא רוֹצֶה לִשְׁתּוֹת. וּבָאַחֲרוֹנָה אוֹכֵל מִבְּשַׂר הַפֶּסַח אֲפִלּוּ כְּזַיִת וְאֵינוֹ טוֹעֵם אַחֲרָיו כְּלָל. וּבַזְּמַן הַזֶּה אוֹכֵל כְּזַיִת מַצָּה וְאֵינוֹ טוֹעֵם אַחֲרֶיהָ כְּלוּם. כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּהְיֶה הֶפְסֵק סְעֻדָּתוֹ וְטַעַם בְּשַׂר הַפֶּסַח אוֹ הַמַּצָּה בְּפִיו שֶׁאֲכִילָתָן הִיא הַמִּצְוָה: </p>\n  \n  <p>Afterwards, he drags out the meal and eats whatever he wants to eat and drinks whatever he wants to drink. At the end, he eats from the meat of the Pesach, even a Kezayis, and he doesn’t taste anything after it. Nowadays, he eats a Kezayis of Matzah, and he doesn’t taste anything after it. This is so that there be a distinction from the meal, as the taste of the meat of the Pesach or the Matzah in his mouth that he ate them is the Mitzvah. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In summary, then, the Rambam holds that the following are mandatory:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kadeish</li>\n<li>Urchatz and Karpas, or some equivalent so that the children will ask</li>\n<li>Maggid\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mah Nishtanah or some equivalent for questions</li>\n<li>Avadim Hayinu</li>\n<li>Mitechilah</li>\n<li>Arami Oved Avi; not necessarily the Sifra, as we do, but at least some exposition on it, the longer, the better. The ten plagues are included in our exposition on Arami Oved Avi, as an explanation of the final verse in the passage. </li>\n<li>Pesach, Matzah, and Marror</li>\n<li>Not necessarily B’chol dor v’Dor, but certainly the spirit of it</li>\n<li>The second cup and its Berachos</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Rachtzah and Motzi Matzah</li>\n<li>Marror</li>\n<li>Maybe Korech?</li>\n<li>Shulchan Orech</li>\n<li>Tzafun</li>\n<li>Barech\n\n<ul>\n<li>Third cup</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Hallel\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fourth cup</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Rambam does quote Ha Lachma Anya, the story in Bnei Brak, the four sons, and the passage of B’chol dor v’Dor in his text of Maggid; however, as per the above, these are not obligatory. Further, Yachatz, Nirtzah, hiding the Afikoman, and Dayeinu are not discussed at all in these sections.</p>\n\n\n",

He then gives the source of this as being the Sifrei (although in the Oz Vehodor edition the source in brackets is Mechilta Parshas Bo Paragraph 6 see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mekhilta_d'Rabbi_Yishmael.12.8.3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).\nLet's assume that the source really is the aforementioned Mechilta. There, the midrash clearly states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על מצות ומרורים יאכלוהו מכאן אמרו, הפסח נאכל אכילת שובע ואין מצה ומרור\n  נאכלים אכילת שבע</p>\n  \n  <p>\"With matzoh and moror shall they eat it\": From here they ruled: The\n  Pesach is to be eaten in a state of satiety, but matzoh and moror are\n  not to be eaten in a state of satiety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be a direct contradiction to what this source was seemingly brought to prove, i.e. that matzoh and and moror may be eaten על השובע or not, depending on what the eater wants.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So the question is:</strong> If the source of Rabbeinu Nissim is the aforementioned Mechilta, then how can we resolve this apparent contradition between the Mechilta and Rabbeinu Nissim, and if the source of Rabbeinu Nissim is not the aforementioned Mechilta, then what is his source?</p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that Rabbeinu Shmuel ben Me'ir (on page 99b of the Gemora ד''ה משום חיובא דמצה) agrees with the Midrash when he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משום חיובא דמצה - שלא תהא נאכלת על השובע וחיובא דמצה לילה הראשון חובה\n  דכתיב בערב תאכלו מצות</p>\n  \n  <p>Because of the obligation of matzoh- so that you do not eat the matzoh\n  with satiety. And the obligation of matzoh on the first night is an\n  obligation, as it says \"on the evening (of the first night) you shall\n  eat matzoh.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can a convert be a Na'arah Me'orasah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Kesuvos 4:3 discusses various cases of a convert who commits adultery as a Na'arah Me'orasah. In response to my <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/101427/9682\">other question on this Mishnah</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101427/why-does-a-naarah-meorasah-convert-who-has-illicit-relations-not-receive-skila?noredirect=1#comment338940_101427\">Heshy raised an intriguing question</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait... how can a naarah convert get married? The father is supposed to accept her kiddushin, but she doesn't have a father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Kiddushin 43b records the following dispute, regarding an earlier dispute:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנן התם נערה המאורסה היא ואביה מקבלין את גיטה אמר רבי יהודה אין שתי ידים זוכות כאחד אלא אביה מקבל את גיטה וכל שאין יכולה לשמור את גיטה אין יכולה להתגרש אמר ר\"ל כמחלוקת לגירושין כך מחלוקת לקידושין ורבי יוחנן אמר מחלוקת לגירושין אבל לקידושין דברי הכל אביה ולא היא</p>\n<p>It was taught in a Mishnah there (Gittin 6:2): \"A Na'arah Me'orasah – she and her father can accept her <em>get</em>. R' Yehudah said, two hands cannot accept as one; rather, her father accepts her <em>get</em>, but anyone who cannot guard her own <em>get</em> cannot be divorced.\" Reish Lakish said: As the dispute by divorce, so, too, by marriage. R' Yochanan said: The dispute is by divorce, but by marriage, everyone says her father, and not she [can accept it].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The halacha, in practice, follows R' Yochanan (Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer 37:4 and 37:11).</p>\n<p>Thus, Heshy asks: If a Na'arah's father must be the one to accept her marriage, as R' Yochanan maintains, how can a convert possibly get married as a Na'arah? Halachically, she has no father! As Reish Lakish holds that the dispute regarding divorce applies to marriage as well, he can answer that the Mishnah in Kesuvos accords with the Chachamim, rather than R' Yehudah. But how does R' Yochanan defend himself against this Mishnah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I had <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101427/why-does-a-naarah-meorasah-convert-who-has-illicit-relations-not-receive-skila?noredirect=1#comment338943_101427\">proposed</a> that, according to R' Yochanan, the Mishnah could work according to either R' Yehudah or the Chachamim.</p>\n\n<p>According to R' Yehudah, the reason a Na'arah cannot accept her divorce/marriage document is because \"two hands cannot accept as one.\" If a Na'arah has no father, perhaps he would hold that she could accept on her own behalf, as there are not two hands able to accept.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Chachamim, the reason a Na'arah cannot accept her marriage document but can accept her divorce document is because, as per Kiddushin 44a,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קידושין דמדעתה אביה ולא היא גירושין דבעל כרחה בין היא בין אביה</p>\n  \n  <p>Marriage, which works with her consent – her father, and not her. Divorce, which works against her will – whether her or her father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi explains,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אביה ולא היא - שהתורה זיכתה לו</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Her father and not her\" – for the Torah granted it to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is an intriguing term, to \"grant\" it. Perhaps according to the Chachamim, the right belongs to the Na'arah, but if she has a father, the right is transferred to him. If she doesn't have a father, as in our case, the right isn't transferred to him and remains with her.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I was hesitant to say for certain that this is a correct approach to answer the question, but I recently discovered evidence that seems to support my claim. </p>\n\n<p>A practical difference as a result of my interpretation of the Chachamim is that while this halacha would apply to a girl who never had a father, if she was orphaned after birth, perhaps she would not be able to accept her Kiddushin until she matures. Indeed, this seems to be the approach of the Mordechai cited by the Rema (EH 37:13):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נתקדשה לדעת אביה ונשאת שלא לדעתו בין שאביה כאן בין שהלך למדינת הים אינם נשואין [...] <strong>הגה</strong> וי\"א דה\"ה אם מת האב קודם שנשאת ונשאת (כן משמע במרדכי פ\"ב דקידושין בשם מקצת רבותינו):‏</p>\n  \n  <p>If she did Kiddushin with her father's consent and did Nisuin without his consent, whether the father is present or went overseas, it is not Nisuin. [...] <strong>Rema:</strong> Some say that this is the halacha if the father died before she did Nisuin, and then she did Nisuin (thus is implied in the Mordechai in the second chapter of Kiddushin in the name of some of his Rabbeim).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Be'er Heitiv quotes the other opinion in the Mordechai, which leads to an alternative understanding of the Chachamim's opinion according to R' Yochanan:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומסקנת המרדכי דהוי קדושין מעלייתא מאחר דאב מת ואין חשש שמא ימחה ב''ש:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>And the conclusion of the Mordechai is that the Kiddushin is effective after the father dies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this approach, it's not just that the right is not initially transferred to the father, but that it's <em>transferred back</em> when he dies!</p>\n\n<p>This understanding of the Chachamim seems to be shared by Rabbeinu Tam, as cited by the Chelkas Mechokek:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עיין שם שרבינו תם תמה על דבריהם והאריך להוכיח דאין האחים יכולין למחות ואין אדם מוריש זכות בתו לבניו</p>\n  \n  <p>See there that Rabbeinu Tam is astonished on their words, and he discusses at length to refute them. [He argues] that the brothers are unable to protest, and a man cannot bequeath the rights regarding his daughter to his sons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This, too, implies that the right reverts to the daughter, rather than being a right which the father can keep, as if the father keeps it, her brothers <em>would</em> be able to protest.</p>\n\n\n",

This is the meaning of the verse (Koheles 12:14), \"He will bring [man] to judgement over every hidden thing, good and bad\" - Hashem will judge the man who keeps hidden the 'good' that He revealed to him, and did 'bad' in not recording it.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem from the Sefer Chassidim that if one gains heavenly assistance in the area of Torah it is incumbent on that person to not just ignore it but rather to take active steps to record what has been given over to him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As stated in the comments, there does not seem to be a known source for that Vilna Gaon story.</p>\n\n<p>But, there is a Sefer called <em>Q&A from Heaven</em> - or <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/43937\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שאלות ותשובות מן השמים</a> in the original.</p>\n\n<p>The author - יעקב הלוי ממרויש - was one of the Ba'alei Tosafos, passed away in 1243.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently back then they didn't mind asking for heavenly help in Torah matters.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>'אנו עמלים ומקבלים שכר' - A <em>mitzva</em> is worth proportionately more according  to the effort invested.

But, as far as I recall, such stories either (a) end with \"and the rabbis approved\" or (b) are about authorities (like rabbis) and thus are authoritative. Here, (a) is certainly not true. (b) seems to be false also: the <em>mishna</em> gives no indication that the actors in this story are people to be emulated and indeed the commentaries on the <em>mishna</em> say that \"the king appointed him\" implies that <em>Y'hoshua b. Gamla</em> was unworthy of the post. So there doesn't seem to be any authority supplied by the story; what does it add?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosafot_on_Bava_Batra.21a.2.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot Bava Batra 21a</a> write that Yehoshua b.

Some Jews believed the sun traveled above, indicating a more flat earth theory. The Lubavitcher, Rabbi Menachem M.

    "content": "# How can the Sanhedrin ever err?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On the one hand we know that if a Sanhedrin issued an erroneous decision (which was acted upon) they must bring a sacrifice (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.4.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 4:13</a>). </p>\n\n<p>On the other, we have the concept of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Heaven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lo bashamayim hi</a>\" (see also: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.59b.1-5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 59b</a>) namely that the meaning of Torah is decided not in Heaven, but by Rabbinical interpretation here on Earth. And Sanhedrin seems like the ultimate interpreting body.</p>\n\n<p>So how then can the Sanhedrin ever err? I'm not talking about errors in matters of metzius (such as, husband went away on journey, they thought he was dead, but he came back alive). Rather, I mean errors in interpreting the Torah - what should be permissible and what should be forbidden. It seems that whatever the Sanhedrin decides, <em>is</em> correct  or <em>becomes</em> correct, by definition (due to \"lo bashamayim hi\").</p>\n\n<p>If we say they can err, that implies the existence of an independent standard of truth, against which errors can be made. Which would go against \"lo bashamayim hi\".</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Imagine a scenario where a king orders his subjects to sort unlabeled boxes of two types of objects into each of two rooms.  The subjects are forbidden to open the boxes but instructed instead to seek the guidance of the king's appointed elders as to which boxes contain which objects.</p>\n<p>The elders use various sophisticated, best efforts means to guess at the boxes' contents.  Occasionally, the elders may change their minds as to which are the contents of a given box, such as in response to new evidence or just a fresh perspective, and that box will then be reclassified and sent to the other room.</p>\n<p>Contrast this scenario with one where the boxes are known to be empty and the king has instructed his servants to fill the boxes with whatever the elders think are in them.  Wouldn't the wise of the elders just acknowledge that the boxes are empty and not waste time trying to pretend that the evidence points one way or the other?</p>\n<p>I think therefore that it's pretty clear that the latter scenario does not at all represent the halachic process.  Rather, the wise King knows that the subjects are human and only requires them to listen to their elders, as is reasonable.  Likewise, He knows the elders are fallible humans as well, and only requires a level of effort to guess at the contents.  Practical halacha thus follows the ruling of the Sanhedrin, provided one's knowledge is no greater than their own (see e.g. Horayoth 2a-2b where a student who follows the guidance of the Sanhedrin, <em>knowing</em> they are in error, has to bring his own personal offering for his mistake in listening to them, and is not atoned with the communal offering they bring for their error, which does indeed atone for the error of the unwitting masses.</p>\n<p>This idea is what is meant in the passage in Bava Metzia:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עמד רבי יהושע על רגליו ואמר (דברים ל, יב) לא בשמים היא מאי לא בשמים היא אמר רבי ירמיה שכבר נתנה תורה מהר סיני אין אנו משגיחין בבת קול שכבר כתבת בהר סיני בתורה (שמות כג, ב) אחרי רבים להטות</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua stood on his feet and said: It is written: “It is not in heaven” (Deuteronomy 30:12). The Gemara asks: What is the relevance of the phrase “It is not in heaven” in this context? Rabbi Yirmeya says: Since the Torah was already given at Mount Sinai, we do not regard a Divine Voice, as You already wrote at Mount Sinai, in the Torah: “After a majority to incline” (Exodus 23:2). Since the majority of Rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, the halakha is not ruled in accordance with his opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah was given over with rules regarding the determination of practical halacha.  These rules include following the majority.  They do not include following a <em>bat kol</em>.  As per the ruling of the King, even if the <em>bat kol</em> is assumed to describe the <em>actual</em> contents of the box, its testimony is inadmissible in the court of halachic determination.  If the sages, however, change their minds, they may then require a <em>par he'elam davar</em> based on their new opinion.  (And perhaps at times another one if they change their minds again.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The premise behind this question  seems to be that whatever Sanhedrin decides ipso facto becomes  the Halacha and the reality because Lo B'Shmoyim Hi.</p>\n\n<p>However, Lo B'Shmoyim Hi isn't really such a broad concept. If something is unclear and there are legitimate ways to rule either way then yes Lo B'Shmoyim Hi, we will go with whatever the understanding of Sanhedrin is and that will become Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>If however they make a mistake and yes they are capable of doing so then the mistake will remain a mistake and will have to be undone with a Korbon brought afterward.</p>\n\n<p>IOW Lo B'Shmoyim Hi is just another guideline of how they reach a ruling in most cases where they presumably aren't making a mistake.

When it is relative - Rabbis have the privilege to set the Halacha de-jure but when they refer to the \"absolute\" Halacha (like a Mishnah or the like), the Rabbis can be wrong. </p>\n\n<p>THe Gemmorah in Sanhedrin (33) says \"טועה בדבר משנה\" for example as a criterion for invalidating a Psak. So when the Sanhedrin \"invents\" new Halochos they can not be possibly wrong, but when they \"develop\" existing ones they can start with a wrong assumption that contradicts a Mishna they forgot and that will knock the whole Psak down.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Half Jew half Gentile\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I always thought it was a misconception to be \"half-Jewish\". Usually the speaker means one of their parents are Jewish, making them either fully Jewish or fully Gentile.</p>\n\n<p>However, I saw today that the Minchas Chinuch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Chinukh,_Kometz_Mincha.347.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kometz HaMincha #347</a>) suggests the possibility of such a status (although in  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Chinukh.347.1.4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Minchas Chinuch</a> he seems less sure). The case is two people own a non Jewish slave (not an <em>Eved Kenaani</em>, but with קנין הגוף). One frees their half, and the half slave converts. The free half is Jewish, and when the remaining half is freed, it remains Gentile.</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for other sources which discuss such a status. Maybe they disagree with the concept and say the Jewishness spreads (as Minchas Chinuch suggests, unlike in his Kometz HaMincha). Maybe they discuss the practical ramifications that the Kometz HaMincha brings, or suggest new ones.</p>\n\n<p>I'm already aware the Ben Ish Chai in Benayahu (Eruvin 18a), amongst other places, discusses this concept, and relates it to Siamese twins. The Kometz HaMincha also quotes a Turei Even which discuses this, but I don't know what he says.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The source is from the gemara in Kiddushin and Gittin which Kiddushin daf 6a Rashi cites the gemara in Gittin daf 43a which asks a question about if a half-emancipated goyish slave who is now half-Jewish marries a Jew, what is the din? I believe this is the source that Minchas Chinuch used.</p>\n<p>This is also explained in the Chumash about a charufa which Kiddushin 6a talks a little about. Basically a charufa is a goyish slave woman who was reserved for a Jewish man when she gets redeemed and then comes a person and marries the charufa when she was not redeemed yet. this is in sefer Vayikra perek yud-tet, pasuk chuf-alef. Of course, if someone today says they are half Jewish because of their dad, they aren't Jewish at all.</p>\n<p>Regarding the matter of the Judaism spreading, I can use the gemara in Kiddushin daf 7a that says that if a man says to a woman that he wants to marry half of her, the kiddushin doesn't spread to the other half since her mind stops it. Therefore, since a woman can't be married halfway since she can't marry two men, the kiddushin stops there and doesn't spread and she isn't even married halfway because she can't marry too men as I said before. I can also use this case to say that since the Jewishness here stops halfway because of the other master, it doesn't spread but still doesn't disappear since we don't have the problem here of a woman who can't marry two men. Because of this, the Jewishness of the slave doesn't spread fully and only partially does it spread. Also, a disclaimer, please don't pasken out of anything I just said since I'm not a posek in regards to marriage or anything. Just a regular bachur.</p>\n\n\n",

It was a Sunday; this teaches us that Rosh Chodesh Iyar was a Sunday. This also teaches us that they ate from the cakes which they brought in their hands from Mitzraim for thirty days, and on that day, it ran out. That evening, they ate the <em>slav</em>, and when they woke up, they collected the <em>mann</em>. In Alush they received Shabbos, and there they made their first Shabbos, as it says, \"And the nation rested on the seventh day\" (ibid. v. 30). On Sunday, 23 Iyar, they travelled from Alush and came to Refidim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be self-contradictory: first it insists that 15 Iyar was a Sunday, then it says that the following Sunday was the 23 Iyar! Further, the Braisa proceeds to explain that the Torah was given on 6 Sivan on Shabbos; this fits with  the 23 Iyar being a Sunday, but not with 15 Iyar being a Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>Further, the Braisa insists that 15 Nissan is a Friday. This only works if 15 Iyar is a Sunday, assuming Nissan is 30 days, or Shabbos, if Nissan is 29 days.</p>\n\n<p>Were the Braisa to say that 15 Iyar is a Sunday, 22 Iyar is a Sunday, and 29 Iyar is a Sunday, I'd have no problem; Seder Olam Rabbah agrees with the Chachamim in Shabbos 87b that the Torah was given on Shabbos, 6 Sivan, but argues on the Braisa there that Bnei Yisrael left Mitzraim on a Thursday. However, it does not say this.</p>\n\n<p>Is this simply a typo in Seder Olam that crept in over the generations?

In your first paragraph (after the quote) you say that the 6th of Sivan on Shabbos fits with the 23rd of Iyar on Sunday (and not with the 22nd of Iyar on Sunday), but then two paragraphs later you say that the 22nd of Iyar on Sunday fits with the 6th of Sivan on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to the question at hand, according to the third manuscript above there is actually no contradiction. If you look closely you will see that though it has the date as the 23rd of Iyar, it leaves out that that day was Sunday. Thus according to this manuscript we are free to say that the 23rd of Iyar was Monday, which would allow the 15th and 22nd of Iyar to be Sunday. However, we can't quite say that for a different reason. This manuscript happens to also have a different text a little earlier. Instead of saying that the 15th and the 1st of Iyar were Sunday, it says that they were Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KULKB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KULKB.jpg\" alt=\"Image of manuscript\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Thus, according to this manuscript the 15th of Iyar was Shabbos which would make the 23rd of Iyar actually Sunday! So the only manuscript which can uphold the chronology of the 23rd of Iyar being Sunday, is also the only manuscript that doesn't claim that the 23rd of Iyar was Sunday.</p>\n\n\n",

I just want to tell you a little about our Pessah customs.</p>\n\n<p>In Egypt, as everywhere else, Pessah was always a happy time. But still, you can imagine the incongruity of sitting at the seder table year after year, in Cairo, Egypt, to celebrate how God took us out of the Land of Egypt, the land of slavery, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, with signs and wonders, when the reality was that we were STILL in Egypt, STILL the subjects of a malevolent foreign ruler, and our situation was getting from bad to worse from one year to the next.</p>\n\n<p>As is the custom with Jews everywhere, the Pessah season would begin right after Purim, with vigorous spring cleaning. Let me rattle off a series of recollections, in no particular order:</p>\n\n<p>-Traditionally, the first-born male children fast before the seder. In Egypt some families made the first-born girls fast as well!</p>\n\n<p>-We had to get rid of the hametz by 9 am the day of the first seder. My mother gathered it all in the middle of the dining-room table, and gave it to the maid.</p>\n\n<p>-Pessah foods were special-ordered weeks ahead of the holiday from kosher providers. No Pessah display at the corner grocery store!</p>\n\n<p>-Our matzah was round, a foot or more in diameter, and much thinner than the Ashkenazic boxed type. It was shmura matzah.</p>\n\n<p>-A favorite staple was the special round Pessah cookies, about 4 inches in diameter. They were yellow and soft, and their taste was heavenly -- \"taam haman\"! Another was hard Greek cheese.</p>\n\n<p>-We did not cook with matzo meal. Instead, we used matzah and eggs. Matzah, whole or crumbled, was dipped in water and mixed with eggs or meat in casseroles. A Sephardic favorite my mother made was the \"Mina\" or \"Mayina\". It consisted of layers of matzah, spinach and ground beef cooked with hard-boiled eggs thrown in. The eggs were cooked at low temperature for a very long time. In Ladino, they are called \"huevos haminados\", or \"browned eggs\".</p>\n\n<p>-Our haroset was based on dates, not apples. You use what's plentiful in your country. In the Middle East, it's dates! The dates are soaked in water, boiled, crushed, and pureed, then sprinkled with crushed dried nuts. The result looked exactly like mortar, as it was supposed to!</p>\n\n<p>-An annual Pessah treat was dry-roasted salted nuts, such as almonds, pistachios and walnuts. They were too expensive to have the rest of the year. My favorites were hazelnuts. I was good at discovering their special hiding places, which was different each year, and stealing a few every day ahead of the holiday. One year I overdid it and there were only a handful left when Pessah came. Boy, was my mother mad at me!</p>\n\n<p>-Our maror was romaine lettuce; sometimes celeri stalks. Boy, was I surprised when I ate horseradish for the first time in this country! Quite a different taste from romaine lettuce!</p>\n\n<p>-Sephardic Jews, like all other Jews, prohibit the use of the five basic hametz grains on Pessah. These are barley, rye, oats, wheat, and spelt. However, unlike Ashkenazic Jews, they permit the use of other grains, or kitniyot, such as chick peas, corn, beans, peas, lentils, and, most importantly, rice. An important part of our \"shulchan orech\" - our \"set table\" - was grape leaves stuffed with rice, meat and spices! I hear that a lot of Ashkenazic Jews convert to Sephardic Judaism for the duration of the holiday!</p>\n\n<p>-Our Haggadah was a local edition in French and Hebrew, and we used both languages during the seder.</p>\n\n<p>-Sephardim recite the Four Questions in a different order from Ashkenazim: Why do we dip twice?, Why only matzah? Why only maror? Why do we eat only reclining? I could not find a source explaining the reason for the difference.</p>\n\n<p>-Now let's talk about the ten plagues. There was no dipping of fingers in wine. We were much too refined for that! My mother would walk up to my father with a large bowl and a glass of water. My father would recite the plagues one by one, and for each plague he would pour a bit of wine in the bowl from a special large wineglass, and my mother would pour a bit of the water. It was all done under the table. Nobody was supposed to look at the \"plagues\" for fear of being \"contaminated\"! Then my mother, without looking directly at the bowl, and with the rest of us looking in another direction, would go to the bathroom and flush the \"plagues\" down the toilet! I remember fear traveling down my spine!</p>\n\n<p>The wine was said to represent justice and the water mercy. Justice tempered with mercy is how God is operates in the Jewish tradition.</p>\n\n<p>-The Jews in Egypt also had a peculiar local custom. Each participant would sling the napkin containing the matzah over their right shoulder. Then the leader of the seder would ask them \"Where are you from?\". They would answer \"Mitzrayim -- Egypt\". The leader would then ask again, \"And where are you going?\". They would then sling the napkin of matzah over their left shoulder and answer: \"Yerushalayim -- Jerusalem!\".</p>\n\n<p>-It gets better. In some families, the leader would take the seder tray and go around chanting and lightly banging the tray over each of the participant's heads! Some say this is to place each person under the \"protection\" symbolized by the seder plate. Each person was \"passed over\", as it were!</p>\n\n<p>-Before the meal, unmarried young women would hide behind a door to eat a hard-boiled egg. It was a symbol of fertility suggesting that marriage was in the not-too-distant future.</p>\n\n<p>-Finally, we did not hide the afikoman matzah or have a Cup of Elijah, although our seders were every bit as long as the next Jew's seder.</p>\n\n<p>When I got my exit visa in October 1967, my official permission to leave Egypt, the Egyptians added by hand, in red ink, the letter \"Y\" in Arabic between quotation marks, on both sides of the exit visa stamp. It stood for Yahudi -- Jew. It was a signal to those who would later check this visa to harass me as much as possible, which they did.</p>\n\n<p>Years later, when I started having children, I stuck this exit visa in our family Passover Haggadah, next to the traditional words, \"B'chol dor vador, hayyav adam lir'ot et 'atsmo, k'illuhu yatsa mimmitzrayim -- In every generation, every Jew must consider that <em>he, himself</em> was <em>personally</em> rescued from Egypt.\" That's always been easy for <em>me</em> to say!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Iranian Jews whip each other with scallions during \"Dayenu.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Pinchas the Judge. He tells R. Pinchas to read his Sefer Hamitzvot where he lays out the rule that a <em>mitzvah</em> that is derived via one of the 13 principles of exposition is not called <em>d'oraita</em> unless the Sages explicitly say so. <em>Kessef</em> which is derived via a <em>gezeirah shavah</em> and is not explicitly said to be <em>d'oraita</em> by the Sages, is hence not considered <em>d'oraita</em>. <em>Shtar</em>, though derived via a <em>hekesh</em>, is explicitly stated by the Sages to be <em>d'oraita</em> (see the discussion in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=9b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 9b</a>). Thus, Rambam had no choice but to refer to <em>kessef</em> as <em>divrei soferim</em> and <em>shtar</em> as <em>d'oraita</em> even though ideally <em>shtar</em> would also have been referred to as <em>divrei soferim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the key paragraph:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והתשובה על זה שודאי כך הייתי אומר שהכסף והשטר מדבריהם הואיל ומן הדין באו לולי הא דאמרינן בהדיא בענין נערה מאורסה דאמרינן נערה מאורסה דאמר רחמנא בסקילה היכי משכחת לה פירוש מדאמר קרא נערה בתולה מאורסה שמע מינה בודאי שיש מאורסה מן התורה בלא ביאה ובמה ושקלו וטרו וסוף המימרא אמר ר' נחמן ביר' יצחק משכחת לה כגון שקידשה בשטר הואיל וגמר ומוציא  גומר ומכניס שמע מינה שלדברי הכל השטר גומר ומכניס ועל זה סמכתי ופסקתי שהשטר מן התורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This responsum is cited by Ramban in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49363&st=&pgnum=50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">objections to Rambam's second principle of <em>mitzvah</em> counting</a>, and Ramban's citation is further cited by R.

For example,  in אור זרוע לצדיק <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ohr_Zarua_LaTzadik%2C_Novellae%2C_Rambam%2C_Mamrim.1.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Tzaddok writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד כתב רבינו שם דהלכה למשה מסיני אין לו רמז בקרא, וגם על זה אני תמה מהא דסוכה ל\"ד... ועוד קשה לי מהירושלמי</p>\n<p>The Rambam writes further that _Halacha L'Moshe MiSinai has no hint in Scripture, and also on this I am surprised, for we find in Sukka ... and in the Yerushalmi ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Regarding the second point</strong>, I think a comment of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.11?lang=bi&aliyot=1&p2=Alshich_on_Torah%2C_Deuteronomy.17.11.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alshich on Devarim 17:11</a> might help address the question, regarding the injunction to listen to the Sages:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשר יגידו לך - הלכה למשה מסיני, וגם אם לא יהיה לה טעם בעיניך, וכאומרים על שמאל שהוא ימין, כי במה שאומרים בהיקש או על פי מדות שהתורה נדרשת וגזירות וסייגים בודאי נראה הטעם</p>\n<p>\"That which they tell you\" - <em>Halacha L'Moshe MiSinai</em>, and even if you don't see any reason for it, and when they tell you about left that it is right. For, in that which they tell you through a juxtaposition, or through one of the methods of expounding the Torah, and fences, certainly one sees a reason.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What I understand the Alshich to be saying is, that <em>Halacha L'Moshe MiSinai</em> is a very important part of the Torah itself, namely in that it demonstrates that there are some things which are to be accepted simply because they are coming through Rabbinic tradition, and Rabbinic tradition is an essential facet of the Torah. <em>Halachos L'Moshe MiSinai</em>, not in content but in concept, <em>are</em> included in the Torah, in the injunction of אשר יגידו לך. An element of the completeness of the Torah is the inclusion of the Mesora on which it relies.</p>\n\n\n",

While Rashi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.35a.4?p2=Rashi_on_Pesachim.35a.4.3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pesachim 35b</a>, et. al.) translates Shiboles Shu'al as oats, not all Rishonim agree to this definition. For instance, the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kilayim.1.1?p2=Rambam_on_Mishnah_Kilayim.1.1.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Kilayim 1:1</a>) holds that Shiboles Shu'al is desert barley.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are there any communities today which reject Rashi's translation in favor of the Rambam's (or some other Rishon I don't know about who doesn't like either of their translations), and thereby hold that bread containing oats is permissible on Pesach?</li>\n<li>If such a community does exist, and they hold that Kitniyos are forbidden on Pesach, do they consider oats to be Kitniyos and forbid them for that reason instead?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm updating my answer as no one has posted another and my links have been updated.</p>\n<p>There is a growing community of Sepharadim who are consuming Oats during Pesah in private. I say this is a growing community because I don't believe most Eastern Sepharadim had oats as part of their regular diet and so for them to add it to their diet, and then add it during Pesah has been a process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kashrut.org/?p=6913\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The well known Sephardic Abadi family started approving oat based products publicly and it caused some family division. One part of the family is now advising Sepharadim to eat oats publicly, and another side is not.</a></p>\n<p>Personally I'm convinced oats are not one of the 5 grains and therefore would eat oat/oatmeal during the week of the Hag. But as a Sephardic Jew, I'm generally just not eating oats that regularly and so even if according to Sephardic Halakha we can eat it anytime during the Hag, we will still probably prefer to eat kitniyot instead since most of our recipes and diets revolve around kitniyot more than oats. I believe Ashkenazim should be pushing for Oats to be allowed since there are already so many other restricted foods for them during Passover.</p>\n<p>Note: By rejecting Oats as part of the 5 grains it is permissible for Passover, but it also means eating Oat matzah does not fulfill the obligation of matzah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the case of the near-simultaneous deaths in Y'vamos chapter 7?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The seventh chapter of <em>Mishayos Y'vamos</em> discusses under what circumstances someone related to a <em>kohen</em> can eat <em>t'ruma</em>, depending on their relation and on what other relatives are alive. But in the middle of the chapter (the end of <em>mishna</em> 4) is a seemingly unrelated ruling, that if we don't know who died first, a (childless) husband or his wife, and the dead wife is an <em>erva</em>-relative of the <em>yavam</em>'s, then the <em>yavam</em> must perform <em>chalitza</em> with the other wife: he must do something in case the wife died first and the remaining wife needs <em>chalitza</em>, but cannot do <em>yibum</em> in case his brother died first and the wives need nothing because one is the brother's relative.</p>\n\n<p>Why is that ruling in this chapter? It has seemingly nothing to do with the rest of the chapter.</p>\n\n<p>I do see the <em>Rav</em>'s explanation, that \"because it's dealing with doubtful cases in which we rule stringently, it taught another with them\", but find it unsatisfying: for one thing, there are many such cases it could have added, and this explanation doesn't say why this one was chosen; for another, this seems a weak reason to add any such case. Does anyone know of another explanation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In each of the three cases we have a <strong>Hazka Kamayita</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For the first two cases, (safek 9 year old and safek puberty) Meyikar Haddin, She can eat teruma (The safek 9 year old is still not 9 old, and his bia cannot make a bat Kohen pesula. The Israel non Cohen is still not pubery, the bat Kohen can continue to eat Teruma). However the Mishna rules <strong>Chumra against the Chazaka</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The third case also when husband dead, the erva wife is bechezkat Haya (see Tosfot 31a \"nafal\" for deep explanation). However the yebama is prohibited lashuk against the Chazaka.</p>\n\n<p>Gemara in Daf 31a objects against such a Chumra that in a similar case (safek kiddushin for erva which is Tsara of yebama) the yebama is allowed to marry with everyone. Gemara answers that in frequent cases, we don't make chumra against Chazaka because it's a <strong>chumra that leads to Kula</strong> (חומרא דאתי לידי קולא) If she needs Chalitsa, people may allow Ybum,  and lead to Karet Meyikar Hadin. But in <strong>not frequent cases</strong> (לא שכיחי), we are not afraid about Chumra deAte lidey kula. </p>\n\n<p>So the group of 3 cases is homogeny.</p>\n\n<p>Here we have <strong>three not frequent cases</strong> and we can make chumra against Chazaka. </p>\n\n<p>In safek 9 year old and is Kohen, people can validate his Ybum and she will eat teruma which is <strong>mita bidey shamayim</strong> against Chazaka. Or When he is Kohen makes Kiddushin and is safek puberty, and is dead, his brother will make ybum and she will eat teruma against Chazaka (following the Chazaka kiddushin aren't kiddushin, and therefor ybum is not ybum, and she is zara who eat teruma).</p>\n\n<p>All this cases are rare and we are not afraid of chumra deate lidey kula, חומרא דאתי לידי קולא</p>\n\n<p>This is the common reason of the three dinim.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we don't know Gemara 31a, we can understand this from merarshim</p>\n\n<p>TYT</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ספק בן תשע שינים וכו': ולא מוקמינן ליה אחזקה ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chumra against Chazaka.</p>\n\n<p>ROB:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואיידי דאיירי בספקי לחומרא תניא להא בהדיהו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since they are talking about safek lechumra, they taught it with them.

    "content": "# Selling chametz if two people share a house?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was just wondering a general law about the sale of chametz (specifically through chabad.org but also in general), that if two people jointly own a house, then should they each <strong>individually</strong> fill out the sale online form (or in person however they do it), <strong>OR</strong> since one of them did it already, then the entire place is sold?</p>\n\n<p>Is it sold by place or by each persons individual chametz?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are typically two elements to a sale of <em>chometz</em>. The first and primary part is the sale of the actual <em>chometz</em>. The main focus of your typical <em>mechiras chometz</em> contract focuses on getting rid of the <em>chometz</em>, and not owning <em>chometz</em> on <em>Pesach</em>. This must be done by the owner of the <em>chometz</em> or someone acting through his/her agency. One cannot sell something that they do not own. (In fact, one of the thrusts of the contract is making the Rabbi your agent, since he cannot sell your <em>chometz</em> without being your agent.) So, unless you made arrangements with your co-owner as to the transference of authority to sell one another's <em>chometz</em>, the form would need to be filled out individually.</p>\n\n<p>There is a second element of the sale, which is the lease of the locations in which the <em>chometz</em> is found, in order to not have <em>chometz</em> in your property on <em>Pesach</em>. If you are co-owners of the house, then this would depend on the terms of your partnership in ownership (setting aside the possibility of agency discussed above). If either, or both, of you have jurisdiction to make unilateral lease agreements, then the location is leased via one person's sale. If you both need to agree (which is far more typical), then you would both need to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Note, as well, that the lease of property is, in most contracts, limited to the locations <em>in which you have chometz</em>. Therefore, unless you and your co-owner happen to only keep <em>chometz</em> in exactly overlapping locations, you would, regardless of the above, each need to separately lease the locations in which you have <em>chometz</em> as it probably does not coincide with the locations that your co-owner is leasing. (This could easily be changed by altering the contract, but generally these sales are pretty streamlined, especially when performed through online forms.)</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the <em>chometz</em> is the primary focus of the sale, and probably simpler for each co-owner to do their own sale.</p>\n\n\n",

For something which doesn't feel, like cloth and leather, it can't have pain!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.13.51?with=Rashi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi to Vayikra 13:51</a> understands \"mami'eres\" in the same fashion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צרעת ממארת. לְשׁוֹן סִלּוֹן מַמְאִיר (יחזקאל כ\"ח), פויי\"נט בְּלַעַז</p>\n  \n  <p>Tzara'as mima'eres – an expression of \"prickling briers,\" <em>point</em> in Old French.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.7.4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 7:4</a>, in discussing the sin of the Eigel HaZahav, interprets Yeshaya 17:11 as indicating that they received Tzara'as (in the similar Midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.18.3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabbah 18:3</a>, it says they received both Tzara'as and Zivah):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּכְאֵב אָנוּשׁ, בּוֹאוּ וְקַבְּלוּ אֶת הַצָּרָעַת. וְלָמָּה קוֹרֵא אוֹתָהּ וּכְאֵב אָנוּשׁ, לְשׁוֹן גֶּבֶר, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהִיא מַכָּה הַגְּבַרְתָּנִית. דָּבָר אַחֵר, וּכְאֵב אָנוּשׁ, שֶׁהִיא מְנַתֶּשֶׁת אֶת הַגּוּף שֶׁהִיא נִכְנֶסֶת בּוֹ</p>\n  \n  <p>\"And 'anush' pain\" – come and receive the Tzara'as. And why does it call it \"'anush' pain\"? ['Anush'] means \"man\" [interpreting 'anush' as 'enosh'], for it is a powerful affliction. Another explanation of \"and 'anush' pain\": Because it weakens the body into which it enters ['anush' literally means 'acute'].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it's very clear that there was definitely pain involved, though none of these sources are clear on how much.

And Paroh will say of Bnei Yisrael, 'They are lost in the land; the desert has sealed them in.' And I will strengthen Paroh's heart, and he will chase after them. I will be honored through Paroh and his army, and Mitzraim will know that I am Hashem.\" And so they did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi makes a point regarding the existence of Ba'al Tzefon at this point in the narrative:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפני בעל צפן. הוּא נִשְׁאַר מִכָּל אֱלֹהֵי מִצְרַיִם כְּדֵי לְהַטְעוֹתָן, שֶׁיֹּאמְרוּ קָשָׁה יִרְאָתָן</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Before Ba'al Tzefon\" - it was left of all the gods of Mitzraim in order to lead them astray, so that they would say their god is difficult [to destroy].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet Paroh's response to this maneuver makes no mention of their idol (v. 5):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֻּגַּד לְמֶלֶךְ מִצְרַיִם כִּי בָרַח הָעָם וַיֵּהָפֵךְ לְבַב פַּרְעֹה וַעֲבָדָיו אֶל־הָעָם וַיֹּאמרוּ מַה־זֹּאת עָשִׂינוּ כִּי־שִׁלַּחְנוּ אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵל מֵעָבְדֵנוּ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And it was told to the king of Mitzraim that the people had fled.

Paroh responded to the fact that Bnei Yisrael weren't coming back (perhaps he still thought they were only taking a three-day journey); the fact that they were lost in the desert played no role in his response, and certainly not the fact that Ba'al Tzefon was present.

The basic thrust of his discussion is that it made no sense for פרעה to chase after בנ\"י after Hashem had just completely obliterated Egypt without any impediment or opposition. Thinking it was a bad idea to send them away was preposterous - they sent them away because Egypt was in ruins and they needed to salvage what they could.

But he understood it to mean \"anyone can use it.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now that the milk was taken, who is responsible to pay for it - the person who accidentally \"lied\", the 2nd person, both, no one because it was accidental?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The drinker is responsible.</p>\n<p>See SA CM 182.1 SMA sk2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חוץ מלדבר עבירה:    דדברי הרב ודברי התלמיד דברי מי שומעין <strong>ויכול המשלח לומר סברתי שלא ישמע לי לעשותו</strong> לכך אין המשלח חייב אבל אם אין השליח בר חיובא לא שייך האי טעמא: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no shlichut for a sin out of for an Avera. Because the Meshaleach can say, I was thinking that the Shaliach will not agree to make the sin.</p>\n<p>So if someone says \"Take it, it's mine.\" There is Shlichut according to the SMA.</p>\n<p>But anyways, in your case the co-worker didn't say, \"Take it.\" There is no Shlichut. So, the Gezel is only the responsibility of the taker.</p>\n<p>I understand from comments (thanks to @DonielF and @DanF) that my answer isn't clear enough.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>In the first part of the answer I wanted to exclude the lack of responsibility of an eventual \"Meshaleach\" according to the rule written in SMA, despite the known rule of \"Ein Shaliach lidvar Avera\" (there is no shlichut for a sin)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the case of the of the OP, even with the rule of the SMA, the co-worker is not responsible as explained above. The drinker acts following his own willing. (To understand this I recommend learning the first mishna of the 6th chapter of Me'ila). This Mishna talk about Meila, an exception to the rule of Ein Shaliach Lidvar Avera. The cases described in the Mishna define when there there are truly  a function of sender and a function of agent, and when it is not the case.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If an agent has fulfilled his agency, the sender is guilty of sacrilege, but if he has not carried out his agency, he himself is guilty of sacrilege.</p>\n<p>How so? If he [the employer] said to him: “Give meat to the guests” and he offered them liver, “[Give] liver” and he offered them meat, he himself is guilty of sacrilege.</p>\n<p>If the employer said to him: “Give them one piece each,” and he said to them: “Take two pieces each,” and the guests took three pieces each, all of them are guilty of sacrilege.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If he [the employer] said to him, “Bring me [something] from the window or from the chest,” and he brought it to him [from one of these places] even though the employer says, “I meant only from that place” and he brought it from the other place, the employer is guilty of sacrilege.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>But if he said to him, “Bring it to me from the window,” and he brought it from the chest, or “from the chest” and he brought it to him from the window, the agent is guilty of sacrilege.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>So the drinker made the sin. The rule regarding stealing, is that one needs to pay, wether he is aware of the sin or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As @DonielF noticed, in Bava Kama, stealing is included in some Berayitot as av Nezikin and a man needs to pay dammage even if he didn't it intentionally. (There is an exception in Yerushalmi if someone place an object near a sleeping man and this man broke it in his sleep movements). Even if when saving oneself from a murder someone broke utensils of his friend, he needs to pay meykar Hadin (see BK 117b and Rashi ולא מן הדין. שהרי המציל עצמו בממון חבירו חייב כ''ש מציל אחרים בממון חבירו: )</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I commented that you complicated the case a lot, so it's not a simple case but let's take it part by part.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>המוציא מחבירו - you imply one has to pay straight away, but it is not clear who has the burden of proof.

However, when somebody “hits” another simply to hurt him or even to kill him, then the makkah-based word is translated into Aramaic words unrelated to lakah.

Gog and Magog:</strong> Seder Olam Rabbah ibid. implies it's a solar year:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משפט גוג לעתיד לבא י\"ב חדש, שנאמר וקץ עליו העיט וכל בהמת הארץ עליו תחרף (ישעיה יח ו).‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The judgement of Gog and Magog in the future is 12 months, as it says (Yeshaya 18:6), \"The kites will summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I assume this is a solar year based on the inference from the seasons.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. The wicked in Gehennom:</strong> This is clearly a lunar year, as evidenced by the practice of yahrtzeit being held on the same day of the <em>lunar</em> calendar, rather than the solar one. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The pattern seems to be that judgements of Jews are based on the lunar calendar while judgements of non-Jews are based on the solar calendar.<sup>1</sup> The one outlier is the Egyptians,<sup>2</sup> who were (obviously) not Jewish, yet were judged based on the lunar calendar. Why?<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup><sup>1</sup>Cf. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.29a.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 29a</a>: \"When the sun is eclipsed, it is a bad sign for the non-Jews, and when the moon is eclipsed, it is a bad sign for the Jews, for the Jews count by the moon and the non-Jews count by the sun.\"</sup></p>\n\n<p><sup><sup>2</sup>Whether Iyov was Jewish or not is established as a Tannaic dispute in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15b.5-8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 15b</a>, so  our Mishnah would accordingly hold like the opinion that he was Jewish.</sup></p>\n\n<p><sup><sup>3</sup>Obviously I will accept an answer that says that any of my assumptions or interpretations in this post are wrong, provided that it gives a coherent explanation of all five judgements, whether they are lunar or solar, and why.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>With one simple question, I believe I can answer this: since when is Iyar to Nissan twelve months? Even if we assume that it was Rosh Chodesh Iyar on which this incident took place, why would the Mishnah round it to twelve months, when all the others are exact?</p>\n\n<p>The answer must be that that year was a leap year.<sup>1</sup> This can be justified based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.8.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei d'Rebbi Eliezer 8:9</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מחזור העיבור מי\"ט שנה וז' מחזורין קטנים יש בו. יש מהן משלש ויש מהן משתים שלש ושתים שלש ושלש ושלש ושלש ושתים.</p>\n  \n  <p>The leap year cycle is 19 years, with seven small cycles in it. Some of them are three [years], and some of them are two [years]: Three, two, three, three, three, three, and two.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is clearly telling us when the leap years are, but does it mean that the leap years are at the beginning of each mini-cycle, or at the end of them? (This is inconsistent with our current calendar either way, so we can't appeal to that to answer our question.)</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.8.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:4</a>, the Midrash writes that the year following Avraham's death was a leap year:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אברהם מסר ליצחק ונכנס בסוד העיבור ועיבר את השנה לאחר מותו של אברהם</p>\n  \n  <p>Avraham passed it to Yitzchak, and he was initiated in the principle of intercalation, and he intercalated the year after Avraham's death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Avraham was born in 1948 AM (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.9a.6?lang=he&p2=Rashi_on_Avodah_Zarah.9a.6&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 9a</a>), and he died at 175 (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 25:7</a>), meaning that he died in the year 2123 AM. This would have been the 14th year of its 19-year cycle.</p>\n\n<p>According to 8:9 cited above, the 14th year would have concluded the fifth cycle; therefore, the end of each cycle is the leap year, not the beginning.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>Yetzi'as Mitzraim was in the year 2448 AM (Avodah Zarah ibid.). According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.8.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei d'Rebbi Eliezer 8:10</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בר\"ח ניסן נגלה הקב\"ה על משה ועל אהרן בארץ מצרים והיתה שנת ט\"ו של מחזור הגדול של לבנה שנת י\"ז לשנת מחזור העיבור מכאן ואילך המנה יהיה לכם.</p>\n  \n  <p>On Rosh Chodesh Nissan, Hashem was revealed to Moshe and Aharon in Mitzraim. It was the 15th year of the big lunar cycle, the 17th year of the leap year cycle. From this point onward, the count is \"for you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The 17th year concludes the sixth mini-cycle, meaning that it, too, is a leap year. Thus, Yetzi'as Mitzraim was in a leap year.</p>\n\n<p>By Yetzi'as Mitzraim being in a leap year, the time span between between early Iyar and the following 15th of Nissan would be sufficiently long to account for a full solar year.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>The conclusion I present here, that the Mitzri'im were indeed judged over the course of a solar leap year, does not accord with the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46767&st=&pgnum=21&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gra's interpretation</a> nor <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Shemot.10.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachye's interpretation</a> of the twelve months. I would like to see someone provide an explanation which accords with these views that the twelve months described here are indeed lunar.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>Moshe was born <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8466/\">80 years before Yetzi'as Mitzraim</a>, in the year 2368 AM. This would have been the twelfth year of its 19-year cycle, the first year of the fifth mini-cycle. That means that this Midrash must hold like the opinion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.12b.15-18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 12b</a> that Moshe was <em>not</em> born in a leap year.<br>\nLikewise, Yitzchak was born in the year 2048 AM, the fifteenth year of its 19-year cycle, so he, too, was not born in a leap year. Pirkei d'Rebbi Eliezer must therefore hold not like <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.11a.13-14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 11a</a>, that Yitzchak was born in a leap year, but rather like <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabbah 5</a> that Yitzchak was born one year after the Malachim visited Avraham, making a leap year unnecessary.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did Rabbi Joseph Albo say the mitzvoth will be abolished?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://booksnthoughts.com/the-rejection-of-maimonides-jewish-beliefs-by-recognized-jewish-scholars-and-rabbis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Israel Drazin</a>, the Babylonian Talmud, Nidah 61b, expresses the opinion of Rabbi Joseph: “The mitzvot [commandments] will be abolished in the time to come.” \nWhat does this mean? G-d says the Law is eternal. Hashem does not change His mind. The medieval scholar Rabbi Joseph Albo (fourteenth century, in his Sefer Ha-ikkarim) writes that a future prophet can abolish all of the biblical commands except for the Decalogue (Ten utterances (the Ten Commandments)).</p>\n\n<p>Certainly a prophet cannot abolish the commandments? Moshe himself said that one way we can tell a true prophet from an imposter is if he says we may abolish the mitzvahs.</p>\n\n<p>Question is, did Rabbi Joseph Albo really say the mitzvot may be abolished?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>(If you don't want to be bored by many paragraphs of source-text, skip to the conclusion in bold at the end.)</p>\n\n<p>R. Joseph Albo touches upon the topic of future changes to the Torah in a number of places in Sefer HaIkarim:</p>\n\n<h2>1:3</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We may also allow without difficulty the inclusion of Moses as the greatest prophet and the perpetuity of the law, because they are special principles, essential to the law of Moses which can not be conceived without them. For if we assume that there may be a prophet greater than Moses, it follows that the law of Moses may be abolished, for the words of a greater prophet should be believed more than those of a prophet who is inferior in degree, as we shall see later. Likewise, if we do not believe in the perpetuity of the Torah, we can imagine that the law of Moses may have been repealed after the Israelites were exiled from their land. </p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. I p. 57)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he seems to have no problem with Rambam counting as a fundamental principle that the Torah cannot be changed.</p>\n\n<h2>1:15</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The superiority of Moses and the immutability of the law we regard as neither fundamental nor derivative principles, because they are not essential to divine law. They are merely like branches issuing from the belief in the authenticity of the prophet's mission. If they are principles at all, primary or secondary, they are peculiar to the law of Moses, and not common to all divine law. Thus, belief in the Messiah and in the resurrection of the dead are dogmas peculiar to Christianity which can not be conceived without them. But the law of Moses can be conceived as existing without the belief in the superiority of Moses and the immutability of the law. It is better to say therefore that they are like branches issuing from the belief in the authenticity of the lawgiver's mission, and not independent principles. </p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. I p. 136)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he seems to be saying that no one can change the Torah, but that it's not an <em>inherent</em> fundamental principle.</p>\n\n<h2>1:23</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The third dogma is that the Law of Moses will not be repealed nor changed nor exchanged for another by any prophet. This dogma, too though it is not essential to divine law in general or the Law of Moses in particular, as we have explained above, nevertheless it is like a branch issuing from the dogma of the authenticity of the messenger, and therefore it is incumbent upon everyone who professes the Law of Moses to believe it, as we will explain in the third Book. </p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. I p. 183)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he again seems to not allow for changes, but again notes that it's not an <em>inherent</em> principle.</p>\n\n<h2>3:13</h2>\n\n<p>He begins by arguing that changing the Torah is philosophically untenable:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We now desire to investigate whether it is possible that a given divine law of a given people should change in time, or whether it cannot change but must be eternal.</p>\n  \n  <p>It would seem that a divine law cannot change, for reasons based upon a consideration of the giver, of the recipient, and of the law itself. Considering the giver, it would seem inconceivable that God who is the giver should desire one thing at one time and then change His will and desire its opposite at another time. It can not be that God should desire right at one time and wrong at another. Why then should God change His law for another?</p>\n  \n  <p>Considering the recipient, we can not see why, since the nation is the same, the law should change in the course of time. We can not use the analogy of the individual and say that just as the rues of health for a child are different from those of a young man and those of a young man are different from those of an old man, as the time changes from childhood to youth and from youth to old age, so the rules of divine law must change with the times. For while it may be true in the case of an individual that his behavior is bound to change as the period of his life changes, the rule does not apply to a political group in which there is no such change from childhood to youth and to old age, for the convention of law is that all the times are the same. Hence we can not see that divine law should change by reasons of the recipient.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now if we consider the law itself, it would seem that since the purpose of the divine Torah is to teach men intellectual conceptions and true opinions, there can be no reason for its changing at any time. For true opinions can never change. Monotheism can not be true at one time and dualism or trinitarianism at another, any more than it is possible that a thing that has already been should change and not have been. It seems clear therefore that there can be no change in a divine law, whether we consider the law itself, the giver, or the recipient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, he then spends the rest of the chapter explaining at length how it is actually <em>not</em> philosophically untenable for certain laws to be fitting for certain contexts. Then in Chapter 14 he gives various examples of changes that occurred and questions Rambam's proofs for the principle of immutability, and in Chapter 15 he discusses the rationales for the changes. In Chapter 16 he shows how none of the verses which appear to state that the Torah will remain as it is forever actually mean that, he gives more examples of changes, and concludes thusly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is nothing therefore to prevent us from supposing that the divine law may in the future permit some things which are forbidden now, like fat or blood or the slaughter of animals outside the temple. These things were originally forbidden when the Israelites left Egypt because they were addicted to the worship of evil spirits, and ate the flesh with the blood and also ate fat and blood, as we read in relation to the killing of animals outside the temple, \"And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the satyrs, after whom they go astray.\" But when this form of worship has been forgotten, and when all people shall worship God, and the reason of the prohibition will cease, it may be that God will again permit it. And some of our Rabbis have the same opinion. In \"Yelammedenu\" they say, commenting on the biblical expression, \"The Lord looseth the prisoners\" (מתיר אסורים), \"He permits the forbidden\" (מתיר איסורין).</p>\n  \n  <p>To sum up, I see no evidence, nor any necessity, from Maimonides' arguments, that the immutability or irrepealability of the law should be a fundamental principle of a divine law generally or of the law of Moses in particular. This is also the opinion of my teacher R. Hasdai, namely that it is not a principle or dogma of the law of Moses. But he says that it is a doctrine which every one professing the Mosaic law should believe. The reason he gives is that if we examine all the parts of the Mosaic law, we find that they embrace all those moral qualities and theoretical ideas which are calculated to give perfection to the soul in some manner. This reason is similar to that which we quoted above from Maimonides' <em>Guide</em>. We will come back to the subject and inquire from a different point of view whether the Mosaic law is liable to change as are other divine laws or not. This requires some preliminary considerations. </p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. III p. 147-148)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here it sounds like he thinks that there is no reason for immutability to be a fundamental principle, but that it is still a good idea. </p>\n\n<p>However, I think that the specific reference mentioned in the question may be to what he writes three chapters later. There he discusses at length the difference between the first two commandments and the next eight, and the difference between the Ten Commandments as a whole and the rest of the Torah. And he does differentiate between the categories with regard to a later prophet changing them. The chapter is quite long, so I will excerpt a few relevant passages:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now as there is a difference between the first two commandments and the others in that the former were spoken by God without the mediation of Moses, while the latter, though heard from God, were explained by Moses, so we can say that there is a difference between the ten commandments and the other precepts in that the ten commandments were heard from God, whereas the others were commanded by Moses. <strong>And as we have found that the last eight commandments of the decalogue may be changed by a prophet temporarily, so we may say that the other precepts of the Mosaic law can be changed by a prophet even permanently.</strong> And it is for this reason that they could abolish counting the months from Nissan in the time of the second temple by the command of Jeremiah, as we have seen.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. III p. 170-171, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our opinion therefore is, as the matter appears from an investigation of the Torah, that one is not permitted to budge from his traditional belief which came down to him by a continuous chain of communication, going back to the teaching of a prophet, provided he is convinced that the principles, fundamental and derivative, of the belief in question are true, as we explained in the First Book of this treatise, unless he is absolutely certain that God desires to abolish the words of the prophet from whom the traditional belief came down to him.</p>\n  \n  <p>The manner in which one can have this latter certainty is by having an absolute verification of the genuine character of the second divine messenger. The proof can not consist in the performance of miracles, since we see many other persons who are not prophets performing miracles either by creating an illusion or by magic, like the Egyptian magicians, or through some other art. Moreover, we find that those prophets who are not sent to announce a law also perform miracles, hence we can not tell whether the miracle performed by the person in question shows that he has been sent to promulgate a law, or whether it merely indicates that he is a prophet. It is clear therefore that a miracle is no proof that the messenger is genuine, as was explained in the eighteenth chapter of the First Book, but the proof must be derived from the law of Moses for the reason given in the eleventh chapter of the First Book. Accordingly, if his mission proved in the same manner as was that of Moses, it is proper to listen to the second prophet even if he desires to abolish the precepts of the first.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. III p. 172-174)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whether in the future there may come another prophet who will abolish the words of Moses and whom we shall be obliged to believe – this can happen only, as we have said, in one of two ways. either the new prophet will be proved to be greater than Moses, or his mission will be verified as was that of Moses. Now the Bible says that there can bot be a prophet greater than Moses, \"If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord do make Myself known unto him in a vision,... My servant Moses is not so; he is trusted in all My house; with him do I speak mouth to mouth.\" It seems then that Moses' prophecy is superior to any other. And at the end of the Torah we read that there will never arise another prophet like Moses whom God knew face to face. This is the degree which Moses asked for and it was granted to him, as we read at the end of the Torah, \"And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. III p. 175-176)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But if a prophet or one professing to be a prophet should come and say that he has been sent by God to promulgate a law, abolishing permanently the words of Moses, <strong>he must not be believed so far as concerns the ten commandments, since they were heard from God.</strong> But  neither must he be believed in respect to the other other commandments outside of the decalogue, unless he can verify his mission as Moses verified his, when when all Israel heard the voice saying to Moses, \"Go say to them: Return ye to your tents. But as for thee, stand thou here by Me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which thou shalt teach them.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. III p. 178, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hence they will not listen to any prophet who may come to abolish the words of Moses, unless they hear from God that he was sent for that purpose. For to obey a prophet and permanently violate a Mosaic command, is like obeying a prophet and violating that which one has heard from God Himself. In such a case one must not obey a prophet. It is for a thing of this kind that the prophet Iddo was punished by being devoured by a lion, because he obeyed another prophet and violated that which he himself heard from God. It is clear therefore that we must believe no one, whether he be a prophet or one professing to be a prophet, if he says that he was sent by God to abolish the words of Moses, or if he says that they are temporary and that the time has come for their abolition, unless his mission can be proved as publicly as the mission of Moses was proved in the presence of six hundred thousand people.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation vol. III p. 179-180)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My own opinion is that since this does not necessarily follow from an interpretation of the biblical verses, it is more proper to say that this matter depends upon the will of God. According to the Torah it belongs neither to the category of the necessary nor to that of the impossible. Our position at present is that of a prophet who heard something from God. He must not listen to any other prophet who advises him to act contrary to the command he himself received from God, unless he himself hears to the same effect from God. <strong>And even if we can verify the mission of a new prophet as the mission of Moses was verified, we will refuse to listen to him if he bids us abolish any one of the ten commandments which we ourselves heard from God.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. III p. 181-182, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From these passages it emerges that it is technically possible for Torah laws to be abolished by a subsequent prophet, under conditions that carry equal weight of those present at Moses's revelation, but even so the Ten Commandments are in a separate category and cannot be abolished under any circumstances.</p>\n\n<h2>3:20</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It follows, then, as a result of what we have said, that since God granted Moses' request, as He said, \"I know thee by name,\" we must understand the verse, \"And there hath not arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses,\" to signify a permanent miracle sowing the superiority of Moses as a prophet to all the prophets who came after him. Therefore no prophet has the authority to oppose Moses' words.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now it would seem according to this that the superiority of Moses as a prophet should be counted as a special and separate dogma of the Mosaic law, because it signifies the perpetuity of the latter. But an opponent may object to our interpretation. He may say, It is true that no prophet like Moses or greater than he will arise in Israel, but he may arise among the other nations, as our Rabbis say by way of comment on the verse, \"He shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high:\" He shall be exalted above Abraham, and and shall be higher than Moses from which it seems that there may arise one greater than Moses. For this reason we regard this point s a derivative dogma under the principle of the genuineness of the messenger, and not as an independent dogma. Our idea is this. Granting that their interpretation is correct and there may arise in the future another prophet as great as Moses, we can not believe such a prophet or one professing to be a prophet in opposition to Moses unless we are clearly convinced of the genuineness of his mission. This means that his mission as the promulgator of a law must be verified in the presence of six hundred thousand people, as the mission of Moses was verified. </p>\n  \n  <p>Whether such a thing will ever happen in the future, that all the people at once will hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as was the case with Moses – this is something that is hidden from us and can not concern us, as it depends solely upon the wisdom of God. But as long as a prophet's mission is not verified in this manner, we will pay no attention to any one who comes to abolish permanently the commands of Moses.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. III p. 188-190)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But we have made it clear that there can not arise at any time another prophet greater than Moses or equal to him; and that it is not proper to listen to an inferior prophet at any time who desires to abolish the laws of his superior. But inasmuch as the opponent may obstinately insist that there may arise in the future among the other nations a prophet equal to Moses or greater than he, we did not lay down the superiority of Moses as a basic dogma, but only as a derivative dogma  depending upon the dogma of the genuineness of the prophet's mission. The result is that we can not permanently abolish the laws of Moses at any time unless we can verify the prophet's mission in the way in which the mission of Moses was verified. Hence we do not have to regard the irrepealability of the Law as a main principle or dogma as Maimonides did. For we have made it clear that there is no evidence of it in the Torah. It is not therefore an independent principle, but a true belief, which depends upon the genuineness of the prophet's mission, as we explained.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Husik translation Vol. III p. 190-191)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So, to conclude, it would seem that R. Albo did not say that the mitzvot <em>will</em> be abolished, as formulated in the title of the question, but he apparently did say that they <em>can</em> be abolished. However, even then there are strict conditions which make it unlikely that it will happen, and he does distinguish between the Ten Commandments and the rest of the Torah, arguing that the Ten Commandments can never be abolished even if the strict conditions are met.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>We should perhaps note that R. Albo is not the only authority who allows the possibility that mitzvot will be abolished. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Joshua Falk</a> in his introduction to his commentary to the Tur writes as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וגם ידעו ישראל על ידי זה שתורת משה היא נצחית ואין לשנותה על ידי שום נביא כל שאין אנו רואין שהש\"י בעצמו ובכבודו חוזר ומתגלה במעמד ששים רבוא ליתן תורה חדשה על ידי נביא שיהיה כמשה רבינו ע\"ה</p>\n  \n  <p>And also Israel knew through this that the Torah of Moses is eternal, and we cannot change it through any prophet, as long as we do not see God himself and in his glory return and reveal in the presence of six hundred thousand to give a new Torah through a prophet who will be like Moses our teacher of blessed memory. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, like R. Albo he apparently allows the Torah to be changed as long as it is under circumstances equaling those of the revelation at Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>R. Abraham of Viterbo in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43991&st=&pgnum=66\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the third essay of Sefer Emunat Chachamim</a> likewise strongly criticizes Maimonides's claim that the Torah can never be changed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to bring kinnim after having mixed up birds\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In certain cases, the Torah prescribes the bringing of a pair of birds as an offering, one as a <em>chatat</em> and the other as an <em>olah</em>. See <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0312.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev 12:8</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0314.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev 14:22</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0315.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev 15:14</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0315.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev 15:29</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0406.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num 6:10</a>.</p>\n<p>The mishna in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h5b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kinnim 1:3–4</a> (2–3 in some editions) describes what happens when birds from multiple offerings get mixed up together. Mishna 1:3 includes (translation from Sefaria):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חַטָּאת שֶׁנִּתְעָרְבָה בְחוֹבָה, אֵין כָּשֵׁר אֶלָּא כְמִנְיַן חַטָּאוֹת שֶׁבַּחוֹבָה. וְכֵן עוֹלָה שֶׁנִּתְעָרְבָה בְחוֹבָה, אֵין כָּשֵׁר אֶלָּא כְמִנְיַן עוֹלוֹת שֶׁבַּחוֹבָה</p>\n<p>A sin-offering that became mixed with a [pair of] obligatory [birds], only the number of sin-offerings [contained] in the obligatory [pair] are permitted [to be sacrificed]. Similarly, an burnt-offering that became mixed with with obligatory a [pair of] obligatory [birds], only the number of burnt-offerings [contained] in the obligatory [pair] are permitted [to be sacrificed].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mishna 1:4 includes (translation from Sefaria):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חובה שנתערבה זו בזו, אחת לזו ואחת לזו, שתיים לזו ושתיים לזו, שלוש לזו ושלוש לזו--מחצה כשר, ומחצה פסול.  אחת לזו, ושתיים לזו, שלוש לזו, ועשר לזו, ומאה לזו--הממועט כשר</p>\n<p>If obligatory [bird offerings] became mixed with each other, one [pair] from this one [woman] and one [pair] from this one [woman], two [pairs] from this one [woman] and two [pairs] from this one [woman], three [pairs] from this one [woman] and three [pairs] from this one [woman]; half are permitted [to be sacrificed] and half are invalid. [However if] this one [woman] had one [pair], and this one [woman] had two [pairs], [or] three for this one, [or] ten for this one [or] one hundred for this one, [only] the smaller number [of birds] are permitted [to be sacrificed].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see that after a mix-up and after the allowed offerings from the mix-up are brought, a person is in one (or more) of the following situations, and they don't know which one applies to them: (1) they owe an <em>olah</em> without a <em>chatat</em>, (2) they owe a <em>chatat</em> without an <em>olah</em>, (3) they owe a pair (<em>chatat</em> and <em>olah</em>), (4) they owe nothing. Additionally, if they needed to bring multiple offerings, they do not know for which offering they may have already (partially) fulfilled their obligation.</p>\n<p>One common way to bring an offering that may not be required is to offer it with a stipulation: if it's required, then great, but if not, then it should be considered as a voluntary offering.<sup>[citation needed]</sup> However, voluntary bird offerings cannot be brought as a <em>chatat</em> (see <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h5b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kinnim 1:2</a>).</p>\n<p>What is the remedy for someone in this situation (or is there not one)? How (and with what stipulations) do they bring their missing offerings? If it depends on the number of pairs of birds, the number of people whose offerings were involved in the mix-up, or something else, please indicate as much in your answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The rule is that one who is doubtfully obligated in a <em>chatat ha’of</em> (as opposed to a <em>chatat beheimah</em>) may in fact bring one. It is treated in the same way as a regular <em>chatat ha’of</em> except that it may not be eaten. (See Rambam Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashin 7:10.)</p>\n\n<p>A further rule is that one only brings one <em>chatat ha’of</em> in a case of doubt, even if one is possibly obligated in multiple offerings. (See Rambam Hilchot Mechusarei Kapparah 1:10.)</p>\n\n<p>While I have not seen these rules applied explicitly to the cases you bring from Kinnim, I don’t see any reason that they should not apply here.</p>\n\n\n",

This was explicitly stated in Ezra3 [Nechemiah 10:31]: \"That\n  we will not give our daughters to the gentiles in the land and that we\n  will not take their daughters for our sons.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Touger has inserted for this step the following and important note:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although the verse the Rambam cites as a prooftext refers to the seven\n  Canaanite nations, all other Gentiles are also included as reflected\n  by the verse from Nechemiah. The Tur (Even HaEzer 16) differs with the\n  Rambam, explaining that the verse should be understood within its\n  limited context, referring only to the seven nations. (The Rambam's\n  opinion has a source in the Sheiltot D'Rabbenu Achai Gaon, while that\n  of the Tur is found in the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol) The crux of the\n  difference is the exegesis of the continuation of the verse cited by\n  the Rambam: \"For he shall sway your son away.\" Kiddushin68b quotes\n  Rabbi Shimon as focusing on the motivating rationale for the verse and\n  thus including all those who might sway a person's heart. Thus it\n  refers to all gentiles. The Sages, however, do not accept this\n  perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here are my questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>At the outset, is the position of Rambam or that expressed by Ba'al ha-Turim prevalent in the Jewish tradition on this point?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does the prohibition to all Gentiles include, on the halachic plane, even non-Jews who observe the seven Laws of Noah in accordance with the prescription of Mishneh Torah Melachim uMilchamot 8:11?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Observing the 7 Mitzvos does not change their status as Gentiles. </p></li>\n<li><p>The prohibitions of marrying gentiles (just like all other illicit relations) do not differentiate between righteous and wicked ones. The relations are forbidden in any way.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>PS I feel very uncomfortable discussing the details of the Jewish Halachah with a Noachide as it is not endorsed by the Halacha, to say the least.

The marriage is annulled only by a written get.\nMarriage with the nations of the world is made by the consent of both parties and is mutually nullified.\nThere is no possibility of marriage between a Jew and a gentile.\nTranslated by Google Translator from Hebrew</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The specific commandment found in Deuteronomy 7:3 to \"not give your daughters to their [gentile] sons, or have your sons take their [gentile] daughter for your son\" is pretty clear cut.</p>\n<p>This being said, the very next line in 7:4 gives the reasoning for this:</p>\n<p>\"For they will turn away your son from following Me, and they will worship the gods of others, and the wrath of the Lord will be kindled against you, and He will quickly destroy you.\"</p>\n<p><strong>So for sake of argument</strong>, if the Gentile has rejected every manner of Idol worship, and accepted all the mitzvot which apply to them for the explicit purpose of fulfilling gods will, what actual danger is there that the intermarriage will result in the children of this union being lured away to the worship of foreign gods?</p>\n<p>I believe the Talmud (Avodorah Zorah 65a)sheds some light on the issue Here we find a situation in which a Jew is prohibited from giving to a Gentile a gift on their feast days (assuming they will use the gift in an act of idolatry, or praise their false god on account of it) and an Amoriam trusts this Gentile enough to provide him with a gift, only to later find him \"up to his neck\" participating in celebration of a pagan holiday.</p>\n<p>\"Rava brought a gift to a minister named bar Sheshakh on their festival day. Rava said: I know of him that he does not worship idols. Rava went to him and found him sitting up to his neck in rose water, and naked prostitutes were standing before him. Bar Sheshakh said to him: Do you have anything as fine as this in the World-to-Come?\"</p>\n<p>So he trusted a man that he \"knew\" not to worship idols, and wound up placing himself in a situation where he inadvertently transgressed a commandment through the actions of the man that he trusted.</p>\n<p>What I read from this is that a Jew has a responsibility to not place themselves in such a vulnerable position that the actions of a non-jew (even one who repudiates idols) will put them in violation of the Torah.</p>\n<p>And who is one in a more vulnerable position of trust with, other than the spouse that they share a home and raise children with? Even an inadvertent mistake on part of this hypothetical spouse could have catastrophic repercussions.</p>\n<p>Besides, the greatest distinction between a Noahide and a Full convert, is that the Full convert becomes part of the Jewish people. By marrying a Jew, you're defacto becoming part of the Jewish people. So it only makes sense that a full conversion would be a necessary perquisite for marriage.</p>\n<p>This does raise several other questions, such as who are these handful Noahides that are scattered across the globe and who have cut themselves off from their own people, actually expected to marry without exposing their own children to the very same idolatrous practices that they've already rejected? Who will their children marry?</p>\n\n\n",

The more mitzvos Jews engage in, the more they are guided by their soul's desire to give as opposed to the body's desire to take, the sooner the Messiah will arrive and usher in Olam Haba: a time in which G-d will fully dwell on Earth. </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that every Jew has a place in Olam Haba, but the same cannot be said for Gan Eden. Upon death, the soul is resurrected to Gan Eden, at which point your life and every action taken is accounted for. If your good deeds outweigh the bad, you may enter Gan Eden. However, if they do not, you may either: a) return to the world for further correction (gilgul neshamot) or b) go to hell for purification. </p>\n\n<p>How is Gan Eden different than Olam Haba? Is Gan Eden just a \"waiting room\" for a select number of righteous souls to dwell in before the resurrection and eventual Olam Haba? Do all souls exist in one of three places before Olam Haba (hell, our physical world, Gan Eden)? </p>\n\n<p>If the purpose of creation is to create a בית בתחתונים, it sounds like this world will eventually become even better than Gan Eden after the arrival of Moshiach and the resurrection which will usher in Olam Haba. </p>\n\n<p>I think I'm confusing some terms and the timeline and would appreciate any clarification. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Your understanding seems to follow, for the most part, the position of the Ramban as laid out in Sha'ar HaGemul, in the section on reward and Gan Eden. Here is a rough summary, although seeing these sources inside and in context gives a clearer picture.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban explains that the primary reward is Olam Haba, and the reward that a person receives after they die is in Gan Eden:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותחלה נאמר ששכר המצות כולם, והגמול הטוב, דבר פשוט הוא בדברי רבותינו זיכרונם לברכה. שהעיקר הגדול הוא חיי העולם הבא. אבל השכר הקודם, והוא מה שיגיע לאדם אחרי המות, הוא גן עד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramban also refers to this aspect of Gan Eden as Olam HaNeshamos, the world of the souls.</p>\n\n<p>(The Ramban also explains that Gan Eden is a double-reference, and refers to a physical place in this world, as we find in Bereishis, but that's not <em>directly</em> related to your question.)</p>\n\n<p>The Ramchal in Derech Hashem 1:3:12 offers an explanation of the purpose of this stage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמנם בצאת הנשמה מהגוף ולכתה אל עולם הנשמות, הנה שם מתפשטת ומזדהרת בזהריה כפי מה שראוי לה ע״פ מעשיה, ובמה שהיא משגת שם כל זמן היותה שם, מתחזקת ממה שנתחלשה בגוף, ומזדמנת יותר למה שראוי שתעשה בזמן התחיה, עד שכשתשוב בגוף בזמן הראוי, תוכל לפעול בו הפעולה הנאותה לה, דהיינו הזיכוך שזכרנו</p>\n  \n  <p>When the soul leaves the body and goes to the World of Souls, there is is able to expand and shine with the shining that is befitting it according to its actions, and through everything it achieved while in this world it is strengthened against that which it was weakened in the body, and becomes more prepared for its eventual return to the body as resurrection, such that it will be able to refine the body when it returns to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Olam Haba is the reward a person gets after resurrection, and is the final reward given to the soul and the body together:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה מורה כי העולם הבא הוא עולם השכר לאותן שהקדוש ברוך הוא מחיה בתחיית המתים, ואינן על עולם הנשמות שקרינו אותו גן עדן, אלא עולם התחיה הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>...[This] shows that Olam Haba is the world of reward to those who will be resurrected, and it is not the World of Souls which we referred to as Gan Eden, rather it is the world of resurrection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ramban explains why the body should be involved in the final reward, but this is also not directly relevant to this discussion.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban gives the \"timeline\" fairly clearly, based on a Sifri:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובספרי (ואתחנן לה) הזכירו כל הזמנים הללו, במדרש אמרו:\n  \"בהתהלכך תנחה אותך\", בעולם הזה; \"בשכבך תשמור\", בשעה מיתה; \"והקיצות\", בימי המשיח; \"היא תשיחך\", לעולם הבא.\n  הזכירו כאן העולם הזה וזמן המיתה והוא עולם הנשמות, וימות המשיח, ואחר כך עולם הבא.</p>\n  \n  <p>(paraphrased) In the Sifri all of these periods are mentioned ... it mentions this world, the time of death, the World of Souls, the days of Moshiach, and afterwards Olam Haba.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In terms of the \"difference\", the Ramban is somewhat cryptic, but he describes that in Olam Haba those who merit it will be sustained directly by Hashem's glory:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן יאמרו תמיד בתלמוד (עי' בבא בתרא י' א') הקדוש ברוך הוא משביען [מזיו] שכינתו לעולם הבא, שנאמר \"אשבעה בהקיץ תמונתך\", רצונו לומר שקיום האנשים הזוכים ההם בזיו הכבוד, כקיום הנפש בגוף בעולם הזה באכילה ושתיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Daas Tevunos, the Ramchal describes it slightly differently, in that the higher level of Olam Haba is that by returning to the body, and refining and purifying the body and giving a measure of elevation and completion to the body, the soul itself becomes a benefactor, and in that way becomes more similar to Hashem and can therefore connect even more closely to Him.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that others, most famously the Rambam, understood that the \"Gan Eden\" to which one goes when they die is Olam Haba, and after resurrection one dies again and goes back to that place.</p>\n\n\n",

HaRav Tzvi Berkowitz was the Rav being consulted):</p>\n\n<p>The father of the groom was Jewish, but his mother was not, and the groom had converted. However, it was not publicly known that he had converted. The parents of the bride were divorced. Some consider it a bad <em>siman</em> for a divorced couple to walk the child to the <em>chuppah</em>, and therefore it was decided that the fathers would walk down the groom, and the mothers would walk down the bride. However, this left the bride being walked down to the aisle by a divorced woman and a non-Jew. Therefore, an older couple who were very close to the family of the bride walked a short distance behind the bride to escort her to the <em>chuppah</em>. The older couple veered off before the <em>chuppah</em>, and the groom and bride both had their parents with them under the <em>chuppah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I included all of the details so that I wouldn't be misrepresenting anything, but peeling away some of the complications, it does seem that a) if non-Jewish parents are walking a child down, it would be better to have another couple be co-escorts, which can be done by following behind, and b) a non-Jewish parent can stand under the <em>chuppah</em> with their child.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As well as halachic answers, there is this point to consider:</p>\n\n<p>It is a very important command, to honour ones parents, in most circumstances. To deny a person's fact of being a parent, at a pinnacle of parenthood (when ones child is themselves becoming married) would seem to be a height of disrespecting them <em>as a parent</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly one should also not place a child (or child's spouse) in the position of being expected/required/socially pressured to take or permit that act of disrespect to their parent. This would be not only a direct breach, but also a further breach of another commandment, not to place a \"stumbling block\" before \"the blind\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Also one is required by both positive and negative commands, and rabbinical law, to take all efforts to avoid singling out and humiliating a person in public, whether by deliberate act or omission - an act which is compared to killing them. <em>Chesed</em> (lovingkindness) is one of the highest virtues cited in Jewish law, which is full of positive examples where the strict letter of law is overridden by the demands of chesed. Singling out the parent, especially on a day like their child's fulfilment of such an important commandment as marriage, would seem to be a prime example of breaching that requirement also.</p>\n\n<p><em>(It shouldn't need saying, but all of these apply to any people (not just family and community). That's not just because of natural justice and ethics or because it would be plainly abhorrent not to. It's also shown explicitly by rabbinic examples and anecdotes, which show the application of these same laws with regard to both jews and non-jews.)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've been asked in the comment to add support for the obvious points, which is fair. I didn't expect some of them to be points for which support might be needed, being secondary points that are non-contentious, fairly well known, and with luck, extremely obvious. Here are a few - possibly not the best and surely not all that exists:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Honour due to ones' biological parent if non-jewish:</em> (1) See the Talmudic story of Dama ben Nesinas (Kiddushin 30a), the non-jew who honoured his parents and was highly praised and, the next year, divinely rewarded, apparently for doing so. (<a href=\"https://torah.org/learning/mitzvah-41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">website discussion</a>) Striking that the principle to honor parents is illustrated by a story of a non-jew honouring his non-jewish parent. If it is praiseworthy for a non-jew with non-jewish parents to honour them, so much more is it for a jew with a non-jewish parent, lest it be thought that adopting any less respectful style is inherent in conversion, or the like.<br/><br/>A related question is whether a convert should still honour their parents after conversion, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1473855/jewish/Must-a-Convert-Honor-His-Biological-Parents.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discussed</a> on Chabad. Same reason as above also applies, though this is hardly the \"reason\" to do it.</li>\n<li><em>Honour due to parents-in-law:</em> Widely cited verse Samuel 24:12. Even though \"father\" can be a term of respect or for an elder, it's generally accepted that this teaches us that a father in law is also to be treated to a great extent as a father. (And a mother in law therefore to a great extent as a mother). At least one website <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1241261/jewish/Do-I-Need-To-Honor-My-Mother-In-Law.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states this is also codified in Shulchan Aruch</a>. The discussion does not seem to distinguish between parents-in-law that are jewish or not, or err or no; as a general principle, in deciding upon the existence of a requirement to honour them.</li>\n<li><em>Comment on the two together:</em> Apart from logically combining these to discover our duty of honour to a non-jewish parent-in-law, one can also discover further separate reasons. For example, let us suppose that we accepted that the biological child is directly required to honour the parent, for the reason above, but then consider whether their partner should reject the parent being treated this way, because the two above items can't (for any reason) be combined this way. But that would require the partner to demand their betrothed partner breaches their duty of respect to their own parent. That would probably be inconceivable, due to the same breaches which it would cause them to commit, including the nature of their conduct towards and harm done to their own spouse (and his/her relationship with his/her parents) in doing so, and Shalom Bayith both in their home and at the wedding. Also we would note that the biological child has an explicit duty to honour, while the other has no comparable explicit duty to forbid that honouring.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As an aside worth noting, the duty to \"honour\" ones parents, covers an intent and the steps needed, to make them <em>feel</em> honoured. That would be breached by excluding them. It is also a general rule that if there is doubt, one should err on the side of caution, lovingkindness, and more eagerness to fulfil the important commandment to honour ones parents (jewish or not, in-laws or biological), to seek peace and to not cause Hilul Hashem (as added in comments), and to not place a stumbling block.</p>\n\n<p>But mainly, one should seek to <em>\"be holy\"</em> as many commandments flatly state, and one should consider what a truly godly person filled with divine chesed and compassion and love, would do.</p>\n\n<p>Although a personal feeling and not a statement of law, I do feel that is all the reason a person and their family and community should really require, for the decision to welcome their in-laws warmly and with deep respect and love, to their wedding, and grant them all honours that are not explicitly forbidden on the highest authority of an explicit negative commandment to grant them, as befitting the most blessed biological (or indeed any other) parents of one of the marrying couple on that day. The rest (to paraphrase Hillel) seems to me, to just be explanation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This depends on your LOR and / or Bet Din.

The root of אצילות is אצל, meaning next to, it is still close to the divine unity. It is only after that world that we begin to see any differentiation I.e. Pirud.

Here is the beginning of the first exposition (please read the rest from the link).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Sages said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Young students came today\n  to the study hall and said things the likes of which were not said\n  even in the days of Joshua bin Nun. These children who only knew the\n  Hebrew alphabet interpreted the letters homiletically.</p>\n  \n  <p>Alef beit means learn [elaf] the wisdom [bina] of the Torah. Gimmel\n  dalet means give to the poor [gemol dalim]. Why is the leg of the\n  gimmel extended toward the dalet? Because it is the manner of one who\n  bestows loving-kindness to pursue the poor. And why is the leg of the\n  dalet extended toward the gimmel? It is so that a poor person will\n  make himself available to him who wants to give him charity. And why\n  does the dalet face away from the gimmel? It is to teach that one\n  should give charity discreetly so that the poor person will not be\n  embarrassed by him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The thought is an understanding of the Hebrew alphabet but not a key to interpreting the letters in different words.</p>\n\n<p>Later on in the same passage, the letters are interpreted in a different way:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemara cites another midrash that also deals with the letters of\n  the alphabet. This one uses a code in which the first letter is paired\n  with the last letter, the second letter with the penultimate one, and\n  so on [alef tav, beit shin]. Alef tav, God said: If he despised Me\n  [oti ti’ev] would I desire [etaveh] him? Beit shin: If he does not\n  desire to worship Me [bi], shall My name [shemi] rest upon him? Gimmel\n  reish: He defiled his body [gufo]; shall I have mercy [araḥem] on him?\n  The word comprised of the letters gimmel and reish in Aramaic means\n  licentiousness. Dalet kuf: He locked My doors [daltotai], shall I not\n  cut off his horns [karnav]? To this point, the Gemara interpreted the\n  letters as referring to the attribute of the wicked. </p>\n  \n  <p>However, with regard to the attribute of the righteous it is taught\n  differently. Alef tav, beit shin: If you have shame [ata bosh], gimmel\n  reish, dalet kuf: If you do so, you will reside [gur] in the heavens\n  [bedok], as the verse says: “Who stretches out the Heavens like a\n  curtain [dok]” (Isaiah 40:22). Heh tzadi, vav peh: There is a\n  partition [ḥatzitza havei] between you and anger [af]. Zayin ayin, ḥet\n  samekh, tet nun: And you will not be shaken [mizdaze’a] by the Satan.\n  Yod mem, kaf lamed: The minister of Gehenna said before the Holy One,\n  Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, send the righteous as well into\n  the sea to which all go [yam kol], Gehenna.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(see the link for more examples.)

Therefore, these mitzvot must be performed at the time the Jews left Egypt, after sunset following the day of the 14th of Nisan.</p>\n\n<p>I said that this is true, unless you choose to bring yom tov in early (earlier than sunset). I rationalized that, just as with Shabbat, once you bring in yom tov, you can perform kiddush (even if before sunset). And, when you get to the part of the seder to eat Matzah, you can also fulfill this obligation as well.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is, if you choose to bring in yom tov early, do you still have to wait until sunset to start the seder and say kiddush (fulfilling the obligation of drinking the first of the four cups of wine)?

And how did it develop from G-d's eyes view (for we hold that G-d is one to decide on a person's wealth)?</p>\n\n<p><em>Please note: the question is NOT about poverty or the relative perception of wealth and happiness - the question is about the VAST DIFFERENCE of what people get.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Everyone gets the same --- we all have a lot in life designed to best get us from who we are and where to are to who and where we're supposed to be. The rich get wealth because their souls need those opportunities, and the challenges that come with opportunity and power. The poor get poverty because their souls need its more obvious challenges. Or, a soul can't handle the challenges of poverty of of being middle class and so is spared from the consequent downfall, whereas another soul wouldn't avoid the corruption or other challenges of money, and it's spared. In any case, each soul is getting the life best tailored for its success as a self-refining \"image\" of the Divine.</p>\n\n<p>See the Ramchal (Derekh Hashem 2:3:1) that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/4794/y-e-z\">Y     e     z</a> paraphrases in his answer. </p>\n\n<p>That is why anyone could be rich, regardless of what they own. To quote Ben Zoma (Avos 4:1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איזה הוא עשיר? השמח בחלקו, שנאמר ״יְגִיעַ ַּכּפֶ יָך ּכ ִ י ת ֹאכֵ ל,\n  אַ ׁש ְ רֶ יָך וְ טֹוב לָ ְך״.</p>\n  \n  <p>Who is wealthy? One who is happy with his lot. As it says,\n  “When you eat the labor of your hands, you are enriched and\n  it is good for you.” (Tehillim 128:2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ben Zoma begs the question: While it is good to be happy with what you have, without care,\nit can become a recipe for complacency. If I am content with anything,\nwhat motivates striving?</p>\n\n<p>The the key term to understanding Ben Zoma’s intent is\n“chelko—his portion.” What is a person’s cheileq? Well, we are told, “All\nof Israel has a cheilek l’Olam Haba, a portion toward the World to Come.” (Mishnah Sanhedrin 11:1)\nOur portion is toward — not what we have now, but a goal; in this case a\nlife’s ultimate goal. A person’s cheileq is not what they have in a moment;\nit describes the full path a life takes. In other words, Ben Zoma is not\nadvising that true wealth is to stop striving for something beyond what\nwe have, but to find happiness in the journey of trying to accomplish.</p>\n\n<p>So, given a focus on life's goals and working toward them rather than property and the control it gives us, the disparity takes on a whole new light.</p>\n\n<p>There is a story told (Taanis 24b) of R' Chanina ben Dosa, a man so holy that the Talmud tells numerous stories of miracles that occured to him. And yet one so poor that a heavenly Voice commented that the whole world was supported by R' Chanina's merit, but he himself lived off a small measure of carob from one Friday to the next.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually his wife just couldn't handle the abject poverty any longer. He agreed to her request that he pray for wealth. A heavenly hand came down and handed them a huge golden table leg. Certainly worth a fortune.</p>\n\n<p>That night, R' Chanina's wife had a dream. They were in heaven, and all the other couples were sitting at three legged tables. Except for them. Their table only had two legs, it couldn't stand.</p>\n\n<p>Realizing that the third leg of their table was the gift they had received, she asked her husband to pray for it to be taken back. And it was.</p>\n\n<p>R' Chaim Vilozhiner associates the three legs of the table in this story with the mishnah (Avos 1:2) about the three pillars of the world: Torah, Divine service, and acts of charity.

For reasons explained earlier, Hashem made a great variety of methods of good and evil, and He therefore presented a multitude of opportunities to present the different challenges. This necessitates people having very different situations and circumstances, each of which present an element of test in a certain domain. For example, the existence of wealth enables a particular set of challenges associated with wealth, and the existence of poverty enables a different set of challenges. In this way, Hashem divides the complete set of challenges among mankind, each having his unique challenge according to his unique set of character and circumstances, and between all of them Hashem's mission will be fulfilled. However, understanding of the specifics of this division is beyond our capacity to grasp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a footnote, R' Chaim Friedlander explains that it is precisely this variety of circumstance and challenge that makes it possible that we all share together in a universal mission. Because my part is uniquely mine, and yours is uniquely yours, but they both contribute to the completion of the greater picture, we are each an integral part of one project and earn a place in the total perfection created between everyone.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did Rabban Shim'on ben Gamli'el accept the stipulation of the court?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Demai.7.3?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Demay 7:3</a>) gives the case of a worker who doesn't trust his employer to separate tithes. The worker has to separate tithes himself, i.e. 1% (1 fig out of 100) for terumat ma'aser, and ma'aser sheni which he then redeems on a coin. There are three opinions (as explained by the Rash, followed by Bartenura):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Tanna kamma: The worker has to set aside a fig uneaten to make up for the loss of one fig he causes to the owner by taking the tithes from the owner's property.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rabban Shim'on ben Gamli'el: He has to set aside a fig, but has to buy another one, because not eating one would harm his ability to work for the employer.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rabbi Yosi: He doesn't have to set aside a fig because of the stipulation of the court (תנאי בית דין), which requires the employer to pay for terumat ma'aser.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the court made a stipulation, I would assume that it would be public and not something known only to Rabbi Yosi. The first tanna of our mishna and Rabban Shim'on ben Gamli'el, as well as Rabban Gamli'el, who fed his workers demay (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Demai.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Demay 3:1</a>), all seem to have been unaware of it.</p>\n\n<p>Rabban Shim'on ben Gamli'el, who was the prince, had been in controversy with the head of the court, Rabbi Natan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Horayot.13b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horayot 13b</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible that Rabban Shim'on ben Gamli'el didn't accept the court's stipulation? Alternatively, was the stipulation made only after Rabban Shim'on ben Gamli'el stated his opinion? Or was it, for some reason, known only to Rabbi Yosi?</p>\n\n\n",

The new edition (2016) is very valuable. The book is annoted by the editor. The annotations called Cochve Yaaqov are very numerous on the introduction and make it easier to understand. This introduction is very short. One of the particularities of this work is that it is constitutive of what was one of the bases of the Qabala of the first generations of Chasidim.

But Ramchal writes in a very concise way and is hard to grasp. There is no classical book unanimously accepted. The main problem is to learn that Qabbala is to avoid confusion between abstraction of concepts and words used in common language, it's not easy to leave concrete thinking. Anyways the Shomer Emunim is almost universally accepted as the first step. There are books with definitions, as klale hatchalat hachochma, compilated from Ramchal and Gra, but in my experience they don't help as Shomer Emunim. Sefer Habrit is well known. I don't know it. Many tendencies learn Sifre Rav Chayim Vital at first, Otsrot Chayim, but with Shyur only. Some tendencies are mistrustful toward books there are not from Ramaq or Ari.</p>\n<p>Note :. I'm not able to understand Qabbala, but I make efforts to learn it a little.

    "content": "# Circular reasoning in deriving the time that kohanim can eat terumah and the time that the evening Shema can be recited\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The very first Mishnah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37939&st=&pgnum=62\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 1:1</a>) states that the earliest time for the recitation of the evening <em>Shema</em> is the time that <em>kohanim</em> can eat <em>terumah</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאימתי קורין את שמע בערבין משעה שהכהנים נכנסים לאכול בתרומתן</p>\n<p>MISHNAH. FROM WHAT TIME MAY ONE RECITE THE SHEMA' IN THE EVENING? FROM THE TIME THAT THE PRIESTS ENTER [THEIR HOUSES] IN ORDER TO EAT THEIR <em>TERUMAH</em> (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>; <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5014/13438\">capitals in original</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 2a</a>) attempts to figure out what time this refers to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר מר משעה שהכהנים נכנסים לאכול בתרומתן מכדי כהנים אימת קא אכלי תרומה משעת צאת הכוכבים לתני משעת צאת הכוכבים מלתא אגב אורחיה קמשמע לן כהנים אימת קא אכלי בתרומה משעת צאת הכוכבים והא קמשמע לן דכפרה לא מעכבא כדתניא ובא השמש וטהר ביאת שמשו מעכבתו מלאכול בתרומה ואין כפרתו מעכבתו מלאכול בתרומה</p>\n<p>The Master said: FROM THE TIME THAT THE PRIESTS ENTER TO EAT THEIR '<em>TERUMAH</em>'. When do the priests eat <em>terumah</em>? From the time of the appearance of the stars. Let him then say: 'From the time of the appearance of the stars'? — This very thing he wants to teach us, in passing, that the priests may eat <em>terumah</em> from the time of the appearance of the stars. And he also wants to teach us that the expiatory offering is not indispensable,  as it has been taught:  And when the sun sets we-taher,  the setting of the sun is indispensable [as a condition of his fitness] to eat <em>terumah</em>, but the expiatory offering is not indispensable to enable him to eat <em>terumah</em>. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino tranlation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This reasoning seems a bit circular to me. We only know that the time for <em>Shema</em> is <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> because that is the time for <em>kohanim</em> to eat <em>terumah</em>, but we only know that that is the time for <em>kohanim</em> to eat <em>terumah</em> because that is the time for <em>Shema</em>. So how do we know either one in the first place? According to the Talmud it appears that this Mishnah is the source for both the time for <em>kohanim</em> eating <em>terumah</em> being <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> and the time for <em>Shema</em> being <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> (from the fact that the two events are equated), yet the Mishnah doesn't mention <em>tzeit hakochavim</em> at all! It seems like we're going in a circle — we derive the time for <em>Shema</em> from the time for eating <em>terumah</em> but we then derive the time for eating <em>terumah</em> from the time for <em>Shema</em>. Thus, we seem to have no original source for either one stating that the time is <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>.</p>\n<p>If the above wasn't so clear, we can rephrase it as follows:</p>\n<p>The whole point of this Mishnah is to tell us the time for <em>Shema</em>. That means that prior to this Mishnah we don't know the time for <em>Shema</em>. The <em>Mishnah</em> tells us the time for <em>Shema</em> as a function of the time for eating <em>terumah</em> in order to also teach us the time for eating <em>terumah</em> (by informing us that it's the same as the time for <em>Shema</em>), which means that prior to this <em>Mishnah</em> we are not supposed to know the time for eating <em>terumah</em> either. The problem is that if prior to this Mishnah we don't know either time, then telling us that the two times are the same doesn't actually tell us what the time is. All we should know after reading this Mishnah is that <em>Shema</em> can be recited when <em>terumah</em> can be eaten and <em>terumah</em> can be eaten when <em>Shema</em> can be recited. But we should have no way of knowing that that time is <em>tzeit hakochavim</em>.</p>\n<p>How can we understand how we derive the times for eating <em>terumah</em> and reciting <em>Shema</em> from this Mishnah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer is as follows:</p>\n<p>The Talmud immediately cites a <em>beraita</em> which discusses a Scriptural derivation for the time when <em>terumah</em> can be eaten:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כדתניא ובא השמש וטהר ביאת שמשו מעכבתו מלאכול בתרומה ואין כפרתו מעכבתו מלאכול בתרומה וממאי דהאי ובא השמש ביאת השמש והאי וטהר טהר יומא דילמא</p>\n<p>as it has been taught:  And when the sun sets we-taher,  the setting of the sun is indispensable [as a condition of his fitness] to eat terumah, but the expiatory offering is not indispensable to enable him to eat terumah. But how do you know that these words 'and the sun sets' mean the setting of the sun, and this 'we-taher' means that the day clears away? It means perhaps: And when the sun [of the next morning] appears, and we-taher means the man becomes clean?  — Rabbah son of R. Shila explains: In that case, the text would have to read we-yithar.  What is the meaning of we-taher?  The day clears away, conformably to the common expression, The sun has set and the day has cleared away.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/berakoth/berakoth_2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see here that there are two ways to interpret the verse. One way would have the time for eating <em>terumah</em> as nightfall, while the other would have it the next morning. By linking this law to the recitation of the evening Shema, the Mishnah automatically eliminates the second reading of the verse. It can't be that <em>terumah</em> can't be eaten until the next day, because the time for reciting the evening Shema obviously can't be the next morning. Thus, the Mishnah is not telling us the precise time for when <em>terumah</em> can be eaten; it merely points us to one of the two already known possibilities. Once we know which of the possibilities it is we can then apply that time back to the Mishnah as the time for reciting Shema.</p>\n<p>(This answer is at least somewhat inspired by the Rashba's commentary on this passage, but I'm not sure if this is actually what the Rashba means.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one invite a Noachide to the Seder Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I just read that the Rogatchover Gaon ruled that a Noachide can become a Ger Toshav on his own, without Rabbinical approval (which is otherwise impossible until the yovel is declared), by simply accepting the Sheva Bnei Noachide laws. Razin d'Orayta, p. 97, §33.</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1798425/jewish/Correcting-Halachic-Misunderstandings.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Chabad\">Chabad</a> of all people seems to take an opposite approach to non-converts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One may not invite a non-Jew to a Yom Tov meal unless Shabbat\n  coincides with that Yom Tov. The reason for this is that one may\n  inadvertently cook for the non-Jew on Yom Tov, which is forbidden. On\n  Shabbat when one may not cook in any case, it is permitted to invite a\n  non-Jew. If the non-Jew comes without being invited, one may feed\n  him on a regular Yom Tov as well but may not cook or heat up food for\n  him. There is no distinction between the Pesach Seder and other Yom\n  Tov days in this regard.\n  Orach Chaim 512:1, Shulchan Aruch HaRav ibid, 2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I tried halachapedia and I consulted Divine Code but couldn't find anything. They all wrote the same thing, that a goy/Goya is prohibited to participate in holidays as they weren't commanded to, unless they were invited, they acted duplicitously, or it was Shabbat. Nothing about a Giyoret Toshavah or a Giyoret Tzedeket. Obviously, an aku\"m can't make new holidays, and I can see why nachrim would be prohibited as they are actively refusing to get with the picture, maybe the Chasidei Umot Ha-olam or even  the Chochmei Umot Ha-olam, as these people are technically stam goyim, but once a Noachidess goes the extra step as a Toshavah but doesn't want to convert to a full blown Tzedeket, don't they have enough of a yiddisher neshamah to participate in Pesach? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The piece you quoted from Chabad.org has the answer. The reason it's forbidden to invite a non-Jew to a yom tov meal is because it's forbidden to cook for them on yom tov as the allowance to cook is for the purpose of fulfilling the mitzvah of seudas yom tov (which doesn't apply to someone who isn't Jewish). The rabbis were concerned that in the process of preparing the meal, some of the cooking will be done for the non-Jew, violating a prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>This applies regardless of whether the person is a ger toshav, oveid avodah zarah, or somewhere inbetween. They are not permitted to be invited to the seder. This even applies to someone who is in the process of becoming a ger tzedek (convert to Judaism). Such a person cannot be invited to a yom tov meal the normal way either. Technically, there are loopholes that allow a non-Jew to participate in a yom tov meal, which we take advantage of for potential converts. But the basic halacha is that non-Jews cannot be invited to these meals.</p>\n\n\n",

This is due to the fact that their main 'job' is being educated, which supercedes almost everything, including building the Bais Hamikdash. And this is actally brought down explicitly in the Halacha, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.165.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 165:11</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַמְלַמֵּד, צָרִיךְ לֵישֵׁב וּלְלַמֵּד אֶת הַתִּינוֹקוֹת כָּל הַיּוֹם\n  וּקְצָת מִן הַלַּיְלָה, כְּדֵי לְחַנְּכָם לִלְמֹד בַּיּוֹם\n  וּבַלָּיְלָה. וְלֹא יְבַטְּלוּ הַתִּינוֹקוֹת כְּלָל, חוּץ מֵעֶרֶב\n  שַׁבָּת וְעֶרֶב יוֹם טוֹב בְּסוֹף הַיוֹם. <strong>אֵין מְבַטְּלִין אֶת\n  הַתִּינוֹקוֹת אֲפִלוּ לְבִנְיַן בֵּית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ</strong>. </p>\n  \n  <p>The teacher must teach the children the entire day and part of the\n  evening, in order to train them to study Torah by day and by night.

Touger):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Similarly, he (the king of Israel) may take wives and concubines from\n  the entire territory of Eretz Yisrael. The term 'wives' implies women\n  who were married with A ketubah and kiddushin; concubines, women who\n  were not given A ketubah and kiddushin. With the act of yichud alone,\n  the king acquires her and relations with her are permitted him. A\n  commoner is forbidden to have a concubine. The only similar\n  relationship is the union with a Hebrew maid servant after she has\n  been designated by her master.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, some  Torah scholars have pointed out that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Nevi'îm report cases of Jewish men who, despite not being kings of Israel, had pilagshim;</p></li>\n<li><p>Neither the Tanakh nor the Talmud report the prohibition of the pilegesh to a  commoner. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Among these scholars there are very authoritative rabbis such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Ya'avetz (Rabbi Yaakov Emden;we can read the English translation of his responsum at <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/faxes/RYE_pilegesh.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/faxes/RYE_pilegesh.pdf</a> ); </p></li>\n<li><p>Ramban, as reported by his student Rahsba in Teshuvot haRashba Meyuchas LehaRamban No. 284 ,whose Hebrew text is here  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_haRashba_Meyuchas_LehaRamban.284?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_haRashba_Meyuchas_LehaRamban.284?lang=bi</a>\n( on the basis of this step, among other things, Nachmanides would have maintained that Rambam did not at all reserve the pilegesh for the only king of Israel, a position that creates considerable exegetical problems in relation to the text of Melachim uMilchamot 4: 4 in our possession;</p></li>\n<li><p>The Vilna Gaon, commenting the beginning of the Laws of Kiddushin in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9727&st=&pgnum=150\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer 26:1:6-7</a>; also this master, like Nachmanides, says that Rambam allows the pilegesh to ordinary Jewish men.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is clear that an extraordinary jurist like Rambam must have identified a precise halachic source to support his position: but what source do we talk about, if not even magnificent rabbis such as Ya'avetz, Ramban and the Vilna Gaon identified it?</p>\n\n<p>The problem of why Nachmanides and the Vilna Gaon say that Rambam allows pilegesh to all men  remains moreover open. The orthodox rabbi Dovid E. Eidensohn supports a particular exegetical thesis about this question, accessible at the link\n <a href=\"http://torahhalacha.blogspot.com/2018/07/ramban-and-rambam-permit-pilegesh.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://torahhalacha.blogspot.com/2018/07/ramban-and-rambam-permit-pilegesh.html</a></p>\n\n<p>but I don't know how much it is shared in the world Jewish.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I personally develop an answer to my question, thanks to the advice that I requested and kindly obtained on the subject from Rav Dr. Ratzon Arusi, authoritative scholar of Rambam's thought, and pupil of the famous and renowned master Rav Yosef Qafih (Kapach).</p>\n<p>Rav Dr Arusi told me that  the common printed version of Mishneh Torah-Hilchot Melachim 4: 4, where we read that the pilagshim have neither ketubah nor kiddushin, is not the correct version.</p>\n<p>In fact in the Yemeni manuscripts of the Mishneh Torah, unanimously considered the most reliable sources for the reconstruction of the original text of the work, Rambam states that the pilagshim are \"without ketubah and kiddushin\",that is \"without ketubah and with kiddushin\", in line with the position expressed by R. Meir in Yerushalmi (Ketubot 5: 2), and with the version of Gemara-Sanhedrin 21a possessed by other important masters such as Rashi.\nRav Dr. Arusi told me that Rambam considers it lawful for the king alone to have pilagshim since, while the obligation of kiddushin is \"de’oraita\", deriving from the mitzva of Deuteronomy 23:18, and is therefore a precept that even the king must observe (and in fact the only act of yichud beetween  the king and the woman  has the juridical effect equivalent to kiddushin), the obligation of the ketubah is \"derabbanan\", having been instituted by the Sages of Israel to prevent the husband from divorcing his wife easily, as the fundamental requirement of the ketubah is the sum that the husband has to pay to his wife in case of divorce.But since the king of Israel is a rich man and is considered to be very generous, there is no need to protect his wife with the obligation of the ketubah; Halakhah therefore exempts the king from this obligation, also because the king's pilagshim, as Rambam always states in Hilchot Melachim 4: 4, are employed by the king himself as his workers, and therefore enjoy a salary.\nI then asked Rav Dr. Arusi why the Tanakh speaks of men who, although not kings of Israel, had pilagshim, and Rav. Dr. Arusi replied that they took pilagshim when the derabbanam obligation to stipulate ketubah with a woman was not yet in force, which made the pilagshut relationship lawful in those days also for non-kings.</p>\n\n\n",

(Y'vamos 10:4)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishnah, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.10.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Y'vamos</em> 10:4</a>, quotes Rabbi Yosi as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל שפוסל על ידי אחרים פוסל על ידי עצמו, וכל שאין פוסל על ידי אחרים אינו פוסל על ידי עצמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I correctly understand the explanation of the רע״ב and ר׳ קהתי based on ר׳ יצחק נפחא in the Talmud, R. Yosi means this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Suppose Aaron is married to Miriam, and her sister Leah is married to Baruch. Miriam and Baruch both leave the country and are determined to be dead based on testimony. (In the case of each death, either two witnesses inform the survivors and are believed, or one witness informs the court and the court declares the person dead.) Then Aaron marries Leah, but then Miriam and Baruch show up alive.</p>\n<p>Well, if Aaron and Miriam were only <a href=\"/tags/kiddushin-eirusin/info\"><em>kidushin</em></a>-married, then we're afraid people will think that they weren't married at all (because the <em>kidushin</em> were based on a condition that wasn't met, for example) [and won't know about Leah and Baruch's marriage], and will thus think Aaron and Leah's marriage was valid. So we require Aaron to issue a bill of divorce to Leah, lest people think she can end a marriage without one. Therefore Leah cannot now go back to Baruch (because she looks like someone who's been married to another man, who cannot go back to her previous husband) and Miriam cannot go back to Aaron (because she looks like his divorcee's sister, which is a prohibited relationship).</p>\n<p>But if Aaron and Miriam were fully married, then we aren't afraid people will think they were never married. Therefore, no bill of divorce as outlined above is necessary. Therefore, Leah doesn't look like Aaron's divorcee and so no one is prohibited to her previous husband.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Aaron and Miriam were fully married, I don't understand why Leah can go back to Baruch. Back in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.10.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10:1</a> we say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האשה שהלך בעלה למדינת הים ובאו ואמרו לה \"מת בעליך\" וניסת ואחר כך בא בעלה, תצא מזה ומזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— that a woman who married based on incorrect information that her husband had died cannot go back to him. R. Yosi doesn't argue that point there (though he does argue another). Why can Leah go back to Baruch?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The question is why Mishna 1 doen't apply and how can Leah come back to Baruch according to Rabbi Yose. To find the answer, we need to add one statement in quotation of Mishna 1 and 3.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצריכה גט מזה ומזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Leah needs a get from Aharon and from Baruch.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' יוסי אומר כל שפוסל ע\"י אחרים פוסל ע\"י עצמו\n  וכל שאין פוסל ע\"י אחרים אינו פוסל ע\"י עצמו</p>\n  \n  <p>רבי יצחק נפחא אמר לעולם אסיפא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Yitschack Nafcha says that the second statement of Rabbi Yose, which is lenient comparatively to Tana Kama opinion, says that when Leah can come back to Baruch, so, indeed, Myriam can come back to Aharon. And the case in which Leah can come back to Baruch doesn't exist according to Tana Kama. Because Tana Kama holds that the prohibition for Leah to marry back Baruch is simply a Knas because she didn't verify enough her husband death. But for Rabbi Yose, there is no such Knas. The only problem is when it's shows as Baruch takes back his divorced and remarried and divorced wife. And when Leah was obviously in the hallachic impossibility to be married to Aharon, everybody knows that the relationship between Leah and Aharon wasn't marrital. It was an involuntary biat znut. Since we assume that Baruch is not Cohen, Leah will come back to Baruch. Aharon doesn't give her a Get. Therefore, Myriam doesn't seem to be the sister of his divorced Leah. He is allowed to come back to Myriam.</p>\n\n<p>The reason is that Rabbi Yose disagrees with Tana Kama (1) regarding the rational of Mishna 1. According to Rabbi Yose in Mishna 1 the reason for the prohibition for Leah to come back to Baruch is that people may think that she divorced and afterwards married another man and next married a second time Baruch. And we need to make clear that it's prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>In our case, marriage doesn't match between Leah and Aharon, because she is the sister of his wife. Now people see that Myriam is alive and understand that marriage between Aharon and Leah was nothing. So, Aharon will not give a Get to Leah. And people will not think that Leah comes back to Baruch through a second marriage after she divorced her second husband. So Mishna 1 is not a contradiction to the Din of Rabbi Yose.</p>\n\n<p>Source of this answer is Rashi 95b.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>לעולם אסיפא... ... וקא\"ל רבי יוסי אשתו דליכא למימר תנאה הואי ליה - להאי באשתו ראשונה וכ\"ע ידעי דנשואי שניה טעות הן ולא אתי למימר גירשה בעלה ונשאה זה Rabbi Yose is teaching a leniency, in his last sentence. because he (Aharon) married his first wife (Myriam),  in a way which cannot lead to believe that there was an unfulfilled condition. (Because this marriage was followed by an intercourse and a man is not suspected to make a non marrital intercourse, called biat znut)\n  and a marriage invo. Since his first wife (Myriam) is undoubtedly his wife,  everybody knows that the marriage with  the second wife (Leah) was only an error.</p></li>\n  <li><p>דהא אפילו גירשה בעלה אסורה להאי ומידע ידעי דסהדי אטעינהו אינו פוסל ע\"י גיסו כשאר אשה הנשאת בעד אחד דהתם הוא דאתי למימר גירש זה כו' ואי מחזיר אמרי זה מחזיר גרושתו מן הנשואין Even if we would believe that Baruch divorced Leah, the prohibition of Leah towards Aharon doesn't change. Therefore, when people see that both sisters Myriam and Leah are alive together, they know that the marriage between Aharon and Leah was erroneous and not valid.\n  Remember that it's impossible to marry the sister of his own divorced wife. There is in this case a leniency which is not possible in the standard case. The standard case is the case in which Leah married a man who have nothing to do with Myriam. And if Leah is divorced from Baruch, the marriage with the man matches. So, if Baruch comes back to Myriam, this looks as if he takes back his divorced woman after her second marriage with another man.</p></li>\n  <li><p>אבל הכא לא הלכך אין פוסל נמי על ידי עצמו Since this case is not similar to the standard case, and Aharon can take back Myriam.</p></li>\n  <li><p>אבל היכא דהואי קמייתא ארוסתו דאיכא למימר תנאה הוה ליה בקדושין סברי אינשי דנשואי שניה נשואין גמורין ואמרי גירשה בעלה ונשאה זה  But if Myriam was only mekuddeshet, people will say that the Kiddushin were conditioned. So the true marriage of Aharon is with Leah. People will say that Baruch divorced Leah and she further married Aharon</p></li>\n  <li><p>ואי משום אחות אשה תנאה הוה לו בקדושי ראשונה ולא נתקיים </p></li>\n  <li><p>ואי הדרא אשת גיסו לבעלה אמרי אינשי מותר להחזיר גרושתו משניסת הלכך הוא פוסל על ידי אחרים והואיל ואהנו מעשיו פוסל נמי ע\"י עצמו  Leah cannot go back to Baruch because people will say he returned his divorced after she divorced from a second marriage and people would believe that there is no problem to remarry his first wife if she divorced from her second husband.</p></li>\n  <li><p>ולתנא קמא טעמא דהניסת בעד אחד אסורה לחזור לאו משום שמא יאמרו זה מחזיר גרושתו משנשאת אלא משום דקנסוה רבנן משום דלא דייקא שפיר הלכך כל מאן דנסבה פסל לה אקמא: But according to Tana Kama Leah is always prohibited for Baruch because chachamim punished her as if she did cheat her husband intentionally. (This point, to regard him as she didn't make a sufficient effort to check that her husband died is discussed in folio 92a, and there, Rashi explaining Rav Nachman, is congruent to his words here)</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

My purpose in creating this account and posting this question is both to get specific answers about virtual \"places\" where I can still have a sense of community as well as hopefully attain a sense of community here. I suspect this is more of a Q and A anonymous information hub  than a community, but I don't know. </p>\n\n<p>So, to follow the rules, my specific questions are: </p>\n\n<p>-Is there a \"community\" here? </p>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<p>-Where are some \"good\" virtual Jewish communities that would help someone like me not feel alone? </p>\n\n<p>Thanks!

They were commanded to take a lamb on the 10th of Nissan and keep it for 4 days, and then slaughter it as the sacrifice. The 10th was on Shabbat. A write up includes the following statement</p>\n\n<p>Commenting on the greatness of the day, the Halacha Yomi from Dirshu writes, (discussing the role of \"eved\", slave and not following the statement that \"slavery\" <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/98014/1362\">ended</a> on Rosh Hashana)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Slaves cannot possibly possess anything of their own since immediately upon acquisition of anything, the owner takes possession. On Rosh Chodesh Nissan Hashem commanded that on the upcoming tenth day of the month each man should acquire a lamb for his household. In effect, this mitzvah was to restore their humanity and liberty that was denied to them their entire lives. Acquiring a lamb was to grant them the rights and ability to possess their own personal property. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wouldn't this process call for a few actions which are violations of Sabbath rules?

Here's some of what I have seen:</p>\n<p>The shank bone symbolizes the Pesach sacrifice. Since there is no <em>Beit Hamikdash</em>, we can't offer the Pesach lamb. So there seems to be two customs regarding avoiding demonstrating that we are eating the Pesach lamb:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Many people have the custom not to eat roasted meat on Seder night so as not to think one is eating the Pesach offering outside the <em>Beit HaMikdash</em></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When we say \"Pesach zu\" in the <em>Maggid</em> section, we don't point to the bone on the seder plate, whereas we point / lift the matzah and maror.</p>\n<p>Thus, following these precedents, I would assume that one should not eat the bone.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I have read that one <em>must</em> eat the bone since food prepared for that day of Pesach must be eaten that day and not the next day. Otherwise, this becomes a problem of preparing from one day to the next.</p>\n<p>So, should you eat it as part of the Seder meal, or should you wait until the morning, or what? And why would waiting matter, anyway?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the bone was prepared before Yom Tov, why would there be any problem of <em>hachanah</em> surely we could use it for both nights without having to eat it?</p>\n<p>In short, what's the \"final word\" on this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Mishna Berura 473.4 sk 32</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(לב) וכן נוהגין בעירנו - לצלות הביצה. ואסור לאכול הזרוע בלילה דאין אוכלין צלי בלילה אבל הביצה אף שהיא צלויה מותר שאין איסור צלי בביצה ולפ\"ז אסור לצלות הזרוע בלילה אלא מבעו\"י אם לא שדעתו לאכלו למחר באותו היום וע\"כ אם שכח וצלאו בלילה יזהר לאכלו מחר בבקר כ\"כ המ\"א ושארי אחרונים ואם דעתו שלא לאכול הביצה עד ליל ב' גם הביצה אסור לצלותה בלילה אלא מבעוד יום. כתב בח\"א רע עלי המעשה שזורקין הזרוע והוא ביזוי מצוה. ומצוה להניח ביו\"ט שני בבקר לתוך הצלי שצולין ליו\"ט ואוכלין אותו: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end of the <em>seif koton</em>, he quotes Chaye Adam who feels  with the fact that some people throw the <em>zeroa</em> in the Bin.

True, the mind lacks the body, but it has a clear idea of ​​what is happening in the physical world. The person knows that he has died.\nFor the first seven days after the death, the soul wanders back and forth from the house to the grave, and weeps over her body.

According to R' Aryeh Carmell's \"Aiding Talmud Study\", R' Yochanan flourished around 250 CE and R' Yirmiyah around 330 CE. The Jerusalem Talmud was completed around 360 CE. At that time, the Byzantine empire converted to Christianity, leading to the persecution of the Jews. The Rabbis who were in Israel fled to Bavel, bringing their knowledge with them. This is why we often <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shevuot.20b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">find</a> the gemara saying when \"Rav Dimi came\" or \"when Ravin came\". Their knowledge was incorporated into the Babylonian Talmud which was completed circa 460 CE. This is why halacha follows the Babylonian Talmud, as the Israeli tradition was incorporated into it, and the leading Rabbis were in Bavel.</p>\n<p>Tl;dr: These Amoraim lived before either Talmud was written, so they were not referring to the canonized Talmud but the talmud (literally: study) of their time.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How early in the process can the accused sotah refuse to drink?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>mishnayot</em> in the first chapter of Sotah describe the beginning of the process -- the accusing husband brings her to the court where they try to intimidate her into confessing, and if she doesn't they take her to the temple gate and begin humiliating her (loosening her hair, baring her breasts, etc).  In 3:3 it then says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If she said, \"I will not drink [it]\" before the scroll was erased, the scroll is archived, and her meal-offering is scattered on the ashes. [...] [However,] if the scroll was erased and she said, \"I will not drink [it],\" we force her mouth open and make her drink against her will.

If she says from the time her husband first brings her to the court that she will refuse, do they go through with the intimidation and humiliation anyway?</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, maybe they do because they hope it will get her to confess.  On the other hand, the humiliation is at least immodest (as well as embarrassing), so one might think that if they could avoid <em>unnecessary</em> immodesty they would.  </p>\n\n<p>The mishna describes a sequence -- the man brings her, the court intimidates, they bring her to the gate, etc -- and I can't tell from when \"if she refuses to drink\" applies.  (It's only mentioned after they've written the curse.)  I'm not saying they would <em>want</em> to humiliate her if she's already refused, but maybe they're required to (just as the man is required to bring her if witnesses have testified that she was secluded after being warned).</p>\n\n<p>If she refuses any time before they erase, the outcome is the same -- she's divorced without her <em>ketubah</em>.

This is explicitly stated in the Magein Avraham Orach Chaim 538,6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם עשה דבר שאינו אבד בח\"ה אפי' לבנו קנסו רבנן (נ\"י) ומאבדין אותה ממנו ודוקא למ\"ד מלאכת ח\"ה דאוריי' (רי\"ו) ונ\"ל דדמי לעושה מלאכה בשבת שאסו' לו לעולם וה\"ה לבנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However the Shach Yore Dea 99,6 12 says: If the food was cooked via an Issur Deoraisa for example <em>Bittul lechatchila</em> (on purposely mixing less than a 60th of Treif food with Kosher food so that its nullified), one can sell the food to a Gentile or a Jew who pays no more than what a gentile will pay. The Pri Megadim explains that since the price the gentile will  pay is the same whether there is treif food or Kosher food, the Jew has not gained from his sin (he could have sold the Treif food separately from the kosher food to the Gentile without mixing them both, for the same price):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסורים למכרו לישראל.לי נראה דדוקא כשהישראל לוקח ביוקר מהעובדי כוכבים אסור דאי לאו הכי אין טעם לאסרו למכור לישראל דהא לא אהני מעשיו הרעים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we can deduce that if one sells the food he cooked on Shabbos for the cheaper price of the raw ingredients rather than the expensive price of the cooked product, since he has not gained from his Transgression of cooking on Shabbos, this is permitted.</p>\n\n\n",

If it flew back and forth multiple times it does not cause further invalidation since even if they are mixed up, there are at least two [valid] birds remaining.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Birds are flying back and forth (one at a time) between the two groups of four, ending with four and four. The mishna allows each owner to offer two of the birds in front of them. I glean from this mishna that the minimum number of pairs we are able to offer in this case (even after much mix-up) is equal to the the number we could offer if all birds were mixed into one group.</p>\n<p>The next mishna (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h5b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:3</a>) speaks of owners each with different numbers of birds (translation edited from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kinnim.2.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לזו אחת, ולזו שתיים, ולזו שלוש, ולזו ארבע, ולזו חמש, ולזו שש, ולזו שבע--פרח מן הראשונה לשנייה, לשלישית, לרביעית, לחמישית, לשישית, לשביעית, וחזר--פוסל אחד בהליכתו, ואחד בחזירתו:  הראשונה והשנייה, אין להן כלום; השלישית, יש לה אחת; הרביעית, יש לה שתיים; החמישית, יש לה שלוש; השישית, יש לה ארבע; והשביעית, יש לה שש.  פרח וחזר--פוסל אחד בהליכתו, ואחד בחזירתו:  השלישית והרביעית, אין להן כלום; החמישית, יש לה אחת; והשישית, יש לה שתיים; השביעית, יש לה חמש.  פרח וחזר--פוסל אחד בהליכתו, ואחד בחזירתו:  החמישית והשישית, אין להן כלום; והשביעית, יש לה ארבע.  ויש אומרין, השביעית לא הפסידה כלום.  ואם פרח מבין המתות לכולם, הרי כולם ימותו.</p>\n<p>If this one has one [pair of birds], and this one has two [pairs of birds], this one has three [pairs], this one has four [pairs], this one five [pairs], this one six [pairs] and this one seven [pairs], and one bird flew from the first [group] to the second [group] and one [from the second] into the third, and one [from the third] into the fourth, and one [from the fourth] into the fifth, and one [from the fifth] into the sixth, and one [from the sixth] into the seventh, and then one returned [to its previous group], it invalidates one pair [for each] when it leaves and one pair [for each] upon its return.

For this case, based on this this mishna, no bird that is currently in group A can be brought, and one pair from those currently in group B can be brought. If another bird then flies from A to B, then no bird can be brought (by the last clause of the mishna). From here we see that there is a case where we bring <em>no</em> birds, instead of the one pair we would be allowed to bring if all six birds were mixed together.</p>\n<p>How do I resolve this contradiction?

    "content": "# Why did Hashem reject Cain's Minchah but accepted Abel's?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why did Hashem reject Cain's Minchah but accepted Abel's?</p>\n\n<p>My question is based on <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0104.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 4:3-5</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִי מִקֵּץ יָמִים וַיָּבֵא קַיִן מִפְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה מִנְחָה לַה'׃<br>\n  וְהֶבֶל הֵבִיא גַם־הוּא מִבְּכֹרוֹת צֹאנוֹ וּמֵחֶלְבֵהֶן וַיִּשַׁע ה' אֶל־הֶבֶל וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ׃<br>\n  וְאֶל־קַיִן וְאֶל־מִנְחָתוֹ לֹא שָׁעָה וַיִּחַר לְקַיִן מְאֹד וַיִּפְּלוּ פָּנָיו׃  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This passage states that Cain presented his non-meat-based Minchah, וַיָּבֵא קַיִן מִפְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה, מִנְחָה--לַיהוָה.\nwhereas Abel presented his meat-based Minchah, to Hashem: \nוְהֶבֶל הֵבִיא גַם-הוּא מִבְּכֹרוֹת צֹאנוֹ, וּמֵחֶלְבֵהֶן; וַיִּשַׁע יְהוָה, אֶל-הֶבֶל וְאֶל-מִנְחָתוֹ.</p>\n\n<p>Based on our present-day knowledge that a Minchah is definitely not meat-based but grain-based, one would think Hashem would respect Cain's Minchah instead. However, our passage says otherwise: וְאֶל-קַיִן וְאֶל-מִנְחָתוֹ, לֹא שָׁעָה; וַיִּחַר לְקַיִן מְאֹד, וַיִּפְּלוּ פָּנָיו. </p>\n\n<p>What do the rabbis say?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch writes that usage of מנחה as a flour-and-oil offering is imprecise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The מנחה offering in the Sanctuary is an offering of flour and oil. But we do find מנחה as a general term for offerings - even for animal offerings; thus in Malachi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.1.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.1.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:13</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.2.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:13</a>, and throughout the book of Malachi. Outside the Sanctuary, מנחה denotes a gift, a sign of homage. </p>\n  \n  <p>It is difficult to determine the root of the word מנחה. ... It seems that מנחה stems from the roof נחה, just as מצוה stems from צוה. [The root] נחה means “to lead.” The shepherd leads his flock; the commander leads his army. In short: a leader or commander guides his subordinates. Perhaps this is also the meaning of the מנחה. The offerer submits to the leadership and authority of another, or acknowledges his lordship. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With this explanation, that the term מנחה refers to Karbanos in general, Rav Hirsch explains that the difference between Kayin’s and Hevel’s Karbanos was a difference in attitude:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Kayin brings to G-d מפרי האדמה, some of the produce of the earth, without special selection. After all, he must offer “something” also to G-d. This is an improper attitude, which will later be censured by the prophet Malachi: The relationship to G-d, “religious needs” - they, too, are among the nerds of man, and cannot be ignored entirely. One devoted to them the “lost hours” of life, the lame and the sick and whatever has no other use. As Malachi puts it (Malachi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.1.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:12</a>): וניבו נבזה אכלו; what no one else would wish to eat is given as the altar’s harvest. This is service if G-d that is precipitated by fear. People establish temples and churches in the same spirit in which they build hospitals and prisons. </p>\n  \n  <p>Hevel, however, takes מבכורות צאנו ומחלביהן; he takes from the firstlings of his flock, and from them he selects the very best. He who offers the first and the best attaches primary importance to his relationship with G-d. This relationship is his foremost concern, to which everything else in life is merely subsidiary. What is more, offering the first is always regarded as a substitute regarded as a substitute for dedicating <em>all the rest</em>. As it says explicitly (Shemos <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34:19</a>): וכל מקנך תזכר פטר שור ושה, “<em>All</em> of your herd shall be dedicated by the firstborn of ox or sheep.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It has been translated variously as \"despise lordliness\", \"despise positions of power\", \"hate acting the superior\", \"hate the holding of high office\", \"hate authority over others\", etc. The Gemara even tells us that Joseph died before his brothers because he occupied a position of power. [Sotah 13b]</p>\n\n<p>What bothers me is not the meaning, which is plainly that, while we need leaders, such leaders should not take pleasure in their exercise of authority.  It's the word used.  Doesn't \"Ha-rabbanut הָרַבָּנוּת\" mean \"the rabbinate\"?  Why is that particular word used?  Why bring rabbis (teachers) in particular into this, when there are so many other positions of power?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The simple answer is that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A8%D6%B7%D7%91%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%A0%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%AA.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">רַבָּנוּת</a> doesn't mean \"the rabbinate.\" The Israeli rabbinate of today is called רַבָּנוּת, but it didn't exist in antiquity. The closest thing to an official body of rabbis is the Sanhedrin or the court (בֵּית דִּין), which is not referred to as רַבָּנוּת. The sages as a whole were usually referred to as חֲכָמִים, sometimes רַבּוֹתֵינוּ, but never רַבָּנוּת.</p>\n\n<p>The word רַב means \"master\" (as in the master of a slave, e.g. in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Gittin.4.5?lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gittin 4:5</a>). The word רַבִּי \"my master\" is used as an honorific for sages in the same way that אֲדוֹנִי is used as a term of respect in Hebrew (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.1.15?lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1 Samuel 1:15</a>). The word רַבָּנוּת is a derivative of the meaning \"master\" and not specifically from its usage as an honorific. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sotah.13b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The passage that you quoted</a> as an example of negative portrayal of authority in fact uses the word רַבָּנוּת to describe it.</p>\n\n<p>רַבָּנוּת is probably not the only term that fits here (I think שְׂרָרָה would have also worked), but it wouldn't have carried any connotations of hating rabbis at the time the Mishna was taught.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See Avot derabbi Nathan 11.2.

It's not rabbinical function as Says. The contents of this text focuses on how to behave. Rav is a quantitative expression. To be great, greater, grandiose. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>DonielF is correct in that the term implies \"mastery\" or a sense of haughtiness. Have a look at <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53085&st=&pgnum=14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Bartenura's explanation</a>. To summarize his main point, R. Bartenura refers to the beginning of the same mishna which says \"love work\". He says that one should not establish a sense of \"mastery\" or a leader type attitude that says \"I am a 'lord' or 'important' and doing work is beyond me.\" In other words, regardless of your title or position, you still should contribute to some type of work and not assign all work to others. Note that \"work\" doesn't necessarily mean \"employment\" or \"occupation\" necessarily. It means the performance of a task, in general.</p>\n\n\n",

Ibn Ezra to Shir HaShirim (no specific passuk noted) in which Yetzi'as Mitzraim is comparable to Kiddushin and the ultimate redemption is comparable to Nisu'in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Well, if we look at the following passuk, we see that after returning his hand to his bosom, it returned to look like flesh.  While this could be interpreted as the color of flesh, it may simply refer to the look of regular flesh (i.e. not scaled):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הָשֵׁ֤ב יָֽדְךָ֙ אֶל־חֵיקֶ֔ךָ וַיָּ֥שֶׁב יָד֖וֹ אֶל־חֵיק֑וֹ וַיּֽוֹצִאָהּ֙ מֵֽחֵיק֔וֹ וְהִנֵּה־שָׁ֖בָה כִּבְשָׂרֽוֹ׃</p>\n<p>And He said, “Put your hand back into your bosom.”—He put his hand back into his bosom; and when he took it out of his bosom, there it was again like the rest of his body.—</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The only support I can bring for this here is the translation of the Peshitta <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37702&st=&pgnum=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and perhaps the others who stay silent on the issue.</p>\n<p>The Peshitta translates our passuk as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והא אידה מגרבא איך תלגא<br />\nand his hand was as \"garva\" as snow</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does garva mean? Garav, as explained by <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Vayikra/21.20#e1n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Vayikra 21:20</a>, is a type of dried scaly boil.  If so, the simplest read of this Passuk would be to say that his hand was as scaly as snow.  (Note that we have no indication that Garav was white.)</p>\n<p>However, the Peshitta translates all tzara'as as garva, meaning the meaning of tzara'as is scales/scaly.</p>\n<p>Therefore, for all those who translate tzara'at here as leprosy or some other scaly disease (as opposed to Onkelos here, who translates tzara'at as white, as opposed to his regular translation of segira), they would also be understanding the passuk to be saying \"and his hand was scaled like snow\".</p>\n\n\n",

It wasn't for his belief in G-d. Bereishis 18:18-19:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יח. וְאַ֨בְרָהָ֔ם הָי֧וֹ יִֽהְיֶ֛ה לְג֥וֹי גָּד֖וֹל וְעָצ֑וּם וְנִ֨בְרְכוּ ב֔וֹ כֹּ֖ל גּוֹיֵ֥י הָאָֽרֶץ׃</p>\n<p>יט. כִּ֣י יְדַעְתִּ֗יו לְמַעַן֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְצַוֶּ֜ה אֶת־בָּנָ֤יו וְאֶת־בֵּיתוֹ֙ אַחֲרָ֔יו וְשָֽׁמְרוּ֙ דֶּ֣רֶךְ ה' לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת צְדָקָ֖ה וּמִשְׁפָּ֑ט לְמַ֗עַן הָבִ֤יא ה' עַל־אַבְרָהָ֔ם אֵ֥ת אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֖ר עָלָֽיו׃</p>\n<ol start=\"18\">\n<li>Avraham is to become a great and populous nation and all the nations of the earth are to be blessed through him him.</li>\n<li>For I have singled him out, that he may instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of Hashem by doing what is just and right, in order that the Hashem may bring about for Abraham what He has promised him.”</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Avraham was chosen because Hashem saw that he would teach his descendents justice and righteousness. Not \"just\" that he believed in G-d, as Sheim and Eiver did. Not \"just\" that he would make sure to pass this on to his children. But because Avraham realized the existence of a Creator implies things about how we treat other people. AND, that this is the essential message to pass down to following generations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I’ll need to find the exact chapter later but in Rabbi Avigdor Miller’s work, “Rejoice O’ Youth”, this question or some variation of it is asked. The sage in the work responds that it wasn’t really Avraham that was chosen, rather Shem. Although Shem was a Tzadik and ultimately learned, he didn’t promulgate the name of Hashem; rather, he kept to himself learning (and opened a yeshivah). The following  descendants were then tasked  with the promotion of Hashem‘s name but for some attribute or lack thereof they did not. Idolatry was eventually popularized and this further cascaded the degradation of the descendants. We are then led up to Terach and then Avraham. As I aforementioned, the descendants of Shem, each and every one of them could have been the one to be the progenitor of Bnei Yisroel. Avraham’s paradigm shifts and at some point in his life he concludes the prevailing doctrine of Monotheism. That which Avraham fulfilled was in actuality supposed to have been fulfilled by Shem. In addition, R Miller expounds the fact that Avraham was no ordinary individual but one with capacities of great breadth. Any field of endeavor wasn’t elusive for him. He apparently was learned in many different wisdoms and if he didn’t live up to his challenges he could have claimed rulership over some part of his land. His ancestors possessed similar dexterities too.</p>\n\n<p>I didn’t necessarily answer your question, as you could ask further “then why was Shem picked”, but that leaves out that the arbitrary selection of a random descendent from a particular lineage, as opposed to a selection of three brothers, and this selection was clearly not arbitrary, given their actions upon departure of the Tevah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Avraham Avinu was someone who came from a background of not initially knowing about G-d and then discovered Him himself. So it could be that he was chosen because it had to be someone who actively rejected idolatry - which is a variation on the concept of \"baal teshuva stands higher than a tzadik\".</p>\n\n\n",

According to the Greek version, Bilhah and Zilpah were daughters of Rotheus, who was a member of Avraham's household as well as the brother of Devorah, Rivka's nurse.

I don't have an answer for that, but the question is relevant for many things in Tanach, such as Sarah's lineage (her identification with Yiskah, daughter of Haran isn't pshat) or the name of David's mother (it's the gemara who tells us that her name was Nitzvat bat Adel).</p>\n\n\n",

So when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the edge of the water, 16 the waters flowing from above stood still, rising up in a single heap far off at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, while those flowing toward the sea of the Arabah [the Plain], the Salt Sea [the Dead Sea, NRSV], were wholly cut off. Then the people crossed over opposite Jericho. 17 While all Israel were crossing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, until the entire nation finished crossing over the Jordan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Josephus in <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em> Book V, Chapter 1.3 describes the same miraculous incident, but he makes no mention of the Salt Sea:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"3\">\n  <li>Now while Joshua, the commander, was in fear about their\n  passing over Jordan, for the river ran with a strong current, and\n  could not be passed over with bridges, for there never had been\n  bridges laid over it hitherto; and while he suspected, that if he\n  should attempt to make a bridge, that their enemies would not afford\n  him thee to perfect it, and for ferry-boats they had none, - God\n  promised so to dispose of the river, that they might pass over it, and\n  that by taking away the main part of its waters. So Joshua, after two\n  days, caused the army and the whole multitude to pass over in the\n  manner following: - The priests went first of all, having the ark with\n  them; then went the Levites bearing the tabernacle and the vessels\n  which belonged to the sacrifices; after which the entire multitude\n  followed, according to their tribes, having their children and their\n  wives in the midst of them, as being afraid for them, lest they should\n  be borne away by the stream. But as soon as the priests had entered\n  the river first, it appeared fordable, the depth of the water being\n  restrained and the sand appearing at the bottom, because the\n  current was neither so strong nor so swift as to carry it away by its\n  force; so they all passed over the river without fear, finding it to be in\n  the very same state as God had foretold he would put it in; but the\n  priests stood still in the midst of the river till the multitude should be\n  passed over, and should get to the shore in safety; and when all\n  were gone over, the priests came out also, and permitted the current\n  to run freely as it used to do before. Accordingly the river, as soon\n  as the Hebrews were come out of it, arose again presently, and carne\n  to its own proper magnitude as before. </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Bibliography</strong>: '<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/.../Dead-Sea.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Dead Sea (Yam Hamelach) - Israel - Chabad</a>'</p>\n\n\n",

Abaye responded: And according to your reasoning, what about this halakha that Rava said: One may not sit on Shabbat at the entrance of a private alleyway next to the post, which delineates its boundaries, lest an object roll away into the public domain and he come to bring it back? And yet we see that women put down their jugs and sit at the entrance of the alleyway, and we do not say anything to stop them. Rather, in these matters we rely on a different principle: Leave the Jewish people alone, and do not rebuke them. <strong>It is better that they be unwitting in their halakhic violations and that they not be intentional sinners</strong>, for if they are told about these prohibitions they may not listen anyway.\n  There were those who understood from this statement that this halakha applies only to rabbinic prohibitions but not to Torah prohibitions, with regard to which we must certainly reprimand transgressors. However, that is not so. <strong>There is no difference between rabbinic prohibitions and Torah prohibitions. In both cases one does not reprimand those who violate unwittingly and would not listen to the reprimand</strong>. For the requirement of adding to Yom Kippur by beginning the fast while it is still day is from the Torah, and we see women who eat and drink on the eve of Yom Kippur up until nightfall, and we do not say anything to them.

It thus means that as they went three days without Torah they immediately became exhausted. The prophets among them thereupon rose and enacted that they should publicly read the law on Sabbath, make a break on Sunday, read again on Monday, make a break again on Tuesday and Wednesday, read again on Thursday and then make a break on Friday so that they should not be kept for three days without Torah.’ (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we can see here, the comparison is very specific. It’s not saying that Torah is like water that we can live inside it. It’s saying that consumption of Torah is as necessary for survival as consumption of water.

Tzvi Hirsh Segal Spitz to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_David_Sinzheim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Dovid Sinzheim</a>, and is recorded as Question # 5 in Kuntres Sheva Chakiros. R. Spitz began by questioning the order of specific <em>mitzvot</em> but then moved on to say that he could not find any order at all. He then went on and on praising Rambam's masterful writing in all areas, such that it is nigh inconceivable that he could have written Sefer Hamitzvot with no organization.</p>\n\n<p>R. Sinzheim responded that it's basically impossible to answer this question, and in any event it's not only a question on Rambam but on basically all those who wrote books listing the <em>mitzvot</em>. He says that if the question would only be directed at Rambam, perhaps we could say that he had some stylistic reason based on the way lists of <em>mitzvot</em> were poeticized at the time, but since the problem extends well beyond Rambam's book alone, this doesn't really even help.</p>\n\n<p>R. Spitz then responded that he disagrees with R. Sinzheim's claim that this is a flaw in all the works that list <em>mitzvot</em>, and he proceeded to explain the organization of some of them. He then added that even if the same issue existed for other authors, Rambam is in a class of his own, a shining star that comes forth once in a thousand years, whose every drop of ink needs to be explained.</p>\n\n<p>R. Sinzheim then wrote back again, reiterating that there's no real way to know. He then adds that if R. Spitz thinks that the other authors actually had some form of organization then we can supply some semblance of order to Rambam's list as well. He begins with most of the <em>mitzvot</em> that relate to the early books of Mishneh Torah and then he lists all the <em>mitzvot</em> that relate to <em>kodshim</em> and <em>taharot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>He concludes by noting that in any event the difficulty with everyone's order is that they didn't follow the order in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

When that happens, sometimes they're replaced with extra letters to make the words easier to read. Here, because the vowel between the ח sound and the כ sound is pronounced as if it were the letter ו, someone decided to rewrite חָכְמָה as חוכמה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The accepted answer is correct, but it doesn't tell the full story.  חוכמה is a kind of written \"slang\" to leave little room for ambiguity when vowels aren't used.  (You'll almost never see חוכמה in Tanakh or even modern Hebrew dictionaries.)</p>\n\n<p>In other contexts, however, the vowel differences are significant.  For example, שמרה /shomra/ means \"(you) watch!\" (masculine singular imperative) and שומרה /shomera/ means \"(she) watches...\" (feminine singular participle).  Note that the vav is used as \"slang\" here too sometimes.  So in a modern Hebrew newspaper, you might see both שומרה for both שמרה and שומרה even though they're two different words.  And to make matters even more confusing... in Tanakh, you might see שמרה (albeit with holam) used in lieu of שומרה.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Estate of a convert whose only possible heir is just that: only a possible heir",
    "content": "# Estate of a convert whose only possible heir is just that: only a possible heir\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The last <em>mishna</em> in chapter 11 of <em>Y'vamos</em> says that if a woman didn't wait long between two marriages and therefore we don't know whether her son, say Samuel, is from the first husband, Aaron, or the second, Baruch, then Samuel doesn't inherit either of the possible fathers. <em>Rav</em> and <em>Tif'eres Yisrael</em> explain that this because the definite heirs can prevent him from doing so, claiming he's not an heir. What if there are no definite heirs: specifically, what if Aaron is a convert who has no relatives besides Samuel? Do we say that his estate is ownerless <a href=\"//www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.275.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">like that of a convert who died with no relatives</a>, or that Samuel inherits him? From the language of the <em>mishna</em>, \"he doesn't inherit them\", it sounds like the estate is ownerless; but from the reason given by the aforementioned commentaries, it sounds like this would be an exception. Does anyone deal with the question explicitly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If Aharon was a convert and his unique heir (safek heir), and Baruch is married to his mother, Aharon is a safek Convert who died without heirs, safek if he has a heir.</p>\n<p>If someone makes a tefisa on the estate of Aharon, he argues, there is no Yorshim, give a proof you are a heir, and Samuel says I am a heir.</p>\n<p>If heir is not Mechusar Guvayna, Samuel is prominent. See Gemara Yevamot 38b.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והתנן (משנה ב\"ב קנז' א): נפל הבית עליו ועל אביו, עליו ועל מורישיו, והיו עליו כתובת אשה וב\"ח, יורשי האב אומרים: הבן מת ראשון ואחר כך מת האב, וב\"ח אומר: האב מת ראשון ואח\"כ מת הבן - ב\"ש אומרים: יחלוקו, וב\"ה אומרים: נכסים בחזקתן והא הכא יורשי האב ודאי, וב\"ח ספק, וקאתי ספק ומוציא מידי ודאי קסברי ב\"ש: שטר העומד לגבות כגבוי דמי.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A Baal chov (following the opinion that Shtar is not considered as cached) is Mechusar Guvayna before he takes a part (by authorization of Bet Din) but heirs aren't. They have a part before they take something. Moreover, even according to the opinion that says brothers who share the inheritance are as buyers, here there is only one heir and this opinion is not relevant. But we can argue a lot with this.</p>\n<p>But I have a clear case that emphasize the superiority of Samuel toward a stranger. In the known case of שנים אוחזים בטלית</p>\n<p>The stranger says I found it from the Hefker, because it's Nichse Hagger. Samuel says Mima Nafshach, if I'm not the son of Aharon I found it, and if  I am the son of Aharon, it's mine before I come here. The Argument of Samuel is better because he has a tsad of Mare Kama, the stranger has'nt such a side. So we can say that Samuel has more than the stranger if not all.</p>\n<p>There is a similarity with a case in Yevamot 38a.</p>\n<p>Case 1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ספק ויבם שבאו לחלוק בנכסי סבא ספק אמר האי גברא בר מיתנא הוא ופלגא דידי הוא יבם אמר את בראי דידי את ולית לך ולא מידי הוי יבם ודאי וספק ספק ואין ספק מוציא מידי ודאי</p>\n<p>The Gemara brings another case, that of one of uncertain descent, who is either the son of the deceased or the son of the yavam, and the yavam who came to divide up the possessions of the grandfather, i.e., the father of the yavam and the deceased, and each one made a claim to the inheritance. The son of uncertain descent said: That man, referring to himself, is the son of the deceased, and therefore half of the possessions are mine because the inheritance should be split between the two sons, i.e., the deceased and the yavam, and since I am the sole heir of the deceased, I should receive his portion. The yavam said to him: You are my son, and therefore you have absolutely no rights to the possessions; rather, I should receive all the inheritance. One half is mine because I am the grandfather’s son, and the other half, which would have gone to my deceased brother, I should receive by virtue of the fact that I consummated the levirate marriage with his widow. The Gemara rules on this case: This is a case in which the yavam has a definite claim because he is the grandfather’s son, and the son of uncertain descent has only an uncertain claim, and the halakha is that one with an uncertain claim cannot extract property from one who has a definite claim to it. Therefore, the yavam receives all the inheritance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfot in BM 2a says, by comparison between a case in Mishna BM (2a in Bavli) to the up cited case. The case in is:</p>\n<p>Case 2.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If this one says: All of it is mine, and that one says: Half of it is mine, since they both agree that half of the cloak belongs to one of them, the conflict between them is only about the other half. Therefore, the one who says: All of it is mine, takes an oath that he does not have ownership of less than three parts, i.e., three-fourths, of it, and the one who says: Half of it is mine, takes an oath that he does not have ownership of less than one-quarter of it. This one takes three parts, and that one takes one-quarter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfot asks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וא\"ת</strong> ונימא דאין ספק מוציא מידי ודאי דהאומר כולה שלי יש לו בודאי חציה והאומר חציה שלי ספק אם יש לו בה כלום כדאמרינן בפרק החולץ (יבמות דף לח.) ספק ויבם שבאו לחלוק בנכסי סבא ספק אמר אנא בר מתנא אנא ואית לי פלגא ויבם אמר את ברא דידי ולית לך ולא מידי הוה ליה יבם ודאי וספק ספק ואין ספק מוציא מידי ודאי <strong>וי\"ל</strong> דהתם יבם שהוא בנו של סבא הוי ודאי יורשו ולא יוציא הספק מספק ממונו אבל הכא אין סברא מה שהוא ודאי בחציו שיועיל לו לחציו השני</p>\n<p>Why not to say: The man who argues that that the whole Talit is his is a Vaday, because he has surely one half, the man who argues that one half is his is Safek? And if this statement is true, the man who argues the whole talit is his could take the entire talit, as the Gemara in Yebamot case 1.</p>\n<p>We need to explain that the case 1 is different because  the Yabam will surely take one half of the estate. So the Safek son cannot take from him even one half through his status of Safek. But in case 2, his owness for one half has no influence on the second half.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding our question, the owness of the Samuel as heir has an influence on the whole estate, and his Taana that he takes it first is reinforced, so perhaps he will take all the Talit because he is more vaday than the stranger. This is an attempt of chiddush only.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Karpas strictly required?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/101406/\">under the impression</a> that Karpas isn't strictly required; as long as one has something to get the kids to ask, that should be enough. This is a position <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/56333/\">shared</a> by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/56696/9682\">other</a> Mi Yodeyans <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/81579/\">as well</a>. By this logic, then, if someone gets the kids to ask in a different way, he doesn't need to do Karpas.</p>\n\n<p>This position seems to be contradicted by two sets of halachos in the Shulchan Aruch. The first is in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.473.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 473:6</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נוטל ידיו לצורך טבול ראשון ולא יברך על הנטילה ויקח מהכרפס פחות מכזית ומטבילו בחומץ ומברך בורא פרי האדמה ואוכל ואינו מברך אחריו </p>\n  \n  <p>He washes his hands for the sake of the first dipping, and he does not make a blessing on the washing. He takes from the Karpas less than a kezayis, dips it in vinegar, and makes the blessing \"Who created the fruit of the ground,\" and eats and does not make a blessing after.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No mention of \"getting the kids to ask.\" Were it this halacha alone, I might not find this terribly noteworthy. But in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.473.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. §7</a> he <em>does</em> bring down the rationale of \"getting the kids to ask\" in the context of an <em>entirely different obligation</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מוזגין לו מיד כוס שני כדי שישאלו התינוקות למה שותים כוס שני קודם סעודה</p>\n  \n  <p>We pour for him the second cup immediately so that the children will ask, \"Why are we drinking a second cup before the meal?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the fact that the Mechaber says this rationale here, but not regarding Karpas, it seems to imply that Karpas, in fact, <em>is</em> obligatory <em>even if the kids ask from something else</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The second halacha is in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.475.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 475:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם אין לו ירקות לטיבול ראשון אלא מרור יברך עליו בטיבול ראשון בורא פרי האדמה ועל אכילת מרור ובטיבול השני יטבלנו בחרוסת ויאכלנו בלא ברכה</p>\n  \n  <p>If he doesn't have any vegetables for the first dipping besides Marror, he makes a blessing on it by the first dipping, \"Who created the fruit of the ground,\" and \"regarding eating the Marror.\" By the second dipping, he dips it in Charoses and eats it without a Bracha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If Karpas isn't obligatory, why doesn't the Mechaber (indeed, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.114b.12-115a.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Gemara</a>) say that one should do something else to get the kids asking, and save the Marror and its bracha for later (relying on the Hamotzi to cover the Marror, rather than the Ha'adamah, as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Pesachim.115a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos indeed suggest we do normally</a>)?</p>\n\n<p>My first reaction to defend my initial assumption is that, for whatever reason, Karpas was accepted as Minhag Yisrael, and is therefore binding as Halacha. However, the fact that we promote the Marror to before Maggid when there's no Karpas seems to imply otherwise: just because of a minhag, even a Minhag Yisrael, we're going to perform the mitzvah in a less-than-ideal fashion?<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>What, then, is the correct approach to these halachos? Is my initial assumption incorrect, and Karpas is indeed obligatory? Is my second assumption incorrect, and the fact that it's Minhag Yisrael is enough of a reason to override the ideal way of performing the Mitzvah? Is there a different solution?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>Yes, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Pesachim.115a.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos hold</a> that על מצות ומרורים יאכלוהו doesn't force you to eat the Marror immediately after the Matzah, but they clearly say that it's preferable.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>On the most basic level we can answer by stating simply that this is what the Sages instituted. The Mishnah in Pesachim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37941&st=&pgnum=491\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10:3</a>) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הביאו לפניו מטבל בחזרת עד שמגיע לפרפרת הפת</p>\n<p>MISHNAH. THEY THEN SET [IT] BEFORE HIM. HE DIPS THE LETTUCE BEFORE\nYET HE HAS REACHED THE AFTERCOURSE OF THE BREAD.

Modern butter plants at times utilize whey left over from cheese production as a substitute for costly butterfat when making butter, and Rav Moshe Feinstein went so far as to argue that butter incorporating whey from non-kosher cheese was still kosher.

If you do not want to hold by the above, you will have to talk to the Triangle-k people and see what their process is and if it satisfies you.</p>\n\n<p>One final note: given that dairy butter has no reason to contain chametz or kitniyot and is not commonly processed in plants where chametz is processed, why not just buy a standard \"year round\" kosher butter certified by a hechescher of your choosing?</p>\n\n\n",

Although I suppose many of us are also moved by this tragedy, I am afraid that Jews might not be allowed to contribute to the reconstruction of a place of <em>avodah zarah.</em></p>\n\n<p>Are there any sources discussing this issue?</p>\n\n<p>What would be a religiously adequate act of solidarity?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Feinstein</a> tangentially mentions donating money to building churches in a responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=917&st=&pgnum=294\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y.D. 1:102</a>) about donating to federations that distribute to Jewish institutions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה בפעדעריישאן שנותנין הגבאים גם למוסדות הכופרים כהא דשל הרעפארמער וקאנסערוואטיוון הרי אסור ליתן לשם כלל אף לא ממעות צדקה דנמצא דתומך במעותיו מוסדות המחנכים ילדים לכפור בעיקרי הדת שהם כמסיתים ומדיחים והוא כעוזר להם ומסתבר שגרוע עוד מנותן לעכו\"ם לעזרם לבנות בית תיפלה להם דהתם ליכא הסתה והדחה אלא איסור לפנ\"ע שאולי גורם בנתינתו שיעברו הנכרים על איסור ע\"ז ואיסור מהנה לע\"ז שאינו חמור כ\"כ דהא איכא דפליגי על זה בע\"ז דף י\"ג והכא הרי נמצא שעוזר לאיסור מסית ומדיח שהוא איסור היותר חמור</p>\n  \n  <p>And behold, the Federations where the stewards give even to heretical institutions, such as Reform and Conservative, one is forbidden to give them anything even not of charity money, because it comes out that his money would be supporting institutions that teach children to reject the fundamentals of the religion, for [the institutions] are like inciters and he is like a helper to them. And it is logical that it is even worse than giving gentiles to help them build their house of worship, for there there is no inciting; there is merely a prohibition of <em>lifnei iver</em> – since his donation might cause the gentiles to violate the prohibition of idolatry – and a prohibition of conferring benefit to idolatry which is not so serious seeing as there is a dispute about it in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=13&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah page 13</a>. Whereas here [in the case of the federations] it comes out that he would be helping the prohibition of inciting which is a most severe prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in a different responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=917&st=&pgnum=121\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y.D. 1:68</a>) he cites some sources that it would even be permissible to help <em>build</em> a church. Though he then cites other sources that prohibit building, he maintains that drawing the architectural plans for the church is technically permissible. Here is his conclusion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונמצא שלדינא יש להתיר אבל עכ\"פ מהראוי להתרחק מהכיעור אם אין בזה משום איבה דאם יש משום איבה הא משמע בתוס' דף י\"ט ד\"ה הגיע שאף לעשות תכשיטין לעכו\"ם שהוא אסור מדינא היה מותר שהרי הוצרכו לומר דליכא איבה וא\"כ כ\"ש כשיש איבה שאין להחמיר כשמותר מדינא וכן אף באין לחוש לאיבה אבל הוא עני שצריך לפרנסתו אינו צריך להחמיר מאחר שמדינא מותר וכ\"ש כשיש לו הפסד ממון כגון שעובד אצל אחרים ואם לא ירצה לעשות שרטוטים אלו יסלקוהו מעבודתו שאין לו להחמיר אבל כשליכא הפסד ממון וא\"צ לפרנסתו וליכא איבה יש לו להחמיר ולהתרחק מן הכיעור שלא להיות אף מסייע רחוק לזה</p>\n  \n  <p>And it comes out that according to the technical law we can permit it, but nevertheless it is proper to distance oneself from this unseemly thing if it will not cause enmity. For if it will cause enmity, it is implied in Tosafot [Avodah Zarah]  <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=19b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">page 19</a> s.v. <em>higia</em> that even to make adornments for idolatry, which is forbidden according to the technical law, would be permitted, for they needed to say that there was no enmity. And if so, certainly where there is enmity one should not be stringent if it is technically permitted. And so too even where there is no concern of enmity, but he is a pauper who needs to support himself, he does not need to be stringent since it is permitted according to the technical law. And certainly where it would cause him a monetary loss, such as if he works for others and if he does not want to draw these plans they will fire him, he should not be stringent. But where there is no monetary loss, and he doesn't need it to support himself, and there is no enmity, he should be stringent and distance himself from this unseemly thing, so that he shouldn't be even a far-removed help for this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Yitzchak Berkovits may be what you're looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Some key quotes (<strong>emphases</strong> are mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In cleaning for Passover, we are first and foremost fulfilling the mitzvah of <em>biur chametz</em> -- getting rid of chametz. <em>Biur chametz</em> is actually quite an easy mitzvah in terms of physical exertion. The Torah says: \"<em>tashbisu se'or mibateichem</em>\" -- make all your sour dough rest. The Torah commandment is that you can possess all the chametz you want, but in your mind it must be dust -- ownerless and valueless.</p>\n  \n  <p>Now obviously we are dealing with something subtle and vague. What goes on in your mind, no one knows except you and God. It's quite easy to think you have considered everything \"null and void,\" when in truth you can't wait for Passover to be over so you can partake of all those goodies!</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>So the Sages instituted a requirement to physically destroy chametz. This mitzvah is known as <em>bedikat chametz</em>. The Sages say it is not enough to emotionally write the chametz off as \"dust\"; you must actually search out any chametz you can find -- and physically destroy it.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The mitzvah of <em>bedikat chametz</em> is to be done on the night of the 14th of Nissan, the evening prior to the Seder...</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>However, our homes over the years have grown in size, and consequently are more complicated to clean. As a result, the ability to do bedikat chametz in a few hours on the night of the 14th is no longer feasible. Even if you stay up all night, chances are there are parts of your home you'll never get to. So we start our <em>bedikat chametz</em> early. So realize that when you start cleaning for Passover, you are doing <em>bedikat chametz</em>.</strong> This is important because there are specific rules for <em>bedikat chametz</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When we do <em>bedikat chametz</em>, what are we looking for?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>One crumb of edible chametz cannot remain in your house and you've got to destroy it.</strong> Also, anything that contains ethyl alcohol, since it can be distilled, is called \"edible chametz\" and must also be disposed of.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>We are also looking for something that is more than a <em>kezayit</em> -- regardless of whether you would consider it food or not. If it's less than a <em>kezayit</em> of non-edible chametz, you don't have to get rid of it because you consider it dirt. Also, if it's something even a dog wouldn't eat, then even more than a <em>kezayit</em> is not problematic.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>When you're cleaning for Passover, all the goodies in your freezer and cabinets -- bread, cakes, crackers -- all of that is chametz. You have to get rid of it one way or another. But aside from that, you probably won't find much edible chametz in your house. <em>Bedikat chametz</em>, therefore, is not so difficult. In the bedrooms, for example, you don't have to sit with a pin scraping the corners!</p>\n  \n  <p>Even further: Let's say you have gook stuck to your chametz dishes. If the stuff is non-edible, then you can forget about it -- as long as it does not total a <em>kezayit</em> of gook. But there is no need sit there and scrub the dishes with steel wool. Just make sure there is no edible stuff on them, and no <em>kezayit</em> of gook -- and put them away.</p>\n  \n  <p>One important point: If you feel like going beyond the limit and scraping the walls and ceiling, go right ahead. Of course it's not required, but the halacha is actually stated in Shulchan Aruch that no one is allowed to laugh at you. In the words of the rabbis, <em>Yisrael kedoshim heim</em> -- \"Jews are holy\" when they go beyond the letter of the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Torah reminds us numerous times that only pleasing G-d will ensure us all the good stuff and displeasing Him will do the opposite - enhance the physiological distress. Indeed we say it twice a day in Shemah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"וְהָיָה אִם שָׁמֹעַ תִּשְׁמְעוּ אֶל מִצְו‍ֹתַי ... וְנָתַתִּי מְטַר אַרְצְכֶם בְּעִתּוֹ יוֹרֶה וּמַלְקוֹשׁ וְאָסַפְתָּ דְגָנֶךָ וְתִירֹשְׁךָ וְיִצְהָרֶךָ. וְנָתַתִּי עֵשֶׂב בְּשָׂדְךָ לִבְהֶמְתֶּךָ וְאָכַלְתָּ וְשָׂבָעְתָּ.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>[Otherwise] \"וְחָרָה אַף ה' בָּכֶם וְעָצַר אֶת הַשָּׁמַיִם וְלֹא יִהְיֶה מָטָר וְהָאֲדָמָה לֹא תִתֵּן אֶת יְבוּלָהּ וַאֲבַדְתֶּם מְהֵרָה מֵעַל הָאָרֶץ הַטֹּבָה אֲשֶׁר ה' נֹתֵן לָכֶם.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Besides \"אם בחקותי תלכו...\" or \"אם תשמע לקול ה\"א...\" and more.</p></li>\n<li><p>The very premise of Judaism (and branching religion s) is that this world is destined for and the purpose of it is to finally get to a world where we don't lack anything - no food, no illness and we all have eternal fun.</p></li>\n<li><p>The situation has changed drastically in the last century. Most of the western world has already reached the agricultural independence - we don't rely on the skies to provide us with the rain for our crops. Only about 5% of the population work in the field instead of the original 95%. The other areas have also improved significantly - medicine, housing, personal security etc. And the progress continues.</p></li>\n<li><p>Once our society (inevitably) reaches a level of total assurance of this providence, covering abundant food, housing, perfect health (assuming Moshiach will not come till then), how and why would people keep their religion, because that's what Torah promises in exchange for keeping Mitzvos?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once this world looks just like the world to come why would people turn to G-d?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Note: This answer was posted to an earlier verion of the question.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Your question seems to be based on the premises that religion is supposed to be difficult and that the purpose of religion is for us to need God to fulfill our needs. However, it appears that Rambam disputes both of these premises. In <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 2:39 he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is clear that the Law is normal in this sense; for it contains \"Just statutes and judgments\" (Deut. iv. 8); but \"just\" is here identical with \"equibalanced.\" The statutes of the Law do not impose burdens or excesses as are implied in the service of a hermit or pilgrim, and the like; but, on the other hand, they are not so deficient as to lead to gluttony or lewdness, or to prevent, as the religious laws of the heathen nations do, the development of man's moral and intellectual faculties. We intend to discuss in this treatise the reasons of the commandments, and we shall then show, as far as necessary, the justice and wisdom of the Law, on account of which it is said: \"The Law of God is perfect, refreshing the heart\" (Ps. xix. 8). There are persons who believe that the Law commands much exertion and great pain, but due consideration will show them their error. Later on I will show how easy it is for the perfect to obey the Law. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp126.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the religion is not meant to be difficult at all. In the introduction to <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> he writes as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You are no doubt aware that the Almighty, desiring to lead us to perfection and to improve our state of society, has revealed to us laws which are to regulate our actions. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp008.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the goal is for humans to attain perfection. The Torah is simply a means to that end. It enables us, helps us, and directs us to reach perfection. If anything, being secure in our physiological needs makes it <em>easier</em> to focus on attaining this perfection.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam paskens the Tosefta, but adapts it to our ruling, which is not like R' Shimon.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't found anyone making any of these points in the standard commentaries on the side of the Rambam or Tosefta or in the back of the Frankel Rambam.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are the halakhic considerations when it comes to patronizing a business whose workers are on strike?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Crossing a <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">picket line</a> and patronizing a business whose workers are on strike, against the will of the workers, is a controversial action with some people saying it should never be done. I read <a href=\"https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/let_my_matzah_go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an article</a> about a Conservative rabbi in New England who made a halakhic ruling that purchasing food for Passover from a particular grocery store whose employees are currently on strike is forbidden. Despite the fact that his ruling used some arguments that I consider logically dubious (e.g. equating a wage-worker with a non-Jewish slave), I think the question itself is interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Do any halakhic sources, ancient or recent, discuss the permissiblity of crossing a picket line?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge, \"crossing a picket line\" means for an employee who had committed to a union and benefited from it to then violate that commitment and go work when his \"brethren\" are on strike. (Or if the musicians go on strike and the actors have agreed to support them, same idea.)</p>\n\n<p>You're asking a different question -- I've never made a commitment in my life to Bob's Supermarket; should I not shop there because many of Bob's employees are standing outside and protesting that Bob is unfair to his employees? Can we check whether that's called \"crossing a picket line\", please?</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow -- as an <strong>employee</strong>, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein wrote in 1951 that it is <strong>proper and a mitzvah</strong> to abide by one's agreement to the union. (Not quite \"obligatory\", but \"a very good thing.\") The Gemara Bava Metzia 49a talks about the strong moral obligation if you said \"I will buy/sell\" without signing anything; this is slightly less as the picket-line agreement is not a tangible item that is bought or sold. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=918&st=&pgnum=108\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe Choshen Mishpat v1, #58</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lVGf6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lVGf6.png\" alt=\"text of the above citation\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Concerning</strong> the matter  of a workers' <em>agudah</em>, known as a union ... that they must assist one another in strikes and the like, to advance their causes; I see not the slightest prohibition [in joining one] ... they are absolutely allowed to agree on matters -- even those not in the framework of acquisitions -- and it is a mitzvah to follow them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Depending on which opinion we follow in Bava Metzia 49a, this is either because just like your weights and measures should be exact, so should your word; or because we say it's meritorious to even follow what you <em>thought</em> to give someone; certainly what you actually told them you'd do. </p>\n\n<p>As a <strong>consumer</strong>, there have been cases effectively of \"consumer picketing\", but that's to protect the consumers. I'm not aware of \"don't shop at Bob's because he doesn't treat his people well.\" (There have been cases where a Jewish shopkeeper asks the rabbis to intervene with the free market to protect his business vs. the non-Jewish one, and the rabbis often shy away from this.) The Gemara Pesachim tells about a town where people's custom was to throw out all their <em>chametz</em> clay pots before Pesach; the new rabbi told the pot sellers that if their prices stayed fair he would leave this alone, but if they raised their prices around Pesach time, he would publicly rule that there is no need to throw out your pots and buy new ones.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly there was a case in the 1700s of fishmongers who wanted to dramatically raise the price of fish on Fridays, knowing the Jews would want to buy fish for Shabbos; it was ... the First Lubavitcher Rebbe, if I'm not mistaken ... who was prepared to ban everyone from buying fish (at any price) until the price came down. </p>\n\n<p>There were also communal enactments in the Middle Ages that wedding extravaganzas not be bigger than a certain size, even if <em>you</em> personally could afford it; i.e. a top-down agreement on limiting consumption. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose a community's leadership could get together and declare a ban on shopping at Joe's to protect Joe's workers ... but I've never heard of anything quite like that. </p>\n\n\n",

This too is uncommon, and there is neither concern nor a decree.</p>\n\n<p>הניחא למ\"ד כשר ולא תעשה אלא למ\"ד כשר ותעשה מאי איכא למימר</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara responds: This works out well according to the one who said in this case as well: It is valid; however, it shall not be done. But according to the one who said: It is valid and it may be done, i.e., it is permitted ab initio, what is there to say?</p>\n\n<p>אלא רבי יוסי תרתי אמר ושמואל סבר לה כוותיה בחדא ופליג עליה בחדא</p>\n\n<p>Rather, this is the explanation. Rabbi Yosei stated two halakhot: The first is that verbal directives cannot be delegated to an agent. The second is that even when the husband said: Tell another to write the document, this agency cannot be transferred to another person. And Shmuel holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei in one case, i.e., that verbal directives cannot be delegated to an agent, and he disagrees with him in one case, as Shmuel holds that if the husband explicitly said: Tell another to write the document, this agency can be transferred.</p>\n\n<p>גופא אמר שמואל אמר רבי הלכה כרבי יוסי דאמר מילי לא מימסרן לשליח אמר לפניו ר\"ש ברבי מאחר שר\"מ וחנינא איש אונו חולקין על רבי יוסי מה ראה רבי לומר הלכה כר' יוסי</p>\n\n<p>§ With regard to the previously cited matter itself, Shmuel says that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: The halakha is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who says: Verbal directives cannot be delegated to an agent. Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, said before his father: Since Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Ḥanina of Ono, who hold that verbal directives can be delegated to an agent, disagree with Rabbi Yosei, what led Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi to say that the halakha is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei?</p>\n\n<p>אמר לו שתוק בני שתוק לא ראית את ר' יוסי אילמלי ראיתו נמוקו עמו</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to his son: Be silent, my son; be silent.

Is it that n one attending these hotels are observing timeframe 1, or is Hol Hamo'ed an \"exception\" for them, too?</p>\n\n<p>Then, Yom Ha'atzma'ut also seems to be an exception as many people observing both timespans seem to be listening to music.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'm trying to gain some clarity on the \"no music\" rule. It seems that the only commonality for both groups not to hear music is 1 Iyar - 18 Iyar )Lag Ba'omer). Except from Yom Ha'atzma'ut.</p>\n\n<p>It also seems, based on the above, that those observing timespan 1 are getting more \"exemptions\" (all of Hol Hamo'ed) than those in timespan 2. Regardless, it doesn't seem that anyone is observing the no music ban for a full 33 days.</p>\n\n<p>Are all these days considered \"exemptions\", or have people become lax on the no music rule, or what?</p>\n\n\n",

If you want to blend in, that is.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My suggestion is to dress consistently which means to not mix different styles of different groups. You can learn what this means by speaking to your Rabbi but here are some examples.</p>\n\n<p>Each group has its own style for every cloth, for example, a black hat doesn't fit shorts or colored shirt, and a baseball cap doesn't fit a long black coat, and a Sthreiml doesn't fit a short coat. </p>\n\n<p>So observe closely and choose one authentic style for everything, including socks and shoes and tie and shirt and coat AND the hat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There isn't any hat which is a specifically a chabad hat and no style of hat which will result in insulting anyone. There are Lubavitchers that wear other styles including ones that wear streimls. That being said many wear a fedora that is similar to the one that the Rebbe wore and you can google pictures of this. You can also visit a frum hat store and ask them to advise you on style.</p>\n\n<p>Another important point here is that clothing is an external expression and not the defining thing which makes someone a chabad chossid. What type of hat you should wear and if you should wear a hat is something I strongly believe you should speak to a mashpia (spiritual mentor) about. Hope this helps and best of success. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the logic behind the Maharil's explanation of why we don't say שעשה ניסים on Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My Haggadah cites the Maharil in Minhagim, Hilchos Hahagadah as having asked why we don't say שעשה ניסים on Pesach. He rejects the explanation brought by others that it's because we say לפיכך חייבים  להודות...למי שעשה ניסים לאבותינו, \"Therefore we are obligated to thank...the One Who performed miracles for our forefathers,\" toward the end of Maggid, as that's not a blessing. Similarly, he rejects those who explain that it's because we say אשר גאלנו at the end of Maggid, since it makes no direct reference to the miracle. Rather, he explains, the Bracha was only instituted on Rabbinic mitzvos, i.e. Purim and Chanukah, but not Biblical ones, i.e. Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>What's the logic behind this opinion? Why should whether a mitzvah is Biblical or Rabbinic have any bearing on whether the blessing thanking Hashem for a miracle be said?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Others were somewhat troubled by this explanation as well. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Michel_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yechiel Michel Epstein</a> explains it as follows:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9102&st=&pgnum=100&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan O.C. 473:3</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובשם מהרי\"ל ראיתי טעם מפני שהיא מצוה הכתובה בתורה ואין מברכין שעשה נסים אלא אמצוה דרבנן כגון חנוכה ופורים [פרישה] ולכאורה אין הדברים מובנים והאמת דה\"פ דהנה כל הברכות תקנו רבנן ולא שייך ברכה אלא לברך להקב\"ה אשר צוונו במצוה זו כמו לאכול מצה לישב בסוכה לתקוע בשופר אבל לא לעשות מעצם המצוה ברכה וכיון דמן התורה אנו מצווים לספר הנסים בלילה זה והוי מצות עשה א\"כ איך נברך שעשה נסים והרי זהו עצם המצוה והוי כהגדה אחר הגדה וברכת אשר גאלנו העיקר על אכילת מצה ומרור כמו שאומרים והגיענו הלילה הזה לאכול בו מצה ומרור אבל שעשה נסים זהו עיקר מצות סיפור יציאת מצרים ורק אמצוה דרבנן הרשות בידם ולא בדאורייתא</p>\n<p>And in the name of the Maharil I saw a reason – because it is a <em>mitzvah</em> that is written in the Torah, and we son't make the blessing of \"who performed miracles\" except on a rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em> like Chanukah and Purim (Perishah). And these words seem not understandable. But the truth is that this is the explanation: The Sages instituted all the blessings, and a blessing is only applicable to bless God that he commanded us in this <em>mitzvah</em>, such as to eat <em>matzah</em>, to sit in a <em>succah</em>, to blow a <em>shofar</em>, but not to make a blessing out of the essence of the <em>mitzvah</em>. So since we are commanded from the Torah to discuss the miracles on this night, and it is a positive commandment, how could we then bless \"who performed miracles\" considering that that is the essence of the <em>mitzvah</em> and it would be like a discussion after a discussion. And the blessing of \"who redeemed us\" is primarily on the eating of the <em>matzah</em> and <em>maror</em>, as we say that we have reached this night to eat <em>matzah</em> and <em>maror</em>. But \"who performed miracles\" is the primary aspect of the <em>mitzvah</em> of discussing the Exodus from Egypt. And they only have permission [to set this blessing] on a rabbinic <em>mitzvah</em>, not on a biblical <em>mitzvah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Kasher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Menachem Mendel Kasher</a> explains it as follows:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51461&st=&pgnum=130\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Sheleimah Vol. XV Miluim # 1</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה טעמו של המהר\"ל שכ' ומצות ופסח דאורייתא גם בלא הנס צ\"ב ונ\"ל כוונתו שחג הפסח ואכילת מצה הם מצות דאורייתא שעיקרם זכר הנס של יציאת מצרים כמ\"ש בתורה משום זה לא תקנו חכמים ברכה מיוחדת על הנס מכיון שהתורה עצמה כבר עשתה מצוות זכר לנס ומ\"ש בלא הנס כלומר בלי ברכת שעשה נסים ועפ\"ד</p>\n<p>And behold, the reason of the Maharil who writes that <em>matzah</em> and <em>pesach</em> are biblical [<em>mitzvot</em>] even without the miracle, requires explanation. And it seems to me that his intent is that the holiday of Passover and the eating of <em>matzah</em> are biblical commandments whose primary aspect is a remembrance of the miracle of the Exodus from Egypt, as is stated in the Torah. Because of this the Sages did not institute a special blessing on the miracle, since the Torah itself already made <em>mitzvot</em> in remembrance of the miracle. And that which he says \"without the miracle\" means without the blessing of \"who performed miracles\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The 210 years are that they lived in Egypt a count of 210.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We know from Genesis 25:26 that Isaac was 60 when Jacob was born:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them.

Thus, the Israelites were apparently in Egypt for 240 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Whence cometh the number 210?</strong></p>\n<p>(The way that other commentators reach the number 210 is by assuming that the 430 years started 30 years before Isaac was born. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> who also states in one explanation that the 430 years began at Isaac's birth does indeed say that the amount of time in Egypt was 240 years.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In the Mossad Harav Kook edition of R. Bechaye's commentary, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ber_Chavel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Charles Chavel</a> raises this issue in a footnote. He notes that all the commentators and Midrashim only have 400 years  from Isaac's birth to the Exodus (including R. Bechaye himself elsewhere), and that this calculation is demonstrably correct based on the numbers we know. He further notes that he could not find this view (that the 430 years were from Isaac's birth) anywhere, though he did find a couple of others who raised this question. Lastly he notes that this is even more perplexing because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Saadia Gaon</a> has the 430 years as beginning from when Abraham left Ur Kasdim, and R. Chananel usually follows R. Saadia Gaon. </p>\n\n<p>Here are images of the footnote:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/faNdo.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/faNdo.jpg\" alt=\"Image of page containing footnote\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2ymp5.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2ymp5.jpg\" alt=\"Image of page containing footnote\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the Mossad Harav Kook edition of Peirushei Rabbeinu Chananel Al Hatorah, R. Chavel again raises this issue in a footnote, noting that he was unable to resolve it in his note to R. Bechaye's commentary. However, he says that he has now found the answer. He saw that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abarbanel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> quotes <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14386&st=&pgnum=106\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a similar explanation</a> about there being three end times, but Abarbanel lists the three times as 430 years from Abraham's covenant, 400 years from Isaac's birth, and 210 years actually spent in Egypt. R. Chavel thus argues that the text in R. Bechaye's commentary is corrupted, and it mixed up the 400 and the 430 years. In truth it should say that the <strong>400</strong> years began from Isaac's birth, just like Abarbanel says. </p>\n\n<p>R. Chavel further adds that the proof that this is correct is that otherwise R. Bechaye/R. Chananel listed the three times out of order. In our current texts it mentions the 400 years, then the 430 years, and then the 210 years. But 430 should really come before 400. Therefore it must be that the 430 <em>did</em> come before the 400, and in our versions it is simply a mistake. </p>\n\n<p>Here is an image of this footnote as well:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BzviV.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BzviV.jpg\" alt=\"Image of page containing footnote\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Like is seen in the link you provided to Rabbeinu Bechaye to Shemot 12:40, there are three different lengths of duration for the Egyptian exile. How each of them plays out is dependent upon the merit of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, the actual translation of Rabbeinu Bechaye's opening comments in your link are the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We find in regard to the Egyptian redemption three appointed times (<em>Keitzim</em>). And they are 400 years, 430 years, 210 years.</p>\n  \n  <p>400 years are counted from the beginning of the seed of Avraham\n  (<em>meaning Yitzchok</em>) quarreling with their poverty and vacillation and\n  the persecution of his brother (<em>meaning Yishmael</em>) like it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.1-12?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 21:1-12</a>. And\n  they will cause them to serve and afflict them 400 years. And in\n  regard to this (<em>phrase</em>) is included quarreling and subjugation.</p>\n  \n  <p>430 years are counted from Yitzchok, from <em>his concern that he be born</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s possible to understand this as from the moment that G-d concerned Himself with Avram's worry about not having any biological heir from his wife, Sarai and G-d told of Yitzchok's birth to Avram in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.1-6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 15:1-6</a>, because G-d’s word (<em>His thought</em>) is considered generally as if it is actually done (<em>It is equated with action.</em>). This in in keeping with the Alter Rebbe's explanation of Rambam's approach found in Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 2:10, as found in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7881/jewish/Chapter-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 2 of the Tanya</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The actual Hebrew משעה שנולד can be translated as 'from when He was concerned that he be born'. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A9%D6%B0%D7%81%D7%A2%D6%B5%D7%99?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שעה here is a verb in past tense from the root שעה, שעי second definition, as appears in Jastrow</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pUhbT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pUhbT.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>210 years are that they dwelt in Egypt 210 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Redemption from Egypt actually took place in 2448.</p>\n\n<p>Following Ramban's accounting to Shemot 12:40, Avram was born in 1948 from the creation. He was 70 years old at the Covenant between the Halves which took place in Israel. That would have occurred in 2018. <strong>The year 2018 is the 430 years that was foretold.</strong></p>\n\n<p>He descended to Mitzrayim and returned to the land of Israel at the age of 75 in the year 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Yishmael was born in 2034. When he was 13 years old, he was circumcised together with Avraham and his household in the year 2047.</p>\n\n<p>One year later, Yitzchok was born, in 2048, and was the first individual to fulfill the mitzvah of Milah at 8 days old. <strong>The year 2048 is the 400 year time of the Egyptian exile.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yaacov was born to Yitzchok when Yitzchok was 60 years old. That was in the year  2108.</p>\n\n<p>Yaacov was 130 years old when he entered Mitzrayim to meet his son, Yosef. That was the year 2238. <strong>From the year of the redemption from Egypt in 2448, to the time that Yaacov enter Egypt was 210 years.</strong> And this is the fulfillment of the prophetic statement from Yaacov to his sons mentioned in Bereshit 42:2 and as commented upon by Rashi. It also corresponds to 190 years from the time of the birth of Yitzchok (2238-2048 = 190) and hints to the concept of the redemption occurring then, without any hardship, if the Jewish people merit it (190 is קץ).</p>\n\n<p>17 years later was when Yaacov passed away in the year 2255. It was from this time forward that the affliction aspect of the Egyptian exile started to become severe. And this period culminated with the passing of Yosef and his brothers like is recorded in Sefer Yashar. With the passing of each of the sons of Yaacov, it became more harsh.</p>\n\n<p>Moshe was 80 years old in the year 2448, when the Redemption from Egypt took place. That places the year of his birth in 2368 which was 113 years after Yaacov had passed away.</p>\n\n<p>Miriam , Moshe's oldest sister, was 126 years old when she passed away in the year 2487, the same year that her younger brother Aharon did. Miriam was born in 2361. Her brother, Aharon, passed away at the age of 123 and was born in 2364.</p>\n\n<p>Kehat, Moshe's Grandfather, lived for 133 years and was also one of the 70 souls counted with Yaacov, when Yaacov entered Egypt in 2238. If you deduct the 113 years from the birth of Moshe to the passing of Yaacov, that leaves Kehat as a 20 year old when Yaacov dies and 3 years old when he first entered Egypt. But all of this is contingent that Kehat died shortly after Moshe's birth. There is a 3 year margin of error from the birth of Moshe to when Kehat passed away.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bechaye, at the end of the citation you bring says that what Rabbeinu Chananel is agreeing with is the concept that there are three time frames connected with the Redemption from Egypt and that how each one plays out is related to the merit of the Jewish people. He also explains that this relates to the final redemption mentioned by Daniel the Prophet.</p>\n\n\n",

He (Rabbi Yanai) said him go out to read your reading. The Halacha is not ruled as Rabbi Yehuda. A reciter did recite before Rav Nachman The Halacha is not ruled as Rabbi Yehuda. He (RN) said him so how did it be ruled? it's obvious that Halacha is ruled following the majority against Rabbi Yehuda. So, he said cancel this Berayta. They taught you Halacha is ruled as Rabbi Yehuda and it was not understandable for you, so, not consciently, you changed the words and inverted the rule they taught you. But indeed halachically speaking you are right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that in the first part of this Gemara it seems that Halacha the Berayta was written. But in the second case of the Gemara the story shows that for the Tana of Rav Nachman it was orally transmitted.</p>\n<p>Can we infer from this Gemara that beraytot were written in a book?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The way that you translated it might seem to indicate that R. Chanina was reading the Beraita. However, we can challenge your translation. You appear to have rendered the word קרא as a verb meaning that R. Chanina was reading. However, we know from elsewhere in the Talmud that the word קרא is actually part of R. Chanina's name/title. In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=27b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Taanit 27b</a> we find:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והאמר רבי חנינא קרא צער גדול היה לי אצל רבי חנינא הגדול ולא התיר לי לפסוק אלא לתינוקות של בית רבן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In that instance it seems pretty clear that קרא is not a verb, but is instead a name or an appellation for R. Chanina. Indeed, Rashi tells us as much in his commentary there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהיה בעל מקרא ויודעה בגירסא ובקי בטעמיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So getting back to the passage in Yevamot, the opening phrase would just mean that R. Chanina Kara was sitting in front of R. Yannai and saying that the halacha follows R. Yehuda. Indeed, this is how <a href=\"https://halakhah.com/yebamoth/yebamoth_40.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino</a> translates it (with the appellation קרא translated as well):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Bible teacher, R. Hanina, once sat before R. Jannai, and as he sat there he stated: The <em>halachah</em> is in agreement with R. Judah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also how it is translated in the link to Sefaria in your post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Rabbi Ḥanina Kara</strong>, the Bible expert, <strong>was sitting before Rabbi Yannai, and he was sitting and saying: The <em>halakha</em> is in accordance with</strong> the opinion of <strong>Rabbi Yehuda.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for R. Yannai's response, which you translated as \"go out to read your reading\", which could theoretically have referred to a Beraita if that's what he was reading, the two aforementioned translations both interpret that as referring to R. Chanina's reading of verses. Soncino has it as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The other called out to him: Go out, read Biblical verses outside; the <em>halachah</em> is not in agreement with R. Judah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sefaria has it as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yannai <strong>said to him:</strong> Leave the study hall <strong>and recite your verses outside,</strong> as you are incorrect in your ruling; in fact, the <strong><em>halakha</em> is not in accordance with</strong> the opinion of <strong>Rabbi Yehuda.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These translations make sense, because since we rendered קרא as a noun, there is no indication that R. Chanina was reading anything about R. Yehuda. All we know is that he stated that the halacha follows R. Yehuda. In fact, in the <a href=\"https://halakhah.com/kethuboth/kethuboth_56.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a> to a parallel passage in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=56&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ketubot 56a</a>, the footnote gives an explanation for why R. Yannai would specifically send R. Chanina outside: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[I.e., Go teach the Bible to children instead of venturing into the realms of the <em>halachah</em>. Bible instructions were given in a place 'outside' the academy].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, R. Yannai was specifically telling him to read Scripture outside, and it had nothing to do with reading anything about R. Yehuda.</p>\n\n<p>If this is the case then there would be no indication from this passage that R. Chanina was reading a Beraita.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47913&st=&pgnum=695\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kovets Shitot Kamae</a> in name of Chidushe Shitot MiKitve Yad:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משום דהוה ליה קראה ר\"ל דעל פסוק אמר ליה הכי</p>\n<p>Because he (rabbi Chanina) was a Biblist, i.e. he said it following his interpretation of a verse {he decided to pasken through his understanding of the verse}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If you do not drive out the inhabitants of the Land, then those whom you allow to remain will be as spikes in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will harass you in the land in which you settle. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet in other places the Torah says to kill the inhabitants outright:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.1-4?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 7:1-4</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must doom them to destruction: Grant them no terms and give them no quarter.

Maimonides explains that this was Joshua's first move when he entered Canaan. Three letters were sent, allowing them to flee, make peace, or wage war. A lot chose war, especially in the case of the Gibeonites.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides says that the Israelites were not required to kill any Canaanite offering peace. </p>\n\n\n",

In my previous question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/94911/is-giving-money-to-relatives-considered-a-tzedakah\">Is giving money to parents considered a tzedaka?</a>, I received answers that it's okay to give tzedakah money to parents if they are poor. </p>\n\n<p>However, I recently found a contradicting opinion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.32a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 32a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemara asks: If so, consider that which is taught with regard to this baraita. Rabbi Yehuda says: May a curse come upon one who feeds his father the poor man’s tithe. And if this halakha, that one may feed his father the poor man’s tithe, was said with regard to a surplus, what difference is there? Since the son has fulfilled his obligation and simply adds something so that his father will have more, why is this person cursed? <strong>The Gemara answers: Even so, it is a disrespectful matter for one to feed his father with money that has been designated as charity for the poor</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, according to this opinion, if one is capable of supporting his parents financially, one should not use tzedakah money for this. This statement raises a number of questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is this true regarding other relatives as well?</li>\n<li>How authoritative/binding is this opinion? Are there any authoritative comments on this opinion?</li>\n<li><strong>Does this opinion hold true in cases when one wants to give tzedakah money to his other relatives together with parents?</strong> Let's say one's parents and his other siblings are poor and live together in an old appartment which needs renovation. The son wants to donate his tzedakah money for the renovation. Should he use tzedakah money to help his poor family or must he use his other money and give tzedakah for other purposes (provided he is financially able to do so)? Remember, his poor parents are living in that appartment as well (with his other relatives) so some may argue that he is donating his tzedakah money to parents (indirectly though). </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When to do the dishes- Yom Tov starting at Motzei Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Passover brings an interesting quandry this year- we go through a great many Kosher for Passover dishes at the Lail Pesach seder on Friday night, and then have a couple of meals on Saturday.\n Given that A) it is forbidden to prepare for a weekday on Shabbat, B) it is forbidden to prepare for the second day of Yom Tov on the first day of Yom Tov, C) handwashing dishes is pretty universally prohibited on Shabbat and Yom Tov except for immediate use and D)the second seder should begin at Sundown on Saturday night and requires a clean, set table- assuming one doesn't have unlimited quantities of Kosher for Passover dishes- \nwhen would one be halachically permitted to was the dishes so as to prepare for the second seder?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You're definitely not the only one in this \"quandary\". First of all, I believe that there is some leniency that allows washing dirty dishes if the dirt is either \"offensive\" or one is troubled by seeing the dirty dishes lying around. I have to research this, but, from what I recall the decisive factors are not as simple as you would think, since, there is always that element of <em>hachanah</em> (preparation) for the next day.</p>\n\n<p>So, I'll address the more \"practical\":</p>\n\n<p>Most people that I know that use \"real\" plates deal with this. Preparations begin only once the 2nd day of Yom Tov begins. This is not as terrible as it seems, actually. In most cases, the men are still in shul, because many shuls aren't starting Ma'ariv until exactly when Yom Tov II starts. Even the places that do start a bit early - by the time you say Halle and get <em>sefirah</em> in at the right time and walk home, it's about 30 minutes after the 2nd day has begun. That should allow plenty of time to rinse dishes and set the table. If you have a \"large staff\" of helpers at home (large family plus some guests), it can be done fairly easily.</p>\n\n<p>If you're really concerned, though - Either have two sets of plates around or better, as I have done numerous years, paper and plastic really help out for this situation and there's nothing to wash afterwards. Trust me from personal experience. I spent numerous Pesach Seders staying up until 2 - 3 AM washing dishes and putting away food. (Incidentally, at night, it's not a problem to wash the dishes that I will be using for lunch the next day.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Mo'adim Lesimcha</em> to all...</p>\n\n<p>I discovered <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2014/02/11/can-you-wash-dishes-on-shabbat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> which mentions a leniency. So, while the seder(im) are over, these rules would apply to any Shabbat or Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>If the dishes are required for use on Shabbos, it is permitted to wash them.</p>\n\n<p>According to some authorities it is permitted to wash dishes even for the purpose of having the house and kitchen clean and tidy.</p>\n\n<p>Dishes must not be washed with sponges that involve a concern of squeezing out water. Synthetic (non-absorbent) material can be used, or just use your hands. It is permitted to use detergent.</p>\n\n<p>Best wishes.</p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (OC 323:6) and the Mishnah Berurah (323:26) write that it is prohibited to wash dishes if they are not required for used on Shabbos. However, if the household norm is for the sink to always be clear of dishes, and the sink being full of dishes is seen as clashing with the honor of Shabbos (or Yom Tov), then it is permitted to wash the dishes.</p>\n\n<p>The source for this leniency is Rashi (Shabbos117b), who writes that the prohibition of washing dishes is on account of preparation for weekdays. This implies that if the washing is not for preparation for weekdays, the act would be permitted. [There is certain debate about the position of Rambam in this matter.] The Maharshag, Orach Chaim, Vol. I, no. 61, writes explicitly that this is the case, and permits washing dishes for the sake of hygiene and cleanliness; Tzitz Eliezer, Vol. 14, no. 37 concurs with the ruling.</p>\n\n\n",

Why the eighth hour is more luminous than the fifth, I don't know, perhaps generally there are more clouds in morning. The interesting issue is that according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir following the version of our Mishnayot, it's inverted, morning is more enlighted than afternoon.

Fear - do not stand in his place, nor sit in his place, nor contradict his words, nor support hi[s position]. Honor - feeding, giving to drink, dressing, covering, bringing in, taking out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's say a parent tells his child, I dunno, to take the garbage out. Every Rabbi I've heard on the topic says that the child is obligated to do so, but why? It doesn't seem to fall under any of the examples listed here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I heard a lecture by Rabbi Yisroel Reisman (of Brooklyn; one of his weekly-in-the-winter <em>motzae Shabas</em> lectures on <em>N'viim</em>) which cited various opinions and concluded, as best as I can recall, that at least some major <em>pos'kim</em> (halachic decisors) rule practically as follows: The command to revere/respect one's parents (<em>mora</em>) includes not contradicting them in such a way as they will find out about it. Thus, if your mother tells you that it's cold outside and that you must wear a sweater, then you must wear a sweater as long as you are within sight. However, once you are out of sight, and if she won't find out you didn't, there is no requirement to wear the sweater. (Wearing overclothes was actually the example used in the lecture.) The other command, to honor one's parents (<em>kibud</em>), means to do things for them, like feed them. This is whether they will know you did it or not, but wearing a sweater, or any other action that doesn't benefit them, is not included.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me, then, that, according that view, if your mother asks you to take out the garbage and will know whether you did so, it's in both categories. But consult your own rabbi for practical advice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Depends on what you are doing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Torah study is greater than the mitzvah of honoring parents. [Megillah 16b]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But in general, you don't have to obey your parents:</p>\n\n<p>-If someone wants to pray in a synagogue where [the congregation] prays with more devotion, and his mother protests, he does not have to listen to his mother. [19th-century Russian rabbi Eisenstadt, Pitchei Teshuva, Yoreh Deah 240:22]</p>\n\n<p>-If the father protests against the son marrying a specific woman that he wishes [to marry], the son does not have to listen to his father. [Rema on Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 240:25]  (But if she is not Jewish, or not moral, or not religious, he must listen to his father. [Chaim Hezekiah Medini, 19th-century Jerusalem rabbi, Sdei Chemed, Ma’arechet Caf 147])</p>\n\n<p>-Many rabbis say that the mitzvah to dwell in Israel overrides the obligation to honor parents. Some disagree. [Contemporary rabbi Moshe Lieber, The Fifth Commandment, p 131]</p>\n\n<p>-If a parent asks a son to shave his beard, he need not listen. If a parent tells a child not to speak to a certain person, the child need not obey. [Shulhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 240:16; Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Braun, She'arim Metzuyyanim Bahalakhah 143]</p>\n\n<p>However, the Talmud says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Rabbi Aha ben Yaakov raised his daughter's son, Rabbi Yaakov. When he grew up, [the grandfather] said to him: “Give me some water to drink”. He replied: “I am not your son.” [Sotah 49a]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This implies that, had he been the son, he would have had to obey.</p>\n\n<p>My conclusion from all this: Generally, you must obey your parents when it's a matter that concerns primarily your parents and does not violate commandments, but not when it's a matter that concerns primarily you.  There are exceptions.  But yes, you must take out the garbage if it's THEIR garbage and you are not studying Torah at that moment.  Otherwise you don't.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>In \"Honouring Parents in Halacha\" by Rabbi Tzureil Ta'aseh (Feldheim) it says in the chapter of \"The Laws of Honoring One's Father and Mother\", p.44, 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Kibbud av va'em</em> in deed means feeding one's parents (when necessary), giving them to drink, covering or dressing them, escorting\nthem when they go into the house or when they go out if they need\nhelp, and generally serving them as a personal servant serves his\nmaster.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All these aspects of honoring one's parents are obligatory <strong>even if\nthey did not ask him to do them</strong>. Some say that if his parents ask him\nto done of the things mentioned above (such as feed them), and he does\nnot do what they say, <strong>in addition to a failure in his obligation to\nhonor them, he has also failed in his obligation to be in awe of them</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Page 47 also has a section on When Parents Do Not Benefit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"14\">\n<li>If one's parents want him to do or not to do something that brings no direct benefit to the parents, some say one need not heed what they\nsay - for example, if they are afraid he will catch [a] cold and they\nwant him to dress warmly. <strong>Others say that even in such a case he must\nheed them</strong>. The latter opinion is shared by most authorities in recent\ngenerations, and it is the main ruling. Everyone agrees that he does\nfulfill a mitzvah if he heeds what they say.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this and what I have bolded, it is an obligation to obey one's parents (see the book for exceptions), and it arises from Kibbud. It also has aspects that touch in Yira.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the minimal requirement required to nullify chametz kept in a public fridge?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let's say someone keeps chametz in a shared office fridge. The fridge is used by both Jews and non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>On the morning of Erev Pesach, prior to the time that it is prohibited to own <em>chametz</em>, the owner nullifies the chametz in his mind as well as verbally says (not in front of others) that he no longer owns the chametz and it is no <em>hefker</em>. Furthermore, he will not be going to work during Hol Hamo'ed, so there is no concern that he may accidentally see the chametz during Pesach. </p>\n\n<p>Is this sufficient nullification of the chametz, or must he physically give the chametz to a non-Jew or throw it away / flush it down the toilet / burn it, etc.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Following the first Tosfot Pesachim 2a (1) there is no need for bedika in this case because there is no risk he will eat it, Bedika is a stringency added miderabanan (Chiddushei haRitba explains that Bedika is miderabanan if he already did make a bitul, not before, before it's deorayta. The comment of Rashi is close to this, Bitul or Bedika is deOrayta when it falls in first position. And he writes further that the Rosh says that even before bitul Bedika is miderabanan. Tur OC 436 also rules it's derabanan. The Ran says that chachomim are afraid that some people will not make sincerely the bitul.).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(1)  ונראה לר\"י דאע\"ג דסגי בביטול בעלמא החמירו חכמים לבדוק חמץ ולבערו שלא יבא לאכלו וכן משמע לקמן (דף י:) דבעי רבא ככר בשמי קורה וכו' או דלמא זימנין דנפל ואתי למיכליה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But from the Gemara teku regarding Chamets at the bottom of a well, regarding Chashash perhaps he will go down to fix something, office is not less a Chashash.</p>\n\n<p>But following the end of the Tosfot even if it's miderabanan, from the Gemara regarding Seur, we say that there is no bal yerae and no isur after pesach but he needs to burn it. So, there is a chyuv Bedika even without the risk to eat.</p>\n\n<p>But the Gemara in 6a says that if he leaves the office less than 30 days before Pesach, despite that he will not come back into Pesach, he needs to make Bedika because the mitzvot of Pesach are already relevant. <strong>See SA OC 436.1</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

On all nights we don’t dip, tonight we dip twice. Tonight we eat maror, and on all nights we don’t. On all nights we sit or lean as pleases us, tonight we specifically lean. The rest of the Haggadah goes on to explain why it changed, but mah nishtanah explains what changed. As for why it prefers ‘what changed’ over ‘why’, mah nishtanah is an opening to the Haggadah, so we start with the simple ‘what’ (like the תם son) vs. the more complicated ‘why’.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think the most literal translation of מה נשתנה הלילה הזה would be 'What changed this night from being like all other nights?'.\nWhich gets us to the same place as asking 'Why is this night different etc'.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it just flowed easier to ask 'Why is this night different etc' in yiddish, which is obviously the source of the common modern day English version.</p>\n\n<p>I think your suggesting of 'What is different etc' would've been phrased as some variant of '...מה משונה'. </p>\n\n\n",

Specifically, the usual text was</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‏… שלא עשנו כגויי הארצות ולא שמנו ככל משפחות האדמה שלא שם חלקנו <strong>כחלקם</strong> ולא גורלנו ככל המונם שהם משתחוים להבל וריק ומתפללים <strong>אל אל לא יושיע</strong> ואנחנו משתחוים…‏</p>\n<p>… that he didn't make us like the nations of the lands, and didn't set us like all the earth's families, that he didn't set our portion like <strong>their portion</strong>, nor our lot like all their masses, that they bow to nothing and emptiness and pray to <strong>a god that will not save</strong>, but we bow…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but the בעשי״ת text was</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‏… שלא עשנו כגויי הארצות ולא שמנו ככל משפחות האדמה שלא שם חלקנו <strong>כהם</strong> ולא גורלנו ככל המונם שהם משתחוים להבל וריק ומתפללים <strong>ללא יועיל</strong> ואנחנו משתחוים…‏</p>\n<p>… that he didn't make us like the nations of the lands, and didn't set us like all the earth's families, that he didn't set our portion like <strong>them</strong>, nor our lot like all their masses, that they bow to nothing and emptiness and pray to <strong>what will not help</strong>, but we bow…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis supplied in each case, and the translations are mine).</p>\n<p>Why the variation in the text for בעשי״ת?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Baladi Yemenite commentary Etz Hayyim by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi%E1%B8%A5yah_Sala%E1%B8%A5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yiḥyeh Salaḥ</a> writes on Aleinu as found in maariv of Rosh Hashana, and explains the change as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואומר במקום כחלקם, כהם. והטעם כתב בעל תולעת יעקב, מפני שעדיין לא ניתן להם חלק, אבל בשאר ימות השנה, שחלקם מבורר, אומר כחלקם. וכן אומרים עתה, ללא יועיל, כי, אל, הוא לשון כח וחלק שניתן לשרים שלהם, ובראש השנה לא חלקום עדין, אבל שאר ימות השנה, חלקם נתון להם, והם אל לא יועיל, אין בידם לשנות חלק הנגזר להם, עד כאן לשונו.</p>\n<p>And we say כהם instead of כחלקם. And the author of Tola'at Ya'akov wrote that the reason is because their lot is not yet apportioned, but in the rest of the year, when their lot is clear, we say כחלקם. And similarly we say now ללא יועיל, because אל is the language of power and the lot that is apportioned to their leaders, but on Rosh Hashana they have yet to be apportioned, but in the rest of the year, their lot is apportioned to them, and their power does not help them, it is not in their power to change their lot that was decreed for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found this in the tiklal set התכלאל המפואר אור מהרי״ץ.

Aleinu as found in Rosh Hashana musaf in that tiklal also has the adjusted language (כהם and ללא יועיל).

All the birds were mixed up, and half were offered as <em>chataot</em> and half as <em>olot</em>. The mishna describes how many offerings were valid (translation edited from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kinnim.3.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אחת לזו, ושתיים לזו, ושלוש לזו, ועשר לזו, ומאה לזו. עשה...  חציין למעלן, וחציין למטן: המרובה כשר.  זה הכלל:  כל מקום שאתה יכול לחלוק את הקינים, ולא יהו משל אישה אחת בין למעלן, בין למטן — מחצה כשר, ומחצה פסול; ובכל מקום שאין אתה יכול לחלוק את הקינים, עד שיהו משל אישה אחת בין למעלן, בין למטן — המרובה כשר.</p>\n<p>One [pair] from this woman and two [pairs] from this woman and three [pairs] from this woman and ten [pairs] from this one woman and one hundred [pairs] from this woman: ... If he [the Kohen] did half above and half below, the number of birds in the largest group [one hundred] are valid. This is the rule: Anytime you can divide the pairs so that one woman's birds will not be both above [the mid-line] and below [the mid-line], half will be valid and half will be invalid. Anytime you cannot divide the pairs other than such that one woman's [birds] will both above and below [the mid-line], the number of birds in the largest group are valid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rule explains the explicit example well: if five women have 1, 2, 3, 10, and 100 pairs, then it is impossible to arrange the 232 birds such that each women's birds are entirely <em>chataot</em> or entirely <em>olot</em>. Thus, the example agrees with the rule that the number of pairs in the largest group (ie. 100) is valid.</p>\n<p>However, this rule only works if the largest number is at least the sum of all the smaller numbers. But if four women bring 1, 1, 1, and 2 pairs, then there are always 3 valid <em>chataot</em> and 3 valid <em>olot</em> (and 3 is neither half of the total number of pairs nor the number of pairs in the largest group). This occurs anytime the largest group has fewer birds than the remaining birds.</p>\n<p>What is going on here? How have commentators addressed this issue?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# is it forbidden to vote for a non-Jewish president (or other government figure)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>it says in the Torah (I'm quoting from <a href=\"http://daatemet.org.il/en/torah-science-ethics/religion-ethics/gentiles-in-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gentiles in Halacha</a> btw):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>it is written in the Torah (Deuteronomy 17:15): “Then you shall\n  appoint a king over you, whom the Lord your G-d will choose: one from\n  among your brethren shall you set as king over you, but you shall not\n  set over you a stranger who is not your brother.” In Sifri, Shoftim,\n  paragraph 157 it says: “Your brother, and not from others” (that is to\n  say, Gentiles, for a Gentile king may not be appointed over Jews —\n  Rabbeinu Hillel). And not just a Gentile, but also a righteous\n  convert, considered a Jew in every matter, is disqualified for\n  kingship, as is explained in Midrash HaGadol: “‘You shall not set over\n  you a stranger ‘ — to exclude the convert… from here they said it is\n  forbidden to appoint a king from the converts, even after a number of\n  generations, until his mother is [one born] Jewish.”</p>\n  \n  <p>This is also  the law concerning <strong>any position of authority</strong>, as\n  explained in Kiddushin 76b: “We have learned: ‘Then you shall[23]\n  appoint a king over you from among your brethren,’ all appointments of\n  authority that you make should not be[24][made] except from among your\n  brethren.” Thus wrote Maimonides in chapter 1 of The Laws of Kings,\n  halacha 4: “We do not appoint a king from amongst the converts, even\n  after several generations, until his mother is [one born] Jewish, as\n  it is written, ‘You will not set over you a stranger who is not your\n  brother.’ Not only for kingship, but also for any position of\n  authority in Israel (<strong>?</strong>), <strong>neither a general nor chief</strong> over fifty people,\n  nor chief over ten people, <strong>nor even a person appointed to verify that\n  the water is distributed to the field</strong>s. It is superfluous to talk\n  about a judge or a nasi, who may not be other than [one born] a Jew,\n  as is written, ‘one from among your brethren shall you set as king\n  over you’–all the people whom you give positions of authority shall\n  not be from other than your brethren.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only questionable part is when it says, \"...Not only for kingship, but also for any position of authority in Israel..\", is this only talking about a ruler in the <strong>land</strong> of Israel, or does it mean a position of authority over the <strong>people</strong> of Israel (wherever they may be)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are two sorts of rulership in Halacha - \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\".</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The first is choosing a \"G-d sent\" position - a King - by a prophet and not by elections, and then populating all the different jobs that \"descend from it\", down to the lowest level.</p>\n<p>This is what Rambam means by \"positions\" - ones that come from the power of the top of the pyramid - the King. This is why this Halocho is brought in Hilchot Melachim - Laws of Kings. It this system there are various limitations, such as the position is hereditary, a woman or a Gentile can't be appointed, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The second approach is what we call today \"democracy\", is the opposite, it comes from the agreement between people, based on the majority of votes and is not limited by who can elect and be elected, like women or children or Gentiles.</p>\n<p>This system can work anywhere from a House committee, to a football club to the city hall and to the whole country. This is called Hilchot Shutafim - the Laws of Partnership.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NB: Again please note: in the case of a King - he and all others are APPOINTED, in the case of democracy they are ELECTED.</p>\n\n\n",

If it’s a reversal of the original sale, which was retroactively a <em>mekach ta’us</em>, the seller should have no right to refuse a refund. If it’s a new sale, the seller is under no obligation to buy the item back, and can therefore refuse the refund.

They quote two answers (it's unclear from their wording who said which answer):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Gra doesn't hold that one should say Pesukim regarding the Karban Pesach in the Second Temple, since the Temple didn't have the same level of holiness as the First one (cf. Yoma 21b and 52b). </li>\n<li>Those Karbanos which Ezra brought were from animals taken from Daryavesh and his advisers; this was a Hora'as Sha'ah, since in general one may not buy animals from an idolater (cf. Avodah Zarah 22a). Since the purpose of saying Seder Karban Pesach is that our speech should substitute for actually bringing the Karbanos, we prefer to only discuss Karbanos brought in the ideal manner.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

I am surprised to learn that he nonetheless has authority over her as if he were her husband.</p>\n\n<p>Does a <em>yavam</em> in fact have husband-like authority over his maybe-future-wife, and the <em>sotah</em> warning is no different?  For example, can he annul her vows or use her property?  If so, how do we reconcile that with the quoted text from Bamidbar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.5.29?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5:29</a>)?  </p>\n\n<p>Or is this husband-like status specific to the <em>sotah</em> case?  If so, how do we learn it?</p>\n\n<p>This question is <em>not</em> about the court's warning per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sotah.4.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 4:5</a>; in that case they are acting on behalf of an actual husband.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is clear from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.24b.6?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemora 24b</a> that a <em>Yevama</em> before <em>Yibbum</em> (consummation), the Yevama is not at all in her dead husband's brother's authority except:<br>\n- She is forbidden to engage in relatonships with anyone else unless Chalitza is performed.<br>\n- the brother in-law can warn her as a <em>sotah</em> (Thanks @Monica for mentioning this info) for the future when they are fully married that she cannot be secluded with a man (though if she secludes herself while she is before full marriage as a <em>shomeres Yavam</em>, she does not drink the sotah waters <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.25b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 25b</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Even after consummation of the brother having fulflled Yibbum, if it was done in her fathers house (i.e there is no <em>chupa</em> - her entering the husbands domain), there is a Machlokes between Rav and Shmuel whether she is a fully married with regards to<br>\n1.inheriting <em>her</em> property when she dies, or eating <em>Peiros Nichse milug</em> i.e cut off from her property.<br>\n2.<em>metamei</em>(contracting impurity of a dead body) himself inorder to bury her if he's a Cohen<br>\n3.<em>hafaras nedorim</em> (anulling her vows).<br>\n-<strong>Rav</strong> holds Yibbum does not require <em>chupa</em> and she is a full wife regarding the aforementioned things as well as inheriting his brother and dvorcing her with a <em>gett</em>, as if Chupa was done in a regular marrage.<br>\n-<strong>Shmuel</strong> holds that she is only his wife with regards to whats written in the parsha, that she is divorced with a <em>Gett</em> rather than <em>Chaitza</em> which is no longer required, and He inherits <em>his dead Brothers</em> property by doing <em>Yibbum</em> but not the three things aforementioned until she enters his <em>chupa</em>. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>So the mishna which excludes <em>Yevama</em> from being a <em>Sotah</em> could be talking according to Shmuel about after she has done Yibbum in her fathers house and she is still not a full wife without <em>chuppah</em> so she cannot become a <em>Sotah</em>. This s explicit in the Gemora.  </li>\n<li>Alternatively the Mishna could be talking about before <em>Yibbum</em> where she is not his wife at all and therefore cannot become a <em>Sotah</em> this would be Rav's explanation. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A yabam is not a non-spouse as we can see from the drashot below. </p>\n\n<h3>A yabam cannot annul the vows of the yebama</h3>\n\n<p>There is a <em>berayta</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.29b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 29b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שומרת יבם בין יבם אחד בין שני יבמין ר\"א אומר יפר ר' יהושע אומר לאחד ולא לשנים דר' עקיבא אומר לא לאחד ולא לשנים </p>\n  \n  <p>... Rabbi Akiva says, even when there is only one yabam, he cannot make hafarat nedarim for the yebama. The Gemara says that this Berayta is even after maamar. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam rules as Rabbi Akiva, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Vows.11.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Nedarim 11:23</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שומרת יבם אפילו עשה בה יבמה מאמר ואפילו יבם אחד ליבמה אחת אינו מפר נדרי יבמתו עד שיבא עליה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>A yabam cannot use the property of the yebama</h3>\n\n<p>See Gemara Yevamot 38a-39a. In 39a, the conclusion (opinion of Rava) of the Gemara is even Bet Shammai, and even after maamar (a kind of Kiddushin given by the yabam before ybum) she is Safek Jesus and cannot use her property.</p>\n\n<h3>The yabam can warn the yebama directly, the warning or a shomeret yabam is direct, not by the court. See Gemara 24ab</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>ורבי יונתן האי איש איש מאי עביד ליה\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>מיבעי ליה לרבות אשת חרש ואשת שוטה ואשת שעמום</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara asks: And Rabbi Yonatan, who excludes both a betrothed woman and a widow awaiting her yavam from drinking the bitter water, what does he do with this term “any man”? What does it serve to include? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yonatan requires it in order to include the wife of a deaf-mute and the wife of an imbecile, and the wife of mentally ill person [shiamum], whom the court warns on behalf of the husband. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You see that shomeret yabam isn't included in those whom the court warns on behalf of the husband.</p>\n\n<h3>The explanation of the Mishna.</h3>\n\n<p>The first interpretation of the gemara (24 a) and the conclusion is that is that <strong>our Mishna follows</strong> and makes the Drasha of <strong>Rabbi Yonatan</strong> (regarding the disagreement in berayta if Shomeret Yabam must drink).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(24a) And whose opinion is expressed in the mishna? <strong>It is the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan</strong>, as it is taught in a baraita with regard to the verse:....(24b) Rabbi Yonatan says: The phrase “while under your husband” excludes a <strong>widow awaiting her yavam</strong> from drinking the bitter water. Lest one would say that I will exclude a widow awaiting her yavam but I will not exclude a betrothed woman, the verse therefore states: “This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, while under her husband, goes astray, and is defiled” (Numbers 5:29). The term “while under her husband” excludes a <strong>betrothed woman</strong> from drinking the bitter water. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shomeret Yabam has some \"stronger properties\". </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yoshia, who disagrees with Rabbi Yonatan, choices not to exclude her from the drinking because she is more wife than an Arusa, because she doesn't lack Chuppa (for this issue see Yevamot 29b)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Yoshiya, holds that the bond with the widow awaiting her yavam is stronger, as she is not lacking entry into the wedding canopy, as her marriage to the yavam is completed through sexual intercourse alone. Rabbi Yoshiya therefore excludes only a betrothed woman from drinking the bitter water. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But she has \"weaker properties\", the kiddushin don't come from the Yabam himself, the Arusa is stronger, because the kiddushin are from the Arus himself. So, in the first Myut of the drasha he excluded Shomeret Yabam from drinkind, she is less similary to a common wife. From the first Myut (תחת אישך) he excluded Shomeret Yabam, from the second Myut (תחת אישה) he excluded Betrothed woman. </p>\n\n<p>Further Gemara quotes a Drasha Rabbi Aba bar Chanina miDarom saying that there is no \"drinking\" for a woman who didn't sleep with her \"husband\" before sleeping with the \"Boel\". So why do we need the Drashot (תחת אישך, תחת אישה) of Rabbi Yonatan? (I don't explain the side of Rabbi Yoshia here) Gemara says that sometimes the Arus did make a intercourse of znut that is not Nisuyin. In this case we need the Drasha (תחת אישך) to exclude this case from Drinking.</p>\n\n<p>And the Yavam, who makes an intercourse of Znut, despite a intercourse of znut is a valid. , has not all properties of Husband (following Shmuel opinion), so we need the second Drasha (תחת אישה) to exclude him from Drinking. </p>\n\n<p>But Shmuel himself perhaps holds as Rabbi Yoshia (איש איש), and Shomeret Yabam will drink (more accurately Shomeret Yabam who had an intercourse of Znut with the Yabam) because of a Ribuy of Rabbi Yoshia, the ribbuy is a Chiddush that gives to the \"shomeret Yabam\" the status of wife.</p>\n\n<p>In fine we can assume that the Drasha of of Rabbi Aba bar Chanina miDarom (מבלעדי אישך) is the main choice of the Gemara for a standard betrothed or Shomeret yabam, and the drasha of the Mishna, the drasha of Rabbi Yonatan is auxiliary for particular cases.</p>\n\n<p>This is an explanation almost exhaustive of the Mishna.</p>\n\n\n",

The commentators on the <em>mishna</em>, following <em>Ula</em> in the <em>Bavli</em>, explain the dispute as follows: The school of <em>Hilel</em> maintains that if the girl refuses the marriage, then she can be married again and can refuse the second marriage also, and so on. The school of <em>Shamay</em> retorted \"the daughters of Israel are not wanton!\" and should not have successive annulled marriages. Rather, after her first refusal her next marriage must be irrevocable, and they describe two ways it can be made so: she can wait to marry until she's no longer a minor, or she can marry completely (rather than merely be \"betrothed\"): either way, they say, is irrevocable.</p>\n\n<p>Because the school of <em>Shamay</em> describes these two ways of ensuring a second marriage is irrevocable, it sounds to me like they would agree that, were these steps not taken, the second marriage would indeed be revocable. In other words, if she <em>were</em> betrothed again as a minor and then refused the betrothal, even the house of <em>Shamay</em> would hold the refusal to be effective. Is that so?</p>\n\n\n",

From this perspective, one could read the sentence as a metaphore said to a child, who is not interested so much, to convince him or her to follow the story. It also appears that the 4 qualities listed are necessary to make each of the sons of the hagadah interested. A parent <em>hacham</em> will interest the son <em>hacham</em>. A parent <em>zakein</em> will have patience with the rebelious son <em>rasha</em>. A parent <em>navon</em>, who can foresee the outcome, will be necessary to a son <em>tam</em>, who has tendency to completely be drawn into anything of interest. Finally, a person who knows entire Torah (at least in terms of the fundamental <em>klalim</em>), not just the one of the grown ups but also the one of the kids, will be necessary for the son who cannot ask to find what he wants or can get interested in.</p>\n<p>Danny Liberman's description of the qualities is different from what R. Herszeg writes in \"Patterns in Rashi\". There, חכמה - collection of information (basic, scripture), בינה - ability to see differences (like Rashi's commentary, which can differ for similar things in different places), דעה - ability to see similarities (think Tosafos' commentary), entire Torah - probably everything noted repeated back and forth many times.</p>\n<p>As far as the adults go, your question is based on the first half of the haggadah sentence, which further continues: And even were we all wise, all intelligent, all aged and all knowledgeable in the Torah, <em>still the command would be upon us to tell of the coming out of Egypt; and the more one tells of the coming out of Egypt, the more admirable it is</em>.</p>\n<p>The qualities listed in the first part of the sentence are intellectual. The purpose of the Seder, though is not to split hairs, but rather to re-experience Exodus from Mitzraim as if one suffered as a slave of Pharaoh, saw the plagues, found strength to join the Jewish people grouped around Moshe, jumped into the split Red Sea, and finally experienced true freedom. Thinking about Exodus exclusively in intellectual terms does not impact one's heart. Furthermore, the words הֲרֵי זֶה מְשֻׁבָּח - it is praiseworthy at the end of the paragraph in the question raise the question, what is זֶה? I believe, Rashi states that זֶה means adding praise to Hashem, rather than getting enjoyment of intellectual discussion. The Hagadah is explicit about it:</p>\n<p>GENERATION BY GENERATION, each person must see himself as if he himself had come out of Egypt, as it is said: “And you shall tell your child on that day, ‘Because of this the LORD acted for me when I came out of Egypt.’” It was not only our ancestors whom the Holy One redeemed; He redeemed us too along with them, as it is said: “He took us out of there, to bring us to the land He promised our ancestors and to give it to us.”</p>\n<p>The requirement to experience the story of a Yom Tov is not unique to Pesach but it is an integral part of every Jewish holiday.</p>\n\n\n",

Lavan wanted to kill Yaakov, because he ran away. In such a case, he would take his daughters and grandchildren back into his house detroying the birth of Jewish people, because Genesis 31:43:</p>\n<p>וַיַּ֨עַן לָבָ֜ן וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֗ב הַבָּנ֨וֹת בְּנֹתַ֜י וְהַבָּנִ֤ים בָּנַי֙ וְהַצֹּ֣אן צֹאנִ֔י וְכֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה רֹאֶ֖ה לִי־ה֑וּא וְלִבְנֹתַ֞י מָֽה־אֶעֱשֶׂ֤ה לָאֵ֙לֶּה֙ הַיּ֔וֹם א֥וֹ לִבְנֵיהֶ֖ן אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלָֽדוּ׃</p>\n<p>Then Laban spoke up and said to Jacob, “<strong>The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks; all that you see is mine.</strong> Yet what can I do now about my daughters or the children they have borne?</p>\n<p>As we know, the Pharao made a decree against the boys Exodus 1:16:</p>\n<p>וַיֹּ֗אמֶר בְּיַלֶּדְכֶן֙ אֶת־הָֽעִבְרִיּ֔וֹת וּרְאִיתֶ֖ן עַל־הָאׇבְנָ֑יִם אִם־בֵּ֥ן הוּא֙ וַהֲמִתֶּ֣ן אֹת֔וֹ וְאִם־בַּ֥ת הִ֖וא וָחָֽיָה׃</p>\n<p>saying, “When you deliver the Hebrew women, look at the birthstool: if it is a boy, kill him; if it is a girl, let her live.”</p>\n<p>===</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the Torah states Devarim 26:5:</p>\n<p>וְעָנִ֨יתָ וְאָמַרְתָּ֜ לִפְנֵ֣י ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ אֲרַמִּי֙ אֹבֵ֣ד אָבִ֔י וַיֵּ֣רֶד מִצְרַ֔יְמָה וַיָּ֥גׇר שָׁ֖ם בִּמְתֵ֣י מְעָ֑ט וַֽיְהִי־שָׁ֕ם לְג֥וֹי גָּד֖וֹל עָצ֥וּם וָרָֽב׃</p>\n<p>The Sefaria translates: You shall then recite as follows before your God יהוה: “My father was a fugitive Aramean.

Literally, one should translate אֲרַמִּי֙ אֹבֵ֣ד אָבִ֔י - \"the Aramean caused my father to be lost\". When Yaakov was leaving Itzchak's house, he dreamt about angels - very lofty ideas. By contrast in Lavan's house in Haran, he dreamt about sheep. Because Lavan constantly changed the conditions of the deal, Yaakov lost focus and could no longer dream about great ideas. His sons and daughter(s - if we accept words of Seder Olam that many sons were born with twin sister), who only saw their father taking care of the sheep, also could not learn any spirituality in the Lavan's house from a father, who was spiritually lost. All of them had to work for Lavan, i.e. Lavan wanted to kill all the Jews.</p>\n<p>While in Mitzraim majority of the Jewish people were enslaved, shevet Levi was not. They were free to learn about mitzvot and share the knowledge with people from other tribes. Alternatively, the work of the slaves was hard, while the women remained fertile.

I.e. pharaoh only wanted to destroy men/boys.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why was not Lavan punished?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lavan overcame his urge and obeyed the warning of G-d, as described in Bereshit 31. Lavan made a treaty with Yaakov. Upto this point Lavan could only be accused of idol worship. We do not know if Lavan died immediately afterwards or had a long life. Therefore, it is not clear if the question of no punishment is factual.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One approach as to \"why he became so evil\", could be a bit of background behind Lavan's beginnings, in particular his commitment to sorcery.</p>\n<p>We are told in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 25:6</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלִבְנֵ֤י הַפִּֽילַגְשִׁים֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לְאַבְרָהָ֔ם נָתַ֥ן אַבְרָהָ֖ם מַתָּנֹ֑ת וַֽיְשַׁלְּחֵ֞ם מֵעַ֨ל יִצְחָ֤ק בְּנוֹ֙ בְּעוֹדֶ֣נּוּ חַ֔י קֵ֖דְמָה אֶל־אֶ֥רֶץ קֶֽדֶם׃</p>\n<p>But to Avraham’s sons by concubines Avraham gave gifts while he was still living, and he sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, <strong>to the land of the East</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Chayei_Sara.26.264?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a> tells us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמֵהַהִיא אֶרֶץ קֶדֶם נָפְקוּ לָבָן וּבְעוֹר וּבִלְעָם בְּנוֹ וְכֻלְּהוּ חֳרָשֵׁי</p>\n<p>And from that land of the East came Lavan, Beor and Bilam, and all the sorcers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, we see from this region, there was a strong connection to sorcery. Indeed, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Beshalach.32.440?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a> says elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּגִין דְּלָבָן חַכִּים הֲוָה בַּחֲרָשִׁין וּבְאִינּוּן כִּתְרִין תַּתָּאִין, וּבְאִינּוּן בָּעָא לְאוֹבָדָא לְיַעֲקֹב</p>\n<p>Lavan was an expert on sorcery, with which he wished to destroy Yaakov.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are numerous sources that point to the fact that sorcery should be avoided e.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.18.9-13?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 8:9-13</a> it lists the various types and refers to it as an abomination,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.67b.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 67b</a> - למה נקרא שמן מכשפים שמכחישין פמליא של מעלה - \"Why are sorcerers called mekhashefim? Because it contradicts the heavenly entourage\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, we see that Lavan came from a world that was entrenched in sorcery, and that arguably played a part in \"turning\" him evil as it is built on something that completely disregards Hashem and His moral order.</p>\n\n\n",

And it is written further, Go, show thyself unto Ahab, and I will send rain upon the\n  land. Of dew, however, Scripture does not speak. Why? Because it is never withheld. But if it is never withheld, why did Elijah take an oath on it? — This is\n  what he conveyed to him [Ahab]. THe dew of blessing also would not fall.

One possibility is that even though dew is never withheld, there are different types of dew. As the above Talmudic passage states there might be dew but it might not be \"dew of blessing\". Thus the point of the prayer may be to focus on getting \"dew of blessing\" rather than just general dew. Indeed, at the crescendo of the prayer we recite the following three lines:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לברכה ולא לקללה<br> לחיים ולא למות<br> לשובע ולא לרזון</p>\n  \n  <p>For blessing and not for curse.<br>For life and not for death.<br>For plenty and not for scarcity.

Abraham Gombiner</a> may have alluded to this when he wrote:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x481\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham O.C. 114:4</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומ\"מ טוב לאומרו שיהיה לברכה</p>\n  \n  <p>And nevertheless it is good to say it so that it should be for blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Michel_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yechiel Michel Epstein</a> explains that the reason that we include dew in the request for rain is so that it should be \"dew of blessing\":</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7705&st=&pgnum=199\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan O.C. 114:6</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה שאומרים בשאלה ותן טל ומטר לברכה זהו אגב מטר דמבקשים שיהיה גם טל של ברכה דיש טל שאינה של ברכה [גמרא</p>\n  \n  <p>And this that we say in the request, \"and give dew and rain for blessing\", this is on account of rain, that we are asking that [the dew] should also be dew of blessing, as there is dew that is not of blessing (Gemara).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissim_of_Gerona\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Nissim</a> says something similar but slightly more elaborate:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ran Taanit 1a in Rif pagination</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפיכך נראה לי דהכי קאמר טל ורוחות כיון שאין נעצרין לגמרי אע\"פ שפוחתין ומוסיפין ואיכא נמי טל ברכה דמעצר כדאיתא בגמרא לא חייבו חכמים להזכיר דאין החיוב אלא במה שהוא נעצר לגמרי ואעפ\"כ אם בא להזכיר כדי שיתוספו בזמן הראוי להם מזכיר</p>\n  \n  <p>It therefore seems to me that this is what it means: dew and winds since they are not completely withheld – though they may be decreased or increased and there is also dew of blessing that is withheld as mentioned in the Talmud – the Sages did not require [us] to mention [them] since the obligation is only for that which is withheld completely. And even so, if one comes to mention [them] in order that they be increased in their proper time, he can mention [them].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this, the reason why we pray for dew may also be to get <em>more</em> dew, as it is only a minimal amount that is never withheld.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the possibility that the prayer is to prevent <em>bad</em> dew. We find a similar idea in another Talmudic passage:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=62&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 62a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מוליך ומביא מעלה ומוריד [וכו׳]. אמר רבי חייא בר אבא אמר רבי יוחנן מוליך ומביא למי שהרוחות שלו מעלה ומוריד למי שהשמים והארץ שלו במערבא מתנו הכי אמר רב חמא בר עוקבא אמר רבי יוסי בר רבי חנינא מוליך ומביא כדי לעצור רוחות רעות מעלה ומוריד כדי לעצור טללים רעים אמר רבי יוסי בר רב אבין זאת אומרת שירי מצוה מעכבים את הפורענות דהא תנופה שירי \n  מצוה היא ועוצרת רוחות רעות וטללים רעים</p>\n  \n  <p>AND WAVES THEM FORWARD AND BACKWARD AND UPWARD AND DOWNWARD. R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan, FORWARD AND BACKWARD,   that is to Him unto Whom the [four] directions belong; UPWARD AND DOWNWARD, that is to Him unto Whom heaven and earth belong. In the West it was taught as follows: R. Hama b. ‘Ukba said in the name of R. Jose b. R. Hanina, FORWARD AND BACKWARD, in order to keep off violent winds; UPWARD AND DOWNWARD, in order to keep off harmful dews.</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Jose son of R. Abin said, This proves that even the dispensable rites of a precept  [when performed] ward off punishment, for the rite of waving is dispensable in the precept and yet it keeps off violent winds and harmful dews. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Menachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here the Talmud assumes that there is harmful dew that is worth being protected from, and also assumes that doing something non-essential can protect against it. Similarly, then, though there is no obligation to pray for dew it may still be worthwhile to pray that we be protected from bad dew. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One implication of the question is that if something is automatic, there should be no prayer regarding it. Another implication (possibly supported by the wording of the piyut by Kalir) is that  Tefillas Tal is a request for dew. </p>\n\n<p>Both implications are incorrect. </p>\n\n<p>We say every day that Hashem is המחדש בכל יום תמיד מעשה בראשית (renews every day the operation of creation). That is that Hashem is worthy of praise because the world continues to function as it did yesterday and before. So we see that we praise Hashem for the automatic operation of “nature”. The same should apply for dew. </p>\n\n<p>The mishna תענית א א refers to משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם (the parallel statement to מוריד הטל) as גבורות גשמים  - the power of Hashem to give rain and not as pointed out by Rebbi Eliezer לא אמרתי לשאול, אלא להזכיר in the mishnah to request rain. We just mention Hashem's power  at the appropriate time. </p>\n\n<p>So if dew were more automatic than rain that would not be a reason not to mention Hashem's power in enabling dew in creation at the appropriate time. </p>\n\n\n",

However, in this final plague, Hashem acted explicitly and did not allow Moshe to be his agent, as he acted in the rest of the Exodus and as the leader in the desert.

How does this translate to modern applications of leisure gardening - e.g. of decorative flower beds or vegetable gardens that are grown for decoration or as a hobby, but not out of a financial need?

The more frequently found על גבי המזבח (Mishna Zevachim 8:12, for example) and the lesser used על גב המזבח (Eduyot 6:1). They seem to refer to the same concept -- something being poured onto the altar -- possibly its side? (as opposed to Isaac having been bound atop).</p>\n\n<p>There are citations for the same schism when the phrase lacks the \"ha\" before \"mizbei'ach\" (even in cases where the word mizbei'ach ends the sentence).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a difference in meaning or reference between Gav and Gabei?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The phrase גב המזבח actually dates back to Tanach (Yechezkel 43:13). Perhaps the phrase גבי המזבח is Mishnaic Hebrew, while גב המזבח is Biblical, and over time the latter morphed into the former.</p>\n<p>Notice that the phrase גב המזבח isn’t just uncommon in Mishnayos; Eduyos 6:1 is its only appearance. Based on the above, this can be justified by noting that Eduyos dates back to Bo Bayom (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.28a.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 28a</a>), which was in Rabban Gamliel’s time, two generations before Rebbi Yehudah HaNasi; if I’m correct that גב eventually morphed into גבי, the fact that Eduyos is older than the rest of Shas could have preserved the old spelling, before it changed.</p>\n<p>The same could apply for its transition from מזבח to המזבח. The phrase גב מזבח never appears anywhere before the close of Shas: the earliest I see its usage is Rashi to the cited passuk in Yechezkel; both later usages I see are people quoting this Rashi.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, גבי מזבח appears just twice in Mishnayos (Sukkah 5:5 and Temurah 6:4), once in Yerushalmi, and seven times in Bavli, while גבי המזבח appears 27 times in Yerushalmi and 24 times in Bavli. This would seem to indicate that this change took much longer to happen than the previous one.</p>\n<p>(Note that these numbers aren’t <em>totally</em> accurate since Braisos are included in Bavli and Yerushalmi, but the general thrust of the point should remain the same. If someone wants to do their own search and divide it up further by generation, feel free.)</p>\n\n\n",

It would be more usual to put them before the ending bracha (like צמאה נפשי, which is now typically used for Friday night but was originally intended to go before נשמת - in principle you could combine both customs by singing it before נשמת at a Friday night seder).  The closest parallel I can think of is saying שיר המעלות after Yishtabach on the Yamim Noraim.

Either you believe or you don't.</p>\n\n<p>If you believe then why do you need more hishtadlus if you don't believe aren't you considered a heretic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Chaim, welcome to Mi Yodeya.</p>\n\n<p>I am not overly familiar with the changing nuances of \"yeshivish\", so I can't say that this particular phrase is something that I have heard verbatim. But, in addressing the concept implied by your question, you may want to gain some clarity between two similar terms - <em>bitachon</em> and <em>emunah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous articles on this topic, but I think this summary from <a href=\"https://theshmuz.com/parsha-article/shemos-the-difference-between-emunah-and-bitachon/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Shmuz\"</a> is good:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rambam defines emunah as the knowledge that HASHEM created and\n  continues to run all of Creation. Simply put, nothing can exist and no\n  activity can occur without HASHEM.</p>\n  \n  <p>Bitachon, however, is a quite different. The Chovos Halevovos defines\n  bitachon as trusting in HASHEM. It is a sense of relying on HASHEM to\n  watch over and protect me, as if to say, “I take my heavy burden and\n  place it on HASHEM.” While I am responsible to be proactive, I am not\n  in charge of the outcome, and I am not the determinant of the results.\n  I rely on HASHEM to care for me.</p>\n  \n  <p>Emunah is a state of understanding; bitachon is a state of trust.\n  Emunah means knowing that HASHEM is involved in every activity on the\n  planet; bitachon means trusting in HASHEM in every situation.</p>\n  \n  <p>A person can have emunah and not bitachon</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to clarify the expression that you've probably heard, you are correct in that either you have <em>emunah</em> or not. This is kind of an absolute degree of understanding and appreciation. Either you believe that God is responsible for everything that happens or not. You can't just believe that God is responsible for some things and not for others. The concept of <em>emunah</em> is that God is involved in <em>everything</em>. If you don't believe that, you have a lack of <em>emunah</em>. I think a heretic involved specific stronger action then just a lack of emunah. I.e. this doesn't deny that there is a God, and it doesn't mean that you convince others of the idea. It's that you think that some things, perhaps, happen by God, but not other things. A heretic denies that God is involved in anything at all.</p>\n\n<p>Now bitachon - yes, there are definitely levels to this. We see this every day in numerous people. Many people believe that if they invest in Amazon stocks today, that almost guarantees that they will make a profit in a year. What happens when that fails? They mope, they suffer distress, etc. They didn't trust that the ultimate outcome is up to God. They lacked <em>bitachon</em>. Or, opposite, I'm sure you've seen shidduchim break off because someone found a minor flaw in the other and thought that was major to not make the marriage work. If they had a greater level of <em>bitachon</em>, and trusted that God decides the outcome, they might have continued the shidduch.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, I think people really mean to say \"My level of <em>bitachon</em> is not great; I need to work on that.\" It is, possible that they were referring to \"emunah\", but, as I explained, above, it seems that <em>emunah</em> doesn't have degrees or partiality.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I'll give you an example: It is very clearly seen here in Jerusalem's HMOs when the residents of all kinds bring their kids to vaccinate. First, come the secular, then Kipah Sruga, then the Litvakes, then the Chassidishers and the last (but not least) the Yerushalmi. And some never come.</p>\n\n<p>And we can rate them clearly according to their level of Bitachon in Hashem. So each previous group can say \"I don't have that level of Bitachon of the next group ... to put my kids in danger\". </p>\n\n\n",

Here, they are specific about the language one must use to count each night.</p>\n\n<p>One particular area that convinces me that you cannot count backwards is mentioned in the Mishnah Berurah commentary #8. There is a discussion as to whether the phrasing is <em>ba'omer</em> (in the Omer) or <em>la'omer</em> (to the Omer). Regardless, of which version one uses, it is clear that one needs to mention the term \"Omer\" to specify that the counting began from the day that the Omer offering is brought, which was 16 Nissan.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the Torah itself in Devarim 16:9 - Deuteronomy 16:9 Sefaria says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You shall count off seven weeks; start to count the seven weeks when\n  the sickle is first put to the standing grain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rash\"i explains the date that counting starts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>i.e. from when the “Omer” has been cut (from the sixteenth of Nisan)\n  which is the first produce to be harvested (Leviticus 23:10) (cf.\n  Sifrei Devarim 136:2-3; Menachot 71a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it's clear from these two sources that the counting begins the day that the Omer offering was brought and we count the number of days from that point moving forwards.

And how could this result in a co equality of persons in the one God?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We see countless times in the OT that the Spirit of the Lord was upon a prophet, and that the Spirit of the Lord was acting in a particular way or doing a particular.\nAlso, NT Jews (namely, Mary and the disciples of John) did not appear to be shocked when they heard of this Holy Ghost. It seems had this been addressing another person in God they would be a little confused upon hearing this, but it instead they are not shocked at all as if they knew it was simply a way of addressing God in a role of interaction with humanity.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What was the Hebrew understanding of the Messiah in the OT? And how could this result in a co equality of persons in the one God?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Without predication, the OT displays that the messiah who is to be born will be called, among other things; Immanual, Wonderful Consoler, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace. Holding the view that Jesus is God, it seems a far leap to say this person was co-eternal and co-existent with God the Father through all eternity rather than Jesus simply being another way God revealed himself to humanity, just this time as a genuine human. e.g. The burning bush, the glory that was revealed to Moses in Exodus 33, the angel to Jacob, the men to Abraham, and so on.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there any hint of a singular, tri personal Jehovah found in the OT? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>People like to reference Genesis 1:26 as a reference to plurality in God.</p>\n\n<p>People reference the plural nature of Elohim as referencing multiple persons in God (although if taken at face value, the word would mean God's, which is a belief I doubt anyone from the trinitarian faith would intentionally profess.)</p>\n\n<p>People like to reference the compound nature of achad as a reference to a plurality of persons. (although from this arises the same issue as the above mention)</p>\n\n<p>Again, I hope this question(s) is in a format acceptable, and I hope to gleam some good information about the Jewish understanding of God's nature.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The basic answer is that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Given the STRICT monotheistic nature of the Jewish religion (Deut 6:4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is <strong>no</strong> connection between the Torah and any developments of other religions.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that the terms <em>Old Testament</em> and <em>New Testament</em> were invented by the Christians in order to promote their (incorrect) replacement theology.</p>\n\n<p>As regards your bullet points, the term <em>Holy Spirit</em> is misused by the Christians to make if sound as if it is a separate being rather than a metaphor used to show an action of G-d. It is similar the the metaphors that we have used recently in the haggadah of Passover such as an <em>Outstretched Arm</em> etc.</p>\n\n<p>BTW the term <em>ghost</em> is a mis-translation to make it sound like a separate being.</p>\n\n<p>The messiah is a human being and does not have any god-like powers. In fact, it means someone who was <em>anointed</em> to a position. This means that the kings and priests were officially anointed with oil to become invested with the power of their position. We use the term <em>the messiah</em> to refer to the king that G-d will send for the final redemption. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188343/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides in THE LAWS OF KINGS AND THEIR WARS</a> goes into these laws and discusses what it means.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#v26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 1:26</a> does not use a plural for <em>G-d</em> as in Hebrew the plural form is used to show authority. </p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882#v6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 21:6</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהִגִּישׁ֤וֹ אֲדֹנָיו֙ אֶל־הָ֣אֱלֹהִ֔ים וְהִגִּישׁוֹ֙ אֶל־הַדֶּ֔לֶת\n  א֖וֹ אֶל־הַמְּזוּזָ֑ה וְרָצַ֨ע אֲדֹנָ֤יו אֶת־אָזְנוֹ֙ בַּמַּרְצֵ֔עַ\n  וַֽעֲבָד֖וֹ לְעֹלָֽם:</p>\n  \n  <p>And his master shall bring him to the judges, and he shall bring him\n  to the door or to the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear with\n  an awl, and he shall serve him forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Uses the plural term for <em>master</em> even though it has a singular meaning. Also note the the term for judges is the same as the word used for G-d (with the attribute of Power). This is a completely secular meaning and does not denote godly power.</p>\n\n<p>The meaning in Genesis is thus singular. In fact the talmud and commentaries ask this as Rashi explains</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Let us make man:</strong> Even though they [the angels] did not assist Him in His creation, and there is an opportunity for the heretics to rebel\n  (to misconstrue the plural as a basis for their heresies), Scripture\n  did not hesitate to teach proper conduct and the trait of humility,\n  that a great person should consult with and receive permission from a\n  smaller one. Had it been written: “I shall make man,” we would not\n  have learned that He was speaking with His tribunal, but to Himself.\n  And the refutation to the heretics is written alongside it [i. e., in\n  the following verse:]“And God created (וַיִּבְרָא) ,” and it does not\n  say,“and they created וַיִּבְרְאוּ.” - [from Gen. Rabbah 8:9]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I should also note that the word <em>echad</em> is <strong>not</strong> a compund unity but a completely singular and unique reference. As Rashi says on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970#v4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:4</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Lord is our God; the Lord is one: The Lord, who is now our God and\n  not the God of the other nations-He will be [declared] in the future\n  “the one God,” as it is said: “For then I will convert the peoples to\n  a pure language that all of them call in the name of the Lord” (Zeph.\n  3:9), and it is [also] said: “On that day will the Lord be one and His\n  name one” (Zech. 14:9). (see Sifrei)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>First, permission from the community (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.91a.11?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 91a</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Geviha ben Pesisa said to the Sages: Give me permission and I will go and deliberate with them before Alexander of Macedon. If they will defeat me, say to them: You have defeated an ordinary person from among us, and until you overcome our Sages, it is no victory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Although I voted to close this discussion for being too broad, I've found one false premise that all of your questions are based on - that the OT is the source for our religious beliefs and our day-to-day religious conduct.</p>\n\n<p>It is not. Since the era of the destruction of the second Temple, we rely exclusively on our sages' Oral Tradition including their interpretations of the OT. In other words, the Talmud and all of its interpreters is our source of Judaism and not the OT. </p>\n\n<p>So when answering your questions we don't look at the OT to find the answers but turn to our Sages' tradition. So here's our Sages view on your questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><em>\"the Holy Ghost in the OT\"</em> - no such thing. There's G-d, there are non-material angels and there are humans. Nothing in-between. See Rambam Hilchot Yesodey Hatorah.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>\"understanding of the Messiah in the OT\"</em> - Messiah is a regular person, A descendant of King David, who's worthy to be appointed as a King. Nothing more, no holy spirit here. See Rambam Hilchot Melachim.</p></li>\n<li><p>No, no such hints whatsoever as G-d is one. While He is called different names it is because of our inability to see His oneness but only the manifestations.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. Now, before this question is closed, I'd recommend you not to ask questions about comparative religion as they are considered off-topic, in other words, we don't like talking about other religions.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is light in a fridge on Shabbat \"melacha shein tzricha legufah\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember learning that when I open a fridge door on Shabbat and the light turns on that would be under the category of melacha shein tzricha legufah?</p>\n<p>Can anyone please provide a source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are two overlapping issues whenever someone does a melacha - one is the kavannah, the other is the need. Each of them can possibly lead to a leniency.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>What am I doing?<br />\n1a) If I do an action that <em>may</em> indirectly result in a melacha, that's a classic דבר שאינו מתכוין - I am trying to do something else, and the melacha I don't intend. We hold this is completely allowed, because the melacha is unconnected to my action.<br />\n1b) פסיק רישיה - If I do an action that <em>will certainly</em> result in a melacha, even though it's a side effect of what I'm trying to do - that undoes the heter of אינו מתכוין. Since it is inevitable, we say that you kinda really do intend it; it is connected to my action as if I'm doing it on purpose.<br />\nThis is an issue only where the melacha is done indirectly, as a result of doing something else.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Separate issue: What do I want this for?<br />\n2a) If I am doing the melacha for a <em>very different purpose</em> than the one that was done in the mishkan (or according to Rashi, for a purpose which isn't positive, where I'm just trying to remove a problem rather than gain something), that is called אינה צריכה לגופא, and we hold that the person cannot be חייב חטאת. It may still be forbidden d'rabanan. There are leniencies for this in some circumstances, such as when he is relieving pain (צער).<br />\n2b) If I am doing the melacha for the <em>same purpose</em> as was done in the mishkan (or according to Rashi, for any positive purpose where I gain as a result) that is called צריכה לגופא, 'needed for \"itself\"', and the person can be חייב חטאת for doing it.<br />\nThis issue can apply even if I did the melacha directly.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So these are different kinds of issue. The first is to decide if I \"did the melacha\", the second is to decide if the melacha was done \"for the right purpose\" to count as a full-fledged melacha of Shabbos. You need to check out both; each may or may not contribute a leniency.</p>\n<p>In the case you described, you can see that since it is inevitable that the light will go on, on the first issue it goes into case 1b, פסיק רישיה. You do not get the heter of אינו מתכוין - we consider it as if you did it directly.<br />\nWe can <em>still</em> talk about whether the melacha done is happening for the right purpose, the second issue. Do you need the light on? If it is useless to you, you want to get to the food and the light doesn't matter at all, that would be (2a), מלאכה שאינה צריכה לגופא - you don't need it for the purpose in the mishkan, or any positive purpose at all. In that case, the person cannot be חייב for the melacha. It still may be פטור אבל אסור - forbidden d'rabanan.<br />\nHowever, in that case there are some Rishonim who hold that this <em>combination</em> \"פסיק רישיה דלא ניחא ליה\" (=1b+2a), a psik reisha that he doesn't want, is completely allowed, not even forbidden d'rabanan. Sometimes we can be more lenient when we have both together.<br />\nIf you <em>did</em> want the refrigerator light - say it's dark inside the fridge and you can use the help finding things - then it would be (2b) after all, and you would not have <em>either</em> heter here: פסיק רישיה דניחא ליה - a psik reisha that he wants.</p>\n<p>Update: My son insists that everyone likes the light in the refrigerator, you can see better. I'm not convinced that I care in our lighted kitchen.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>By the way -- <em>melacha</em> is feminine, and therefore the expression is *melacha she'einah tzricha legufah\" -- \"work not needed for its own self.\" And it doesn't appear to qualify as such.</p>\n\n<p>The light bulb appears instead to be a classic case of <em>psik reisha</em> -- \"I just want to take the head off this chicken, I don't necessarily want the side effect of the chicken dying.\" Thus -- \"I just want to open the door, not necessarily the side effect of the light turning on.</p>\n\n<p><em>Melacha she'eina tzricha legufah</em> means I intend to do a <em>melacha</em> action, but for a totally different purpose than its normal (or as-in-the-Mishkan) one. A normal purpose of burning is to generate light and heat; so when I flick on a light switch intending to make a tungsten filament get hot and light up the room, that is a normal use case of <em>hav'arah</em>. (An <em>einah tzricha legufa</em> case would be burning a promissory note to dispose of it after the debt's been paid. Constructive, but not the \"normal\" use of burning.)  </p>\n\n<p>Therefore pretty much anytime one turns on an incandescent bulb, it's <em>tzricha legufah.</em> The arguments instead hinge on whether my actions (opening the door) connect to the melacha (heating metal to produce light). </p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Dina was Job’s wife. That is why he said to her: “You are speaking as one of the disgusting women [nevalot] would speak. Shall we accept the good from God, [and not accept the bad]?” (Job 2:10). “Shall I accept,” is not written here, but rather, “shall we accept [nekabel]” – should we be pleased with the good but not be pleased with the bad? That was a rhetorical question. “With all this, Job did not sin with his lips” (Job 2:10) – [<strong>the implication is:] with his lips he did not sin, but in his heart he did sin]</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: “<strong>And I ate [veakhalti]” is not written here, but rather, “vaokhel” – I ate and I will eat again</strong>.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Adam the first man was banished only after he blasphemed and spoke sacrilegiously. That is what is written: “He hoped to produce grapes, but it produced sour grapes” (Isaiah 5:2).  “The Lord God said to the woman: What is this you have done? The woman said: The serpent enticed me, and I ate” (Genesis 3:13). “The woman said: The serpent enticed me [hishiani], and I ate” – [hishiani has three meanings:] It enticed me, it brought liability upon me, and it misled me. It enticed me, as it says: “The enemy will not entice [yashi] you” (Psalms 89:23). It brought liability upon me, as it says: “When you lend [tashe] to your neighbor” (Deuteronomy 24:10). It misled me, as it says: “Now, do not allow Hezekiah to mislead [yashi] you” (II Chronicles 32:15).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, in his heart he wanted to continue sinning regardless. We also know that Adam simply accepted his punishment and did not realize that he can repent, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.22.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 22:13</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Cain departed [vayetze] from the presence of the Lord, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden” (Genesis 4:16).\n“Cain departed from the presence of the Lord” – from where did he depart? Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: He cast the words behind him and departed, as though deceiving the Most High. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon: He departed as one who shows a split hoof, and as one who deceives his Creator.\nRabbi Ḥama said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Rabbi Yitzḥak: He departed joyfully, just as it says: “Here he is going out [yotze] to meet you [and he will see you and he will rejoice in his heart]” (Exodus 4:14). <strong>Adam the first man encountered him. He said to him: ‘What became of your sentence?’ He said to him: ‘I repented and reached a settlement.’ Adam the first man began beating himself on the face, saying: ‘Such is the power of repentance, and I did not know.’</strong> Immediately, Adam the first man stood and said: “A psalm, a song for the Shabbat day…” (Psalms 92:1). Rabbi Levi said: Adam the first man said this Psalm, but it was forgotten from his generation, and Moses came and reintroduced it in his own name: “A psalm, a song for the Shabbat day. It is good to give thanks [lehodot] to the Lord…” (Psalms 92:1–2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess a better question is how come Adam did not realize that he could try doing teshuva, why such an idea remained hidden for 130 years? Perhaps it should be related to the nature of his sin. Or perhaps if Adam knew that he could repent before the sin, Hashem would not let him repent at all as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.8.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Yoma 8:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With regard to one who says: I will sin and then I will repent, I will sin and I will repent, Heaven does not provide him the opportunity to repent, and he will remain a sinner all his days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The alternative answer is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/144282/did-g-d-foresee-the-sin-of-knowledge/144337#144337\">discussed here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

[Adam] said to [Kayin], “What happened with your judgement?” He said to him, “I repented and compromised.” Adam began banging his face; he said, “This is the power of repentance, and I didn’t know!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whether this means that he didn’t know repentance existed, or that he knew repentance existed but didn’t know it applied even to a sin like his, I’m not sure. In any event, he didn’t repent because he didn’t think he was able to. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is \"Reishit Ketzir\" a holiday, half-holiday, regular day, or else?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 23:10</a>, one encounters the term \"Reishit Ketzirchem\" (i.e. \"Reishit Ketzir\" = Beginning of Harvest). \"Thus, one is permitted to proceed with the general harvest only after this omer has been reaped\" [Sifthei Chachamim; Men. 71a], so quoted in Rashi. </p>\n\n<p>What do the rabbis say about \"<em>Reishit Ketzir</em>\" (Beginning of Harvest)? </p>\n\n<p>Namely: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is it a holiday/chag, half-holiday, regular day, chol-moed, etc.? </li>\n<li>Is it a part of Chag Pesach or of Chag Matzot or a stand-alone chag? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would like to know if I am reading this correctly. Is it not written in Menachot.10 (for example) that ראשית קציר (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 23:10</a>) was reaped by just one person on shabbat (\"אֶחָד בְּשַׁבָּת וְאֶחָד בְּחֹל\" Menachot.10), best occuring on the <strong>night</strong> of Nisan 16 (\"מִצְוָתוֹ לִקְצֹר בַּלַּיְלָה\" Menachot.10) and יום הנף took place on the <strong>morning</strong> of Nisan 16; and by <strong>afternoon</strong> of Nisan 16, the markets are full of harvest (\"מִשֶּׁקָּרַב הָעֹמֶר, יוֹצְאִין וּמוֹצְאִין שׁוּק יְרוּשָׁלַיִם שֶׁהוּא מָלֵא קֶמַח וְקָלִי\" Menachot.10)? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Additionally</strong> (if it helps): </p>\n\n<p>Another phrase that has the word \"Ketzir\" is \"Bikurey Ketzir\" בכורי קציר , which is also known as \"Chag Shavuoth\" חג השבועות in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.28.26?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 28:26</a>. This is a commentary in Rashi: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וביום הבכורים: חג השבועות קרוי בכורי קציר חטים על שם שתי הלחם, שהם ראשונים למנחת חטים הבאים מן החדש: — [Menachos 84b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My conclusion is:\nIf \"Bikurey Ketzir\" בכורי קציר (which occurs during Chag Shavuoth) is \"Chag Shavuoth\" (Numbers 28:26), then \"Reishit Ketzir\" ראשית קציר (which occurs during Chag Matzot) is \"Chag Matzot\" (Leviticus 23:6). </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When I look at the translations of Lev 23 (10) I get no impression that there is a day referred to as Reishis Ketzir.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9924#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When you come to the\n  Land which I am giving you, and you reap its harvest, you shall bring\n  to the kohen an omer of <strong>the beginning of your reaping.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.23.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Speak to the Israelite people and say to them: When you enter the land\n  that I am giving to you and you reap its harvest, you shall bring the\n  <strong>first</strong> sheaf <strong>of your harvest</strong> to the priest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Reishis Ketzir is not a day and the Rabbis have nothing to say about it as a day. </p>\n\n<p>The procedure of cutting the omer is explained in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Menachot.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Menochos 10 (3)</a>. </p>\n\n<p>ADDITION</p>\n\n<p>Sources show that it was permitted to begin eating the harvest of new grain in the times of the Beis Hamikdosh after the waving of the omer offering. Also it is clear that after the destruction of the Beis Hamikdosh, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that for the entire day of waving the omer offering, i.e., the sixteenth of Nisan, eating the grain of the new crop is prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>You might infer from the above paragraph that the harvest started before the omer was brought. So I see that the Yom Honaif was not the beginning of the harvest. This inference is maintained from the mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Menachot.10.5?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos 10 (5)</a> where you see that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once the omer was offered, they used to go out and find the market of\n  Jerusalem already full of flour and parched grain [of the new\n  produce], [though this was] against the will of the Sages, [these are]\n  the words of Rabbi Meir; Rabbi Judah says: they were acting [in\n  accordance with] the will of the Sages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So you see clearly that the harvest started before the omer was brought  against the will of the Sages.</p>\n\n<p>Bartenura brings that the halacha is like Rabbi Judah.</p>\n\n<p>It is stated clearly <a href=\"http://kabbalistnyc.com/?p=2450&cpage=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to the Mishnah in Menahot, by  the time the Omer sacrifice\n  was brought, the markets of Jerusalem were filled with flour and other\n  products made from the new grain. <strong>Clearly people were involved in</strong>\n  <strong>harvesting and preparing these products before they could be eaten.</strong>\n  Rabbi Meir says that this was done against the wishes of the Sages;\n  Rabbi Yehuda said no objection was raised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My conclusion is that in practice harvest started before the omer was brought and before the Yom Honaif. Therefore the Yom Honaif is not the beginning of the harvest. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mistake first night of Pesach vs Dec 4 on Friday night\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch writes in Siman 19 Halacha 9, that if one began his Shemoneh Esrei on the first night of Pesach and he accidentally began saying a weekday amidah and he came to the Bracha of barech aleinu, that he must complete it and he is to say “vsen Bracha” because the congregation is not saying “tal umatar” - if however December 4/5 fell on a Friday night and once again he said a weekday Shemoneh Esrei, KSA again says “vsen Bracha” because the congregation is not saying “tal umatar” as of yet. \nAren’t these 2 halachos in contradiction with each other, as if with Pesach he holds that the person changes early his recitation to \"vsen Bracha,\" even though the congregation hasn’t changed yet, why not the same on Dec 4-5 that falls on a Friday night - why not change to vsen tal in a similar fashion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My understanding of the Kitzur's ruling is that the default (or 'null' - hat-tip @Double AA) state is to recite <em>v'ten bracha</em>. <em>V'ten tal umatar</em> is a mandated addition to the <em>amidah</em> during a certain season. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/82488/not-saying-vsain-bracha/\">this question and its answer</a> for support for this assertion.)</p>\n\n<p>The season starts the first weekday <em>arvit</em> on or after December 4th/5th (in the Diaspora) and extends until <em>minchah</em> of <em>erev pesach</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if December 4th/5th falls on <em>shabbat</em>, the season does not begin until after <em>shabbat</em>, and one would not add <em>v'ten tal umatar</em> on that <em>shabbat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, at <em>arvit</em> of the first night of <em>pesach</em>, the season is already over, so, again, one would not recite <em>v'ten tal umatar</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I think that the Kitzur's references to the recitation of the <em>tzibbur</em> is his way of ascertaining whether or not one is currently in the <em>v'ten tal umatar</em> season.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The words of the KSA are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טעה במעריב ליל ראשון של פסח והתפלל תפלת שמונה עשרה של חול, ונזכר לאחר שהתחיל ''ברך עלינו'', שהדין הוא שצריך לסיים כל אותה ברכה (כמו שנתבאר לעיל סימן ע''ו), אינו אומר ''טל ומטר'', כיון שגם הציבור אינם אומרים.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Extended paraphrase, following the explanation of the Chochmat Shelomo.

The result is that 3 witnesses signed below the left bill and 1 below the right. And a bill is not valid with less than 2 witnesses</p></li>\n  <li><p>או בהפך שהעד השני היוני הפך כתבו לסדר כתב עברי והתחיל מן הימין אל השמאל כמו שחתם העד עברי הראשון, there is an other possibility of problem. Perhaps the second witness who was Greek did imitate the first who is Israeli. and signed from right to left</p></li>\n  <li><p>והעד עברי השלישי חתם כדרכו מן הימין, and the third witness who was Israeli did not change his habit and signed below the right bill</p></li>\n  <li><p>ונמצאו שלשתן חתומים על הגט הימני הראשון, והעד היוני האחרון לבדו חתם כדרכו על הגט השמאלי. The result is that 3 witnesses signed for the right bill</p></li>\n  <li><p>ומשום דלא ידעינן בהי מינייהו חתימו תלתא ובהי מינייהו לא חתים אלא חד, שניהם פסולין: ‏ and because we don't know which one of the bills has 3 witnesses and which one has one only, both are not valid. Additional explanation: There is a confusion what is the name of the witness and what is the name of the father. Do we don't know on which bill is targeted the name of the witness.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>But if I remember correctly, the comment of <strong>Rashi</strong> the two witnesses, who are Jews who lives in Greece have signed. They also write in Hebrew but their custom is to begin with the name of the father. When people from Israel write Reuven Shimeon son's, people from Greece write Shimeon son's: Reuven. In the bill, there is a place to write the name of the father of the witness,  and a place to write the name of the witness. For instance in France when you fill out a form, you begin by last name and in the second box last name. In America (I see this in internet forns) when you fill out a form, the first box is for first name. In Hebrew we have Bileam Beno Beor that is equivalent to Bileam Ben Beor. Example given, nowadays, in some cases first name and last name may be confusing, Isaac Moses or Moses Isaac, if you don't know the habit of the writer, you don't know what is the first name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Anyway I'm pretty sure that this has not to do with Kilayim.</h3>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is absolutely no problem with writing two such languages.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking maybe you can bring proof from the stones that Moshe rabbeinu wrote the Torah (or mitzvos) on in 70 languages (I think that is the plain meaning of \"languages\" although could be it refers to something else).</p>\n\n<p>I think it was 12 stones (don't know for sure).

Other models involve applying electric currents through a coil, which moves the resistor. These would clearly be a problem whether you left the light on or not, as you’re activating this circuit regardless of how bright the light currently is. </p>\n\n<p>Older switches work by directly adjusting the resistance, with the switch being on a slider; sliding it one way increases the resistance, and sliding it the other way decreases it.

    "content": "# When do you own the food in your farm-share box?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a farm share (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CSA, community-supported agriculture</a>), at the beginning of a season you subscribe to and pay for a share, and then you receive regular deliveries of whatever food those farms produced that's ready.  Some CSAs send out preview email a few days before each box is delivered, telling you what you're getting.</p>\n\n<p>This made me wonder about cases where the box includes <em>chameitz</em> during Pesach.  If you don't own the food until you pick it up, then you could work around problems by having a non-Jewish friend as a partner in the share, and that person takes anything problematic before you touch anything.  On the other hand, if you own the food as soon as the farmers designate it, which seems possible because you paid in advance (you didn't <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/56821/472\">buy on credit</a>), then you'd have a problem.  And because it's a farm share with the uncertainty that provides, I don't know if we can look to cases of ordering specific goods for precedent.  That is, ordering specific <em>chameitz</em> from Amazon might be a different case, because you made a specific order and because if Amazon fails to deliver it you can request a replacement.  With a farm share you're taking your chances; maybe you get a big pile of wheat berries, or maybe the crop had problems and you don't.</p>\n\n<p>When does a subscriber to a seasonal farm share become the owner of the items in one of the deliveries?  What would a customer need to do to avoid the problem of owning <em>chameitz</em> if a share includes any?  </p>\n\n<p>(I'm willing to split off that second question if people think that would be better; I don't know how complicated my question is.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>How different objects are acquired is covered in Kiddushin Chapter 1.  I expect produce to be in the category of property for which there is not corresponding responsibility, assuming you pay for your CSA share with money rather than eg bartering. So it only becomes yours when you move the produce. (See Kiddushin 1:5)</p>\n\n<p>If the CSA share is delivered to your home, there may be kinyan chatzer. That is to say, by being placed on your real estate, it becomes yours at that moment. If you need to pick up the box from a central delivery location or the farm itself, this definitely doesn’t apply.</p>\n\n<p>In theory, if the farmer told someone else “appoint yourself Monica’s agent to acquire this box on her behalf without her knowledge as it is an unqualified good thing for her” then he could and the box becomes yours at that point. This works based on זכאים לאדם שלא בפניו (one can do good for someone without that person’s knowledge).  However, aside from the fact that this is strange to do in this case, it creates responsibility for the farmer.  If the box were subsequently damaged or lost, he would need to replace it.  So I’d put this option as possible but unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>End result: it becomes yours when delivered to you or when you pick it up.</p>\n\n\n",

May I hand them over to the authorities or not? Rabbi Elazar scored parchment and wrote to him the following verse: “I said: I will take heed to my ways, that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me” (Psalms 39:2). Rabbi Elazar quoted this verse to allude to the following response: Even though “the wicked is before me,” “I will keep a curb upon my mouth.”  Mar Ukva sent word to him again: They are tormenting me a great deal and I cannot stand them. Rabbi Elazar sent to him in response: “Resign yourself to the Lord, and wait patiently [hitḥolel] for Him; do not fret yourself because of he who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass” (Psalms 37:7). This verse indicates: “Resign yourself to the Lord,” i.e., do not do anything, and He will strike them down as many corpses [ḥalalim]. Rise before and stay later than them in your visits to the study hall, and they will disappear on their own.

In fact, the Talmud frequently mentions a rabbi's \"wife\", meaning he only had one.</p>\n\n<p>The only instance of rabbinic polygamy in the Talmud [Yevamot Y 4:12] was Rabbi Tarfon, who married 300 women when there was a famine in the land, so they could eat. As a kohen, he received the priestly tithes, which he could share only with wives and children.  However, this was clearly just a legal fiction, intended to allow the women to eat during the famine.  Rabbi Tarfon had only one “real” wife, as the Midrash Rabbah and Talmud Yerushalmi make clear:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the wife of Rabbi Tarfon died, after the grave had been filled in, he said to her sister during mourning, “Marry me and rear your sister's children.”  But although he married her, he did not consummate the marriage until after thirty days. [Ecclesiastes R. 9:8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On festivals and holy days Rabbi Ṭarfon was accustomed to delight his wife and children by preparing for them the finest fruits and dainties [Pesachim Y 37b].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Ariz\"l in his  לקוטי ש\"ס on יבמות seems to suggest that R' Akiva was married to two women at once (see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24864&st=&pgnum=17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">middle of first column</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דע כי ר\"ע הוא דוגמת יעקב אע\"ה ולכן עקיבא אותיות יעקב א' וכשם שיעקב\n  רועה צאן חמיו כן ר\"ע ג\"כ והנה כשם שליעקב הי' ב' נשים כן ר\"ע נשא בת\n  כלבא שבוע ואשת טורנוסרופוס הרשע לב' נשים והנה בת כלבא שבוע היתה כנגד\n  רחל ואשת טורנוסרופוס היתה כנגד לאה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation would be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Know that R' Akiva is in the mold of Yaakov and that is why the\n  letters of Akiva are the same as Yaakov.   And just as Yaakov was the\n  shepherd for his father-in-law, thus R'Akiva.  And just as Yaakov had\n  two wives, so did R' Akiva married the daughter of Kalba Savua and the\n  wife of Tronosofos [as two wives].   The daughter of Kalba Savua was\n  {in place of} Rachel and the wife of Tronosofos was {in place of}\n  Leah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Granted, he doesn't <em>explicitly</em> say that R' Akiva was married to both at the same time, but the Rachel/Leah metaphor does suggest it and the story in the gemara doesn't preclude the possibility.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.1.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 1:4</a> brings a disagreement between Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel about a case that can only happen when a man is married to two wives (and one of those wives is related to his brother, and he dies with no children).</p>\n<p>This is a rare case, but has severe consequences if it does happen.  If the brother does yibum with the wife that's not related to him, following Beis Shammai, her kids will be mamzeirim according to Beis Hillel.  And if she doesn't do chalitza or yibum, following Beis Hillel, she's not allowed to get married according to Beis Shammai.  There are also other permutations where one side or another ends up being more stringent.</p>\n<p>The mishnah concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאֵלּוּ אוֹסְרִין וְאֵלּוּ מַתִּירִין, אֵלּוּ פּוֹסְלִין וְאֵלּוּ מַכְשִׁירִין, לֹא נִמְנְעוּ בֵּית שַׁמַּאי מִלִּשָּׂא נָשִׁים מִבֵּית הִלֵּל, וְלֹא בֵית הִלֵּל מִבֵּית שַׁמַּאי.</p>\n<p>Even though these forbid her to get married and these allow her, these disqualify her and these permit her, Beis Shammai didn't avoid marrying women from Beis Hillel, and Beis Hillel didn't avoid marrying women from Beis Shammai.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like these kinds of cases, despite all the complicated factors that had to be met, actually happened occasionally.  Otherwise there would be no reason for Batei Shammai and Hillel to even consider not marrying each other.  Since it's hard to imagine that these represent more than a few percent of the cases of polygamy at the very most, it seems that polygamy was pretty common among people who were, if not necessarily rabbis, knowledgeable enough to be considered part of Beis Shammai or Beis Hillel (as opposed to amei ha'aretz).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Age of Universe\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the most plausible way to reconcile the traditional dating of the universe (now 5779) with science's understanding that the universe is billions of years old?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I know of a number of approaches to evolution vs creation in Jewish thought. As far as I can tell, it seems that an insistence on the Torah giving literal history with it being roughly 5,769 years since ex nihilo, became more popular after the scientific challenges of the past two centuries, not less. As though we dug in our heels in the face of so many rejecting the Torah for a blind acceptance of the zeitgeist and the importance it gives scientific research.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a list of the approaches I've heard:</p>\n\n<p>1- Rejection of scientific conclusions. Theories change over time. Rather than worry about a contradiction between current theory and the Torah, one can simply wait without concern as science slowly converges to the Torah’s truth.</p>\n\n<p>After all, in the last century theory has gone from Aristotle’s eternal universe to acknowledging that it has a beginning. Compared to that, current difference are small.</p>\n\n<p>This is the basic approach taken by R’ Avigdor Miller.</p>\n\n<p>2- History as a backdrop. As one opinion in the Gemara has it, Adam was created as a fully mature man of 20, and trees were created fully grown, etc… The Lubavitcher Rebbe zt”l concludes that this opinion would hold that the universe as a whole was formed with a history consistent with a natural, scientific, progression.</p>\n\n<p>One may then ask why Hashem chose to create a world that has an artificial age. Or perhaps not: Can one understand why G-d chooses to do anything?</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have adifferent problem with this position. How does one ascribe a time to creation? It can’t be on the Creator’s clock, since He Exists outside of time. Therefor, when we speak of “when” creation happened, we mean the beginning of the universe’s timeline. So then how could we talk about G-d creating the universe at some point in the middle of the line, allowing history to go in both directions — past and future — from that point?</p>\n\n<p>3- Conflict resolution. Invoking relativity or whatnot to show that 15 billion years can be 5758 years in another frame of reference. Perhaps relativity justifies the differences between frames of reference (as suggested by Rabbi Yaakov “Gerald” Shroeder). The “birds” of day 5 are actually dinosaurs, which are most similar biologically to birds of any thing living today. Creation of the sun on day 4 is actually about the sky clearing to the point the sun could be seen on earth, etc…</p>\n\n<p>As can be seen from my treatment, I don’t consider this opinion fair to either the Torah or the scientific data. Yet, many popular books have come out in the past two years promoting this kind of position. Perhaps someone else can do it justice.</p>\n\n<p>[The next two paragraphs are minor paraphrases of material R’ Gil Student wrote for his Hirhurim blog.]</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, however Bereishis 1 is understood, there is a poetry to the idea. In Collected Writings VII pp 363-264, R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch rejects an insistence on literalism, common to both of the previous approaches, and waxes poetic about the greater display of Divine Wisdom a natural unfolding would suggest. Similarly, Rav Kook makes the same point in Orot haQodesh 91.</p>\n\n<p>R. Menahem Kasher, in Torah Shelemah (Bereshis, ch. no. 738), quotes a responsum from the Geonim in which it is stated that Adam was first created as a speechless creature, like an animal, and only later was given speech. This could certainly be interpreted as a precedent for the claim that Adam was descended from humanoids. R. Kasher suggests that this is a matter of dispute between the Ramban and his student R. Bahya ben Asher, with the Ramban on the side of the Gaon’s responsum. In his Hibah Yeseirah (Bereshis 1:26, printed in the back of Bnei Banim vol. 2), R. Henkin writes explicitly that Adam’s body was taken from creatures that preceded him and it was only his soul that was created ex nihilo. In other words, Adam evolved from lower creatures and became human when God created and implanted in him a human soul.</p>\n\n<p>4- Multiple creation times. This is the approach of the Tif’eres Yisrael. He cites an opinion of the tannaim, a central theme amongst the more kabbalistically inclined rishonim, that Hashem created worlds and destroyed them before this one. Dinosaur bones and starlight are legacies of these earlier worlds. The Tif’eres Yisrael did not say anything about evolution, just that this earlier time explains what the fossils are fossils of. In Techeiles Mordechai, R’ Shalom Mordechai Schwadron speaks laudably of the Tif’eres Yisrael’s resolution.</p>\n\n<p>In Gen 1:1, G-d creates ex nihilo (matter from nothing). Then, before verse 2, these other worlds (in this opinion, epochs) rose and fell. Then, there was “chaos and emptiness” from which our world emerged. The universe as a whole, even the planet, can therefor be older than 5758 years.</p>\n\n<p>Since current theory is that the world started as a singularity — IOW, not within the purvey of science, it is all a matter of faith if the ex nihilo was with the intent of the Creator or not.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan quotes R’ Yitzchaq meiAkko (a student of the Ramban) who concludes from the Zohar that the first creation was 15.8 billion years ago — the age astronomers and physicists seemed to be converging on in the 1980s and 1990s, given multiple ways of measuring the age. It is unclear that this is truly the intent of R’ Yitzchaq meiAkko, but that’s Rabbi Kaplan’s take. The original lecture to AOJS, which is more complete and persuasive than the mention in his NCSY book, is available on line. This is built on an idea discussed by Rabbeinu Bachya and numerous other kabbalistically inclined rishonim, that of our world being one of a cycle of shemittos, so that there is history and time before our universe.</p>\n\n<p>5- Rejection of a literal read of the Torah. This is much easier, halachically, than it sounds, as there is a long tradition, including the Rambam and the Vilna Gaon, teaching that Genesis 1&2 actually convey deeper truths via metaphor. The gemara, after all, limits the number of students (to 2) that one may teach the secrets of the Act of Creation — so clearly we can’t just take the text at face value.</p>\n\n<p>Another commonly cited proof for non-literalness is that the word “day” precedes the creation of the sun. Therefor, it can’t be used, at least in this narrative, to mean our 24 hour period.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam takes “day” to mean a stage in the causal chain, not a reference to time altogether. See The Rambam on Time During Creation.)</p>\n\n<p>6-The Maharal (intro to Gevuros Hashem) teaches that creation is so alien to human experience that we don’t have a comparison to it. Therefor prophecy, which is transmitted by visions, can not describe it. (The World to Come is similarly explained. This is why it only appears in Tanach as “your days will be prolonged”. Continued existence we can understand. The rest of the details, no.)</p>\n\n<p>However, creation is also so alien that we can not understand it by extrapolation, either. In general, the Talmud teaches that “wisdom is greater than prophecy”. The Maharal explains that this is because the power of extrapolation and deduction takes you further than just what can be presented metaphorically in visions. In this case, though, creation is beyond wisdom as well — which is why the Talmud limits the forum where it can be studied.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal's conclusion is that the Torah can’t provide us with a comprehensible history AND that science must be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>R’ Dessler (vol. II) ascribes a similar opinion to the Ramban, at least with regard to time during creation. That the days of creation were both literal days of seconds, minutes and hours, but also the subsequence six millenia. Not that they represent or parallel the subsequent millenia, but they are literally the millenia themselves. These two perspectives appear to contradict, but only because of limitations of how humans perceive time ever since eating from the tree of knowledge. (A longer description of Rav Dessler’s opinion can be found at Rav Dessler’s Approach to Creation.)</p>\n\n<p>In the two last opinions, the presumption must be that Genesis 1 and 2 teach some deeper truths about reality. Either because that’s the only meaning of the text, or because all we can understand from the text are partial truths that don’t quite add up to a whole picture. In either case, without having a metaphor, there would be little reason for its inclusion in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal explains some of the symbolism of the number 7 later in Gevuros Hashem. The seventh should be made holy even without the creation story, so it is possible the details of the story are made to describe this point.</p>\n\n<p>One can also see a pattern: light, sky-and-sea, earth; repeated twice. First Hashem created light. On day four, He created the stars, moon and sun — the sources of light. Second, He separated sky from the sea. On day 5, He created those who live in the sky and the sea — the birds and the fish. Third, Hashem made the seas converge to show land. On day six, the animals and people inhabited the land.</p>\n\n<p>What is important to us as Jews is not what actually happened, that is, whether G-d used natural or miraculous means to create the universe. Rather, to take the lessons of creation, or the lessons encoded into the story of creation, and live them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Authenticity of Zohar--Bitul Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As indicated in a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/34269\">prior thread</a> on this site, there is good reason to doubt the authenticity of the Zohar, i.e., that it is attributable to Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai.  </p>\n\n<p>Question: if that is the case, does it logically follow that all those people (including great Rabbis such as the Vilna Gaon) who spent much time studying the Zohar and even writing commentaries on it were engaged in bitul Torah during such time, or at least cannot be said to having been engaged in Talmud Torah?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It seems like this could be comparable to the Braisa that mentions the methodology of Shimon HaAmsuni (can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.22b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pesachim 22b</a>, among other places):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כדתניא שמעון העמסוני ואמרי לה נחמיה העמסוני היה דורש כל אתים שבתורה\n  כיון שהגיע לאת ה׳ אלהיך תירא פירש אמרו לו תלמידיו רבי כל אתים שדרשת מה\n  תהא עליהן אמר להם כשם שקבלתי שכר על הדרישה כך אני מקבל שכר על הפרישה\n  עד שבא רבי עקיבא ודרש את ה׳ אלהיך תירא לרבות תלמידי חכמים </p>\n  \n  <p>As it was taught in a baraita: Shimon HaAmmassoni, and some say that\n  it was Neḥemya HaAmmassoni, would interpret all occurrences of the\n  word et in the Torah, deriving additional halakhot with regard to the\n  particular subject matter. Once he reached the verse: “You shall be in\n  awe of [et] the Lord your God; you shall serve Him; and to Him you\n  shall cleave, and by His name you shall swear” (Deuteronomy 10:20), he\n  withdrew from this method of exposition, as how could one add to God\n  Himself? His students said to him: Rabbi, what will be with all the\n  etim that you interpreted until now? He said to them: Just as I\n  received reward for the interpretation, so I shall receive reward for\n  my withdrawal from using this method of exposition. The word et in\n  this verse was not explained until Rabbi Akiva came and expounded:\n  “You shall be in awe of [et] the Lord your God”: The word et comes to\n  include Torah scholars, and one is commanded to fear them just as one\n  fears God. In any case, Shimon HaAmmassoni no longer derived\n  additional halakhot from the word et.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication from Shimon/Nechemya HaAmsuni's statement (before Rabbi Akiva's addition) seems to say that since the expounding of the word 'Es' was done in good faith*, even though he later concluded that it was all in error, he believed he would still receive reward for learning Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Since presumably the Vilna Gaon and others had a sincere and founded belief that the Zohar is a legitimate Torah work, it follows that they too would be credited as having done Talmud Torah, even if ultimately it ends up that the Zohar is proven to not be a 'legitimate' work.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*I'm taking it as a logical assumption that all parties involved acted in good faith. While it's probably beyond the scope of this answer to define what learning in good faith is, I would guess it's something like the scholars reached their conclusions based on legitimate and accepted methods of determining the proper way to learn.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>No, it doesn't follow logically. At the very least, your syllogism is missing the step \"if it wasn't authentically written by RSBY then it's not Torah\".</p>\n\n\n",

He knew that the plague of blood had ended by itself. He thought that if he said <em>today</em>, the plague would have ended anyway. By saying <em>tomorrow</em> he would be able to claim that Moshe was just a powerful magician and the frogs would disappear immediately, because Moshe would have set up the removal already as soon as he was called to Par'o.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The motive for Moshe making the exit of the plague itself into an אות,\n  and not simply undertaking Pharoah's request, lay in the request\n  itself. Had Pharaoh been already convinced, he would simply have let\n  the people go. But as it was, it was apparent that all he wanted was\n  to be freed from the plague. That is why the departure of the frogs\n  was itself to be a further instructive אות; perhaps this would produce\n  the desired result. Accordingly, the frogs are not simply to go back\n  from where they came, that could be taken as merely the cessation of\n  Hashem's activity and a return to normal conditions. They are to die,\n  but as emphasized repeatedly ביאר תשארנה, not all of them, that could\n  again be taken as some phenomenon of Nature (cf. V9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Mishna Brurah explains that one should not direct a non Jew explicitly on shabbos but rather work it based off a kablanos deal. The non Jew was hired for the whole winter (for weekdays as well) and would make the halacha more flexible to the point that if a non Jew lit a fire with their own doing then a Jew would not have to leave the house, but can indeed benefit from the fire.</p>\n<p>The Mishna brura writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(מה) שאין הקור גדול - ועכ\"פ יזהרו שלא לומר לו בשבת להסיק או לעשות המדורה אלא יקצבו עמו בקבלנות שיסיק לו כל ימות החורף בעת שיהיה קר ואז אף אם הא\"י יסיק כשאין הקור גדול אפשר דהו\"ל כאלו עשה מדעתו וא\"צ לצאת מביתו וכמ\"ש בס\"א וע\"ש במ\"ב סקי\"ג:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Joseph Karo</a> in his commentary to that halacha suggests that based on how Ra'avad is quoted in Sefer HaIkarim the text may not have said \"bigger and better than\" in the first place:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש לתמוה על פה קדוש איך יקרא לאומרים שהוא גוף ובעל תמונה גדולים וטובים ממנו ואפשר שעיקר הנוסחא כמו שכתוב בספר העיקרים פ\"ב ממ\"א וז\"ל א\"א אע\"פ שעיקר האמונה כן הוא המאמין היותו גוף מצד תפיסתו לשונות הפסוקים והמדרשות כפשטן אין ראוי לקרותו מין עכ\"ל וגם לפי נוסחתנו זאת היתה כוונתו וכבר הרחיב הדיבור בזה בעל ספר העיקרים בפרק הנזכר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Several other commentaries state that ממנו does not refer to Rambam, but to the members of our nation. Thus, Ra'avad was not saying that the people with these beliefs were greater than Rambam. For example, R. Meir Soloveitchik in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33034&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his commentary there</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נ\"ב עי' ג\"כ שם דהכוונה במש\"כ טובים ממנו היינו מבני עמינו אבל לא קאי על הרמב\"ם ז\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moishe_Sternbuch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Shternbuch</a> in his commentary there (Haderech L'Teshuvah p. 37) claims that there are manuscripts in which Ra'avad's statement does not contain the word ממנו at all, so again there wouldn't actually be any people greater than Rambam that believed this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם אמת שבמגדל עוז מביא גדולים וטובים ממנו אבל יש בראב\"ד כת\"י מדוייקים דלא גרסי כלל ממנו וא\"ש בפשיטות ואם נגרוס ממנו היינו מאתנו בבית ישראל וכמ\"ש ועיין אור שמח כאן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, all of these resolutions seem to be motivated by the fact that traditional rabbinic authors simply could not conceive that there could be people greater than Rambam that believed in some form of corporeality. Yet that is not necessarily historically accurate from Ra'avad's perspective. Indeed, we know from all of Rambam's writings against corporeality that belief in corporeality was existent, if not pervasive, in Rambam's time. Combined with the fact that a quick perusal of Ra'avad's glosses shows the harsh way he spoke about Rambam in general, it is not so inconceivable that Ra'avad actually believed that (some of) those who believed in corporeality were actually greater than Rambam.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, as I mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/94511/13438\">this answer</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/94341/13438\">this answer</a>, a century or so later, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani_the_Younger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaiah the Younger of Trani</a> explicitly stated that some of the Talmudic Sages believed in corporeality. He even mentions the same reason that Ra'avad mentions – that they understood verses according to their simple literal meaning. It is entirely conceivable that Rambam's contemporaries and near contemporaries would consider Talmudic Sages to be greater than him. Thus, the answer to who are those \"bigger and better than Rambam\" that believed this, may be (some of) the Talmudic Sages.</p>\n\n\n",

Several commentaries I've seen explain that these texts are so important that you need to understand what you're saying.  Yet I know many people who are not fully fluent in Hebrew who, nonetheless, say these in Hebrew, either in deference to tradition or because they are trying to learn the Hebrew and expect to one day understand it.  (This latter group includes <em>baalei t'shuva</em>, converts, and children.)</p>\n\n<p>Are we required to 100% understand the words we're saying in these cases, and some should pray in their local languages rather than Hebrew?

In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sotah.8.5?lang=bi&with=English%20Explanation%20of%20Mishnah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 8:5</a> Rabbi Yose the Galilean says this refers to transgressions he has committed (and so he's afraid of being punished, I think), and Rabbi Yose (different Yose) gives a specific list, all of which are forbidden marriages.  A commentary at Sefaria notes that these are <em>ongoing</em> transgressions (for as long as he remains married), not transgressions committed in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Did <em>any</em> ongoing transgression cause one to be sent home from battle, and Rabbi Yose is just listing examples?  Or is this specifically about forbidden <em>marriages</em>, and other ongoing transgressions (like owning forbidden items) would not disqualify one?  The passage in D'varim (and in this chapter of mishna) exempts one based on a new house, a new vineyard, or a newly betrothed wife, so it might be that only ongoing transgressions involving these things are relevant.  Or it might be that a (forbidden) marriage is more <em>public</em> than those idols you have in your basement, so maybe that's the reason.  Or maybe we say that, as with <em>mitzvot</em>, we do not know which are more important and so any ongoing transgression would send somebody home, ideally so he can correct the problem, and these are just examples.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The sins are not enumerated, not by RYHG and not by RY.

According to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, one who has violated a rabbinic law <strong>returns home</strong>, whereas Rabbi <strong>Yosei maintains</strong> that one returns home <strong>only</strong> if he has violated a <strong>Torah law</strong>, as in the case of a priest who has married a divorcée. The Gemara asks: In accordance with whose opinion is that which is taught in a baraita: <strong>If one spoke between donning the phylactery of the arm and the phylactery of the head, he has a sin on his hands, and due to that sin he returns from the ranks of soldiers waging war</strong>.

During this time the knives could have been passed around also - and even checked for blemishes.</p>\n<p>There were also enough bowls in the Mikdash that everybody could pour in the Eimurim that were eventually burnt on the Mizbeach, as well as supplying the poles (and some hooks) for everybody to skin their animals. But for some reason, everybody had to bring their own knife. Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As a practical matter each group had to bring a valid shechitah knife so that they could shecht the korban pesach on time. The knives at the bais hamikdash, besides not being enough for everyone, would have had to have been inspected before each shechitah. If people had not brought their own knives, many would not have been able to get the slaughtering done in time.</p>\n<p>The description of the procedure shows that there were too many people to allow the knives of the temple to be used. The Jewish Encyclopedia <a href=\"http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11934-passover-sacrifice\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Passover Sacrifice</a> shows how this was done.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The animal was slain on the eve of the Passover, on the afternoon of\nthe 14th of Nisan, after the Tamid sacrifice had been killed, i.e., at\nthree o'clock, or, in case the eve of the Passover fell on Friday, at\ntwo. The killing took place in the court of the Temple, and might be\nperformed by a layman, although the blood had to be caught by a\npriest, and rows of priests with gold or silver cups in their hands\nstood in line from the Temple court to the altar, where the blood was\nsprinkled. These cups were rounded on the bottom, so that they could\nnot be set down; for in that case the blood might coagulate. The\npriest who caught the blood as it dropped from the victim then handed\nthe cup to the priest next to him, receiving from him an empty one,\nand the full cup was passed along the line until it reached the last\npriest, who sprinkled its contents on the altar.</p>\n<p>The people taking part in the sacrifice were divided into three\ngroups. The first of these filled the court of the Temple, so that the\ngates had to be closed, and while they were killing and offering their\npaschal lambs the Levites on the platform (\"dukan\") recited the\n\"Hallel\" (Ps. cxiii.-cxviii.), accompanied by instruments of brass. If\nthe Levites finished their recitation before the priests had completed\nthe sacrifice, they repeated the \"Hallel,\" although it never happened\nthat they had to repeat it twice. As soon as the first group had\noffered their sacrifice, the gates were opened to let them out, and\ntheir places were taken by the second and third groups successively.\nAll three groups offered their sacrifice in the manner described,\nwhile the \"Hallel\" was recited; but the third group was so small that\nit had always finished before the Levites reached Ps. cxvi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Building on the previous answer, there were a lot of knives needed and not a lot of time available. As the question goes on to ask, we see that the mikdash had the resources to provide everyone with bowls, poles, cups, and so on to do the other steps, so why not knives?</p>\n<p>Well, to start with, bowels, poles, and cups are reusable, while knives are not until they are checked. This theoretically could have been done between animals, but it requires an expert, who are themselves around only in limited numbers, and running the knife blade over one's fingernail, a dangerous operation in crowded and hurried conditions. Proper checking of the knife also requires concentration, which at that time is too much to ask from the perspective checker.</p>\n<p>By requiring everyone to bring their own knife, the checking process can be drawn out (pun intended) over the days leading up to the Pesach slaughtering, done by certified experts who have space and enough time to do a proper job. (Also giving time to sharpen a knife that has a blemish.)</p>\n<p>I would add that the knife does not have to be a sanctified vessel (kli sharres) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sacrificial_Procedure.4.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Maase haKarbanos 4:7</a>), while the cups to catch the blood must be (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sacrifices_Rendered_Unfit.1.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pisulei haMukdashim 1:24</a>). So this instance is different than at least that one other that there is a possibility to bring one's own knife. I don't know of any reason why they couldn't bring their own bowls and poles, but at the same time who is to say that people wouldn't bring their own (when it wasn't Shabbos)?</p>\n\n\n",

Akiva, do we compel the person to avoid sinning (not eat <em>t'ruma</em>, pay the money), or do we merely advise him to in order to avoid sinning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think that Rabbi Akiva says that if we follow the way of Rabbi Tarfon there is an avera anyways, mima nafshach.</p>\n<p><strong>If the husband died:</strong></p>\n<p>The first wife will marry without sin.</p>\n<p>The second wife eats teruma by sin.</p>\n<p><strong>If the husband is alive:</strong></p>\n<p>The first wife marry by sin,</p>\n<p>The second wife eats teruma with sin.</p>\n<p>So, the criticism of Rabbi Akiva is that the solution of Rabbi Tarfon leads to an unavoidable sin. And to take the responsibility to lead to a sin is not acceptable for RA. Not that if Rabbi Tarfon didn't say his rule, they will not make any Avera.</p>\n<p>See Tosfot 118a, Tosfot has a tendency to understand that the Mishna told about teruma derabanan because it seems to him strange that rabbi Tarfon would allow Avera deorayta mima nafshach. By this Tosfot I want just to illustrate that for Rabbi Tarfon himself Tosfot cannot easily understand his solution if it leads to an avera of Tora mima nafshach.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בת ישראל לכהן תאכל בתרומה. מספקא לר\"י אי דוקא בתרומה דרבנן אי נמי בתרומה דאורייתא דאוקמה אחזקה דדייקא ומינסבא ועל צרתה אין להאמינה ואוקמה אחזקת אשת איש מידי דהוה אשני שבילין. מיהו איכא הכא חדא דעביד איסורא ממ\"נ ובכי האי גוונא לא ילפינן מסוטה כדמשמע בריש מסכת נדה (דף ב: ושם) ובמס' חולין (דף ט: ושם): ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar case is in Shevuot 7.5 when Ben Nanas says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר בן ננס, אלו ואלו באים לידי שבועת שוא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the second part of the Mishna (cases 3 and 4) regarding paying procedures (money), the statement of Rabbi Akiva has an other context. First a man did a sin (he was not carful enough) and want to repair it, to go away from his sin. Rabbi Akiva is stringent and give his way to be sure he repaired his sin. It's a different svaraת for this second part, we rules as Rabbi Akiva, for the first part, we rule as Rabbi Tarfon, there are two distinct machloktot, two distinct topics. But Rabbi Akiva says that we cannot say him that this way is for him the way of atonement.</p>\n<p>According to Rabbi Tarfon, people will follow his rule. You cannot say a rule and advise to avoid this way because of the risk. The aim of the halacha is to help the first wife to marry and the second to eat. He makes in his mind the maximum of Takana. According to Rabbi Akiva, there is a din Derabanan, a Seyag, that warrants that it will not be avera, for the first Mishna, or that the timing will be entire.</p>\n\n\n",

Is this self-imposed stricture similar to the vow a Nazir takes?

On the first day, he says, \"Today is one day in the Omer,\" [and so on] until he reaches seven days, and then he says, \"Today is seven days, which are one week in the Omer.\" On the eighth day, he says, \"Today is eight days, which are one week and one day in the Omer.\" Likewise until he reaches fourteen, [when] he says, \"Today is fourteen days, which are two weeks in the Omer.\" In this manner he counts and continues until forty-nine days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why do we counts using cardinal numbers, \"Today is <em>seven days</em>,\" \"Today is <em>eight days</em>,\" \"Today is <em>fourteen days</em>\"? Why not count with ordinal numbers, \"Today is the seventh day, which concludes one week of the Omer,\" \"Today is the eighth day, which concludes one week and one day of the Omer\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I saw a nice answer in a sefer named Maadanei Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it that we celebrate Shuvuos on the 6th of Sivan, and call it <em>Zeman Matan Toraseinu</em> -- the time of the giving of our Torah, when the Torah was actually given on the 7th?</p>\n\n<p>Also, why is the Torah ambiguous about how many days to count? Quoting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.15-16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayiqra 23:15-16</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּסְפַרְתֶּ֤ם לָכֶם֙ מִמָּחֳרַ֣ת הַשַּׁבָּ֔ת מִיּוֹם֙ הֲבִ֣יאֲכֶ֔ם אֶת־עֹ֖מֶר הַתְּנוּפָ֑ה <strong>שֶׁ֥בַע שַׁבָּת֖וֹת תְּמִימֹ֥ת תִּהְיֶֽינָה</strong>׃\n  עַ֣ד מִֽמָּחֳרַ֤ת הַשַּׁבָּת֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔ת <strong>תִּסְפְּר֖וּ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים י֑וֹם</strong> וְהִקְרַבְתֶּ֛ם מִנְחָ֥ה חֲדָשָׁ֖ה לַה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And from the day on which you bring the sheaf of elevation offering — the day after the day of rest — <strong>you shall count off seven weeks</strong>; they must be complete.\n  You must count until the day after the seventh week — <strong>fifty days</strong>; then you shall bring an offering of new grain to Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are we counting 7 weeks = 49 days, or 50 days? And while one might be tempted to say that Shavuos \"the day after the seventh week\" is the 50th day, what the verse actually says is to count 50 days until the day after the seventh week -- the weeks we were just talking about when we said 49. Not including it.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is that we're counting from day 0. For us, day 0 is the first day of Pesach. On the second day of Pesach we say \"This is one day in/toward the omer\" -- it's a day since day 0. And we would be bringing the qorban omer to mark the completion of 1 day, thus we count the time completed.</p>\n\n<p>However, on the original Pesach, day 0 didn't begin at nightfall. The actual Exodus was during the day. And since omer has to count complete days and weeks, that meant their day 0 was on the second day of Pesach. They counted 49 days from that time, and thereby reached the 7th, not the 6th of Sivan.</p>\n\n<p>So, we count a duration of 49 days, but because there is a 0th day, the last day of our count is a 50th day. Thus, both verses are fulfilled. </p>\n\n<p>And the answer to your question boils down to -- because that's what the Torah says.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ויקרא כג, טז</a></strong>:  עַ֣ד מִֽמׇּחֳרַ֤ת הַשַּׁבָּת֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔ת תִּסְפְּר֖וּ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים י֑וֹם וְהִקְרַבְתֶּ֛ם מִנְחָ֥ה חֲדָשָׁ֖ה לַיהֹוָֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We need to count 50 days (a quantity, a count) :one,  two, three...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why would one who redeems someone else's firstborn donkey be able to keep it, if he's effectively forcing the owner into a sale?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bekhorot.11a.11-13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechoros 11a</a> rules that one may redeem someone else's firstborn donkey on their behalf. The Gemara asks: If someone were to do this, who gets to keep the donkey?</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's a dispute between R' Yehudah and R' Shimon regarding whether one may derive benefit from a firstborn donkey before it's been redeemed. According to R' Shimon, who says that one may derive benefit from it, the question is invalid: the donkey is the property of its owner, and redeeming it onto a sheep does not change this. The question is according to R' Yehudah, that one may not benefit from a firstborn donkey before it's been redeemed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>להקדש מדמי ליה ורחמנא אמר ונתן הכסף וקם לו או דלמא כיון דקני להו בביני וביני לא דמי להקדש</p>\n  \n  <p>Is it compared to Hekdesh, and the Torah says, \"He will give the money and it will be to him,\" [i.e. to the one who redeems it]? Or maybe since he [the original owner] owns the difference [as one can redeem onto a sheep of lesser value than the donkey], it's not similar to Hekdesh?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara ultimately concludes like the latter approach; however, I'd like to try to understand the former approach.</p>\n\n<p>If Shimon is able to redeem and take Reuven's donkey, effectively he's forcing Reuven into a transaction which he may not have wanted. This would seem to be a clear violation of Lo Sachmod (cf. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.5b.19-20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzi'a 5b</a>). How could the Gemara possibly entertain that the one who redeems the donkey gets to keep it, if he's violating a Torah prohibition in the process?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the \"former\" approach you seek to clarify, the Gemara thought that since R' Yehudah forbids the owner of a first-born donkey to benefit from its work, then that is a clear Halachic sign that the \"owner\" is not the owner at all. (The owner is still Hashem.)</p>\n\n<p>The Torah's prohibition makes us understand that the moment the donkey is born it is in a state of \"hekdesh\" and is not the property of the owner. </p>\n\n<p>So if the owner redeems it, then it becomes his for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if someone else redeems it from its \"hekdesh\" sanctity state, then why shouldn't that person earn the donkey?</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara then concludes that even according to R' Yehudah, the donkey is actually the owner's property from birth , but is merely restricted in use until a redemption takes place.</p>\n\n<p>This is proven by the ruling attributed to R' Yehudah which says that someone who steals the donkey before its redemption, pays double. This proves it was always the owner's property; as one is never obligated in paying double if they stole from \"hekdesh\".</p>\n\n<p>The reason this is not a \"forced sale\" like the case in Bava Metziah, is because there someone was watching over someone else's property as a deposit, and \"paid\" for it (without permission) and kept it. But, The deposit was always owned by the depositor.</p>\n\n<p>Here, the case in theory was that the donkey was never owned by anyone. So why can't anyone off the street redeem it and keep it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>IOW, You cannot be guilty of forcing Shimon to sell you \"his\" donkey, if Shimon never owned the donkey in the first place!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe Rashi understands it this way.</p>\n\n<p>See also, Birkas Shmuel , (Bava Kamma 34: 3,4) who explains it this way.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shoteh in the gemara\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in many places including Berachot 15b talks about a shoteh(imbecile). What type(characteristics)of people does the gemara refer to as \"Shoteh\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Chagiga 3b is the main place in Talmud. This text does not easy lead to clear conclusions. But this is the main source. in psychiatry today perhaps those symptoms are included in the term \"disorganized behavior\".  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Sages taught: Who is considered an imbecile (who has no duty to fulfill mitsvot, has no punishment, who cannot make valid acquirement or monetary transactions, Rashi)? One who <strong>goes out alone at night, and one who sleeps in a cemetery (at night, Rashi), and one who rends his garment</strong>. It was stated that <strong>Rav Huna</strong> said: One does not have the halakhic status of an imbecile until there are <strong>all of these signs</strong> present in him at the same time. <strong>Rabbi Yoḥanan</strong> said: He is considered an imbecile even due to the appearance of <strong>one of these signs</strong>. The Gemara asks: What are the circumstances of the case under discussion? If he performs them in a deranged manner, then even the appearance of one sign should be enough to classify him as an imbecile. If he does not perform these actions in a deranged manner, but has a reason to act this way, then even if he performs all of them he should not be deemed an imbecile. The Gemara answers: Actually, the baraita is referring to one who performs these actions in a deranged manner, but each action on its own could be explained rationally. With regard to one who sleeps in the cemetery, one could say that he is doing so in order that an impure spirit should settle upon him (to make witchcraft, Rashi). Although it is inappropriate to do this, as there is a reason for this behavior it is not a sign of madness. And with regard to one who goes out alone at night, one could say that perhaps a fever took hold of him and he is trying to cool himself down (this is the second interpretation of Rashi, the first was a mental disorder that occur because of anxiety). And as for one who tears his garments, one could say that he is a man engaged in thought, and out of anxiety he tears his clothing unintentionally. Despite these possible explanations, since one performed all of these together they are considered like the actions of a forewarned ox that gored an ox, a donkey, and a camel. Since this ox gored three different animals on three separate occasions, it is considered predisposed to gore and becomes forewarned for every type of animal. Likewise, if someone performs three different deranged actions, it is assumed that there is no logical reason for his behavior and he is classified as an imbecile. Rav Pappa said: If Rav Huna had heard that which is taught in a baraita: Who is an imbecile? This is one <strong>who destroys whatever is given to him</strong> (one type of action is sufficient, Rashi), he would have retracted his statement that one is an imbecile only if he performs three deranged actions. A dilemma was raised before the Sages with regard to Rav Pappa’s statement: When Rav Pappa claims that Rav Huna would have retracted his statement, would he have retracted only from the case of one who tears his garments, as this person is similar to one who destroys whatever is given to him? Or perhaps he would have retracted his opinion with regard to all of the signs of an imbecile? The Gemara states that the dilemma shall stand unresolved, as no answer was found.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If it were dealing with teruma prohibited from the Torah (de'orayta), it would not be permitted to assume the teruma fell into teruma.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>However, it seems that this Mishna is necessarily dealing with teruma de'orayta. The Tosefta (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Terumot.6.10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">6:10</a>) quotes the same law in the name of Rabbi Yosi. Rabbi Yosi holds teruma is forbidden from the Torah at all times (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.82b\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamot 82b</a>).</sub></p>\n<p><sub>Furthermore, the Peney Moshe (Mar'e Happanim 7:3 ד\"ה רבי שמעון בן לקיש) says that the Tosafot Yom Tov misunderstood the Rambam, which was his source for saying this case is teruma derabbanan. The Rambam only meant to say it about the case of two things falling into two boxes, not one thing falling into two boxes. That would mean the Rambam takes the case of this Mishnah to be from the Torah.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>In fact, it is Rabbi Yochanan (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40742&st=&pgnum=75\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yerushalmi 7:3</a>), who is the one holds that teruma is still forbidden from the Torah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.81a.9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamot 81a</a>), who says that we are dealing with a case where there isn't a majority of chullin to nullify the teruma, which doesn't allow us to use the proportion of the mixture as a way to make the case permitted from the Torah (according to which there needs to be a majority of chullin).\n</sub></p>\n<p><sub>Possible starting point: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.82b.6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamot 82b</a> defends Rabbi Yochanan (in a slightly different case) by saying that this concept (\"שאני אומר\") is different, but it doesn't explain the logic why it should be different.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>This question might also apply to Rabbi Eli'ezer's opinion (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Terumot.5.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Terumot 5:2-6</a>), but there are differences: the concept of safek is less prominent there, his opinion has both lenient and strict ramifications, and the sages disagree with him.</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>The answer is Chezkat Chulin (permitted) + Safek if something fell there, lead to permit even for An Isur Deorayta.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara Yebamot says regarding a berayta similar to our Mishna, that the Kula שאני אומר (because I assume that) </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>is because of a <strong>Rov</strong> Chulin (> 50%, not > 100/1). Even if the Teruma falls on the chulin, it's batel berov deorayta. this is <strong>Resh Lakish</strong> opinion (Resh Lakish rules that Teruma nowedays is Derabana, but I am not convinced that he cannot explain the Berayta even with Teruma Deorayta, see Maharsha. The Gemara seems to say that he doesn't make difference between Teruma Deorayta or derabanan the words of the Gemara are \"בדרבנו <strong>נמי</strong> ריבויא הוא דבעינן\" )<sup>(1)</sup>. </p></li>\n<li><p>Or because the Berayta opinion is that teruma bizman Haze derabanan (aliba derabanan derabbi Yose), there is not Isur deorayta anyways, the safek Isur is enough, this allow us to make as if the Teruma falls on the Teruma.This is <strong>Rabbi Yochanan</strong> opinion. (and there is a side in Gemara that Isur derabanan even without שאני אומר  and without Rov is annuled. I am not able to explain it now).</p></li>\n<li><p>For the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan, the last explanation, probably the conclusion, of the Gemara is that we need no rov because it is only a safek if the Teruma falls on the Chulin. The permission is the Result of שאני אומר only. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yose rules that Teruma nowadays is Deorayta (for wine and cereals), Rashi says (Yevamot 81a) that for other species, it's Deorayta with stringencies of the Teruma Deorayta. And Rabbi Yochanan rules as Rabbi Yose (Yevamot Gemara and Rashi 81a, 82b).</p>\n\n<p>The Tosfot on Yevamot 82a, paragraph \"Shte Kupot\" asks: Why Resh lakish didn't ask to Rabbi Yochanan, if Teruma nowadays is Deorayta, why the Mishna allows the Kupa of Chulin, there is a Safek Isur Deorayta. And he answers (the statement begins by ואפשר), that for Rabbi Yochanan there is no Kushia because Resh Lakish himself agrees with Teruma Deorayta with Rob doesn't prohibit the Kupa of Chulin if there is a doubt if the truma fell there because of the Chezkat Chulin. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47914&st=&pgnum=363&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfot Yeshanim from manuscript</a> explains this very clearly</strong>. In our Mishna,even if we interpret it without Rov, with Teruma Deorayta, there is no problem to understand the leniency. The reason is that perhaps nothing fell in the Kupa of Chulin and there is Chezkat Chulin. It's not the same for the Berayta in Yevamot, because איתחזק נפילה in the Kupa of chulin. </p>\n\n<p>I think that the Tosfot Yeshanim gives clearly the reasoning to answer your question: safek if something fell in the Chulin + Chezkat Chulin => Mutar. See Rabbi Shimeon Shkop Shaare Yosher shaar 2 chapter 11 about the Tosfot Yevamot.</p>\n\n<p>The Tosfot Yom Tov and Tiferet Israel you cited follow the way of the Rashba in Torat Habayit Bayt 4Shaar 2. He says that no one will permit even in the case of our Mishna without Rov for a prohibition Deorayta. The Tur YD 111 and the SA 111.3 stated as the Rashba for an Isur Deorayta.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(1): This sugia is treated in Torat Habayt Haaroch Bait 4 shaar 2. He says that despite that generally Safek derabanan Lakula, Resh Lakish holds that the doubt here is more than a simple doubt if something fell because we know that the isur fell elsewhere. See Raavad who rules as the Rashba in Sefer Katuv Sham on the Baal Hamaor about Gemara Pesachim 9a-b-10a. (אפילו שני עכברים ושני בתים כיון דאיכא ביאת עכבר בתרוויהו ואיכא חמץ בחד מינייהו כמי שהוחזק שם חמץ הוי) and Baal Hamaaor as the Tosfot Yeshanim.</p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.11a.14?lang=bi&with=Mishneh%20Torah,%20Marriage&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 11a</a>- \"So that she will not be inconsequential in his eyes, enabling him to easily divorce her\")</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I heard a fascinating explanation. </p>\n\n<p>You could ask an even better question: Both R' Akiva and Hillel were champions of the \"Love your neighbor - don't do unto other\" weltanschauung. How could they possibly allow one to divorce one's wife for \"nonsense\"?</p>\n\n<p>The answer given is that by codifying that one may divorce a wife for  \"nonsense\", it essentially protects her.</p>\n\n<p>The other opinion (of Bet Shammai - which you didn't quote) says that you can't divorce unless she indulges in inappropriate behavior. Thus if a woman gets a divorce she is automatically branded as a loose woman; who would want to marry her, now?</p>\n\n<p>Come along the opinions you state and say \"you can divorce for any old reason\" - so if a woman gets divorced there's no reason to suspect she was sleeping around. Maybe she didn't cook to her ex's liking. Thus she isn't automatically excluded from <em>the Shidduch scene</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you prevent \"divorces for shallow reasons\"? You institute a Kethuba; this makes the husband think twice before divorcing her. If he still decides he's better off without her then (1) she doesn't get a bad name and (2) she is probably better off not being married to him.</p>\n\n<p><sup>(Keep in mind that it's not rocket science to <em>frame</em> your wife for inappropriate behavior, or to pay off some bum to actually have an affair with her, if you would pasken like Bet Shammai. So this solution is much better for her.)</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I once heard an explanation (I don't remember the source): If he considers the fact that she burnt the food an issue in their relationship, it is a strong indicator that their relationship is almost worthless, and warrants divorce. If finding somebody else prettier is an issue for him, then it is a sign that something is missing in his relationship.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, these scenarios are not reasons for divorce, but indicators that the relationship is a shallow, hollow shell of what marriage should be.</p>\n\n\n",

I just hate oily popcorn odors :-)</p>\n\n<p>The dinonline article has a link to a more extensive PDF that explains the source of the music abstention minhag and explains the various lenient and stringent opinions.</p>\n\n<p>In brief, though, if you follow dinonline's leniency, then it negates your assumption and, hence its extension. If you can watch movies in the cinema, then you can watch it privately, assuming that the video has just background music and is not a music video - based on the analogy. However, you should read the PDF, as it has a separate discussion about whether you may listen to non-live music.</p>\n\n\n",

It then progressed to two light sources (a lack of oneness and the appearance of separate entities) and then the creation of the concepts of <em>Greater</em> and <em>Lesser</em>. The process of creation involved concealing G-d's unity (<em>Hester Panim</em>), His oneness, in greater and greater degrees.</p>\n\n<p>The converse of this is the revelation that G-d is <strong><em>truly one</em></strong>, meaning everywhere, in everything, constantly (המחדש בטובו בכל יום תמיד מעשה בראשית) and that there is <em>no other</em> (אין עוד מלבדו), in truth.</p>\n\n<p>This oneness is revealed in greater and greater stages starting on the level of intellect (how Moshiach teaches all Israel and all the nations) and then proceding to that which transcends intellect, what is described as Vision (prophecy). The final and highest level, which transcends even that of prophecy, is the revelation which comes via the aspect of G-d's Kingship (מלכות) which is transmitted to the world via Melech HaMoshiach. Like is expressed with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֲדון עולָם <strong>אֲשֶׁר מָלַךְ. בְּטֶרֶם כָּל יְצִיר נִבְרָא</strong>:\n  לְעֵת נַעֲשה בְחֶפְצו כּל. אֲזַי מֶלֶךְ שְׁמו נִקְרָא:\n  <strong>וְאַחֲרֵי כִּכְלות הַכּל. לְבַדּו יִמְלךְ נורָא</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This previous paragraph, including the answer to how we should prepare for all this now is the subject of the Chassidic discourse from the Lubavitcher Rebbe for Acharon shel Pesach in the year 5725 as found in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58872&st=&pgnum=194\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">volume 43 of Torah Menachem Hitvadiyut, pages 185-194</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Ramchal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Da%27at_Tevunoth.66?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Das Tevunos</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה שעתה בעבור רוב הסתר הפנים נפסדו הדיעות ונתקלקלו כל המעשים, ומזה נמשך גם כן בבריות עצמם הקלקול והפסדות, כענין שאמרו (סוטה מח ע\"א), \"ניטל טעם הפירות\" וכו', וכל שאר הדברים הרעים שספרו לנו רז\"ל, ואשר רואים אנחנו בעינינו - הארץ והנה תהו ובהו, וכמאמרם ז\"ל (סוטה מט ע\"ב), \"חוצפא יסגא ויוקר יאמיר\" וכו', שכל זה הוא תגבורת הרע הגדול, הנה כאשר יגלה כבוד ה' - ישובו כל הדיעות לדרך הישרה, וכל המעשים יהיו מתוקנים כראש, ויהיו בני האדם מתדבקים בקונם, כמו שאמר הכתוב (יואל ג, א), \"אשפוך את רוחי על כל בשר\" וגו'; וכן (ירמיהו לא, לג), \"ולא ילמדו עוד איש את רעהו וגו' לאמר דעו את ה', כי כלם ידעו אותי למקטנם ועד גדולם\"; ותהיה התשוקה הכללית לכל העולם להתקדש בקדושתו ית', כענין שנאמר (ישעיהו ב, ג), \"והלכו עמים רבים ואמרו לכו ונעלה אל הר ה' וגו' ויורנו מדרכיו ונלכה באורחתיו\" וגו'. ויולד מזה הצלחות הבריות כולם, כענין שנאמר (תהלים עב, טז), \"יהי פסת בר בארץ בראש הרים\"; (ישעיהו יא, ו), \"וגר זאב עם כבש\" וגו':</p>\n<p>And that which is now because of the significant concealment of His countenance, wisdom has been diminished and actions have been damaged, and as s consequence to this all of the creations themselves have been damaged and diminished, as they said (Sotah 48a), \"...the taste of the fruit has been taken...\", and all the the other negative things that our Rabbis may their memory be blessed have told us, and which we see with our own eyes - behold the land is chaos, and like their saying may they be blessed (Sotah 49b), [in the time before Mashiach], brazenness will increase and prices will increase...\", for all of this is the strengthening of great negativity, behold when the glory of haShem will be revealed - all wisdom will return to the straight path, and all actions will be restored as at the beginning, and people will cleave to their creator, as it says in the text (Joel 3:1) \"I shall pour out my spirit on all flesh...\"; and similarly (Jeremiah 31:33), \"And man will no longer teach is fellow...to say know haShem, for all will know me from the small among them to the great\"; and it will be that the general passion for the whole world will be to made holy with His holiness may He be blessed, and like the matter that says (Isaiah 2:3), \" And the many peoples will travel and say let ups go and ascend to the mount of HaShem...and he will instruct us in his path and we will follow after him...\". And born from this will be all the successes of the creations, as the matter that is said (Psalms 72:16), \"Let abundant grain be in the land on the tops of the mountains....\"; (Isaiah 11:6) \"and the wolf will dwell with the lamb...\":</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem that in general there will be two differences. 1) People will want to know about Hashem, even if they don't themselves receive prophecy. 2) The world will be \"successful\" physically, the crops will grow well and the wild animals will not attack, etc. (No disease, וכן יהי רצון בקרוב ממש.)</p>\n\n\n",

Even if later, he hears that he is Jewish and saw Jews and their faith, he is still considered as one who was compelled against observance, for he was raised according to their mistaken path.

See Rama YD 120 seif 5,Biur HaGra 15,and Aruch Hashulchan 32.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that a wine stopper would not require <em>tevila</em> since it is not the norm for wine to touch the stopper.

So says Sefer Tevilas Keilim 11:63 that a cover which is a shomer over the food would not need tevilah. </p>\n\n<p>However ,in Sefer Ohalei Yeshurun pg.45:68 notes that according to Rav Moshe one should be <em>tovel</em> covers of storage utensils without a bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Text: <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ze9uG.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ze9uG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Short answer: <strong>Likely yes.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>General Rule:</p>\n\n<h2>Any utensil that comes in direct contact with food requires tevila.</h2>\n\n<p>Main Exceptions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Items that are completely made out of unglazed earthenware, wood, or plastic.</li>\n<li>Disposable items.</li>\n<li>Utensils that were never owned by a non-jew.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Assuming it is not covered by any of the exceptions, whether or not it needs to be toiveled with a bracha depends on a few different factors.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Vessels only used for the storage of food are toiveled without a bracha.

However, I would argue (see comments) that such a stopper is definitely meant to be touched by the liquid. Wine bottles are often stored on their side, and just from moving a bottle around wine often splashes into the cork. Therefore, that should not prevent it from requiring tevila.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary, unless your wine stopper falls into one of the exceptions, it would need tevila. Whether or not it needs a bracha depends on the design and material (if it <em>actually</em> pours wine, a bracha is required) I don't think it wouldn't need tevila because you might say the cover doesn't touch the wine, but as always, CYLOR.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.kashrut.com/articles/tevilas_keilim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kashrut.com</a> (Reviewed by Rav Belsky zt\"l)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why Kaddish starts after burial and not death?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I know, all Avelus starts with the burial, not with the actual death. </p>\n\n<p>Particularly, why saying Kaddish does not start with the moment of death? And is it just a general Minhag or there are some secret matters?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Well, since Kadish is said by <em>the mourners</em>, and they are exempt from davening, they won't be in shul to say Kadish, and may not even be allowed to say it (same way they cannot daven or bentsch.)</p>\n\n<p>That said, at a funeral the Kadish is already said, before the burial.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if one has given up hope of finding somebody presumed dead (e.g. they drowned and were never located) then one can usually say Kadish for them, even though there was no burial. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.204.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 204:4</a> for details.</p>\n\n<p>Also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.204.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid 204:3</a> we see that one can start all Shiva procedures before the burial, when the burial is <em>out of town</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We also see from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.196.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur 196:9</a> that Kaddish can be said on Shabbat if the burial is delayed until after Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>So, it seems - like I already postulated - that the mourners usually don't say Kaddish before the burial because they are not allowed to be doing any positive Mitzvos; their full-time Mitzva is to deal with the burial.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Who exactly is qualified to say so and so has just experienced \"the moment of death\"? </p>\n\n<p>Nobody, in good conscience, can testify to something he or she is unsure of; therefore, the waiting period (even if less than 24 hours) before the burial is a way to be certain that one is not wrong on the issue. </p>\n\n<p>Isn't that simply a practicality, that Kaddish is not mentioned at the moment of death but at/after/with burial? </p>\n\n<p>Therefore it has become \"easier\" to diagnose somebody as dead at/after/with burial rather than at the moment of perceived death?</p>\n\n<p>In secular first world countries, like Great Britain, for example, \"there is no legal definition of death\" (<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-19968625\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">www.bbc.com/news/health-19968625</a>). There are only \"guidelines for the diagnosis\", which therefore opens the door for a misdiagnosis, which is ripe in second and third world countries. </p>\n\n<p>Doesn't even the Torah (for example Devarim 31:16) uses the verb to sleep/lie-down when somebody dies because by sight, before burial, death and sleep look the same?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Devarim 31:16 And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Behold, thou art about to\n  sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go astray\n  after the foreign gods of the land, whither they go to be among them,\n  and will forsake Me, and break My covenant which I have made with\n  them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Is this halachically permissible?</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of the problems and confusion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One should not eat prior to hearing Kiddush</li>\n<li>Kiddush must be made in a <em>makom se'udah</em> (place where you will have the meal)</li>\n<li>The shul is not where people will be eating. It's in a different room.</li>\n<li>My understanding of the term \"se'udah\" is that it requires a bracha of \"hamotzi\". In most cases, bread is not served at the Kiddush. However, it seems that people eat a sufficient amount of cake that it may require washing and \"hamotzi\", though, I haven't seen people following this rule.</li>\n<li>Based on the last item, perhaps, there is no \"makom se'udah\" involved here.

He concludes that if you can see the other room, then in all circumstances it's fine, so long as you had in mind to eat there.</p>\n\n<p>My guess has always been that in certain shuls the Rabbi is concerned that once people reach the kiddush room they will start eating right away, before hearing kiddush. That, or they won't hear the kiddush as everyone will be talking. They therefore feel compelled to make kiddush in the shul, where (hopefully) everyone is paying attention and can more easily hear.</p>\n\n<p><em>Kiddush bemakom seudah</em> is satisfied with <em>mezonos</em>, such as cake (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.273.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 273:5</a> with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.273.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham</a>), which most shul <em>kiddushes</em> provide.</p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Menachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we look at <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=754\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Birkat Kohanim 15:12</a> we see that Rambam mentions the number of <em>mitzvot</em> violated there as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any priest who does not ascend to the duchan - even though he neglects [the performance] of [only] one commandment - is considered as if he violated three positive commandments, as [Numbers 6:23-27] states: \"This is how you shall bless the children of Israel,\" \"Say to them,\" \"And you shall set My name...\" (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/920180/jewish/Tefilah-and-Birkat-Kohanim-Chapter-Fifteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in Hilchot Tzitzit he does not mention how many <em>mitzvot</em> are violated by not wearing <em>tzitzit</em>, and in Hilchot Mezuzah he does not mention how many <em>mitzvot</em> are violated by not having a <em>mezuzah</em>.</p>\n<p>Given that all four cases stem from the same Talmudic passage, why does Rambam only mention this in two out of the four cases?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Multiple responsa have been written to address this question. In Shu\"t Toafot Re'em (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=484&pgnum=49\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"># 32</a>) <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%98%D7%95%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Aharon Moshe Taubes</a> argues that by <em>tefillin</em> there really are eight <em>mitzvot</em>, whereas in the other cases there really is only one <em>mitvah</em> and it's only <strong>as if</strong> there are multiple <em>mitzvot</em>. As evidence of this he cites the fact that by <em>birkat kohanim</em> Rambam actually wrote that \"it is <strong>like</strong> three <em>mitzvot</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>However, this doesn't seem like such a strong answer because Rambam clearly mentioned the number of <em>mitzvot</em> by <em>birkat kohanim</em> even though in reality it's only one <em>mitzvah</em>, and therefore he could have done the same by <em>tzitizit</em> and <em>mezuzah</em>. Moreover, in Sefer Hamitzvot (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58956&st=&pgnum=140\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoresh  9</a>) Rambam mentions the Talmudic passage and lumps all the cases together, saying that despite the statement of the Sages none of the counters of <em>mitzvot</em> ever suggested that <em>tzitzit</em> is five mitzvot, that <em>birkat kohanim</em> is three <em>mitzvot</em>, or that <em>tefillin</em> is eight <em>mitzvot</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והראיה על כל מה שאמרנו אמרם כל שאין לו ציצית בבגדו עובר בחמשה עשה בעבור שנכפל בו לשון הצווי חמשה פעמים אחד ועשו להם ציצית שני ונתנו על ציצית הכנף שלישי והיה לכם לציצית רביעי גדילים תעשה לך חמישי על ארבע כנפות כסותך ומצאנו להם לשון מבואר במצות ציצית שהיא מצוה אחת כמו שאבאר כשאזכור אותה ועל הדרך הזאת בעצמה אמרו כל שאינו מניח תפילין עובר בשמנה עשה להכפל הצווי בהם שמנה פעמים כלו' בשלראש ושליד וכן אמרם כל כהן שאינו עולה לדוכן עובר בשלשה עשה להכפל הצווי בו שלש פעמים ולא יתפשט אחד מהמונים המצות שיאמר ברכת כהנים שלש מצות וציצית חמש מצות ותפלין שמנה מצות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that Rambam himself did not distinguish between <em>tefillin</em> and the other cases.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Ettlinger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Ettlinger</a> suggests a different answer in Shu\"t Binyan Tzion (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=591&st=&pgnum=9&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"># 7</a>). He argues that Rambam tends to end off sections with words of <em>mussar</em> about the topic, and this Talmudic passage fits that bill. However, in the cases of <em>tzitzit</em> and <em>mezuzah</em> he didn't need to turn to this passage, because he already had better statements to use. In Hilchot Tzitzit (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=939\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:12</a>) he wrote that one should always be diligent because <em>tzitzit</em> is equated to all other <em>mitzvot</em>, and in Hilchot Mezuzah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=854\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:13</a>) he wrote that one should be diligent because <em>mezuzah</em> is a constant obligation for everyone.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שלא כ' דברי ר\"ש ג\"כ לענין ציצית ומזוזה לענ\"ד הטעם דהנה כל דברי ר\"ש כמה עשה איכא אין נפקותא לדינא ולא אמר כן רק להגדיל ענין המצות הללו ולכן הביא הרמב\"ם דבריו בסוף ה' תפילין ובסוף ה' נכ\"פ כדרכו שבסוף ההלכות כותב דברי מוסר על המצות שביאר אכן לענין ציצית לא הוצרך להביא דברי ר\"ש לזה שכתב סוף ה' ציצית להגדיל המצו' מה שכולל יותר שכתב לעולם יהא זהיר במצות ציצית שהרי הכתוב שקלה ותלה בה כל המצות כולן עכ\"ל וכן לענין מזוזה כתב בסוף ה' מזוזה חייב אדם להזהר במזוזה מפני שהיא חובת הכל תמיד וכו' ע\"ש שהגדיל ענין המצו' ע\"י בחינות התרוממות אשר על כן לא הוצרך לכתוב שיש בה ב' מצות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This answer seems to fit better with Rambam's statement in Sefer Hamitzvot where he apparently assumes that the Talmudic passage is meant to be an inspiration rather than a legal declaration.</p>\n\n\n",

They then decide against the opinion of the bat kol.

They said there: “R’ Nassan found Eliyahu, etc. He said to him, ‘What was Hashem doing at that time?’ He said to him, ‘He laughed and said, “My sons have triumphed over me.”’”</p>\n  \n  <p>כלומר שהיה הקדוש ברוך הוא שמח על שהיו בניו הולכים בדרך התורה ובמצותה להטות אחרי רבים, ומה שאמר נצחוני בני חלילה להיות נצחון לפניו ברוך הוא, אבל פרוש הדבר הוא על ענין זה, שבמחלקת הזה שהיתה לרבי אליעזר עם חבריו האמת היתה כרבי אליעזר וכדברי הבת קול שהכריעה כמותו, ואף על פי שהיה האמת אתו בזה, ביתרון פלפולו על חבריו לא ירדו לסוף דעתו, ולא רצו להודות לדבריו אפילו אחר בת קול, והביאו ראיה מן הדין הקבוע בתורה שצותנו ללכת אחרי הרבים לעולם, בין יאמרו אמת או אפילו טועים.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>That is to say: Hashem was happy that his children were going in the path of the Torah and its Mitzvah to follow the majority. That which He said, “My children have triumphed over Me,” Chas v’Shalom that there should be triumph before Hashem. But the explanation of this matter is that in the dispute between R’ Eliezer with his friends, <strong>the truth was like R’ Eliezer and the Bas Kol which sided with him</strong>. Even though the truth was with him, with the extent of his sharpness over his friends, they were unable to understand him. They did not want to accept his words even after the Bas Kol, and they brought a proof from the fixed law in the Torah that we are commanded to follow the majority always, whether they say the truth or even if they are mistaken. </p>\n  \n  <p>ועל זה השיב הבורא ברוך הוא נצחוני בני, כלומר, אחר שהם נוטים מדרך האמת, שרבי אליעזר הוא היה מכוין בזה את האמת, והם באים עליו מכח מצות התורה שצויתים לשמע אל הרב לעולם, אם כן על כל פנים יש להודות להם בפעם הזאת כדבריהם שתהיה האמת נעדרת, והרי זה כאלו בעל האמת נצוח.</p>\n  \n  <p>On this Hashem responded, “My children have triumphed over Me.” That is to say, after they tipped away from the path of truth, since R’ Eliezer was the one who perceived the truth in this, and they came upon him from the strength of the Mitzvah of the Torah which commanded them to listen to the majority always — if so, in any event there is to admit to them in this instance like their words, that it is the absolute truth. Behold, this is as if the master of truth triumphed!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(FWIW, the Ramban you cite is on Devarim 17:11, and while he connects this concept to several other Talmudic incidents, he indeed does not connect it to the Gemara at hand.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for Ir Miklat used to improve one's character\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard in a <em>shiur</em> that one purpose for sending an accidental killer to the <em>arei miklat</em>, the cities of refuge, was so that they could improve their character. They would be surrounded by the <em>Leviim</em>, and their positive character traits and attributes will rub off on the accidental killer. The fact that they killed someone, albeit unintentionally, shows a certain lacking on his part. Nothing is by chance and Hashem may be trying to send this person a message that they should improve.</p>\n<p>I was wondering the source for this idea. The <strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.408.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#408</a>) says differently, that the land of the <em>Leviim</em> is holy and might atone for the killer <sup>1</sup>, or that the <em>Leviim</em> won't reject the killer because of their good character traits. The latter is close but not the same idea.</p>\n<p>I seem to recall the <em>shiur</em> quoting this from the <strong>Avnei Nezer</strong>.

If someone has a comment to confirm, or a better answer, please feel free. I'm not really sure what he is saying; it sounds more like the place fixes the character traits than the Leviim who are there, but one could be a byproduct of the other.</p>\n<p>I found the <strong>Shem MiShmuel</strong> (the son of the <strong>Avnei Nezer</strong>), <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shem_MiShmuel%2C_Shoftim.4.16?vhe=Sefer_Shem_Mishmuel,_Piotrkow,_1927-1934&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says something like this</a> based on an idea from the <strong>Kotzker Rebbe</strong> (the <strong>Avnei Nezer</strong>'s father-in-law).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה ידוע שמקומו של אדם למטה הוא שורשו גם למעלה, וכבר הגדנו זה בשם כ\"ק זקיני האדומו\"ר הגדול זצללה\"ה מקאצק, וע\"כ ערי הלוים שורשם נמי כמדת הלוים, וע\"כ חבורת לוים שהיו דרים במקום אחר זולת עריהם, אינם קולטים מפני **שהמקום גורם...**‏</p>\n<p>Behold it is known that the place of a person below is also his root above, and we were already told this in the name of my grandfather the Kotzker Rebbe, therefore the cities of the Leviim also had their roots like the characteristics of the Leviim. Therefore, a group of Leviim who would live elsewhere, outside their city, wouldn't protect [the accidental killer] because <strong>the place itself causes [the protection]...</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The end of this paragraph seems to negate the idea that it's the Leviim who change the person, rather it's the place. But he's saying something about the \"root\" coming from the Leviim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וע\"כ ערי מקלט שהופרשו מהן יש בהן נמי רק חיות ממעלת המדות ולא החיות ממעלת השכל, וע\"כ אינן נותנין חיים רק <strong>למי שפגם במעלת הגוף והמדות</strong> דהיינו שחטא בשוגג שלא נפגם השכל אצלו אלא החטא והפגם הוא במה שלא הי' מצד עצמו נמשך להיפוך משפיכת דמים, כי השלם בגופו ובמדותיו, אין האברים שלו נמשכים מעצמם אף בלי הוראת השכל לדבר שאינו ראוי...‏</p>\n<p>Therefore, the cities of refuge which were separated, they had a lifesource from the virtue of character traits, and not a lifesource from the virtue of the intellect. Therefore, they only gave life to <strong>someone who blemished the virtue of the body and character traits</strong>, that is that they sinned accidentally and not that they blemished their intellect. The sin and the blemish was that they didn't pull themselves away from bloodshed, since when someone who is perfect in their body and character traits, their limbs aren't propelled on their own to something inappropriate, without the command of the intellect...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This paragraph sounds like part of the idea, that a person couldn't have sinned this way if they had perfected their character traits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן נמי במי ששפך דמים בשוגג הוא פגם בגופו ובמדותיו ולא בשכלו, ע\"כ לאיש כזה הוא תיקון ערי המקלט ששורשן בחיות הגוף והמדות</p>\n<p>Similarly, someone who spills blood by accident has blemished his body and character traits and not his intellect, therefore a person like this will be fixed in the cities of refuge, whose root is the lifesource of the body and the character traits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again this sounds like the place and not the people.</p>\n\n\n",

All halachic sources are found Orach Chaim 489:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I wasn't sure if that Halachic rule would overpower the Chiyuv to\n  count immediately because of concerns for \"Mitzvah Haba'ah\n  Leyadcha...\", \"Zerizin Makdimin\" and \"Temimos\" etc.</p>\n  \n  <p>It turns out that the Biur Halacha (s.v. Achar) quotes the Chok\n  Ya'akov who applies the rule of Tadir here, and says that one should\n  wait for Ma'ariv before counting. The Piskei Teshuvos (Note Gimmel)\n  takes this further and adds that you should count it Betzibbur, which\n  would be another reason to wait for Ma'ariv later to count. </p>\n  \n  <p>However, the Magen Avraham (Note Zayin) says that one may count by\n  themselves even before Ma'ariv, and he does not seem to qualify it as\n  Bedi'eved. He, nor any of the commentaries I saw, object on the basis\n  of Tadir. The Aruch Hashulchan (Se'if Yud) cites this Lehalacha and\n  says that it is the \"Derech Ha'olam\" to count after Ma'ariv, but that\n  it is fine to count before as well. The same Bi'ur Halacha quoted\n  earlier cites the Mor Uketzi'a who supports this as well. </p>\n  \n  <p>If we accept that there is a Chiyuv to count Betzibbur and/or follow\n  those Poskim who apply \"Tadir...\", you could make the argument that\n  one does not have to count right away.  However, if we reject that\n  view, and follow the Magen Avraham/Aruch Hashulchan, it is hard to see\n  why one should delay counting the Omer until after Ma'ariv.</p>\n  \n  <p>(I would note that the question of Tadir is only applicable when both\n  are in front of you and can be done now.  If I am waiting for a minyan\n  to daven later, and have a shomer/alarm reminding me of it, but there\n  is a Chiyuv Sefirah now, I'm not sure anyone would say that Tadir\n  applies.

And it is written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” (Isaiah 40:12). If the entire world measures one square span, which is a quarter of one square cubit, we find according to this calculation that the entire world is one part in three thousand and two hundred of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does it mean G-d's cubit, G-d's span (זרת) and how the universe is measured?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ben Yehoyada, in his explanation of the Gemara, understands the references to cubits and spans metaphorically. He begins by citing various teachings of Chazal's that one should verbalize his Torah learning, and with that foundation, he explains the Gemara as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה נודע פה פתוחה מספרה שמונה מאות, ולכן לימוד ד׳ חלקים פרד״ס בפה פתוחה - הנה המספר עולה שלשה אלפים ומאתים. ועל זה רמז זכריה הנביא ע״ה במידה זו שנתן לתורה שבעל פה שלשה אלפים ומאתים זרתות. והא דנעשה החשבון בזרתות שהוא חצי אמה לרמוז שהעוסק בתורה לא יראה עצמו חכם שלם, אלא יחשוב תמיד שהוא עודנו כחצי.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Behold, it is known that פה פתוחה [\"open mouth,\" his expression for verbalizing one's learning; he uses it here as a play on words for a final ף, which] has a value of 800,<sup>1</sup> and therefore learning the four sections of PaRDeS with an open mouth - behold, the value rises to 3200[=800x4]. Regarding this did Zecharia the prophet, peace be upon him, hint with this measure which he gave to the Oral Torah - 3200 spans. That which he made this calculation in spans, which are half-cubits, is to hint that one who toils in Torah should not see himself as a complete sage; rather, he should always consider [himself] as if he is still like a half.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

So, when does something have the status of a utensil (שם כלי)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Shem keli is a special halachical status of utensil, following the first pshat of the Rash, <strong>this status is lost when the Din of utensil is irreversibly cancelled</strong>. The statements regards the piece of the former utensil, not the former utensil itself.</p>\n\n<p>Now we need to resolve the contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>Rash Keim 3.3, (to understand it we need to read the Rash in 2.2. before)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשניקבה. במוציא זית וטהרה כשחזר ועשאה בזפת מקבלת טומאה מכאן ולהבא: חזרה ונשברה לשברים הרבה ואותו שבר שבו הזפת מחזיק רביעית טמא</p>\n  \n  <p>An amphora was perforated and cannot more hold olives (the opinion of Rabbi Meir), it became clean, it is no more an utensil. He clogged it with tar. The amphora is back an utensil, <strong>because it has a possibility to become back a keli, we say that the Shem Keli (name of utensil) is not cancelled</strong>. Further, the Amphora was broken a second time, one of the pieces is able to hold Reviit. This piece is able to be unclean, this is a new utensil. The original amphora was a big a large utensil in terracotta. In Chapter 2 mishna 2, they taught that a large utensil (between Log, i.e. 4 X reviit, and Sea, 96 X reviit), when it's broken and we have pieces, a piece that can stand up and hold 1/96 of the original amphora volume becomes itself a new utensil. When such a piece was perforated it's no more an utensil, even if we repaired it with tar. So, <strong>when a piece-utensil is perforated it loses definitely the name of utensil</strong>. The source is the Tosefta (0)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are two issues, </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>The original amphora</strong>, when is it no more a an utensil may reach its status again, (It is not an utensil but has still a name of utensil). For an utensil, losing the status of utensil is reversible, we say that the name of utensil is not cancelled. E.g. if we clog the hole by tar, the status of utensil comes back; (1) </p></li>\n<li><p>and <strong>the pieces</strong>, when they did lose a status of utensil may not reach their status a second time. (we say that the name of utensil is lost). (2) </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let's imagine we have two identical pieces of terracotta they can hold water because they are clogged by tar. The first is an utensil and the second is not an utensil. The Chiddush in Mishna 3.3 is that we have a piece, that is an utensil thanks to the tar. The reason is that it's first step as utensil was thanks to the tar. The tar was there before the large amphora was broken, before the new piece-utensil was created. But if a piece has a status of utensil and loses it, it cannot come back. For a piece, losing status of keli is definitive, we say that it is losing the name of utensil. </p>\n\n<p>The expression ביטול שם כלי in the Mishna refers to an irreversible change. </p>\n\n<p>About what the Mishna says that the name of utensil was not cancelled?</p>\n\n<p>The statement \"the name of utensil was not cancelled from it\" refers to <strong>the piece</strong> (\"shever\" is a masculine name in Hebrew), and therefore, the Rash says that the spelling would be better if it was:\n></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>טמא</strong>  מפני שלא בטל שם כלי <strong>מעליו</strong>.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>instead</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>טמאה</strong> מפני שלא בטל שם כלי <strong>מעליה.</strong>‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>In summary.</h2>\n\n<p>The Mishna speaks about the piece which is an utensil thanks to the tar. This is possible because the tar was here before the piece becomes for the first time an utensil. I hope that now it clear. <strong>The name of utensil was not cancelled from the piece before it was never brocken.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>The rational:</h2>\n\n<p>The comment Mishna Rishona gives several explanations.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>When we see an amphora, even if it is perforated, despite the hole people call it \"amphora\".</p></li>\n<li><p>When we have a perforated amphora we don't not give up using it, we say it must be repaired.</p></li>\n<li><p>In name of the second pshat of the Rash: When an amphora was perforated by a large hole and cannot hold olives, we can decide to use it for larger fruits as pomegranates (we can without changing nothing, define a new use, and instantaneously it is back an utensile). But The Mishna Rishona has objections and says that the Rambam disagrees with this explanation. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Note</h2>\n\n<p>When the Rash says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד דעדיין כלי היא לקבל בה רמונים וראויה לגרוגרות ולאגוזים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>this is a second pshat, hard to get (see comment Mishna Acharona).

The form opens during the day on Shabbat. It is highly likely (almost undoubtedly the case) that by the time Shabbat is over, the event's registration will be full, and it will be too late. May one ask a non jew prior to Shabbat to register one for the event?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It is prohibited to ask a non-Jew to do a <em>melacha</em> for you. It makes no difference whether the request is made before or during Shabbos. (For overview of the relevant Halachos, see <a href=\"https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Amirah_LeNochri#cite_note-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>SA OC 307.5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דבר שאינו מלאכה ואינו אסור לעשותו בשבת אלא משום שבות מותר לישראל לומר לאינו יהודי לעשותו בשבת <strong>והוא שיהיה שם מקצת חולי או יהיה צריך לדבר צורך הרבה או מפני מצוה</strong> כיצד אומר ישראל לאינו יהודי בשבת לעלות באילן להביא שופר לתקוע תקיעת מצוה או להביא מים דרך חצר שלא עירבו לרחוץ בו המצטער ויש אוסרין:     הגה: ולקמן סימן תקפ\"ו (סעיף כב) פסק להתיר ועיין לעיל סימן רע\"ו דיש מקילין אפילו במלאכה דאורייתא ועיין שם סעיף ג':&rlml;  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's allowed to say to a non Jew to make something that is not a Melacha Deorayta on Shabbat... but only if it is linked to a problem of illness or a great need. ...</p>\n\n<p>In sayif 4</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מותר לתת לאינו יהודי מעות מערב שבת לקנות לו ובלבד שלא יאמר לו קנה בשבת: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's permitted to say erev Shabbat a non Jew to buy something, but they don't not say explicitely to buy it on Shabbat. </p>\n\n<p>In sayif 3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור ליתן לאינו יהודי מעות מערב שבת לקנות לו בשבת אבל יכול לומר לו קנה לעצמך ואם אצטרך אקנה ממך לאחר השבת: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's prohibited to give to a non Jew money Erev Shabbat to buy something on Shabbat but thwy can say him buy it for yourself and if I will need it I will buy it from you after Shabbat. </p>\n\n<p>So, apparently, to say on Shabbat it's a problem and it is prohibited. But if they ask him before Shabbat following the ways indicated in Sayif 3 and 4, it's allowed. But if your name must to be written in the registration may be a problem. I think that the NJ can buy two places with his name and he can sell one of them.  </p>\n\n\n",

The Torah has taught a person the desired mode of behavior: <strong>A person should build a house, then plant a vineyard, and afterward marry a woman</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, in the same paragraph, Rambam calls those who do otherwise fools:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But fools reverse it by taking a wife first, and after that, if he be able, purchase a home, and after that, in his declining years, he will turn about looking for a vocation, or be supported on charity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From a practical standpoint this seems a very sound opinion, however, the Lubavitcher Rebbe in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaz-foA8UN4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his talk on family planning</a> expresses a contradictory view on the subject:</p>\n<p><strong>The Rebbe states that a man should not delay the mitzva \"to be fruitful and multiply\" and must not wait until he has enough parnasa to get married and bring children into this world as every child comes with its own parnasa and Hashem provides sustenance for every child.</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore, according to the Rebbe, a man must not wait till he has a house and \"vineyard\" to get married, but must get married as soon as possible regardless of whether he is financially able to have children and support them.</p>\n<p>Correct me if I'm wrong but the Rebbe's opinion seems to contradict Rambam. If so, then who is right? <strong>Should we wait till we have a house built and a \"vineyard planted\" to get married as Rambam and Gemara suggest or follow the Rebbe's view?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Quoting from the Sefer \"שולחן מנחם\" a compilation of tshuvos of the Rebbe organised according to שולחן ערוך.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe quotes the Rambam and the Maharasha on Sota 44a with notes from hagahos yaavetz that this halocha teaches us the Derech eretz- the best way. But if one is not able to follow it, he should certainly get married anyways - see there. <img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MYrew.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p>\n<p>The<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0upjB.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p>\n<p>The Rebbe writes in his letter a point that he mentioned many, many times. It would be lovely if we were able to keep this Halocha but in this modern world, to not marry until one is financially stable would, and has, caused much damage to the Jewish nation. It's clear in Shulchan Aruch- get married young!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To be precise- in the video the Rebbe was addressing the issues of those people who don't want to have \"more\" children and raise a large family because they won't be able to afford them. The Rebbe answers that Hashem will send the parnassa with them.</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe emphasizes a few times that the issue is \"expanding\" the family (5:12), having \"more children\" (3:43), and people complaining about \"so many children\" (4:10) and the \"bother of more children\" (6:31). He emphasizes this a few other times.</p>\n\n<p>I didn't catch anything in the video about waiting to get married before working or vice versa.</p>\n\n<p>It definitely sounded like the Rebbe's assumption was that you had some means of making a parnassah- though not clear whether before or after marriage- and the only question was would that means still be sufficient if the family size grew.</p>\n\n<p>Thus he was saying- don't limit one's family size based on calculations about potential for parnassah. But whether you should have the means for parnassa before marriage isn't discussed at all over here.\nSo I don't see a direct contradiction between the Rebbe and the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I didn't listen to the lecture, but if your quote is correct that <code>The Rebbe states that a man should not delay the mitzva \"to be fruitful and multiply\" and must not wait until he has enough parnasa to get married and bring children into this world</code> then that is the answer.</p>\n\n<p>Neither the Rambam nor the Rebbe expect of you to be able to support a wife <strong>and kids</strong> before you get married.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that both agree that once you <em>can afford the rent</em>, you're fit to get married.</p>\n\n\n",

You shall each revere his mother and his father... </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Different interpreters explain the concept of being holy differently (for instance, withholding from adultery - \" הֱווּ פְרוּשִׁים מִן הָעֲרָיוֹת וּמִן הָעֲבֵרָה,\" Rashi) but I didn't see anyone defining the evident link between being Kadosh and revering one's parents.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any prominent interpreters that do see the connection, and if there aren't any, why is that so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If you use <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1570/micha-berger\">Rabbi Micha Berger</a>'s approach in his Sefer <a href=\"http://mosaicapress.com/widen-your-tent/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Widen your Tent</a>, then you will have an answer.</p>\n\n<p>If I can paraphrase it correctly (I doubt that I can):</p>\n\n<p>Kedusha is <em>dedication</em>, specifically -- when referring to Hashem -- dedication to bestowing goodness.</p>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question:</p>\n\n<p>קְדֹשִׁים תִּהְיוּ - become people dedicated to bestowing goodness on others</p>\n\n<p>כִּי קָדוֹשׁ אֲנִי - for I am dedicated to bestowing goodness on others (as this is the purpose for which I created the world)</p>\n\n<p>Thus:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rever your parents; it makes them feel good to be appreciated and honored - especially after all the dedicated kindness they did for you as a kid.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Same for Arayot, which you refer to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don't <em>cheat on your wife</em>; that's extremely unkind.

If you don't come through their hands to Olam HaZeh you will not merit Olam Habo.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The implication is that parents raise a child in a way that gives them the tools to live a Jewish life. Through their training of Mitzvos and middos a child builds a firm foundation.

Our sages in Sotah 36 interpret Genesis 49,24: \"and his arms were made firm by the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob\" as a reference to how his father's image helped save Joseph from the temptation he experienced at the hands of the wife of Potiphar. At the critical moment, when Mrs Potiphar grabbed hold of Joseph's tunic, he saw a vision of his father's face outside the window. This caused him to resist the advances of Mrs Potiphar and to leave the tunic in her hand and flee her presence. According to the Talmud, Joseph's semen escaped via his hands instead of via his male organ, etc. I have heard it said in the name of Kabbalists (Kav Hayashar chapter 2) that the image of one's father's face strengthens the forces of sanctity within his son and helps him resist becoming a victim to temptation involving sexual abominations. The reason the Torah speaks about \"his mother and his father you shall fear,\" at this juncture close to chapter 18 is that anyone in the throes of carnal temptation should summon up the image of his parents before his eyes. He will find that this will help him resist the temptation. 2We also have a hint here that if someone indulges in forbidden sex he shames the honour of his father. This is why the Torah wrote the commandment to fear mother and father so close to the legislation dealing with fordidden sex. In other words, indulgence in forbidden sex is equivalent to a violation of the commandment to fear one's mother and father. The parents would curse a son who commits such an act because they feel ashamed to have brought such a son into the world. This is also the reason the mother is mentioned here first as she feels the shame more deeply than her husband. Solomon explained this in Proverbs 10,1 when he wrote: \"and a foolish son is his mother's sorrow.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why does the mishna prescribe an indirect measure of whether somebody knew about a court ruling?",
    "content": "# Why does the mishna prescribe an indirect measure of whether somebody knew about a court ruling?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Horayot.1.2?lang=bi&with=Horayot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horayot 1:2</a> discusses a case where a court made a ruling that something is permitted and then later rescinded the ruling.  Meanwhile, somebody did the thing they initially said is permitted -- is he liable?  R' Eliezer says that one who is sitting at home is liable and one who has traveled overseas is not, and Ben Azzai explains that this is because the one who's sitting at home could have heard about the updated ruling while the traveler probably could not.</p>\n\n<p>This explanation makes sense in <em>general</em>, but there are cases where somebody who's at home would nonetheless not hear about the updated ruling (for example, someone who is home sick), and we can imagine cases where somebody who's traveled far away could nonetheless hear about the ruling (for example, from someone else who later joins him in that location).  I grant that the <em>usual</em> cases (in this time, not in our connected world) are as Ben Azzai explains, but it makes me wonder: why the indirection?  </p>\n\n<p>Instead of evaluating people's liability for transgressions based on assumptions rooted in geography, why did Chazal not make a more direct ruling: one who has heard about the update is liable, and one who has not is not?  The practical effect seems to be that one who knowingly violated the court's (amended) ruling must bring an atonement offering, but that's something that the individual decides and does anyway, not something the community can compel, right?  The person who knew but cites his overseas trip is still going to be held accountable before the divine court, isn't he?  And is the one who didn't know, but was at home, really going to be held liable?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think that the rule you assumed is written in Mishna 1.1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זה הכלל: התולה בעצמו, חייב. והתולה בבית דין, פטור. ‏</p>\n<p>This is the rule, one who follows his own opinion needs to bring a personal Chatat, one who follows the Bet Din needs not bring a personal Chatat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The mishna 2 treat cases in which he doesn't know that Chachamim changed the Psak. And gives an examples of doubtful cases according to Rabbi Eliezer. The Bartenura explains, the cases are equivalent to a doubt, the man doesn't say \"I don't know if I was aware to the changment of not\", there are not classical doubt as in the common Korban Asham Talui.</p>\n<p>A man doesn't know that Bet din Changed the psak. But he had the possibily to be informed despite he is not informed. This is an intermediate Halachical status of guilt, he needs to bring an Asham Taluy according to Rabbi Eliezer. One example is when he stays in the town of the court, he would easily be informed.</p>\n<p>Note that Rabbi Shimeon holds that this man is still minded that the old psak is still relevant, for Rabbi Shimeon there is no status of doubt. We don't follow his opinion Lahalacha, we follow Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva and Ben Azay.</p>\n<p>If he is not in the town, all Tanayim hold the same rule. It's not easy for him to reach the information, so if he continues to follow the first psak, he must not to bring a personal Chatat and not an Asham Taluy.</p>\n<p>But if he is still in the town and is preparing for his trip, we have two opinions in the set of Tanayim who are against rabbi Shimeon.</p>\n<p>For rabbi Akiva, he is so busy that he is not guilty at all if he is not informed. He cannot be informed. For Ben Azay, since he is still in the town, he can be informed and needs to bring an Asham Talui.</p>\n<p>But if a man is actually informed there is no question, he needs to bring an individual chatat. The discussion is only for a non informed man, if to be not informed is a kind of guilt. In town there is doubtful guilt, out of the town, there is no guilt, and there are intermediary cases.</p>\n<p>We can give an example in our world with some similarities, not exactly the same. The government has changed the speed limit on the road. People cannot claim they don't know. If they don't know, this is their problem. But we can assume that if someone was in an isolated place, he can claim he cannot be informed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are there still anti-Kabbalah Orthodox Jewish movements?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Throughout history, there were Orthodox Jewish Rabbis who were against Kabbalah, the doctrine of reincarnation, etc.\nAre there still today Jewish movements that are anti-Kabbalah? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>There are several contemporary (or recently deceased) rabbis, with followings, that express anti-kabbalistic attitudes and ideas. I'm not so sure that I would go quite so far as to call them formal \"movements\" as such, but such ideas are definitely still in circulation within the Orthodox world.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Israel Chait, the Rosh Yeshivah of Yeshivah Bnei Torah in Far Rockaway, NY has a long history of advocating on behalf of a rational approach to Judaism. You can learn more about the specifics of his perspective by scrolling down to the section titled \"Kabbalah\" on the <a href=\"https://www.ybt.org/fundamentals.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Fundamentals page</a> and listening to those shi'urim.</p>\n<p>One of R. Chait's talmidim, R. Moshe Ben-Chaim started a site and organization called Mesora, that is very active on this front. You can read various entries on Kabbalah, the Zohar, reincarnation, etc. on the <a href=\"http://www.mesora.org/philosophy.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">philosophy page</a>. There is also an 78 page volume available for download titled <a href=\"http://www.mesora.org/ToharHayihud.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tohar ha-Yihud</a> that attempts to demonstrate the propriety and antiquity of such views within Judaism.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yihyeh Qafih was the Hakham Bashi of Yemen and founder of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dor_Daim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dor Deah movement</a> in the early 20th c. He faced tremendous institutional opposition from those that condemned his Maimonidean anti-kabbalistic views, he was persecuted greatly. His grandson, Rabbi Yosef Qafih (who was raised by R. Yihyeh), perpetuated his grandfather's legacy of Maimonideanism but was very reticent to publicly express any views on Kabbalah and generally avoided making statements on the matter. Some speculate that this was intended to foster reconciliation, others speculate that he did not want to arouse against himself the type of persecution his grandfather faced. After R. Yosef Qafih passed away, a volume titled שיחת דקלים was posthumously published in which R. Qafih in the form of a dialogue deconstructs various Kabbalistic ideas (such as the Ten Sefiroth). R. Yosef Qafih's students, such as Rabbi Dr. Rason 'Arusi (Chief Rabbi of Qiryath Ono) very delicately sidestep all such questions in public and attempt to redirect questioners (for examples see his responses to questions on the topic of <a href=\"https://net-sah.org/tags/442\" rel=\"noreferrer\">קבלה ותורת הסוד</a> here). Many students of this school avoid public discourse on the topic, though in private feel more comfortable expressing their views. Other students of this school today are quite a bit more publicly vocal and unhesitatingly lambast anything Kabbalah related. Rabbi Dr. Adir Dahuah-Halewi, started an organization and site <a href=\"https://www.orharambam.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ohr HaRambam</a>, that takes this approach.</p>\n<p>R. Nathan Slifkin (currently director of the Biblical Museum of Natural History in Beit Shemesh) has publicly expressed his skepticism of the authenticity of the Zohar and all things mystical. He has circulated this anonymous (purportedly by a Haredi author) analysis of the question of the text's authenticity:\n<a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/ZoharEnglish.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">An Analysis of the Authenticity of the Zohar</a> discussed it further <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2019/01/you-dont-mess-with-zohar-or-do-you.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and authored a book titled <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/9657023629\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rationalism vs. Mysticism; Schisms in Traditional Judaism</a></p>\n<p>Hakham Yosef Faur (who was a rabbi of the Syrian community in Brooklyn for many years, and a professor of Talmud at several academic institutions), has expressed views critical of Kabbalah and Kabbalah based mysticism. He wrote an essay <a href=\"http://moreshetsepharad.org/media/-A_Crisis_of_Categories_Kabbalah_and_the_Rise_of_Apostasy_in_Spain.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A Crisis of Categories: Kabbalah and the Rise of Apostasy in Spain</a> exploring this and in Section 5 of his book the <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1936235048\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horizontal Society</a>, he has many subsections dedicated to this topic. His views on the topic are well known and discussed by his students. His son Hakham Abe Faur, and other students of Hakham Yosef Faur such as Hakham Aharon Halewa do not deny that there is a mystical aspect to Judaism, however they affirm in the Maimonidean tradition that it is of a post-rational variety and unrelated to what is popularly known as \"Kabbalah\".</p>\n<p>Rabbi Dr. Norman Strickman (rabbi of Merkaz Yisrael in Marine Park, Brooklyn) has long been vocal on the topic and has translated and published several of the Ibn Ezra's writings to English and written a book titled <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/193623548X\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Without Red Strings or Holy Water</a> exploring the topic through a Maimonidean lens.</p>\n<p>Rabbi David Bar-Hayim, founder of Machon Shiloh, has lectured and written on the topic of Kabbalah and sees it as a regressive product of exile that is preventative of the redemption. You can listen to a lecture he gave on the topic here: <a href=\"https://www.machonshilo.org/post/how-the-galut-influenced-kabbalah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">How the Galuth Influenced Kabbalah</a>, and search the <a href=\"https://www.machonshilo.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Machon Shiloh site</a> for terms such as Kabbalah, Zohar, reincarnation, etc. to find more content.</p>\n<p>I'm sure there are others that are escaping me currently, and if anyone would like to add any in the comments, I would be glad to add them to my answer.</p>\n\n\n",

They have many disagreements, which the <strong>Rambam</strong> lays out in his work.</p>\n<p>From what I can tell, they both count a <em>mitzvah</em> to recite the Shema (<strong>Rambam</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Positive_Commandments.10.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Aseh</em> #10</a>, <strong>Bahag</strong> <em>Aseh</em> #1).</p>\n<p>In the Machon Yerushalayim edition of the <strong>Bahag</strong>'s work, they conveniently cross reference the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s corresponding mitzvah number in the Bahag's list.

Unless I'm missing something, they don't disagree. Is there room to say they disagree? Or is Machon Yerushalayim mistaken (or is this a typo)?

Maybe the <strong>Bahag</strong> includes it in reciting the Shema, although I don't see how that is evident.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: After studying this version of the <strong>Bahag</strong> more, I realized that Machon Yerushalayim are relying heavily on the listing of the <strong>Bahag</strong>'s <em>mitzvos</em> which was determined by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%99%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Avraham Shimon Traube</strong></a>, whose notes are on the bottom. He's the one who divided up the <em>mitzvos</em> (as there were no commas or periods in the original <strong>Bahag</strong>, and it's vague where to put them). He's also the one who cross-referenced the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s Sefer HaMitzvos. An older (and freely available) version of his work can be found <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/14119\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=14119#p=8&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">you can see</a> in the older version there's also a dash beside the <em>mitzvah</em> of Kriyas Shema. So this isn't a question on Machon Yerushalayim, but rather on <strong>Rav Traube</strong>'s interpretation.</p>\n<p>What's strange is <strong>Rav Traube</strong> doesn't provide any footnote, something he was careful to do when suggesting an innovative interpretation of the <strong>Bahag</strong>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I asked two very smart people for their input on this question, and they each told me their own answer.</p>\n\n<p>One explanation is based on the fact that the <strong>Bahag</strong> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14119&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Berachos Chapter 3</a>) rules that besides the <em>mitzvah</em> of reciting the Shema, there's a biblical requirement to verbally recall the Exodus from Egypt. This is accomplished while saying Shema and it's blessings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ספק אמר אמת ויציב</strong> ספק לא אמר <strong>חוזר ואומר</strong> וכן ברכות המזון וכן ברכת שבעת המינין דחיובא דאורייתא נינהו חוזר ומברך <strong>אבל שאר ברכות דרבנן</strong> לא הדר ומברך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the <strong>Ohr Somayach</strong> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14551&st=&pgnum=31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Kriyas Shema 1:3</a>) holds that even though the <strong>Rambam</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Reading_the_Shema.1.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad. loc.</a>) say's there's a <em>mitzvah</em> to recall the Exodus, it's only Rabbinic. If so, perhaps this makes the <strong>Bahag</strong>'s <em>mitzvah</em> of reciting the Shema include more than the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s (ie: recalling the Exodus), making them not exactly the same <em>mitzvah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach is based on what <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%97%D7%9D_%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Yerucham Fischel Perla</strong></a> writes in his commentary to <strong>Rav Saadiah Gaon</strong>'s Sefer HaMitzvos (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Commentary_on_Sefer_Hamitzvot_of_Rasag%2C_Positive_Commandments.3.13?vhe=Sefer_Hamitzvot_L%27Rasag,_Warsaw,_1914_--_vol._1&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aseh #3</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומעתה לפ\"ז נראה ברור <strong>דעשה דאנכי ועשה דשמע ישראל ועשה דק\"ש. הנך תלת רק חדא מצוה חשיבי לחשבון תרי\"ג מצות</strong>. דמה שסתם הכתוב בקרא דאנכי חזר ופירש בפרשת שמע. דכתוב בה ודברת בם וגו' בשכבך ובקומך. לומר דלא בהאמנת הלב בלחוד סגי אלא שמוטל עלינו לייחד השם גם בקריאה בכל יום פעמים. בבוקר ובערב. והיינו מצות ק\"ש. וכן מתבאר להדיא ממה שאמרו במדרש (דברים רבה ס' ואתחנן) מהיכן זכו ישראל לקרות שמע. אר\"פ בר חמא ממתן תורה זכו ישראל לקרות שמע. כיצד את מוצא לא פתח הקב\"ה בסיני תחלה אלא בדבר זה. אמר להם שמע ישראל אנכי ה' אלקיך. נענו כולם ואמרו ה' אלקינו ה' אחד. ומשה אמר בשכמל\"ו עיי\"ש. הרי להדיא דשמע ואנכי אחת הן ממש. <strong>וזו היא שיטת רבינו הגאון והבה\"ג וסייעתו ז\"ל. ולכן לא מנו במנין תרי\"ג לא עשה דאנכי ולא עשה דשמע ישראל אלא מנו רק מ\"ע דק\"ש. דהיינו גופא מ\"ע דאנכי ומ\"ע דשמע ישראל שמנאום הראב\"ע והרמב\"ם ז\"ל וסייעתם</strong>. אלא דבזה יש חילוק בין רבינו הגאון ז\"ל להבה\"ג וסייעתו ז\"ל. דלהבה\"ג כל הדבור דלא יהי' לך וגו' מפי הגבורה שמענוהו. דכל הדבור כולו אע\"פ שיש בו ארבעה לאוין. לא חשיבי במנין תרי\"ג אלא במצוה אחת. וא\"כ מה שאמרו אנכי ולא יהי' לך מפי הגבורה שמענו ומשלימין שתי המצות החסרות מגימטריא של תורה. היינו לומר דשני דבורים אלו כל חדא חשיבא מצוה אחת. עשה ול\"ת. אבל לרבינו הגאון ז\"ל מה שאמרו אנכי ולא יהי' לך מפי הגבורה שמענו היינו עשה דאנכי שהיא כל דבור ראשון. ול\"ת דלא יהי' לך. אבל שאר השלשה לאוין שבדבור זה דלא יהי' לך מפי משה שמענום. ונמנין כל אחד בפ\"ע במנין תרי\"ג. <strong>וזכינו בזה להסיר התלונה הגדולה של הרמב\"ם ז\"ל מעל הגאונים ז\"ל הבה\"ג ורבינו וסייעתם. שטרחו כל הראשונים והאחרונים ז\"ל בתירוצה ולא סלקא להו כהוגן. דלפי מה שביארנו עיקר הקושיא מעיקרא ליתא</strong>:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially, he believes that the <strong>Bahag</strong> combines three <em>mitzvos</em> of the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s into one: Belief in Hashem [<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Positive_Commandments.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#1</a>], Unity of Hashem [<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Positive_Commandments.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#2</a>], and Reciting the Shema [<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Positive_Commandments.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#10</a>]. The <strong>Bahag</strong> (and <strong>Rav Saadiah Gaon</strong> for that matter) simply count it as the <em>mitzvah</em> of reciting the Shema, and it includes all three of these <em>mitzvos</em>. This again would make the <strong>Bahag</strong>'s <em>mitzvah</em> of reciting the Shema different than the <strong>Rambam</strong>'s.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, I've found two other seeming typos, where <strong>Rav Traube</strong> cross references <em>mitzvos</em> that are irrelevant. In one of those instances, he cross references the <strong>Rambam</strong>, and then in a footnote says it's one of the unique <em>mitzvos</em> of the <strong>Ramban</strong>. If those are typos, as it seems they are, this one could simply be as well.</p>\n\n<p>What's odd is Machon Yerushalayim brings commentaries from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azriel_Hildesheimer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Hildesheimer</strong></a> and <strong>Rav Yerucham Fishel Perla</strong>, who comment on <strong>Rav Traube</strong>. They don't point out any of these \"typos\". Also, if the second suggestion above was true, I would have thought <strong>Rav Perla</strong> would have commented on <strong>Rav Traube</strong>'s lack of a cross reference for the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>Shema</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Rambam's statement in Guide for the Perplexed 1:59 meant as a criticism of the Talmud?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 1:59 Rambam cites a Talmudic passage and introduces it with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You must surely know the following celebrated passage in the Talmud – <strong>would that all passages in the Talmud were like that!</strong> – although it is known to you, I quote it literally, as I wish to point out to you the ideas contained in it: (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp069.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is the meaning of the bolded line? At first glance it seems like a criticism of the Talmud, i.e. Rambam is lamenting that the rest of the Talmud is not like this passage, but inferior to it. However, it might instead mean that Rambam is lamenting that the rest of the Talmud is not as <em>celebrated</em> as this passage, i.e. he wishes the whole Talmud was as famous as this one famous passage. In that case it is not a criticism of the Talmud, but perhaps a criticism of the people who don't study the Talmud.</p>\n<p>The other renderings of this into Hebrew or English don't provide much more detail. The Pines translation has it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You also know their famous dictum – would that all dicta were like it. I shall quote it to you textually, even though it is well-remembered, so as to draw your attention to the various significations it expresses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ibn Tibbon translation has it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכבר ידעת אמרתם המפרסמת אשר מי יתן והיו כל המאמרים כמותה ואני אזכרה בלשונה ואף על פי שהיא ידועה להעירך על עניניה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Kafih translation has it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכבר ידעת אמרתם המפורסמת אשר מי יתן והיו כל האמרות כמוה והנני מזכירה לך כלשונה ואף על פי שהיא אמרה ידועה כדי להעירך על עניניה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Schwartz translation has it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכבר ידעת אמרתם המפורסמת אשר מי ייתן והיו כל האמרות כמותה אני אציין לך אותה כלשונה אף על פי שהיא אמרה שזוכרים אותה על מנת להסב את תשומת לבך אל משמעויותיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In each of these translations the statement can presumably be read in either of the aforementioned two ways.</p>\n<p>I know that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_B._Shapiro\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Professor Marc Shapiro</a> cited this passage as a criticism of the Sages:</p>\n<p><strong>The Limits of Orthodox Theology p. 37</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Occasionally, one even finds him subtly criticizing the talmudic sages: 'You also know their [the talmudic sages'] famous dictum – would that all [their] dicta were like it.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So is there any evidence as to whether this statement was meant as a criticism of the Sages or not? The evidence could be linguistic, contextual, based on how later sources understood it, etc.</p>\n<p>In case the context may help answer the question, the dictum under discussion is from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=33b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 33b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A certain [reader] went down in the presence of R.

He waited till he had finished, and when he had finished he said to him, Have you concluded all the praise of your Master? Why do we want all this? Even with these three that we do say,  had not Moses our Master mentioned them in the Law and had not the Men of the Great Synagogue come and inserted them in the Tefillah, we should not have been able to mention them, and you say all these and still go on! It is as if an earthly king had a million denarii of gold, and someone praised him as possessing silver ones.

In effect, he says that Maimonides did not give this passage his \"seal of approval\" at the expense of other passages in rabbinic literature; rather, Maimonides related to the fact that this passage taught in clear language what other passages taught parabolically, namely, that God was incorporeal.</p>\n<p>I am not convinced that Shem Toy succeeds in removing the \"sting\" from this comment of Maimonides. In no other place with which I am familiar does Maimonides bemoan the fact that the Rabbis saw fit to couch their philosophical perceptions in misleading, corporealist language.  If Shem Tov reads Maimonides correctly, then why, according to his understanding of Maimonides, did the Rabbis not teach true doctrines concerning God clearly and in every place? Clearly, they hid these doctrines because the[y] had to. But then why not here?</p>\n<p>No, I think that the conclusion cannot be avoided that Maimonides here is expressing approval for one rabbinic dictum and implied disapproval for for other dicta of the Rabbis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This quote is taken from an extensive section with the key point being Lechah dumiah sihilah (Silence is praise to thee). The gemara in question shows by example the inadequacy of verbiage in praise and prayer.</p>\n<p>\"A certain person, reading prayers in the presence of Rabbi Haninah, said, 'God, the great, the valiant and the tremendous, the powerful, the strong, and the mighty.'--The rabbi said to him, Have you finished all the praises of your Master? The three epithets, 'God, the great, the valiant and the tremendous,' we should not have applied to God, had Moses not mentioned them in the Law, and had not the men of the Great Synagogue come forward subsequently and established their use in the prayer; and you say all this! Let this be illustrated by a parable. There was once an earthly king, possessing millions of gold coin; he was praised for owning millions of silver coin; was this not really dispraise to him?\"</p>\n<p>HaRMBM, true to his ultimate intention, in essence feels that specific expressions in prayer (and praise) are extraneous, inaccurate, if not dilutive; thereby citing this gemara as intimating that perspective.</p>\n<p>In HaRmbm's own words:</p>\n<p>Thus far the opinion of the pious rabbi. Consider, first, how repulsive and annoying the accumulation of all these positive attributes was to him; next, how he showed that, if we had only to follow our reason, we should never have composed these prayers, and we should not have uttered any of them. It has, however, become necessary to address men in words that should leave some idea in their minds, and, in accordance with the saying of our Sages, \"The Torah speaks in the language of men,\" the Creator has been described to us in terms of our own perfections; but we should not on that account have uttered any other than the three above-mentioned attributes, and we should not have used them as names of God except when meeting with them in reading the Law.</p>\n<p>Bottom line - he would that all instructions regarding man's perception and description of H' be so constrained. So you can consider HaRMBM's perception of this gemara as either uniquely outstanding in this particular context, (he's not, e.g., considering a gemara such as whether or not one can ride a horse in the desert on Shabbos - lo plug) or what should be the norm and others are lacking. Either way, on a relative basis, there is a disparity which is certainly not complimentary.</p>\n\n\n",

But their keeping is not like our keeping.</p>\n\n<p>The key to understanding this is to realize that angels do not <em>keep</em> the Torah in the same way as human beings. In fact, this was the original proof which was given by Moshe Rabbeinu when the angels made their original objection to G-d about His giving the Torah to these lowly creatures of flesh and blood. The angels made their objection to G-d and G-d told Moshe Rabbeinu to answer them.</p>\n\n<p>Angels are in the general category of <em>Sichle'im</em> (Intelligences without material, corporeal existence). In that state of being their perception is far greater than that of humans. And so, from the perspective that the Torah is wisdom, a thing to be studied, learned and comprehended intellectually, angels are far more suited to have the Torah than human beings.</p>\n\n<p>But as Moshe pointed out as recounted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.88b.7-8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 88b-89a</a>, the ultimate purpose of the Torah is to engage with physical, material existence. This is something outside the domain  of angelic existence generally. Angels only connect to Torah in terms of study, not in terms of fulfillment of the commandments materially. And the general rule is that the fulfillment through physical, material action is the main purpose of the Torah (המעשה הוא העיקר) like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.17?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 1:17</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שִׁמְעוֹן בְּנוֹ אוֹמֵר, כָּל יָמַי גָּדַלְתִּי בֵין הַחֲכָמִים, וְלֹא מָצָאתִי לַגּוּף טוֹב אֶלָּא שְׁתִיקָה. <strong>וְלֹא הַמִּדְרָשׁ הוּא הָעִקָּר, אֶלָּא הַמַּעֲשֶׂה</strong>. וְכָל הַמַּרְבֶּה דְבָרִים, מֵבִיא חֵטְא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is why the angels were not <em>commanded</em> to keep the Torah, like the congregation of Israel is. They study Torah and continue to do so, but cannot fulfill its commandments. From the beginning of their creation, they have not been suited for it.</p>\n\n<p>This same principle is also one of the understandings about the offering of Nadav and Avihu. Even though it was <em>accepted</em>, it was not commanded. In kabbalistic language and the teachings of Chassidut, this is the concept of <em>Ratzu v'Shuv</em>, running toward G-d (to cleave to G-d) and returning (meaning connecting the result and effect of that cleaving to physical, material existence). As a consequence of their only fulfilling the Ratzu aspect, they were forfeit their lives (a soul dressed in a physical body). They were like angels. This is in keeping with what is taught in connection with the beginning of parshat Shemini 10:1-3 (see also Rashi to 10:3).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The problem, you see, is wrong assumptions! </p>\n\n<p>Your question begs the question: How can angels keep Torah if they do not exist? G-d is not a Pasha surrounded by servants that carry out the Pasha's commands. G-d has no need for assistants. Yes, tradition came up with the idea that there are angels, meaning messengers from G-d. But they should not be understood as figures outside natural law. Natural law is fixed and needs no change. If one wants to think of the existence of angels, think of the natural forces such as rain, snow, the laws of gravity, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to think of it is when we light the Shabbat candles before Shabbat begins. Similarly, the sun is always burning (giving off light) before and after Shabbat. A mitzvah? In a way, you could say it is keeping Shabbat (metaphorically) since it would be impossible to live without daylight. Yet it should be obvious that the stars do not keep kosher. I think they observe the Torah by obeying natural law, G-d's laws. In the beginning, G-d created or established the laws of nature to work throughout eternity. Natural law is fixed and needs no change. Thus, the stars or intelligence (as Maimonides calls it) are always observing the Torah. </p>\n\n\n",

According to R' Elyashiv and R' Chaim Kanievsky (Sefer Hilchos Chag Bechag Sefiras Haomer 6:11), Toch Kedei Dibur is a tool that can only be used to help the speaker, not harm him. As a result, saying the wrong phrase after the correct one for Sefiras Haomer does not ruin the correct Sefira (although as a precaution, one should repeat the correct Sefira without a Bracha).</p>\n\n<p>It seems like there are other opinions that hold Toch Kedei Dibur is an absolute power and undoes the previous statement in all scenarios, even to the detriment of the speaker (possibly the opinion of R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach*). In this case, if one had in mind during the Bracha to say the wrong count, then 'accidentally' said the correct count, and 'corrected' himself to the wrong count, it would seem that he did not fulfill the counting at all, and would need to recount (probably with a Bracha).</p>\n\n<p>However, even according to the latter opinion, there is an additional scenario by Sefiras Haomer that one could fulfill their obligation. If one did have in mind during the Bracha to count the correct day, and said the correct count, then 'corrected' himself to the wrong count Toch Kedei Dibur, he has fulfilled his obligation (I believe this is the case that is quoted in @user6591's answer above).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Note: the above answer is based on my understanding of footnote 67 of the Dirshu Mishna Berura on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.489.6?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.489&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berurah 489:32</a>.

I think that with contextualization, the answer to the case of the OP can be found through it.

His nusach was to include the count into the Beracha.

If the Beracha is wrong, there is nothing, no Beracha and not Sefira.</p>\n<p>Regarding the issue of an error about Beracha on foods, there are two main versions in the Text of the Gemara. Rashi says that the Gemara treats about a person who says the right Beracha, but at the time he said the Name of G-d, the intention was to say the wrong Beracha (פתח אדעתא...). The Rif said that the problem is different. He said the wrong Beracha and next the right Beracha (פתח בד... לסיים בד..). The Raavad rejects the rational of the girsa of Rashi because the cavana isn't so relevant for the beracha. The Gemara left the problem unsolved. For this unsolved problem, the Rif ruled by leniency, the Beracha is valid (followed by Bet Yosef OC 209). The Avi Ezri rules lechumra, in name of Rabenu Tam (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37766&st=&pgnum=11&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Raavia Siman 38</a> left column, third line), and he follows the Girsa of Rashi. The Bet Yosef OC 489 quotes the same din in the name of Mordechai and says that Sefirat Haomer is a Mitsva Deorayta and even according to the poskim they are lenient in berachot for foods, here, they need to be stringent. The Bet Yosef rules as other Rishonim that Sefirat Haomer is Derabanan.</p>\n<p>For the case he said right beracha and corrected wrong, the girsa of our Gemara didn't ask, not  in the Girsa of Rashi and not in the Girsa of the Rif reported by the Rosh. But the Rif cited in Baal Hamaor (and the girsaot Sefarad reported by the Raavad on the Baal Hamaor)  report the question of the Gemara differently. He brings a cup of bier, and begins right but ends wrong \"bore peri Hagafen\" is the question. See <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37952&st=&pgnum=335&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> Baal Hamaor, Raavad and Ramban. The Baal Hamaor rejects it because the Gemara says below that the chitum, the signature is the most important. And here the chitum is wrong. The Baal Hamaor follows the line of the Rif that the issue is correction when saying the Beracha. The Baal Hamaor decided this Girsa is wrong. There is no such question, the beracha is not valid obviously.</p>\n<p>The Ramban in Milchamot explains the safek:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שכבר השלים ברכתו כהלכה וחזרה בטעות שחזר וסיים שלא כראוי לא הויא חזרה לפסלה או דלמא אפילו בזו בתר חתימה אזלינן ולא יצא</p>\n<p>Since he finished his beracha correctly, what he said afterwards is not a correction to make it not valid, or, even if wrong, a correction cancels the first beracha and he is not yotse for the bier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rashba says this reasoning is so strong that he cancels the girsa of the Geonim. He cancels as the Baal Hamaor but for an opposite reason. . And the Rashba concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא פתח בדשיכרא וסיים בדחמרא מאי?   וזה דבר רחוק מאד שיהא הפסד בתוספת שהוסיף לאחר שסיים ברכתו, ואפילו אמר לאחר מכן כמה דברים.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The case is that he said a right Beracha and corrected it by a right Beracha. The Rashba rejects this Girsa, because it is not questionable. It is obvious that a right beracha cannot be altered by further additional words.</p>\n<p>Following this we can get a conclusion. In the case he counted the omer right and corrected wrong, he is Yotse, for the Rashba but not for the Baal Hamaor. And Ramban rules leKula as the Rashba because of Safek berachot Lehakel. All this assuming, as the Raavia that the count is a part of the beracha.</p>\n<p>Note: For us the count is not a part of the Beracha, because we have not the same nusach as the Raavia. So, I am a little surprised that Shulchan Aruch quoted the suggia from the Raavia.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכתב עוד אבי העזרי: היכא דפתח ואמר: \"ברוך אתה י\"י אלהינו מלך העולם\" אדעתא דלימא \"היום ארבעה\", שהוא סבור שהם ארבעה, ונזכר וסיים בחמש והן חמשה, מי אזלינן בתר פתיחה, וכיון דפתח אדעתא דלימא ארבעה לא נפיק, או דלמא בתר חתימה אזלינן, וכדין חתים ונפיק? ‏</p>\n<p>אי נמי איפכא, הם ד' ופתח אדעתא דלימא ארבעה, וטעה וסיים בה', מי אזלינן בתר פתיחה ונפיק, או בתר חתימה ולא נפיק? ומסתברא דבתרווייהו לא נפיק, דבעיא פתיחה וחתימה ודאי.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Perhaps he says this regarding חולדת הסנאים an animal who lives in bushes. polecat lives on the ground but is not a scavenger.

[... t]his identification was accepted by Maimonides, who gave the Arabic name of the hyena (Rambam. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.1.4?lang=bi&p2=Rambam_on_Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.1.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to the Mishna, Bava Kama 1:4)</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וברדלס הוא החיה הנקראת בלשון ערבי <strong>אלצבע</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Mongoose</strong><br />\nWhile in this [particular] passage (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.15b.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 15b</a>) the Talmud identifies the <em>bardelas</em> as the hyena, it seems that other references to the <em>bardelas</em> in the Talmud do not refer to this animal. Instead, they are apparently a corruption of the word <em>mandris</em>. This appears to refer to the mongoose or similar such creature.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Chuldah</h2>\n<p>Whereas there are differing opinions as to what the <em>bardelas</em> is, it seems to be the prevailing opinion that the <em>chuldah</em> is a weasel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.11.29?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Leviticus 11:29</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְזֶ֤ה לָכֶם֙ הַטָּמֵ֔א בַּשֶּׁ֖רֶץ הַשֹּׁרֵ֣ץ עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ <strong>הַחֹ֥לֶד</strong> וְהָעַכְבָּ֖ר וְהַצָּ֥ב לְמִינֵֽהוּ׃</p>\n<p>The following shall be unclean for you from among the things that swarm on the earth: the mole, <strong>the mouse</strong>, and great lizards of every variety;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.11.29?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Leviticus.11.29.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>החלד</strong>. מוש\"טילא:</p>\n<p>החלד — moustille in O.

See <a href=\"https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/leopard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>from earlier πάρδαλις (párdalis, “leopard”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Beis and Peh were flipped as was common in Mishnaic times. See for instance Tos. Yom Tov on Peah 6:6</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הבקר כמו הפקר. ששניהם הבי''ת והפ''א ממוצא השפה ומתחלפין:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A leopard is what is usually called a  נמר. Why would the Mishna in Bava Kamma 15b list both though?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והאדם הזאב והארי והדוב והנמר והברדלס והנחש הרי אלו מועדין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The term Pardelis was used for taxonomic purposes to identify anything spotted, such as Cervus camelopardalis, the 'camel leopard', aka giraffe.</p>\n\n<p>It would be safe to assume chazzal would also use the word to mean anything spotted. In fact נמר was also used by chazzal as a general term for spotted. See Menachos 29b about the 'spotted' seffer torah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א''ר יצחק בר שמואל בר מרתא משמיה דרב והוא דכתיב רוביה דספרא שפיר א''ל אביי לרב יוסף אי אית בההוא דף שלש טעיות מאי א''ל הואיל ואיתיהיב לאיתקוני מיתקן וה''מ חסירות אבל יתירות לית לן בה חסירות מ''ט לא אמר רב כהנא משום דמיחזי כמנומר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I would suggest since both terms for spotted creatures can be somewhat fluid, one of the two in the mishna would be the leopard, and one a different spotted creature. </p>\n\n<p>As the OP pointed out, the Bardeles seems to be a scavenger.\nAre there any spotted scavengers in the Levant? The <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_hyena\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">striped hyena</a> definitely fits the bill.</p>\n\n<p>So let's go with that. והנמר והברדלס translate as the leopard and the striped hyena, respectively.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why does a fresh convert retain his property?",
    "content": "# Why does a fresh convert retain his property?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems pretty obvious that a convert keeps his property. It is also Halachicly valid - a convert does not re-acquire his property back after conversion (see  <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Mishnah_Peah.4.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah_Peah.4.6 </a> or <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Mishnah_Challah.3.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah_Challah.3.6</a> thanks Heshy).</p>\n\n<p>But why? Here's how I reason: We hold that (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.48b.15?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevomos 48b</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גר שנתגייר כקטן שנולד דמי<br>\n  (a convert is like a newly born child)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A convert \"receives\" a new, Jewish soul. Therefore he loses his association with his \"former life\", for example, his affiliation with all his blood relatives<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>While a Gentile, he had property and now he's a new man, so I would assume his property is no longer associated with his former soul and is [a sort of] Hefker.</p>\n\n<p>So how come that he \"changes a soul\" but keeps all his possessions?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1 except for his biological kids for the Mitzvah of Pru Urvu </sup>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here's an interesting direction of thought:</p>\n<p>Many Gemmoros tie between one's property and Nefesh (\"lower\" soul), for example (B\"M 112a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואליו הוא נושא את נפשו כל הכובש שכר שכיר כאילו נוטל נפשו ממנו</p>\n<p>one who withholds the wages of a hired laborer, it is as though he takes his soul from him</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This motive is very popular in Judaism and is brought by Rambam and Shu\"A to explain the severity of monetary misbehavior. Having in mind, that the Jewish soul consists of 5 layers (Nefesh being the lowest - Nefesh, Ruach, Neshamah, etc - נרנח\"י) and the lower two are common with all humans,</p>\n<p><em>Maybe</em>, if we, based on that Gemmorah, say that the Mamon is linked to נפש דווקא, AND Gentiles have Nefesh, so when converting a gentile retains that part of the soul including all related Mamon. It's only the [Jewish] Nefesh (higher part of the soul) that's added and regarding that part, he's considered a newborn child.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While I liked this answer a lot I've found two <em>a bit contradicting</em> sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Some Gemmoros use the word נשמה instead of נפש (Brochos 119a). This can be explained by the Gemmorah being [very often] inexact, and the נפש version made its way to the Halachah.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The <em>Kabbalic</em> sources (that my Rabbi brings in Beys Gnozay) say, based on the Gemmorah \"התיר ממנם לישראל\" that gentile Mamon is not connected to their Nefesh part at all (supporting the approach that Gezel Akum is not forbidden Deorayso). If so, it just emphasizes my question - is the fact that a convert retains his Mamon only a Rabbinical decree?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The חות יאיר (סי׳ ע״ט) writes that גר שנתגייר כקטן שנולד דמי applies only to laws where a Jew and non-Jew are different. In any law where they are the same, he retains the <em>dinim</em> from his gentile days. Accordingly, he will retain his ownership, for property rights are equal to Jew and non-Jew alike.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is known that in Talmudic learning we cannot infer without discernment from the words of the Gemara, an inference is not an hazardous extrapolation. You cannot ask a question based on an hazardous extrapolation. A kushia needs a strong basis. If there is not a strong basis for the kushia, there is no difficulty to understand the pshat. You cannot infer from the Gemara 48 b regarding other topics.</p>\n<p>The Gemara you cited says that regarding Averot we reset the counter. You cannot infer nothing regarding property.</p>\n<p>Rashi says  that the convert is compared to a newborn because he will not be punished for his past behavior:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אינו נענש על העבר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A good illustration of the fact that to say that the convert is as a newborn is not an undifferentiated truth is the Machloket between Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish in daf 62a.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>היו לו בנים בהיותו עובד כוכבים ונתגייר ר' יוחנן אמר קיים פריה ורביה Rabbi Yochanan said that a convert who had children before his\nconversion, he has already left the Mitsva of piria verivia.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>וריש לקיש אמר לא קיים פריה ורביה Resh Lakish said he hasn't.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>רבי יוחנן אמר קיים פריה ורביה דהא הוו ליה Rabbi Yochanan says that he has already discharged his obligation because he has children</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>וריש לקיש אמר לא קיים פריה ורביה גר שנתגייר כקטן שנולד דמי Resh Lakish says he hasn't because a convert after his conversion is\ncomparable to a newborn</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ואזדו לטעמייהו דאיתמר היו לו בנים בהיותו עובד כוכבים ונתגייר רבי יוחנן אמר אין לו בכור לנחלה דהא הוה ליה ראשית אונו This controversy is\nbased on the same principle as an other controversy between RY and RL.\nA convert who has sons before the conversion has not Bechor regarding\nthe special status of bechor for inheritance, because the has already first\nborn</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>וריש לקיש אמר יש לו בכור לנחלה גר שנתגייר כקטן שנולד דמי Resh Lakish says he hasn't because he is comparable to a newborn</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>וצריכא דאי אשמעינן בההיא קמייתא בההיא קאמר רבי יוחנן משום דמעיקרא נמי בני פריה ורביה נינהו But despite that the two controversies are\nbased on the same principle, there is a need to teach both. Because\nwithout the second controversy, we could understand that the reason of\nRY is that regarding the Mitsva of Piria verivia only he is not as a\nnewborn because this mitsva was already relevant when he was not Jew\n(Rashi says that about Bene Noach, the Tora writes פרו ורבו, and\ntosfot explains that the chalenge is that his children are named after\nhim, and in the same sugya in Bechorot 47a, the Gemara says that it is from the mitsvatic point of view, they have the mitsva לשבת יצרה)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>אבל לענין נחלה דלאו בני נחלה נינהו אימא מודי ליה לריש לקיש But regarding the rules of inheritance, Bene Noach have not the rules of inheritance, so\nhe is as as a new man regarding the inheritance's rules (Rashi explains that\nthey have rules of inheritance, but different from our, e.g. daughters inherit\nas sons, and first born son as second son)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ואי איתמר בהא בהא קאמר ריש לקיש אבל בההיא אימא מודה ליה לר' יוחנן צריכא and if the second controversy was taugth without the first, we\nmight think that RL agrees to RY that regarding Piria verivia the\nconvert is not as a new man</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>איתיביה ר' יוחנן לר\"ל (מלכים ב כ, יב) בעת ההיא שלח בראדך בלאדן בן בלאדן מלך בבל וגו' Rabbi Yochanan gives a proof that there is a link\nof affiliation between father and son for non Jew from a verse</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>א\"ל בהיותן עובדי כוכבים אית להו חייס נתגיירו לית להו חייס RL says that despite that there is a link of affiliation before the conversion,\nit lapses from the moment when he converts</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this Gemara we learn that from the second controversy in which RL argues that a convert is as a newborn regarding rules of inheritance, we cannot infer what he said in the second controversy regarding mitsvat Piria verivia.</p>\n<p>So, there is no source to innovate that he loses his property.</p>\n<p>However in Kiddushin 17b, the Gemara infers from the Mishna Demai 6.10 that a convert doesn't inherit his non Jew father Deorayta.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גר את העובד כוכבים אינו מדברי תורה אלא מדברי סופרים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The svara of the comparison to a newborn (it's my understanding) is that a man when he converts is not less attached to himself than before the conversion. When he converts he became detached from the attachment to the non Jew world. He detaches himself, but he remains himself. His body is the same body, the property is an extension of the body. On the contrary, when he converts he is more close to his true ego. The world of falsehood to which he was linked and that was keeping him far from the truth is detached from him. Now he is not an artificial man, but a man more genuine, attached to what a man is. It is similar to Teshuva, David Hamelech asked to G-d לב חדש ברא לי please create for me a new hearth.</p>\n<p>Note: an interesting expression in Yevamot 23a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אדרבה שפחה ועובדת כוכבים הוה ליה לרבות דאי מגיירה לדידיה נמי תפסי בה קדושין לכי מגיירה גופא אחרינא היא</p>\n<p>On the contrary, they needs to add a slave and a non Jewish woman, because if she converts, he can marry her by Kiddushin, the Gemara answer: If she convert, she is an other body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Dr. JJ Schacter in <a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/_pdfs/164-197%20Schacter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Tradition article</a> describes some of the opposition to establishing a day mourning the (at the time ongoing) Shoah as follows (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Herzog inquired whether R. [Yitzhak Ze'ev] Soloveichik would support the establishment of a “day of mourning (<em>yom evel</em>)” for the tragedy and destruction that was occurring in Europe... R. Soloveichik opposed R. Herzog’s initiative, basing his objection on a passage in one of the <em>kinot</em> recited on <em>Tish’a be-Av</em> dealing with the Crusades. The author of this <em>kina</em>, entitled “<em>Mi yiten roshi mayim</em>,” describes the devastation of the German communities of Speyer, Worms, and Mainz caused by the Crusaders at the end of the eleventh century. The <em>kina</em> is explicitly historical in orientation and notes the specific dates when the destruction of these Jewish communities took place: Speyer on the eighth of Iyyar, Worms on the twenty-third of that month and again on the first of Sivan, and Mainz two days later. Its author then addresses the question of why a <em>kina</em> about the destruction wrought by the Crusades is recited on <em>Tish’a be-Av</em> if, as he just explicitly indicated, it did not occur on—or even within two months of—that day. His answer is clear and instructive: “Since one may not add a time [to commemorate] destruction and conflagration . . . therefore today [i.e., <em>Tish’a be-Av</em>] I will raise my cries of woe (<em>Ve-khi ein le-hosif mo’ed shever ve-tav’era . . . tahat ken ha-yom livyati a’oreira</em>).” <strong>One cannot institute new days of commemoration for tragedies that followed the destructions of the Temples. There is one day in the Jewish calendar designated to commemorate Jewish tragedy and that day is <em>Tish’a be-Av</em>.</strong> Mourning for—and commemoration of—all subsequent Jewish tragedies are to take place on that date and on that date alone, wrote the author of this <em>kina</em>. As a result, argued R. Soloveichik, no special day of commemoration was established for the destruction wrought by the Crusaders; the appropriate day on which to remember this tragedy is <em>Tish’a be-Av</em>. He applied the principle deliniated in this <em>kina</em> in the context of the Crusades to the situation he was facing in 1942-1943. On the basis of this statement, he concluded that establishing a special day of mourning for the growing number of Jews being exterminated in Europe would be inappropriate and contrary to Jewish tradition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Leah was the first person to show gratitude over a ‘natural’ experience – i.e. the act of having four children.

And, in harmony with these matters, I elucidate great, general principles of the works of the Lord of the universe, so that they might serve as an opening for one who understands by which to love the Name, as some sages said on the subject of love: \"Out of it thou wilt recognize the One who spoke, and the universe was called into existence.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is an excellent question and forms the basis of the end of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029136/jewish/Chapter-49.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 49</a> and the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1029143/jewish/Chapter-50.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 50</a> in section one, Likkutei Amarim of the Tanya by the Alter Rebbe, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, discussing the 2nd blessing preceding the recital of Shema where he explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To quote [again] \"As water mirrors the reflection of a face\": As the\n  Holy One, blessed be He, has, as it were, laid down and set aside,\n  figuratively speaking, His great infinite light, and has stored it\n  away and concealed it by means of three different kinds of\n  \"contractions\"— and <strong>all this because of His love for lowly man, in\n  order to raise him up to G‑d, for \"Love impels the flesh,\"</strong> how much\n  more, and an infinite number of times more, is it fitting that a man\n  also should relinquish and set aside all he possesses, both\n  spiritually and physically, and renounce everything in order to cleave\n  to Him, may He be blessed, with attachment, desire and longing,\n  without any hindrance, within or without, neither of body nor soul,\n  nor money, nor wife and children.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Thereby will be understood the true reason and meaning of the\n  Rabbinical enactment, ordaining the recitations of the blessings of\n  the Shema:</strong> two preceding it.... For it would appear, at first glance,\n  that they have no connection whatever with the recital of the Shema,\n  as \"Rashba\" and other codifiers have stated. Why, then, were they\n  termed \"Blessings of the Shema?\" And why were they ordained to to be\n  recited specifically before it?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>But the reason is that the essence of the recital of the Shema is to\n  fulfil the injunction \"With all thine heart</strong>,...\" to wit, \"With both\n  thy natures,...\" <strong>that is to say, to overcome anything that deters from\n  the love of G‑d.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and continues...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then follows the second blessing, \"With an everlasting love hast Thou\n  loved us, O Lord, our G‑d.\" That is to say, that He set aside all the\n  supernal, holy hosts and caused His Shechinah to dwell upon us, so\n  that He be called \"Our G‑d,\" in the same sense that He is called \"The\n  G‑d of Abraham,\" <strong>as explained earlier. This is because \"love impels\n  the flesh.\" Therefore it is called ahavat olam (\"worldly love\"),</strong> for\n  this is the so-called \"contraction\" of His great and infinite light,\n  taking on the garb of finitude, which is called olam (\"world\"), for\n  the sake of the love of His people Israel, in order to bring them near\n  to Him, that they might be absorbed into His blessed Unity and\n  Oneness.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is also the meaning of \"With great and exceeding pity [hast Thou\n  pitied us],\" namely, exceeding the nearness of G‑d towards all the\n  hosts above; \"... and us hast Thou chosen from every people and\n  tongue,\" which refers to the material body which, in its corporeal\n  aspects, is similar to the bodies of the gentiles of the world; \"And\n  Thou hast brought us near... to give thanks,...\"— the interpretation\n  of \"thanks\" will be given elsewhere;\"... and proclaim Thy Unity,.. .\"—\n  to be absorbed into His blessed Unity, as has been explained above.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the intelligent person will reflect on these matters in the\n  depths of his heart and brain, then— as [surely as] water mirrors the\n  image of a face— his soul will spontaneously be kindled and it will\n  clothe itself in a spirit of benevolence, willingly to lay down and\n  resolutely to abandon all he possesses, in order only to cleave unto\n  Him, may He be blessed, and to be absorbed into His light with an\n  attachment and longing, and so forth, in a manner of \"osculation\"\n  (נשיקין ) and the attachment of spirit to spirit, as has been\n  explained earlier.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>But how does the attachment of spirit to spirit take place? To this\n  end it is stated [further on]: \"And these words shall be ... upon\n  thine heart.

The first that came to my mind is R. Ovadia's famous ruling (<em>Yabia Omer</em> vol. 6, <em>Even Ha-Ezer</em> #3) that widows of soldiers missing during the 1973 Yom Kippur War not be considered <em>agunot</em>, a ruling that would allow those widows to remarry. </p>\n\n<p>The psak is quite weighty, in which he takes pains to explain this unprecedented ruling of looking for leniency. The story behind this ruling has been covered by various historians, but here is how R. Ovadia's daughter, Adina Bar Shalom, <a href=\"https://jewishaction.com/jewish-world/people/abba-rav-ovadia/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">described his experience</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He questioned the soldiers who served with the men missing in action. With each testimony, he cried. He couldn’t eat during those days, didn’t drink, didn’t sleep, could not close his eyes, until he gave a heter to every one of the wives whose husbands were missing. There were nearly 960 widows resulting from the Yom Kippur War. For many, the bodies of their husbands were found and identified. But [in those cases] where the bodies could either not be found or identified, as a result of my father’s pesak and thorough investigation of each and every case, not one woman was left an agunah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The lengthy psak itself begins with R. Ovadia clarifying the weight behind this undertaking, in which he discloses his emotions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונפשי יודעת מאד גודל האחריות שבדבר, וכבד עלי הדבר מאד מקוצר המשיג ועומק המושג, אולם נתתי אל לבי מ\"ש הרב הפוסק בשו\"ת הב\"ח החדשות (ס\"ס סד) בפס\"ד להיתר עגונה, להתיר בחינה קטנה שבבחינת העגונה הגדולה, שעליה אמר שלמה: ראיתי דמעת העשוקים ואין להם מנחם וכל מי שמתיר עגונה אחת בזה\"ז כאילו בנה אחת מחרבות ירושלים העליונה להציל בחינה אחת מאשת חיל</p>\n  \n  <p>My soul knows the enormity of this responsibility, and it is very heavy for me with insufficient knowledge of the concept. But I gave my heart in this...to permit in this great matter of agunot. As Solomon said: I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comfort (Eccl. 4:1). Anyone who permits one agunah in this time, it is as if he rebuilt one of Jerusalem's ruins (Brakhot 6b), to save a woman of valor. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=43&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 43a</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ליה רב חסדא לרב יצחק האי משחא דאפרסמון מאי מברכין עלויה א\"ל הכי אמר רב יהודה בורא שמן ארצנו א\"ל בר מיניה דר' יהודה דחביבא ליה ארץ ישראל לכולי עלמא מאי א\"ל הכי אמר רבי יוחנן בורא שמן ערב</p>\n<p>R. Hisda said to R. Isaac: What blessing is said over this balsam-oil? — He replied: Thus said Rab Judah: 'Who createst the oil of our land',  He then said to him: <strong>Leaving out Rab Judah, who dotes on the Land of Israel</strong>, what do ordinary people say? — He replied: Thus said R.

Does anyone have an explanation for it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The phrase \"<strong>כל הקרב הקרב כי לא לחנם הלך זרזיר אצל עורב</strong>\" is found in a couple places in Shas (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.65a.6?lang=bi&with=Steinsaltz&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 65a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.92b.13?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 92b</a>) and can literally be translated as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>not for naught that the zarzir went to dwell with the crow, but because it is of the same species</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ie- birds of a feather flock together.</p>\n<h3>Now</h3>\n<p>It's very easy to see how this can be construed as sexist, misogynistic, and demeaning- \"<strong>we're going to learn Shabbos laws about animals followed by women since 'birds of a feather flock together</strong>?!'\"</p>\n<p>This seems outrageous!</p>\n<h2>HOWEVER</h2>\n<p>I think it has a more innocent meaning. Namely, it's comparing animals and women because we're learning Shabbos laws that <strong>pertain to one's household</strong>. Animals, women, kids, one's elder paents possessions- all these are part of one's household. So the verse can understood as: \"since we discussed one area of the household, lets discuss another area of the household.\"</p>\n<h3>BOTTOM LINE:</h3>\n<p>While it may be misconstrued (and may not make for the greatest line in today's climate) I think this line was said lightheartedly and not intending to offend.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The reference is the Gemara in Chulin (65a) which discusses that two seemingly different birds are of the same species (min), and they therefore are found near each other. The same thing applies here. In both chapters the laws are enumerated to prevent override biblical law. The woman, because of her very nature may be more susceptible to carrying in public domain, a biblical offense. The same applies to the animal. Its very nature may also cause certain biblical law to be easily broken, like the aforementioned as well as the requirement for the animal to rest on the sabbath. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Indeed, you are misunderstanding the comparison. </p>\n\n<p>The comparison is between the very similar categories of laws discussed in the two chapters. Both chapters are uniquely about whether the laws of carrying on Shabbos apply to wearing various kinds of things; the fifth chapter is about what animals might \"wear\" (bridles, collars, saddles, bells, etc.), and the sixth chapter is about what humans might wear (with examples that tend to be specific to men - such as phylacteries, examples that tend to be specific to women - such as various kinds of feminine jewelry, and plenty of examples that tend to apply equally to both men and women). </p>\n\n<p>The comparison is not between women and animals at all, it just so happens that the chapters are named after their first words. The <em>Shabbos Shel Mi</em> is comparing the chapters which he mentions by their full names (\"With What May an Animal [go out]...\" and \"With What May a Woman [go out]...\", respectively). The <em>zarzir</em> bird and the crow that flock together are the two similar categories of laws whose chapters are juxtaposed in this tractate.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Logic behind אם אינו ענין\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Every now and again Chazal use a method of exegesis of the form </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם אינו ענין ל___ תנהו לענין ___‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which means that if a word or phrase is extra, due to the halacha it apparently teaches being already taught from another word or phrase, we learn a different halacha, which has less to do with the plain meaning of the text, from it. (Sefaria shows <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/search?q=%D7%90%D7%9D%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95%20%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9F&tab=text&tpathFilters=Talmud%2FBavli%2FSeder%20Moed|Talmud%2FBavli%2FSeder%20Nashim|Talmud%2FBavli%2FSeder%20Nezikin|Talmud%2FBavli%2FSeder%20Kodashim|Talmud%2FBavli%2FSeder%20Tahorot&tvar=0&tsort=chronological&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">63 places in Shas Bavli</a> which apply this principle; some of these lines use it multiple times.)</p>\n\n<p>This form of exegesis seems to take on one of two main forms:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Based on the second word or phrase, we're forced to interpret the first one differently.</strong> Ex. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.70a.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 70a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חילוק מלאכות מנלן אמר שמואל אמר קרא מחלליה מות יומת התורה רבתה מיתות הרבה על חילול אחד האי במזיד כתיב אם אינו ענין למזיד דכתיב כל העשה מלאכה יומת תנהו ענין לשוגג ומאי יומת יומת בממון</p>\n  \n  <p>How do we know differentiation of melachos [i.e. that if one forgot it was Shabbos and performed multiple melachos he brings a Karban for each one]? Shmuel said, \"The passuk says, 'Its desecrators will surely be put to death.' The Torah includes many deaths for one desecration.\" But this is written regarding an intentional violation! <strong>If its topic isn't for intentional violations,</strong> as it is written, \"Whoever does melacha will be put to death,\" <strong>place its topic for unintentional violations. And what does 'he will be put to death' mean? He will \"die\" through money.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>2. Based on the second word or phrase, we apply the first one to a different topic entirely.</strong> Sometimes we apply it to a specific topic, ex. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.95a.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 95a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי אמי אמר ריש לקיש מאי טעמא דרבי יהודה דכתיב באש ישרפו אותו ואתהן וכי כל הבית כולו בשרפה אם אינו ענין לשרפה תנהו ענין לאיסורא</p>\n  \n  <p>R' Ami said in the name of Reish Lakish: What is the reasoning of R' Yehudah [that if one is intimate with his mother-in-law, his wife is also forbidden to him]? As it is written, \"In fire they will be burned - he and they.\" Should the entire house be burned?! [Only one of the women actually sinned!] <strong>If its topic isn't for the burning, place its topic for the prohibition.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sometimes we don't apply this to any one specific topic, but rather all of them, ex. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.43a.3-5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 43a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גלי רחמנא בשחוטי חוץ דם יחשב לאיש ההוא דם שפך הוא ולא שלוחו אשכחן גבי שחוטי חוץ בכל התורה מנלן דיליף משחוטי חוץ אדיליף משחוטי חוץ ניליף מהנך הדר כתב רחמנא ונכרת האיש ההוא אם אינו ענין לגופו תנהו ענין לכל התורה כולה</p>\n  \n  <p>[How do we know that there is no agency by sins?] The Torah revealed by slaughtering [offerings] outside [the Beis HaMikdash], \"Blood will it be considered for that man, blood has he spilled.\" \"[For] that [man],\" and not for his agent. We have found this by slaughtering outside; how do we know by the rest of the Torah? We learn it from slaughtering outside. But the same way that we learn it from slaughtering outside, learn it from these [exceptions wherein there <em>is</em> agency by sins]! The Torah then writes, \"That man will be cut off.\" <strong>If its topic is not for itself, place its topic for the entire Torah.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The way I understand this principle is that, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18799/\">at least exegetically speaking</a>, there are no extra terms in the Torah. Thus, if we find a term that seems to be extra, we're forced to ascribe meaning to it. </p>\n\n<p>What I don't understand is the second variation of this, wherein they don't even bother explaining how their new understanding of the text makes sense in context, nor how they know that their understanding is correct. <strong>Is there any rhyme or reason behind the application of this principle in these contexts?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

When one decides instead to take pleasure from one of the physical levels of pleasure (eating, art, etc.), not only is he not fulfilling his purpose on this world, but he is also dragging himself down to the level of animals!

For example a convert or a woman after her period or a male who would want to enter the Temple Mount can't go and pour <em>9 kavin</em> of water upon themselves instead of a <em>mikveh.</em> There were 10 decrees of Ezra (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Kamma.82a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kama 82a</a>), among them the last one requiring a <em>baal keri</em> (person having a seminal emission) to go to the <em>mikveh</em> before engaging in prayer. This requirement is discussed at length from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.21b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot 21b</a>, and the conclusion is that in certain cases it is not necessary to go to the <em>mikveh.</em> In the case of nocturnal emission, one can pour these <em>9 kavin</em> of water instead of going to a <em>mikveh</em> in order to resume prayer even while still impure, which is roughly equivalent of 4 minutes of a shower, according to <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2014/03/16/shower-for-9-kabin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">certain opinions</a>.

Indeed there is a difference of point of view between Raavia and Rambam if there is a prohibition to eat a priori foods that are not edible on Yom Kippur.  Saliva enters in this category of foods. So the Aguda allows it a priori (<em>lechatechilla</em>). Aditionally the Bach tells about a great amount of saliva (a half full mouth). For a small amount of saliva, the Bach proves from Rashi Shabbat 70 that there is not called eating at all. But for a great volume of saliva, it seems that the Bach prohibits because we don't hold as Raavia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The Mishna Berura quotes the Magen Avraham.

The mishna on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.81a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 81a</a> says that one who eats them is patur.

The Bet Yosef writes that the Rambam disagrees and there is <em>makkas mardus</em>. Poskim hold as the Rambam.<br />\n<strong>The chiddush of the Magen Avraham is that when he swallows his saliva without intention to drink even following the line of the Rambam there is no prohibition.</strong> After the lecture of the Bach I understand that he tells about a great amount of saliva.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=386\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dailyhalacha.com</a> also raises this question re: Yom Kippur (unfortunately doesn't give exact links to sources, but presumably some are cited in R' @<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/9215/kouty\">kouty</a>'s answer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... there is an interesting discussion amongst the Acharonim, and even the Rishonim discuss it. The question discussed asks if it is permissible to swallow saliva on Yom Kippur? A whole discussion is brought about whether or not saliva is considered a food. The opinion of the <strong>Agudah</strong> [states that] <strong>clearly</strong> <strong>it’s permissible</strong>. He considers it as a food, but not really a food that is consumed, so he doesn’t have a problem with it. Others don’t even consider it a food at all. Some Rabbis want to say like the <strong>Chatam Sofer</strong>, whereas he makes a difference between the night and the morning. He says that at night, you should avoid swallowing saliva, since your saliva will still have the flavor of the food that you ate at the Seuda Mafseket. But on the next day, he says, you don’t have any problem, and you can swallow your saliva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Dailyhalacha.com</strong> concludes by writing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Halacha, our Poskim all say clearly, that <strong>it is permissible to swallow the saliva on Yom Kippur</strong>. Of course, one should not have Kavana (concentration) to collect the saliva in his mouth and then swallow it in order to somehow quench his thirst or something like that. One should be careful not to have Kavana. Pray normally, and don’t be pre-occupied with your swallowing, and you will have no problems. <strong>The Halacha, it is permissible to swallow the saliva on Yom Kippur</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously if it is ok to swallow one's saliva on Yom Kippur it can be extended to any fast. </p>\n\n\n",

So, if you are in a place where there are no Torah leaders or Talmidei Chachamim, and you are able to be one and be the community leader, you should do this.</p>\n\n<p>However, this notion seems to conflict with Rav Nehora's precept in Avot 4:14 that says that one should exile himself to a place of Torah.</p>\n\n<p>My question is both in terms of understanding these two seemingly contradictory precepts as well as its applications today.</p>\n\n<p>If someone currently lives in a place where there is no Torah leadership of any form, and the majority of Jews living there are secular, unobservant and uneducated, and this person feels that he could establish a Torah community and be the leader, should he attempt to do this, in line with Hillel's advice? Or, should he follow Rav Nehora's advice and go to an already established place?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, an analogous situation, today, is when Chaba\"d decides to send a shaliach who, say, has lived near 770 and they send him to a place that has no Torah leadership to establish a new community. </p>\n\n<p>In summary, In viewing these two precepts, when should one enact one precept vs. the other?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I personally think that the answer is pretty simple. It doesn’t say to purposely go to ‘a place where there are no men’. But if you do happen to be in that situation, remember to be a man and act properly, and as a role model to others. It’s best to remain in an environment of Torah of course, unless specifically going out on shlichus.\nAlso, throughout pirkei avos, it simply teaches us life lessons on all aspects in life, it never says to pick one side over another. After all, from the first part of the second perek, we learn to keep a balance in life.\nThese are my thoughts on your question, I hope what I’ve said may be helpful to you.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Shimon said: if their sin came to their knowledge before they were appointed they are liable, but if after they were appointed they are exempt. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first sentence, presumably the position of the rabbis, makes sense to me: when they transgressed they were laymen, so they bring the offering of a layman.  (On the other end, though, once a <em>kohein gadol</em>, always a <em>kohein gadol</em> -- even if he steps down and then transgresses, he brings the larger offering.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Shimon's position, however, confuses me.  He <em>doesn't</em> say that, in contrast to the first statement, they bring the offering that matches their current position; rather, he says they're exempt entirely.  Why is that?  It seems counter to pretty much everything the torah says about how we atone for transgressions.</p>\n\n<p>I reviewed the g'mara on this passage but don't understand the argument.  It starts by reasoning from the \"after\" case and talks about different kinds of errors for the ruler, and also talks about heavenly plagues (punishments), but I'm having trouble following it.</p>\n\n<p>What is Rabbi Shimon's reasoning (or anyone else's who holds like him) for exempting someone entirely from atoning for a transgression?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.15a.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi to this Mishnah</a> brings two explanations for R’ Shimon’s opinion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חברייא אמרין טעמא דר\"ש משם שהגדולה מכפרת אמר ר' יוסי שאין חטאו וידיעתו שוין</p>\n  \n  <p>The Chaveirim say: The reason for R’ Shimon is because his stature atones. R’ Yosi said: because his sin and knowledge aren’t the same. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is to say: According to the Chaveirim, that he becomes a Nasi in and of itself atones for his sin; a Karban Chatas is unnecessary (compare <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bikkurim.11b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Bikkurim 3:3</a>). According to R’ Yosi, it’s because the sin and knowledge thereof didn’t take place in the same category (i.e. the former was before he became Nasi, while the latter was after he became Nasi); since both are needed to qualify for any particular type of Karban Chatas, he doesn’t fit in any of the boxes which would obligate him in any particular type of Karban Chatas (this seems to be how <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Horayot.10a.5.1-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yachin_on_Mishnah_Horayot.3.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiferes Yisrael</a> understand this opinion). </p>\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi notes that a practical difference between these two approaches would be whether R’ Shimon argues on the previous Mishnah as well, where he sinned as a Nasi but only realized it after he was demoted. According to the Chaveirim, he would still be obligated, as there was nothing with which to gain atonement, while according to R’ Yosi, he would still be exempt, as the two still didn’t happen in the same stature. </p>\n\n\n",

Prior to communities adopting uniform rules, it appears the Rabbis had quite varied opinions on when it was acceptable to consume milk after meat.  </p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam's tradition, for example, would be considered not kosher by the frum community today (see, for example: Tosfot Chullin 104b quoting Rabbeinu Tam and Bahag, holding that there’s no minimum amount of time -- one only needs to wash one’s hands and wash out one’s mouth.  The Taz (89:2) cites an explanation of the practice of some to wait one hour between meat and milk as a \"compromise\" (suggesting a big enough divide if acknowledged like this) between the opinion of Tosafists who holds that Birkat Hamazon is the only boundary needed between the two meals and the Rambam who believes that we must wait approximately six hours.  Indeed, if someone ate meat and forgot, and within the 6 hours he picked up a glass of milk, and he made ‘Shehakol Nehiye Bidvaro’ Ovadia Yosef discusses this question in Yichave Da’at and says as follows if a person made this mistake, he definitely should taste from the milk, because the other option of not tasting brings a bigger problem of Beracha Livatala. He is lenient on the law of 6 hours because opinions of those in the camp of the Tosafot that hold that the law of 6 hours does not even apply and that you are not allowed to eat milk and meat in the same Seuda but outside the same Seuda, it’s OK. </p>\n\n<p>Was there a point in time or major event that led to such conformity on a topic that had such diversity in opinion amongst early halachic leaders?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You asked:</p>\n\n<p><strong>At what point in Jewish history did waiting 6 hours between milk and meat become the uniform approach in most communities (or in some places 1 hour or 3 hours)?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://kotzkblog.blogspot.com/2015/11/kotzk-blog-63-how-karaites-unwittingly_4.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> it was the Rif (Rabbi Yitzchak Alfasi 1013-1103) who instituted the fixed waiting time.</p>\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"http://kotzkblog.blogspot.com/2015/11/kotzk-blog-63-how-karaites-unwittingly_4.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the article</a> for sources and background.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Baby brought from beyond the techum on Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a baby was brought from beyond the techum on Shabbos, would that baby be muktzeh God forbid, or would it be permitted to carry it because a living thing carries itself.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The laws of objects, animals, or people coming from beyond the \"Techum\" (Boundary) on Shabbos, do not apply to a living human baby.</p>\n\n<p>1) A live baby is not an object or animal. It is a person. People are not in the category of \"muktzeh\" or \"objects\" unless they are dead or Halachically considered dead.</p>\n\n<p>People who have traveled on Shabbos beyond 2000 amos (about 4000 feet) from their city, or who started Shabbos in a wilderness spot etc. are restricted from travelling further on that Shabbos. Sometimes this restriction is measured strictly in a radius of about 8 feet around the person's position. (Dalet Amos).</p>\n\n<p>The question of a living thing carrying itself, has no relation to the laws of \"Techum\". The prohibition of carrying on Shabbos is a separate law. Techum applies even if the person was carried, or simply walked beyond the limit without being carried.</p>\n\n<p>2) Even though people who violate the Techum have certain travelling restrictions placed on them, these rules apply to adults or minors who are old enough to be obligated in such Mitzvah observance. A baby is not expected to observe these laws since obviously it has no capacity to understand them and is not responsible etc. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the restrictions of Techum are not limits on specific activities, but rather limits on further travel. So one is perfectly allowed to attend to the baby.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Halachah would not penalize an adult from attending to the baby, because that would render the baby helpless. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Halachah does not penalize babies who \"transgress\". :)</strong></p>\n\n<p>3) It is our obligation to protect and help a baby. The consideration to provide constant care for the child is primary in this case (and most cases in Halachah). A baby is certainly more deserving of leniency, since small things a baby needs may actually create life threatening situations.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in general, one faced with a Halachic question (and a qualified Rabbi is not available) which would deprive a baby of its needs, should usually err on the side of caution and common sense, and grant the baby what it needs first, and then ask the Rabbi later when you find him.</p>\n\n<p>However, one should learn the laws well and strive to have access to a qualified Rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>4) Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 406:1 states that someone who unknowingly violated the Techum, may have their restrictions lifted and may travel if they need to seek a proper place to use as a bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>The Kaf HaChaim comments here, that the allowance is not just for a bathroom but for shelter from the rain or if the person is uncomfortable in the heat etc.</p>\n\n<p>His words are: \"Great is the honor of people that a negative commandment is pushed aside.\" </p>\n\n<p>The source is the Talmud Eiruvin 41b. The Sages of Nehardea also explain there, that a person who is restricted outside the Techum, should be clever and seek a bathroom spot close to the city area, and then once there, we allow him to come back since he is already there. </p>\n\n<p>Also, see S.A. O.C. 404:1 with Rema. The Rema explains that one who arrived (and there it does not call the violation \"unknowing\") by boat on Shabbos, may leave the boat and enter the city due to various discomforts.</p>\n\n<p>From this we can learn out by comparison,  that a baby's discomfort is obviously grounds to lift any restrictions of \"Techum\".</p>\n\n<p>Of Course, if the parents and baby have no discomfort and can fulfill all the laws of Techum without further danger or discomfort, then they should act normally as in any Halachic situation.</p>\n\n<p>For further understanding of the Laws of Techum, see Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 396 - 416.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Standing in the presence of an idol / entering a room which has an idol\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The question is remarkably simple (even though the answer may not be so).</p>\n\n<p>Is it allowed by halacha to stand in the presence of an idol or enter a room where an idol is present ?</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, I'm reffering to visiting the house of a xian friend or relative which has xian icons and crosses. The house is adorned with such objects. </p>\n\n<p>The best source I could find regarding to this is in Avodah Zarah, and at first glance it seems to suggest that it is permissible, but the tractate describes a specific example which is not my situation per se.</p>\n\n<p>Mishnah, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Avodah_Zarah.3.4?ven=Open_Mishnah&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 3:4</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Proklos son of Plosfos asked Rabban Gamliel [a question] in Akko,\n  while he was bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite. He said to him:\n  \"It is written in your Torah (Deuteronomy 13:18): 'And let none of the\n  condemned cling to your hand;' why then are you bathing in the\n  bathhouse of Aphrodite? He said to him: one does not respond [to\n  halakhic questions] in the bathhouse. When he left, he said to him: \"I\n  did not come into her territory; she came into my territory. They did\n  not say [when they built this bathhouse]: 'Let us make a beautiful\n  bathhouse for Aphrodite.' Rather, they said: 'Let us make Aphrodite\n  for the beauty of the bathhouse.' Another reason: [even] if they gave\n  you a lot of money, you would not enter before your idolatry naked and\n  defiled and urinating in front of it. Yet she stands on the sewer pipe\n  and the entire nation urinates in front of her. The verse (Deuteronomy\n  12:3) only applies to \"their gods;\" that which he treats like a god is\n  prohibited, and that which he does not treat like a god is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.44b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 44b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abaye said: The deception in Rabban Gamliel’s response was from here,\n  when he said to him: I did not come into its domain, but rather it\n  came into my domain. He explains: And even if it, the bathhouse, had\n  come into its domain, what of it? Even if the idol had preceded the\n  bathhouse, it would still not render use of the bathhouse prohibited;\n  but didn’t we learn in a mishna (51b): With regard to an object of\n  idol worship that has a bathhouse or a garden in front of it, one may\n  derive benefit from the bathhouse or garden without showing favor by\n  giving thanks or payment to its priests, but one may not derive\n  benefit from it while showing it favor? Rabban Gamliel’s answer was\n  therefore deceptive because the permissibility of using the bathhouse\n  had nothing to do with its antecedence to the statue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These two passages taken together make it seem that it is permissible to enter a place (garden, bathhouse) which houses an idol, provided that</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It is not specifically a house of worship (pagan temple, church, etc);</li>\n<li>You do not worship or give thanks to the idol in any way.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Women standing for their husbands when called up for an Aliyah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have noticed women in several sefardic communities to stand while their husbands are called up to the synagogue. Yalkut Yosef in Hilkhot Shavuot brings down the halakha of a child or a student standing up for the respect of his parent or teacher. </p>\n\n<p>Is there any source for a woman standing for her husband when called up for aliya?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although at first glance, the act of standing by a wife when her husband is called up for an aliyah to the Torah appears to be similar to that of a child or student standing before their parent or teacher out of respect, it is actually coming from a completely different place. <em>And to clarify, this has nothing to do with the subject of mutual respect which exists naturally and normally between a husband and wife.</em></p>\n<p>To understand the concept generally, requires first mentioning one of the details of a common practice by many Jews. Namely the recital of the six remembrances said each day. The second of those is what is stated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.9?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 4:9-10</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַ֡ק הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְךָ֩ וּשְׁמֹ֨ר נַפְשְׁךָ֜ מְאֹ֗ד פֶּן־תִּשְׁכַּ֨ח אֶת־הַדְּבָרִ֜ים אֲשֶׁר־רָא֣וּ עֵינֶ֗יךָ וּפֶן־יָס֙וּרוּ֙ מִלְּבָ֣בְךָ֔ כֹּ֖ל י֗וֹם <strong>אֲשֶׁ֨ר עָמַ֜דְתָּ לִפְנֵ֨י יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶיךָ֮ בְּחֹרֵב֒</strong> בֶּאֱמֹ֨ר יְהוָ֜ה אֵלַ֗י הַקְהֶל־לִי֙ אֶת־הָעָ֔ם וְאַשְׁמִעֵ֖ם אֶת־דְּבָרָ֑י אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִלְמְד֜וּן לְיִרְאָ֣ה אֹתִ֗י כָּל־הַיָּמִים֙ אֲשֶׁ֨ר הֵ֤ם חַיִּים֙ עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה וְאֶת־בְּנֵיהֶ֖ם יְלַמֵּדֽוּן׃ יְמֵ֣י חַיֶּ֑יךָ וְהוֹדַעְתָּ֥ם לְבָנֶ֖יךָ וְלִבְנֵ֥י בָנֶֽיךָ׃</p>\n<p>But take utmost care and watch yourselves scrupulously, so that you do\nnot forget the things that you saw with your own eyes and so that they\ndo not fade from your mind as long as you live. And make them known to\nyour children and to your children’s children: The day <strong>you stood before the L-RD your G-d at Horeb</strong>, when the L-RD said to Me, “Gather the people to Me that I may let them hear My words, in order that they may learn to revere Me as long as they live on earth, and may so teach their children.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To emphasize, this is stated as a negative command (<strong>הִשָּׁ֣מֶר</strong> לְךָ֩ <strong>וּשְׁמֹ֨ר נַפְשְׁךָ֜</strong> מְאֹ֗ד פֶּן־תִּשְׁכַּ֨ח) and women, like men, are obligated in all the negative commandments.</p>\n<p>Many of the practices which we have are essentially recreating and replaying what took place, what is described in various parts of the Torah.</p>\n<p>When we are called up for an aliyah to the Torah, whether during the week, and even more so on Shabbat, <em>the day of the week that the Torah was actually given</em>, we are replaying what actually took place at <em>Matan Torah</em>.</p>\n<p>When a <em>husband</em> is called up to the Torah, it is completely consistent with what the Torah teaches and a good practice that his wife, if present, would also stand. That is because generally speaking, husband and wife are viewed in the Torah as one individual, two parts of one being, like it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.23-24?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 2:23-24</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וַיֹּאמֶר֮ הָֽאָדָם֒ זֹ֣את הַפַּ֗עַם עֶ֚צֶם מֵֽעֲצָמַ֔י וּבָשָׂ֖ר מִבְּשָׂרִ֑י לְזֹאת֙ יִקָּרֵ֣א אִשָּׁ֔ה</strong> כִּ֥י מֵאִ֖ישׁ לֻֽקֳחָה־זֹּֽאת׃\nעַל־כֵּן֙ יַֽעֲזָב־אִ֔ישׁ אֶת־אָבִ֖יו וְאֶת־אִמּ֑וֹ <strong>וְדָבַ֣ק בְּאִשְׁתּ֔וֹ וְהָי֖וּ לְבָשָׂ֥ר אֶחָֽד׃</strong></p>\n<p>Then the man said, “This one at last Is bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh. <strong>This one shall be called Wife</strong>, For from man was she taken.”\n<strong>Hence a man</strong> leaves his father and mother and <strong>clings to his wife, so that they become one flesh.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then the logical question that follows this is, if so, why doesn't the wife actually ascend the Bimah?</p>\n<p>But this is to fulfill in a complete way what the Torah recounts in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.15-16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 20:15-16</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְכָל־הָעָם֩</strong> רֹאִ֨ים אֶת־הַקּוֹלֹ֜ת וְאֶת־הַלַּפִּידִ֗ם וְאֵת֙ ק֣וֹל הַשֹּׁפָ֔ר וְאֶת־הָהָ֖ר עָשֵׁ֑ן <strong>וַיַּ֤רְא הָעָם֙ וַיָּנֻ֔עוּ וַיַּֽעַמְד֖וּ מֵֽרָחֹֽק׃</strong>\n<strong>וַיֹּֽאמְרוּ֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה דַּבֵּר־אַתָּ֥ה עִמָּ֖נוּ וְנִשְׁמָ֑עָה</strong> וְאַל־יְדַבֵּ֥ר עִמָּ֛נוּ אֱלֹהִ֖ים פֶּן־נָמֽוּת׃</p>\n<p><strong>All the people</strong> witnessed the thunder and lightning, the blare of the horn and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they <strong>fell back and stood at a distance.</strong>\n<strong>“You speak to us,” they said to Moses, “and we will listen</strong>; but let not God speak to us, lest we die.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>וְכָל־הָעָם֩ (All the people) is also referring to <em>the complete person</em>, meaning in the case of husband and wife, <em>the wife</em>.</p>\n<p>And just as it indicates in the written Torah, the wife stands and listens from a distance while her husband, like Moshe Rabbeinu, approaches and ascends.</p>\n\n\n",

Many people forego this \"ritual\" and have the \"ceremony\" (if that's the correct term, here,) at the grave.</p>\n\n<p>As for burial, itself, I have attended numerous funerals all attended by at least one Orthodox rabbi who supervised the burial, yet there was no minyan. I haven't seen or heard of any opinion stating that the burial cannot occur unless there's a minyan. Of course, Kaddish cannot be recited at the gravesite unless there is a minyan.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As I have heard from a few rabbis from whom I have asked regarding a brit...</p>\n\n<p>Circumcision should occur on the 8th day of the male child's life.

Here too, there is no requirement that a minyan be present for the circumcision.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard of numerous children that were circumcised in the hospital or in the privacy of the parents' home. The baby was healthy enough to be circumcised but needed to be isolated from other people as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Also, a few converts told me that their adult circumcision occurred in a hospital with just the mohel and someone administering local anesthetic. No minyan.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Two rabbis told me that they married a few couples in their office. I have to contact one of them, because I understood that there was no chuppa involved. That would imply that a chuppa is optional.

    "content": "# Did Karaites wear Tefillin at all?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I saw this recently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"If one, G-d forbid, [is not careful to place the tefillin above his hairline and instead] puts the tefillin on his forehead, he is following a custom of the Karites, and has not fulfilled the mitzvah at all….and has said a bracha in vain.\" {Mishna Berura 27:33}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had thought that the Karaites did not wear tefillin and interpreted the verse in the Torah as \"figurative\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are different groups of Karaites, and the general rule is that all opinions are accepted and are subject to equal scrutiny. To quote from Karaite Korner's FAQ section: <a href=\"https://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>\"If you interpret the Bible then don't you have your own Oral Law?\n\nNo. An Oral Law would imply that we claim that a given set of interpretations were bestowed upon us through a prophecy which was not included in the Hebrew Bible. Not only do we not make such a claim, but **we believe that every interpretation must stand up to the same objective scrutiny, regardless of its source**.\n\nHow can you have a community if everybody interprets the Bible themselves?\n\nThis is only a problem if we start off with intolerance. Karaites have learned to have tolerance of greatly varying interpretations as long as they are derived from sound principles of Biblical exegesis and only based on the Tanach. The reason for this tolerance is that we know that it is more important to do the right and moral thing than to do the same thing as everyone else.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Therefore, some Karaites wear Tefillin, some don't. The Torah only says to bind an \"os\" (sign) on your hand and a \"totefos\" between your eyes. Tefillin is the oral aspect of the same law. Since the Karaites reject being \"bound\" to oral law, they interpret as they wish, and in some cases go based on Rabbinic interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>On the note of Tefillin, the same site Karaite Korner states that as a general rule, they don't wear Tefillin:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"Do Karaites wear Tefillin (phylacteries)?\n\nNo. See http://www.karaite-korner.org/tefillin.shtml\n\nBut I thought Karaites wear Tefillin between their eyes?\n\nThis is not true. See: http://www.karaite-korner.org/tefillin.shtml.\n\nHow can Karaites know how to make Tefillin if the written Torah doesn't tell us how?\n\nWe can not know how to make Tefillin from the Torah because Tefillin were only invented by the Rabbis 1500 years after the Torah was given. The Torah commands us to treasure the commandments as jewels, not to strap leather amulets onto our heads and arms.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anecdotally, it's ironic that it was \"invented by the Rabbis 1500 years ago\" when Tefillin in \"amulet form\" was excavated from the Qumran caves, showing evidence that it's much older. See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/1591202/jewish/The-Tefillin-of-Qumran.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/1591202/jewish/The-Tefillin-of-Qumran.htm</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mishnah (Megillah 24b)</p>\n\n<p>העושה תפילתו עגולה, סכנה ואין בה מצוה.</p>\n\n<p><strong>נתנה על מצחו</strong> או על פס ידו, הרי זו דרך <strong>המינות</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>See Rashi (ad loc.), that this was the manner of the \"minim\", who degenerate the words of the Sages, and follow the literal meaning of the verse.</p>\n\n<p>Kessef Mishnah (Hilchos Tefillin 4:3) reads \"Saducees\".</p>\n\n<p>פירש''י סכנה שלא תכנס בראשו. נתנה על מצחו של ראש ושל יד על פס ידו הרי זה דרך <strong>הצדוקים</strong> שמניחין מדרש חכמים והולכים אחר המשמע. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Karaites do not wear tefillin.</p>\n<p>The idea that Karaites \"always\" follow the literal meaning is patently false. It is a contrarian belief system in that it takes the mainstream understanding & turns it on its ear. Take the issue of \"T'fillin\" since that was specifically referenced. Karaites denigrate mainstream Judaism for donning T'fillin.</p>\n<p>Why? They say we are too literal. They say that when we don a tiny box with a snippet of the Torah on our forehead & on our left bicep we are being literal when the Mitzvah is merely to keep the Torah in our heart & on our mind.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, consider Kashrut. We understand the Mitzvah not to boil a kid in its mother's milk as a blanket prohibition against mixing any & all dairy with any & all meat. Karaites declare that we must be MORE literal. They argue that the only prohibition is against literally boiling a specific kid in its own specific mother's milk.</p>\n<p>In other words, it is a system of contrarianism, decisions with such pettiness as one might expect of a system invented by Ananites, partisans of a failed candidate for Exilarch.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Yehuda says that\nRav says: Wives receive a ketubah and kiddushin; pilagshim are taken\nwithout a ketubah and without kiddushin”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gaon says that this is the reading of \"our books\" and also the reading of both Ramban and Rambam.Now, Sanhedrin 21a seems to establish a general eligibility for pilagshim, without particular limitations.</p>\n<p>However at note n. seven, with reference to those who support the unlawfulness of pilegesh (Rema: “and there are those who say that this is forbidden”),the Vilna  Gaon remembers  that Ramban (source:  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_haRashba_Meyuchas_LehaRamban.284.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvot haRashba Meyuchas LehaRamban No. 284</a>) criticizes Rambam's position on the admissibility of the pilegesh for the king alone, citing the cases of Kalev and Gedeon and other great Israelites , who despite not being king have had pilagshim, and also the famous case of  Ghiv'à's pilegesh. The Gaon however, at this point, says that Rambam has solved this specific problem by affirming that the ordinary citizen cannot have a pilegesh except in the case of a Jewish maidservant  he has destined to himself (direct quotation from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.4.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim uMilachamot 4:4</a>); from this reference it could therefore be deduced that the Vilna Gaon harmonized the apparent differences in thought between Ramban and Rambam by claiming that the  women mentioned in the Tanakh as pilagshim of Jewish men who were not kings were actually all Jewish maidservants so designated by their masters, and therefore not free women who  contracted pilagshut with such men, thus adhering,at least so the text would seem to say, to the traditional prohibitionist interpretation of the words expressed by Rambam on the subject, since in this hypothesis we would not find in the Tanakh a single case of pilagshut between two  Jews commoners both free.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the Vilna Gaon, is the pilegesh allowed only by acquisition through kiddushin?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Vilna Gaon continues his dissertation quoting various sources, from Rashì to the same Rema, the Parasha of Chaye Sara, the Talmud Yerushalmì chap. 5 of Kethubboth, halakha 2 etc., sources according to which the pilegesh undoubtedly contracts the kiddushin, and therefore she needs to receive the get to dissolve the bond with her man, and in fact I have read some  articles written by orthodox Jews according to which the Vilna Gaon precisely prohibits pilegesh without kiddushin. However, this   seems to me to be in contrast with what the Gaon himself writes in note n. six, where he, as mentioned above, remembers  Sanhedrin 21a, in which  it is clearly stated that pilagshim have not  kiddushin.</p>\n<p>I am somewhat confused about the correct meaning of the articulated reasoning expressed by this great master, also because I read <a href=\"http://torahhalacha.blogspot.com/2018/07/ramban-and-rambam-permit-pilegesh.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> written by the orthodox rabbi David E.  Eidensohn, according to which the Vilna Gaon would consider as legitimate the pilegesh in any case and without acquisition through kiddushin.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Can you source this\n\"in fact I have read some articles written by orthodox Jews according to which the Vilna Gaon precisely prohibits pilegesh without kiddushin\"?</p>\n<p>The Beur HaGra you cited is quite explicit, so from my perspective you are pitting a real source against a ghost source.

Magen Avraham and Kaf Hachaim both cite the Radbaz when saying that one can force a patient to take medicine even if the patient doesn't want to. These opinions are independent of the patient being a rodef - they are all based simply on the patient's own well being.

The Radbaz has a relevant teshuva. A baby was 2 years old and was still very weak. The baby would be potential danger if it was weaned. It would not nurse from anyone other than it's mother, so a wet nurse wasn't a viable option. The Radbaz suggests a number of options, but ultimately concludes that even if the woman wants to stop nursing, she can be forced to continue nursing because it is important to the babies health. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaRadbaz_Volume_1.349\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvot HaRadbaz 1:349</a> - I believe this is the one the acharonim above are referring to and either their citation system is something unfamiliar to me or the numbers of the Teshuvot are printed differently in their edition compared to the probably more modern edition digitized by Sefaria).</p>\n<p>Although the above answers your question without needing to resort to calling someone a rodef, it is an interesting question.

(All of those are big <em>if</em>s.)</p>\n<p>Even then, there's plenty of halachic discussion on the <em>cost incurred</em> to get up and save a life. (The Talmud says to save someone's property I'm not expected to incur loss -- if I watch his lost ox, I can and should use the ox while I feed it. Whereas to save someone's life or limb, I should <em>rent</em> equipment if needed. It doesn't say \"spend\", it says \"rent.\" The commentaries there assume the language -- normally the alternative to <em>begufo</em> is <em>bemamono</em>, but here it's <em>leradia</em> -- implies you may seek to be repaid afterwards.)</p>\n<p>I'd imagine a doctor could lose his/her license, or even be criminally charged, by forcing any kind of medicine on a patient. At that point we do have a similar question addressed in the halachic literature -- suppose a doctor discovers a patient has AIDS, knows about it, and tells his doctor explicitly: <em>my fiancee doesn't know about this, she's naive, I intend to keep hiding this from her, and not use protection; I don't care if she gets it from me.</em> If there was no cost to the doctor, <em>don't stand by</em> would obligate him or her to speak up. (Practically, appropriate mechanisms allow for just that -- the doctor could take it to the hospital's ethics panel.) But if the only way to do so would mean the doctor could be fired or worse ... there's a lot of discussion on that one; it's likely considered a cost too high.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The first  question is if  giving vaccines to someone who is currently healthy has the halachic status of  Pikuach Nefesh and Lo Saamid Al Dam Rayach . While it is possible someone will  die and cause others to die as a result of their failure to vaccinate that possibly also exists with driving a car. A serious epidemic would be a situation of pikuach nefesh where one can be required to administer vaccines. One can even give them on Shabbos if there will be no other opportunity  to do so but not all vaccines are given for such heavy risks. When a risk enters the category of potential pikuach nefesh is a complicated question of it's own.</p>\n<p>When it comes to  forcing vaccines on people when there is no  epidemic serious enough to to make this vaccine clearly be considered pikuach nefesh   there are differences in opinion. The Nishmas Avrohom (Choshen Mishpat 426b and 427a) says  that parents (and by extension doctors) cannot be forced to vaccinate their healthy children, even if the parent is refusing  because of an \"irrational\nfear\". While others are of the opinions that parents must vaccinate that would be relevant to <em>parents</em>. What obligation is there on a doctor to give a vaccine against someone's will anymore than giving any other  treatment for a nonpaying patient?(It's safe to assume someone being vaccinated against his will isn't going to pay for it) Shulchan Aruch (Y.D. 336:3)discusses doctors (over)charging and the obligation to pay afterwards. The Rema says that even though a doctor has a  mitzvah to treat this patient, it is not a mitzvah incumbent specifically on him.  Theoretically anyone can become a doctor and heal people. Therefore no doctor has a personal obligation to treat people over anyone else. (note: Rashi gives the refusal to heal the poor for free as one the reason the Mishna says \"Tov S'b'Rofim L'Gehenim)</p>\n<p>If a doctor can refuse treatment over money he presumably  can do so because the patient is also unwilling to accept it.</p>\n<p>Ask your Rav if you are a doctor. None of the above is meant halacha l'maashe.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are the days of sefiras haomer counted at the beginning but the weeks at the end?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When counting sefiras haomer, we count the number of the day we are about to start but the number of the week we have most recently completed. For example, on the first day we say \"today is one day\" even though we have not yet completed the first day as it is just starting. On the other hand, when we count weeks, we don't count a week until we reach the end (e.g. \"today is seven days which are one week\"). What is the reason for this inconsistency?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>To address the questions that have come up in the comments and answers so far, there are a number of ways the days and weeks could be counted consistently. For example, \"Today is day 1, which is one day of the first week of the omer.\" Alternatively, as Double AA mentioned in comments, simply counting days and weeks separately: ״היום יום אחד לעומר. השבוע שבוע אחד לעומר״</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think the answer is closely related to understanding the answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/103270/5275\">Why do we count Sefirah cardinally rather than ordinally?</a>. In other words, we count the number of days that have passed since the beginning of the counting.</p>\n\n<p>So, @AlBerko is on the right track here. The Judaic day begins at nightfall. Once that day has begun, we have to count, correct? We're not really looking at how much of that day has passed. We're just interested in the fact that a new day has begun, therefore, that's one more day to add to the count.</p>\n\n<p>I would say to apply the same logic to the weeks. We're looking at how many weeks have passed since we started counting (i.e., cardinally). We're not looking at which week we are in. So, we wouldn't say on Day 1, \"Today is 1 day, and we're in the first week.\" That doesn't match up with the time that has passed and been actually counted. Therefore, on Day 7, when truly a full week of days has actually been passed and counted, we say at that point, \"today is 7 days which is 1 week.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think we count the weeks the way we do since it's just less cumbersome being that we don't count the weeks as a total without details.</p>\n\n<p>That is, we don't call the entire first week 'week one' and the entire second week 'week two'. As opposed to let's say years, when you (or the Torah) say a two year old cow, that leaves the question open, are we discussing a cow that finished two years since birth, or is it in it's second year. But either one is acceptable as far as language used.</p>\n\n<p>Our count of weeks includes the fraction of the weeks, which gives a more accurate total. That is, the days besides the total weeks.</p>\n\n<p>So imagine day eight: \nToday is day eight which is one week and one day as we do it, vs today is day eight which is two weeks less six days.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Maadanei Yom Tov says that we are counting days since the day commemorating Yetzi'as Mitzrayim. So that \"<em>hayom yom echad ba'omer</em>\" means one day elapsed since that moment in time, not that it is the first day. We are indeed counting \"at the end\" of one day, as you put it. Here is his argument:</p>\n<p>Why is it that we celebrate Shuvu'os on the 6th of Sivan, and call it <em>Zeman Matan Toraseinu</em> -- the time of the giving of our Torah, when the Torah was actually given on the 7th?</p>\n<p>Also, why is the Torah ambiguous about how many days to count? Quoting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.15-16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayiqra 23:15-16</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּסְפַרְתֶּ֤ם לָכֶם֙ מִמָּחֳרַ֣ת הַשַּׁבָּ֔ת מִיּוֹם֙ הֲבִ֣יאֲכֶ֔ם אֶת־עֹ֖מֶר הַתְּנוּפָ֑ה <strong>שֶׁ֥בַע שַׁבָּת֖וֹת תְּמִימֹ֥ת תִּהְיֶֽינָה</strong>׃\nעַ֣ד מִֽמָּחֳרַ֤ת הַשַּׁבָּת֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔ת <strong>תִּסְפְּר֖וּ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים י֑וֹם</strong> וְהִקְרַבְתֶּ֛ם מִנְחָ֥ה חֲדָשָׁ֖ה לַה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And from the day on which you bring the sheaf of elevation offering — the day after the day of rest — <strong>you shall count off seven weeks</strong>; they must be complete.\nYou must count until the day after the seventh week — <strong>fifty days</strong>; then you shall bring an offering of new grain to Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are we counting 7 weeks = 49 days, or 50 days? And while one might be tempted to say that Shavuos \"the day after the seventh week\" is the 50th day, what the verse actually says is to count 50 days until the day after the seventh week -- the weeks we were just talking about when we said 49. Not including it.</p>\n<p>The answer is that we're counting from day 0. For us today, day 0 is the first day of Pesach. On the second day of Pesach we say \"This is one day in/toward the <em>omer</em>\" -- it's a day since day 0. And we would be bringing the <em>qorban omer</em> to mark the completion of 1 day, thus we count the time completed.</p>\n<p>However, on the original Pesach, day 0 didn't begin at nightfall. The actual Exodus was during the day. And since (as per the quoted verse) <em>omer</em> has to count complete days and weeks, that meant their day 0 was on the second day of Pesach. They counted 49 days from that time, and thereby reached the 7th, not the 6th of Sivan.</p>\n<p>So, we count a duration of 49 days, but because there is a 0th day, the last day of our count is a 50th day. Thus, both verses are fulfilled.</p>\n<p>But, that means we are counting days from a t=0, and thus days too are \"counted at the end\" of the day.</p>\n\n\n",

[In all such instances] it is forbidden for a Jew to deviate. </p>\n  \n  <p>וּמִזֶּה יִלְמַד כָּל אָדָם לְפִי מְקוֹמוֹ וְשַׁעְתּוֹ, שֶׁהַמַּלְבּוּשׁ הֶעָשׂוּי לְיוּהֲרָא וּפְרִיצוּת לֹא יַעֲשֶׂה הַיִשְֹרָאֵל כֵּן, אֶלָּא מַלְבּוּשָׁיו יִהְיוּ עֲשׂוּיִים בְּעִנְיָן הַמּוֹרֶה עַל הַכְנָעָה וּצְנִיעוּת.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>From these examples everyone should learn how to apply these standards to his time and place. A garment designed for showiness or immodesty must not be worn by a Jew, but rather his clothing should be made in a style which suggests humility and modesty. </p>\n  \n  <p>הָכֵי אָמְרִינָן בְּסִפְרֵי, שֶׁלֹּא תֹאמַר הוֹאִיל וְהֵן יוֹצְאִין בְּאַרְגָּמָן אַף אֲנִי אֵצֵא בְּאַרְגָּמָן, הוֹאִיל וְהֵן יוֹצְאִין בְּקוֹלְסִין (פֵּרוּשׁ, כְּלֵי זַיִן) אַף אֲנִי אֵצֵא בְּקוֹלְסִין, שֶׁדְּבָרִים הַלָּלוּ דִבְרֵי שַׁחַץ וְגַאֲוָה הֵם, וְלֹא כְאֵלֶּה חֵלֶק יַעֲקֹב, אֶלָּא דַּרְכָּם לִהְיוֹת צְנוּעִים וַעֲנָוִים, וְלֹא לִפְנוֹת אֶל רְהָבִים.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The following is mentioned in Sifrei: You should not say that since they go out with scarlet I shall go out with scarlet, since they go out with kulsin (the word kulsin meaning weaponry) I also shall go out with kulsin, because these practices are indicative of arrogance and haughtiness which are not the heritage of Jacob. Rather, our heritage demands of us to be modest and humble, and not be influenced by the haughty. </p>\n  \n  <p>וְכֵן כָּל דָּבָר שֶׁנָּהֲגוּ לְמִנְהָג וּלְחֹק דְאִכָּא לְמֵיחָשׁ שֶׁיֵּשׁ בּוֹ שֶׁמֶץ עֲבוֹדָה זָרָה, לֹא יַעֲשֶׂה הַיִשְֹרָאֵל כֵּן. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, any custom or statute of which there is a suspicion of idolatrous intent or background should be avoided by Jews. </p>\n  \n  <p>וְכֵן לֹא יְגַלַּח וְלֹא יְגַדֵּל שַעֲרוֹת רֹאשׁוֹ כְּמוֹהֶם, אֶלּא יְהֵא מֻבְדָּל מֵהֶם בְּמַלְבּוּשָׁיו וּבְדִבּוּרוֹ וּבִשְׁאָר מַעֲשָׂיו כְּמוֹ שֶׁהוּא מֻבְדָּל מֵהֶם בְּמַדָּעוֹ וּבְדֵעוֹתָיו. וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר, וָאַבְדִּיל אֶתְכֶם מִן הָעַמִּים.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, you should not cut your hair or style your hair as they do, but rather you should be distinct, in your clothing and speech and all other endeavors just as you are distinct in your perspectives and concepts. Similarly, it is said: \"I have set you apart from the nations.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>Just a couple of clarifications:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Not \"<em>some non-Jews do</em>\" but \"what's commonly accepted in a specific place\". If a hundred people in NY do or wear something special we should not be worried.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This prohibition is a spin-off from the prohibition of idolatry and adultery (to distance ourselves from the possibility of marrying Gentiles). This is not a \"stand-alone\" prohibition, \"just G-d's decree.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Seemingly</em> this Halachah only applies to \"bad\" practices, but if they do something to enforce the 7 laws that aligns with our Torah, for example, obligate wearing a Kippah, or extra-long skirts we don't do the opposite just to be different.</p>\n<p>Or if the government representatives wear suits that doesn't mean we shouldn't. Or playing baseball, even professional for one's health and living.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This Halachah has a flip side (as many other conducts), where a person that openly exaggerates in being different, and wears a robe, that is called \"מחזה כיהורא\" - looks like vanity, like being better in things that most if not all Rabbis observed.</p>\n<p>I never saw a Rabbi with Jewish shoelaces or demonstrational  Jewish shirt or socks.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This Halachah is bound to more \"severe\" Halochos, like self-preserving or making living etc, and in cases of contradiction the latter win (as the Gemmorah rules with יושב במלכות).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

This is in contrast to a robber, who robs openly. Accordingly, the reason that I say that an armed bandit is considered as a thief, is since he hides from people rather than stealing openly. Although he in fact does steal openly, since he does so by employing a weapon he also exhibits fear of people, and is akin to a thief. Therefore, armed bandits are liable to pay a double payment as is a thief, and a claim that the deposit was seized by armed bandits is considered to be the same as a claim that it was stolen by thieves. Consequently, since a paid bailee is absolved by means of such a claim, if it is determined that his claim was false he must pay double. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's a machloket in a couple of Gemarot.

And why are the two exceptional cases different?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In short, the rational is the rules of Chazaka. My answer is based on the Rash Negayim 4.11.</p>\n<p>See Nazir 65b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>MISHNA</strong>: Any case of uncertainty with regard to leprous sores is initially deemed pure until it is established that it is a case of ritual impurity. Once it has been determined to be a case of impurity, uncertainty concerning it is deemed impure. <strong>GEMARA</strong>: The Gemara asks: From where are these matters derived? Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: The verse states: “This is the law of the plague of leprosy…to pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure” (Leviticus 13:59). Since the verse opened with purity first, this teaches that any case of uncertainty concerning leprous sores is deemed pure. The Gemara asks: If so, if the halakha is based on this verse, then even once it has been determined to be a case of impurity, uncertainty concerning it should be deemed pure as well, as this interpretation of the verse should apply to all cases of uncertainty with regard to leprosy <em>(Tosfot explains in name of Rabenu Tam the Kushia of the Gemara: If it has been determined to be a case of purity, we don't need the verse, the Hezkat Tahara is sufficient. The Rash in Negayim 4.11 has an other pshat. He understands that the words of the Gemara משנזקק לטומאה reffer to Mishna Negayim 5. 4-5. Indeed, these Mishna in Nazir is taught also in Negayim, but there, the rule is followed by two examples. And the Rash adds that in Torat Kohanim the Tana explains the two cases thanks to two verses in parasha of Negayim. So, the Gemara addresses here a case of two sores, one of them enlarged and needs to be impure because of the פשיון, enlargement. But we don't know which of the two. Thanks to the verse ואמא הכהן אותו, we know that the Cohen can make impure a specific sore. So we don't need the verse of Rav Yehuda. So the Gemara says that the verse needs to address the second case, of two sores that enlarged and then shortened. But one of them is is still greater than it's initial size. We know thanks to the verse וטהרו הכהן that the doubtful sore remains impure. Thus, the verse of Rabbi Yehuda cannot make it pure)</em>.</p>\n<p>Rather, when this statement, that Rav Yehuda said that Rav said, was stated, it was stated with regard to the following dispute in a mishna concerning an uncertain leprous sore (Nega’im 4:11): If the snow-white leprous sore [baheret], which is one sign of leprosy, preceded the white hair, which is another sign, he is impure. This halakha is stated in the Torah (see Leviticus 13:3). And if the white hair preceded the baheret he is pure, as this is not considered a sign of impurity. If there is uncertainty as to which came first, he is impure. And Rabbi Yehoshua said: Keiha. The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of keiha? Rav Yehuda said: Rabbi Yehoshua pronounced the matter unsolvable and ruled it is pure <em>(Tosfot in Nidda 19a explains that the natural course of the disease is tha the skin became white first and further the hair becomes white, this is against the Chezkat Tahara and this leads Tana Kama to say he is impure, but Rabbi Yehoshua, according to Rav Yehuda learns from the verse that the Chezkat Tahara is not altered, but Rabenu Tam explains that they tell about a man who was Tame (1). And the Rash says that the man was not impure, but because the first חצי גריס was here without white hair, we are almost sure that the second חצי גריס too was already here before the hair became white.)</em>. The Gemara further asks: And perhaps this means that he pronounced the matter unsolvable and ruled it is impure (Tosfot explains that perhaps Rabbi Yehoshua is more stringent than Tana Kama, Tana Kama rules that is Tame from Safek and Rabbi Yehoshua Tame Surely)? Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: The verse states: “To pronounce it pure or to pronounce it impure” (Leviticus 13:59); since the verse opened with purity first, any case of uncertainty concerning leprous sores is deemed pure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(1): See the Rash in Mishna 4.11. following the pshat of Rabenu Tam in Gemara, the answer is that in the case of the Machloket rabanan and Rabbi Yehoshua we have no Chezkat tahara. The man was muchlat because of a previous nega. This explains why rabanan make him impure and why Rabbi Yehoshua needs a verse to make him pure. This man has already a first nega which was muchlat, and then, a second nega appeared. The rule is that the Cohen will not see the second nega until the first nega recovered. So, now the first nega recovered and he looks at the second nega. For this second nega we are dubitative, the white he was here before the nega or after. Rabanan rule the safek as impure, Rabbi Yehoshua rules it as pure. The reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua is Chezkat haguf against Chezkat tumea. Both are chazakot demeyikara.</p>\n<p><strong>Now we can read the Mishna</strong>, thanks to the Rash in the previous Mishna..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל ספק נגעים טהור וכולי עלמא every doubt in negayim is pure, everybody agrees to this rule because of the Chezkat tahara,</p>\n<p>חוץ מזה דפליגי except for the case of the previous Mishna, in which there is a disagreement between Tanayim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For this there are three opinions in the Rash. The Mishna is against Rabbi Yehoshua.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rabbenu Tam explanation. A man was impure because of a first sore, he was muchlat. In the meantime, a second sore appeared. For this second sore there is a doubt if the haire whitened before the sore appeared (and is not a sign of impurity), or afterwards (and is a sign of impurity). We have no prior Chezkat Tahara.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Tosfot in Nidda 19a explains that there is a sore with white hair and we don't know if the sore appeared because the hair became white (and there is impurity). Since the general course of the illness is that the becomes white because of the sore, we have a chazaka against the chezkat Tahara. And the sore is impure.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Rash explains that there was formerly a sore of an half gris surface, without hair, further, a second sore of an half gris surface appeared. Since the first sore didn't appear upon a white hair, we say that similarely the second sore didn't apperar upon a white hair, but after the white hair.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד אחר  and an other case in which Rabbi Yehoshua agrees because there isn't Chezkat haguf because there was already a sore kegris and Chazaka it's the same sore we see now, the presence of an other sore is not אתחזק, and we think that the same sore is enlarged. The metsora is muchlat. This is different from Mishna 4 because there we have an other sore from the beginning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think it is because of the general rule of Chazokah - when all things are equal then a person retains his former status.

But rather <strong>it was established by G-d</strong> directly as is stated explicitly in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.19?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 18:19</a>, which says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּ֣י יְדַעְתִּ֗יו לְמַעַן֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְצַוֶּ֜ה אֶת־בָּנָ֤יו וְאֶת־בֵּיתוֹ֙ אַחֲרָ֔יו וְשָֽׁמְרוּ֙ <strong>דֶּ֣רֶךְ יְהוָ֔ה</strong> לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת צְדָקָ֖ה וּמִשְׁפָּ֑ט לְמַ֗עַן הָבִ֤יא יְהוָה֙ עַל־אַבְרָהָ֔ם אֵ֥ת אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֖ר עָלָֽיו׃</p>\n  \n  <p>That I (meaning G-d) connected with him (meaning Avraham) in order that he 'command/connect' his children and his household after him that they will keep the <strong>Way of G-d</strong>, to do charity/righteousness and equitable judgement. For the sake of this, did G-d bring to Avraham that which He spoke to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this same idea was later expressed by Moshe Rabbeinu in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.8.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 8:2</a>, which says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וְזָכַרְתָּ֣ אֶת־כָּל־הַדֶּ֗רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֨ר הֹלִֽיכֲךָ֜ יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ</strong> זֶ֛ה אַרְבָּעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר לְמַ֨עַן עַנֹּֽתְךָ֜ לְנַסֹּֽתְךָ֗ <strong>לָדַ֜עַת אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֧ר בִּֽלְבָבְךָ֛ הֲתִשְׁמֹ֥ר מצותו אִם־לֹֽא</strong>׃</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Remember <em>the entire way</em> that the L-rd your G-d has conducted you</strong> in the wilderness these past forty years, that He might test you by hardships <strong>to learn what was in your hearts: <em>whether you would keep His commandments</em> or not</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is even hinted at through one of the special traditions given to the Scribes when writing a Sefer Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The phrase, <em>Way of G-d</em>, in Hebrew is דרך יהוה, like is seen in the cited text from Bereshit above, has a <em>gematria</em> (numerical value) of 250 which is נר (meaning the gematria of <em>Ner</em>, light or lamp, is <em>Derech HaShem</em>).</p>\n\n<p>After the sin of the golden calf, when the Jewish people had returned to G-d's way, G-d renewed his covenant with the Jewish people revealing to Moshe, our teacher the inner essence of His Torah what are called <strong>G-d's 13 attributes of Mercy</strong>. This is recounted in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.5-14?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot, chapter 34 beginning at the fifth posuk.</a></p>\n\n<p>The Scribes were given a special tradition to write two oversized letters, the letter <em>Nun</em> and the letter <em>Reish</em> at these passages, beginning with the <em>Nun</em> of the word נצר (<em>It should be noted that נצר is also understood to allude to רצון, G-d's will.</em>) in Shemot 34:7 and ending with the letter <em>Reish</em> of the word אחר in Shemot 34:14. That what is restated and renewed in these passages is the <em>Way of G-d</em>. That this is what is intended, that the Jewish people are to be a <em>source of light</em> to the nations like is expressed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.49.3-6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishayahu 49:3-6</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And this is also in keeping with what is expressed by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.6.23?vhe=Tanach_with_Nikkud&lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 6:23</a> which says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי <strong>נֵר מִצְוָה וְתוֹרָה אוֹר וְדֶרֶךְ חַיִּים</strong> תּוֹכְחוֹת מוּסָר׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For <strong>the commandment is a lamp, The teaching is a light, And the way to life</strong> is the rebuke that disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>See Ibn Ezra to this posuk for additional insight.</p>\n\n<p>And restated again in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.20.27?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 20:27</a> which says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>נֵ֣ר יְ֭הוָה נִשְׁמַ֣ת אָדָ֑ם</strong> חֹ֝פֵ֗שׂ כָּל־חַדְרֵי־בָֽטֶן׃</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The soul of man is the lamp of the L-rd</strong> Revealing all his inmost parts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Rashi to this posuk for additional insight.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the highlighted section of the Torah mentioned above, Shemot 34:11-14 deals specifically with the subject of possessing the land of Israel which is the <strong><em>provision of the endowment aspect</em></strong> of the dictionary definition associated with founding something.</p>\n\n<p>The first link of resources in your question is to an English article by Rabbi Tzvi Freedman with Chabad.org. Although Rabbi Freedman incorrectly uses the English term <em>Founder</em> with Avraham, he does indicate what he means by the expression by footnoting it to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.1.2-3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Avodah Zarah, 1:2-3</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you look to that source, you find that Rambam does not call Avraham <em>the Founder of Judaism</em> (מייסד יהדות). Rather, he refers to him as the <strong>Pillar of the World</strong> (עמוד של עולם).</p>\n\n<p>This phrase is making the allegorical comparison of Avraham to the pillar of a building which prevents the roof from collapsing. And this is how the Torah explains the importance of Avraham in relation to the creation of the world, like is found many places in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam explains that Avraham figured out that the premise of idol worship in his day was wrong and he rejected it. He goes on to explain that Avraham taught that any worship should only be directed to the Creator of everything and that this Creator is the only G-d, there is no other. And Rambam explains that Avraham addressed the Creator with the name <strong><em>El Olam</em></strong> as cited from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.33?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 21:33</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that <strong><em>this is not the name of G-d</em></strong> generally used in Jewish prayers and blessings, like the Amidah prayer.</p>\n\n<p>But Rambam, at the conclusion of halacha 3 cited above explains that everything which Avraham taught was in the process of being lost when his descendants descended into Mitzrayim. He explains that if not for G-d keeping His promise to Avraham, this would have happened. And Rambam explains that G-d chose Moshe to be His <strong><em>Shaliach</em></strong>, <em>His legal agent</em>, and through Moshe, our teacher, <em>made Avraham's descendants aware of <strong>how to worship Him</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Moshe communicated <strong><em>what G-d established together with G-d's endowment of the land of Israel.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>I was unable to determine who the authors were for History.com or Religions.com, but neither are traditional, Orthodox Jewish sources. As far as I was able to determine, the editors of The New Jewish Encyclopedia were both Reform Jews, which is again, not a traditional, Orthodox Jewish viewpoint.</p>\n\n\n",

And there were few members of the Erev Rav who were untainted by the sin of the Egel and qualified to testify against others... these members of the Erev Rav were killed by the plague</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>3) Only a few literally sinned, most of the nation \"passively\" sinned</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Sforno</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Exodus.32.27.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on Shemos 32:27</a> writes (fleshed out by the aforementioned OU.org article):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>although only a small portion of the nation actually worshipped the Egel, many others stood by passively and did little to prevent their neighbors from violating the prohibition against idolatry</strong> – one of the most important injunctions of the Torah.

As a result, the sin of the Egel took place. <strong>In other words, the sin was the result of the actions of the few and the passivity of the majority.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Hashem wanted to punish both those who sinned actively by worshipping the Egel and those who sinned through their passivity – by not taking the action necessary to prevent the sin.</strong> The sinners were punished by death.

Since the Erev Rav instigated this whole episode, they weren't really part of Bnei Yisrael and were wiped out- the Torah doesn't mind telling us how many people these were. But the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, & Yaakov? <strong>As bad as our actions were, the Torah HaKedoshah <em>still</em> doesn't want to embarass us and refrains from explicitly stating the number.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

The Be’ur Halacha (Rav Yisrael Meir Kagan of Radin, 1839-1933)\n  rules in siman 253 that it permissible because it constitutes a Shvut\n  D’Shvut, a Rabbinic prohibition on a Rabbinic prohibition. That is,\n  telling the non-Jew to violate Shabbat is itself only a Rabbinic\n  prohibition; and returning cold cooked dry food to an open flame is\n  only a Rabbinic prohibition. When the prohibition is a “Double\n  D’Rabanan,” we can be lenient in a case where the action is necessary\n  for enhancing Shabbat. This would be a solution in the event that\n  someone forgot to set up his Blech or hotplate. It is only permitted\n  to have the non-Jew return the food to a fire that was already lit\n  before Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>The second case is having a non-Jew return cold liquids to the fire.\n  Here, the Be’ur Halacha quotes the Birkei Yosef (The H”ida, Rav Haim\n  Yosef David Azulai, 1724-1806) who says, fundamentally, this is also\n  permissible. Even though we hold that reheating cold soup constitutes\n  a “new” cooking, however, since there is a disagreement between the\n  poskim on this matter, we can permit it to be done by a non-Jew.\n  Hacham David Yosef in Halacha Berura, as well as the B’eur Halacha,\n  add a caveat to this leniency: The non-Jew may only return the cold\n  soup to a fire that is garuf or katum, i.e. a blech or Shabbat\n  hotplate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although this speaks to fire, microwaves shouldn't be any <em>worse</em> than an actual fire on shabbos. (See Igros Moshe OC 3:52 who says microwaves are d'oraysa cooking on shabbos because it's the normal form of cooking - though I believe Rav Moshe Heinemann says bishul akum doesn't apply with microwaves though many (<a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/halacha/Volume_7_Issue_2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see note 23</a>) are strict) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I can't see any problem with this, based on the following (from <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:XFvIFoihO4YJ:https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php%3Ftitle%3DAmirah_LeNochri%20&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halachipedia</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many poskim are lenient regarding a live-in maid as a worker paid by\n  the job and not per hour as long as the maid is told explicitly that\n  she is not required to do them on Shabbos and may do it beforehand or\n  afterwards. Nonetheless, there's numerous restrictions in order to\n  permit a maid to perform Melacha for Jews on Shabbat including: not\n  instructing the non-Jew to do Melacha, not having a possibility of\n  maris ayin (appearance of sin), not benefiting directly, and not\n  degrading Shabbat's sanctity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As I understand this scenario, the Gentile chef (Mr(s.) food-heater) is hired by the cruise line (it doesn't matter if the cruise-line owner is Jewish or not, here.) They get a fixed wage for cooking / warming food for all the passengers. I don't think s/he is specifically being told, \"Warm up this specific tray for the Jew on Sabbath.\" S/he is most likely told, to warm up food when it is meal time, and included in all the food there happens to be some kosher meals. However, according to this citation, it seems that you or the cruise director would need to explicitly explain that the food need not be heated on Shabbat. (I agree that this sounds counter-intuitive esp. for lunchtime, but from my reading, it seems that all you need to do is mention it, and leave the decision to them.)</p>\n\n<p>This sounds similar to a household that has a live-in worker who is told to clean dishes and warm up food for the household and no one is stating when the Gentile should do it. </p>\n\n<p>I assume that the cruise is a mainly non-Jewish cruise. So, chances are that the other passengers don't recognize that this work (if they even understand what a <em>melacha</em> is) is being done in violation of Shabbat. To me, this sounds within the concept similar to \"private\"; i.e., there is no \"Mar'it Ayin\" concern.</p>\n\n<p>Despite what I mentioned, read footnote #79 for possible opposition and restrictions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Warning with an oven is a melacha. Because he uses an oven to warm it. Even if this is not bishul, may be he uses fire or electric devices. It's prohibited. Maybe permitted for a child because a child is often seen as an ill person who is not in life threatening situation, and it's permitted to ask a non Jew to make for him a work on Shabbat. But for an adult healthy person it's prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Rema OC 328.17</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הגה: מותר לומר לעכו\"ם לעשות תבשיל לקטן שאין לו מה לאכול דסתם צרכי קטן כחולה שאין בו סכנה דמי (רבינו ירוחם נתיב י\"ב חלק ט' ורמב\"ן ורשב\"א) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See SA OC 244.1.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פוסק אדם (פירוש מתנה) עם האינו יהודי על המלאכה וקוצץ דמים והאינו יהודי עושה לעצמו ואף על פי שהוא עושה בשבת מותר במה דברים אמורים בצנעה שאין מכירים הכל שזו המלאכה הנעשית בשבת של ישראל היא <strong>אבל אם היתה ידועה ומפורסמת אסור שהרואה את האינו יהודי עוסק \n  אינו יודע שקצץ ואומר שפלוני שכר האינו יהודי לעשות לו מלאכה בשבת</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If we see that the non Jew makes the work for the Jew, even if he paid him before Shabbat, even if the work is for a whole period e.g. one week it's prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>See also in 318, to add a quantity for the same melacha for a person for whom it's prohibited to make the melacha is prohibited.</p>\n\n\n",

Something to have in mind  before you give your answer is that Rambam’s 13 principles seem to say that we should believe that God gave everything in the Torah to Moses (I suppose that would even include some of the narratives that are not scientifically factual), and that nothing in the Torah changed or will ever change. So now with that in mind: Would believing that some of the narratives in the Torah are not scientifically factual no longer make me Orthodox and brand me as a heretic, or would I still remain Orthodox? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The Rambam believed that the Torah is not intended to be history or science, but ethical teachings:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those passages in the Bible, which, in their literal sense, contain statements that can be refuted by proof, can and must be interpreted otherwise.

Simultaneously, they must fear the possibility that on judgement day, their Creator will reveal that the stories in the Torah were not intended to be taken literally and they will feel ashamed for not having given that possibility proper consideration.</p>\n<p>To answer your question: If you are dismissing entirely the possibility that the stories in the Torah are scientifically accurate then you have strayed from the path of what is fundamentally required of a Jew.</p>\n<p>However, if you just mean to say that given the context, arguments, and possibilities you have been presented so far, you lean towards the understanding that the stories in the Torah are not meant to be taken literally, yet remain open to the other possibility, and fearful that, indeed, the reverse may be true then you are well within the confines of Orthodox Judaism.</p>\n<p>Although as others have pointed out, there exist people who consider themselves Orthodox Jews yet do not demonstrate Yiras Shamayim, and others who do, yet do not identify as Orthodox.</p>\n\n\n",

Is the custom to permit vocals, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/103748\">however that’s defined</a>, and would include anything which sounds like vocals? Or is there something unique about actual vocals which wouldn't extend to computer-generated?</p>\n<p>I'd assume that computer-generated vocals couldn't be any worse than a recording of human vocals, regarding which many are lenient, but perhaps there's a distinction between something which was at some point an actual human voice and something which was never a human voice (though I can't imagine why).</p>\n<p>Yes, this question extends to any other such situation of an instrument which sounds like a human. I only ask in this type of situation because in my experience it’s the most common such example.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Here's my unsourced, albeit serious answer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This and numerous other arguments depend on one distinction - <strong>do we follow the source or the target</strong>, in other words, because this comes out of a musical instrument it is forbidden, or because it sounds to us as such.</p></li>\n<li><p>Here, the standard approach is that we follow the source, no matter how it sounds, here's why all the Charedi radio stations love the new wave of Bobby's \"Don't worry be happy\".</p></li>\n<li><p>Although there's always a \"מראית עין\" indirect prohibition, it is always temporal, until people get used to, for example, (it always drives me mad) all the \"Chometz-like\" Kosher products on Pesach indistinguishable from the originals (cakes, pizzas, rolls, etc).</p></li>\n<li><p>Usually, we follow the rule that we don't extend Rabbinical decrees on new things, not covered originally, even if they look alike. THere's probably no Shu\"A on computer music, but, based on  #2 we should forbid it as being \"not voice-based.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>However, while far from being a Posek, I tend to allow that, because of three reasons: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It is not considered an instrument and not listed in the original list of forbidden ones.</p></li>\n<li><p>I would speculate, that just as writing on a computer is not considered writing (like deleting holy names), <em>maybe</em> computer music is not music at all, even if it <em>appears</em> to us as such (as dots on a screen appear as writing).</p></li>\n<li><p>The abundance of computer music minimizes the enjoyment and makes it a commodity and our reality is very far from what was some 2000 or 500 years ago, for example, having a shower every day is not considered luxury anymore, it's a must, similarly, the music became a sort of a background we live in, and therefore the prohibition would be lessened significantly.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Rav Yisroel Belsky wrote a letter which was published on Matzav.com (see <a href=\"https://matzav.com/p%E2%80%99sak-from-rav-yisroel-belsky-and-rav-shlomo-miller-on-acappella-music-during-sefirah-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) about a capella music.</p>\n\n<p>He points out that even vocal music which is altered or enhanced electronically stops being called a capella and becomes regular music. He makes a clear distinction between pure a capella (like a choir) versus vocal+enhancement.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem clear that according to Rav Belsky, electronic music would be a problem even if it sounded like pure vocals. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7025/21984\">here</a> where he quotes the brief synopsis of the teshuva; but it's worth seeing the whole teshuva inside at the above link in order to understand the distinctions being made. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there any Jewish translation of the Hebrew Bible that is available in several different languages worldwide?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From what I understand, the Jewish tradition is very insistent that translations of the Hebrew Bible accurately reflect the original text. </p>\n\n<p>Because of this, several Jewish English Bible translations have been produced - specifically by Jews and for Jews.</p>\n\n<p>I am wondering, however, if there is any particular Jewish English translation of the Hebrew Bible that is also available in several different languages worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>I have 2 reasons for asking this question:</p>\n\n<p>(1) The several <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_English_Bible_translations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish English Bible translations</a> that I have come across (produced specifically by Jews and for Jews) are not available in any language other than English</p>\n\n<p>(2) A while back ago, I asked <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/95789/is-there-a-surviving-jewish-translation-of-the-entire-masoretic-text-in-greek\">this question</a> about whether or not there is a Jewish Greek Bible translation (other than the Septuagint, which is not used by Jews outside of Beta Israel, or the 1547 Yevanic Greek Torah in the \"Constantinople Pentateuch,\" which only includes the first 5 books, or the Greek translation by Aquila/Onkelos, which has not survived apart from a few fragments.) I did not get any answers.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think that for the most part, Jewish translations of the Bible are made directly from the original Hebrew text into the given foreign language, rather than translated from one foreign language into another<sup>1</sup>. So, while it's likely that there are Jewish Bible translations out there in Aramaic, Arabic, Spanish, German, Russian, Yiddish, English, etc., most of them will have been done as independent projects, each to suit a particular Jewish Diaspora population in a given era, and few of them are likely to have been done as coordinated multilingual projects or as secondary translations of each other. Therefore, I doubt that there is a body of work out there that represents a single Jewish translation into many languages.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. Two exceptions that I can think of are: a) the Aramaic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Onkelos\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Targum Onkelos</a> on the Pentateuch, which has achieved canonical status as an interpretive text in its own right, and which has therefore been translated (multiple times - see Versions <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Onkelos_Genesis?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) into English and probably some other languages; and b) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>'s German interpretive translation of the Pentateuch, which has been translated in turn <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/the-hirsch-chumash\" rel=\"noreferrer\">into English</a>, to capture R' Hirsch's interpretive spin.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Achitophel was known to have advised David HaMelech, circa 1000 BCE, whereas Socrates had lived between 470-399 BCE. It was also known that Achitophel died when he was 33 years old, as per Masechet Sanhedrin 69b, \"And it is written: “Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days” (Psalms 55:24). And in keeping with this verse, it is taught in a baraita: All of Doeg’s years were only thirty-four and Ahithophel’s were only thirty-three\".</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Rabbinical literature, the expression \"קיבל ממישהו\" does not mean literally \"was his disciple\" but \"received his heritage\" or \"followed his teachings\" like in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.4?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 1</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"אַנְטִיגְנוֹס אִישׁ סוֹכוֹ קִבֵּל מִשִּׁמְעוֹן הַצַּדִּיק.<br>\n  Antigonus a man of Socho received [the oral tradition] from Shimon the Righteous.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chronologically it appears that there are big gaps between Rabbis mentioned in that Mishna, although it uses the term \"קיבל מהם\" extensively and the list does not account for 400-500 years of the Rabbis mentioned.</p>\n\n\n",

Gloss: Some say that nowadays we adopt a lenient view regarding this [type] of mourning with respect to those who mourn with him, for this is only out of respect to those who observe mourning rites, but now it is the common practice to forego [this honour], and thus is the accepted practice nowadays, [viz.,] not to mourn at all with those who observe mourning rites. He who adopts a stringent view in this [matter] is one of those who make people wonder [at their strange conduct]. Nevertheless, it is the accepted practice that all the near-of-kin of the dead person who are disqualified to offer testimony in his behalf, exhibit some [signs] of mourning [by placing] themselves [under this stringency] the first entire week, i.e., until after the first Sabbath [in] that they do not wash [themselves] nor change some of their clothes as on other Sabbaths. There are, however, localities where the accepted usage is to adopt additional stringencies in other matters [pertaining to this type of mourning], but the fundamental principle is as I have written [above]... One who desires to place himself under a stringency, [viz.,] to observe mourning rites for one for whom he is not dutibound [to mourn], or to put on dark clothes [in mourning] for his near-of-kin, is not reproved [for doing so].

In what respect? If his son's son dies, or his son's brother, or the mother of his son, he is required to rend in the presence of his son. So too, does he rend for his father-in-law and his mother-in-law, and a woman rends for her father-in-law and her mother-in-law. (Nowadays we do not follow this practice as will be explained infra §374 in the subject of mourning.) (text and translation from Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, if the mourners insist the grandchild would have to act like a mourner in pretty much all respects while in front of them. Commonly though the mourners do not insist. Use of common sense to fit in and not offend the mourners is key.</p>\n<p>(I'll say that even stronger: the grandchild is not in the thick of it like his parent is and is in a unique position to offer much needed support, so helping his parent in whatever way works best in their situation is a enormous act of kindness and is to be actively encouraged. Forget about the technical laws and do whatever is best for the real mourners which might indeed mean looking distraught and not shaving or bathing, but might not. Focus on the goal here not on the means.)</p>\n<p>You can find some discussion in Rishonim trying to obligate grandchildren in particular in more mourning due to the obligation to honor a grandparent in Or Zarua 2:428.</p>\n\n\n",

But as God is interested not only in people's bodies, but also their minds, hearts, desires, souls, etc, so God's covenant concerns not only physical acts but also what is in our minds and hearts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deuteronomy 6:4-6 (Judaica)</p>\n<p>Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God; the Lord is one.<br />\nAnd you shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your means.<br />\nAnd these words, which I command you this day, shall be upon your heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Circumcision of the heart is a metaphor which appears in Jeremiah. As the prophet rebukes Israel for their many sins, and in particular for their faithlessness as they served idols rather than the true God, he calls them to repentance with the promise that they will escape God's punishment if they circumcise their hearts to the Lord. I think in context it symbolises not only general holy living, but also in particular the rejection of idolatry (שִׁקּוּץ).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jeremiah 4:1-4 (Judaica)</p>\n<p>If you return, O Israel, says the Lord, to Me, you shall return, and if you remove your detestable things (שִׁקּוּצֶ֛יךָ) from My Presence, you shall not wander.</p>\n<p>And you will swear, \"As the Lord lives,\" in truth and in justice and in righteousness, nations will bless themselves with him and boast about him.</p>\n<p>For so said the Lord to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: Plow for yourself a furrow, and do not sow upon thorns.</p>\n<p>Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and remove the foreskins of your heart, O people of Judah and dwellers of Jerusalem, lest My anger go forth and burn with none to quench it because of the evil of your deeds.</p>\n<p>Jeremiah 9:24-25 (Judaica)</p>\n<p>Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, when I will punish every circumcised one with his uncircumcision.</p>\n<p>Egypt, Judah, Edom, the children of Ammon, Moab, and all those cast off to the corners, who dwell in the desert, for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are of uncircumcised hearts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It appears that for the Forefathers it was only in the form of roots, hence hidden, Moses got the stem (Matan Torah) and it was united and undivided and could contain all the Halochos that will eventually branch from it. Later in the 1st Temple they dealt with big branches of domains and when it arrived at the point when the Oral Torah was written (Midrash and Mishnah) it was already on the level of lesser branches, where the Mishnaic Rabbis didn't know/deal with the structure, only further developing.</p>\n\n\n",

Here's the gemara's description, from Menachos 39a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכמה שיעור חוליא? תניא ,רבי אומר כדי שיכרוך וישנה וישלש, תאנא הפוחת לא יפחות משבע, והמוסיף לא יוסיף על שלוש עשרה. הפוחת לא יפחות משבע – כנגד שבעה רקיעים, והמוסיף לא יוסיף על שלש עשרה – כנגד שבעה רקיעין וששה אוירין שביניהם.</p>\n<p>And what is the measurement of a chuliyah (link)?</p>\n<p>A [beraisa] was repeated: Rebbe would say that it is so that you can wind once, then again, and a third time.</p>\n<p>[Another beraisa] was repeated: If you minimize -- do not have less than seven, and if you maximize -- do not have more than thirteen.</p>\n<p>If you minimize -- do not have less than seven, corresponding to the seven heavens.</p>\n<p>If you maximize -- do not have more than thirteen, corresponding to the seven heavens and the spaces between them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most rishonim explain the gemara to mean that one should have 7 to 8 chuliyos, each of three windings.</p>\n<p>However, it could be understood that the second beraisa is answering the first question -- the size of a chuliah is 7 to 13 windings, and the number of chuliyos isn't being discussed.</p>\n<p>Here's the Raavad on Hilkhos Tzitzis 1:7, quoting Rav Natrunai Gaon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תב הראב”ד ז”ל /א”א/ זה הסדר אין לו שרש ולא ענף ולמה יותר בתכלת מבלבן שהוא מין כנף וממנו מתחיל ובו מסיים ובכריכותיו הוא ממעט אין זה כי אם שגיון גדול, והגאון רב נטרונאי ז”ל סידר אותו יפה סידור נאה מאד על דרך שאמרה ההלכה, וכמה שיעור חוליא כדי שיכרוך וישנה וישלש אתכלת קאי, ותנא דתנא הפוחת לא יפחות משבעה על הכריכות קאי שהן שלש מן התכלת וארבע מן הלבן מפני שמתחיל בלבן ומסיים בלבן, קושר תחלה סמוך לכנף קשר אחד בחוט לבן ובחוט של תכלת והוא שנקרא קשר העליון ואחר כך כורך שני חוטין אחד של לבן ואחד של תכלת עד שש כריכות והשביעית לבן לבדו וזהו שבע שאמרנו והן חוליא אחת ואלו הכריכות כולן על ששה החוטין המשלשלים והמשולשלים בכנף ובענין זה עושה ה’ קשרים ובין כל קשר וקשר חוליא של שבע כריכות כאשר אמרנו, ונהגו לעשות חוליא אחת בשני קשרים סמוך לכנף ושתי חוליות בסוף הגדיל עם שלשה קשרים ובאמצע כורך בלא דקדוק בין מכונס בין מפוזר בתכלת ולבן עכ”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, he has each chuliah being alternating white-blue-white-blue... white -- always begin and end with white, with a minimum of three windings of blue, and therefore 4 of white -- for a minimum total of 7.</p>\n<p>The problem with the more common understanding (Rashi, Rambam, Tosafos, Chinukh...) is that 7 to 13 chulios would mean 8 to 14 knots. But the Sifri (and the Tanchuma) famously quoted by Rashi (Bamidbar 15:39), says only 5 knots as part of how the tzitzis remind us to do the mitzvos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֶׁמִּנְיַן גִּימַטְרִיָּא שֶׁל צִיצִית שֵׁשׁ מֵאוֹת, וּשְׁמוֹנָה חוּטִין וַחֲמִשָּׁה קְשָׁרִים הֲרֵי תרי\"ג</p>\n<p>Because the gemmartria total of tzitzis [90+10+10+400] is 600, with the 8 strings and the 5 knots equals Taryag [the 613 of mitzvos].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice there is no problem according to the Raavad and Rav Natrunai Gaon. The gemara doesn't say the number of chulios, so the Sifri's 5 knots can be fulfilled with 5 knots with chulios of 7 to 13 windings between them. Exactly what Ashkenazim and many Sepharadi communities do. (Other Sepharadi communities have 10-5-6-5 windings, where three of them don't reach the minimum. Either they hold that only one chuliyah has to reach the minimum, or they do not hold like this opinion; see the next idea.)</p>\n<p>But the Mordechai (on Menachos ad loc) gives another resolution, or at least a temporary avoidance of the problem. He says that chuliyos are a law in tekheiles. If one is wearing white strings, there is no grouping the windings into threes, and no number of groupings. And he holds this is why Rashi and Tosafos tell you to follow the Sifri, and do not say anything on the beraisa we quoted above which would imply otherwise.</p>\n<p>And we know Tosafos do NOT hold like the Raavad; they have chulios of three windings white, then three blue, then three white -- each a chuliyah.</p>\n<p>Which gives us another potential resolution. If chuliyos are defined by switching colors, one need not begin and end each chuliyah with a knot. And so Rav Amram Gaon only has one double knot, then alternating bands of three windings: blue, white, blue, and so on for 13 windings. (The windings themselves are the outside of a different kind of knot, in case you're wondering how they stay with no knot at the bottom.) A simple solution if you follow the gemara to the exclusion of the Sifri.</p>\n<p>The Chinuch and the Tosafos each describe ways of breaking up the chulios into groups with 5 double knots. Because they hold chuliyos are three windings of the same color. Which really justifies the Mordechai's position that there is no need for chuliyos without tekheiles -- you can't switch colors when all the windings are white!</p>\n<p>One last approach (which is two) to chuliyos is the Rambam's. He defines chuliyos as being separated by knots.</p>\n<p>The Yemenites understand the Rambam as ignoring the Sifri and therefore has no conflict to deal with. Which could well be; he gives special authority to the Mishnah, Tosafta, Talmud Yerushalmi and Talmud Bavli over Chazal's other works like the Sifri. And so they have a double knot, 13 chulios of windings that are the outside of their own knots, and then a double knot. There are bapts between the chulios. The first winding of the first chuliah and the last winding of the bottom one are white.</p>\n<p>The Baal haTanya implemented the Rambam's idea by implementing two kinds of knots. The Sifri is taken as describing 5 double knots. These are separated by 7, 8, 11, and 13 windings, respectively, as per normal Ashkenazi custom. BUT, on the side of the windings is a \"daisy chain\", the \"shamash\" string loops back every third winding to group them into chuliyos. This means:\nknot - 3, 3, 1 - knot - 2, 3, 3 - knot - 3, 3, 3, 2 - knot - 1, 3, 3, 3, 3 - knot</p>\n<p>Notice that two of the chulios are not in a single side-knot, but are split by double knots.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>At least one chulya of 3 is a necessary requirement.  The Gemara explains this explicitly that one chulya is necessary and a chulya is defined as 3 wrappings  (whether they have to be complete wrappings or just look like 3 is a discussion in the poskim). Seven is the preffered minimum and thirteen is the maximum amount. (Simple reading of the gemara is the 7 and 13 numbers are referring to chuliyos,however see Tosfos which indicate a minimum for krichos).</p>\n\n<p>Text of the Menachos 39a:</p>\n\n<p>ואפילו לא כרך בה אלא חוליא אחת כשרה ונויי תכלת שליש גדיל ושני שלישי ענף וכמה שיעור חוליא תניא רבי אומר כדי שיכרוך וישנה וישלש תאנא הפוחת לא יפחות משבע והמוסיף לא יוסיף על שלש עשרה הפוחת לא יפחות משבע כנגד שבעה רקיעים והמוסיף לא יוסיף על שלש עשרה כנגד שבעה רקיעין וששה אוירין שביניהם</p>\n\n\n",

They can only lose that status by being broken or (for some materials) being immersed. See, for instance, Kelim 2:1, 11:1, 15:1, 30:1.</p>\n\n<p>Additional \"useless\" parts of the object can become Mekabel Tumah if one intends to use them for a set purpose (or actually does so), but nothing can lose its status of Mekabel Tumah until the Kli is broken enough that it is useless for its primary purpose (or it is separated from the Kli). Additional destruction may be necessary if destroying the Kli does not make the part useless on its own.</p>\n\n<p>A \"baker's oven\" was built with the intention that part of it will be used for resting the roasting spit.

(personal note. Tana Kama holds that stuck to the ground by clay is better than stuck into the ground, it's the difference between the case of the Tosefta and the case of the Mishna)</p>\n  \n  <p>אבל נתנם על גבי האבן וחברם לה חשיב חיבור\n  הואיל והאבן מחברתן שהיא מטלטלת ביחד עמהן שחיברן זו לזו בטיט בראשן.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rash comes back to the explanation that we discuss about the susceptibility to be unclean by the specific uncleanness of utensils of terracotta. But if he put the nails on the stone and attach them to it, they are attached each to other because the stone is movable together with the nails. The stone attaches them each to another. They have balls of terracotta on their top and on the bottom they are attached each to other and they are an utensil of terracotta</p>\n  \n  <p>ולאידך לישנא דפירש שחיברן בארץ בטיט </p>\n  \n  <p>According to the explanation that we discuss the absolute susceptibility to be unclean, Rabbi Yehuda needs that they need to be attached one to other by clay and Tana Kama they can be attached to the ground independently one from other.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is indeed a difference between a nail stuck into the ground and a nail stuck by clay on the ground. The second is stronger. Cementing on the ground is stronger. Maybe that when using it is warm and the clay become very strong.  </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# According to those who argue on R’ Yehudah, why do we bring the Shtei HaLechem on Shavuos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rosh Hashanah 16a quotes the following teaching:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר יהודה משום ר\"ע ... מפני מה אמרה תורה הביאו שתי הלחם בעצרת מפני שעצרת זמן פירות האילן הוא אמר הקב\"ה הביאו לפני שתי הלחם בעצרת כדי שיתברכו לכם פירות האילן</p>\n  \n  <p>R’ Yehudah said in the name of R’ Akiva, “...Why did the Torah say to bring two loaves on Shavuos? Because Shavuos is the time of the fruit of the tree. Hashem said: ‘Bring before Me two loaves on Shavuos so that the fruit of the tree will be blessed for you.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi (DH Shtei HaLechem) explains the connection between the loaves and the judging of fruit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שתי הלחם - ירצו על פירות האילן שהן מתירין להביא בכורים שאין מביאין בכורים קודם לעצרת דכתיב (שמות ל״ד:כ״ב) בכורי קציר חטים ואני שמעתי דרבי יהודה לטעמיה דהא אזלא כמאן דאמר בסנהדרין (דף ע:) עץ שאכל אדם הראשון חטה היתה:</p>\n  \n  <p>They make the fruit of the tree accepted because they permit the bringing of Bikkurim, as we do not bring Bikkurim before Shavuos, as it is written, “The first of the wheat harvest.” I heard that R’ Yehudah is going according to his own reasoning, for this goes according to the one who says in Sanhedrin (70b) that the tree from which Adam ate was a wheat stalk. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s all well and good according to R’ Yehudah, but what about those who argue on him regarding the Tree of Knowledge that it wasn’t a wheat stalk? To quote the full discussion in Sanhedrin 70a-b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר\"מ אומר אותו אילן שאכל אדם הראשון ממנו גפן היה שאין לך דבר שמביא יללה לאדם אלא יין ר' יהודה אומר חטה היה שאין התינוק יודע לקרוא אבא ואימא עד שיטעום טעם דגן רבי נחמיה אומר תאנה היה שבדבר שקלקלו בו נתקנו שנאמר (בראשית ג, ז) ויתפרו עלה תאנה </p>\n  \n  <p>R’ Meir says, “The tree from which Adam ate was a grape vine, for there’s nothing which brings wailing upon a person except wine.” R’ Yehudah says, “It was a wheat stalk, for a child doesn’t know how to call his parents until he’s tasted grain.” R’ Nechemiah says, “It was a fig tree, for with that with which they sinned they fixed, as it says, ‘They sewed fig leaves.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want to say that in principle R’ Meir and R’ Nechemiah hold that a wheat stalk is considered a tree, but for their rationales cited above they hold that Adam ate from a different tree, then why does Berachos 40a emphasize that it’s specifically R’ Yehudah’s opinion that wheat is a tree:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על פירות הארץ וכו׳: פשיטא אמר רב נחמן בר יצחק לא נצרכה אלא לרבי יהודה דאמר חטה מין אילן היא</p>\n  \n  <p>”On the fruit of the land, [if one said ‘Who created the fruit of the tree,’ he didn’t fulfill his obligation].” This is obvious! Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said, “It’s only needed for R’ Yehudah, who says that wheat is a type of tree...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara then quotes the above Braisa regarding the Tree of Knowledge. Its wording sounds to me as to imply that it’s specifically R’ Yehudah who holds that wheat is a tree. </p>\n\n<p>If the other Tannaim don’t hold that wheat is considered fruit, how do they explain why we bring the Shtei HaLechem on Shavuos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_HaChinukh.307.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaChinuch 307</a> refers to what he wrote in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_HaChinukh.302.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">302</a> (regarding the Omer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is from the roots of the commandment [that it is] in order that we contemplate, through [this] deed, the great kindness that God, blessed be He, does for His creatures, to renew the grain each year for [our] nourishment. Therefore it is fitting for us that we should sacrifice to Him, blessed be He, from it - so that we remember His kindness and His great goodness before we benefit from it. And from that which we become fitting for blessing by the refinement of our deeds in front of Him, our grain will be blessed, and God's will for us will be fulfilled - as He desires blessing for His creatures, from His great goodness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In 307 he adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And my heart also tells me about the matter that because of [the following] was the commandment of wheat to be an offering of loaves of bread, and in the offering of barley with flour. Since wheat is for the food of man - and so it is fitting to prepare it in a way that man would enjoy and be nourished from it. And all of this is from the root that we planted at the beginning of the matter of the sacrifice from the angle of the simple understanding - that through the deed is the thought of a man aroused to things (Sefer HaChinukh 95). And therefore, according to the importance of the sacrifice and its goodly preparation is the heart of a man more aroused to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While he is not directly addressing your question, he provides a reason for the bringing of the Shtei HaLechem which is not dependent on R. Yehudah’s opinion.</p>\n\n<p>To address the point about why this offering is brought specifically on Shavu'ot, note that Sefer HaChinuch talks about contemplating <strong>G-d’s kindness in renewing the grain each year</strong>. Shavu’ot, as a harvest festival (see e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.23.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 23:16</a>), is the perfect time to do this.</p>\n\n\n",

On page 9 he explains that it is prohibited to be in a Chidon together with non-Jews, and on page 12 he writes that it is prohibited to participate alongside those who reject Torah and Mitzvot, and says that it would even be prohibited to listen to the Chidon.</p>\n<p>However, in Gilyonos Derech Hashem 001-070 page 267 (found on Otzar Hachochma), Rabbi Yitzchak Yosef mentions that his father used to listen to the Chidon Hatanach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/40dft.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/40dft.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Whilst they don't talk about the Chidon HaTanach specifically, a Chinuch perspective about these sorts of competitions is provided by both Rav Shlomo Wolbe zt\"l and the Slonimer Rebbe zt\"l. Although the notion of \"קנאת סופרים תרבה חכמה\" – “Jealousy amongst scholars increases wisdom” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.21a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 21a</a>) is generally regarded as permitted in order to motivate one’s students, the long-term fallout tends to be more destructive.</p>\n<p>The Slonimer Rebbe in his Nesivei Chinuch (chapt 6, p.41) talks about the recent phenomenon of Mishna competitions and the like that are often surrounded in much pageantry and fanfare. These competitions are devised to get the child to learn reams of משניות off by heart. Although the end result makes for an impressive display of לימוד תורה, once the contest is over, the initial drive and enthusiasm fizzles out. Moreover, while there may be a winner, there are many more losers, which is not an easy thing for a child to experience, especially given the level of effort they expended in preparation for the competition.</p>\n<p>He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לדעתי אם טוב הוא בשביל חינוך סטנדרטי בכדי לעורר קנאת ופרים אך לא טוב הוא בשביל חינוך יותר עילאי ומזיק יותר משמועיל</p>\n<p>“According to my opinion, whilst they are good for standard education in order to awaken a sense of (permitted) competitive spirit, nevertheless for the more elevated type of education we seek for our children, the effects of such competitions are more damaging than helpful”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>HaRav Shlomo Wolbe also adds that the כבוד, the honour gained by the winning participants, stays with them for a long time. The result ensures that they acquire a mind-set where they think they know everything, thereby losing the will to exert themselves, a vital factor needed in their spiritual growth.

Bold font is just for emphasis.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>1: Context</strong> (Ignore this part if you want only the plain answer with no explanation).</p>\n<p>Biblical Hebrew <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segolate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Segolates</a> are nouns that end in a single unstressed Segol, like מֶלֶךְ, צֶדֶק, and קֹדֶשׁ. They originate from nouns of the form CVCC; or in other words, they originally contained only a single vowel and ended in a consonant cluster. For example, מֶלֶךְ /ˈmēlekh/ was originally pronounced as /malk/, צֶדֶק /ˈṣēdeq/ as /ṣidq/, and קֹדֶשׁ /ˈqōdesh/ as /qudsh/.</p>\n<p>Segolates had a <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_plural#Hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">broken plural</a>. Thus, for example, the plural form of /malk/ was not the expected /malˈkīm/, but rather, /̩mal<strong>a</strong>ˈkīm/, with an additional short /a/ vowel. Similarly, the plural form of /qudsh/ was not /qudˈshīm/, but /ˌqud<strong>a</strong>ˈshīm/.</p>\n<p>Eventually, sometime before the Masoretic era, the additional short /a/ vowel in these forms was lengthened to a long vowel. Thus, /ˌmal<strong>a</strong>ˈkīm/ became /ˌmal<strong>ā</strong>ˈkīm/, and /ˌqud<strong>a</strong>ˈshīm/ became /ˌqud<strong>ā</strong>ˈshīm/.</p>\n<p>In the very early Masoretic Era, in some pronunciation traditions, short /u/ evolved to short /o/. <em>Thus, /ˌq<strong>u</strong>dāˈshīm/ became /ˌq<strong>o</strong>dāˈshīm/.</em></p>\n<p>A bit later, in the Tiberian Masoretic pronunciation, long /ā/ had shifted to long /ɔ̄/, and short /o/ had shifted to short /ɔ/. This, in addition to other sound changes, meant /ˌqodāˈshīm/ became /ˌqɔðɔ̄ˈshīm/.</p>\n<p>In the Tiberian pronunciation, under certain conditions, vowels with secondary stress were lengthened. This includes the first vowel of the word /ˌq<strong>ɔ</strong>ðɔ̄ˈshīm/, which was lengthened to /ɔ̄/. This vocalization was recorded as קָֽדָשִׁים, with an initial full Kamatz, explicitly marked long with a meteg/ga’ya. [<a href=\"https://books.openedition.org/obp/16827#anchor-toc-1-35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Khan I.2.3.2</a>; see paragraphs 78-79.]</p>\n<p>In the Palestinian vowel system, the aforementioned vowel shifts (from short /o/ to short /ɔ/, and from long /ā/ to long /ɔ̄/) didn’t occur. When users of the Palestinian vowel system attempted to transpose their pronunciation on Tiberian-vocalized manuscripts, they noticed that the Tiberian short /ɔ/ (Kamatz Kattan) usually corresponded to the Palestinian short /o/; and, that the Tiberian long /ɔ̄/ (Kamatz Gadol) corresponded to the Palestinian long /ā/.<br />\nTherefore, when these readers came upon the word קָֽדָשִׁים, <strong>they assumed the first Kamatz corresponded to long /ā/, <em>even though it actually came from a lengthened short /o/.</em></strong> If that lengthening had taken place <em>before</em> the vowel shift, the first vowel <em>would have</em> been transcribed with a Cholam.</p>\n<p>Note that this lengthening didn’t apply to words like <strong>הַ</strong>קֳּדָשִׁים, where the secondary stress is <em>not</em> on the first Kamatz. In this word, that Kamatz remains short, and the users of the Palestinian pronunciation <strong>correctly</strong> assumed it corresponded to a short /o/.</p>\n<p><strong>2: Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Nowadays, we pronounce the vowel as a Kamatz Gadol, and that is the official status of the vowel. That’s the basic answer.</p>\n<p>However, it could be argued that we <em>should</em> pronounce the vowel as if it were a Cholam, because it comes from a lengthened Kamatz Kattan. (This would be especially, but not exclusively, relevant to those who pronounce Kamatz Kattan as a short /o/).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, some families claim to have a Mesorah that this vowel should be pronounced as a Cholam. This makes perfect sense, considering the vowel’s origin.</p>\n<p>Personally, when reading from the Torah or serving as a Chazzan, I pronounce it as a Kamatz Gadol; but when praying privately, I pronounce it as a Cholam.</p>\n\n\n",

The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch lived before laser printing. See the questions linked <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/130378/kedusha-status-of-modern-seforim\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/83998/why-is-public-reading-of-the-haftarah-not-required-to-be-from-parchment/84007#comment387831_84007\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Kitzur shulchan also gives an order to how to stack sefarim (28:4) and a notebook isn't mentioned. If this notebook had a chumash or part of chumash written into it this would tell you where to stack chumash but if it only has lines in it then at least according the kitzur shulchan aruch the notebook would have to be underneath these sefarim.</p>\n<p>Even with the approach that all book bound sefarim have the same level of kedusha as apposed to scrolls the empty notebook itself would contain no kedusha without anything relevant written in it to justify placing it on top of a sefer of any type.</p>\n\n\n",

All the commentaries (including the Talmud on 4b) describe this act by way of the word בדיקה (checking). Meaning the verb פקד is never formally used to describe that same action.

They discuss the differentiation between checking by way of seeing or specific checking with a cloth, and their legal ramifications. From this it would seems that there are two types of checking. One which includes using a cloth and one which does not. This discussion wants to further expound on Rashi that the Mishnah speaks of the former form. </p>\n\n<p>Rashash ties this in to the specific language used in the Mishnah. He seems to say that פקידה refers specifically to the former, which is the intent of the Rashi and this Mishnah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>הגהות וחדושי הרש\"ש:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עי' רש\"ל ומהר\"ם. ול\"נ דמלישנא דפקידה לפקידה מוכח דהשתא מצאה ע\"י פקידה דהיינו בדיקה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

After all, the Torah used to be a working law in ancient Israel. There should have been some records on how it's actually interpreted by their supreme court thingy.</p>\n\n<p>So what's the story?</p>\n\n<p>I want Judaism perspective and actual historical perspective. How was the verse actually interpreted by ancient Jewish judges?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Indeed, the classic Jewish understanding of this verse is that \"Yatza [Yasa] Yeladeha\" means the incitement of a miscarriage, which is only liable to a fine, not the death penalty.</p>\n<p>This is evident from the Talmud in Kesubos 29b, that learns from this verse, the concept of \"Kim Lei Bederaba Minei\" - when a person is faced with multiple punishments for a single act - they only receive the worst of the punishments. It learns this from the implication that only <em>if</em> there is no <em>Asone</em> (tragedy, i.e. death of the mother) does one have to pay for the fetus, implying that if there is an <em>Asone</em> than one will no longer have to pay for the fetus, as they are now subject to the death penalty.</p>\n<p>If <em>Asone</em> was referring to the death of the child as is suggested in that article, then the Talmudic derivation would make no sense, given that if they killed the child there would be no damages to pay for injuring the child. Therefore it is clear that the Talmudic understanding is that the Asone is referring to the death of the mother.</p>\n<p>However, that said, it would incorrect to generalize from here that the Jewish perspective is that the fetus does not have the value of a human life, as there are other sources that may suggest otherwise. For Example: The Talmud Sanhedrin 57b that suggests that the verse in Genesis 9:6 prescribes the death penalty for killing a fetus (seemingly in contradiction to Exodus 21:22, see Rashi in Sanhedrin for a resolution).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Sanhedrin 57b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשכח ר' יעקב בר אחא דהוה כתיב בספר אגדתא דבי רב בן נח נהרג ... משום רבי ישמעאל אמרו אף על העוברין מנהני מילי אמר רב יהודה דאמר קרא ... משום רבי ישמעאל אמרו אף על העוברין מאי טעמיה דרבי ישמעאל דכתיב (בראשית ט) שופך דם האדם באדם דמו ישפך איזהו אדם שהוא באדם הוי אומר זה עובר שבמעי אמו</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara says according to R Yishmael that a non Jew can get the death penalty if he kills a fetus. This is taught as an explanation of the verse in Genesis 9.5</p>\n  \n  <p>וְאַ֨ךְ אֶת־דִּמְכֶ֤ם לְנַפְשֹֽׁתֵיכֶם֙ אֶדְרֹ֔שׁ מִיַּ֥ד כָּל־חַיָּ֖ה אֶדְרְשֶׁ֑נּוּ וּמִיַּ֣ד הָֽאָדָ֗ם מִיַּד֙ אִ֣ישׁ אָחִ֔יו אֶדְרֹ֖שׁ שֹׁפֵךְ֙ דַּ֣ם הָֽאָדָ֔ם בָּֽאָדָ֖ם דָּמ֣וֹ יִשָּׁפֵ֑ךְ כִּ֚י בְּצֶ֣לֶם אֱלֹהִ֔ים עָשָׂ֖ה אֶת־הָֽאָדָֽם׃‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Whoever sheds man’s blood, by [inside] man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God he made man.</p>\n  \n  <p>Who is the man who is inside a man? A fetus. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The explanation of Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אף על העוברין - הכה את האשה ויצאו ילדיה נהרג עליהן ובישראל עד שיצא לאויר העולם כדתנן במס' [נדה] (דף מד.) תינוק בן יום אחד ההורגו חייב היכא דקים ליה בגוויה שכלו לו חדשיו ואינו נפל:‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>For the fetuses. He strikes a woman and she has an abortion. He get a death penalty. But for a Jewish man, he would not be punished until he kills a child who already born. We learn this from a Mishna (44a) in Masechet Nidda. If he kills a newborn who is born after the term of the pregnancy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the Gemara Nidda 44b explains the source of this rule for Jews:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכתיב (ויקרא כד, יז) ואיש כי יכה כל נפש מ\"מ: והרי הוא לאביו ולאמו ולכל קרוביו כחתן שלם: </p>\n  \n  <p>From the verse (Leviticus 24.17) </p>\n  \n  <p>וְאִ֕ישׁ כִּ֥י יַכֶּ֖ה כָּל־נֶ֣פֶשׁ אָדָ֑ם מ֖וֹת יוּמָֽת׃‏</p>\n  \n  <p>And he who kills any (soul) man shall surely be put to death. </p>\n  \n  <p>a soul - whatever it is. Indeed a newborn is very important (as a young married) for his parents and family members. (Rashi explains that this explanation emphasizes the difference between a newborn and a fetus.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The verse tells us explicitly that the penalty for causing the death of a fetus (in a fight, at least) is monetary and not capital punishment.  (Rashi <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882/showrashi/true#v22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> how the amount is computed.)  Even though the fetus will one day become a human if the pregnancy isn't interrupted, causing its death when it is a fetus is a matter of <em>damages</em>, not <em>murder</em>.  Since the torah tells us this explicitly, it would be hard to argue for a stronger penalty.  \"Life for life\" does not apply here.</p>\n\n<p>The Christian source you quote tries to make the argument that <em>yasa</em> only refers to living things, therefore a fetus is alive, therefore \"life for life\" should apply.  That is not a credible Jewish interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>When the torah says \"life for life\" it means <em>human</em> life, which we can learn from the fact that if you cause the death of someone else's livestock, that too is a <em>monetary</em> case and not a <em>capital</em> case.  If you had to give up your life because of an ox, that would not be \"life for life\"; it would be a disproportionate penalty.  The same is true with regard to a fetus.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, this interpretation is not about a \"primitive society\" not knowing better and thus not valuing a fetus.  This is the <em>halacha</em> today (or would be if we had capital punishment so you could tell the difference), and ours is not a primitive society.  It's not about not valuing the fetus; it's about priorities.  Actual born humans have the status of \"human\"; a fetus does not yet have that status, but as a potential human it is still valuable and many <em>poskim</em> forbid abortion in most cases.  We do not say that a fetus is unimportant and mere property; we say that a fetus has a different, lesser status than a human does, one for which only monetary damages apply.</p>\n\n\n",

Notice that both are problematic. If it's compensatory damage, then Bill Gates can just murder someone and pay for it.</li>\n<li>If life for life means capital punishments why does eye for eye means compensatory damage? <strong>That looks very inconsistent</strong>.

If the wound was healed but reopened,\n   healed again but reopened, he would still be under obligation to heal\n   him. If, however, the wound had completely healed [even though it may\n   have reopened much later] he would no longer be under obligation to\n   heal him. </p>\n\n<p>-<strong>Incapacitation</strong>:  The wages lost during the period of illness must be reimbursed.</p>\n\n<p>-<strong>Mental anguish</strong>:  Must be calculated in accordance with the status of the offender and the offended.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of Jewish justice is not so much punishment of the guilty as restoration of the victim. Putting out the eye of the offender does not help the victim one bit, but financial compensation does. Whether the offender is rich or poor is a secondary matter and immaterial to the victim. In the case of murder, however, no restoration of the victim is possible, so a different resolution is necessary. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Gemara on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.83b.7-8?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kama 83b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמאי (שמות כא, כד) עין תחת עין אמר רחמנא אימא עין ממש לא סלקא דעתך דתניא יכול סימא את עינו מסמא את עינו קטע את ידו מקטע את ידו שיבר את רגלו משבר את רגלו ת\"ל (ויקרא כד, כא) מכה אדם ומכה בהמה מה מכה בהמה לתשלומין אף מכה אדם לתשלומין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(My translation with help from steinzaltz): Why (does it say) “An eye for an eye”? The Torah would tell you: maybe it means it literally? You wouldn’t (shouldn’t) think that, for we learned in a b’raita “(We would think) that for blinding someone, he is liable to be blinded, for breaking his arm, he is liable to have his arm broken, for breaking his leg, he is liable to have his leg broken, so the Torah tells us ״מכה אדם ומכה בהמה״ (“One who hits a person or an animal): just like one who hits an animal gets fined, so too one who hits a person gets fined.\nRashi on the verse “an eye for an eye”(sh’mos 21:24) brings this gemara as proof that he was fined:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עין תחת עין. סִמֵּא עֵין חֲבֵרוֹ נוֹתֵן לוֹ דְּמֵי עֵינוֹ כַּמָּה שֶׁפָּחֲתוּ דָּמָיו לִמְכֹּר בַּשּׁוּק, וְכֵן כֻּלָּם; וְלֹא נְטִילַת אֵבֶר מַמָּשׁ, כְּמוֹ שֶׁדָּרְשׁוּ רַבּוֹתֵינוּ בְּפֶרֶק הַחוֹבֵל (בבא קמא דף פ\"ג):\n  “An eye for an eye”- One who blinded his friend, pays him the difference of his worth on the marketplace, the same in the other cases; but not taking the organ itself, like our teachers taught in the Gemara (Bava Kama 83).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are many other instances in the Gemara where this is said, and many other commentators on this verse that say the same thing, but I think one example of each is sufficient.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on Rashi <em>ad. loc.</em>, there is a debate whether נפש תחת נפש, \"life for life\" in that verse is to be taken literally, and the assailant/murderer is liable for capital punishment, or if that phrase, too, is figurative, like the phrases in v. 24-25, and the defendant merely liable for monetary compensation.  If the latter, the defendant pays the full (market) value of the woman (as if she were to be sold as a slave) to the woman's heirs (the husband, generally).  This would be similar to a modern day wrongful death suit. The debate hinges on the question of whether one who aims to kill one person but ends up killing someone else is classified as a capital murderer (and liable to be executed) or not. (See <em>Mishna Sanhedrin</em> 9:2; 79a)</p>\n\n<p>The other clauses (in verses 24 and 25) are universally understood to mean monetary compensation, paid to the injured party, not to the government.  (You expressed uncertainty on this point.)  The other answers here, as well as other questions and answers on this site, speak to that discussion.

But also another example: There is a good knife in one drawer that is in a public kitchen. It is not closed and after I take and use it, I return it in the next morning after washing/cleaning it into its respective drawer.</p>\n\n<p>Living in my current environment it is bound to happen that some things just lay around 'for free'. Am I free to take these things (and maybe, once they served their use e.g books, recyclable items) and offer them for free back again?</p>\n\n<p>What does Chazal say about this.

The Mishna clearly held no independent standing in the eyes of Rashi as in his commentary he would not flesh out the concepts presented in the Mishna, but rather said “it is explained in the Gemara,” (\"בגמרא מפרש\"); in other words, the concepts and complexities in the Mishna will be addressed in the Gemara, and thus the reader should just look ahead to the Gemara’s discussion to answer his questions. Throughout the era of the Geonim, those commentaries that were written on Mishna were limited in scope and purpose focusing almost exclusively with material with respect to which no Talmud Bavli was written. </p>\n\n<p>Then came the famous commentary of the Rambam on the Mishna. In that era, Mishna study was not a normal independent pursuit and Mishna commentary not typical.  So what motivated the Rambam in this regard?  In his introduction, although he does not expressly state his motivation for writing the commentary, he does address four benefits that he believes the work will serve:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האחת שאנו מלמדים פירוש המשנה על נכון ובאור מליה שאילו שאלת לגדול\n  שבגאונים בעד פירוש הלכה מן המשנה לא יכול לומר בה דבר אלא אם ידע על פה\n  תלמוד ההלכה ההיא או יאמר לך אראה מה שיש בה מן הדברים בתלמוד ואין\n  ביכולת אדם לדעת על פה כל התלמוד וכל שכן בהיות הלכה אחת מן המשנה מפורשת\n  בארבעה עלים וחמשה כי יבא דבר על דבר וטענות וקושיות ותשובות עד שלא ידע\n  לבחור הברור מפירוש המשנה ההיא אלא אדם בקי בעיון.</p>\n  \n  <p>(1) The one is that we teach the correct explanation of the Mishnah\n  and the meaning of its words. As if you were to ask the greatest of\n  the Geonim about the explanation of a law of the Mishnah, he would not\n  be able to tell you anything unless the knew the Talmud of that law by\n  heart; or he would say to you, \"I will see that which is [written]\n  about it in the words of the Talmud.\" As it is not possible for a man\n  – unless he is an expert in reseach – to know all of the Talmud by\n  heart; and all the more so in that one law of the Mishnah is explained\n  in four or five pages – since one matter leads to another and [to]\n  arguments and objections and rebuttals – to the point that he will not\n  know [how] to choose the concise [conclusion] from the [Talmud's]\n  explanation of the Mishnah.</p>\n  \n  <p>והנה מה יעשה בהלכה אחת כי לא ישלם פירושה ופסקי הדין בה אלא משתי\n  המסכתות או שלשה.</p>\n  \n  <p>And behold, what will he do about a law the explanation and legal\n  decision of which is only completed in two or three tractates?</p>\n  \n  <p>והתועלת השנית הם הפסקים שאומר לך בפירוש כל הלכה על דעת מי נפסקה ההלכה.</p>\n  \n  <p>(2) And the second purpose is the decisions, since I will tell you in the\n  explanation of each law, according to [which of the various opinions]\n  is the law.</p>\n  \n  <p>והתועלת השלישי להיות כמבוא לכל המתחיל בעיון החכמה ויקבץ לו ממנו דרך\n  בדיקת הדבור וביאורו ויהיה אז כמי שכלל בדעתו כל התלמוד ויהיה לו לעזר\n  גדול בכל התלמוד.</p>\n  \n  <p>(3) And the third goal is to be like an introduction to anyone who is a\n  beginner to the research of wisdom. And he can gather from it a path\n  to check speech and its clarification, and he will then be like one\n  who encompasses all of the Talmud in his mind. And it will be a great\n  assistance to him in all of the Talmud.</p>\n  \n  <p>והתועלת הרביעית שיהיה למזכרת למי שיקרא וידע ויהיה כל מה שקרא נצב בין\n  עיניו תמיד ותהיה משנתו ותלמודו סדורה על פיו.</p>\n  \n  <p>(4) And the fourth goal is that it be a mnemonic for the one who [studied]\n  and knew [the Talmud, such that] all that he read will always be\n  present in front of his eyes, and his [knowledge of] Mishnah and\n  Talmud will be arranged in his mouth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Rambam in a way answers your question:  <strong><em>\"why is the Mishna a separate subject of study?\"</em></strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Also, in his commentary to Mikvaot, the Rambam cites a debate among certain commentators as to whether a specific kind of mikva is kosher and wrote about how they were needlessly debating a matter that could be found explicitly addressed in the Mishna and notes that what caused this in his view was the neglect of Mishna study.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 5:21</a> states how the study of Mishnah should proceed the study of Talmud:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוּא הָיָה אוֹמֵר, בֶּן חָמֵשׁ שָׁנִים לַמִּקְרָא, בֶּן עֶשֶׂר לַמִּשְׁנָה, בֶּן שְׁלשׁ עֶשְׂרֵה לַמִּצְוֹת, בֶּן חֲמֵשׁ עֶשְׂרֵה לַתַּלְמוּד</p>\n<p>[R' Yehuda Ben Teima] used to say: At five years of age the study of Scripture; At ten the study of Mishnah; At thirteen subject to the commandments; At fifteen the study of Talmud</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this statement was said in the context of children, it can also be applied to adults- for example if a person began to study Torah for the first time no one would prescribe said person to jump headfirst into the complexities of the Talmud. Instead, mishnah learning would be a much better start.</p>\n<p>Even if one is a seasoned & experienced learner, learning <em>mishnayos</em> can help a person get a good background for a new Masechta he's about to learn or to even serve as \"cliffnotes\" ie by learning mishnah it will refresh his memory re: the accompanying gemara.</p>\n<p>Lastly, 26 Masechtot in Shas Bavli <strong>ONLY</strong> have <em>mishnayot</em> so one would miss out on a large portion of precious halachos and Torah study if they didn't learn  <em>mishnayot</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You might as well have asked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are books and courses on studying the Mishna. Just the Mishna. Why would anyone want to study the Mishna by itself, without studying the commentary of R. Ovadya of Bartinura (\"Rav\") at the same time? Practically speaking, when you study the Mishna, don't you also study the Rav on the side, to understand the Mishna? It's called studying Rav. So why is the Mishna a separate subject of study?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Talmud is an explanation of the Mishna but it's far from the only one. And I don't know many people who learn a Mishna with <em>no</em> commentary: certainly it's not widely considered acceptable, at least not in my experience.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n\n<p><sub>[1] Of course, after someone has learned it with commentary, he can review it without reading the commentary if he remembers it by heart.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

Shall we pray for [the removal] of both? That is not possible. [We do not pray for two things at a time.]  Let us then pray for [the removal of] the plague and we will endure the famine.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Thereupon Rabbi Shmuel bar Nahmani said to them: “Let us rather pray [for the removal of] the famine, because when the All-Merciful gives plenty, He gives it for the living, [not for the dead,] as it is said [in the Book of Psalms]: “You open Your hand and give to each living thing according to his need”.” [Ps. 145:16] </p>\n  \n  <p>How how do we know that we do not pray for two things [at the same time]?</p>\n  \n  <p>Because it is written [in Ezra]: \n  So we fasted and petitioned our God concerning “this” [in the singular]. [Ezra 8:23] \n  This indicates that there were other things for which they could have prayed [but didn’t].</p>\n  \n  <p>In the Land of Israel, it was reported in the name of Rabbi Haggai that it could [also] be deduced from this verse [in Daniel]: \n  … Implore the God of Heaven for help concerning “this” mystery [in the singular]. [Dan. 2:18]\n  This implies that there were other things for which they could have prayed [but didn’t].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this halacha or a suggestion?  We pray for many things at the same time all the time. The daily Amidah has 13 petitionary prayers.

Assuming the Niddah flow itself lasts less than a week (which  is almost always the case according to WebMD), there are at least 3-5 days unaccounted for. </p>\n\n<p>My current thought is that in those days a woman is not assumed Tahor, and her flow does not make her a Zavah, but I'm not sure.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First, the seven days after the flow stops are midirabannan - a rabbinic enactment - and they are part of the Eleven days of Zivah.</p>\n\n<p>The d'oraysah cycle is 7 days niddah, regardless of how long the flow actually lasts, and then eleven days within which if she sees blood it is considered zivah. After the eleven days if there is any flow that will be considered that her monthly flow came early, and that will reset the cycle.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Intercourse.6.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Issurei Biah 6</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's a good question, but the \"7 clean days\" isn't part of the laws of Niddah. See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.15.19?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">appropriate sections in the Torah in Parshas Metzora</a>: 7 clean days is for Zivah, when she has a flow <em>outside</em> her regular cycle. Normally for Niddah she would just complete 7 days from when she started.<br />\n[To complicate matters, though, you're right: the custom since the time of the gemara is to treat every Niddah as a Zavah and keep 7 clean days from when she <em>stopped</em>. But that is going to distract from your question.]<br />\nAfter the 7 days of Niddah, <em>including</em> the time she saw, there are 11 days of zivah which are assumed to be outside her cycle. After that her cycle restarts and she could become a Niddah again. So that's only a total of 18 days!<br />\n<em>However</em>, your question contains a mistake. There is no guarantee that her cycle lasts exactly a month; each woman is different. If her regular cycle is 20 or 25 or 35 days, she might regularly see after that time.<br />\nAccording to the way we hold, that doesn't matter here: She can become a Niddah any time after those earlier 7+11=18 days are over and her 7 day period continues from the day she sees, followed by 11 again.<br />\nThe Rambam has a different system, see the source that simyou brought, but see the mefarshim on it for our system brought here.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why measure the side of the square by quartering its circumference\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Oholot.12.6?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohaloth 12:6</a> informs us that you need a Tefach of width to bring Tumah from one location to another:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קוֹרָה שֶׁהִיא נְתוּנָה מִכֹּתֶל לְכֹתֶל וְטֻמְאָה תַחְתֶּיהָ, אִם יֶשׁ בָּהּ פּוֹתֵחַ טֶפַח, מְבִיאָה אֶת הַטֻּמְאָה תַחַת כֻּלָּהּ. וְאִם לָאו, טֻמְאָה בוֹקַעַת וְעוֹלָה, בּוֹקַעַת וְיוֹרָדֶת. כַּמָּה יִהְיֶה בְהֶקֵּפָהּ וִיהֵא בָהּ פּוֹתֵחַ טֶפַח. בִּזְמַן שֶׁהִיא עֲגֻלָּה, הֶקֵּפָהּ שְׁלשָׁה טְפָחִים. בִּזְמַן שֶׁהִיא מְרֻבַּעַת, אַרְבָּעָה, שֶׁהַמְרֻבָּע יָתֵר עַל הֶעָגוֹל רְבִיעַ:‏</p>\n<p>[With regard to] a beam which is placed across from one wall to another and which has uncleanness beneath it: If it is one handbreadth wide, it conveys uncleanness to everything beneath it; If it is not [one handbreadth wide], the uncleanness cleaves upwards and downwards. How much must its circumference be so that its width should be one handbreadth? If it is round, its circumference must be three handbreadths; If square, four handbreadths, since a square has a [circumference] one quarter greater than [that of] a circle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Firstly, regarding the circle, as we all know, if the circumference is only 3 tefachim then we are missing about 3mm from the required Tefach.</p>\n<p>But more peculiar is the \"divide the circumference of the square by 4\". It seems one could simply measure any one side.</p>\n<p>However, even that isn't accurate, for if the square beam isn't sitting perfect horizontal - like this: ■ - but is (in the extreme case) sitting tilted - like this: ♦ - then the \"divide the circumference by 4\" is totally wrong! We now have 1.41 Tefachim. A circumference of 2.84 Tefachim would be sufficient to get us a 1 Tefach for the Tumah to travel underneath.</p>\n<p>So: <strong>Why is the Mishna assuming the beam is sitting \"square\" (like this: ■) and why do the meforshim all seem perplexed by the unnecessary mathematics, but none of them seem to notice that we have a real question if the beam is sitting like this: ♦</strong> ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Firstly, regarding the circle, as we all know, if the circumference is only 3 tefachim then we are missing about 3mm from the required Tefach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no idea where you get 3mm from. It's closer to five times that, because, assuming a tefach is 4in=10.16cm, the diameter is 10.16/π≈3.23cm, or ~16mm smaller than 10.16/3≈3.39cm. (Rav Moshe's 9cm tefach puts this at 9/π≈2.86cm, or ~14mm smaller than 9/3=3cm.)</p>\n\n<p>So, if anything, the Mishnah is <em>overestimating</em> in this case. Nevertheless, this rule is applied in other cases to be more lenient, a problem which the Gemara already deals in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.14a.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 14a</a> and a topic I've addressed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/76195/\">previously on this site</a>. The Mishnah there (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.13b.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13b</a>) says similarly that a beam with a circumference of three tefachim is wide enough to qualify as a Koreh to permit carrying in an alleyway, even though it ordinarily needs a full tefach of width. To that the Gemara asks for a source. According to the Tosfos HaRosh on the spot, the Gemara is asking how we know that we can assume π=3 halachically, even though that equality is false; according to the Aruch HaShulchan (OC 363:22, YD 30:13), it's asking how we know such a beam is permissible, even though we don't have a full tefach of width. According to either interpretation, the Gemara is directly addressing how we know such a beam is fine even though it doesn't actually measure up.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But more peculiar is the \"divide the circumference of the square by 4\". It seems one could simply measure any one side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, in practice you probably could. But the Mishnah seems to want to make the point that \"A square has a [perimeter] one quarter greater than [that of] a circle,\" which has halachic ramifications elsewhere (ex. Sukkah 8a, Eruvin 76a). Similarly, the Mishnah I cited above in Eruvin doesn't need to discuss the case of a circular beam, as any novelties contained therein are addressed by the previous cases of the Mishnah. According to the Gemara, the case is only discussed just so the Tanna has an excuse to mention that a circle has thrice its diameter in its circumference.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now for the main part of your question.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have any sources on this, but it seems reasonable to assume one of the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Mishnah is dealing with a flat square because of the case at hand: it's being rested on a tent on either end, which is simplest construed as lying flat on either end.</li>\n<li>The Mishnah is dealing with the minimum case, that is to say that the square gives the minimum shadow beneath it; this occurs when the square is lying flat, as its diagonal will always be longer than its sides.</li>\n<li>The Mishnah wants to make sure that the beam indeed has a shadow of a tefach, as while it looks square, it might actually be rectangular, rhombic, or parallelogrammatic. By measuring the perimeter and dividing by four, it would ensure that, regardless of the case, it will have a bottom side measuring at least a tefach.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the fact that the Mishnah doesn't even present the rule which allows one to generalize to rotated squares – i.e. that any square with a side of 1 has a diagonal of 1.4 – that seems to eliminate the second theory.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there ever a Torah obligation to divorce one's wife?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many cases throughout the Mishnayos and Gemarra of women who one is obligated to divorce. I believe all of them are Rabbinic. I'm wondering if there's ever a case where the Torah would obligate a person to divorce their wife. While it may be a <em>mitzvah</em> according to some to divorce one's wife with a <em>get</em>, the simplest explanation of that is that it's the avenue the Torah wants a person to use when they want to end their marriage. Not that they <strong>must</strong> divorce their wife.</p>\n\n<p>A potential answer is cases of forbidden marriages, such as a Yisroel to a <em>Mamzer</em>, or a Kohen to a <em>Zonah</em>. I believe marital intimacy in these cases is forbidden, and maybe potentially <strong>getting married</strong>. However, let's say they are <strong>already</strong> married, and live apart, and neither of them have an interest or requirement to get remarried. Can they stay in this state? Is this an example where there's a Torah obligation to get divorced?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Under some circumstances, if she wants a divorce he'd have to give it, from general bein adam lachaveiro considerations.

The verse describes גיבורי כוח, the mighty ones of strength, who follow Hashem’s word. Who does this refer to? The <em>Midrash</em> says that it refers to those who observe the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>shemittah</em>. Why are these people called mighty ones of strength? If someone one day gave <em>tzedakah</em> <sup>3</sup>, it would be commendable, but not overly impressive. If they gave it every day for a week, that would be more impressive. If they gave <em>tzedakah</em> every day for a month, that would be even more impressive. Who would expect anyone to give <em>tzedakah</em> every day for an entire year? That would be tremendously difficult. For sure someone who observes <em>shemittah</em> for an entire year, seeing their land remain undeveloped, and their fruits taken by strangers, and keeps silent, is superhuman <sup>4</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Our Sages are teaching us that the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>shemittah</em> is incredibly difficult, and requires an enormous amount of strength of character. If so, how could it be that Hashem would expect this from us? Hashem never gives someone a test they cannot succeed in <sup>5</sup>, but this <em>mitzvah</em> seems to be too much. Therefore, it must be that Hashem determined that this <em>mitzvah</em> <em>is</em> something that the Jews can handle, just like any other <em>mitzvah</em>. We are taught that Hashem investigated (so to speak) and determined that there was no nation fit to accept the Torah except the Jewish people <sup>6</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Besides being inherently fit to receive the Torah and fulfill its <em>mitzvos</em>, we see that Hashem prepared the Jews for this purpose by bringing them to Mount Sinai. The primordial snake infected Eve with some sort of contamination <sup>7</sup>. This implanted in Mankind a sort of predisposition against the Torah and its <em>mitzvos</em>. When Hashem brought the Jews to Mount Sinai, this contamination was removed. Unlike the non-Jews, who didn’t have this experience, this process elevated and sanctified the Jewish people <sup>8</sup> to make them more receptive towards the holiness of the Torah <sup>9</sup>. So much so that they were able to precede “We will do” before “We will listen” <sup>10</sup>. Most people are not on such a level to be able to have such trust in Hashem to commit themselves to listen to whatever He says, before He even said it. The Sinai experience paved the way for such a possibility <sup>11</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Because the Jewish people were elevated to such a high and lofty level at Mount Sinai, from that point on <sup>12</sup> they didn’t have such a difficulty with the <em>mitzvah </em>of <em>shemittah</em>. To be able to abandon their land for an entire year wasn’t as large a burden. Even though to everyone else, it would appear to be an impossible <em>mitzvah</em> to keep. For this reason, the Torah emphasized that the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>shemittah</em> was given at Mount Sinai. The very fact that the Jews were brought to Mount Sinai is the reason they are able to keep the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>shemittah</em>, something no other nation could withstand.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <b>Vayikra Rabbah</b> 1:1; <b>Midrash Tanchuma</b> <em>Vayikra</em> § 1; <b>Tanchuma </b><b>Yashan</b> <em>Vayikra</em> § 1. <b>Eitz Yosef</b> to <b>Midrash Tanchuma </b>understands that <b>Zohar</b> I p. 90a also possibly understands the verse this way</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <b>Psalms</b> 103:20-21</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> <b>Eitz Yosef</b> to <b>Vayikra Rabbah</b> <em>loc. cit.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> ואיזהו גיבור הכובש את יצרו (<b>Avos</b> 4:1)</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> <b>Avodah Zara</b> 3a</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> <b>Vayikra Rabbah</b> 13:2</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> <b>Shabbos</b> 146a</p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> <b>Rashi</b> <em>ad. loc.</em> <em>s.v. </em>מזלייהו</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> This explains why we mention in the <em>Haggadah</em> in the song <em>Dayeinu</em> that it would have been enough if Hashem just brought us to Mount Sinai, even if he didn’t give us the Torah. This is pointed out by the <b>Abudraham</b> and <b>Kol Bo</b>’s commentary on the <em>Haggadah</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> <b>Exodus</b> 24:7</p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup> <b>Siach Yitzchak</b>’s commentary to the <em>Haggadah </em>(by <b>Rav Yitzchak Meltzan</b>)</p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup> Even though we are taught that the contamination of the primordial snake returned when the Jews sinned with the Golden Calf (<b>Nefesh HaChaim</b> 1:6), one explanation is that it returned with a much lower potency. See <b>Ohr Yechezkel</b> <em>Torah VeDa’as</em> for a discussion on this topic. The <b>Be’er Yosef</b> doesn’t discuss this, but he does see from the <em>gemarra</em> in <b>Shabbos</b> <em>loc. cit.</em> that the effects of Mount Sinai are still present. He also brings <b>Nedarim</b> 20a and <b>Yerushalmi Kiddushin</b> 4:1 as a proof. See there. See also <b>UBacharta BaChaim</b> <em>ad. loc.</em> § 22</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ramban here answers that Shemittah was used as an example since it was stated briefly/generally at the time of Matan Torah (in Mishpatim), and the details were said later. This example shows us that all Mitzvos which were only mentioned backhandedly (or not at all) at that time in the Torah, but were explained later on, were really all explained in detail at Sinai. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422609699.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleinu LeShabeiach</a>, based on the teachings of Rav Zilberstein, quotes two answers to this question (p. 394-395):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Chasam Sofer explains that the reason <em>shemittah</em> and Mount Sinai are juxtaposed is because <em>shemittah</em> is a clear proof that the Torah was given by Hashem, and not fabricated by Moshe Rabbeinu, <em>chas v’shalom</em>. For what human being would dare to make the promise that <em>I will ordain My blessing for you in the sixth year and it will yield a crop sufficient for the three-year period</em> (25:21)? Only Hashem, Who is omnipotent, can guarantee such a thing. <em>Shemittah</em> therefore serves as a proof of the revelation at Sinai. [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>The Imrei Shefer offers another explanation of the connection between <em>shemittah</em> and Mount Sinai. <em>Shemittah</em>, he says, is called Shabbos, for just as Shabbos is the source of blessing for the other six days of the week, <em>shemittah</em> is the source of blessing for the other six years of the <em>shemittah</em> cycle. If a person allows his fields to lie fallow during <em>shemittah</em>, that is what will bring him success during the years when he does work the land. </p>\n  \n  <p>Mount Sinai itself serves as an embodiment of this concept. When Hashem came to give the Torah; all of the mountains presented their credentials, as it were, in the hopes that the Torah would be given on them. Mount Sinai, however, was modest and reticent, standing at the side and not touting its own qualifications for having the Torah given upon it. That was why Mount Sinai merited to become greater than all of the other mountains. </p>\n  \n  <p>This is the connection between <em>shemittah</em> and Mount Sinai; just as Mount Sinai’s inactivity was what led to its eventual distinction, our inactivity during <em>shemittah</em> is what leads to our receiving Hashem’s blessing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How could anybody confuse moonlight and sunlight?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>mishna</em> in Yoma 3:1 talks about watching for dawn to know if it's time for the morning offering, and then <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.3.2?lang=bi&with=Yoma&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 3:2</a> asks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלָמָה הֻצְרְכוּ לְכָךְ, שֶׁפַּעַם אַחַת עָלָה מְאוֹר הַלְּבָנָה וְדִמּוּ שֶׁהֵאִיר מִזְרָח, וְשָׁחֲטוּ אֶת הַתָּמִיד,</p>\n<p>And why was all that necessary? Because once the light of the moon rose and they thought that the east was lit up and slaughtered the continual offering, [and afterwards] they had to take it out to the place of burning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How could anybody confuse moonlight for sunlight?  I've been out in the countryside far from city lights under a bright full moon, and it's nothing like sunlight.  (And the moon in this case wouldn't even be full yet.)</p>\n<p>The <em>g'mara</em> reports that the school of R' Yishmael taught that it was a cloudy day and light scattered in all directions.  I don't buy it; moonlight diffused through heavy clouds looks different from sunlight so diffused.</p>\n<p>There's an additional problem: on a full moon, moonrise is the same time as sunset.  Moonrise advances about an hour, give or take, per day, so if you count a few days back from the full moon for 10 Tishrei, the moon is rising in the east in mid-afternoon, which is nowhen near the time of the morning offering.  By the time it's dark enough to see moonlight, the moon isn't in the eastern sky.  Perhaps the <em>mishna</em> meant that they saw the <em>setting</em> moon, except it says \"east\" and the moon sets in the west.</p>\n<p>What confusing lighting conditions is the <em>mishna</em> referring to?  According to R' Yishmael, how would a cloudy day contribute to this error?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>When I'm sick during the winter (happens a lot unfortunately), I daven vasikin at home.  I use the myzmanim + cell phone clock method, but also have a window nearby with the shades open.  I've noticed that there's a substantial variation in the amount of light at sunrise, depending on the weather.  If it's cloudy, it can be pretty dark outside, even when the clock tells me it's actually sunrise.</p>\n\n<p>For the tamid, they weren't looking for sunrise - they were looking for alos, when the amount of light is tiny.  I haven't done the exercise of looking out the window at alos, but when it's cloudy, I can easily imagine that the minimal amount of light needed is reduced even further and you can mistake the moon for it.  The comments on the question, quoting Bartenura and others, are right though that this can't happen on Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n<p>Now is probably not the best time to experiment.  Alos is way too early in the summer, at least for me.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The simple answer is that the entire discussion about <em>the moon appearing like the sun</em> is not literal. It is simply <strong>a teaching aid</strong>, and <strong>a model</strong> that is referenced in another area of the Torah.</p>\n<p>That if this idea of using allegorical models and paradigms is confusing, think about how chemistry is taught in school. Complex discussions of molecular structure, for example, are often presented through the use of simplified physical models that can be understood by everyone.</p>\n<p>The simplified models presented in the five books of Moshe are even known to a child of five years old like is said by Yehuda ben Teima in Avot 5:21. And one of the requirements of learning Mishnah is proper comprehension and understanding.</p>\n<p>This idea, that this particular detail is allegorical, is emphasized by the commentaries to the very Mishnah you link to, for example the Bartenura who says in regard to the phrase <em>”one time the luminary called the Moon (הלבנה) rose etc.</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לאו ביוה״כ קאמר, דא״א לעלות מאור הלבנה סמוך לשחר ביוה״כ שהוא בשליש החודש</p>\n<p>This isn’t speaking about Yom HaKippurim. That it is impossible for the luminary called HaLevanah* to rise close to morning on Yom HaKippurim, which is in the first third of the month. Rather, in the final third of the month is when the moon rises close to dawn. And this event is an error (<em>See Mishnah Brachot 2:3</em>) and causes us to apprehend (<em>meaning to grasp with understanding</em>), lest in regard to Yom HaKippurim, other errors will occur. We are required to act in a similar fashion in regard to everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the points brought out in Brachot 2:3 is that when you see an error, go back to the beginning. In context, look to the source within the Torah for the <em>Avodah of Teshuvah</em>, which appears in parshat Bereshit as cited below.</p>\n<p>That it (this reference to the moon being confused with sun) is not speaking about Yom HaKippurim. That <em>it is impossible</em> for the light of the (full) moon to appear at Yom HaKippurim which is in the first third of the month...</p>\n<p>And also as Rambam emphasizes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ידוע כי הלבנה אינה עולה מן המזרח אלא אחר חצות החדש.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it is known that the moon doesn't ascend from the east unless it is after half of the month... (<em>and Yom HaKippurim is always on the 10th of Tishrei in the first 1/3 of the month</em>)</p>\n<p>And in the context of the first chapter of Mishnah Yoma which begins this discussion and also references the first 7 days (before Yom HaKippurim) and the subject of husband and wife (all of which alludes to the allegorical reference model, namely the seven days of creation and the creation of Adam, the husband, and the wife, Chava), it points to the Torah source which is the paradigm from which these laws are based.</p>\n<p>And this is also asked in the commentary of Yachin to the Mishnah you reference which questions why it was necessary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לעלות לגג לראות, ולא הסתפקו בראי' פשוטה למזרח</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To ascend to the roof (<em>another allusion to this spiritual/Heavenly/Angelic paradigm from the 7 days of creation</em>, meaning the 6 days of building [that roof, גג which is gematria 6] and Shabbat Kodesh. Like is brought in Talmud, the 6000 years of this world are based upon the paradigm established in the 6 <em>Days of Building</em>, building בנין which is also the language used in the formation of Chava, Adam’s wife.). Wouldn't it be sufficient to glance to the east <em>like the simple meaning</em> of the words? But Yachin states that it is necessary to understand the concept properly.</p>\n<p>That after the creation of Adam HaRishon, he was separated into two individuals, the husband, Adam, who would be the <em>Mashpia</em>, and Chava, the wife, who would be the <em>Mekabel</em>.</p>\n<p>And this process was based upon the earlier paradigm which G-d established in regard to the appearance of the single light on the first day of creation and then the subsequent creation of the two <em><strong>(equal)</strong></em> great sources of that single light within the creation itself, like is stated in Bereshit 1:14-16.</p>\n<p>(That this follows the general Torah concept that there are three partners in a Jewish marriage, husband, wife and G-d [who hovers over the marriage bed] like is implied from the words איש and אשה which are formed from two equal parts of fire or light (אש) and G-d (יה) who unites them to be a manifestation of oneness (<em>one flesh</em>).</p>\n<p>And Torah emphasizes in midrash to Bereshit 1:14-16 that as a consequence of the insistence of the moon, meaning that the moon said in order to proclaim G-d's oneness as King <em>(to avoid the confusion that there might be two G-ds, two Kings)</em> requires that one of us must be reduced in stature (temporarily) and serve as a Mekabel, G-d reduced the Moon. And that <em>appearance</em>, that the sun and moon look obviously different, is what is seen during the entire period of exile.</p>\n<p>But the Torah teaches that ultimately, when we have returned to G-d in teshuvah, <em>another reference to the concept of Yom HaKippurim</em>, meaning during the final redemption, the moon will return to its true, original state, like is said in the <em><strong>Santification of the Moon</strong></em> prayer.</p>\n<p>And it is in that context, meaning in the context of the ultimate point of Yom HaKippurim (that all Israel will return to their Father in Heaven, and the reduced appearance/condition of the moon will be returned to its fullness) that the appearance of the moon could be confused with the appearance of the sun.</p>\n\n\n",

And the world was desolate of Torah until Rabbi Akiva came to our Rabbis in the South and taught his Torah to them.

After a\n  while, Aḥer said to him: Meir, turn back, for I have already estimated\n  and measured according to the steps of my horse that the Shabbat\n  boundary ends here, and you may therefore venture no further. Rabbi\n  Meir said to him: You, too, return to the correct path. He said to\n  him: But have I not already told you that I have already heard behind\n  the dividing curtain: “Return, rebellious children,” <strong>apart from Aḥer</strong>?</p>\n  \n  <p><em>(Sefaria)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm focused on the text \"חוץ מאחר\" (\"apart from Aher\").  In the Talmud Yerushalmi there is a similar story but the wording is slightly different. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל דייך מאיר עד כאן תחום שבת א\"ל מן הן את ידע א\"ל מן טלפי דסוסיי\n  דהוינא מני והולך אלפיים אמה א\"ל וכל הדא חכמתא אית ביך ולית את חזר בך\n  א\"ל לית אנא יכיל א\"ל למה א\"ל שפעם אחת הייתי עובר לפני בית קודש הקדשים\n  רכוב על סוסי ביה\"כ שחל להיות בשבת ושמעתי בת קול יצאה מבית קודש הקדשים\n  ואומרת <strong>שובו בנים חוץ מאלישע בן אבויה</strong> שידע כחי ומרד בי (Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rather than saying \"except for Aher\" it says \"except for Elisha ben Abuya\".  Is there any significance here between the voice using his actual name in Talmud Yerushalmi versus using the term \"Aher\" in Talmud Bavli?</p>\n\n<p>Also, how do we reconcile the voice saying that Aher or Elisha ben Abuya (depending on which account you are reading) cannot repent.  The Rambam says in the Mishneh Torah, Teshuva 3 that someone who denied Hashem his entire life can repent before his last breath and have a share in the World to Come:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בַּמֶּה דְּבָרִים אֲמוּרִים שֶׁכָּל אֶחָד מֵאֵלּוּ אֵין לוֹ חֵלֶק\n  לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא כְּשֶׁמֵּת בְּלֹא תְּשׁוּבָה אֲבָל אִם שָׁב מֵרִשְׁעוֹ\n  וּמֵת וְהוּא בַּעַל תְּשׁוּבָה הֲרֵי זֶה מִבְּנֵי הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא\n  שֶׁאֵין לְךָ דָּבָר שֶׁעוֹמֵד בִּפְנֵי הַתְּשׁוּבָה. אֲפִלּוּ כָּפַר\n  בָּעִקָּר כָּל יָמָיו וּבָאַחֲרוֹנָה שָׁב יֵשׁ לוֹ חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם\n  הַבָּא שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ישעיה נז יט) \"שָׁלוֹם שָׁלוֹם לָרָחוֹק וְלַקָּרוֹב\n  אָמַר ה' וּרְפָאתִיו\". כָּל הָרְשָׁעִים וְהַמּוּמָרִים וְכַיּוֹצֵא\n  בָּהֶן שֶׁחָזְרוּ בִּתְשׁוּבָה בֵּין בְּגָלוּי בֵּין בְּמַטְמוֹנִיּוֹת\n  מְקַבְּלִין אוֹתָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ירמיה ג יד) \"שׁוּבוּ בָּנִים\n  שׁוֹבָבִים\". </p>\n  \n  <p>That is saying, that none of these will have a share in the World to\n  Come, if he dies without repentance; but if he repent from his\n  wickedness and died in a state of repentance, he is, indeed, of the\n  sons of the World to Come, as there is not a thing to stand in the way\n  of repentance. Even if one who denied the existence of God all of his\n  life but in the end repented, has a share in the World to Come, for it\n  is said: \"Peace, peace, to him that is far off, and to him that is\n  near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him\" (Is. 57.19). All of the\n  wicked, and apostates and their like who turned in repentance, whether\n  publicly or secretly, should be accepted back into the folds of\n  Israel, even as it is said: \"Return ye backsliding children\" (Jer.\n  3.22) (Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've tried to reconcile this and perhaps in Talmud Bavli the reference to Aher means something more significant (as he did not say \"Elisha ben Abuya\" could not repent, but rather the \"Aher\" or \"other\" could not repent; i.e., if he stops being an \"Aher\" then he can).  </p>\n\n<p>Are there any commentaries that discuss this or perspectives?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In sum:  1) Do any commentaries address the difference between Talmud Bavli and Yerushalmi as I described? 2) Do any commentaries address the idea that the Talmud seems to suggest that he cannot repent which runs contrary to the idea that all can repent? 3) Anywhere else in the Talmud or any other perspectives that anyone here thinks would be helpful in understanding this?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you! </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R.

He heard a voice from behind the partition, \"Repent wayward sons, except for <em>Acher</em>.\" <strong>No one else heard this voice; he essentially convinced himself that this was his situation.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, for R. Amital, of course Elisha b. Avuya could have repented, had he only believed in his ability to do so. It was not G-d that closed the gates of repentance in front of <em>Acher</em>; rather his own self-image as one who G-d would never take back prevented him from repenting.</p>\n\n<p><em>(A write-up of the sicha is available as shiur number 48 at <a href=\"http://etzion.gush.net/vbm/search_results.php?koteret=%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D&subject=%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D#8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this link</a>.)</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi YY Jacobson discusses this topic:  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zsO3KlZsnok\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/zsO3KlZsnok</a> </p>\n\n<p>A summary of what is noted in the video:  The Rav discussed in a lecture in Atlantic City, NJ in 1961 that we must focus on the difference between the Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud. </p>\n\n<p>The Babylonian Talmud states “expect for Aher”.  The Jerusalem Talmud states “except for Elisha ben Abuya”.  Each as you noted in your question.  The Rav in this lecture, according to this video, focused on the question of “what did the voice actually say”, did the Bas Kol reject “Aher” or “Elisha ben Abuya”.  Why this variation and what is its significance?  </p>\n\n<p>According to this video the Rav said that his interpretation/theory of the variation is that the Babylonian Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud are speaking about two different things — the voice that Elisha ben Abuya heard had said “Aher” as the Babylonian Talmud states, but Elisha ben Abuya thought he heard “Elisha ben Abuya” because he saw himself as an “Aher” and thus to him when he heard “Aher” it meant “Elisha ben Abuya” or was one in the same — and that is what the Jerusalem Talmud records.  </p>\n\n<p>Thus the Rav stated in this lecture, according to this video, that the tragedy of the story is that Elisha ben Abuya saw himself as an “Aher” rather than a “ben”.  He had a right to do teshuva... he just had to let go of the “Aher” and see himself as a “ben” (i.e., a part of the Jewish people) again. </p>\n\n<p>I’d watch the video to learn about this more in depth and how he came to this view. </p>\n\n\n",

Chukas): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכמאמרם ז\"ל (מס' שבת פ' חבית) ישראל שעמדו על הר סיני פסקה זוהמתן..... אך אחרי כן על ידי העגל חזרה הזוהמא למקומה\n  .....וזה מאמרם (שם במדרש) ז\"ל כי העגל טינף פלטין של מלך כי האדם הוא פלטין משכן מלכו של עולם כי היכל ה' הוא. ומה גם במ\"ת שעליהם השרה שכינתו יתברך וזה טינפו שהחזיר בו זוהמת נחש וטימא נפשו ויעכר גופו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I subsequently found that this statement is sourced in the Zohar I <em>parshas Chayei Sarah</em> p. 126b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי יוסי האי דאמרת בקדמיתא דכד נחש אתא על חוה אטיל בה זוהמא שפיר אבל הא תנינן דכד קאימו ישראל על טורא דסיני פסק מנייהו זוהמא, ישראל דקבילו אורייתא פסק מנייהו זוהמא אבל שאר עמין עעכו\"ם דלא קבילו אורייתא לא פסקא זוהמא מנייהו, א\"ל שפיר קאמרת אבל תא חזי אורייתא לא אתייהיבת אלא לדכורי דכתיב (דברים ד') וזאת התורה אשר שם משה לפני בני ישראל דהא נשי פטירין מפקודי אורייתא ועוד <strong>דאהדרו כלהו לזוהמתן כקדמיתא בתר דחטו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It just says that after the Jews sinned the contamination returned. It doesn't clarify which sin, but I guess the context makes it obvious that it's referring to the sin of the Golden Calf. This is how the Chida in his Nitzotzei Oros ad. loc. § 1 understood it, and how the Sulam ad. loc. explains it. The Chida also says this is discussed by the Zohar Chadash, but I'm not sure yet where.</p>\n<p>Thanks to @shmosel there's also explicit mention in Zohar I <em>parshas Bereishis</em> p. 52b and Zohar II <em>parshas Ki Sisa</em> p. 193b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ישראל בשעתא דקיימו ישראל על טורא דסיני אתעבר מנייהו זוהמא דהאי חיויא דהא כדין בטול יצר הוה מעלמא...\n<strong>כיון דחטאו בעגל</strong> אתעבר מנייהו כל אינון דרגין ונהורין עלאין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also found it in Zohar Chadash <em>Rus</em> p. 83b, although it doesn't seem to be the one the Chida is referencing.</p>\n<p>It's interesting to me that the editions of Nefesh HaChaim I saw don't cite this Zohar, even though they cite other Zohars he's referencing. I guess they didn't realize the source...</p>\n\n\n",

Can he bless for the Sefira at the middle, or perhaps, because he wasn't in duty to make the Mitsva at the beginning of the Sefira, his sefira cannot be for \"entire\" weeks \" and he cannot count with a Beracha. Or perhaps he began when he was a child with Beracha, he can continue because there is not lack of \"entire\" weeks. (<strong>the same question may be asked about a convert who converted at the middle of the count</strong>)</p>\n  \n  <p>מקור דין זה בגמרא (פסחים צ\"ג ע\"א), ומובא ברמב\"ם (פ\"ה מהל' קרבן פסח ה\"ז), וז\"ל:) \"גר שנתגייר בין פסח ראשון לפסח שני, וכן קטן שהגדיל בין שני פסחים, חייבין לעשות פסח שני, ואם שחטו עליו בראשון פטור\". </p>\n  \n  <p>The source to rule this law is in Gemara Pesachim 93a, this Gemara is ruled in Rambam Hilchot Korban Pesach chapter 5 Halacha 7. A convert who converted between. Pesach and Pesach Sheni, or a child who became adult between Pesach and Pesach Sheni, we should to bring for him a Korban Pesach Sheni. But If they already counted him for the Shechita of Pesach Rishon, there is no need to bring Pesach Sheni</p>\n  \n  <p>שואל על כך הכסף משנה, והרי קטן לאו בר חיובא כלל,‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The Kesef Mishne asks, why needs he a Pesach Sheni, at the time of Pesach Rishon he was not in duty to bring a Korban Pesach. </p>\n  \n  <p>ומתרץ בשם מהר\"י קורקוס שכיון שהתורה רבתה את הקטן וצירפה אותו לשחיטת קרבן פסח, הרי שיש לו זיקה לאותו החיוב.‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>The Mahari Korkos answers that since the Tora says that children too eat the Pesach, this is a proof that children are destinated to the duty. </p>\n  \n  <p>ומבואר בלחם משנה, שבקרבן פסח כתוב 'איש לפי אוכלו', מכאן שמחשבים כמה יאכל אדם גדול וכמה יאכל קטן, כל אדם לפי כמות הבשר שהוא צורך - הרי שהתורה חישבה גם את הקטן למרות שאינו בר חיובא.‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>The Lechem Mishne explains that regardind Korban Pesach the verse says that we need to calculate the number of persons nominated for an animal following the amount of meat that each of them eats, an adult person eats more than a child. This shows that the Tora says to calculate the amount of meat eaten by childs, despite that a child is not in duty to make the mitsva to eat Korban Pesach. </p>\n  \n  <p>ולפיכך בקרבן פסח שאני כי יש לימוד מיוחד, ואעפ\"כ יש מכאן ללמוד שמעשה קטן מועיל לענין תמימות, כי בלאו הכי י\"א שאין צורך בתמימות וכל לילה מצוה בפני עצמה.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>So for Pesach Sheni there is a specific learning. But despite then, we can learn from this rule that a new Bar Mitsva who began to count before the Bar Mitsva can continue to count with a Beracha, because we can add an other reason, the opinion that each day counting is an independent Mitsva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note, all the arguments cited in this answer seems to be not adapted for the convert, he is not destinated to be Jew by a natural way as the child is destinated to be adult. A non Jew cannot eat from the Korban Pesach. So apparently the only reason that remains is the opinion that each day count is an independent Mitsva. Tsarich Yun. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is grinder biohacking permissible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinder_(biohacking)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Grinder biohacking</a> involves implanting DIY cybernetics or chemicals into one’s own body which ostensibly give one superhuman abilities. For example, some companies sell implantable <a href=\"https://chip-implants.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NFC/RFID chips</a> to enable one to, I dunno, unlock a door, or use it as a bus pass or credit card. Some people <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/grinders-biohack-eyeballs-to-give-them-night-vision/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">biohacked their eyes</a> to give themselves night vision. <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/coolest-biohacking-implants/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This site</a> has some other, uh, <em>interesting</em> examples.</p>\n\n<p>As you might imagine, these kind of implants and chemicals pose a danger to those implanting them, as a grinder is intentionally wounding himself in order to implant these things, opening himself up to infection or worse.</p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this question, medical devices like pacemakers and cochlear implants are to be ignored. The difference is that medical devices are implanted by a trained medical professional for a medical need, while these devices lack at least the need and often lack the medical professional as well. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It’s my understanding that there is a dispute regarding <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67390/\">plastic surgery</a> when it’s not alleviating some form of pain, wherein Rav Moshe Feinstein and the Chelkas Yaakov held that it’s permissible, while Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and the Tzitz Eliezer held that it’s forbidden.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Would the same dispute apply here?</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps those who are lenient by plastic surgery would be stringent here. Did they give a blanket permission to wound oneself for a constructive purpose? Or is there something unique to plastic surgery which doesn’t apply to grinding (maybe different levels of constructiveness)?</li>\n<li>Perhaps those who are stringent by plastic surgery would be lenient here. Did they give a blanket prohibition against wounding oneself except for absolute necessities? Or, since there is a perceived practical benefit in this case, this would be more lenient than plastic surgery, which is merely cosmetic?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Obviously if there is a chance of death it would be strictly prohibited. Assume for the purposes of this question that it’s done in a way such that the chance of death is minimal. </p>\n\n<p><strong>As noted above, grinder biohacking is not sanctioned by the medical community and can cause serious health issues. Please talk with your doctor in addition to your rabbi before trying this at home.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Reuven and Shimon are married to Rachel and Leah, who are sisters, and Levi is married to Esther, who isn't related to them.  Reuven dies.  Levi does yibum with Rachel.  Leah dies, then Levi dies.  Rachel is forbidden to Shimon forever because she fell to him for yibum at one point and was forbidden to him then.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.3.7?p2=Rambam_on_Mishnah_Yevamot.3.7.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הטעם מפני שהיתה אחות אשתו ונפלה לפניו ליבום ואשתו קיימת וכבר נתבאר שהיא אסורה עולמית אבל צרתה ר\"ל נכרית לא מצינו בה דין בגמ' ולא דבר לאחד מן הגאונים והדין אצלי בה שהיא חולצת ולא מתייבמת לפי שאני מסופק אם אסורה משום ערוה ותהיה צרתה פטורה מן החליצה ומן הייבום או אסורה עליו מדרבנן שאמרו הואיל ונאסרה עליו שעה אחת נאסרה עליו עולמית והיא כמו שנייה וצרת שנייה או חולצת או מתייבמת ולפיכך תחלוץ להחמיר: ‏</p>\n<p>The reason Rachel is forbidden to Shimon is because she was his wife's sister and fell before him for yibum while Leah was alive, and we already explained that she's forbidden to him forever.  But regarding Esther, we haven't any discussion in the Gemara or Geonim.  My ruling is that she does chalitza and not yibum, because I'm not sure whether (a) Rachel is forbidden as an ervah and exempts her co-wife from chalitza and yibum, or whether (b) she's only forbidden miderabanan, because the <em>Rabbis</em> said \"because she was forbidden at one point we'll forbid her forever\", and in that case she's like a secondary ervah, whose co-wife does chalitza and not yibum.  Therefore she should be stringent and do chalitza.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yevamot.3.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:9</a> gives a similar but simpler case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁנֵי אַחִין נְשׂוּאִין לִשְׁתֵּי אֲחָיוֹת, וּמֵת אַחַד מֵהֶן, וְאַחַר כָּךְ מֵתָה אִשְׁתּוֹ שֶׁל שֵׁנִי, הֲרֵי זוֹ אֲסוּרָה עָלָיו עוֹלָמִית, הוֹאִיל וְנֶאֶסְרָה עָלָיו שָׁעָה אֶחָת: ‏</p>\n<p>Reuven and Shimon are married to Rachel and Leah [like before], Reuven dies, then Leah dies.

It's included to teach an additional chiddush: that in the case of that mishnah she's completely exempt.  Why doesn't the Rambam take the Gemara's statement that mishnah 9 is redundant as a proof for (a)?</p>\n<p>(He later changed his mind and rules like possibility (a) in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Levirate_Marriage_and_Release.7.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yibum Vachalitza 7:11</a>.  This might be the reason he changed his mind, but my question here is about the contradiction within the Peirush Hamishnayos.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Even if one understands mishnah 7 according to possibility b), mishnah 9 is still redundant. Ignoring the status of Esther, we learn the following from mishnah 7:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reuven dies, Rachel is forbidden to Shimon (her sister's husband) and instead marries Levi (via <em>yibbum</em>)</li>\n<li>Leah dies, Rachel remains married totally to Levi.</li>\n<li>Levi dies, Leah is forbidden to Shimon (even though he is no longer her sister's husband) because she was once forbidden to him. Since this is an <em>issur miderabbanan</em>, she (or her co-wife) will need <em>chalitzah</em> from Shimon to release her from the bond caused by her marriage to Shimon's brother, Levi.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now consider the case of mishnah 9, where there is no Levi. We would infer the following from the rules presented in mishnah 7:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reuven dies, Rachel is forbidden to Shimon (her sister's husband) and instead marries an unrelated man (call him David).</li>\n<li>Leah dies, Rachel remains married totally to David.</li>\n<li>David dies, Leah is forbidden to Shimon (even though he is no longer her sister's husband) because she was once forbidden to him. This is an <em>issur miderabbanan</em>. She can marry whomever else she wishes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nothing would change if, in this case, Rachel remained unmarried after the death of Reuven:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reuven dies, Rachel is forbidden to Shimon (her sister's husband) and instead can marry whomever she wishes, but has not yet re-married.</li>\n<li>Leah dies, Leah is forbidden to Shimon (even though he is no longer her sister's husband) because she was once forbidden to him. This is an <em>issur miderabbanan</em>. She can still marry whomever else she wishes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus all the information contained in mishnah 9 is already present in mishnah 7, which is why the Gemara (and Rambam) say that mishnah 9 is redundant.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Torah 'not in Heaven' and free choice\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The concept of “Torah lo b’shomayim hi” is usually taken to mean that the halacha is not decided (by G-d) in Heaven, but rather by people here on Earth. However, since nothing happens outside of G-d’s Will, whatever halacha was actually decided by people is clearly the halacha that G-d desired to be established. So, in fact, it <em>was</em> “b’shomayim”, and therefore there’s no such concept as “Torah lo b’shomayim hi” that could be possible.</p>\n\n<p>So what then is the import of the statement that halacha is decided by people down here on Earth? They are just enacting whatever G-d desired in the first place. You can’t say that they have free choice to decide otherwise, because free choice is given only in matters of deciding whether to observe [a certain law of] the Torah or not at a specific time (hakol byidei shamayim chutz meyirat shamayim) - while in this instance it is the establishment of what the law itself should be in the first place, and for all time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This paradox is addressed by Rambam in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=5&perek=5&halocha=4&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuvah 5:4</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואל תתמה ותאמר היאך יהיה האדם עושה כל מה שיחפוץ ויהיו מעשיו מסורים לו וכי יעשה בעולם דבר שלא ברשות קונו ולא חפצו והכתוב אומר כל אשר חפץ ה' עשה בשמים ובארץ דע שהכל כחפצו יעשה ואף על פי שמעשינו מסורין לנו כיצד כשם שהיוצר חפץ להיות האש והרוח עולים למעלה והמים והארץ יורדים למטה והגלגל סובב בעיגול וכן שאר בריות העולם להיות כמנהגן שחפץ בו ככה חפץ להיות האדם רשותו בידו וכל מעשיו מסורין לו ולא יהיה לו לא כופה ולא מושך אלא הוא מעצמו ובדעתו שנתן לו האל עושה כל שהאדם יכול לעשות</p>\n  \n  <p>A person should not wonder: How is it possible for one to do whatever he wants and be responsible for his own deeds? - Is it possible for anything to happen in this world without the permission and desire of its Creator as [Psalms 135:6] states: \"Whatever God wishes, He has done in the heavens and in the earth?\"</p>\n  \n  <p>One must know that everything is done in accord with His will and, nevertheless, we are responsible for our deeds.</p>\n  \n  <p>How is this [apparent contradiction] resolved? Just as the Creator desired that [the elements of] fire and wind rise upward and [those of] water and earth descend downward, that the heavenly spheres revolve in a circular orbit, and all the other creations of the world follow the nature which He desired for them, so too, He desired that man have free choice and be responsible for his deeds, without being pulled or forced. Rather, he, on his own initiative, with the knowledge which God has granted him, will do anything that man is able to do.</p>\n  \n  <p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911903/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially, then, God's will is that humans override what He \"wanted\" the law to be.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The question is based on  the perception that in Torah Shel Bal Peh we are trying to backwards engineer the Torah in order to figure out what Hashem's intention was.

Even when we say אלו ואלו — and take it to mean that both are somehow equally correct about the original intent — this will still leave the idea of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.59b.5?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נצחוני בני</a> unexplained.</p>\n\n<p>However, we find in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tanna_debei_Eliyahu_Zuta%2C_Seder_Eliyahu_Zuta.2.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tana D'Bei Eliyahu Zuta 2</a> that the Torah Shebiksav is compared to wheat and flax-seeds that are given to us to embelish and make cakes and nice clothing therewith.

    "content": "# Yetziv Pisgam and Chabakuk\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One common Ashkenazi minhag on Shavuos is to recite the piyut (poem) of Yetziv Pisgam on the second day of Shavuot after the first Passuk of the Haftorah from Chabakuk. The first letter of each line forms an acrostic, spelling out the name of the author, Yaakov BeRabbi Meir Levi, who is commonly identified as Rabbeinu Tam.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that Yetziv Pisgam is for the <em>meturgaman</em> (translator) to ask permission to read his translation of the Haftara and Shavuos is a time to ask permission just like Moshe asked permission to give the Torah on Mount Sinai see <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/836261/davida-kollmar/the-minhag-of-reciting-yetziv-pitgam/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question</strong>: What specific link is there between the Piyut and the Haftara passage from Chabakuk? </p>\n\n<p>After all, this Piyut could have been said on the first day Shavuos during the Haftara of Yechezkel just like the Akdomos are said then.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Some quick Otzar Hachochma searching has revealed the following:</p>\n\n<p>Tessler's Minhagei Chag Hashavuos (Anaf B, 1) notes that Yetziv Pisgam has nothing in particular to do with Shavuos, and in fact, in some communities it was recited on the 7th day of Pesach.  If this is the case, there is no reason for why we read it on the second day specifically...</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand he ignores the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9223&st=&pgnum=160\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levush (OC 494:2)</a>, who connects Yetziv Pisgam which mentions names of Malachim to the Ma'aseh Merkava, and since the The first Passuk of the Parsha of Chabakuk is referring to Ma'seh Merkava which is why it is read on second day Shavuot, so we read Yetziv Pisgam as well after the first Passuk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומפטיר בחבקוק מן ויי בהיכל קדשו עד למנצח בנגינותי שהוא  ג״ב מעשה מרכבה<br>\n   סימן ת״צ סעיף ט  ומזכדין נשמות כרפ״ל<br>\n  ונוהגין לומר יציב פתגם (בפוזנא אין אומרים) אחר פסוק ראשון שיש בו ג\"כ מענין המרכבה והמלאכים.‏ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Levush, it would seem to fit in nicely on the first day as well.</p>\n\n<p>However, in Takanas Hashavim to OC 494 Taz 1, he notes what should be a good answer according to the Levush and others, namely, that Tosefta Megillah 3:19 implies that even according to those who permit reading the Ma'aseh Merkava, we would not translate it publicly.  If so, there was no translation of the Haftarah on the first day of Shavuos, and therefore, no permission was asked before translation. Whereas the second day since the Merkava has already been mentioned in the first Passuk, the Targum can be said on the rest of the Parsha from then on.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Hashem care about Halachah Lemaase?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Upfront: this is a metaphysical/theological question</p>\n\n<p>In many (almost all?) areas of Jewish practice, there are a number of different and at times diametrically opposed opinions as to what the practice should be. Even if say that all opinions are true (eilu veilu) in some sense, we can only do one thing in practice, and hence one of the opinions is chosen to be halacha lemaase [of course different individuals/groups may choose different opinions as their halacha lemaase, as decided by the posek they ask].</p>\n\n<p>My question is - after 120, does G-d care that we followed the halacha lemaase, and as long as we did that in good faith, we're ok as far as judgement and reward/punishment goes? Or perhaps He cares that we follow the <em>right</em> opinion (the <em>correct</em> truth, if such even exists), and so those who followed the wrong practical opinion would be in trouble?</p>\n\n<p>As an example, one person carries outside on Shabbos while his neighbor does not, because the former takes as his practical halacha an opinion deeming the eruv as valid, while the latter's posek says it's invalid. Will they both be judged based on their faithful observance of what they thought was the right view, or will they be judged based on the correctness of only one of these views?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=130&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shabbat 130a</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר במקומו של ר\"א היו כורתין עצים לעשות פחמין לעשות ברזל בשבת במקומו של ר' יוסי הגלילי היו אוכלין בשר עוף בחלב לוי איקלע לבי יוסף רישבא קריבו ליה רישא דטוותא בחלבא לא אכל כי אתא לקמיה דרבי א\"ל אמאי לא תשמתינהו א\"ל אתריה דר' יהודה בן בתירה הוה ואמינא דילמא דרש להו כר' יוסי הגלילי דתנן ר' יוסי הגלילי אומר נאמר לא תאכלו כל נבלה ונאמר לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו את שאסור משום נבלה אסור לבשל בחלב עוף שאסור משום נבלה יכול יהא אסור לבשל בחלב ת\"ל בחלב אמו יצא עוף שאין לו חלב אם א\"ר יצחק עיר אחת היתה בא\"י שהיו עושין כר\"א והיו מתים בזמנן ולא עוד אלא שפעם אחת גזרה מלכות הרשעה גזרה על ישראל על המילה ועל אותה העיר לא גזרה</p>\n<p>Our Rabbis taught: In R. Eliezer's locality they used to cut timber to make charcoal for making iron on the Sabbath. In the locality of R. Jose the Galilean they used to eat flesh of fowl with milk. Levi visited the home of Joseph the fowler [and] was offered the head of a peacock in milk, [which] he did not eat. When he came before Rabbi he asked him, Why did you not place them under the ban?  It was the locality of R. Judah b. Bathyra, replied he, and I thought, Perhaps he has lectured to them in accordance with R. Jose the Galilean. For we learnt: R. Jose the Galilean said: It is said, Ye shall not eat any nebelah,  and it is said, Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk:  [this teaches,] that which is forbidden on the score of nebelah may not be seethed in milk. Now since a fowl is prohibited when nebelah, you might think that one must not seethe it in milk; therefore it is stated, 'in its mother's milk', hence a fowl is excluded, since it has no mother's milk.</p>\n<p>R. Isaac said: There was one town in Palestine where they followed R. Eliezer,  and they died there at the [proper] time,  Moreover, the wicked State once promulgated a decree against Israel concerning circumcision,  yet did not decree [it] against that town.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_130.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems from this passage that the people of R. Eliezer's town were judged favorably, even rewarded, for following his ruling even though his ruling was rejected from the accepted corpus of halacha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>In my approach, G-d follows the Gemmorah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.17a.8?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berochos 17a</a>ת i.g. follows one's heart:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אחד המרבה ואחד הממעיט ובלבד שיכוין לבו לשמים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once G-d declared \"נצחוני בניי\" in R' Eliezer and the Rabbis' argument (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.59b.5?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B\"M 59b</a>), He allowed the Rabbis to develop the Halachah anyway they like.</p>\n\n<p>If we still assume that G-d does care for the fulfilment of the Torah commandments, we should remember that all Rabbinical decrees, Halochos, rulings, Minhagim, etc, all stem from one Mitzvah of following the rulings of the Supreme Sanhedrin \"ועשית ככל אשר יורוך\" (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Mamrim 1</a>) which was further modified into \"following Rabbis\", in general.</p>\n\n<p>So as long as a person follows a Rabbi's rulings it appears he'll be fine with the Heavenly court as he could claim \"who said Rabbi X is better than Rabbi Y?\". Or if he truly believes he's a Tzadik (acts solely for the G-d's sake), he can follow \"וְצַדִּיק בֶּאֱמוּנָתוֹ יִחְיֶה׃\" and follow his own conclusions (that's what Rabbis themselves do).</p>\n\n\n",

They've gotten bigger and more colorful, and, there is a larger variety of publishers and designers.</p>\n\n<p>I'm having some trouble finding online resources on the \"history\" of benchers. I sense that there were some factors among the religious community that felt that benchers shouldn't be just for Birkat Hamazon and Kiddush, but eventually included zemirot, sometimes tefillot and a few other items. And, now, it seems that all the wedding benchers have to have an artistic logo - which wasn't done years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone suggest some resources on where / how I can locate something that explains this history as well as if you know any store or person that sells such old benchers in NYC metro area?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Some suggested resources: </p>\n\n<p>Yiddish Prof. <a href=\"https://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%94_%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Havah Turniansky</a> has an article <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24160128?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> treating old editions of bentchers.

    "content": "# Why are huge challot displayed on the wedding couple / Bar Mitzvah's table?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I noticed that among Orthodox and, seemingly Hareidi Bar Mitzvah's and weddings, a huge challah is cut by the chattan or Bar Mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that there must be some <em>minhag</em> behind this that originated somewhere for some reason. I don't think it's just to feed the attendants, because usually bread or rolls is available in a table bread basket or at each seating, and the challah is usually cut (esp. at weddings) long after people ate the appetizer / first course.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The earliest source for having a large Challah at a wedding is the <em><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1954&pgnum=13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maasas Binyomin</a></em> (d. 1620)</p>\n\n<p>There is a wide spread custom to distribute slices of the large <em>challa</em> to the friends of the Chosson and Kallah. Some say (<em>Nittei Gavriel</em> quotes <em>Darkei Chaim</em> p27, who heard this from R' Akiva Eiger) that this is based on the famous question posed at every marriage: '<strong>מצא</strong> או <strong>מוציא</strong>' - every marriage has the potential to be ׳<strong>מצא</strong> אשה מצא טוב׳, or conversely to be '<strong>מוצא</strong> אני את האשה'. Therefore immediately after they partake of it, we remove the ׳<strong>המוצא</strong>׳ from in front of them, as if to symbolize that only one option remains - that of מצא אשה מצא טוב. (A similar sentiment is brought in the Beis Emes [authored by the Lev Simcha of Ger], based on Eruvin 54)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Perhaps the custom originated from the <em>halacha</em> that the <em>chosson</em> is בוצע תחילה (See <em>Berachos</em> 47, <em>Magen Avraham OC\"H</em> 167.29); he is the first to 'break the bread'. It is possible that in the times when they observed this halacha, everyone partook of the bread from the central loaf which the <em>chosson</em> cut.</p>\n\n<p>Today, this <em>halacha</em> is virtually obsolete, because at our weddings the public begin the meal and partake of the bread before the <em>chosson</em> and <em>kallah</em> arrive, and everybody has their own roll. </p>\n\n\n",

Rather, the Sefer up to this point focuses on one general concept, while these last passages, beginning with Arachin, are fundamentally different – hence their position at the end, almost as an afterthought. In his own words (as <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/the-hirsch-chumash\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">translated by Feldheim</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The book of Vayikra teaches us our duty to the Sanctuary of the Torah. We are to symbolize through offerings and to realize in practice the sanctification of our lives as individuals and as a nation. And, finally, the preceding chapter states that the חוקים משפטים ותורות — which tell us what we must do in order to hallow our lives as individuals and as a nation — are the sole intermediaries of the covenant between ourselves and God, and the sole means for assuring our welfare. </p>\n  \n  <p>Scripture now adds a concluding chapter on voluntary donations to the Sanctuary. A person feels the need or has the desire to give to the Sanctuary an object or its equivalent value, in order to demonstrate his special interest in the Sanctuary, or to signify the special relationship that — in his view — exists between the object and the Sanctuary. </p>\n  \n  <p>These donations to the Sanctuary are called here הפלאת נדר (v. 2 כי יפליא נדר). They are not required by law, and do not stem from the requirements of the law. Rather, they spring purely from one’s own feelings. </p>\n  \n  <p>It is characteristic that this chapter, which deals with donations to the Sanctuary, appears — by its position — merely as a supplementary concluding chapter. Scripture thus explicitly states that this chapter is not included among the חוקים משפטים ותורות, which God has set as the condition בינו ובין בני ישראל, and whose fulfillment will result in the fullness of blessing, and whose violation will bring about all the misery described in the preceding chapter. The donations to the Sanctuary are clearly separated from the חוקים משפטים ותורות, and this teaches us an important point:</p>\n  \n  <p>תורת כהנים, the Jewish priestly code, does not attach special value to Sanctuary donations, and does not see in them special piety, especially pleasing to God. Certainly, then, it does not ascribe to them the power to atone for a sinful life. The Sanctuary of the כהנים sees its mission not in gaining possessions, but in gaining hearts and souls. It seeks to gain the whole of our lives — as individuals and as a nation — for the fulfillment of the חוקים, the משפטים, and the תורות. The sanctification of morality, the safeguarding of justice in society, the enlightenment of the mind and the ennoblement of the heart — the חוקים, the משפטים, and the תורות — they are the sole means of attaining God’s grace. It is they that mediate בינו ובין בני ישראל, and only they bring man closer to God, and God closer to man. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the Kli Yakar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איש כי יפליא נדר וגו'. <strong>סמך פר' זו לקללות לומר שישראל נודרים בעת צרה\n  כיעקב שהיה נודר בעת צרה ליתן מעשר מכל</strong>, אבל לא כיעקב מכל וכל כי יעקב גם\n  אחר שעברה הצרה לא סר מן הדרך הטוב, אבל לדורות זה דרכם כסל למו שנודרים\n  בעת צרה ובעבור סופה צרה וצוקה הם מתחרטים ושבים לסורם וזה כמשל הקנה\n  שקלל בו אחיה השילוני את ישראל (מלכים א' יד טו) כי הקנה הזה אינו נכנע\n  כי אם בזמן שהרוח נושב בו וכנוח הרוח הוא חוזר ועומד בקומה זקופה\n  כבראשונה, כך ישראל אינן נכנעים כי אם בזמן שהצרה משמשת וירא ישראל כי\n  היתה הרוחה והכבד את לבו כי בסור המכריח ישובו לסורם, ומסכים לדברינו מה\n  שפירש בעל הטורים (כז א) שכל מספר השקלים קמ\"ג כנגד קמ\"ג קללות שבתורת\n  כהנים ובמשנה תורה (עיין מדרש תדשא אוצר המדרשים ע' 480), וכי מפני\n  שמספרם שוה נסמכו להדדי, אלא לומר לך שקמ\"ג קללות שבתוכחה גורמין נדרי\n  קמ\"ג שקלים כי אין ישראל נודרים ליתן מן ממונם לשם ה' כי אם בשעה שהצרות\n  מכריחין אותן, כמו שיתבאר בע\"ה לקמן פרשת וילך (לא יז) על פסוק והיה כי\n  תמצאן אותו רעות רבות וצרות. שדרשו רז\"ל (חגיגה ה.) על המלוה לעני בשעת\n  דחקו, ודרש זה רחוק לקבלו שכל הצרות לא יכריחום אל הוידוי כי אם צרה זו,\n  על כן רצוני לפרש שזה מדבר במלוה לעני בבא הצרה דווקא דהיינו בשעת דחקו\n  של המלוה כי הצרות דוחקין אותו לזה לידור נדרים לצדקה, וטעות של הנודר על\n  זה האופן יתבאר בעזרת ה' לקמן פר' וילך, על כן סמך פרשת כי יפליא לפרשת\n  התוכחה ודבר הכתוב בהווה. אבל כל מה שהאדם עושה בלא הכרח מרצון זהו נקרא\n  יום רצון לה' (ישעיה נח ה) ויפק רצון מה' (משלי ח לה).    תם ספר ויקרא -\n  בעזרת האל הגדול הגבור והנורא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar says that the Parsha of Arachin is juxtaposed to the Parsha of the Klalos because the Jewish people are emulating the actions of Yaakov Avinu, who made pledges when he found himself in difficult times. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I would like to suggest my own idea (based on the Kli Yakar above).

    "content": "# Keter Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Crown) tanach on the ten sons of Haman\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm currently writing a paper on the famed \"purimfest 1946.\" In attempt to respond to all rebuttals that are brought up, I need to take a glance at the most authoritative tanach, the Aleppo Codex. However, the Esther portion of the code was destroyed in 1947. The jerusalem crown tanach under the auspices of Rabbi Mordechai brewer reconstructed the missing portions. If anyone has this tanach, also known as the Keter Yerushalayim, I would love to know what is written by the ten sons of Haman, does is it have a small tav shin and zayin as we have it today?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Yes, it has the reduced Tav, Shin and Zayin as well as the enlarged Vav.</p>\n\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that the enlarged Vav distinguishes that it is not referring to a year count, but the millennia. So the year indicated would be 5707.</p>\n\n<p>It's also worth pointing that <em>some</em> wish to suggest that the small and large letters printed in the Keter Yerushalayim are not according to the Keter Aram Tzovah, but rather upon the rulings found in Sefer Minchat Shai by Rabbi Yedidiah Shlomo ben Avraham Nortzi.</p>\n\n<p>But reviewing <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19706&st=&pgnum=270&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the footnotes to the Minchat Shai to Esther concerning the ten sons of Haman</a>, he discusses specific poskim with different small or large letters and those with none. But then he states that \"and in all the precisely written seforim\" (ובכל ספרים מדוייקים) the letters, etc. are as it has been reproduced in Keter Yerushalayim.</p>\n\n<p>The question becomes, which <em>precisely written seforim</em> is the Minchat Shai referring to?</p>\n\n<p>That is answered by looking to the beginning of <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19706&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the comments of the Minchat Shai to Sefer Bereshit</a>. He lists the many poskim and sofrim that he has looked at and then explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואנחנו סומכים על קריאת בן אשר. וכן סמך עליו הרמב״ם ז״ל וכמנהג מערבי</p>\n  \n  <p>And we rely upon the reading of Ben Asher. And so (too) Rambam z\"l relies upon him and like the minhag of the west.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case, <em>the west</em> appears to be used like it is with the Talmud Yerushalmi which is also called Talmud HaMa'aravi.</p>\n\n<p>And it is known that the <em>precisely written Tanach</em> which Rambam used in formulating the laws of writing a sefer Torah in the Mishnah Torah, was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_Codex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keter Aram Tzovah</a>. So the Minchat Shai is actually relying upon what he saw or what others relayed to him was in the Keter Aram Tzovah for the large and small letters to the ten sons of Haman.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qGXq6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/qGXq6.jpg\" alt=\"Frontis\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nyZ2x.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nyZ2x.jpg\" alt=\"ten sons close\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ociuf.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ociuf.jpg\" alt=\"10 sons full page\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The text of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblia_Hebraica_Stuttgartensia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</a>'s Esther, which is based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Codex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leningrad codex</a> (the oldest extant Tanakh manuscript), does not have such variant sizes. Particularly, there is no note either indicating that other manuscripts consulted have these forms either. </p>\n\n<p>While the Leningrad codex was not written by Ben Asher, it is the closest manuscript to the Ben Asher tradition containing Esther.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TrM6e.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TrM6e.jpg\" alt=\"BHS\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Aharon Ben Asher, who in fact was the naqdan of the Aleppo Codex, wrote a Masoretic treatise called Diqduqe Hatteamim, which contains a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38509&hilite=fc647895-9183-4069-857c-6656146e6924&st=%D7%92%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9F&pgnum=89\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">list</a> of large and small letters. The list in the Baer and Strack edition enumerates all the small letters in this section (ת, ש, ז) and the big ו. (If you want to be rigourous in this, it is worth consulting the more accurate edition of A. Dotan; the Baer and Strack edition is known for including Masoretic traditions that Ben Asher did not author).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I could not find this section in Dotan's edition. Evidently Dotan does not agree that it was written by Ben Asher. </p>\n\n<p>In the extant Aleppo codex, there is one big letter ('הַ לה) without a corresponding note, and three small <em>nunim</em> (Is. 45:14, Jer. 39:13, Prov. 15:28) with the note \"3 small <em>nunin</em>\".

    "content": "# Asking a second Rabbi for a ruling\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Tosafot on Avodah Zarah 7a: [translation from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/104068/is-one-obligated-to-listen-to-a-rav/104072#104072\">here]\n</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is forbidden to ask [a second rabbi for permission] only if one  does not inform him [that a first rabbi was consulted and he forbade it]...  But certainly the [second] sage should be careful not to permit [what the first sage forbade], as we say in the chapter Kol Hayad [in Maseches Niddah], \"A sage who forbade - his fellow is not allowed to permit unless he can respond to him, for instance if he made a mistake regarding a Mishnah, or even with equal logic.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(1) What is the point of allowing you to consult a second rabbi if that second rabbi is strongly discouraged from disagreeing with the first?  Why not just say, \"You must go with the first ruling you got.\"?</p>\n\n<p>(2) Why should that second rabbi be asked to produce strong and convincing logical arguments for his disagreement, when the first rabbi is not also asked to produce equally strong and convincing logical arguments for his ruling in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>(Note that Tosafot talk only about a case when the first rabbi \"forbade\"; because if the first rabbi permitted, very few Jews would ask for a second opinion!)</p>\n\n<p>Note also that when you ask for a medical second opinion, no one is leaning on the second physician to agree with the first.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are two reasons given why the second Rabbi may not contradict the ruling of the first Rabbi (with according differences):</p>\n\n<p>1) Kovod - out of respect to the first Rabbi. By issuing a ruling, he has 'claimed jurisdiction', so to speak, of this <em>shaila</em>. (See Rashi Nidda 20b, Ran A\"Z 7)</p>\n\n<p>2) Because regardless of what the second Rabbi believes, it is actually forbidden. Applying the dictum of שויה אנפשיה חתיכה דאיסורא, the item becomes forbidden when the first Rabbi rules it so, regardless of it's actual status. This is either because the <em>shoel</em>, by asking, has consented to accept [According to this reason, if one asks without any intention of accepting the answer, it would not be forbidden], or because the Rabbi has the ability to render the item forbidden by <em>paskening</em> it so. Thus, it would be useless for the second Rabbi to rule it permitted, because it has actually become forbidden either way. (Ran A\"Z 7)</p>\n\n<p>An obvious difference given between the two opinions is whether the second rabbi may forbid something the first rabbi already permitted. </p>\n\n<p>[See Shu\"t Meishiv Davar V2 §9, Urim veTumim §25.13, for further definition of שויה אנפשיה חתיכה דאיסורא, and the <em>halacha</em> when the first Rabbi <em>paskened</em> without being asked.]  </p>\n\n\n",

For example, Tiferes Yisrael writes that a single man will get comfortable with the mothers of children, <strong>even if he does not do Yichud with them</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר\"ל לא ילמוד עם תנוקת, דעי\"ז מתרגל עם אמותיהן של הילדים. ואפילו לא יתיחד עמהן אסור [סי' כ\"ב]:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, there are some sources which do seem to tie the prohibition to Yichud. This can be explained in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The children being discussed are too young to nullify the Yichud situation </li>\n<li>We are concerned for purposeful Yichud which arises as a result of their relationship</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch EH 22:20 (see below link) uses the general, non-Yichud language about a single man, and the language of Yichud for a single woman.

This pattern is very common, for example, with laws of idolatry, most of which are irrelevant today and some were allowed and some hold still.</p>\n\n<p>Besides some common logic, are there any signs in the text of the Gemmorah (and other Rabbinical literature) that indicate that a certain Halachah/ruling/decree is relative to their times and conditions, but another should not change, no matter what changes in human knowledge or nature will occur?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes.

Since 10-14 weren't practically applicable at the time of the mishnah, the implication is that they're universal whenever viduy maaser applies.  On the other hand, Yochanan Kohen Gadol's decree to stop it was temporary (and couldn't be otherwise - it's an explicit mitzvah in the Torah).</p>\n\n\n",

I was recently at the wedding of a couple (already had a child) that had converted to Judaism and remarried Jewishly (first Jewish wedding), and they called her \"Giyurta Da\", and her kesubah sum was 100 zuz.

I would assume if she was visibly pregnant or something along those lines they would not write 200 zuz.</p>\n\n<p>While I don't have an explicit source for this (no access to fancy databases right now, or even a Hebrew Keyboard to google things with), Rav Shternbuch in Teshuvos Vehanhagos 1:755 talks about making Sheva Brachos meals for a couple when she was not a virgin, and allows a \"beracha levatalah\" so that she will not be embarrassed.

    "title": "Do convertible bonds issued between Jews conform with Halakha of interest?",
    "content": "# Do convertible bonds issued between Jews conform with Halakha of interest?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible_bond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">convertible note</a> (a.k.a. \"convertible bond\") is a financial instrument that is a hybrid between debt and equity in a business. The way it works is that an investor invests some money in a company, called the principal. At some point (typically during a round of fundraising), the investment is converted from debt to common stock in the company. So instead of the debt being repaid in cash, it is discharged in equity. These notes are often issued in the early days of a company when an accurate valuation would be very difficult or impossible to determine, making it difficult for investors to purchase equity directly. Typically, there are a few ways the investor can profit from this arrangement, and I am wondering about the status of all of these factors with respect to the halakhos of ribbis:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Valuation Cap</h1>\n\n<p>The valuation cap of an investment is the maximum amount that can be considered the valuation for calculating the number of shares received upon conversion. For example, if a convertible note has a valuation cap of $4M and the company has a fundraising round with a valuation of $12M at $10/share, the note will convert to equity as if the valuation were $4M. So the investment will convert from debt to equity at a conversion factor of $3.33/share (i.e. 1/3 of the actual price per share).</p>\n\n<h1>Discount Factor</h1>\n\n<p>The discount factor is a percentage by which the share price is discounted at the time of conversion. If a convertible note has a discount percentage of 20% and the company issues shares at $10/share, the debt will be converted to equity at a rate of $8/share.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, convertible notes will have both a valuation cap and a discount factor and whichever method provides the best result for the investor (i.e. the method that results in receiving the greatest number of shares) is the one that is used. Convertible notes may also have an interest rate.</p>\n\n<h1>Interest Rate</h1>\n\n<p>Similar to regular debt, the interest rate is the rate at which the principal grows in value before it is converted. For example, if the investment has a 10% interest rate compounded annually and a fundraising round is held exactly one year after the date on the note, a $10,000 investment will convert to equity with a value of $11,000.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>All of the above factors seem like they could be problematic with respect to the laws of charging interest if the debt is between two Jews, especially the interest rate. On the other hand, perhaps because the debt is not discharged as repayment with interest, it would be permitted. What would be the <em>din</em> of convertible notes?</p>\n\n\n",

I am sure I learned what they were at the time, but I've long forgotten most of them. </p>\n\n<p>When I try to look for information on this, I can find a lot of people mentioning the concept, but not an actual list of which letters were for each body part. </p>\n\n<p>Can anyone guide me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You may be looking for a concept discussed in <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em>.  I don't have a proper copy nearby, so this excerpt (presumably the first section) from a <em>Tikun Leil Shavuos</em> may be helpful:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קשר עשרים ושתים אותיות התורה בלשונו וכו'.‏\n  אויר רויה גויה, ארץ קר וחום ובטן, ושמים ראש, זהו אמ\"ש:‏<br>\n  שבתאי, שבת, ופה. צדק, אחד בשבת, ועין ימין. מאדים, שני בשבת, ועין שמאל.\n  חמה, שלישי בשבת, ואף ימין. נגה, רביעי בשבת, ואף שמאל. כוכב, חמישי בשבת, ואזן ימין.\n  לבנה ,ששי בשבת ואזן שמאל. זה בג\"ד כפר\"ת:‏<br>\n  ואלה שנים עשר מזלות: טלה, ניסן, כבד. שור, אייר, מרה. תאומים, סיון, טחול. סרטן, תמוז, \n  המסס. אריה, אב, כוליא ימין. בתולה, אלול, כוליא שמאל. מאזנים, תשרי, קרקבן. עקרב, \n  מרחשון, קבה. קשת, כסלו, יד ימין. גדי, טבת, יד שמאל. דלי, שבט, רגל ימין. דגים, אדר, \n  רגל שמאל. זהו ה\"ו, ז\"ח, ט\"י, ל\"ן, ס\"ע, צ\"ק.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This works out to be something to the effect of (translation mine, on the fly): <em>Aleph</em> - the גויה; <em>bet</em> - mouth; <em>gimel</em> - right eye; <em>daled</em> - left eye;\n<em>hei</em> - liver; <em>vav</em> - the מרה (humor); <em>zayin</em> - the טחול; <em>ches</em> - the מסס;\n<em>tes</em> - right kidney; <em>yod</em> - left kidney; <em>kof</em> - right nostril; <em>lamed</em> - the קרקבן;\n<em>mem</em> - abdomen; <em>nun</em> - the קבה; <em>samech</em> - right hand; <em>ayin</em> - left hand;\n<em>pei</em> - left nostril; <em>tzadi</em> - right foot; <em>kuf</em> - left foot; <em>reish</em> - right ear;\n<em>shin</em> - head; <em>tav</em> - left ear.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>B'nei Yissoschor</em> quotes the <em>Sefer Yetzira</em> in the first chapter for each month, and explains the connection between the month, zodiac sign, organ, and letter.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible (likely?) that the list you learned as a child is entirely different, but I believe this list is somewhat authoritative. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to Sefer Yetzira.

(As always, consult your rabbi for practical guidance.)</p>\n<p>Seemingly, the pauper-taunting is the fulfilling of a <em>mitzva</em> (command), alluding to the fact that he can still do so and the deceased cannot. This logic apparently does not apply to mitzvot done for the benefit of the deceased. For example, burying the body and attendin the funeral are themsleves mitzvot, which are obviously permitted. But the same logic could apply to far more mitzvot than the number listed by the poskim relating to Torah, prayer, tzitzit and tefilin.</p>\n<p>Is there a prohibition, then, on fulfilling other commands also, when apparent to onlookers, except in honor of the deceased? For example, if my father and I are near a grave and he asks me for his sweater that I'm holding, so that he may wear it, am I not allowed to pass it to him, because that would be obviously fulfilling the <em>mitzva</em> of honoring my father? If someone begs for charity near a grave, am I not allowed to give? If there's a fall hazard near a grave, am I forbidden from putting a railing up?) If (as I suspect) fulfilling all <em>mitzvos</em> is <strong>not</strong> prohibited, then why not? What's special about <em>tzitzis</em>, <em>t'filin</em>, reciting Torah and prayers, and holding a Torah scroll? And if fulfilling all <em>mitzvos</em> is in fact prohibited (at least when apparent to onlookers), why doesn't <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> say so as a blanket rule?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Not all mitzvot fall into the category of \"taunting the pauper.\"</p>\n<p>The rationale presented in ברכת פרץ, within Parshat Terumah, proposes that only a mitzvah readily identifiable as such would fall under the category of \"taunting a pauper.\" Rabbi Yaakov Kanievsky tries to explain the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Terumah.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Medrash Tanchuma</a>, where R. Yannai states: \"Any priest who is not a student of the law, it is permitted to eat the offering on his grave.\" Initially, he aims to clarify the distinction between a student of the law and one who is not, in the context of the taunting issue. However, ultimately, he emphasizes that consuming Terumah near a grave never presents a taunting issue because it's not immediately evident that one is consuming Terumah; it could just as easily be Chulin.</p>\n<p>This reasoning finds its foundation in the interpretation found in the Beit Yosef. It suggests that the language used, such as \"head tefillin,\" allows for the permissibility of arm tefillin because it remains concealed from the deceased. This same principle can also be applied to the mitzvah of Kibud av, as affirmed by Rav Yaakov Aaron Skoczylas in his halachic work, Ohel Yaakov, making reference to Beis Matisyahu, Siman 5, and the perspective of Rabbi Nebenzahl. In Beis Matisyahu, he brings supporting evidence from the sugya in Yevamot 6a, which suggests that Kibud av can indeed be observed even in a cemetery. This line of reasoning may also be extended to Tzedakah. For a more comprehensive analysis, one should consult references to יעלת חן, Siman 63, and Beis Matiyahu.</p>\n<p>Yaaleh Chayn similarly concludes that Tzedakah, returning a lost object, and honoring one's parents are permissible in the presence of the deceased, albeit with slightly different reasons.</p>\n<p>Another distinction could be made based on the halachic responsa found in Sefer Halacha Limoshe, Rabbi Moshe Nyman addresses Pesachim 47b, which seems to suggest that covering blood is allowed in a burial site. He distinguishes between mitzvot that can be fulfilled through another person. Consequently, Tzitzit, Tefillin, and Torah-related activities pose an issue, while covering blood and returning lost objects do not, as the latter can be fulfilled through another. (However, for further insights, one should refer to יעלת חן).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Beis Matisyahu provides a thorough exploration of the unique aspects of each mitzvah mentioned in the Gemara. Importantly, there is no problem with the Shulchan Aruch, as it just references the Gemara.</p>\n\n\n",

That can't be, because Judaism does not mandate belief. (The Rambam believed it did, other luminaries disagreed, but the fact is that you can't make yourself believe.  In Eichah Rabbah, Prologue II (see also Yerushalmi, Chagigah 1:7), we read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is written \"They have forsaken Me and have not kept My law\" [Jer. 16:11].  [This means that God said:] I wish they had forsaken Me but still kept My law, because by occupying themselves with it, the light which it contains would have led them back to the right path.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(2) That you may believe what you want, but you may not SAY or preach certain things out loud?  That's a matter of action, not belief, and you can certainly control yourself.  (The Mishnah says: He who SAYS.)</p>\n<p>(3) That it's your belief that CAUSES your portion in the World to Come to become real? (Mind over matter, as it were, which gets us into esoterica, philosophy, and even physics.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 90a) understands the Mishnah as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גמ׳ וכל כך למה תנא הוא כפר בתחיית המתים לפיכך לא יהיה לו חלק בתחיית המתים שכל מדותיו של הקב\"ה מדה כנגד מדה</p>\n  \n  <p>Why all of this [punishment]? It was taught: “He denied resurrection of the dead; therefore, he will not have a portion in the resurrection of the dead, for all the measures of Hashem are measure for measure.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to preclude your second option. If the whole point is that one who doesn’t believe in the resurrection will not personally take part in it, <em>saying</em> it shouldn’t be required, only <em>believing</em> it. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding the question posed by your first option: The Mishnah says that only one who says there’s no resurrection <em>from the Torah</em> loses his portion of it, and the Gemara spends the next daf or so bringing some fifteen sources from the Chumash that the dead will rise again. So it’s not strict belief, once you accept a proof of the Torah’s Divine origin. </p>\n\n<p>You are correct that it’s better that one learn Torah and not keep Mitzvos, as learning Torah will cause him to keep Mitzvos; it’s for this reason that the Rambam (who, interestingly, leaves out “from the Torah” when quoting this Halacha in Teshuvah 3:6) writes that one who does Teshuvah before he dies from this or other sins for which one loses his portion, even from denying Hashem’s existence, will regain his portion (Teshuvah 3:14). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>While this still doesn’t fully answer the question, I hope it provides some clarity which can aid the OP or someone else to come to a fuller answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You may be onto something. While I don't have halachic sources \"on hand,\" it depends on ones definition of \"alive\" and \"dead.\"</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It can be for when Moshiach comes, that all souls will be resurrected. How that works is something that only Hashem knows, since at 8.2 billion people with millions of births and deaths per second, it seems to make more sense that one or four souls goes into one body (touching on a bit of Shaar HaGilgulim), each one being the product of many reincarnations, as opposed to EVERY single person that ever existed popping up.</li>\n<li>It can be in that the next world, which is the World of Truth, is where one is truly \"alive\", and therefore not believing in Resurrection of the Dead\" means that the \"dead\" in this world won't be \"alive\" in the next world and therefore one simply won't be able to gain a portion of what he doesn't already believe in - that here he's \"dead\" and there he's \"alive\" and is making his portion here instead of there.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Those are a couple of personal thoughts on the matter.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does Rav Moshe calculate the \"50 minutes\" between שקיעה and צה\"כ?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>For New York, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein maintained that the time between שקיעה and צה\"כ is 50 mins (corresponding to walking 4 mil), unlike in Europe where it is 72 mins (see <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/_cdn/_materials/Bracha_Rishoina_by_Dr-_Edo_Lavi-503226.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... the calculation of  the 4 mil between sunset and tzeis.  His essential  thesis  is  based  on  personal  empirical observation.  Rav Moshe recalled that when he was in Europe, they waited 72 minutes in following the shita of the R”T.  Rav Moshe then claims that when he observed the  sky  in  New  York,  New  Jersey,  and  pashtus, the Catskills, the night sky resembled the 72 minute European night sky after only 50 minutes.  Rav Moshe then deduced that the 4 mil of the gm in pesachim are actually 50 minutes in duration.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have a few questions on this:</p>\n\n<p>1) how does Rav Moshe get to the 50 minutes between שקיעה and צה\"כ, is it an average of all times across the year? </p>\n\n<p>2) in reality, there will be occasions where stars come out early or later than 50 minutes. He obviously weighed up the problem of making a blanket 50 minute rule. What are the implications of this?</p>\n\n<p>3) at what latitude can the fluctuation of שקיעה to צה\"כ not be averaged in this way?</p>\n\n<p>4) is this method of calculating used anywhere else in the world?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I believe that the first three of the questions are based upon an erroneous assumption. For this ruling, it does not seem like Rav Moshe was trying to be precise. He was trying to give a time that, to his satisfaction, is certainly after the stars come out in New York. However, based upon Tosafos in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.35a.1?lang=he&with=Tosafot&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 35a</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.2a.5?lang=he&with=Tosafot&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 2a</a>, there is no known clear measure of when \"the stars\" have come out, because it is not know which stars are determinant of nightfall. So Rav Moshe had to make a subjective comparison to 72 minutes after sunset in Russia, and he considered 50 minutes in New York to be dark enough. But just like the 72 minutes is not a single level of darkness, so to 50. It does fluctuate with the time of year and needs to be adjusted for latitude, but that is not the point. The point it to give a convenient time to end Shabbos and make other halachic decisions.</p>\n<p>This time is used by many others, according to <a href=\"https://www.myzmanim.com/read/sources.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MyZmanim</a>. It is the 35 minute ending of Shabbos that is generally accepted in Eretz Yisroel.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the Vilna Gaon use the Yerushalmi version of Beitzo 1:10?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Vilna Gaon famously held that there is no proof from Chazal that the obligation of tefillin applies on Chol HaMo'eid. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beur_HaGra_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.31.2.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bi'ur HaGro on Shulchan Oruch Orach Chayyim 31:2:2</a>, he refutes the most famous proofs that the obligation of tefillin does apply on Chol HaMo'eid. One of those proofs is a Mishno, namely <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Beitzah.1.10?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beitzoh 1:10</a>. There are two versions of this Mishno - the Bavli version, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"One may send clothes... <strong>provided they are necessary for the festival</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and the Yerushalmi version, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"One may send clothes... <strong>even though they are not necessary for the festival</strong>.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All those that use this Mishno as a proof for the obligation to put on tefillin on Chol HaMo'eid use the Bavli version, and so to refute this as a proof, the Vilna Gaon says that the correct version is the Yerushalmi version.</p>\n\n<p>It is well known that the Talmud Bavli has been preserved far better and is far more reliable with regards to different versions of texts than the Talmud Yerushalmi (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Yevamot.104a.6?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos on Yevomos 104a</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Havot_Yair.23.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chovos Yo'ir 23:4</a>).</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: Why does the Vilna Ga'on decide to use the Yerushalmi version of Beitzo 1:10 instead of the Bavli version?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps these two quotes from Mavo Hatalmud (33) could provide some insight. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the Yerushalmi is an older version. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נשאר אצלנו לבאר ולדבר מענין חתימת המשנה והתלמוד, וכבר ידענו דסדר המשנה היה עוד קודם רבינו הקדוש ואמרו (שבת קכ״א ע״א) משנה זו בימי נחמי׳ בן חכליה נשנית, <strong>ראינו דכל המשניות בפ״ק דביצה,</strong> יבאו אלינו עוד מזמן נחמי׳ בן חכליה בתחלת בית שני בשעה שנאסר על ידו טלטול כלים בשבת,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps the Yerushalmi falls into this category, where Yerushalmi receives precedence. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן במאמרי התנאים אשר נזכרו בירושלמי להיפך מן הבבלי, אז גם בזה לירושלמי משפט הבכורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moreover, he differences in wording of אין and הן is understandable as being a scribe’s error. There is a similar phenomenon regarding the words אין and הן by the Mishna at the beginning of ch. 17 in Keilim. </p>\n\n\n",

However, a Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.33.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 33:1</a>) seems to discuss the same journey and indicates that males lived there as well (translation and boldfacing is from Artscroll):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֲלֶכְּסַנְדְּרוֹס מוֹקְדוֹן אֲזַל לְגַבֵּי מַלְכָּא קַצְיָא לַאֲחוֹרֵי הָרֵי חשֶׁךְ, וּשְׁלַח לֵיהּ, נְפַק לֵיהּ וְהוּא טָעֵין גִּדּוּמֵי דִּדְהַב בְּגוֹ דִּסְקוּס דִּדְהַב, אֲמַר לֵיהּ לְמָמוֹנָךְ אֲנָא צְרִיךְ. אֲמַר לֵיהּ וְלֹא הָיָה לְךָ מַה מֵּיכוֹל בְּאַרְעָךְ דַּאֲתֵית לָךְ לְהָדֵין</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Alexander of Macedonia went to</strong> see <strong>a king at the</strong> other <strong>end</strong> of the world, <strong>beyond the Mountains of Darkness. [The king] came out to</strong> greet <strong>[Alexander], and he was carrying golden loaves in a golden tray. [Alexander] said to him, \"Do</strong> you think that I came here because <strong>I need your money?!\" [The king] responded,</strong> \"If so, <strong>did you not have what to eat in your</strong> own <strong>land that you needed to come to this</strong> far-off land in search of food?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So far, the Midrash is very similar to the Gemara (skipping the part about Alexander waging war on them), except that apparently the city of women (a detail the Midrash doesn't note) has a <em>king</em>, not a queen. </p>\n\n<p>We see from the continuation of the Midrash that the king wasn't the only male in the city:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>, אֲמַר לֵיהּ לָא אָתֵית אֶלָּא בָּעְיָא לְמֵידַע הֵיךְ אַתּוּן דָּיְנִין, יְתִיב גַּבֵּיהּ, יוֹמָא חָדָא אָתָא חַד בַּר נָשׁ קֳבֵל עַל חַבְרֵיהּ, אֲמַר הָדֵין גַּבְרָא זַבַּן לִי חָדָא קִלְקַלְתָּא וְאַשְׁכָּחִית בְּגַוָּהּ סִימְתָא, הַהוּא דְּזָבִין אֲמַר קִלְקַלְתָּא זַבְּנִית סִימְתָא לָא זַבְּנִית, וְהַהוּא דְּזַבַּן אֲמַר קִלְקַלְתָּא וּמַה דִּבְגַּוָּהּ זַבֵּנִית. אֲמַר לְחַד מִנַּיְיהוּ אִית לָךְ בַּר דְּכַר, אֲמַר לֵיהּ הֵין. וַאֲמַר לְאוֹחֲרָנֵי אִית לָךְ בְּרַתָּא נֻקְבָא, אֲמַר לֵיהּ הֵין. אֲמַר לְהוֹן זִיל אַסֵּיב דֵּין לְדֵין וַהֲוֵי מָמוֹנָא לְתַרְוֵיהוֹן.‏</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>[Alexander] said to him, \"I came</strong> here <strong>only</strong> because <strong>I wanted to learn how you dispense justice.\"</strong> So <strong>[Alexander] sat near [the king]</strong> to observe how he judges the people. <strong>One day, an individual came</strong> before the king and <strong>presented a complaint against his friend.

I find it hard to believe that there's multiple cities beyond the Mountains of Darkness which Alexander visited, which all greeted him with golden loaves and the same rationale for doing so. Which leaves one of several possibilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The city initially gives the <em>appearance</em> of being of women, in order to dissuade any would-be attackers (as the Gemara describes). Once they're sure that the visitors won't attack them, the men come out as well.</li>\n<li>When the Gemara says that the city was <em>entirely</em> female, it means that it was <em>mostly</em> female (as often a majority is considered an entirety). The fact that most of the residents were women was enough for their argument of \"you'd be called a women-killer\" to take hold (perhaps it was a large majority).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

My question regards how this practice could be observed in a situation where one could not save the food. Perhaps one receives stipend food in a context where saving is not an option. (Office, army, hospital etc.) wWould Rabeinu Yonah then rather wasting of food or fulfilling this edict? Or perhaps only to fulfill it when saving is an option - what if it never becomes an option (and I am too weak to fast, but I want to overcome my desires of food etc.)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Yonah is not recommending we waste food. He is recommending we utilize some of each meal to practice self-restraint. Developing our ability to say \"no\" to a physical desire is no less important of a usage than consuming food to sustain our bodies and keep on living. After all, if we are weak in the ability to control such desires (<em>taavos</em>), how often will we make the wrong decision when having to choose between physical pleasure and doing the wrong thing?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemora in Eiruvin 53b mentions this practice of leaving food at the corner of the plate for the <em>shamash</em> (attender) to eat his portion (also see Shulchan Aruch OC 170,3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי יהושע בן חנניה...פעם אחת נתארחתי אצל אכסניא אחת עשתה לי פולין ביום ראשון אכלתים ולא שיירתי מהן כלום שנייה ולא שיירתי מהן כלום ביום שלישי הקדיחתן במלח כיון שטעמתי משכתי ידי מהן אמרה לי רבי מפני מה אינך סועד אמרתי לה כבר סעדתי מבעוד יום אמרה לי היה לך למשוך ידיך מן הפת אמרה לי רבי שמא לא הנחת פאה בראשונים <strong>ולא כך אמרו חכמים</strong> אין משיירין פאה באילפס אבל <strong>משיירין פאה בקערה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So usually the attendant would eat the leftovers in those days (though nowadays with all our Abundence thank G-d people no longer need to rely on such rations and every attendant has their own private portion), and there was no issue of <em>bal tashchis</em> wasting food. To the contrary giving food to the more deprived.       </p>\n\n<p>But if there wasn't any buttler available or if the buttler didn't want to eat leftovers that day, then <strong>Rabeinu Yonah is saying to keep the practice leaving food on the side and not to finish it just because its there,as people are used to giving themselves larger portions than they need for the benefit of the attendant</strong>. On these occassion it is quite clear that one would try save food for later, or when perishable find someone else to give leftovers to as the whole Minhag stems from giving the leftovers to others. </p>\n\n\n",

If, for instance, Gehennom is not <em>literally</em> above the sky, but rather the Beis Midrash of Eliyahu are employing a metaphor for something, then of course the question is moot.</p>\n\n\n",

Later on, the Rav realizes that he ruled incorrectly, and the questioner could, in fact, have eaten that food (or at least benefited from it).</p>\n\n<p>Is the Rav responsible for damages, for having ruled incorrectly and causing the questioner to lose money as a result?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are a lot of details about this depending exactly what kind of mistake it was and who was harmed how and how easy it is to get the money back if possible. See Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 25.</p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, if the rabbi is an expert and the petitioner accepted him as their decisor in this matter then the rabbi is exempt since he unintentionally only indirectly caused the damage, but if only one of those two conditions applies (eg. the rabbi isn't such an expert) then the rabbi is obligated to pay back damages.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>I'll approach this theoretically. There are two views on a Rabbi's Psak in Issurim (but similar in other fields inc. Mamonos and Nefoshos):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The Rabbi reveals the existing truth</strong>: an object already possesses certain qualities (Kosher or Mutar) and the Rabbi tries to logically infer those qualities from his Torah knowledge. In the result, he might \"guess\" right or wrong (50/50) and if he's wrong we attribute it to his \"lack\" of the knowledge of Torah, like he was unable to reveal the truth.</p>\n\n<p>In such case, if it turns out he was wrong (by a greater(?) Rabbi or if he admits it himself) we can \"accuse\" him in this \"wrongdoing\" and \"demand\" repay. (<em>I use \"\" extensively to stress that those words must be taken with caution</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Rabbi sets the truth</strong>: an object's qualities are undetermined (even in Heaven, this the double slit experiment) until a Rabbi (an observer) examines it and SETS the quality. </p>\n\n<p>As a Rabbi possesses some Ruach Hakodesh (in addition to his Torah Knowledge) we presume (de-jure) that G-d agreed with him (נצחוני בניי, לא בשמים היא). In such a case, even if the Rabbi admitted that he was wrong, we consider it \"G-d's will\".</p>\n\n<p>In this case, of course, there could not be a \"wrong Psak\", any Psak is de-jure right.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The existing Halachos (from the Gemmorah till the Achronim) try to balance between those two approaches, some leaning toward the first, and some toward the second.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Judah said: such a case once occurred, and when the man had completed [his naziriteships], he died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Ovadia MiBartenura explains that R' Yehuda is telling this story to prove R' Yehuda Hanasi wrong about one  of his opinions in a previous Mishna, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Nazir.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nazir 1:4</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֲרֵינִי נָזִיר כִּשְׂעַר רֹאשִׁי, וְכַעֲפַר הָאָרֶץ, וּכְחוֹל הַיָּם, הֲרֵי זֶה נְזִיר עוֹלָם וּמְגַלֵּחַ אַחַת לִשְׁלשִׁים יוֹם. רַבִּי אוֹמֵר, אֵין זֶה מְגַלֵּחַ אַחַת לִשְׁלשִׁים יוֹם. וְאֵיזֶהוּ שֶׁמְּגַלֵּחַ אַחַת לִשְׁלשִׁים יוֹם, הָאוֹמֵר הֲרֵי עָלַי נְזִירוּת כִּשְׂעַר רֹאשִׁי, וְכַעֲפַר הָאָרֶץ, וּכְחוֹל הַיָּם:</p>\n<p>[If one says,] “Behold, I am a nazirite as the hairs of my head”, or “As the dust of the earth”, or “As the sands of the sea,” he becomes a life-nazirite, and shaves his head every thirty days. Rabbi (R' Yehuda Hanasi) says: this one does not shave his head every thirty days. The one who shave his head every thirty days is the one who says, “Behold, upon me are naziriteships as the hair on my head”, or “As the dust of the earth”, or “As the sands of the sea.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Yehuda Hanasi is saying that when one says that he will be a nazir forever, it is one long naziriteship, and he will only be allowed to shave once every twelve months. The Tanna Kama says that when one says that he will be a nazir forever, it is an infinite number of consecutive standard naziriteships. Because a standard naziriteship lasts for thirty days, the nazir may shave once a month.</p>\n<p>In Nazir 1:7, the Tanna Kama says that one who says he will be a nazir like the days of the year will have consecutive standard naziriteships equal to the number of days in a solar year, or 365, and can shave once a month. R' Yehuda Hanasi would argue that it is one long naziriteship, and therefore he will be a nazir for life, and can shave once a year. R' Yehuda disproves this by telling of a man who had made such a promise, spent 365 months as a nazir, completed his naziriteship, and died.</p>\n<p>The Mishna doesn't waste words. The nazir completing his naziriteship is enough to disprove R' Yehuda Hanasi, who would say that the nazir never completes his naziriteship.

If so, that's an additional refutation of R' Yehuda Hanasi's opinion.  If the nazir knew <em>in advance</em> that he'd be able to finish his nezirus and therefore pushed himself to stay alive, as opposed to just receiving a psak on the spot, that indicates that the accepted ruling was well known not to be like R' Yehuda Hanasi.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Nazir.1.7?lang=bi&p2=Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Nazir.1.7.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> infers and answers your question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מונה נזירות כמנין ימות השנה.</strong> שס״ה נזירות כמנין ימות החמה:,אמר רבי יהודה מעשה היה כיון שהשלים מת. ר׳ יהודה שמעיה לרבי דאפליג אתנא קמא ואמר שהאומר הריני נזיר כמנין ימות החמה הוי נזיר עולם. והביא מעשה להוכיח שאינו נזיר עולם, דמעשה היה וכיון שהשלים מת, <strong>ובנזיר עולם לא שייך השלמה</strong>, אלא ודאי מונה נזיריות. וכן הלכה:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fact that this Nazir died (some time) after completing his 365 30-day Nazir cycles, is Rabbi Yehuda's proof.</p>\n\n<p>If he were an <em>eternal Nazir</em> he wouldn't be able to <strong>complete</strong> his cycles before he dies, since he'd be a Nazir until the moment he dies.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The mishnah might have been making a connection to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.5.21-24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chanoch</a>, who lived 365 years and then died.

It would be the only 1cs verb used in this entire passage. Everything else in this section is in the 3rd person. Why the random 1cs switch this one time? The translation I have is from Daniel Machiela, who translates it as 3rd person \"he found...\".

(Kitzur S''A, 80:63)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why does the Kitzur forbid this if the Mishnah does not? We see somewhat of a linear pattern here: first, the Mishnah permits this action. Next, the Shulchan Aruch does not forbid it, but advises against it. And finally, the Kitzur forbids it entirely.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, from a D’Oraisa level, writing in things that do not last is permitted, but later the Rabbis forbade it to keep people from coming to violate the Melacha of Kotaiv.</p>\n<p>I can see two potential problems with writing in sand on Shabbos, one being an issue with Kotaiv and the other being Choresh.

As the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.340.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishna Brurah explains (340:18):</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש ליזהר - ר\"ל אף דחיוב חטאת ליכא דבעינן שיכתוב דוקא בדיו או בשאר דבר כיוצא בזה שרישומו מתקיים וכדלקמיה אפ\"ה מדרבנן אסור אף באינו מתקיים</p>\n  \n  <p>...even though there is no obligation to bring a sacrifice, because\n  for that it would need to be written in a manner which will endure,\n  nevertheless it is rabbinically forbidden even when written in a manner which will not endure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If I obey a mitzvah only publicly is it \"worth\" less because it shows that I am driven by man's opinion more than God's? What if I perform it in public and in private but only out of respect for another person's sensibilities and not because Hashem commanded it - would the \"reward\" be any different? Could there be a difference even in whether someone is yotzei through his performance if the motivation is not driven by Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishnah (Avos 5) teaches: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בֶּן הֵא הֵא אוֹמֵר, לְפוּם צַעֲרָא אַגְרָא</p>\n  \n  <p>Ben He He said: According to the labor is the reward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most commentaries understand this as applying to all mitzvot; the more difficult it is to perform the mitzvah, the greater the reward. I think it follows that, all things being equal, a mitzvah performed in public and which gives the performer some measure of honor will be inferior in this respect when compared with a mitzvah performed privately which doesn't bring with it the added benefit of fame and glory. And the same will be true for any ulterior motive which makes it easier to perform a mitzvah. This really depends more on the motivation in each individual case and less on external factors like public or private. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, a mitzvah done for no ulterior motive carries with it <strong>an additional mitzvah</strong> <strong>of Kiddush Hashem</strong>. As <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.5.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maimonides writes (M.T.

    "content": "# Why was the calendar not arranged so that Yom Kippur never falls on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Our Sources give the impression that Shabbat is the holiest of the <em>yamim tovim</em>.  On Shabbat, we rest, eat and drink of the best, sleep, rejoice, have sex with the spouse, wear nice clothes, etc.  It trumps many other things, such as mourning.  </p>\n\n<p>But Shabbat does not trump Yom Kippur.  Yom Kippur frequently falls on Shabbat, and does not allow most things mentioned above.  </p>\n\n<p>I know the Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.26b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[Taanit 26b]</a> says that the two most joyous days are Yom Kippur and Tu b'Av, but I have the impression many Jews do not feel that way.

To my mind, the Rabbis would not have wanted to set up the calendar in such a way that would lead to this ridiculous-seeming outcome.</p>\n\n<p>As noted by @DonielF in a comment, there is precedent for this line of thinking in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.8b.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arachin 8b-9a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב הונא לא נראה לחכמים לעבר יתר על שמונה מאי שנא תשעה דלא אם כן קדים אתי סיהרא תלתא יומי</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Huna says: It did not seem appropriate to the Sages to extend more than eight months in a year [and establish them as full, thirty-day months].</p>\n  \n  <p>What is different about nine months [in that the Sages did not deem it appropriate to establish that many full months in one year]? If so [i.e. if there were that many full months] then the new moon [of Tishrei] would arrive three days before [Rosh HaShana].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קדים [אתי] סיהרא - חדתא ג' ימים קודם ראש השנה שהמולד ביום ד' וראש השנה בשבת <strong>ומרנני עלמא בתר רבנן למימר כל מה דבעו עבדי</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The new moon would arrive three days before Rosh HaShana because the <em>molad</em> will fall on Wedenesday but Rosh HaShana would only fall on Shabbat, <strong>and people will mock the Rabbis, saying that they do what they want</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Yom Kippur is described in Vayikra <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.26-32?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">23</a> as a kind of Shabbat, a \"Shabbat Shabbaton\", as it is written: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַ֡ךְ בֶּעָשׂ֣וֹר לַחֹדֶשׁ֩ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֨י הַזֶּ֜ה י֧וֹם הַכִּפֻּרִ֣ים ה֗וּא ...<br>\n  שַׁבַּ֨ת שַׁבָּת֥וֹן הוּא֙ לָכֶ֔ם וְעִנִּיתֶ֖ם אֶת־נַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶ֑ם בְּתִשְׁעָ֤ה לַחֹ֙דֶשׁ֙ בָּעֶ֔רֶב מֵעֶ֣רֶב עַד־עֶ֔רֶב תִּשְׁבְּת֖וּ שַׁבַּתְּכֶֽם׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>Mark, the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement... It shall be a sabbath of complete rest for you, and you shall practice self-denial; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall observe this your Sabbath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As such, it would stand to reason that, as a kind of very special Shabbat in and of itself, there is no incompatibility between the two holidays.

    "content": "# Why not wear tefillin on Yom Tov according to Rabbi Akiva?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (menachos 36:) quotes an argument why we don’t wear tefillin on shabbos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דתניא (שמות יג, י) ושמרת את החוקה הזאת למועדה מימים ימימה ימים ולא לילות מימים ולא כל ימים פרט לשבתות וימים טובים דברי רבי יוסי הגלילי ר\"ע אומר לא נאמר חוקה זו אלא לפסח בלבד\n  As it is taught in a baraita with regard to the end of the passage of the Torah that discusses both the mitzvot of the Paschal offering and phylacteries: “And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [miyamim] to year” (Exodus 13:10). This indicates that these mitzvot apply during the days [yamim] but not during the nights. Furthermore, the letter mem, meaning from, in the term: “From year [miyamim],” teaches: These mitzvot apply on some days, but not on all days. This excludes Shabbatot and Festivals, on which phylacteries are not worn. This is the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says: This verse, mentioning an ordinance, is stated only with regard to the Paschal offering, and it is not referring to phylacteries at all. Evidently, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says that at night one is exempt from the obligation of donning phylacteries, says that on Shabbat one is exempt as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>נפקא ליה מהיכא דנפקא ליה לר' עקיבא דתניא ר' עקיבא אומר יכול יניח אדם תפילין בשבתות ובימים טובים ת\"ל (שמות יג, טז) והיה לאות על ידך ולטוטפת בין עיניך מי שצריכין אות יצאו שבתות וימים טובים שהן גופן אות\nThe Gemara answers: Rabba bar Rav Huna derives the exemption from the obligation to don phylacteries on Shabbat from a different source, the source where Rabbi Akiva derives it from, as it is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Akiva says: One might have thought that a person should don phylacteries on Shabbatot and Festivals. To counter this, the verse states: “And it shall be for a sign for you on your arm, and for a remembrance between your eyes, so that God’s law shall be in your mouth; for with a strong arm God brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:9). This teaches that the obligation to don phylacteries applies when the Jewish people require a sign to assert their status as God’s nation, i.e., during the week. This serves to exclude Shabbatot and Festivals, as they themselves are signs of the Jewish people’s status as God’s nation and a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. Consequently, no further sign is required on these days.</p>\n\n<p>I understand Rabbi Akiva for shabbos, because it says “כי אות היא”. But where do we see that Yom Tov is called an אות that Rabbi Akiva is osser tefillin on Yom Tov? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.31.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch HaShulchan Orach Chayyim 31:3</a> has a summary of various explanations of the sign.</p>\n\n<p>According to Rashi, Rif and Or Zarua', <em>shabbat</em> itself is the sign (as you noted).

The rationale in the <em>mishna</em> is that the carrier has an obligation to use the <em>lulav</em> and therefore is permitted to take it with him in that pursuit. </p>\n\n<p>Ra'av clarifies that this permission only extends as long as the person hasn't discharged the <em>mitzva</em> of picking up [and shaking] the <em>lulav</em> and is on the way to doing so when moving it around outside. Since the required activity is picking it up, he justifies the possibility of pick it up <em>without</em> fulfilling the <em>mitzva</em> by holding it upside down.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משכחת ליה כגון שהפכו, שכל המצות כולן אין אדם יוצא בהן אלא דרך גדילתן שנאמר (שמות כו) עצי שטים עומדים, שעומדים דרך גדילתן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he is alluding to the opinion of Abaye quoted in the <em>g'mara</em> which says that <em>all mitzvos</em> must be performed using objects in the \"manner\" in which they grew.

Yaakov Ettlinger</a>). Although the case discussed is of a man claiming to be Elijah the Prophet, and seducing a woman by telling her that she will become the mother of the Messiah. </p>\n\n<p>To quote sefaria's translation of the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Not long ago, an incident came before me that will cause the ears of all who hear it to ring. In one of the villages in my domain live two Jews who regularly take business trips extending several days, leaving their wives alone in the house with their sons and daughters and servants. One day, when one of the men went as was his way on a business trip, another man came from Poland, with torn clothes, and asked the wife for a place to lodge. The woman, who had always been exceedingly modest but whose piety was her folly, took pity on him and gave him a place to sleep and also food and drink. Yet that guest did not eat from her anything that had been alive, and drank nothing but water, and engaged in similar ascetic practices, afflicting himself with mortifications. All day he sat shut in his room with a book in hand, and also each night until midnight, upon which he would grieve over the destruction of God’s Temple. When he slept, he did not lie on a bed or bench, but rather on the ground, with rocks beneath his head. Each day he would immerse himself in the cold waters of the river twice, at the chilliest times. He behaved this way in the woman’s house from Sunday of Parashat Terumah until Shabbat of Parashat Tetzaveh.</p>\n  \n  <p>But on Friday night, after the meal was over, the children and the house servants all left the table and went to sleep in the other room while that fraudulent man remained seated at the table, alone with the woman. He entered into conversation with her to the point that she asked “Who are you? Where do you come from? Where are you going?” He replied “I am an emissary of the Merciful One, and my name is Eliyahu the Prophet. I seek my brethren, to gather them from the four corners of the earth—but this can be told only to the discreet.” The woman, in her great foolishness believed him. She went to sleep on her bed in the adjacent room, while that menace still sat at his place. He studied a book until midnight, and after midnight he arose, tiptoed over to the bed where the woman was lying, woke her up from her sleep, and said to her: Behold I have travelled from one end of the earth to the other, and I have found no righteous woman to compare to you who is worth to produce the Messiah. The obstacle is your husband, who is not suitable for such. To that end, I have been sent from heaven to sleep with you, and in nine months you will bear a son who will be the Messiah, son of David. He will redeem Israel. This is your sign that I am Eliyahu; this coming Tuesday, after I take leave of you, if you open the door to the closet that stands here in your bedroom, you will find there a great treasure of 400 golden ducats—but only on condition that you do not open the closet before the prescribed time. Thus spoke the adulterer to her, until he seduced her. He defiled her twice, on Friday night and Saturday night, and on Sunday before dawn the adulterer fled from there. His whereabouts are unknown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For an interesting analysis of R.

The version I grew up with was for <a href=\"https://www.egabbai.com/Docs/Oleh/ill_one2.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">cholim</a> (males) with the language including a reference to רמ\"ח איבריו ושס\"ה גידיו (the 248 <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2012/05/shema-the-three-extra-words/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bones</a> and the 365 <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/taryag/limbs/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tendons</a> (according to some).</p>\n\n<p>In many places, a separate version is said for women, including the phrase לכל איבריה ולכל גידיה (all her bones and all her tendons). In some congregations, only this broader version is used so that sick people of both genders can be listed together.</p>\n\n<p>If the version for a woman would also be relevant to a man (\"All\" would include the 248/365 combination) why do some congregations continue to have two separate prayers? Is there a particular value to keeping the men and women separate in prayer? Is there something lesser about the general construction that we want to avoid by using the more specific one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bekhorot.45a.17?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechorot 45a</a>, the number of limbs for a woman is a bit more than 248 (either 252 or 253). Therefore, using the 'standard' formulation of saying '248 limbs' would not work for females. Additionally, since there seems to be disputes between different works as to the 'correct' number of limbs for a woman (besides for the dispute in Bechorot, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.5.18?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Kitzur_Baal_Haturim_on_Numbers.5.18.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ba'al Haturim on Bamidbar 5:18</a> quoted in the OU article mentioned in the question does seem to imply that the number is 248), the simplest thing would be to 'genericize' the text when making a Mi Shebeirach for women.</p>\n\n<p>As to why it matters if the number said during the Mi Shebeirach is mistaken: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.21.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.21.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Devarim 21:1</a> mentions an idea that an 'inaccurate' prayer is 'inaffective'. While it's unclear why that should make a difference (after all, Hashem knows what we intend), the implications from that Rashi are twofold: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ideally, one should be as exact with their Tefillos as possible (this is implied by the fact that Bnei Yisrael wanted to give an exact prayer, but due to extenuating circumstances, had to give a generic prayer).</li>\n<li>If one cannot be exact, it is better to fall back to a more 'generic' version of a prayer than to possibly give an innacurate one (as is seen by the fact that Bnei Yisrael felt that they had to do a generic prayer).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Based on those two points, since a Mi Shebeirach can be said for men with a more specific formulation, we try to do that, while women have to be given a 'generic' formulation since we are unable to do anything more specific.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is meant by \"congregational honor\" regarding disallowing women reading the Torah publically?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud Bavli (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.23a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 23a</a>) says that while, if a woman read from the Torah it counts towards the required 7 <em>aliyot</em>, the <em>chachamim</em> disallowed it because of <em>kavod hatzibbur</em> - the respect for the congregation.</p>\n\n<p>What is this <em>kavod hatzibbur</em>? Is it a concern of men seeing women during prayers, or that mean will be distracted by viewing a woman on the men's side? We already use a <em>mechitza</em> for that concern. Also, that concern seems to be more of an \"individual\" concern, not a tzibbur concern.</p>\n\n<p>I've read that public Torah reading is an obligation only for the tzibbur. I.e., when there is a tzibbur - i.e. a minyan - the Torah must be read publicly. So, it seems that having a woman read the Torah is considered disrespectful in some way to the congregation meaning the group unit. What exactly is disrespectful, here? What's the concern?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/shiur-06-public-torah-reading-women\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> offers an interesting interpretation of the concern. Excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Ben-Zion Uziel understands the expression “kevod ha-tzibbur” in a\n  different manner. In the course of a discussion of the right of women\n  to vote in elections and to be elected into office, Rav Uziel rejects\n  the assertion that the mixed seating of men and women in government\n  offices constitutes immodest behavior (Mishpetei Uziel, IV, Choshen\n  Mishpat, no. 6). Among other sources, he mentions our passage.\n  According to him, Chazal did not forbid calling women to the Torah\n  because of immodesty, but only because of kevod ha-tzibbur. From this\n  Rav Uziel concludes that when people assemble for a serious purpose,\n  there is no concern about immodesty, even if the participants include\n  both men and women.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Rav Uziel, the prohibition against women reading from the\n  Torah is not connected to the issue of modesty. Why then did Chazal\n  forbid them to be called to read from the Torah?  He answers: “So that\n  people not say that there is nobody among the men who knows how to\n  read from the Torah.” This explanation is based on the practice that\n  was current in the days of Chazal, that each person called to the\n  Torah would read his portion out loud. Were women to be called to the\n  Torah and read from it, the impression would be created that the men\n  are incapable of doing so, and therefore they require the assistance\n  of the women. </p>\n  \n  <p>Chazal apparently based their concerns on the simple assumption that\n  it is men who regularly participate in communal prayer services. It is\n  men who are obligated in communal prayer, and it is men who can form\n  the required quorum. Even had Chazal not barred women from active\n  participation in public Torah reading, it may be assumed that most of\n  the Torah readers would have been men, as it is they who go more often\n  to synagogue, and it is they who are required for a quorum.\n  Furthermore, according to many authorities, the majority of the\n  readers must be adult males even if women and minors are included\n  (Rema, Orach Chayyim 282:3). According to most of the Posekim, as well\n  as according to accepted practice, women are not obligated to\n  participate in public Torah reading, and therefore nobody would expect\n  them to acquire the necessary expertise; this obligation is cast upon\n  men. In such circumstances, were women to be called to the Torah, it\n  would give the impression that the men – who are obligated to conduct\n  the Torah reading and to hear it – are not fit to do this. When the\n  men of a community are perceived as negligent in fulfilling their\n  religious duties, this is a stain on the community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article offers various angles on this issue. I have viewed some other articles on this topic, and, this is just one take - the one I feel is the most substantive and \"intelligent\". There is a separate paper that discusses whether <em>kavod hatzibbur</em> may be waived by the congregation regarding women reading Torah. There seems to be varying opinions. When, I can, I will update this answer with a link or two to the various articles.</p>\n\n\n",

The preparation of matcha starts several weeks before harvest\n  and may last up to 20 days, when the tea bushes are covered to prevent\n  direct sunlight.[5][better source needed] This slows down growth,\n  stimulates an increase in chlorophyll levels, turns the leaves a\n  darker shade of green, and causes the production of amino acids, in\n  particular theanine. Only the finest tea buds are hand-picked. After\n  harvesting, if the leaves are rolled up before drying as in the\n  production of sencha, the result will be gyokuro (jade dew) tea. If\n  the leaves are laid out flat to dry, however, they will crumble\n  somewhat and become known as tencha (碾茶). Then, tencha may be\n  de-veined, de-stemmed, and stone-ground to the fine, bright green,\n  talc-like powder known as matcha.[6][7] </p>\n  \n  <p>Grinding the leaves is a slow process, because the mill stones must\n  not get too warm, lest the aroma of the leaves is altered. It may take\n  up to one hour to grind 30 grams of matcha [8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on this explanation, the production process involves grinding the tea leaves between millstones. Thus, if these millstones were used only for grinding tea and other similar natural products, and there are no other flavorings added to the tea (e.g., it's loose matcha powder), it seems that it would fit the rules mentioned in the OK article.

However it would seem to me that this does not solve the God-as-informer problem. If the veracity of the lots is assumed because the outcome is guided by God then God is essentially still an informant (albeit without explicitly 'saying' who did it). If the outcome is pure chance then Achan's retort is correct and the lots are random and have no true meaning.</p>\n<p>How can we understand why the use of lots does not constitute God being an informant?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This is an excellent question, and is asked in many places such as <a href=\"http://www.levladaat.org/data/upl/tihon/shmuel4.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=39684\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://mikyab.net/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%99%E2%80%8E/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pri_Tzadik%2C_Shushan_Purim.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, and many other places.  By far the best set of answers are found in the second link above, from Daf-yomi.com, with my rough summary below:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א. דבר ה' ליהושע היה בגילוי נבואה, והיא מדרגה עליונה של דבקות בקדושה. רק על גילוי נבואה נאמר שאין בו פחיתות ערך של דילטורין. אבל באופנים אחרים – כשם שה' מַגְבִּיהִי לָשָׁבֶת (תהלים קיג, ה) כך הוא גם מַשְׁפִּילִי לִרְאוֹת (שם ו).‏</p>\n  \n  <p>ב. אמרו במסכת סנהדרין דף מג ע\"ב:\n  \"אמר לפניו: רבונו של עולם, מי חטא? אמר ליה: וכי דילטור אני? לך הפל גורלות. הלך והפיל גורלות, ונפל הגורל על עכן, אמר לו: יהושע, בגורל אתה בא עלי?! אתה ואלעזר הכהן שני גדולי הדור אתם, אם אני מפיל עליכם גורל - על אחד מכם הוא נופל. אמר לו: בבקשה ממך... מיד: ויען עכן את יהושע ויאמר אמנה אנכי חטאתי לה' אלהי ישראל וכזאת וכזאת עשיתי\".\n  כפי שטען עכן, גם בגורל אין בכדי להוכיח ולהצביע על החוטא. תועלת הגורל היתה בכך שהוא שגרם לעכן להודות בעצמו על חטאו.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>ג. דילטור הוא ההולך רכיל, כפירוש רש\"י, ודרך לשון הרע להאמר בלחש ככתוב בקהלת י, יא: אִם יִשֹּׁךְ הַנָּחָשׁ בְּלוֹא לָחַשׁ וְאֵין יִתְרוֹן לְבַעַל הַלָּשׁוֹן. וכוונת ה' היתה שאין מן הראוי שיאשים יהושע את עכן בטענה כי מה' נלחש לו מאחורי גבו. ואילו עדות הגורל היא בפני עיני הכל.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Answer 1 - there is a difference between being a slanderer through Nevuah, a very holy method of communication between man and G-d. Only through this method would there be an issue of telling Lashon Hara, but not through a more natural method of communicating, such as a lottery.</p>\n\n<p>Answer 2 - Indeed, Achan is correct in noting that a lottery does not conclusively prove anything. However, the purpose of the lottery was to put him in the spotlight and cause him to admit. (See <a href=\"https://www.google.ca/search?client=opera&q=on%20the%20head%20of%20the%20theif%2C%20the%20hat%20burns&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> as well.) Indeed, Yehoshua even asks him to admit, which is emphasized by the very Gemara you are asking about.</p>\n\n<p>Answer 3 - We see indications from many places that it is inappropriate to convict people from informers, who secretly tell Lashon Hara about people behind their backs. Therefore, here, Hashem desired that the lottery be done in front of the entire nation, to avoid being a private informer (this may work well with the language of the Gemara \"וכי דילטור אני <strong>לך</strong>\"?)</p>\n\n\n",

The <em>kohein gadol</em> confesses his and his house's sins on the bull that is offered; in addition, there is a goat that is offered (without additional confession) and one that he confesses the people's sins on and then it's sent into the wilderness.  In all other cases that I'm aware of, when we seek atonement we do it through an animal that is carefully slaughtered, not one that's sent out to an uncertain (but almost certainly messier) fate.  And the torah could have had us confess over the goat that's offered (or include the people in the confession over the bull), but it didn't.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a deeper meaning to the Azazel goat?  It seems to introduce an element of <em>uncertainty</em> about our atonement -- you send this randomly-chosen goat out and who knows what happens? -- except that the mishna in Yoma describes binding it with a red cord (4:2) and later watching for (half of) that cord to turn white, so they do get an answer.  Given that there are other atonement offerings too on Yom Kippur, how should we understand the Azazel goat?  I am left wondering whether, like at the Pesach seder, we are instructed to do this in an unusual way in order to prompt questions and study.  But all of this is speculation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>In Guide for the Perplexed 3:46 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The goat [of the Day of Atonement] that was sent [into the wilderness] (Lev. xvi. 20, seq.) served as an atonement for all serious transgressions more than any other sin-offering of the congregation. As it thus seemed to carry off all sins, it was not accepted as an ordinary sacrifice to be slaughtered, burnt, or even brought near the Sanctuary; it was removed as far as possible, and sent forth into a waste, uncultivated, uninhabited land. There is no doubt that sins cannot be carried like a burden, and taken off the shoulder of one being to be laid on that of another being. But these ceremonies are of a symbolic character, and serve to impress men with a certain idea, and to induce them to repent; as if to say, we have freed ourselves of our previous deeds, have cast them behind our backs, and removed them from us as far as possible.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp182.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Emunot V'Deiot 3:10 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

Similarly <em>Jabneel</em> (Josh. 15:11), <em>Irpeel</em> (<em>ibid</em>. 18:27), and <em>Jeruel</em> (II Chron. 20:16) were all of them localities.</p>\n<p>Now one of the two heads [of cattle] was offered up by the <em>priests</em> in the sanctuary in view of the fact that most of their sins were committed in the sanctuary. The other, again, was offered up by the <em>nation</em> outside of the sanctuary because most of their sins were committed outside of it, preference being thereby shown to the priests. As for the casting of the lots, which was, as it were, the most objectionable feature of the whole affair, let me explain that that was not due to any variation in the recipient of the sacrifice, for both were offered up to the same Master. Lots were cast only on account of the difference in the persons in whose behalf the sacrifices were offered; namely, that they were offered for <em>priests and Israelites</em>. It was, therefore, necessary to throw lots first, so that whatever fell to each one's share might be offered up in his behalf with the assurance that it belonged to him.</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation p. 178)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Sefer HaChinuch explains (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.95.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§95</a>) that the two goats of Yom Kippur are symbolic for the choice presented to a sinner – the goat for Hashem representing one who repents, and the goat for Azazel representing one who doesn’t. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובקרבן עזאזל שנשלח חי אל מקום החרבן והכליון נאמר בפשט הענין לבל ידמה החוטא הגמור שאחר שתקבל נפשו ענש על חטאים, התשוב לעמוד במקום הטובים או תהיה לה השארות וטובה קצת ואפילו תהיה כירבעם בן נבט וחבריו, כמו שהוא רואה כל השנה כלה שיש לגוף הבהמה שהוא לדמיון גוף החוטא השארות קצת בית השם יתברך באפר שנשאר שם בעת השרפה לא יוציאוהו מן הבית עד אחר זמן הרבה. על כן בשעיר החי הנושא כל העונות יראו רמז כי החוטא שעונותיו מרבים כמו האפקורוסין ושכפרו בתורה ובתחית המתים וכל המצרים לישראל בכלל, לא יראו בטובה לעולם ותולעתם לא תמות ואשם לא תכבה, כמעשה השעיר בנשאו רבוי עונות כל ישראל ישלך לגמרי אל ארץ גזרה, לא ימצא בבית יי לא לשחיטה ולא לזריקה, זכרו יאבד מני ארץ. וזהו שאמרו זכרונם לברכה (ירושלמי יומא פ''ו ה''ג) כי בשעה שישראל מרצין, לא הגיע לחצי ההר עד שנעשה אברים אברים, להודיען דמיון החוטא הגמור כי כן יאבד מהרה ויהיה כלה כליון גמור, למען ילמדו ויקחו מוסר וייטיבו דרכיהם. וזהו הסימן הטוב להם, שאין מלמד מוסר אלא האוהב, כמו שכתוב (משלי יג כד) ואהבו שחרו מוסר.</p>\n  \n  <p>And about the sacrifice of Azazel that would be sent alive to a place of destruction and of extinction, we will say about the simple understanding of the matter [as follows]: The complete sinner should not imagine that after his soul receive the punishment for [the] sins, it will return to stand in the place of the good or [that] there will be some survival and good - even if he is like Yerovam the son of Nevat and his colleagues - just like he sees the whole entire year that the body of the animal that is an illustration for the body of the sinner has some remnants in the House of God, may He be blessed, in the ashes that stay there at the time of the burning. [As] they do not take them out from the Temple until after much time. Therefore in [this] living goat that carries all of the sins, they will see a hint that a sinner whose sins are great - like the heretics and those that deny Torah or the revival of the dead, and all of those that oppose Israel are included [as well] - will never see any good, and 'their worm will never die and their fire will never be extinguished.' [It is] like the procedure of this goat - [that] in his carrying the multitude of sins of all of Israel, is sent completely to a desolate land. He is not found in the House of God, not for slaughter and not for sprinkling - 'its memory will be lost from the earth.' And this is [the meaning of] what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Talmud Yerushalmi Yoma 6:3) that at the time that Israel was accepted, [the goat] would not reach halfway [down] the mountain before it would become [detached,] limb [from] limb - to show them the illustration of a compete sinner. As so will he be quickly destroyed, and he will be entirely, completely destroyed. [This is] in order that they would learn and [understand] the lesson and improve their ways.

Ezra Bick.</p>\n\n<p>Some key quotes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Ramban begins by explaining that <em>azazel</em> refers to some sort of evil power (as opposed to the explanation of Rashi that it means a \"hard and rocky place\"). He first cites the Ibn Ezra, who hints that the explanation of <em>azazel</em> is found at the end of thirty-three. The Ramban, who, as we know, believes in not disclosing secrets, nevertheless here feels free to explain the Ibn Ezra, since, as he states, Chazal have already done so in several places. The reference of the Ibn Ezra is, as R. Chavel explains in a footnote, to the thirty-third verse following the present one, which is \"and they shall no longer offer their sacrifices to the demons…\" (17,7). The Ramban then cites Bereishit Rabba which associates the <em>sa'ir hamishtalei'ach</em> (the \"sent goat\") with Eisav (\"<em>ish sa'ir</em>\" – a hairy man). The Ramban, of course, understands this not as the historical figure of the brother of Yaacov, but as the twin and opposite figure to Yisrael, the power of evil. He makes this explicit in his next quote, from Pirkei d'Rabi Eliezer, that identifies the destination of the <em>se'ir hamishtalei'ach</em> as Samael. We now have only to understand who is Samael.</p>\n  \n  <p>The quote from Pirkei D'Rabi Eliezer is as follows:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>That is why on Yom Kippur  they would give Samael a bribe to not cancel their sacrifice, as is written, \"one lot to God and one lot to <em>azazel</em>,\" the lot of God is a burnt-offering, and the lot of <em>azazel</em> is a goat of sin-offering, and all the sins of Israel are on it. Samael sees that there is no sin in them on Yom Kippur. He says to God: Master of the worlds, you have one people on earth who are like the ministering angels in heaven – just as the ministering angels are barefoot, so Israel is barefoot on Yom Kippur; just as the ministering angels neither eat nor drink, so Israel does not eat or drink on Yom Kippur, just as the ministering angels cannot bend, so Israel stands all Yom Kippur; just as the ministering angels, peace serves as an intermediary between them, so Israel, peace serves as an intermediary between them on Yom Kippur; just as the ministering angels are free of all sin, so Israel is free of all sin on Yom Kippur.</p>\n    \n    <p>God hears the testimony of Israel from their accuser and He atones for the altar, and for the Temple, and for the priests, and for all the congregation.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>It is clear from this quote that <em>azazel</em> is Samael, who is the \"accuser\" of Israel; in other words, the <em>satan</em>. The Ramban goes on to explain.</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>See, they have told his name and his actions. And this is the secret of the matter. For they used to worship other gods, who are the angels, offering them sacrifices which are for them a sweet savor (<em>rei'ach nicho'ach</em>)…. Now the Torah totally prohibited the acceptance of their divinity or any worship of them, but God commanded that on Yom Kippur we send a goat to the desert to the prince who rules in desolate places, which is appropriate as he is the master of (that place), and from the emanation of his strength comes destruction and desolation, for he is the cause of the stars of the sword and blood and wars and quarrels and wounds and plagues and division and destruction, and, in general, the soul of the sphere of Mars. And his portion among the nations is Eisav, who is the nation who inherits the sword and wars. And among the animals, (his portion is) the goat, and in his portion are also the demons who are called <em>mazikim</em> in the language of the Rabbis, and <em>se'irim</em> in the language of Scripture, for both he and his nation are called <em>se'ir</em> (= goat, demon, and another name for Edom, the land of Eisav). </p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>The intention of the <em>se'ir hamishtalei'ach</em> is not that it be an offering from us to him, God forbid, but rather that our intention should be that we are fulfilling the will of our creator who has commanded so. The parable for this is if one were to make a banquet for the master, and the master would command the one making the banquet: \"Give a portion to this particular servant of mine.\" In this case, the one who makes the banquet is not giving anything to the servant, and is not honoring him, but rather everything is given to the master, and the master is giving a reward to the servant. And he has fulfilled his master's command and has done, in his master's honor, all that he was commanded. But the master, out of concern for the giver of the banquet, wished that all his servants take part in it, so that they praise him and not belittle him.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What does the service of Yom Kippur express? The Ramban gives a parable of a feast, to which the servant is invited so that he not be left out. I think that the meaning of this is that the service of Yom Kippur works by bringing about a unity of the different powers, the different servants, as it were, of God. On Yom Kippur, the Jews are like the angels, as the <em>midrash</em> in the Pirkei d'Rabi Eliezer makes clear. We make a banquet in God's honor, and it is important that all God's servants be included, because by partaking in the banquet they all become part of the unity of Israel's service of God. We don't serve the principle of evil, God forbid; we show that we understand that even the principle of evil is subject to God and dependent on Him. That is the opposite of serving evil; it is making, or rather demonstrating, that evil is subservient to God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In the Midrash the distinction between derash and the alternative method called *peshat is not clearly defined and in parallel passages the terms are sometimes interchangeable (cf. Gen. R. 10:7 with Tanh., Ḥukkat 1). Only in the Middle Ages, probably under the influence of Rashi's Bible commentary, did derash come to be used for homiletical exposition in contrast to peshat, the literal interpretation. Derashah (Heb. דְּרָשָׁה) is the equivalent of the word \"sermon\" today.

The English phrase <em>knowledge of G-d</em> would be da'at HaShem (דעת הוי). What is implied by changing the Hebrew phrase to <em>de'ah et-HaShem</em>?</p>\n\n<p>In context of the full phrase <em>de'ah et HaShem</em>, the objective particle (<em>called in English grammar a Connective Conjunction</em>) <em>et</em> is associated to G-d, meaning that the word <em>de'ah</em> is a verb of some kind implying an action or process. It looks like it is from the verb root <em>yada</em> (ידע) meaning <em>to know</em>. But the conjugation of that verb root doesn't drop the letter Yud to this form.</p>\n\n<p>And in the context of the full sentence from Isaiah which is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לֹֽא־יָרֵ֥עוּ וְלֹֽא־יַשְׁחִ֖יתוּ בְּכָל־הַ֣ר קָדְשִׁ֑י כִּֽי־מָלְאָ֣ה הָאָ֗רֶץ דֵּעָה֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה כַּמַּ֖יִם לַיָּ֥ם מְכַסִּֽים׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It emphasizes even more that <em>future</em> negative actions will not take place as a consequence of the earth being filled with some kind of <em>future</em> process.</p>\n\n<p>What is that process and what is the verb root, proper binyan and conjugation? Meaning, is this something done by one individual, or a group of individuals?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems from the classical <em>meforshim</em> that the word דעה - <em>dei'oh</em> is to be understood as a verb in its infinitive form לדעת - <em>lo'da'as</em>, to know. The infinitive form can refer to both the individual or a group of individuals. I have quoted <em>Targum Yonoson</em> and <em>Rashi</em> (whose source in this case is the <em>Targum</em>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>תרגום יונתן</strong>:\n  ארי תתמלי ארעא למידע ית דחלתא דה' כמיא דלימא חפן</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>רש\"י</strong>:\n  דעה את ה' - לדעת את ה'  עכ\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the context of the <em>perek</em>, chapter, the <em>Malbim</em> suggests that this verse continues to refer to the animal kingdom. There will be a שינוי טבע - <em>shinui teva</em>, a change in nature, that even animals who are not equipped with human intelligence will in some way be overcome with the knowledge of G-d.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מלבי\"ם</strong>:\n  כי מלאה. יאמר במליצתו שהכרת ה' תתפשט כל כך עד שגם החיות הטורפות יכירו כי הגיע עת התיקון,\n  הגם שאין כח השכל אצלם,\n  ומדמה זה למים המכסים חפירת הים שאין מקום מעצור בפני המים שלא יכסו אותו,\n  כן גם חומר הבע\"ח הבלתי מוכן להשכלה לא יעצור בפני ידיעת ה' אשר תתפשט על כל בשר,\n  והיא מליצה על שינוי טבע הבע\"ח בדבר ה' עכ\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As pointed out in the question, because of the use of the connecting conjunction (את) in the phrase, \"דֵּעָה֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה\", it is clear that דעה is a verb. And as Rashi and others point out to the source of Rambam's quote in Isaiah, it is from the concept of דעת. The verb root would then be י-ד-ע.</p>\n\n<p>This is classified as <em>Gizrat</em> Peh-Yud, Lamed-Gronit (with the letter Ayin), which makes this a somewhat rare, double-weak verb structure with a Peh-Yud.</p>\n\n<p>The letter Heh at the end of the verb is only supportive of the object in the phrase and indicates that the object is feminine.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of the complete sentence from Isaiah and also the usage by Rambam in the Mishneh Torah which is discussing the final redemption, the phrase should be future tense, which in terms of the form of the conjugation and nekudot suggests that the Binyan is Pi'el (intensified action), 3rd person, singular, masculine. Because of the unusual double-weak root, the opening letter Yud appears to drop leaving only Dalet-Ayin (דע). It's worth noting that this particular verb form only appears once throughout all of Tanach in the Isaiah quoted.</p>\n\n<p>Considering the complete phrase brought by Rambam, the letter Heh appears to be indicating (meaning <em>somech</em> to) the <em>name</em>  of G-d (שם, which can be either masculine or feminine in Hebrew depending upon the context).</p>\n\n<p>It's worth noting that this also relates to the concept of <em>Shem</em> being feminine as used in the first word of the Shema prayer. (שמ-ע, the intention is to draw the 7 middot of Imma (intellect), represented by the large letter Ayin, into Nukvah (physical material expression within creation), <em>the feminine as daughter</em>, which is the concept of <em>Shem</em>, name.)</p>\n\n<p>When considering the actual meaning of the verb root, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36818&st=&pgnum=107\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machberet Menachem</a> in connection with the two letter root ד-ע, indicates that the root has several meanings, including the idea of uncovering or revealing (גלוי), and also actual union like in sexual intercourse, where husband (G-d is referred to as <strong>איש</strong> מלחמה in the Song of the Sea)  and wife become one flesh.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to these ideas, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36864&st=&pgnum=231\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaShorashim of Rabbi Yonah Ibn Yanach </a>quotes Sefer Otot HaRifayon and associates it to Iyov 9:5 and the concept of feeling or sensing tangibly.</p>\n\n<p>And the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44107&st=&pgnum=138\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaShorashim of the Radak</a> also brings these ideas and adds in relation to the posuk from Isaiah that it also has a connotation of how <em>He</em> is the source of this action, particularly because of the usage of את in the phrase.</p>\n\n<p>And this leads to trying to understand the concept of <em>name</em> as used here, like the name of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of <em>name</em> as used in the Torah <em>is not the actual essence of that which it refers to</em>, meaning in this case the essence of G-d (עצמות אין סוף). It is only a vessel, a tool so to speak, intended for others to connect and relate to the one, meaning the essence, associated with that name.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is discussed in chassidut and many other places with the terms עצמות ומהות in regard to the first of the ten commandments (For a discussion of the distinction between <em>atzmut</em> and <em>mahut</em> see the beginning of Sefer Dikduk HaGra regarding the different categories of verbs. One relates to space/<em>makom</em> and the other to time. In context, how G-d transcends both time and space.) which begins with <em>Anochi</em> (אנכי), which is not a name but a reference to G-d at His essence (אנכי stands for אנא נפשית כתבית יהבית, I give this ketubah freely, meaning without compulsion.) which transcends the concept of names altogether. This is sometimes called <em>Ain Sof</em> (אין סוף) in kabbalistic literature. And G-d at His essence identifies Himself to us (in His <em>ketubah</em>, the luchot) via the name used in that first commandment.</p>\n\n<p>In this context, the <em>He</em>, meaning the masculine operator of the phrase (remember the binyan of the verb is 3rd person, masculine, singular), refers to G-d at His essence.</p>\n\n<p>Through G-d manifesting the union with His name, meaning the feminine part of this phrase indicated by the ending letter Heh in דעה, which is associated to G-d's four letter name, there  is a revelation or uncovering of G-d's essence, meaning what transcends all of creation, within the world, which will be physically and materially sensed and perceived over all of His creation, like the waters of the sea cover over. <strong>This is the meaning of the words which Rambam brings in Hilchot Melachim 12:5.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is often expressed by the saying of our Sages: <em>For the sake of the unification of the Holy One, blessed be He</em> <em>and His Shechina (Divine Presence)</em>. It is also the meaning behind saying: Blessed be He and blessed be His name.</p>\n\n<p>It might seem like an outlandish idea to think that Rambam in his Mishneh Torah, a book of <em>psak halacha</em>, would be communicating such a deep, mystical and profound idea (a view expressed by Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabbai in Sefer Avodat HaKodesh), that doesn't seem to be the plain meaning at all. Until you consider what Rambam writes in his introduction to the Mishnah Torah, an introduction which was actually written after he had completed the entire work.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">section 1 of the introduction</a>, Rambam explains that the entire Torah was given to Moshe Rabbeinu at Har Sinai both the written portion found in Tanach and the entire oral Torah, meaning all explanations including the entire Talmud, every Midrash and all the Kabbalistic and Chassidic teachings (<em>Ma'aseh Merkava and Ma'aseh Bereshit</em>). Nothing was excluded.</p>\n\n<p>And then <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam goes on to explain in section 41 of his introduction</a> that he has intentionally written this entire oral Torah within his Mishnah Torah, in a very precise, refined and abbreviated language to such an extent that if read and understood correctly, no other book about the oral Torah would be necessary to anyone.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam goes even further in regard to this idea in section 42</a> to his introduction to say that his intent in writing the Mishneh Torah was that a person should first read the section of the written Torah and afterward read the corresponding section in the Mishneh Torah and from this would know the entire oral Torah and not need any other book.</p>\n\n<p><em>This also means that <strong>Rambam intended the Mishneh Torah to be read in connection with the daily and weekly portion of the Tanach</strong> and that it was composed in parallel to the weekly reading.</em></p>\n\n<p>And just like the beginning of the written Torah, parshat Bereshit, begins with the details of the beginning of Creation for example, including the concept of Adam knew Chava (<strong>אדם ידע חוה</strong>), the Mishneh Torah also deals with that same subject in Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah chapters 1 through 4 (for example see 2:9-10 and 4:9-13 which also deal with this subject of Da'at).</p>\n\n<p>And looking at the conclusion of the written Torah, which describes preparing to enter the land of Israel and establishing G-d's Kingdom through the King of the Jewish people. (Note also Devarim 34:10-12 which like the beginning of the Torah, again mentions the subject of <em>Da'at</em> (See Rashi there) and also the Yad HaChazakah, another name for the Mishneh Torah which contains 14 books (י״ד). These are the subject of the conclusion of Rambam's Mishneh Torah also.</p>\n\n<p>That like the saying of our Sages, <em>The end is wedged in the beginning and the beginning is wedged in the end.</em> And this is also alluded to in the last letter of the written Torah (ל) together with the first letter (ב) of the Torah (which is started immediately upon the conclusion of the final parsha) which totals <strong>32</strong>, a reference to the <strong>32</strong> times G-d is mentioned in the Creation (like is discussed in the introduction to Sefer Yetzirah).</p>\n\n<p>And this idea expressed by Rambam in his conclusion to the Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 12:5, that the whole of the Torah, meaning the union of both the written Torah (like the expression of the Zohar <em>2:90b:3, 3:35b:8, Tikkunei Zohar 65a:1</em> that He, meaning G-d at His essence, and the written Torah are one, דאורייתא וקדוש ברוך הוא כולא חד) and the entire oral Torah (which is compared to the Shechinah, G-ds presence in all worlds via the mitzvot, also called <em>His causations</em>, איהו וגרמוהי חד, like is found in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53706&st=&pgnum=16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 3b</a>, Sefer Eitz Chaim 42:5, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tanya%2C_Letter_of_Holiness.26.4?vhe=Tanya_-_Otsar_HaChasidim_Lubavitch&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya Igeret HaKodesh, end of 26:4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tanya%2C_Last_Thesis.4.1?vhe=Tanya_-_Otsar_HaChasidim_Lubavitch&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kuntress Acharon 4:1</a>), whose literal seal is <strong>ל״ב</strong>, meaning <strong>Heart</strong> (<em>which Rambam associates with the King of Israel, Melech HaMoshiach (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.2.5?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim end of 2:5</a>)</em>), is the ultimate purpose of Moshiach and the entire Torah.</p>\n\n<p>And this is what is expressed by The prophet Yechezkel 36:26 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְנָתַתִּ֤י לָכֶם֙ <strong>לֵ֣ב חָדָ֔שׁ</strong> וְר֥וּחַ חֲדָשָׁ֖ה אֶתֵּ֣ן בְּקִרְבְּכֶ֑ם וַהֲסִ֨רֹתִ֜י אֶת־לֵ֤ב הָאֶ֙בֶן֙ מִבְּשַׂרְכֶ֔ם <strong>וְנָתַתִּ֥י לָכֶ֖ם לֵ֥ב בָּשָֽׂר</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea behind emphasizing the connection between the very beginning of creation and the days of the Messiah is because although it looks like a complete change in the natural world, something clearly contested by some opinions in the oral Torah (See for example Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 12:2 אין בין עולם הזה לימות המשיח אלא שעבוד מלכיות בלבד), Rambam is emphasizing the view of the Gaonim that the <em>change</em> is only returning the creation to its original pristine condition. This is like is expressed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malachi 3:6</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּ֛י <strong>אֲנִ֥י יְהוָ֖ה לֹ֣א שָׁנִ֑יתִי</strong> וְאַתֶּ֥ם בְּנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב לֹ֥א כְלִיתֶֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because I am G-d, I have not changed, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

If both Nissan and Iyar were to have 30 days, Shavuos (which is fixed at 50 days after the first day of Pesach, rather than being on a specific day on the calendar, as per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.23.16-21\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayikra 23:16-21</a>) would fall out on the 5th of Sivan.

Although this is also the formulation used for Pesach and Sukkos, that is because those holidays last for several days, and so we could not say יום חירותנו or the like. But because Shavuos is only one day, we should have been able to say יום מתן תורתנו, but we do not, because we are referring to the 'general time of year' instead of the actual anniversary date, which is not always on Shavuos.

According to this opinion the nusach has always been זמן מתן תורתינו.</p>\n\n\n",

Said person recounts:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would see these boys and they seemed to be such great friends-- hanging out and helping one another, but then all of a sudden they would take out these huge books [gemaras] and would start shouting at each other “What are you talking about! That's not what that means! How does that make sense!” and this would go on for a little until they put the books away.<br>\n  Then they would laugh with one another and resume being great friends. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not 100% sure, but I think the context of this sweet story was to highlight the unique aspect of learning Torah with a chavrusa. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else heard this story that R' Schachter referenced and where it might be found?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I read this story in an essay from R.

One of the Polish non-Jews on the train later published his memoirs and included a description of what he had observed on that trip. He recognized that these young people were Jewish students. He related that while the \"big books\" were open, and they were obviously \"studying\", they were extremely belligerent towards each other; sharp, seemingly angry, and even abusive. As soon as the \"big books\" were closed, they acted towards each other as the best of friends. The non-Jew did not know what to make of the scene!</strong></p>\n<p>The Mirrer students were following the Talmudic formula for studying Torah: while learning they \"waged battle\" with each other, acting towards each other like enemies.

In the words of a western European fellow passenger who was unaware of the unique status of the scholars and Torah giants with whom he lived for two weeks on the Trans-Siberian train:</p>\n<p><em>They showed a puzzling kind of conduct all day, con-stantly arguing with each other — but in friendship! Quarreling and disputing, even in larger groups — but only verbally! Their heated disputes focused on oversized books, large bulky volumes from which the disputes seemed to originate or to end.</em></p>\n<p>As striking as this observation might seem about the manner in which the remnants of the famous European Torah centers spent their days on the trans-Siberian trains, that observer could barely appreciate the high scholastic and religious standards of his fellow travelers, who spent their days of miraculous rescue in the study of Torah. They were absorbed in trying to solve numerous problems of legal, ethical and religious character arising out of the changing conditions and the technical innovations they were encountering during this trip. These new facts had to be assessed according to the principles of Torah living. The heated debates were testimony to the depth of commitment of those individuals to the obligations and principles of Torah life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And would the Jewish boy raised ‘non Jewish’ have to convert to Judaism now or was he always considered Jewish? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to Jewish law, a person is only considered part of the Jewish people, if they were born to a Jewish woman, or they formally converted to Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Also according to Jewish law, a person who was born Jewish, but was raised secular, as a non-Jew, is still considered to be a Jew, even if he wasn't even circumcised. </p>\n\n<p>So in the hypothetical case of the OP, assuming that it was unequivocally proven that in fact they babies were switched, then the Jewish boy raised ‘non Jewish’ does NOT need to convert to Judaism, since he was he always Jewish. His \"Jewishness\" was conveyed to him by his biological mother.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the boy born from a non-Jewish woman, never had any \"Jewishness\" formally conveyed to him. The fact that he observed Jewish laws and customs is immaterial, since as a biological non-Jew, he requires a formal conversion process, which he never underwent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The gemara in Gittin 42b discusses whether a slave owned by a Cohen that has been freed, but has not been given a formal document of freedom (גט שחרור) can still eat Terumah. The gemara attempts to bring a proof that he may eat Terumah from the following <em>Mishna</em> (Yevamos 99a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כהנת שנתערב ולדה בולד שפחתה הרי אלו אוכלין בתרומה וחולקין חלק אחד על הגורן הגדילו התערובות משחררין זה את זה</p>\n<p>If the wife of a Cohen mixes up her child with her maidservants' child, the 2 children may eat Terumah, and collect a portion of Terumah (together). When they grow up they both free each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The implication is that the slave is effectively considered \"freed\" since you cannot work them since they may be Jewish, yet they were not formally freed with a גט שחרור and the <em>Mishna</em> says that they may eat Terumah.</p>\n<p>The gemara rejects this proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הכי השתא התם אם יבא אליהו ויאמר בחד מינייהו דעבד הוא קנין כספו קרינא ביה</p>\n<p>That case is different because If Eliyahu Hanavi would come and identify which one is a slave, they would indeed revert back to being in the possession of their owner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here It seems clear that even a child who was raised as Jewish, but Eliyahu Hanavi revealed that they are not, they would indeed have the status of a non-Jew.</p>\n\n\n",

However, if she has intimate relations with a Goy, then she never becomes Tamei no matter when the seed escapes from her body.

What is the relation between them?</p>\n\n<p>The most literal reading is that the first list is exempt from demay, the second and the third from both ma'aser and from not buying in the seventh year. This would be a good reason to distinguish the first case (not the second and third), but if so, what is the reason to distinguish between them?</p>\n\n<p>It could also be that they're all exempt from all of these cases (demay, ma'aser, shevi'it), but if so, why are they given in three different lists?

In Shemitta Veyovel 8:12-13 he brings the list from Shevi'it alongside the list from Ma'asrot, but I don't understand what, if any, contrast he is making.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One possible answer:</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37939&pgnum=523\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Rishona to Shevi'it 7:1</a> says that the three cases are listed separately because they have different laws.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Mishna in Demay is dealing with fruits that grow by themselves. Therefore, they are exempt from demay even if it comes from someone's garden, unless he cares about them, in which case they would be obligated. (He tries to prove this from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.6b.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 6b</a>, but really the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Demai.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Demay 1:1</a> also seems to back this interpretation.)</li>\n<li>The Mishna in Shevi'it is dealing with vegetables that can be sown, but are usually not kept, and are therefore assumed to be ownerless. But if you know they have an owner, they would be obligated in ma'aser.</li>\n<li>The Mishna in Ma'asrot identifies the different types with place names from outside of Israel (e.g. Egypt), and therefore they are assumed to have come from outside of Israel, so they are exempt whether or not they are ownerless.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the difference between Shevi'it and Ma'asrot, I used the interpretation of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Maasrot.5.8?lang=he&p2=Rash_MiShantz_on_Mishnah_Maasrot.5.8&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rash</a> (which the Mishna Rishona notes in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37940&pgnum=168\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to Ma'asrot</a>). His explanation in his commentary to Shevi'it is that the Mishna in Ma'asrot is dealing with vegetables that come from specific places such as deserts, so they are assumed to be ownerless. Therefore, even if someone says he brought them from his field, he isn't believed, and they are exempt. I find this explanation less compelling, because I don't understand why you wouldn't believe someone who says he owns them. However, an advantage of this interpretation is that it doesn't contradict the commentaries (Rambam, Bartenura) who give the reason of being ownerless in all three cases.</p>\n\n\n",

The Jewish Bible is commonly called the Tanakh, an acronym for Torah, Neviim, Ketuvim--the three divisions of the text. These divisions are different from those in Christian Bibles. Most importantly, the interpretation of the material in common with Christians differs.

What is that doing right in the middle of the list of types of promise that always null and void?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that this is similar to nidre zeruzin according to the Rashba. But the Gemara says that there is a gzera derabanan because ignoramus to validate this kind of vows in some conditions. Even for other rishonim, there is a great similarity with nidre zeruzin and this place in the order of the mishna is the place to make the discernment.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובלבד שיהא זכור בשעת הנדר אי זכור עקריה לתנאי וקיימיה לנדריה  </p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara asks: If he remembers the condition at the time of his vow, he cancels the condition and validates the vow.</p>\n  \n  <p>קשיא לי אמאי עקריה, אדרבה על דעת ראשונה הוא נודר ואין פיו ולבו שוין, <strong>והוה ליה כעין נדרי זרוזין</strong>,‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>Kashia of the Rashba on this Gemara. Contrarily!? he makes the vow knowing the condition, in consequence, his heart and his mouth are not synchronized, <strong>it's as nidre zeruzin</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>שאף על פי שפיו ולבו שוין להוציא דבר זה בשפתיו אפילו הכי, כיון שאינו נודר על דעת שיתקיים נדרו הרי הוא בטל. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Since there is no error of synchronization between his mouth and his hearth (his tongue has not forked), the fact that he makes intentionally a vow without intention to accredit it makes the vow annulled. </p>\n  \n  <p>מיהו בהא איכא לתרץ דנדרי זרוזין לא הוו, אלא במאי דאורחייהו דאינשי למימר לזרוז בעלמא [דכיון דאורחייהו דאינשי לומר כך, לזירוז בעלמא ולאו בדוקא – לפי הש\"מ], וכיון שכן הרי הוא כאילו אמר בפירוש, דלא נדר בדוקא אלא לזרוז בעלמא.‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>The leniency of nidre zeruzin is based on a known discrepancy between the heart and the mouth because there is a custom to speak as well to accelerate the aggiling. They are as if he says explicitly (it's like everyone hears it) that he wants to put pressure on his friend, nothing more.</p>\n  \n  <p>ותדע לך דהא ודאי בעלמא כל שפיו ולבו שוין להוציא דבר זה בשפתיו, אף על פי שיש בלבו בהפך זה (לית) [תיבה זו ליתיה בש\"מ] נדרו קיים, ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The principle of the leniency of Nidre Zeruzin is that the purpose of the noder is apparent. If he if he secretly intends not to fulfill his commitment, there has no halachic consequences, because he knows what he says. That's what he says knowing that he says it, that counts.  </p>\n  \n  <p>ותנאי שבלבו בטל וכדקיימא לן דדברים שבלב אינן דברים, ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>A condition that remains at a mental level has no value from the point of view of the halacha. </p>\n  \n  <p>ועוד דקיימא לן בנדרי זרוזין דלא חשבינן להו לזרוזין, אלא בענין שדרכן של בני אדם לומר כן לזרוז וכדאיתא לקמן [נדרים כד, א],‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, the Gemara (24a) says that nidre zeruzim are familiar expressions mean that you have to speed up the transaction.</p>\n  \n  <p>אלא מיהו אכתי קשיא לי מדאמרינן לעיל בסמוך (כג עמוד א), כיון דאמר כל נדר שאני עתיד לידור הרי הוא בטל, לא שמע ליה ולא אתא בהדיה, כלומר דיודע הוא שאינו נודר בדוקא, שכבר בטל מעיקרו ונדרו אינו נידר.‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>But despite everything the first question has to be because Gemara seems to say above (23a) that if his friend heard him when he stated this condition, he would not give in to pressure, so its obvious that such a vow is annulled. </p>\n  \n  <p>אלמא כל שמבטל נדריו שעתיד לידור אף על פי שזוכר תנאי ונדר סתם, נדרו בטל ותנאו קיים, ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>We learn from this Gemara that it is enough that he has canceled in advance the vows he will pronounce in the future and that, when he remembers this annulment at the moment when he makes the vow.</p>\n  \n  <p>על כן נראה לי להלכה אבל לא למעשה, <strong>דלא נאמרו דברים הללו אלא בעם הארץ דחוששין לו</strong>,‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, it seems, not for an halachic purpose (the Rashba gives an explanation, but he want not to make a psak different in case of ignoramus and in case of Talmid Chacham), that this Halacha (If he remembers the condition at the time of his vow, he cancels the condition and validates the vow) is not true from a pure halachic point of view and <strong>is analog to nidre zeruzin</strong>. But the din is stingent derabanan to view the condition as cancelled  <strong>regards ignoramus (but it is a true analog of nidre zeruzin)</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>כיון שהוא זכור תנאו ולא הזכירו בשעת נדרו שמא בטלו לתנאו,‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The ignoramus perhaps annulled his condition because he thinks that there is a need to say it again at the time of the vow. And the fact that he didn't repeat it is a sign that he annulled it.</p>\n  \n  <p>אבל במדיר את חברו, ועל אותו נדר ממש הוא מקדים ומתנה ומבטלו בפיו, שאומר כל נדר שאני עתיד להדיר לאסור לו נכסי את פלוני כדי שיעשה עמי כך וכך הרי הוא בטל.‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>But even for ignoramus, there are cases in which the condition wors. If he made a condition before the encounter with his friend  and says that the vow he would make to persuade his friend to do something with him is already annulled, this works.</p>\n  \n  <p>בכענין זה אין חוששין לו אפילו בעם הארץ,‏</p>\n  \n  <p>And in a such case, we are not afraid that an ignoramus perhaps cancels the condition</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the Ran reject the explanation of the Rashba, and understand that the Din of neder after a condition that was pronounced at Rosh Hashana is not equivalent at all to Nidre Zeruzin.This is a neder by mistake, because he forgot the condition, or totally, as Abaye holds, or even partially as Rava adds. His intent was to make a neder, not as Nidre Zeruzin</p>\n\n\n",

One should not jump to save a drowning man if he can't swim. But one should take all possible measures to do so, like calling for help or paying for it.</p></li>\n<li><p>While not saving a life (when possible) is a sin, one cannot be liable for it (Rambam ibid), because one does not do a real action.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our outlook on non-Jews is two-fold (unfortunately it is always black and white): either they are intrinsically good or bad (for us/for G-d). </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If they rebel against G-d (idolaters) or seek to harm us (Jews) physically or economically, we don't see ourselves responsible for saving them, as we don't have an obligation to save a Jew that behaves that way (see <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A8_(%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94)#%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moser</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>If they are righteous (regarding their Mitzvos) and benevolent for us (more or less the current approach in most countries), we should surely treat them accordingly. We can probably learn it from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.1085.10?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni</a>: \"אמר הקב\"ה מעשי ידי טובעים בים ואתם אומרים לפני שירה\" (G-d felt sorry when the Egyptians - our worst enemies - drowned in the Red Sea), so we can learn Kal Vachomer that G-d feel sorry losing his righteous humans.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>In any way, one should be aware and cautious not to cause Hilul Hashem in a public place (mind street cameras!), where not taking measures for saving other's life can be interpreted furiously against the Jews and the Torah and lead to harm and even endangering of other Jews.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, s<strong>aving a non-Jew in a place that values human life</strong> (currently most of the Western world), <strong>can lead to a huge Kiddush Hashem</strong> - honoring Jews for our devotion to our Torah values. Especially when contrasted by such ideological differences (saving a Nazi supporter) can have an enormous influence on public opinion and overall wellness of the Jewish community.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

On Yom Tov, however, where there is the extra בשר ויין (as well as the מאריכין בסעודה, as per the Rambam), there was no need to institute the separate <em>seuda</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(b) On Yom Tov, there is no <em>neshama yeseira</em>. (see Tosfos Beitza 33b, and Pesachim 102b). </p>\n\n<p>(c) One should have hot food on Motze Shabbos (Shabbos 119b) to show that one could not heat up food on Shabbos. On Yom Tov, this does not apply.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Leket Yosher</em> (OCH p.58) gives testimony that his Rebbi, the <em>Terumas Hadeshen</em>, did not eat <em>Melave dMalka</em> on Motzei Yom Tov.</p>\n\n\n",

I thought I was a safety freak, but the Mishnah describes that some careless Cohanim actually fell and were hurt (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Yoma.2.2?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yomah 2,2</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מעשה שהיו שניים שווים רצים ועולים בכבש, ודחף אחד מהן את חברו, ונפל ונשברה רגלו.</p>\n<p><em>It once happened that two were even as they ran up the ramp, and one of them pushed his fellow who fell and broke his leg.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, even after the incident they didn't think of adding the railings, they (the court) simply canceled the lot altogether.</p>\n<p>Please look at the two Cohanim I marked with red arrows - they endanger their lives (or at least their service as Cohanim, because a broken limb can lead to disqualification). THere's also a 50cm Hasovev around the Mizbeah about 2.5m high (notice marks ב and י\"ז)!</p>\n<p>The top of the altar is called \"גג\" - \"roof\" and the Torah has a specific and explicit double commandment/prohibition of \"making a railing for your roof\" and \"prevent personal injuries in one's house\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.22.8?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 22,8</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי תִבְנֶה בַּיִת חָדָשׁ <strong>וְעָשִׂיתָ מַעֲקֶה לְגַגֶּךָ וְלֹא־תָשִׂים דָּמִים בְּבֵיתֶךָ</strong> כִּי־יִפֹּל הַנֹּפֵל מִמֶּנּוּ׃</p>\n<p>When you build a new house, <strong>you shall make a parapet for your roof</strong>, so that you do not bring bloodguilt on your house if anyone should fall from it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(<em>My Rabbi offered a simple Tiruzt, as many Mitzvos don't hold in the Mikdash (Mezuza?), we can learn it from the Posuk says \"בביתך\" you're obligated but not in G-d's house :)</em></p>\n<p>So why didn't the Mizbeach have railings or safety guards?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Tiferes Yisrael (Middos, Chap. 3, Yachin, 8) posits that there was a quasi-מעקה on the top of the Altar.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דחוזרין ומניחין מקרנות ולפנים, אמה א' סביב בגג המזבח לצורך הילוך רגלי\n  הכהנים, והיו ב' אמות אלו שבין הקרנות ושל הילוך הכהנים <strong>משוקעים קצת\n  שלא יחליקו הכהנים ויפלו מהשפה</strong>, [ונראה לי דגם בסובב הי' מה\"ט שפתו\n  גבוה קצת סביב] ועל ידי זה היה שפה גבוה קצת לגגו של מזבח סביב, דהיינו,\n  הרוחב אמה שבין קרן לקרן סביב והרוחב אמה סביב שמיוחד להלוך רגלי הכהנים\n  סביב למזבח, רוחב ב' אמות הללו היו משוקעים קצת בגג המזבח, ועל ידי זה\n  הי' <strong>כעין מעקה סביב לגג המזבח</strong>, כדי שלא יחליקו הכהנים משם ויפלו\n  [כש\"ס זבחים ס\"ב א', וגם זה נשמט ברמב\"ם, וצריך עיון]\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Tiferes Yisrael refers to Zevachim 62a as source for this suggestion:</p>\n\n<p>תנו רבנן, איזהו כרכוב בין קרן לקרן מקום הילוך רגלי הכהנים אמה. אטו הכהנים בין קרן לקרן הוו אזלי? אלא אימא, ומקום הילוך רגלי הכהנים אמה. והכתיב (שמות לח, ד) תחת כרכובו מלמטה עד חציו? אמר רב נחמן בר יצחק, תרי [כרכוב] הוו, חד לנוי, וחד לכהנים דלא נשתרקו.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n\n<p>וחד לכהנים דלא נשתרקו - ולמעלה בראש המזבח העמיקו סובב כמין חריץ עמוק דבר מועט להיות להם שפתו היקף <strong>מעקה קטן</strong> סביב שלא יחליקו:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zevachim.62a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Translation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: There were two entities called \"karkov\".\n  One was a slight protrusion above the midway point of the altar for\n  aesthetic purposes, and one was an indentation on top of the altar for\n  the benefit of the priests, to ensure that they would not slip off the\n  top of the altar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This notion that the \"karkov\" served as a quasi-מעקה, is also mentioned by Rabbi Yosef Rosen, known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogatchover_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rogatchover Gaon</a>, in his work \"Tzofnath Paneach\" (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22194&st=&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Terumos, Chap. 1, p. 8. column 1</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועיין זבחים דף ס\"ב ע\"א גבי כרכוב לכהנים דלא משתרקי, משמע קצת דהוי זה\n  <strong>בגדר מעקה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Sifri (Ki Tetzei, 229) explicitly exempts a ramp from needing a railing:</p>\n\n<p>ועשית מעקה לגגך. אין לי אלא גג, מנין לרבות בורות שיחים ומערות [חריצים] ונעיצים, תלמוד לומר ולא תשים דמים בביתך. אם כן למה נאמר גג, פרט לכבש</p>\n\n<p>The question is, does this refer to all ramps, or only the ramp of the altar in the Temple, is the subject of debate, and is beyond the scope of this discussion. The main point is that the ramp of the altar in the Temple was certainly exempt from a railing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There could be another explanation. Rambam in Hilchos Beis Habdhira says that the Altar was not a building, but one of the tools, used in the Temple (just like the Menorah or the table). </p>\n\n<p>As such it is exempt from the railings because it is not a building to start with, like building a giant chair.</p>\n\n\n",

All that exists from heaven and earth, and that which is between them, only exists from the truth of the One Who put them out. If you would suppose that He doesn’t exist, nothing else could exist. But if you would suppose that anything which exists besides Him would not exist, He alone would still exist; He would not be nullified by their nullification, for anything which exists needs Him, but He, blessed is He, doesn’t need them or any one of them. Therefore, His truth is not like the truth of any one of them. ... This Existence is the G-d of the world, Master of the entire land. He leads the sphere with strength without end, with strength with no cessation, as the sphere constantly revolves, and it’s impossible that it revolve without One Who revolves it. He, blessed is He, is the One Who revolves it without a hand or body. <strong>Knowledge of this matter is a positive commandment, as it says, “I am Hashem, your G-d.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly he writes in Sefer Hamitzvos, Asei §1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היא הצווי אשר צונו בהאמנת האלהות, והוא שנאמין שיש שם עלה וסבה הוא פועל לכל הנמצאים, והוא אמרו אנכי ה' אלהיך. ובסוף גמרא מכות (דף כ\"ג:) אמרו תרי\"ג מצות נאמרו למשה בסיני, מאי קראה תורה צוה לנו משה, ר\"ל מנין תור\"ה. והקשו על זה ואמרו תורה בגימטריא תרי\"א הוי, והיה המענה אנכי ולא יהיה מפי הגבורה שמענום. הנה נתבאר לך שאנכי ה' מכלל תרי\"ג מצות, והוא צווי באמונת האלהות כמו שבארנו. (בפרשת וישמע יתרו, מדע הלכות יסודי התורה פ\"א): </p>\n  \n  <p>It is the commandment which we have been commanded in believing in Hashem, which is to believe that there is there a Higher Power and Cause Who creates all existence, Who said, “I am Hashem your G-d.” At the end of Makkos they said, “613 Mitzvos were said to Moshe on Sinai. What is the passuk? ‘Torah has Moshe commanded us,’” i.e. the Gematria of Torah. They ask: Torah has a Gematria of 611! And it answers: “I am Hashem your G-d” and “There should not be” they heard from Hashem. Behold, it’s explained that “I am Hashem your G-d” is included in the 613 Mitzvos, and it is belief in Hashem, as we explained. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramban on the spot, paraphrasing the BeHaG, takes issue with this Rambam:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועם כל זה ראיתי לבעל ההלכות שלא ימנה אותה מצוה מכלל תרי\"ג והתימה מהרב שמנה בדבור לא יהיה לך ד' מניעות, לא יהיה לך לא תעשה לא תשתחוה להם ולא תעבדם, אם כן יהיה מפי הגבורה חמש ומפי משה תר\"ח לא מנין תור\"ה. והנראה מדעתו של בעל ההלכות שאין מנין תרי\"ג מצות אלא גזירותיו יתעלה שגזר עלינו לעשות או מנענו שלא נעשה, אבל האמונה במציאותו יתעלה שהודיע אותה אלינו באותות ומופתים ובגילוי השכינה לעינינו הוא העיקר והשורש שממנו נולדו המצות לא ימנה בחשבונן, והוא מאמר החכמים גזור עליהם, עשו קבלת המלכות ענין בפני עצמו והמצות הנגזרות מאתו יתעלה מענין אחר,</p>\n  \n  <p>With all of this I have seen in the Ba’al Halachos that he doesn’t count this Mitzvah among the 613. The astonishment is at the [Rambam] who counts in the statement “there is not to you” four negative commandment: not to have other gods, not to make them, not to bow to them, and not to serve them. If so, five were heard from Hashem and 608 from Moshe, not the Gematria of Torah. What seems to the understanding of the Ba’al Halachos is that 613 Mitzvos is the count of His decrees which He decreed on us to do or removes us that we should not do. But belief in His exalted existence, that He made it known to us with signs, wonders, and the revelation of the Divine Presence to our eyes – that is the foundation and root from which the Mitzvos are born, and will not be counted in their tally. And this is the statement of the Chachamim, “Decree upon them” – accept the kingship as its own matter, and the Mitzvos which are decreed from His Exaltedness as another matter. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on this, the BeHaG understands that “I am Hashem your G-d” is not a commandment itself; its meaning is, “Since you accepted My kingship at leaving Mitzraim, there shouldn’t be to you other gods, etc.” To resolve the Gemara, he understands that the second statement has just two commandments: “there should not be” and “do not make” are one, and “do not bow” and “do not serve” are a second.</p>\n\n<p>As for a defense for the Rambam? It’s not unusual for him to read a passuk which doesn’t sound like a commandment to be a commandment anyway. As another example, in Ishus 1:1 he learns that Kiddushin is a Mitzvah from “When a man will take a woman” (Devarim 22:13), which doesn’t sound like a commandment – a point made explicitly by the Rosh in Kesuvos 1:12. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.25.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Hachinuch</a> counts this as Mitzvah 25.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the Mitzvah is belief in G-d.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצות האמנה במציאות השם - להאמין שיש לעולם אלה אחד, שהמציא כל הנמצא\n  ומכחו וחפצו היה כל מה שהוא ושהיה ושיהיה לעדי עד, וכי הוא הוציאנו מארץ\n  מצרים ונתן לנו את התורה. שנאמר בתחלת נתינת התורה (שמות כ ב) אנכי ה'\n  אלהיך אשר הוצאתיך מארץ מצרים וגו'. ופרושו כאלו אמר תדעו ותאמינו שיש\n  לעולם אלה, כי מלת אנכי תורה על המציאות. ואשר אמר אשר הוצאתיך וכו'\n  לומר, שלא יפתה לבבכם לקחת ענין צאתכם מעבדות מצרים ומכות המצרים דרך\n  מקרה, אלא דעו שאנכי הוא שהוצאתי אתכם בחפץ ובהשגחה, כמו שהבטיח לאבותינו\n  אברהם יצחק ויעקב. </p>\n  \n  <p>The commandment of belief in God: To believe that the world has one\n  God that caused all that exists, and that all that is, and was, and\n  will be forever and ever, is from His power and His will; and that He\n  took us out out of Egypt and gave us the Torah - as it is stated\n  (Exodus 20:2), \"I am the Lord, your God, who took you out of the land\n  of Egypt, etc.\" And its understanding is as if it said, \"Know and\n  believe that there is one God\" - since the word, \"I,\" indicates\n  existence. And that which it stated, \"who took you out, etc.,\" is to\n  say that your hearts not seduce you to take the matter of your leaving\n  the slavery of Egypt and the plagues of Egypt as the way of\n  happenstance; but rather you should know that I am the One who took\n  you out with will and providence - as He promised our forefathers,\n  Avraham, Yitschak and Yaakov.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have heard or read many explanations about \"I am the Lord your God\".</p>\n\n<p>-It is not a commandment and must not be counted as such.  If God had wanted it to be a commandment, He would have phrased it like the following commandments; something like: “You must accept (believe) that I am the Lord your God.”</p>\n\n<p>-You may believe what you want, but you may not say or preach out loud that there is no God.  Perhaps even: You <em>must</em> say or preach that God does exist.  These are actions, and you can control them.</p>\n\n<p>-It is meant as an implicit threat: “You must do the following or there will be consequences.”</p>\n\n<p>-In order to follow commandments, you must first have faith in the authority behind these commandments.</p>\n\n<p>-It does not refer to faith, or belief (emunah), but trust in a benevolent higher power that loves us and guides us.  Faith is specific, trust is diffuse.</p>\n\n<p>-Literal: Accept that I am the <em>same</em> God who took you out of Egypt, and I am back to issue commandments.  (Even if you believe there are other gods, believe at least in this continuity.)</p>\n\n<p>-Rabbi Elchanan Wasserman: The commandment is to work on ourselves to remove the obstacles that cause us to deny God's existence.</p>\n\n<p>-Any list of the 613 is subjective to some extent.  One could lump “I am the Lord Your God” and “You will have no other God before me” and make it the first commandment; and “No idolatry” the second.  They are different.  The first says, e.g., no dualism (God of good and God of evil, both invisible) and the second says no idols of wood and stone.  (Some Christians do that.)</p>\n\n<p>-The Midrash [Exodus Rabbah 29:1-9] offers the following: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>-Rabbi Tobiah ben Yitzhaq expounded: I brought you out of the land of Egypt on the condition that you acknowledge Me as your God. </p>\n  \n  <p>-[The situation] can be compared to a princess who has been taken captive by robbers, and was delivered by a king who later wished to marry her… She said: “What dowry do you give me?”\n  He replied … “I rescued you from the robbers.  That is sufficient.”</p>\n  \n  <p>-Rabbi Shim’on bar Yohai said [Pesikta d’Rav Kahana 12:5]: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: “I am God over all earth's creatures, yet I have associated My name only with you; for I am not called ‘the god of idolaters\" but \"the God of Israel’.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, there are conditions to be met.</p>\n\n<p>For example: In C\"M 263:2 he says that mitzvas asei of hashavas aveidah applies <strong>even to a dignified personality</strong> once he picks it up or moves it. Otherwise, Mr. VIP is exempt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In CM 263.2 the topic treated is the lav \"לא תוכל להתעלם\". This lav has exceptions when there is a problem of honor. \"פעמים שאתה מתעלם, זקו ואינו לפי כבודו\". The sugia is in BM 30ab. The same reason that leads us to say \"אתה מתעלם\" leads us to push out the asse of \"השב תשיבם\"</p>\n\n<p>If you have already picked up the object, there is still Mitsva \"השב תשיבם\" despite it was pushed out. Now, you must report it to the owner. This mitsva still exists but was pushed out. If you make the choice to make it by beginning to return the object to its owner you are now in duty to make it. This is the meaning of the text in Aruch Hashulchan.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara explains that it is possible to apply the \"פעמים שאתה מתעלם\", for the same reason the positive mitsva of \"השב תשיב\" is pushed out. But when he begins to take the object, he decides to make the mitsva of \"השב תשיבם\". In conclusion, when there is no \"לא תוכל להתעלם\", there is no obligation to make \"השב תשיבם\" despite that the mitsva exists. But if, regardless of any obligation he takes it, the Mitsva of \"השב תשיבם\" comes back. The explanations of the pushing out of this misva are multiple. The main is that a mitsva regarding money laws doesn't push out Isurim. So, Isurim push it out.</p>\n\n<p>The general rule of \"השב תשיבם\" is explained in 259.1. The two mitsvot are here when he identies the Aveda. That is the line of the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=14454#p=71&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ran</a> from which the Nimuke Yosef is quoted, and the Rambam. The Taz and Aruch Hashulchan follow them. Other poskim as the Sma follow the Ramban who holds that \"השב תשיבם\" begins from the time he takes the object.</p>\n\n<p>In 259.1 The Aruch Hashulchan says following the Taz quoting the Nimuke Yosef for the Pshat on Gemara 26b.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>המתין לה עד שנתיאשו הבעלים ונטלה אינו עובר אלא משום לא תוכל להתעלם בלבד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>THe pshat is that because he stands guard next to the object he has still the possibility to make the Mitsva of \"השב תשיבם\" he doesn't annul it. But when the Yeush occurs, the Mitsva disappears. But if he goes away and doesn't stands guard next to the object, he annul both \"השב תשיבם ולא תוכל להתעלם\". The proof is from the Gemara 30a quoted below with Rashi.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האי עשה - השב תשיבם  </p>\n  \n  <p>He has a positive Mitsva, Hashev Teshivem. And the question is when he doesn't take the object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>In summary:</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>for a man who has no obligation of \"לא תוכל להתעלם\" in a precise case, there is a positive mitsva of \"השב תשיבם\"but  it is pushed out, pushed out.</p></li>\n<li><p>In a special situation that regardless the lack of \"לא תוכל להתעלם\" and the pushing out of the asse, he takes the object, he makes the choice to make the asse despite the dechia. The asse comes back.</p></li>\n<li><p>For a man who has an obligation of \"לא תוכל להתעלם\", there is immediately a Mitsva of \"השב תשיבם\".</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

The Gemara there extends this to buying Sheviit produce with Maaser Sheni money, and the Rambam rules this way as well (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Second_Tithes_and_Fourth_Year's_Fruit.7.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaser Sheni 7:13</a>) since one has added the restriction of having to finish the produce before Biur Sheviit.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Maaser Sheni is taken in years 1,2 and 4,5 of the Shemitta cycle. They must be consumed by Pesach of year 4 and 7 respectively (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Maaser_Sheni.5.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaser Sheni 5:6</a>). Accordingly, during Shemitta one could only have Maaser Sheni money from a few years ago that must be consumed by Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>Biur Sheviit takes place once the Shemitta year's crop of that species is no longer available naturally in the fields (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.7.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Shemitta 7</a>). Seemingly that usually occurs towards the end of the 7th year or even into the 8th year, but not commonly before Pesach of the 7th year.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, what case is there where adding Sheviit restrictions to Maaser Sheni would end up with a greater restriction on consumption? The answer I came up with is using Maaser Sheni money taken from produce from the very beginning of the 8th year to buy leftover Sheviit produce that hasn't quite reached the time for Biur.</p>\n\n<p>But I couldn't find anyone who says that nor anyone who says the prohibition on buying Sheviit produce with Maaser Sheni money doesn't apply to old money used before Pesach of year 7. Does anyone say that or offer a different resolution?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Maybe the issue is that not that you're adding sheviit restrictions to maaser, but that you're adding <em>maaser</em> restrictions to <em>sheviit</em> produce.  The Rambam is ambiguous.  He just says חיב לבער, which could mean either biur maaser or biur sheviit.</p>\n\n<p>Note that אין מביאין קדשים לבית הפסול applies to sheviit as well, as the Rambam says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sheviit.8.7?Rambam_on_Mishnah_Sheviit.8.7.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his commentary to Sheviit 8:7</a>, which is another ambiguous case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Interesting answer, I found נר מערבי (Maaser Sheini 3:2) explains the Mishna in a similar fashion. Concerning \"old\" Maaser Sheini money, he writes the issue is adding a limit on the purchased Sheviit produce. As you have explained, Maaser Sheini needs to be consumed before Peasch of the 7th year.</p>\n<p>This explanation fits the language of the Rambam you mentioned (Maaser Sheini <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Second_Tithes_and_Fourth_Year%27s_Fruit.7.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:13</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The produce of the Sabbatical year may not be purchased with money\nfrom the second tithes, because there is an <strong>obligation to destroy it</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This obligation is thus referring to both the\nobligation to destroy produce of Sheviit (which extents into the 8th year) and the obligation to consume Maaser Sheini before Pesach of year 7.</p>\n\n\n",

Consider Bereishis Rabbah 44:17, which refers to prophecy as a type of slumber:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַב אָמַר שְׁלשָׁה תַּרְדֵּמוֹת הֵן, תַּרְדֵּמַת שֵׁנָה, וְתַרְדֵּמַת נְבוּאָה, וְתַרְדֵּמַת מַרְמִיטָה.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav said: There are three types of slumber – the slumber of sleep, of prophecy, and of <em>marmita</em>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(What a <em>marmita</em> is is subject to debate among the commentaries there and its parallel in 17:5, and is irrelevant to the point at hand.)</p>\n\n<p>Another definition of “ecstasy”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2:</strong> a state of overwhelming emotion\n  <em>especially</em>: rapturous delight</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prophecy fits this bill as well. Consider Shabbos 30b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין שכינה שורה לא מתוך עצבות ולא מתוך עצלות ולא מתוך שחוק ולא מתוך קלות ראש ולא מתוך שיחה ולא מתוך דברים בטלים אלא מתוך דבר שמחה של מצוה שנאמר ועתה קחו לי מנגן והיה כנגן המנגן ותהי עליו יד ה׳</p>\n  \n  <p>The Divine presence doesn’t rest amidst sadness, laziness, laughter, frivolity, speech, or idle matters, but rather amidst a matter of joy of a Mitzvah, as it says, “‘And now, get for me a musician.’ And it was as the musician played that the hand of Hashem was upon him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why don’t they translate prophecy as prophecy? I don’t know – ask whoever wrote the translation. But translating prophecy as “speaking ecstatically” is not a <em>bad</em> translation, per se, as it <em>does</em> describe prophecy fairly accurately. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Some additions to Doniel's answer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In Hebrew, the form of התפעל is commonly translated as \"to act upon oneself\" like להתלבש - dress oneself, so the verb להתנבא can be translated not as \"prophesizing\" but as \"preparing oneself for prophecy\" or \"achieving a state close to prophecy\", which can be interpreted as extasy. </p>\n\n<p>Because G-d initiates a prophecy, or \"G-d makes one prophesize\", a proper verb in Hebrew would be in the form of פועל - i.g. הוא נובא על ידי ה'. See Rambam in Yesodey Hatorah \"מִיסוֹדֵי הַדָּת לֵידַע שֶׁהָאֵל מְנַבֵּא אֶת בְּנֵי הָאָדָם\" - \"It is a fundamental part of religion to acknowledge that <strong>God bestows prophecy</strong> upon the sons of men.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>I recall that in the times of the prophets there were special schools that taught prophecy - reaching a certain psycho-spiritual level (<strong>being \"high\", in trance</strong>) and waiting for the prophecy to come down. There were thousands of בני נביאים that practiced and even reached a spiritual level of getting some רוח הקודש but not really נבואה - G-d didn't speak to them. To remind, there were only 48 real prophets.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Tanach does not make this distinction and uses להתנבא for all those wanna-be prophets, referring to their mental/spiritual state of extasy, ready to receive the divine instructions.</p>\n\n<p>So when a translator does not want to tell that G-d actually spoke to a person (what real prophecy means), they translate it as \"the person has reached the extasy state of being close to prophesy and awaiting G-d's signs\".</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But in fact, I'd agree that the translation is weird, giving the fact that no commentator is hinting on only \"reaching extasy\" and not \"actually prophesizing\", as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.11.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num 11:25</a> (thanks to Isaac)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_I_Samuel.18.10.1?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.18.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel alef 18:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יתנבא. ואשתטי נביא ושוטה מדברים דברי רמזים שאינם ניכרים</p>\n<p>And he raved. [Literally 'he prophesied'] but Targum renders, 'and he raved.' A prophet and a madman speak in unintelligible hints.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_I_Samuel.18.10.2?vhe=Radak_on_Nach&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויתנבא. כתרגומו אישתטתי כלומר היה מדבר דברי שטות</p>\n<p>And he prophesied/raved - Like the Targum translates \"and he raved\" - this means he was speaking words of madness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea being like has been mentioned, prophesying takes a person to such a heightened level, that it often comes out in a state of ecstasy, unintelligible to those around the prophet.</p>\n\n\n",

Before asking for the significance, you should look at the probability that this would happen in a random similar text.  In other words, we want to define what you find to be \"interesting\", generate random data similar to what we find in the Chumash, and see if we find similar results.  If we do, the remez becomes less compelling, because we would have expected something similar to happen in any case.</p>\n\n<p>How can we generate lists of numbers similar to these?  To start with, we don't have to worry about the last digit, which is always 0.  The second to last digit is also 0 for everybody except Gad, so let's exclude that as well.  Generating lists of numbers for the first digit would be very hard because it would have to involve data about the population growth and size, which was far from natural due to sextuplets, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/13815/11532\">What happened to the bechorim (first-borns)?</a>, and other things.  In any case they're not so relevant to this question, because Yehuda, who had unusually large population, still fell short of 80,000 people.</p>\n\n<p>We can approximate that in populations of people of around this size, the second and third digits would be randomly distributed.  There are 24 numbers in these positions - two from each shevet.  So, we can generate lists of 24 random digits and see how likely it is that there's a digit that doesn't appear.</p>\n\n<p>Running this code in python:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre><code>import numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom scipy.stats import poisson\n\nsimple = True\n\ndef probability(ints):\n  ctr = Counter(ints)\n  counts = [ctr[_] for _ in range(10)]\n  if simple:\n    return 0 in counts\n  else:\n    return np.prod([poisson(2.4).pmf(_) for _ in counts])\n\nfor i in range(20):\n  print(probability(np.random.randint(0, 10, size=24)))\n\nprint()\nprint(probability([6,5,9,3,5,6,4,6,4,4,7,4,0,5,2,2,5,4,2,7,1,5,3,4]))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I first simulate 20 lists of 24 numbers and print whether or not there's a digit that doesn't appear.  I get about half <code>True</code> and half <code>False</code>.  Then I print whether there's a digit that doesn't appear in the real numbers, and of course I get <code>True</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For a more complicated analysis, you can set <code>simple = False</code>.  Then it will print the probability of getting the counts, using a Poisson distribution with a mean of 2.4 for each digit.  The probability for the real numbers is about <code>4e-09</code>, which is on the low end but within the range I find for the simulated numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, Hashem gave us these numbers for a reason, but I don't think the absence of 8 is that reason.</p>\n\n\n",

The stated reasons are that they did not provide bread and water (as mentioned in Dev 23) and \"he\" hired Bil'am.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara in Yevamot 76b explains that the injunction is only against the males because they were the ones who should have brought bread and water; it would not have been expected of the women because kol k'vuda bat melech penima, that it isn't proper for women to go out. I'm not sure why the gemara sees this pasuk in tehillim (45:14) as describing the <a href=\"http://www.chinuch.org/item_detail/Kol-Kevuda-Bas-Melech-Pnima-Posters-Blackboard-Topper-and-Card\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">modest</a> behavior of women in the non-Jewish world -- I guess I always assumed that the \"bat melech\" made it refer to Jewish women, but if the gemara wants to apply it to the actions of the Moavi women, then ok.</p>\n\n<p>But this defense of the women rings hollow because in <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0425.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar</a> 25 it was the Moavi women who seduced the Jewish men and drew them to idolatry.

Therefore he says that the <strong>Bnos Yisroel were the ones who were modest and didn't go out to ask for bread</strong> so the Moabite women were not culpable for not bringing the Jewish woman food, as the Jewish women did not go out from their tents to meet them.</p>\n\n<p>The Midyanite woman or men were never exluded from converting even though they did <em>Zenus</em>, so too doing Zenut alone was not a reason to reject the Moabite woman from converting as they could change their ways once they converted like Rachav Hazonah.

(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the group is called קהלא קדישא דבירושלים, or The Holy Community of Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>There is another group mentioned on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=9b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the same page</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר אביי לתפילין כאחרים לק\"ש כותיקין דאמר ר' יוחנן ותיקין היו גומרין\n  אותה עם הנץ החמה תניא נמי הכי ותיקין היו גומרין אותה עם הנץ החמה כדי\n  שיסמוך גאולה לתפלה ונמצא מתפלל ביום</p>\n  \n  <p>Abaye says: In regard to the tefillin, the halachah is as stated by\n  the ‘Others’; in regard to [the recital of] the Shema’, as practised\n  by the watikin.

But seeing that they\n  spend nine hours a day over prayer, how is their knowledge of Torah\n  preserved and how is their work done? [The answer is] that because\n  they are pious, their Torah is preserved and their work is blessed.\n  (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this case the name of the group is חסידים הראשונים, or The Pious Men of Old.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Not in ברכות, but given the very vague parameters of the question, might it be the 36 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzadikim_Nistarim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hidden righteous</a> mentioned in Sanhedrin 97b and Sukka 45b?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Abaye said: The world has no fewer than thirty-six righteous people in\n  each generation who greet the Divine Presence</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A group of pious people called the \"vatikin\" (ותיקין) are mentioned on Berakhot 26a.

Must he tell them immediately, or can he push it off a bit, and tell the Yeshiva closer to the start of the year?<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, it doesn't matter to the Yeshiva whether the student comes or not; they will be giving that class anyway, regardless of one more or one less student.<sup>2</sup> On the other hand, perhaps, since the Yeshiva is assuming that the student will be coming back, if the student doesn't tell the Yeshiva otherwise, it would be misleading the Yeshiva and therefore a prohibition of Geneivas Da'as.<sup>3</sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In principle, this is the opposite of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/60105/school-closing-at-what-point-must-the-parents-be-told\">this question</a> regarding a <em>school</em> telling the <em>students</em> that the <em>school</em> is closing.

I'm sure you can come up with loads of cases where that side would not apply and therefore every day they assume he's coming costs them. Obviously my question does not apply in such cases.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> I'm unclear if intentional lack of action that leads to a party being mislead qualifies as Geneivas Da'as.

He said to them, “Why did the Rabbis trouble themselves to come all this way?” Rav Safra said to him, “We didn’t know you were coming; had we known, we would have taken even more trouble!” Rava said to [Rav Safra], “Why did you tell him this, which upsets him?” [Rav Safra] said to Rava, “We were misleading him!” [Rava said to Rav Safra,] “He was misleading himself.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see from here that one is able to take inaction, even if it might be misinterpreted, as long as one does not actively mislead others.

Those are based either on an existing agreement or the accepted state of matters (state regulations?) which I collectively call Dinah DeMalchutah. So, theoretically, the student might be sued to pay damages as described in the agreement.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Non-monetary בין אדם לחבירו Mitzvot</strong>: like deceit, לפני עוור, wasting of effort and time, הונאה/הונאת דברים and more.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Therefore our pious student must check two things - a. what the official agreement/regulations say b. are there any possible \"spiritual damages\" to specific people to prevent.</p>\n\n<p>It is also important to note that <strong>it is very advisable to behave לפני משורת הדין</strong>, so if an earlier notice might help one should consider informing as early as he makes up his mind.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there's another part which is בין אדם למקום, as the Gm says \"ה' יראה ללבב\", meaning one should check his own intentions, to ensure that whatever he does (even Halachicly and legally) he has no intention to harm in any way.</p>\n\n\n",

However, even though most Hindus indulge in the practice of \"murti-puja\" which is basically idolatry, there are some Hindus who are staunchly against idol-worship, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arya_Samaj\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arya Samaj</a> organisation. This is what the founder of the Arya Samaj organisation, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Dayananda\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Swami Dayananda Saraswati</a>, says about idolatry in Pg 242 of his \"<a href=\"http://www.aryasamaj.org/newsite/Light_Of_Truth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Light of Truth</a>\": </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Being All-pervading He cannot be imagined to exist in any particular object only. To hold to the contrary would be tantamount to believing that the sovereign Lord of the earth rules over a small cottage to the exclusion of His whole Empire and would be an insult to Him. In like manner, it is a blasphemy against God to imagine Him as existing in one particular object only.</p>\n  \n  <p>If you believe Him to Omnipresent, why do you pluck flowers fro the garden and offer them to the idol, make a thin paste of Sandal wood and apply this to it, burn incense, beat drums and cymbals, and blow trumpets before it? He pervades your hands, why do you then stand before it with folded palms? He is in your head, why should you then prostrate yourself before the image? He is in food and drinks, why should you then offer them to it? He is in water, why, should you the bathe it? God pervades all these things. What do you worship, the pervader or the pervaded? If the former, why do you then offer flowers, etc., to images made of stone or wood? If the latter, why do you then lay a false claim to the worship of God? Why don't you say that you worship stalks and stones etc., which is the bare truth?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Arya Samaj, instead believes God to be formless in the infallibility of the Vedas, one of the principle key texts of Hinduism and puts emphasis on chanting of the mantras inside it and the rituals prescribed in text.

Avodah zarah literally means \"foreign worship\", and to a Jew, any religion other than Judaism would fall under this category. </p>\n\n<p>Since (apparently) the Arya Sumaj Hindus believe God to be one, have no form, etc. it seems it is no more avodah zarah than Islam. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/26328/jews-allowed-to-pray-and-join-muslim-congregation-in-mosques-and-experiences/26355#26355\">Since Islam is not considered to be avodah zarah</a>, I think we can conclude that this would not be either, provided this religion follows all the Seven Noahide Mitzvot.</p>\n\n\n",

In either case, if they reach 20 without showing signs of puberty, they automatically become adults and just aren’t able to have children. </p>\n\n<p>This Halacha is brought down in many places, one of which is Yevamos 97a. There, and in Niddah 47b, the Gemara relates the following story, though in Niddah the story is attributed to R’ Chiya instead (translation is mine, and the brackets follow Rashi to the version in Yevamos):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי אתו לקמיה דרבא אי כחוש אמר להו זילו אבריוהו ואי בריא אמר להו זילו אכחשוהו דהני סימנין זמנין דנתרי מחמת כחישותא וזמנין דנתרי מחמת בריותא:</p>\n  \n  <p>When they [people who were 20 but without signs] would come to Rava, if they were skinny, he would say to them, “Go and fatten up.” If they were fat, he would say to them, “Go and become skinny.” For these signs, sometimes they fall off due to being skinny, and sometimes they fall off due to being fat. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi (to Yevamos) explains how one accomplishes this (at least the fattening part):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבריוהו - האכילוהו והשקוהו עד שיהא בריא ושמן:</p>\n  \n  <p>They would feed him and give him to drink until he would become big and fat. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, eat a lot. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In case anyone’s curious, the Gemara in Niddah swaps out “falling off” for “coming,” though since it does so in each case, the end result would be the same.

    "title": "Obligation to accept Rabbinical sayings \"על ימין שהוא שמאל\"",
    "content": "# Obligation to accept Rabbinical sayings \"על ימין שהוא שמאל\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>To continue my scientific/Halachic exploration, I would like to summarize the approaches in one question that addresses the famous Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.17.11?vhe=Tanach_with_Nikkud&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dvorim 17,11</a>. I think this long and well-sourced question is crucial in setting the common ground for all \"reality/science vs Judaism\" related questions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עַל־פִּי הַתּוֹרָה אֲשֶׁר יוֹרוּךָ וְעַל־הַמִּשְׁפָּט אֲשֶׁר־יֹאמְרוּ לְךָ תַּעֲשֶׂה לֹא תָסוּר מִן־הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר־יַגִּידוּ לְךָ <strong>יָמִין וּשְׂמֹאל</strong>׃</p>\n<p>You shall act in accordance with the instructions given you and the ruling handed down to you; you must not deviate from the verdict that they announce <strong>to you either to the right or to the left.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi on the verse, actually, \"distorts\" the original Sifre mixing it a bit with Yerushalmi, please compare:</p>\n<p>Rashi uses \"objective\" terms of right and left:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\" אֲפִלּוּ אוֹמֵר לְךָ <strong>עַל יָמִין שֶׁהוּא שְׂמֹאל וְעַל שְׂמֹאל שֶׁהוּא יָמִין</strong>, וְכָל שֶׁכֵּן שֶׁאוֹמֵר לְךָ עַל יָמִין יָמִין וְעַל שְׂמֹאל שְׂמֹאל (ספרי):</p>\n<p>Even if the judge tells you about right that it is left, or about left that it is right, you have to obey him; how much the more is this so if actually, he tells you about right that it is right and about left it is left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sifrei_Devarim.154.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifre Dvorim 154:5</a> clearly uses a different, \"subjective\" language:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ימין ושמאל. אפילו <strong>נראים בעיניך</strong> על שמאל שהוא ימין, ועל ימין שהוא שמאל - שמע להם.</p>\n<p>\"right or left\": Even if <strong>it seems in your eyes</strong> that they are telling you left is right and right is left, listen to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Horayot.2b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Horayot 2b</a> presents a completely different picture:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\":ואם בטועה לומר התורה אמרה אחריהם אחריהם אין זה שמעון בן עזאי כהדא דתני <strong>יכול אם יאמרו לך על ימין שהיא שמאל ועל שמאל שהיא ימין תשמע להם</strong>? ת\"ל ללכת ימין ושמאל שיאמרו לך על ימין שהוא ימין ועל שמאל שהוא שמאל</p>\n<p>(<em>my translation</em>) ... Can you think that if they say on right it's left and vice verse you will listen to them? [of course not!] For [the verse says] \"to stray right and left\" is only when they say on right that it's right and on left that's left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Rashi's interpretation here is off the traditional approach of either Sifre that allows for listening to the Rabbis when the judgment is subjective (like your right is my left) or the Yerushalmi that does not accept listening to Rabbis that contradict the evident - call the right left and vice verse.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, this Rashi became widely accepted and extrapolated to all Rabbinical sayings in the Talmud, the Midrash and more, causing accusation of those who follow the opposing [and not a less traditional] view in heresy and apostasy.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>The question:</strong> Are there sources that accept the Sifre and the Yerushalmi's approach to [not/] accepting Rabbinical sayings over Rashi's? Like Ramba\"N, Avraham Ben Haramba\"M and more?</p>\n<p>A \"Meta\"-question - shouldn't the contemporary Rabbis revert the official Judaic position of the blind אמונת חכמים to the Sifre and Yerushalmi views without sacrificing anything??</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Yes, there are very many.  See the <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Devarim/17.11#e1nf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mefarshim to this verse</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ramban agrees with Sifrei and disagrees with Rashi (this is in line with the Shaarei Aharon and other mefarshim), based on the fact that he echoes the Sifrei:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וענינו: <strong>אפילו תחשוב בלבך שהם טועים</strong>, והדבר פשוט בעיניך כאשר אתה יודע בין ימינך לשמאלך, תעשה כמצותם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Hakesav Vehaabbalah (based on Mizrachi and Tzedah Laderech) says that Rashi's girsa is wrong and should follow the Sifrei:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ימין ושמאל – אפילו מראים בעיניך על שמאל שהוא ימין ועל ימין שהוא שמאל (כ״ה לשון ספרי), פי׳ דלפי מראה עיניך הם טועין בדין מ״מ תשמע להם; אבל אם ידוע בודאי שהם טועים, כבר אמרו בירושלמי (רשפ״ק דהוריות) אם יאמרו על ימין שהוא שמאל ועל שמאל שהוא ימין אין לשמוע להם (ע׳ רא״ם וצד״ל), <strong>ולשון רש״י כאן צריך תיקון.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Malbim follows Sifrei directly, as he explains it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומ״ש ״ימין ושמאל״, היינו לפי דמיונך. שתדמה שמהפכים שמאל לימין, בכ״ז לא תסור. כי באמת הלכה כדבריהם, ועל דעתם ניתנה התורה. ורוח ה׳ תנהלם לכוון ההלכה, ולא יטעו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A notable Shitah is that of the Minchas Yehudah (one of the Baalei Hatosfos), who even interprets Rashi in line with the Sifri/Yerushalmi, noting that obviously Rashi agrees that if you know something is clearly Assur, you should not listen to anyone that tells you otherwise, and that Rashi must be referring to Rabbinic Takanos/Gezeiros.  This clearly shows that he disagrees with what you are reading into Rashi (and that he feels that Rashi disagrees with the way you are reading Rashi):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פירש״י אפי׳ אומר לך על ימין שהוא שמאל ועל שמאל שהיא ימין וכ״ש כשאומרים על ימין ימין ועל שמאל שמאל עכ״ל. <strong>תימא וכי שומעין לחכם שאומר על טמא טהור ועל אסור מותר אלא ע״כ פתרונו על גזרות חכמים ותקנותם</strong> על ימין שהוא שמאל כגון תקיעת שופר שאינה דוחה שבת וכן הרבה ועל שמאל שהוא ימין כגון שניות לעריות וכן הרבה עד״י ב״א.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A non-kohein cannot perform mitzvos related to avoda in the Temple, wear <em>bigdei kehuna</em>, eat <em>terumah</em>, etc. A non-levi cannot participate in guarding Beis haMamikdash, singing in a Temple choir, separate <em>terumas ma'aser</em>.

However at mincha the custom is to lean on the left arm.  Since most men are right handed and wear tefilin on their left arm, from a practical standpoint in shacharit one would lean on the right arm and at mincha on the left.</p>\n\n<p>My question is what is the nature of this custom to avoid the arm which is wearing the tefilin and where does it come form?  During the times of the gemarah we know that men would wear tefilin all day long, so it does not seem that that this is something that would be forbidden or disrespectful.  </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The first point to note is that this custom of alternating sides depending on whether one is wearing tefillin, is something of a compromise position.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.131.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayyim 131:1</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשנופל על פניו נהגו להטות על צד שמאל</p>\n  \n  <p>When one falls on one's face, the custom is to lean on the left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rema ad loc. adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וי\"א דיש להטות על צד ימין והעיקר להטות בשחרית כשיש לו תפילין בשמאלו על צד ימין משום כבוד התפילין ובערבית או כשאין לו תפילין בשמאלו יטה על צד שמאל</p>\n  \n  <p>But some say to lean on the right. And the main thing to do is in the morning (when he has <em>tefillin</em> on his left arm) to lean on the right due to the respect due to the  <em>tefillin</em>, and in the late afternoon, or if he does not have <em>tefillin</em> on his left arm, he should lean on the left.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think what is going on is that Rema is using the fairly minor issue of כבוד תפילין (respect due to the <em>tefillin</em>) as a way of compromising between two alternative opinions - always on the left or always on the right.</p>\n\n<p>In support of my view, I note that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Turei_Zahav_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.131.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taz ad loc. 3</a> refers to this custom as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פשרת רמ\"א</p>\n  \n  <p>the compromise of Rema.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One final point is that <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=409\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bi'ur HaGra ad loc. 5</a> notes (somewhat cryptically) that leaning on the arm with <em>tefillin</em> would imply some disrespect</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דהם אות</p>\n  \n  <p>because they are a sign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reward for women wearing Tzizit\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a general rule that a person who is not obligated cannot do a mitzvah on behalf of someone who is obligated, and according to at least one Rishon this is because a person who is obligated has a stronger Yetzer Hara, and the more difficulty someone has with a Mitzvah the more reward they get.</p>\n\n<p>Since the person not obligated receives less reward, they cannot do it on behalf of someone who's baseline mitzvah receives more.</p>\n\n<p>But what about Tzizit?</p>\n\n<p>A person is not obligated to wear Tzizit unless he wears a four-cornered garment. Therefore he's not Chayiv in the mitzvah until he puts on the four-cornered garment. A person doesn't have the Yetzer Hara to take off the Tzizit from the garment. </p>\n\n<p>So would women, who are not obligated in Tzizit, receive the same amount of reward as men, who are obligated? In this case, since the level of difficulty is the same, wouldn’t the reward be the same?</p>\n\n<p>(I'm not asking if they can put on Tzizit for men just whether it makes sense that the reward level should be the same) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are a few misconceptions in your question.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, it is true that it is considered more worthy for someone obligated to do a mitzva than for someone who isn't obligated. But there is an unrelated, separate principle that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whoever is not obligated to do a certain matter cannot discharge the\n  obligation on behalf of the community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rosh_Hashanah.29b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana 29b</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, a mitzva that has to be done with the body (חובת הגוף), can only be done by the person themself. The concept of agency (שליחות) doesn't help. (For example, I can appoint an agent to marry a woman for me, but not to do circumcision on my behalf...)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, while it's true that the mitzva of tzitizit is optional since one doesn't have to wear a four-cornered garment, if a man and a woman both wear one, the former is obligated in tzitzit while the latter is not. So the level of obligation is not equivalent.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps! </p>\n\n\n",

Yishai, David’s father, had been separated from his wife for three years<sup>2</sup>. His wife had a maidservant, and Yishai wanted to have more children<sup>3</sup>. He therefore petitioned her for her cooperation<sup>4</sup>. She wasn’t interested, and asked her mistress, Yishai's wife, for advice. Yishai’s wife came up with a plan: the maidservant will pretend to be interested, but in the dark she’ll switch with her mistress. This is what happened, and Yishai’s wife became pregnant with David.</p>\n<p>Since Yishai didn’t know he had been intimate with his own wife, he and his other sons thought she had committed adultery. David would therefore have the status of a <em>mamzer</em><sup>5</sup>. This could explain why his father \"abandoned\" him. Regarding his mother, who knew the truth, maybe she played along with her husband. In fact, some say<sup>6</sup> that she didn't want to embarrass Yishai, nor her maidservant, and thus kept what happened a secret until Shmuel anointed David. Then the latter's status was finally cleared among his family<sup>7</sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not proving that <strong>Psalms</strong> Chapter 27 specifically is referring to King David's parents having abandoned him.

There had been a debate raging ever since then if the Torah only forbade male members from Moav, or even female. Boaz had ruled the former, and married Ruth. Even though that was the decided ruling (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.77a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Yevamos</strong> 77a</a>), Yishai, due to his great righteousness, was concerned that perhaps the halacha was not so. He would consequently be forbidden from marrying into the Jewish people. Therefore, he separated physically from his wife.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <strong>Asara Ma’amaros</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em>; this was to fulfill ולערב אל תנח ידך (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.62b.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Yevamos</strong> 62b</a>). <strong>Yalkut Machiri</strong> only says that Yishai desired his wife’s maidservant</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> <strong>Asara Ma’amaros</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em> explains that Yishai planned to make a stipulation: If the halacha is that only male members of Moav are forbidden to marry into the Jewish people, then the maidservant should become free and a full member of the Jewish people. He would thus marry her. If, however the <em>halacha</em> is that even female members of Moav are forbidden, then she should remain a maidservant, as he would be allowed to be with her in her present state</p>\n<p><sup>5</sup> This is the explanation of <strong>Yalkut Me’am Loez</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em> However, both <strong>Asara Ma’amaros</strong> and <strong>Kli Yakar</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em> sound like Yishai eventually knew he had impregnated his wife.

Those passersby said: There is no nation as worthy of cleaving to it as this one.

Saul was \"zealous\", but Rash'i explains that this was not a positive zealousness as what Pinchas did. Saul originally wanted to kill just the Cohanim in Gibon, but from the time that Saul learned that his kingdom would not be established, he decided to take out his \"anger\" for failing to destroy Amalek completely, and took it out by destroying all of Gibon.

The seventh aliya says (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0529.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 29:5</a>), \"You neither ate bread, nor drank new wine or old wine, in order that you ...\"  How did they worship?  What did they do for Friday night kiddush?  More importantly, how did they bring the various korbanos (sacrifices) that require meal and wine?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While I haven’t seen anyone who addresses this question specifically, perhaps we can glean an answer from the Ramban on this passuk (29:5):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לחם לא אכלתם ויין ושכר לא שתיתם. הטעם לא אכלתם ממנו שתוכלו לחיות ממנו כי עיקר מחיתם במן היתה למען תדעו כי אני ה' אלהיכם המחיה אתכם במעשה הנס ואין טעמו שלא אכלו לחם כלל כמו לחם לא אכלתי ומים לא שתיתי (לעיל ט ט) כי בקצת העתים היה לישראל במדבר לחם כמו שכתוב (שם ב כח כט) אכל בכסף תשבירני ואכלתי ומים בכסף תתן לי ושתיתי כאשר עשו לי בני עשו היושבים בשעיר והמואבים היושבים בער ורבותינו הזכירו (יומא עה) דברים שתגרי אומות העולם מביאים להם במדבר ואפשר עוד כי מעת שירד המן עד בואם אל שעיר לא אכלו לחם כלל כי הלכו במדבר הגדול והנורא אבל בשנת הארבעים קרבו לישוב ונאמר להם (לעיל ב ד ו) ואת העם צו לאמר אתם עוברים בגבול אחיכם בני עשו אכל תשברו מאתם ושם (פסוק ז) כתוב זה ארבעים שנה ה' אלהיך עמך לא חסרת דבר ומן העת ההיא היו האדומים והמואבים מקדימים אותם בלחם ובמים והיו גדולי ישראל קונים מהם ואוכלים לתענוג לא לצורך ולא לשבעה ועיקר המחיה שלהם במן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramban’s main point is that the passuk doesn’t mean that they literally never ate bread nor drank wine in the desert, similar to Moshe Rabbeinu on Har Sinai, as we find that they offered to pay for food from Edom, Moav, and Amon. Likewise, the Gemara relates that the nations gave gifts of food to the Jews. </p>\n\n<p>The Ramban gives a second answer to reconcile these two discussions that the Jews ate the mann for most of the forty years, until they approached Edom’s borders in the fortieth year. It was at that point that the nations began donating gifts and the Jews offered to pay for food. </p>\n\n<p>According to the Ramban’s first answer, perhaps we can answer your question as well: of course they had plenty of flour for Menachos and wine for Nesachim, since they ate bread and wine normally anyway. According to his second answer, the question remains unresolved regarding the first 39+ years. </p>\n\n\n",

Or, am I Potur from the Miztvot of Kohanim or a King?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The rule that women are exempt from time-bound positive mitzvot is derived by the Talmud in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=34&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 34a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומצות עשה שהזמן גרמא נשים פטורות: מנלן גמר מתפילין מה תפילין נשים\n  פטורות אף כל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא נשים פטורות ותפילין גמר לה מתלמוד\n  תורה מה תלמוד תורה נשים פטורות אף תפילין נשים פטורות</p>\n  \n  <p>AND AFFIRMATIVE PRECEPTS LIMITED TO TIME, WOMEN ARE EXEMPT. Whence do\n  we know it? — It is learned from phylacteries: just as women are\n  exempt from phylacteries, so are they exempt from all affirmative\n  precepts limited to time. Phylacteries [themselves] are derived from\n  the study of the Torah: just as women are exempt from the study of the\n  Torah, so are they exempt from phylacteries. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The rule that women are exempt from Torah study is in turn derived in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=29b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 29b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>איהי מנלן דלא מיחייבא דכתיב ולימדתם ולמדתם כל שמצווה ללמוד מצווה ללמד\n  וכל שאינו מצווה ללמוד אינו מצווה ללמד ואיהי מנלן דלא מיחייבה למילף\n  נפשה דכתיב ולימדתם ולמדתם כל שאחרים מצווין ללמדו מצווה ללמד את עצמו\n  וכל שאין אחרים מצווין ללמדו אין מצווה ללמד את עצמו ומנין שאין אחרים\n  מצווין ללמדה דאמר קרא ולמדתם אותם את בניכם ולא בנותיכם</p>\n  \n  <p>How do we know that she [the mother] has no duty [to teach her\n  children]? — Because it is written, we-limaddetem [and ye shall\n  teach], [which also reads] u-lemadetem [and ye shall study]: [hence]\n  whoever is commanded to study, is commanded to teach; whoever is not\n  commanded to study, is not commanded to teach. And how do we know that\n  she is not bound to teach herself? — Because it is written,\n  we-limaddetem [and ye shall teach] — u-lema — detem [and ye shall\n  learn]: the one whom others are commanded to teach is commanded to\n  teach oneself; and the one whom others are not commanded to teach, is\n  not commanded to teach oneself. How then do we know that others are\n  not commanded to teach her? — Because it is written: ‘And ye shall\n  teach them your sons’ — but not your daughters. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino\n  translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the exemption for time-bound positive mitzvot ultimately leads back to <strong>the fact that the commandment of Torah study was never given to women in the first place</strong> – the Torah says to teach your sons, but not your daughters.</p>\n\n<p>It stands to reason, then, that the exemption for time-bound positive commandments is the same. That is to say, that just like <strong>the commandment of Torah study was never given to them in the first place, the commandments of tefillin, tzitzit, etc. were never given to them in the first place</strong>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I write this answer as I've researched that hard. I didn't find anyone explaining the concept of Ptur, but I did come up with a conclusion of my own, based on Gemmorah's and other sources:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Pshat of the term Patur implies that there was an original obligation that was canceled or postponed (that's my starting point, not a conclusion).</p></li>\n<li><p>A woman that keeps Succot (and Lulav and Teffilin etc) - earns a reward as אינה מצווה ועושה. Same pattern we see with a Goy that learned Torah (B\"K 38a).</p></li>\n<li><p>But a woman that wobbles Lulav on Pesach does not, and we don't say אינה מצווה ועושה. Same with an Israel saying Birkat Kohanim or a Goy that makes the Shabbos Kiddush. But why, as technically all those fit that definition?</p></li>\n<li><p>Seemingly we have two types of אינו מצווה ועושה, I would say the emphasize on עושה - one that does something (a Tikkun) and one that does nothing. For one to be עושה, one has to be originally commanded or related but he was eventually eased upon (דחויה), but for one who does nothing - he was never commanded (could not be commanded in principle - הותרה).</p></li>\n<li><p>The Gemmorah in B\"M 38a bring brings a Passuk (\"ראה ויתר גויים\"), from which it infers that Hashem withdrew the Mitzvot (and Mamon) from Goyim before commanding Israel on Mt Sinai. </p></li>\n<li><p>That explains why the Goyim earn a reward for keeping some Mitzvot they are not currently commanded (as honoring parents for Dama Ben Netina, Kiddushin 30 or learning Torah in general) - they were commanded but they were eventually released.<br>\n.<br>\nThat, in contrary to Mitzvot they were never commanded and could not be commanded as Israeli, as Remembering the Exodus, making Kiddush on Shabbos, wearing Teffilin and more.</p></li>\n<li><p>Therefore I conclude that women, displaying the same Halachic pattern of אינה מצווה ועושה, can be rewarded for the 7 time-related Mitzvos <strong>because</strong> they were initially commanded/related on Mt. Sinai, but were exempt or released later (maybe even on the same standing), but anyway, the impression of the Mitzvah stayed forever, otherwise they would do nothing.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Since most have a daytime job and the tax is deducted in advance, in practice it means that at the end of the year one would get some money back from the state by having less tax deducted from the next salary. If someone makes a <em>neder</em> of making a donation of a given amount, has (s)he fulfilled the obligation if a certain part is reimbursed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R Shimon Taub (<a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195893.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Laws of Tzedakah and Maaser</a>, p. 149) writes that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One who benefits by giving <em>tzedakah</em> because he ends up paying less\n  taxes is <strong>not</strong> obligated to give that profit to <em>tzedakah</em>. Therefore if\n  one would have had to pay $10,000 in taxes had he not given <em>tzedakah</em>,\n  but because of all the <em>tzedakah</em> he gave must pay only $7,000, he is\n  not obliged to give in the profit of $3,000 to <em>tzedakah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He references Igrot Moshe YD 1:143 that even real benefit coming from tzedakah belongs to the donor and not to tzedakah. As such one would have fulfilled one's obligation even if reimbursed in part.</p>\n\n<p>This is also the conclusion of R Ari Wasserman (in his book <a href=\"http://a.co/d/fDwSjJc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Making it work</a>, see p. 14 of the PDF <a href=\"http://www.workplacehalacha.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Chapter-7-Maaser-Kesafim-Jan-20_15.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) quoting the same Igrot Moshe as R Taub above</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An interesting point raised in Rav Moshe’s responsum is the deduction\n  of charitable contributions when computing income tax. Certain\n  governments allow a tax deduction for donating money (or even goods)\n  to charities, which lowers the tax bill. Are we required to give\n  maaser based on the higher amount of post-tax net income which results\n  from taking the tax deduction (since we pay less tax as a result of\n  the tax deduction, we are left with a higher net income), or do we\n  compute the maaser based on what would have been a lower amount of net\n  income, assuming no tax deduction? <strong>Rav Moshe rules that we need only\n  give the maaser on the lower amount of the posttax net income, and can\n  take the benefit from the tax deduction allowed for charitable\n  donations</strong> (Igros Moshe, Yoreh Deah, vol. I, 143).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and I have now seen it quoted in the name of R Chaim Kanievsky as well (<a href=\"https://lifeinisrael.blogspot.com/2019/01/interesting-psak.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To give an alternate perspective, Eretz Hemda (very bottom <a href=\"https://eretzhemdah.org/qna.asp?lang=en&pageid=&cat=18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) suggests giving 10% of the \"tax-back\" as further tzedakah if the person has the means to do this (remember there is no formal set of <em>halachot</em> for <em>tzedaka</em> which many consider a worthwhile custom but not an obligation, which explains why different people sometimes come to different rulings in this area)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You could look at it as income. You can also look at it as it turning\n  out that you paid less taxes than was expected during withholding, and\n  therefore that retroactively you had more net income in the previous\n  year than you thought and thus did not give enough maaser (which is\n  fine).</p>\n  \n  <p>Either way of analyzing it, it is proper to give 10% of the refund in\n  the next \"maaser period.\" If you have difficulty giving a full maaser,\n  there is room to look for various leniencies and you can be back in\n  touch with us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally note it is best <strong>not</strong> to make vows (<em>nedarim</em>) to charity lest one forget to honor his commitment and violate a Torah prohibition. Saying <em>bli neder</em> after a pledge is an easy way to accomplish this (see R Avrohom Chaim Feuer's <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195145.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The tzedakah treasury</a>, p. 220)</p>\n\n\n",

Gerizim and Mt. Eval.</p>\n\n<p>In the Torah, it lists only the curses that were said (i.e. \"Cursed be anyone who makes a sculptured or molten image\", etc.). Rashi (quoting the Gemara in Sotah 32a) says that while it's not written explicitly, each curse was preceded by the parallel blessing (i.e. “Blessed be the man that does not make any graven or molten image etc.”).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone discuss why only the curses were written in the Torah and not the Blessings? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Maharal asks this question (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Devarim.27.12.3?vhe=OYW&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gur Aryeh on Rashi</a> on 27:12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ופתחו בברכה וכו'.

On the contrary - the blessings should be written!” It seems possible to say that the main part is the curses, since they needed to accept the Torah through a curse-oath (cf. Rashi to v. 26, where he makes this point); therefore the passuk is written with the curses. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He says this answer and more in his commentary to Rashi on 11:29:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ופתחו בברכה. [...] וקשיא, למה נכתבו הקללות בפרשת כי תבא (להלן כז, טו-כו), ולא נכתבו הברכות. ונראה שעיקר המצוה היו הקללות, כדי שיהיו ישראל מקבלים את התורה באלה ובשבועה (רש\"י להלן כז, כו), אלא שפותחין לעולם בזכות תחלה (ר' סנהדרין לג. ), הקדים הכתוב הברכה. ולעולם עיקר המצוה הקללות, כדי שיקבלו התורה. ועוד, אם כתב בפירוש הברכות, הייתי אומר הברכות ניתנו בפירוש, ולא הקללות, והא דכתיב \"ואת הקללה על הר עיבל\", היינו שמכלל ברכה אתה שומע קללה, דמכלל הן אתה שומע לאו (ספרי פסוק יח). והשתא שכתב הקללות בפירוש, על כרחך גם הברכות בפירוש נאמרו, דעדיפי ברכה מקללה, שהרי היה פותחו בברכה, דכתיב \"ברכה וקללה\":</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because of this piece’s length, I will try to summarize it, rather than try to translate it. </p>\n\n<p>He starts off with the same answer he gives in Ki Savo, that since the Torah is to be accepted through a curse-oath, the curses are the main part. He adds that the blessings, in practice, were said first, because, similar to capital case proceedings (Sanhedrin 33a), we always start off with saying one’s merits. </p>\n\n<p>His second answer is a little more technical. If the passuk had said the blessings, I would not have understood that the curses were actually said - when it says “and the curses on Har Eival,” I would have thought it means that they are understood from the blessings (in line with the Sifri to 11:18, “from the positive I understand the negative”). Now that the curses are said explicitly, though, I understand that the blessings were certainly said explicitly, since the passuk says “the blessing and the curse” - placing the blessing first. </p>\n\n\n",

This will show you that what is being said itself can be used as a springboard for thought and reflection, and that you may even be anticipating certain passages. Also, that it is not chock full of words, rather all the words are of value. It may also show you that it’s not daunting at all - rather an orderly arrangement. There are certainty many poems that many congregations don’t even say, so if yours is saying them, consider skipping them. </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.100.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach C. 100</a>) the prayers of holidays and Rosh Chodesh require one to take special preparation before praying, so that it flows right when praying. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תפלות של מועדות ושל ראש חודש צריך להסדיר תפלתו קודם שיתפלל כדי שתהא\n  שגורה בפיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Turei_Zahav_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.100?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Turei Zahav adds</a> that one needs to understand the meanings and explanations of prayers, specifically certain piyutim (poems) in which their meanings and explanations are difficult to understand without putting considerable effort to understand them. Therefore, one must certainly prepare and arrange his prayers beforehand (and just having a <em>siddur</em> in front of him will not guarantee proper understanding, but that’s obvious). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מ\"מ נראה דבתפלה שצריך להבין בפי' הדברים בפרט בפיוטים שחמור פירוש' אם\n  לא בנתינת דעה רבה עליהם ודאי צריך להסדיר תחלה (ולא מהני לו ספר בזה וזה\n  פשוט)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the Slichos, ‘סליחות המפורש’ (which in turn, I recommend you look into their other Machzorim), there is an introduction, here is part of it, in rough English translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the causes which prevents one who prays from understanding his prayers is the extant difficulty in understanding the difficult and exotic words used in prayer, specifically in the piyutim - it’s meanings are mostly hidden and only a drop reveled. This stems from several problems:</p>\n  \n  <p>1) The language of the piyutim is very concise and difficult; The words are made up of exalted and hidden concepts and ideas. Additionally, quite often the words are based on Aramaic words directly from the Talmud. </p>\n  \n  <p>2) In essence, the piyutim are arranged based on Tanach, Gemara and Midrash. In that, in order to grasp an understand of what they’re saying, it requires one to have a broad range and breadth of knowledge in these areas. And indeed you will not find any piyut that is not drawing from these sources. Additionally, the quick pace at which they are said prevent the reciter to look up and reference what is being said, as he says it. This coupled with that will truly weigh down on the one praying and prevent one from understanding the simple meaning, as well as perhaps a deeper meaning. </p>\n  \n  <p>This fact causes great difficulty on the one praying to understand the depth of the prayer and its significance and meaning. And sometimes even, the recitation of selichos (piyutim) turns into a great and heavy burden that causes one the to want to finish up as quickly as possible. And in that, the essence of these recitations are lost, that is: to ask and plead from the depths of ones heart from The Master of Forgiveness (‏אדון הסליחות), that He forgive his nation, Yisroel of their sins. \n  <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/c8Lcx.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/c8Lcx.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Since the question can be answered with mostly opinion based statements, I hope you would forgive me if I could not cite <em>halakhah</em> for all my claims. I dare to give an answer due to my (limited) experience as a <em>chazan.</em></p>\n<p>First, the purpose of different <em>piyutim</em> should be considered. Our sages of blessed memory composed these religious poems in order to increase the solemnity of the service and on <em>yomim noraim</em> to induce introspection and self-reflection. The piety of authors, such as <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleazar_ben_Killir\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Eleazar haKalir</a> or the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Hasidim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chasidei Ashkenaz</a> should serve as an example of right attitude on these days. Due to the complexity and often metaphoric meaning, one should do efforts to read and understand these poems in advance. Many of them feature <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkabah_mysticism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maasei Merkavah</a>, which might be difficult for advanced learners as well.</p>\n<p>Therefore one should really know what can be considered obligatory (mostly based on <em>minhag),</em> and what is an additional feature that is a very meritorious act to say. In Ashkenazi practice <em>piyutim</em> are inserted between the blessings of the Shema <em>(yotzer, ofan, zalut)</em> and in the repetition of the <em>Amidah,</em> mostly around the first two blessings and between the verses of the <em>Kedushah.</em></p>\n<p>Although I'm not aware of clear <em>halakhic</em> reference, but all of them are optional in theory. Some even oppose such additions, this is why we ask permission in advance to say them <em>(Misod chachamim),</em> but <em>Mizrachim</em> barely add <em>piyutim</em> to the repetition. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%9B\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chayim 620:1</a> praises the practice of limiting <em>piyutim</em> in the morning prayer of <em>Yom Kippur</em> to finish <em>musaf</em> on time.</p>\n<p>The selection among these poems are more treacherous waters, and based on the local <em>minhag</em> the rabbi and the <em>chazan</em> should agree on the parts to be said. A very common choice to omit are the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/85352/selichot-on-yom-hakkipurim/85353#85353\"><em>selichot</em> of <em>Yom Kippur</em></a>. Others may be selected on the indications of the <em>machzor.</em> My Schlesinger books rarely say that certain parts are omitted by many congregations, but very fine print and the lack of translation might give a clue. Artscroll took one step ahead and, after consulting local rabbis, put many <em>piyutim</em> in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89773/names-of-mazalot-in-judaism\">appendix</a>.

The one who buys raw kosher liver may broil it properly and eliminate the blood; or may wrongly transgress, and ignore that chore. But, even if he cooks the liver with its blood without broiling (searing/kashering the blood) first, the maximum he is violating is Rabbinic Law when he eats it. This is because he relies on Tosfos over Rashi to avoid Biblical punishment; since he is only eating cooked blood, not raw blood.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, eating Biblically forbidden food is worse than unkoshering a pot on a Rabbinical level.</p>\n\n\n",

All the Torah had to write to tell us that Rivkah appeared before Eliezer had completed his prayer was ויהי ככלותו לדברו, “as soon as he had finished speaking, etc.” Actually, the word הוא in this verse is not a personal pronoun, i.e. “he,” but a name of G-d. (compare Genesis 19,33 where we encountered this word in that context) We have numerous examples of the word הוא being a reference to a name of G-d, such as Psalms 100, 3 הוא עשנו ולו אנחנו, “He has made us and we belong to Him;” Numbers 18,23 ועבד הלוי הוא, ”and the Levite will serve G-d, etc.;” the word הוא in that verse means that Eliezer enjoyed G-d’s special assistance in his mission by means of the angel concerning whom Avraham had prayed to G-d that He should make Eliezer’s mission successful (verse 7).The angel, was at hand already before Eliezer had completed praying and he arranged for Rivkah to be the maiden whom Eliezer would address first with his request for water. This is why the Torah wrote: והנה רבקה יוצאת, “and here Rivkah was already in the process of coming out, etc.” The word והנה means that what follows was the result of a special arrangement, invitation. If the servant immediately ran towards her (verse 17) it was because he had noticed the water of the well rising to meet Rivkah on her descent. This is what our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 60,5 have derived from the wording in our verses here. \n  At that moment Eliezer already understood what Avraham had meant when he had said to him that G-d would send His angel ahead. This is also what he related once he was in Bethuel’s house when he told the family that Avraham had assured him already before he set out on his journey that G-d would send His angel ahead and that he would succeed (verse 40). In view of this it is easy to understand that from the moment that Eliezer had become aware that the angel was supporting him the Torah refers to him no longer as עבד, servant, but as איש, a man of stature. Up until then we read about וישם העבד, “the servant placed;” ויקח העבד, “the servant took;” וירץ העבד, “the servant ran.” From this point on the Torah keeps referring to Eliezer as האיש until he leaves the house of Bethuel with Rivkah. The expressionהאיש is applied to the angel Gavriel in Daniel 9,21. It is also applied to the angel who told Joseph that his brothers had moved away from Shechem, (Genesis 37,17) and that they had been overheard as planning to move to Dothan. In other words, as of the time the angel joined Eliezer in his quest, he himself assumed the role of the angel in an executive manner. \n  The words והאיש משתאה לה (verse 21) which appear to be somewhat problematical if we assume Eliezer and the angel to have become as one, must be understood as “he was waiting for her;” he did so as he had become aware that his mission was about to be crowned with success. Having done so, the Torah from now on refers to him constantly as האיש, such as when we read (verse 22) ויקח האש, or (verse 26) ויקוד האיש, or (verse 30) כה דבר אלי האיש, etc. When, a little while later, Lavan and Bethuel gave their consent for Eliezer to take Rivkah (verse 51) and they said הנה רבקה לפניך קח ולך, “here Rivkah is in your presence, take her and go,” at which point Eliezer’s mission had been completed, the Torah reverts to describe Eliezer as עבד instead of as האיש. In verse 53 when Eliezer is reported as sharing out gifts, as well as in every subsequent move of his, the Torah speaks of העבד, “the servant,” seeing that the angel’s assistance was no longer required for that part of his activity. Avraham’s prayer which invoked the assistance of an angel had been answered in full. \n  If you were to ask that when Lavan and his mother asked Rivkah if she were willing to go עם האיש הזה, “with this man,” and this occurred only in verse 58, after verse 51 which we described as the point at which Eliezer’s mission had basically been completed, the answer is simple. The words reported in verse 58 were not spoken by the Torah but by Lavan and his mother. They certainly were not bound by the considerations we described before. How could they be expected to refer to someone as “this slave,” when the person in question was distributing lavish gifts to every member of their household, not to mention to Rivkah herself? Would it not have been a gross insult to their sister to ask her is she were willing to leave her parental home in order to travel to a distant land “with this slave?” \n  Concerning verse 61 in which both Rivkah and her maids are reported as traveling אחרי האיש, which appears to contradict the explanation I have offered that Eliezer had reverted to being an עבד the moment consent had been obtained for her to become Yitzchak’s bride, this wording was chosen by the Torah in honour of Rivkah. It would not have looked respectful if she had been described as riding “behind the slave.”\n  Another approach to the words והאיש משתאה לה. It is an allusion to the angel who had tarried and waited at the well until the arrival there of Rivkah. From that moment on Eliezer took over the task of the angel; hence he is referred to as האיש from that moment on. Support for this theory is found in the text near the end of the episode where the Torah said (verse 61) “they walked behind האיש, “and the עבד took Rivkah and he went.” This verse makes it crystal clear that the subjects איש and עבד respectively could not have been one and the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here is another answer to question from Dr. Itamar Warhaftig of The Bar Ilan University: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר אברהם אל עבדו זקן ביתו המֹשל בכל אשר לו שים נא ידך תחת ירכי (כד:ב).\n  מיהו העבד? בכל הפרשה לא נזכר שמו, אך בפרשת לך לך (טו:ב) נאמר:'ובן משק ביתי הוא דמשק אליעזר', ואם כן העבד הוא אליעזר. [1]\n  והנה בסיפור המעשה נקרא אליעזר פעמים בשם עבד ופעמים בשם איש:\n  ויאמר אברהם אל עבדו זקן ביתו המֹשל בכל אשר לו (כד:ב), וכן: שם:ה, ט, י, יז.\n  והאיש משתאה לה מחריש לדעת ההִצליח ה' דרכו (כד:כא), וכן: שם:כב, כו, כט, ל, לב.\n  ויאמר עבד אברהם אנכי (כד:לד), וכן: שם:נב, נג.\n  התלכי עם האיש הזה (כד:נח).\n  וישלחו את רבקה...ואת עבד אברהם (כד:נט).\n  ותקם רבקה ונערֹתיה... ותלכנה אחרי האיש, ויקח העבד את רבקה וילך (כד:סא).\n  ותאמר אל העבד, מי האיש הלזה... ויאמר העבד הוא אדני (כד:סה, סו)\n   מהי משמעות חילופין אלו בכינויו של אליעזר?\n  תחילה יש להציע שני כללים:\n  א)       יש הבדל מהותי בין עבד לאיש. עבד הוא אדם שאינו חופשי, משועבד לאחר, ממלא פקודות ואינו יוזם. ואילו 'איש' הוא לשון חשיבות. [2] אדם חופשי, חושב ויוזם.\n  ב)   יש שהכתוב מכנה אדם בשם זה או אחר מהיבט אובייקטיבי, אך יש שהכינוי מבטא נקודת מבט סובייקטיבית של הדמות המרכזית באותה פרשה. כך ייתכן שהמקרא יכנה אדם 'איש' או 'עבד' על פי האופן שבו רואה אותו הדמות שעליה נסב הסיפור באותו פסוק.\n  לאור כללים אלה נראה לנו להציע כי אליעזר עצמו הוא גם עבד - עבד אברהם, ממלא פקודות אדוניו, אך גם 'איש' - אדם חשוב, חושב ויוזם. תחילה הוא מופיע כ'עבד'; הוא עושה שליחותו ותו לא. אמנם הוא חופשי לבחור את הדרך שבה ימצא את מבוקשו, אבל הוא מוגבל לחפש אישה ממשפחתו של אברהם דווקא (\"כי אם אל ארצי\", פס' ג), והוא חייב להופיע כעבד אברהם. לכן הפרשה פותחת ב'עבדו', למרות שהוא גם זקן ביתו, המושל בכל אשר לו (פס' ב), והתורה ממשיכה לכנותו 'עבד' (פס' ה, ט, י, יז), גם כאשר הוא יוזם את המבחן. היזמה טפלה לעצם השליחות.\n  המפנה בא בפס' כא, \"והאיש [3] משתאה לה, מחריש לדעת\". כאן צריך איש שיודע להתבונן ולהתפעל, וגם לפעול על פי התרשמותו. זו אינה תכונה של עבד, לכן כאן בא לידי ביטוי האיש שבו. הוא עובר כביכול למישור אחר. רק \"איש\" \"מחריש לדעת הַהִצליח ה' דרכו אם לא\". ובאווירה זו הוא נותן את הצמידים, עוד קודם ששאל מי הנערה, [4] כי הוא חש שעומד הוא בצל ה', ובטוח במבחן שקבע להצלחת שליחותו. בהמשך, מובן שרק על 'איש' ייאמר, \"ויקד האיש וישתחו לה'\"; שם שמים שגור בפי איש ולא בפי עבד, שיש לו אדון אחר.\n  בפסוקים כט ו-ל, \"וירץ לבן אל האיש... כה דבר אלי האיש, ויבא אל האיש\", יש סיבה אחרת לכינויו של אליעזר \"איש\". כאן אליעזר מתואר כפי שהוא נראה בעיני לבן ורבקה. הם רואים אותו כאורח חשוב, אולי קרוב משפחה, שבא מרחוק.\n  אך גם לגופו של עניין רוצה המקרא להדגיש שלבן מתייחס אליו כאיש, ולכן יקשה עליו בעתיד לסרב לבקשתו. יתר על כן, אפשר שמשום כך לא סיפר אליעזר לרבקה מי הוא, כדי שיתייחסו אליו בכבוד, כאיש ולא כעבד. ואכן כך הוא מופיע בפניהם: \"ויבֹא האיש הביתה\" (פס' לב).\n  אבל כשהוא מתחיל לדבר, שוב בא מפנה: \"עבד אברהם אנכי\". [5] כלומר, אני חייב לספר לכם את האמת, עבד אני, אבל עבד אברהם, ובאתי כשליח אברהם, וכאילו אברהם עצמו נמצא כאן. וכאשר הסיפור מסתיים בהצלחה – \"הנה רבקה לפניך קח ולך\" (נא), באה חתימה כעין הפתיחה: \"ויהי כאשר שמע עבד אברהם\" (נב). מעתה חוזר אליעזר לתפקידו העיקרי כעבד אברהם, ולכן – \"ויוצא העבד כלי  כסף\" (נג). יתר על כן, כעת הוא נותן ביטוי לכך שגם רבקה היא גבירתו, ולכן הוא מצניע עצמו כעבד. ואולם לבן עדיין מתייחס לאורח כאיש, ושואל את רבקה: \"התלכי עם האיש הזה\", למרות שהוא יודע שהוא עבד אברהם, אם בגלל המתנות שהביא, ואם בגלל הרושם האדיר שהשאיר עליהם.\n  אמנם בפסוק נט – \"וישלחו את רבקה אחֹתם... ואת עבד אברהם\" - יש לעיין מדוע כונה כאן עבד, והרי בעיניהם הוא איש? אלא שכאן גובר הכלל שהבאנו כטעם שני בהסברנו לעיל על פסוק נג; כאן רבקה היא גיבורת הסיפור, ההולכת עם מינִקתה, ועם העבד, שעומד להיות גם עבדה. [6] אבל רבקה עצמה מכירה בכוחו של האיש, ובעיניה הוא עדיין איש: \"ותלכנה אחרי האיש\" (סא). אך בעיני עצמו הוא נתפס כעבד, גם כעבד אברהם וגם כעבד יצחק ורבקה כאמור, ולכן – \"ויקח העבד את רבקה\" (שם).\n  כשרבקה רואה את יצחק, יצחק הוא האדון, ואליעזר הוא עבד: \"ותאמר אל העבד... ויאמר העבד... ויספר העבד\" (סה-סו); בנוכחות יצחק חוזר אליעזר להיות עבד.\n  פתחה הפרשה בעבד וסיימה בעבד, ובאמצע תיארה אותו כאיש, לפי הנסיבות.<br>\n  [1] ראה יומא כח, ע\"ב: \"אליעזר עבד אברהם זקן ויושב בישיבה היה, שנאמר 'ויאמר אברהם אל עבדו זקן ביתו המֹשל בכל אשר לו'. אמר ר' אלעזר שמושל בתורת רבו\". וראה תרגום יונתן בן עוזיאל כאן ורש\"י לפס' לט.\n  [2]    ראה שמ' א:יא ופירוש דעת מקרא שם. על חשיבותו של אליעזר ראה הערה קודמת.\n  [3]   וכבר עמדו על כך בעלי התוספות על התורה ( תוספות השלם , הוצאת מכון אריאל, בעריכת הרב י' גליס, ירושלים, תשמ\"ג) וזה לשונו:\"עד השתא קורא לו עבד ועכשיו איש. נ\"ל מייד כשהצליח דרכו נתחזק לאיש מלחמה. אבל כשנכנס לבית לבן עשה עצמו עבד מפני כבודו של אברהם\".\n  [4]     ראה רש\"י שם: \"לאחר שנתן לה שאלה, לפי שהיה בטוח בזכותו של אברהם שהצליח הקב\"ה דרכו\".\n  [5]   הגמרא בבבא קמא צב, ע\"ב מביאה לימוד כללי: \"מנא הא מילתא דאמרי אינשי מילתא גנאה דאית בך קדים אמרה...דכתיב ויאמר עבד אברהם אנכי\".\n  [6]   שמעתי גם פרוש הלכתי האומר כי משמסר האב בתו לשלוחי הבעל היא נחשבת נשואה, ראה כתובות מח, ע\"ב, ואם כן אליעזר נהיה גם עבדה של רבקה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

For the answers might be deeper than you might imagine!\" ... (<em>someone important said that</em>)</p>\n<p>R' Tzvi Dermer once taught me an important lesson: the famous Mishna in Peah (1,1) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אֵלּוּ דְבָרִים שֶׁאֵין לָהֶם שִׁעוּר. הַפֵּאָה, וְהַבִּכּוּרִים, וְהָרֵאָיוֹן, וּגְמִילוּת חֲסָדִים, וְתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה.\"</p>\n<p>These are the things that have no measure: Peah, Bikurim, the appearance-sacrifice, acts of kindness, and the study of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Those are only the Mitzvos that have no measure. But there's something bigger that has no measure and is not even explicitly mentioned in the Torah - <strong>the Midos (the basic human traits). This is the realm that the whole Torah is based on (as it says \"דרך ארץ קדמה לתורה\") but it has no measure</strong>.</p>\n<p>The two things you've mentioned are Midos and have no Shiur and that's the basis for your confusion. Here's another example - How long do you have to study Torah in one day? Can you add a minute, two, five, an hour at the expense of your sleep or your work? How do you balance between respecting your parents by taking care of them and taking care of your wife and kids? All of those decisions are Midos that precede the practical Mitzvos you perform and have no defined measure.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>NB: <em>Interestingly, Rambam wrote a lot of them in Hilchos Deot that practically starts the whole Seder of his Mihsnah Torah, but all the future Poskim, incl. the Mechaber did not see any special importance in Midos and either omitted it completely or mentioned some of them elsewhere in Shu\"A.</em></p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "History of chattan & kallah classes",
    "content": "# History of chattan & kallah classes\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A common practice in some segments of today's Jewish world is for brides and grooms to attend \"Chattan/kallah classes\" where the attendees receive instruction and advice on relationship dynamics and intimacy (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/18707/15571\">here</a> for more info.).  It has become so popular that one who does not attend such classes prior to marriage is looked upon with a raised eyebrow and, depending on the individual's circles, met with objection.</p>\n\n<p>I am curious if a study has been done tracing the inception of this practice or if any readers can shed light on it. </p>\n\n<p>I am <em>not</em> asking for reasons why it began (exposure -or, lack of- to \"the way of the world\"; social influences etc.). I'm only interested in early documented sources or anything indicating its inception. As for the implications of such a study, that too is beyond this question. </p>\n\n<p>(My research: this practice isn't older than a few decades.) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Based on the book \"Halachos of Niddah\" by Rabbi Shimon D. Eider (first published in 1981), the origin of the modern Chassan and Kallah classes began shortly after the Holocaust. Historically, mothers would teach their daughters the relevant Halachos shortly before they were married. Unfortunately, after the Holocaust, there were many orphans who did not have anyone to learn the Halachos from, so formal 'classes' were established to fill this crucial function left in the wake of the destruction.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there were a large number of people who came from irreligious families who were Chozer B'Teshuva, who could also not learn the Halachos from their family. The Teshuva phenomenon likely also added to the popularity of Chassan and Kallah classes.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, it is likely that Chassan and Kallah classes became popular around the 1950's-1960's.</p>\n\n<p>(Note that the question asks about classes that give \"instruction and advice on relationship dynamics and intimacy\". The main focus of the Chassan and Kallah classes are to learn the rules of Taharas Hamishpacha, per the linked question, but it's very likely that parts of the 'course material' evolved to include \"instruction and advice on relationship dynamics and intimacy\" due to the related subject matter. However, the main focus and intent of these classes is to teach the laws of Taharas Hamishpacha)</p>\n\n<p>Quote from the book (from the preface, pages xvi-xvii):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>During the period of the <em>Rishonim</em> and even until recent times,\n  daughters were taught by their mothers, the responsibility of Jewish\n  womanhood. Tradition was transferred - in the home - from generation\n  to generation. The halachos themselves, the severity of their\n  violation and the need to ask a Rav were inculcated in the hearts of\n  Jewish women by their mothers.[…]</p>\n  \n  <p>The years of the holocaust and the upheaval it caused cast a gap in\n  the Jewish family. Mothers, who would have otherwise instructed their\n  daughters, perished at the hands of the latter day Amalek. As a\n  result, their daughters lost this vital link in the chain of\n  tradition. As a result, their daughters lost this vital link in the\n  chain of tradition.[…] In addition, we are blessed, nowadays, with the\n  new phenomenon of women […] who, through their own awakening, yearn to\n  observe these mitzvos impeccably. Therefore, in many Jewish\n  communities, this responsibility has been transferred or assumed by\n  Yeshivos for girls, kallah classes, and individual instruction by\n  Rebbetzins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Using modern electronic devices (refrigerators, air conditioners, digital water meters) on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishmereth Hashabbath institute in Israel has published a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/57552\" rel=\"noreferrer\">booklet</a> which claims that using many modern electronic devices (refrigerators, air conditioners, digital water meters) are highly problematic on Shabbat. To give some examples of issues they describe</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>refrigerators have chips that register door openings and even very small temperature changes triggered by door openings and closings</li>\n<li>modern air conditioners (e.g., inverters) also continuously measure temperature to adapt the strength of the engine and opening doors/windows will trigger electric changes</li>\n<li>digital water meters (replacing manual meters to save operating costs at utility companies) use electric signals to measure water used in houses</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They have halachic approvals from serious rabbis (e.g., R Yosef Shalom Elyashiv, R Chaim Kanievsky, R Nissim Karelitz, R Aharon Leib Steinmann, R Shmuel Wozner) and explicitly write that one cannot rely on <em><a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=199&ArticleID=55\" rel=\"noreferrer\">grama</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/23529/what-exactly-is-psik-reisha\">psik reisha d’lo nichale</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p>The solution they propose is to disconnect all “smart features” of refrigerators and air conditioners and have them work in “fixed manual mode” on Shabbat by installing special devices. Regarding digital water meter, they recommend asking for alternatives or, if not feasible, using private water tanks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At the same time, many observant people I know use devices normally (except for removing light bulbs). What is the halachic basis and on whose <em>poskim</em> do these people rely?</strong> (for instance R Moshe Feinstein or R Yisroel Belsky were known for delving deep in technological issues before ruling on new developments - I’d be interested in opinions of similar <em>rabbanim</em> who combined their <em>halachic</em> expertise with technical knowledge they acquired).</p>\n\n<p>PS. I am naturally skeptical of (1) claims like these from people who offer/sell the services to fix the issue they created and (2) signatures of <em>gedolim</em> who might or might not have studied the issue in depth, and might rely on technical claims they do or do not understand</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The disagreement with these devices(disregarding light bulbs in fridges or fans in ovens, at the moment) is whether grama or pesik reisha d'lo neicha lei are permitted on shabbat; assuming we accept the notion that using these devices on shabbat do not contain the issue of boneh, makeh b'patish, bishul, or mav'ir(see Yechave Da'at 1:32; Tzitz Eliezer 6:6; Minchat Yitzchak 3:38; Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchatah 1:28 & 29, and Minchat Shlomo 10 and p. 81).</p>\n\n<p>There are poskim that forbid both grama(see Rama and Bi'ur Halacha 334:22) and pesik reisha d'lo neicha lei on shabbat(see Mishna Berura OC 321:57, Magen Avraham 314:5, Har Tzvi OC 1:151, Chelkat Ya'akov 3:179; and Minchat Yitzchak 2:16, among others) while there are poskim that permit them in certain cases(see Yabia Omer OC 1:27, and Minchat Shlomo 91:10, and the Tzomet institute among others).</p>\n\n<p>Those that use the above-mentioned devices without special certification seem to be doing so by relying on the lenient sources that permit them.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that R' Auerbach ztz\"l was an expert on electricity and shabbat and was among the first to study the issues in depth.</p>\n\n<p>For sources and cited sources, see links below:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=198&ArticleID=697\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=198&ArticleID=697</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/opening-refrigerators-on-shabbat-by-rabbi-howard-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/opening-refrigerators-on-shabbat-by-rabbi-howard-jachter</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/journal/broyde_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/journal/broyde_1.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

When opening the gate between the end of the stairs and the street, I noticed a car was parked opposite the house, engine running and its lights were very helpful to light up the path coming down the stairs. Since this is Israel, I assume the driver was a non-observant Jew.</p>\n\n<p>Is this creating an issue of profiting from forbidden work on Shabbat? Should I have closed the door to avoid that light until the car had left?</p>\n\n<p>Does it make a difference if we would have been able to come down the stairs anyway (and the car light only made it more convenient) or if it would have been more risky to do so without light?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See Yalkut Yosef Shabbat 318:40 and Shabbat 3 page 62 that describes a similar situation where a guest in a building on shabbat noticed that a Jew turned on the lights in the hall and permitted walking regularly because he could do so without the light that was turned on by the Jew. However, he wrote that one who is stringent, tavo alav habracha.</p>\n\n<p>See below:</p>\n\n<p>המתגורר בבית דירות שיש בו שכנים שאינם שומרי תורה ומצוות, ואחד השכנים הדליק את האור בליל שבת בחדר המדרגות, מותר לעלות במדרגות, ואינו צריך להמתין עד שהאור יכבה, או לעצום את עיניו. ואף אם השכן עשה זאת במזיד במיוחד לצורך שכנו שהוא שומר תורה ומצוות, גם בזה מותר לעלות במדרגות, שהרי גם בלא האור היה יכול לעלות במדרגות. ובלבד שלא ימהר בהליכתו, וגם לא יעשה איזה דבר הנצרך לאור, וכגון לבדוק את מפתח הבית מתוך יתר המפתחות שבצרור, כדי שלא יהנה ממלאכת שבת. והמחמיר על עצמו להמתין עד שאור החשמל יכבה, כדי שלא ייראה הדבר כחילול ה' שיהודי שומר תורה ומצוות נהנה מחשמל שהודלק באיסור בשבילו, תבוא עליו ברכה. [ילקו''י שבת כרך ג עמוד סב] </p>\n\n<p>However, I personally have a problem with this because seeing better is a tangible benefit of melechet shabbat. I would feel more comfortable closing my eyes and holding the railings while walking slowly to reject any benefit. I'm sure there may be cholkim on this psak(specifically among the European poskim); however, one who wished to rely on it surely has what to rely on. </p>\n\n<p><em>Please note that this hora'ah may not apply to other cases of chilul shabbat.

Please focus only on the differences of the meanings only as it applies to this verse.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You might have guessed based on recent questions of this sort that I would turn to my favorite <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1583304312\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew</a>, from the writings of Rav Hirsch. </p>\n\n<p>On page 108, there is an entry for the root יצב, which he translates as “erect; stand firm independently.” The applications he brings are: standing firm and upright (as in our passuk, נצבים); to erect (ויצב שם מזבח, Bereishis 33:20); to endure (יצב גבולות עמים, Devarim 32:8); a memorial (מצבה, Devarim 16:22); a pillar (נציב מלח, Bereishis 19:26); a military position (ויצב מצב פלישתים, Shmuel 1:13:23); and the stem of a tree (בשלכת מצבת בם, Yeshaya 6:13).</p>\n\n<p>Compare this to the root עמד on page 187, translated as “stand in preparation to act.” Some applications parallel those of יצב above: enduring (ויכלת עמוד in Shemos 18:23), a pillar (עמוד ענן, Shemos 13:21), a station (והדפיתיך ממצבך וממעמדך יהרסך, Yeshaya 22:19; note that יצב is also used here), and ordinary standing (ולא עמד איש אתו, Bereishis 45:1); then there are those which are very different: stopping (ותמיד מלדת, Bereishis 29:35), sustaining (למען יעמדו ימים רבים, Yirmiya 32:14), raising (ויעמד רוח סערה, Tehillim 107:25), and receiving strong support (אם יהיה אלקים עמדי, Bereishis 28:20). </p>\n\n<p>In other words: יצב means standing firmly planted, with no intention of going anywhere; עמד means standing at ready, preparing to act. </p>\n\n<p>I think it is clear that the word נצבים in our parshah comes to indicate this when you consider that Moshe is passing them into a covenant. While a covenant is a commitment for the future, it’s more precisely a state of resolve - that is, one who is accepting a covenant is <em>standing firm in resolution</em> of accepting the agreement, rather than standing at the ready to fulfill the agreement. (Don’t believe me? The same dictionary on page 32 defines ברת as “to separate, highlight.”) </p>\n\n<p>Rashi’s Midrashic explanation (placed after his comments to v. 12) give another layer of meaning to this choice of words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עַד כַּאן פֵּרַשְׁתִּי פְּשׁוּטָה שֶׁל פָּרָשָׁה. וּמִדְרַשׁ אַגָּדָה: לָמָה נִסְמְכָה פָרָשַׁת אַתֶּם נִצָּבִים לַקְּלָלוֹת? לְפִי שֶׁשָּׁמְעוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל מֵאָה קְלָלוֹת חָסֵר שְׁתַּיִם חוּץ מִמ\"ט שֶׁבְּתוֹרַת כֹּהֲנִים, הוֹרִיקוּ פְנֵיהֶם וְאָמְרוּ מִי יוּכַל לַעֲמוֹד בָּאֵלּוּ?! הִתְחִיל מֹשֶׁה לְפַיְּסָם — אתם נצבים היום, הַרְבֵּה הִכְעַסְתֶּם לַמָּקוֹם וְלֹא עָשָׂה אִתְּכֶם כְּלָיָה וַהֲרֵי אַתֶּם קַיָּמִים לְפָנָיו:</p>\n  \n  <p>Until here have I explained the simple meaning of the passuk. This is the Midrash Aggadah: Why was Nitzavim placed next to the curses? For when Yisrael heard the 98 curses, plus the 49 from Sefer Vayikra, their faces became sickly, and they said, “Who can withstand this?!” Moshe began to appease them: “You are standing today” - you have angered Hashem very much, but He has not destroyed you; behold, you are still extant before Him!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this explanation (my translation), it’s much clearer that the intention is to underline their standing firm today, not their outlook onto tomorrow. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>From something I wrote many years ago</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The answer may lie in an unusual word choice – nitzavim. Had the torah wished to make a physical statement about where we were, it could have used a more common “omdim” for standing. Instead, it used a less common and more puzzling term.  The word nitzavim is related to a few other concepts, each of which brings something new to the fore in its application the bnei yisrael. The baal haturim connects it to the statement made earlier in the chumash, by har Sinai “vayityatzvu tachtit hahar” (shmot 19:17) and it is thus deduced that all bnei yisroel were at this pronouncement as they were at the matan torah – the ones who were not there physically were there spiritually (resolving the apparent contradiction – as all were “nitzavim” standing in that same spiritual sense, but the text adds that it applies to those who were not physically there “with us”). But the word does more than that.</p>\n\n<p>Nitzavim is connected to the Hebrew concepts of matzeva, a testimonial pillar, matzav, a general atmosphere, approach or attitude and nitzav, an appointed official (in fact, the commentator known as the netziv has a name which means both “pillar” and “prefect” or “governor”). When we look at why bnei yisroel were there and what their task was, it is clear that they had to be nitzavim and not just passively omdim.  Hashem was designating the Hebrews for a task; they were to stand as an eternal symbols of His dominion and wishes for tikkun olam and they were to act as a light unto the nations, appointed to be spiritual torchbearers.  This is no easy job and if they just “stood” there while being told, there would be little value in the pronouncement. They and we were not standing around, but being erected for all to see and be led by. We were the matzeva being built, the pillar for others to recognize, and we were being appointed as guardians over our behavior and examples of the appropriate matzav towards living in the world. While we were not all physically “standing” there that day to hear the words and therefore had to be explicitly told that we were included, we were there in spirit. And while we might try to excuse ourselves and absolve ourselves of the responsibility of kiyum hamitzvos, Hashem made clear that we are all recipients of an eternal charge on that spiritual level that goes beyond acceptance of law and moves into the establishment of the Jew as a fixed point, established as a guidepost for humanity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains the meaning of the use in the first pasuke of Nitzavim <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9993#v=9&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">29:9</a> that the difference between the two words is a matter of the strength and effort being put into the standing. It emphasizes that the Bnai Yisrael have survived the 40 years in the desert and all the suffering that they had undergone from the slavery of Mitzraim on to being about to enter the land. It also emphasizes that Bnai Yisrael from now and into the future (to and past our day) will survive and maintain the Torah and the service to which we committed ourselves at Har Sinai No matter what trials and tribulations we undergo, we will be able to maintain ourselves <em>נצבים</em>. Not just passively <em>עומדים</em> but actively as a מצבה for the glory of Hashem and His torah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אתם נצבים</strong>, (the root) יצב (a strong form of ישב with the צ sound) does not designate like עמד just the standing position. It is standing\n  firmly, energetically, and puposefully. The תנחומא on our verse\n  explains in a charateristic manner, the use of this term here instead\n  of the usual עמד, which indeed is also used in V.14. In spite of all\n  the unspeakable suffering depicted you are still נצבים, remaining\n  upright and firm. They can all pass over your head, you outlive them\n  all. In Ch.XXXII,23, it says <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9996#v=23&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חצי\n  אכלבם</a>\n  (\"Mine arrows will I expend on them\" I.L.) חצי כלין והן אין כלין (\"I\n  will use up all My arrows against them but they will not be used up\"\n  I.L.) Yea the very sufferings themselves are a means for your enduring\n  because they ensure your betterment. הן מעמידות אתכם וכן הוא אומר למען\n  ענותך לנסך וגו (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9972#v=2&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ch\n  VIII,2</a>).\n  And also <strong>אתם נצבים</strong>: Ye are those that remain! I depart, Joshua\n  too, to whom I hand you over, will also depart, an so also the leaders\n  who will follow in generation after generation, they all depart, and\n  the nature of the leaders changes -- only you, the Nation is immortal,\n  undying, remaining, in it the spirit to which Hashem has entrusted the\n  perpetuity of His work is inherited, and in service of that spirit\n  every leader enters. The Nation is the מצבה. the eternal pillar of His\n  Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are four other references using the word נצבים each of which shows the force of the standing. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#v=2&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeirah 18:2</a> has the mal'achim actively <em>standing directed towards him</em> (as Rav Hirsch translates it). This shows the force of their standing there to attract his notice. Also note that in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#v=8&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeirah 18:8</a> it uses עמד which Rav Hirsch translates as <em>waited on them</em> showing the passive usage of standing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8240#v=1&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayigash 45:1</a> Yosef's attendants are actively standing ready to carry out his commands.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9866#v=20&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 5:20</a> when Moshe and Aharon leave Par'o after their unsuccessful meeting, men are standing to confront them.

    "title": "With what and why did Ya’akov struggle?",
    "content": "# With what and why did Ya’akov struggle?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many times I came across teachings which stated that Ya’akov Avinu wrestled (struggled) with what could be described as something representative of Esav (I.e. Edom, Adam); of which it is said it was the Yetzer Hara (of which it’s said that it’s equal with Satan and the Malach HaMavet). </p>\n\n<p>So what I would like to know is what’s the common denominator between all these titles? And secondly why was it that Ya’akov had this struggle; where did it originated from? </p>\n\n<p>After so many struggles why did Ya’akov Avinu had this specific one that led to a change in his essence, a change of name? What evil evolved into something he had to overcome? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As Levi points out in comments above, there are many interpretations of who was the wrestler against Yaakov. I want to try and offer an interpretation as to why Yaakov had to struggle and what we can learn from it. This is starting from an idea of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, much of the rest a personal interpretation. It is a bit long, treat it as a <em>dvar Torah</em> if you are interested.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell I will argue that Esav/his angel/Amalek/Satan fought with Yaakov to break him, and disconnect the three worlds which Yaakov was connecting: the world of thought, the world of feelings and the world of action. Once Yaakov won the struggle, he became called Yisrael - Yashar El - the \"straight of Hashem\". By connecting the three, Yaakov is the role model of what a Jew should be - and Esav/Amalek/etc. fought this. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I start with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.25?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.32.25&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> (on Bereshit 32:25) who brings the midrash (Bereshit Rabba 77:3) and tells us the angel was the angel of Esav. As we know, at the end of the fight, the angel hits Yaakov at the hip and leaves.</p>\n\n<p>In a second encounter between Yaakov and Esav, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.33.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 33:4</a>), Esav \"kisses\" Yaakov. Since the word וַׄיִּׄשָּׁׄקֵ֑ׄהׄוּׄ is written in the Torah with six dots, our Sages tell us (Bereshit Rabba 78:12) not to read the word from kiss (<em>lenashek</em>) but from bite (<em>linshokh</em>). The Midrash tells us Esav wanted to bite Yaakov at the neck - but by miracle Yaakov’s neck turned into marble - therefore וַיִּבְכּֽוּ Esav wept as he broke his teeth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did Esav or his angel attack Yaakov and hit him at the neck and at the hip? Why especially at these places, why not in the head and in the stomach?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I find a hint to these elements earlier in the parasha when Yaakov prepared for his encounter with Esav. Rashi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.9?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.32.9.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32:9</a>) tells us Yaakov prepared through gifts, prayer and war. Prayer (<em>avoda she balev</em>) from the heart (the world of feelings), gifts from his head (the world of thinking) and war through his legs (the world of action).</p>\n\n<p>This is the way of Yaakov. He feels, he thinks and he acts. Not just that but all three are connected with each other and with Hashem. As the passuk says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר֮ יַעֲקֹב֒ אֱלֹהֵי֙ אָבִ֣י אַבְרָהָ֔ם וֵאלֹהֵ֖י אָבִ֣י\n  יִצְחָ֑ק יְהוָ֞ה הָאֹמֵ֣ר אֵלַ֗י שׁ֧וּב לְאַרְצְךָ֛ וּלְמוֹלַדְתְּךָ֖\n  וְאֵיטִ֥יבָה עִמָּֽךְ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Then Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father\n  Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, ‘Return to your native land and I will\n  deal bountifully with you’!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yaakov connects his actions to the mission Hashem gave him. You Hashem asked me to return  to my land, the land of Israel. I am now here facing a challenge . So help me, show me the way and I will do three things: with my heart, with my head and with my feet.</p>\n\n<p>Yaakov was an <em>ish yashar</em> - Hashem intentions for man flowed through his mind , his heart and his legs. Maybe for this reason we call Sefer Bereshit - Sefer Hayashar. </p>\n\n<p>What was the new name of Yaakov after these encounters? Yisrael = Yashar El - the one who is straight with God.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now we understand better why Esav attacked Yaakov in this particular way</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>first the angel of Esav hit him at the hip to separate the world of feelings  from the world of action</li>\n<li>second Esav’s bit  him at the neck to separate the world of thinking from the world of feelings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Whether Esav is Amalek or the  the Yetser Hara in all of us (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/94538/11501\">Kli Yakar Bereishit 32:25</a>), he is trying to disconnect us from our father in Heaven. The one who tells us</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>you know enough, there is no need for mitsvot</li>\n<li>you are a good person, you have good intentions, there is no need for mitsvot</li>\n<li>you are doing good already, you know enough, there is no need to learn more</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Esav tries to disconnect our thinking from our feelings from our actions.</p>\n\n<p>And Yaakov is showing us what it is to be a \"straight Jew\". Someone who is connected to Hashem at all times and someone who aligns  all his thoughts, feelings  and actions  with Hashem’s will. Someone who is a channel to bring the will of Hashem into the world.</p>\n\n<p>Why did all of this happen to Yaakov? Why didn’t he fight Avraham or Yitzhak? R Elchonon Wasserman tells us something brilliant. What did Abraham represent? Hesed. Yitzhak? Yira or Tfila. Yaakov? Torah.</p>\n\n<p>That is why the yetezer hara chased Yaakov. It isn’t that <em>Hesed</em> and <em>Tefila</em> aren’t important, but other people have them as well. But it is the Torah which separates us from other nations. It is the Torah, or Halakha, that translates the will of Hashem into the actions of Man. Halakha (from <em>lalekhet</em>, to go) is the world of action/of our feet as a translation from the will of Hashem into the world.</p>\n\n<p>Now how does Yaakov’s story ends (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.33.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">33:18</a>) ?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיָּבֹא֩ יַעֲקֹ֨ב שָׁלֵ֜ם</p>\n  \n  <p>Yaakov came out intact</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Intact, that is straight. Yaakov held his way and from this he gave all of us (<em>maase avot siman lebanim</em>) the potential to be like him, to connect our minds, our hearts and our actions to Hashem, do the things which are right as the verse in Dvarim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:18</a>) tells us</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְעָשִׂ֛יתָ הַיָּשָׁ֥ר וְהַטּ֖וֹב בְּעֵינֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה</p>\n  \n  <p>Do what is <strong>right</strong> (straight) and good in the sight of the LORD</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Similarly, Rema (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.19.1?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD §19:1</a>), upholding the opinion of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Suslin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aggudah</a>, rules that it is permissible to ritually slaughter an animal (i.e. the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>shechitah</em>) in an unclean setting, though the prescribed blessing should be recited beforehand in a clean place. It would seem from these sources that a <em>mitzvah</em> without speech may be performed in an unclean setting.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Ovadia Yosef</a>, in a responsum about tithing <em>Terumah</em> and <em>Ma'asrot</em> in an unclean setting (Yabia Omer vol. 6 YD §29), also marshals the Yerushalmi in Demai and suggests to prove that one may indeed tithe in an unclean setting as well. Additionally, he cites other authorities who permitted various biblical <em>mitzvot</em> to be performed in an unclean setting basing themselves on this Yerushalmi. However, he initially objects to equating a biblical <em>mitzvah</em> (tithing Terumah or, as in our case, listening to <em>shofar</em>) which requires intent (cf. Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.60.4?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC §60:4</a>), and forbidden to do so in an unclean place (cf. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.24b?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ber. 24b</a>), to a non-biblical or only preparatory <em>mitzvah</em> (<em>shechitah</em>, deconsecration of <em>Demai</em> etc.) which, according to some authorities, does not require intent.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, R. Yosef concludes that since many authorities, including some Geonim, maintain that even biblical <em>mitzvot</em> do not require intent one should therefore rely on this opinion and perform a <em>mitzvah</em> in event of extenuating circumstances and will not have another chance at appropriately performing the given  <em>mitzvah</em>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><em>Mesoras Moshe</em> (volume I, page 181), by R' Moshe Feinstein's secretary, says someone asked Rav Moshe what to do if hearing it while in the bathroom. He said to not intend to fulfill the mitzvah, as doing so would be like thinking about Torah; all you need to hear is 30 sounds, so most likely you can miss that bunch and catch another bunch at some other part of davening.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It is the same as kriat shema and shouldn't be heard(since he would be fulfilling a mitzvah d'oraita if it's the first time he heard it on Rosh Hashana and is intending to be yotze) and is required to hear it again(see Rama in Shulchan Aruch OC 85:1 and 65:1 and the Ba'er Heitev 2 ibid. that brings the opinions of Maharam Mintz in siman 85, Bach, and Magen Avraham that being in an unfit place has the status of oness). </p>\n\n<p>Although the simanim sourced above were written with regards to kriat shema, I don't see why it wouldn't apply to hearing the shofar since they are both on the level of d'oraita; nor do I know of any shut'im dealing with this question.</p>\n\n<p>There are places, however, that it may be heard(like the kriat shema; see Shulchan Aruch OC 84).</p>\n\n\n",

(The Artscroll Machzor adds two other greetings, for a group of men - תכתבו ותחתמו - and for a group of women - תכתבנה ותחתמנה - though I don’t have an earlier source that expands this idea to number in addition to gender. I think the logic holds anyway.)</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem to me that regarding כתיבה וחתימה טובה, it would be fine to use whatever wording you want, regardless of how many people or of what gender they are to whom you’re extending the blessing, at least according to the Kitzur. </p>\n\n<p>That said, if you want to be grammatically correct anyway, even if it doesn’t matter...</p>\n\n<p>The reason the Rosh Hashanah night greetings are conjugated the way they are - by changing the gender and number of the verb to reflect the audience - is because you’re using verbs (תכתב ותחתם). In the common Elul greeting, the formulation uses nouns instead (כתיבה וחתימה), and nouns almost never switch between gender depending on the audience (there are exceptions, but those are few and far between, and I believe they only exist in Biblical Hebrew, not medieval and certainly not modern). While adjectives <em>do</em> change gender in addition to number, that’s to reflect the noun they’re modifying; they don’t change to reflect the audience directly. Therefore, you only have to worry about the number, and as such, you would change it the way you suggested in the question - כתיבות וחתימות טובות, regardless of the gender of the audience. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Grammarly, you always use a single noun to greet multiple people, like \"נסיעה טובה\" not \"נסיעות טובות\" (source - the contemporary Israeli Hebrew)</p></li>\n<li><p>It IS a mistake to use two nouns and single adjective, like in \"אושר ועושר גדול\", instead you should say \"אושר ועושר גדולים\". (source - the contemporary Israeli Hebrew)</p></li>\n<li><p>Some say, that when the greeting was issued some 200-300 years ago (besides a possible mistake) the original intention was to emphasize that כתיבה and חתימה constitute one act and not two, so it should be read \"[The act of] (Ktiva veChatima) Tovah\" (source - Koylel talks).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Whatever is accepted by someone is rejected by someone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Halachah is always offered, but not accepted.</strong> A single Rabbi, can state that he rules it so or so, but nothing turns automatically into Halachah until people start practicing it. And we judge it, pretty much, statistically. </p>\n\n<p>Rambam wrote his Mishnah Torah but it was not widely accepted immediately, so the writing does not turn it into Halacha. HaTur wrote the 4 Turim but it wasn't accepted, but when R' Karo copied it, it became \"the de-facto\" Halachah pretty arbitrary, it could be the other way around, as it happened to many other good Seforim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So it is a matter of a \"luck\" whether a ruling will or will not be accepted by the wide audience or the other Rabbis</strong> (that rule wide audiences).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>You're not [probably] like what I'm gonna say but it must be said:<br>\n<strong>Judaism is all about following Rabbis and their \"subjective truths\" and not about following [some kind of ] \"the absolute objective truth\"</strong>. Here are the reasons why the Halachah looks as it is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Unlike the science that's goal is to find the <strong>empirical truth</strong> (as we don't care who discovered the formula or proved a theorem as long as it works), in Judaism, we follow <strong>the opinions of single Rabbis</strong> implying that that's the truth. </p></li>\n<li><p>Besides the belief that the Rabbis are guided by the Ruach Hakodesh (the Rabbies deny themselves) there's no way of the empirical testing the validity of any argument. So, theoretically, a Rabbi can utter any ruling without anyone being able to refute it. Here's a simple test for you: find a Machloket in the Gemmorah and see if you can refute the opposite resolution of a dispute (the factual Halachah). If you can't it is just as valid as the actual one.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are hundreds of ruling Rabbis, and there's no pre-defined way of who we follow in what questions. This is the way of the Talmud: in one Halachah, we follow R\"A, in another R\"Y, or Rabbah or Chahamim (anonymous) or Ravinah or R\"Ashi or whatever (some try to set rules post-factum though). Who did Rambam follow? How did the Mechaber decide on the three to rule by Majority - is there such a principle in our Halachah? How did Mishnah Berura decide on his sources - who he follows? </p></li>\n<li><p>The punchline - <strong>whoever thinks that the purpose of learning Torah (and Halachah as you ask) is about finding the truth is wrong.</strong> It is all about \"engaging in learning Torah\" (as we say the Beracha \"לעסוק בדברי תורתך\"). To prove that is enough to remind you that the Sanhedrin was [presumably] functioning till the late Amoraim and ALL the disputes of the Talmud could be easily ruled in court, but they didn't use that tool, they preferred the disputes and inconsistencies, and personification of the Halachah instead of unifying and streamlining it. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(<em>Did you see any Gdol Hador trying to unite other Gdoylim to prevent disputes or the opposite? (Here in Israel we have a joke about a Photoshopped virtual \"Mizrach\" where different Gdoylim (like R' Ovadia and R' Elyashiv and R' Kanyevsky and R' Auerbach Z\"L) sit together by one table - which is only good for Kapparot on Rosh Hashonah).</em>) So they all inherently endorse the diversity and variety of Rabbis and opinions, for it gives us the opportunity to continue that approach further. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Therefore we end up with a fabulous, legendary and incredible culture of following [arbitrary] traditions.</strong> There's no logical reasonable explanation and necessity of most of the current Mishnah Berurah or Shu\"A. For example, women wobble Lulav with/without Berachah - can we refute if it was prohibited? Women don't put Teffilin - can we refute if they were obligated (Based on R' Akiva in Eruvin 98-99)?</p>\n\n<p>But, as I said in #4, cheer up, if we're given the reward just for mere engaging in all those fights and disputes, and if that's the G-d's will - that's just fine, as the final Rashi in the Ecclesiastes - \"מה שתוכל עשה ולבך לשמים\"!!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some afterthoughts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><sub>The Rabbis that deal with Halachic rulings, pretty much all of them are (unfortunately for me) are very inconsistent and non-systematic, following the format of our Scriptures and the Rabbinical books (Mishnah and Gemmorah) that are also very much inconsistent and non-systematic. </sub></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><sub>Take for example the way of commanding the Mitzvot in the Torah: First, there's no clear understanding of what substitutes a Mitzvah in the Torah, Second, there's no fixed formula for a Mitzvah: some are direct (Don't murder), some indirect (Bney Israel will not eat גיד הנשה), some are given in single (honor your parent)some in plural (fear your parent), some detailed (Lost and Found) some only hinted (Works on Shabbos), some only once (Teffilin) some numerous times, some before Matan Torah (פרו ורבו) and some after etc. </sub></p></li>\n<li><p><sub>The Mishnah and the Gemorah follow the same vagueness, having no clear system of principles of how the Halachah is ruled (some tried to formulate it post-factum but it is not widely accepted). Sometimes it follows one Rabbi sometimes another - just a matter of chance.</sub></p></li>\n<li><p><sub>Take for example Rambam's Mishnah Torah. Each Mitzvah is phrased differently, bringing different sources, sometimes citing whole Gemmorahs and sometimes not relying on the Gemmorah at all. There's not even a clear definition of what a Mitzvah is, as for example in Hilchos Krishma he starts with: \"Twice a day [we] read Krishmah\", not mentioning it's a Mitzvah at all, but 3 lines further he states \"it is a Mitzvah to remember the Exodus at night\", not mentioning that actually it is not a Mitzvah at all (he doesn't count it in his 613)</sub></p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><sub>And the list goes on and on.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Jewish Pets in Halacha\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why do such few religious homes have dogs? \nThe Torah speaks often about how important it is to have rachmanus on animals. We are living in a time where millions upon millions of dogs are being housed in shelters every year & due to lack of resources many of these sweet animals are killed every single day. Is there something that I’m missing? Are there halachic problems with owning a dog that I’m unaware of? Why is it considered taboo in the frum world to save a dog’s life? Is there a single Orthodox Rabbi that advocates for saving these innocent animals?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><strong>Because God is compassionate on all his creatures, we have a number of laws that make keeping domestic animals complicated</strong>. By acquiring an animal, one acquires a master, for instance</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>one should feed animals before eating oneself (see e.g., <a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/parsha/feeding-your-animals-first/2015/10/15/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)</li>\n<li>one needs to avoid any pain to animals (<em><a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/meaning-in-mitzvot/tzaar-baalei-chayim/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tzaar baalei chaim</a></em>)</li>\n<li>On Shabbat, some consider domestic animals to be <em>muktzeh</em> so they may not be moved by hand</li>\n<li>One cannot pray in a place where there is an odor of animal waste</li>\n<li>One needs to compensate others for damages caused by one's animal</li>\n<li>One cannot castrate an animal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So it is <strong>because</strong> we are commanded to respect and care for animals that many Jews elect not to have them.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Judaism place higher value on human than animal life. So in a world where so many suffer from hunger and poverty, a Jew should first save a human life or alleviate human suffering before the ones of animals.</p>\n\n<p>For detailed references, see e.g., <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/halacha/jachter_1.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ethical-treatment-of-animals-in-judaism/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/daily-living/35-Animals-and-Pets.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">there</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Mbloch's answer is a good one and it is quite thorough. However, I can see that some readers may infer a sense of \"laziness\" from that answer, so I wish to present the \"opposite\" view that, I think, shows a sense of consideration. I will demonstrate by actual example:</p>\n\n<p>A while ago, one of my kids wanted a dog. I adamantly refused based on scheduling. The question I posed my kid - \"Who will take care of the dog? Feed it and walk it, mainly?\"</p>\n\n<p>Why did I think this couldn't be done?</p>\n\n<p>When the day begins, he rushes in the morning to get dressed, brush teeth, etc. get lunch and verify school supplies, with my supervision and he better be on that bus on time b/c I have to leave for work, too. No time to feed the dog or walk it, then.</p>\n\n<p>Yeshiva day ends about 6 pm, and when he gets home, he needs an hour to clam down from the hectic day, eat, and do homework and get to bed so he's not tired to function the next day. And, frequently, his parents (wife and I, that is), get home late, ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>In short - no one has time to feed or walk the dog, no matter what anyone intends. And what I mention is quite typical in religious households. Jewish religious daily activity is extremely busy and hectic. I won't even delve into what it's like for a woman or man (I do most of the cooking and Shabat shopping these days, instead of my wife) to prepare for Shabbat in the kitchen with Spot running around, barking or whining.</p>\n\n<p>In actuality, if you had a dog, you would be mistreating, and neglecting it. So, avoiding the problem by not owning one is, in a way, a <em>chessed</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

It has helped sustain us as a kind, harmonious, & loving nation for over 3,000 years & has helped introduce the Golden Rule to mankind. </p>\n\n<p>Do the commentators explain if this command has any restrictions? I assume it doesn’t apply to those that are openly rebelling against HaShem or the Jewish Nation, but what about Bnei Noach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The answer is in the passuk itself: “lirayacha” - your fellow, which always comes to include all Jews.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam makes this point explicitly in De’os 4:3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִצְוָה עַל כָּל אָדָם לֶאֱהֹב אֶת כָּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל כְּגוּפוֹ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ויקרא יט יח) \"וְאָהַבְתָּ לְרֵעֲךָ כָּמוֹךָ\".</p>\n  \n  <p>It’s a commandment on every man to love everyone from Yisrael like himself, as it says, “And you should love your fellow like yourself.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the term “fellow” includes converts as well; in the words of the Rambam in the very next Halacha:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַהֲבַת הַגֵּר שֶׁבָּא וְנִכְנָס תַּחַת כַּנְפֵי הַשְּׁכִינָה שְׁתֵּי מִצְוֹת עֲשֵׂה. אַחַת מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוּא בִּכְלַל רֵעִים וְאַחַת מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוּא גֵּר וְהַתּוֹרָה אָמְרָה (דברים י יט) \"וַאֲהַבְתֶּם אֶת הַגֵּר\".</p>\n  \n  <p>Loving a convert who comes and enters under the wings of the Shechinah is two positive commandments: one because he is included under “fellows” and one because he is a convert, and the Torah says, “You should love the convert.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, non-Jews, even those who have accepted the seven Noahide laws, are not included in this commandment, as they are not considered your “fellows.” </p>\n\n<p>Further, the Smag (Asei 9) adds, based on Pesachim 113, that even among Jews, one is not obligated to love his fellow if his fellow is a wicked person; to the contrary, it’s a mitzvah to hate him. (Do <em>not</em> try this at home without the proper guidance - everyone sins, not everyone is a wicked person. It’s beyond the scope of this article to discuss who is considered a wicked person that one should hate.)</p>\n\n<p>By the way, this is the general usage of “your fellow” in the Torah - while anything in this post could be prohibited by other Biblical or Rabbinic laws, when the Torah says that you should not stand by idly on your “fellow’s” blood, it refers to a Jew specifically (Sefer HaChinuch 237); the prohibition against coveting your “fellow’s” property is limited to a Jew’s (Sefer HaChinuch 38). </p>\n\n<p>It seems that the prototype for this usage is Shemos 2:13: “Why are you hitting your fellow?” While Rashi translates this in the context of the passuk (“a wicked person like you”), we see that “your fellow” indicates someone like you - in these cases, someone who is Jewish. I do not have a source for this final point, but in my humble opinion, this would seem to be the source for these rulings. (If I am correct, perhaps it can be argued that while a righteous Jew shouldn’t love a wicked Jew, a wicked Jew must love another wicked Jew.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is indeed how Sefer HaChinukh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.243.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mitsva 243</a>) understands it</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To love [with] love of the soul <strong>each one of Israel</strong> - meaning to say\n  that we have compassion for an Israelite and for his money, [just]\n  like a person has compassion for himself and for his [own] money; as\n  it stated (Leviticus 19:18), \"you shall love your neighbor as\n  yourself.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and the Rambam (MT <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910346/jewish/Deot-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Deot 6:3</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Each man is commanded to love each and <strong>every one of Israel</strong> as himself\n  as [Leviticus 19:18] states: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As R Yitzchak Ginsburgh <a href=\"http://www.inner.org/responsa/leter1/resp22.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Jew is commanded to respect all human beings. The Torah prohibits\n  any negative behavior toward a non-Jew, so long as he is not an enemy.\n  He is instructed, however, not to become too close a companion to him.\n  <strong>Thus the above verse, veahavta l’reyacha kamocha, “You shall love your\n  neighbor as your self”, does not imply a universal neighbor. To be\n  honest with the text, the parenthetical “a fellow Jew” must appear.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This commandment applies even to a Jew having been condemned to death, the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.51a.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Baba Kama 51a</a> writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Naḥman says that Rabba bar Avuh says that the verse states: “And\n  you shall love your fellow as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), teaching\n  that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, select a good, i.e., a\n  compassionate, death for him. Therefore, the structure used for\n  stoning is constructed sufficiently high that he dies quickly, without\n  any unnecessary suffering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(see also similar passages in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.37b.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ketubot 37b</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.75a.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pesachim 75a</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Bnei Noach are all righteous non-Jews, by definition they do not belong to \"your brother\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>TL;DR the verse includes only Jews in good religious standing</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This is an excellent question, but it should be clarified that is is also significantly limited: there are dozens of commandments and restrictions guiding interpersonal relationships and obligations that a Jew might have towards his fellow man, and all of these might have different definitions of who is included or not. Thus, for example, the prohibition of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury#Hebrew_Bible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">usury</a> (lending money with interest) only prohibits Jews from lending to other Jews with interest, but deceiving someone is biblically prohibited for both Jews and non-Jews (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ritva_on_Chullin.94a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according to most</a>). Even in multiple cases where the Torah uses the same word, <em>רעיך</em>, there might be differences based on the context. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ben_Asher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachayei</a> writes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Shemot.20.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to Ex. 20:13</a>) that one is prohibited to bear false witness against a non-Jew, even though the Torah uses the term רעיך, your fellow. </p>\n\n<p>The question here is: who is included in \"fellow,\" or רעך in the Biblical command to \"love your fellow\", in Lev. 19:18? </p>\n\n<h2>Non-Jews</h2>\n\n<p>Despite the teachings of the Christian gospel, rabbinic Judaism unanimously understands that רעך, or \"your fellow\" refers specifically to fellow members of the nation of Israel. The Sifra (primary halakhic midrash) comments on that verse that converts to Judaism are also included as learnt out from a later verse in the chapter (Lev 19:34), but the implication is clear that those who are not Jewish are excluded. Thus, Maimonides codifies the rule as follows (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1206n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Deot Ch 6</a>): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִצְוָה עַל כָּל אָדָם לֶאֱהֹב אֶת כָּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל כְּגוּפוֹ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ויקרא יט יח) \"וְאָהַבְתָּ לְרֵעֲךָ כָּמוֹךָ\"\n  It is incumbent upon every person to love each and every member of Israel as himself, as it says 'you shall love your fellow as yourself' (Lev. 19:18)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Sinners of Israel</h2>\n\n<p>Commenting on the above-quoted statement of Maimonides, the <a href=\"http://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php/%D7%94%D7%92%D7%94%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">author of Hagahot Maimoniot</a> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&rtype=%u05E6%u05D5%u05E8%u05EA%20%u05D4%u05D3%u05E3&hilchos=2&perek=6&halocha=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here, bottom left column</a>) writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[the command to love someone] only applies to he who is \"your fellow\" in Torah and commandments; but [towards] a wicked person who does not accept rebuke it is a <em>mitzvah</em> to hate him</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and to bolster this halakha the author quotes two verses and references a passage in Pesachim (113b), which may actually indicate that there is a talmudic dispute but the passage is not so clear. Either way, Hagahot Maimoniot's position is shared by <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Vayikra/19.18#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam (to Lev 19:34)</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Mitzvot_Gadol\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Semag</a> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Mitzvot_Gadol%2C_Positive_Commandments.9.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>aseh</em> no. 9</a>), and R. Yitzhak Arama (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Akeidat_Yitzchak.23.1.8?vhe=Akeidat_Yitzchak,_Pressburg_1849\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akeidas Yitzchak Lev no. 23</a>). </p>\n\n<p>However, not everyone agrees that sinners should be excluded from \"your fellow\" whom 'you must love as yourself.' In a fascinating comment, R. Meir Abulafiah explains that the Mishnah assumed that the command to \"love your fellow\" applies even for the wicked who are sentenced to death because</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש לפרש ואהבת לרעך לשון רעים שבך\n  one can interpret \"love your fellow\" [<em>rei'ekha</em>] as \"the wicked among you\" [<em>ra'-im shebekha</em>]  (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yad_Ramah_on_Sanhedrin.52b.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramah to Sanhedrin 52</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some have also believed this to be the position of Maimonides, though it is hard to tell for certain. According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Schick\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharam Shik</a> (Taryag Mitzvot 244), the halakha is in accordance with the view that one's \"fellow\" in this context does include a sinner.</p>\n\n<h2>Non-Believing and \"Secular\" Jews</h2>\n\n<p>The entire discussion regarding Jewish <em>sinners,</em> however, refers specifically to those Jewish people who believe in God, are part of the Jewish community, but are known to engage in certain prohibited behaviors for whatever non-ideological reason. However, those who do not believe in the principles of faith <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/93638/5083\">are generally assumed</a> to have <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/7775/5083\">lost their status as full-fledged members of the nation</a> (in certain ways). Maimonides thus writes in his intro to the 10th Ch. of Mishnah Sanhedrin regarding believing the principles of Judaism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכאשר יהיו קיימים לאדם כל היסודות הללו ואמונתו בהם אמתית הרי הוא נכנס\n  בכלל ישראל וחובה לאהבו ולחמול עליו וכל מה שצוה ה' אותנו זה על זה מן\n  האהבה והאחוה ואפילו עשה מה שיכול להיות מן העבירות מחמת תאותו והתגברות\n  יצרו הרע הרי הוא נענש לפי גודל מריו ויש לו חלק והוא מפושעי ישראל וכאשר\n  יפקפק אדם ביסוד מאלו היסודות הרי זה יצא מן הכלל וכפר בעיקר ונקרא מין\n  ואפיקורות וקוצץ בנטיעות וחובה לשנותו ועליו הוא אומר הלא משנאיך ה' אשנא\n  וכו (Qafih translation) </p>\n  \n  <p>And when a person upholds all these foundations, and his belief in\n  them is true, he enters into the group of Israel and it is <strong>an\n  obligation to love him</strong>, and to have compassion for him, and all that\n  Hashem commanded us regarding love and brotherhood for each other. And\n  even if he has done what can be of the sins due to his desires and the\n  overpowerment of his evil inclination, he will be punished\n  commensurate to the greatness of his rebellion but he still has a\n  portion and he is of the sinners of Israel. But when a person doubts\n  one of these foundations he has left the group, and denied God, and is\n  called a sectarian and a heretic and a cutter of shoots, and <strong>it is an\n  obligation to hate him</strong>, and of him it is said \"do I not hate those who\n  hate you, Hashem?\"\n  (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/90558/5083\">taken from here</a>; thanks Alex)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Someone who does not believe in Judaism, therefore, is not included in the Jews' obligation to love each other. This is also true of those who are 'secular' Jews, who do not follow the commandments out of ideological principle (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.158\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulhan Arukh, Y.D. 158:2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.55.46\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 55:46</a>, among many instances) and perhaps even those who are simply completely indifferent to the Jewish religion (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.608.2.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biur Halakha to 608:2</a>, though this is less clear. The vast majority of rabbinic authorities do NOT propose implementing the harsh treatments against such people mentioned by Maimonides or the Shulhan Arukh (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/48853/5083\">here</a>), but Maimonides' statements regarding loving and hating them still stands. </p>\n\n\n",

But outside of the five scrolls and the psalms, Artscroll does not provide an interlinear translation for the rest of the books of the Tanakh, and I could not find any other Jewish sources for a printed interlinear publication.</p>\n\n<p>What is available is an interlinear \"old testament\" from a Christian publisher using the ESV (English Standard Version) translation. From the online sample I've seen, the translation is very literal in a way that will aid in my language learning, and also from what I've seen so far, avoids overly Christianizing the text.

I'm not used to thinking of myself as some kind of narrow-minded xenophobe, but who knows?</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody else have experience with this particular interlinear translation (<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1433501139\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.amazon.com/Hebrew-English-Interlinear-ESV-Testament-Stuttgartensia/dp/1433501139</a>), and any advice on whether it would be an acceptable volume for a Jewish reader? Any suggestions on other interlinear or at least dual language (Hebrew-English) translations that would be helpful? I have the Artscroll dual language Yehoshua, but the English and Hebrew often do not line up on the same part of the page and sometimes not even on the same page at all, so it's less useful to me at this point than I was hoping.

He lived during the time of semicha, and his responses are often Rabbinic in nature. And so this begs the question, could Jesus have been a Rabbi who received semicha?</p>\n\n<p>Note: I know there is plenty of evidence that Jesus as a person might not have existed.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Jesus's actions as reported by his followers indicate that he said some kind of brachot on bread and wine. This indicated familiarity with some aspects of the Oral Law. At one point he is even recorded as stating that the laws established by the Rabbis must be obeyed, although he later often contradicts these laws and argues about them (which of course indicates he was familiar with them).  Therefore, it seems possible that he was a talmid of one of the Rabbis before turning to unorthodox beliefs. But there is no evidence that he received smicha and he certainly was never a dayan. </p>\n\n<p>As to being called 'Rabbi' he is referred to in this way by his followers, who of course had accepted him as their teacher, which is what \"Rabbi\"'s meaning is. In those days Rabbi was not a formal title (note that none of the Zugot and few of the early Tannaim are called by any title, even in the Gemara). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Certainly possible; wouldn't make much of a difference from our perspective. The Talmud talks about <em>a</em> \"Yeshu HaNotzri\" who started off as a student of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachiah; there's plenty of discussion as to how that story relates to the Jesus known to most of the world. But the Talmud's telling of that story really doesn't dwell on how far along in his studies he was, whether he had received semicha at that point or not. It seems we don't particularly care.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Elisha ben Avuyah almost certainly had semicha at some point (if he taught Rabbi Meir), but the Talmud, in retrospect, doesn't use the honorific \"rabbi\" about him because he eventually became an apostate. So the fact that the Talmud calls him \"Yeshu\" and not \"Rabbi Yeshu\" doesn't prove that he didn't have semicha at some point. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi was a Jewish title of respect and meant 'master, teacher', but it was not known to be used until the time of Herod the Great around B.C. 37. \"Rabbi\" was applied to Jesus (Yeshua) and was often translated 'master' in the A.V. of the Christian Bible (Mark 9:5; 11:21; 14:45; John 1:38, 49; 3:2, 26,; 4:31; 6:25; 9:2 and 11:8). Jesus (Yeshua) forbade that his disciples be called\"Rabbi\", for one was their Master, even Christ (Messiah). Matt. 23:8. According to the Jews, the levels of honor went from \"Rab\" to \"Rabbi\" and, lastly, to \"Rabban\" or \"Rabboni\". Jesus the Christ (Messiah) was so recognized by the blind man who sought  after him: \"Jesus answered and said to him, 'What do you want me to do for you?' The blind man said to him, 'Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.' Then Jesus said to him, 'Go your way; your faith has made you well.' And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road\" (Mark 10:51-52).</p>\n\n\n",

This seems like a contradiction.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.29b.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 29b</a>) suggests that <em>the remembrance of shofar blasts</em> refers to Rosh Hashanah that falls on Shabbos. The Gemara infers that this would be a Torah prohibition. There are questions on this suggestion, and it is subsequently rejected. Blowing the shofar on Shabbos RH is merely a rabbinic prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>What was the <em>hava amina</em>, initial understanding, that it would be a Torah prohibition? Why would it be forbidden? What kind of prohibition would it have been? The Gemara states it's not a <em>Melacha</em>. Would it have been a new <em>Melacha</em>? Or a side prohibition, like having your animal rest?</p>\n\n<p>I'm asking not just from the <em>Hava Amina</em> but from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Rosh_Hashanah.18b.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi</a> which makes the same suggestion as above to resolve the verse, and makes no mention of a rabbinic prohibition.

I heard the same fact in the name of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Simcha_of_Dvinsk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Meir Simcha</a>. It sounds like the Yerushalmi sees it as a Torah prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also wondering about the Biur HaGra. The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.582.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 582:6</a>), following the above Gemara that even though it's a rabbinic prohibition, the verse implies that there is no shofar on Shabbos, says to mention זכרון תרועה in the prayers. The <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2943\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biur HaGra</a> when writing the source of this halacha, says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רא\"ש סוף ר\"ה וגמרא שם כט ב' <strong>ועי' בירושלמי שם</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Rosh at the end of Rosh Hashanah, and the Gemara there 29b. And <strong>look at the Yerushalmi there</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why is the Gra pointing to the Yerushalmi? He's letting you know it holds its a Torah prohibition? He holds its a Torah prohibition? Something else? Why mention it in a halacha about prayers. I looked at the Damesek Eliezer there and he wasn't so clear to me.

There would have been a Gezeira not to do a Shvus (incase somone will fix a shofar or bring it through a Reshus Harabim which is a melacha) which is a Seyag on Melochos deoraisa but since there is an Asmachta of \"yom Terua,\" this means that Shofar overrides Shabbos only if it is 100% sure its Rosh Hashana i.e in Yerushalayim where the begining of the month is fixed. (Just like Mila overrides shabbos Bayom Hashemini though that is Deoraisa)\nOutside Yerushalayim however where they are not sure if it is Rosh Hashana they can't blow the shofar in safek and the passuk \"zichron terua\"applies which is an Asmachta of not blowing the Shofar. So Rava in the Bavli 29b holds of the Braisa of Rashbi Quoted in the Yerushalmi and There is no opinion that says Shofar cannot be Blown min Hatorah.</p>\n\n<p>As for the Damesek Eliezer Ohr Sameach i did not see them so i do not know what they mean. I am just trying to bring enlightment on the Terms of the Yerushalmi that they do not litterally mean Deoraisa Shofar should overide Shabbos because Shofar is a Shvus as explained By Mirkeves Hamishne</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here's the Yerushalmi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גמרא ר' אבא בר פפא א\"ר יוחנן ורשב\"ל הוון יתיבון מקשיי אמרין תנינן י\"ט\n  של ר\"ה שחל להיות בשבת במקדש היו תוקעין אבל לא במדינה אין דבר תורה הוא\n  אף בגבולין ידחה אין לית הוא דבר תורה אף במקדש לא ידחה עבר כהנא אמרין\n  הא גברא רבה דנישאול ליה.  אתון שאלון ליה אמר לון כתוב אחד אומר (במדבר\n  כט) יום תרועה וכתוב אחד אומר (ויקרא כג) זכרון תרועה הא כיצד בשעה שהוא\n  חל בחול יום תרועה בשעה שהוא חל בשבת זכרון תרועה מזכירין אבל לא תוקעין.\n  ר' זעירה מפקד לחבריי' עולון ושמעין קליה דרבי לוי דרש.  דלית איפשר דהוא\n  מפיק פרשתיה דלא אולפן.  ועל ואמר קומיהון כתוב אחד אומר יום תרועה וכתוב\n  אחד אומר זכרון תרועה הא כיצד בשעה שהוא חל בחול יום תרועה בשעה שהוא חל\n  בשבת זכרון תרועה מזכירין אבל לא תוקעין.  מעתה אף במקדש לא ידחה תנא\n  (שם) באחד לחדש.  מעתה אפילו במקום שהן יודעין שהוא באחד לחדש ידחה.  תני\n  רשב\"י (שם) והקרבתם במקום שהקרבנות קריבין.  אמרין חבריי' קומי ר' יונה\n  והכתיב (ויקרא כה) והעברת שופר תרועה בחדש השביעי וגו' אמר לון זו את\n  מעביר בארצכם הא אחרת לא.  אמרין ליה או נאמר זו אתם מעבירין בארצכם הא\n  אחרת בין בארץ בין בח\"ל.  א\"ר יונה אילו הוה כתיב תעבירו שופר בארצכם\n  הייתי אומר כאן מיעט ובמקום אחר ריבה אלא בכל ארצכם כאן ריבה ובמקום אחר\n  מיעט:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, the Yerushalmi doesn't just use the Pesukim of Zichron Teruah and Yom Teruah as a <em>Asmachta</em> (Suggestion), it actually uses it as a <em>Mekor</em> (source), in that the Yerushalmi asked on those Pessukim why Shofar is only blown on Shabbos במקדש in the Beis Hamikdoshand not במדינה the rest of Eretz Ysroel cause based on those Pessukim there shouldn't be a difference, and answered:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תני רשב\"י (שם) והקרבתם, במקום שהקרבנות קריבין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>R.

Taken in this way, then, the three words שבתון זכרון תרועה can be understood as follows: שבתון, when Rosh Hashanah occurs on the <em>Shabbos</em> day, on which all work ceases, זכרון, be sure to <em>remember</em> that it is Shabbos, and then תרועה, you will be able to <em>blow</em> the shofar without fear of violating the holy day. And the opposite is also implied: if you are apt to forget Shabbos or its laws, do not blow the shofar. Thus <strong>the Torah’s phraseology already suggests the concern expressed by Rabbah,</strong> which eventually the Sages found prevalent enough to issue a sweeping prohibition against blowing the shofar on Shabbos.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the “remembrance” may be taken to refer to the rules and techniques of shofar blowing, yielding a somewhat different understanding: when Rosh Hashanah occurs on <em>Shabbos</em>, if you <em>remember</em> how to blow and are not in need of instruction by an expert, then you may <em>blow</em>, but otherwise you may not. On this reading <strong>the verse is drawing a distinction between the expert and the non-expert, banning the latter from sounding the shofar on Shabbos, out of fear that in his eagerness to do the mitzvah he will inadvertently desecrate Shabbos by carrying</strong>; the Sages, then, simply extended this ban and made it more universal, thereby safeguarding the sanctity of Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Does Jewish scripture give any advice on how to ease the pain? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><em>This site talks in general terms - we don't give private bits of advice</em>.<br>\nLet's pretend it's a family we're talking about, because if it's not - the case is out of the scope of Judaism (see below).</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>As you're rightfully mentioned love is not obligatory in the Jewish family, it might be a nice bonus, but nothing one can't keep a Kosher family without.</p></li>\n<li><p>Torah already speaks of such an example (in my understanding) in Lea - Rachel - Yaakov love triangle case, where Lea sought Yaakov's love and he loved Rachel.

We saw examples of such a feeling many times in the Tanach (Yaakov met Rachel the first time, David and Bat Sheva, Amnon and Tamar and more) but as we've seen, the outcomes might be very dangerous if one only follows his guts. Therefore we come back to #4 - put in on hold and prepare for the big move.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n\n<p>This is my view of the Jewish view, for what it is worth. </p>\n\n<p>Unrequited love is a test: nothing more and and nothing less. It is a test of whether we still love G-d and believe in His goodness even when He seems to deny us something precious to us. </p>\n\n<p>To lose love -- to lose anything or anyone that lit up our soul, that resonated with us so individually as to affirm who we were -- demands a hard reckoning with the meaning of our lives. As at each of the times in life when we lose important things, we are weakened and evacuated. We are sobered to the point of shame. We are sent to the trenches and forced to recalculate, to reappraise. </p>\n\n<p>There, in the trenches, we meet G-d. And we confront, as after the death of a loved one, the mutability of absolutely everything--a most terrifying, most lonely truth. Eventually we learn slow, important, eternal things -- that the refuah preceded the disease and will supersede it; that the Source of what we lost is bigger than what we lost, and can and will yield more of the same light, and will do so abundantly and visibly for us and those we love, for long years. </p>\n\n<p>And so we decide to live on. Life feels as if it begins again, that we must start over with nothing. But we do and we do bravely. The Holy One, Blessed be He, takes pleasure in our effort to find more life and more light in life, and more of the hidden holy Light that is in fact still everywhere. He answers, at that moment, with a silent promise to take away our pain. At that moment we pass the test. </p>\n\n\n",

So why the trial? Let Him announce the verdict without needing a trial.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In Jewish mysticism, the Kabbalah introduces the idea of tzimtzum, which literally means “constriction”.  It teaches that God “constricted” his infinite essence to create an independent world.  This constriction made free will possible, and allowed people to earn their entry in the World to Come.  The implication is that, by this constriction, God does not know what people will choose, much as the inventor of a board game involving dice does not know the outcome of a game, even though he created it and made the rules that govern it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think you misunderstand what, exactly, is going on this week. </p>\n\n<p>It’s important to remember that everything we say about Hashem is, at best, a metaphor. It’s axiomatic that we can’t describe Hashem accurately, so we describe Him in ways that make it more tangible to us. The problem with this approach is that it leads to some absurd conclusions if you take the metaphor too literally, this question being a case in point. </p>\n\n<p>As another case wherein this pitfall occurs: take Bamidbar 28:1, which describes the Karbanos Temidim as “My bread.” Can you really think that the Omnipotent Creator of the Universe needs <em>us</em> to feed <em>Him</em> twice a day for Him to survive - and to feed Him a measly lamb for each meal?! The meaning behind this particular metaphor is beyond the scope of this answer; my point is that when describing G-d, you have to use metaphors, and you have to recognize that they’re not accurate. </p>\n\n<p>Back to the Aseres Yimei Teshuvah. We describe Hashem as a Judge, with the team of prosecutors arguing for our death, c”v, and the team of defenders arguing for our life. There’s several books open before Him, some for life, some for death. We daven for ourselves, and we plead that we end up in the Books of Life. </p>\n\n<p>You ask a very strong question: why bother with this whole charade? Hashem knows if we will do Teshuvah, so why hold court to begin with? </p>\n\n<p>Let me try to answer this question by broadening it. Why daven for anything, since Hashem will just give us what’s best for us, anyway? Because taking such an approach completely misses the point of davening. </p>\n\n<p>I’d like to begin with the famous Gemara in Yevamos 64a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר יצחק מפני מה היו אבותינו עקורים מפני שהקב\"ה מתאוה לתפלתן של צדיקים</p>\n  \n  <p>Says R’ Yitzchak: Why were our forefathers infertile? Because Hashem desires the prayers of the righteous. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At first blush, this is a terrible thought. It almost implies c”v that Hashem is some egotistical maniac who is going to punish people just so he gets what he wants. Since he wants people to cry out to him, he makes them suffer. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously that’s not correct. So what does this Gemara really mean?</p>\n\n<p>Hashem wants to have a relationship with us. That’s the entire purpose of Creation - as the Derech Hashem (ch. 1) puts it: G-d wants (there’s another metaphor) to do good, therefore He created a world and the perfect creation upon which to bestow good. Given that He is the ultimate perfection, what better gift is there than a connection with Him?</p>\n\n<p>This point is borne out by another Gemara about davening, this one in Yoma 76a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאלו תלמידיו את רבי שמעון בן יוחי  מפני מה לא ירד להם לישראל מן פעם אחת בשנה  אמר להם  אמשול לכם משל  למה הדבר דומה למלך בשר ודם שיש לו בן אחד  פסק לו מזונותיו פעם אחת בשנה ולא היה מקביל פני אביו אלא פעם אחת בשנה  עמד ופסק מזונותיו בכל יום והיה מקביל פני אביו כל יום אף ישראל מי שיש לו ארבעה וחמשה בנים היה דואג ואומר  שמא לא ירד מן למחר ונמצאו כולן מתים ברעב נמצאו כולן מכוונים את לבם לאביהן שבשמים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To summarize this last Gemara: Why did the <em>man</em> fall every day in the Midbar, instead of once a month, or once a year? The Gemara poses a mashal: A king gives his son a stipend once a year. But doing so means he only gets to see his son once a year. By giving him his stipend once a day, the son must come every day. So, too, the Jews: by constantly being concerned for the next day’s food, they will constantly be davening to Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>Hashem doesn’t just punish us randomly, because He’s an egotistical maniac. He punishes us because He loves us. He wants to have a connection with us. We don’t (or at least shouldn’t) daven because we need things, but rather we should daven because we want to connect with Hashem, and the Berachos will follow. </p>\n\n<p>It’s the same deal on the Yamim Noraim, just scaled up a bit. Why bother davening for our life, when He already is going to give us what we have earned? Because He wants us to daven, to connect with Him. And what better time to connect than the time described as “Seek out Hashem when He can be found, call out to Him when He is close” (RH 18a, from Yeshaya 55:6)? The picture of judgement is only a metaphor - after all, is Hashem a human judge who can be swayed? </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This is based on the Torah of my Rosh Yeshivah, Rabbi Yochanan Zweig, Shlit”a. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can you stand for the whole service?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During services, sometimes we sit and sometimes we stand, depending on the prayer.  For some prayers we are required to stand: Amidah (as its name implies), Shofar, Bar'chu, Alenu, etc.  But are we ever required to sit?  Can someone stand for the duration of the service, or would he be breaking some laws?</p>\n\n<p>All I recall is a commentator saying that we sit during Ashrei because it says \"Ashrei yoshvei betecha -- Happy are those who dwell in your house\".  When you are in your house, you relax, sit down and kick up your shoes.  But he did not say you HAVE to sit during Ashrei.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch writes \"[Tachanun is performed] seated\" (OC 131:2). In his Beis Yosef, he explains that “according to the understanding of scholars of Kabbalah” one should be particular to sit during Tachanun. </p>\n\n<p>However, preceding that line in the Beis Yosef, he quotes the Rivash as saying that it doesn’t matter whether one stands or sits. Based on this dispute, the Mishnah Berurah (131:10), quoting “the Acharonim,” rules that in a pressing circumstance, one may rely on the Rivash and say Tachanun standing; for instance, if one finished davening, and the Tzibbur began saying Tachanun before the requisite amount of time before one takes his three steps forward, he should put his head on his arm while still standing. Likewise, if he’s unable to sit because of where the next guy over is still saying Shemoneh Esrei, he should say Tachanun standing. </p>\n\n<p>In summary: According to the Shulchan Aruch, Tachanun should be said seated. According to the Rivash, Tachanun would not answer your question. According to the Mishnah Berurah, Tachanun <em>usually</em> qualifies, but not always. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Shachter quotes Igros Moshe <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/726345/rabbi-hershel-schachter/lesser-known-laws-of-torah-reading/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discussing</a> haftorah  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"It is not permissible for one to stand for the Keriah in a Shul where\n  the custom is to sit...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, a friend mentioned to me that he davened in a sefardi shul which was stringent to require everyone to sit during krias hatorah.

Likewise, \"<em>American Eel (Anguilla Anguilla) is known to have scales that could be 'kosher' if not for the fact that they are deeply embedded into the skin.</em>\"</p>\n<p>A very cursory search of the internet does not seem to present much evidence that the superficially scale-like features of the Lepidoteuthis grimaldii correspond to the requirements of the rishonim and achronim for <em>qasqeseth</em>.  For example, the \"soft-scaled\" squid is <a href=\"https://pfeil-verlag.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/SPIX_40_1_03_ES.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">described</a> more recently as having a \"<em>distinctive hexagonal shaped dermal cushion, formerly called 'scaled', that covers the mantle except for the posteroventral part under the posterior half\nof the fins.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_dermal_structures\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> (at the time of writing) cites scientific sources describing the rare squid's \"scales\" more precisely as dermal cushions that do not sound like they would be any more likely to meet the requirements of <em>qasqeseth</em> than would the scales of sharks and eels:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The overlapping \"scales\" of Lepidoteuthis grimaldii are actually dermal cushions with a vacuolate internal structure that are continuous with a similarly vacuolate underlying layer of mantle tissue... Structurally very similar (though non-overlapping) dermal cushions are found in Pholidoteuthis adami. It has been proposed that these two species achieve buoyancy by means of the fluid stored in their vacuolate dermal cushions and upper mantle layer. Given their spongy form, these cushions may also play a secondary protective role.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, I'm not clear why this particular squid's dermal cushion should be any more a candidate for <em>qasqeseth</em> than that of less rare species.  I'm not personally aware of any source that requires the the scales overlap, which seems to be the seemingly non-halachic, distinctive feature of this particular squid. (Notably, the verse actually seems to require only one scale.)  Ultimately, it seems that the Ramban's additional general guideline (id) that kosher aquatic life are found near the surface remains unchallenged by this deep sea-dwelling cephalopod.</p>\n<p>(It seems worth noting as well that describing the fins of the Grimaldi \"scaled\" squid as <em>snapir</em> presupposes that tailfins qualify.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jewishlinknj.com/food/26386-i-can-t-believe-it-s-not-treif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

And therefore Yisroel would have never been able to make it to the times of Moshiach (where this question is taking place) because Yisroel would have been utterly destroyed one way or another. But all other holidays, which are referenced as a remembrance to bondage in Egypt, can be removed because Yisroel could have been eventually redeemed from there to the times of Moshiach. Thus survival wasn’t dependent on them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכך שני הימים האלו אשר הם באים על שהש\"י מציל אותנו מן הכליון לגמרי הן מצד הגוף הן מצד הנשמה לא יהיו בטלים כי שאר המועדים אפשר הבטול להם מפני שהם זכר ליציאת מצרים ואף אם היו עוד משועבדים במצרים היו באחרונה נגאלים לכך אפשר להם הבטול אבל אלו שני המועדים שהם באים על שהש\"י הציל אותנו ונתן לנו השארית והמציאות לא יהיה דבר זה בטל לעתיד כי אם לא היו אלו שתי גאולות הן גאולה מצד הגוף והן גאולה מצד הנפש היה כאן אבוד לגמרי ולא היה כאן גאולה אחרונה שתהיה לימות המשיח ולכך אלו שני ימים לא יהיו בטלים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/noazAyhfjJU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak botton</a> from hidabroot gives an amazing answer. </p>\n\n<p>In the rest of 'The people were saved stories' there were still casualties. However in the story of purim no casualties were there because He was with 'Each One's of us. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Another suggestion I'd heard (is this Chabad?) -- the early Biblical, laws-of-nature-bending miracles (e.g. the Passover story) will pale in the face of newer laws-of-nature-miracle-bending miracles. But Purim is an entirely different sort of miracle, one that camouflages itself within the laws of nature. </p>\n\n\n",

The Shulchan Aruch says that “some hold” that we apply Gud Asik (extend the roof down to the ground) in such a case (§6). Problem is, the Mishnah Berurah says that we don’t hold of that opinion (§31). So we need a plan B, even though that actually requires some effort.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The Relevant Halachos</h2>\n\n<p>Your post makes it sound like you are somewhat familiar with Hilchos Sukkah; I will briefly summarize the relevant halachos for those who are less familiar but also want a portable Sukkah. </p>\n\n<p>A Sukkah officially requires at least three walls, but it’s really two walls plus a tefach (§2-5).</p>\n\n<p>The Mechaber makes a specific note regarding using trees as walls - as long as they’re sturdy enough not to move in an ordinary wind, or they’re tied down sufficiently to accomplish the same, they’re perfectly fine (§10), though there’s a dispute as to how tree branches affect the Sukkah beneath them (SA OC 626:2) that must be taken into account. If you don’t have any trees suitable, remember that the walls can be made from anything, though the Rema limits it to things which will not cause a foul odor (§1). </p>\n\n<p>As you note in your original post, there’s a concept called lavud that we can use as well. Briefly, this means that if parts of the wall are separated by less than three tefachim, it’s still considered a solid wall. This is true regarding a wall being within three tefachim of the ground as well. Further, the pieces of the wall can be as small as you want, and you can apply Lavud however many times you’d like (§9). </p>\n\n<p>One final note: the schach does not have to be directly on the walls; as long as there is ten tefachim of “wall,” the schach can be as high above the walls as you’d like (§9). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The Plan</h2>\n\n<p>Now, let’s have fun combining these. </p>\n\n<p>We start with a basic frame. I might recommend PVC pipe (<a href=\"https://www.acehardware.com/search?query=PVC+pipe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ace Hardware</a> has them for pretty cheap). For stability purposes, you might want to make the full box, or at least three walls, but remember that you don’t have to. </p>\n\n<p>Next, take some string. Yes, string. Cheap, easy to find, string. As long as it’s long enough, you can wrap it around just <em>two and a half walls</em> (or maybe three), at just under three tefachim intervals (counting from the top of the base of the frame!) making sure that there’s at least ten tefachim covered in total. </p>\n\n<p>And...that’s it! It has a sufficient number of walls; because of lavud, these minimalistic walls are enough; and the schach doesn’t have to rest on your “wall,” so you don’t need to repeat the strings all the way to the top. </p>\n\n<p>If you have trees handy, you can use them in your frame to lower your cost, too. </p>\n\n<p>This is essentially the same as our theoretical example above, but solves the problem with that one - there’s no walls. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>But there’s a catch...</h2>\n\n<p>Now, you might notice that this approach, while minimalistic and cheap, doesn’t particularly fit in a minivan trunk easily. (Unless your minivan is actually a U-Haul, in which case I want one.) </p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to find some happy medium here - one that involves enough pieces that it can go into your trunk easily, but not too many that you make it hard on yourself. It really doesn’t matter what the frame is made of, but I think PVC is the best match for your criteria, albeit with a little elbow grease. If you break it up into, say, 2’ pieces, or 3’ pieces, and your Sukkah isn’t particularly tall, you’ll only have about 30 pieces, if that, plus connectors. That sounds like a lot, but it really isn’t; that should take maybe a couple of minutes to put up. </p>\n\n<p>After all, if you wanted it to be super-easy, you’d just <a href=\"http://www.popupsukkah.com/other_sukkahs.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">buy a pop-up Sukkah online</a>. You asked for DIY - what you gain in money you’ll have to deal with in physical effort. </p>\n\n\n",

(See also the commentary of the Rosh to this Gemara; 9:4) When Pinchas was (doing the right thing; hence not guilty; see Numbers ch. 24) chasing after Zimri, to kill him with a spear, the Gemara explains that Zimri was allowed to kill Pinchas in self defense, since as far as he was concerned, Pinchas was a \"rodef\" (a Halachic \"assailant\" bent on taking Zimri's life). It did not matter that the Halachah sided with Pinchas and allowed him to stalk Zimri to save the Jews from the plague etc.</p>\n\n<p>However, the OP is also asking in its title question, if one may kill A to protect from B. This implies 3 people in the equation. </p>\n\n<p>B is chasing C to kill him. Meanwhile, C has the opportunity to kill B in self defense, by killing A in the process. May C do so, even at the cost of innocent A's life?</p>\n\n<p>The first basis for such a case would be found in the Tosefta of Terumos at the end of chapter 7. If bandits threaten a group of people and say: \"Give up one of you to be killed or we will kill all of you.\" They may not surrender anyone and must willingly accept being killed. </p>\n\n<p>However, if they say: \"Give up so and so, and we will spare you all; or else we will kill all of you.\", then they should surrender that one named person and avoid death of the group.</p>\n\n<p>This was the case in II Shmuel 20: 1-22. The people of Aveil, surrendered Sheva ben Bichri (by killing him themselves) to General Yoav to avoid a siege. (Although Sheva was guilty of rebelling against King David, one may argue that as far as the people of Aveil were concerned, he wasn't trying to hurt them.)</p>\n\n<p>(However, R' Yochanan in the Yerushalmi (Terumos 8:4) contends that the leniency to hand over one named person to be killed applies to any innocent. Resh Lakish on the other hand, says it only applies to someone like Sheva ben Bichri who was guilty of treason against the king. In general, the Bais Yosef decides like R' Yochanan (siding with the Smag and other Rishonim), but the Rambam holds like Resh Lakish. The Rema brings both opinions for discussion. See Yoreh Deah 157:1)</p>\n\n<p>A more direct case is discussed by R' Yitzchak Zilberstein (Rav Elyashav's son-in-law) concerning a case where Reuven is being chased by assailant Shimon. May Reuven throw a grenade behind himself at Shimon, knowing that the blast will also kill Levi(an innocent bystander)?</p>\n\n<p>Rav Zilberstein quotes an authority (named \"Damesek Eliezer\" who says in the name of his father) that says one definitely may throw the grenade even if it will kill both the guilty assailant and the innocent bystander, if it will save his own life. A person has that license. </p>\n\n<p>However, another case is even more direct. In the Arab - Israeli wars, Arab troops would sometimes take Jewish prisoners and use them as human shields while advancing towards Israeli lines. They would force the prisoners to yell \"Shma Yisroel\" so the Israeli's would realize they were Jewish shields.</p>\n\n<p>May the Israelis fire upon the advancing Arabs who were using the Jewish comrades as shields? </p>\n\n<p><strong>In general, if someone is told: \"Kill him or I will kill you\" we say that one must rather be killed than commit murder because who says your blood is redder than his? (See Sanhedrin 74a; Rambam Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 5:7)</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Knesses HaGedolah (in a comment on the Bais Yosef to Yoreh Deah 157 (note 38)) brings the opinion of the Meiri who explains that even if the person is told: \"Kill him or I will kill you both\" one may surrender the other fellow, but may not actually kill him directly.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem then that the case of human shields would not allow the soldiers to fire upon the advancing \"shielded\" Arabs?</p>\n\n<p>Rav Zilberstein explains that one could not rely upon the lenient opinion of Damesek Eliezer's father here, because the grenade blast <em>indirectly</em> kills the bystander. Here, the soldiers would need to shoot directly at the shields.</p>\n\n<p>So we understand that using a high velocity round that would pierce and kill the human shield captive, and also kills the Arab behind him would be forbidden under a hostage situation. </p>\n\n<p>However, Rav Zilberstein does give two possible reasons to allow the friendly troops to open fire:</p>\n\n<p>1) The Israelis are aiming for the Arabs and not the shields. Even though it is highly risky, the Israeli snipers may fire since they have a chance of not killing the shield hostages.</p>\n\n<p>2) Times of war may be different, and allow for the usual rules of Halachah to be suspended.</p>\n\n<p>II Shmuel 11:25 \"And David said to the messenger, \"So shall you say to Joab; Let not this thing displease you, for the sword devours many time this number; strengthen your battle against the city, and destroy it, and encourage him.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rav Zilberstein interprets this verse to likely be a comment upon casualties of war and a blanket leniency (heter) that during wartime, one may try to win even at the cost of collateral damage.</p>\n\n<p>He says that this concept may have been the underlying heter relied upon by Rav Michael Dov Weismandel, when he urged the US government to bomb the train tracks and death camp facilities of the concentration camps, even though such actions would risk killing many camp victims. This could be done in order to save the masses of Jews being killed during the war of the Holocaust.</p>\n\n<p>In General, we do see a Halachic path here and sources to consider, but Rav Zilberstein expressed doubt during his shiur about any truly particular case and expressed that such matters would require further study on a case by case basis.</p>\n\n<p>May they never come up in practical reality. :)</p>\n\n\n",

No financial loss need be incurred in helping parents.  The Talmud explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At whose expense [must the parents be helped]?  Rav Yehudah said: The\n  son's.  Rabbi Nachman ben Oshaia said: The father's.  The Rabbis\n  [ruled:] At the father's expense.  An objection is raised: It is said:\n  “Honor your father and your mother”, and it is also said: “Honor the\n  Lord with your substance.” [Proverbs 3:9]  Just as the latter means at\n  personal cost, so does the former.  But if you say: At the father's\n  [expense], how does it affect [the son]? [What personal loss is\n  there?] Loss of time. [Kiddushin 32a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The law, summarized in the Shulchan Aruch, is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The son provides food and drink from the resources of the father and\n  mother. That is, he is not required to pay for serving his parents.\n  However, he is obligated to honor his parents through his physical\n  presence even if by doing so he will miss work…But if the son himself\n  does not have [enough food for one day], he is not obligated to miss\n  work and end up a beggar.

    "content": "# \"She may marry any Jewish man\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My friend showed me her conversion document. The last sentence was [almost identical to the following]: <strong>\"She may marry any Jewish man except a Kohen.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why would the conversion document go out of its way to specify that she can marry \"any\" Jewish man, with the single exception of a kohen? First of all, it's not necessary; second, it's not true. She can't marry, for example, a Jewish man who has another wife, even if he is a yisroel. She can't marry a Jewish man who is incapable of consent, nor one she was suspected of living with before she converted -- even if each of these men is a yisroel. (Also, I am guessing there would be some sort of pushback if she tried to marry her Jewish father, or her biological brother who also became a Jew, whether they were kohanim or yisroelim ... and I doubt I have mentioned all the exceptions.) In short, there are very many opportunities to falsify the categorical statement printed on my friend's teudat ravakut, which she received from a prominent and reliable beit din. I am therefore asking why they write it.</p>\n\n<p>Does this statement have any possible effect, besides confusing the convert and potentially her future partners? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>They meant \"other than a Kohen, she can marry any Jewish man that a born-Jewess can marry\"; her status as a convert poses no additional issues. (In fact, she can marry <em>more</em> men than a born-Jewess, as she can marry a <em>mamzer</em> if she so desires, for whatever that's worth.) That's just how they wrote it, that's how the form is set up (and what the rabbanut will look for before she gets married), and it won't give her any problems. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vhin1w0p_dMJ:https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/%3Fid%3D6158+&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk&client=firefox-b-ab\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">www.yeshiva.co</a> the question was asked “How can a cohen marry a convert?”</p>\n\n<p>The answer is (in part)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The laws of a cohen are very special, and beyond the special duties he\n  will perform in the Temple (when it is rebuilt), even today he carries\n  out a special function amongst the Jewish people.

We have such Brochos for enjoyable sights, tastes and smells, several Brochos for different besamin, but nothing to thank HaShem for our hearing pleasurable music?

If he leaves such a city or does not enter, he is subject to revenge killing by the Goel HaDam (Blood Avenger) and such avenger faces no punishment.</p>\n\n<p>We already have a question about whether or not the avenger <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/81026/is-the-goel-hadam-blood-avenger-obligated-to-pursue-blood-vengeance\">is obligated to seek revenge</a> (disclosure: I posted it).

Rav Pappa says about this halakha: Square means along their seams and their diagonals, i.e., they must be perfectly square where the compartments are sewn to the titora. The Gemara suggests: Let us say that a mishna supports this opinion (Megilla 24b): One who fashions his phylacteries in a round shape exposes himself to danger, and it does not enable him to fulfill the mitzva of phylacteries. Rav Pappa said: This is no support, as one can say that the mishna is referring to phylacteries that are fashioned like a nut, i.e., their underside is rounded, and therefore there is a danger that if he strikes his head on a wall the underside will press into his head and injure him. By contrast, if the underside is flat one might have thought that it is fit despite the fact that it is not square. Therefore, the baraita teaches that phylacteries must be square. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.35a.11\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosfot there already suggests that this sounds like only the stitching at the bottom needs to be perfectly square, not the leather box on top. The Orchot Chayim (Tefillin 27) and Semak (#153) quotes \"some\" who are strict to have the box be square <em>as well</em>. The Mordekhai (Halakhot Ketanot) famously (cf. Magen Avraham to OC 32:39) disapproves of \"those who make the hand Tefillah in a press that is round at the top and square at the bottom\".</p>\n\n<p>So clearly this position was out there. It's thus not surprising to find an ancient example of it (particularly in a Geniza after the currently accepted position became dominant).</p>\n\n<p>There's further debate among those who apply the \"square\" rule to the boxes if it suffices that they be rectangular and if the rule applies to the heights of the boxes as well. The perfect cubes you see nowadays were not the norm historically. Non-rectangular Tefillin-boxes existed until quite recently in some Eastern Jewish communities (cf. Pe'ulath Saddiq 3:205, Rav Pe'alim 4:2).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>So your new reference to Prof. Amar's book picked my interest, so I took it out of the university library a couple of days ago. Turns out it's really more of a kuntress...but it has great info. I'll summarize the info that pertains to your question (I'll also note that he brings many sources from poskim and such):</p>\n<p>It turns out that in past generations, most communities did not have the proper tools to shape cattle leather (בהמה גסה) into tefillin, and so resorted to using the leather of small flock animals (בהמה דקה - looking for a better translation of the term...). This leather could be shaped more easily, but that meant that it could also warp relatively quickly. Often the upper part of the batim would warp and become any of the following: Cuboid with rounded corners; a tube that has taken on the shape of the rolled-up scroll; a tower shape (wider on the bottom and gradually becoming narrower) - either a cuboid or a tube; or having a cuboid base and a tubular upper section. Some examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nVL3n.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nVL3n.jpg\" alt=\"warped tefillin 1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ViaQw.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ViaQw.jpg\" alt=\"warped tefillin 2\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3PKkB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3PKkB.jpg\" alt=\"warped tefillin 3\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1Cwcy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1Cwcy.jpg\" alt=\"warped tefillin 4\" /></a></p>\n<p>(picture copyright to Prof. Amar and those he lists in the kuntress)</p>\n<p>There were also cases in which the makers were unable to - or chose not to - make the tefillin perfectly square in the first place, as seems to have been the case here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/a4WHX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/a4WHX.png\" alt=\"15th-16th century miniature tefillin\" /></a></p>\n<p>(from the catalogue of יודאיקה ירושלים, תשמ\"ו, item 116)</p>\n<p>And of course, the Renaissance drawings of round tefillin: <a href=\"https://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6254/1999/1600/tefillin1827.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://d5iam0kjo36nw.cloudfront.net/V10p024001.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=xg5FAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Paul%20Christian%20Kirchner%22&hl=en&sa=X&safe=strict&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3</a> (pg. 5), <a href=\"https://books.google.co.in/books?id=OCdXAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4</a> (pg. 119).</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Jews continued using these tefillin, which naturally begs the question: How does that square (excuse the pun) with the gemara?</p>\n<p>Prof. Zohar writes on pg. 17, note 52 (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...About round tefillin, it says in the mishna: one who makes his tefillin round it will endanger him, and there is no mitzvah in this\" - it seems that this is not referring to this sort of tefillin...for it is unimaginable to think that the Rishonim and Acharonim used tefillin that were unkosher. For a few suggestions, see Tefillah Le'Moshe, pg. 56-57; Habermann, pg. 176-177.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have not checked Tefillah Le'Moshe yet, but <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/habermann-abraham-meir\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A\"M Habermann</a> <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23614036?seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">had</a> an interesting suggestion. He suggests that originally, tefillin were only scrolls without batim, tied around the head. Later, as people wore them for longer durations during the day and there was fear that the scrolls would be ruined, batim were created<sup>1</sup>. In the time of the gemara there were sects that did not have batim for their tefillin. They would place the scrolls on their foreheads and tie them straps. He suggests that \"round tefillin\" meant that they would spread out the scrolls all across their foreheads in a <em>rounded</em> manner. Such tefillin would have been easily recognized by Roman authorities, thus endangering the wearer, while tefillin with batim would have looked more like little amulets (and apparently that's what the NT called tefillin - amulets). He believed that this makes the following statement better understood (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.23a.16?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 23a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rabbi Meyasha, son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, said: The halakha in this case is that one rolls up the phylacteries in their straps like a scroll, and holds them in his hand opposite his heart.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This refers to tefillin that aren't in batim but were only scrolls with straps. Therefore, the comparison of rolling \"like a scroll\" makes more sense (then the commentators' suggestion that it refers only to the straps).</p>\n<p>In short, we find that the prohibition of making round tefillin does not refer to cylindrical batim.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> This suggestion doesn't negate the concept of \"The requirement that phylacteries must be square is a halakha transmitted to Moses from Sinai\" - we may say that <em>when</em> there are batim, then they must be square, and this was given at Sinai.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>On page 35a of Masechet Menachot of the Talmud Bavli, Rashi explains that it's a danger because the tefillin could enter his head if he bangs into a door. </p>\n\n<p>The Tosfot and Turei Even says that in a time of danger, it won't protect him because there is no mitzvah to wear round tefillin.</p>\n\n<p>Rabeinu Chananel explained that the danger exists when the wearer will place his head on his arm during tachanun and the round tefillin may pierce his head.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Steinsaltz edition of the Talmud, some Rishonim(don't know which ones; would be interested to know, though!) restricted the danger of round tefillin only to the head tefillin, and not to the arm so long as it had a square base; as shown in the picture above.

    "content": "# Video games with god-like characters - Avodah Zara?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I found some answers on this site about if playing certain kinds of \"Idolatrous\" video games constitute avoda zara, such as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/85907/virtual-avodah-zara\">Virtual Avodah Zara</a>\nand <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28057/while-playing-a-computer-game-may-i-worship-one-of-the-games-gods-to-help\">While playing a computer game, may I \"worship\" one of the game's \"gods\" to help me win?</a></p>\n\n<p>I think from the articles there's still some doubt as to whether it's considered actual avoda zara or just associating yourself with it, which MIGHT have the difference: does the computer that was used to play the game, need to be completely destroyed, as is the commandment to destroy all things that were used for avoda zara? Take a look at the introduction to this section of Rambam: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?tdate=9/13/2018&rambamChapters=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?tdate=9/13/2018&rambamChapters=3</a> particularly the parts where he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"30\">\n  <li>To destroy false gods and all their objects of worship</li>\n  <li><p>Not to benefit from false gods and all their objects of worship</p></li>\n  <li><p>Not to benefit from ornaments that have adorned false gods</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>this is part of his list of the following \"commandments\" he is going to explain.</p>\n\n<p>SO it seems that if playing such games is considered actual avoda zara, then apparently the computer would need to be destroyed, or would it? Does anyone know the answer?</p>\n\n<p>BTW just to point out: the above questions only asked about particular games that have actual avoda zara in them and were wondering if THAT is considered like real avoda zara, but they don't seem to take into account that the game ITSELF (no matter what's in it, unless it's some Torah learning game or something) would be considered avoda zara, since it's causing bittul Torah?</p>\n\n<p>'Cause if the game itself (not even considering what's in it) would be considered avoda zara, then the computer should definitely be destroyed, since it's something directly being used for avoda zara, right? Or would it?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT based on the current answer I think it's neccesary to quote this later-mentioned phrase of Rambam:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The worshipers of false gods have composed many texts concerning their\n  service, [describing] what is the essence of their service, what\n  practices are involved, and what are its statutes. The Holy One,\n  blessed be He, has commanded us not to read those books at all, nor to\n  think about them or any matters involved with them.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is even forbidden to look at the image of an idol, as [Leviticus\n  19:4] states: \"Do not turn to the idols.\" In this regard, [Deuteronomy\n  12:30] states: \"[Be careful]... lest you seek to find out about their\n  gods, saying, 'How did they serve them.' This prohibits inquiring\n  about the nature of their service even if you, yourself, do not serve\n  them. This matter will ultimately cause you to turn to [the false god]\n  and worship it as they do, as [the above verse continues]: \"so that I\n  will do the same.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>ב ספרים רבים חברו עובדי כוכבים בעבודתה היאך עיקר עבודתה ומה מעשיה\n  ומשפטיה צונו הקדוש ברוך הוא שלא לקרות באותן הספרים כלל ולא נהרהר בה\n  ולא בדבר מדבריה ואפילו להסתכל בדמות הצורה אסור שנאמר אל תפנו אל\n  האלילים ובענין הזה נאמר ופן תדרוש לאלהיהם לאמר איכה יעבדו שלא תשאל על\n  דרך עבודתה היאך היא אף על פי שאין אתה עובדה שדבר זה גורם להפנות אחריה\n  ולעשות כמה שהן עושין שנאמר ואעשה כן גם אני:</p>\n  \n  <p>3 All these prohibitions have one common thrust: that one should not\n  pay attention to idol worship. Whoever performs a deed that reflects\n  his concern with [idol worship] receives lashes [as punishment].</p>\n  \n  <p>The worship of false gods is not the only subject to which we are\n  forbidden to pay attention; rather, we are warned not to consider any\n  thought which will cause us to uproot one of the fundamentals of the\n  Torah. We should not turn our minds to these matters, think about\n  them, or be drawn after the thoughts of our hearts.\n  Blockquote\n  Blockquote</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>while it's true that a computer might not be considered \"maaseh\" but the current answer even admits that it is considered \"Machashava\" and it seems pretty clear in the Rambam that even that is forbidden (and you can't just go and say \"oh well the Rambam is only trying to distance us from aveiros so we don't have to listen to him\", it seems pretty clear that first of all the Rambam is saying that the prohibition to think about it is min haTorah and even if you say it isn't, it's still universally accepted to listen to the Rishonim just the same as actual Mishanh (forgot the actual source of that statement but it's well known / can be found in many sichos etc.), and I haven't persoannly looked up the shulchin aruch but I'm sure since it's in Rambam it's also mentioned there too), </p>\n\n<p>so the question remains: Since it definitely constitutes as transgressing an Aveira by thinking about Avoda Zara, are we require to destroy the device that caused us to think about it (the computer / TV screen etc.)?</p>\n\n<p>BTW I should have brought this earlier, but regarding the idea of destroying avoda zara the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?tdate=9/15/2018&rambamChapters=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?tdate=9/15/2018&rambamChapters=3</a>) states: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1\n  It is a positive commandment to destroy false deities, all their accessories, and everything that is made for their purposes, as [Deuteronomy 12:2] states: \"You shall surely destroy all the places [where the gentiles... served their gods]\" and, as [implied by Deuteronomy 7:5]: \"Rather, what you should do to them is tear down their altars.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>`6 We are allowed to benefit from images which gentiles made for\n  aesthetic purposes. It is forbidden, however, to benefit from images\n  that are made for the purpose of idol worship.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>All things digital are called \"במחשבה\" (virtual, not real).</strong> Everything that's on your screen does not exist in reality and it's your imagination (your brain) that makes the picture. </p></li>\n<li><p>THere's no Kedusha or Tuma on the screen.

    "content": "# If we can't understand G-d at all, why do our sources try?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have for a long time been been confused and dismayed that, although our sources -- including kabbalistic ones -- acknowledge frequently, emphatically, and without limitation that לית מחשבה תפיסא בך כלל -- \"no thought can grasp [Him] at all,\" they nonetheless purport to grasp Him, sometimes at the highest levels.</p>\n\n<p>I dare not post the examples that come to mind out of respect for these sources and shame at my own lack of understanding. They are found very frequently, however, in classical texts including Zohar and chassidus. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that this daring and beautiful thing -- to presume we can understand G-d, a little -- is the basis for our whole religion. I understand that along with fear of G-d, we are supposed to have a firm belief that He deals in this world, and has imparted a shadow of His wisdom in the minds of the best people. Still, I am often stunned at the amount of technical detail with which these sources presume they can describe G-d, even in such basic senses as the number of His attributes. I know the answer is that I am not a prophet, so it doesn't make sense to me, and yet it is. --Yet belief in our prophets' unlimited access to Divinity is feels dangerous when one sees how many people in the wider world claim and believe they have prophecy and are entirely, treacherously mistaken. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The quoted passage, לית מחשבה תפיסא בך כלל, is actually the beginning of a description of the Sefiros. The issue of our apparent understanding of Hashem is not unique to Kabbalah, though. We always refer to Hashem as being merciful and powerful, among other descriptions. In the Torah as well, we find: For Hashem your God is a consuming blaze.</p>\n\n<p>The Kuzari explains that our relationship to Hashem is based on our experience with Him. Our description of Hashem is not a description of His essence, of describing what He is. It is a description of our perception of Him.</p>\n\n<p>He explains this with an example. If a distant king sends you wagon-loads of meat and fruits, along with gold and silver. When you want to praise that king, you would not praise his glorious palace, his army, or his rule — because you've never seen all this. You would only be able to praise him for his generosity and his delicious meats and fruits, and by extension, his mastery of farming and luscious pasture. You are praising those aspects of which you are acquainted. </p>\n\n<p>In this vein, at a time when we are benefiting from Hashem's hand, we praise Him for that exact beneficial aspect of which we just experienced. While eating bread we say, 'Who extracts bread from the earth.' While enjoying fruit we say, '[Who] creates fruits of the tree.'</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam famously explains that when we attribute even positive descriptions to Hashem, we don't mean that as a definition of His 'personality', but rather it is meant to be understood that whatever He is, He surely does not exclude this positive trait. For example, when we say that Hashem is kind, this is not a description of His personality, but rather we are saying that He is surely not unkind.</p>\n\n<p>The Kabbalists add one more area of discussion, which is the 'created personality'. Since we do know that Hashem has Middos which are described in the Torah we see that although Hashem is endless, He did narrow down His interaction with His creation to to a finite framwork. This is so that we can relate to Him. The study of the Sefiros is not about describing Hashem Himself. It is an understanding of that framework in which He operates. This 'personality' that was set for the purpose of being understood in some way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm not sure if this will entirely address your question(especially since you mentioned Kabbalah and Chassidus while I am replying with Rambam), but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> deals at great length with \"knowing God\". Specifically, there is a passage in the beginning of Book 1, Chapter 59 which might be helpful. Rambam has told us that we cannot know God in any positive way; that is to say that we cannot proclaim any attributes of God. The most we can do is to negate what God is not. In Chapter 59, Rambam explains how this helps us understand God somewhat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>THE following question might perhaps be asked: Since there is no\n  possibility of obtaining a knowledge of the true essence of God, and\n  since it has also been proved that the only thing that man can\n  apprehend of Him is the fact that He exists, and that all positive\n  attributes are inadmissible, as has been shown, what is the difference\n  among those who have obtained a knowledge of God? Must not the\n  knowledge obtained by our teacher Moses, and by Solomon, be the same\n  as that obtained by any one of the lowest class of philosophers, since\n  there can be no addition to this knowledge? But, on the other hand, it\n  is generally accepted among theologians and also among philosophers,\n  that there can be a great difference between two persons as regards\n  the knowledge of God obtained by them. Know that this is really the\n  case, that those who have obtained a knowledge of God differ greatly\n  from each other; for in the same way as by each additional attribute\n  an object is more specified, and is brought nearer to the true\n  apprehension of the observer, so by each additional negative attribute\n  you advance toward the knowledge of God, and you are nearer to it than\n  he who does not negative, in reference to God, those qualities which\n  you are convinced by proof must be negatived. There may thus be a man\n  who after having earnestly devoted many years to the pursuit of one\n  science, and to the true understanding of its principles, till he is\n  fully convinced of its truths, has obtained as the sole result of this\n  study the conviction that a certain quality must be negatived in\n  reference to God, and the capacity of demonstrating that it is\n  impossible to apply it to Him. Superficial thinkers will have no proof\n  for this, will doubtfully ask, Is that thing existing in the Creator,\n  or not? And those who are deprived of sight will positively ascribe it\n  to God, although it has been clearly shown that He does not possess\n  it. E.g., while I show that God is incorporeal, another doubts and is\n  not certain whether He is corporeal or incorporeal: others even\n  positively declare that He is corporeal, and appear before the Lord\n  with that belief. Now see how great the difference is between these\n  three men: the first is undoubtedly nearest to the Almighty; the\n  second is remote, and the third still more distant from Him. If there\n  be a fourth person who holds himself convinced by proof that emotions\n  are impossible in God, while the first who rejects the corporeality,\n  is not convinced of that impossibility, that fourth person is\n  undoubtedly nearer the knowledge of God than the first, and go on, so\n  that a person who, convinced by proof, negatives a number of things in\n  reference to God, which according to our belief may possibly be in Him\n  or emanate from Him, is undoubtedly a more perfect man than we are,\n  and would surpass us still more if we positively believed these things\n  to be properties of God. It will now be clear to you, that every time\n  you establish by proof the negation of a thing in reference to God,\n  you become more perfect, while with every additional positive\n  assertion you follow your imagination and recede from the true\n  knowledge of God. Only by such ways must we approach the knowledge of\n  God, and by such researches and studies as would show us the\n  inapplicability of what is inadmissible as regards the Creator, not by\n  such methods as would prove the necessity of ascribing to Him anything\n  extraneous to His essence, or asserting that He has a certain\n  perfection, when we find it to be a perfection in relation to us. The\n  perfections are all to some extent acquired properties, and a property\n  which must be acquired does not exist in everything capable of making\n  such acquisition. </p>\n  \n  <p>You must bear in mind, that by affirming anything of God, you are\n  removed from Him in two respects; first, whatever you affirm, is only\n  a perfection in relation to us; secondly, He does not possess anything\n  superadded to this essence; His essence includes all His perfections,\n  as we have shown. Since it is a well-known fact that even that\n  knowledge of God which is accessible to man cannot be attained except\n  by negations, and that negations do not convey a true idea of the\n  being to which they refer, all people, both of past and present\n  generations, declared that God cannot be the object of human\n  comprehension, that none but Himself comprehends what He is, and that\n  our knowledge consists in knowing that we are unable truly to\n  comprehend Him.(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp069.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, while we can never truly understand what God <em>is</em>, we can get closer and closer by understanding what God <em>is not</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(If I've misunderstood your question, let me know.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Chassidic thought applies the phrase לית מחשבה תפיסא בך כלל (no thought can grasp [Him] at all) to G-d's Infinite Essence (אין סוף, also referred to as Nothingness or אין) at a level which does not relate to anything else, and to which we cannot relate at all.</p>\n\n<p>What the Chassidic and Kabbalistic masters do attempt to understand and describe are the revelations and emanations (גילוים) that ultimately come from that Infinite and Unknowable Source.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Alter Rebbe writes in Likkutei Torah on Parshat Pekudei <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14963&st=%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%90&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמנם בחינת האין שממנו תמצא החכמה הוא בחינה שלפני כל ההשתלשלות דשם הוי' וע\"ז אמרו בס\"י לפני אחד מה אתה סופר וכמאמר אנת הוא חד ולא בחושבן ושם הוא למעלה משום השגה וגילוי דלית מחשבה תפיסא ביה כלל רק החכמה שמאין תמצא הוא ראשית הגילוי.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The concept of Nothingness (אין) from which Wisdom (חכמה) can be found is a concept which exists before the descent (השתלשלות) [symbolized by] the Name HaVaYaH. About this they said in Sefer Yetzirah, \"Before one, what do you count?\" And like their statement, \"You are One but not in number\".

Even the nonJewish scholars regard this as a work of fiction. It does seem that it is possible that it is conflated with Chanuka. However, since the reference is to a single day, <em>But the day of the festivity of this victory</em>, it does not seem likely.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9073-judith-book-of\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> dates its composition as around the first century before the Common Era.

I. ad Corinth., c. 55), near the end of the first\n  century of the common era.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judith#Historicity_of_Judith\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia says</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Historicity of Judith</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>It is generally accepted that the Book of Judith is ahistorical. The\n  fictional nature \"is evident from its blending of history and fiction,\n  beginning in the very first verse, and is too prevalent thereafter to\n  be considered as the result of mere historical mistakes.\"[26]</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, the great villain is \"Nebuchadnezzar, who ruled over the\n  Assyrians\" (1:1), yet the historical Nebuchadnezzar II was the king of\n  Babylonia.[26] Other details, such as fictional place names, the\n  immense size of armies and fortifications, and the dating of events,\n  cannot be reconciled with the historical record.[26] Judith's village,\n  Bethulia (literally \"virginity\") is unknown and otherwise unattested\n  to in any ancient writing.[26]</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, there have been various attempts by both scholars and\n  clergy to understand the characters and events in the Book as\n  allegorical representations of actual personages and historical\n  events. Much of this work has focused on linking Nebuchadnezzar with\n  various conquerors of Judea from different time periods and, more\n  recently, linking Judith herself with historical female leaders,\n  including Queen Salome Alexandra, Judea's only female monarch (76-67\n  BCE) and its last ruler to die while Judea remained an independent\n  kingdom.[31]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9073-judith-book-of\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Jewish Encyclopedia</a> also explains that it is a complete work of fiction. As a result, there would be no such <em>holiday</em>. In fact, the Encyclopedia points out that from the first sentence, it is deliberately written so that the reader would know that it is fiction.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Historical Setting.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The book begins with a date, \"the twelfth year of the reign of\n  Nebuchadnezzar,\" and everything moves with the air of a precise\n  account of actual events. But the way in which the narrative at once\n  makes open sport of chronology and history is very striking.\n  Nebuchadnezzar is the king of Assyria, and reigns in Nineveh(!). The\n  Jews, who have \"newly returned from the captivity\" (iv. 3, v. 19), are\n  in no sense his subjects; indeed, his chief captain has apparently\n  never heard of them (v. 3). Yet the writer of this story was a\n  well-informed man, familiar with foreign geography (i. 6-10, ii.\n  21-28), and well acquainted with the Hebrew Scriptures (i. 1; ii. 23;\n  v. 6-19; viii. 1, 26; ix. 2 et seq.). It must therefore be concluded\n  either that the principal names of the story are a mere disguise, or\n  that they were chosen with a purely literary purpose, and with the\n  intent to disclaim at the outset any historical verity for the tale.\n  The former supposition is not rendered plausible by any consideration,\n  and fails utterly to account for the peculiarities of the narrative;\n  the latter, on the contrary, gives a satisfactory explanation of all\n  the facts. That is, with the very first words of the tale, \"In the\n  twelfth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, who reigned over the\n  Assyrians in Nineveh,\" the narrator gives his hearers a solemn wink.\n  They are to understand that this is fiction, not history. It did not\n  take place in this or that definite period of Jewish history, but\n  simply \"once upon a time,\" the real vagueness of the date being\n  transparently disguised in the manner which has become familiar in the\n  folk-tales of other parts of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I gather that this word comes either <em>yashav</em> - <em>to sit</em> or <em>yishuv</em> - \"establishment\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Metivta</strong> - applies to high schools. I gather it's an Aramaic word, but I don't know its origin or \"root form\" meaning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kolel</strong> - college and adult program. I gather it comes from the word to mean \"inclusion\".</p>\n\n<p>Why were these different terms assigned to these different age groups? Are these terms meant to define either some behavior or mode of learning that occurs at that age?

The husband has no halachic control over his wife, besides a list of certain Melachot but those are DeRabanan monetary obligation, and she's free to exempt herself from all of them by claiming \"איני ניזונת ואיני עושה\". (<em>I hope this point is agreed on לכו\"ע</em>).<br>\n.<br>\nAlso raising kids is not a Mitzvah at all (for women at least), and she can not get away by \"being engaged in another Mitzvah\".</p></li>\n<li><p>The Mitzvah of honoring parents is one of the MOST stringent DeOraytahs.</p></li>\n<li><p>THe Gemmorah in Kiddushin (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=30b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">30b</a>) brings Safra (Vayikra 19,3) explaining the Ptur of married women from this Mitzvah by simply mentioning that \"רשות אחרים עליה\".:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"\"איש\"-- אין לי אלא איש. אשה מנין? תלמוד לומר \"תיראו\"-- הרי כאן שנים. אם כן למה נאמר \"איש\"? אלא שהאיש סיפוקו בידו והאשה אין ספוקה בידה מפני שיש רשות אחרים עליה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This opinion is indisputable and not discussed by the Gemmorah.</p>\n\n<p>I am stumped, <strong>what רשות does the husband have over his wife, to exempt her from such an important Mitzvah as honoring and respecting her parents</strong>?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A bonus question: why \"אחרים\" and not \"בעל\" and who are the \"others\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Sorry, I couldn't find a Halachic way to solve this puzzle of exempting a married woman from honoring both parents. But this seems way too interesting:</p>\n<p>THe source: The Gemarrah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sotah.12a.2?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sota 12a</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר יוחנן כל הנושא אשה לשם שמים מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו ילדה</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: ... anyone who marries a woman for the sake of Heaven, ... the verse ascribes him credit as if <strong>he gave birth to her</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>This means, that there's a Rabbinic approach that a married woman stops relating to her parents altogether, as starts being related to her husband as his baby. Therefore she's obligated to respect him, as \"her new father\" (The Gemorah mentions that without a reason).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This is consistent with some Rishonim that claim that once a woman marries she does not return to respect her parents ever again.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This is one of those rare cases when Kaballah made silently its way to the Halachah without anybody paying attention.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I do not agree with your assumption that the husband \"exempts\" his wife from Kibbud Av Va'em.</p>\n\n<p>Of course she has to honor her parents when it doesnt clash with honoring her husband. She is just not always able to carry that out, as she has a higher code of honor to her husband, which <code>could sometimes</code> affect her ability to honor her parents. That is why the Posuk excludes women, as they can have overriding responsabilies to their spouse.</p>\n\n<p>See Gemoro Kiddushin 30, <code>If both my father and mother ask me to bring them water, which request should I honor first? Your father's comes first, because you and your mother are commanded to honor your father.</code> Your point 1 about a wife not being required to honor her husband is now moot, as the Gemoro is clear to the contrary.</p>\n\n<p>You may ask from where does the Gemoro learn this code of honor towards her husband, and indeed that it supersedes her requirement of honor to her husband. That though is a different question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do the Torah codes offer scientific proof that the Torah is supernatural?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There was an experiment published in a journal called Statistical Science in 1994 that found that certain medieval Rabbis and their birth & yahrtzeit are referenced to in sefer Bereshit by running a search through equally-spaced letters(if I recall correctly).</p>\n\n<p>I have seen many similar codes that produced surprising results that lead me to wonder if they may be considered valid as scientific proof that the letters in the Torah are not placed randomly since the findings are highly improbable according to the rules of probability. </p>\n\n<p>I would like to know if anyone has a way of putting these or any Torah codes to test in a mathematical equation to see if the results are statistically significant(a probability of less than 5% to occur randomly). Does anyone have a way of independently testing such data (codes) mathematically to prove or disprove their statistical significance? Leaving beliefs aside and letting the mathematics speak for themselves.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I think there’s a bigger problem with Torah Codes than the one Al Berko mentioned; namely, even if we were guaranteed accuracy in our Sifrei Torah, we would have this problem. </p>\n\n<p>That problem is that there are several ways to refer to things, any number of letters to start from, and any number of letters to skip. In other words: you can’t prove the Divinity of a text using criteria which can be completely arbitrarily filled in. </p>\n\n<p>Take, as an example, 9/11. <a href=\"https://torahcodes-mn.blogspot.com/2011/11/torah-codes-of-nine-eleven.html?m=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The code hinting to 9/11</a> spots the word התאום, “twin,” if you count from the letter ה in לעיניהם, Bamidbar 20:8, every 36 letters; מגדלי, “towers,” if you count from the letter מ in למות, Bamidbar 20:4, every 71 letters; מטוס, “airplane,” if you count from the letter ם in ובעירם in Bamidbar 20:11, every -33 letters (oh, I forgot to mention that counting backwards is also legal); and מתקפת, “attack,” if you count from the letter ם in פעמים in Bamidbar 20:11, every -144 letters. </p>\n\n<p>So let me get this straight. It says “twin,” “towers,” “airplane,” and “attack,” if you squint hard enough, so that must be a reference to 9/11 and therefore the Torah is from G-d?</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the flaw with this argument. What are the words chosen? התאום and מגדלי - which I assume are meant to be read together as מגדלי התאום, “twin towers.” Why are they referred to as such, and not, say, מגדלים תאומים? Or מגדלי התאומים? Or some other conjugation? Well, it’s because that’s how it’s referred to in Hebrew - Modern Hebrew, which certainly doesn’t have any Divinity. </p>\n\n<p>What about מטוס? Well, once again, that’s the wording used in Modern Hebrew for airplane. But why not use מטוסים?</p>\n\n<p>The final word was מתקפת. Why not use מלחמה, “war”? Or הכאה, “smite”? </p>\n\n<p>Okay, that’s cute, “it’s in Modern Hebrew, therefore it doesn’t count.” But the whole point is that it’s predicting the future - even using the language spoken then! Tell me, then: the attack was in America. Why not refer to it in English? Instead of using מטוס, transliterates it as אירפלאין (or whatever other combination you feel like using), and figure out how that fits in. </p>\n\n<p>The answer, of course, is because that was the only way to make it work.</p>\n\n<p>There’s more to 9/11 than the fact that airplanes crashed into the Twin Towers in an attack. I don’t see anyone conjuring up י״א ספטמבר ב׳א (“September 11, 2001”), which might also be referred to as עשתי עשר instead of י״א, or שני אלפים ואחד instead of ב׳א, or, for that matter, why not use the Julian date, or, better yet, the actual Hebrew date? What about the attack on the Pentagon, or the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, or Al Qaeda, or Osama bin Laden, or, or...</p>\n\n<p>The reason those are ignored is because they didn’t show up. So we handwave it, point to the few words that  we got to work, and shout jubilantly in the streets, “The Torah is Divine!”</p>\n\n<p>I don’t see anyone doing the same experiment on any other sufficiently long text (like, say, the King James Version, or all the works of Shakespeare lined up in chronological order of how he wrote them). You’d eventually be able to do the same thing; if there are enough variables to tweak, you will be able to make it work. </p>\n\n<p>As the old quote says, “<a href=\"https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_you_torture_the_data_long_enough,_it_will_confess_to_anything\" rel=\"noreferrer\">If you torture the data, they will confess</a>.”</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>No, the Torah Codes have no merit. </p>\n\n<p>There are two core issues:</p>\n\n<p>1) Statistical Improbability - On the surface it does seem to be highly improbable to find hidden \"codes\" through the use of Equidistant Letter Sequencing\" (ELS). The issues is that these same \"miraculous finds\" have <a href=\"http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/moby.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">been duplicated using Moby Dick.</a></p>\n\n<p>2) ELS Coding only works if the text is 100% immaculate. Even one letter off will ruin the entire sequencing. Think of shifting each box in crossword puzzle over one space - each word/sequence will fall apart. </p>\n\n<p>The belief that the Torah's text has not undergone even the slightest alteration is an <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/torah-min-hashamayim-conflicts-between-religious-belief-and-scientific-thinking\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">untenable position</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So why does it seem to work?\nIt's called <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">data dredging.</a></p>\n\n<p>Data dredging is defined as: <em>\"The misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant when in fact there is no real underlying effect.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>A great article was written on this folly;  <em><a href=\"https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4048\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bible Codes: Enigma for Dummies</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/torah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Scientific Refutation of the Bible Codes.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yes!</p>\n<p>Our TorahBibleCodes ELS Search Software is available for FREE DOWNLOAD via the web site <a href=\"https://TorahBibleCodes.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://TorahBibleCodes.com</a> and provides Free, Open-Source Python ELS Software Research Tools to make possible for others to confirm and/or extrapolate continued research in this field and academic discipline(s) by providing fully-customizable, expandable, scalable, free software in the Python language.

Rashi (ad. loc., DH “Ne’ilas She’arim”) references the Yerushalmi (Berachos, 4th Perek) that gives two explanations of this name:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rav holds that it is said with the locking of the gates in Heaven</li>\n<li>R’ Yochanan holds that it is said with the locking of the gates of the Beis HaMikdash</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since, in either case, Ne’ilah would be said close to the end of the day, with these “lockings of the gates,” it became known as Ne’ilah. (Rashi has more to say, regarding how this name applies to other fasts, but that’s irrelevant to our discussion. Below is a copy of Rashi, with my translation.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נעילת שערים - מפורש בברכות ירושלמי בפרק תפלת השחר אימתי נעילה יש אומרים נעילת שערי מקדש וי\"א נעילת שערי שמים שנועלים אותן לעת ערב בגמר תפלה [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>”Locking of the gates” - it is explicit in Yerushalmi Berachos, Perek Tefillas HaShachar, “When is Ne’lah? Some say the locking of the Temple gates, and some say the locking of the gates of Heaven; for they would lock them close to evening, with the conclusion of the Tefillah.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the original Yerushalmi (on Sefaria it’s 31a, in the middle; still my translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אימתי הוא נעילה רבנן דקיסרין אמרין איתפלגון רב ור' יוחנן רב אמר בנעילת שערי שמים ור\"י אמר בנעילת שערי היכל</p>\n  \n  <p>When is Ne’ilah? The Caesarean Rabbis said: Rav and R’ Yochanan argue. Rav said: with the locking of the Heavenly gates. R’ Yochanan said: with the locking of the gates of the Heichal. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi [Berachot Y 45a] says that Rabbi Levi said: God said in Isaiah 1:15:</p>\n\n<p>Even if you pray profusely I will not answer, [because] your hands are full of blood.</p>\n\n<p>תַרְבּוּ תְפִלָּה אֵינֶנִי שמֵֹׁעַ יְדֵיכֶם דָּמִים מָּלֵאוּ גַם כִי</p>\n\n<p>He concluded that IF your hands are not full of blood AND you pray profusely, you WILL be answered! It’s a promise! He turned the negative-sounding biblical verse into something positive. So the Sages added Neilah to increase the chance that our prayers will be answered on Yom Kippur.  So you could interpret Neilah as \"Last chance to have your prayers answered -- We are closing up!\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Moses asking for problems by leaving the Israelites alone so soon after coming out of Egypt?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My understanding is the Moses went up the Mountain to get the 10 Commandments exactly 3 months after leaving Egypt, and a week or so later went up again for 40 (on g-ds command) days without out telling anyone how long he would be gone.\n2 questions</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Are my assertions above correct?  Is this not a recipe for disaster?</li>\n<li>How could g-d (or Moses for that matter) not know that this was a\nbad Idea? Is there any commentary on this? (I can’t find any)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question seems to be based on the premise that Moses didn’t tell anyone when he was coming back. That’s a false premise. </p>\n\n<p>The Medieval commentator Rashi, on Exodus 32:1 (the beginning of the Golden Calf story), quotes the Talmud, Shabbas 89a. He says that Moses indeed told them when he was coming back: “At the end of 40 days, I will return during the first six hours.” The problem was a miscommunication - Moses meant forty <em>complete</em> days, and they thought he meant that day on which he ascended should be included. </p>\n\n<p>On the 16th of Tammuz, the day on which the Jews <em>thought</em> he should return, they were concerned - maybe Moses had died up there? Why is he taking so long? Satan took advantage of their confusion and made the world look dark and bleak. The correct response should have been to have faith, wait it out; instead, the people took this as a sign that Moses was dead and resorted to hysteria. </p>\n\n<p>To directly answer your questions, then:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>No, your assertions are not correct; and</li>\n<li>Everyone had the proper intentions, just that the Jews should have responded differently to the test placed before them, and they failed. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I should highly emphasize here who, exactly, sinned with the Calf. According to the same commentator Rashi as above, it was <em>not</em> all of the Jews who sinned. On Exodus 34:1, regarding G-d telling Moses to carve out a new set of Tablets, Rashi gives a parable to explain why Moses had to do this. A king went overseas, and he left his wife among his maidservants. The maidservants sinned. To prevent rumors that the wife was the one who sinned, a loyal friend of the king’s tore up their marriage document, so that if anyone accuses her of having sinned, the friend can say that they were never married - where’s the marriage document? When the king returned, he saw that it was the maidservants who sinned, and he became appeased. His friend said the king should write a new marriage document; the king told him to prepare the paper, since he was the one who tore it, and the king would write a new document. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains the parable succinctly: the king is G-d, the wife is the Jewish people, the friend is Moses, <em>and the maidservants are the Mixed Multitude.</em> The Jews did not sin at the Golden Calf. It was only the Mixed Multitude that sinned. Most of the Jews passed the test - they just failed to stop the Mixed Multitude from sinning. </p>\n\n\n",

As such, <strong>one is free to make any use of it including making it suffer or killing it</strong> (don't rush!) as long as one benefits from it. If one does not benefit from injuring or killing HIS animals he's probably transgressing בל תשחית, but nothing from יורה דעה. (<em>See JT Shabbat 7,2 explanation of עורות אילים מרודמים that the animals were beaten to make their skin red, or Soyto 9-10 about letting the blood of an animal before sacrifice</em>). This approach is called scientifically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Anthropocentric Ecology\" or Anthropocentrism</a>.<br />\nThis is פשיטא from the explicit verses of the Torah:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ויברך אותם אלוקים ויאמר להם אלוקים פרו ורבו ומלאו את הארץ וכיבשוה ורדו בדגת הים ובעוף השמים ובכל חיה הרומשת על הארץ\"</p>\n<p>\"ומוראכם וחתכם יהיה על כל חית הארץ, ועל כל עוף השמים, בכל אשר תרמוש האדמה ובכל דגי הים, בידכם נתנו. כל רמש אשר הוא חי לכם יהיה לאוכלה כירק עשב נתתי לכם את הכל\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>The same logic applies to Hafker animals, that one is free to catch or make use of or kill for any need incl. fun (<em>Nodah BeYehuda openly permitted hunting for fun only, but many opposed</em>). Therefore, killing an animal is defaultively allowed and by itself does not fall under צעב\"ח at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The whole concept of צעב\"ח is questionable as all the Mitzvot we learn it from have some weird limitations, e.g שילוח הקן is limited to עוף טהור, אותו ואת בנו is limited to defectless animals, פריקה וטעינה is limited to חברך etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Therefore צעב\"ח was never unified in any form of Halacha, and it is only mentioned \"by the way\" when other Mitzvot are discussed (Se Rambam Avida, Rotzeah also in Shu\"A)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Most Poskim agree that the concept is used not as a practical Mitzvah, but as a tool to exercise one's Midos in order to mimic Hashem's qualities ( חסדים ורחמים). Therefore, the Mitzvah will not be the חפצא - to help the animal, but גברא - to use the situation to exhibit and exercise good Midos. The story about Rebbi (BM 85a shows exactly that - he did not show his sympathy), or the opposite - to prevent developing bad Middos such as cruelty (See Rem\"O אה\"ע סי' ה' סעי' י\"ד).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As the matter of Midos, two people might be acting completely differently and still \"performing the Mitzvah of צעב\"ח\" - One might express his compassion by killing it immediately, another might only pet it, and still another by spending a fortune to find a cure.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><em>I'm sorry to stop, I can go on and on but hope this will suffice.</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It is a sin not to put an animal out of its suffering of pain and keep it alive, <strong>when it has a constructive purpose</strong> in its death e.g shechita for the sake of food.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bava Bathra 73b:<br>\n  ואמר רבה בר בר חנה זימנא חדא הוה קא אזלינן במדברא וחזינן הנהו אווזי דשמטי גדפייהו משמנייהו וקא נגדי נחלי דמשחא מתותייהו אמינא להו אית לן בגוייכו חלקא לעלמא דאתי חדא דלי גדפא וחדא דלי אטמא כי אתאי לקמיה דרבי אלעזר אמר לי עתידין ישראל ליתן עליהן את הדין<br>\n  In summary Rabba bar bar Chana went to the desert on his travels and saw the fat geese that were so fat when they lifted their wings oil flowed out.

While the Rabbis have preferences for doing a Bracha in an appropriate fashion, you're still coming from an inherently good place if you made a mistake or didn't do something perfectly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Effort and intention matter just as much as action in this regard.</strong> That being said, once you become aware of proper method, you have a responsibility to adhere to the proper method whenever possible. </p>\n\n<p>We are taught that Brachot should be given our complete and full attention. When you are doing a Bracha, you are speaking to Hashem. You shouldn't be distracting yourself with other activities when doing one and you should momentarily stop and reflect on the Bracha with your full attention. - <em>If you were standing before a king, would you be busy with something else while greeting them or would you be giving them your full attention? This concept relates to making a Bracha.</em> </p>\n\n<p><strong>To answer your question:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Can you make a Bracha while walking?</em></p>\n\n<p>Yes but it isn't considered doing it in best possible form. There is actually a hierarchy.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>(<strong>Best</strong> form) - Sitting during Bracha.- <strong>Kaf HaChaim (OC 183:51)</strong> (exceptions being when making a Bracha over specific mitzva activities <strong>(see Pri Megadim, Introduction to Hilchot Brachot 18)</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>(<strong>Good</strong> form) - Standing and making Bracha. <strong>(Orach Chaim 183:11, with Mishnah Berurah 36 and Sha’ar HaTziyun 40)</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>(<strong>Acceptable</strong> form) If you are walking outside toward a fixed destination, and stopping will make you too anxious to focus on the bracha (i.e. stopping will actually decrease your level of concentration), then you could say the bracha while walking. <strong>(Orach Chaim 183:11, with Mishnah Berurah 36)</strong></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One thing to be aware of. The third point actually varies from person to person depending on their mental state and anxiety level. What that means is if you actually do for some reason have clearer concentration while walking vs standing still, you would be an exception to the rule. <strong>Of course, you'd need to seek guidance from your Rabbi to establish this.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The end goal of the guidance is to ensure that you can make the best possible Bracha with your full concentration. Distraction is the enemy. </p>\n\n<p><strong>I've attached a link to some materials on Brachot protocols that should clarify some things.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/blessings/24-Honor-for-Brachot.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/blessings/24-Honor-for-Brachot.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

The reason those two numbers have anything to do with φ is because they are in the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc., where each term is the sum of the previous two terms); it’s well-known (certainly amongst mathematicians, and to a great extent among non-mathematicians as well) that if you take any number in this list and divide it by the previous one, it will give an approximation of φ=1.618..., with the approximation getting more and more accurate as you get closer to infinity (in mathspeak, the series <em>converges</em> to φ). You can verify this with a calculator, but the twelfth Fibonacci number is 144, and the thirteenth is 233; thus, following the pattern stated above, 233/144 is approximately φ. (What this has anything to do with Gan Eden I will leave as an exercise to the reader.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>π in the Sky</h2>\n\n<p>Now, for something a bit different, but in the same vein as the example above. The following is often ascribed to the Vilna Gaon, but it seems that it’s actually from an article by one Rabbi Munk in the journal Sinai, from 1962.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud in Eruvin 14a derives that, for halachic purposes,<sup>1</sup> we can round off the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter as π=3, from the following verse, in I Kings 7:23:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיַּ֥עַשׂ אֶת־הַיָּ֖ם מוּצָ֑ק עֶ֣שֶׂר בָּ֠אַמָּה מִשְּׂפָת֨וֹ עַד־שְׂפָת֜וֹ עָגֹ֣ל ׀ סָבִ֗יב וְחָמֵ֤שׁ בָּֽאַמָּה֙ קוֹמָת֔וֹ וקוה [וְקָו֙] שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים בָּֽאַמָּ֔ה יָסֹ֥ב אֹת֖וֹ סָבִֽיב׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And [Solomon] made the Sea<sup>2</sup> of cast metal. [It was] ten cubits from one lip to the other lip, circular all around; its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits could surround it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ve translated this verse as literally as I can, with the first set of brackets replacing “he” with “Solomon” for context. The important part here is that it had a diameter of ten cubits and a circumference of thirty, yielding a ratio of π=3. </p>\n\n<p>The interesting part comes in when you notice that, in this verse - but not its parallel in II Chronicles 4:2 - the word וקו, “and a line,” is pronounced as if it were spelled that way, but it’s written as וקוה. In fact, this particular way it’s written is nearly unique to this verse among the sixteen places where the word appears (there are two others). </p>\n\n<p>The <em>vav</em> at the beginning of the word is just a conjunction, so we drop that, leaving the base words קו and קוה. The latter has a numerical value of 111, and the former has a numerical value of 106. Multiplying this ratio by three gives a pretty decent estimate of π=3.14150943; subtracting this from actual π yields an error of <0.000084!</p>\n\n<p>What’s more impressive is that, among the denominators under 30,000, <em>this is the second-best approximation there is</em> (but it’s a really close second). This corresponds to the fact that, in the continued fraction for π, 3+(1/(7+1/(15+1/(1+..., the approximation 3*111/106 is equivalent to the third layer of the infinitely expanding fraction. (I apologize for the messiness; these are the days I wish MY supported MathJax.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n\n<p>For further reading on the topic, I recently came across <a href=\"http://project314.org/314/rabbi-pi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>, which seems to be quoting <a href=\"http://www.math.ubc.ca/~israel/bpi/bpi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one</a>, which details some of the points I mentioned above, as well as some others. The former, on the other pages on the site, has some other fascinating estimations of π from other places in the Bible. </p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>Technically, this interpretation of the Gemara follows the Tosfos HaRosh there; the Aruch HaShulchan seems to learn that Gemara differently, in which we can only interpret this approximation as being relevant to Eiruvin. I follow Tosfos HaRosh here simply because it’s easier to explain the Gemara, IMO, according to his reading. </p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>In context, the “Sea of Solomon” refers to a basin he built in the Temple used by the priests for washing their hands and feet before serving. As derived by the Talmud quoted above, the Sea was cylindrical at the top and rectangular toward the bottom.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I found it quite interesting.

    "content": "# Criteria for special formats of some chapters in the Tanach Scrolls\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Usually, when writing verses in Tanach Scrolls, words are written across the column from the right margin to the left (except, of course, for required Parsha spacing.)</p>\n\n<p>I have seen two \"special\" formats:</p>\n\n<p>The \"brick\" layout, which seems to be reserved for \"songs\". Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shirat Hayam (Song of the Sea) in Shemot</li>\n<li>Devorah's song in Shoftim (Judges)</li>\n<li>David's song in Shmuel II (Samuel II)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The 2 column straight layout. Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ha'azinu near the end of Sefer Devarim (Deut.)</li>\n<li>Words beginning \"To everything there is a time\" in Kohelet (Ecclessiastes)</li>\n<li>List of Haman's 10 sons in Esther</li>\n<li>Tehillim, Mishlei, and most of Iyov</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The 4 column straight layout. Example (the only one?):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The kings in Yehoshua</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What common theme or criteria are used to decide which layout to use for which of these areas? </p>\n\n<p>From what I can tell, the \"brick\" layout seems to reserved for \"songs\", though <em>ha'azinu</em> is called a \"song\" and it has the 2 column layout. </p>\n\n<p>Why are these specific layouts appropriate for these areas? (I.e. - why choose one layout vs. the other?) Why does it get any layout at all?

It's important to note that there are differences, sometimes significant, between various manuscripts we have in terms of how each scribe wrote each song or song-like section.</p>\n<p>He concludes from his analysis of the manuscripts<sup>1</sup> and the differing views in the gemara that the key factor in deciding how to write the song section is the internal division of each of the verses of that section - how many groupings of words are there in a verse, and how many words in each grouping. The differences between manuscripts he puts down to there being no halachic need to write in any particular song-format; the scribe just had to follow his tradition of פתוחות and סתומות, and to make sure that internal verse division still made sense to some extent, as he saw fit. In other words, in most cases, it was up to the scribe to decide the exact format.</p>\n<p>As for why not just write straight across, it seems that it was obvious to the ancient scribes that songs should be written in a special format, likely to emphasize that they were to be read as songs. Later on, as internal structural divisions in other lists in the Tanach became more apparent to the scribes, they were also written in special format - though what that format was exactly depended on the choice of the scribe.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> He examined eight manuscripts, plus compared the original Mikraot Gedolot from Venice, and a few other editions of Tanach.</p>\n\n\n",

Enosh himself was one\n  of those who erred.</p>\n  \n  <p>Their mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres\n  with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated\n  them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him.\n  Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat\n  them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed\n  be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and\n  honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him\n  be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.</p>\n  \n  <p>After conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to\n  the stars and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify\n  them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by\n  doing so, they would - according to their false conception - be\n  fulfilling the will of God.</p>\n  \n  <p>This was the essence of the worship of false gods, and this was the\n  rationale of those who worshiped them. They would not say that there\n  is no other god except for this star.</p>\n  \n  <p>This message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared (10:7-8): \"Who\n  will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting.\n  Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there\n  is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless [notion. They\n  conceive of their] empty teachings as wood;\" i.e., all know that You\n  alone are God.

It\n  is appropriate to serve it and fear it. Their priests would tell them:\n  This service will enable you to multiply and be successful. Do this\n  and this, or do not do this or this.</p>\n  \n  <p>Subsequently, other deceivers arose and declared that a specific star,\n  sphere, or angel had spoken to them and commanded them: Serve me in\n  this manner. He would then relate a mode of service [telling them:] Do\n  this, do not do this.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, these practices spread throughout the world. People would serve\n  images with strange practices - one more distorted than the other -\n  offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them. As the years passed,\n  [God's] glorious and awesome name was forgotten by the entire\n  population. [It was no longer part of] their speech or thought, and\n  they no longer knew Him. Thus, all the common people, the women, and\n  the children would know only the image of wood or stone and the\n  temples of stone to which they were trained from their childhood to\n  bow down and serve, and in whose name they swore.</p>\n  \n  <p>The wise men among them would think that there is no God other than\n  the stars and spheres for whose sake, and in resemblance of which,\n  they had made these images.

The Magen Avraham there says it is proper manners to participate as well if the congregation is reading other things such as Psalm 145. The Mishna Berura there also lists Alenu as an example of such \"other things\". Igrot Moshe (YD 4:61:8) says you can't say Kaddish after something unless you participated in it a bit, so if you want to say Kaddish be sure to participate in that thing (though if you already said Kaddish earlier maybe sharing is more appropriate).</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Arukh OC 215:2</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>השומע אחד מישראל מברך אחת מכל הברכות, אף-על-פי שלא שמע כלה מתחילתה ועד סופה, אף-על-פי שאינו חיב באותה ברכה, חיב לענות אחריו אמן<br>\n  One who hears a Jew bless one of the blessings, ... even if he isn't obligated in that blessing, is obligated to answer after him \"Amen.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That ought to handle a bunch more of your cases. </p>\n\n<p>The Rashba (Responsum 1:249) quotes a Rav Yehonatan who prohibits reciting Kedusha a second time if you already said it earlier elsewhere, but he disagrees.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Arukh OC 128:28</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כהן שנשא כפיו ואחר כך הלך לבית הכנסת אחר ומצא צבור שלא הגיעו לברכת כהנים יכול לישא את כפיו פעם אחרת<br>\n  A Kohein who raised his hands and then went to another synagogue and found a community that hadn't reached the Kohein's blessing is allowed to raise his hands another time</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is true even though generally adding on to the blessing is a prohibition of Bal Tosif. The Mishna Berura notes that he isn't obligated to go up and bless again, just he is allowed to if he wants. If he isn't going to go up the Arukh Hashulchan recommends leaving the room in advance so people don't wonder about his lineage.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the rules of honoring Torah scrolls (eg. standing when it is in transit) are not part of the prayer service per se and apply always.

While fasts like tisha ba'av or other derabanans can be pushed off (called a nicdche), yom kippur is only on the specific day.\nThat being said, there is a story with a famous gadol (forget which), that when the doctor told him he wouldn't be able to fast on yom kippur, he said something along the lines of all these years I did what Hashem wanted by not eating, but this year I am going to do what Hashem wants by eating.

That which the Torah or the rabbi's command are for a specific date and if one can't fast on that date then there is no fast. Making up a fast is only when we promised to fast on a day not obligated by  the Torah or rabbis and that obligation comes from our own neder or vow. Our own vows we can make up, not specific perscribed days. This is because our vow doesn't really mean specifically that day, but to afflict ourselves as an atonement and for retrospection. This can really be done any day therefore can be made up. Vows can be made up time doesn't return.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>In general, if one cannot fast Yom Kippur and is directed not to fast by his/her LOR then it is likely to be considered a case of Pikuach Nefesh and it is even considered a mitzva to break one's fast to preserve their life!</p>\n\n<p>I dont have any sources off hand, but it is common knowledge in mainstream Judaism that when once is patur (exempt) from something such as fasting, they do not need to \"make it up\" as their obligation to fast has been discharged.</p>\n\n\n",

However, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%A9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph Messas</a> has a responsum where he seems to apply this rule beyond the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>succah</em>. The question he was asked involved a certain case where two couples needed to get married but it was during the time period of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_of_the_Omer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>sefirat ha'omer</em></a> when weddings are customarily not held. One of the arguments that R. Messas advanced to permit the weddings in this case was that not being married is considered \"a great pain\", and if one is exempt from a biblical commandment (<em>succah</em>) on account of pain, one is certainly exempt from a mere custom on account of pain:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1911&pgnum=186\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mayim Chayim 1:197</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד דעדיפא  שהרי אף במצות סוכה שהיא דאורייתא אמרו רז\"ל מצטער פטור מן הסוכה כמ\"ש בסוכה דף כ\"ו ע\"א וכ\"פ רבינו הטור ומרן ז\"ל בש\"ע בסי' תר\"ם ע\"ש וא\"כ כ\"ש הכא שאינו אלא מנהג לזכר אבילות ישנה ויש צער גדול לאדם להיות שרוי בלא אשה ואין לו מי שישמשנו פשיטא דדיינו להעמיד הלכתא כדעת מהר\"ם לונזאנו והרפ\"ח ז\"ל והחולקים עליהם הפריזו על המידה בזה אחר המח\"ר מקדושת עצמותם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the exemption for pain was a unique facet of the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>succah</em> then it would not necessarily follow that it can exempt one from a custom.</p>\n\n<p>However, this responsum was severely critiqued by R. Nosson Nota Leiter. R. Leiter wrote that heaven forfend to use such an argument. He pointed out that by using such an argument one can eat chicken and milk that got mixed together because it is only a rabbinic prohibition and it causes the person pain to be unable to eat his meal. If such pain can override the biblical commandment of <em>succah</em>, it should certainly override the rabbinic injunction against eating chicken and milk, according to R. Messas's reasoning:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shu\"t Tziyun L'nefesh Chaya # 29</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מש\"כ בסימן קצ\"ז לענין נשואין בספירה ונתן טעם אחד ק\"ו מסוכה דהיא מ\"ע\n  מה\"ת ופטור מצטער מכש\"כ כאן מנהג בעלמא דמותר משום צער ע\"ז אני אומר ח\"ו\n  להשתמש בק\"ו זה כי יצא מזה קל לחומר ואם יתערב בסעודתו בשר עוף וחלב נאמר\n  שהוא מצטער לאסור לו סעודתו והוא רק איסור דרבנן נתיר לו לאוכלו ח\"ו לא\n  תהא כזאת בישראל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Leiter went on to state that the exemption of pain is a unique feature of the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>succah</em>, and even by <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tefillin</a></em> someone in pain is only exempt because the pain will prevent him from properly concentrating on the <em>tefillin</em> which is a requirement.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וסוכה היא מצוה מיוחדת שבה נאמר הקבלה כי מצטער פטור ואם מצינו גם\n  בתפילין הלא נאמר טעמו מפני שאסור להסיח דעת מהם ומצטער א\"א שלא להסיח\n  דעתו מהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, R. Leiter might not have been aware that this argument was not a novel idea from R. Messas. In fact this very argument was used by no less than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_ben_Solomon_ibn_Abi_Zimra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. David Ibn Zimra</a> in a similar responsum. The question there dealt with cutting hair on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Chodesh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Rosh Chodesh</em></a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Iyar</em></a>. One of the arguments advanced to permit this was that refraining from cutting hair during <em>sefirat ha'omer</em> is merely a custom, and having overgrown hair is \"pain\", and if pain can exempt one from a biblical commandment (<em>succah</em>) it can certainly exempt one from this custom:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1952&pgnum=243\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Radvaz 2:687</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תו איכא טעמא דאיכא צער בגידול השיער למי שרגיל להסתפר ולא עדיף האי\n  מנהגא ממצות עשה של סוכה דקי\"ל מצטער פטור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. David Ibn Zimra actually went a step further in another responsum where he used the argument for an actual rabbinic obligation (as opposed to just a custom). There the question concerned whether a sick person has to do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shnayim_mikra_ve-echad_targum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>shenayim mikra</em></a>. He answered that such a person is completely exempt from this obligation as since he is in the category of \"one in pain\" and he would even be exempt from the biblical commandment of <em>succah</em>, he is surely exempt from a rabbinic obligation.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1952&st=&pgnum=320&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Radvaz 3:425 (867)</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולענין החולה רואה אני שהוא פטור לגמרי ולא יהא אלא מצטער שהוא פטור מן\n  הסוכה שהיא מצות עשה של תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once again, if the exemption of \"pain\" was due to some unique aspect of the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>succah</em>, the above argument would not necessarily follow.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This question is asked by the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47092&pgnum=62\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Be'er Yosef</strong></a> to Leviticus 23:42-43. Here's a summary of what he writes, with some extra sources.</p>\n\n<p>We find two seemingly contradictory aspects to the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em>. On the one hand, it connotes exile. Some explain <sup>1</sup> this is the rationale for why the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em> is juxtaposed to Yom Kippur. Just like Yom Kippur atones for a person’s sins, so does exile. A person should atone for their sins by exiling themself to their <em>sukkah</em>. In fact, if G-d forbid a person was decreed with exile due to their sins, they can “fulfill” this decree by exiling themself to their <em>sukkah</em>. We even see this in the laws of <em>sukkah</em> itself. If a person lives all year in a <em>sukkah</em>, they can’t fulfill their <em>mitzvah</em> by living there during the festival of <em>Sukkos</em> <sup>2</sup>. They must leave this structure and enter a different <em>sukkah</em>. We see there is an aspect of exile associated with the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em>. This idea strengthens the above question. Why is a person exempt from the <em>mitzvah</em> if they are in pain? If anything, staying there would be a greater manifestation of the aspect of exile associated with the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em> <sup>3</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em> expresses joy and pleasure. The <em>Midrash</em> <sup>4</sup> points out that the Torah mentions no idea of joy with the festival of <em>Pesach</em>, only once mentions it <sup>5</sup> with the festival of <em>Shavuos</em>, yet mentions it three times <sup>6</sup> with the festival of <em>Sukkos</em> <sup>7</sup>. This is because we are overjoyed after <em>Yom Kippur</em> that our sins have been atoned. As well, <em>Sukkos</em> coincides with the harvest season, where a person is overjoyed at the bounty they have received from Hashem. Many authorities <sup>8</sup> even hold that the physical pleasure one receives from dwelling in the <em>sukkah</em> is the essence of the <em>mitzvah</em> and not just a tangential aspect. This seemingly contradicts the idea that a <em>sukkah</em> connotes exile, which is associated with pain and discomfort.</p>\n\n<p>However, these two ideas are not contradictory at all. In fact, they are one in the same, with the same intent and manifestation. The Torah wants us to be exiled from our permanent dwelling places and to dwell in the <em>sukkah</em>. Yet we are obligated to experience great joy living in the <em>sukkah</em>, enjoying the physical pleasure it provides. All of this is to remind us of the great <em>chesed</em> that Hashem did for us when He took us out of Egypt. In essence, the Jews were exiled from their then homeland of Egypt. Usually when a nation is exiled from one land to another, their experiences are full of pain and suffering. They are starving, dehydrated, their clothing becomes ragged, they can’t sleep, etc. This wasn’t so when they Jews were taken out of Egypt. Hashem surrounded them with the Clouds of Glory, which protected them from the elements of the wilderness. They were given the <em>mun</em>, the manna from Heaven to eat. They were given water from the well of Miriam. The Clouds of Glory even cleaned their clothing that they were wearing <sup>9</sup>. They lacked nothing, as if they were living in paradise and not in the wilderness. To remember all of these miracles, we were commanded to dwell in <em>sukkos</em>. There, we are able to experience the seemingly contradictory ideas of exile and joy.</p>\n\n<p>This also explains why a person who is in pain is exempt from the mitzvah of <em>sukkah</em>. If a person is in pain and stays in the <em>sukkah</em>, they are going against the intention behind the <em>mitzvah</em>. They are also considered an simpleton, since they in fact missed the point behind the festival of <em>Sukkos</em>. They should have been filled with joy, taking great pleasure in the <em>sukkah</em>. Through this they would have remembered all the miracles that Hashem performed for the Jews when they left Egypt. They would have then fulfilled the verse “in order for your generations to know that I placed the Children of Israel in <em>sukkos</em> when I took them out of the land of Egypt” <sup>10</sup>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So we see that because of the unique nature behind the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em>, that's why it has this special dispensation when there is pain.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <strong>Maharil</strong> <em>Hilchos Sukkos</em> § 2, 4.

The <em>gemarra</em> says this is because of the rule that <em>mitzvos</em> were not given for physical pleasure, so the <em>neder</em> isn’t valid. The <strong>Machaneh Ephraim</strong> <em>Hilchos Nedarim</em> § 25 asks based on <strong>Tosafos</strong> in <strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> 28a s.v. המודר הנאה (who say even without the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em> there’s physical pleasure dwelling there), the pleasure would seem to be tangential to the <em>mitzvah</em>. Therefore, the rule that <em>mitzvos</em> were not given for physical pleasure shouldn’t apply. All that says is the fulfillment of a <em>mitzvah</em> isn’t considered physical pleasure or benefit (<strong>Ran</strong> to <strong>Nedarim</strong> 15b). Why then is someone who makes this <em>neder</em> permitted to dwell in the <em>sukkah</em>? The <strong>Oneg Yom Tov</strong> <em>Orach Chaim</em> § 50, <strong>Teshuvos Chemdas Shlomo</strong> <em>Orach Chaim</em> § 23, and <strong>Teshuvos Rabbi Akiva Eiger</strong> II § 138 explain that the <em>neder</em> would work only when the pleasure is distinct from the fulfillment of the <em>mitzvah</em>. Not true for the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em>, where the pleasure of dwelling there is the <em>mitzvah</em> itself. Therefore, it would be permitted to dwell in the <em>sukkah</em> despite the pleasure they receive from it, since the rule <em>mitzvos</em> weren’t given for pleasure would apply. Even though the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>sukkah</em> would seem to have been given for personal pleasure, perhaps there’s a difference between <em>mitzvos</em> being given for pleasure and <em>mitzvos</em> obligating pleasure</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> <strong>Rashi</strong> to <strong>Deuteronomy</strong> 8:7</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> <strong>Leviticus</strong> 23:43</p>\n\n\n",

Or, is there some other reason for fasting?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Fasting allows introspection. When you are well fed you are all too aware of yourself. When you step back from physical pleasures, you can focus more sincerely on repentance, or on the solemn ideas of the day. (But pain is a distraction, so it's important to prepare well for the fast.)</p>\n<p>Also, fasting is a form of self-sacrifice. Medieval works suggest a person fasts whenever he does <em>teshuva</em>.</p>\n<p>About Yom Kippur, the Maharal writes, the soul dwells completely in the body through the five enjoyments. These make the body match up to a soul — through being a place of life, unique, wholesome, clean and aloof. These are attributes of the soul, which accordingly has five names: נפש, רוח, נשמה, יחידה, חיה.</p>\n<p>By refraining from these enjoyments, the soul is slightly removed from the body. This is appropriate for a day in which the soul is cleansed from sins that the body dragged it into committing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In his excellent book <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/teshuva.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">“Teshuvah”</a>, R' Immanuel Bernstein suggests: The translation of וְעִנִּיתֶ֖ם אֶת־נַפְשֹֽׁתֵיכֶ֑ם is not to “afflict” but to “unsettle”. He derives this from the fact that the amount of food which would cause punishment is not an olive's bulk as elsewhere, but a fat date, which is more. Our sages understood that the amount of the fat date is sufficient to settle one's mind.</p>\n<p>Being unsettled physically is likely to lead to a more productive form of introspection.</p>\n<p>(similar answer to that of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/95554/16706\">HaLeiVi</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is not a comprehensive answer and my knowledge is small, but here are some helpful texts on \"other reasons\" for fasting.</p>\n<p>In Daniel 9, Daniel fasts and prays after reading in Jeremiah how Hashem promised deliverance from exile when the seventy years in Babylon were completed. In this prayer, Daniel confesses the sin of the people as a whole and pleads with Hashem for mercy. Daniel's prayer expresses grief over sins and a strong desire for Hashem's deliverance in fulfillment of His promises. Likewise, if we grieve over our sin, fasting is a way of humbling ourselves before Hashem while asking for mercy. (See also Ahab's fasting in 1 Kings 21:27-29, of which it is written \"Ahab humbled himself\", and Hashem had mercy.)</p>\n<p>See also Isaiah 58 and Zechariah 7 for helpful perspectives on the heart behind fasting.</p>\n\n\n",

He collected what he thought fit into one of the 12 pillars which he writes about in his introduction.

One such example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_of_Modena\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehudah Aryeh of Modena</a>. As he states in his introduction to his work <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/44360\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis Yehudah</a>, he collected additional statements of Chazal and wrote a commentary on some of them called HaBoneh.

Should they go see the kohen gadol or see the burning of the bull and he-goat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It would seem that the key is the Gemara (Yoma 70a) on this Mishnah. Most of these quotes can be found on Sefaria, and for the one that can’t, I’ve provided a link to HebrewBooks. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרואה כהן גדול כו' לא מפני שאינו רשאי פשיטא  מהו דתימא כדריש לקיש  דאמר ריש לקיש  אין מעבירין על המצות ומאי מצוה (משלי יד, כח) ברב עם הדרת מלך קמ\"ל</p>\n  \n  <p>“One who sees the High Priest...not because he’s not allowed.” This is obvious! [What reason <em>should</em> there be to prohibit going to just one?] What might you have thought [without the Mishnah saying this]? Like Reish Lakish, for Reish Lakish said, “We don’t pass over Mitzvos.” And what Mitzvah [would apply here]? “In a multitude of the people is the glory of the king.” [Therefore, everyone should go to the Temple to hear the Torah reading - Rashi.] It therefore comes to teach us [that it is permissible to go to either one]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara doesn’t explain <em>why</em> this teaching doesn’t apply, though. Rashi explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קמ\"ל - דלאו מעבר הוא מאחר שאינו עסוק בה:</p>\n  \n  <p>“It comes to teach us” that he is not passing over, since he is not directly involved in it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this explanation, the teaching of Reish Lakish is completely inapplicable to the Mishnah - but the verse in Proverbs may still be relevant.</p>\n\n<p>That still doesn’t help us, though, given how Rashi learns the preceding line:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומאי מצוה - יש בראייתן יש כאן מצוה משום ברוב עם הדרת מלך:</p>\n  \n  <p>“And what Mitzvah” is there in seeing them? There is here the Mitzvah of “in a multitude of the people is the glory of the king.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seeing <em>them</em>. It’s not clear to me whether “them” refers to the cow and goat being burned, or whether “them” refers to the Torah reading and the burning. It <em>is</em> clear, however, to the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=11443&rid=9054\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orah v’Simcha (§73 on Rambam Hil. Avodas Yom HaKippurim)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאיכא מצוה בראיית הקריאה ובראיית השריפה משום ברוב עם הדרת מלך וסד\"א דאסור להניח מצוה זו ולילך לקראת מצוה אחרת קמ\"ל דמותר מטעם שביאר רש\"י שם כיון שאינו עסיק בה</p>\n  \n  <p>For there is a mitzvah is seeing the reading and in seeing the burning, because of “in a multitude of the people there is the glory of the king,” and I might have thought that it’s forbidden to leave this mitzvah and go to another one. The Mishnah comes to teach us [that it’s fine], for the reason that Rashi explains there, that since he’s not involved in it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s clear from his ending that he’s working in Rashi’s understanding the Gemara; therefore, he learns Rashi according to the second approach I posed above. (After the above quote, he poses a problem with fitting this approach into the Rambam, but ultimately he infers that this is indeed the Rambam’s position.)<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Steinsaltz takes a hard stance on it referring <em>specifically</em> to the Torah reading:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומאי [ומה] מצוה יש כאן בשמיעת הקריאה מפי הכהן הגדול</p>\n  \n  <p>“And what mitzvah” is there here in hearing the reading from the mouth of the High Priest? [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this approach, it would seem that one should go to hear the Torah being read, along the same line of logic as above. </p>\n\n<p>The Ritva has a completely different understanding of the question Gemara that may shed a different light on its conclusion. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא מפני שאינו רשאי פשיט׳. כלומר פשיטא דרשאי להניח קריאת התורה וללכת לראות שריפת הפרים דאע״גב דאמרינן ועוזבי ה׳ יכלו זה המניח ספר תורה ויוצא הרי רשאי לצאת בכאן בין פרשת אחרי מות לפרשת בעשור שאפילו בין גברא לגברא מותר וכ״ש בין פרשה לפרשה ואע״ג דתרווייהו בחד גברא: </p>\n  \n  <p>“Not because it’s impermissible - that’s obvious!” That is to say: it’s obvious that you can leave the reading of the Torah to go see the cows being burned, for even though we say “‘Those who abandon Hashem will be destroyed’ - this refers to one who leaves a Sefer Torah and goes out,” here it’s permissible to leave, between Parshas Acharei Mos and Parshas Asor, for even between two people it’s permitted, and certainly between two sections, even if they are read by the same person. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ritva does not address the conclusion of the Gemara. However, notice that, unlike Rashi, he learns the question as leaving the Torah reading to watch the cows being burned, rather than initially choosing to go rather than stay and listen. It would seem from that understanding of the Gemara that it’s assumed that you’ll go and listen, and Reish Lakish is only brought up as a potential reason to <em>stay</em>. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now, “in a multitude of the people” would seem to indicate that whatever your interpretation of the Gemara’s initial position, that would be the preferable thing to see (not to say that it’s required, as per the Gemara’s conclusion). Therefore:</p>\n\n<p>According to the Orah v’Simchah’s reading of Rashi and the Rambam, it would seem to not matter which one, though once you choose, you should stick with it. </p>\n\n<p>According to Steinsaltz, it would seem that one should preferably go to hear the Torah reading. For different reasons, this would seem to be the Ritva’s approach as well. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>He later answers your parenthetical question about why it says “seeing” and not “hearing”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצ\"ע והא השומע כעונה וא\"כ זה הרואה כה\"ג קורא הא הוי בכלל עוסק במצוות דשומע כעונה והרי זה עוסק בתלמוד תורה, ואפשר לומר דאיה\"נ אלו השומעים אסור להם לצאת ורק הרואין אמרו, שהיו שם כל העם ולא כולם היו יכולים לשמוע.</p>\n  \n  <p>And [Rashi’s explanation] requires looking into, for one who hears is like one who says, and therefore, this one who sees the High Priest reading should be considered being involved in a Mitzvah, for, due to “one who hears us like one who says,” he is toiling in Torah! Perhaps you can say that, indeed, those who hear him may not leave; only those who “see” did they say [can leave]. For the whole people is there, and not everyone could hear. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He notes at the end that it’s obvious from this whole discussion that there’s no obligation to hear the Torah reading, or else there would be no possibility of anyone watching the burning. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Lethal experiments on terminally ill patients\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This incident may not have happened exactly as listed, but that's not the point. For the purpose of this question, we'll assume it did. During World War II, The scientists at the Manhattan Project wanted to know how certain radioactive chemicals are metabolized. They designed an experiment in which they took several terminally ill patients and injected them (or fed them) lethal doses of the radioactive chemicals. The excrement of the patients was monitored. The rationale behind this experiment was the subjects' illnesses would kill them before the chemicals anyways, so they weren't really doing any harm. </p>\n\n<p>So what is the halachic view of this? Could a Jew be part of this experiment? On one hand, they were expected to die anyways, so the radioactivity wasn't likely to kill them. And if you'll say they could've recovered through some miracle, then they could also be saved from the chemicals by a miracle! On the other hand, you could also say that scientists don't really know how long someone will live, and you can't needlessly inject toxic chemicals into yourself.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Judaism values life very highly. Any experiment that would potentially shorten life without a chance to extend it would be prohibited. It is not clear from your question whether the experiment would possibly save the patient life or other patient lives and I will assume for now it does not.</p>\n\n<p>R Abraham S. Abraham (in <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578197125.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nishmat Avraham vol. 2</a>, p. 54ff) provides many <em>halachic</em> opinions (e.g., Gilyon Maharsha, Shevut Yaakov, Achiezer, R Shlomo Zalman Auerbach) that it is permitted to take a treatment that would possibly endanger one's life <strong>if</strong> it has the potential to extend it. One is permitted to endanger <em>chayei sha'ah</em> (the short time to live untreated) for the sake of <em>chayei olam</em> (his full life span), after consultation with multiple doctors and halachic authorities.</p>\n\n<p>However in your case, it doesn't look like the radioactive chemical experiment is designed to save lives, and certainly not the one of patient to be experimented on. Based on this, I don't see how it could be permitted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Add-on: I have now seen that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rosner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fred Rosner</a> (a well-known specialist in Jewish medical ethics) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_David_Tendler\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Moshe David Tendler</a> (a Rosh Yeshiva at YU and son-in-law of R Moshe Feinstein) wrote (<a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books/about/Practical_Medical_Halacha.html?id=9HNFAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Practical medical halacha</a>, p. 90)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jewish law is categorically opposed to any form of experimentation in\n  which the human organism serves as an experimental animal, if there is\n  the slightest hazard to the individual taking part in the experiment,\n  without concomitant benefit to the same individual.

    "content": "# Why don't we maximize our merits on Yom Kippur day through Mitzvos and Torah study?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question deals with the procedures on YK itself, not the 10 days of repentance.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam (Hichot Teshuva 3) says that YK is dedicated for Beynonim, i.g. those whose merits equal to sins. Further he claims that the final verdict of YK is based on weighing one's merits vs sins and not how hard one davens on Yom Kippur. </p>\n\n<p>My logic says that the whole YK day must be dedicated to maximizing one's merits thru performing as many Mitzvot and especially Torah learning, as the greatest Mitzvah of them all - Peah 1:1 as one can, just as Rambam prescribes for the 10 days of repentance.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we do almost \"nothing Halachicly valuable\" on Yom Kippur, besides the one-time Mitzvah of Viduy (Teshuvah) and the regular Teffila amd Krishm\"A (as for Rambam). No obligatory Torah study, no Tzedaka on YK, no procreation etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why we don't try to maximize our merits on Yom Kippur through engaging in Mitzvot and Torah learning</strong>?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>NB: Do you think opening a Kolel \"Yom Kippur Torah\" for those who can't daven for 6 hours straight is a viable option?</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rambam himself says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.3.3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuvah 3:3</a> that a person who is ‘hanging in the balance’ (i.e. has the same ‘number’ of merits and sins) must do teshuvah by Yom Kippur in order to be ‘sealed for life’.</p>\n\n<p>“Wait!”, I hear you say. “Why does he need to do teshuvah? Surely any other mitzvah will be enough to ‘tip the scales’?”</p>\n\n<p>R. Yitzchak Blazer in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ohr_Yisrael%2C_Kokhavei_Ohr.5.5?vhe=Ohr_Yisrael,_Vilna_1900&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kochvei Ohr chap. 5</a> answers that the sin of not doing teshuvah when presented with the opportunity to do so, will outweigh any other possible mitzvah one could do. </p>\n\n<p>You have no other option. If you want to be sealed for good, you’re going to need to sincerely repent before Yom Kippur is done.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have a possible direction (based on my Rabbi's books on Teshuva - בית גנזי) of a reason for the fact that our YK is contradicting Rambam's description of Teshuva. I will only outline it and ask for sources that support that hypothesis:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>While balancing the merits is one way to win YK, there's an alternative to it. It is based on the theoretical ability of a person to nullify his \"reality\" and to be reborn as a \"tabula rasa\" (blank slate).</p></li>\n<li><p>It can be traced to how Avraham presented himself to G-d (Ber 18,27): \"וְאָנֹכִי עָפָר וָאֵפֶר\" (\"I who am but dust and ashes.\"). In Hassidus this is based on Tosefta Temurah (30b) \"ומודה ר' אליעזר באפרוח שיצא מביצה טרפה שיקרב לגבי מזבח\", that \"A chick that came from a Treyfah egg is Kosher\" because the egg \"turned to dust\" before it became a chik. Similarly, if a person turns himself into dust (metaphorically of course) he will ultimately become Kosher.</p></li>\n<li><p>As Rambam mentions in place there's no Teshuva on YK for Reshoyim, as those who have negative balance are immediately signed for death. Therefore, seemingly, YK only helps Beynonim, which we all ascribe ourselves. However, the alternative approach works for all.</p></li>\n<li><p>The idea is that a person (practically all of us) that considers himself as Beynoni (or maybe a Rashah) is more concerned with his fear to \"lose it all\" than with the opportunity to do Mitzvos to change the balance. Therefore he spends the whole day in an attempt to achieve some kind of personal nullification to be considered a \"new person\" and therefore \"sin free\". </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

However, on 621:4 the Mishna Berurah writes (about a Chazzan who moves) \"ויש למחות - דהרי שנינו אפילו נחש כרוך על עקבו לא יפסיק:\", referencing the mechaber in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.104.3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">104</a> even though the mechaber actually says (\"ואפי' נחש כרוך על עקבו לא יפסיק <strong>אבל יכול לילך למקום אחר</strong> כדי שיפול הנחש מרגלו)\". </p>\n\n<p>He then reverses his course in the next entry as he describes the prevalent practice,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל כבר פשט המנהג שגם הש\"ץ עושה כן ונראה שהם סומכין דהליכה לא מקרי הפסק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But wouldn't moving in order to do a proper bowing be l'tzorech?

Why would the M\"B consider it a hefsek in the first place (this is, ignoring that in one place he SAYS that halicha isn't a hefsek, and then he elsewhere says that it is)? </p>\n\n<p>I have seen a Chazzan \"jump\" away from the lectern as if hopping is less halicha (is it?) but if the proper bowing is an important part of the davening, why would walking a pace or two be a problem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yJjCKPsE3MQJ:https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/02-17-15/%20&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> that lists numerous situations where one may walk in the middle of Amidah.

There are different styles and methods of learning as well like <em>aliba d'hilcheta</em>, Brisker, and others(to name a few).</p>\n\n<p>The main point of Talmud Torah is in <em>knowing</em> the Torah(Binyan Av) so that one may fulfill the mitzvot. This means knowing the halachot and practical conclusions and aspects of fulfilling the mitzvot as required by the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, all of the above constitute the mitzvah of Talmud Torah. </p>\n\n<p>When reciting pesukim, however, it is forbidden to recite them by heart unless they are pesukim commonly cited(and it is required to recite them correctly so that their transmission doesn't change as a result of your mistake; hence the issur and see here <a href=\"http://www.chaburas.org/byheart.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chaburas.org/byheart.html</a>). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>A great theoretical question that pinpoints to the lack of an accepted definition for such a common term.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Mitzvahs need intentions</strong> (שולחן ערוך, אורח חיים, סימן ס', סעיף ד).

    "content": "# What is the history and origin of the Etz Chayim symbol and the 10 Sefiroth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question is related to the question 'what is the origin of the Hebrew language?' since Hebrew is a key part of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. However, the question of Hebrew language origins seems to have more historic and archeological answers than the Kabbalistic symbol's origins. Hebrew language may still be relevant nonetheless; if Hebrew language is thought to stem from Canaanite language/Phoenician alphabet (the first alphabet!) and that from Ancient Egyptian language, where/when did the Tree of Life symbol and organization of the Alephbet and Sefiroth come to be? If the Tree of Life symbol is from the time of Abraham, was the Phoenician Alephbet used in designating the 22 paths?</p>\n<p>From what I can tell, the 10 Sefirot are first attributed to Sefer Yetzirah, which has authorship ascribed to Abraham who lived sometime in the 2nd millennium  BCE. That would mean the 10 Sefirot were written on Earth earlier than the Torah which was first written in Moshe's time (a few hundred years later than Abraham's time). Again on the language point, from what I can tell, at both those times either no alephbet existed yet or Phoenician/Paleo-Hebrew was used. Since Sefer Yetzirah practically details the Hebrew language, I wonder about the relationship between the origin of Hebrew and the Sefer Yetzirah (which is perhaps the introduction of the Tree of Life symbol).</p>\n<p>Regardless of language timing, I'm not sure if the Tree of Life symbol itself can be said to have been introduced in Abraham's time, given the claim that Sefer Yetzirah's Sefirot do not correspond to that of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life we see today:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"An intimate relation exists between the Sefer Yetzirah and the later mystics; and <strong>although there is a marked difference between the later Kabbalah and the Sefer Yetzirah (for instance, the Sefirot of the Kabbalists do not correspond to those of the Sefer Yetzirah)</strong>, the system laid down in the latter is the first visible link in the development of Kabbalistic ideas.\"</p>\n<p>via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Yetzirah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Yetzirah</a> which cites it to: Singer, Isidore; et al., eds.

    "content": "# Is Mashiach going to come in Nissan/Tishrei, or can he come at any time?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Rosh HaShanah 10b-11a says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא רבי אליעזר אומר בתשרי נברא העולם בתשרי נולדו אבות בתשרי מתו אבות בפסח נולד יצחק בראש השנה נפקדה שרה רחל וחנה בראש השנה יצא יוסף מבית האסורין בר\"ה בטלה עבודה מאבותינו במצרים בניסן נגאלו <strong>בתשרי עתידין ליגאל</strong> ר' יהושע אומר בניסן נברא העולם בניסן נולדו אבות בניסן מתו אבות בפסח נולד יצחק בר\"ה נפקדה שרה רחל וחנה בר\"ה יצא יוסף מבית האסורין בר\"ה בטלה עבודה מאבותינו במצרים בניסן נגאלו <strong>בניסן עתידין ליגאל</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Focusing on the boldfaced portions: According to R’ Eliezer, Mashiach will come in Tishrei; according to R’ Yehoshua, Mashiach will come in Nissan. It’s clear that this refers to the coming of Mashiach specifically from the explanation of R’ Eliezer’s opinion brought on 11b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בתשרי עתידין ליגאל אתיא שופר שופר כתיב הכא תקעו בחדש שופר וכתיב התם (ישעיהו כז, יג) ביום ההוא יתקע בשופר גדול</p>\n  \n  <p>In Tishrei we will be redeemed - he learns out a Gezeirah Shavah of “Shofar” “Shofar.” It says here [by Rosh HaShanah] “blow the Shofar in the month,” and it says there [regarding Mashiach], “and it will be on that day a great Shofar blast will be blown.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Compare Sanhedrin 98a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי אלכסנדרי רבי יהושע בן לוי רמי כתיב (ישעיהו ס, כב) בעתה וכתיב אחישנה זכו אחישנה לא זכו בעתה</p>\n  \n  <p>Says R’ Alexandri: R’ Yehoshua Ben Levi poses a contradiction. It says [regarding the coming of Mashiach] “in its time” and it [immediately] says “I will hasten it.” [Is it in its time, or is it hastened to come early?] If they merit, “I will hasten it.” If they don’t merit, [Mashiach will still come] “in its time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Considering this latter Gemara, is the former intended to be understood as a prediction of when he is <em>actually</em> going to come, and R’ Yehoshua Ben Levi refers to the <em>year</em> of Mashiach (or just flat-out argues on R’ Eliezer and R’ Yehoshua), or are R’ Eliezer and R’ Yehoshua predicting Mashiach’s “time,” which R’ Yehoshua Ben Levi says isn’t necessarily when he <em>will</em> come?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Judaism forbid fasting on Fridays and Saturdays? If so, where is this rule written and what is the reasoning behind it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was reading the deuterocanonical Book of Judith, and I came across the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Judith had lived as a widow in her house for three years and four months. \n  She pitched a tent for herself on the roof of her house, put funeral clothing around her waist, and wore widow’s clothing. \n  She fasted all the days of her widowhood except for the day before the Sabbath and the Sabbath itself, the day before the new moon, the day of the new moon, and the feasts and celebration days of the house of Israel. \n  She was very beautiful and lovely to stare at. Her husband Manasseh left her gold and silver, male and female slaves, cattle, and fields, which she continued to oversee. \n  And no one had a bad word to say about her, for she revered God greatly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Being a Christian myself, I found this passage somewhat confusing because we Christians are forbidden to fast on Saturdays and Sundays (see the 66th Apostolic Canon) however we are required to fast on Wednesdays and Fridays (see the 69th Apostolic Canon)</p>\n\n<p>However, I know that in Judaism, fasting is supposed to be done on Mondays and Thursdays, but is there any rule in the Jewish religion that forbids fasting on Fridays and Saturdays? If so, where is this rule written and what is the reasoning behind it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Fasting is forbidden on Shabbat - whether on Friday night or Saturday during the day, due to the mitzvah of \"Oneg Shabbat\"- One is required to enjoy Shabbat. This obligation may be from the Torah, but is definitely present in Isaiah (58:13).\nAnother proof text is Nechemia 8:9-10: when people were weeping due to their sins on Rosh Hashana, Nehemia and the Levites and Priests commanded them to eat and drink \"because this day is holy to Hashem\". Similarly one is forbidden to fast on all holy days including Shabbat (aside from Yom Kippur, when fasting is explicitly commanded). </p>\n\n<p>Fasting is permitted by the Shulchan Aruch (288) if one is accustomed to fasting (during the day) every day and will suffer from eating, or if one has experienced a very disturbing dream that requires a fast according one's custom. Nevertheless, in the second case a person is required to do another fast to make up for fasting on Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Fasting on Friday  or Sunday is not a regular thing - voluntary fasts traditionally are not undertaken on Friday because of the holiness of Shabbat and the whiplash one would get by going from pleasure to suffering or back in one day.  Taanit Esther is always pushed back to Thursday if it would fall on Sunday. Sometimes, the fast of 10 Tevet falls on Friday, and this is the only fast that is ever observed on that day by most people (Yom Kippur and Tisha b'av can't fall on Friday in our current calendar).</p>\n\n<p>One thing that is quite confusing is her not fasting on the day before the New Moon. In fact, the day before the New Moon is a common time for fasting in the last few centuries (Yom Kippur Katan, little Yom Kippur). But in her days, presumably she didn't know whether the New Moon had been declared on that day, so she was probably trying to ensure that she didn't fast by mistake on the New Moon.</p>\n\n\n",

The punishment nowadays is therefore left to God (see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.82a.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 82a</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Indeed the next sentence in Shaarei Tshuva is</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our Sages of blessed memory said: From the days the Temple was\n  destroyed, even though the four death penalties of <em>beit din</em> have\n  ceased, the punishment of the four death penalties has not ceased\n  [i.e., the sinner dies in a manner similar to the penalty prescribed\n  for him] [...] one is liable to <em>chenek</em> either drowns in a river or\n  dies in a choking disease.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>ABSOLUTELY NOT</strong>. The bystander is only allowed to use lethal force in halacha to <strong>PREVENT</strong> a murder or a rape; and even then, only if there is no non-lethal option to prevent it.</p>\n\n<p>This is all spelled out quite clearly in Maimonides' Laws of the Murderer and Preservation of Life, Chapter 1:</p>\n\n<p>Deut. 22:26 says we don't blame a married woman who was raped: \"just like if someone was murdered, [you wouldn't blame the victim]; the woman cried out, but no one was there to save her.\" Jewish tradition reads that as saying *but if anyone was there to prevent the rape, there would have been no constraints vis-a-vis Jewish law from doing so\", i.e. a bystander could use force -- up to lethal force, if necessary -- to prevent it. And because the verse is comparing rape to murder, the same applies to <em>preventing</em> a murder. [1:10]</p>\n\n<p>\"Prevention\" means just that -- before a rape or murder has occurred. Witnesses and bystanders are not allowed to kill someone who has just committed a murder; that person needs to be tried by the courts, as Num. 35:12 states <em>the murderer shall not die until he stands before the community for sentencing</em>. The same applies to any capital crime -- no death penalty until tried by court. [1:5] The same applies to rape -- lethal force may only be used to <em>prevent</em> it from occurring in the first place. [1:12] </p>\n\n<p>Lethal force is only authorized if non-lethal force won't do it. If a bystander could cut off the attacker's hand, break his foot, or blind him to prevent the rape/murder, do that instead. [1:7] If the bystander could actually have prevented the rape/murder non-lethally but said \"eh why bother\" and instead kills the attacker, such a bystander is considered a murderer in God's eyes! However the courts would not punish them. [1:13]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>To elaborate mbloch's point, and answer your comments:</p>\n\n<p><strong>#1.</strong> AFAIK, there are only a couple of cases when one is allowed to kill a Jew without being killed himself (by the court):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In the case of a <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rodef</a> (pursuer), one is allowed to kill him without bringing the pursuer to justice.</p></li>\n<li><p>In the case of one who was sentenced to death by the court and got away.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In all other cases, a transgressor(s) must be brought to justice. In other words, if you kill a person that violated any capital sin without a trial, you'll be sentenced to death (<em>Of course, it requires witnesses and all the accepted procedures, but you ARE a murderer</em>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>#2.</strong> Assuming the wife is Jewish, a man has no special rights toward his wife's body, and legally for him, she's just another person, not as his slave. The husband cannot beat her or injure her or force himself upon her or kill her (see below).</p>\n\n<p><strong>#3.</strong> Halachicly-wise <em>it might be</em> permitted to judge and execute a non-Jew</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In your case, if you're interested in killing the person you should provide two independent witnesses that would testify what you saw.

Prices range widely.  Various websites offer a bottom-of-the-line pair of tefillin for $150, $400, or $550, depending on the site. The high-end tefillin can run to well over $1,000. The lower prices are from websites that sell a wide variety of merchandise.  Has anyone bought inexpensive tefillin on the web and had them checked?

Except for the specific cases where we find אפקעינהו רבנן קידושין מיניה, a rabbinic prohibition will not invalidate the Kiddushin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is he a subject to lashes or other Bet Din punishment?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No. This is a <em>takannas hageonim</em>, from after the <em>chasimas hatalmud</em>. </p>\n\n\n",

He explains that Moshe was commanded and showed all the pratim of teffilin ,but they would only wear them after the death of Moshe Rabbeinu. He also explains the machlokes happened due to the 3000 halachos that were forgotten during the mourning of Moshe Rabbeinu.

The Torah calls\n  them Totafot, which is a combination of two foreign words, each\n  meaning \"two.\" </p>\n  \n  <p>Why did the Torah teach us to make four sections by\n  adding two and two? Why didn't the Torah just use a word meaning\n  \"four?\" Harav David Cohen (Cong. Gevul Ya'avetz, of Brooklyn, N.Y.,\n  author of Ohel David, 4 vol., Aidi d'Zutar, 2 vol., etc.) suggests an\n  original approach to this question.</p>\n  \n  <p>This week's Parasha tells us that the Jews were commanded in Egypt to\n  place two passages from the Torah \"as signs on our arms and Tefillin\n  on our foreheads.\" Presumably they did so immediately, making\n  themselves their first pairs of Tefillin. However, doing so would be\n  somewhat problematic, since Tefillin include more than just those two\n  passages. They include two additional passages, \"Shema Yisrael\" and\n  \"v'Haya Im Shamo'a,\" which Moshe only told the Jews 40 years later,\n  when they were about to enter the Land of Israel. We must conclude,\n  continues Rabbi Cohen, that the Jews were only required to put <em>two</em>\n  of the traditional four passages in their Tefillin for the first forty\n  years.</p>\n  \n  <p>This, explains Rabbi Cohen, is why the Torah split the total number of\n  passages into two sets of two. This was meant to show that the\n  original installation of the passages in the Tefillin was done in two\n  stages: the first two of the four were installed upon leaving Egypt,\n  while the other two had to wait until some 40 years later!</p>\n  \n  <p>A reader, Chaim Schild of Spring Valley, N.Y., pointed out that Rav\n  Menachem Kasher discusses the issue of which passages were included in\n  Tefillin during the 40 years of wandering in the desert (Torah\n  Shelemah, Milu'im following Parashat Bo, vol. 12, p. 249). Rav Kasher\n  cites the Kasa d'Harsena (footnotes by the author of Besamim Rosh, #24) who raises the possibility that Tefillin in those days consisted of only 2 passages instead of the requisite 4, but remains in doubt as\n  to whether such a hypothesis is justifiable. The last Lubavitcher\n  Rebbe, Rav Menachem M. Shneerson, also adopts the view that the Jews\n  wore only two passages in their Tefillin while wandering in the desert\n  (Sichah of Va'etchanan 1989, p. 52-53).</p>\n  \n  <p>However, the very early Talmudic authorities (cited by Torah Shelemah\n  as well) actually discuss this issue, and seem to agree that such a\n  proposition is <em>not</em> viable. According to the Manhig (Rav Avraham ben\n  Nasan ha'Yarchi, Mosad Harav Kook 1978, p. 729), the Mitzvah of\n  Tefillin was incumbent upon the Jews only after they entered Holy\n  Land, or, alternatively, only after having received the Torah on Mt.\n  Sinai. In either case, the Manhig emphasizes that by that time all 4\n  passages were already taught to the Jews and worn in their Tefillin.\n  Another early commentator (Chidushei ha'Rashba to Menachot, by Rav\n  Yeshayah mi'Trani) indeed asserts that the Jews wore Tefillin from the\n  moment they left Egypt. However, he too adds that all four passages\n  were already taught to the Jews, and included in their Tefillin, by\n  then. (See also Ha'amek Davar to Devarim 6:4.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, he quotes three general opinions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They did wear Tefillin in the Midbar, but they only contained two passages. (He rejects this opinion.)</li>\n<li>They did not wear Tefillin in the Midbar.</li>\n<li>They did wear Tefillin in the Midbar, perhaps only from Har Sinai, perhaps even from leaving Mitzraim, but they already had all four parshios.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# For the start of the day, is \"sunset\" astronomical or visible?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yesterday was the equinox and I noticed that the day was longer than 12 hours according to the (secular) sunrise/sunset times.  Curious, I did some investigation.  One reason for the difference is how we measure -- the equinox is based on when the <em>center</em> of the sun is visible while sunrise/sunset times are based on when the <em>top edge</em> is visible.  That only accounts for a couple minutes; though; the bigger factor is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">atmospheric refracion</a> (discussed in simpler terms <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/equinox-not-equal.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), which, in a nutshell, means that the sun is visible to us in the sky <em>even when it is below the horizon</em>, for several minutes.</p>\n\n<p>This made me wonder about the effect on <em>halachic</em> times.  <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3240769/jewish/Why-Are-Shabbat-Candles-Lit-18-Minutes-Before-Sunset.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> says that the <em>halacha</em> is that Shabbat begins at sunset, though we add time for safety.  I know that, <em>l'hatchila</em>, we add (usually) 18 minutes before the start of Shabbat or Yom Tov to provide a cushion.  That's more than enough to account for any false effects due to refraction, but I've also been told that, <em>b'dieved</em>, if one is running late and has to cut into those 18 minutes, it's still ok so long as you actually began Shabbat/Yom Tov before the end of those 18 minutes, at sunset.  And therein lies my question.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of how we <em>halachically</em> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/47449/472\">define sunset</a>, we might see the sun above the horizon and conclude that it is not yet sunset <em>when the sun has actually already set</em>.  Does this mean that the day has in fact started -- we go by where the sun is, not where it appears to be -- and if you light at the 15th of the 18 minutes you're kindling fire on Shabbat?  Or, <em>halachically</em>, is sunset based on what we <em>see</em>, not what we now know happens scientifically?</p>\n\n<p>I know there's discussion (somewhere) of Shabbat times if you're in the mountains or have an obstructed view of the horizon, and maybe that's relevant here.  That's a more localized situation, while atmospheric refraction happens everywhere all the time, so I don't know if that makes it a different case.</p>\n\n<p>Does Shabbat really start sometime during the 18 minutes?</p>\n\n\n",

Yechiel Michel Epstein</a>. He begins by saying that the exemption of <em>mitztaer</em> (one who is suffering discomfort) only applies to a discomfort that happens to occur after the <em>succah</em> was built. But it is forbidden to build your <em>succah</em> in the first place in a situation that you know will cause discomfort (e.g. wind, odor, insects). He then quotes the statement of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moses Isserles</a> that such a <em>succah</em> (i.e. one built in a situation where you know there will be discomfort) does not even have the status of a <em>succah</em> at all (i.e. even if you do end up using it there's no fulfillment of the <em>mitzvah</em>). This is a function of the rule of <em>teishvu k'ein taduru</em> – you have to live in the <em>succah</em> as you would normally live.</p>\n\n<p>R. Epstein then raises the following question: in many situations it is simply impossible to sleep in the <em>succah</em>. In hot countries insects abound, and in cold countries it is too cold. Accordingly, there should be no such thing as a real <em>succah</em> in these places, and no one there has ever fulfilled the <em>mitzvah</em> (even if they did somehow end up using the <em>succah</em>).</p>\n\n<p>R. Epstein resolves this difficulty with the following explanation: As mentioned, this whole rule is a function of <em>teishvu k'ein taduru</em>. What this tells us is that in a situation where you have a choice between building a <em>succah</em> in a way that would not cause discomfort and building it in a way that would cause <em>discomfort</em> you can't build it in the way that would cause discomfort. This is because if you were building a permanent residence you wouldn't build it in a way that causes discomfort. However, if there is no way at all to build a <em>succah</em> in a way that does not cause discomfort (like for example, as mentioned, if the country is simply too cold) you can still build a valid <em>succah</em> because it is not a violation of <em>teishvu k'ein taduru</em> since even if you were building a permanent residence you would have no choice but to build it despite the discomfort.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thus, in sum, one cannot build a <em>succah</em> in a way that he knows will result in him suffering, unless there is no way to build a <em>succah</em> that will not result in him suffering.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9102&st=&pgnum=382\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan O.C. 640:8-9</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודווקא שבא לו הצער במקרה אחר שעשה הסוכה ובשעה שעשה שם הסוכה לא היה צער\n  זה אבל אסור לעשות סוכתו לכתחלה במקום ששם יגיע לו צער מפני הרוח או הריח\n  או במקום זבובים ופרעושים ויותר מזה כתב רבינו הרמ\"א בסעיף ד' דעושה\n  במקום כזה אינה סוכה כלל ואינו יוצא בה ידי חובתו וזה לשונו ואם עשאה\n  מתחלה במקום שמצטער באכילה או בשתייה או בשינה או שאי אפשר לו לעשות אחד\n  מהם בסוכה מחמת שמתיירא מלסטים או מגנבים כשהוא בסוכה אינו יוצא באותה\n  סוכה כלל אפילו בדברים שלא מצטער בהם דלא הוי כעין דירה שיכול לעשות שם\n  כל צרכיו עכ\"ל</p>\n  \n  <p>ודבריו צריכין ביאור דא\"כ במדינות החמות שמצויים שם זבובים בכל מקום\n  ולהיפך במדינות הקרות שהקור גדול וכמעט מהנמנעות לישן שם נפטור את עצמינו\n  לגמרי מן הסוכה אך העניין כן הוא דהתורה אמרה תשבו כעין תדורו שתהיה\n  הסוכה כביתו ודירתו ודבר ידוע שהאדם שעושה לו דירה יחפש אחר המקום היותר\n  הגון ואם יהיה מקום הגון ומקום שאינו הגון יבחר במקום ההגון אבל אם כל\n  המקומות אינם הגונים בהכרח לעשות לו דירה איך שהוא וכמו כן בסוכה אם כל\n  המקומות אינם הגונים מפני החום או מפני הקור פשיטא שמחוייב לעשות סוכה\n  איך שיכול אמנם כשבידו לברור כגון שבמקום זה שולט הרוח או הריח רע או\n  זבובים ופרעושים ובמקום אחר אינם נמצאים מחוייב לעשות במקום שאין נמצאים\n  ואם עשה במקום שנמצאים לא יצא ידי חובתו דאין זה כעין תדורו ולכן אין\n  לעשות סוכה ברשות הרבים דאין אדם עושה דירתו ברשות הרבים אמנם בסימטא\n  נראה דמותר דאע\"פ שיש לחוש לגנבים שיגנובו החפצים מ\"מ הוי דירה שיכול\n  להכניסן לבית והרי גם בחצרות מצויים גנבים וזה שכתב רבינו הרמ\"א דבמקום\n  דמתיירא מלסטים או מגנבים לא יצא ידי חובתו זהו כשיש חשש שיפגועו בגופו\n  דמקום כזה וודאי אינו ראוי לישן כלל אבל לא מפני גניבת חפצים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rema in Orach Chaim 640:4 rules that if one builds a sukkah in a place where one will be unable to use it for eating, drinking or sleeping (due to discomfort or some other reason) he cannot fulfill the mitzvah in such a sukkah (even for something that he is able to use his sukkah comfortably).</p>\n\n\n",

I have heard two explanations for this custom:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We avoid placing the fingertips directly on the kiddush cup because impurities in the hand are actually transmitted through the fingertips, and we want to avoid contaminating the cup and/or wine</li>\n<li>There is a Kabbalistic custom whereby the palm (Hebrew: yod) and five fingers (Hebrew: hey/5) form the first two letters of the Tetragrammaton; holding the cup in this way sanctifies G-d</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Can someone explain what the origin for either/both of these customs are?  I have heard it said that kiddush in some way commemorates the Temple service.

Though the distance of the fingertips isn't mentioned explicitly, <em>Mishna B'rura</em>, <em>Magen Avraham</em> and others cite the <em>Sh'nei Luchos Hab'ris</em> as a source (in turn citing earlier <em>kabala</em>) for sitting the cup on the palm with fingers erect. The <em>Magen Avraham</em> seems to think it means - or should mean - holding a cup the usual way one holds a cup: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובשל\"ה כתו' בשם המקובלים שיעמיד הכוס על כף ימינו והאצבעות יהיו זקופים סביב הכוס וכ\"מ בזוהר בראשי' ומ\"מ אינו מוכח כ\"כ די\"ל דיקיפם באצבעותיו כדרך אחיזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(In that case the practice as described would either be a mistake, or of unrelated origin.)</p>\n\n<p>It could also be an undocumented interpretation of the requirement of \"<em>itur</em>\" (=\"coronation\") for <em>kidush</em> that is listed among 9 others in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.51a.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B'rachos</em> 51</a>. A couple practices are recorded there for how individuals would accomplish the enigmatic \"crowning\" requirement, but this finger placement could be another way to do it, as some contend (e.g. <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/10-05-14/#ref_4_5_22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>P'ninei Halacha</em></a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have a book at home that discusses specifically customs of Shabbat. In it I recall reading that this is a reference to the wine steward's (the one that Pharaoh jailed and for whom Joseph interpreted his dream) who said, \"I squeezed the grapes into the cup and I placed the cup on Pharaoh's palm.\"</p>\n\n<p>B\"N, when I locate the book, I will edit in its name.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the reason for Ushpizin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a common custom to invite an important Biblical personage each night in the Sukkah (my custom is chronological - Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, Yosef, Moshe, Aharon, David - but <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/3013/9682\">some customs</a> arrange them in the order of the Sefiros, placing Yosef after Aharon instead). </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/92884/9682\">earliest source</a> has already been discussed here. My question is the reason. Why do we invite these specific guests into the Sukkah? I guess based on the alternate minhag I cited above that there’s a connection with their respective Sefiros, but that just pushes off the question - what is the connection between the Sefiros and Sukkos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From the Chabad.org page on <em>Ushpizin</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If guests are integral to festival joy, they are even more so to Sukkot. Sukkot is the festival of Jewish unity; in fact, the Talmud\n  states that “it is fitting that all Jews should sit in one sukkah.”2\n  If this is logistically difficult to arrange, it should, at the very\n  least, be implemented in principle. We cram as many guests as possible\n  into our sukkah, demonstrating that we fully intend to implement the\n  Jewish communal sukkah to the full extent of our ability, each in our\n  own domain. There is even a story told about a certain chassidic\n  master who, because he lacked a guest, the Patriarch Abraham refused\n  to enter his sukkah (why Abraham was there—more on that later).</p>\n  \n  <p>The Kabbalah of the Ushpizin</p>\n  \n  <p>And so we come to the ushpizin. As we fill our sukkah with earthly\n  guests, we merit to host seven supernal guests. While all seven\n  ushpizin visit our sukkah on each of the seven nights and days of\n  Sukkot,3 each supernal “guest” is specifically associated with one of\n  the festival’s seven days, and is the “leading” or dominant ushpiza\n  for that night and day.4</p>\n  \n  <p>The Kabbalists Translated into English, the word loses some of its\n  mystery and otherworldlinessteach that these seven leaders—referred to\n  in our tradition as the “seven shepherds of Israel”—correspond to the\n  seven sefirot, or divine attributes, which categorize G‑d’s\n  relationship with our reality, and which are mirrored in the seven\n  basic components of our character (man having been created “in the\n  image of G‑d”).</p>\n  \n  <p>As each supernal “guest” graces our sukkah, he empowers us with the\n  particular quality that defines him. This is the deeper reason that\n  they are called the “shepherds of Israel,” for like a shepherd who\n  provides nourishment for his flock, these seven leaders nourish us\n  their spiritual essence: Abraham feeds us love; Isaac,\n  self-discipline; Jacob, harmony and truth; and so on.</p>\n  \n  <p>And while these seven great souls are our “shepherds” all year round,\n  the seven days of Sukkot are a time when their presence in our lives\n  is more pronounced and revealed. As we enter the “temporary dwelling”\n  of the sukkah, freeing ourselves from the dependence we developed on\n  the material comforts of home and hearth, we are now in a place in\n  which our spiritual self is more revealed and accessible. In this\n  place the ushpizin visit us, empowering us to connect the seven\n  dimensions of our own soul’s “divine image” with its supernal source\n  in the divine sefirot, feeding, nourishing and fortifying our\n  spiritual self for the material year to come.</p>\n  \n  <p>The seven sefirot, or divine energies, we are fed by the ushpizin are:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uyGzg.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uyGzg.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question is comprised of two parts, 1) Why do we invite these specific guests? and 2) What is the connection between Sefirot and Sukkot?</p>\n\n<p>The first part of your question relates to an overriding, general theme of Sukkot. That theme is the (essential and critical) unity of all of the Jewish people. That each and every individual is needed and is part of the perfect whole.</p>\n\n<p>And that idea also relates to the special guests (Ushpizin) who visit every Sukkah. All of the guests come each night with the group being led by the select individual for that particular night.</p>\n\n<p>Each of the guests relates and is connected to every Jew. Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov are the Avot (אבות, אב). They are the precursors to, source and ancestors to the entire Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>Yaacov Avinu introduces an additional concept of being the <em>Nasi</em> (נשיא) of the entire Jewish people. The Nasi (literally <em>Prince</em>) is like a precursor to being a King. The word, <em>Nasi</em>, is actually a <em>Roshei Teivot</em> for נ״צוץ ש״ל י״עקב א״בינו. The idea that that the Nasi is compared to the entire generation follows the explanation from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.21.21?lang=bi&aliyot=1&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.21.21.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Bamidbar 21:21</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Yosef HaTzaddik was the leader of the entire jewish people in Egypt and second to the King of Egypt, Pharoah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.44.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 44:18</a>). This was the subject of his dream that was recounted in the Torah to his brothers and his father. That they would all bow down to him and acknowledge his ultimate authority over them.</p>\n\n<p>This same principle continues with Moshe Rabbeinu who was the leader of the entire Jewish people and the one who transmitted the entire Torah to all of the Jewish people at Har Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, his brother, Aharon, represented the entire Jewish people as the Kohen Gadol in the Mishkan as they traveled through the wilderness. The names of each of the Tribes are before him as a constant reminder on his Priestly garments. And in fact Moshe and Aharon are compared to each other and are of equal value. They served as the vehicle through which the Jewish people traveled from Egypt to the land of Israel serving like a pair of legs.</p>\n\n<p>And finally, there is David, the paradigm in the Torah for the Jewish King. Like with the others, the King is associated with very single Jew, like Rambam points out in the Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Melachim, that the King is the <em>Heart of the entire nation</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The second part of your question is trying to understand what the relationship of the Sefirot are to Sukkot, and for that matter, to the guests themselves. What follows is based upon a series of Chassidic discourses from the 2nd Lubavitcher Rebbe (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovber_Schneuri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Mitteler Rebbe, Rabbi Dovber ben Schneur Zalman</a>) dealing with <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15905&st=&pgnum=267\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh HaShanah</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15905&st=&pgnum=361\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yom Kippur</a> and Sukkot. The first begins with the words, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15923&st=&pgnum=69\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"להבין שרש ענין חג הסוכות\"</a>. The 2nd begins with the words, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15923&st=&pgnum=91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"יצחק בא מבוא באר לחי רואי כו׳\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Sukkot is a continuation of and a revelation within the world (עולם) of what was begun on Rosh HaShanah (Crowning G-d King) and Yom Kippur (Sealing the decree of the King when the smoke from the incense offered by Aharon in the Holy of Holies fills the space and creates a cloud on the ceiling like the Skach in the Sukkah). That incense must contain all of its ingredients or one is culpable even to death.</p>\n\n<p>Like with any aspect of the universe, it all follows the organizational structure set up by G-d (מערכת אלקות).</p>\n\n<p>This is part of our intention when we recite the 2nd sentence of Shema, \"<em>Baruch Shem Kavod Malchuto l'Olam Va'Ed.</em>\" That \"Baruch Shem Kavod Malchuto\" pertains to the intellect, the four <em>Brains</em>. Intellect is only for oneself. It is concealed from <em>others</em>. L'Olam (לעולם literally <em>to the world</em>) corresponds to the Middot, the emotional attributes.  It is the beginning of transmitting that private intellect to another. And finally, Va'Ed (ועד) corresponds to physical, material expression of the King's decree through action, Malchut, like building the Sukkah with Skach and dwelling in it and taking up the 4 species (Lulav, etc.). In fact, (ועד) has a value of 80 (פ, mouth) which all alludes to the Oral Torah which is the explanation of how to perform the commandments (the decrees of the King).</p>\n\n<p>The part of that organizational structure which pertains to the aspect of <em>World</em> (עולם) and physical, material existence is the Sefirot which are associated with the <em>Middot</em> (Emotional traits), Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malchut (Action on a physical plane).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the appearance of each of the guests follows that same organizational system. Avraham with Chesed, Yitzchok with Gevurah, Yaacov with Tiferet, Moshe with Netzach, Aharon with Hod, Yosef with Yesod and David with Malchut.</p>\n\n<p>The variation in order of Yosef, coming after Yaacov or coming after Aharon relates to whether one is considering the beginning or ending of that revelation.</p>\n\n<p>To understand, consider the physical form of the human body which is also compared to the Sefirot (See the teaching from Eliyahu HaNavi found in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32581&st=&pgnum=125\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Patach Eliyahu prayer</a> said on Erev Shabbat.). Yesod, (pertaining to Yosef) is called <em>Siyumah d'Gufah</em>, the conclusion and purpose of the body (תכלית), meaning reproduction, to make new life. It is also the limb of the body that actually makes the unifying connection to another at the moment of conception (to be one flesh).</p>\n\n<p>And yet, the legs, which correspond to the Sefirot of Netzach (Moshe) and Hod (Aharon), extend down below the reproductive organ, (meaning they come after) Yesod (Yosef). They give one the greater ability to interact with, to travel, and to walk within the physical, material world.</p>\n\n<p>So from one perspective (chronologically), Yosef, meaning Yesod, comes before Moshe and Aharon. And from another perspective (Tachlit, ultimate purpose) he follows them because he is their ultimate point, fulfilling G-d's will, revealing G-d's kingship (Malchut, David) in the physical, material world and choosing life. This dimension is also alluded to in the Torah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.44.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 44:18</a>) through the story of Yehudah, the tribal precursor to David, approaching Yosef in Egypt and the repetition of the concept as found in the Haftorah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.37.15-17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 37:15-28</a>) which is discussing the final redemption through Moshiach (ben Yosef and ben David).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>So as far as your first question about why we invite the Ushpizin on Succos I saw a p'shat from HaRav Elimelech Biederman shlita this year.</p>\n<p>He wanted to say based on the Vilna Gaon zt'l in (אזור אליהו - סוכות) that all the seven\nUshpizen went to galus. Therefore, it's fitting that they visit us on Succos when we go into galus.</p>\n\n\n",

Yaskil Avdi, part 2 Orach Chaim 3; Yabia Omer, part 6, Orach Chaim 11; and Responsa Mishpitei Uziel (Orach Chaim:1).</p>\n<p>However none of these responsa allow for one to create a new amalgamated Hebrew pronunciation that takes from different traditions. Therefore if one is concerned about making sure one pronounces in a way that follows all the rules brought down in the halakhot he should choose a pronunciation that follows all those rules. For example one is required if possible to distinguish between Alef and Ayin, Chet and Khaf, and Qof and Kaf. The distinguishing of the consonants is very important to the earliest sources on this issue. Of secondary importance is vowels, and the soft letters of of the BeGeD KeFet letters.</p>\n<p>Every pronunciation of the Yemenite community satisfies the halakhic requirements, but there are differences in pronunciation especially when it comes to ג and ק.</p>\n<p>The Iraqi tradition also satisfies this if one can learn from someone who has not lost the proper way of speaking.</p>\n<p>Some Kurdish/Assyrian pronunciations also satisfy the halakhic requirements, and I learned this method.</p>\n\n\n",

Made in the likeness of a human body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So he is explaining why she put it there. The Terafim were a decoy to mislead Shaul's men. Rashi doesn't indicate this human figure's purpose.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_I_Samuel.19.13.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> writes similarly, and addreses their purpose:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וענין התרפים יש מפרשים כי הם עבודת גילולים כמו התרפים אשר ללבן שגנבתם רחל ולבן עובד עבודת גילולים היה כמו שאמר לה למה גנבת את אלהי <strong>וחלילה חלילה שהיה בבית דוד עבודת גילולים</strong> ויש אומרים שהוא כלי הנחשת העשוי לדעת חלקי השעות ויראו בהם העתידות במשפט המזלות וזה יתכן בדבר לבן אבל בדבר מיכל הוא קשה לפרש למה שמה אותם במטה מקום דוד ואותו הכלי אינו בתכונה הזאת והחכם ראב\"ע זכרו לברכה כתב כי התרפים הם על צורת בן אדם והיא עשויה לקבל כח עליונים והעד שהתרפים כן התרפים ששמה מיכל במטה עד שחשבו שומרי הבית שהם דוד: </p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding the Terafim, some say they are idols, like the Terafim of Lavan which Rochel stole, and Lavan was an idol worshiper, like he said: \"Why did you steal my gods?\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.31.30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 31:30</a>). However, <strong>heaven forbid that there should be idols in the house of Dovid</strong>. Some instead say that Terafim are a bronze vessel used to tell time and to know the future using astrology. This makes sense for Lavan, but for Michal why would she place them in Dovid's bed? This vessel shouldn't be in the shape [of a man]. The Sage Ibn Ezra of blessed memory <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.31.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> that the Terafim are in the shape of a man, and are used to receive the strength of the upper [forces]. The proof for this is the palace guards thought it was Dovid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there seems to be a dispute about the purpose and nature of the Terafim. JPS for whatever reason chose to translate it as idols, but <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.19.13?ven=The_Metsudah_Tanach_series,_Lakewood,_N.J&with=all&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">other translations</a>, due to the obvious question involved, chose the other explanations. It would appear the explanation of predicting the future or \"receiving the strength of the upper [forces]\" isn't a halachic problem for the Radak, although I'm not sure why.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting to note that some explain the Terafim as a mixture of the different explanations: an idol in the shape of a human. Or, more accurately, the head of a human. See <a href=\"http://alex-klein.co.il/%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9D/#_ftnref3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.

I go through the sources here; if you don’t want to see all of them, scroll all the way to the bottom for a summary.</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The Sometimes-Idol</h2>\n\n<p>Metzudas Tzion to our passuk in Shmuel is of the opinion that Teraphim weren’t always made to be idols:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הם העשויים בצורת אדם, מהם לעבודה זרה, ומהם לצורת אדם ידוע, והנשים היו עושות על צורת בעליהן, להסתכל בתארו מרוב האהבה: </p>\n  \n  <p>They were made in the figure of a man, some for idol worship, and some in the image of a specific person. The women would make them in the image of their husbands, to look at his form from an abundance of love. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be Rashi’s understanding as well, as he translates the word in Shmuel as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עשוים בדמות גוף אדם</p>\n  \n  <p>made in the likeness of a human body</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>in spite of translating it as an idol in Bereishis, where he explains that Rachel stole her father’s teraphim because</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>להפריש את אביה מעבודה זרה נתכוונה</p>\n  \n  <p>she intended to separate her father from idolatry. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The Something Something Something</h2>\n\n<p>The Radak to Shmuel quotes the understanding that they are idols, but then, on the grounds that c”v David HaMelech would have an idol in his house, gives a second explanation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויש אומרים שהוא כלי הנחשת העשוי לדעת חלקי השעות ויראו בהם העתידות במשפט המזלות</p>\n  \n  <p>Some say that they are copper vessels made to know the division of the hours, and to see with them the future through astrology. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea seems to be that one could use the device to see the night sky on a future date, and, seeing where the stars land, can predict the future much farther in advance than one would normally. </p>\n\n<p>I find it interesting that the problem the Radak has with this interpretation is not that the original problem - how could David have an idol?! - still stands - how could David try to predict the future when that’s also forbidden?! - but rather, his problem is that such a device doesn’t belong in a bed, so why was Michal putting it there?</p>\n\n<p>Therefore he turns to the Ibn Ezra’s approach. While the Radak had no problem with the Teraphim being an astrological clock in the context of Lavan, the Ibn Ezra wasn’t willing to say that. While he doesn’t really explain his problem, he doesn’t really explain his solution, either:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והקרוב אלי שהתרפי' הם על צורת בני אדם והיא עשויה לקבל כח עליונים ולא אוכל לפרש.</p>\n  \n  <p>It seems closer to me that the Teraphim were [formed] according to the figure of a person, and it was made to accept the power of the Heavens. I am unable to explain. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, isn’t that convenient (sarcasm intended). Nevertheless, he does prove his assertion - at least, that it’s in the form of a person - from the fact that Michal stuck it in the bed. </p>\n\n<p>At the very end of his piece he rejects Rashi’s opinion that she took them to stop her father from serving idols, on the grounds that she would have buried  them rather than take them with her. Therefore he explains the passuk by Lavan in the above vein:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והקרוב שהיה לבן אביה יודע מזלות ופחדה שאביה יסתכל במזלות לדעת אי זה דרך ברחו</p>\n  \n  <p>The closer [approach] is that her father Lavan knew astrology, and she was afraid that her father would gaze at the stars to know on which road they fled. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At first glance I read this piece as a printer’s error, and it should be earlier on, when the Ibn Ezra is still entertaining the idea that it’s an astrological clock. But perhaps the Ibn Ezra understands that Lavan knew how to “tap into” the heavenly influence on his Teraphim for them to guide him. I’m not exactly sure. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Satan Himself</h2>\n\n<p>Pirkei d’Rebbi Eliezer 36:14 brings down a, um, creepier understanding of the Teraphim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה הם התרפים, שוחטין אדם בכור ומולקין את ראשו ומולחין אותו במלח ובשמן טוב וכותבין על טס זהב שם רוח טומאה ומניחין אותו בכר ומדליקין נרות לפניו ומשתחוין לו והוא מדבר עמהן.</p>\n  \n  <p>What were the Teraphim? They would slaughter a firstborn human, cut his head off, and salt him with salt and good oil, and they would write the name of a spirit of tumah on a golden placard. They would place him on a mattress, light candles before him, and prostrate to him, and he would speak with them. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Midrash also appears in Tanchuma Vayeitzei 12. </p>\n\n<p>This is a disturbing Midrash, but it also leaves the question of what Michal was doing with one. After all, in this version, the Teraphim are actual human beings killed for literal demonic purposes - not a figurine that someone made. Plus, Rachel’s not schlepping a dead body, nor could Yaakov not know that she was after three days. The Midrash doesn’t leave us any hints, but Targum Yonasan does. He quotes the Midrash with a very important addition:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּגְנֵיבַת רָחֵל יַת צַלְמָנַיָא דַהֲווֹן נַכְסִין גַבְרָא בּוּכְרָא וְחִזְמִין רֵישֵׁיהּ וּמַלְחִין לֵיהּ בְּמִילְחָא וּבוּסְמָנִין וְכָתְבִין קוּסְמִין בְּצִיצָא דְדַהֲבָא וִיהָבִין תְּחוֹת לִשְׁנֵיהּ וּמְקַיְמִין לֵיהּ בְּכוּתְלָא וּמְמַלֵיל עִמְהוֹן וְאִילֵין הֲווֹן דַהֲוָה גָחִין לְהוֹן אָבוּהָא</p>\n  \n  <p>And Rachel stole his figurines. For they would slay a firstborn man, cut off his head, salt him with salt and spices, write an incantation on a golden head-plate which they put under his tongue, and they stood him against the wall, and he would speak to them. It was to this that her father bowed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a few minor differences, like what it was they put on the piece of gold, but I’d like to highlight that according to Targum Yonasan, there were the Teraphim themselves, and there were the bodies used. It was the former which Rachel stole, and which Michal had. In this version, it’s not dissimilar from the Metzudas Tzion’s and Rashi’s understanding, except that they discuss idolatry whereas this Midrash discusses divination. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Defending the Astrological Clock</h2>\n\n<p>The Ramban attacks Rashi. Unlike my earlier reading of Rashi, Ramban sees him as claiming that all Teraphim are idols. Being left with the problem that David couldn’t have idols in his house, he poses the earlier theory of the astrological clock, and defends it. Because of its length, I will not translate the whole piece here; suffice it to say that he demonstrates this both etymologically and from context literally anywhere the word appears. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והמלה נגזרת מלשון רפה ידים (שם ב יז ב) נרפים אתם נרפים (שמות ה יז) יקראו אותם \"תרפים\" לרמוז בשמם כי דבורם כמו נבואה רפה תבא ברב ותכזב לעתים רחוקות כמו שאמרו (זכריה י ב) כי התרפים דברו און והנה יעשו אותם קטני אמנה להם לאלהים לא ישאלו בשם הנכבד ולא יתפללו אליו רק כל מעשיהם בקסמים אשר יגידו להם התרפים וכתוב (שופטים יז ה) והאיש מיכה לו בית אלהים ויעש אפוד ותרפים ושם כתוב (יח ה) שאל נא באלהים ונדעה התצליח דרכינו כי בתרפים היו שואלים וכן היה הענין בישראל באפוד כי אחרי אשר הורגלו באפוד הקדש עשו כדמותו והיו שואלים בו ומאמינים בדבריו ותועים אחריו גם בחלים לא ידרשו את ה' כי אם בהם וזה טעם ויעש אותו גדעון לאפוד ויצג אותו בעירו בעפרה ויזנו כל ישראל אחריו שם ויהי לגדעון ולביתו למוקש (שופטים ח כז) כי סרו מאחרי ה' והנה לבן היה קוסם ומנחש כאשר אמר (לעיל ל כז) נחשתי וארצו ארץ קוסמים מעולם כדכתיב (ישעיהו ב ו) כי מלאו מקדם ועוננים כפלשתים ובלעם בן בעור הקוסם היה מעירו וזה טעם למה גנבת את אלהי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Malbim says similarly that the Teraphim could divine things. It’s not clear which of the previous opinions regarding divination he holds of. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולבן. [...] ורחל גנבה את התרפים, שלא ינחש ע\"י התרפים הדרך שהלך שם יעקב</p>\n  \n  <p>“And Lavan” - [...] And Rachel stoke the Teraphim, so that he not divine through the Teraphim which way Yaakov went. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve got quite a few opinions here, so let me try to summarize them. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Metzudas Tzion, and possibly Rashi, learn that some Teraphim were used as idols, and some were used just as figurines. </li>\n<li>The Radak and Ibn Ezra learn that Teraphim somehow channel Divine influence something something. It’s possible that this is the same as #3, maybe not. </li>\n<li>Pirkei d’Rebbi Eliezer, as explained by Targum Yonasan, learns that by performing a Satanic ritual before the Teraphim, they would literally speak the future. It seems that, similar to #1, not all Teraphim were used for this purpose. </li>\n<li>The Ramban learns that they were some kind of astrological clock, by which one could predict the future by reading the stars even before they’ve risen. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It’s not clear to me which opinion the Malbim subscribes to, except that he clearly does not agree with #1. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Are They Even Arguing?</h2>\n\n<p>Just to confuse things further, here’s from Eichah Rabbah, Pesichah §23. In context, a Bas Kol had been telling Nevuchadnetzar to go destroy the Beis HaMikdash, and for 12 years he wouldn’t. Eventually he decided to divine if he should listen or not. One of the methods he tried was that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאל בתרפים בעבודת כוכבים שלו</p>\n  \n  <p>he asked his Teraphim, his idols. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps none of these sources are arguing in principle. Maybe everyone agrees that the Teraphim are sometimes random statues and sometimes idols, and they simply argue in how and why they were served - Were they just idols? Did they predict the future? How?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are castrated animals slaughtered as Kosher beef?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Castration and dehorning of cattle is the common practice in the cattle industry. This a violation a basic Noahide Law ref Tractate Sanhedrin 56a-b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שבע מצות נצטוו בני נח ...רבי חידקא אומר אף על הסירוס</p>\n<p>Seven commandments were given to the sons of Noah... Rabbi Chidka said they were also commanded not to castrate animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All men today that are Bnei Noah are required to follow this command. I refuse to castrate and dehorn my cattle and get a big reduction in sale price for them at the local sale barns. Most of all male slaughtered animals in the US have been castrated, dehorned if not polled by mixed breeding and then fattened on Kilayim-(mingled seed) (GMO) feeds with herbicide residues. Why are these animals slaughtered as kosher beef?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><strong>Castration</strong> of an animal is forbidden to Gentiles (according to most opinions) so a Jew cannot tell him to do so. If he does he is forbidden to eat that animal. But if the gentile has already castrated the animal it is permitted for a Jew to eat that animal.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (Rabbinic Authority) Even Haezer 5,14 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסור לומר לכותי לסרס בהמה שלנו. ואם לקחה הוא מעצמו וסרסה, מותר. ואם הערים ישראל בדבר זה, קונסין אותו<br>\n  It is forbidden to tell a Gentile to castrate an animal, but if the Gentile castrated it himself without consent form any Jew it is fully permitted to have benefit from. But <strong>if the Jew told the Gentile to castrate the Animal for him he cannot benefit from the animal as a penalty.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Chelkas Mechokek (Rabbinic authority) elaborates:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישראל אחר מותר לאכול אף על גב שהוא בכלל תעבתי לך מ\"מ מדאסור לגבוה ש\"מ להדיוט שרי מרדכי פ' ש\"ש וישראל שסירס או שסירס העכו\"ם בשבילו משמע דאסור לאכול ממנו<br>\n  We only punish him since <em>he</em> told the Gentile to castrate the Animal or castrated it himself he cannot eat it, but <strong>we don't punish other Jews that were not involved in telling the gentile to castrate the Animal i.e <em>they</em> can eat those castrated animals</strong> as long as it was Slaughtered properly. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>Kilayim</em></strong>: A Gentile is not commanded regading cross breed of seeds .<br>\nRather a Gentile is only commanded regarding crossbreeding trees for fruit, and cross breeding animals species. Rambam Melachim 10,6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִפִּי הַקַּבָּלָה שֶׁבְּנֵי נֹחַ אֲסוּרִין בְּהַרְבָּעַת בְּהֵמָה וּבְהַרְכָּבַת אִילָן בִּלְבַד<br>\n  A Noachide is commanded not to crossbreed animals and trees</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So since a gentile <em>can</em> make genetically modified seeds and feed his animals, those animals are fully permitted for a Jew to buy as no transgression has happened.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rain on Sukkos a bad sign outside the land of Israel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishnah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Taanit.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 1:1</a>) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...אֵין הַגְּשָׁמִים אֶלָּא סִימַן קְלָלָה בֶּחָג‏</p>\n  \n  <p>...the descent of rain on the festival of tabernacles is to be considered an unpropitious event</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mishnah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sukkah.2.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 2:9</a>) also says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יָרְדוּ גְשָׁמִים...לְמָה הַדָּבָר דּוֹמֶה, לְעֶבֶד שֶׁבָּא לִמְזוֹג כּוֹס לְרַבּוֹ, וְשָׁפַךְ לוֹ קִיתוֹן עַל פָּנָיו: </p>\n  \n  <p>If rains fell...To what can this matter be compared? To a slave who came to pour a goblet for his master, and he [the master] poured a bowl-full [of water] in his face.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that it raining on Sukkos is to be viewed as a negative thing. I have this idea in my head that at least the first Mishnah is specifically referring to the land of Israel, which shouldn't expect rain until after Sukkos (I later found that the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%99%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishmeres Shalom</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8944&st=&pgnum=121\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">43:1</a>) says this). Other lands rain all the time with no expectation for it not to on Sukkos. The second Mishnah, presumably is a general statement about if Hashem wants our mitzvah performance, and could potentially refer to all lands (even if the first one doesn't).</p>\n\n<p>However, I saw the Aruch HaShulchan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aruch_HaShulchan.1.639.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 639:20</a>) write:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם כשיוצא מן הסוכה מפני הגשמים – אל יצא ככועס ומבעט, אלא בהכנעה רבה, כעבד שבא למזוג לו כוס לרבו, ורוצה למזוג היין במים, ושפך לו רבו הקיתון של מים על פניו.(והמקור חיים פירש בזה דהמים ממתקין היין האדום, והוא רמז לרחמים הממתק את הדין, ואין מניחין מן השמים. ואמרו שזהו על ארץ ישראל.)</p>\n  \n  <p>However, when you leave your Sukkah because of rain, don't leave angry and kicking. Rather, leave with great submissiveness, like a servant who goes to pour a drink for his master, or dilute his wine with water, and the matter splatters it on his face. (But the Mekor Chaim explains that the water perfects the red wine, hinting to compassion perfecting judgement, and they in Heaven don't let him. And they said this was about the land of Israel.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fact that the Aruch HaShulchan is bringing this Mishnah, even though he lived in exile, shows me he understood it to be referring to all lands. However, maybe again the first Mishnah is only the land of Israel. Does anyone say it's a simman klala/a bad omen outside the land of Israel if it rains on Sukkos? Is this what he means in his last line (it's unclear to me)?</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yehudah validates it. And one which is not ten hand-breadths tall, or does not contain three walls, or whose [area of] sun is greater than its shade <strong>is invalid</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rebbe could easily formulate it in a positive way [my proposition]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>איזוהי סוכה כשרה? כל שהיא גבוהה עשרה טפחים ולא יותר על 20 אמה.<br />\nשיש לה ג' דפנות וצילתה מרובה בחמתה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What Succah would be Kosher? One that's higher than a meter and up to 10 meters, has 3 walls and has more shadow than straight sunlight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Please note, that my version is not lengthier and covers exactly the same amount of information.</em></p>\n<p>This negative approach is very common with the Mishnah, for example, \"לוּלָב הַגָּזוּל וְהַיָּבֵשׁ, פָּסוּל. שֶׁל אֲשֵׁרָה וְשֶׁל עִיר הַנִּדַּחַת, פָּסוּל. נִקְטַם רֹאשׁוֹ, נִפְרְצוּ עָלָיו, פָּסוּל.\". Sometimes the Mishnah does speak in a positive way (RA\"S 3,2): \"כָּל הַשּׁוֹפָרוֹת כְּשֵׁרִין חוּץ מִשֶּׁל פָּרָה, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוּא קֶרֶן.\"</p>\n<p>Personally, as a father and a Mechanech, I'm a big fan of the Positive Psychology approach to education, namely instead of repeatedly reciting the forbidden activities, I prefer to strengthen the desired behavior.</p>\n<p>Did someone research that specific point - how does the Mishnah benefit from such formulations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Every case is different, look at the first 2 Tosafos' at the beginning of Sukkah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מאי שנא גבי סוכה דתני פסולה ומאי שנא גבי מבוי דתני תקנתא.</strong> והא דלא פריך מאי שנא גבי הדס דתני פסולה ותקנתא דתנן בפרק לולב הגזול (לקמן סוכה דף לב:) או שהיו ענביו מרובין מעליו פסול ואם מיעטן כשר דלא פריך אלא מסוכה ומבוי שדינם שוה לענין גבוה ושינה לשון משנתו ועוד דגבי הדס אצטריך למיתני תקנתא דס\"ד אמינא כיון דגדולו בפסול תו לית ליה תקנתא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where they infer from the exact wording various other rules. If the Mishnah was just telling us the simple rule, it should have said in what shape the 3 walls have to be and what size, do they have to be rectangular? What <strong>length</strong> do the walls have to be? How far apart can they be? I can't say a  general explanation for why some Mishnah's speak in the positive (Chiuv) and others speak in the negative (Shlila) each case has its own reasoning. If your question is specifically on the Mishnah in Sukkah, then you should ask a separate question, but if you go to the Gemara there and the first two Tosafos', you will notice that based on the exact wording of the Mishnah, we have various other questions regarding if the height of a Mavoi is the main height, and Sukkah is learned out from that, or the other way around etc...</p>\n<p>So: There's no blanket-all-in-one reason why some Mishnahs speak in the chiyuv and others in the shlila, each one has its own reasoning, and should be asked as a separate question for each case.</p>\n\n\n",

HaRav, both seem to agree that one may drink wine mead and beer to quench thirst outside the sukkah as long as it is not a fixed established drinking session.</p>\n\n<p>The definition of fixed and established drinking according to the Ritva would be based on a minimum amount consumed (revi'is), while the definition according to later poskim would be spending time sitting down (perhaps with a group of drinking friends) in a relaxed manner for an official drinking event.</p>\n\n<p>IIRC, the Meiri, holds that wine may be drunk outside of the sukkah.</p>\n\n<p>(Those who wish to say that there is such a thing as establishing oneself over wine which needs a sukkah, bring their proof from the Mishnah in Sukkah 25a and the Braisa in 28b which seems to treat \"drinking\" as a separate action obligated in a sukkah. Those who do not hold that wine can establish such an obligation point to Brachos 36b which says that wine does not establish anything.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion: Most opinions hold that merely drinking wine or beer does not require a sukkah. However, some opinions hold that drinking wine or beer in an established manner, will require a sukkah. Some of these opinions hold that beer is just as important as wine for the purpose of requiring a sukkah.</strong></p>\n\n<p>(For resolving the question of requiring a brachah of \"Leshev BaSukkah\" on such drinking, see further in the above sources for particular situations, or ask a new question, as such details go beyond the scope of the OP IMHO.)</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Papa said to him: It is written in the Torah: \"A single\n  witness shall not rise up against a man.\" [Deuteronomy 19:15]. When\n  you testified against him alone, all you did was to bring him into\n  disrepute. You knew you were the only witness and you knew I could not\n  condemn him on the basis of a single witness, so I am having YOU\n  punished. [Tractate Pesachim, 113b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is: is it the judge's job to order more investigations, or simply to rule based on what is brought before him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>A very serious question. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There are not many Halachic court procedures that were accepted between Sages as the Gemmorah clearly shows. I remind you, that at their times there was no Talmud and the Mishnah wasn't so widely accepted as the final Halacha. In other words, all the Sages had when doing justice was the Torah and their personal experience.<br>\n.<br>\nSo why the Talmud brings stories instead of Halachos? My bet - the Sages were pretty much \"improvising\". Those improvisations were recorded in the Gemmorah and that turned into the Halacha MUCH LATER.</p></li>\n<li><p>Maybe this could explain why R' Papa decided to hear the only witness in the first place, as it seems from Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Testimony.5.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Edus 5:1</a>) that the Torah's warning is for the court, not for the witness (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Testimony.5.1?lang=he&with=Shulchan%20Arukh,%20Choshen%20Mishpat&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see SHU\"A also!</a>). So seemingly R\"P wanted to punish Zigod for something that did not become the Halachah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.113b.3?lang=bi&p2=Rashbam_on_Pesachim.113b.3.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see Rashba\"M that mentions spreading rumors</a>). And because this story is not so \"Halachic\" it is brought here as an example for the preceding statement (G-d hating a single witness) and not in Sanhedrin to learn Halachah that a single witness can be punished.</p></li>\n<li><p>For two witnesses to be valid, they have to see each other (Rambam ibid). So if one person shows up and says he didn't see another witness around a trial cannot start and no investigation can be carried out. Theoretically, in a case of a body was found or a woman raped, a court can turn to the public or send the messengers to sniff around until two valid witnesses could be found (or made).</p></li>\n<li><p>We do have, however, the idea of the presumption of innocence, so Tuvia is innocent until proven otherwise. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>PS: 3. I also remind you, that in the times of the Sages, the Jews were under [adifferent levels of] foreign control, ranging from a full autonomy to total lack of such. Lots of politics both in the Holy Land and Babylon, you know how Rebbi acted for example. So your question about the judges' ability to investigate crimes is not only limited by the judges' determination to find the truth but by the local politics. </p>\n\n\n",

This is because ideally we need the two tefillin to be connected and adjacent to each other, as it is written: \"It shall be for you as a sign on your arm and a remembrance between your eyes\", that they should have the same \"being\" for the two of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <em>Shaar HaTziyun</em> he cites the <em>Magen Avraham</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.25.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.k. 14</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואפי' לאותן המניחין בח\"ה בלא ברכה אפי' הכי עבירה היא להסיח (ב\"י מהרא\"י)‏</p>\n<p>Even those who wear tefillin on Chol HaMoed without a blessing, even so it is a transgression to speak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Magen Avraham</em> cites the <em>Beis Yosef</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.25.7.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad. loc.</a>) and <em>Terumas HaDeshen</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Terumat_HaDeshen%2C_Part_II.107.1?vhe=Warsaw_1882&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#107</a>) (who the <em>Beis Yosef</em> brings). The <em>Pri Megadim</em> (Mishbetzos Zahav ad. loc. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x618\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.k. 4</a>; Eishel Avraham ad. loc. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x619\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.k. 17</a>) explains that this concept of having the two tefillin be connected comes from <em>Ba'al HaMeor</em> at the end of Rosh Hashanah. According to him, not only is speaking forbidden, but even answering Amen Yehei Shmeih Rabbah.</p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>, the <em>Pri Megadim</em> infers from the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.25.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seif 10</a> that the latter disagrees with the <em>Ba'al HaMeor</em>. Really the issue is unnecessarily causing a new blessing to be said. Therefore, someone who doesn't make a blessing on Chol HaMoed could in fact answer Yehei Shmeih Rabbah. The <em>Magen Avraham</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.25.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.k. 17</a>) therefore says that it would be permissible to respond in such a case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומ\"מ משמע דהמניח בחה\"מ בלא ברכה רשאי לענות דליכא איסורא בזה אלא משום שגורם ברכה: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would seem though the the <em>Magen Avraham</em> holds לכתחילה, ideally, to consider the opinion of the <em>Ba'al HaMeor</em>. That's why he forbade speaking on Chol HaMoed between the tefillin. Indeed, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> above explained the reasoning for not interrupting the same as the <em>Ba'al HaMeor</em>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, even though the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org./Mishnah_Berurah.25.36?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.k. 36</a>) rules like this latter <em>Magen Avraham</em> that it's permissible to respond to Amen Yehei Shmeih Rabbah on Chol HaMoed between the tefillin, he says to move the tefillin shel yad from their spot and then put them back before putting on the shel rosh. This way it'll be as if the act of putting on the two tefillin was connected:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובחוה\"מ או המניח תפילין דר\"ת וכיוצא שמניח בלי ברכה יש להקל ולהפסיק לעניית איש\"ר וקדושה וברכו ואמן אך אח\"כ יזיז הש\"י ממקומו קודם שיניח הש\"ר כדי שיהיה הוייה אחת לשניהן:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For some reason though the <em>Magen Avraham</em> and <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> don't want to rely on this solution for trivial interruptions. They only permit these important responses.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/791834/rabbi-aryeh-lebowitz/ten-minute-halacha-tefillin-on-chol-hamoed/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a lecture</a> about  wearing <em>tefillin</em> on <em>Chol Hamoed</em> (starting at approximately 8:26 into the recording), <a href=\"https://www.bknw.org/about-us\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Aryeh Lebowitz</a> said as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now if you happen to put on <em>tefillin</em> without a <em>beracha</em> like the\n  <em>shitas haTaz</em>, so the whole thing about not being <em>mafsik</em> between the <em>beracha</em> that you say on the <em>shel yad</em> until after you finish\n  putting on the <em>shel rosh</em> – even for <em>amen yehei shemei rabbah</em>, and\n  <em>amein</em>, and <em>kedushah</em> and <em>barechu</em> – so that won't apply. You would then be allowed to answer for all those things in between the <em>shel\n  yad</em> and the <em>shel rosh</em>. You may need to again adjust the <em>shel yad</em>\n  afterwards to make the connection between the <em>shel yad</em> and the <em>shel\n  rosh</em> but you would be allowed to answer to all those things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His point seems to be that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/95747/13438\">even if there needs to be a connection between the <em>shel yad</em> and the <em>shel rosh</em></a>, the connection can be established after the interruption. Normally this can't be done because it would be an interruption between the <em>beracha</em> and the <em>mitzvah</em>, but in this case that issue is moot.</p>\n\n\n",

That is why Moshe appointed the 70 elders (the first Sanhedrin) before the events described later.

    "content": "# Why do we change the Haftarah for Simchas Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Megillah 31a says the following regarding the Simchas Torah reading:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>למחר קורין וזאת הברכה ומפטירין (מלכים א ח, כב) ויעמד שלמה</p>\n  \n  <p>On the next day [after Shmini Atzeres] we read Vezos HaBeracha, and we read as the Haftarah from “And Shlomo stood up” (Melachim 1:8:22). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every shul I’ve ever been to, of any nusach, reads the beginning of Sefer Yehoshua as the Simchas Torah Haftarah, a different Haftarah than the one prescribed by the Gemara. Why do we change it?</p>\n\n<p>This question is asked by Tosfos, but they leave it unanswered. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>למחר קרינן וזאת הברכה ומפטירין ויעמוד שלמה - ויש מקומות שנהגו להפטיר בויהי אחרי מות משה ושיבוש הוא שהרי הש\"ס אין אומר כן ויש אומרים שרב האי גאון תקן לומר ויהי אחרי מות משה אבל אינן יודעין הסברא אמאי שנה סדר הש\"ס:</p>\n  \n  <p>Some places have the Minhag to read as the Haftarah from “And it was after Moshe’s death,” and it’s a mistake, for the Gemara doesn’t say this. Some say that Rav Hai Gaon established that we say “And it was after Moshe’s death,” but they don’t know the reason why he changed from the order of the Gemara. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what is the answer to Tosfos’ question? Why did Rav Hai Gaon institute this Haftarah instead of the one prescribed by the Gemara? </p>\n\n<p>To clarify: I am not asking why we read from Yehoshua; I am asking why we <em>don’t</em> read from Melachim Aleph. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Asher Ben Yechiel</a> cites the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jerusalem Talmud</a> as the source for reading the beginning of Yehoshua as the <em>haftarah</em>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rosh Megillah 4:10</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ביו\"ט אחרון של חג קורין כל הבכור ומפטירין ויהי ככלות שלמה ולמחר קורא\n  וזאת הברכה ומפטירין ויעמוד שלמה לפני ה' וי\"א ויהי אחרי מות משה עבד ה'\n  והכי איתא בירושלמי והכי נהגינן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is codified by his son <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Asher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

It's not like someone made up this <em>haftarah</em> out of nowhere if it's actually the <em>haftarah</em> prescribed by the Jerusalem Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>The slight problem with this is that, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Weil\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Netanel Weil</a> pointed out in his commentary to the Rosh, this passage does not appear to actually exist in the Jerusalem Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47587&st=&pgnum=409\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in his commentary to the Tosafot you quoted</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Kamenetsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Kamentzky</a> tries to answer Tosafot's question by advancing a theory for how our custom developed. He suggests that this is intertwined with the triennial Torah-reading cycle. He argues that when the Torah was only finished every third year, the topic of the completion of the Torah was not as relevant to Shemini Atzeret/Simchat Torah, and therefore they would read the <em>haftarah</em> from Melachim. Once the triennial cycle was abolished, R. Hai Gaon came along and decided that since Simchat Torah is now always the day when we complete the Torah, it makes sense that the <em>haftarah</em> should be the beginning of Yehoshua which demonstrates the connection between the end of the Torah and the beginning of Neviim, and is the continuation of the story after Moshe's death.</p>\n\n\n",

Seeing how poorly-sourced the OP’s dimensions were, I thought I’d ask it myself. </p>\n\n<p>We’re told that the Lishkah was halfway in the Azarah (Yoma 25a), and that it was on the south side of the Azarah (Middos 5:4). But as far as I can tell, we’re not told more than that. I tried gathering its dimensions from the preceding Mishnayos in Middos, which place the Azarah at 187 Amos from east to west and 135 Amos from north to south (5:1-2), but those same Mishnayos seem to use up all of those Amos in the Azarah itself. </p>\n\n<p>Are there any sources that explicitly tell us how big the Lishkas HaGazis (or the Lishkos in general) were, in the second Beis HaMikdash? I’d prefer a Gemara that I’m missing, but I’ll accept anything as late as the Rishonim, as long as it’s a precise number, not a guess based on a popular illustration or tile counting on an artist’s rendition.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The source for the pictures that are giving us trouble here is the Rambam at the end of meseches Midos in Peirush HaMishmayos.

A rendition from the original is available in the Kapah mishnayos.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam, however, drew this drawing not to scale, so the size cannot be determined precisely, only that the part in the Azara was less than 11 Amos deep (east-west).</p>\n\n<p>I have studied the plan of the Second Temple extensively from the Talmudic sources, and I have not come across anyone who gives exact dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest that the Lishkas Hagazis was in the eastern wall of the Azara, according to the Rambam, and that less than half of it was sanctified. The remaining portion would be over the Lishkas Hamitzoraim of the Ezras Noshim, which was 40 amos wide, allowing for the semicircle to be 40 amos by 20, which is a little tight (40*π/2=62.8) for 71 people, but not unreasonable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is the true answer (that brings us back to my puzzling):</p>\n\n<p>This is the Tifferes Isroel's plan drawn to scale (on the bottom) found at the end of Mishnah in Midos:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gD5NZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gD5NZ.jpg\" alt=\"![enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>(If you look at the wall, the bricks are 5x10 Amas to scale).</p>\n\n<p>From this plan we can learn that (according to him) the Lishka was about 25 Amas (12 meters) long, while the left part of it was in Kodesh (Ezras Isroel) and was populated only by Kohanim, and its right half - about 6 by 6 meters, entirely INSIDE THE WALL - was used by the Sanhedrin!</p>\n\n<p>If this is not enough, this is the OFFICIAL version of THE Machon Hamikdash here in the Old City, you can't question them, come on!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AJrhe.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AJrhe.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I don't know what to add, but (if it is drawn to scale) the whole Lishkah was less than the Mizbeah (which was 16x16 meters)!</p>\n\n<p>Here's the original WIKI plan of the second BM:</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OFlCa.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OFlCa.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></h2>\n\n<p>Some textual sources:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>the Mishnah Middos 5:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"מִן הַצָּפוֹן לַדָּרוֹם מֵאָה וּשְׁלֹשִׁים וְחָמֵשׁ, הַכֶּבֶשׁ וְהַמִּזְבֵּחַ שִׁשִּׁים וּשְׁתַּיִם.\"\n  \"שֵׁשׁ לְשָׁכוֹת הָיוּ בָעֲזָרָה...שֶׁבַּדָּרוֹם, לִשְׁכַּת הָעֵץ, לִשְׁכַּת הַגּוֹלָה, לִשְׁכַּת הַגָּזִית...  לִשְׁכַּת הַגָּזִית, שָׁם הָיְתָה סַנְהֶדְרִי גְדוֹלָה שֶׁל יִשְׂרָאֵל יוֹשֶׁבֶת וְדָנָה אֶת הַכְּהֻנָּה וכו'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Gemmorah in Yomah 25a:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"אמר אביי שמע מינה לשכת הגזית חציה בקדש וחציה בחול ושמע מינה שני פתחים היו לה אחד פתוח בקדש ואחד פתוח בחול\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Bartenurah on the Mishnah combines the two perfectly:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"שם היתה סנהדרי גדולה של ישראל יושבת. <strong>בצד החול שבה.</strong> לפי שלשכת הגזית היתה חציה בקודש וחציה בחול, ובחציה של קודש לא היה אפשר לסנהדרין לשבת, שאין ישיבה בעזרה אלא למלכי בית דוד בלבד וכו'.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

When Nisuch Hamayim was celebrated in the [second] Temple during the 7 days of Succot, originally [during the first Temple] the joy was so enormous, and everybody participated, including the Kings, that no separation was made during the celebrations even in the Ezrat Nashim in the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>Sometime during the second Temple, the problem you mentioned emerged. Probably people got less spiritual, less obsessed with the Mitzvah of the Simchah and started gazing around. The Sages decided to stop the practice and install a balcony for women. This is how [probably] the whole idea of Ezrat Nashim started (there were no shuls yet).</p>\n\n<p>The Orthodox movement (esp in Israel) took the idea a little further, completely separating men and women on all public occasions, all the Haredi shuls have a separate Ezrat Nashim, with a separate entrance with either one-way mirrors or thick fabric, prohibiting men from seeing women at all.</p>\n\n<p>However less Orthodox movements took a less stringent approach. I also saw R' Moshe's Psak (don't remember the source) that concluded based on that Gemmorah that men are allowed TO SEE women during the service or celebrations with the Mechitzah being a physical separation only.</p>\n\n<p>So back to your question. The described behavior happens either in less stringent communities that practice a Mechitzah in the first place, or is based on the premise that the men will exalt in their Midos beyond their primary urges, just like in the days of our ancestors.</p>\n\n\n",

Shouldn't we be asking for forgiveness in Sivan <strong>after</strong> Pesach?</p>\n\n<p>2) G-d gave us the commandment to decide how the calendar works which includes how to place leap years. As it is, with the fixed calendar, the placement of the leap years are correct, with the exception of the 8th year in the 19 year cycle - currently. (This is based on the current dates and is due to the \"seasonal drift\" problem - discussed in a few M.Y. questions.) So, why is this statement said at all? Why should we ask for any type of \"forgiveness\" for adding a leap year if G-d allowed us to do so, and it turns out that a year, such as this year, <strong>needs</strong> to be a leap year.</p>\n\n\n",

(Pri Megadim, MZ 207)</p>\n\n<p>Others disagree, and claim that the above principle doesn't apply, because hearing Kiddush is better than regular שליחות, because שומע כעונה - it is considered as though he said it himself. (Tosefes Shabbos 273.10) </p>\n\n<p>Many prefer to participate in the Kiddush of the host, because ברוב עם הדרת מלך - it is preferable to have more people participating in the Mitzvah than for each to perform it privately. (See Mishne Berura, 213.3)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I can't speak for why most people who offer do so, or for why most people who accept accept, but I have a friend who both offers guests and accepts when offered as a guest because he has a short attention span, and doesn't want to rely on himself to pay attention to someone else for the entire <em>kiddush</em>. If he does it himself, he'll be better off. Lest a guest have a similarly short attention span, he offers guests. (I don't know if he offers or accepts Shabbos day <em>kiddush</em>, which one only needs to pay attention to about 4 seconds of, but maybe once you space out during the <em>pesukim</em> it's hard to keep track of when to space back in.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch 201,4</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צריך לחזור שיתנו לו כוס של ברכה לברך:<br>\n  A person should go out of his way to be given his own cup of wine of a Mitzva to make his own blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The source is from Nazir 66b the Shulchan Aruch paskens like Rav and Rav Huna that one should jump to say the Brocho himself rather than let someone else say the Brocho and say Amen:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל רב לחייא בריה חטוף ובריך וכן א\"ל רב הונא לרבה בריה חטוף ובריך למימרא ד<strong>מברך עדיף</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rosh explains clearly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חטוף כוס של ברכה <strong>וכן כל ברכות</strong>\n  Grab the oppurtunity to <strong>make your own Brocho</strong> (rather then say amein) <strong>and this applies to all brochos</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So when one has his own Cup of wine he should specifically not be Yotzi with someone else rather make his own brocho,</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>{And Tosfos Pesachim 106a brings down a Minhag to give each person his own cup to make Kiddush which implies that Each person should ideally have his own cup of wine:</p>\n\n<p>ירושלמי דברכות א\"ר אבא בשם רב מסובין אסורין לטעום עד שיטעום המברך ר' יהושע בן לוי אומר שותין אע\"פ שלא שתה ולא פליגי מה דא\"ר אבהו כשהיו כולן זקוקין לכוס אחד מה דאמר ר' יהושע כשיש לכל אחד כוסו בידו ומשמע נמי אם אין כוסו בידו אפי' שפך מכוס ברכה לכוסות אחרים אין להם לטעום עד שיטעום המברך אבל כשיש לכל אחד כוס א\"צ להמתין ולכך הוה גחין ושתי ומכאן יש להוכיח שא\"צ לשפוך מכוס של ברכה לשאר כוסות ומיהו היכא דפגימי צריך לשפוך ממנו לשאר כוסות כדי שישתו כולם מכוס שאינו פגום\nRabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says When each person is holding his own cup of wine while the host is making Kiddush they do not need to wait for the host to drink, rather each person can drink from his own cup straight away unless their cups are deficient in which case one must pour from the hosts cup into their cups (before the host drinks and his cup also becomes Pagum-deficient) Rabbi Aba says if there is only one cup available fro the host, one must not taste the hosts cup of wine before he has tasted it himself after having made Kiddush.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Pri Megadim misquoted in another answer that Shomea ka-oneh means one should always do Kiddush oneself rather than be a listener. This does not apply with Kiddush on friday night before the meal Since men have said Kiddush in Amida, they have already fulfilled their obligation of making Kiddush themselves. So there absolutely no problem to listen to the baal habayis making Kiddush <em>again</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Why does <em>om ani chomah</em> precede <em>e-l lemosha'ot</em>?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that in such a year, <em>adon hamoshia</em> cannot be recited, as it is only ever recited on the sixth day of <em>sukkot</em>, which in this case is <em>shabbat</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But why is its substitute <em>om ani chomah</em> (which is only ever customarily recited in a year of this type, notwithstanding Eliyah Rabbah <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7767&st=&pgnum=424\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) recited before <em>e-l lemosha’ot</em>? Why not recite it afterwards, in the same way that every other year <em>adon hamoshia</em> is after <em>e-l lemosha’ot</em>?</p>\n\n<p>[It's possible that there's some reason that would specifically link <em>om ani chomah</em> to the fourth day of <em>sukkot</em> and <em>e-l lemosha'ot</em> to the fifth day, but that seems somewhat unlikely when we consider a year where the first day of <em>sukkot</em> is a Tuesday, in which case common practice is to recite <em>e-l lemosha'ot</em> on the fourth day of <em>sukkot</em> and not recite <em>om ani chomah</em> at all.]</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary, please explain why <em>om ani chomah</em> comes before <em>e-l lemosha’ot</em>.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's nothing too deep. E-l lemoshaot was instituted for the fifth day of Sukkot, as it is practical to be said then almost every year. Om ani Choma is an extra, said only out of necessity in a year like this one. It is therefore said on the fourth day, which for other technical reasons doesn't have any fixed nusach.</p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp164.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While on the face of it, this may seem like ascribing emotions to God, we have to look how Maimonides explains God's emotions earlier. From <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 1:54:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whenever any one of His actions is perceived by us, we ascribe to God\n  that emotion which is the source of the act when performed by\n  ourselves, and call Him by an epithet which is formed from the verb\n  expressing that emotion. We see, e.g., how well He provides for the\n  life of the embryo of living beings; how He endows with certain\n  faculties both the embryo itself and those who have to rear it after\n  its birth, in order that it may be protected from death and\n  destruction, guarded against all harm, and assisted in the performance\n  of all that is required [for its development]. Similar acts, when\n  performed by us, are due to a certain emotion and tenderness called\n  mercy and pity. God is, therefore, said to be merciful: e.g., \"Like as\n  a father is merciful to his children, so the Lord is merciful to them\n  that fear Him\" (Ps. ciii. 13); \"And I will spare them, as a man\n  spareth (yaḥamol) his own son that serveth him\" (Mal. iii. 17). Such\n  instances do not imply that God is influenced by a feeling of mercy,\n  but that acts similar to those which a father performs for his son,\n  out of pity, mercy and real affection, emanate from God solely for the\n  benefit of His pious men, and are by no means the result of any\n  impression or change--[produced in God].--When we give something to a\n  person who has no claim upon us, we perform an act of grace; e.g.,\n  \"Grant them graciously unto us\" (Judges xxi. 22). [The same term is\n  used in reference to God, e.g.] \"which God hath graciously given\"\n  (Gen. xxxiii. 5); \"Because God hath dealt graciously with me\" (ib.\n  11). Instances of this kind are numerous. God creates and guides\n  beings who have no claim upon Him to be created and guided by Him; He\n  is therefore called gracious (ḥannun)--His actions towards mankind\n  also include great calamities, which overtake individuals and bring\n  death to them, or affect whole families and even entire regions,\n  spread death, destroy generation after generation, and spare nothing\n  whatsoever. Hence there occur inundations, earthquakes, destructive\n  storms, expeditions of one nation against the other for the sake of\n  destroying it with the sword and blotting out its memory, and many\n  other evils of the same kind. Whenever such evils are caused by us to\n  any person, they originate in great anger, violent jealousy, or a\n  desire for revenge. God is therefore called, because of these acts,\n  \"jealous,\" \"revengeful,\" \"wrathful,\" and \"keeping anger\" (Nah. i. 2)\n  that is to say, He performs acts similar to those which, when\n  performed by us, originate in certain psychical dispositions, in\n  jealousy, desire for retaliation, revenge, or anger: they are in\n  accordance with the guilt of those who are to be punished, and not the\n  result of any emotion: for He is above all defect! The same is the\n  case with all divine acts: though resembling those acts which emanate\n  from our passions and psychical dispositions, they are not due to\n  anything superadded to His essence. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp064.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Maimonides tells us that whenever we speak of God's emotions we do not actually mean that God has emotions. We are simply referring to how God's actions would be described if performed by a human being. I.e. God is called merciful, not because he has the emotion of mercy, but because had a human being done the same actions they would have stemmed from mercy. Likewise we God is called angry not because he actually has the emotion of anger, but because a human being doing the same actions would be acting out of anger.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It seems to me that emotions are not properties of body, but more like properties of soul. Even so, I don't think the Rambam is committed to thinking that god does in fact have emotions, only that god can be imagined as such, as Alex answered already. So that I think the Rambam would say:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>One must not imagine god as having physical properties</li>\n<li>One can (maybe even should) imagine god as having emotions</li>\n<li>God does not in fact have emotions</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The claim that Yishmael repented when he was dying\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was reading ArtScroll' <em>machzor</em>'s commentary to the Torah reading on the first day of Rosh Hashanah, which they say was taken from <a href=\"http://artscroll.com/Books/9780899063621.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ArtScroll's Bereishis</a>. After being told that Yishmael was dying, the verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.17?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 21:17</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּֽי־שָׁמַ֧ע אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶל־ק֥וֹל הַנַּ֖עַר בַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר הוּא־שָֽׁם</p>\n  \n  <p>Hashem heard the cry of the youth according to how he is there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In ArtScroll's commentary, they bring the explanation of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.21.17.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>. They summarize it by writing that <strong>Yishmael repented</strong> and prayed for mercy. The angels argued that Yishmael's descendants will kill innocent Jews, and he shouldn't be saved. Hashem told them that He was judging him according to how he was then at that moment, and not taking the future into account. Since he is presently righteous, he should be saved.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is Rashi doesn't say that Yishmael repented. In fact, the commentaries on Rashi explicitly ask that <em>Chazal</em> only <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.25.9.1?lang=bi&p2=Bereishit_Rabbah.38.12&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tell us</a> that Yishmael  repented when Avraham died, implying he didn't repent earlier (see Minchas Yehudah ad. loc.). They therefore are bothered why the <em>Midrash</em> Rashi brings says Yishmael is righteous. They give different explanations [<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Bereishit.21.17.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siftei_Chakhamim%2C_Genesis.21.17.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a>, for example], but they don't say that he repented.</p>\n\n<p>Where is ArtScroll coming from? The simple reading of Rashi? How can they ignore the commentaries on Rashi? Is there a different commentary that I haven't seen that they are using?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all, I subsequently looked at ArtScroll's Bereishis. I could  find no reference to the fact that Yishmael repented. They simply brought the commentaries on Rashi which I quoted in the question. Either this is a mistake, or I looked in the wrong spot, or an older version or something.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, even though all the commentaries I saw on Rashi say that Yishmael was guilty of his crimes at that point in the Torah, one stood out as saying like ArtScroll's commentary: The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Luria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharshal</a> in Yeriyos Shlomo <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44818&st=&pgnum=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ד\"ה אמרו לו</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואני אומר לכל הפירושים היה צדיק כיון שהיה מתחרט על עונותיו ואפשר היה מתודה עליהם ומשום הכי שמע הקב\"ה לתפלתו אלא שהמלאכים אמרו וכי בעבור זה אתה עושה לו נס שממנו תקלה יצא לישראל וכו'‏</p>\n  \n  <p>I say, according to all the explanations, [Yishmael] was righteous. This is because he regreted his transgressions, and perhaps he confessed over them. This is why Hashem listened to his prayers. It's just that the Angels were saying that because of this [repentance, Hashem] will make a miracle for him? This will cause a tragedy for the Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>When he was a child, he didn't actually sin yet. So why did Sarah wish to have them expelled? Because he exhibited evil behavior. At the moment by the be'er, though, he was still righteous since he didn't actually <em>start</em> sinning. When he was older, he sinned and later regretted them at or prior to the funeral of Avraham.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are there any opinions that the \"extra\" aliyos on Simchas Torah are a separate reading, rather than an extension of the first five aliyos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a common minhag to read the Simchas Torah reading repeatedly in order that all men get an aliyah, as opposed to the usual five prescribed for Yom Tov (Rema OC 282:1-2). </p>\n\n<p>After mulling over the minhag during Yom Tov, I realized that there are potentially two ways to look at this minhag: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Each set of five aliyos is its own reading, with Chasan Torah and Chasan Bereishis being added aliyos to the final set of five.</li>\n<li>It's one long reading, where the first five aliyos are the \"main\" reading, and the rest are extra aliyos being tacked onto the end of the original set.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I can think of two practical differences between these approaches. Amongst the \"main\" aliyos, a Kohen gets the first aliyah and a Levi gets the second (Shulchan Aruch OC 135:3). However, a Kohen or Levi is allowed to get an \"additional\" aliyah that's not one of the main aliyos (Rema, ibid. §10). As such, if the later aliyos are considered \"extra\" aliyos on the first five, then a Kohen or Levi could get any aliyah after the first five, regardless of whether it's the first/second of its five-aliyah cycle. However, if each set of five aliyos is a new reading, then a Kohen can only get the first aliyah of each set and a Levi the second of each set.</p>\n\n<p>The second practical difference is a bit simpler to articulate: must you complete the set of five aliyos? If they're all extra aliyos, then there would be no issue of ending at any arbitrary point after the first five aliyos; however, if each set is its own reading, then one would have to complete the set of five aliyos, even if it means calling up people twice, as one may not decrease the number of aliyos (Shulchan Aruch, OC 135:1).</p>\n\n<p>The way the Rema records the minhag seems to indicate that the minhag follows the second approach. In OC 282:1, he writes (translation and emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן נהגו במדינות אלו מלבד בשמחת תורה <strong>שמוסיפין הרבה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>And thus is the custom in these countries [not to add aliyos on Yom Tov], except for on Simchas Torah <strong>when we add many [aliyos]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise, in §2, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן נהגו במדינות אלו חוץ מבשמחת תורה שנהגו <strong>להרבות בקרואים</strong> ונוהגים כסברא ראשונה</p>\n  \n  <p>And thus is the custom in these countries [for later aliyos not to repeat that which earlier aliyos already read], except for on Simchas Torah, when the custom is <strong>to add aliyos</strong>, where the custom follows the first opinion [that this is permitted].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From his wording of \"increasing aliyos,\" it indicates like the second approach I posited earlier, that the later aliyos are extra aliyos being tacked onto the first five.</p>\n\n<p>I saw later that Ta'amei HaMinhagim §831 quotes the Levush (§669), the Ashel Avraham (§665), and the Pri Megadim (§669), who all, in the contexts of calling a Kohen or Levi, or someone who already received an aliyah, for Chasan Torah/Bereishis, make the same point: the first five are the main reading, and the remainder are extras.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anyone who holds of the first approach I posited earlier, that each set of five aliyos is its own reading?</p>\n\n\n",

No\nperson assumes that there is a door or gate in heaven, but every one\nunderstands that this is a simile and a figurative expression. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp134.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elsewhere he states that this was the greatest of the miracles God performed in the wilderness because it was not a one-time temporary miracle, but an ongoing miracle for forty years.</p>\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 3:50</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now the greatest of the miracles described in the Law is the stay of\nthe Israelites in the wilderness for forty years, with a daily supply\nof manna. This wilderness, as described in Scripture, consisted of\nplaces \"wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions, and drought, where\nthere was no water\" (Deut. viii. 115); places very remote from\ncultivated land, and naturally not adapted for the habitation of man,\n\"It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates,\nneither is there any water to drink\" (Num. xx. 5); \"A land that no man\npassed through, and where no man dwelt\" (Jer. ii. 6). [In reference to\nthe stay of the Israelites in the wilderness], Scripture relates, \"Ye\nhave not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink\"\n(Deut. xix. 5). All these miracles were wonderful, public, and\nwitnessed by the people. But God knew that in future people might\ndoubt the correctness of the account of these miracles. in the same\nmanner as they doubt the accuracy of other narratives; they might\nthink that the Israelites stayed in the wilderness in a place not far\nfrom inhabited land, where it was possible for man to live [in the\nordinary way]; that it was like those deserts in which Arabs live at\npresent; or that they dwelt in such places in which they could plow,\nsow, and reap, or live on some vegetable that was growing there; or\nthat manna came always down in those places as an ordinary natural\nproduct; or that there were wells of water in those places. In order\nto remove all these doubts and to firmly establish the accuracy of the\naccount of these miracles, Scripture enumerates all the stations, so\nthat coming generations may see them, and learn the greatness of the\nmiracle which enabled human beings to live in those places forty\nyears. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp186.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gersonides actually has a lengthy discussion about whether the miracle of the manna was actually possible (in accordance with his view of miracles, which I briefly discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/86704/deviations-of-ralbag-from-normative-jewish-theology/88099#88099\">here</a>) but ultimately concludes that it was possible (and did occur):</p>\n<p><strong>Commentary to Exodus 16:4</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראוי שתדע שזה המופת היה נפלא מאד כי לא יתכן שיתהוה על דרך הטבע דבר מזה\nבעת מהעתים  כי לא יתהוה מאלו האידים העולים באויר דבר יתכן שיהיה מזון\nוזה מבואר במעט עיון למי שעיין בטבעיות והנה על כל פנים יתכן שיהיה\nמעירוב היסודות והמזגם מה שיהיה טבעו כטבע זה המן אשר ירד להם מן השמים\nשאם לא היה הענין כן יהיה מציאות המן דבר נמנע מצד עצמותו ומה שזה דרכו\nלא יתחדש על דרך מופת כמו שזכרנו במה שקדם והנה היה התהוות המן בזולת\nסיבותיו  באופן התהוות מהמטה נחש רוצה לומר שאין מציאות המן דבר נמנע מצד\nעצמותו  כמו שאין מציאות הנחש נמנע מצד עצמותו ואמנם היה נמנע מדרך הטבע\nשיהיה המן מאלו האידים או מהאויר ושיהיה נחש מהמטה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like Maimonides, he also points out elsewhere the especially miraculous aspect of the miracle occurring for forty years, noting that this is one of the ways in which Moses is different from other prophets:</p>\n<p><strong>Commentary to Deuteronomy 34:10-11</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והשלישי הוא שלא התמידו אותותיהם ומופתיהם לעיני כל ישראל כמו העניין\nבמשה שהתמיד ירידת המן מ' שנה ועניין עמוד הענן ועמוד האש ודבור השם\nיתעלה עמו שהיה תמיד בעמוד ענן לעיני כל ישראל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The supremacy of the miracle of the manna was actually pointed out even earlier by R. Saadia Gaon:</p>\n<p><strong>Emunot V'Deiot 1:6</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Personally, however, I consider the case of the miracle of the manna as the most amazing of all miracles, because a phenomenon of an enduring nature excites greater wonderment than one of a passing character.</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation p. 29)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is Yaakov’s name changed twice?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the parasha of Vayishlach Yaakov’s name is changed twice. Both times his new name is Yisrael. He is morphed twice from the ‘One Who Grasps Ankles’ to ‘the One Who Wrestles with G-d.’ The first time he is renamed by the adversary he wrestles with throughout the night (<a href=\"https://sefaria.org/Genesis.32.29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 32:29</a>). On the second occasion he is renamed by G-d Himself (<a href=\"https://sefaria.org/Genesis.35.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">35:10</a>).

The angel says \"לא יעקב <strong>יאמר</strong> עוד שמך\", which R' Hirsch interprets as \"not Jacob shall they name be <strong>expressed</strong> any more,\"<sup>1</sup> while God says \"לא <strong>יקרא</strong> שמך עוד יעקב\", which R' Hirsch interprets as \"thy name shall no longer be <strong>called</strong> Jacob.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to R' Hirsch, the angel's message is not that Yaakov's name is changing, but that the same name Yaakov would now be <strong>understood</strong> as Yisrael, meaning \"God is the All-conquering one.\" When people see a \"Yaakov,\" apparently a weak member of the \"heel\" of society, miraculously overpowering stronger-looking foes, it demonstrates that God is all-powerful, and that He can and does intervene to help those who are close to him vanquish any power. When this happens, \"Yaakov\" teaches the world that \"Yisrael.\"</p>\n\n<p>R' Hirsch doesn't return to the topic on 35:10 to explain why God formalizes the name change at this point. I would suggest that now that Yaakov's family has attained it's full strength at 12 sons, it's hard to see Yaakov personally as a mere heel-grabber anymore. He is clearly the head of a mighty clan. Now, God says, the \"Yisrael\" message is apparent not in individual surprising victories by a weak-looking Yaakov, but by the evolution of previously-weak Yaakov into the mighty proto-nation of Yisrael.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. As translated into English by Isaac Levy</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As a reaction to Mordecai:</p>\n<p>Gen 28:12 and 16 clearly shows Ya’akov had a prophetic dream/vision. Then in Gen 28:18 and 19 shows he set up a pillar and anointed it, while calling the place Beth-El and making a vow. Now Gen 31:13 refers back to what I just described and 31:11 teaches that in a dream a messenger of the Lord spoke to Ya’akov, a messenger is send to deliver a message in name of the messenger. The words Malach HaShem are like Na’ar Elisheva (2 Kings 5:20).</p>\n<p>In Gen 35:1 and 35:7 Ya’akov names the place Beth-El: for there had G-d been revealed unto Ya’akov, in his fleeing from the face of his brother. It becomes clear from these verses that they also refer back to what I described, because G-d revealed Himself through a dream and Ya’akov had this dream after he had to leave his house because of Esav who wanted to kill him.</p>\n<p>So far Ya’akov has not seen G-d in a literal or physical way.</p>\n<p>Then what about Gen 32:30 it says Ya’akov saw el panim elohim.. see Judges 13:22 from the context it becomes clear he saw an messenger of the Lord and claimed similar words as Ya’akov. Seen could also have the meaning of becoming aware of something and face-to-face could also mean in a personal way. Ya’akov became aware of G-d through this personal encounter. It’s just like on Mount Sinai it says that people saw G-d while all they saw was a big cloud and lightning etc. and they only heard His voice (Deut 4:12); it doesn’t mean they saw G-d in a literal and physical way, but G-d revealed himself to them by what they could actually behold. Just as G-d revealed Himself to the people through the plagues and miracles in Egypt; i.e. it became clear to them it happened by the hand of G-d, it happened because G-d was behind it; they experienced that G-d was with them in that moment; He made His presence felt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>I don't believe Yaakov's name is changed twice. In Genesis 32, Yaakov calls the place Peniel which means the face of God in a literal sense. He says for I saw Elohim face to face and yet my life was spared. He seems to be pretty clear that it was God he saw and wrestled with. Genesis 35 is simply repeating the same thing after repeating his encounter with God at Bethel which is written in Genesis 28. Hosea 12:3-6 also confirms this by first calling the one who wrestled with Jacob Elohim, then Mal-Ach meaning he appeared in a form of a man or angel in this case but then he confirms that it was the same Elohim or God who appeared to him at Bethel who is identified as YHWH in Genesis 28. Hosea himself also goes on and identifies him as YHWH.</p>\n\n\n",

(See, for example, almost all uses of <em>vayomer</em> and <em>vaydaber</em> in Torah.)  This is different from Modern Hebrew, where the subject is often placed before the verb.  (In fact, I've gotten funny looks when attempting to use the Biblical style in conversations.)</p>\n\n<p>מודה אני isn't unusual in this regard.  We also say מודים אנחנו לך, for example, and ברוך אתה in lots of places.  The prayers are, by and large, written in the style of Biblical (and rabbinic) Hebrew and preserved in that form.</p>\n\n<p>DonielF added the following in a comment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The idiom אני מודה, according to Sefaria’s search engine, appears 4 times across Gemara and Midrash (only one of them is in the Gemara), while מודה אני appears 30 times across the same sources, including a broader range of Midrashim, plus Tosefta and Avos d’Rebbi Nassan. So on the one hand, it’s not unheard of to use אני מודה, but on the other hand, it’s also significantly more common to use מודה אני.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I remember reading an article(maybe Aish.com?) that explained the reason for starting our day with the word \"modeh\" and <em>not</em> \"ani\": so that we don't start our day with \"ani\"/me but, rather, \"modeh\"/I am thankful. </p>\n\n<p>The reason is very deep that I think can sum up our destiny, based on how we approach life. If you start your day with \"ani\"/me, then your life depends on you(which could be a curse). But if you start your day with modeh, then you start it with gratitude(and humility).</p>\n\n<p>Too many times can we feel frustrated if things don't go our way. But why? Because we think it depends on \"ani\"/me. Emunah teaches us the opposite. Since HaShem is active in our lives and everything He does is for our best, then I am \"modeh\"/I am thankful. </p>\n\n<p>To further elaborate, a person who takes the approach of \"modeh\"/ I am thankful, has the path set towards olam haba because they submit to God's control and nullify themselves to the will of God. This is unlike the one who takes the approach of \"ani\"/me.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Monica's answer (and the supporting comments) is probably the correct one. I would just add that, otherwise, \"fronting\" a constituent is a means of emphasis.</p>\n\n<p>Biblical Hebrew is usually VSO (which means Verb Subject Object), so the verb should lead, and bringing the subject or object to the beginning is a way of emphasizing it. However, if the typical order for the present tense were to be to put the subject (ani) first, then the purpose would be to emphasize the gratitude.</p>\n\n<p>See here, in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=19oJcrBd57wC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=vso%20emphasis%20biblical%20hebrew&source=bl&ots=6CkEoENvs8&sig=e2zWhB2ONHKvIfyhNBiVpVEdxzM&hl=iw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwix24K7qvbdAhVBlosKHdYAD3UQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=vso%20emphasis%20biblical%20hebrew&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Modality and the Biblical Hebrew Infinitive Absolute</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/R8qgJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/R8qgJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

However, there is no direct source (i.e., one that specifically says, \"A man should not walk by a women's Mikvah.\") This is just a derivation of modesty and privacy. A woman attending the mikvah is meant to be absolutely private. If a man walks by a mikvah, he may recognize some woman going or leaving the place, and now, he knows private information about her menstrual / niddah schedule.</p>\n\n<p>I can personally vouch for this rule from what I recall when my wife went to the mikvah. Besides, a huge sign in front of the door requesting that men not pass the mikvah at night (I noticed this sign during the day, BTW,) they also requested that men drop off and pick up their wives around the corner from the mikvah. They didn't want you waiting in your car by the mikvah. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>DanF's answer is essentially true; a woman's Mikvah night is supposed to be as private as possible, and men walking by makes it less-private (as well as uncomfortable for the women involved).

    "content": "# Should people be encouraged to yield to the evil inclination?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Chazal say very clearly that the evil inclination is the foundation of great and good achievements:</p>\n\n<p>-Abaye said: The greater the man, the greater his evil inclination. [Sukkah 52a]</p>\n\n<p>-Nachman said, in Rav Shmuel's name: \"And, behold, it was very good\" [Gen 1:31] refers to the evil inclination. Can then the evil inclination be “very good”? That would be extraordinary!  Yes, [because] without the evil inclination, no man would build a house, take a wife, beget a family, and engage in work. So said [King] Solomon [in Ecclesiastes]: “And I saw that all labor and all achievement in work was the result of man's envy and rivalry with his neighbor.” (Eccl. 4:4] \n[Genesis Rabbah 9:7]</p>\n\n<p>-[Why does the Torah say:] You shall love the Lord your God with ALL your heart?  [Deut. 6:5].  With ALL your heart means with both your inclinations, the Evil Inclination as well as the Good Inclination. [Berachot 54a]</p>\n\n<p>Yet the rabbis always thunder against the evil inclination and urge us to work hard to defeat it at every turn.  Why, given it can be good?  You may say, \"Because the result would be an absolute  stampede!  People would say:  The rabbi said that it is OK to follow the evil inclination on occasion.  “On occasion” means once a week, right?  No, I think it means once every five days.  No, every three days.  Let’s go out and have some real fun tonight!\"  </p>\n\n<p>I am not convinced.  If you say an instinct is \"good\", then tell people to follow it.  But, you will say, people won't know when to stop.  The evil inclination is only good in very small dosage, like leaven in the dough. (Analogy in Berachot 17a)  Then keep the teaching hidden.  Why tell people something is good, then tell them to fight it?  Don't tell them anything at all!</p>\n\n<p>So:  Why does Chazal tell us to fight the evil inclination tooth and nail, then tell us it is the foundation of all achievement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is the difference between the nefesh habahamis/animal soul and the yetzer harah/evil inclination (yetzer being related to ציור/form).\nThe animal soul isn’t evil it’s simply animalistic, wants food, to procreate... all of these keep the world going. (As well anytime we try to improve ourselves it’s much easier to do it for human reasons rather than more lofty spiritual reasons) The evil inclination is when the basic desires take a form that is bad. So for example wanting food keeps you alive is normal and healthy and totally in line with Torah. Wanting a double bacon cheeseburger stems from the basic desire for food but takes a form which is against Torah.</p>\n<p>My source for this idea is from Tanya the end of chapter 2 and chapter 7. However this is my understanding of what he says, he doesn’t actually say this clearly.</p>\n<p>Also there are plenty of instances where desire for self glorification led to lasting benefits for society. For example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.10b.7?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 10b</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְחֶסֶד לְאֻמִּים חַטָּאת: וחסד לאומים חטאת כל צדקה וחסד שאומות עובדי כוכבים עושין חטא הוא להן שאינם עושין אלא להתגדל בו</p>\n<p>\"all the acts of charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is counted as a sin for them since they perform them only to elevate themselves in prestige\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(I think there is a Gemara that explicitly says that the Roman’s desire to be the best led them to build great infrastructure but I can’t find it) And I’m sure there are many modern examples of people’s desire for fame or money led them to create great things.</p>\n<p>So now based on this: sukkah 52a: I think could be read  as the greater one becomes, the greater the challenges Hashem gives.\nGenesis rabbah 9:7 is referring to the basic animal but allowed desires or referring to the evil inclination but that it led to good things for society. Berachos 54a refers to the animal soul that only does things out of pleasure but can be taught to love Hashem, because he is the most pleasurable/gives all good things.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>I will outline the answer according to the Lurianic tradition. The answer is Yes and No.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>As you surely know, we distinguish between two ways of Avodat Hashem - Yirah (fear) and Ahavah (love). They are both necessary in overall Jewish tradition, but there's a huge dispute which one is better or more desirable to Hashem (see Berochos 34). </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Yirah approach</strong> is all about \"minimizing the loss from sins\", and leads to staying away from sin as possible and gives rise to what we call a \"<strong>Tzadik</strong>\" - one who didn't sin in his life. This way was adopted by Yaakov (before he took the Berochos - איש תם יושב אהלים) or the Issachar's tribe (חמור גרם רובץ בין המשפתיים) or Ben Azzay and many more who stayed away from situations where one can slip into a sin (we call it Derech Eretz - marrying and working).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Ahavah approach</strong> is about \"maximizing the profit from Mitzvos\", and leads to a <em>possible</em> transgression in order to earn a greater Mitzvah (see the concepts of \"אתי עשה ודחי ללא תעשה\" - Yevomos 21a and \"זדונות הופכים לזכויות\" - Yumah 86b). For example, Yaakov after getting the Brochos went out to marry and to work. This level is called \"<strong>Kadosh</strong>\" - one who faced the Yetzer and overcame it. As I mentioned Berochos 34 say \"מקום שבעלי תשובה עומדים וכו'\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>NB: <em>The difference between the two approaches as stems from the Gemmorah is basically the essence of the Machloket between the Litvaks and Hassidishers (HaGr\"A and Baash\"T) approach to Avodat Hashem, where the former prefer the way of Tzaddikim and the later of the Kedoshim. That's, btw, exactly how they refer to their Gdoylim.</em></p>\n\n<p>To summarize the answer - <strong>there is an authentic Jewish approach of actively facing the Yetzer Harah by going out of the \"convenience zone\" to places where one is close to sinning</strong> (like one who works is much more prone to numerous transgressions, like Loshon Horoh, monetary misdeeds, anger, lust, etc than one who sits in the Yeshivah whole day) and <strong>further fighting the challenges and overcoming them and getting to the level of Kadosh</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

Or is the topic considered closed off until Mashiach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I think there are two aspects that turn this idea to truly impossible till the coming of the Messiah (and probably even later):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You probably underestimate <strong>the power of the Halachic tradition</strong>. There's no Ashkenazi Beyt Din (or other authority) that can possibly turn down the Psikah of Rem\"o in favor of the Mechaber. And vice verse. It is not only single Halochos (eating Kitnios on Pesach) but the whole method and tradition of Pesikah. That's why R' Ovadiah and R' Elyashiv Ztz\"L could not possibly sit in the same court.<br>\n.<br>\nThis is so serious, we can't make the Litvaks and the Hassidim to sit together, let alone Ashkenazi and Sefardi.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don't underestimate the <strong>[political and ] social power of every community authority</strong>. Nobody will willingly give up on their power and make one Rabanut (or one Beyt Din). That's a lot of money, jobs, influence etc. The tendency is exactly the opposite - to create as much divergence as possible to let as many families as possible to make their living (as King Dovid said \"לכו והתפרנסו זה מזה).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Bonus point: At least in Israel (it is less pronounced abroad) each community represents <strong>a completely different mentality</strong> (hierarchy of values) within the same Halachic compendium (they all keep Shu\"A in full). Just like intermarriages are almost non-existent because of this point, even if we could agree on the Halachah we couldn't bridge this problem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There's no real push either way.</p>\n<p>Firstly, there's no need. Each community's tradition, as long as it has a halachic basis, is valid and correct (This holds even in a case where two traditions are correct on a given matter would be a logical contradiction). Especially in the details—like whether a bracha should be Biblical Hebrew or Mishnaic Hebrew, or if the curtain of the Ark should be behind or in front of the door—the difference is entirely inconsequential.</p>\n<p>Second, there is indeed a concept that anything we are genuinely unsure of, or parts of some traditions that may be problematic, will be resolved at the coming of Mashiakh.</p>\n<p>Third, there are some things—very, very few, but still some—that are known problems even within certain traditions. However, the masses who are not educated on these matters are generally unaware of the need to change them. Even when they are aware, most are simply unwilling.</p>\n\n\n",

There are various opinions about who does it in this case; some say the <em>beit din</em> and some say the boy himself when he reaches <em>bar mitzvah</em>.

(They cite Shulchan Aruch YD 305:15, Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 164:8, and Yalkut Yosef Sova Semachot vol. 2 pg. 224.)

    "content": "# Why, in Yamim Noraim davening, do we discuss uprooting זדון instead of רעה?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a passage in the third bracha of Shemoneh Esrei said on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur (at least in Nusach Ashkenaz) that reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועלותה תקפץ פיה וכל הרשעה כלה כעשן תכלה כי תעביר ממשלת זדון מן הארץ</p>\n  \n  <p>And iniquity will close its mouth, and all wickedness will evaporate like smoke, when You remove evil’s domination from the earth. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above translation follows ArtScroll. Problem is, זדון doesn’t exactly mean “evil” - the word, from the same root as the term מזיד, more accurately refers to <em>intentional</em> sins, not just sins in general. </p>\n\n<p>If the intent of the paytan was as ArtScroll translates, why didn’t he use the phrase כי תעביר ממשלת <strong>רעה</strong>, which would indeed translate to “when You remove the dominion of evil”? And if his intention was different, then what was his intention behind this particular choice of phrase? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I would suggest to you that רעה does not exactly mean \"evil\" either.</p>\n<p>Consider:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בראשית יט, יט</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִנֵּה־נָ֠א מָצָ֨א עַבְדְּךָ֣ חֵן֮ בְּעֵינֶיךָ֒\nוַתַּגְדֵּ֣ל חַסְדְּךָ֗ אֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשִׂ֨יתָ֙ עִמָּדִ֔י לְהַחֲי֖וֹת\nאֶת־נַפְשִׁ֑י וְאָנֹכִ֗י לֹ֤א אוּכַל֙ לְהִמָּלֵ֣ט הָהָ֔רָה\nפֶּן־תִּדְבָּקַ֥נִי <strong>הָרָעָ֖ה</strong> וָמַֽתִּי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the level of פשט, Lot is not here concerned that a moral evil will \"attach itself\" to him, but that the catastrophe of the destruction of Sodom will encompass him.  The word \"רעה\" means \"catastrophe\" in this context.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בראשית לז, כ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעַתָּ֣ה ׀ לְכ֣וּ וְנַֽהַרְגֵ֗הוּ וְנַשְׁלִכֵ֨הוּ֙ בְּאַחַ֣ד\nהַבֹּר֔וֹת וְאָמַ֕רְנוּ חַיָּ֥ה <strong>רָעָ֖ה</strong> אֲכָלָ֑תְהוּ וְנִרְאֶ֕ה\nמַה־יִּהְי֖וּ חֲלֹמֹתָֽיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, the word \"רעה\" cannot mean evil, for an animal cannot be morally evil.  It must mean \"dangerous.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בראשית מד, כט</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּלְקַחְתֶּ֧ם גַּם־אֶת־זֶ֛ה מֵעִ֥ם פָּנַ֖י וְקָרָ֣הוּ אָס֑וֹן\nוְהֽוֹרַדְתֶּ֧ם אֶת־שֵׂיבָתִ֛י <strong>בְּרָעָ֖ה</strong> שְׁאֹֽלָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, \"moral evil\" seems a very difficult translation of this instance of the word \"רעה.\"  Yaakov fears that Binyomin will tragically die on the road, as did his mother Rivka and (so far as Yaakov knows) his older brother Yosef.  This would be tragedy, but not moral evil.  If the רעה referred to is the potential loss of Binyomin, רעה would seem to mean \"tragedy.\"  If it is Yaakov's state after the feared loss of Binyomin, then \"suffering\" would be a better translation.</p>\n<p>I suggest that the פיטן uses the word \"זדון\" in preference to \"רעה\" in order to avoid ambiguity.  He prays for the end of the rule of moral evil (or the end of the morally evil empire), not for the end of the rule of tragedy or suffering or misfortune.</p>\n<p>While זדון does not exactly mean \"evil,\" it is at least unambiguously in that ballpark.  And of course, if we understand it as an adjective rather than a noun (so \"the intentionally wicked kingdom,\" not \"the kingdom of intentional wickedness\"), then there is no problem at all with the term.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is a poetic phrase which refers to 3 types of sin for which we get <em>kapara</em> on Yom Kippur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>עון</strong> - ועלותה תקפץ פיה</li>\n<li><strong>חטא</strong> - וכל הרשעה כלה כעשן תכלה</li>\n<li><strong>פשע</strong> - כי תעביר ממשלת זדון מן הארץ</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>ממשלת</strong> זדון hints to שִׁעְבּוּד מַלְכֻיּוֹת which intentionlly causes Jewish people make sins that we would not make otherwise as R. Alexandri prayed <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 17a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After his prayer, Rabbi Alexandri said the following: May it be Your will, Lord our God, that You station us in a lighted corner and not in a darkened corner, and do not let our hearts become faint nor our eyes dim.  Some say that this was the prayer that Rav Hamnuna would recite, and that after Rabbi Alexandri prayed, he would say the following: <em>Master of the Universe, it is revealed and known before You that our will is to perform Your will, and what prevents us? On the one hand, the yeast in the dough, the evil inclination that is within every person; and the subjugation to the kingdoms on the other.</em> May it be Your will that You will deliver us from their hands, of both the evil inclination and the foreign kingdoms, so that we may return to perform the edicts of Your will with a perfect heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I\nmust tell you that I feel a deep personal hurt when people such as you\nmake such asinine ridiculous statements and then hide your abysmal\nignorance behind the facade of “Torah.” Don’t you realize that we can\nstill be believers and not live 500 years behind the times??</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then the Rebbe <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/2046989/jewish/Does-the-Sun-Really-Revolve-Around-the-Earth.htm#:%7E:text=One%20of%20the%20conclusions%20of,the%20sun%2C%20has%20equal%20validity.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a> back</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the Grace of G‑d Rosh Chodesh Kislev, 5736 [November 5, 1975]\nBrooklyn, N.Y.</p>\n<p>Greeting and Blessing:</p>\n<p>This is in reply to your inquiry on the question of the rotation of\nthe sun and the earth in relation to each other, namely, whether the\nsun revolves around the earth, or the earth around the sun, and which\nview is to be accepted, etc.</p>\n<p>I presume you have in mind the scientific view, i.e., what science has\nto say on this question, and I will address myself to this aspect.</p>\n<p>It is well known that this was a controversial issue in ancient and\nmedieval science. However, since about half a century ago, with the\nintroduction of the theory of relativity, the latter has been\nuniversally accepted as the basis of modern science. To be sure, in\nthe beginning there were scientists working under the Soviet regime\nwho opposed the relativity theory—for various reasons which need not\nbe reviewed here—but even this opposition fell by the wayside later,\nso that now all scientists generally accept the theory of relativity\nas the latest and most plausible scientific system.</p>\n<p>One of the conclusions of the theory of relativity is that when there\nare two systems, or planets, in motion relative to each other—such as\nthe sun and earth in our case—either view, namely, the sun rotating\naround the earth, or the earth rotating around the sun, has equal\nvalidity. Thus, if there are phenomena that cannot be adequately\nexplained on the basis of one of these views, such difficulties have\ntheir counterpart also if the opposite view is accepted.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the scientific conclusion that both views have equal\nvalidity is the result not of any inadequacy of available scientific\ndata, or of technological development (measuring instruments, etc.),\nin which case it could be expected that further scientific and\ntechnological advancement might clear up the matter eventually and\ndecide in favor of one or the other view. On the contrary, the\nconclusion of contemporary science is that regardless of any future\nscientific advancement, the question as to which is our planetary\ncenter, the sun or the earth, must forever remain unresolved, since\nboth views will always have the same scientific validity, as stated.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, it follows that anyone declaring that a person who chooses to\naccept one of these systems in preference to the other is a fool,\nwhile one who accepts the other is a wise man—such a judgment shows\nthat the person making it is ignorant of the conclusions of modern\nscience, or that he has not advanced beyond the science of Ptolemy and\nCopernicus. Obviously, a person not versed in the development of\nscience in the course of the past half-century or so is not qualified\nto make any judgment pertaining to science.</p>\n<p>A further point may be added, though perhaps not directly pertinent to\nour discussion. It is that every person, including modern scientists,\nactually has three options to choose from in this matter: (a) that A\nrevolves around B, (b) that B revolves around A, (c) that A and B\nrevolve around each other. But such a choice cannot be dictated by\nscience; it would be one’s personal choice and belief.</p>\n<p>What has been said above is—to repeat—the deduction of the theory of\nrelativity, as it is expounded in various scientific texts, and it can\nbe checked with any scientist who is thoroughly familiar with the said\ntheory. Of course, on the elementary and high school level, science in\ngeneral, and the so-called Solar System in particular, is taught from\nrelatively simple textbooks, and the change in the scientific attitude\ntowards the subject under discussion is not emphasized. But, as\nstated, it would be quite simple to verify it with any scientist who\nknows this particular field.</p>\n<p>With esteem and blessing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this response alone, one may mistakenly think that the rebbe is making some kind of compromise of the view regarding the sun rotating around the earth, maybe implying that both are revolving around each other, or that no one can ever know etc.</p>\n<p>This mistaken notion can be easily dispelled by the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/2046992/jewish/Does-the-Sun-Really-Revolve-Around-the-Earth-II.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">second</a> part of the response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By the Grace of G‑d Rosh Chodesh Kislev, 5736 [November 5, 1975]\nBrooklyn, N.Y.</p>\n<p>Greeting and Blessing:</p>\n<p>In reply to your question relating to the matter of the motion of the\nsun and the earth, whether the sun revolves around the earth or the\nearth around the sun.</p>\n<p><strong>It is my firm belief that the sun revolves around the earth</strong>, as I have also declared publicly on various occasions and in discussion\nwith professors specializing in this field of science</p>\n<p>In view of the above, I have no objection, of course, if you wish to\nmake this view known to whomever you choose, since, as mentioned, I\nhave declared it orally and in writing to correspondents who had\ninquired into this subject, on more than one occasion.</p>\n<p>With esteem and blessing,</p>\n<p>P.S. On several of the above-mentioned occasions, when I spoke on the\nsubject publicly, I gave a clear and detailed explanation why this\nview is in no conflict at all with contemporary science. I emphasized,\nhowever, that I was speaking of modern and contemporary science, as it\ndiffers from Ptolemaic and medieval science when conflicting views\nwere held on this subject. Modern science, on the other hand, having\nrejected both systems, has reached conclusions which present no\nproblem to one holding to the belief that the sun revolves around the\nearth, as I have explained at some length elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

They parted amicably and wanted to be able to have relationships (no marriage, of course) without feeling they were committing adultery.  I don't know how it ended.  Would a rabbi accept to give a religious divorce without a civil one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<h2>דבר הכורת בינו לבינה</h2>\n\n<p>The first issue is derived from the passuk, which describes a get as a ספר כריתות, a “book of separation.” To that end, Chazal derive that a get must completely separate between them. A classic example of this is that a get given on condition must have an “end date” for the condition; a man can give a get on condition that his wife not drink wine <em>during the next 30 days</em>, but he cannot give it on condition that his wife not drink wine <em>ever</em> (Gittin 21a, etc.). A nice summary of these halachos can be found in Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer 137. </p>\n\n<p>The issue here is whether civil marriage is still considered a “connection” between them, that in order for them to be divorced halachically, they must be divorced legally as well. Or, more precisely, must any connections between them besides their original Kiddushin/Nisuin be broken as well, in order that the get be valid?</p>\n\n<p>As this isn’t a point I’m 100% clear on, and to that end I’ve <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/95977/9682\">asked</a> about it separately. Starting with the presumption that civil marriage has no halachic marital value (a presumption that I will challenge shortly), it should be no different than, say, a business contract, and, as such, whatever the answer is to the linked question will be the answer to this point. If a get is not binding without all ties being cut, then there’s your answer, but if it is binding, then this point is irrelevant and we can move onto the other problems. (I’ll update this paragraph to be more complete when I get a clear answer to this question.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>שלחה ואינה חוזרת</h2>\n\n<p>In your particular example there’s another issue which may arise. The Halacha is that the husband must, you know, actually send away his wife. To this end, the husband must not only be the one doing the divorcing, but even the wording of the get must make clear that he’s sending her away, rather than removing himself from her (Kiddushin 5b-6a). Likewise, if the wife doesn’t have full mental capabilities and can’t process that she’s actually being divorced, this would prevent the get from working (Yevamos 113b. Note that this Halacha holds true only on a Rabbinic level if she understands that she’s being divorced but still isn’t in full mental capabilities; they instituted this in order that she not be abused). </p>\n\n<p>So in your case, where they still retain civil marriage because they “wanted to be able to have relationships,” they must be absolutely clear that they understand your parenthetical comment as well - as far as Halacha is concerned, they are divorced. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>דינא דמלכותא דינא</h2>\n\n<p>Here’s the fun part. This entire time I presumed that civil marriage didn’t mean anything halachically, that it was just a formality to appease secular law. Is this actually correct?</p>\n\n<p>There is a concept called dina d’malchusa dina, “the law of the kingdom is the law” (henceforth abbreviated DD). How far do we take this? The various opinions, in no particular order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Rashbam (BB 54b, “v’ha’amar Shmuel”) is of the opinion that DD applies to taxes, etc., that everyone accepts upon themselves. </li>\n<li>The Ran (Nedarim 28a, “b’muchseh ha’omed me’eilav”) and the Rambam (Hil. Gezeilah VaAveidah 5:11) hold that DD applies to anything instituted by a non-Jewish government. Since all Jews share a portion of Jewish-controlled Eretz Yisrael, a Jewish monarch can’t threaten to expel a Jew if he doesn’t obey, while in any other country, that is perfectly legal. </li>\n<li>Rabbeinu Kerashkash (Gittin 10b, “v’ha d’amrinan dina d’malchusa dina,” often misprinted as the Ritva) learns that anything which is within the king’s power to impose (taking דינא דמלכותא to mean “the law placed on the king”) is binding (דינא), and if the king does something extralegally (what he terms חמסנא דמלכא), it is not binding. It seems that this is the opinion of the Shulchan Aruch (CM 369:8) as well. </li>\n<li>The Rashba (Gittin 10b, “v’i’ba’is eima”) places no restrictions on this. Anything which the government demands is law. The Rema’s personal opinion (CM 369:8) is this way as well. </li>\n<li>The Rosh (Nedarim 3:11) rules that DD applies only to taxes and property law.</li>\n<li>The Sma (CM 369:12) says that ultimately he is there at the pleasure of the king, but he can do whatever he wants in his own, private domain. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It would seem that according to everyone except for the Rosh, DD would extend to the realm of marriage as well. While obviously this requires one to get a civil divorce before remarrying in a country like the US which outlaws polygamy, how does this impact giving a get? </p>\n\n<p>Now, there’s no law that <em>directly</em> impacts giving a get; as far as I’m aware no country has the law that not only must a couple get a civil divorce but also stipulates that the religious divorce does not work unless they are also civilly divorced. Even if such a country existed, DD can’t override a Torah law. </p>\n\n<p>But it might be able to, indirectly. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>דברים שבלב</h2>\n\n<p>Not that this would apply in your case, but let’s say that a couple divorces halachically and the woman remarries halachically, and they remain civilly married throughout the whole case. Can the husband claim that he “obviously” didn’t intend for them to be fully divorced until the civil divorce went through?</p>\n\n<p>The general rule is that any stipulations that a person has in mind are only binding if they are said explicitly (Kiddushin 49b). As such, unless he explicitly states this, it would seem that this is not a valid claim. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Gemara (50a) has the following to say on the topic. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara attempts to prove this concept, that words left unsaid don’t count, from the fact that we can force a person who swore to bring a Karban and refuses to do so to say that he wants to bring it, and this is a fulfillment of לרצונו - that it be brought willingly. Why don’t we say that in his heart he still doesn’t want to? We see from here that unsaid words don’t count. </p>\n\n<p>But wait a second - maybe words in the heart <em>do</em> count, but since we know that he wants to achieve atonement, <em>that’s</em> what he truly wants! So we can’t prove anything from here. The Gemara then turns to other potential proofs before finally concluding that unsaid words really don’t count. </p>\n\n<p>What <em>we</em> can prove, however, is that if it’s clear to us what he wants, he doesn’t have to say it explicitly. This is indeed the position of the Rema (CM 207:4). As such, perhaps one can argue that “I’m a law-abiding citizen, and of course I wouldn’t have divorced you without giving you a civil divorce as well!” </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>בקיצור</h2>\n\n<p>It would seem that there are several potential issues, but that most of them are not actually issues. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A man must completely separate from his wife</strong> - I’m unclear whether this is applicable. To be updated IYH. </li>\n<li><strong>A man must actually send away his wife</strong> - not actually an issue, but something to potentially be concerned for</li>\n<li><strong>One must abide by the law of the land</strong> - while most opinions hold that this extends to marriage, it can’t override a Biblical law. </li>\n<li><strong>Things left unsaid usually don’t matter</strong> - but perhaps, according to the Rema, one would get away with claiming that he didn’t want to divorce until he gave a civil divorce. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Final note: This was actually a fun problem to tackle, and thank you for forcing me to review Maseches Gittin tonight.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In theory, sure, why not? Generally today a beis din will first handle the Get, and then if the couple agrees to use them, hear the case of how to split their assets -- so a Get may not be the absolute last step before these people have truly severed <em>all</em> bonds.</p>\n<p>(The Beth Din of America will, however, not perform a Gett for a couple still living in the same house. So the typical order is: separate -> Gett -> [hopefully settle all disputes, either  through beis din or mediation] -> civil divorce.)</p>\n<p>The Get can often be faster; some states require that the couple be living in different houses for a year before a civil divorce can be granted. In some circumstances the Beis Din will be satisfied that divorce is the best option well before that whole year.</p>\n<p>In fact, New York's \"Get Law #1\" (which was endorsed by R' Moshe Feinstein zt'l) requires that <em>before</em> a couple obtains a civil divorce, they have to sign an affidavit stating that there are no moral obstacles in the way of the other party getting remarried. (I.e., they already did the Gett.)</p>\n<p>There was some story where they got a halachic Get before a civil divorce, and a few months later the ex-husband turned around and got a halachic (but not civil) wedding, which bothered the ex-wife. My understanding at this point is that if the Beth Din of America will do the Get before the civil divorce, but wait to release a document certifying it until after the civil divorce is done -- if either party requests it that way. (That way both sides will wait to remarry -- through whatever system -- until the civil paperwork is done.) If both sides are fine with the rabbinic certification now, I think they do release it.</p>\n\n\n",

Conrad L'Heureux theorizes in \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1509224\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Ugaritic and Biblical Rephaim</a>\", that the Ugaritic Refaim refer to a class of chariot mounted warriors, that were apparently a rarity at the time. He goes on to hypothesize that the memory of these warriors is reflected in the collective memory as brought down by the biblical authors:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since these refaim consisted of kings and nobles who fought from horse-\ndrawn chariots, it is only natural that they were remembered as\nbeing gigantic in stature — a view which might have been reinforced by speculations on the origins of megalithic structures. The biblical traditions would only have gone off the track when the socio—military category was erroneously thought to represent an ethnic group. Moreover, if we have correctly understood the development, it is altogether possible that the statement that Og, King of Bashan, was among the last of the refaim is historically correct. This item of traditional lore, along with other similar memories which have not been preserved, probably stands at the very beginning of the development which led to the understanding of refaim as an ethnic term.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If that theory is correct, the authors of the books were referring to an old an exaggerated memory of real humans, rather than a metaphor.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, regarding כתבינו, the simple form is כֹּתב, ending with a soft ב. Therefore, when the word is changed into a more complex form, the ב remains soft, even though there's a vowelless consonant directly before it.</p>\n<p>This rule is always applicable. For example, the word בְּכׇל\nhas a soft כ. Thus, the word וּבְכׇל (with an added vav before it) retains that soft כ, even though it's directly preceded by a silent shva.</p>\n<p>For the historical reason for this rule, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/149263/32959\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Children of the Exodus (families, names, ages)",
    "content": "# Children of the Exodus (families, names, ages)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I hope my question will not be considered too broad.  I am writing young adult fiction taking place during the Exodus (from just before the 10th plague until just after the giving of the second set of tablets).  To do this, I have to fill in the spaces, mainly adding in women that Torah/etc does not mention (but that are of course present), as well as children.  I will make up names/etc as needed but I want a story true to Jewish sources.  I follow what’s in Torah first, then other parts of the Bible, then I consider (but don’t always use) various commentaries, Midrash, and so forth.  </p>\n\n<p>Looking at our core family, timed to the beginning of the Exodus…</p>\n\n<p>Jochebed is present (and quite elderly) but her husband Amram has passed (some commentaries say he’s alive but I think it could go either way).</p>\n\n<p>Moses: We know he has two sons by his wife Zipporah, Gershom and Eliezer (the 3 of them will not join the story until (just before?) Mt. Sinai).  I assume they are small children because they fit with their mother on a single donkey.  They also do not have tasks in those first couple of years.  We know they later grow up, marry, and have at least one child each.  I’m going to put them at about ages 2 and 6.  I’m assuming there are no daughters because, though daughters generally get left out of the narrative, it would be really odd if they weren’t mentioned on the initial trip from Midian or when Zipporah’s father came to meet Moses.  (Although my story ends before it is relevant, I am going with the view that Zipporah is the Cushite woman and Moses only married once.)</p>\n\n<p>Miriam: Tanach does not mention a spouse or children but traditionally Caleb is said to be her husband (and we know his ancestors and descendants).  This makes Hur Miriam’s son.  Again, no mention of daughters and I’m going to just give her the one child.  Hur has 4 sons, Uri, Shobal, Salma, Hareph, and an unknown number of daughters.  Hareph has a son Beth-gader and Shobal has a son Kirjathjearim.  Then Uri has a son Bezalel, who is the master craftsman for the building projects of the second year.  There is commentary that says Bezalel is an extremely gifted child when given the task, so I’m going to make him 12 at the start.  I will add in daughters for Hur and his children, as well as spouses for all adults with children.  Bezalel will have multiple child cousins.</p>\n\n<p>Aaron: We know Aaron has 4 sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.  Initially, only the two older sons are in training to become priests but the younger two take over after their brothers' deaths.  Torah is clear that Nadab and Abihu had no children, which to me means they were young (say, 20 and 22) and not yet married.  Their younger brothers must be teens.  Torah states, more than once at the end of the 40 years in the wilderness, that only men who were under the age of 20 during the first census will be allowed to enter Canaan, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua.  Eleazer (then high priest) is there though, which means he must have been under 20 during the first census and under 19 at the start of Exodus.  Ithamar would be even younger.  I will probably make them 11 and 14, or something around there.  So their wives and children happen long after my story ends.</p>\n\n<p>Aaron also has daughters (thank you Mi Yodeya for laying this out in an older question), but we don’t know their names, how many, or their ages relative to their brothers.  I have created 3 daughters, two older than the boys, married with kids, and one born in the middle of the boys and newly married with maybe one child.  I used names of (lesser known) Jewish women in Tanach but not from the Exodus.  Two husbands I made up but one daughter I have married to Zithri, her father’s first cousin (birth orders in the genealogy make it likely that they’d be the same age).  These 3 daughters will have children ages 0 to maybe 7 or 8 years.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: Have I missed anything in outlining the descendants of the three children of Jochebed and Amram?  Are there any names (or other information) for children or spouses beyond what I have?  Are any of my assumptions impossible?  Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Jochebed: I don't remember ever seeing a source whether she was alive or not.  Based on the Midrash she would have been 210; even following the Ibn Ezra and others she had to be at least 100.  But there were miracles all over the place.</p>\n\n<p>Amram: The Midrash, quoted by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Exodus.3.6.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>, says he had died, I guess this is where you're coming from.  As you said, you can go either way here.</p>\n\n<p>About the men under 20: based on the Midrash, the tribe of Levi was excluded.  And this is important because <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.6.25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Elazar was married and had a child, Pinchas</a>.  (Although I guess he could have been 18 or something.)</p>\n\n<p>I've always speculated that Itamar had daughters.  Evidence: the Midrash interprets \"they didn't have children\" as a criticism of Nadav and Avihu, implying that their brothers did.  He most likely didn't have sons yet because Pinchas according to one opinion didn't become a Kohen with his grandfather, father, and uncles because he was already born and not explicitly included in the instructions, and only became one later by a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.25.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">special decree</a> from G-d.  There's no mention of this weird status held by anybody else.  So that leaves daughters.  It's not watertight by any stretch.  This is all only talking about that time.  We <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.24.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">know</a> he had sons later.</p>\n\n<p>I assume you have Moses and Aaron's ages right, because they're explicit in the verses, but also be careful to keep track of Caleb's age.  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.14.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He was 40</a> at the time of the spies, so 38 or 39 at the time of the Exodus.  He, Chur, and Uri had kids at VERY young ages.</p>\n\n<p>Miriam was much older than he was.  The number in my head is 85 but I don't remember the precise source.  In any case 85 is a lower bound, because younger than 5 is not so plausible for speaking to the princess who found Moses.</p>\n\n<p>Beth-gader and Kirjathjearim are places, not people.  \"Father\" of a place means the leader of that place, which is not relevant to your story because the places are in Israel and they only became leaders later on.</p>\n\n<p>You haven't mentioned Aaron's wife's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.6.23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">name and family</a>.  They <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.1.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">were</a> prominent <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth.4.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">people</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Initially, only the two older sons are in training to become priests but the younger two take over after their brothers' deaths.\" - this is partly right.  Nadav and Avihu did have a more prominent role (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.24.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">example</a>) and it seems that the younger brothers were more on the logistics side (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.38.21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">example</a>, note that he <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.4.28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kept</a> this role later).  But <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.28.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">all four of them</a> were training to become priests from the start</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you want to include more unusual and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/86967/11532\">controversial</a> Midrashim, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Targum_Jonathan_on_Numbers.11.26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eldad and Meidad may have been Moses's half brothers</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Inconsiderate gentile neighbor listening to loud music on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Suppose an inconsiderate gentile neighbor were listening to music at a fairly high volume on Shabbat, to the point that you could hear it on your own property. Would one be permitted to:</p>\n\n<p>A) directly ask the neighbor to turn the music down (or would this be a forbidden form of requesting melacha for one's own benefit?)</p>\n\n<p>Or </p>\n\n<p>B) enjoy a song which one happened to like when it came on (assuming the gentile is listening for his own pleasure and there is no input whatsoever from the Jewish neighbor regarding the whether music will be played at all, let alone the playlist)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Amira Liakum (asking a non jew to do a melacha)is only prohibited in two types of cases.</p>\n\n<p>1) Where you get a positive benefits and he did it for you. By positive I mean If it's causing a new source of pleasure (he turned on the TV) that would be assur. But taking a way a source of discomfort is not considered a benefit here. </p>\n\n<p>2)You asked him to do the melacha even if you don't benefot at all. \n(source: 39 melachos book. I don't remember it's source.) </p>\n\n<p>So since you asked him at first glance this is assur. However if one holds electricity is assur because of Molid (Like rabbi henkin and therefore is Drabbunun), when you ask a non jew (which is assur drabbunun) to do a Drabbunun it is whats called a shvus dshvus and is permitted for a sick person, a mitzvah, or a \"great need\" (Source 39 melachos book and Rambam. And yes \"great need\" is very vague). So in this case the person should especially ask their rabbi whether this is considered a \"great need\" or even a \"sick person\". If one holds electricity is assur Draaysa then no you can't ask. You could send a child over to ask I think or hint to him.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to listening to music, you didn't ask him to turn it on and he did it for himself so it's not assur from Amira Lakum. Seemingly this would be no different than if you left music on from before shabbos and bring up questions of Uvdin dchol. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The original prohibition of Amirah leNochri is an \"extension\" to preventing oneself from doing a Melachah. As in your case, there's no fear of one actively doing a Melacha in his neighbor's house, therefore it is permitted to ask a Nochri to do something in his house. </p></li>\n<li><p>If you still fear that it could be an extension of Amirah leNochri, you can knock on his door and talk to him quietly, saying \"I can't hear you!\" to force him to lower the volume to himself and further asking not to make it louder.</p></li>\n<li><p>Alternatively, an underage kid can be sent over to ask.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>B. Enjoying a song that you hear anyway is surely permitted, as long as there're no secondary prohibitions, like מראית עין (if you get closer on purpose, or enter his house, or dance) or עובדין דחול (that can make you think it's a weekday and you'll come to change the track or the like).</p>\n\n\n",

First is <em>reducing himself</em>, which is the concept of humility as Rashi mentions. But it also mentions minimizing <em>his involvement</em> (מַקְטִין אֶת עֲסָקָיו) with this world, meaning business pursuits and increasing ones involvement in learning Torah and serving G-d.</p>\n\n<p>This is clarified by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tanna_debei_Eliyahu_Zuta%2C_Additions_to_Seder_Eliyahu_Zuta%2C_Pirkei_Derech_Eretz.2?vhe=Tanna_deBei_Eliyahu_Zuta&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanna D'vei Eliyahu Zuta</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>רבי אליעזר אומר כל העוסק בתורה לשמה זוכה לדברים הרבה ולא עוד אלא</strong> שכל העולם כולו כדאי הוא לו נקרא ריע אהוב אוהב את המקום אוהב את הבריות משמח את המקום משמח את הבריות <strong>ומלבשתו ענוה</strong> ויראה ומכשרתו להיות צדיק וחסיד וישר ונאמן ומרחקתו מן החטא ומביאתו לידי זכות ונהנין ממנו עצה ותושיה בינה וגבורה שנאמר (משלי ח׳:י״ד) לי עצה ותושיה אני בינה לי גבורה <strong>ונותנת לו מלכות וממשלה</strong> וחקור דין ומגלין לו סודות מן השמים ורזי תורה <strong>ונעשה כמעין המתגבר והולך וכנהר שאינו פוסק והוה צנוע וארך רוח ומוחל על עלבונו ומגדלתו ומרוממתו על כל המעשים.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As pointed out in Bereshit Rabbah, this set up the paradigm for how Yaacov Avinu (the younger of the two brothers in comparison to Esav) and Ephraim, the younger brother of Menasheh received the blessing of Bechorah. Yaacov also had 12 sons establishing the 12 tribes (and ultimately will have the 13th tribe during the final redemption, like Yoktan).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em><a href=\"http://%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9%20%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%B4%D7%93%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פירוש מרי״ד על התורה</a></em> says:  (translation: coming soon) </p>\n\n<p>In essence, that through acquiring the trait of true humbleness (ענוה) one will merit to many children.

The Raavad disagrees because an accurate translation is\n  impossible.</p>\n  \n  <p>2] המשנה ברורה (סימן סב, ס”ק ג) פוסק שיש להימנע מקריאת שמע בשאר לשונות\n  בזמן הזה, ומעורר שמא אין לקרוא בלעז בזמן הזה מעיקר הדין: “ועיין בספרי\n  האחרונים דבימינו אף מצד הדין יש ליזהר שלא לקרותה בלשון אחר, כי אם\n  בלשון הקודש, כי יש כמה וכמה תיבות שאין אנו יודעים איך להעתיקם היטב,\n  כגון תיבת ושננתם יש בו כמה ביאורים, אחד לשון לימוד ואחד לשון חידוד,\n  כמו שאמרו חז”ל ‘שיהו ד”ת מחודדין בפיך, שאם ישאלך אדם דבר אל תגמגם\n  ותאמר לו’. וכן כמה וכמה תיבות שבקריאת שמע שאין אנו יודעין היטב ביאורו\n  על לשון אחר, כגון תיבת ‘את’ ותיבת ‘לטוטפות’, וכדומה”. </p>\n  \n  <p>2] Mishnah Berurah advises against reciting shema other than in\n  Hebrew. There are words in it with mutiple translations and words\n  without a definite translation.</p>\n  \n  <p>3] From the Yerushalmi, some bring the law that if one can read the\n  shema in Hebrew one will not perform the mitzvah if it is done in any\n  other language.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Did the Egyptians destroy them after the exodus? Perhaps there isn't any because this would be in violation of the Decalogue: “Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of likeness”?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>When discussing Biblical Archeology, there are those who try and look at the issues with a \"minimalist\" view. Usually, they assume that we have a vast knowledge of ancient Egypt and have found much of the artifacts etc. Therefore they ask: </p>\n\n<p>\"If X is true, why don't we find Y artifacts?\"</p>\n\n<p>However, this is called in logical terms an \"Argument from Silence\". An argument from silence is usually a very weak attempt at proving anything because it bases itself upon what we did not find as opposed to what we did find.</p>\n\n<p>Example: </p>\n\n<p>Regular Argument: We found a pyramid with Pharoah Tutnik's name engraved in the burial chamber. Therefore, this must be the grave of Tutnik and he did exist!</p>\n\n<p>Argument from Silence: We have been digging here for days and we did not find any tombs with Pharoah Tutnik's name. Therefore he did not exist!</p>\n\n<p>The second argument is very weak.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Keep digging. :)</li>\n<li>Tutnik was an unpopular king, so he didn't rate a fancy tomb.</li>\n<li>Tutnik believed in a different Egyptian diety that asked its followers to be cremated and scattered upon the Nile.</li>\n<li>Tutnik's throne name on the 3d tomb over there is engraved \"Zorba of Upper and Lower Egypt\" but we didn't have enough evidence to connect Zorba with Tutnik as one and the same guy.</li>\n<li>Tutnik died in a foreign war.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Etc. Etc.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the idea that we are in possession of all the artifacts of Egypt by now is just not true. Archeology is only about 200 years old if that. The amount of things found is directly related to the great sums of money granted by the rich and governments to fund expeditions as well as the extreme amounts of time it takes to uncover things safely and to know where to look. </p>\n\n<p>There is a lot more of Egypt to discover which makes any argument from silence neutral and weak at best.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, regarding Moses, the Torah says that \"Prince\" Moses fled Egypt after killing the Egyptian taskmaster. The Medrash even says that the current Pharoah at the time tried to execute Moses for the killing. </p>\n\n<p>He went from Prince to Outlaw. (Remember, the king knew he was adopted, not blood.) So, why would a ruling king want to make a monument to an escaped con? This is especially true when many kings at the time feared their own children and relatives as potential usurpers to the throne. How much more so to fear an adopted prince might claim legitimacy against his royal brother who would be the rightful heir? You don't make tribute statues to such people if you know what's good for you. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hypothetical Halacha -- Is \"Leishayv Basukkah\" an interruption of a brocha on Shmini Ateres (if said by mistake)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This case happened to me over the past Shemini Atzeres, and even though it's over now, I was still curious about the halacha.</p>\n\n<p>I was so used to saying Laysheiv Basukkah the entire Sukkos, so on the first meal of Shemini Atzeres (which is in the Sukkah according to Chabad custom) I started saying the brocho Leishayv Basukkah after Hamotzei, then stopped in the middle and immediately ate the bread, as not to cause further interruption (so I thought).</p>\n\n<p>But I was wondering: would I have had to theoretically make another brocho hamotzei over the bread, since maybe that was considered an interruption, or since my mind wasn't diverted from the food, since I was used to saying the brocho, it wasn't considered an interruption?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While I'm not sure about this specific case, similar cases are brought up in the rishonim. Specifically, the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim 211:15) says that if one speaks between making kiddush and drinking, he should make another <em>Hagefen</em>, but not make kiddush again. The Magen Avraham says there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתוב בפסקי מהרא\"י אם קידש על מים וסבר שהוא יין יחזור ויקדש אף על גב דקידוש על היין דרבנן גם במילי דרבנן צריך לחזור עכ\"ל ואם היה דעתו לשתות יין יותר א\"צ לברך שנית בפה\"ג כמ\"ש ססי' ר\"ט.</p>\n<p>It says in the rulings of the Maharai \"if one made kiddush on water thinking it was wine, he must repeat kiddush,even though kiddush on wine is derabanan, even by things that're derabanan he must repeat them\". And if he had in mind to drink wine, he no longer needs to make another b'racha of hagefen, as it says at the end of siman 209.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, Rabbi Akiva Eiger (there) disagrees, and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מג\"א ס\"ק ל\"ב: א\"צ לברך שנית בפה\"ג. לענ\"ד כיון דנוסח הקידוש שאמר על הכוס של מים לא הוי קידוש זהו הוי הפסק בין ברכת בפה\"ג לשתיית יין אחר</p>\n<p>Magen Avraham 32 said: \"he need not say Hagefen again\". I think that since the language of the kiddush he said on the cup of water is not kiddush, this is a hefsek between the (previous) hagefen and the drinking of other wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15096&st=&pgnum=170\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">minchas Shlomo (RSZA) 1:18</a> brings this argument and holds like the Magen Avraham, explaining that the problem with a hefsek is distracting oneself from the purpose of the original b'racha. That's why asking for salt - even if there's salt on the table - is not a hefsek, because he thought he needed the salt in order to eat, and he wasn't distracted from eating (even though objectively, the words were unnecessary, since he wasn't distracted, it's still not a hefsek).</p>\n<p>However, he goes on to say that this is only true for something that is normal to have before the meal/ mitzva, like accidentally saying the b'racha on fire during havdala of yom Tov, or accidentally counting the wrong day of the Omer. But by other cases, this wouldn't be true. For example, if someone swore to say a certain passuk before eating and only remembered after saying the b'racha, or if one remembered after saying a b'racha that he hadn't prayed yet (and therefore isn't allowed to eat), saying the passuk/ praying would be a hefsek, because \"the passuk in and of itself has no relation to the eating...\" (My direct translation of his words)</p>\n<p>So, in short, RSZA says that if one says something objectively unnecessary, but something that he thought was necessary, as long as what he said is (theoretically) inherently related to the meal, this would not constitute a hefsek, and he wouldn't make another b'racha, so too for the case of an accidental \"leisheiv\".</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For further research, see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?sits=1&req=20947&st=%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%A6%D7%A8&_rnd=0.8685785260770209\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Har Tzvi (at the end of siman 194)</a> who might argue with this minchas Shlomo</p>\n\n\n",

The Christian concept of sin revolves\n  around the fall of the man and the \"original sin.\" Does Judaism view\n  it the same way?</p>\n  \n  <p>The Aish Rabbi Replies:</p>\n  \n  <p>Adam and Eve were punished according to their actions. In other words,\n  God laid down the conditions for Adam and Eve to live in the garden,\n  provided they would not eat from the Tree of Knowledge. However, if\n  they were to eat from that tree they would be punished by experiencing\n  death. (If they had not eaten from the tree, they would have remained\n  immortal.)</p>\n  \n  <p>This sets down the basic principle in Judaism of Reward and\n  Punishment. Basic to this is that every person has the choice of doing\n  good or bad. When a person chooses \"good\" – as defined by God – he is\n  able to draw close to God. In other words, every individual has a\n  chance to \"gain salvation\" through his own actions.</p>\n  \n  <p>My understanding of Christianity, however, is that the Original Sin\n  has infected all of mankind to the point where individuals are\n  incapable of achieving salvation through their own initiative. Man is\n  \"totally depraved\" and therefore his only hope of salvation is through\n  the cross.</p>\n  \n  <p>This belief is contrary to the teachings of Judaism. From the Torah\n  perspective, an individual does not need to rely on anyone else to\n  atone for them. In Judaism, sins can be \"erased\" altogether by sincere\n  repentance and a firm resolution never to repeat the mistakes.</p>\n  \n  <p>For more on this, read \"Their Hollow Inheritances\" by Michael Drazin –\n  www.drazin.com</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The conclusion is clear: we are not born with any original sin.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is no concept of \"Original Sin\" in Judaism. This does not mean that humans do not have a sinful nature (cf. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16272/jewish/Chapter-51.htm#v=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 51:7</a>), rather it means that we are capable of overcoming our evil inclination and attain righteousness, without the aid of an intermediary.</p>\n\n<p>From what I understand, Xianity teaches that humans all fall short in the eyes of G-d, tainted by the \"original sin\" of Adam and Eve, and are unable of achieving salvation by themselves, so Yoshke died to take away the sins of anyone who believes in him. </p>\n\n<p>However, it's interesting to note that after Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden, G-d tells their son, Cain, that it is possible to overcome one's evil urge:</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8168/jewish/Chapter-4.htm#v=6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 4:6-7</a>,  emphasis mine)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the Lord said to Cain, \"Why are you annoyed, and why has your countenance fallen? <strong>Is it not so that if you improve, it will be forgiven you?</strong> If you do not improve, however, at the entrance, sin is lying, and to you is its longing, <strong>but you can rule over it</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the sense that all individuals start with a \"black mark\" on their ledger, there is no original sin.</p>\n\n<p>However, God judges people in a manner that we would consider subjective (though is actually objective due to his omniscience) and the circumstances of one's birth will alter the relative values of sins and good deeds. For example, an Indian, raised in a sea of a billion Hindus, worshiping idols will be treated more leniently than a Jew raised in suburban New Jersey who decides to rebel against his parents and Jewish Day School upbringing by worshiping idols.</p>\n\n<p>The actions of Adam and Eve had consequences, but consequences are not the same as punishments. If I pour water on myself, I am wet, but that is not my punishment. The curses of eating the fruit are downgrades from living in an Elysian paradise, but they are necessary for understanding the distinction between Good and Evil. </p>\n\n\n",

The Shulchan Aruch (OC 4:2) says it’s to remove “ruach ra’ah,” an “evil spirit,” from them - but what does that actually mean?</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah (4:1) quotes two opinions. The first is that of the Rosh, who says that the institution of Netilas Yadayim was because a person probably touched a part of his body that’s normally covered during the night. </p>\n\n<p>The second is that of the Rashba, who explains that the reason we wash is because we’re considered a “new being” in the morning (and cites a passuk to that effect); therefore we wash our hands as we are created anew. </p>\n\n<p>Please don’t ask me what either of these opinions mean; I’m not going to try to guess. But neither one actually talks about a state of tumah and taharah. Therefore the question is moot. </p>\n\n<p>You’re not alone in this misconception; I’ve heard this repeated many times. I think it stems from confusion between washing in the morning versus washing for bread. In the latter case, tumah is a factor. </p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (OC 158:1) does say that one must wash over bread “even if he does not know of any tumah on them.” Mishnah Berurah (158:1) explains that there are two motivations behind this institution. One is because Terumah must be eaten in a state of purity, and in order to prevent any confusion, Chazal instituted that even non-Kohanim eating non-Terumah bread should wash their hands first. While Kohanim don’t eat Terumah nowadays, we still keep the Takanah so that, when the Beis HaMikdash will be rebuilt and the concern returns, we’ll be ready for it. The second reason is simply that a person’s hands should be clean and prepared for eating.</p>\n\n<p>At least according to the first reason presented, when it comes to eating bread, impurity is indeed an issue. Perhaps it’s from here that people misunderstood washing in the morning to be for the same reason, when that washing is very different indeed. </p>\n\n\n",

In this case he writes that the <em>mitzvah</em> of blowing the trumpets is applicable during the times of the Holy Temple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונוהגת מצוה זו בזמן הבית בכהנים שעליהם המצוה לתקוע בחצוצרות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

Moshe had a lengthy response, the main point of which seems to be that based on Rambam's classification of the different trumpet blowings (Temple-related and non-Temple-related) as only one <em>mitzvah</em> it appears that the <em>mitzvah</em> of blowing the trumpets in non-Temple-related circumstances is specifically to blow the Temple trumpets. Therefore, as we don't have Temple trumpets, we can't ever blow the trumpets even for the non-Temple-related situations, and it wouldn't help to simply make new trumpets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל הוא משום <strong>דצריך דוקא חצוצרות שבמקדש</strong> לכן מפרש שהויא המצוה מה לעשות בחצוצרות שציותה תורה לעשות שהוא ממילא מצוה אחת כל מה שתוקעין בהן וזהו אולי כוונת המ\"מ בתירוצו <strong>שהמצוה היא אחת כללית לתקוע בחצוצרות במקדש בעת הקרבנות ובעת הצרות</strong> בין במקדש בין בגבולין ואין ראוי למנותן בשתי מצות עיי\"ש <strong>ושייך זה רק כשצריך לתקוע באותן החצוצרות דמקדש דוקא</strong> אבל אם היה הדין בכל חצוצרות שאין שייך שתהיה המצוה מה לעשות בחצוצרות אלא שהוא על מעשה התקיעה ודאי הי\"ל לחושבם לשתי מצות כמו שחושב תקיעת שופר דר\"ה ותקיעת שופר דיוה\"כ דיובל בשתי מצות במצוה קל\"ז ובמצוה ק\"ע וזה סובר הריטב\"א אליבא דמנהג צרפת שסברי שהתקיעה בתעניות היא בחצוצרות כדעת הרמב\"ם <strong>א\"כ הוא דוקא בחצוצרות דמקדש</strong> לכן לא נהגו לתקוע לעולם דהרי אין לנו החצוצרות (my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Shalom_Eliashiv\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yosef Shalom Elyashiv</a> also has a responsum (Kovetz Teshuvot 2:33) about this question. He cites the Sefer Hachinuch mentioned above that the <em>mitzvah</em> is not applicable today, but wonders why this should be the case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה החינוך מ' שפ\"ד כ' מצוה לתקוע בחצוצרות במקדש וכמו\"כ בשעת הצרות\nשנא' וכי תבואו מלחמה וכתיב אחריו ג\"כ וביום שמחתכם ובמועדיכם ותקעתם כו'\nונוהגת מצוה זו בזמן הבית בכהנים שעליהם המצוה לתקוע בחצוצרות\" ואף זה\nצ\"ע למה פקע החיוב לתקוע בעת צרה בזה\"ז</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He eventually suggests that though the trumpets would not have to have been actually used in the Temple in order to use them for the non-Temple-related circumstances, they would still have to be designated for Temple use. As such, one who derives benefit from them would be guilty of trespass against the Temple. Just as the Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=13&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 13a</a>) states that we no longer designate things to the Temple because of the problems it causes, so too the <em>mitzvah</em> of blowing the trumpets was discontinued so as not to cause problems:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אכן זה לא מסתבר לומר דא\"א לקיים המצוה של והרעתם בחצוצרות אלא בחצוצרות שהשתמשו בפועל במקדש כי למה לא סגי אם הי' עושים חצוצרות שיהי' מיועדים להשתמש בהם במקדש וא\"כ למה כ' החינוך שמצוה זו אינה נוהגת אלא בזמן הבית</p>\n<p>והנה על תמיהת האחרונים למה מנה הרמב\"ם בסה\"מ מ' נ\"ט תקיעת חצוצרות בשעת הקרבת קרבנות המועדים ותקיעת חצוצרות בעת צרה למצוה אחת תי' דס\"ל להרמב\"ם דתקיעות בשעת הקרבת הקרבנות צורך הקרבן הוא והו\"ל חלק ממצות הקרבן הילכך אין למנותה במנין בפ\"ע ומעתה אם החצוצרות הם חלק ממצות הקרבן לכאו\"נ דהתוקע בו להנאתו במעילה קאי ואף שעומדת גם לתקיעות בעת צרה מידי דהוי אשמן המשחה דעומדת גם למשוח מלכים הנהנה ממנו במעילה קאי (ע' כריתות דף ה' שמא ח\"ו מעלתי בשמן המשחה וע' מנ\"ח מ' ק\"ח דיש בשמן המשחה גם לאו דמעילה כמו בכל הקדשי)ם</p>\n<p>והואיל וקיי\"ל דאין מקדישין בזה\"ז משום דחיישינן לתקלה ע' ע\"ז י\"ג ובכ\"מ שמא י\"ל דזה הטעם שמצוה זו של חצוצרות שתוקעין בעת צרה אינה נוהגת בזה\"ז כמ\"ש החינוך משום לתא דתקלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But by our continuing for a whole\n  period [of seven days] to eat unleavened bread, its object becomes\n  clear and evident.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Shavuot</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As that great revelation took place only on one day, so we keep its\n  anniversary only one day:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for the particular significance of seven (as opposed to, say, six or eight) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> writes in his commentary to Exodus Chapter 20 that the number seven is significant because it represents God who is the seventh level of existence:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה ימצא עוד תועלת בו בדעות והוא שכבר למדנו מענין השבת שבכאן לצורות\n  שבע מדרגות והמדרגה השביעית היא קדש והוא ה' יתעלה והם צורות היסודות והם\n  האיכויות כאילו תאמר החום והקור והלחות והיובש וצורות המתדמי החלקים\n  המורכבים מהיסודות וצורות הצמחים וצורות הבעלי חיים וצורת האדם והוא השכל\n  ההיולאני וצורות השכלים הנבדלים והצורה השביעית אשר שפעו ממנה כל אלו\n  הצורות היא ה' יתעלה והנה לשאר הצורות ימצא דבקות מה בחומר ומלאכות\n  מיוחדות יסודרו מהם זולתי לה' יתעלה וזה כולו מבואר במעט עיון למי שעיין\n  בדברינו בחלק השלישי מהמאמר החמישי מספר מלחמות ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his commentary to Judges Chapter 6 he references this as the explanation for why many things in Judaism are based on the number seven, and Sukkot is one of the example he gives:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה היה זה המספר לשביעיות ר\"ל שהקיפו העיר שבעה ימים והיו שם שבעה\n  כהנים ושבעה שופרות היובלים וביום השביעי הקיפו העיר שבע פעמים [לסיבה\n  בעינה] שזכרנו במספר השבעה שזכרנו בתורה כמו השמיטה ושבעה שמטות ושבע\n  שבתות שהם שבעה ימים שבע פעמים ושבעה ימי הפסח ושבעה ימי סוכה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Earlier in the aforecited chapter Rambam also touches on the significance of Passover being specifically seven days:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reason for the Passover is well known. It is kept seven days,\n  because the period of seven days is the unit of time intermediate\n  between a day and a month. It is also known how great is the\n  importance of this period in Nature, and in many religious duties. For\n  the Law always follows Nature, and in some respects brings it to\n  perfection; for Nature is not capable of designing and thinking,\n  whilst the Law is the result of the wisdom and guidance of God, who is\n  the author of the intellect of all rational beings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Alternatively, as per the sources in my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70273/why-hamokom-in-haggada/89607#89607\">here</a>, once we establish that the holidays need to have multiple days to make the point noticeable it is invalid to ask why the precise number of days was chosen. Because no matter what number was chosen you could ask why a different number wasn't chosen; therefore, it is possible that a particular number is just arbitrary, because an arbitrary number is needed.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can I eliminate or reduce the musty \"sheepy\" Torah odor?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was inspired to follow up on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/95866/5275\">this question</a> that asks about cleaning Torah scrolls.</p>\n\n<p>My shul building is about 90 years old. The Aron has 10 Torah scrolls - only 4 of them usable. This ark is opened once weekly (Shabbat only) on average. Calculating things based on the annual reading schedule, one is used regularly; a second is used about once every 3 - 4 months (Shabbat Rosh Hodesh, holidays, etc.) and the other two are \"rotated\" when reading schedules get \"close\" (e.g. Pesach has readings from various places, so I may use one of the other 2 so that I can keep one of the first two in place for future annual readings.)</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned all this because I gather that the less a scroll is used, the more likely it will develop a musty smell and, perhaps, mold? (I haven't personally seen mold on a Torah, but, I guess it can happen?)</p>\n\n<p>The ark is opened only once per week, on average. The shul gets very damp and musty esp. in the summer when it is hotter and more humid and the A.C. is not on in that area.</p>\n\n<p>Given all these factors, besides having the A.C. or a dehumidifier running in the shul (it's a huge space and the shul can't afford these solutions), what other ideas can be done to reduce the musty smell and prolong the age of the parchment?</p>\n\n<p>Are there cleaners / sprays or something like that that can be used? Would the 6 <em>passul</em> Torahs sitting in the ark be a major contributing factor to possible mold , smell and humidity? Should they be removed from the ark, permanently (we do have closets to store most if not all of them)? Any other ideas? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>One thing I didn't mention when I posted about cleaning the Torah scrolls is that the sofer who told our Rabbi how to clean them also recommended airing the scrolls on a regular basis.  Again, something we'd never thought to do.  The Rabbi says the sofer literally unrolled the Torah out on a long table (we had 4-5 8' tables end to end for this project (two sets, one for each of our scrolls)) then brought the end of it up to fold the scroll over itself so it was sticking up in the air.</p>\n\n<p>He recommended leaving it for a couple of hours before re-rolling, and doing this regularly so that each part of the scroll gets a chance to air over the course of a year.  (I do not know what the recommendation is for how many times a year each section gets to air.)</p>\n\n<p>The logistics of this can be easy or really hard depending on if you have access during the week or during non-service hours on Shabbat, what space you have to unroll the Torah, security, etc.</p>\n\n<p>My guess is that even allowing a rolled up scroll to be out (I'd try to stand it up if possible...maybe even build a stand to do this) in the main room without the cover will help air it.  </p>\n\n<p>You might consider different covers too.  If the cloth is thick or made of synthetic fiber, it won't breathe as well.  Also be sure to change covers and wash them (if possible).  For example, we do this once a year at our shul, as we have a special High Holy Days cover.</p>\n\n<p>There are no sprays.  That's something I can attest to as I do a lot of work helping people with chemical sensitivity and mold sensitivity overlaps strongly.  You can cover up the smell but you can get rid of the underlying problem (and it is something that can damage the scroll so you really don't want to just cover it up).</p>\n\n<p>If there is mold in the ark itself, then yeah, you have to deal with it.  The best way to get rid of mold is to physically remove it.  So wiping.  Use a basic cleaner (I'm a fan of Biokleen as it's natural, doesn't leave lingering scent, and really works) and lots of rags.  Is there carpet or other fabric on the floor/walls/ceiling of the ark?  Or curtains?  I'd consider completely replacing it (or at least removing and washing, if possible).</p>\n\n<p>You might think using bleach will kill mold, and it can to some degree, but studies show that plain white vinegar works even better.  Make sure not to leave water/dampness.  Wipe down the inside of the ark with vinegar after cleaning (don't forget the inside of the doors).  Let air very very well.</p>\n\n<p>I'd also recommend ozone, if you have access to a machine.  It does require electricity so I hear you that this is maybe not possible.  But it would be a one or two-time thing for a few hours.  Never run it when people are present.  Run in the empty ark for a couple of hours then turn it off (while holding your breath) and air everything for another couple of hours.  Ozone does not kill mold but it will oxidize some of the byproducts of mold that can cause damage/smell/health issues.  You can ozone the scrolls themselves but ozone oxidizes whatever it touches (like the inside of your lungs).  A small amount is unlikely to damage anything but, with scrolls that might be hundreds of years old, I wouldn't recommend taking the risk.  But if you have an unwashable cover that isn't an antique, you could ozone that.</p>\n\n<p>There are materials that suck up moisture (like the little silica packets in vitamin bottles) that you could place in the ark.  I know there are versions made for spaces that size.  You'd have to replace or recharge (remove moisture in an oven or the sun) periodically, but this could be an affordable no-electricity help to reduce humidity levels, though I'd research them to see how well they work in your climate and situation.</p>\n\n<p>I would very much like to hear what does and doesn't work for you.  </p>\n\n\n",

She is then permitted to her husband until the end of thirty-three days following the birth of a boy or sixty-six days following the birth of a girl, even if she continues to bleed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל דָּם שֶׁתִּרְאֶה הַיּוֹלֶדֶת בְּתוֹךְ ל''ג שֶׁל זָכָר וְס''ו שֶׁל נְקֵבָה הוּא הַנִּקְרָא דַּם טֹהַר. וְאֵין מוֹנֵעַ אֶת הָאִשָּׁה מִבַּעְלָהּ אֶלָּא טוֹבֶלֶת אַחַר שִׁבְעָה לְזָכָר וְאַחַר אַרְבָּעָה עָשָׂר לִנִקֵבָה וּמִשַׁמֵּשֵׁת מִטָּתָהּ אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהַדָּם שׁוֹתֵת וְיוֹרֵד:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Any blood that the <em>yoledet</em> sees within the thirty-three days for a boy or the sixty-six days for a girl is called 'blood of purity' (<em>dam tohar</em>).

The woman in this case is unlikely to be a genuine <em>yoledet bezov</em> (on a biblical level) so bibically she would be permitted to her husband after her immersion. (In fact, this would be true here if she had immersed even seven days after the birth, since in the case under discussion she gave birth to a boy.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbinically, however, she is considered to be a <em>yoledet bezov</em>. I'm assuming (although you don't state so explicitly in your question) that she has been bleeding throughout the fourteen days prior to immersing, so rabbincally the immersion would not be valid, as she has not observed seven clean days.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, this question is essentially a subset of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31253/if-one-keeps-the-deoraita-nidah7days-but-not-the-additional-4-5-days-is-there\">this one</a>. The reason I say a subset is because you note that the couple will not be engaging in marital relations. I assume that you are implying that they will not be observing any of the <em>harchakot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So we can re-state your question as: \"Is there any transgression involved in not observing <em>harchakot</em> with a rabbinic <em>zavah</em>?\"</p>\n\n<p>To answer this question (and as noted in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/31453/14850\">Yishai's answer</a> to the above-linked question) we turn to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.13a.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 13a-b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תני דבי אליהו מעשה בתלמיד אחד ששנה הרבה וקרא הרבה ושימש תלמידי חכמים הרבה ומת בחצי ימיו והיתה אשתו נוטלת תפיליו ומחזרתם בבתי כנסיות ובבתי מדרשות ואמרה להם כתיב בתורה כי הוא חייך ואורך ימיך בעלי ששנה הרבה וקרא הרבה ושימש תלמידי חכמים הרבה מפני מה מת בחצי ימיו ולא היה אדם מחזירה דבר פעם אחת נתארחתי אצלה והיתה מסיחה כל אותו מאורע ואמרתי לה בתי בימי נדותך מה הוא אצלך אמרה לי חס ושלום אפילו באצבע קטנה לא נגע [בי] בימי לבוניך מהו אצלך אכל עמי ושתה עמי וישן עמי בקירוב בשר ולא עלתה דעתו על דבר אחר ואמרתי לה ברוך המקום שהרגו שלא נשא פנים לתורה שהרי אמרה תורה ואל אשה בנדת טומאתה לא תקרב כי אתא רב דימי אמר מטה חדא הואי במערבא אמרי אמר רב יצחק בר יוסף סינר מפסיק בינו לבינה:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sage in the school of Eliyahu taught a baraita that deals with this halakha: There was an incident involving one student who studied much Mishna and read much Bible, and served Torah scholars extensively, studying Torah from them, and, nevertheless, died at half his days, half his life expectancy. His wife in her bitterness would take his phylacteries and go around with them to synagogues and study halls, and she said to the Sages: It is written in the Torah: “For it is your life and the length of your days” (Deuteronomy 30:20). If so, my husband who studied much Mishna, and read much Bible, and served Torah scholars extensively, why did he die at half his days? Where is the length of days promised him in the verse? No one would respond to her astonishment at all. Eliyahu said: One time I was a guest in her house, and she was relating that entire event with regard to the death of her husband. And I said to her: My daughter, during the period of your menstruation, how did he act toward you? She said to me: Heaven forbid, he did not touch me even with his little finger. And I asked her: In the days of your white garments, after the menstrual flow ended, and you were just counting clean days, how did he act toward you then? She said to me: He ate with me, and drank with me, and slept with me with bodily contact and, however, it did not enter his mind about something else, i.e., conjugal relations. And I said to her: Blessed is the Omnipresent who killed him for this sin, as your husband did not show respect to the Torah. The Torah said: “And to a woman in the separation of her impurity you should not approach” (Leviticus 18:19), even mere affectionate contact is prohibited. The Gemara relates that when Rav Dimi came from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said: That student did not actually sleep with her with bodily contact; rather, it was in one bed that they slept without contact. In the West, in Eretz Yisrael, they say that Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef said: When they would sleep together in one bed, she wore a belt [sinar] from the waist down that would separate between him and her.

But the text of the prayers themselves definitely went through some changes, and the clearest come from the רצה. Obviously, the modern text we have for רצה wouldn't have worked when the Temple was standing, considering its repeated references to the destruction of the Temple and the exile. In <em>My People's Prayer Book</em>, volume 2 (pp. 161–162), Rabbi Lawrence A. Hoffman reconstructs the text that would have been used in the Temple era thusly:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First he removes any mentions of the destruction – removing the phrases וְהָשֵׁב הָעֲבוֹדָה לִדְבִיר בֵּיתֶךָ and וְתֶחֱזֶינָה עֵינֵינוּ בְּשׁוּבְךָ לְצִיּוֹן בְּרַחֲמִים, as well as the chatimah of הַמַּחֲזִיר שְׁכִינָתוֹ לְצִיּוֹן.</li>\n<li>Then he suggests that the addition וּתְפִלָּתָם would have postdated the destruction, reflecting the unique Rabbinic emphasis on prayer as a means of \"replacing\" sacrifice, and that בְאַהֲבָה would have been added at the same time since בְּרָצוֹן would have covered the acceptance of sacrifices (being oft associated with the sacrificial rites).</li>\n<li>Then he uses the old Eretz Yisrael rite chatimah (as recorded in the Cairo Geniza and still used among some Ashkenazim on Musaf before dukhening), שֶׁאוֹתְךָ לְבַדְּךָ בְּיִרְאָה נַעֲבוֹד, since the present tense would have been accurate in Temple times.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So he ends up with a much shorter רצה prayer – רְצֵה ה׳ אֱלֹהֵינוּ בְּעַמְּךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל, וְאִשֵּׁי יִשְׂרָאֵל תְּקַבֵּל בְּרָצוֹן, וּתְהִי לְרָצוֹן תָּמִיד עֲבוֹדַת יִשְׂרָאֵל עַמֶּךָ.בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה', שֶׁאוֹתְךָ לְבַדְּךָ בְּיִרְאָה נַעֲבוֹד. Which he then translates as \"Find favor, Ad--ai my God, in your People Israel. And the fire-offerings of Israel, accept favorably. <strong>And may you find favor in the <em>tamid</em>, the sacrificial service of Israel your People.</strong>  Blessed are You, Ad--ai, whom we serve with awe.\"</p>\n\n<p>Note his suggestion that the תָּמִיד of the final clause referred to the <em>tamid</em>-offering, which the service surrounded. In a sense, it's the prayer of prayers in this rite. Unlike in a modern Amidah, the רצה would have almost certainly been the spiritual high point of the service – the key petitionary text.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the wine-libation service is listed in Tamid as well, including the psalms of the day. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They would give the kohen the wine.</li>\n<li>Two kohanim with trumpets would blast, tekiah, teruah, tekiah.</li>\n<li>The kohen would bend down to pour the wine.</li>\n<li>The cymbal would sound, flags would be waved, and the Levites would sing psalms.</li>\n<li>As each psalm ended, the trumpets would blast and the people would prostrate themselves.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That pretty clearly implies that more than one psalm would be sang per day. Though the psalms of the day are listed in Tamid 7:4, it seems unlikely that only those seven psalms would be sang as we do today. In the minor tractate Sofrim it lists a series of psalms that were read for each major holiday, more than one in every case. Probably different psalms would be sung each day, including but NOT limited to the seven of the week.</p>\n\n\n",

Nothing in Torah is superfluous.  The Mishna says: His ‘house’ means his ‘wife’. [Yoma 2a] The Midrash [Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer 41; also Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael] says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Pinchas said: On the eve of Shabbat, the Israelites stood at Mount Sinai, with the men and the women apart.  [God] said to Moses, “Go, speak to the daughters of Israel [and ask them] whether they wish to receive the Torah.”  Why were the women asked [first]?  Because it is the way of men to follow the opinions of women, as it is said, “Thus shall you say to the House of Jacob” -- these are the women -- “and declare to the Children of Israel” -- these are the men.  They all replied as with one mouth, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will listen.” [Ex. 24:7].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OK, but a search of the Sources reveals thousands of occurrences of the phrase \"the house of [an individual]\" and in most cases it definitely does not mean the women.  Why is this one singled out for that meaning?  Is there a rule for telling which is which?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>THis is not an answer to the Bat/Bayt question, but a suggestion regarding various generalizing statements of the Sages (both in the Gemmorah and Midrashim) either on interpreting the Torah or learning Halachah.</p>\n<p>The Mishnah in Kiddushin states that the women are exempt from Time-related Mitzvos <strong>as a rule.</strong> However, the Gemmorah discusses numerous exceptions and arrives at a conclusion of R'Yochanan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.34a.4?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 34b</a> כללות means כללים):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אמר רבי יוחנן: <strong>אין למדין מן הכללות</strong>, ואפילו במקום שנאמר בו חוץ\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One does not learn practical halakhot from general statements, i.e., when a general statement appears in a Mishna and uses the term: All, it is not to be understood as an all-inclusive statement without exceptions. This is the case even in a place where it says: Except, to exclude a specific matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although this specific statement discusses a Mishnaic generalization on the women's Ptur on Time-Related Miztvos, it seems to be applicable to the whole Rabbinical literature (incl Midrashim of course). Another example is the Jerusalem Gemmorah (Terumah 1, Chagigah 1, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.68b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevomos 68</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דרבי יונה אמר, <strong>לית כללין דרבי כללין</strong>\".</p>\n<p>R' Yonah said: Rebbi's (R' Yehudah's) generalizations aren't [true] generalizations [to be interpreted literaly].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, all places where a Rabbi (Mishnah or Gemmorah or Midrash etc) says \"all X are Y\", it is not to be understood as \"all\" but \"there are some\".</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In fact, many tried to follow the rules and generally failed. One of such examples is Shimeon Ha'Amsuni that tried to interpret all the את in the Torah (see Pesachim 22b, JT Sotah 5,5).</p>\n<p>Another example is the dispute about women's obligation or exemption from different Mitzvos as written in the Torah: can it be learned from the way of the formulation or not, such as single masculine (כבד את אביך וכו') or the word איש (איש אביו ואמו תראו) or plural masculine etc. The conclusion here is also that the formulations are inconsistent and can not be learned from as a rule.</p>\n<p>The conclusion is t<strong>hat only the verses that are explicitly interpreted in a certain way can be trusted, even if the source states that the rule generally applies to all cases</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, the partners could agree that the\n  gentile receives all profits earned on Shabbat, and the Jew will\n  receive all profits earned on Tuesday. Once they agree to this\n  arrangement, they may then divide monthly or annual revenues equally,\n  even if the Shabbat profits exceed the Tuesday profits, as the excess\n  revenue received by the Jew is legally considered a gift given to him\n  by his partner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/ohr-olam-mishnah-berurah/business-partnerships-between-jews-and-non-jews/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/06/28/partnership-with-non-jew-for-nursing-home/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more detailed overviews.</p>\n\n\n",

The revelation hasn't occurred yet because the revelation requires the world to be ready for him.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Mashiach doesn't reveal himself until we've met our part of the prophecy as well.</strong> It's a partnership rather than a one-sided affair. It is said that if the vast majority of the Jewish nation all repented for their sins overnight, the Mashiach would be revealed to us.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Aha in the name of R. Tanhum b. R. Hiyya, <strong>\"If Israel repents for\n  one day, forthwith the son of David will come.\"</strong> - The Jerusalem Talmud</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Judaism is a religion of process.</strong> Things rarely occur within singular events and instead occur over a process over time. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The world was created in 7 days</li>\n<li>The world was flooded for 40 days and nights</li>\n<li>Exodus occurred over a year with Ten Plagues <strong>(Talmud - Ediyos 2:10)</strong></li>\n<li>The Jews wandered the desert for 40 years before we were ready</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a very clear theme that runs through the Torah and this theme is things don't occur within an instant. Process is a function of divinity and things don't necessarily happen overnight and in singular events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem with your question is you're thinking of the Messianic Age as a thing which occurs overnight or in an instant. In reality, we're discussing something that is a process which occurs over decades or even centuries.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Jewish refugees and Holocaust survivors who came to Israel after WW2 was one level of process.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Jews leaving the neighboring territories of the Middle East en mass was another level of the process.</p></li>\n<li><p>The continual arrival of Jews through Aliya is another level of process.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Again, the Torah shows us that things rarely occur in singular events but are processes that occur over time. To believe that because most of the Jews left the nations you cited is evidence that the prophecy can't be fulfilled is simply ignoring what is occurring as we speak.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A good analogy for the Messianic Age is to think of it as a pregnancy.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The average pregnancy takes nine months to complete and as the pregnancy draws closer, the mother experiences further discomfort and the tremblings (contractions) of a coming birth. </p>\n\n<p>We're currently experiencing the contractions of the Messianic Age. The fact that birthing this new world can take some time, that doesn't mean it isn't happening. We need to be patient and accept that the process is moving forward at a natural pace. </p>\n\n\n",

Examples:</p>\n\n<p>-No retaliation in kind: An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth [Ex. 21:23-5; Lev 24:20, Deut. 19:21] has always been interpreted as monetary compensation.  [Baba Kamma 83b-84a]</p>\n\n<p>-The death penalty has not been applied since 30 CE.  Talmud requires two observant independent eyewitnesses, unrelated to accused or each other, prior instruction to accused, etc. Mishna [Makkot 7a]: A court that sentences one person to death in 7 years is a bloody court.  No, once in 70 years.  Rambam: It is better… to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.  [Sefer Hamitzvot, negative commandment 290]</p>\n\n<p>-Flogging fell into disuse in Middle Ages, replaced by monetary fines [Luria, Yam shel Shlomoh, BK 8:48]</p>\n\n<p>-Discretionary war (milchemet reshut) requires permission of Sanhedrin (not king alone) and we have no Sanhedrin today. Always seek a just peace before waging war [Deut. 20:10]; minimize injury to noncombatants or property; to besiege a city, surround it on only 3 sides to allow escape path; do not destroy fruit trees (Deut. 20:19,20), or break vessels, or tear clothing, or wreck that which is built up, or stop fountains, or destoy food, or kill animals needlessly; be lenient towards enemy after victory</p>\n\n<p>-Non-Jewish tribute to Jewish non-violence: Jean-Paul Sartre:  \"The Jews are the mildest of men, passionately hostile to violence. That obstinate sweetness which they conserve in the midst of the most atrocious persecution, that sense of justice and of reason which they put up as their sole defense against a hostile, brutal, and unjust society, is perhaps the best part of the message they bring to us and the true mark of their greatness.\" [1946, Reflexions sur la question juive]</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I remember a stand-up comic telling us how various ethnic groups react to being mugged in a dark alley in New York.  “Jews: ‘You mess with me and I’ll sue your tail!’” :-)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The fear and anxiety of Yaakov before meeting Eisav\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.32.8?lang=bi&with=Targum&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 32:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיִּירָא יַעֲקֹב מְאֹד וַיֵּצֶר לוֹ וַיַּחַץ אֶת־הָעָם אֲשֶׁר־אִתּוֹ וְאֶת־הַצֹּאן וְאֶת־הַבָּקָר וְהַגְּמַלִּים לִשְׁנֵי מַחֲנוֹת׃\"</p>\n<p>\"Jacob was greatly frightened; in his anxiety, he divided the people with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First of all, I noticed that in Hebrew it reads: vayetzer lo (ויצר לו), and I wondered, although it’s probably related to Hetzer הצר (to narrow or take in), if this distressed feeling, does his anxiety come from his Yetzer Hara?</p>\n<p>Secondly, what exactly was this fear/anxiety of Ya’akov, hence from where did it come? I.e. What kind of fear/anxiety are we talking about? And how was it solved by wrestling the adversary and meeting Esav?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>No, ויצר comes from צרה like in וְעֵת צָרָה הִיא לְיַעֲקֹב וּמִמֶּנָּה יִוָּשֵׁעַ (Yes 30,7). This comes from the root צרר like צורר - enemy, not יצר like ייצר - creation. One can say \"צר לי\" (I'm sorry) or in future \"יצר לי\" (I'll be sorry).<br>\nTherefore \"ויצר לו\" with וו ההיפוך should be translated as the past tense \"צר לו\".</p></li>\n<li><p>When facing a big trouble, a person remembers one's merits and misdeeds in the hope those will help him to cope with the situation. When Yaakov heard that his brother comes to fight him, he:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Was afraid [he might lose as] he didn't have the merit of the 21 years (living with Lavan) of honoring his parents [and this \"sin\" could lead to losing to Eisov] (Targum Yonoson) (\"וּדְחִיל יַעֲקב לַחֲדָא עַל דְלָא עָסַק עֶשְרִין שְׁנִין בִּיקָרָא דְאָבוֹי\")</p></li>\n<li><p>Was afraid to be killed or sorry to kill others (esp his brother) - Rashi</p></li>\n<li><p>Trusted G-d and counted on Him that he'll overcome it, but didn't want to show himself as carefree and calm (others).</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are also many other interpretations, please see the link.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Daas Zekeinim -- Esav had said \"I'll kill my brother once our father is dead.\" If Esav is coming at Yaakov now with an army, that means their father has most likely died; so Yaakov is <em>afraid</em> of Esav's attack, and <em>distressed</em> by the [erroneous] inference that his father has died.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>An answer to your second question can be brought from HaRav Elimelech Biederman's <em>Torah Wellsprings</em> (Parshas Vayishlach 5782).</p>\n<p>He first brings the Daas Zekeinim as mentioned by @Shalom. However he then goes on to add the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yaakov said (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32:11</a>):</p>\n<p>כי במקלי עברתי את הירדן הזה ועתה הייתי לשתי מחנות</p>\n<p>\"I crossed this Yarden with my staff, and now I have become two camps.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Reb Chaim Volozhiner zt'l</strong> explains that also in this pasuk Yaakov is lamenting that he lost his bitachon. ,כי במקלי עברתי את הירדן הזה Yaakov said, \"I used to have bitachon, and with my firm trust in Hashem, I put my staff in the Yarden, and the waters split.<sup>1</sup> ועתה הייתי לשתי מחנות , but now I've divided my camp into two groups, as I am afraid that Eisav might attack one of them.\"</p>\n<p>The <strong>Riv'a</strong> (from the Baalei HaTosfos) teaches that Yaakov lost his protection because of his fear. Hashem promised Yaakov that he would protect him. As it states (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 28:15</a>) ושמרתיך בכל אשר תלך , \"I will watch over you wherever you will go.\" But since Yaakov was afraid of Eisav, he lost his protection. As it states (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.26?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32:26</a>), ותקע כף ירך יעקב בהאבקו עמו \"Yaakov's thigh was dislodged when he wrestled with [the malach].\"</p>\n<p>The Riv'a adds, \"This also happened to Moshe. Hashem told him, כי אהיה עמך , 'I will\nbe with you,' yet he was injured at the hotel. This happened because he was afraid of Pharaoh, as he said, שלח נא ביד תשלח , 'Send someone else…'\"<sup>2</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p><sup>1</sup> The Degel Machaneh Efraim writes, \"My grandfather (the Baal Shem Tov zt'l) said that he once crossed the Dnieper River without using Hashem's names. He placed his belt on the water, and he said that with immense emunah he crossed the river. This can be the translation of כי במקלי עברתי … that Yaakov crossed the Yarden with his immense emunah.\"</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> The Seforno explains that as long as Yaakov Avinu was thinking about Hashem, he was protected. The moment he lost focus, the malach was able to smite him on the thigh.</p>\n<p>The Seforno writes, \"Because of Yaakov's constant deveikus to Hashem in his thoughts and in his speech, the malach couldn’t harm him. But when the malach told him about the nation's future sins … ( הודיעו החטא העתיד במדריכי עמו ) this upset Yaakov, his deveikus ceased, and [that's when the angel hit him and] his thigh was dislodged…\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

To quote the continuation of the above Gemara in Sukkah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טוב לצדיק טוב לשכינו שנאמר (ישעיהו ג, י) אמרו צדיק כי טוב כי פרי\n  מעלליהם יאכלו</p>\n  \n  <p>“Good unto the righteous, good unto his neighbor,” as it says (Yeshaya 3:10), “Say of the righteous that it is good, for ‘they’ will eat of the fruit of ‘their’ good deeds.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the Rambam doesn’t quote this concept directly, this seems to be his thrust when he rules in Deos 6:1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דֶרֶךְ בְּרִיָּתוֹ שֶׁל אָדָם לִהְיוֹת נִמְשָׁךְ בְּדֵעוֹתָיו וּבְמַעֲשָׂיו אַחַר רֵעָיו וַחֲבֵרָיו וְנוֹהֵג כְּמִנְהַג אַנְשֵׁי מְדִינָתוֹ. לְפִיכָךְ צָרִיךְ אָדָם לִהִתִחַבֵּר לַצַּדִּיקִים וִלֵישֵׁב אֵצֵל הַחֲכָמִים תָּמִיד כִּדֵי שֵׁיִּלִמֹד מִמַּעֲשֵׂיהֵם. וִיִתִרַחֵק מִן הָרִשָׁעִים הַהוֹלְכִים בַּחשֶׁךְ כְּדֵי שֶׁלֹּא יִלְמֹד מִמַּעֲשֵׂיהֶם. הוּא שֶׁשְּׁלֹמֹה אוֹמֵר (משלי יג כ) \"הוֹלֵךְ אֶת חֲכָמִים יֶחְכָּם וְרֹעֶה כְסִילִים יֵרוֹעַ\". וְאוֹמֵר אַשְׁרֵי הָאִישׁ וְגוֹ'. וְכֵן אִם הָיָה בִּמְדִינָה שֶׁמִּנְהֲגוֹתֶיהָ רָעִים וְאֵין אֲנָשֶׁיהָ הוֹלְכִים בְּדֶרֶךְ יְשָׁרָה יֵלֵךְ לְמָקוֹם שֶׁאֲנָשֶׁיהָ צַדִּיקִים וְנוֹהֲגִים בְּדֶרֶךְ טוֹבִים. וְאִם הָיוּ כָּל הַמְּדִינוֹת שֶׁהוּא יוֹדְעָם וְשׁוֹמֵעַ שְׁמוּעָתָן נוֹהֲגִים בְּדֶרֶךְ לֹא טוֹבָה כְּמוֹ זְמַנֵּנוּ. אוֹ שֶׁאֵינוֹ יָכוֹל לָלֶכֶת לִמְדִינָה שֶׁמִּנְהֲגוֹתֶיהָ טוֹבִים מִפְּנֵי הַגְּיָסוֹת אוֹ מִפְּנֵי הַחלִי יֵשֵׁב לְבַדּוֹ יְחִידִי כָּעִנְיָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (איכה ג כח) \"יֵשֵׁב בָּדָד וְיִדֹּם\". וְאִם הָיוּ רָעִים וְחַטָּאִים שֶׁאֵין מְנִיחִים אוֹתוֹ לֵישֵׁב בַּמְּדִינָה אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן נִתְעָרֵב עִמָּהֶן וְנוֹהֵג בְּמִנְהָגָם הָרַע יֵצֵא לַמְּעָרוֹת וְלַחֲוָחִים וְלַמִּדְבָּרוֹת. וְאַל יַנְהִיג עַצְמוֹ בְּדֶרֶךְ חַטָּאִים כָּעִנְיָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ירמיה ט א) \"מִי יִתְּנֵנִי בַמִּדְבָּר מְלוֹן אֹרְחִים\":</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short: it’s natural for man to be influenced by his surroundings, so one needs to surround himself with the righteous and scholarly rather than the wicked, and if he has no choice but to be surrounded by the wicked, better that he flee to the desert or mountains where he can live alone. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I believe the answer to your question is \"No\".</p>\n\n<p>First, you say \"No one is inherently evil\".  Yet Torah says: <em>Yetzer lev ha-adam ra' min'orav</em> -- The inclination of a man's heart is evil from his youth. [Genesis 8:21; also 6:5].  The Talmud adds: \"From his youth\" means \"from his birth\". [Berachot Y 3:5]</p>\n\n<p>We are taught to constantly fight this evil inclination, and when we fail we must repent.  The Midrash says: \"The gates of repentance are always open\" [Lam. R. 3:43].  The apostate 2nd-century tanna Elisha ben Abuyah heard a heavenly voice saying that what he did was so monstrous that no repentance was possible for him: </p>\n\n<p>\"[Scripture says] 'Return, you backsliding children' (Jer. 3:22), 'Return to Me, and I will return to you' (Mal. 3:7), with the exception of Elisha ben Abuyah, who knows My might and yet rebelled against Me!\" [Ecc. R. 7:16]</p>\n\n<p>But his student Rabbi Meir rejected that, and when he saw him crying before dying he said: </p>\n\n<p>\"It appears that my master died while repenting... Elisha will be saved… by the merits of his Torah.\"  [Ruth Rabbah 6:2]</p>\n\n<p>I never heard of a Jewish teaching that says anybody is a lost cause.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Can we go back to using musical instruments in synagogues when the Temple is rebuilt?",
    "content": "# Can we go back to using musical instruments in synagogues when the Temple is rebuilt?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We stopped using musical instruments in the synagogue after the Temple was destroyed, as a sign of mourning.  We used them before that time (see Psalm 150).  When the Temple is rebuilt, does halacha say we can go back to using them?  For that matter, do we know if they went back to using them after the Second Temple was built?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Very brief background:</strong>\nIn ancient days, musical instruments were used in worship:  [Mishna, Arachin 2:3 - Sefaria:  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Arakhin.2.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en]\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Arakhin.2.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en]</a>:\nThere are never less than two harps, nor more than six. There are never less than two flutes, nor more than twelve... And they did not play on a bronze pipe but on a reed pipe... Nor was anything but a single pipe used for the finale, because it makes a pleasant finale.</p>\n\n<p>Then the Temple was destroyed, and the Talmud seemed to forbid all music, anytime: [Gittin 7a.  (Sefaria: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.7a?lang=bi)]\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.7a?lang=bi)]</a>\nThey sent the following question to Mar Ukva: From where do we derive that song is forbidden in the present, following the destruction of the Temple? He scored parchment and wrote to them: “Rejoice not, O Israel, to exultation, like the peoples” (Hosea 9:1).  The Gemara asks: And let him send them a response from here: “They do not drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to them who drink it” (Isaiah 24:9), indicating that song is no longer allowed. The Gemara answers: If he had answered by citing that verse, I would say that this matter applies only to instrumental music, in accordance with the previous verse: “The mirth of tabrets ceases, the noise of them who rejoice ends, the joy of the harp ceases” (Isaiah 24:8); however, vocal song is permitted. Therefore, Mar Ukva teaches us that all types of song are forbidden.\nThis was later codified [Rambam, Hilchot Ta’aniyot 5:14; Shulchan Aruch in OH 560:3]</p>\n\n<p>This was softened to allow song.  Sotah 48a: \"Rav Huna nullified all types of song... Later, when Rav Ḥisda came and belittled this prohibition, people began to sing again.\"</p>\n\n<p>But we can't mourn on Shabbat/Yom Tov!  So the prohibition against musical instruments on those days rests on the prohibition against \"completing\" an object on Shabbat [Eruvin 104a].  Playing an instrument \"completes\" it [Rambam, Hil’chot Shabbat 23:4; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayyim 338:1].  Also, one might end up fixing (or tuning?) the musical instrument. [Mishna, Beitza 36b]</p>\n\n\n",

Why? First answer seems to be, because it was at night/sleep. If so, in the invert situation, the heter could not apply to the husband (there is no \"אשתו בעיר\" heter)?</p>\n\n<p>A concrete example: a wife receiving a woman, letting her to sleep in the living room. Especially if the woman is her sister or mother, so the husband maybe falls in definition of גיסא ביה in the sense of <em>familiar</em> with the woman.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe because R Yossef was sagi nehor, it did not count as a shomer, just as a husband presence. But for a regular wife, even when sleeping, the fact that she can wake every minute, makes her a shomer.</p>\n\n<p>Any pointers welcome.</p>\n\n\n",

The entire world had to start from scratch.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hashem, the same mercy, the same Hashem of Love, that had placed Man on\n  earth, now proclaims the decision for his destruction. The degeneracy\n  was so great, that the extermination itself was an act of mercy. Even\n  in the moment of his destruction, the greatness of Man shows itself in\n  the fact that his destruction dragged the destruction of the whole\n  living world with it. Not the world itself, but פני האדמה, the surface\n  which belongs to mankind as the ground for its mission. It is not just\n  merely a physical bond that joins men to things. It consists also of a\n  moral relationship. When mankind sinks, the world mourns and withers.\n  This fact runs through all the books of the תנ\"ך. Further, it does not\n  say אמחה את האדם, absolutely, but witht he addition of מעל פני האדמה.\n  It does not exclude the possibiity that even this destruction was a\n  relative one, removal from the earth. Whether even then the Godly\n  element in Man is not preserved for other spheres, other conditions,\n  that we can only dare interrogatively to hint at. The actual words of\n  the text, anyway imply only relative destruction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

From a kabbalistic perspective, as <em>Shabbos</em> progresses we move to ever-higher levels of <em>kedusha</em> with Friday night being the lowest level as we transition from <em>chol</em> into <em>kodesh</em>; <em>Shabbos</em> morning being the next level of holiness; and the end of <em>Shabbos</em> being a culmination, - a crescendo, really - as we arrive at the highest level of <em>kedusha</em>. </p>\n\n<p>This is paralleled by the idea that <em>Shabbos</em> as a whole is the marriage ceremony between the Jewish people and God, as it were. Friday night corresponds to the \"<em>kiddushin</em>\" and thus the Friday night prayers highlight  this with the paragraph of \"<em>Atah kidashta</em>\". <em>Shabbos</em> morning is the <em>simchas chosson v'kallah</em>, reflected in the paragraph of \"<em>yismach Moshe</em>\" highlighting the joyous nature of our relationship; finally, the <em>mincha</em> services allude to the sacred union - <em>yichud</em> between husband and wife with the \"<em>Atah echad</em>\" passage in the <em>amidah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For more in-depth examinations of these ideas, one can refer to <em>Sefer Nesivos Shalom</em>, <em>Be'er Mayim Chaim</em>, and other sources.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Name changing and mazal with 2 of our fathers and 1 mother\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud (appreciate if someone can edit the location) says that one way to change one's <em>mazal</em> is to change his / her name.</p>\n\n<p>Avram became Avraham; Sarai became Sarah and Ya'akov became Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>Did each of these people have their mazal changed as a result? If so, in what way? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Talmud states that changing one's name can tear up the decree against them, and derives this from Sarah who had a child after her name was changed:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=16b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana 16b</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא\"ר יצחק ד' דברים מקרעין גזר דינו של אדם אלו הן צדקה צעקה שינוי השם\n  ושינוי מעשה צדקה דכתיב וצדקה תציל ממות צעקה דכתיב ויצעקו אל ה' בצר להם\n  וממצוקותיהם יוציאם שינוי השם דכתיב שרי אשתך לא תקרא את שמה שרי כי שרה\n  שמה וכתיב וברכתי אותה וגם נתתי ממנה לך בן שינוי מעשה דכתיב וירא האלהים\n  את מעשיהם וכתיב וינחם האלהים על הרעה אשר דבר לעשות להם ולא עשה וי\"א אף\n  שינוי מקום דכתיב ויאמר ה' אל אברם לך לך מארצך והדר ואעשך לגוי גדול\n  ואידך ההוא זכותא דא\"י הוא דאהניא ליה</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Isaac further said: Four things cancel the doom of a man, namely,\n  charity, supplication, change of name and change of conduct. Charity,\n  as it is written, And charity delivereth from death. Supplication, as\n  it is written, Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he\n  delivered them out of their distresses. Change of name, as it is\n  written, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai,\n  but Sarah shall her name be; and it continues, And I will bless her\n  and moreover I will give thee a son of her. Change of conduct, as it\n  is written, And God saw their works, and it continues, and God\n  repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them and he did it\n  not. Some say that change of place [also avails], as it is written,\n  Now the Lord said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and it\n  proceeds, and I will make of thee a great nation. And the other [ —\n  why does he not reckon this]? — In that case it was the merit of the\n  land of Israel which availed him. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Rosh_HaShanah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Talmud elsewhere cites Avraham overcoming his \"<em>mazal</em>\" to have a child as proof that there is no <em>mazal</em> for Israel:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=156&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 156a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואף רב סבר אין מזל לישראל דאמר רב יהודה אמר רב מניין שאין מזל לישראל\n  שנאמר ויוצא אותו החוצה אמר אברהם לפני הקב\"ה רבש\"ע בן ביתי יורש אותי\n  אמר לו לאו כי אם אשר יצא ממעיך אמר לפניו רבש\"ע נסתכלתי באיצטגנינות שלי\n  ואיני ראוי להוליד בן אמר ליה צא מאיצטגנינות שלך שאין מזל לישראל מאי\n  דעתיך דקאי צדק במערב מהדרנא ומוקמינא ליה במזרח והיינו דכתיב מי העיר\n  ממזרח צדק יקראהו לרגלו </p>\n  \n  <p>Rab too holds that Israel is immune from planetary influence. For Rab\n  Judah said in Rab's name: How do we know that Israel is immune from\n  planetary influence? Because it is said, and he brought him forth from\n  abroad. Abraham pleaded before the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Sovereign\n  of the Universe! one born in mine house is mine heir.’ ‘Not so,’ He\n  replied, ‘but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels.’\n  ‘Sovereign of the Universe!’ cried he, ‘I have looked at my\n  constellation and find that I am not fated to beget child.’ ‘Go forth\n  from [i.e., cease] thy planet [gazing], for Israel is free from\n  planetary influence. What is thy calculation? Because Zedek [Jupiter]\n  stands in the West? I will turn it back and place it in the East.’ And\n  thus it is written, Who hath raised up Zedek from the east? He hath\n  summoned it for his sake. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Shabbath.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another midrashic source goes a step further and says that it was specifically Avraham's name change that allowed him to overcome the <em>mazal</em>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bereishit Rabbah 44:10</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב שמואל בר רב יצחק המזל דוחקני ואומר לי אברם אין את מוליד א\"ל\n  הקב\"ה הן כדבריך אברם לא מוליד אברהם מוליד שרי אשתך לא תקרא שמה שרי שרי\n  לא תלד שרה תלד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, it was specifically Avram that could not have a child, but Avra<strong>ha</strong>m could have a child.</p>\n\n<p>A slight issue with this is that Avraham already had a child (Yishmael) before his name-change. This is addressed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Mizrachi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliyahu Mizrachi</a> who argues that the midrash does not mean that Avram could not have a child at all; rather, it means that he could not have a child who would be fitting to inherit him:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mizrachi Bereishit 15:5</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואינו ר\"ל אברם אינו מוליד כלל שהרי הוליד את ישמעאל טרם שנקרא שמו אברהם\n  אלא ה\"פ אברם אינו מוליד בן הראוי ליורשו אברהם מוליד בן הראוי ליורשו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for Yaakov, the Talmud elsewhere tells us that his name was not actually changed; rather, he was just given an additional name:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=12b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 12b</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיוצא בו אתה אומר לא יקרא שמך עוד יעקב כי אם ישראל יהיה שמך לא לא\n  שיעקר יעקב ממקומו אלא ישראל עיקר ויעקב טפל לו </p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly you read: Thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but\n  Israel shall be thy name. This does not mean that the name Jacob shall\n  be obliterated, but that Israel shall be the principal name and Jacob\n  a secondary one. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/925428/jewish/Tefillin-Mezuzah-and-Sefer-Torah-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The subsequent major codes all adopt Rambam's ruling (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6349\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Y.D. 286</a>, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6802\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 286:16</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14587&st=&pgnum=302\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levush Y.D. 286:16</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14244&st=&pgnum=377\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan Y.D. 286:37</a>. The respective commentaries that provide the sources for those codes send the reader right back to the statement of Rambam quoted above.</p>\n\n<p>The question then is, what was Rambam's source?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Karo</a> in his commentary thereto wonders why Rambam had to include this rule at all, since it is already covered by a previous rule. He does not tell us which previous rule he is referring to, but the other commentaries appear to assume that he is referring to the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=2&hilchos=8&perek=6&halocha=8&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Mezuzah 6:8</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפיכך אחד שערי חצרות ואחד שערי מבואות ואחד שערי מדינות ועיירות הכל\n  חייבים במזוזה שהרי הבתים החייבין במזוזה פתוחין לתוכן אפילו עשרה בתים\n  זה פתוח לזה וזה פתוח לזה הואיל והפנימי חייב במזוזה כולן חייבין ומפני\n  זה אמרו שער הפתוח מן הגינה לחצר חייב במזוזה</p>\n  \n  <p>Accordingly, gates to courtyards, gates to alleys, and gates to cities\n  and towns, all require a mezuzah, since houses which require a mezuzah\n  open up to them. Even when there are ten structures leading one to\n  each other, should the innermost one require a mezuzah, they all\n  require [mezuzot]. Therefore, [our Sages] stated: A gate which opens\n  up from a garden to a courtyard requires a mezuzah. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/925428/jewish/Tefillin-Mezuzah-and-Sefer-Torah-Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his commentary to that ruling, R. Karo traces the law back to the following Talmudic statement:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=33b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 33b</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רחבה אמר רב יהודה בי הרזיקי חייב בשתי מזוזות מאי בי הרזיקי אמר רב\n  פפא סבא משמיה דרב בית שער הפתוח לחצר ובתים פתוחין לבית שער</p>\n  \n  <p>Rehabah said in the name of Rab Judah, An entrance-lodge requires two\n  mezuzoth. What is meant by ‘an entrance-lodge’? — R. Papa the Elder\n  said in the name of Rab, It is a lodge, with one door opening on to\n  the courtyard and another leading to the dwelling-houses. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Menachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino\n  translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus according to R. Karo, the source that every room in a house requires a mezuzah is a bit of a leap. We start with a Talmudic statement that when there is an entrance structure between the  main structure and the courtyard, the entrance structure requires a mezuzah in addition to the main structure's mezuzah. This is then expanded to include even a chain of ten such structures, which in turn is taken to mean that any <em>room within a structure</em> requires a mezuzah.</p>\n\n<p>That this is a bit of a leap is noted by some of the commentaries. R. Yedidya Shmuel Tarika argues that the cases in 6:8 and 6:10 are not necessarily analogous. In the former, all the outer structures require a mezuzah because they are the entrance structures to an inner structure that requires a mezuzah. In the latter case, though, each room is just another room of the house so it should be covered under the mezuzah by the entrance to the house:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=13863&rid=851\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yedid Hichot Mezuzah 6:10</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואפשר דהו\"א דוקא עשרה בתים זה פתוח לזה הואיל והפנימי חייב כולן חייבים\n  אבל בית שיש בתוך הבית עצמו חדר וחדר לפנים ממנו שהכל בית אחד תסגי\n  במזוזה אחת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somewhat similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mas%27ud_Hai_Rakkah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Massoud Chai Rakkah</a> points out that in the former case the outer structures require a mezuzah because they are necessary to get to the inner structure; in the latter case it is the reverse – we would be requiring a mezuzah on an inner room on account of the rest of the house:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=36209&rid=851\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaseh Rokeach Hilchot Mezuzah 6:10</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אפשר לומר דהתם שאני שאף ששאר הבתים החיצונים אין חייבים מצד עצמם מ\"מ\n  כיון שהפנימית חייבת והוא צריך ליכנס בה דרך שאר הבתים להכי מחייבו כולם\n  אבל הכא הוי איפכא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both of them ultimately conclude that the reason why even an inner room would require a mezuzah is simply because it is used for living. Indeed, that is what Rambam himself said at the end of 6:10 – \"since all of them are used for the purpose of dwelling and\nare permanent structures\":</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ben Yedid</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יהיב טעמא מדעת עצמו שכולן עשויין לדירה וקבועין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Maaseh Rokeach</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכיון שכל החדרים עשוים לדירה אין לחלק בהכי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this, then, the rule that every room in a house requires a mezuzah is apparently based on the assumption that the Talmudic ruling which states that the Torah specifically refers to structures that are used for living means that <em>anything</em> used for living, even an individual room that is part of an overall living structure, requires a mezuzah: </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=11b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 11b</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ל בית מה בית מיוחד לדירה יצאו אלו שאין מיוחדין לדירה</p>\n  \n  <p>therefore the text reads, ‘house’ — [meaning] just as ‘house’ means a\n  building appointed for a dwelling it thus excludes all other buildings\n  not appointed for a dwelling. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Yoma.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Berachos 46b-47a (not a full proof):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנו רבנן אין מכבדין לא בדרכים ולא בגשרים\n  [...] רבין ואביי הוו קא אזלי באורחא קדמיה חמריה דרבין לדאביי ולא אמר ליה ניזיל מר אמר מדסליק האי מרבנן ממערבא גס ליה דעתיה כי מטא לפתחא דבי כנישתא אמר ליה ניעל מר אמר ליה ועד השתא לאו מר אנא אמר ליה הכי אמר רבי יוחנן אין מכבדין אלא בפתח שיש בה מזוזה דאית בה מזוזה אין דלית בה מזוזה לא אלא מעתה בית הכנסת ובית המדרש דלית בהו מזוזה הכי נמי דאין מכבדין אלא אימא בפתח הראוי למזוזה</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages taught: We do not honor [greater people] on roads or bridges [to allow them to go first] [...] Ravin and Abaye were going on the road. Ravin’s donkey preceded Abaye’s, and Ravin did not say, “Let the Master [Abaye] go first.” [Abaye] said, “Since this Rabbi came up from the West, he’s been so arrogant.” When they reached the entrance of the Shul, [Ravin] said to him, “Let the Master go first.” [Abaye] said to him, “And until now have I not been the Master?!” [Ravin] said to him, “Thus did R’ Yochanan say: ‘“We do not honor except at an entrance with a mezuzah.” If it has a mezuzah, yes, but if it doesn’t have a mezuzah, no? But now a Shul and Beis Midrash which do not have mezuzos, so, too [one need not honor]? Rather, say “by an entrance that is fitting for a mezuzah” [to exclude roads and bridges, which are not entryways that they need mezuzos].’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sukkah 8b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר לוי משום ר\"מ שתי סוכות של יוצרים זו לפנים מזו הפנימית אינה סוכה וחייבת במזוזה והחיצונה סוכה ופטורה מן המזוזה ואמאי תהוי חיצונה כבית שער הפנימית ותתחייב במזוזה משום דלא קביע</p>\n  \n  <p>R’ Levi said in the name of R’ Meir: “Two potter’s huts, this one inside this one - the inner one is not a sukkah and is obligated in mezuzah, but the outer one is a sukkah and is exempt from mezuzah.” Why? The outer one should be like a gatehouse for the inner one and be obligated in mezuzah!

    "content": "# What is the source for Rambam's thirteen principles?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the Rambam source for the thirteen principles, brought in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=he&p2=Rambam_on_Mishnah_Sanhedrin.10.1.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his interpretation of the Mishna Sanhedrin 10:1</a>? </p>\n\n<p>By that I mean what is his source that without these principles one does not go to Olam Haba? How does he know they're not simply prohibitions? (He says in Hilchos teshuva 3 that whoever doesn't believe these things is a heretic and has no Chelek in Olam Haba) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Without getting too much into the philosophy, I believe the basic answer can be as follows:</p>\n<p>We have to realize that Rambam's conception of the World to Come is not quite the same as the standard popular conception we might be familiar with. We tend to conceptualize the system as consisting of good deeds and sins. When we perform good deeds we earn reward and when we sin we earn punishment, and the greatest reward is a nice portion in the World to Come while the greatest punishment is exclusion from the World to Come.</p>\n<p>For Rambam, however, it is a much more natural process. The World to Come is more of a state of being for the souls of those who have attained a certain degree of intellectual perfection. If someone attains this level of intellectual perfection then their intellect/soul lives on in the World to Come; if they don't reach this level then their soul/intellect ceases to exist. This process occurs regardless of the good deeds the person may have performed or the sins he may have committed. In other words, one can have performed good deeds his whole life but if he hasn't attained the requisite level of intellectual perfection his soul/intellect will not live on. If, on the other hand, one has sinned his whole life but <em>has</em> attained the requisite level of intellectual perfection then his soul/intellect will live on. Note the phraseology Rambam uses at the end of his list of the Thirteen Principles:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכאשר יהיו קיימים לאדם כל היסודות הללו ואמונתו בהם אמתית הרי הוא נכנס בכלל ישראל וחובה לאהבו ולחמול עליו וכל מה שצוה ה' אותנו זה על זה מן האהבה והאחוה <strong>ואפילו עשה מה שיכול להיות מן העבירות מחמת תאותו והתגברות יצרו הרע הרי הוא נענש לפי גודל מריו ויש לו חלק</strong> והוא מפושעי ישראל וכאשר יפקפק אדם ביסוד מאלו היסודות הרי זה יצא מן הכלל וכפר בעיקר ונקרא מין ואפיקורות וקוצץ בנטיעות וחובה לשנותו ועליו הוא אומר הלא משנאיך ה' אשנא וכו (Qafih translation, my emphasis)</p>\n<p>And when a person upholds all these foundations, and his belief in them is true, he enters into the group of Israel and it is an obligation to love him, and to have compassion for him, and all that Hashem commanded us regarding love and brotherhood for each other. <strong>And even if he has done what can be of the sins due to his desires and the overpowerment of his evil inclination, he will be punished commensurate to the greatness of his rebellion but he still has a portion and he is of the sinners of Israel.</strong> But when a person doubts one of these foundations he has left the group, and denied God, and is called a sectarian and a heretic and a cutter of shoots, and it is an obligation to hate him, and of him it is said \"do I not hate those who hate you, Hashem?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This concept is probably best illustrated with the analogy given by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._David_Bleich\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. J. David Bleich</a>:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=OKL4bGl-S80C&printsec=frontcover&dq=with%20perfect%20faith%20bleich&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDiv2CjLveAhUOoFMKHYJwCRwQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=calculus&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">With Perfect Faith p. 180</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The heretic has failed in this task and, regardless of his degree of\nculpability, has not attained the perfection required to enjoy \"the\nsplendor of the <em>Shekhinah</em>.\" The situation is crudely analogous to\nthat of the student who fails to master algebra through no fault of\nhis own and must then be refused permission to enroll in a calculus\ncourse. Such denial is not by way of punishment, but an assessment of\nthe fact that the one who has not mastered the rudiments of a subject\ncannot profit from advanced instruction in that discipline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So getting back to the question at hand, we can say that Rambam does not need any source that \"without these principles one does not go to Olam Haba\". This is simply the natural conclusion. The Thirteen Principles for Rambam are basic fundamental philosophical/theological truths. One who fails to master the Thirteen Principles does not properly know God, and has thus not met the minimum threshold for his soul/intellect to live on. This, too, is expressed clearly by R. Bleich:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=OKL4bGl-S80C&printsec=frontcover&dq=with%20perfect%20faith%20bleich&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDiv2CjLveAhUOoFMKHYJwCRwQ6AEIKjAA#v=snippet&q=the%20awareness%20without&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">With Perfect Faith p. 16</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These truths can be recognized and comprehended by all, and, when\naffirmed, provide a degree of intellectual achievement sufficient to\nguarantee immortality. The Thirteen Principles, then, constitute the\nminimum degree of knowledge sufficient to assure a portion in the\nworld-to-come. The profession, or better, the awareness without which\nprofession is impossible, of these Thirteen Principles thus serves, so\nto speak, as the minimum entrance requirements for admission to the\nHeavenly Academy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for how/why it is these specific Thirteen Principles, the following paragraph from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Kellner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr. Menachem Kellner</a> might provide some perspective:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9FYRAQAAIAAJ&dq=must%20a%20jew%20believe%20anything&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=impugns\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Must a Jew Believe Anything? p. 61</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That God exists, is one, is incorporeal, and precedes the world are\nbeliefs which one need not accept 'on faith', according to Maimonides.\nThese beliefs can be proven using the tools of philosophy. That God\nalone may be worshipped is a consequence of the first four beliefs,\nsince worshipping another impugns God's unity. That prophecy occurs\nwas a fact not disputed by any religious believer and, in Maimonides'\nday, was accepted by all educated persons. In his <em>Guide of the\nPerplexed</em> Maimonides proves to his satisfation that the Torah really\nwas given by God; this being so, it is not susceptible to change.\nSince the Torah was the content of Moses' prophecy, and since the\nTorah will never change, Moses' prophecy must of necessity be superior\nto that of all other prophets. That God knows the deeds of human\nbeings is, again, something which Maimonides was convinced could be\nproved to be true. A good and powerful God, Maimonides held, guides\nhuman beings through reward and punishment; the coming of the Messiah\nand resurrection are examples of such recompense. Thus, all thirteen\nof the principles are beliefs which any rational person — at least,\nany rational person in the twelfth century — could be expected to\naccept, at least after he or she was shown their truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The source is chapter ten (or eleven) of Mishnah Sanhedrin, which states that,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“all Israelites have a share in the world to come.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maimonides had a problem. He felt that only those who developed their minds would have a place in the world to come. Unfortunately for him, most people do not develop their intellect. The problem was resolved when he implemented the “Thirteen Principles.” Raphael Jospe posits that he did so by teaching three important ideas to his readers. The first pertains to the knowledge of G-d. Those who understand G-d correctly will have have a share in the world to come. The second concerns the observance of the Torah and the biblical enactments as the rabbis explained them. Torah study leads to proper action and knowledge about G-d, developing their minds. The third emphasizes about reward and punishment. The fear of punishments and the desire for reward leads Jews to observe mitzvot, which in turn, leads to knowledge of G-d. Thus, by teaching that the afterlife is dependent upon knowledge, thereby helping them develop their minds, Maimonides was successful in using his Thirteen Principles, thereby ensuring that “all Israelites have a share in the world to come.”</p>\n\n\n",

Where marriage to a particular Jewish partner is a major incentive to a prospective conversion, there is an increased possibility that the geirus may come with less than the complete commitment necessary for a conversion that would be in keeping with the standards we are trying to set for the regional Batei Din. <em>Nonetheless, experience also shows that such a motivation can result in converts of the highest caliber.</em> Conversion for the sake of marriage therefore requires the Beit Din to constantly reevaluate if the candidate and future partner are likely to subscribe to the requisite beliefs and practices. The Beit Din must be convinced that if the potential spouse were to disappear from the candidate’s life, his or her commitment to the Jewish faith and people would not waver. These factors inevitably prolong the process and make examination of the prospective convert more intense. Indeed, should the couple mention a proposed wedding date as a deadline or goal, the Beit Din should respond that the process will take significantly longer than that.</p>\n\n\n",

Regardless, it's nearly impossible to force everyone to turn off their phones or place it in a locker. As an alternative, I'm curious if anyone has invented a complete cell service \"blocker\" which will block out all web as well as phone service from both inbound and outbound calls, as well as all texts, WhatsApp, etc. It won't completely discourage people from using their cell phones, but, at least, if they can't have their phone's ring, it will be less noisy, and it may ultimately discourage such people from using the phones altogether while praying.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Whether someone’s done this or not, I’m not sure, but I know the question was posed to Rav Zilberstein (don’t have the source on hand) of a hatzalah agent who missed a call because of this and as a result someone died. That’s probably why you don’t see this very often. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the technology exists. It’s the same technology that keeps you from getting toasted whenever you turn your microwave on, or to keep a thief from using an RFID reader to steal your credit card information: a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Faraday cage</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The way it works is that particles in the cage are designed as to distribute the charge evenly and equally across the cage, rather than allow it to pass through. This needs to be calibrated fairly precisely: the microwave doors are calibrated to trap microwaves inside, but you can call a phone you’ve left in there, and you can see the light produced from the bulb inside; an RFID bag may or may not allow visible light through, but the important part is that it blocks radio waves. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_frequency_bands\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LTE frequencies</a> range from 450 to 5925 MHz, so you may need two or three layered cages to cover the entire spectrum (and possibly watch for quantum effects).

This is first suggested by Ramban to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/41.45#e0n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishis 41:45</a>.  According to this, he simply didn't know the current identification of the other nations.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with that answer is that it should not carry over to the other Targumin that translate it similarly (especially since they sometimes repeat the Torah's name for a nation or place), such as Targum Yonasan above, and Targum Yerushalmi to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/24.21#e0n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bamidbar 24:21</a> (one of the many other places that this translation appears), and nor did it necessarily retain the same name in the times of the Amoraim.</p>\n\n<p>However, we can simply answer that since this was such an early connection (Onkelos and Chazal understood it this way), all these sources agreed with this correlation, and that's why it is so widespread among the translations.  Also, in Lunz's Hameamer page 273, he identifies it with a city south of Beis She'an called Salumia in Arabic, which he claims is referred to in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.9b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Bava Basra 9b</a> as שלומי.</p>\n\n<p>This may also be the opinion of the Korban Haedah, as when the Yerushalmi Kiddushin 1:9 makes this same association, he says that there is no midrashic connection to these places, it was simply a known geographical location:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה\"ג רי\"א שלמאה ערביי' נבטייה . הן ג' מדינות <strong>וגמרא גמיר ליה שהן ארץ קיני וקניזי וקדמוני</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If so, perhaps Onkelos was not familiar with the others.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Sefer Meir Ayin on Shoftim (page 4, <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=OaI0AQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA4&lpg=RA1-PA4&dq=%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99&source=bl&ots=SvoxAgxqkS&sig=gJaNi2hv3H3NcUKudLJL_6qXsZU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5yvjjjo_eAhUro1kKHWynDOIQ6AEwAnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) notes 1 Divrei Hayamim 2:54-55 (below quote), which connects \"Salma\" to the house of \"Keinim\", suggesting that this was the name by which they were called later on, and thus referred to by an ancestor's name in the Targum, whereas we don't know the ancestors of the other nations:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּנֵ֣י <strong>שַׂלְמָ֗א</strong> בֵּ֥ית לֶ֙חֶם֙ וּנְט֣וֹפָתִ֔י עַטְר֖וֹת בֵּ֣ית יוֹאָ֑ב וַחֲצִ֥י הַמָּנַחְתִּ֖י הַצׇּרְעִֽי׃\n  וּמִשְׁפְּח֤וֹת סֹֽפְרִים֙ [יֹשְׁבֵ֣י] (ישבו) יַעְבֵּ֔ץ תִּרְעָתִ֥ים שִׁמְעָתִ֖ים שׂוּכָתִ֑ים <strong>הֵ֚מָּה הַקִּינִ֣ים הַבָּאִ֔ים</strong> מֵחַמַּ֖ת אֲבִ֥י בֵית־רֵכָֽב׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://yulib002.mc.yu.edu:3081/stable/23504777\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JSTOR article</a>, Dov Rappel notes that no one is really sure of the answer to this question, but also notes the Midrashic association that we did above.  He also suggests that it שלמאי may be an Aramaic translation of the word קיני, but doesn't explain why Onkelos and others would translate the name of this nation specifically.</p>\n\n<p>None of the classic Mefarshei Onkelos here (such as those listed on <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2010/10/lech-lecha-sources.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this page</a>) provide any serious insight.  Nesinah Lager (R' Nosson Adler) references Shir's article in <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bikkurei Haittim</a> 5584 (link at the bottom of that page), which my computer is loading really slowly, so I can't look it up.  He also notes Ibn Ezra, which likely refers to the fact that these nations have two names, and perhaps he understood that to mean that Salmai was their real name.</p>\n\n<p>I might suggest (kind of the opposite of Sefer Meir Ayin) that the Keni may have been named after a person named Kayin, but that was not how the nation was known in the times of Chazal/Onkelos, whereas the names of the others were pure names of nations, and not named after an individual.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading about the Keini, see mefarshim to this Passuk (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/15.19#e0n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishis 15:19</a>), particularly Radak. </p>\n\n\n",

Such an approach provides for the poor person in the long term, and simultaneously salvages his human dignity that he need not feel like a needy dependent.

    "content": "# What are the parameters of the prohibition against a non-Jew learning Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara (Sanhedrin 58a) declared that a non-Jew is liable to death for learning Torah (at least the parts not relevant to him practically). If you read the passuk תורה צוה לנו משה מורשה literally, “The Torah did Moshe command us as an inheritance,” then if a non-Jew learns Torah, he’s in violation of theft; if you expound מורשה as מאורשה, then you get “The Torah did Moshe command us as a wife,” and then the non-Jew is in violation of adultery. </p>\n\n<p>In practice, what should one’s response be if and when a non-Jew approaches him asking about some area of Halacha? Should the Jew explain it to him, perhaps as simply as possible without all the esoteric details, or should he not explain it at all, politely explaining why (while not quoting the above Gemara, as that would also be teaching him Torah)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Weinberg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg</a> has a responsum that deals with this question. It is a lengthy responsum (and you should read it in it's entirety if you can) but one key point is what he derives from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a>'s wording of this rule:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shu\"t Seridei Eish 2:90 (Mosad Harav Kook edition)</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יוצא מדבריו  שהאיסור הוא רק בעושה לשם מצוה ומתכוון לחדש דת  אבל לא\n  בלומד מאהבת חכמה או להכיר תורתם של ישראל  וכמו בשבת  שאם ישב בטל אינו\n  עובר  אלא רק בקבע יום לשביתה  כמו שכתב שם  אם עשאהו לעצמו כמו שבת\n  (ועיין ברדב\"ז שם שכתב כן) כן הדבר בתורה  שהאיסור הוא רק אם קבע את\n  הלימוד לשם מצוה והרי הוסיף בזה על שבע מצותיו וחידש את דתם שלא כפי\n  המצווה עליו</p>\n  \n  <p>It comes out from his words that the prohibition is only when [the\n  non-Jew] does it for the sake of the <em>mitzvah</em> and intends to\n  originate religion, but not if he learns out of love of wisdom or to\n  recognize the Torah of Israel. And just like with <em>Shabbat</em> where if\n  [the non-Jew] sat doing nothing he does not violate [the prohibition\n  of a non-Jew observing <em>Shabbat</em>] unless he designates the day for\n  resting, as he writes there \"if he made it for himself as <em>Shabbat</em>\"\n  (and see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_ben_Solomon_ibn_Abi_Zimra\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radvaz</a> there who writes this), so too it is with Torah – the\n  prohibition is only if he designates the learning for the sake of the\n  <em>mitzvah</em>, by which he is adding to the seven <em>mitzvot</em> and originating religion not in accordance with what was commanded to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He reiterates this later as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכל מקום האיסור הוא רק אם הוא קובע הלימוד בתור מצוה ונוהג בעצמו מנהג\n  ישראל וכן בשבת אם קובע יום מיוחד לשביתה כנ\"ל משא\"כ אם הוא יושב בטל\n  מתוך עצלות או לומד תורה מתוך אהבת חכמה כמו שלומדים שאר חכמות או מתוך\n  רצון גרידא להכיר תורתן של ישראל אז אין שום איסור לא על העכו\"ם ולא על\n  ישראל המלמדו</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, the prohibition is only if [the non-Jew] designates the\n  learning as a manifestation of a <em>mitzvah</em>, and acts with himself\n  [according to] the custom of Israel. And so too with <em>Shabbat</em>, if he\n  designates a specific day for resting, as mentioned earlier. As\n  opposed to if he just sits doing nothing out of laziness, or he learns\n  Torah out of love of wisdom like learning other branches of wisdom or\n  out of simple desire to recognize the Torah of Israel, the there is no\n  prohibition – not on the non-Jew, nor on the Jew who teaches him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He also adds that even in a situation where it is forbidden for the non-Jew to learn, it is probably not forbidden for the Jew to teach him:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולפי דעתי אין איסור על המלמד אפילו במקום שמתכוון העכו\"ם לשם מצוה שאין\n  זה דומה לנתינת יין לנזיר דהתם היין הוא המכשול משא\"כ הכא אין התורה\n  המכשול אלא הקביעות והכוונה לחדש דת ויש לפלפל בזה</p>\n  \n  <p>And in my opinion there is no prohibition on the teacher even in a\n  situation where the non-Jew intends it for the sake of the <em>mitzvah</em>,\n  for this is not comparable to giving wine to a <em>nazir</em> where the wine\n  [itself] is the stumbling block, whereas here it it is not the Torah\n  that is the stumbling block but the designation and intent to\n  originate religion [that is the stumbling block]. And there is what to\n  discuss about this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in sum, according to R. Weinberg's understanding of Rambam there would be no problem with a non-Jew asking a Jew to explain some area of halacha, unless the non-Jew is doing it because he wants to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of learning Torah, and even then there would probably be no problem for the Jew to provide the explanation because by teaching him Torah he is not providing him with the forbidden object, as the forbidden object in this case is the non-Jew's intent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm a non-Jew, so please forgive me if I have erred regarding anything here, or accidentally omitted anything which ruins my point, or overlooked these points in the answers to other similar questions.</p>\n<p>The Gemara compares a gentile studying Torah to adultery or theft. But these can only be true if the gentile (even if we assume gentile means all non-Jews) is taking the Torah for his own, ie. depriving Its rightful owners. A non-Jewish believer of G-d that accepts that the Torah isn't his, and who studies it for non-selfish reasons has committed no theft. He has done nothing to erode the Jewish connection to the Torah (and perhaps his adoration strengthens the Jewish connection, for perception is dependent on the views of one's company). One may appreciate the possession of one's superior without having committed theft. This is also what the same Gemara suggests later:</p>\n<p>\"The Gemara raises an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from a baraita: Rabbi Meir would say: From where is it derived that even a gentile who engages in Torah study is considered like a High Priest? It is derived from that which is stated: “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances, which if a man does he shall live by them” (Leviticus 18:5)... The Gemara answers: There, in the baraita, the reference is to a gentile who engages in the study of their seven mitzvot. It is a mitzva for a gentile to study the halakhot that pertain to the seven Noahide mitzvot, and when he does so he is highly regarded.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir's objection and the Gemara's reconciliation of that objection forces us to adopt a particular meaning of \"study.\" As a non-Jew who learns of the Noahide Laws and doesn't keep them cannot be called a High Priest (per Rabbi Meir's quoted definition), so a non-Jew who studies Torah but doesn't adopt any Mitzva that doesn't apply to him cannot run afoul of the Gemara's prohibition. He is not \"studying\" by the Gemara's definition of \"studying\" (as that definition appears to me in the text anyway).</p>\n<p>This is the exact manner that both the RAMBAM and R. Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg (quoted by Alex in his answer to this question) interpret it, and therefore there is no contradiction with the Gemara. Furthermore, it seems this is the only way to reconcile this Gemara with a commonly (though perhaps not exclusively) given purpose of exile: converts (Gemara Pesachim 87b, explained by Yaaros Dvash (r'Yonasan Eibeshitz) 8,16). If Torah cannot be taught to any non-Jew, then all converts are impossible, unless they decide to convert while still blind to the Torah and their future obligations, which I know no orthodox Rabbi would tolerate.</p>\n<p>So by this analysis of the Gemara, the parameters of the prohibition against a non-Jew studying Torah only concern study for the sake of performing a Mitzva beyond the non-Jews seven Mitzvot.</p>\n<p>ואמר ר' יוחנן עובד כוכבים שעוסק בתורה חייב מיתה שנאמר (דברים לג, ד) תורה צוה לנו משה מורשה לנו מורשה ולא להם וליחשבה גבי שבע מצות מ\"ד מורשה מיגזל קא גזיל לה מאן דאמר מאורסה דינו כנערה המאורסה דבסקילה מיתיבי היה ר\"מ אומר מניין שאפילו עובד כוכבים ועוסק בתורה שהוא ככהן גדול שנאמר (ויקרא יח, ה) אשר יעשה אותם האדם וחי בהם כהנים לוים וישראלים לא נאמר אלא האדם הא למדת שאפילו עובד כוכבים ועוסק בתורה הרי הוא ככהן גדול התם בשבע מצות דידהו:</p>\n<p>Sanhedrin 59a:\n\"And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A gentile who engages in Torah study is liable to receive the death penalty; as it is stated: “Moses commanded us a law [Torah], an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:4), indicating that it is an inheritance for us, and not for them. The Gemara challenges: But if so, let the tanna count this prohibition among the seven Noahide mitzvot. The Gemara explains: According to the one who says that the verse is referring to the Torah as an inheritance, this prohibition is included in the prohibition of robbery, as a gentile who studies Torah robs the Jewish people of it. According to the one who says that the verse is referring to the Torah as betrothed, as the spelling of the Hebrew word for betrothed [me’orasa], is similar to that of the word for inheritance [morasha], the punishment of a gentile who studies Torah is like that of one who engages in intercourse with a betrothed young woman, which is execution by stoning. The Gemara raises an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from a baraita: Rabbi Meir would say: From where is it derived that even a gentile who engages in Torah study is considered like a High Priest? It is derived from that which is stated: “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances, which if a man does he shall live by them” (Leviticus 18:5). The phrase: Which if priests, Levites, and Israelites do they shall live by them, is not stated, but rather: “A man,” which indicates mankind in general. You have therefore learned that even a gentile who engages in Torah study is considered like a High Priest. The Gemara answers: There, in the baraita, the reference is to a gentile who engages in the study of their seven mitzvot. It is a mitzva for a gentile to study the halakhot that pertain to the seven Noahide mitzvot, and when he does so he is highly regarded.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>Learning Torah is manifested in two parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Knowing it, remembering it and fulfilling it in practice</strong>. This is not different from any other profession or science - one studies it to know it and to implement the knowledge in his life.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Enjoying the process of studying the Torah</strong> as a mean to get close to G-d (<em>some sort of metaphorical intimate relations between G-d and the Jews</em>). This part is solely intended for the Jewish people and a Non-Jew that would study it in this way would be liable to the death penalty as one that would have relations with a Jewish woman.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Therefore Gentiles are not only permitted to study the Torah extensively in the first way, but, according to the Gemmorah in Kiddushin and Rambam in Hichot Talmud Torah, they are rewarded for that as ones that are not commanded but still perform the commandment. So any Gentile that wants to KNOW more is welcomed. </p>\n\n<p>There are, however, parts of the Jewish tradition called the \"Sod\", like the \"intimate parts of the Torah\" that are forbidden to be taught to the Gentiles. This does not include any practical Halachot.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It seems that the same reasoning applies to [the Sugya of] women and the study of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>PS. Not many people understand this distinction as the [common] Litvakes approach is almost exclusively intellectual, based on the meticulous study. On the contrary, the Chassidic approach is \"כיוון שחסידים הם תורתן משתמרת\", as he stories about BaSH\"T go.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words,   Is there a halachic impediment to that?</p>\n\n<p>Would all food that looks and tastes like treif and hametz be permitted?  </p>\n\n<p>I know similar questions have been asked before, but not when the resulting food has absolutely no connection to animals or to the real food chain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarification</strong>. I am talking about a machine where you put, say, stones at one end, click on \"bacon-cheeseburger\", and out it comes at the other end, piping hot, with no way to distinguish it from the natural product.

You typically see people using needle-like devices to puncture and drain the flesh of things which would either naturally heal on their own or don't pose a direct threat to one's health or wellbeing. </p>\n\n<p>I was curious if there was a Rabbinical opinion on the topic as I can certainly see how certain types of pimple pops or removals could result in the scarification of one's skin.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>An example being someone who routinely digs into their own skin out of habit to the point where they scar their skin permanently.</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.169.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">169:1</a> -  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.169.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן קסט - אסור כתבת קעקע</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּמִכָּל מָקוֹם מֻתָּר לִתֵּן אֵפֶר וּשְׁאָר דְּבָרִים עַל הַמָּכָּה לִרְפוּאָה, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁיִֹשָּׁאֵר הָרשֶׁם, כִּי גַם מִמַּכָּתוֹ יִשָּׁאֵר רשֶׁם הַמּוֹכִיחַ עָלָיו, שֶׁלֹּא עָשָׂה מִשּׁוּם כְּתֹבֶת קַעְקַע. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, it is permitted to put ashes and other things on a wound for medical purposes, even if a mark will remain; for (in such cases) the wound will also leave a mark, and it will be apparent that you did not do it for the purpose of tattooing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems permitted to routinely dig into one's own skin out of habit to the point where one scars their skin permanently. </p>\n\n<p>Also in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.91.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">91:12</a> -  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.91.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן צא - דין מי שיש לו מחוש וחולה שאין בו סכנה</a> regarding Shabbat the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סעיף יב' \n  הַפּוֹתֵחַ מֻרְסָא כְּדֵי לְהַרְחִיב פִּי הַמַּכָּה, כְּדֶרֶךְ שֶׁהָרוֹפְאִים עוֹשִׂים, שֶׁהֵם מִתְכַּוְנִים לִרְפוּאָה לְהַרְחִיב פִּי הַמַּכָּה, הֲרֵי זֶה חַיָּב, שֶׁזּוֹ הִיא מְלֶאכֶת הָרוֹפֵא. וְאִם פְּתָחָהּ רַק כְּדֵי לְהוֹצִיא מִמֶּנָּהּ אֶת הַלֵּחָה שֶׁמְצַעַרְתּוֹ, וְאֵינוֹ חוֹשֵׁשׁ אִם תַּחֲזוֹר וְתִסָּתֵם מִיָּד, הֲרֵי זֶה מֻתָּר מִשּׁוּם צַעְרוֹ. וְדַוְקָא לְנָקְּבָהּ עַל יְדֵי מַחַט וְכַדּוֹמֶה אֲבָל לֹא בְצִפָּרְנָיו, מִשׁוּם דְּתוֹלֵשׁ קְצָת מֵעוֹר הַמֻּרְסָא, וְיֵש בָּזֶה חִיוּב. וְגַם עַל יְדֵי מַחַט וְכַדּוֹמֶה, כֵּיוָן שֶׁיֵּשׁ לָחוּשׁ, שֶׁמָּא יִתְכַּוֵּן שֶׁתִּשָׁאֵר פְּתוּחָה, כְּדֵי שֶׁתּוֹצִיא לֵחָה גַּם אַחַר כָּךְ עַל כֵּן אִם אֶפְשָׁר יֵשׁ לַעֲשׂוֹת עַל יְדֵי נָכְרִי. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>One who punctures an abscess in order to enlarge the opening of the wound, in the manner of physicians when they attempt to facilitate healing by enlarging the opening of the wound, is guilty of a Shabbos violation, for this requires a doctor's skill. If his [purpose in] opening it the abscess is only to drain the pus, which is causing him pain, and he is unconcerned if the [opening] closes up again immediately, this is permitted due to his pain. [This is permitted] only when he punctures it with a needle or something similar. But, [he may not do so] with his nails because he then tears some of the skin of the abscess, which makes him liable [for doing a melachah]. Even by means of a needle or something similar, there is concern that he may want the wound to remain open, so that the pus will continue to drain, therefore, wherever possible this should be done by a non-Jew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems that the only concern is Shabbat-related and causing permanent changes to one's body is not an issue.</p>\n\n\n",

Joseph Ibn Kaspi</a> has a comment that might be coming to address this, but he doesn't really explain himself.

Ephraim Luntschitz</a> gives an explanation which could, perhaps, account for the repetition.

That is why in 11:31 the verse describes Terach taking Lot in between taking Abraham and Sarah, i.e. Lot came between Abraham and Sarah because they had separated. However, in 12:2 God promised Abraham children, so he took Sarah back. Thus, 12:4 tells us that Lot came on his own, whereas 12:5 describes that Abraham took Sarah and Lot, i.e. he took back Sarah between him and Lot once he knew he would have kids:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויקח אברם את שרי אשתו ואת לוט בן אחיו. ולמעלה נאמר ויקח תרח את אברם\n  בנו ואת לוט בן הרן בן בנו ואת שרי כלתו לפי שקודם שהובטח אברם שיהיו לו\n  בנים היה מתרחק מן שרה מצד היותה עקרה לפי שכל אותן הבעילות אינן לקיום\n  המין ע\"כ נאמר ותהי שרי עקרה אין לה ולד  וסמוך ליה ויקח תרח את אברם\n  וגו' לפי שהיתה עקרה על כן הכניס את לוט ביניהם  אבל אחר שנאמר ואעשך\n  לגוי גדול והובטח בבנים כתיב ויקח אברם את שרי אשתו ואת לוט  כי בלשון\n  ויקח הורה שאומר כאילו עשה לקוחין שניים תחת אשר היה פרוש ממנה כדרך\n  שנאמר וילך איש מבית לוי ויקח את בת לוי ומה שנאמר וילך אברם כאשר דבר\n  אליו ה' וילך אתו לוט  היינו לוט מעצמו הלך אחריו אבל אברם לא קרבו\n  ואדרבא הרחיקו ויקח את שרי וגו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is one obligated to give up one’s life for all mitzvos only with a decree against Judaism and not just persecution?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=74&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 74a</a> quotes R’ Yochanan as saying that one is obligated to give up his life even for a minor mitzvah in a period of Gezeiras HaMalchus - a decree of the king. Rashi (DH v’afilu mitzvah kala) explains that this is “so that the idolaters do not become accustomed to pull the Jews to [sinning].” </p>\n\n<p>According to this explanation, why must it specifically be a <em>decree</em>? Even if it’s a time of religious persecution this should be an issue. </p>\n\n<p>I should note that Mesoras HaShas §20 quotes an alternative reading of the Gemara that indeed replaces “Gezeiras HaMalchus” with “Shemad,” persecution, and as this is preceded by a similar explanation to Rashi’s, I imagine this change is implemented to solve this very problem. However, I would like an answer that does not rely on changing the reading of the Gemara. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't think the change in the Mesoras Hashas is implemented to solve the problem. It's implemented because that appears to be the original text. The Munich Manuscript has the text of R. Yochanan's statement as \"השמד\" rather than \"גזירת המלכות\":</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HRcRB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HRcRB.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Munich Manuscript\"></a></p>\n\n<p>It looks like the word השמד was censored in the printed edition. In fact, we see a similar phenomenon in Rambam's codification of this law. R. Yosef Kapach writes that all the manuscripts have בשעת השמד:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל בשעת השמד וכו' כ\"ה הנוס' בכל כ\"י</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet some printed editions have בשעת הגזירה instead. Notably, Rambam gives a definition of שעת השמד and the very definition he provides is that of a wicked king issuing a decree:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 5:3</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל הדברים האלו שלא בשעת השמד אבל בשעת השמד והוא כשיעמוד מלך רשע\n  כנבוכדנצר וחביריו ויגזור שמד על ישראל לבטל דתם או מצוה מן המצות יהרג\n  ואל יעבור אפילו על אחת משאר מצות בין נאנס בתוך עשרה בין נאנס בינו לבין\n  גוים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer to your question of how Rashi's explanation fits this may be in accordance with the explanation of R. Menachem Karokovski. He explains that Rambam is codifying this law specifically in a case where the persecution is on the Jews as a whole. If it's just a random persecution of an individual Jew, why should it make any difference whether the persecutor is a king or anyone else. In such a case we already established that the law depends on whether it is in public or in private. The factor about the king's decree is that that is something that is a persecution against the religion of the Jews as a whole, and that is where there is a special law that one has to give up his life even for minor mitzvot:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Avodat Hamelech, Hilchot Yesodei Hatorah 5:3</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל כוונת רבנו במ\"ש ויגזור גזירה על ישראל הוא כמ\"ש לעיל ה\"ב דדוקא אם\n  הגזירה היא על כלל ישראל משא\"כ אם היא על היחיד דאז תלוי רק בפרהסיא\n  וצנעא דלענין היחיד מה לי מלך מה לי שאר עכו\"ם אונס ותלוי רק אם יש שם\n  עשרה מישראל והרגיש בזה גם הרב מרכבת המשנה ח\"ב והראיתי גם מקור דבריו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, it is possible that Rashi agrees that we don't care about an individual Jew being forced to sin. The problem R. Yochanan is trying to avoid is that of encouraging religious persecution of the Jews as a whole, which is not an issue when a random person forces a Jew to sin – even if that person happens to be doing it as a religious persecution.</p>\n\n\n",

I believe I have based this thinking on what I learned in yeshiva. Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>The mitzva is to die 'al pi kiddush Hashem' - in order to make Hashem's name holy. In most times, if one were to die for the sake of a minor commandment, this would not sanctify Hashem's name. In fact it might be a chillul Hashem, as Torah would be being misrepresented (because the Torah says one must break any mitzva for the sake of preserving life - except the same ones for chillul Hashem!) and make it seem unreasonable if it expected someone to die over food, or tying a left shoe before a right shoe. However, refusing to engage in any of the three obviously evil sins of adultery, idol worship and murder is always something that will demonstrate how holy Torah is and Hashem.</p>\n<p>A time of religious persecution must mean a time when even dying for a minor sin would strengthen the name of Torah. When would that be? At a time when the authorities are specifically against that mitzva, <em>because it is Hashem's mitzva</em>. If they are forbidding Torah study, or mikva, or trying to ban shechita, and are doing it davka to end Judaism, and trying blot Hashem's name out of the world chas veshalom, then dying rather than break the mitzva is explicitly a kiddush Hashem.</p>\n<p>Religious persecution is when <em>our religion</em> is being persecuted.</p>\n\n\n",

Does <em>shemitat kesafim</em> happen automatically?) would appear to be <strong>the subjects of arguments among the Rishonim</strong>.</p>\n<p>Many Rishonim would appear to understand that <em>shemitat kesafim</em> is indeed a <strong>full, automatic annulment of the loan</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, Yere'im seems to be of the opinion that the <strong>loan continues to exist</strong>, but the lender is forbidden to claim it, and <strong>needs to explicitly state his intention to do so</strong> in order to free the borrower of his obligation to repay.</p>\n<p>Either way, the practical result is as summed up by Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.9.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Shemitah v'Yovel 9:28</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַמַּחֲזִיר חוֹב שֶׁעָבְרָה עָלָיו שְׁבִיעִית רוּחַ חֲכָמִים נוֹחָה הֵימֶנּוּ. וְצָרִיךְ הַמַּלְוֶה לוֹמַר לַמַּחֲזִיר מַשְׁמִיט אֲנִי וּכְבָר נִפְטַרְתָּ מִמֶּנִּי. אָמַר לוֹ אַף עַל פִּי כֵן רְצוֹנִי שֶׁתְּקַבֵּל יְקַבֵּל מִמֶּנּוּ.‏</p>\n<p><strong>Whoever returns a debt after <em>shemitah</em>, the Rabbis are pleased with him. The lender needs to say to the borrower, \"I cancel it, and you are under no obligation to me\".

Does <em>shemitat kesafim</em> annul the loan, or merely forbid the lender from claiming?</strong></h2>\n<p>The simple implication from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.9.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Shemitah v'Yovel 9:4</a> is that the loan is annulled.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּכְשֶׁתִּשְׁקַע חַמָּה בְּלֵילֵי רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה שֶׁל מוֹצָאֵי שְׁבִיעִית אָבַד הַחוֹב:‏</p>\n<p>When the sun sets on the evening of Rosh HaShanah following <em>shemitah</em>, <strong>the debt is lost</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is further indicated by his ruling in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.9.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">9:28</a> that if a borrower nonetheless wishes to returns a loan after <em>shemitah</em>, he should stress that he is doing so as a gift, rather than as a repayment of any loan that continues to exist.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאַל יֹאמַר לוֹ בְּחוֹבִי אֲנִי נוֹתֵן לְךָ אֶלָּא יֹאמַר לוֹ שֶׁלִּי הֵם וּבְמַתָּנָה אֲנִי נוֹתֵן לְךָ:‏</p>\n<p>He should not say, \"I am giving it to you to repay my debt\", rather he should say, \"<strong>It is mine, and I am giving it to you as a gift</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45042&st=&pgnum=228\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yere'im 278</a> (in the old edition) argues that in fact, the debt does continue to exist, and it is simply prohibited for the lender to claim it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה לי דשמיטה דקרא אינה מחילה, אלא ציווה הקב\"ה שישמיט, פירוש: יניח, ולא יתבענו עד שיתן לו מעצמו, דכתיב 'שמוט' ו'לא יגוש', שכל 'שמיטה' הכתוב בקרא הנחה ולא מחילה, דכתיב 'והשביעית תשמטנה ונטשתה', פירוש: תניח. הלכך, הלוואה לעולם מוטלת על הלווה, שלא יעכב על זה חובו לעולם בתיבתו לאוצרו, ואם עשה כן, הוה ליה 'לוה רשע'‏</p>\n<p>It seems to me the שמיטה in the verse is not 'forgiving', rather G-d commanded שישמיט, meaning, 'he should leave' and not claim it, until he [the borrower] gives it on his own. As it states, \"Leave\" and \"Do not press\". Because שמיטה always means 'leaving' and not 'forgiving', as it is written, \"And in the seventh year leave it and abandon it\", meaning \"leave it\". Therefore, <strong>the loan continues to exist as a debt against the borrower</strong>, and he should not keep this debt forever in his closet or treasury, and if he does this, he is a 'wicked borrower'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that even in Rambam's view, although the debt is totally annulled and there is no obligation on the borrower to return, if he nevertheless chooses to do so (as a gift) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sabbatical_Year_and_the_Jubilee.9.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Sages are pleased with him</a>.</p>\n<p>Note further, that even in Yereim's view, that the debt still technically exists, the borrower will never be forced by a court to repay; rather the court will force the lender to renounce his claims - see the end of part 2 for details.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Does <em>shemitat kesafim</em> happen automatically</strong>?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11786&st=&pgnum=237\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mordechai, Gittin 527 (380, in the new editions)</a> (quoting R. Avigdor HaCohen) argues that it does take place automatically.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לענין השמטת כספים קבלתי, שהשביעית משמטת מאליה, אע\"פ שלא אמר 'משמט אני', אלא מצוה הוא דרמיא עליה באמירה, דכתיב 'וזה דבר השמטה'... זכר לדבר: נולד לו בכור בעדרו מצוה להקדישו, אע\"פ שכבר קדוש מאליו משעת לידה</p>\n<p>With regards to <em>shemitat kesafim</em> I have received a tradition that <strong>the <em>shemitah</em> year cancels loans automatically, even if the lender does not say \"I cancel\"</strong>. Rather, there is a commandment for him to state it, as is written, \"This is the matter [lit. word] of the <em>shemitah</em>\" ... This is similar to the case of a firstborn animal being born in one's flock, where there is a commandment to sanctify it [verbally], even though it is automatically sanctified from the time of its birth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Yereim.164.4?vhe=Sefer_Yereim_HaShalem,_Vilna,_1892-1901&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yere'im 164</a> (in the new editions) argues, claiming that nothing happens without the lender's declaration.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחוב שעבר עליו שביעית, אינו רשאי לוה לעכבו אלא על פי מלוה, שכל זמן שלא השמיטו מלוה, חייב לפרוע, אלא לוה יזמין מלוה לדין, שישמיט לו חובו כאשר צוה היוצר, ובית דין יחייבו למלוה לומר 'משמיט אני' ... ואם אינו רוצה המלוה לומר 'משמיט אני', יכפוהו בית דין</p>\n<p>Regarding a debt after the <em>shemitah</em> year, the borrower may not keep it without the say-so of the lender. <strong>Until the lender declares it to be annulled, the borrower is obligated to repay it.</strong> Rather, the borrower should invite the lender to court for the purposes of cancelling the loan as the Creator commanded, and the court will oblige the lender to say \"I cancel\" ... And if the lender does not want to say \"I cancel\" the court will force him to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(It seems to me that this is consistent with his position described above in part 1; if the loan continues to exist, then the borrower needs to make efforts to repay it, unless and until the lender has formally stated that he does not intend to press for collection of the debt.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This answer is only an add-on to Joel's.

Couldn't he just have told her to make food (in general or in specific) and let her collect the ingredients?</p>\n<p>The commentators discuss why \"cakes\" (for speed's sake) and why he tells her to knead the bread (to avoid it's turning into chametz) but I haven't seen anyone discuss why he needed to tell her the amount, or, more precisely, why he assumed she wouldn't know the right amount.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Being that you provided answers for the preparation of cakes and kneading, I will try to answer why he told her to make three Se'ah of flour:</p>\n\n<p>(Mefarshim <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/18.6#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Your question is valid according to most mefarshim, who say that she was supposed to take only the purest flour from these three se'ah (1/3 of an Ephah, a tremendous amount), until it would reach a more reasonable (smaller amount).  According to them, we would have to say that he was specifying such a large amount so she would know how pure the flour should be.</p>\n\n<p>However, Shadal suggests on a Peshat level that the loaves were very large so they could take the bread with them.  If so, he needed to specify how large they should be.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Radak says that he told her to bake three Se'ah-sized loafs, one for each guest.  That is because it was in an honorable fashion, but much more than would regularly be required for three guests.  See also Rabbeinu Bachya/Bechayei, who expand(s) on this theme of 'three for honor'.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Hirsch implies that this laughter was from the same root cause as the laughter that overtook Avraham when Hashem first told him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/18.12#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav David Tzvi Hoffman</a> points out that Sarah had not been told the prophecy that Avraham had earlier been given, so it was a complete shock to her. At this point, they did not yet know that the <em>guests</em> were malachim and thought that they were normal travelers expressing the wish that Avraham and Sarah would receive a blessing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הגם שאברהם כבר נתבשר על הולדת בן לשרה, הרי היא עצמה לא שמעה עדיין על כך, <strong>והנה שרה צוחקת</strong>, אמנם לא בקול, אבל לפחות בקרבה, בלבה, כי הרי לא ידעה, שבשורה זו מפי ה׳ יצאה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>She denied it in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#v=15&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayera 8:15</a> because</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She was afraid that she had offended the guest by laughing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed while <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8212/jewish/Chapter-17.htm#v=17&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lech Lecha 17:17</a> is translated (like Onkelos) at Chabad.org as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Abraham fell on his face and rejoiced, and he said to himself,\n\"Will [a child] be born to one who is a hundred years old, and will\nSarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates it as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi says that the expression of <em>doubt</em>, is because they found it hard to accept that they would merit such a great miracle. As Rashi says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Will [a child] be born to on, etc.:</strong> There are questions which are positive assertions, like (I Sam. 2:27): הֲנִגְלֹה נִגְלֵיתִי, “Did I appear?” [meaning: “of course I appeared!”]; (II Sam. 15:27): הֲרֹאֶה\nאַתָּה, “Do you see?” [meaning: “of course you see!”] This too is a positive assertion, and so did he say to himself, “Was such kindness done to anyone else, that the Holy One, blessed be He, is doing for me?”</p>\n<p><strong>and will Sarah, who is ninety years old:</strong> Shall she be worthy of giving birth? Now although the first generations begot children at the age of five hundred, in Abraham’s time, the years were already lessened, and weakness had come to the world. Go out and learn this\nfrom the ten generations from Noah to Abraham, who hastened to beget children at the age of sixty and seventy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates this as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then Abraham fell on his face and ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains in detail why the laughter occurred.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In any case צחק is produced only by noticing something which strikes\nas ridiculous. But where in the whole world, is there any greater\nabsurd contradiction than the expectation that a hundred year old man\nand his ninety year old wife, who have never had a child in the course\nof their long married life, now, practically at the end of their\nlives, should get a son! And then, to expect a great, world-conquering\nnation to arise, to place the hopes of the whole future of mankind on\nthis late-born only child -- whose very existence was not to be\nexpected, and in any case would be early orphaned! That surely is --\nonly taking the ordinary natural course of events into consideration\n-- an absolute absurdity, placing the very greatest expectations on the very smallest, almost non-existent beginning.</p>\n<p>This contrast was so great that even an Abraham, with all his full\nconfidence in Hashem -- as was shown by his falling on his face --\ncould not help laughing at the absurdity of himself and Sarah still\ngetting a baby. And this laughter was -- and is -- so important that\nit is again brought into prominence with Sarah and was to be perpetuated for all future generations in the name of the promised\nchild.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>A few answers:</p>\n<p>1). Maharsha (Chiddushei Agaddot): She did not yet actually have niddah - that was after the Beracha; however, Avraham was careful to not only have regular food as Tahor (pure), he also held of the opinion that a lady is impure מעת לעת therefore the angels told Avraham not to eat the bread because she would become a niddah later that day (perhaps this is part of the Bracha) and so Sarah didn't know she was פרס נדה.</p>\n<p>2). Maharal (Gur Aryeh): That she stopped having regular cycles (ארח כנשים) the word ארח would mean a regular cycle, but rather like an elderly lady which can happen. And in fact this demonstrated something totally abnormal compared to young women.</p>\n<p>3). Me: The Gemara Niddah 21b says א׳׳א פתיחת הקבר בלא דם. Ie: Perhaps Sarah felt her קבר open and even if there was no blood seen - she had held that she is Tamei. So she knew there is a chance or that she is for sure Tamei but still perhaps \"impossible\" for her to have a child since there was no actual blood - and maybe this is why it says here in Rashi that she <strong>does</strong> have ארח כנשים because her womb opened with blood - but later the Torah reports, she says she <strong>doesn't</strong> have ארח כנשים because she didn't realize there was indeed blood. And this is why we are using ארח here vs with רחל it mentions דרך (maybe).</p>\n<p>(Baruch She'Kivanti) the Re'eim says something similar, that she felt her body return to having Niddah (ie: heavy limbs etc..) but not blood. So she was careful to keep the laws of Niddah but didn't think should could have a child.</p>\n<p>4). Me: Perhaps Sarah had a slight misunderstanding in the Beracha: it says</p>\n<p>ויאמר שוב אשוב אליך <strong>כָעֵת</strong> חיה...ושרה שמעת פתח האהל</p>\n<p>Rough Translation: I will return to you like at this living moment... and Sarah heard from the opening of the tent.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, Sarah misheard/misunderstood כָעֵת חיה and heard כְעֵת. The difference is that the first is she will have a child <strong>like the</strong> same moment (ie: next year at that time). However Sarah misheard with a Shevah, and it means, the amount of time it takes to have a child (Rashbam/Radak). If so she understood the Beracha is impossible (even for a young girl) since she just had a נדה. Avraham would separate for approx 2 weeks. The issue: a). A Beracha would be a perfect pregnancy and this would not be a complete pregnancy by definition (since it would need to be the time it takes to birth; however minus two weeks) and so she thought it must be incorrect. Similarly, perhaps she knew Yitzchak was connected to Pesach, and so either he would be conceived or born on Pesach and now both are impossible.</p>\n<p>Support: It comments she was at or heard from the opening of the tent, ie: not directly, implying she misheard. And Hashem repeats the Beracha in verse 14 it states explicitly למועד אשוב, meaning that time of year (ie: Pesach) - ie: Hashem clarifies it is the same type of moment (ie: this was mistaken originally) and restates כָעֵת חיה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong><em>Rav Yosef Yehudah</em></strong>, the son of the Sorotzkin Rebbe, gives I think a nice explanation to this question in his <em>sefer</em> <strong><em>Magged Yosef</em></strong>. Long story short, she wasn't surprised. She was faking it, as will be explained.</p>\n\n<p>The verses in discussion are as follows (<strong><em>Genesis</em></strong> 18:10, 12, 13, 15):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר שוב אשוב אליך כעת חיה והנה-בן לשרה אשתך ושרה שמעת פתח האהל <strong>והוא אחריו</strong>: ותצחק שרה <strong>בקרבה</strong> לאמר אחרי בלתי לי עדנה ואדני זקן: ויאמר יקוק אל אברהם למה זה צחקה שרה לאמר האף אמנם אלד ואני זקן: ותכחש שרה לאמר לא צחקתי כי <strong>יראה</strong> ויאמר כי צחקת</p>\n  \n  <p>[The Angel] said: “I will surely return at this time [next year] and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son”. Sarah [in the meantime] was listening at the entrance to the tent, and <strong>he/it</strong> was behind <strong>him</strong>. Sarah laughed <strong>within</strong>, saying: “After no longer having my period? As well, my husband is old?!” Hashem said to Avraham, why is it that Sarah laughed, saying: “Is it true that I’ll give birth, since I am old?” Sarah denied [this], and said, “I didn’t laugh!” because she was <strong>afraid</strong>. He said: “Actually, you laughed”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To answer this question, some ambiguities of the story/the verses need be clarified. There’s a strange part in verse 10, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושרה שמעת פתח האהל <strong>והוא אחריו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It means that Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which makes sense. The next two words however, are ambiguous. It says “he” was behind “him”. Who was behind who? <strong><em>Rashi</em></strong> explains<sup>1</sup> that “he” is referring to the entrance (since there is no “it” in Hebrew, it refers to the entrance in masculine). He also explains “him” is the Angel that was speaking. Therefore, the verse is telling us that the Angel didn’t see Sarah listening behind him. According to this explanation, what does this detail add to the story? The Angel shouldn’t have minded Sarah listening, especially since he was talking about her. Why do we need to know this?</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Targum \"Yonasan\"</em></strong><sup>2</sup> has an interesting translation of the last two words, not like <strong><em>Rashi</em></strong>. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וישמעאל קאי בתריה וצית מה דאמר מלאכא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yishmael, Avraham’s son from Sarah’s maidservant Hagar, was listening as well behind the Angel. He was listening to what the Angel was saying. The <strong><em>Targum Yerushalmi</em></strong><sup>2</sup> says the same, based on the <strong><em>Midrash</em></strong><sup>3</sup>. With this explanation, Sarah’s reaction can be understood. Sarah saw Yishmael listening, and was worried he would become upset at the news of her having a son. Until now, Yishmael had the status as Avraham’s first born. Hashem promised once Yitzchak is born, he’ll become the main son<sup>4</sup>. Previously<sup>5</sup>, <em>Chazal</em> taught us that Sarah cast <em>ayin hara</em> on Hagar, causing her to miscarry. Sarah was worried Yishmael would do the same to her, as revenge for her mother. This is why she laughed. She believed the news was true, but she hoped Yishmael wouldn’t take it seriously if she appeared to laugh at the Angel.</p>\n\n<p>This fits very nicely with the strange words ותצחק שרה <strong>בקרבה</strong>, literally “she laughed with her innards”<sup>6</sup>. Rashi explains<sup>7</sup> that she “looked” at her innards in disbelief and <strong>said</strong>: “how could this womb carry a child?” It sounds like she said this out loud. The reason would be because Yishmael was listening in. <em>Chazal</em> teach us<sup>8</sup> that the Egyptian King Ptolemy ordered seventy Sages to translate the Torah into Greek (known today as the Septuagint). <em>Chazal</em> list different changes the Sages made in their translation<sup>9</sup>, since the literal translation would appear problematic to the uninitiated. Instead they translated it according to the proper interpretation. This verse is one of the changes. Instead of ותצחק בקרבה, they translated it as ותצחק בקרוביה, she laughed with her relatives. Meaning, Yishmael.</p>\n\n<p>With that explanation for why she laughed, why was Hashem upset at her? He knew her intentions were proper. The reason is because according to the strict <em>middas hadin</em>, letter of the law, she showed a lack of <em>bitachon</em>, faith in Hashem. He promised her she would have a child; what was there to be afraid of? Someone of her stature should have had full faith that all would go as foretold. This is why she responded with לא צחקתי כי יראה, I didn’t laugh, rather I was afraid. She meant she believed she would have a child. At the same time, she was afraid of Yishmael. Hashem responded<sup>10</sup> that she still laughed. Despite her faith, it was not complete.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> To <strong><em>Genesis</em></strong> 18:12</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <em>Ad. loc.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> <strong><em>Bereishis Rabbah</em></strong> 48:16. This explanation is also brought by the <strong><em>Chizkuni</em></strong> <em>ad. loc.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup> <strong><em>Genesis</em></strong> 17:19</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup> <strong><em>Ibid</em></strong> 16:6</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup> <strong><em>Ibid</em></strong> 18:12</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup> <em>Ad. loc.</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup> <strong><em>Megillah</em></strong> 9a</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup> It was a miracle that they all separately made the same changes</p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup> <strong><em>Cf.</em></strong> <strong><em>Targum Yonasan</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ramban</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ohr HaChaim</em></strong> <em>ad. loc.</em></p>\n\n\n",

This last point also emphasizes the importance of saying the words clearly and distinctly when you learn or pray. If you mumble or slur, that could be exactly how G-d communicates back to you, measure for measure.</p>\n\n<p>The text of the prophets we have is how the prophet put his communication into words.

For example, if a site requires you to be 21 and asks, “Are you over 21?” And you're not, but select “yes”. Is there any problem with doing so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Prohibition_to_Lie#cite_ref-48\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> will give insight into possible answers to you questions.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, one should avoid lying as the Torah instructs (Shemos 23:7), מִדְּבַר שֶׁקֶר תִּרְחָק.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, there are exceptions when for a purpose. For example, (from that article):</p>\n\n<p>One who is shipping fragile objects such as matzah can write the word \"glass\" on the box in order that it should be dealt with properly.

Ashi: See, sir, a Rabbinical disciple. whose\nname is R. Huna b. Hiwan — others state, R. Huna b. Hilwon — who took\npeel of garlic,13 placed it in the bung hole of a barrel, and\nasserted, 'My intention is to put it away [here].'14 He also went and\ndozed in a ferry and thus crossed to the other side and looked after\nhis fruit, asserting, 'My intention was to sleep.' Said he to them,\nYou speak of an artifice: it is an artifice [in connection with] a\nRabbinical [interdict].15 and a disciple of the Rabbis will not come\nto do this at the very outset.16</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li><p>Jast. R. Han.: a head of garlic.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>But actually it was to prevent the wine from running out, and thus he repaired the barrel, as it were.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For even if he did these without an artifice he would only violate a Rabbinical, not a Scriptural interdict.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Without an artifice — hence he does nothing wrong</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that  הערמה consists in allowing a rabbinically forbidden action with an excuse. It is allowed where we can trust that the person who does it will not come to transgress the  forbidden action without the excuse.</p>\n<p>Why should a  הערמה be allowed and what are the guidelines?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Our Sages teach a general principle in Mishnah Eruvin 10:15</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן אוֹמֵר, מְקוֹם שֶׁהִתִּירוּ לְךָ חֲכָמִים,\n  מִשֶּׁלְּךָ נָתְנוּ לְךָ </p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi  Shimon says, \"[Whatever] the Sages permitted, they [only] gave\n  you [permission to do] what is yours [not forbidden by the Torah]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, the Sages forbid carrying in a <em>karmalis</em> (such as a field or forest) because it appears similar to public property. Then, they give a \"heter\" to allow carrying there if an Eiruv is erected. Basically, a qualified scholar marks the area to make an abstract distinction concrete for the unlearned.</p>\n\n<p>As a general rule (and there are certainly exceptions) a mature scholar who understands the true halachic distinction may use \"tricks\" or \"excuses\" to permit something that is truly permitted anyway. In other words, these may only be used to avoid rabbinic prohibitions that stem from a concern for appearance.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the general public is sometimes advised to use a haaramah where the Sages are concerned that without a heter they will come to transgress.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, one may not use a loophole to avoid a true obligation, even when such a loophole might be effective.</p>\n\n<p>For a detailed discussion with examples see <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/encyclopedia/value.asp?id1=72\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R. Hershel Schachter in his Be'Ikvei HaTzon cites Bekhorot 3b as proof that one is not allowed to exempt himself from a mitzvah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רב מרי בר רחל הו\"ל ההיא חיותא, הוה מקנה לאודנייהו לעובד כוכבים ואסר\nלהו בגיזה ועבודה ויהיב להו לכהנים, וכלאי חיותא דרב מרי בר רחל, וכו'\nמשום דמפקע להו מקדושתייהו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R. Mari b. Rahel possessed a herd of animals. He used to transfer [to a heathen] possession of the ears [of the firstlings while still in the womb]... The herd of R. Mari b. Rahel died... Because he deprived them of their holiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, others note that this case may be different because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>One is subverting the sanctity of the animal, not only exempting oneself from a mitzvah; perhaps only subversion of sanctity is problematic.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>According to one opinion in the Gemara, R. Mari was only punished because others who were ignorant of the relevant laws would learn from his example, but otherwise one would be allowed to exempt himself from a mitzvah (see R. Tzvi Pesach Frank, Har Tzvi al HaTorah, Ki Tisa; compare Maharsha cited above).\nIt would seem reasonable that this question is also related to the Gemara in Menachot 41a (and indeed R. Schachter cites this Gemara as well).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another passage that relates to this question is Berakhot 35b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמר רבה בר בר חנה אמר רבי יוחנן משום רבי יהודה ברבי אלעאי: בא וראה\nשלא כדורות הראשונים דורות האחרונים; דורות הראשונים היו מכניסין\nפירותיהן דרך טרקסמון - כדי לחייבן במעשר, דורות האחרונים מכניסין\nפירותיהן דרך גגות דרך חצרות דרך קרפיפות - כדי לפטרן מן המעשר; דאמר רבי\nינאי: אין הטבל מתחייב במעשר עד שיראה פני הבית</p>\n<p>Rabbah b. Bar Hanah further said in the name of R. Johanan reporting\nR. Judah b. Ila'i: Observe the difference between the earlier and the\nlater generations. The earlier generations used to bring in their\nproduce by way of the kitchen-garden purposely in order to make it\nliable to tithe, whereas the later generations bring in their produce\nby way of roofs or courtyards or enclosures in order to make it exempt\nfrom tithe. For R. Jannai has said: Untithed produce is not subject to\ntithing until it has come within sight of the house, since it says.\nI have put away the hallowed things out of my house. R. Johanan,\nhowever, says that even [sight of] a courtyard imposes the obligation,\nas it says, That they may eat within thy gates and be satisfied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This Gemara seems to imply that it is a discredit to the later generations that they avoided the obligation. R. Kook in his Ein Ayah (on the Gemara in Berakhot) comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ההבדל שיש בין המכיר ערך המצות ותכליתן הנשגבה וחפץ בהן באמת ובין מי\nשעבודתו היא רק מצות אנשים מלומדה הוכן להיות יוצא אל הפועל בהרבה מצות\nמן התורה, שנמצאו בהם דרכים ע\"פ דין תורה להפקיע החיוב מעצמו. אמנם רק\nבזה יוודע שלימות העובד מאהבה, בהיות לאל ידו לפטור עצמו ובהיותו מכיר את\nערך המצוה וקדושתה הוא נכנס להתחייב בה. ע\"כ במצות מעשרות, שהיא המצוה\nהראשית המחזקת את כל אושר הכלל כולו, בהיותה לברית בין המיוחדים לעבודת\nד' שבט הלוי ובין כל העם כולו, דאגה החכמה האלהית ביותר שתהי' נעשיח ע\"פ\nרוח נדיבה המכרת את ערכה הגדול. ע\"כ נתנה מקום להחלץ ממנה [ע\"י] הכנסה\nדרך גגות חצירו' וקרפיפות, למען שתגיע הרגשת העושה לעשות המצוה מיקרת רוח\nונפש נדיבה, שבזה תצא אל הפועל תכליתה להשלים את הכלל כולו כחפץ האדון\nהשם יתברך.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=408&ArticleID=952\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a discussion of הערמה; and see Pesachim 48b:\nאמר רב יוסף הני נשי דידן נהוג למיפא קפיזא קפיזא [רש\"י: שלשת לוגין לחומרא לשומרו מן החימוץ] לפיסחא. א\"ל אביי מאי דעתיך לחומרא? חומרא דאתי לידי קולא הוא, דקא מפקע לה מחלה; and see R.

    "content": "# Why did Ralbag's commentary to Leviticus take so much longer than the other books of the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the end of each book in his Commentary to the Torah, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> gives us the date he completed it.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the book of Genesis he tells us that it was completed in October of 1329:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה היתה השלמת זה הספר בי\"ז יום לירח מרחשון בשנת תשעים לאלף הששי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end of the book of Exodus he tells us that it was completed in August of 1330:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובכאן נשלם הביאור בזה הספר והיתה השלמתו בראש חודש אלול שנת תשעים לפרט\n  האלף הששי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end of the book of Numbers he tells us that it was completed in December of 1337:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיתה השלמתו בכ\"ג לחדש טבת של שנת צ\"ח לאלף הששי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end of the book of Deuteronomy he tells us that the entire Commentary to the Torah was completed in January of 1338:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיתה השלמתו בכ\"ג לירח שבט של שנת צ\"ח לפרט האלף הששי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, at the end of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bereshit_(parsha)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Parshat Bereishit</a> he tells us that the commentary to just that section (which takes up about a third of the entire commentary to the book of Genesis) was completed in August of 1328:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה היתה השלמתו בסוף חדש אב משנת השמנים ושמונה לפרט האלף הששי ליצירה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you might have noticed, I skipped the date of completion for the commentary to the book of Leviticus. This is because he doesn't seem to have mentioned it.</p>\n\n<p>So based on the above we have the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It took him about 14 months to get from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noach_(parsha)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Parshat Noach</a> to the end of the book of Genesis.</li>\n<li>It then took him about 10 months to get from there to the end of the book of Exodus.</li>\n<li>It then took him about 7 years and four months to get from there to the end of the book of Numbers.</li>\n<li>It then took him about 1 month to get from there to the end of the book Deuteronomy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are also two more bits of information that Ralbag mentions in these concluding statements:</p>\n\n<p>At the end of Parshat Bereishit he says that he wrote it in a very short period of time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיתה השלמתו בזמן קצר מאד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, at the end of the book of Numbers he says that he wrote it in a very short period of time, without access to books, and it therefore requires a second review:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והשלמנוהו בזמן קצר מאד ובזולת ספרים ולזה יצטרך בגזרת ה' לעבור עליו\n  שנית</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, we see that the 7+ years between completing Exodus and completing Numbers was not because of Numbers. Which means that the book of Leviticus is what took all that time.</p>\n\n<p>Considering that all the other books took only a short amount of time (ranging from a month to a bit more than a year), why is it that the book of Leviticus took so much longer? </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is there perhaps something specific about the content of that book\nthat required all those extra years to compose a commentary?</li>\n<li>Do we perhaps know of a particular event during that time period that\nmay have delayed Ralbag?</li>\n<li>Has anyone (Ralbag himself, or later scholars) explained this\nanomaly, or even noticed it?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus question:</strong> Why is Leviticus the only book that does not include the date it was completed, and is this perhaps related to the anomaly of how long it took?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<h2>A couple of speculative suggestions:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Neema H. Adlerblum writes the following in Chapter Two of <em>A Study of Gersonides in his Proper Perspective</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He writes somewhere that he could not go on with his writings \"on\n  account of the calamities of the times which interfered with clear\n  thinking.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She does not provide the source for this statement, but if it was made at some point between August of 1330 and December of 1337 it could possibly explain at least part of the delay in writing the commentary to Leviticus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> In his introduction to his Commentary to the Torah, Ralbag twice mentions his plan to write a commentary to the Talmud:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והחיבור השני הוא שנחבר בגזרת ה' ביאור המסכיות הנכללות בששת הסדרים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואולם הסיבה המביאה להיות סדר אלו הסדרים ומסכיותיהם לפי מה שזכרנו היא\n  מה שנבאר בגזרת ה' בחיבור התלמודיי אשר ייעדנו חיבורו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>About halfway into his commentary to Leviticus, he mentions that there is something that he would like to explain, but it would take too long and the proper place for its discussion is his commentary to the Talmud:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי כי יארכו הדברים יותר מן הראוי היינו מבארים דעתנו בזה ממקומות\n  רבים מדברי רבותינו ז\"ל והיינו מתירים מה שאפשר  שיסופק על זאת ההנחה אלא\n  שזה יותר ראוי שיהיה בחיבורינו התלמודיים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This indicates that the commentary to the Talmud (or at least the part that would have dealt with this issue) was still unwritten.</p>\n\n<p>In his commentary to the beginning of Deuteronomy he says that he explained something in his commentary to Masechet Berachot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואולם לרז\"ל בזה המאמר על צד ההפלגה והגוזמא ויש לו פנים זולת מה שיובן\n  ממנו להמון כמו שבארנו בביאורנו במסכת ברכות על מה שאמרו רז\"ל עקר טורא\n  בת תלתא פרסי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If we assume that the commentary to Masechet Berachot is (part of) the commentary to the Talmud previously mentioned, then this tells us that he had already written (at least part of) it by the time he was writing the beginning of his commentary to Deuteronomy. As mentioned in the question, we know that the commentary to Deuteronomy took only a month to write, and the commentary to Numbers took \"a very short time\"<sup>1</sup> to write. </p>\n\n<p>From these facts we can suggest that Ralbag wrote his commentary to the Talmud (however much of it he actually wrote – none of it has survived) before the commentary to Numbers, and possibly after half of the commentary to Leviticus but certainly after the introduction to the Commentary to the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>If this is the case, we can then suggest that perhaps (part of) the reason why it took so long for Ralbag to complete his commentary to Leviticus is that he may have been devoting that same time to writing his commentary to the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>And to stretch the speculation even further, we can attempt to also answer the bonus question: Perhaps Ralbag specifically did not include the date of completion of the commentary to Leviticus precisely because it was not a continuous work. Unlike the other books where the date of completion minus the date of completion of the previous book might actually represent the time spent on the commentary, by Leviticus it could be misleading to make it seem like it took seven years if in reality he had been working on other things instead during that time.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. In the Ma'aliot edition of the commentary to Numbers the editors appear to argue that from the fact that he does not describe Deuteronomy as taking a very short time, we can derive that Numbers took even less time than Deuteronomy (i.e. even less than a month).</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><sup>האם ניתן בכל זאת לקבל מושג על אותו \"זמן קצר מאד\" שבו נכתב הספר? דומני\n  שאכן ניתן באמצעות השוואה לביאור ספר דברים בסוף ביאור ספר דברים מציין\n  רבינו את תאריך השלמת החיבור כג בשבט ה'צח חודש אחד בלבד לאחר סיום ביאור\n  ספר במדבר ושם אין הרלב\"ג מוסיף שהביאור הושלם בזמן קצר</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>For the most part, Vayikra deals with the intricate laws of korbanos, there is simply a lot of intricate, detailed laws to comment on.  The Malbim has two full volumes on Vayikra compared with a single volume on the other 4 books.  Kodshim as a seder in Shas covers a large amount of material.  So the answer as to why he spent more time on it is probably because of the detail and complexity of the laws of korbanos compared with the stories in the other books.  The Ralbag's writings tend to be verbose and lengthy when the subject matter is complex and difficult to understand.  His Magnum Opus Milchemes Hashem, which printed eds don't include the Astronomy section is massive in of itself.  The Astronomy Section has 100 chapters!</p>\n\n<p>As regards why the time is not mentioned, I would say simply that people are able to keep track of smaller increments of time - I started in Sivan and finished 12 months later - easy to keep track of.  But a 7-year project is harder to have an accurate measure because sometimes review and editing can be considered as part of it, and perhaps he didn't feel he finished it, or he could have not put a date because he didn't want to be a month or two off.</p>\n\n\n",

How this can be explained?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hillel and Shammai represent the last of the Zugos the Pairs of Tannaim.  After them, this period ceased and the next generation could be considered a new period. You could say a transition period between two individuals and having schools without representing one or other person.  So in this respect then there was no such thing as Beit Rebbe Akiva because he didn't represent one school, but a combination of what he learned from his teachers.  There was no longer a single path through a single teacher representing a single tradition.  Rebbe Akiva represented the sum-total of the Oral Torah with different teachings melded into one.  If you follow Rebbe Akiva's line of teachers, he learned from both the academies of Hillel and Shammai.</p>\n\n<p>After Hillel and Shammai passed on, their students continued their teachings. Their students represented their academies and the disagreements between them continued and increased.  The Oral tradition, however, as a complete unit could no longer be encapsulated by even a single academy and that could not be passed on, from one generation to the next, but rather required students from both academies to learn and transmit the tradition.  </p>\n\n<p>So to answer the question Beit Shammai is the academy or school where Shammai's teachings and Oral Torah was passed down and interpreted.  The same is true for Hillel's Academy.  Subsequently, the teachings could no longer be contained in a single academy representing the Rebbe's transmission. You had to go to different Academies to receive and transmit the Oral Torah to your disciples. Thus the age of a single 'school of thought' was over.  After that, no teacher or disciple could claim that the sum-total of the Oral Torah he received was from a single particular school, but rather from a conglomeration of different teachers/schools. </p>\n\n<p>As the OP mentioned, the Braisos - which are Tannaic sources mention Tanna d'Bei Rebbi Yishmael.  But it is not common.  The Gemara is a combination of Aramaic discussion and Tannaic sources.</p>\n\n<p>To answer the second question, when it is mentioned in the name of someone else, that is the originator of the Oral statement.  However, when Beis Hillel or Beis Shammai is the originator, it cannot be directly linked to Hillel or Shammai themselves, but rather the academy in which they taught.</p>\n\n\n",

Indeed this is how the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.22?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Proverbs.22.6.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מצודות דוד on משלי כב:ו</a> interprets the pasuk of חֲנֹ֣ךְ לַ֭נַּעַר.</p>\n<p>As a result this sense of רגילות is one of the underlying reasons why we train children from a young age in the practise of מצוות.</p>\n<p>Quite a few examples have been listed already - but perhaps two more can be listed that show how this sense of routine manifests itself in both the positive and negative sense.</p>\n<p>Both of them centre around your point about getting them \"used to Yom Kippur\"</p>\n<p>in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.82a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מסכת יומא פב</a> we are told that whilst ordinarily children under בר\\בת מצוה do not fast on יום כיפור, they should do so a year or two before they come of age so that they become accustomed to fasting.</p>\n<p>The Mishna there writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התינוקות אין מענין אותן ביוה\"כ אבל מחנכין אותן לפני שנה ולפני שנתיים בשביל שיהיו <strong>רגילין במצות</strong></p>\n<p><em>With regard to the children, one does not afflict them by withholding food on Yom Kippur; however, one trains them one year before or two years before they reach majority, by means of a partial fast lasting several hours, <strong>so that they will be accustomed to fulfill mitzvot</strong>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n<p>Meanwhile the גמרא in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.40b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מסכת עירובין מ</a> speaks about making קידוש in shul on יום כיפור night.  It notes that one cannot recite קידוש on a cup of wine without tasting it immediately after the ברכה has been said (In fact, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.40b.15?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Eruvin.40b.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רש\"י ד\"ה ליתביה לינוקא</a> adds that to do so is a גנאי, a disgrace.). Due to the fact that it is a fast day we obviously would not be able to drink from the cup. Thus, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.40b.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">גמרא</a> suggests offering it to a minor to drink, thereby allowing for the potential to say it. However the גמרא concludes – \"דילמא אתי למסרך\" – <em>“Perhaps he (the child) might become used to it”</em>. As <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.40b.15?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Eruvin.40b.15.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רש\"י</a> explains, should the child drink the wine, he might become acclimatised to such a practise even after he becomes בר מצוה. Therefore, we see from this גמרא that anything that might come to create a negative inclination in the child must be avoided too.</p>\n\n\n",

And then our soul will be prepared to\n  receive the good from the Master of all, which is included in blessing\n  and mercy. And also coming from this is a strong fence and partition\n  to distance oneself greatly from theft and from envy for everything\n  that there is to our neighbor. As we will draw an a fortiori argument\n  (kal vechomer) for ourselves by saying, \"Even with my money that I\n  lent out, the Torah said to release it in the hand of the borrower\n  when the sabbatical year arrives; is it not all the more so that with\n  not stealing and not having envy for that which is his, that it is\n  fitting for me to distance myself to the [other] extreme?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabeinu Avraham ben Harambam also says a similar idea regarding developing a sense of compassion about halfway through the fifth chapter of Hamaspik Leovdai Hashem (translation from the Feldheim edition):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As mentioned earlier, all of the <em>mitzvos</em> concerning the rights of\n  the poor enable us to cultivate generosity and compassion, as well as\n  the trait of abstinence. These are the <em>mitzvos</em> of [...] and keeping\n  the laws of the seventh year regarding produce and loans, as well as\n  the laws of the fiftieth year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While ultimately, the true underlying reason why we keep Shemitah and any other Mitzvah is because Hashem commanded us to, we see at least 2 Rishonim who believed that an additional motivation for the Mitzvah of Shemittah was to help cultivate our sensitivity and compassion for others.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In general, there seems to be a theme of Israel and its land never being enslaved in perpetuity, specifically not for more than six units (days/years depending on the context), corresponding to the six days of creation of the physical universe.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּֽי־לִ֤י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ עֲבָדִ֔ים עֲבָדַ֣י הֵ֔ם אֲשֶׁר־הוֹצֵ֥אתִי אוֹתָ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם אֲנִ֖י ה' אֱ-לֹקיכֶֽם׃</p>\n<p>For it is to Me that the Israelites are servants: they are My servants, whom I freed from the land of Egypt, I am the LORD your God.

For, if a man will speak in abundance,\n  he will surely sin. Because there will be among his words something\n  that is not proper to say. Therefore, one of the signs of the wise is\n  they use few words. It states, “silence is a guard for wisdom.” On the\n  other hand, abundant speech is the sign of foolishness, at is says,\n  “and the voice of the fool is with abundant words.” And the sages\n  already declared that few words indicates great stature and good\n  lineage, as they said, “one of good lineage is the silent one.”</p>\n  \n  <p>The books of ethics recount how a teacher was exceedingly silent, only\n  speaking a little. They asked him, “Why are you so quiet?” He\n  answered, “I dissected this matter of speech and found that it divides\n  into four categories:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>The first – speech that is completely harmful, with no benefit. Like    cursing and foul language. Such speech is a complete\n  stupidity.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The second – speech that has both harm and benefit. For example,    flattering someone to gain something from him, but that praise will<br>\n  anger his enemies that will harm the one being praised. In such a<br>\n  case, one must forgo the benefit and refrain from such speech, as<br>\n  well.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The third—speech that has neither benefit, nor harm. This is regular    speech of laymen: [Discussing news such as] construction of\n  the city    wall, or that a certain palace was erected, describing the\n  beauty of    a certain house, and the abundant crops of a certain\n  country, and    other such permitted speech. Yet, these words are also\n  unnecessary,    and have no benefit.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The fourth—words that are completely beneficial. Such discussion of    wisdom and purpose, and words that are necessary for him to maintain<br>\n  his life and continue his existence. Such matters are fitting to<br>\n  discuss. Thus, whenever I hear words I scrutinize them: and if I find \n  they are from the fourth category, I will speak it, and if they are<br>\n  from the other groups, I keep silent.</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>The masters of ethics replied: study this man and his wisdom, for he\n  defers from three-fourths of speech, and this is wisdom that one\n  should accustom himself.</p>\n  \n  <p>And I say that according to our Torah, speech divides into five\n   categories: </p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>that which we are commanded to speak,</li>\n  <li>the forbidden,</li>\n  <li>the disgusting,</li>\n  <li>the beloved,</li>\n  <li><p>and the permitted.</p>\n  \n  <p>The first group, that which we are commanded to speak: reading the Torah and >  learning and analyzing it. This is a positive commandment: “and you shall \n  speak\n  about them” just like any other commandment. This was already\n  encouraged by so many teachings that this work cannot contain them.</p>\n  \n  <p>The second group, forbidden speech: This is speech that we are warned\n  against, such as bearing false testimony, lying, and tale bearing,\n  libeling, and cursing. Torah verses discuss this group, and it\n  includes foul language and speaking ill of another.  </p>\n  \n  <p>The third group is\n  disgusting speech: These are words that have no benefit for man, nor\n  purpose, such as average speech relating news, happenings, or what\n  some king did in his palace, or why someone died, or why someone\n  became rich. And such words are dubbed “idle chatter” by the wise. And\n  men of excellence try to refrain from such speech. It was said about\n  Rav, student of R. Chiya, that he never spoke an idle word all his\n  days. Included in this category is also a person disparaging a virtue,\n  or extolling a vise, whether moral or intellectual.  </p>\n  \n  <p>The fourth\n  category is the beloved: This is speaking the praise of virtues of\n  intellect or morals, and disparaging vises of both categories. As well\n  as pointing the soul to these virtues through stories and songs, and\n  refraining from bad in these ways. Likewise, to praise great people\n  and to extol their qualities, in order that others appreciate their\n  actions and follow their ways. And to condemn lowly and evil people,\n  so that others despise their deeds and their memory, and distance\n  themselves from them, and will not follow their ways. Some call this\n  “derech eretz” “civility.”  </p>\n  \n  <p>The fifth group, the permitted: This is\n  speech that a person needs for business and his livelihood, to eat,\n  and to drink, and his clothes, and all his needs. This is\n  permitted—not beloved and not despised. Rather, if he wants, he may\n  speak what he wants, and if he desires he may be silent. In this\n  category, it is praiseworthy to be sparing, and ethical works warn\n  against excessive speech. But that which is forbidden or despised,\n  need no elaboration or command: it is obviously worthy to completely\n  refrain from them. However, that which is a command and beloved, if a\n  person could speak of them all his days, this is the best.\n  Nevertheless, these should be accompanied by two conditions. </p>\n  \n  <p>The first: that his actions match his words, as its says, “beautiful are\n  words that come from those who live by them.” About this it says,\n  “learning is not the main thing, rather deeds.” And the wise would say\n  to an ethical person teaching ethics, “teach, and it is fitting for\n  you to teach.” And the prophet states, “Rejoice O righteous in G-d,\n  for the upright it is fitting to praise [Him].” </p>\n  \n  <p>The second: brevity.\n  One should try to have the most content in the least words, not the\n  opposite. As the sages taught, “one should always teach his students\n  concisely.”</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Mr. Walters's answer is quite comprehensive!</p>\n\n<p>There are two other areas that imply limits on freedom of speech. Pirkei Avot 1:17 gives a general admonition towards \"excessive\" speech:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shimon, his son, says, \"All my days I grew up among the Sages, and I\n  did not find anything good for the body except silence. And the\n  exposition [of Torah] is not what is essential, but the action. And\n  whoever increases words brings sin.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The last sentence is hard to understand within the context of the rest of the advice. The first sentence seems to advise not to talk at all. The second implies do more than study. And the third sentence implies if you talk \"too much\", you lead to sin.</p>\n\n<p>Barternura explains the last two concepts:</p>\n\n<p>If you don't practice what you teach, you would have been better off being silent. That seems to be one example of \"excessive speech\". </p>\n\n<p>The second explanation (from Sefaria):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"and anyone who increases words, brings sin\": As such have we found\n  with Chava, who increased words and said, “God said, 'Do not eat from\n  it and do not touch it,'” and added touching, about which she was not\n  forbidden. And the snake pushed her until she touched it and said to\n  her, “In the same way as there is no death from touching, so [too] is\n  there no death from eating.” And from this, she came to sin, as she\n  ate from the fruit. This is what Shlomo said (Proverbs 30:6), “Do not\n  add to His words, lest He reprove you and you be found a liar.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Devarim 23:24 says - \"Watch what comes out from your lips\".</p>\n\n<p>While this expression is related to vows, namely that you must fulfill and commit to your (verbal) vows, (similar to the above that suggests that you should do what you teach), you could probably apply this expression to general behavior. I.e. - speak nicely. If you promise to do something (even if not a \"vow\") you should keep your word.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding vows, one or two verses prior to the one I mentioned says, \"If you cease to vow, there will be no sin\". Again, this is in line with what Pirkei Avot says, \"excessive speech leads to sin\", as in the case of a vow that you can't fulfill!</p>\n\n\n",

Yet, because most of the sages in that place were from Beis Shamai the halacha was decided like Beis Shamai, who were the majority.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer (on Shabbos 17a) explains that although Beis Hillel was the majority, the students of Beis Shamai compelled them to rule their way through arguments. Some of the students of Hillel wanted leave to prevent a ruling, but the some of the students of Shamai stood at the door and did not allow the students of Hillel to leave. Meanwhile, six of the great sages of Beis Shamai went up and convinced the assembled with their arguments to rule like them.</p>\n\n<p>(Added to address OP's comment:)</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of this: The Golden Calf was made due to the fear and void created when they thought Moshe was not going to return. In a similar way, this event was in response to the Roman persecution and leaders of Beis Shamai felt that it was imperative to make decrees distancing the Jews from the Romans to preserve the Jewish People. As is often the case, during desperate times people that otherwise would not agree, go along with desperate measures. And so some of Beis Hillel went along with the decrees.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Adapted from Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch’s explanation (<em>Collected Writings</em>, §VII, “Rabban Gamliel and His Times”, pp. 84–90), who points out that <a href=\"https://sefaria.org/Shabbat.17a.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Shabbos 17a</a> is referring to the same incident:</p>\n\n<p>For various reasons, Beis Hillel was avoiding a binding vote of the Sanhedrin (which was meeting in Chaninah ben Chizkiya ben Garon’s upper-floor study while he was compiling a commentary on the Book of Yechezkel/Ezekiel).</p>\n\n<p>One day, Beis Shammai staged a coup. They came armed and basically said, “Nobody’s leaving until we vote.” The entire Beis Shammai stood guard downstairs with swords and spears, sending up just six of their membership to carry on the debate.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>… they stuck a sword in the study hall, and they said: One who seeks to enter the study hall, let him enter, and one who seeks to leave may not leave, so that all of the Sages will be assembled to determine the halakha. That day Hillel was bowed and was sitting before Shammai like one of the students.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And those six almost persuaded the rest. Beis Shammai tended to appeal to the sharper scholars, and they began with the more persuasive arguments. And though Beis Hillel won in general (see elsewhere on this site for why that was), in the case of eighteen disputes and eighteen enactments Beis Shammai persuaded a majority of the Sanhedrin of their correctness. (Recall that only six of Beis Shammai were partipating in the debate and vote; the rest were downstairs standing guard.)</p>\n\n<p>And those eighteen enactments, the Talmud says, (<a href=\"https://sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.11a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 11a</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הא בתוך שמונה עשרה אפילו גדול אינו מבטל מפני שעמדה להן בנפשותיהן.‏<br>\n  … even a greater court may not annul them, because [Beis Shammai] risked their lives for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hashem's inconsistent responses about Sedom\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <em>parshas Vayeira</em> there is a whole back-and-forth between Hashem and Avraham. Each time Avraham pleaded to save everyone if a certain number of righteous individuals would be found. Each time Hashem conceded, and then Avraham would ask again but with a smaller number of righteous people necessary for salvation.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed some inconsistencies with Hashem's responses, and was wondering if there were any explanations offered by the commentaries.</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 18:26</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה אִם־אֶמְצָ֥א בִסְדֹ֛ם חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים צַדִּיקִ֖ם בְּת֣וֹךְ הָעִ֑יר <strong>וְנָשָׂ֥אתִי</strong> לְכָל־הַמָּק֖וֹם בַּעֲבוּרָֽם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And the LORD answered, “If I find within the city of Sodom fifty innocent ones, <strong>I will forgive</strong> the whole place for their sake.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, Hashem offers to forgive them, implying he won't destroy them. In verse 28, Hashem's response to Avraham is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ <strong>לֹ֣א אַשְׁחִ֔ית</strong> אִם־אֶמְצָ֣א שָׁ֔ם אַרְבָּעִ֖ים וַחֲמִשָּֽׁה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>...And He answered, “<strong>I will not destroy</strong> if I find forty-five there.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In verse 29, Hashem changes his response again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ <strong>לֹ֣א אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֔ה</strong> בַּעֲב֖וּר הָאַרְבָּעִֽים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>...And He answered, “<strong>I will not do it</strong>, for the sake of the forty.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Verse 30 is like 29:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ <strong>לֹ֣א אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֔ה</strong> אִם־אֶמְצָ֥א שָׁ֖ם שְׁלֹשִֽׁים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>...And He answered, “<strong>I will not do it</strong> if I find thirty there.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then in verse 31, Hashem says like he did in verse 28:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ <strong>לֹ֣א אַשְׁחִ֔ית</strong> בַּעֲב֖וּר הָֽעֶשְׂרִֽים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>...And He answered, “<strong>I will not destroy</strong>, for the sake of the twenty.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The final verse, 32, is like 31 and 28:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ <strong>לֹ֣א אַשְׁחִ֔ית</strong> בַּעֲב֖וּר הָעֲשָׂרָֽה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>...And He answered, “<strong>I will not destroy</strong>, for the sake of the ten.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See my comments to Alex's answer.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, many commentaries offer explanations. Link to Mikra'os Gedolos <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/18.29#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The more pshat-focused commentaries note that there is no issue with using a variety of terms that mean the same thing - see for example, Ibn Ezra (who explains \"I will not do - destruction\") and RDZ Hoffman (who notes the changes in language throughout this story) to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/18.29#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18:29</a> and <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/18.30#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18:30</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Kli Yakar (18:28, linked above) suggests (based on Onkelos) that the words \"Lo E'eseh\" refer to God not totally destroying it, but the words \"Lo Ashchis\" refer to any sort of minor destruction.\nTherefore, for numbers that had less of a religious significance, 30 and 40 (see inside for why these are more destructive numbers), God agreed not to totally destroy the cities that contained those numbers of Tzadikim, but they would still be punished to some extent.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch (same link) follows a similar line of thinking, and suggests that the extremes (50/45, and 20, 10) that Avraham asks for are to completely let the city off the hook, whereas the middle ones are for God to take the merits of these people into account, but he will still punish them somewhat. (He offers the opposite understanding as a possibility as well.)</p>\n\n<p>Malbim and Seforno have very detailed understandings where they go on a case-by-case basis, and you can look up their detailed understandings at the link above. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Although it is not mentioned clearly for each case, some of the \"inconsistencies\" are responses to Avraham's language.  For example:</p>\n\n<p>Avraham Asks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אוּלַ֥י יֵ֛שׁ חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים צַדִּיקִ֖ם בְּת֣וֹךְ הָעִ֑יר הַאַ֤ף תִּסְפֶּה֙ <strong>וְלֹא־תִשָּׂ֣א לַמָּק֔וֹם</strong> לְמַ֛עַן חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים הַצַּדִּיקִ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּקִרְבָּֽהּ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hashem Responds</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר י״י֔ אִם־אֶמְצָ֥א בִסְדֹ֛ם חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים צַדִּיקִ֖ם בְּת֣וֹךְ הָעִ֑יר <strong>וְנָשָׂ֥אתִי לְכׇל־הַמָּק֖וֹם</strong> בַּעֲבוּרָֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Avraham Asks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א֠וּלַ֠י יַחְסְר֞וּן חֲמִשִּׁ֤ים הַצַּדִּיקִם֙ חֲמִשָּׁ֔ה <strong>הֲתַשְׁחִ֥ית</strong> בַּחֲמִשָּׁ֖ה אֶת־כׇּל־הָעִ֑יר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hashem Responds:</p>\n\n<p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ <strong>לֹ֣א אַשְׁחִ֔ית</strong> אִם־אֶמְצָ֣א שָׁ֔ם אַרְבָּעִ֖ים וַחֲמִשָּֽׁה</p>\n\n<p>At that point Avraham just asks if certain numbers can be found, and therefore, Hashem does not give consistent responses from that point on.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that many of the alternate versions of this passage have a variant text. Specifically, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samaritan Pentateuch</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Syriac Bible (Peshitta)</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Septuagint</a> all have אשחית/destroy instead of אעשה/do, both in Verse 29 and in Verse 30, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vulgate</a> has אשחית/destroy in verse 29: </p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=SP%7Creference=Gen.18&options=VUNHG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samaritan Pentateuch</a></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Yk6Oj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Yk6Oj.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Samaritan Pentateuch\"></a></p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://cal.huc.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Syriac Bible (Peshitta)</a></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/got58.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/got58.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Syriac Bible (Peshitta)\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Septuagint (<a href=\"http://ecmarsh.com/lxx/Genesis/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brenton translation</a>)</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BTinO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BTinO.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Septuagint\"></a></p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://vulgate.org/ot/genesis_18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vulgate</a></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/C7nF0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/C7nF0.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Vulgate\"></a></p>\n\n<p>It is thus possible that the differences you note wherein אשחית/destroy is exchanged for אעשה/do is simply a corruption of the text, and the original text may have actually had אשחית/destroy each time in Verses 28-32.</p>\n\n\n",

The word chodesh, therefore, primarily refers to the concept of chadash (“new”) or chiddush (“novel” or “renewal”), and specifically denotes the novelty of the month. That chodesh also refers to the idea of a “month” is only a secondary, borrowed meaning. If Chodesh denotes the beginning of the month, then maybe yerach denotes the entire month as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>The Malbim explains that the word yerach simply denotes a period of thirty days — regardless of whether or not those thirty days represent an astronomical event related to the moon. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Aharon Marcus (1843-1916) writes that the word yerach is related to the Hebrew word oraiach (“path”) and to the Aramaic word אתרחיש(“it happened”). He does not explain the thematic link between these words.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hirsch argues that the word chodesh denotes the idea of a month as simply a unit of time (measured by the amount of time it takes the moon’s light to disappear and reappear). In this way, the word chodesh is transcendental, or abstract. On the other hand, he explains, the word yerach connotes the month as a vehicle for maturation. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe (1530-1612), the author of the Levush, writes that the custom is to refer to the month on a divorce document (a get) as a yerach, and on a marriage document (a ketubah) as a chodesh.</p>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <em><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/whats-in-a-word\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's in a Word?</a></em>, \"<a href=\"https://ohr.edu/7791\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Old Month versus New Month</a>\", see also <a href=\"https://biblicalhebrewetymology.com/2019/04/03/tazria-parshas-hachodesh-old-month-versus-new-month/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> page from the Veromemanu Foundation for Biblical Etymology</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The year is governed by the solar cycle.

Therefore, of course it was a valid act\".</p>\n\n<p>So why was that particular language used? Perhaps to show that it was fine b'diavad. He was wealthy and didn't need the money so he returned it to the father after the mitzvah was performed. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112314/jewish/Rabbi-Tarfon.htm?gclid=CjwKCAjw39reBRBJEiwAO1m0ObjjfpZaJvU8RDHVvmvs4vDGI5XwBO2tr1PXoU14TNYoelEPMP-KLRoCkLAQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more information about R' Tarfon.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The essence of the issue the Talmudical Rabbis had with Rabbi Tarfon redeeming and subsequently returning the first born redemption money hinges on the Rabbis’ lawful opinions of such a practice.</p>\n<p>In their first statement they are demonstrating their legal concurrence with his practice.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Eliayhu Russof in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2957&st=&pgnum=263&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yad Eliyahu</a> (note 2) discusses the ramifications of the Rabbis’ concurrence. For what is the question, really, that the Rabbis discussed whether he fulfilled this or not. Because had he not returned the redemption money afterwards he would have certainly fulfilled this properly.</p>\n<p>At first glance one could think that if he didn’t have in mind to return the money, and then later returned it after the fact, this would have been an appropriate way to return the money. As apposed to having a pre-thought to return it, which would not be a plausible strategy.</p>\n<p>However, this too is inconceivable. For after all, once he has accepted the money it becomes his, and he may do with it as he pleases. But since Rabbi Tarfon is cited as ‘this is how he used to deal etc.’, there is an implication that he certainly had in mind to give it back and thus the father’s ‘giving’ of the money may have never been valid at all.</p>\n<p>The answer then must be proved from a similar anecdote in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.50a.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baba Kama 50a</a>, which discuses  Neḥunya’s scheming in giving free wells to the public.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר חפר ופתח ומסר לרבים פטור חפר ופתח ולא מסר לרבים חייב וכן מנהגו של נחוניא חופר בורות שיחין ומערות שהיה חופר ופותח ומוסר לרבים וכששמעו חכמים בדבר אמרו קיים זה הלכה זו הלכה זו ותו לא אלא אימא אף הלכה זו:</p>\n<p>The Sages taught: If someone dug or opened a well and transferred it to the public for their use, he is exempt from damage caused by the well. If he dug or opened a well and did not transfer it to the public, he is liable. And this was the practice of Neḥunya the digger of pits, ditches, and caves, who would dig, open, and transfer them to the public so that there would be wells of water for public use. When the Sages heard about the matter, they said: This individual has fulfilled this halakha. The Gemara asks: Only this halakha and no more? Isn’t it well known that Neḥunya was a great man? Rather, say: He fulfilled even this halakha and did not forget to transfer the wells to the public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is obvious from Neḥunya’s conduct that had in mind to take care of the pits if the public would not accept responsibility over them. And he actually accepted upon himself an intrinsic responsibility to cover them up and the likes, should the public reject such responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Such is the nature of the case regarding Rabbi Tarfon’s practices of fulfillment of the law. He had in mind certain conditions that he is accepting the money such that it is qualifies for the father’s obligation. However, his stipulation extends that if he wants to give the father a gift later on, he may do so out of the goodness of his heart and with no interposition to the father’s obligation.</p>\n<p>It thus comes out that Rabbi Tarfon and Neḥunya followed a pious mindset, and did not want to benefit from others similar to the practice mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma_39a.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 39a</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכאן ואילך נשתלחה מאירה בעומר ובשתי הלחם ובלחם הפנים וכל כהן מגיעו כפול <strong>הצנועין מושכין את ידיהן</strong> והגרגרנין נוטלין ואוכלין</p>\n<p>From then onward, a curse was sent upon the omer, and to the two loaves, and to the shewbread, that there were not sufficient quantities to give each priest a full measure. Therefore, each priest received just an amount the size of a bean; the discreet, <strong>pious ones would withdraw their hands,</strong> a bean-bulk being less that the quantity needed to properly fulfill the mitzva, and only the voracious ones would take and eat it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the wording used ‘that he has nonetheless fulfilled the law’, is used to tell you that this teaching was brought to learn that both Rabbi Tarfon and Neḥunya fulfilled the essence of the law and that we may apply their practice in practice.</p>\n<p>The rest is just Talmudic idiom; that should be obvious.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# \"אלו ואלו דברי א' חיים\" vs \"נעשית תורה כשתי תורות\" with examples\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In numerous Halachic disputes I spotted two contradicting approaches:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>\"אלו ואלו דברי א' חיים\"</strong> - both approaches are legitimate and stem from the [one] living G-d.

I think you're misunderstanding when to apply Eilu v'Eilu.  Not every dispute is an \"Eilu v'Eilu\" dispute. Lampert lists that Eilu v'Eilu is listed twice in the Gemara: Eiruvin 13b, Gittin 6b.  Therefore it seems that it is only applied in those instances and not more generally, according to one view.</p>\n\n<p>According to another view, Eilu v'Eilu applies to all Disagreements found in the Mishnah and Briasos.  In tnis perspective then, the point is that both views are seen as valid, in of themselves.  However, they're not valid halachically since halacha dictates that we follow one opinion. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of the disagreements between Beis Hillel and Beis Shammai, again, you can't follow both schools simultaneously.  As an example, you can't light the same Chanukia and start with both 8 lights and one light simultaneously. Halachically, we make a decision.  That doesn't make Shammai's position less valid, it just makes it practical.</p>\n\n<p>As regards the disagreement between Rabban Gamliel and Rebbi Yehoshua the Gemara is highlighting a point, that even if Rebbi Yehoshua was right at some level, having two dates on which to celebrate Yom Kippur is just impossible to follow.  It means having two calendars to follow.  Again, in terms of practicality we don't allow two versions.  Nonetheless, I don't think you can apply Eilu v'Eilu in this case.  Rebbi Yehoshua believed he was right, but he was actually wrong. Rabban Gamliel's position and calculations was the correct view, regardless of what Rebbi Yehoshua thought. </p>\n\n<p>The last case you'll have to provide a source that this is the case.  Nonetheless, the halachic rule is that we follow the majority in terms of practical application.  So in this case also, regardless of Rebbi Eliezer's position, however valid, the Chachamim's position is the halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

Does this Halacha still apply?</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, one could argue that what the threatener decides to do is none of your business; let him do what he wishes, and you not get involved.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the source that one must give up his life for Avodah Zarah, as per the above-cited Gemara, is Devarim 6:5 - “and you should love Hashem, your G-d...with all your soul.” One could argue that it’s only <em>your</em> soul one is obligated to give up, and you have no right to give up someone else’s soul for your love of Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>What is the Halacha?

So the question should be rephrased in the positive: Are you allowed to worship Avoda zara in order to save your friend?</p>\n\n<p>The Levush (16th century) in Yore Dea 157;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עבודה זרה, דכתיב: \"ואהבת את ה' אלהיך\" וגומר. פירוש: שלא תמירנו בעבודה זרה בכל לבבך ובכל נפשך ובכל מאדך. ומקשינן: אם נאמר \"בכל נפשך\" למה נאמר \"בכל מאדך\"? ואם נאמר \"בכל מאדך\" למה נאמר \"בכל נפשך\"? לכתוב המסתבר טפי וליתי האידך בקל וחומר? אלא אשומעינן: אם יש לך אדם שגופו חביב עליו מממונו – לכך נאמר \"בכל נפשך\". ואם יש לך אדם שממונו חביב עליו מגופו – לכך נאמר \"בכל מאדך\". כלומר: תהא אהבתו חביבה עליך יותר מכל החביב לך.<br>\n  Avoda zara one should not do under any circumstance as it is written \"and you shall love Hashem your G-d with all your soul,heart and wealth etc\" i.e You should not substitute Hashem for a foreign deity. If it says to give up your life why does it need to say to give up your money (rather than worship a foreign deity)? It must be because some people's money is more important than their life, and some people's life is more important than their money. So <strong>the Passuk is saying: Your love of G-d should be more important than everything/anyone that you love</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Levush learns from the parsha of Shema: You are not allowed to betray G-d and worship idols, not even to save your friend who you love more than yourself, because you should love G-d more than anyone or anything.</p>\n\n<p>A clear proof that one should not do a cardinal sin to save someone else's life is in Talmud-Bavli Sanhedrin 75a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מעשה באדם אחד שנתן עיניו באשה אחת והעלה לבו טינא ובאו ושאלו לרופאים ואמרו אין לו תקנה עד שתבעל לו אמרו חכמים ימות ואל תבעל לו There was a person who was about to die and the doctor said the only way to save him is for a certain woman to cohabit with him. The Chachamim said she should leave him to die rather than save him by have relations with him.<br>\n   Beis Yosef YD 157 quotes the Rambam:והרמב\"ם פסק בפ\"ה מהלכות יסודי התורה כמ\"ד פנויה אע\"ג דפלוגתא היא וספק נפשות להקל נראה שעעמו משום דשב ואל תעשה משום פגם משפחה<br>\n  The rambam paskens this is not only talking about a married woman (for which it is a cardinal sin to have relations with the endangered person), if this woman wasn't married she still does not have to act morally depraved to have relations to save the endagered mans life and is not responsible for his death as she is Shev veal taase i.e stationary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

You should be dressed, with your sandals on your feet and your walking stick in your hand. You should eat the meal in a hurry.

The modern Passover meal is modeled primarily on the latter.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>First of all, it's a great question!</p>\n\n<p>The Torah (that is the five books of Moses), simply says that you should eat the meal in great haste.  The translation from Artscroll reads: \"So shall you eat it: your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; you shall eat it in haste - it is a pesach-offering to Hashem.\"</p>\n\n<p>The word in question is \"Chipazon\" which means haste. It is a unique word that doesn't appear too often.  </p>\n\n<p>There is no indication in the text that first Passover, they did not eat lying down.  Their last meal was eaten <em>quickly</em>.  You can certainly eat quickly and be sitting/lying.  The definition here is simply that they ate quickly, gathered all their possessions together and left.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first Passover, there is another Passover mentioned in the Torah - how they celebrated afterwards.  If you look at Deuteronomy 16:1-8, you will see outlined there is a fulfillment of how to celebrate Pesach, post-Exodus.  To achieve the fact the Jews left in haste, we eat unleavened bread (commonly referred to as Matzos), because we left in haste. (Deut 16:3).</p>\n\n<p>Jews, since the first Exodus from Egypt have been celebrating Passover meal by eating unleavened bread (Matzos) as a way of expressing that we left in haste, just as the Torah tells us in Deuteronomy 16:3.  The verse in Exodus 12:11, tells us that G-d Himself told the people <em>at the time of the Exodus</em> to gird their loins, don sandals and eat quickly in haste because they're going to leave that night.</p>\n\n\n",

I will deal mainly with the issues of Kosev relating to an electronic screen.\nThe recent Poskim have different opinions.\nRav Elyashiv who is quoted in שבות יצחק חי\"ב סוף עמ' י\"ז says that it is Biblical. He explains that there is no Petur  of Eino Miskayem (that it isn't lasting forever) which would make it Rabbinic in nature as in it's current state it can currently remain there forever.</p>\n<p>באופן שהכתב\nעל המסך אמור להתקיים בלי התערבות בעל בחירה, הרי זה כתב המתקיים, וכמו\"כ במצלמה עם מסך אם הצורה תמשיך להתקיים כשהאדם ישאר עומד שם כאבן הרי זה כתב המתקיים, והתחדשות הכתב פעמים רבות בשניה אינה מחשיבה את הכתב לאינו מתקיים, כי נחשב כדבר המתחדש באופן טבעי, דמכונה היא כטבעו של עולם</p>\n<p>Rav Wosner in שבט הלוי ח\"ו סי' ל\"ז אות א and Rav Nissim Karelitz in\nחוט שני ח\"א פרק כ ס\"ק א' ד\"ה כתיבה argue a similar point to that of Rav Elyashiv.</p>\n<p>However Rav Shlomo Zalman Aurebach quoted in שולחן שלמה ס\"ק י' ד\"ה אך is of the opinion that it is only Rabbinic in nature. The נשמת שבת סי' ש\"מ אות קל\"ז says that since if one leaves a computer with text on idle, after a couple of minutes the computer will either automatically turn of the screen or a screen saver will turn on. Therefore, it is only Rabbinic in nature as it is only Eino Miskayem (that it isn't lasting forever).</p>\n<p>It could be that the above Poskim who are of the opinion that it is Biblical would agree to what the נשמת שבת says if  the screen will turn off after a while. Additionally, maybe they would agree if one typed on a laptop or smartphone which isn't connected to a power source as the laptop/phone will ultimately turn off by itself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is a famous dispute amongst the major previous generation poskim with regards to Electricity use on Shabbos. All the Orthodox Poskim agree that there is a violation taking place, but the question, as you ask it, is whether it's a Melacha DiOraysa or DiRabanan. Rav Moshe Feinstein, the major Ashkenazi Poseik in America of the previous generation, held that the Isur was an Isur DiRabanan. In contrast, the Chazon Ish, HaRav Avraham Yeshaya Karelitz, of Bnai Brak, held that it was a Milacha DiOraysa to use electricity on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>However, since you were using a buzzing and beeping smartphone, the case may have been different. There is a Kula with regards to Milacha on Shabbos called \"Grama\", causation. This means that you didn't do something, but rather caused a pre-existing Muktza thing to be increased. However, this Kula can only be used in a true Shaas HaDchak. For example, at the Kosel HaMaaravi, there is a constant danger of bombs or gun attacks Rachmana Litzlan. Normal metal detectors buzz when a sufficient amount of metal passes through. This is completing a circuit, which is an issue that may fall into Boneh, building, or Make BiPatish, completing a job. The way around this is metal detectors that have a permanent electrical current running through them, which is displayed by a dial. When someone tries to walk through the detector with a sufficient amount of metal, the dial turns, and security can successfully apprehend the attacker (see the website of the developer, the Tzomet Institute, for more information {<a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=249&ArticleID=100\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=249&ArticleID=100</a>}).</p>\n\n<p>I would argue that the same is true with a smartphone that is already active. As long as you don't push any buttons, it would only be an issue of Grama, as far as I know. However, I recommend asking a Poseik or a Rabbi for a true Psak Halacha to this question. To end off, I would like to share a vignette my 9th grade science teacher, who also happened to be a member of Hatzala, shared with me: as part of his training, he had to take a course in the Halachos of Pikuach Nefesh Doche Shabos, the concept of life-saving overriding the prohibitions of Shabos. On the first day of the course, the instructor asked my teacher: if you were called into a situation in which you had to make an incision into a body, what would you do? My teacher answered by starting to give a whole Drasha as to what he would do: he would do it with his less dominant hand (LiAchar Yad), etc. When he finished, the instructor said: No, you idiot, Pikuach Nefesh! Do whatever you need to! I venture to say that the same concept applies here: if you are truly in doubt about saving a life or getting help in doing so, do what you need to do! Ask the question later, because more often than not, in these types of situations, there isn't enough time to ask the question.</p>\n\n\n",

The idea that a person could struggle with G-d and emerge victorious is ridiculous on its face and betrays a shallow understanding of Judaism.</p>\n<p>In fact, when the story is told over in the book of Hoshea 12:5 the verse is clear that Yaakov fought an angel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וָיָּשַׂר אֶל־מַלְאָךְ וַיֻּכָל בָּכָה וַיִּתְחַנֶּן־לוֹ בֵּית־אֵל יִמְצָאֶנּוּ וְשָׁם יְדַבֵּר עִמָּנוּ׃<br />\nHe strove with an angel and prevailed— The other had to weep and implore him. At Bethel [Jacob] would meet him, There to commune with him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The general translation of שרית here is \"struggled\", but it is also connected to the term שר, which means a ruler or noble, as we also see with the name <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.17.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sarah.</a> See Rashi below for the explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא יעקב [THY NAME SHALL] NO MORE BE CALLED JACOB [BUT ISRAEL] (literally, “not Jacob — supplanting — shall any more be said to thee”) — It shall no longer be said that the blessings came to you through supplanting and subtlety but through noble conduct (שררה) and in an open manner. Because later on the Holy One, blessed be He, will reveal Himself to you at Bethel and will change your name. There He will bless you, and I shall be there and admit your right to them (the blessings). It is to this that the passage refers (Hosea 12:5), “And he strove with an angel and prevailed; he wept and made supplication unto him” — it means the angel wept and made supplication unto him (Jacob). What was the subject of his supplication? This is stated in the next verse: “At Bethel He will meet us and there He will speak with us — implying the request. “Wait until he will speak with us there, and then I will admit your right to the blessings.” Jacob, however, would not agree to this, and against his own wish he had to admit his right to the blessings. That is what is meant when it states (v. 30) “And he declared him blessed there”, that he begged him to wait and he did not agree to do so (cp. Genesis Rabbah 78:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the proper translation of the verse would be</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּאמֶר לֹא יַעֲקֹב יֵאָמֵר עוֹד שִׁמְךָ כִּי אִם־יִשְׂרָאֵל כִּי־שָׂרִיתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִים וְעִם־אֲנָשִׁים וַתּוּכָל׃<br />\nAnd he said: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob [connoting gaining of the blessings by deception (akvah)], but Yisrael; for you have contended (saritha) with elohim (the angel of Esau) and with men [Esau and Lavan] and you have prevailed.     <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.29?ven=The_Rashi_chumash_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[From Sefaria]</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yisroel refers to Yashar-El as in straight with G-d.  The Yud is a reference to the the nature of Yisroel - Yisroel is locked in battle with his Yetzer Hara / the forces of Evil in this world.  It will only end in the times of Moshiach/The World to Come, when the forces of Good will prevail.  In this sense the Yud represents the future - that Yisrael will prevail in the future and be considered Upright with G-d. Notice how the name is in reference to G-d's name as used as a single force in the world - KEl.  This is reference to din, or judgment.  Din is Divine Justice - meaning in the future, when G-d's true justice is carried out, it will be clear that there will be Only One G-d, who will be righteous in judgment and Yaakov's progeny will be considered G-d's people - hence the phrase - Yashar-El.</p>\n\n<p>The only person in this period that has two names that are both used in Yaakov/Yisrael.  Yaakov means the heal.  Just like the yud represents the future - so too, in the future, Yaakov will be vindicated, and be shown to be the rightful heir to the berachos and right of the first born.  In the future - the heal will be shown to be really the head.  Symbolically, the heal is revealed when you take off your shoes. The Neshama is compared to the foot and the shoe compared to the body, hence when we enter into service to G-d (Kohanim take off their shoes), we take off our shoes symbolically revealing our Neshama.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, our heals will be revealed - i.e. it will be shown that Yaakov will be vindicated - that his true nature - i.e. that of the quintessential human being - totally in service of His creature will be revealed and the light of his Neshama will fill the world.  It will be clear to everyone who is G-d's chosen people, through the heal - the revealing of our souls.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can understand the duality in Yisrael/Yaakov being reflective of championing over the yetzer hara, and revealing that inner greatness only in the future.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>YiSRaEL (יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל) is an Acronym formed from letters of its Meaning (כִּֽי־שָׂרִ֧יתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִ֛ים)</strong> :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Ki (כִּֽי) provides the [Yod].</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sarit (שָׂרִ֧יתָ) provides the [Shin + Reish].</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Im-Elohim (עִם־אֱלֹהִ֛ים) provides the [Alef + Lamed].</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>As an Acronym, YiSRaEL (יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל) defines itself (כִּֽי־שָׂרִ֧יתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִ֛ים).

The punishment for transgressing any of the Noachide laws is death by sword (with a few exceptions) (ibid).</p>\n\n<p>He also writes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.10.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid 10:11</a>) that Beit Din is enjoined to see that there are courts available to judge <em>geirei toshav</em> (i.e. non-Jews who have accepted to keep the seven Noachide commandments) and those courts can have Jewish or non-Jewish judges.</p>\n\n<p>So, a Beit Din will not directly impose capital punishment on non-Jews, but may appoint special courts to judge them, who can certainly impose capital punishment for transgressions of the Noachide commandments, without the requirement for warning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is not a halachic source, but Josephus brings down in his Antiquities that Herod (An Edomite, so not Jewish, but possibly technically a  גר תושב) was tried and sentenced to death before a \"Sanhedrin\" for killing Jews without a trial.</p>\n\n<p>I use \"Sanhedrin\" in quotes, because by this time there was a lot of corruption in government (not to mention a very strong צדוקי movement), so this might not have been done strictly according to הלכה.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, Josephus mentions a \"Sameas\" (identified as שמאי -- of the zugot) as being a member of this Sanhedrin, so maybe this is a legitimate anecdotal source?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ccel.org/ccel/josephus/complete.ii.xv.ix.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Josephus\">Josephus</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>for Herod, Antipater's son, hath slain Hezekiah, and those that were\n  with him, and hath thereby transgressed our law, which hath forbidden\n  to slay any man, even though he were a wicked man, unless he had been\n  first condemned to suffer death by the Sanhedrim yet hath he been\n  so insolent as to do this, and that without any authority from thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But when Hyrcanus saw that the members of the Sanhedrim were ready to\n  pronounce the sentence of death upon Herod, he put off the trial to\n  another day, and sent privately to Herod, and advised him to fly out\n  of the city, for that by this means he might escape.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><sub>My first answer was philosophical, this one is more Halachic. After spending a couple of hours in our Kolel researching the subject we've come up with some findings:</sub></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Learning straight from the Torah:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I couldn't find a clear view of Poskim on the subject (<em>if Rambam does not deal with that - nobody does</em>), but there's a consensus of the Torah commentators that Jews are allowed to [judge and] execute NJs as we learn it from Parashat Dina (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.34.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 34</a>). <strong>They agree that all male residents of Shechem were killed by being judged and sentenced to death, they only slightly disagree on what ground.</strong><br>\nThe problem is that nobody mentions where exactly they were sentenced - what BD if anything. We also see that Yaakov disagreed but unclear on what (but not on the fact the residents were judged for sure).</p>\n\n<p>Another example is Moses killing an Egyptian that beat a Jew. <strong>Moses witnessed the action and sentenced him to death and executed him.</strong> Here also, nobody argues on the fact that Moses judged and sentenced and executed only the execution was verbal and that opens additional possibilities of interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with those examples that they were before Matan Torah and we always can claim the laws were different.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Learning from Gemmorah</strong></p>\n\n<p>We can learn \"circumstantially\" from the [very existence of the] <strong>Sugya of \"אין עד נעשה דיין\" B\"B 113</strong>, that discusses if a Jew who saw a NJ committing a crime can be the [one] judge to judge [and therefore] sentence him.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Learning from Rambam</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rambam rules numerous capital offenses for NJ incl. 7 Noahide laws, beating Jews or having relations with Jewish women or for keeping Shabbos, using different languages, such as \"חייב מיתה\" or \"נהרגעליו\" etc. But <strong>he never mentions how the judgment should be carried out</strong> and by whom. </p>\n\n<p>Also, when Rambam rules about our responsibility for establishing NJ courts (see @Joel's answer) in Hilchot Melachim is unclear when it applies, seemingly, only in times when we are able to (or maybe in this time, like the Chabad's initiative of 7 Noahide Mitzvos).</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Learning from Chinuch and Minchas Chinuch</strong></p>\n\n<p>Chinuch Mitzvah 409 (\"one cannot be executed unless he stands a trial\") claims interestingly that \"those Mitzvos do not apply to NJ\". Once again, it is not a clear answer to your question, but from that statement, we can learn קל וחומר as many Poskim ruled (resolving \"אין עד נעשה דיין\" negatively - one can be a witness and a judge at the same time) that a Jew is allowed to execute an NJ, representing \"a whole court\" and an executor. </p>\n\n<p>So if one Jew can be a court, an NJ can surely be brought to a \"real\" court.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>I worked a lot on this answer, please respect. Also, please don't downvote it just because you disagree or you don't like the conclusion - use comments.</em></p>\n\n\n",

If so, and given that we can't help our thoughts, the Sages would have given us advice on how to fight them.  I could not find any such advice.  Here is what I found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Talmud says: Sinful thoughts are harder than sin (Hirhurei ‘averah kashu me’averah).  [Yoma 29a] Rashi explains: Ridding yourself of bad thoughts is more difficult than stopping yourself from committing bad actions. But Rambam sees it differently: We <em>sin</em> because of our animal side; but we <em>think</em> with what makes us greater than animals: Our mind. So a sinful thought is a worse offense than the sin itself. [Guide for the Perplexed 3:8]</p></li>\n<li><p>The Talmud adds: When bad intention is followed by action, God combines it with the action and punishes both. When bad intention is not followed by action, God does not combine it with the action and there is therefore no punishment.  [Kiddushin 40a]</p></li>\n<li><p>The Talmud also says: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said that a man should not have intercourse with one woman while thinking about another woman. Ravina said: This statement is necessary only if both women are his wives. [Nedarim 20b]</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On Yom Kippur, we say we are sorry we had bad thoughts: \"Al chet shechatanu lefanecha b'harhor ha-lev -- [We ask God’s forgiveness] for the sin that we have committed by sinful thoughts.\"</p>\n\n<p>But none of this says clearly that bad thoughts break commandments.  Any other insights in the Sources?</p>\n\n\n",

More specifically, that among Chazal, there are different levels of intelligence, understanding and character refinement. Additionally, not all of Chazal were experts in all aspects of the Torah. Some of Chazal had areas of expertise and some were unknowledgeable about parts of the Torah. Based off of these points, the Maharats Chiyus concludes that it’s important to note who the speaker is in any given Aggadah and to investigate,  before trying to understand the statement, “the ways of that particular person in other places where he spoke and to investigate what happened to him and why (i.e. his life story). By doing this you will be able to easily understand what he means even though what he said seems bizarre at first glance.”</p>\n\n<p>[You can see the original in Hebrew <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/chazal/maamar.asp?id=299\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.

Yehudah HaNassi was a descendant of David he construed a seeming denouncement of David, by God, favorably. (This is a common avowal made by the sages in reaction to others' opinions.)  </p>\n\n<p>An example of the latter is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.140b.9?with=Chidushei%20Agadot&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shab. 140b</a> where Rav Papa is recorded saying that one who drinks wine while able to drink beer violates “ba’al tashchit”. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chidushei_Agadot_on_Shabbat.140b.3?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsh”a</a> comments that Rav Papa’s disapproval of consuming wine instead of beer was due to personal bias since he had profited handsomely by beer manufacture. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the general methodical approach it was more properly developed and utilized with the onset of the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wissenschaft_des_Judentums\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wissenschaft des Judentums</a> movement. No particular \"traditional\" commentator comes to mind who <strong>consistently</strong> explains <em>divre</em> Chazal with this approach.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This approach was often used by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe.

He will often explain disagreements in Aggada in the Talmud in this way, for example <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/154222/jewish/Our-Response-to-the-Giving-of-the-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This approach is taken from his father, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Scheerson, who regularly explains the significance of the author of a teaching, but usually according to kabbalah, not pshat.</p>\n\n<p>(Similarly, in Halacha there are many rules like these (which sage is expert in which subject) taken into account when rendering the halacha from the Talmud. These are compiled in <a href=\"http://daf-yomi.com/Data/UploadedFiles/Forums/20897.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel HaNagid's Mavo HaTalmud</a> (printed in the back of Berachos in many editions).

I'll give an example to illustrate:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mike has considered the long path to Geirus.  It's a great move, but\nit takes a long time and lots of learning in the interim.  His Rabbis\nwho are helping with this have suggested he becomes familiar with the services and have recommended his joining a minyan.  There are times however, when the minyan is tight, and while he sits quietly in the back, not everyone in the minyan is aware that right now he doesn't count.</p>\n<p>What is Mike to do?  It's embarrassing every time to tell the person\nthat he doesn't count.  It's not nice to be considered out of the\nfold, when for all intents and purposes, he looks Jewish!</p>\n<p>That is why Mike makes a point of only Davening in the main Minyanim\nin the Shul - a sure bet that there'll be 11.  The Gabbai, who gets\nall sorts of requests and requirements knows the situation, and\nhandles the issue subtly and with respect and sensitivity and avoids embarrassment.  He tell's the minyan that we don't have the required 10. The person in the back already davened, and the Rav's psak is that since there is a later minyan anyway, they should rather wait till then to daven.</p>\n<p>Mike has been told by his teachers that he should inform the Gabbai,\nand if, he is invited for Shabbos, that he may not touch non-mevushal\nwine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's probably best to explain the situation to the gabbai, but I can't think of a good way to do so. There's a very high risk of causing embarrassment for everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the issue is more to do with how to handle a delicate situation sensitively.  This can easily be done without embarrassment.  People in leadership roles are supposed to be helpful and sensitive and there is no reason to think otherwise here.   If not, perhaps this is the congregation that the person should avoid.</p>\n<p>Obviously one should not feel embarrassed by the situation - these things are often no-one's fault but it is what it is.  Causing harm, especially when discussed in private is hardly a need for concern.  Rabbis have thick skin.  There are many cases that are often far worse than what actually happens practically.</p>\n<p>You write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If he's a convert, it'll necessarily force others to remind him of his past, which is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You're right it is forbidden to remind him of his past, because you're effectively shaming him.  He is now a new person, and you're shaming him.</p>\n<p>However, in this context: <em>privately</em>, with a desire to do the right thing is hardly a cause for being shamed.  A convert should be proud that he has chosen to enter the Covenant of Avrohom Avinu <em>by his own choice</em>! In the context of doing the right thing, and privately discussing an issue should never be a cause for humiliation, shame and embarrassment.</p>\n<p>I would speak to the Rabbi of the Congregation and explain the situation in detail. Often there are things that people miss or are not aware of. If the person concerned is approached by the Gabbai, or a congregant, the best is probably to deflect and say: \"I've already davened\" or \"I can't daven right now for personal reasons\".  If this would cause embarrassment, then it seems from a similar answer presented in mi yodeya, that there would only be an issur d'rebannon, and that the shaliach tzibur should be told that he should have in mind that the tefillah is a tefillas nedava.  I would however speak to the Rabbi first, or speak to a Local Orthodox Rabbi.  Geirus, Jewishness and the issue is complicated, sensitive and controversial.  Speaking to someone about it in a private setting with enough time can be worked out.  I think this is the key - making judgments and assumptions before actually speaking to someone in a leadership role is foolhardy.  No-one should ever feel embarrassed about preventing harm or doing the right thing!</p>\n<p>You write:\nTelling others or letting them assume he counts also has a problem of lifnei iver, since it can result in an invalid (according to B) minyan or aliyah. Telling others he doesn't count is an outright lie, and an 11th man might not come along.</p>\n<p>There is a machlokes as to whether or not Lifnei Iver applies to all Issurei D'Rebnonan.  In this context, Davening in a minyan is at best a minhag, possibly D'Rebonan. In fact, since we don't know who is Jewish and who isn't today - we only base ourselves on <em>Chazaka</em> - the principle that what was is <em>assumed</em> to be the case, nonetheless, Hashem rewards and makes the effort to help His children do the right thing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps it's best to contact the rabbi beforehand? But it still causes embarrassment, though at least it's private. And it doesn't cover the case where the gabbai finds him and asks him to complete a minyan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You answered your own question - Yes should contact the Rabbi beforehand. It's only embarrassing if it is made to be - and I hardly expect a person in a leadership role - given time and adequate information and warning shouldn't be able to help.  You can certainly ask the Rabbi what to do in the case the Gabbi finds him.  Rabbis are good at fielding questions!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The answer depends on what demoninations A and B are. If they are both Orthodox, in my experience the conversion will be accepted unless there are well-known exceptional circumstances. In such cases, one can clarify with another representative of denomination A what the position is. Alternatively, a friend could ask the rabbi in general what his position is about conversions from denomination B.</p>\n\n<p>If denomination B is non-Orthodox (and A is), almost always the conversion will not be accepted (although here too there are exceptions).</p>\n\n\n",

And so it seems that everywhere that that person had a very active life, the great years are written before the few, to show that even in his last few years, he was also active and did things, which are written down (in the Torah). This is not so by one who did not do a (recorded) action in his old age, there it is written the opposite. This is usually; however there are exceptions, and they come to teach us a d’rasha, like by the years of Sarah, where it says “100 years and 20 years and 7 years”- and we learn that when she was 20 she was as beautiful as when she was 7, etc. But we do not learn this from the fact that it says “year” three times, because it says that by the life of Yishma’el as well. Rather from the fact that the great amount of years is written first. But she didn’t do anything in her old age (that is recorded)!

She [said]: Swear that you will not reveal [the remedy]. He said: I swear to the God of Israel I will not reveal it. She then divulged it to him and the next day he revealed it in his [public] lecture. [A rabbi asked:] But did he not swear to her?\n[Another rabbi answered:] He swore: To the God of Israel I will not reveal it, [implying that] I may reveal it to His people Israel. [The first rabbi rejoined:] But is this not a profanation of the [Divine] Name?\n[The second rabbi answered:] [No, because] he stated [that provision] to her originally. \n[Avodah Zarah 28a]</p>\n\n<p>Note that the rabbis' concern was Rabbi Yochanan's oath, not the fact that he revealed a trade secret.</p>\n\n<p>(Not what I originally asked, but a useful area to explore.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Like all things in Halacha it depends on the situation. There are also additional consideration like Hasogas Gevul that would come into play even when there is no intrinsic trade secret or copyright issues.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the Gemroah in Avoda Zorah is concerned that was a unique situation of a common life and death illness without a well known cure. </p>\n\n<p>The CHAVOS YA'IR (#69) explains that only in the case of such a public need (\"Tzorech Rabim\") Rebbi Yochanan held that one may render his oath invalid, even when it involves another person. However that limiting factor of \"common  life and death illness without a well known cure\" would be relevant in learning out any trade secrets halachos from that Gemorah  as well</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Usually, the revealing of trade secrets would cause a loss to the party who is keeping the secret.  For example to reveal the ingredients to say a popular soda drink would damage their business since the competition would develop their own version.  There would be a substantial monetary loss.</p>\n\n<p>Then there is the ethical behavior.  Jews seen as revealing trade secrets would be considered unethical and there would be issues of chillul Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the context, it might be damaging to all Jews.  For example if the Rabbi who is involved in certifying that Coca Cola is Kosher were to reveal the ingredients of Coca Cola, he would not only be doing something unethical, and cause a substantial loss to the company, it would also damage the reputability of Kashrus Organizations and businesses would see that Jews and their Kashrus are not reliable, honest individuals.  This would cause a massive chillul Hashem, but also delegitimize the kashrus industry.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmudic discussion here, is an entirely different scenario - where the issue is the betterment of society as a whole.  Would it be unethical to reveal the way Teva Pharmaceuticals makes a certain medicine, thus enabling a generic compound to be made, thus providing a cheaper alternative for the drug, and thus would be a betterment to the community as a whole.  This would ostensibly save lives.  There are a number of issues here.  Firstly the healing of Rebbi Yochanan was conditional on revealing the remedy.  In the case of Teva, you're entitled to the drug and it is non-conditional, provided the doctor allows it.  It seems therefore that Rebbi Yochanan's agreement was not an agreement in the true sense because she knew he would reveal it prior to the treatment, and made him swear otherwise.  He needed treatment and it seems it was illegitimate to withhold that information.  In the case of Teva, there is no condition and they don't assume you will reveal their trade secret.  Anyone in their employment would probably sign a non-disclosure agreement which effectively means that legally you'll be obligated not to reveal anything with stiff penalties otherwise.  Halachically, this agreement would probably be binding.

Only after both sides agreed to to do the job, do they arrange who does it when.\nThis is permitted because if the person who has to do the bigger job does it first, obviously no ribbis is involved since the \"lender\" gave more than the one who repaid. Ribbis means that more was repaid than was originally given not vice verca.\nThus since the original obligation of the one who drives the longer carpool for the other is not dependent on the fact that that person FIRST drove for him, since at the time of his agreement it was not yet decided who would drive first, even if he ends up being the second driver, there is no issue of ribbis because he agreed to do that amount of driving even before it was known that the other would drive (the shorter route) for him.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# With B”H more people living to over 70, are there implications for the mitzvah of מפני שיבה תקום והדרת פני זקן\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Standing_for_Talmidei_Chachamim_and_the_Elderly#cite_note-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mitzvah</a>  to get up for a person aged over 70.</p>\n\n<p>The link on the word “mitzvah” goes to Halchipedia. The first footnote relates to the age 70 and reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>S”A YD 244:1 writes that it is a positive command to stand up for an\n  elderly person of age 70. This is from the pasuk in the Torah (Vayikra\n  19:32) מפני שיבה תקום והדרת פני זקן. Kitzur S”A 144:2, Chaye Adam\n  69:2, and Aruch HaShulchan 244:1 agree. Birkei Yosef 244:4, however,\n  quotes the Arizal who says that one should stand for a person of age\n  60. Sh”t Yabia Omer 3:13 and 9:13 writes that while the halacha follows S”A, one who is strict for the Arizal will be blessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We are grateful to Hashem that a larger proportion of the population is now over 70 years old than was the case over many years. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone commented on the nature of this mitzvah in these changed circumstances?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/sidebar/lecture.cfm/890668/rabbi-hershel-schachter/nishtanu-hatvaim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This excellent shiur by Rabbi Herschel Schachter</a> explains that there are halochos where change in circumstances allow a change in the din (and halochos where they do not). </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Well, Oliver's comment caused me to publish this as an answer:</p>\n\n<p>Actually for Mitzvos בין אדם לחבירו we do take into consideration cultural and social circumstances. As we experience huge changes in those areas we observe how those Mitzvahs' observance changes with time. Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Tzedakka:</strong> Halachicly you're obligated to provide full support for EVERY needy that turns to you, but once there are so many (in Meah Shearim for instance) you pick who you help to and how much. You are not obligated to do \"the full Mitzvah\" for every needy\".</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Honoring Parents:</strong> Halachically one is obligated to stand before his parents and so it was for centuries. Norms changed, and you won't find that today in most frum families.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Returning lost property:</strong> Norms have changed dramatically with the technological advances. If you come by a building (Jewish) with its lights on you don't scream \"השבת אבידה\", it is very acceptable nowadays. The bar for returning property has raised significantly, nobody returns pens, Kipas or other small items.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Standing before Rabbis in a Kolel:</strong> Halachically one is obligated to stand before every Rabbi, but once there are too many it interferes with learning Torah or other activities, one becomes automatically Potur.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note: A possible Halachic Ptur for the mentioned behaviors is that it is ruled that as the person himself precedes other in all Mitzvos בין אדם לחבירו, like אבידתך קודמת, those Mitzvos should not come at expense of personal suffering. Once a person suffers, he precedes others, and that takes over the Mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Same here, once there are too many elders, a person can pick when and to whom he'd like to perform that Mitzvah and technically Potur from others.</p>\n\n<p>Same here, once there are so many elders, you pick when to do the Mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When is it moral to line up and kill thousands of little girls? A question on the Torah's morality\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am bothered by an incident in the Torah that seems morally unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>After the incident with Pinchas, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.31?lang=he&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Torah records</a> that Klal Yisroel were commanded to attack Midian to avenge their attempt at seducing them. Klal Yisroel goes to war and kills all the male Midianites but spares the females. This angers Hashem: after all, the women were the whole problem in the first place, and Hashem commands them to kill all the (already defeated) women \"who knew men.\" Klal Yisroel them goes and kills all the women of Midian, sparing <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.31.46?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">16,000 women</a> who \"never knew a man\" and taking them as slaves.</p>\n\n<p>A slightly upsetting story, but I can accept it was necessary.</p>\n\n<p>The issue that bothers me to no end is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.60b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a Gemara in Yavamos 60b</a> that adds the following point to the story: When Hashem commanded them to kill all the women \"who knew men\", that did not mean all women who actually slept with a man. Rather, it meant all women legally old enough to have intercourse - 3 years and older.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara then asks the obvious question of how it was possible for Klal Yisroel to identify the age of the girls - after all, a two year old may look like she is three years old, and many three year olds can easily pass as two year olds. The Gemara explains that the Jews lined up the girls in front of the Cohen Gadol wearing the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/148172/jewish/What-Were-the-Urim-VeTumim.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Urim viTumim</a>, and all the girls older than three would be identified as they passed in front of the Urim viTumim. </p>\n\n<p>Assuming those under 2 years old and over 4 years old were readily identifiable and did not need the Urim viTumim to be ferreted out, that leaves a line of 8,000 little girls (who had just watched both their parents and brothers get killed) forced to stand in a long line to see if they will be killed, or spared and allowed to live as a lifelong slaves.</p>\n\n<p>Let us assume that the Jews had a very efficient killing system - with only 5 seconds for each girl to pass in front of the Cohen Gadol and be identified, and 10 seconds for another person to pull the girl aside and kill her or send her off to her master. Even with these unreasonably quick timeframes, that still means that even if Klal Yisroel worked around the clock, it would take a day and a half (33 hours) to get through the line.</p>\n\n<p>How is this not barbaric? Lining up 8k 2 and 3 year old orphan girls for over a full day with a team of executioners at the end of the line who are busy killing half the girls - how is that not a terribly depraved and inhuman event, even compared to other horrors in the history of the world?</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on this issue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Of course, it's upsetting.  </p>\n\n<p>Especially when these young girls are all <em>innocent</em> right?\nWrong.</p>\n\n<p>This is the point.</p>\n\n<p>Let's discuss the range - 3 years to 12 years.  Children can be indoctrinated very easily.  They are used today in the most horrific ways - slave labor, fighting in wars.  It is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-war-children/more-than-350-million-children-living-in-conflict-zones-says-charity-idUSKCN1FZ00M\" rel=\"noreferrer\">estimated according to Reuters</a> that 350 million children worldwide are used as soldiers.  This is today, yes, 2018.  Horrific!</p>\n\n<p>My point is to illustrate that your assumptions about innocent girls is simply based on your own moral compass.  I agree that <em>all things being equal</em> killing small children for fun, is morally reprehensible.  Period.  I totally agree.  Can small children be redeemed - can they repent from their ways.  I would venture to say that the answer might be an emphatic no.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of today, child soldiers could possibly be, sadly, irredeemable.\nA child's experiences, especially in the formative years, affects brain chemistry, and reforming them, might be an altogether impossible task.  It is not a simple matter of simply 'converting people'. We're talking dedicated indoctrination of principles that antithetical to moral culture.  We see this today in the cycle of hatred of various groups calling for the destruction of Israel and do not recognize the Jewish state. This is inculcated very early on, and children assume this to be the truth, and do not question it.</p>\n\n<p>This is going on <em>today</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the Torah.  The Torah is talking about a <em>spiritual</em> issue that cannot be corrected, and must be eradicated.  We don't make these judgments, G-d does.  We see very clearly, that the Jewish people were not happy to do this, and had to do be told a second time to carry out the act.  We were told to do it by G-d.</p>\n\n<p>In sefer Hayashar it is brought that the Egyptians buried children in the walls. Moshe Rabbeinu has a complaint directed at Hashem for doing this, and as a result, Hashem allows two to be saved to show Moshe what becomes of these children. They become the leaders of the Eiruv Rav and become extremely wicked people (see Rokeiach Beshalach 14-11).  We see from a spiritual perspective G-d saw that these children are not going to be redeemed nor are redeemable.  They must be removed from this world.  Again, G-d makes these decisions.  We don't.</p>\n\n<p>We see death and being killed by the sword as being negative and destructive.  However, we also know that one of the punishments of Beis Din is Saif (death by sword).  Punishments meted out by Beis Din are not punishments in the sense of correction.  If G-d wanted to, He could have done things differently.  The point about the punishments so that we end up in the World to Come.  They are there to help us fix the mess we made in this world.  Death is a neutralizer of our many failings and sins.  </p>\n\n<p>While we see that death and destruction, especially of small children is completely at odds with our western sensibilities; nonetheless, if we change our perspective of what is going on here, we understand that things aren't always as they seem, and that we're open to different views and we question our assumptions, we will find that the Torah's understanding is the correct moral approach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>That's exactly the difference between our human judgment and Heavenly knowledge. </p>\n\n<p>Those girls (and many more examples in the Tanach) were not judged by Moses and his earthly court, they were judged by the Heavenly court and found guilty and sentenced to death. Only Moses and his army were asked to execute the sentence. </p>\n\n<p>Just look around - innocent children are killed in accidents and terminal illnesses, but we do not question G-d's justice as the Torah says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַצּוּר תָּמִים פָּעֳלוֹ כִּי כָל־דְּרָכָיו מִשְׁפָּט<br>\n  אֵל אֱמוּנָה וְאֵין עָוֶל צַדִּיק וְיָשָׁר הוּא׃</p>\n  \n  <p>\"His deeds are perfect, all His ways are just;<br>\n  A faithful God, never false, True and upright is He. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is a huge difference in understanding the Torah logic - some actions are ours to judge and decide, some are not, we follow it brainlessly, counting on G-d's judgment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In general these types of questions about things of this nature are difficult to answer because there is so much missing information. The Mitzvah is not in practice today, it's practical application is not discussed in the Mishna or Gemora etc so we don’t know the details. We also  don't  know the nature of the people who were being killed and the general circumstances of the time. As such I’m not overly bothered by it.</p>\n<p>To raise two  points however,</p>\n<p>(1) It’s not so simple that the girls and their families were not deliberately   given the option to run away. The source from where we know that one may not commit genocide during a milchoma but rather must allow a path for anyone who wants to run way to do so  is from this very Milchomes Midyan. (There is a machlokes in the Sifrei by milchemes midyan  if they let everyone run away this time or did Hashem tell to make an exception)</p>\n<p>(2)This was not some Einsatzgruppen massacre. This was a situation   where people who were going to be killed were identified by Hashem,  one by one, by clearly miraculous methods (the use of the Urim V’Tumim).  While there may be  limits to how satisfying a frequent answer of “Hashem knows what is right and decided….” can be ,that would not be the case here.  In a situation where Hashem is making his will known through miraculous methods at the moment of the command to kill someone, then it is a satisfying answer is “if  Hashem made  the Urim V’Tumim work to identify  girls who should not survive you can be  confident that he wasn’t making open miracles for nothing. These girls were really better off not surviving.  Maybe when I'll be older I'll have more exact reasons why. \"</p>\n\n\n",

There is an issue of leaving food under the bed.  But as far as eating in the bedroom it seems perfectly permitted.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is a principle in preparing for Pesach (Mishna Pesachim 1:1), that if a bedroom or cellar has not being frequented the whole year - i.e. one is very careful to not eat at all in such a place, the whole year, one need not do a deep cleaning and checking for Chometz, since one was particular in making sure that this area was free from Chometz the whole year. This is perhaps why many families especially prohibit eating in places other than the kitchen and dining space.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from that, it seems a particular culture - <em>derech eretz</em> if you will, of being a mentsch - kings and queens eat in the dining room.  You wouldn't expect Queen Elizabeth II to have her lunch in bed, but rather in a dining room or tea room etc. So as far as behaving like a prince of G-d, it is meaningful to eat in the dining room as kavod and respect to Hashem (we're His children) and the house as a whole.  But this is purely cultural.  People view their bedrooms as their own living spaces (especially children) and certainly have desks and chairs where they study, and eat in those spaces.  Does President Trump have a bite to eat in his bedroom?  Many people drink coffee in their bedrooms.</p>\n\n\n",

While they may sometimes exhibit hatred towards us, most of the time they don't and in those cases we shouldn't suspect them of trying to harm us.</p>\n\n<h2>3) \"Eisav always hates us is NOT the <em>halacha</em>\"</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin</strong> in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22080&st=&pgnum=250&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvot Ivra #116</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>׳<strong>ועוון פלילי מצד אותם המטיפים הפטפטנים שדורשים תמיד ‘הלכה הוא שעשו שונא ליעקב’, והשנאה עולמית</strong>. זה נגד האמת ונגד חז”ל והמקרא, <strong>שעשו גופא לא הי’ רשע תמיד ושנאתו פסקה על ידי הנהגה מתאמת</strong> וכמו עשו הראשון כן הם ג”כ דורותיו שהכנעה מביאה לשלום, וזהו שאמר בן זומא (אבות פ”ד מ”א) ‘איזהו מכובד המכבד את הבריות’, כונתו גם נגד האומות, <strong>כשמכבדים אותם ואומרים להם אוהבי אתה הם נעשים לאוהבים על ידי זה</strong> ולהפך כשאומרים שונא אתה נעשים לשונא וזהו מעשים בכל יום׳</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>“It’s criminal those who constantly chatter and expound that it is a halacha that Esav hates Yaakov and the hatred is eternal</strong> – this is against the truth, against our Sages and the Torah, <strong>for Esav himself was not always a wicked person and his hatred stopped after appropriate behavior</strong>.  Just like with regard to the first Esav, so, too, with regard to his generations, humility leads to peace. This is what Ben Zoma says, “Who is honored? One who honors created beings.” The intent of this is also for the other nations. <strong>When we honor them and say to them you are my friend then they become friendly to us</strong>.  The opposite is also true. When we say that we hate them, then they become hateful [to us] and this happens all the time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And he specifically names <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> as examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וראוי שלא נקצר מלתת תודה לקודמים במה שדיברו במעשה בראשית ואם נמצאו\nרחוקים מאד מהכונה אשר מצאנוה בכאן כמו שתראה ממה שביאר בזה הרב המורה\nבספרו הנכבד מורה הנבוכים והחכם ר' אברהם אבן עזרא בפירוש התורה הנה\nהם היו סיבה באופן מה להעמידנו על האמת בזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So which is it? Were Ralbag's predecessors a help, or were they a hindrance?

(Note that in one statement he mentions no names, while in the other statement he mentions two names. He does not, however, seem to indicate that he is limiting himself to specific commentaries in either case.)</li>\n<li>Does he perhaps mean that in the early part of the parshah the wrong explanations helped him, but in the rest of the parshah the wrong explanations made things more difficult? (I'm not sure why that would be the case.)</li>\n<li>Does he perhaps mean that the earlier explanations were a mixture of helpful and harmful?</li>\n<li>Do any later commentaries perhaps discuss this?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For some more context on how Ralbag viewed his predecessors' erroneous explanations of Creation, this is what he writes in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhamoth_ha-Shem#Milhamoth_ha-Shem_of_Levi_ben_Gershom,_14th_century\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Milchamot Hashem</a> Book 6, Part 2, Chapter 8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You, my reader, notice how remarkable our explanation of this chapter\n[of <em>Genesis</em>] is compared to those of our predecessors, such that no\nother interpretation but ours is even possible! Our reader should not\nmisunderstand us; for this chapter clearly testifies in our behalf,\nwhether by means of its language or its order, that this is its true\nexplanation, We did not want to lengthen our discussion by refuting\nthe interpretations of our predecessors, since we believe that this\nwould be a superfluous undertaking in the light of the transparent\ntruth of our own interpretation and the clear indication of Scripture\nitself thereof. And with the confession of the opposing party there is\nno need for witnesses.</p>\n<p>(Feldman translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in Book 6, Part 1, Chapter 29:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, concerning creation of the universe we did not find in any of our predecessors a true philosophical account, other than what is found in the Torah by way of tradition. What we have found in Maimonides almost closes the door against this inquiry. For he advances a theory of creation that is clearly impossible [i.e., creation <em>ex nihilo</em>], and in addition to declares that it is impossible for man to reach the truth on this topic by philosophical means. It is therefor quite marvelous that we have actually succeeded in solving these extremely profound problems and in eliminating all the doubts pertaining to them. It is proper, therefore, to give thanks to the Lord (may He be blessed) Who has revealed to us these marvelous and profound truths.

God's command to Abraham was sufficiently vague that Abraham could have sought an interpretation other than \"slaughter your son\". The greatness of Abraham, according to Ralbag, was that he loved God so much that he did not seek to find an alternate understanding of the command. This is because when contrasted with his love of God, anything else — including his love for his son — is essentially non-existent. Thus, the test was to see whether Abraham's love of God was great enough that it totally overrode all other concerns, such that he did not even care to try to find an interpretation that would allow him to keep his son alive.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it is possible that Abraham didn't argue with God to spare Isaac for the same reason. That is, despite his love for Isaac his love for God was so great that killing his own son didn't even register as something he would want to avoid. There was thus no reason for him to beg God to spare Isaac.</p>\n\n<p>When it came to Sodom, however, God had not commanded Abraham to do anything. Whereas trying to spare Isaac would necessarily have reflected an imperfection in Abraham's love of God, trying to spare Sodom would not have because regardless of Sodom being destroyed or spared Abraham would not be taking any actions for the sake of God. Therefore, Abraham could perfectly well request Sodom to be spared.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate the point, we can say that if God had <em>commanded</em> Abraham to destroy Sodom, Abraham might well have done it without any arguing.

At that point, Avraham realizes the hint -- <em>anything you want to say about this?</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Short answer that I heard from two rabbanim in my neighborhood:</p>\n\n<p>Child sacrifice was considered the norm during that era. So, when G-d asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, he didn't think this was so unusual.</p>\n\n<p>This is the explanation of Breishit 26:12 when G-d says, \"<strong>Now</strong> I know that you are G-d fearing\". You mean G-d didn't know this all along? (G-d knows everything!)</p>\n\n<p>What is taught is that <strong>now</strong> everyone in the world will know that because you feared G-d and <strong>didn't</strong> sacrifice your son because I told you not to and you followed directions because you fear G-d, you are proof that child sacrifice is <strong>not</strong> \"the Jewish way\", unlike what the other nations do. And, the reason Jews in the future won't do it is because they will follow your example because you feared G-d.</p>\n\n<p>I notice that the rabbis' explanation is a more specific expansion of what Rash\"i says on this verse. So, they're explanation isn't theoretical.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words he should act as though the plates of his scale are balanced, so that if he performs one mitzva he is fortunate, as he tilts his balance to the scale of merit. If he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts his balance to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin destroys much good” (Ecclesiastes 9:18), which means that due to one sin that a person transgresses he squanders much good.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Since the world is judged by its majority, i.e., depending on whether people have performed a majority of mitzvot or a majority of sins, and an individual is likewise judged by his majority, each person must consider that if he performs one mitzva he is praiseworthy, as <strong>he tilts the balance of himself and the entire world to the scale of merit</strong>. Conversely, if he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as <strong>he tilts the balance for himself and the entire world to the scale of liability</strong>, as it is stated: “But one sin destroys much good,” i.e., due to one sin that this individual commits, he squanders much goodness from himself and from the entire world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>I changed the translation of הָאָרֶץ to <em>land</em> instead of <em>earth</em> throughout the paragraph, in keeping with the meaning of other accounts of the corruption of the land such as Numbers 35:33, where the land of Israel is clearly meant, not the entire earth.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

Others (Rashi, Rosh, Tur, Gra (see Beit Yosef and Gra ibid.)) disagree and think even Mincha Gedola is perfectly acceptable, if not ideal because of taking the first opportunity to do a Mitzva (\"Zerizin Makdimin\") or if you will be busy later or need to eat now or won't have a Minyan later (Mishna Berurah ibid.). The Arukh haShulchan (ibid. :12) quotes an opinion that the widespread poverty in Europe was due to people not being careful to pray at Mincha Gedola!</p>\n\n<p>Notably, it used to be quite popular to pray both just to be sure, with much discussion about which one to pray as the obligation and which to pray voluntarily (Rambam, ibid.; Tur 234).</p>\n\n<p>Tosfot (Berakhot 26b) supports the practice of praying Arvit before sunset from the fact that Yaakov prayed it when it was still daytime, so we see there indeed is \"an extra מעלה to pray at the exact same time as [the Avot] did\", but there is also value in praying Mincha earlier, not the least of which is you may forget later on! Everyone should evaluate their circumstances to see what set up is best for them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a \"chasiddish\" Mishna Berura?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishna Berura, to the best of my knowledge, is, for the most part, the accepted <em>psak</em> for the Litvish/yeshivish community. Is there a Halachic work that Chassidim generally turn to for <em>piskei Halacha</em> and especially <em>minhagim</em>? In other words, if one wanted to get a general overview of <em>piskei and minhagei Chassidus</em>, what sefer would he look into?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is a common misunderstanding about the Mishna Berura.  Before the war, each community had a Rav and he would make the necessary Psak for his kehilla.  The major Poskim for Bnei Lita (Lithuanian Jewry) was the Chayyei Adam and Aruch HaShulchan.  In the years leading up to World War II, the European world was shaken up by World War I, and it is in this milieu that the Mishna Berura wrote his Mishnah Berura.  It was not popular at all in his time because communities were still largely intact.  In the years after World War II, the Jewish world was a wreck. Communities were flung apart, there was no longer a single community with a Rav, but different communities together with different minhagim.  In addition there were many Jews with no clear minhag at all. In this context, the Mishnah Berura became the defacto standard as an easy Halachic work on which to rely when the halacha was not clear or a person did not have a minhag.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, the Mishnah Berura has become the accepted standard as a basis on which to rely.  Many Sephardim also study the Mishnah Berura for understanding the Maran Shulchan Aruch and the Beis Yosef.  It is also accepted among Chassidishe circles as the standard halachic reference.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berura often cites the Baal HaTanya.  The Mishnah Berura and the Be'ur Halacha are also key in halachic analysis of the Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim. In many Chassidishe circles the Mishnah Berura is understood to be the starting point for halachic inquiry.</p>\n\n<p>If you're looking for specifically Chassidishe Minhagim.  The Netui Gavriel has a good 20 volumes of the Minhagim of Bnei Chassidim.  In addition, the Piskei Teshuva which is basically a supercommentary on the Mishnah Berurah also notes all the Chassidishe Minhagim relevant to the Psak of the Mishnah Berurah.</p>\n\n<p>Chabad Chassidim also use Shulchan Aruch HaRav.  I would point out that Shulchan Aruch HaRav is a tremendous sefer, and while the Psak may not necessarily be accepted, it is certainly worth the extra time to learn it.</p>\n\n\n",

It is not mentioned in the Ashkenazic Avodah piyyut “Amitz Koach” (circa tenth century) nor in the older Sephardic Avodah piyyut “Atah Konanta.” Moreover, it is worth noting that the rope is not mentioned in the Apocrypha, the Dead Sea Scrolls or the pseudepigrapha. Finally, one of the best eyewitnesses of Beit Hamikdash activities, Josephus, fails to note the existence of such a rope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And some sources relate events that imply there was no rope:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara (Yoma 53b) relates that there was once a Kohen Gadol who recited a long prayer while in the Heichal (main sanctuary building).

They entered the Heichal and found him dead. Again, the implication is that there was no chain attached to this Kohen Gadol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There also are halachic problems with the rope. It could constitute an extra garment invalidating the service. If placed under the Kohen Gadol's clothes, it would be a chatzitza; if over, it would impede his movements.</p>\n<p>If the rope is a gold chain rather than an ordinary rope, there are further halachic problems, such as spreading tumah and wearing gold on Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>Then why does the Zohar mention a rope or chain? Rabbi Uri Sherki explains it as allegorical:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Kohen Gadol, upon entering the Kodesh Hakodashim on Yom Kippur, can become so overwhelmed by the spiritual that he is liable to “forget” to leave. The Zohar uses the imagery of a “rope” as a reminder to the Kohen Gadol that the Jewish people need him and he must “pull” himself back to this world after the extraordinary otherworldly experience of Yom Kippur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Rashi to which you refer says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן לא יעשה. לְעַנּוֹת אֶת הַבְּתוּלוֹת, שֶׁהָאֻמּוֹת גָּדְרוּ עַצְמָן מִן הָעֲרָיוֹת עַל יְדֵי הַמַּבּוּל (בראשית רבה):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, they refrained from rape (la'anot) of virgins, because of a general fencing off from \"arayot\". Thus, what Shechem did was out of bounds even by gentile standards, as a societal norm. That does not necessarily mean that unmarried young men and women did not engage in intercourse. (Is there a prohibition on a <em>panuy</em> with a <em>penuya</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Then, look at the actual text of the local Rashi (on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.16?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24:16</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואיש לא ידעה. שֶׁלֹּא כְּדַרְכָּהּ, לְפִי שֶׁבְּנוֹת הַגּוֹיִם הָיוּ מְשַׁמְּרוֹת מְקוֹם בְּתוּלֵיהֶן וּמַפְקִירוֹת עַצְמָן מִמָּקוֹם אַחֵר, הֵעִיד עַל זוֹ שֶׁנְּקִיָּה מִכֹּל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The assumption is explicit in Rashi that the women were promiscuous in unnatural ways.

Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin</a> has an interesting explanation in his commentary to this verse, which can perhaps address your questions. He interprets the verse as saying not simply that Rivkah had never engaged in any sexual behavior, but that none of the shepherds even knew her (i.e. לא ידעה is taken very literally) because she had never come to the well before. When Avraham's servant saw that the shepherds knew all the other girls but not Rivkah, he understood that she had good parentage and/or that she was a <em>tzenuah</em>, and thus did not hang out with the men at the well, unlike the other girls. This, says R. Berlin, is one of the reasons the servant chose Rivkah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנערה טובת מראה מאד וגו' ביאר הכתוב שלשה טעמים מדוע פגע בה העבד יותר\n  מבאחרות  א'  שהיא  טובת מראה מאד יותר משארי בתולות שראה שם  ב' ואיש לא\n  ידעה שהתבונן בה שאין לה דבר עם אנשים כמו שראה שארי בתולות שהכל מכירין\n  אותן  באשר היו רגילות בכל יום להיות עם הרועים אצל הבאר וגם לא היו\n  צנועות כל כך אבל אותה בתולה לא יצאה עד היום לשאוב על כן  לא ידעה אדם\n  ומזה התבונן העבד שהיא מיוחסת ומשום הכי לא היתה רגילה בכך  או משום\n  צניעות  ג' ותרד העינה ותמלא כדה ותעל ראה שהיא לא שחה עצמה לשאוב ככל\n  השואבות  שזה אינו דרך צניעות כדאיתא בשבת לענין לקט אלא ירדה לתוך העין\n  ותעל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So to answer your main question, it was important for the Torah to tell us this because this was one of the ways that the servant was able to pick her as the right girl. </p>\n\n<p>To answer your specific questions, the first two are answered once we establish that the Torah was not simply talking about actual sexual misbehavior, and the last two can be answered by saying that this description simply wasn't true of the others. In fact it is explicit in Genesis 29:6 that the shepherds <em>did</em> know Rachel. </p>\n\n\n",

As David saw the\n  angel of death standing in Jerusalem and his sword in his hand, his\n  blood became cold from fear of him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just as clothing would not help, a fire would not help either. A fire would have had to be kept going constantly and would just make the room hot without helping the king. A hot bath would be temporary even if it would work.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15885#v=2&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Melachim 1:2</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>A virgin:</strong> her virginity warms her flesh.      </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>A warmer:</strong> Heb. סכנת a warmer, and similarly “and he who chops wood is warmed (יסכן) by them” (Eccl. 10:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>explains that his wives could not help because they were no longer virgins. This means that the medical advice <strong>of that time</strong> was that he required the extra warmth provided by her virginity. It does not matter as to whether or not we treat it as <em>medical fact or speculation</em>. The JPS translation of I Melachim uses Rashi to say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li><em>A virgin</em> - Since his own body was not capable of producing its own warmth in sufficient amounts, an alternative was sought to aid him\n  in this capacity. His medical advisers felt a woman could accomplish\n  this best. Although he had eighteen wives for this purpose, yet none\n  had the advantages of a virgin, since <em>her virginity warms her flesh</em>.\n  Her vibrant youth and virgin blood increased the warmth of her flesh.\n  [<em>Rashi</em>]</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The significance of this story is that Adoniyahu was actually setting up a revolt against Shlomo Hamelech. as we see in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15886/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#v=17&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Melachim 2:17</a> in the JPS commentary</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>17 ... <em>that he give me Abishag the Shunamite as a wife</em> - Herein\n  Adoniahu discloses the true purpose for the lengthy introduction. His\n  motive in seeking to marry Abishag was not an expression of his love,\n  but rather a means of justifying his claims to the throne. <strong>Since all\n  of a king's possessions are prohibited for use by a commoner, after\n  the king's death, then certainly Abishag, who was in the same category\n  as a wife, his most personal possession, should not be available to\n  Adoniahu, a commoner</strong>. The only exception to this prohibition would\n  be the next king. If Solomon would grant him permission to marry\n  Abishag, his claim to the throne would be greatly enhanced. Adoniahu,\n  therefore, sought to conceal his true intentions by renouncing his own\n  claims to the throne and acceding to and granting Solomon's\n  [<em>Abarbanel</em>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shlomo Hamelech understood what was going on and as we see in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15886/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#v=22&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Melachim 2:22</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"22\">\n  <li>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, \"And why do you ask\n  Abishag the Shunemitess for Adoniahu?

Adoniahu had no more desire to marry Abishag than he had. Solomon understood his intentions to use Abishag as a stepping stone to the throne. Solomon knew <em>from the moment a commoner uses the scepter</em>, or any personal property, <em>of the king, that is the beginning of authority</em> and sovereignty [<em>Rashi</em>]</p>\n\n<p>This cause Shlomo Hamelech to order Adoniahu's death as a <em>mored bemalchus</em></p>\n\n<p>Malbim explains on <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Melakhim_I/2.23#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Melachim 2:23</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וישבע המלך וכו׳ כי בנפשו דבר – רצה לומר הלא דבר זה דבר במסירת נפשו, כי\n  בודאי הבין שיש לו סכנה בשאלה זאת, ובשביל נשואי אבישג לא היה מוסר נפשו\n  אם לא בשחושב תחבולות שבזה שישתמש בשרביטו של מלך יוכל למרוד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the JPS explains Malbim</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This request is going to cost him his life. Solomon was convinced that\n  Adoniahu would never endanger his life just to marry Abishag. Most\n  likely he had other designs in mind, such as making use of the king's\n  <em>scepter</em> as a beginning of sovereignty*. [<em>Malbim</em>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>JPS cites Abarbanel on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15886/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#v=25&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Melachim 2:25</a> that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Solomon forgave Adoniahu only on the condition that he would not\n  return to his quarrelsome and rebellious ways. Even the\n  slightest suggestion of rebellion would rescind the previously granted\n  pardon. His request for Abishag therefore revived again his earlier\n  offense in David's lifetime. [<em>Abarbanel</em>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R. Saadia Gaon offers an interesting explanation for the source of David’s inability to be warm. In Emunot V’Deiot 6:7 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thou knowest, too, that when the master, <em>David, peace be upon him,</em> beheld that angel, even though the latter had no evil intentions so far as he himself was concerned, he was afraid and frightened and made to tremble by him, as Scripture says: <em>For he was terrified because of the sword of the angel of the Lord</em> (I Chron. 21:30). Nor did he cease shivering from that day on until he died, as is attested by Scripture: <em>And they covered him with clothes, but he could get no heat</em> (I Kings 1:1). All the more would this apply to a person for whom [the vision of the angel of death] is intended.</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, David did not have a physical problem getting warm; he was instead trembling in fear from seeing the angel. This would explain why clothing couldn’t help him. We might also speculate that the plan was more to distract him with a pretty girl to get his mind off of the terrifying vision which was causing his shivering than to actually physically warm him.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, drop it via k'lachar yad and then put it on so as not to incur a loss. This is similar to Ribiat page 1333-1334 (see footnotes 201-202).

Where is this requirement noted?</p>\n\n<p>And is it also required on Shabbat morning to have the challah in the table for the kiddush time?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim, 271:9 writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צריך שתהיה מפה על השולחן תחת הפת ומפה אחרת פרוסה על גביו.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You need to have a table covered, under the bread, as well as over the bread.  He writes his comment <em>with regard to the laws of Kiddish</em>. Implicit in the Shulchan Aruch is the idea that the Bread should have been brought out <em>before</em> you recited Kiddish, in contradistinction to the times of the Gemara when Challah would have been brought out later (see Tosfos, Pesachim 100b).</p>\n\n<p>On that writes the Taz (ibid, 12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פרוסה. בטור בשם ירושלמי שלא יראה הפת בשתו שאין מקדשין עליו אלא על היין ולפ\"ז אם מקדש על הפת א\"צ לכסות עליו מפה אבל לטעם אחר שכ' הטור וז\"ל ואני שמעתי טעם לעשות זכר למן שהי' מונח בקופסא טל למעלה וטל למטה עכ\"ל ממילא גם במקדש על הפת צריך לכסות במפה וכן אנו נוהגין:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So that the bread should not feel embarrassed because you're making a beracha on the wine first. (This should be extended as an a foritori (kol Shekein) as not embarrass people either, especially on Shabbos).  There is another reason - as a remembrance for the Man that was covered with dew both below and above the Man. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Gr\"a argues, based on the Gemara Pesachim, 100b, Tosfos, ד״ה שאין\n(see Ma'aseh Rav 118). He says not to have any challah on the Shabbos Table at all when reciting Kiddish.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berura (Seif Katan 41) writes the same obligation (for those who have the Minhag to have the Challos on the table during kiddish) applies equally on Friday Night and Shabbos Day (and Seudas Shlishis - there is some discussion in the Rishonim about having wine during Seudas Shlishis also):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במפה. וכן נוהגים ומשמע בפמ\"ג שלכל הטעמים די במקדש על היין שיהיה מכוסה עד אחר שגמר הקידוש וכן בשחרית צריך ג\"כ להיות הפת מכוסה עד אחר הקידוש </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, if your minhag is to have the challah out during kiddish, then your source is the Shulchan Aruch, who brings the Tur in the name of the Yerushalmi.  Then you should do so in the night and the day.</p>\n\n<p>If however, your custom is to follow the Gr\"a then you need not have the Challah at the table for kiddish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There was a Talmudic idea that the table should not be brought out until after kiddush:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=100b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Pesachim 100b</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא נמי הכי (ושוין) שאין מביאין את השולחן אלא אם כן קידש ואם הביא\n  פורס מפה ומקדש</p>\n  \n  <p>It was taught likewise: And they both agree that one must not bring\n  the table unless one has recited kiddush; but if it was brought, a\n  cloth is spread [over it] and kiddush is recited.

Even though one needs to set the table while it is\n  still day [i.e. before Shabbat] it certainly needs to be set and\n  arranged in a different place, and nevertheless it should not be\n  brought before him until after kiddush, in order that it be\n  recognizable that it is coming for the honor of Shabbat. Therefore, if\n  they brought it out before kiddush, spread a cloth over it as if it's\n  not there, and make kiddush and [then] remove the cloth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, Tosafot already noted that we can't really do this nowadays because we don't have individual small tables that can be easily brought in at the right moment. We have one big table, and to bring it in after kiddush would cause too much of an interruption between kiddush and the meal. Therefore, we have no recourse but to have the table already present during kiddush, and therefore (as mentioned in the beraita) we cover the bread to make it as if it's not present until after kiddush.</p>\n\n<p>This too is codified by R. Yaakov Ben Asher:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1212\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur O.C. 271</a></strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתבו התוספות דדוקא בימיהם שהיו להם שלחנות קטנים כל אחד שלחנו לפניו\n  ולא היה עליהם טורח להפסיק ולהביא השלחן אחר הקידוש אבל לדידן ששלחנות\n  שלנו גדולים וטורח להביאם אחר הקידוש ולהפסיק בין קידוש לסעודה נוהגין\n  להביאם לכתחלה קודם הקידוש ולפרוס מפה ולקדש</p>\n  \n  <p>And Tosafot wrote that it was specifically in their days [i.e.\n  Talmudic times] when they had small tables — each person had his table\n  in front of him — and it was not an inconvenience for them to stop and\n  bring the table after kiddush. But for us where our tables are large,\n  and it is inconvenient to bring them after kidddush and to interrupt\n  between kiddush and the meal, we are accustomed to bring them in the\n  beginning before kiddush and to spread a cloth [over the bread] and\n  make kiddush.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, the reason why we have the bread on the table is that we don't want to make a whole disruption between kiddush and the meal. And we can't simply have the table already out but without the bread, because as alluded to in the first citation from the Tur, the table is supposed to be set before Shabbat. Thus, we have no choice but to have the bread on the table, so we follow the beraita's advice for such a situation, and we cover the bread.</p>\n\n\n",

In general, there are two dimensions of Torah: 1) How it exists in Hashem's mind only, 2) And how it descends into this world to fill it and give light/life to it etc...</p>\n<p>So he says (in the 2nd / 3rd paragraph(s), note there) that the first step one takes in learning Torah is the part of it that he's more related to / accessable, which is the part that <em>descends</em> into this world, so its on equal standing with him and he has easy access to it.</p>\n<p>Then, after learning that level of Torah, he says that since through learning the Torah, it gives more life to you and elevates you, so then eventually you can access the part of Torah that is in Hashem's mind only, since you have been elevated.</p>\n<p>That's the basic idea that I got from reading it (if someone can correct me that would be great), but I'm not fully understanding the conclusion of how this answers the question. Just based on this first part, I would assume that the part of Torah that goes down into this world is an inheritance since its more related to you, (an inheritance <em>for the congregation of Yaakov)</em>, and the higher level of Torah that's united with Hashem's mind is the part of Torah that it says \"prepare yourself/work to learn Torah, for it is not an inheritance\", since this part of the Torah is not so related to you at first, you have to work to get it.</p>\n<p>That's what I thought the conclusion would be based on the intro, but it's actually not (entirely, at least).</p>\n<p>As you can see above, in the 3rd paragraph he says that the reason why the lower level is called an inheritance is because it causes you to \"inherit\" the \"sparks of Tohu\" that are in the world, since by learning Torah you elevate / fix up al the spiritual forces in the world that need fixing (sparks of Tohu), and they become transformed into holiness (Tikkun), like \"inheriting\", and he mentions that the orignal sparks of Tohu are like \"Esav\", 'cause it's very powerful and uncontrollable \"big lights in small vessels\" and the energy of Tikkun that it gets converted to is like Yaakov \"..for he was small\", and Tikkun is \"small lights in big vessels\"...</p>\n<p>Anyway he explains that Yaakov and Esav are brothers, and brothers inherit each other, so when learning this lower-aspect of Torah, it <em>causes</em> you to \"inherit\" the sparks of Esav, and this is also what he says later in the maamer (not quoted above, but its in the link):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ו) וצריך להבין, דלפי ביאור הנ\"ל, הטעם שהתורה נקראת בשם ירושה הוא לפי\nשהתורה מביאה לירושה (שע\"י הבירורים שע\"י התורה יורשים אורות דתהו),\nוהפירוש דתורה גו' מורשה (בפשטות, דאין מקרא יוצא מידי פשוטו47) הוא,\nשהתורה עצמה היא ירושה48.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He asks a question that according to the \"simple\" meaning of the verse, the Torah itself is an inheritance, while the above explanation was that the Torah only <em>brings</em> you to an inheritance.</p>\n<p>But this was my question: what exactly <em>is</em> the non-simple explanation that says that the Torah \"brings\" to an inheritance, why is the Torah called an inheritance according to that explanation, since it only brings you to one?</p>\n<p>Why is the Torah \"called an inheritance\" when it only brings you to an inheritance? Is it because it iteself also is accessible to you, in addition to causing you to inherit the lights of Tohu? I'm not sure.</p>\n\n\n",

Then, consider the \"incantation\": חד חד נחית בלע בלע נחית חד חד . We don't necessarily realize it, because we Ashkenazim pronounce our chets like chafs and our ayins like alephs (or rather, like nothing at all). But ayin and chet, as the Amoraim pronounced them, are actually gutturals. And every single one of the words in this incantation has on of these difficult gutturals in it. Combine it with the other phonemes, and you are giving yourself quite a linguistic workout. Do this when you have a stuck bone in your throat, and it certainly makes sense that you could dislodge a bone!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<h2>Yes, according to R' Akiva Eiger</h2>\n<p>See חידושי ר' עקיבא איגר <em>loc sit</em>, citing the מהרי\"ל who claims this trick specifically is <strong>\"בדוק ומנוסה\"</strong> - <strong>\"tried and tested\"</strong>.</p>\n<p>He goes on to cite the \"שושני לקט\" who provides another version of this, involving placing the left foot in a bowl of water (?) and having a <em>different person</em> (unlike @joshwaxman 's answer) whisper the incantation.</p>\n<p>No story unfortunately...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A Mikveh used alternatively by men and women\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a situation where a mikva is used at different times by both men and women, is there a need to change the mikva water between uses?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In order to keep Mikvaos functioning the whole year round, the Mikveh water that is used for dunking is not the same water that is used for the Mikva itself.  What is done is two processes called hoshoka (Kissing).  The mayim shoevim (non mikva water) is made to connect to the Mikvah water.  Once that happens, then all the waters become kosher for immersion.</p>\n\n<p>In general, a Men's mikva, they often just do one hoshoka.  In a women's mikvah they do things l'chumra (stringently) and do hoshoka in both ways.  A men's mikvah is only because of takanas Ezra (the edict of Ezra) and so is Middos Chassidus (a better thing to do if you can).  Women's mikvah is for Tahora for Tahras Mishpacha - an issue of D'oraissa (Torah prohibition), and so we're more machmir (stringent).  It would seem therefore that a women's mikvah can also be used for a men's mikvah but not vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>As regards the actual change of water of the place of dunking.  It would probably be a matter of practicality and cleanliness.  Mikvah water can get dirty and murky easily, unless of course, they didn't do a proper neshika. (see <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=oswOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%95%D7%94%20%D7%A8%D7%A7%20%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D&source=bl&ots=0h1cUkrmf6&sig=tLAl2pahxR7gxAVTlLddfVR8Ebo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1gwHT5jvMaTV0QGc44G2Ag&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%95%D7%94%20%D7%A8%D7%A7%20%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).\nSo the water would have to be changed for women.  Since we want women to do the mitzvah, we make sure that everything is setup accordingly for her benefit.</p>\n\n<p>The Iggros Moshe writes that given that it would be uncomfortable for women to use the same mikvah as men, it would be better to move the men's mikvah away (See Iggros Moshe, Yoreh Deah 2, 90). Thus, we see that any discomfort on the part of a woman is enough to stop the men's mikvah entirely.  There would be an implied necessity to change the water after the men's mikvah.</p>\n\n\n",

However, it was one of His great wonders that He placed within the upper realms alternate ways and forces by which one might change the governance of the realms beneath them . . . But it is the regular governance of the constellations that the Creator (blessed is He) desires, which He placed in them to begin with, and this would be the opposite. This is the secret of magic and its power, such that the rabbis said regarding magical practices that they “contradict the Council Above”; in other words, they subvert the simple forces of nature, which is a contradiction to the upper realms to some extent.

    "title": "Bringing korbanos for prior obligations when bais hamikdash is rebuilt",
    "content": "# Bringing korbanos for prior obligations when bais hamikdash is rebuilt\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember learning that there were very prominent Rabbaniom (Chafetz Chaim) who would write down which korbanos he would be obligated to bring when the Bais hamikdash would be built . Why do we assume that one is obligated to bring a korban when there is no bais hamikdash. whats the source that one would need to bring all the korbanos they would be obligated in when the Bais hamikdash is built ? </p>\n\n<p>Also do we find that the last generation of the people from  before the building of the second temple brought a bunch of korbanos for all prior obligations once the temple was built ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Shabbos 12b and Yuma 80a) list <em>tanaim</em> who kept records of their transgressions with the intention of bringing <em>karbanot</em> when the <em>Beis Hamikdash</em> will be rebuilt. The Magen Avraham (O\"CH 334.33) codifies the obligation to keep record of any obligation that requires a <em>korban</em>. </p>\n\n<p>The <em>R\"ma Mipano</em>, famously quoted in the Bnei Yissaschar (Rosh Chodesh, Maamar 2), supposedly held that we will sacrifice all the daily offerings that we have missed since the destruction of the temple. This could be a possible explanation to what we say in Tefillas Mussaf - ואת מוסף יום השבת הזה נעשה ונקריב לפניך - <em>the Mussaf of this Shabbos we will perform and sacrifice before You</em>, indicating that we will in fact make up the missing <em>Karbanos</em>. This is contradictory to the dictum \"עבר זמנו בטל קרבנו\", which would indicate that we cannot make up for missing Korbanot after their time has passed.</p>\n\n<p>Others (particularly in the Chassidish world) suggest that since we have a replacement for <em>Karbanot</em> (Menachos 110) by virtue of learning the Halachos of the Korbon, we will not be obligated to bring Karbanot when the Beis Hamikdash is rebuilt. This seems, however, contradictory to the Gemara (Shabbas 12b, Yuma 80a).</p>\n\n<p>The prevalent custom, it seems, is not to keep records of transgressions.</p>\n\n\n",

At <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.45.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse 7</a> the lyric says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּסְאֲךָ אֱלֹהִים, עוֹלָם וָעֶד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Jewish Greek translation which came to be called the Septuagint renders this verse this way: 'Your throne, God, is forever and ever.' So also Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus--second century Jewish translators.</p>\n<p>According to this translation, the king who is addressed in the preceding verses is addressed as 'God' here. Abraham Cohen in The Soncino Books of the Bible states that 'this appears to be the obvious translation but does not suit the context.'</p>\n<p>Saadya Gaon, Ibn Ezra, and Rashi depart from this reading, but each of them translate this passage differently. 'God will establish your throne' (Gaon).  'Your throne is the throne of God' (Ibn Ezra). Rashi, who reads this psalm allegorically, understands אֱלֹהִים as a vocative like the Septuagint, but he takes it as an address to the Torah scholar, and he renders אֱלֹהִים as 'judge' (as he and Onkelos do at Exodus 7:1 and elsewhere): 'Your throne, O judge.'</p>\n<p>Prior to Rashi, the Targum also understands אֱלֹהִים as a vocative, but to insure that it might not be understood as an address to the king of Israel in the sense of 'God', it reads כּוּרְסֵי יְקָרָךְ יְיָ קַיָים לְעָלְמֵי עַלְמִין ('The throne of your glory, Yeya, lasts forever and ever'). See also the Alshich.</p>\n<p>Are there any translators or commentators who translate אֱלֹהִים in Psalm 45:7a as a vocative addressed to the king in the sense of 'God' as do Aquila and Theodotion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your presumption that what is called <em>the Septagint</em> today is the same text that was translated by the 70 Jewish Sages is not in keeping with Jewish history and teaching (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See Disputes over canonicity</a>). That original text has been lost. And that original translation was only on the 5 books of Moshe. What is called Septaguint today is a text that was put together by the church to vindicate Christian theology.</p>\n\n<p>All the classical Jewish commentaries (Targum, Rashi, Radak, Ibn Ezra, Metzudat David) to this chapter (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14255&st=&pgnum=167\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim chapter 45</a>) say the subject of this chapter is  Melech HaMoshiach (Messiah the King), not G-d, as the Christians claim.</p>\n\n<p>In that context (Tehillim 45:7), the throne of the King, upon which <em>elohim</em> sits must be understood to be referring to King Moshiach. The reason why this particular name/title, when used with a human being, is translated as <em>judge</em>, is because it is associated with the quality of Gevurah (judgement and power). See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.2?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 6:2</a> and the Targum and commentaries there.</p>\n\n<p>A Jewish King can also be referred to as a judge, because when the Sanhedrin cannot come to consensus in a capital case, they can refer the case to the King for final judgement and disposition.

They show no acceptance of the rendering of that verse in those four Greek versions. Like Abraham Cohen in <em>The Soncino Books of the Bible</em>, Rosenberg and Zlotowitz in their recent commentary on Psalms state: “The Hebrew could also be rendered ‘Your throne, O God, is everlasting.’ This would not fit the context, which requires the king to be the subject.”  This consideration militates against the Targum, which reads the verse as a vocative to Yahveh.  In the very next verse the psalmist says that the king has a God. This militates against the Greek translations, which read this verse as a vocative to the king and call him God. In Psalm 2:7 the king is metaphorically called the son of God, as he is in in 2 Samuel 7:14. Although some Jewish commentators apply Psalm 45 to the Messiah, the Hebrew is not interpreted as calling him God in verse 7.  As a result, the text did not become as in Christianity a proof text for a doctrine of a divine Messiah, who would be an incarnation of 'the second person of the Trinity,' and thus it is not considered matter for extensive discussion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bibliography</strong>: Jacob Hoftizjer.

A secondary discussion is whether a man is actually <em>yotzei</em> his own obligation during Friday night prayers, when he (a) doesn't mention Yetzias Mitzrayim, and (b) has no intention of being (or specific intention not to be) <em>yotzei</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shabbos day</strong>: This discussion is very different, because there is no need to factor <em>arvus</em>. Unlike Friday night, there is no <em>bracha</em> of Kiddush to make on his wife's behalf; the whole Kiddush is simply the regular <em>borei pri hagafen</em>. Any person who drinks grape juice or wine is obligated in this blessing too; as long as the husband drinks from the <em>kos</em>, this blessing is for himself as much as it is for her. Therefore, even without activating the mechanism of <em>arvus</em>, he can discharge his wife in her obligation using the concept of <em>shomea k'oineh</em>, just like he can be <em>motzi</em> her in <em>hamotzi</em>. <em>Arvus</em> is only necessary when the person making the blessing cannot make it for himself, but would like to make it on behalf of his friend.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>R' Akiva Eiger in fact says (in Orach Chaim 271) that men can say kiddush after davening despite already having fulfilled their obligation, as in the first place they both have the same obligation. Those who argue (Dagul Mervava) maintain that there is a problem even on Friday night.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Sous-vide Cooking or Roasting?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It has been discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/48557/5514\">here</a> previously regarding the Sous-vide method of cooking.</p>\n\n<p>However I have a separate question. What type of method is halachically categorized as?\nIs it Tzli or is it Bishul?</p>\n\n<p>Tzli is defined as cooking through exposure to an open fire. For simplicity sake we’ll call it barbecuing.</p>\n\n<p>Bishul is defined as cooking through water. Like boiling noodles in water.</p>\n\n<p>However regarding the Sous-vide cooking method, when it is placed in the vacuum sealed bag, and cooked in the pot of water. It is not being exposed to the water, rather to the consistent heat that the water is producing, and thus the food is being cooked. Perhaps that is Tzli, in that it is a dry heat. Or no, it is considered bishul because the cooking is being caused by a boiled water - or perhaps (depending on which food is being cooked) the food is being cooked by its own juices and fats.</p>\n\n<p>The practical ramifications if whether we define it as Tzli or Bishul is being that the Sous-vide method does not “brown” the food, like a barbecued piece of meat (One limitation of sous-vide cooking is the fact that browning (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction?wprov=sfti1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maillard reactions</a>) happens at temperatures above the boiling point of water <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide?wprov=sfti1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>). The food comes out softer (also more juicer, which is why people use this method).</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say someone wanted to add that browning to their piece of meat. And on Shabbos (the food was cooked entirely from before shabbos) places it on the plata (on an upside down pot that is Yad Soledes hot) to give the food the desired brown or crunchy texture.</p>\n\n<p>The basis of this question is based on a different argument, if whether or not, despite the food being fully cooked and subject to אין בישול אחר בישול, but if you cook the food again using a different method, ie. Food was cooked through בישול and then cooked again using צלי - it would be assur. But if Sous-vide is considered Tzli it would be permitted <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Magen_Avraham.318.17?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></p>\n\n<p>Thus what is Sous-vide considered? And would putting the food onto the plata to give it the crunchy burning affect be subject to אין בישול אחר צלי or vice versa? is the way its cooked also considered צלי קידר - cooking in its own juice, which is considered בישול?</p>\n\n\n",

The key to understanding the phenomena in question lies in the use by the Torah of two different words for the word rain, גשם and מטר, respectively. The word גשם refers to something physical, i.e. rain originating in the ocean, whereas the rain originating in the celestial spheres is described by using both the name גשם and the name מטר.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>(Eliyahu Munk's translation, available at sefaria.org)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Malbim builds off this idea and writes on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Genesis.2.5.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishit 2:5</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והמטר הוא ענין השגחיי ויורד בזכות האדם ובתפלתו. וכבר בארתי (למעלה א ו) שיש מטר טבעי הבא בסבת האדים העולים מן הארץ וזה נקרא בשם גשם ואין בו ברכה. ויש מטר השגחיי הבא מלמעלה ממים העליונים שזה נקרא בשם מטר וזה יש בו ברכה. ומטר זה לא ירד רק ע\"י זכות האדם וע\"י תפלתו.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>מטר is providential, and descends due to a person's merit and prayer. I have already explained above (1:6) that there is natural rain that comes due to moisture evaporating from the earth, and this is called גשם and does not contain blessing. And then there is providential rain which comes from Above, from the Upper Waters, which is called מטר and does contain blessing. And this rain will not descend without a person's merit and prayer.</p>\n  \n  <p><em>(My translation)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Utilising this idea, I would suggest that when we <strong>ask</strong> for rain, we specifically ask for blessed <em>matar</em> (which, per Malbim, only comes as a result of prayer). When we more generally <strong>praise</strong> Hashem for the fact of rain, we use the generic <em>geshem</em>, which (per R. Bahya) applies to both types of precipitation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This exact question was raised by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_HaKohen_(Vilna)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Thus, when we request rain, we request that it should be rain that is a blessing. When we praise the power of God, though, we refer to all rain (good or bad) because even bad rain is a demonstration of God's power. This explains why in the Prayer for Rain on Shemini Atzeret the phrase משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם is modified with לברכה ולא לקללה — otherwise it would include bad rain as well.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=33&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 33a</a> we are told that the reason why the praise for rain is in the blessing of the resurrection of the dead is that rain is equal to the resurrection. The verse that the Talmud Yerushalmi derives this from uses the term <em>geshem</em>, thus we use the term <em>geshem</em> in the corresponding prayer. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Cheshek Shlomo Ta'anit 2a</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכאורה צריך להבין במאי דתקנו לנו רבותינו אנשי כנה\"ג לומר בהזכרה בלשון ומוריד הגשם ולא תקנו לומר ונותן מטר כמו דאומרים בשאלה ומאיזה טעם חלקו בין הזכרה לשאלה בזה ובפרט דבקרא דאיוב ה' דמפקינן מיניה דיורדין בגבורה ג\"כ מטר כתיב הנותן מטר ע\"פ ארץ וגו' וכן מה דסמכו חז\"ל על הכתוב דלעבדו בכל לבבכם דצריך להזכיר בתפלה מדכתיב בתריה ונתתי מטר ארצכם ג\"כ מטר כתיב ואולי משום דבשאלה דאנו שואלין דיתן לנו טל ומטר לברכה תקנו לומר בלשון מטר דלשון מטר ע\"פ הרוב הוא נמצא בפסוק כשיורד לברכה וגם כתיב ביה לשון נתינה ומה דכתיב בקללות יתן ה' את מטר ארצך אבק ועפר התם הכוונה דאם ח\"ו יהיו ישראל בגדר אין עושין רצונו של מקום יתהפך לקללה ח\"ו אבל בהזכרה דאנו צריכין להזכיר גבורותיו של הקב\"ה עדיף טפי לומר בלשון ומוריד הגשם משום דגשם הוא שם כולל לכל מיני גשמים ומשו\"ה תקנו לומר בלשון הורדה משום דלשון נתינה אינו שייך כ\"כ רק כשיורד לברכה ונ\"ל שזהו שיסד הפייטן בתפלת גשם שאתה הוא ה' אלהינו משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם לברכה ולא לקללה והיינו משום דבלשון ומוריד הגשם נכלל בו גם הגשמים שאינן יורדין לברכה ולכן הוצרך לפרש דמ\"מ אנו מבקשים שלא ירד רק לברכה ועוד י\"ל משום דעיקר הטעם דתקנו לומר גבורות גשמים בתחיית המתים אמרינן בברכות דף ל\"ג א משום דשקולה כתחיית המתים ובירושל' שם מפיק לה מהדין קרא דיחיינו מיומים וגו' וכתיב בקרא דבתריה כשחר נכון מוצאו ויבוא כגשם לנו ע\"ש וא\"כ י\"ל כיון דבהך קרא דמפקינן דשקול כתחיית המתים כתיב בלשון גשם ולפיכך תקנו לומר מוריד הגשם וק\"ל חשק שלמה </p>\n  \n  <p>We need to understand that which the Sages, the Men of the Great Assembly, instituted to say when mentioning [rain, to mention it] with the phrase \"and brings down the rain (<em>geshem</em>)\", and did not institute to say \"and gives rain (matar)\" as we say in the request [for rain, i.e. the ninth blessing of Shemoneh Esrei]. For what reason did they differentiate this between mentioning [rain] and requesting [rain]? And specifically considering that the verse in Job [Chapter] Five from which we derive [in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ta'anit 2a] </a>that rain comes down with power, the term <em>matar</em> is written: \"who gives rain (<em>matar</em>) upon the face of the earth\" etc. And also that which the Sages relied on the verse of \"to serve him with all your hearts\" [as the source] that [rain] needs to be mentioned during prayer, from [the fact] that it is afterwards written \"and I will give the rain (<em>metar</em>) of your land\", there too [the term] <em>matar</em> is written. </p>\n  \n  <p>And perhaps it is because in the request where we ask that He give us dew and rain <em>as a blessing</em> they instituted to say it with the term <em>matar</em> because the term <em>matar</em> is most often found in a verse when [rain] comes down as a blessing, and it is written with the terminology of \"giving\".</p>\n  \n  <p>And that which it is written by the Curses, \"God will make the rain (<em>metar</em>) of your land powder and dust\", there the intent is that if heaven forfend Israel will be in the category of \"not doing the will of God\", [the rain] will be transformed into a curse, heaven forfend.</p>\n  \n  <p>But by the mentioning [of rain], where we have to mention the might of God, it is better to say it with the phrase \"and brings down the rain (<em>hageshem</em>)\" because <em>geshem</em> is a name that includes all types of rain.</p>\n  \n  <p>And for this reason they instituted to say it with the terminology of \"bringing down\" because the terminology of \"giving\" is not really applicable except when it comes down as a blessing.</p>\n  \n  <p>And it appears to me that this is what the composer established in the Prayer for Rain: \"for He is Hashem our God, who makes the wind blow and the rain come down, <strong>as a blessing and not as a curse</strong>\", namely that the terminology of \"bringing down the rain\" includes even rain that does not come down as a blessing, and therefore we are requesting that it should only come down as a blessing.</p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, we can answer that the main reason that they instituted to mention the power of rain in [the blessing of] the resurrection of the dead is as articulated in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=33&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 33a</a> that it is equal to the resurrection of the dead, and in the Jerusalem Talmud there it is derived from this verse of \"after two days he will revive us\" etc. and  in the next verse it is written, \"his going forth is sure as the morning and he shall come to us as the rain (<em>chageshem</em>)\", see there. If so, we can say that since in this verse from which we derive that it is equivalent to the resurrection of the dead it is written with the term <em>geshem</em>, they therefore instituted that we say <em>morid hageshem</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Yitzchak as an Olah Temima - Yes to Egypt - No to Shifcha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yitzchak and Rivka waited many years to have kids, until they davened.</p>\n<p>The Medrash is quoted  saying that Yitzchak didn’t take a Shifcha - maidservant-  like Avraham did (Hagar) because he knew that he was an Olah Temima (from being brought up on the Akeidah). Thus because of that he couldn’t take a shifcha . I dont know why that should be a reason not to be allowed to take a shifcha - I’ve looked around , no answers. This Medrash is quoted in earlier seforim, see this sefer Divrei Shmuel  (ספר דברי שמואל מאת הרב שמואל זנוויל  בן חנוך מלובלין) for one such example:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mTCaW.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mTCaW.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>So, seemingly Yitzchak was aware he was an Olah Temima.</p>\n<p>Yet later in the parsha, when the famine came, Hashem comes to Yitzchak and tells him, “dont go down to Mitzrayim, because you are an Olah Temima” (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8221#showrashi=true&v=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see rashi</a>).</p>\n<p>Which is it? Was Yitzchak independently aware of the fact that he was an Olah Temima? Why did Yitzchak know on his own that he couldn’t take a shifcha due to being an Olah Temima , yet he didnt know that he couldn’t go out of eretz yisroel, because of him being an Olah Temima.</p>\n<p>Both the Be’er Yitzchak and the Re’em explain that the prohibition for Yitzchak, as an Olah Temima to leave the land of Israel is because the Land had the category of an Azara - the sanctum of the Temple, where it is prohibited to take out Kodshei  Kedoshim, and if you were to remove the Olah, it would become invalid.</p>\n<p>To buttress the question further, why would Yitzchak independently rule out taking a Shifcha due to being an Olah Temima, despite there being no internal halachic reason vis a vis being an Olah Temima. Yet not rule going down to Egypt. Seemingly not taking into account his being an Olah Temima, thus necessitating G-d himself to pre-empt Yitzchak going down.</p>\n<p>What is the reason to be distinguish between these two situations?</p>\n<p>Was Yitzchak aware of being an Olah Temima or not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't have a source for this answer, but Yitzchok knowing that he was an Olah Temima, doesn't mean that he knew that as an Olah Temima, he was not allowed to go to outside of the Land of Israel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8221#showrashi=true&v=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on 26:2</a> says that Yitzchak's reaction to the famine was to assume that it was a sign he should go to Egypt like his father did when there was a famine. That was why G-d told him not to go to Egypt because an Olah Temima shouldn't leave the Land of Israel. So if Yitzchak already knew he was an Olah Temima, it would stand to reason that he did not think an Olah Temima was not allowed to leave the Land.</p>\n<p>[Note that a real Olah Temima is not allowed to leave the Courtyard of the Temple (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mizrachi%2C_Genesis.26.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mizrachi on the verse</a>). Since Yitzchak was offered as on Olah Temima on exact future spot of the Altar (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1007195\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Hilchot Beis Habechirah 2:1</a>\n), and then left that spot, perhaps he thought that the spacial limitations of an Olah Temima did not apply to him.]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note a similar rational applied to Yitzchak's thought to leaving Israel by the Lubavitcher Rebbe <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/770370/jewish/Chassidic-Insights.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>2 Isaac had considered going down to Egypt, just as his father Abraham had:</strong> Having been raised by his father to believe in Divine providence, Isaac assumed that the famine was meant to induce him to journey outside the Land of Israel in order to disseminate Divine teachings there, just as his father had done.54</p>\n<p>But God told Isaac not to leave the land, thereby affirming that his particular mode of bringing Divine awareness to the world differed from Abraham's. Abraham taught through outreach, traveling to his audience and tailoring his message to his listeners' ability to grasp. Isaac, in contrast, was to focus on intensifying his own Divine consciousness and that of his own immediate milieu. The force, clarity, and vigor this inner work would give Isaac a magnetic charisma that would draw the outside world to him and make them aspire to emulate him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>R' Moshe Luria explains (Kabbalistically if you're into it):</p>\n\n<p>(please excuse the use of the original Hebrew terms, I don't translate them on purpose)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Why Yitzchok didn't take a servant</strong>:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A פרי like grain has two קליפות - a coarse one that comes off easily and a fine one.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yaakov was the targeted פרי to start עם ישראל from.

But turned out there were two boys. </p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>About going down to Egypt (and abroad in general)</strong>: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>THere's a difference in Tikkunim in the Land of Israel and abroad. In general, the Tikkunim abroad are more physical (בחי' עשיהת, by actually being present and doing some actions) and those in Israel are more \"theoretical\" (בחי' אצילות, by learning Torah with כוונות). </p></li>\n<li><p>Those different types of Tikkunim fit different types of נשמות (\"personalities\") - some are created to do the first type and others the second. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Egyptian Golus was destined, and the forefathers knew it and they tried to \"work-out\" as much of it as possible. (That's the reason for 400/430 years the Torah says because they were working out the Golus also) But there was a Machlokes whether it can be \"worked out\" only physically, by going down to Egypt and being enslaved etc. or [also] theoretically (by learning Torah in Eretz Yisroel. This is similar to the Machlokes of RASHB\"I and the Sages) </p></li>\n<li><p>After Avrohom went down to Egypt and did his part of redemption by \"doing actions\", Yitzhak thought that, similarly, he needs to come down to Egypt physically to make the Tikkun. G-d explained as he was all גבורות (and no Chessed), he cannot leave Israel (the physical Tikkun is not his specialty) and can do all the Tikkunim in Eretz Yisroel by keeping busy learning Torah. </p></li>\n<li><p>This also explains why he was not allowed to go abroad to marry and Eliezer was sent, unlike Yaakov, who went abroad to marry. (COmpare to Yaakov that was תפארת and had a huge Tikkun to do abroad.)</p></li>\n<li><p>The same argument took place between Yaakov's sons - whether the Egyptian exile can be successfully completed without the need to go down to Egypt physically (I think Yehuda's approach and Shevet Levy's learning of Torah in Egypt) vs the need to do it in the place physically (Yosseff's approach).</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>For those who're not familiar with those terms and ideas, don't just downvote it because you don't understand.</em> I can elaborate for those who wants to learn.</p>\n\n\n",

According to our tradition it took place 30 years before the birth of Yitzchok, and this is what the statement that the Israelites spent 430 years in Egypt, reported in Exodus 12,40 is based on. We know as a fact from the Torah that Avraham was one hundred years old when Yitzchok was born. According to Rashi, thirty years elapsed between the covenant of the pieces and the birth of Yitzchok. If so, Avraham could not have been more than 70 years old at that event. Lot joined him and was taken captive after having separated from Avraham during that same year still, and Avraham defeated the armies which had taken him captive, after which event G–d appeared to him as reported in chapter 15. He returned to Charan once more, and when he was 75 years old, G–d commanded him to move to the land of Canaan, i.e. “the land which I will show you.” (12,1) I have found confirmation of these dates in the book called Seder Olam, an ancient historical record, considered reliable by our sages. I am quoting verbatim from that text: “Avraham was 48 years old when G–d confused the languages of the people and they moved apart from one another. When G–d spoke to him at the covenant of the pieces, he was 70 years old. (this was while he was on the soil of the land of Canaan). He returned to Charan where he stayed for another five years. It follows that 27 years elapsed between the destruction of the Tower and Avraham’s departure from Charan a second time” Our verse refers to the second departure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Da’as Zekeinim to 12:4 give a novel approach in resolving the contradiction. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וקשה שהרי ברית בין הבתרים היה לאחר יציאתו מחרן ובפ' בא \n  אל פרעה קרא דויהי מקץ שלשים שנה וגו' שיש שלשים שנה מברית בין הבתרים \n  עד שנולד יצחק ואברהם היה בן מאת שנה כשנולד יצחק וא\"כ לא היה אברהם \n  בין הבתרים כי אם בן שבעים. וצ\"ל ששתי יציאות היו בפעם ראשונה כשהיה בן \n  שבעים וילך אתו לוט ובאותה שעה נשבה לוט ואברהם כבש המלכים ומיד היתה \n  ברית בין הבתרים כי כן נמי פירש\"י גבי אחר הדברים האלה כל מקום שנא' \n  אחר סמוך והיינו מיד שכבש המלכים ונמצא שלא היה כי אם בן שבעים באותו \n  שנה ואחר ברית בין הבתרים חזר לחרן ושהה שם חמש שנים ויצא ועל אותה \n  יציאה קא מהדר קרא ואברהם בן חמש שנים וגו' וכן מצאתי בסדר עולם בפי' \n  וזה לשונו אבינו אברהם היה בהפלגה בן מ\"ח שנה וכשדבר הקב\"ה עמו בין \n  הבתרים היה בן שבעים שנה שנאמר ויהי מקץ וגו' חזר ובא לו לחרן ועשה שם \n  חמש שנים שנאמר ואברם בן חמש שנים ושבעים שנה בצאתו מחרן נמצא מהפלגה \n  ועד שיצא אברהם מחרן כ\"ז שנה עכ\"ל. ואיציאה שניה קאי:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, they answer the pesukim by saying that Avraham left Aram twice (or rather, left each Aram, an approach taken by Bereishis Rabbah 39:8 as well, followed by other Rishonim such as the Ramban to 12:1). </p>\n\n<p>How does this help? Well, the first time they left was when they went to Mitzraim, Lot left and was captured, Avraham saved him, Hashem told him not to fear, and the Bris Bein HaBesarim happened.

First, it presents a theoretical \"negative\" case to serve as an instructional example to minors who are prone to rebelling and negative behavior. OP has made a great effort in showing how unlikely the case may happen. Additionally, the mitzvah is given to the parents to avoid making certain mistakes in raising children.</p>\n<p>As OP mentioned, the mitzvah involves occurence of a rare combination of the factors 1. - 4. in the OP list, which are unlikely to happen. Details of the mitzvah are given in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sanhedrin 8:1-5</a> and further clarified by Gemara, as they were partially outlined by the OP. Two specific aspects of the case are brought in Mishna Sanhedrin 8:4, which were not pointed by OP:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda says: If his mother was not suited for his father, (as explained in Gemara, <strong>was not equal in voice, appearance, and height</strong>), he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, when instructing, both parents must speak without contradictions to their child. However, the same words spoken with different voices, diferent expressions, and coming from differently looking people accustom a child to having different perspectives and flavors on matters of instruction. Such a difference gives validity to his own personal voice and view, as it gives the child a certain range to fit in. A rebellious child fully lacks such a perspective in instruction as he cannot match the parent. Furthermore, the same mishna states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one of the parents was without hands, or lame, or mute, or blind, or deaf, their son does not become a stubborn and rebellious son</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, a child may naturally rebell, because one of the parents is unable to hug him, or hold his hand, or speak to him, or watch him doing anything, or give any attention, emotional or verbal support. As we are aware that Hashem watches over us - in part this feeling is developed thanks to the care of our parents.</p>\n<p>Authority of parents, established rules in the Torah-oriented society, and mitzvos serve for a benefit of the child, not to detriment. Based on the language of the Mishna we see that the key reason for punishment is obviously not eating but rebelling - <em>acting contrary to authority of parents or against established rules</em>. The prohibition for eating gluttonously is applicable to all adults, not just a rebellious child, although it is learned from the theoretical case of BSu\"M.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To determine whether the child is deemed failing to follow instructions, Mishna Sanhedrin 8:4 states explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If his father wishes to have him punished but his mother does not wish that, or if his father does not wish to have him punished but his mother wishes that, he does not become a stubborn and rebellious son, unless they both wish that he be punished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, both parents need to loose any hope in finding success of instructing the child, but not one of them. This is also a very high bar to make.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The book \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0873069501\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Halachoth of Educating Children</a>\" by R. Yehoshua Y. Neuwirth describes the mitzvos that parents are supposed to do in instructing the child (and gives sources).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mitzvah of teaching the Torah to sons. It can be done personally by parents or with a help of a teacher.</li>\n<li>Mitzvah of teaching about Exodus from Egypt to both sons and daughters.</li>\n<li>Training in positive mitzvos that they will perform as adults</li>\n<li>Training in carefulness regarding prohibitions</li>\n<li>Educating in holyness and fear of Heaven</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The book stresses that parents must take into account the child's needs and validity of his actions in observance of mitzvos. Having focused on these matters, the book also notes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A competent Rabbinic authority must be consulted when a minor who is ill needs to eat forbidden foods.</li>\n<li>fathers must prevent their children from speaking <em>lashon hara</em>, lying, cursing, disputes, etc.</li>\n<li>the father of Beis Din have the duty to punish a minor who has stolen or been willfully destructive in order to prevent the recurrence of such behavior.</li>\n<li>One must rebuke and punish a child who has taken a vow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another useful resouce on such matters is the book \"<a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899066110.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Children in Halacha</a>\" by Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Finally, regarding mistakes that parents can make when raising children, which could be sourced to the mitzvah of BSu\"M. R. Shlomo Wolbe \"<a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/planting-and-building-in-education\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Planting and Building in Education</a>\" notes that educational techniques should not stem from parent's negative traits and false goals.

As opposed to the in the <em>Moreh</em> where he emphasizes the communal obligation first, the <em>Yad</em> is directed at the individual, \"<em>until all the laws are revealed to [both] small and great [individuals]</em>\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law.42?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Hakdama</em>, Halacha 41 (40 in standard editions)</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Basing himself off of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Overview_of_Mishneh_Torah_Contents.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Rambam's own descriptions of his 14 books</a>, Rav Rabinovitch explains that the first books are devoted to those personal commandments that correct the individual's personal traits and actions in G-d's service.  This is followed by the communal service in the Temple.  Finally, the Rambam presents the laws focused on national/communal order.  Accordingly, the first seven books are focused on the individual and the latter seven on the community.  </p>\n\n<p>Rav Rabinovitch suggests that the culmination of the work with the Book of Judges, reflects the idea that once the individual has internalized the entirety of the preceding laws, he has become worthy to direct the community.  The focus overall being from the individual toward the community as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Rabinovitch also cites <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Talmudic passage (<em>Shabbath</em> 31a) describing the order of the Mishna</a> based on the words of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.33.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 33:6</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ריש לקיש: מאי דכתיב \"והיה אמונת עתיך חוסן ישועות חכמת ודעת\" וגו׳? אמונת - זה סדר זרעים, עתיך - זה סדר מועד, חוסן - זה סדר נשים, ישועות - זה סדר נזיקין, חכמת - זה סדר קדשים, ודעת - זה סדר טהרות. ואפילו הכי: יראת ה׳ היא אוצרו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise, Maimonides first presents the books of <em>Emunath</em> (faith) - <em>Madda</em> and <em>Ahava</em> (also corresponding to Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi's opening of <em>seder zeraim</em> with tractate <em>Berakhoth</em>, including accepting the yoke of heaven and the laws of <em>Shema</em>, prayer, and blessings).  The Rambam follows with the books of <em>Itecha</em> (times) - <em>Zmanim</em>, and <em>Chossen</em> (marriage) - <em>Nashim</em>, <em>Qedusha</em>, and <em>Haflaa</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>Rav Rabinovitch explains that the laws of <em>kashruth</em> are subsumed within the same <em>kedusha</em> theme that encompasses forbidden relations, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Overview_of_Mishneh_Torah_Contents.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">distinguishing Israel from the nations</a>.  Likewise, Rav Rabinovitch cites Maimonides introduction to his Commentary on the Mishna explaining the connection between the laws of vows (<em>Nedarim</em>/<em>Hafla'a</em>) and of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Rav Rabinovitch explains that Maimonides completes the commandments of personal obligation with the (remaining) laws of Zeraim, based on the connection between <em>erchin</em> and <em>charamin</em> and charity.</p>\n\n<p>[<em><a href=\"https://www.safa-ivrit.org/milon/%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%90+%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lulei d'mistafina</a></em>, I might also suggest that the laws tied to the unique sanctity of the land of Israel (<em>Zeraim</em>), naturally lead up to those laws unique to the sanctity of Jerusalem and the Temple (<em>Avoda</em>-<em>Tahara</em>).  Likewise, the sanctity of the land may be considered a natural follow up to the sanctity of the people (<em>nashim</em>-<em>haflaa</em>), which may in turn follow the sanctity of time - originating with the divinely sanctified <em>Shabbath</em>.]</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides further deviates from the Mishnaic order by postponing the books of <em>Neziqin</em> (<em>Nezaqim</em>, <em>Qinyan</em>, <em>Mishpatim</em>, <em>Shoftim</em>) to after those focused on the Temple service (<em>Avoda</em>, <em>Qorbanoth</em>, <em>Tahara</em>).  Rav Rabinovitch suggests that this fits into his theme of moving from the personal to the communal.  See Yad Peshuta, Hakdama U'minyan Hamitzvos, Intro to the Division of the Books pp. 187-190, inside, for Rav Rabinovitch's full discussion.  It's worth noting that the overall idea includes that while there is a general overall pattern to the main sections, there are also corollaries that segue out of the main theme.</p>\n\n\n",

He claims that after the Kennedy assassination the atmosphere was so strained that he was attacked on the streets of New York, and mobsters threatened to kill him for being a Jew. At a certain point he visited one of his friends, who belonged to a well known Chasidic group, and he was shocked to see that this friend put a hundred-dollar bill into his pocket before Shabbat. The friend replied that the previous week 3 Jews had been killed by robbers, who were infuriated by the fact that Jews didn't carry valuables on the Shabbat, and rather killed their victims. So their rabbi decided that the members should carry a banknote to save their lives in case of a robbery. I have no reasons to doubt the words of this rabbi, but do we know any written decisions from the era, which discuss the <em>halakhic</em> perspective of the problem? Since there's no deterministic relationship between carrying money and not getting killed, what are the requirements of issuing such a ruling? Do you know any similar cases?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This was indeed an issue at one point, and various rabbis weighed in on it.

Here are his own words describing it, from <a href=\"http://thejewishreview.org/articles/?id=184\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an interview with the Jewish Review</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now I myself have occasionally done things which others have found unduly lenient. For example, at one point I stuck my neck out in an effort to help Jews in New York who were afraid of being mugged and wanted to carry some money on Shabbat. Manhattan had an eruv and I thought there was some halakhic basis for people to carry money on the inside of their hat so that they would not experience the wrath of would‑be muggers who found them without any money at all. Other rabbis frowned upon it. But I felt there was an urgent need. There was a young man who had been mugged and beaten up bodily near New York Medical College because he had had no money on him. I was very concerned that many Jews felt fearful of going to shul without money on Shabbat. Other rabbis said Let them not go to shul, which to me was an unrealistic solution. So I stuck my neck out. Some agreed with me, some disagreed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I'm not mistaken, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Riskin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

    "content": "# Is softening a linen garment the end of the laundry process and therefore forbidden on Shabbos (Shabbos 140a)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shabbos 140a. Rav Safra permits softening a laundered linen shirt. (Translation and elucidation of the Gemoro below according to Sefaria) - original is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מיסתמיך ואזיל רב אחא בר יוסף אכתפיה דרב נחמן בר יצחק בר אחתיה אמר ליה\n  כי מטינן לבי רב ספרא עיילינא כי מטו עייליה בעא מיניה מהו לכסכוסי\n  כיתניתא בשבתא לרכוכי כיתניתא קא מיכוין ושפיר דמי או דילמא לאולודי\n  חיורא קמיכוין ואסיר אמר ליה לרכוכי קא מיכוין ושפיר דמי</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara relates another incident involving Rav Aḥa bar Yosef: Rav\n  Aḥa bar Yosef was walking and leaning on the shoulder of Rav Naḥman\n  bar Yitzḥak, his sister’s son. Rav Aḥa said to him: When we arrive at\n  Rav Safra’s house, bring me in. When they arrived, Rav Naḥman brought\n  him in. Rav Aḥa then raised a dilemma before Rav Safra: What is the\n  halakha pertaining to rubbing and thereby softening a linen shirt that\n  is hard after being laundered on Shabbat? Does one intend to soften\n  the shirt, and one may well do so? Or perhaps he intends to generate\n  whiteness in the shirt, and it is prohibited? Rav Safra said to him:\n  He intends to soften, and one may well do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The softening renders the garment fit to wear. Why is it then not מכה בפטיש (the end of the process) of the melocho of libun?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The goal of the laundry process is to maintain the cleanliness and whiteness of the garment. Softening the linen shirt is not considered an integral part of the laundry process. Thus, the softening does not finish the process of making the garment, nor does it finish the laundering process. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding a Sudar, the Gemara states that there is an Isur in softening it, but this is not an act of laundering but rather a Gezeirah so that people not perform the act of laundering. </p>\n\n<p>The difference between a Sudar, which is an important and prominent item of clothing worn on the head, and the linen garment is regarding how significant the softening is to wearing it. The Sudar must be softened and therefore this is more like a part of the laundering process, while the linen does not need the softening so badly and therefore it is not related to the laundering process.</p>\n\n\n",

(Such as: Twins are a sign of this, twins portend that, etc.)  I couldn't find anything about twins except mentioning multiple births when they happen.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah gives us two sets of twins: Jacob/Esau and Peretz/Zerach. The Midrash postulates a lot of twins, mostly to answer questions such as: Who did the first men marry to perpetuate the species?  Where did they find fellow Jews to marry?  It tells us that Cain was born with a twin sister and Abel was born with two twin sisters. [Gen. R. 22:2] They each married their twin, and their fight was really over who would marry Abel’s other sister. [Gen. R. 22:7]</p>\n\n<p>An example will illustrate what I am looking for.  The Talmud makes many collective judgments on women:\n-On the positive side, it mentions their superior compassion (Megillah 14b), their charity (Taanit 23b), their faithfulness (Eruvin 21b), their piety (Sotah 11b), their understanding (Niddah 45b), and their primary role in educating their children and keeping their husbands from transgressing the Torah [Yevamot 63a].<br>\n-On the negative side, it mentions their predisposition to idle curiosity (Taharot 7:9), their propensity for excessive talk (Berachot 48b), their belief in superstitions (Sanhedrin 67a), and their weak will (Shabbat 33b).</p>\n\n<p>Anything remotely similar for twins?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4412/menashe-ephraim-twins?rq=1\">[In another thread]</a>, we learn that Ephraim and Menashe were twins: \"Seder Hadoros puts the births of both of them in the same year (2233), and also cites Nesiv Hayashar quoting Birkas Shmuel that they were indeed twins.\"</p>\n\n<p>Since the Torah did not bother to inform us of this explicitly, perhaps we can conclude that Judaism does not teach there is anything special or noteworthy about twins.  In the other two cases, the fact that they were twins was mentioned only to say that there was pre-birth interaction between the twins.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Halachic issues with buying an item for cheap when owner doesnt know true value\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are the halachic problems that arise when one buys an item at a discount but the owner is unaware of the true value? This can apply to a yard sale where one buys a coin that they know is worth thousands and the owner is selling it for pennies. Does one have to tell the owner of the true value? </p>\n\n<p>Another such case which I have encountered is going to a book sale and there is a $1 table, but on that table there is a book that is worth $100. Is one halachicly obligated to inform the store owner?</p>\n\n<p>Just to note why these cases may be different from other price mistakes is that it is known that there may be rare stuff at a yard/book sale.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Upon investigation, I found in the sefer Mishpetei HaTorah from Dayan Tzvi Shpitz Chelek 2:26 a similar type case. </p>\n\n<p>He relates that Reuvein found an old copy of the Rambam in <em>genizah</em>. He then sold it to an antique seller for 1000 shekalim. The antique seller then noticed after the sale that there are handwritten notes on the side of the sefer with the signature of the Rama. Now the sefer is worth 50,000 shekalim. The question he was asked was this a <em>mekach taus</em>. Dayan Shpitz answered that antiques, in general, do not have set prices, but fluctuate from time to time and therefore the halachos of <em>onaa</em> do not come into play. However, he does note that if this sefer would sell for 10,000 shekalim minimum in any place, then since it was sold for only 1000 shekalim then the seller can claim <em>onaa</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Then he discusses a different twist on the case. That if the book has other parts to it that are not associated with the book. Like if one found a <em>ksav yad</em> in the book which by itself is worth money and the seller did not know of its existence then the buyer can keep it with no complaints. However, he notes that if the seller got that book from <em>yerusha</em> (inheritance) then the buyer would have to return the item. </p>\n\n<p>(He brings the sources to his psak on the bottom of the pages, it is lengthy. It's on pp.  127-131)</p>\n\n<p>In addition , I found that the L'Horos Nasan 7:126 speaks of a  case where a seller sold a ksav yad of a gadol for a minimal amount and then found out that there people who would be willing to pay more for it ,is that a case of onaa and would cause the sale to be void? He goes through a bunch of different sugyos and concludes that if there people who are willing to pay for the item then there would be onaa.  He also says a big chiddush that the fact that today it is easy to reach people all over the world then the market encompasses the whole world . </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here's a short list of possible problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The prohibition of Hona'ah (אונאה - fraud) - selling or buying for over 17% of its real price either mistakenly or on purpose.

Three sections as follows: the section beginning, \"Hear, O Israel\" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9); that commencing, \"And it shall come to pass\" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21); and that commencing, \"And the Lord spoke\" (Numbers 15:37-41). The section beginning, \"Hear, O Israel\" is recited first, because it sets forth the duties of acknowledging the Unity of God, loving Him, and studying His words. This is the great and essential matter on which all depends. Then, the passage beginning, \"And it shall come to pass\" is read, this containing a charge to fulfill all the other commandments. Finally the section concerning Fringes is read, as it also contains a charge to remember all the commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>1:4</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When reciting the Shema, after concluding the first verse, one repeats in a low tone the sentence, \"Blessed be the name of His glorious sovereignty for ever and ever\" and then resumes the reading of the first section in the regular order from the verse, \"And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God,…\"to the end of the section.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>1:9</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When is the time for reading the Shema? In the evening, the duty is correctly performed if it is read at any time from the first appearance of the stars till midnight. If one however transgressed and delayed, but read the Shema before daybreak, he has discharged the obligation. The Sages fixed midnight as the limit only in order to prevent complete violation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>1:11</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When is the right time for reading the Shema by day? To observe the precept properly, one should begin reading it before sunrise, so as to conclude the recital of the Blessing after the Shema exactly at sunrise. This interval is about a tenth of an hour before the Sun rises. One who deferred reading the Shema till the Sun had risen, has discharged his obligation—the period for reading the Shema being extended, for one who delayed, to the end of the first three hours of the day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>1:13</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If one reads the Shema after the first three hours of the day are gone, even though he had been unavoidably prevented from doing so earlier, he has not fulfilled the duty of reading the Shema at the right time. He is in the same category with one who reads the Torah.

Prayer, the most basic of these, is open to everyone. Obviously, then, we do have some spiritual portal unto the natural world.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, when someone is given a vision of the future, or the ability to perform a miracle, it seems almost axiomatic that he is also told to share it, or do it publicly. \nThere is then an opportunity for people to change the outcome (i.e., of a bad prophecy) -- but only on a one-time basis!</p>\n\n<h2>Why are people seemingly never given visions of understanding of the scientific world through Ruach Hakodesh that could be applied or tested in more than one case?</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>More detail, optional:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>The scientific facts described in Tanach through Ruach Hakodesh have\n  semelfactivity in common.

He states that \"murder\" only refers to killing when it is <strong>unlawful</strong>.  But if a person kills lawfully, he does not violate the commandment.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the correct translation of the verse is: \"Thou shalt not <strong>murder</strong>\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Neither \"do not kill\" nor \"do not murder\" is really an accurate translation of \"לא תרצח\" (at least according to common understandings of those English words). There are certainly times when it's permitted (and even required) to kill people (e.g. executions, self-defense, war, etc.) so this is clearly not a blanket prohibition on killing. On the other hand, someone who accidentally kills someone is called a רוצח despite this not really matching up with the English word \"murder\".</p>\n\n<p>It's clear from the fact that there are so many cases when killing is permitted that the word can't really be translated as \"kill\". \"Murder\" is probably more accurate, but with the caveat that it doesn't really mean the same thing as it means in English. Really, לא תרצח means לא תרצח.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are certain people for which the prohibition falls aside. (I’m not even referring to capital punishment here, or extralegal punishment performed by Beis Din.)</p>\n\n<p>One is <em>obligated</em> to kill in self-defense (Sanhedrin 72a) and if one is chasing after someone else to kill, rape, or some other of a specific list of sins (Sanhedrin 73a).</p>\n\n<p>With that category alone, I might argue that the positive commandment to kill them overrules the negative one not to kill (אתי עשה ודחי לא תעשה, ex. Yevamos 84a), as both are phrased in the positive (and the negative, but the point is that there’s a positive here as well). Further, in the case of self-defense, the perpetrator is considered to already be dead (Shemos 22:1 as expounded by Sanhedrin 72a-b), and as such, לא תרצח couldn’t apply anyway. </p>\n\n<p>In other words: the prohibition really is “thou shalt not <em>kill</em>,” but because a positive commandment overrules a negative one, these cases are exceptions. </p>\n\n<p>However, we find cases in which it is <em>permissible</em>, but <em>not</em> obligatory, to kill: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If someone steals from the Beis HaMikdash, curses with a sorcerer, or is intimate with a non-Jewess, while one is advised against killing them, one would be allowed to do so (Sanhedrin 81b-82a, with further exposition on Pinchas through 82b)</li>\n<li>If a Kohen serves in the Beis HaMikdash while Tamei, the young Kohanim take him outside and pierce his brain with wooden planks (Sanhedrin 81b)</li>\n<li>A Goel HaDam is allowed to kill his close relative’s accidental murderer (Makkos 11a cites a dispute in this regard, but the Halacha follows R’ Akiva that it’s merely permissible; see further <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/81026/9682\">here</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given that there are so many cases where it’s <em>permissible</em> to kill, not just <em>obligatory</em>, we can no longer apply אתי עשה ודחי לא תעשה. It must be that לא תרצח means “thou shalt not <em>murder</em>,” rather than “thou shalt not <em>kill</em>.”</p>\n\n\n",

Answers brought there range from keeping a portion of the Torah unique to the Jews, to fostering the Rebbe-to-Talmid relationship, to helping prevent dispute, and more. </p>\n\n<p>I’d like to ask the opposite. Why is there a Written Torah at all? Because of all of the positive benefits to having an Oral Law, why is anything written down at all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Oral Torah being passed down orally, it is naturally subject to certain amounts of corruption via malicious distortion, improper application, simple forgetfulness, etc. The existence of a Written Torah can be seen as a protective measure against this. When someone forgets something, distorts something, or misapplies something from the Oral Torah it is hard to fight against it. You can't really prove that something not written down anywhere is one thing over some other thing. With a Written Torah, the basic fundamentals always exist in writing. If someone distorts, forgets, or misapplies something, everyone else can just refer back to the text and point out the truth.</p>\n<p>We can see a prime example of this from the following Talmudic passage:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=34&daf=16&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Temurah 16a</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר רב בשעה שנפטר משה רבינו לגן עדן אמר לו ליהושע שאל ממני כל ספיקות שיש לך אמר לו רבי כלום הנחתיך שעה אחת והלכתי למקום אחר לא כך כתבת בי ומשרתו יהושע בן נון נער לא ימיש מתוך האהל מיד תשש כחו של יהושע ונשתכחו ממנו שלש מאות הלכות ונולדו לו שבע מאות ספיקות ועמדו כל ישראל להרגו אמר לו הקב\"ה לומר לך אי אפשר לך וטורדן במלחמה שנאמר ויהי אחרי מות משה עבד ה' ויאמר ה' וגו' במתניתין תנא אלף ושבע מאות קלין וחמורין וגזירות שוות ודקדוקי סופרים נשתכחו בימי אבלו של משה אמר רבי אבהו אעפ\"כ החזירן עתניאל בן קנז מתוך פלפולו שנאמר וילכדה עתניאל בן קנז אחי כלב (הקטן ממנו) [ויתן לו את עכסה בתו לאשה</p>\n<p>Rab Judah reported in the name of Rab: When Moses departed [this world] for the Garden of Eden\nhe said to Joshua: ‘Ask me concerning all the doubts you have’. He replied to him: ‘My Master,\nhave I ever left you for one hour and gone elsewhere? Did you not write concerning me in the\nTorah: But his servant Joshua the son of Nun departed not out of the tabernacle? Immediately the\nstrength [of Moses] weakened and [Joshua] forgot three hundred laws and there arose [in his\nmind] seven hundred doubts [concerning laws]. Then all the Israelites rose up to kill him. The\nHoly One, blessed be He, then said to him [Joshua]: ‘It is not possible to tell you. Go and occupy\ntheir attention in war, as it says: Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to\npass that the Lord spake; and it further says; [Prepare you victuals for within three days, etc.].\nIt has been taught: A thousand and seven hundred kal wahomer and gezerah shawah and\nspecifications of the Scribes were forgotten during the period of mourning for Moses. Said R.\nAbbuha: Nevertheless Othniel the son of Kenaz restored [these forgotten teachings] as a result of his\ndialectics, as it says: And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him\nAchsah his daughter to wife. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Tmurah.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we see that many laws were forgotten after the death of Moses. But as long as there was a Written Torah, almost everything could be rederived from the text. Without a Written Torah, we would be at the mercy of people's memories.</p>\n<p>In addition to the fact that the Written Torah helps keep the Written Torah from being forgotten, it also actually helps the Oral Torah from being forgotten. This can be seen from the fact that the Sages often linked things back to the Written Torah even when there was not necessarily a real connection. Several authorities point out that this is to make it easier to remember. (I.e. if the something is linked to a written text, when you see the written text you can be easily reminded of the linked information.)</p>\n<p>For instance, in reference to the hint to the Seven Noahide Laws in the verses of God's commandment to refrain from eating from the tree in the Garden of Eden, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Halevi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Judah Halevi</a> writes:</p>\n<p><strong>Kuzari 3:73</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a wide difference between these injunctions and the verse. The people, however, accepted these seven laws as tradition, connecting them with the verse as aid to memory. (Hirschfeld translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> in his explanation of the rabbinic concept of <em>asmachta</em> writes:</p>\n<p><strong>Commentary to Mishnah, Introduction</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיתה התשובה על זה שהם הלכה למשה מסיני ואין להם שום יסוד שילמדו ממנו באחת המדות ואין להם רמז בכל התורה אלא הסמיכום לפסוק זה כעין סימן כדי שישמרום ויזכרום ואין זה מענין הפסוק וזהו ענין אמרם קרא אסמכתא בעלמא בכל מקום שנזכר (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kafih</a> translation)</p>\n<p>And the response to this was that they are <em>halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai</em> and they have no foundation from which we can learn via one of the methods [of derivation], and there is no hint to them in the entire Torah. But [the Sages] connected them to this verse as a sort of mnemonic, to ensure that they would be protected and remembered, but they don't [actually] have anything to do with the verse. And this is the meaning of their statement \"the verse is a mere <em>asmachta</em>\" in every place it is mentioned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> actually explicitly states this point when he explains why he derives all the details of <em>mitzvot</em> from the plain meaning of the verses (rather than using the methodology of the Sages):</p>\n<p><strong>Commentary to Torah, Introduction</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה בסמכנו אותם הדינים לפשוטי הכתובים תועלת להשאיר יותר זכרון אלו הדינים בנפשותינו כי פסוקי התורה אפשר שיזכרו בקלות לרוב התמדתינו בקריאתם וכאשר יוצאו מפשטי הכתובים ההם ביאורי המצוה יהיה זה סבה אל שיזכרו ביאורי המצוה בכללם עם זכירת הפסוקים ההם</p>\n<p>And connecting those laws to the plain meaning of the verses is a help to better solidify those laws in our memory, for the verses of the Torah can be easily remembered due to the consistency of our reading them. And so when elaborations of the <em>mitzvah</em> are derived form the plain meaning of the verses it will be a cause of remembering all the elaborations of the <em>mitzvah</em> when remembering the verses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Let me surprise you a bit (with a non-standard answer) because it bothered me a lot and I couldn't find a clear explanation. <em>This is all based on R' Moshe Luria Z\"l Ariz\"l's tradition as brought in his books Bays Gnozay.</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>When the world was created by [some kind of heavenly] Torah, neither Adam or Noah or Abraham or Yaakov received anything written. That, probably, proves that the world does not <em>require</em> the Torah in written.</p></li>\n<li><p>The keyword for writing the Torah (or any other law) is what we (I and my Chevrosah) call \"the crystallization\". Just as the water crystallizes from its formless state to a fixed form, the written laws crystallize out of its oral \"waterish\" formless state.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is a general question that could be asked about any written Halachah - what was before that? What did people follow? What was before the Mishnah, Rambam Mechaber? The answer is - people/Rabbis followed their personal imagination, reasoning, tradition, whatever. It could take (theoretically) any form (like liquid water).</p></li>\n<li><p>Once something is written and can't be changed anymore. It may be interpreted or argued upon but not changed. So before Matan Torah, the written Torah might be different - maybe Adam wouldn't sin at all or Eysov wasn't so bad and he would marry Leah and establish the 12 tribes or Bn\"I would behave differently in the wilderness. But once Moses wrote it down it could not be changed anymore, it is the ground for all the later Tora development.</p></li>\n<li><p>For some centuries it remained the only written document and all other tradition was fluid, anything could have emerged. Then Nac\"h became written, then again some centuries passed and Mishnah crystallized, it took a form, and since then could not be changed. Then Talmud could take many different directions in interpreting those Mishnayos, as is clearly seen from it, but once it was finalized, it became \"the written Torah\" also, relatively to the following Sforim. Etc, every further work once put in writing became the written Torah, relatively to what's not written yet.</p></li>\n<li><p>It should be understood that writing is always a Tzimzum, a reduction of the original thought (anyone who wrote Chiduchim would know that). Torah was \"reduced\" to its written form, and therefore it is written in black, and the Gvil is white symbolizing \"all possible forms\" that Torah could be written. That's the reason that Chassidim look at the white Gvil when saying Zoys Hatoyroh, as opposed to those who look at the black letters.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In theory, if the generation of the Exodus would fulfill its ultimate goal of reaching the highest spiritual state during the 400 years of exile, they would not need Matan Torah and Torah was never written and stay \"unlimited\", \"unreduced\" and oral. But that didn't happen, G-d decided to take them out earlier (the reason Moses and the Zkenim originally opposed) and Matan Torah was meant to compensate for that, but again, they sinned with the Golden Calf and things went from bad to worse. </p>\n\n<p>To summarize, the necessity for having the Torah in its written form came from the downgrading of the Jewish nation after the Exodus, and every other generation continues this trend with new books.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you don't understand the idea completely, please don't just downvote before commenting and clarifying.</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Written Torah is a finite encapsulation of the Divine Will in this World.  When the Torah was given it was given in total and did not require an Oral Torah to be explicated, the text itself was able to be understood in all of its depth to the level of the Oral Torah we have today and beyond.  However due to our many failings, and the sin of the Golden Calf, we lost that higher level and the Torah was given again, this time through Moshe's hand and as a result, we needed an Oral Torah, handed to us separately to explicate the written.  </p>\n\n<p>In that sense then, the situation we find ourselves is that the Oral Torah is not the best circumstance, but a necessary injunction to protect the Jewish people and the Torah from being misunderstood and misinterpreted.  </p>\n\n<p>However, had we not sinned and we would be on a higher level, the Torah would be read correctly and all the derivations of the Oral Torah would be obvious from the text.</p>\n\n<p>The Oral Torah is, therefore, a necessary component of a situation in which we created through our failings, but it is hardly the best circumstance.  We have to untangle and unravel the underpinning Halachos and relationship between man and man and man and Hashem in order to behave correctly in any circumstance and bring that out into the world.   The Oral Torah's purpose and the way it is transmitted and learned today is precisely to enable a person to grow and understand the depth of Torah and achieve connection with the Divine Will.  However, it is a tremendous loss that we cannot do that easily, explicitly and obviously simply by reading the Written Torah.</p>\n\n<p>This underscores the point that while without the Oral Torah we would be lost, we are only lost because we created the circumstances that necessitates the Oral Torah.  It is hardly the best scenario, but rather a \"plan B\", because \"plan A\" didn't work out.</p>\n\n\n",

You typically hear the argument that a Jew's observance is between them and Hashem. If they don't observe, that's obviously a personal choice and thus they carry the responsibility of that.</p>\n\n<p>I was curious if there were circumstances where another Jew could be implicated in such a situation. Say a Jew says or does something which alienates a fellow Jew to the point of nonobservance. Do they carry the burden of this on their soul to some degree?</p>\n\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A Jew makes a Baal Teshuva feel unwelcome and they end up not fully reintegrating back into the community of observance as a result.</p></li>\n<li><p>A Jew applies a Torah idea in a wrong or bad way which results in a fellow Jew getting the wrong idea and losing their belief or faith.</p></li>\n<li><p>A Jew gives someone the false idea that observance is something they can just walk away from. \"Maybe this whole Judaism thing isn't for you.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are just some examples but you get the idea.</p>\n\n<p>I was curious if the spiritual ramifications of such individuals had ever been discussed. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>It is a mixture of different Halachot and topics:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It is only a sin if the action is done purposefully and directly</strong> to drive one from observance.

Let the customer deal with his own conscience. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The main point of the OP under discussion would seem to be:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"This way, they cheat their professors and get grades for assignments they never wrote.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>it seems to me IMHO, that there is no problem with your friend doing any of this. We should first look at this under the lens of common sense before assuming there is any \"sin\" or technical \"Halachic\" discussion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IMHO, there is no reason to think anyone is sinning here; not even 50%. The OP's assumption that anyone is cheating a professor is simply mistaken.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Today's colleges are a vast mixture of institutions that are different from each other as far as ethics and \"house rules\" are concerned.</p>\n\n<p>I have found, in my experience, that an essay assignment given by a professor to their students, which is supposed to be done on the private \"homework time\" of the students, to be handed in later, is <strong>usually not</strong> subject to the obligation of the students to have written it themselves.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially true with the advent of \"online\" colleges, where sometimes, even so-called \"tests\" are given with absolutely no supervision to prevent \"cheating\". </p>\n\n<p>I actually know students who have paid retired professors to sit with them and do their online college work for them together in front of the computer. AND yes, even take tests!</p>\n\n<p>Why?? Because the college is not strict about this.</p>\n\n<p>So let us break down the situation into the possibilities:</p>\n\n<p>1) The student's class was told by the professor that the essay assignment must be their own work and they will be held accountable under the honor system, or face sanctions for cheating, if caught.</p>\n\n<p>2) The student's class was given an essay assignment with nothing said about whose work it needs to be.</p>\n\n<p>3) The student's class was given an essay assignment and the professor told them that they may seek help with the assignment from others.</p>\n\n<p>4) The student's class is actually an online college without supervision.</p>\n\n<p>5) The student's class has an essay which will be written under supervision as a test in a supervised classroom.</p>\n\n<p>Now when your friend is approached by some student to pay him to write their essay, even if it is for a college assignment, we should ask which of the above 5 categories the assignment most likely fits into.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If it is #5</strong>, then we do not need to worry, since it is very unusual for a student to show up at a test site under supervision, and smuggle in an essay so he can transcribe from it. It makes no sense for your friend to need to avoid getting paid because he just might be helping such a risk taker. In any case, they will probably be caught, so no harm done. :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>If it is #4</strong>, then there is no problem at all. The online college assumes that you at least read the paper you are submitting since you might need to transcribe it to a special access portal online. What's the difference if you created the paper, or you understand the paper?? You have gone through a learning process of some sort, and your overall grade is made of many things; not just that essay.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, if the online professor is strict and demands it be your own work, then its like case #5 above, because the professor will know the student's level from their interaction online and general participation. If a student who fails a lot of their participation suddenly submits a professional essay... that professor is going to catch on easily. So again we need not assume the customer wants to submit your essay under such conditions of risk taking.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, if the online professor never demanded your own work, then the college has set the bar low. It is not your affair if someone buys an essay from you to submit to a college that allows this, is it? No one sinned.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe that's why some companies only hire people from Harvard and Yale as opposed to those who graduated from \"BOZO TECH ONLINE\" ? :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>If its #3</strong>, then there is obviously no problem at all! Yes this happens a lot!</p>\n\n<p>If its #2, then there is no legal assumption or ethical or moral assumption that it must be your own work. So again, no problem.</p>\n\n<p>If its #1, then that is the only case which would seem problematic. However, that is also not a problem.</p>\n\n<p>The student is afraid to submit a purely professional paper that does not fit his own level of academics and personal writing style to a strict professor who knows this student's work. It would be taking too much risk.</p>\n\n<p>Such a student who buys such a paper anyway, will likely read it and then try to write it again in mostly his own words using a lot of the paper as a structure.</p>\n\n<p>That's OK.</p>\n\n<p>So, I believe that anyone who claims this is a sin, has not thought about the practical situation. There really is no issue here for the one selling their work to others for college assignments. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, while plagiarism is a crime, that is only when someone steals the work of another and calls it their own or does not give proper credit. However, in this case, the student bought the full rights to the author's work; so there is no stealing involved. Therefore, there is by definition no plagiarism!</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the entire premise of the OP's question: \"<strong>This way, they cheat their professors and get grades for assignments they never wrote. Now, my friend does not know exactly what they do with the works he writes, but we can all be 99% sure that this is what happens.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>... is simply a mistaken premise to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, any question of Halachah is moot since the reality is much different than the question assumed based on the true facts on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>The only concern is if a student approaches you and says: \"Hey, I have an assignment due that the professor said must be my own work or else it is cheating!

How about that?</p>\n\n<p>If they agree, take the money! :)</p>\n\n<p>A person's hard work and income is a very holy thing. We should never knee-jerk assume that some form of income is \"sinful\" just because it seems problematic on the surface.

Just like doing the homework for your kids. That way there's no deceit and everything's Kosher.

Sinai. He brought down [from the mountain], by hand, two stone tablets, in which were written the safeguarding of the sabbath; and thus is written in Your Torah:</p>\n<p>\"The Israelites shall safeguard the sabbath, making it a covenant eternal, for their generations. Between Me and the Israelites it is a symbol forever ….\"</p>\n<p>You didn't give it to other nations of the world …</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It flows — kind of. It goes from \"the tablets had safeguarding the sabbath\" to a passage from Scripture about safeguarding the sabbath; that passage mentions the special bond between God and us, and we continue discussing that bond. Okay. But it seems there's a sharp turn between discussion of the tablets and the quotation from Scripture. You'd expect, after that intro about the tablets, to be presented with a quotation from the tablets. But no: the quotation is from elsewhere. So, yes, I see its relevance, but it still strikes me as odd. It seems kinda like saying \"I was reading Mi Yodeya, it's a great site, has the best content, and I saw there the most wonderful thing about the exodus from Egypt, and some other site has this: the exodus was…\". Are there any explanation offered of this oddity?</p>\n\n\n",

Although <a href=\"//chabad.org/103868\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the idea behind a menorah is to remind people of, or advertise, the miracles that Chanukah celebrates</a>, it is, after all, a burning lamp, <a href=\"//chabad.org/3034297\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">which is used traditionally to memorialize the dead</a>. Just make sure you light it in a safe place and manner.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Assuming you aren't Jewish, there would be no mitzvah (commandment) for you to light the menorah, but I don't see anything wrong with it. I will add that perhaps the best way to honor your deceased friend is doing good deeds in his name, like tzedakah (charity).</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/103868/jewish/How-to-Light-the-Menorah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this webpage</a> to learn how to light the menorah. Just one catch, though - since you aren't Jewish make to sure to <em>not</em> recite the blessings. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Its a good Idea to do so, In my humble opinion instead of you lighting it donate the menorah to a jew who would light it with all the Prayers in memory of your friend and that would to a very big soul elevation of your friend 😉</p>\n\n\n",

He is not two or more, but one, unified in a manner\nwhich [surpasses] any unity that is found in the world; i.e., He is\nnot one in the manner of a general category which includes many\nindividual entities, nor one in the way that the body is divided into\ndifferent portions and dimensions. Rather, He is unified, and there\nexists no unity similar to His in the world.</p>\n<p>If there were many gods, they would have body and form, because like\nentities are separated from each other only through the circumstances\nassociated with body and form.</p>\n<p>Were the Creator to have body and form, He would have limitation and\ndefinition, because it is impossible for a body not to be limited. And\nany entity which itself is limited and defined [possesses] only\nlimited and defined power. Since our God, blessed be His name,\npossesses unlimited power, as evidenced by the continuous revolution\nof the sphere, we see that His power is not the power of a body. Since\nHe is not a body, the circumstances associated with bodies that\nproduce division and separation are not relevant to Him. Therefore, it\nis impossible for Him to be anything other than one.</p>\n<p>The knowledge of this concept fulfills a positive commandment, as\n[implied by Deuteronomy 6:4]: \"[Hear, Israel,] God is our Lord, God is\none.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In truth, everything is Hashem, nothing exists on its own, everywhere you look, you are seeing only Hashem.</p>\n<p>The difference between Hashem and everything else, though, is that Hashem made the world in a way that you don't realize that you're only seeing Hashem, He made it in a way where you think you are seeing a separate world, and because of that Hashem might be imagined as just some \"invisible figure\" who is somewhere far away watching us, but that in fact is not true at all, since everything that exists is actually only Hashem, it's only that we don't see it OR realize it. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7989/jewish/Chapter-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Tanya part 2 chapter 3).</a></p>\n<p>The part of Hashem that was put into man, though, is really just a direct link to Hashem. Meaning, in reality, everything is in fact equal to the divine spark within us, there's no difference between it and everything else, since everything is Hashem and Hashem in everywhere and in every thing completely equally, but the power we have with the divine spark is that even though we are in a world which seems SEPARATE, but the divine spark within us has the power to be brought out, and we will NOTICE Hashem in that divine spark, and even more, that divine spark gives us the power to reveal the truth of Hashem in the rest of the world as well (see the end of the last linked source, from 5741).</p>\n<p>In other words, the divine spark is something that has the power to be felt directly by us that it is Hashem's essence. In reality, everything in the world is Hashem, but He's hidden within it, and it's hard to realize, but all the divine spark is is Hashem's DIRECT revelation in us, in a way that we can realize.</p>\n<p>See, for starters, this part of section 2 in the Maamar <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/mlukat/3/46/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"בס\"ד. אור לה' סיון, ערב חג השבועות, ה'תשמ\"ט\"</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבריאת שמים וארץ מתחדשת בכל רגע ורגע, כתורת הבעש\"ט עה\"פ11 לעולם הוי'\nדברך נצב בשמים (הובא בספר תניא קדישא12) שכח האלקי מהוה תמיד את הנברא\nמאין ליש. ומכיון שבריאה והתהוות יש מאין היא בכח העצמות, מובן, שהבריאה\nשבכל רגע ורגע היא יש מאין ממש מהעצמות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It says that everything is (constantly) being renewed from Hashem's direct essence, so in reality, everything is Hashem.</p>\n<p>In more of a DIRECT answer to your question concerning Tanya's description of Hashem \"blowing the soul into man\" and what that means, see section 5 of the Maamar <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/mlukat/1/5/index.htm#_ftnref_304\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בס\"ד. יום ב' דראש השנה ה'תשמ\"א</a> here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה) ויש לומר שזהו מ\"ש אדמו\"ר הזקן בענין ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים, שהוא\nבבחי' נפיחה בכח כביכול, דזה שצריך להיות נפיחה בכח הוא מפני ששרש\nהנשמה הוא בבחי' העלם העצמי, העלם שאינו במציאות, וההמשכה מבחי' העלם\nשאינו במציאות היא ע\"י טרחא ויגיעה דוקא. דהנה ידוע שבכדי להמשיך מהעלם\nשישנו במציאות אין צריך לטרחא ויגיעה. וכמו שלהבת הקשורה בגחלת, דלהיות\nשגם בתוך הגחלת היא במציאות אש אלא שאינה נראה ונגלה בחוץ (העלם שישנו\nבמציאות), לכן הוצאת השלהבת מהגחלת היא בלי עמל ויגיעה. משא\"כ ההמשכה\nמבחי' העלם שאינו במציאות היא ע\"י טרחא ויגיעה דוקא. וכמו הוצאת האש מצור\nהחלמיש, דלהיות האש שבצור הוא בבחי' העלם שאינו במציאות, לכן אי אפשר\nלהוציא ממנו אש כ\"א ע\"י הכאה, בטרחא ויגיעה דוקא. וכמבואר כ\"ז בארוכה\nבדרושי כ\"ק אדמו\"ר (מהורש\"ב) נ\"ע. וזהו מ\"ש אדה\"ז שויפח באפיו נשמת\nחיים הוא בבחי' נפיחה בכח, כי שרש הנשמות הוא בבחי' העלם שאינו במציאות,\nבחי' צור [וכמבואר בלקו\"ת בענין התשובה דוהרוח תשוב אל האלקים אשר\nנתנה, דבחי' האלקים (אשר נתנה) שהוא שרש הנשמה (ומבחינה זו ניתנה הנשמה\nבאופן דנתינה, דכל הנותן בעין יפה הוא נותן) הוא בחי' צור], ולכן\nההמשכה משם היא\nע\"י נפיחה בכח. ולהיות דשרש נש\"י הוא בעצמותו ית' לכן ביכלתם להמשיך\nבעולם גילוי עצמות אוא\"ס.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If your Maamer Hebrew still needs some improvement, I can attempt to translate / explain the basic idea of what it's saying, but you should somehow read it word for word inside yourself, like maybe have someone help you read it.</p>\n<p>Anyway it's basically saying that when the Alter Rebbe said that \"He blew into him the soul of life\" the fact that he said \"he <strong>blew</strong>\", implies a powerful breath (not just like words of speech, although he doesn't say that here in the Maamer), and since it was blown from Hashem in a powerful way, that means it comes from Hashem's innermost essence. Then he goes on a little to explain what is this innermost essence, and compares it to the power of fire that exists in a flint stone.</p>\n<p>Unlike a coal, where the fire is actually IN the coal directly (since, after all, it's hot and sizzling), and in order to get the fire out of the coal, all you have to do is breath on it lightly [which is like words of speech,(Maamer in 5666 that's quoted in note 48 of this Maamer, (ד\"ה ואברהם זקן תרס\"ו (המשך תרס\"ו ע' פ ואילך).)], but a flint stone requires you to hit it to bring out the fire, because the actual fire doesn't really exist within the rock fully, only in potential; in other words, it's more deeply rooted within the essence of the rock, and the power of fire within it isn't revealed openly, before you hit it (unlike the coal which is already hot and sizzling before you blow on it, which shows that the connection of the fire with the essence of the coal isn't so strong, since it can be brought out easily), so since the fire in the flint stone is completely united with it's essence, it needs to be hit hard in order to bring it to the surface, so he explains in this Maamer (and the one from 5666 that was mentioned earlier) that so too was Hashem's \"breathing\" of the soul into man \"with power\" (as mentioned in Tanya), since the soul is united deep within the essence of Hashem \"Tzur Chayeinu -- our \"Rock\" of life\", just like the fire in the flint-stone, so Hashem needed to blow it out with power in order to bring it into the body of Man, similarly to how one needs to hit the flint stone very hard to bring out the fire within, since it's so deeply rooted in it.</p>\n<p>Then, after he explains how the source of the Soul is in the Essence of Hashem, he says that it therefore has to power to reveal the Essence within the world as well.</p>\n<p>That's the basic idea but you should look up that entire linked Maamer and look up all of the notes with a Rabbi, especially that paragraph, to fully grasp the idea.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is a <a href=\"https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/tad\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tad</a> unclear what you are asking, but this may introduce some insight. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryeh_Kaplan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Kaplan</a> in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/92582/16706\">Moreh Ohr</a> 3:4 (p. 43), brings a quotation from the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43243&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction</a> of Shefa Tal:</p>\n\n<p>The souls of the Jewish nation are a part of God, which is hinted to in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.32.9?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dev. 32:9</a> ‘כי חלק ה׳ עמו, For the Lord’s portion is his people’, meaning to say, an actual part of Him. Like a part of something that was split from another. The two parts are of equal and similar qualities. </p>\n\n<p>The only difference between the two of them is that one of them is All of It, which is certainly larger than the thing that was split from it. However, in their essence they are the same and equal. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, the only difference between the soul and God is that God is The All because he is the All Encompassing Light (אור הכולל) etc. The soul however, is a part, and a spark which was split from the Big Light, [God,] Blessed Be He. </p>\n\n<p>Further reading in נשמת חיים and נפש החיים (see below). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובספר שפע טל, בריש ההקדמה, כתב וז\"ל, ידוע שהנשמות של האומה הישראלית, הם חלק אלו-ה ממעל, אשר על זה רמז הפסוק (דברים לב:ט) כי חלק ה' עמו, ר\"ל חלק ממש, כחלק שנחלק מאיזה דבר, הוא שוה ודומה בעינו לאותו דבר שנחלק ממנו, ואין הבדל והפרש בינו ובין אותו הדבר, רק שאותו דבר היא הכל והכלל, שהוא יותר גדול מהחלק שנחלק ממנו, אבל בעצמותם הם דומים ושוים. כמו כן, אין הבדל והפרש בין הנשמה ובינו יתברך כו׳, רק שהוא יתברך הוא הכל, הוא האור הכולל כו׳, והנשמה היא חלק וניצוץ שנחלק ‏מאור הגדול ב״ה ע״כ. \n  ועמ״ש ע״ז בספר נשמת חיים למה״ר מנשה בן ישראל, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34200&st=&pgnum=66&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>מ״ב פ״ט</strong></a>, ובספר נפש החיים, <strong><a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%A8_%D7%90/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%98%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שער א״ פט״ו.</a></strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This concept of the Seal of the King also follows the commentary of <a href=\"http://%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%95%20%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%94.%20%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%95%20%D7%91%D7%96%D7%94%D7%A8%20%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%20%D7%95%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A8%D7%B4%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%A1%D7%B4%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91%20%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95%20%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%96%D7%B4%D7%9C%20%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%A8%20%D7%94%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%20%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%A2%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9C%20%D7%A2%D7%9B%D7%B4%D7%93.%20%D7%95%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A9%D7%A8%20%D7%9C%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%96%20%D7%93%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%A3%20%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%93%20%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%20%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%95%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90%20%D7%90%D7%97%D7%95%D7%96%20%D7%9B%D7%B4%D7%99%20%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%99%D7%B4%D7%94%20%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%B4%D7%A9%20%D7%91%D7%96%D7%94%D7%B4%D7%A7.%20%D7%95%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%9F%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9D%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%A2%20%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D.%20%D7%90%D7%B4%D7%A0%20%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A9%D7%A8%20%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A7%20%D7%94%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%96%D7%94%20%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%96%20%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%95%20%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%94%20%D7%A8%D7%B4%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%B4%D7%96%20%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%B4%D7%95%20%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%95%20%D7%94%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%95%20%D7%94%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D7%96%D7%94%20%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%96%20%D7%A1%D7%B4%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%99%D7%B4%D7%94%20%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D:\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chomat Anak</a> to this posuk in Devarim.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>brit</em> (as in <em>Brit Milah</em>) is the sign (or seal) of the covenant (זאת אות <strong>הברית</strong>), which is also an allusion to Noach, the flood, which like circumcision, removed the blemish from the world <strong><em>via</em></strong> the <em>upper</em> waters (rain), the <em>intermediate</em> waters (tidal and storm surge) and the <em>lower</em> waters (geysers and liquefaction from earthquakes), and G-d's sign (the rainbow, הקשת) recalling all of that (see Bereshit, parshat Noach, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.12?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">9:12</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">9:17</a>).</p>\n\n<p>There is an <strong><em>upper level</em></strong> of this covenant (an <strong><em>intermediate level</em></strong> of this covenant which is not associated with your question) and a <strong><em>lower level, below</em></strong>. (ראש תוך וסוף) as in Roshei Teivot, Tochei Teivot and Sofei Teivot. And this corresponds to what is called the three pillars, or columns (Kav HaYamin/<em>Right</em>, Kav HaSm'ole/<em>Left</em> and Kav HaEmtzo'ee/<em>Center</em>) discussed in kabbalah which begin in intellect with Chochmah/<em>Wisdom</em>, Binah/<em>Understanding</em> and Da'at/<em>Applied Knowledge (the union of abstract knowledge with material, physical existence)</em> and evolve into the Middot which begin with Chesed, Gevurah and Tiferet and which correspond to the three Avot, Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov. In masculine form, there are three qualities of intellect, six emotional qualities and the union with the material/physical called Malchut/Kingship for a total of ten. But in the feminine form there is a discrete fourth level which transcends intellect called Keter/Crown. Keter and Malchut are like opposite sides of the same coin. Keter is above and Malchut is below.</p>\n\n<p>The lower level of the seal is the place of the circumcision, the covenant of Avraham (מילה), also called <em>the Covenant of the Sexual Organ</em> (ברית המעור) as is found in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=51\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Kehilat Yaacov, Brit HaMa'or</a>. To either side of the Milah are the ten toes of the feet, five to the right and five to the left.</p>\n\n<p><em>Below</em>, meaning the male reproductive organ, that which joins husband and wife to be one, a physical, material manifestation of the conclusion of the first sentence of the Shema, <em>HaShem is one</em> as is stated in Reishit Chochmah, Sha'ar HaKedushah, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19987&st=&pgnum=390\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chap. 16</a>, beginning <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19987&st=&pgnum=391\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(וכד מתחברין דכר ונוקבא כדין איתעבידו חד כו\")</a>\n(It should be noted that it is the custom of many to learn these sections of Sha'ar HaKedushah in preparation for marriage.)</p>\n\n<p>The upper level, which parallels the Milah, is the place of the tongue (in ones mouth). This is called <em>Covenant of the Tongue</em>, as is mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=51\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Kehilat Yaacov, <strong><em>Brit Lashon</em></strong> (ברית לשון)</a>. And so too here, to the left and right of the tongue are the ten fingers of the hands.</p>\n\n<p>Here too we manifest G-d’s unity through speaking the words of His Torah and not profaning His name through speaking <em>Lashon HaRah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>And this association of the Brit Milah and the Brit Lashon is emphasized in Reishit Chochmah, Sha'ar HaKedushah, Chap. 17 beginning with the words:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19987&st=&pgnum=418\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">> גם סבת הקרי עצמותו ועיקרו כו\"</a></p>\n\n<p>and continuing:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19987&st=&pgnum=419\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">> והטעם שכבר פירשנו שהדיבור הוא רוחני דומה לזרע הגשמי כו\"</a></p>\n\n<p>This connection is also discussed and emphasized by Rabbi Meir Paprosh HaKohen in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7128&st=&pgnum=53\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Ma'orei Ohr, Letter Beit, Chap. 40 (ברית)</a>, Rabbi Moshe Cordevero in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19622&st=&pgnum=251\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Pardes Rimonim, Sha'ar 23, Sha'ar Archei HaKinuyim, Chap. 2, Brit (ברית)</a>.

They have the same head and the same body.  In this respect then, since they were given a single name at birth, they do not have multiple names.  </p>\n\n<p>As a corollary, it doesn't follow that a person with multiple names (i.e. Yisrael Dovid ben Ploni) does have a split personality. Rather each name reflects a particular aspect of the person's <em>single</em> neshama. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Souls come to the person at the moment of birth.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple Personality is an acquired condition, stemming from severe trauma (usually extensive prolonged abuse) as a young child.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you can show me cases of bodies acquiring extra souls long after birth (not counting the temporary one we're said to have on Shabbat), we can assume one body, one soul.</p>\n\n<p>As for names, it depends how you pray for someone.  Many people change their names for all sorts of reasons.  Marriage, professional, assimilation, safety.  Some people use both their old and new name.  Which one do you pray for? </p>\n\n<p>I would use the name the person prefers (regardless of circumstances) along with their Hebrew name (which probably they only have one of if given in infancy).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You call them by their hebrew name given at birth <em>only</em>; like ploni ben almoni or Yitzchak ben Avraham(unless it was halachically changed before).</p>\n\n<p>A person's split personality doesn't have the power to change or add a name to a person. It is considered a ruach and anything done during the time it overtakes the person, is invalid and the person is not held accountable(since he is a shoteh/insane at the time; see here for a short overview <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/assia_english/strous-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/assia_english/strous-1.htm</a>).</p>\n\n<p>To halachically change one's name, it should be done when called up to the Torah or according to the instructions of a qualified rabbi. Choosing to be referred to by another name other than what we were named at birth at the brit or when the father(or shaliach) is called up to the Torah, has no significance for the matter of our official halachic name.</p>\n\n<p>For a mishnaic reference to ruchot, see mishna eruvin 4:1(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Eruvin.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Eruvin.4?lang=he</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

For example, can they just say \"Here's our wicked son!\". Keep in mind that there are 2 witnesses that testify etc.</p>\n<p>So is the parents' statement one of the \"fixed statements\" that obligate following the exact wording of the Torah (either in Hebrew or any language) or not?

    "title": "Would it be mutar to be implanted with a microchip and leave it in over shabbos?",
    "content": "# Would it be mutar to be implanted with a microchip and leave it in over shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A few years ago a swedish company started implanting employees with rice-sized microchips in the backs of their hands. An american company followed suit. the chips can open doors, grant access to work computers, be used to buy snacks at the company vending machine, and share some data. In Sweden they have also been used to buy train ticket and serve as gym membership cards. In the future they may serve as credit cards as well.</p>\n\n<p>If one is implanted with such a device, would there be an issue in leaving it in over shabbos? I would think not since it requires interacting with something else which is muktzeh (and not things you ordinarily would come in contact with on shabbos) in order to activate it. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Acc. to Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Minchas Shlomo) there is no problem with a circuit that is broken or ineffective on Shabbos.  However, the items are still a Keli Shemelachto l'issur - a vessel that is used for a forbidden melacho (i.e. a microwave oven) cannot be moved or unplugged on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of an implant, if it is a circuit that is currently running and can be turned on or off, that would be an issue.  However, if it is like an NFC chip - that is only activated when brought into proximity with another circuit, then, as long as it is not brought into that vicinity then it shouldn't be a problem with regard to completing a circuit.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is an additional issue.  The Torah describes the Melachos as Melachos Machsheves.  What this means practically is that today you can get lamps that turn on when they 'hear' a human clapping.  Now, on Shabbos it is permitted to make a clapping sound (according to the Rama, according to others, (like the Rosh, it is better to use a Shinui and clap with the back of the hands, like the Yerushalmi says).  Does that mean one can turn on a lamp with a clap?  So the answer is that no - since the intention is to turn the lamp on, then it is forbidden (and if it is an incandescent light bulb - <em>possibly</em> D'Oraissa acc. to the Rambam).  So if your intention is to do a forbidden act, even if the implant seems to respond to a simple hand gesture, it would be forbidden.  </p>\n\n<p>Aside from that, there is a further issur of causing oneself bodily injury.  Many poskim do not allow implants or plastic surgery for the sake of beauty.  If there is a medical necessity or some sort of medical reason that is needed, there would be a heter to allow it.  It would seem to me that having an implant for non-medical purposes would not necessarily be under this category of allowance.</p>\n\n<p>As regards Cochlear implants and hearing aids, this is precisely what was addressed by Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach.  As long as one does not adjust it on Shabbos, there should be no reason to forbid it (although some are machmir and turn off their hearing aid on Shabbos).  Chochlear implants might even be Hagrama (indirect) since they take sound waves and convert them into neuro-impulses.  It isn't a malacha machsheves, because the intention is to hear, and not to do a melacha per se. As regards whether one should have an implant - this is certainly regarded as an enhancement for better quality of life, and will enable someone to hear Torah and be able to learn and speak so there should be no reason to forbid an implant on these grounds.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What standard of living does Judaism endorse, if at all?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've always wondered if there was a minimum standard of living mandated by the Torah. If there is, what is it? And if not, how does the Torah relate to this matter? Is it according to the individual's emotional/mental needs or is it universal?</p>\n\n<p>In other words, what's the ideal level of material comfort the Torah requires or endorses? If there is such a thing.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For the average person, I think the answer’s going to be “everyone is different.” But conveniently you ask for the <em>ideal</em>, and to that I have an explicit Braisa for you (quoted as Avos 6:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כַּךְ הִיא דַּרְכָּהּ שֶׁל תּוֹרָה, פַּת בְּמֶלַח תֹּאכַל, וּמַיִם בִּמְשׂוּרָה תִשְׁתֶּה, וְעַל הָאָרֶץ תִּישַׁן, וְחַיֵּי צַעַר תִּחְיֶה, וּבַתּוֹרָה אַתָּה עָמֵל, אִם אַתָּה עֹשֶׂה כֵן, (תהלים קכח) אַשְׁרֶיךָ וְטוֹב לָךְ. אַשְׁרֶיךָ בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה וְטוֹב לָךְ לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא:</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the way of the Torah: Bread with salt will you eat, water in a small measure will you drink, on the ground will you sleep, a life of pain will you live, and in Torah will you toil. If you do this, “You are fortunate, and there is good for you” - you are fortunate in this world and there is good for you in the World to Come. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Torah does not prescribe a standard of living. It seems to take for granted that a man may be rich, or be poor. Therefore if he is rich there are rules limiting his ability to become richer at the loss of others. If he is poor, he is given protections and options to try and improve his condition.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of the restrictions against the rich. A rich man cannot monopolize land and create many of the situations we find now in our modern capitalist times. In ancient Israel, one could only purchase land for 49 years, after the 50th year the land would default back to its owners who sold it to help them in their poverty. Also, a rich man must always leave the corners of his field for the poor, as well as not go back for a second gleaning. He is also encouraged to lend to the poor, and give to the needy.</p>\n\n<p>A poor person is given certain protections, and certain options to give him upward mobility. Protections would be the land reverting back to him as mentioned above, or not needing to give pledges if his pledge would be something he needs to live. Options for upward mobility include getting interest free loans or being able to sell oneself into slavery in order to have your needs be taken care of, or even selling your children if you cannot afford to take care of them. These last \"options\" ring terrible to our modern ears, but this was a very real option and often beneficial option for people. Especially considering the rules the Torah put on slavery (freedom after 7 years, payment at the end of your term, being set free if injured by your master) etc.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why did the nesiim give such tiny wagons?",
    "content": "# Why did the nesiim give such tiny wagons?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.7.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah</a> describes how the nesiim gave wagons for the purpose of transporting the Mishkan.  The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.99a.3-4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> gives the dimensions of those wagons: 5 amos long, 2.5 amos wide, with the 10-amah kerashim placed along the width of the wagon.  The Ritva says the Gemara knows this based on a tradition (which is really the only possibility, unless you can somehow derive this from the sparse pesukim in Naso).</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains that, the middle of each keresh was supported by the wagons, with 3.75 amos hanging off on each side.  This was so precarious that it required a Levi to jog behind the wagons and, when one of the stacks of kerashim looked like it was about to fall, run up and steady it.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos and the Rashba give a different picture, with the kerashim stretched out between two wagons.  This requires tall and potentially unstable stacks of kerashim.   And neither explanation leaves much room for the amudim, adanim, berichim - the Gemara doesn't describe where they went, but either they went on top, got squeezed in somewhere, or were carried.  The yerios had to go on wagons too, and while again the Gemara doesn't say how that was accomplished, it must have involved folding them over many times.</p>\n\n<p>What were the nesiim thinking?  Why did they give such small wagons that barely fit what needed to go on them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here's my take on it, based on the pesukim and this Gemara as well as some other Midrashim.</p>\n<p>First of all, the nesiim gave three sets of gifts to the Mishkan:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the gemstones, oil, and spices in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.35.27-28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayakhel</a></li>\n<li>the wagons in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.7.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Naso</a></li>\n<li>the offerings for the Chanukas Hamizbeiach, also in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.7.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Naso</a> immediately after (2).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.7.3.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>, based on the Midrash, explains the progression from (1) to (2).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי נָתָן מָה רָאוּ הַנְּשִׂיאִים לְהִתְנַדֵּב כָּאן בַּתְּחִלָּה, וּבִמְלֶאכֶת הַמִּשְׁכָּן לֹא הִתְנַדְּבוּ תְּחִלָּה? אֶלָּא כָּךְ אָמְרוּ הַנְּשִׂיאִים, יִתְנַדְּבוּ צִבּוּר מַה שֶּׁיִּתְנַדְּבוּ, וּמַה שֶּׁמְּחַסְּרִין, אָנוּ מַשְׁלִימִין, כֵּיוָן שֶׁרָאוּ שֶׁהִשְׁלִימוּ צִבּוּר אֶת הַכֹּל, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר \"וְהַמְּלָאכָה הָיְתָה דַיָּם\" (שמות ל\"ו), אָמְרוּ מֵעַתָּה מַה לָּנוּ לַעֲשׂוֹת? הֵבִיאוּ אַבְנֵי הַשֹּׁהַם וְהַמִּלּוּאִים לָאֵפוֹד וְלַחֹשֶׁן, לְכָךְ הִתְנַדְּבוּ כָּאן תְּחִלָּה</p>\n<p>Rabbi Nathan said: What reason had the princes to give their contributions here first of all the people, whereas at the work of the Tabernacle they were not the first but the last to contribute? But — he replied — the princes spoke thus: “Let the community in general contribute all they wish to give and then what will then be lacking we shall supply”. As soon as they saw that the community gave everything needed in its entirety (lit., that the community completed everything) — as it said, (Exodus 36:7) “For the stuff they had was enough [for all the work to make it]” — the princes asked, ‘What can we now do’? Therefore they brought the onyx stones, and stones for setting for the Ephod and for the breast plate. That is why they were here the first to contribute”</p>\n<p>(copied from Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This explanation is really odd.  It's not like the nesiim didn't have anything left to contribute, and therefore they learned their lesson and came first next time.  The stones, oil, and spices are an important part of the Mishkan's operation, and the stones are an especially prominent and unique gift.  What more could they have wanted?</p>\n<p>Also note that nobody explains the progression from (2) to (3).  It seems that when the brought the wagons, they hadn't yet planned to give the Chanukas Hamizbeiach.  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.7.10.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> touches on this point but doesn't give an explanation.</p>\n<p>Apparently, the Nesiim wanted to contribute to the construction of the vessels of the Mishkan, like the Aron and Mizbeiach.  (And it's hard to blame them - if I could donate to any part of the Mishkan, I'd probably pick the Aron.)  They initially failed to do this, because all of the materials had already been donated.</p>\n<p>The wagons were an attempt to give a unique service and honor to the vessels.  The wagons as described in the Gemara barely fit the mishkan, but had plenty of room to fit the vessels, which were smaller, with small parts of the copper mizbeiach hanging off the sides.  The 6 wagons would have held the aron, shulchan, menorah, two mizbeichos, and kiyor.</p>\n<p>But their plan failed - the vessels have to be carried on the shoulders of the Bnei Kehas, not on wagons.  The Nesiim still wanted to contribute to the vessels, so they came up with Plan C, to donate the Chanukas Hamizbeiach.  This reads very nicely in the pesukim: Moshe didn't give the wagons to the Bnei Kehas, and then the Nesiim brought the Chanukas Hamizbeiach.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A weak point in my theory is that I'm considering the shemen hamishchah's use on the vessels as part of the Mishkan's \"operations\" and the Chanukas Hamizbeiach as part of the \"construction\", when their functions are very similar on the surface.  I can think of reasons why this would be the case, but I could have easily seen it the other way as well.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# To what extent does the Torah make allowances for people in severe physical pain?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a severe progressive neurological disease and it's exceptionally painful. Current medical technology unfortunately is not able to provide much in the way of treatment or relief. Everyday things like eating, drinking, walking up the stairs, and doing lot of things varies from mildly to severely painful in addition to extremely fatiguing. And this often gets to the point that regular every day life is exceptionally depressing. </p>\n\n<p>This has meant that things like dovening, putting on teffilin, going to shul, and lots of other mitsvos are extremely hard and painful. A long time ago I asked my Rebbe in yeshiva about this and he told me basically \"tough luck\". He wasn't empathetic at all. </p>\n\n<p>However recently I was perusing Stack Exchange and I came upon a radical idea (from Alex) that sometimes there may be peturim / heterim for various things. The suggestion there varied from just minhogim to even some derebonons. See here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/95530/17540\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/95530/17540</a></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, is there a mokor to be excessively makel? I'm <strong>not</strong> talking about eating treif. But I am wondering if one can one look for the most makel shitoh among the poskim in a situation where doing something is very painful and/or exhausting. For example, if there is a single yaish omrim in the Taz, could I just rely on that even in a d'oriaso l'hokel when there is a huge amount of pain involved. </p>\n\n<p>And more radically, are they times when for a d'rabonnon one can be potur l'gamrei? Perhaps the mitzvoh of arbah minnim could be done super quickly because the mitsvoh d'oraiso (IIRC) according to most rishonim is to just quickly hold the minim together for a short period of time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I honestly, genuinely feel your pain and wish you relief as much as can be.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly I would like to stay that: \"Lfum tzara agra\" - according to the effort is the reward.  You should know that your efforts and pain do not go unnoticed and you do get immense, unfathomable reward for everything you do, especially if that effort is painful.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the forum for discussing a personal psak.  You need to talk to a competent <em>Posek</em> who is well-versed in medical conditions.  You may need to speak with someone who is in a bigger city, or someone in Eretz Yisrael who would be able to paskin this sensitive issue.</p>\n\n<p>Halacha is divided into what the Torah says, what Chazal say, what the Rishonim say, and what the Minhag is.  It is also dependent upon the issue at hand, and whether or not you can handle this level of stringency.  </p>\n\n<p>As you correctly point out, without any details, you can't eat a ham-sandwich because 'you're in pain'.  The Torah forbids eating pork.  Now, if it is a life-threatening condition and you need to eat pork, then that is a different story.  </p>\n\n<p>That being said, there are many shitot (rulings and opinions) that may or may not be relied upon, given the circumstances in question.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, if you can stand during Kedusha, then that is better, but it is not necessarily in <em>your</em> best interests to do so.  You need to talk to a competent <em>posek</em> and find out honestly which aspects of halacha you should be following to the letter, and which areas you <em>should be</em> doing that are <em>meikal</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>If someone is in so much pain that he cannot stand for an extended period, I don't see how that is in anyway not comparable to a traveler - who is also required to sit and pray because his mind is not able to concentrate fully on tefilla.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch is laid out in a way that shows the '<em>m'ikkar hadin</em>' - the actual halacha, what is generally accepted practice (for Sefardim or Ashkenazim - outlined in the Rama), and often whether or not one can be lenient - for example - a great monetary loss, or a mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Yes there are cases for being as you say: '<em>excessively meikal</em>', however, these are very extenuating circumstances, and therefore, it is absolutely essential you speak with a <em>posek</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, when it comes to a chicken that is being checked for treifos, the halacha depends upon whether or not one is checking for someone who would suffer substantially from the loss or not.  In your case, the excruciating pain <em>may</em> indeed be a reason for you to be <em>meikal</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that you've had a run-in with a Rav.  I'm suggesting that you do not speak to a Rav, but a Posek. This is someone who can take achrayus for you.</p>\n\n<p>I would also say that unless you've done shimush and understand the way the poskim write, that you cannot simply pull out a daas yochid on a Taz and hold by him.  I would suggest you learn halacha with someone who is experienced with shailos, so that you can start learning yourself.  I would also find out which seforim you can rely on for your shailos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>On a theoretical level: For practical applications, talk to a Rabbi who knows Halacha. (Not every Rebbi in a yeshiva qualifies. as you've discovered.)</p>\n\n<p>Halacha is full of the concept of במקום צער - when pain is involved. A lot of laws change when pain is involved.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes even mental anguish is sufficient a reason to not be obligated to pray, for example.</p>\n\n<p>As you already proposed, the idea is to try to do the Torah <em>core</em> Mitzva - like hold the 4 species for a few moments on Sukkoth  - and to skip the non-essential parts, like holding them for the entire Hallel.</p>\n\n<p>Possibly - in this example - you may even be allowed to hold each of the 4 species individually, one at a time, for a few moments, and still fulfill your Torah obligation and even be able to say the Bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Each painful act would need to be tackled individually to see how to minimize the pain and maximize the Mitzva - what you need is a world class Posek- here are some issues you could tackle with him:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do you really have to go to shul? Every day? thrice daily? If you can't, which of the times is more important?</li>\n<li>Do you have to put on Tefillin every day? Maybe somebody can wrap them on you gently without any action on your part? Are you even allowed to wear Tefilin if you're in excruciating pain? What parts of davening are the most important to have your Tefillin on for? Can you wear either the Shel-Yad (hand) or Shel-Rosh (arm) Tefilla without the other? Maybe wear both for a few moments and then take off the painful one?</li>\n<li>Do you have to hold all 4 Minim together? For how long? Can you make a Bracha if you hold each one individually? How small could a set fo 4-Minim be and still be Kosher?</li>\n<li>Is there a Mitzva to visit depressed people? How often? Should one inform people one qualifies for such visits?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>I only want to stress Danny's point of the purpose of observing Mitzvos:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Point 1: \"לפום צערא אגרא\"</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This world is called עולם התיקון, so it is intended to fix some things broken. The Mitzvos are intended to be an instrument to those fixes, each Mitzvah working in its ways.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are two approaches to how Mitzvos work (very roughly): one says it's \"black and white\" - you either perform the Mitzvah and the Tikkun or not, and the other says it's \"לפום צערא אגרא\" - the [fix] reward is according to one's effort.</p></li>\n<li><p>Following the later we can say that <strong>one who puts a lot of effort and does only a part of a Mitzvah performs a bigger Tikkun that one who does the whole Mitzvah effortlessly</strong>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Point 2: <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A1_(%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אונס רחמנא פטריה</a></strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Every person has limitations, and <strong>pain is one of them and it does not matter who or what inflicts the pain</strong>. </p></li>\n<li><p>As for all other אונסים inflicted by others, it is up to the subject to decide on his compliance/observance as an אנוס. Therefore one can decide for himself how much pain he's willing to bear and keep Mitzvos accordingly.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Also does it take away the part one is reincarnated into a dog?</p>\n\n<p>PLEASE DO NOT DELETE MY FELLOW YIDIN IM ASKING THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE OTHER ONES SIMILAR DIDNT FULLY ANSWER THESE TO AN EXTENT.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Just to clarify -- if one wronged another person, then one must apologize to them as part of teshuva. Consensual behavior, however, would not require their apology.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is yes -- teshuva works. Rav Moshe Feinstein has a couple of responsa starting OC4:117 about teshuva for various intimate acts; the common theme to them is \"yes it was a sin; you should regret it, stop doing it [and avoid situations where you're tempted or triggered], confess it to God, and commit to do better; maybe fast once a month for a few months and say some extra Psalms if you can. But any exaggerated language about automatically wiping out your soul, or worse than all other sins or whatnot -- aren't literal.\" Rambam's Laws of Teshuva, similarly, has a bunch of categories of sins and their punishments; none of this reincarnation and the like stuff. (He also acknowledges that some texts exaggerated the punishment for certain acts; they meant \"if you do this habitually\", not if it happened once and the person repented.)</p>\n\n<p>I'd heard an Orthodox psychologist at an OU event mention a similar point -- a lot of people tell them they feel so guilty that they believe teshuva won't work; he points out to them that starts to sound like another religion. We have laws that we follow, and those include teshuva.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/93451/21\">As discussed on a similar matter</a>, while sincere regret is required, the goal needs to be to get <em>more</em> involved in Torah and mitzvos, not less; someone who is so paralyzed by guilt of their past that they don't go to synagogue, for example, is just compounding their problem.</p>\n\n<p><em>Pischei Teshuva</em> YD1:6 tells of a kosher butcher who wants to confess to a rabbi on his deathbed: <em>Rabbi ... there was once a non-Jewish woman ... and unrelated to that ... I had a drinking problem; sometimes I was drunk when slaughtering animals and didn't use the right kosher technique.</em> The rabbis agonize about that second half of the confession -- what do we now tell all the people who bought meat from this fellow, and are their dishes kosher? The first half of the confession gets no discussion at all. </p>\n\n<p>(Don't get me wrong -- it is wrong and don't do it! But if someone sincerely repented about it, they have to move forward.)</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, his sleeping self allows for certain prayers to be said that cannot be said without a minyan. I would suggest that this counts towards (at least) your question about doing \"good things\" while asleep.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to the article cited by @rosends a person who is sleeping maybe allowed to be counted in the Minyan with regards to Chazaras Hashatz.  In that same article he notes: \"Regarding one who is sleeping, we may not be lenient with more than one, Mishnah Berurah 55:32.)\". It is a leniency to allow the Chazaras Hashatz to begin the repetition if only one person is sleeping.</p>\n\n<p>However, a person who is sleeping is 1/60th dead, and is in no-way competent. Would one be rewarded for potentially not doing an aveirah or doing any of the 365 negative commandments because he is asleep?  I would think not.  A negative commandment requires a positive choice to do so.  Being asleep hardly qualifies as being in a state of competency for being rewarded for mitzvos.  </p>\n\n<p>It is well-known that the effects of the day on a person's mental state can have a positive/negative affect on his subconscious state.  For example, seeing a snake would possibly lead a person to dream about snakes (assuming this would affect him deeply).  It is therefore more important to focus on one's day to ensure that Torah and mitzvos affect him deeply so that they would have a positive affect on his neshama.</p>\n\n<p>I would be very careful about earphones in one's head while one sleeps.  A person who tosses and turns (which is very common) could easily be strangled by the wires.</p>\n\n<p>If there is strong medical evidence to suggest that listening to Torah while one sleeps is effective, then it would make sense to listen specifically to the Chumash or Tanakh being leined.  Since this area of Torah imparts kedusha, even if one does not understand it, it may be worthwhile.  However, listening to Torah that requires understanding sounds to me like a pointless exercise since you need to be conscious to understand it.</p>\n\n\n",

In each case he is quoting earlier commentaries. In 1:12, the point about learning mussar originally comes from the Birchei Yosef, and is also quoted in the Sha'arei Teshuva. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7626&st=&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Birchei Yosef O.C. 1:9</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם ראוי לכל ת\"ח שיקבע עת כפעם בפעם ללמוד בספרי מוסר כי כל הגדול מחבירו יצרו גדול  ואיידי דטריד בגופי הלכות ומחדש בטובו חידושי תורה קרוב שיגבה לבו וכיוצא וקבלתי כי בכלל משז\"ל דתורה תבלין ליצה\"ר הוא תוכחת מוסר מרז\"ל קמאי ובתראי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x339\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'arei Teshuva O.C. 1:7</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובברכי יוסף כתב שראוי לקבוע עת ללמוד בספרי מוסר כי כל הגדול כו' וקבלתי כי תבלין היצה\"ר הוא תוכחת מוסר מאמרי חז\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Mishnah Berurah mentioned it here because the earlier commentaries mentioned it here. Now you might then ask why the earlier commentaries mentioned it here, especially considering that it doesn't seem very relevant to the text of the Shulchan Aruch here which states that it is better to recite fewer supplications with proper intent than more supplications without proper intent. However, if you trace the comment back to the Birchei Yosef, you will notice that it is actually a comment on the <em>next</em> statement of the Shulchan Aruch, where it lists various parts of the Torah that are good to say every day. Commenting on <em>that</em> the Birchei Yosef adds that it's also good to learn a bit of mussar every day.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to the Mishnah Berurah in 155:3, though, he doesn't quote this statement about learning mussar because it doesn't fit the context of the discussion there. The Shulchan Aruch there is setting out the idea of there being a basic obligation to learn a certain discrete amount of Torah every day. In explaining that obligation the Mishnah Berurah turns to Yoreh Deiah siman 246, where the obligation of daily Torah study is explained. His comment in 155:3 is basically a paraphrase of the comment of the Shach in Yoreh Deiah there, which itself is a quote of the Derisha's comment to the Tur there. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6714\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shach Y.D. 246:5</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתב הדרישה יש בעלי בתים נוהגים ללמוד בכל יום גפ\"ת ולא שאר פוסקים ומביאים ראיה מהא דאמרינן סוף (נדרים) [נדה] תנא דבי אליהו כל השונה הלכות בכל יום מובטח לו שהוא בן עולם הבא אבל ל\"נ שיש ללמוד ספרי הפוסקים דיני התורה כמו הרי\"ף ומרדכי והרא\"ש ודומיהן דזהו שורש ועיקר לתורתנו ואינם יוצאים כלל בלימוד גמפ\"ת דהא דתנא דבי אליהו כו' כבר כתב רש\"י שם השונה הלכות פירוש הלכות פסוקות ומ\"ש ר\"ת כאן ש\"ס בבלי בלול כו' קאי אמש\"כ לפני זה אלימוד ט' שעות ביום דכיון שיש לו פנאי גדול ילמוד בש\"ס אבל הנך בעלי בתים שאינם לומדים רק ג' או ד' שעות לא ילמדו בש\"ס לחוד כנ\"ל ע\"כ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6223\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derisha Y.D. 246:2</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש בעלי בתים נוהגין ללמוד בכל יום גפ\"ת ולא שאר פוסקים ומביאים ראיה מהא דאמרינן סוף פרק בתרא דנדרים תנא דבי אליהו כל השונה הלכות בכל יום מובטח לו שהוא בן העולם הבא אבל לי נראה כי לא זאת המרגוע ולא בזאת יתהלל המתהלל כי אם בזאת יתהלל השכל וידוע בספרי פוסקים דיני תורה כגון האלפסי והמרדכי והרא\"ש ודומיהם דזהו שורש ועיקר לתורתנו ואינם יוצאים כלל בלימוד גמרא פירוש תוספות דהא דתנא דבי אליהו וכו' כבר כתב רש\"י שם כל השונה הלכות פירוש הלכות פסוקות ומ\"ש רבינו תם כאן תלמוד בבלי בלול וכו' קאי אמ\"ש רבינו לפני זה אלימוד תשע שעות ביום דכיון שיש לו פנאי גדול ילמוד בתלמוד אבל הנך בעלי בתים שאינם לומדים כי אם ג' או ד' שעות לא ילמדו בתלמוד לחוד כנ\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no reason for the Mishnah Berurah here to quote the Birchei Yosef's comment that it is good to learn mussar, because despite it being a good thing to learn mussar it is not part of the parameters of the obligation of daily Torah study.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>\"Technically\", <strong>Mussar, unlike learning the Gemmorah, does not constitute a \"pure\" Limud Torah.</strong> (<em>I know many confuse and call Limud Torah to all Torah related activities, that's why I said \"technically\"</em>)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There are two purposes in learning Torah: 1.

The second way obligates a Berachah.

    "content": "# Moving things around \"opposite the gap\" in an enclosure on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On <em>Shabbat</em> there are mitigating structures whose presence can enclose an area physically, constituting a necessary ingredient in allowing movement of objects within that area.</p>\n\n<p>There are several shapes and sizes of gaps in the enclosure that do not invalidate it. (See some details <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/14710/3\">here</a>.) In discussing the parameters of the permissible gaps, many writers on the topic state that moving things around is allowed \"[even] opposite the gaps\", and not only \"opposite the solid part\".</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Eruvin.1.8.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ra'av on Eruvin 1:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פרוץ כעומד, הוי מחיצה ואף כנגד הפרוץ מותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berurah.362.48?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna B'rura 362:48</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואפילו כנגד הפרוץ מותר לטלטל דיש ע\"ז דין מחיצה שלמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These word choices are presumably based on the same phrasing that appears in the discussion of barriers that allow the planting of crops whose proximity would otherwise be forbidden. The two bodies of law are explicitly used to inform one another, and some of the qualifications for barriers are carried over to enclosures.</p>\n\n<p>E.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.10b.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y'rushalmi Eruvin 1:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>,לענין כלאים כל הפחות מג' כסתום. מג' ועד ארבעה אם העומד רבה על הפרוץ מותר ואם הפרוץ רבה על העומד אסור. מארבע ועד עשר אם העומד רבה על הפרוץ מותר, <strong>אם הפרוץ רבה על העומד כנגד העומד מותר, כנגד הפרוץ אסור</strong>. יותר מעשר אע\"פ שהעומד רבה על הפרוץ כנגד העומד מותר. כנגד הפרוץ אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is clear what \"opposite the gap\" means when dealing with where one may not put seeds in the ground because the whole purpose of the barrier is to separate/delineate between two nearby groups of plants. </p>\n\n<p><strong>When the phrase is applied to moving things around the campsite on <em>shabas</em> what does \"opposite the gap\" mean?</strong> Some hypotheses that come to mind are </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>just inside the gap and up close to it, exactly like in the plants case (which would be strange as conceptually none of these laws have to do with things happening up close to the enclosing structure),</li>\n<li>anywhere in the airspace bounded by the ends of the gap and projected inward perpendicular to the wall that the gap is in (which just seems odd),</li>\n<li>in the airspace between two gaps that are across from one another (along a line parallel to the closest edge between them? The existence of such a space is significant in nearby discussions, so maybe it's relevant.).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>None of these is obvious and they are all a bit more of a stretch than I would expect for nobody to say anything, which is what I've found.</p>\n\n<p><sub>The question has no practical application, as it only comes up as a consideration to be excluded (a <em>hava amina</em>?). It is a methodological one.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

For instance, G-d spoke at Mount Sinai to millions of Jews.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As explained by Rambam, God does not actually have a \"voice\". God is simply described that way because that is how the human mind can understand the nature of communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 1:46</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The perception by the senses, especially by hearing and seeing, is best known to us; we have no idea or notion of any other mode of communication between the soul of one person and that of another than by means of speaking, i.e., by the sound produced by lips, tongue, and the other organs of speech. When, therefore, we are to be informed that God has a knowledge of things, and that communication is made by Him to the Prophets who convey it to us, they represent Him to us as seeing and hearing, i.e., as perceiving and knowing those things which can be seen and heard. They represent Him to us as speaking, i.e., that communications from Him reach the Prophets; that is to be understood by the term \"prophecy,\" as will be fully explained. God is described as working, because we do not know any other mode of producing a thing except by direct touch. He is said to have a soul in the sense that He is living, because all living beings are generally supposed to have a soul; although the term soul is, as has been shown, a homonym.</p>\n<p>Again, since we perform all these actions only by means of corporeal organs, we figuratively ascribe to God the organs of locomotion, as feet, and their soles; organs of hearing, seeing, and smelling, as ear, eye, and nose; organs and substance of speech, as mouth, tongue, and sound; organs for the performance of work, as hand, its fingers, its palm, and the arm. In short, these organs of the body are figuratively ascribed to God, who is above all imperfection, to express that He performs certain acts; and these acts are figuratively ascribed to Him to express that He possesses certain perfections different from those acts themselves. E.g., we say that He has eyes, ears, hands, a mouth, a tongue, to express that He sees, hears, acts, and speaks: but seeing and hearing are attributed to Him to indicate simply that He perceives. You thus find in Hebrew instances in which the perception of the one sense is named instead of the other; thus, \"See the word of the Lord\" (Jer. ii, 31), in the same meaning as \"Hear the word of the Lord,\" for the sense of the phrase is, \"Perceive what He says\"; similarly the phrase, \"See the smell of my son\" (Gen. xxvii. 27) has the same meaning as \"Smell the smell of my son,\" for it relates to the perception of the smell. In the same way are used the words, \"And all the people saw the thunders and the lightnings\" (Exod. xx. 15), although the passage also contains the description of a prophetical vision, as is well known and understood among our people. Action and speech are likewise figuratively applied to God, to express that a certain influence has emanated from Him, as will be explained (chap. lxv and chap. lxvi.)(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp056.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 1:65</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AFTER YOU have advanced thus far, and truly comprehended that God exists\nwithout having the attribute of existence, and that He is One, without having the attribute of unity, I do not think that I need explain to you the inadmissibility of the attribute of speech in reference to God, especially since our people generally believe that the Law, i.e., the word ascribed to Him, was created. Speech is attributed to Him, in so far as the word which Moses heard, was produced and brought to existence by God in the same manner as He produced all His other works and creations. As we shall have to speak more fully on prophecy, we shall here merely show that speech is attributed to God in the same way as all other actions, which are similar to our own. When we are told that God addressed the Prophets and spoke to them, our minds are merely to receive a notion that there is a Divine knowledge to which the Prophets attain; we are to be impressed with the idea that the things which the Prophets communicate to us come from the Lord, and are not altogether the products of their own conceptions and ideas. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp075.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ibid</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The two terms, when applied to God, can only have one of the two last-mentioned significations, viz., he wills and he desires, or he thinks, and there is no difference whether the divine thought became known to man by means of an actual voice, or by one of those kinds of inspiration which I shall explain further on (II. chap. xxxviii.). We must not suppose that in speaking God employed voice or sound. or that He has a soul in which the thoughts reside, and that these thoughts are things superadded to His essence; but we ascribe and attribute to Him thoughts in the same manner as we ascribe to Him any other attributes.

One of the babies died and there was a dispute as to which one. There were no witnesses to consult and so Shlomo employs his wisdom, by suggesting to cut the baby in half and give each half to one of the women, to discern which woman is the true mother of the living child. </p>\n\n<p>My question is: what would the halacha dictate in this case? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In response to a question seeking <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_ben_Solomon_ibn_Abi_Zimra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radbaz</a>’s opinion as to what was so genius about King Solomon’s judgement (Resp. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1952&st=&pgnum=437\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§1059</a>), Radbaz considers from a halachic standpoint that one could advocate the opinion that a judge/court is permitted to remove an item from its possessor on the basis of circumstantial evidence (which King Solomon deduced).

The book is solely focused on how babies are made and does not cover concepts such as sex, intimacy, homosexuality. But it does cover sperm, eggs, vaginal delivery, c-section, and miscarriage in a friendly and easily understandable way for a toddler to understand.</p>\n<p>It can be jarring to picture teaching a 2 year old about sperm and eggs but we've found it to be very useful for our toddler. We're expecting another baby and our current child feels very caught up. Our daughter knows that the baby is growing in mom's uterus, and that the baby is made because I gave mom a sperm and mom gave an egg and we put them in the uterus and now the baby is growing.</p>\n<p>This book is not geared toward teaching any cultural or religious norms, so that would still be up to the parents to do. The book is not a replacement for the very real and necessary teachings about sexuality and intimacy that is incumbent upon every parent to teach their child.

This suggests that when the Torah instructs one to \"wash\" himself to remove <em>tumah</em>, it is not talking about immersion in water. If so, then mikvaot as we know them and all their halachos evolved over time.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any evidence in the Gemara for this? If not, then what are we to make of the absence of mikvaot from the Biblical era?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>טהרות: מיכתב כתיבן לא נצרכא אלא לשיעור מקוה דלא כתיבא דתניא ורחץ (את בשרו) במים במי מקוה את כל בשרו מים שכל גופו עולה בהן וכמה הן אמה על אמה ברום שלש אמות ושיערו חכמים מי מקוה ארבעים סאה</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Talmud Tractate Chagigah 11a</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here the Talmud discusses the origin of Mikvaos and says (paraphrased translation mine):</p>\n\n<p>\"The concept of ritual cleansing is written in the Torah (Bible), but the amount of water is not spelled out. For we have learned: (quoting verse in Leviticus, 15:16) <strong>\"..and he shall wash with water..\"</strong> This means that he must bathe in a ritual bath (Mikvah). <strong>\"...his entire flesh..\"</strong> This means to teach that he must immerse in enough water that can cover his entire body. And how much is that? It is the amount of water contained in a space measuring an \"Amah\" by an \"Amah\", by 3 \"Amos\" high. And the Sages measured this to be 40 \"Seah\" of water.</p>\n\n<p>(This is roughly 2 feet by 2 feet by 6 feet filled with water, (opinions vary) . Rav Yaakov Kanievsky (in his work: \"Shiurin shel Torah\") gives the modern amount at about 750 litres which is about 200 U.S. gallons of water. (again opinions vary))</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the Talmud understood the verse to mean immersion; and the verse itself suggests immersion because it says \"his entire flesh\", which is taken to be an act that can simultaneously cause water to wash the entire body at once.</p>\n\n<p>This is also supported by the verse in leviticus 11:36:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"But a spring, or a cistern, a gathering of water (Mikveh), will be clean...\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a proof that the Torah grants ritual cleanliness only to a source of water attached to the ground. So it is immersion, <strong>and not</strong> sponging water all over the body limb by limb.</p>\n\n<p>There is no Talmudic opinion that allows removal of ritual impurity of a Biblical nature to be cleansed by rubbing water over the body. Rather the entire Talmud is full of examples and laws about immersion.</p>\n\n<p>So now that we know that the Talmud reflects an absolute opinion on Biblical Mikvah being an immersion into a body of water in the ground, what do we do about the OP's observation?:</p>\n\n<p>\"Archaeology has uncovered hundreds of ancient Mikvaot in Israel. They all date from the Second Temple era or later.\" </p>\n\n<p>There are two answers:</p>\n\n<p>1) First, I would not expect too many finds of stepped mikvah structures to be discovered from the times of Joshuah because people were not so into building lavish structures back then, and would have been more used to immersing in lakes, rivers, springs, cave-pools, or the ocean. </p>\n\n<p>So what about the 1st Temple period?</p>\n\n<p>The Ophel City Walls Archaeological site (also known as the \"Water Gate\") in the Jerusalem National Park area, had a new section opened to public view in 2011.</p>\n\n<p>Although the site area has \"layers\" of discovery from Ummayad, Byzantine, Roman, Herodian and Hasmonean eras; it also has been revealed to expose in its deepest area, 1st Temple and \"King Solomon\" aged structures and pottery from the 8th - 10th centuries B.C.E.</p>\n\n<p>And among the areas dated to 1st Temple times are to be found quite a few Mikvahs.</p>\n\n<p>Kathleen Kenyon claimed the area was 8-10th century, and the current excavators/researchers under the Israeli Antiquities department, the late archaeologist Benjamin Mazar and his granddaughter Eilat Mazar, agree.</p>\n\n<p>2) There is an \"age old\" trap that laymen tend to fall into when assuming things about the \"science\" of archaeology. They think its like math or developing new drugs. A man with a degree in archaeology should be just as trustworthy as someone with a dental license operating on a root canal?</p>\n\n<p>NOPE. It just isn't true.</p>\n\n<p>Archaeology has only been around for about 200 years. It has not proven to be an exact science. Major so-called authorities argue about the \"facts\" extremely and quite often. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, most dig sites have been traditionally funded by royalty or government; specifically England and specifically in Egypt, since digs are expensive, and Egypt was a popular target of the rich.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli archaeology is still in its infancy. New things are being found every day. It also takes <strong>many many years</strong> to advance in the field due to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The speed at which you can gently sift and brush away layers of earth so you do not damage anything.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finding the right place</p></li>\n<li><p>Getting funded, and finding volunteers to help.</p></li>\n<li><p>Dealing with war, and local upheaval</p></li>\n<li><p>Government red tape</p></li>\n<li><p>Being stopped for years on and off because the Arabs protest dig sites thinking you are going to damage Arab interests; as well as religious Jews (and others) worrying about violating graves.</p></li>\n<li><p>Family politics - Archaeology is an inherited science where the community respects the rights of individuals and their close students or blood relatives, to claim <strong>exclusive</strong> access to materials and sites. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(That's one reason why the Dead Sea Scrolls found in 1947-49 have taken so long to be revealed to the public (30 - 60 years!) due to the refusal of some scholars to part with their scrolls in their possession.)</p>\n\n<p>So there are two ways to argue for a claim:</p>\n\n<p>1) based on finding evidence</p>\n\n<p>2) based on not finding evidence. This is called the \"argument from silence\" and is usually considered a logical fallacy or a very weak argument. </p>\n\n<p>The British press announced that archaeologists dug outside London and discovered a network of metal scrap wires dated to 500 BCE, proving that ancient Britons had invented the telegraph!</p>\n\n<p>The French news announced that archaeologists dug outside Paris and found a network of small fiber particles dated to 600 BCE proving that the ancient Franks had fiber-optics!</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli Arutz-Sheva news announced in return that archaeologists outside Tel-Aviv dug and dug and dug and dug and found ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! ... proving that ancient Israeites must have already invented cellphones!</p>\n\n<p>So if you have not found any Mikvahs from before the 2nd Temple, it doesn't mean that it is \"proof\" they didn't exist; rather it means you need to buy a shovel and go dig. :)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The concept of a mikvaot is discussed in the Mishna - there's even an entire tractate dedicated to it.</p>\n\n<p>This is called (not surprisingly) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Mikvaot.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tractate Mikvaot</a> and is 10 chapters long.</p>\n\n<p>Mishnayot are the Oral Law that was given at Sinai together with the Written law; so these laws didn't evolve over time but always existed.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that archeologists can't find 2m x 2m holes in the ground that date back 3,000 years is not proof of anything. How on earth do you date a hole? Besides, if they were around they were probably re-used and refurbished during a later period, hence giving them the appearance of being from later periods.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Just an additonal thought - it is a machlokes rishonim whether the issur of mayim sheuvim (the prohibition to use \"drawn waters\") for a mikvah is Min HaTorah or Miderabonon.</p>\n<p>According the the opinion of the ר“ש and the ר“י, it is only derabonon, which would mean that we would not expect to see specially constructed mikvaos in earlier times before this particular halacha was legislated. This would explain perfectly the reason why only in later times we find mikvaos hewn into the ground.</p>\n<p>According to the other rishonim I expect we would need to use David Kenner's answers.</p>\n<p>I hope this helps!</p>\n\n\n",

R' Hirsch doesn't say the following explicitly here, but this choice strikes me as fitting into a general pattern that the origins and leadership of the Jewish nation are almost never the obvious choice - the firstborn, the biggest, or the strongest. Examples of this pattern include Sheit, Sheim, all three Avot, the various leaders among Yaakov's sons, Moshe, and David. See also R' Hirsch on <a href=\"https://www.Sefaria.org/Genesis.17.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 17:17</a> (a personal favorite of mine;)  where he talks about the joke that gave Yitzchak his name - incongruous success in extremely improbable conditions - being part of the essential message of the ongoing existence of the Jewish nation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, R' Hirsch talks about the exemplary way in which Leah overcame the adversity of her situation. She maintained her trust in God and worked, over time, to build a loving relationship between herself and Yaakov, based on her role as his children's mother. In his commentary on the following verses (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.29.32-35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32 - 35</a>), R' Hirsch demonstrates how this building relationship is tracked in the names of Leah's first four sons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Until Reuven, it was <em>visible</em> that Yaakov preferred Rachel.</p></li>\n<li><p>Until Shim'on, Yaakov's preference was subtler, but still detectable by <em>listening</em> to him talk.</p></li>\n<li><p>With Levi's arrival, Yaakov and Leah felt a strong marital attachment, like they <em>owed</em> everything to eat other. It's clear that this feeling was now mutual because Yaakov declared this name.</p></li>\n<li><p>After that, having built a solid, loving marriage, Leah could enjoy her next son for his own sake, and burst out in <em>thanks</em> to God.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus, the difficulties of Leah and how she responded provide many archetypal lessons for the Jewish nation whose foundation she was building.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reconciling Seder Olam’s account of Ever’s death with the Pesukim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabbah 2</a> says that Ever died when Yaakov left his Yeshiva for Charan. </p>\n\n<p>In the previous portions of this paragraph, the Midrash said that Yaakov was 63 when he got the Berachos, and he stayed by Ever for 14 years. At the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.1.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end of chapter 1</a>, Seder Olam said that Yaakov served Avraham for 15 years, and we know that Avraham died at 175 (Bereishis 25:7). We also know that Ever lived for 464 years (Bereishis 11:16-17); this means that he was 464-14-63-(175-15)=227 when Avraham was born. </p>\n\n<p>We also know, from Bereishis 11:16-26, that Ever was 34 when he had Peleg; Peleg was 30 when he had Re’u; Re’u was 32 when he had Serug; Serug was 30 when he had Nachor; Nachor was 29 when he had Terach; and Terach was 70 when he had Avraham. Adding this up gives us only 225. So what happened to the other two years?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now, maybe you’ll tell me that Avraham was in fact the youngest of his siblings, and for whatever reason, the Passuk lists them out of order. In this case, Avraham would have been born two years later, which would solve the problem. However, Seder Olam Rabbah explicitly says that Avraham was 48 at the Dor Haflagah, which was at the end of Peleg’s life. Since Peleg lived for 239 years (Bereishis 11:18-19), combining this with the above numbers indeed gives us that Avraham was 48; but he would have been 50 if we shift everything by two years, as I proposed above. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The fact that the Dor Haflagah took place at the end of Peleg’s life is also off by two years by this account. Since Ever was 34 when Peleg was born, and Peleg lived for 239 years, Ever <em>should</em> be 273 years old at the time of the Dor Haflagah. But if we take the fact that Ever was 227 when Avraham was born according to the Midrash, then Ever should be 275 at the time of the Dor Haflagah!</p>\n\n<p>How can this Midrash be reconciled with the Pesukim, when it causes a two-year discrepancy in these dates?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I am aware of the opinion that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/22242/9682\">Yitzchak was in Gan Eden for two years</a>. While this is fine to answer many questions on the Parsha, this Midrash, which clearly states that Yaakov and Avraham overlapped for fifteen years, rather than thirteen years, cannot he answered in this manner. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think you're missing the key phrase in Seder Olam that makes everything work out:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועבר מת אחר ירידתו של יעקב אבינו לארם נהרים <strong>שתי שנים</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>And Ever died after Yaakov's descent to Aram Naharaim [by] <strong>two years</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, we can construct the following timeline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 464 when he died</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereishis 11:16-17</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 462 when Yaakov left him</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Seder Olam subtract two years that he lived after Yaakov left</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 448 when Yaakov came to him</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Seder Olam subtract 14 years that Yaakov was with him</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 400 when Avraham died</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Seder Olam subtract (63 - 15) years that Yaakov lived after Avraham died</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 385 when Yaakov was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Seder Olam subtract 15 years that Yaakov served Avraham</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 325 when Yitzchak was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereishis 25:26 subtract 60 years for Yitzchak's age at Yaakov's birth</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 225 when Avraham was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereishis 21:5 subtract 100 years for Avraham's age at Yitzchak's birth</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And we can see that this fits perfectly with the other timeline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 34 when Peleg was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereishis 11:16</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 64 when Reu was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereishis 11:18 add the 30 years of Peleg's age when Reu was born</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 96 when Serug was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereshis 11:20 add the 32 years of Reu's age when Serug was born</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 126 when Nachor was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereshis 11:22 add the 30 years of Serug's age when Nachor was born</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 155 when Terach was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereishis 11:24 add the 29 years of Nachor's age when Terach was born</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ever was 225 when Avraham was born</strong></p>\n\n<p>As per Bereishis 11:26 add the 70 years of Terach's age when Avraham was born</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This also fits perfectly with the Dor Haflaga angle. If Ever was 225 when Avraham was born then Peleg must have been 191 when Avraham was born.

    "content": "# Are There Two Kinds of \"Don't Read\" Expositions?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.eichlers.com/the-practical-talmud-dictionary-hardcover.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Practical Talmud Dictionary</a>, by Yitzchak Frank, one can read that there are two kinds of “don’t read” expositions: one “not only in accordance with its Masoretic vocalization, but in accordance with its spelling that allows for a different vocalization as well”; and the other “not only in accordance with the way it is actually spelled, but… also as if two of its letters were transposed.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NQ6aX.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/NQ6aX.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Frank’s example of the first kind involves the addition of a Vav to a word, so apparently he refers to full and defective spellings here; and his example of the second kind is straight-forward.</p>\n\n<p>Then he adds a note that in one instance a word is read as if two letters were replaced by two other letters.</p>\n\n<p>I just don’t get what he’s saying.</p>\n\n<p>First, there are lots of changes in the Gemara that are neither of the kinds Frank mentions, that is, neither the addition (or omission) of vowel letters nor the transposition of two letters. There are examples with absolutely no change of letters (such as Ex 32:16 at Avos 06:02; Ex 23:25 at Berachos 48b; Num 21:14 at Kiddushin 30b; Isaiah 02:22 at Berachos 14a; Psalms 46:09 at Berachos 07b; and Proverbs 19:23 at Berachos 14a). There are changes that involve only the addition of a space within a word, as with Gen 01:01 at Succah 49a. There are examples that involve only the change of a single letter (Num 11:05 at Berachos 32a; and Psalms 29:02 at Berachos 30b), or involving more than two letters other than the singleton that Frank mentions in his afterthought, Deut 07:07 at Kiddushin 30a: Deut 08:09 at Ta'anis 04a; 1 Samuel 02:02 at Berachos 10a; and Ecclesiastes 08:10 at Gittin 56b.</p>\n\n<p>But secondly, I just don’t get why this kind of classification is at all helpful. Is the distinction that Frank makes, between vowel-letter changes on the one hand and two-letter transpositions on the other, somehow useful in understanding the Gemara?</p>\n\n\n",

So far, I have found the Mayanot Institute in Israel but I am looking around for others. </p>\n\n<p>I'm new to this sub, as well, so I hope you'll pardon me if my question is poorly suited to it.

Is there a mystical meaning why both \"arrival\" and \"intercession\" emanate from the same Hebrew word? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is a common source put forth for both arrival and intercession, and it is the concept of <em>contact</em> (=נגיעה). The word appears in parallel to a number of other terms of entreaty in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.7.16?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Yirmiyahu</em> 7:16</a>. There, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_David_Luzzatto\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shada\"l</a> addresses (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/shadalnavi/shadalnavi02.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pp. 28-29</a>) the question of what a term of touching is doing in the context of supplication.</p>\n\n<p>וְאַתָּ֞ה, אַל <strong>תִּתְפַּלֵּ֣ל</strong> בְּעַד הָעָ֣ם הַזֶּ֗ה, וְאַל תִּשָּׂ֧א בַעֲדָ֛ם <strong>רִנָּ֥ה</strong> וּ<strong>תְפִלָּ֖ה</strong>. וְאַל <strong>תִּפְגַּע</strong> בִּ֑י כִּי אֵינֶ֥נִּי שֹׁמֵ֖עַ אֹתָֽךְ</p>\n\n<p>Shada\"l explains that the relevant phrase means \"don't beg me\", invoking a term of physical contact like the kind one might make while trying to persuade the object of their plea to fulfil a request. (I assume he means that contact to be figurative, but maybe not.)</p>\n\n<p>So the sense of <em>arrival</em> would derive directly from <em>contact</em> as one's making contact bodily with a <em>place</em>. And the sense of intercession would be a less direct kind of <em>contact</em> that one makes in the course of <em>approaching</em> the one to whom they are interceding.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the comment Shada\"l refers the reader to <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Bikurei Ha'itim</em></a> 5589 (p. 93 of <a href=\"http://ia800301.us.archive.org/1/items/bikurehaitimhemp910cohe/bikurehaitimhemp910cohe.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this PDF</a>; beware that the pages are in order that an English book would be so you have to skip up and down), which says that פ.ג.ע is in turn derived from נ.ג.ע. These both relate to two things coming in contact whereas their counterparts, פ.ג.ש and נ.ג.ש, have to do with two things approaching but not touching. In this way, the other senses of פ.ג.ע are all explained as forms of contact, for better or worse:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>meeting</em>, as the angry mob did to Moshe and Aharon on their way out of an audience with <em>Par'o</em> because they constricted their ability to continue on their way.</li>\n<li><em>meeting</em>, as the manner of encounter between a manslaughterer and his victim's relative, in which vengeful physical contact is made.</li>\n<li><em>attack</em>, by striking.</li>\n<li><em>bordering</em>, in which one territory touches another.</li>\n<li><em>interceding</em>, as in Avraham soliciting help from the <em>Chitim</em> for his appeal to Efron. The more direct/proximate verb פ.ג.ע is appropriate for this type of appeal, where one knows that the recipient will be unwilling to part with the object of the request and therefore, presumably, needs a no-holds-barred pleading. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reasons for Yaakov ignoring his parents for 22 years in Haran\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemmorah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.17a.6?lang=he&with=Steinsaltz&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilla 17a</a> states that Yaakov was punished for not honoring his parents during 22 years(!) of his stay in Haran. His punishment was that his son Yossef was also \"cut off\" from him for 22 years:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ומנלן דלא מיענש? דתניא, נמצא יוסף שפירש מאביו עשרים ושתים שנה<br />\nכשם שפירש יעקב אבינו מאביו. דיעקב תלתין ושיתא הויין,<br />\nאלא ארביסר דהוה בבית עבר לא חשיב להו\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Evidently, the Gemmorah sees Yaakov's negligence as sinful and worthy of punishment, rather than thoughtful and considerate. I fail to see why Yaakov couldn't keep in touch with his parents, given the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Yaakov was a free man and could send messengers to his parents pretty freely, at the expense of his very wealthy father.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Yaakov could send angels, that he sent to Esau.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>He was the sole heir, and his parents were clearly very concerned about the continuation of their Jewish lineage. His whereabouts were probably not a big secret from the rest of the family.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Yaakov didn't even inform his parents about the birth of their grandchildren, fulfilling God's (and Yitzhak's) plans that had brought him to Haran in the first place.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What might be the reasons for Yaakov's negligence and the lack of honor for his parents Itzhak and Rivkah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Parameters of honoring parents in deed are discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/97023/what-constitutes-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9C-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A7%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A9-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%A1%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A1-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%90-in-honoring-parents\">here</a>. The main reason that Yaakov could not do so, was due to very tight conditions placed on him by Lavan. It played negatively into description of his character as a wholesome man, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.27?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 25:27</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַֽיִּגְדְּלוּ֙ הַנְּעָרִ֔ים וַיְהִ֣י עֵשָׂ֗ו אִ֛ישׁ יֹדֵ֥עַ צַ֖יִד אִ֣ישׁ שָׂדֶ֑ה וְיַעֲקֹב֙ <strong>אִ֣ישׁ תָּ֔ם</strong> יֹשֵׁ֖ב אֹהָלִֽים׃</p>\n<p>When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the outdoors; but Jacob became a <strong>wholesome man</strong>, raising livestock.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that when Yaakov tried to do anything he put all his heart and mind into the task at hand at expense of everything else. He focused on loving Rachel, raising his children, and his job. But Leah felt unloved even though Yaakov loved her too. Children of Leah felt jealousy towards children from Rachel, and children of maidservants were neglected as a result. His job took over the rest of his time and mind, given the level of detail the Torah gives it compared to giving much less detail to more important points.</p>\n<p>Because of the tight conditions in the Lavan's contract, Yaakov is asking Bereshis 30:25-34:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Give me leave to go back to my own homeland.  Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served you, that I may go; for well you know what services I have rendered you.”  But Laban said to him, “If you will indulge me, I have learned by divination that Hashem has blessed me on your account.” And he continued, “Name the wages due from me, and I will pay you.” But he said, “You know well how I have served you and how your livestock has fared with me. For the little you had before I came has grown to much, since Hashem has blessed you wherever I turned. And now, when shall I make provision for my own household?” He said, “What shall I pay you?” And Jacob said, “Pay me nothing! If you will do this thing for me, I will again pasture and keep your flocks: let me pass through your whole flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted animal—every dark-colored sheep and every spotted and speckled goat. Such shall be my wages. In the future when you go over my wages, let my honesty toward you testify for me: if there are among my goats any that are not speckled or spotted or any sheep that are not dark-colored, they got there by theft.”\nAnd Laban said, “Very well, let it be as you say.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, due to tight contract imposed by Lavan, Yaakov did not have any additional resources to send to his parents, nor ability to visit with his family, nor even ability to travel by himself, or do anything that constitutes honoring parents in deed. This is an example, when a choice in life can cause difficulties limiting person's abilities even to honor parents.</p>\n\n\n",

Here is my rough translation (copied from there), with emphasis on the pertinent part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With this introduction, these Pesukim can be explained, when they say \"He who hits a man and he dies\" (מכה איש ומת מות יומת, which is an Aveirah that is punishable by death), this refers to Moshe Rabbeinu, who killed the Mitzri called \"ISH Mitzri\", <strong>and if this would have been purposeful, his judgment should have been to be killed.</strong> However, since the purpose of the intention of Moshe was to help and fix his Neshama by killing him with the Shem Hameforash, if so, he killed him Beshogeg (i.e. since his intentions were for good, even though he killed him, it is not punishable by death, rather by Galus), and this is why it continues \"Vaasher Lo Tzadah\", which refers to Moshe...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, there is a Gri\"z Al Hatorah that suggests that this action was \"Misah Bidei Shamaim\", punishing the Mitzri for hitting the Jew.  According to this (that it is considered a \"heaven\"-imposed death), I would imagine that one could argue that he should be exempt.</p>\n\n<p>--Part 2: Halacha</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://etzion.gush.net/shvut/073/73verhaf.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Here</a> is the authoritative Teshuvah on the topic, from Harav Warhaftig.  Among the highlights:</p>\n\n<p>The Steipler (Kehillos Ya'akov, Bava Kama 39) concludes that one would be Chayav according to Halacha:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא מצינו ראיה לפטור את הורג או מזיק לחבירו ע\"י שד (נראה דצ\"ל – שם) או ע\"י כישוף, ומצד הסברא הי' נראה לחייב כל היכא שהוא בכח ראשון, ואף שלא עשה מעשה בשל חבירו רק דיבורא בעלמא, הרי התוס' ב\"ק (ק,א) כתבו דכל היכא דבדיבורו קם דינא, חייב כדין אדם המזיק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Chida and Halachos Ketanos conclude similarly (sources in the article), although Rav Warhaftig argues the possibility of exempting such an individual based on various Halachic arguments. He also makes a similar suggestion to what I mentioned above in the name of the Gri\"z.</p>\n\n<p>...And <a href=\"http://forum.otzar.org/download/file.php?id=30729&sid=9183081ac77b6e764676dc749b276711\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>'s another comprehensive discussion, again in Hebrew.</p>\n\n\n",

Even a surface reading of the <em>Tanach</em> makes it clear that there were many customs which the Jews either had from ancient times, or had adopted from their surroundings. The <em>Tanach</em> isn't a history book and doesn't detail things that don't have importance for all time.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, it's interesting to examine the various terms for \"crown\". The first you cited is נזר, which we see that Shaul wore. It appears in the context of the High Priest, who also wore a נזר הקודש - the golden <em>tzitz</em>, a metaphorical crown - on top of his hat. (And this may be why the rabbis refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.4.13?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">three crowns</a>: one of kingship, one of priesthood [see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.66a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 66a]</a>, and one of Torah [possibly a reference to the crownlike border called the <em>zer</em> around the <em>aron</em>, ark, but also to the respect owed to a Torah scholar].)</p>\n\n<p>The second source you cite is of the word עטרת. Here we only see this in the context of David taking it from the head of an Ammonite king and putting it on his own head, a clear sign of transferal of power.</p>\n\n<p>The other Hebrew word for crown (common in modern Hebrew) is כתר. Interestingly, the only king who has this in <em>Tanach</em> is Ahasuerus in the book of Esther, but this word appears a lot in the Talmud.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&rtype=%25u05D8%25u05E2%25u05E7%25u05E1%25u05D8&hilchos=83&perek=2&halocha=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Melachim 2:5</a>) states about the king ומשים כתר בראשו, he places a crown on his head. So, contrary to the OP's assumption, it would appear that the Torah does instruct him to do so. (Now, it could be that the Rambam means it as an optional thing, but if so, why state it at all? A king presumably also has the option of choosing what color his royal robes will be, for example, but there's no need to codify that.)</p>\n<p>In fact, the Rogatchover (<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=21163#p=247\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzofnas Paaneach on Bereishis 42:8</a>) references in this connection a Gemara (Chagigah 16a) that says that anyone who gazes at a king (nassi), his eyes grow dim, and so suggests that this is precisely why he <strong>should</strong> wear a crown - so that they don't gaze at him. (Though I don't really understand that point - wouldn't that draw people's attention all the more? - unless he means that this way people will focus on the crown rather than on his face.)</p>\n\n\n",

Would it be permitted to read such a book on Shabbos kodesh?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>The short answer:</strong>\nIt is not forbidden per se, but not in the spirit of Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Long answer:</strong>\nThere are acts in Hilchos Shabbos that are actually forbidden like striking a match. These are defined as the 39 Melachos and their Toldos.</p>\n\n<p>But one has to ask oneself a pertinent question - why?  Why are creative/destructive acts purposefully forbidden?  </p>\n\n<p>The old argument is as follows: It is forbidden to strike a match - a seemingly simple act, and moving furniture around your apartment - assuming that's all you're doing - heavy lifting of sofas around - is permitted?</p>\n\n<p>The answer lies in the purpose of Shabbos - closeness to Hashem.  The point of Shabbos is to rest and become attuned to the Creator of the Universe.</p>\n\n<p>That is why the 39 Melachos are a framework of forbidden activity - but there are positive actions - making kiddish, having a lavish meal, Singing songs, spending time with family, learning divrei Torah make Shabbos into a spiritually rich experience.</p>\n\n<p>The spirit of Shabbos is just that - connecting with Hashem, so while reading magazines is not an intrinsic problem - assuming that you're just being entertained by them, and not thinking about doing a melacho with the material, then it is not forbidden, but it is not in the spirit of Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>The derivation of the Melachos of Shabbos comes from the building of the Mishkan (Bava Kama 2a).  That is all the forbidden actions were performed in building or doing something in the Mishkan. The Mishkan is a microcosm of Hashem's creative energy in a spatial manner in this world. We're severely lacking in our regard of this, because we don't have a Beis Hamikdash - but the idea is that the Mishkan is supposed to be spiritually infusing us with kedusha and holiness and the recognition that G-d really loves us and wants to be close.  In that sense we have Shabbos to re-connect with G-d, by not doing these creative acts, we're expressing G-d's will and presence in this world. So Shabbos is about creating that space of holiness every week.  </p>\n\n<p>Everyone has an interest.  Perhaps it might be helpful to get hold of \"The Midrash Says\" and read that specifically on Shabbos - the stories should be of entertaining value, give insights into the Parsha, and you'll learn something and create an atmosphere of holiness as a substitute to the magazines.</p>\n\n\n",

R’ Tzvi Pesach Frank (Har Tzvi OC 136) compares using a timer to later heat food to placing food on a stove that will be lit soon, which he argues is assur deoraisa. R’ Yehoshua Neuwirth (Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasa 1:26), the Chazon Ish (38:2-3) and R’ Benzion Abba Shaul (Ohr Letzion 2:30:18) write that while it isn’t assur deoraisa, one still can’t do so on Shabbos because it is a problem of gerama, causing something to happen (though one could ask a non-Jew to do so while it was off).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Either way, if you do this, <a href=\"https://doseofhalacha.blogspot.com/2018/11/accidental-cooking-on-shabbos.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">you are still allowed to eat it</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>.. The Gemara (Kesubos 34a, Chullin 15a) writes that if one transgressed a melacha on Shabbos, there is a machlokes as to whether they or others can benefit from it on Shabbos or afterwards. The Gemara discusses whether this prohibition is mideoraisa or miderabanan. Rambam (Shabbos 6:23) and the Shulchan Aruch (OC 318:1) follow R’ Yehuda and write that if one accidentally cooked food on Shabbos, everyone must wait until after Shabbos to eat it. The Vilna Gaon (Biur Hagra, OC 318:1), however, follows Tosafos and others who pasken like R’ Meir, who holds that may one eat such food on Shabbos.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berura (318:7) writes that while we should generally follow the Shulchan Aruch on this, if necessary, one can rely on the Vilna Gaon. Thus, if this was one’s main dish for their Shabbos meal, one could still serve it.</p>\n<p>The Pri Megadim (Eshel Avraham 318:10) and Mishna Berura (318:2) write that when there is a machlokes as to whether something is an issur or not, one doesn’t need to wait to benefit from it. Following the opinion in the Gemara that this prohibition against benefitting from forbidden melacha is miderabanan, we apply the rule of safek derabanan lekula, we are lenient in matters of Rabbinic doubt. As there are rishonim who maintain that ‘ein bishul achar bishul’ applies equally to liquids, one who accidentally reheated a liquid would not have to wait to eat it.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, one may serve food containing liquid that was accidentally reheated on Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes, even if he intentionally reheated the soup on an existing fire by mistake, he can eat it afterwards. The Chafetz Chaim in Biur Halacha (318, 4) rules this way since there are Rishonim who permit Bishul Achar Bishul with liquids that were cooled, and therefore we will not forbid its consumption after the fact.</p>\n\n\n",

I.e. one pshould not \"negotiate increase\" פְּרָס, when being hired. Rather, one should accept שְּׂכַר - the <em>objective reward</em> that Hashem offers us, when He is suggesting a mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Ramchal answers this himself in the chapters on Chassidut (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesillat_Yesharim.18?vhe=Shechem_Messilat_Yesharim&lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18</a> onwards). He explains that this madraga of being a Chassid, higher in the gemara than Tzaddik, is expressed by doing things for Hashem because you love Him. Therefore, you are not thinking of any reward, in the same way a devoted child is not looking for any reward when he serves his father. In 19, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The matter of love of G-d is that a person actually yearns and lusts\nfor closeness to G-d, blessed be He, and chases His holiness as one\nchases something he desires intensely. <strong>This is to the extent that\nmerely mentioning His Name, speaking of His praises, and occupying\nhimself with the words of His Torah or divinity literally becomes a\ndelight and pleasure, as one who strongly loves the wife of his youth\nor his only son, so that even speaking of them gives him gratification\nand pleasure</strong>. This is as scripture states: \"[Is Ephraim my dear son?\nIs he my delightful child?] For whenever I speak of him, I will\nremember him still\"(Yirmiyahu 31:19)....</p>\n<p>...However, he whose motivation in his divine service is to purify his\nsoul before his Creator in order to be worthy of sitting among the\nJust and the Pious, \"to gaze upon the pleasantness of G-d and to dwell\nwithin His sanctuary\", and receive the reward in the World to Come, we\ncertainly cannot say that his motive is evil.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we also cannot say that this is the best of\nmotives. For as long as a person is motivated by his own benefit, in\nessence, his divine service is for his own self-interest.</p>\n<p>But the true motivation which is found among the Pious, who have\nexerted themselves and strove to attain it, is for one to serve solely\nin order to raise and increase the honor of the Master, blessed be He.</p>\n<p><strong>This intent will come only after the love of Him has intensified\nwithin him</strong>, after he longs and lusts for the raising of His honor and\nis pained by any diminishing of it. For then he will perform the\ndivine service for this purpose, so that at least, through himself,\nG-d's honor will increase. [Rabbi Yosef Sebag translation]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This aligns with what <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.3?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=Rambam&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam says on this mishna</a>, and further elaborates on when he describes the concept of doing <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.10.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mitzvot Lishma in Mishneh Torah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone who occupies himself with the Torah in order to receive reward\nor in order to protect himself from retribution is considered as one\nwho is not occupied for the God's sake.</p>\n<p>[In contrast,] anyone who occupies himself with it, not because of\nfear, nor to receive a reward, <strong>but rather because of his love for the\nLord of the entire earth who commanded it, is one who occupies himself\nfor God's sake</strong>. [Rabbi Eliyahu Touger, Moznaim Publishing translation]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ramchal adds further details also in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Hashem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Purpose_of_Creation.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem, where he explains</a> what this reward and pleasure is - Hashem. I.e. Hashem is the perfect good that we will receive in Olam Haba:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>His desire, may He be blessed, was to do good to others, it would not\nbe sufficient for Him to do a little good, but rather [only] in giving\nthe full goodness that is possible for the creatures to receive. <strong>And\nin His alone, may He be blessed, being the true good</strong>, His good desire\nwould only be satisfied by giving others that very good that is within\nHim, may He be blessed, from the angle of Himself - which is the truly\nperfect good. [Rabbi Francis Nataf translation]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe points out in <a href=\"https://media.chabadinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PLS-Shemos-5781.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a sicha</a> an even stronger version of this question. We accepted Torah <em>b'mesiras nefesh</em>. This means we gave up our life to Him. We gave our heart, soul and might to Him, and that includes our desire for reward, our self gratification etc. So how can there even be any פְּרָס?</p>\n<p>The answer is as Ramchal explains - the reward we will receive is our connection to Hashem. To dwell with Him in Dveykut with the Kehilla Kedosha of Tzaddikim and Chassidim, forever:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of all this is to gather an eternal group for cleaving to Him, may He be blessed, in intimacy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe elaborates: the reward will be knowing how much we and our Mitzvot, our Avodah, meant to Him. <em>His</em> pleasure will be what we \"earned\", and thus our reward, and thus our selfless eternal good, and pleasure. See footnote 57 of Sicha aleph linked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, in the future (speedily in our days), it will be revealed to\neach and every one of Israel the Divine pleasure, which\nis beyond the reward for the mitzvot — the pleasure in creation itself\n(as discussed in Hemshech Ve'kacha, chapters 82 and 89) — a true\nrevelation of the Divine essence (see Likutei Sichot, vol. 5, p. 244\nand onward). This revelation is primarily achieved through the service\nof a simple servant specifically (as explained in Hemshech 5666 there,\nthat the main pleasure derives from the service of a simple servant),\nfor <strong>the simple servant's entire existence is solely the existence of\nthe master; he has no pleasure of his own, only \"the pleasure and\ndelight above,\" which becomes his own pleasure</strong> (see Hemshech 5666, p.\n326).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe these teachings work together, and can be unified and mutually-explained like this.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why Did God Directly Command Abraham to Sacrifice Isaac but Sent Angels to Stop Him?",
    "content": "# Why Did God Directly Command Abraham to Sacrifice Isaac but Sent Angels to Stop Him?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Genesis 21:1-3 says that God “tested” Abraham by commanding him to sacrifice his son Isaac and that Abraham immediately (or almost immediately) followed the directions God provided. 21:9-17 says that Abraham was just about to slaughter Isaac when an angel called out to him not to. A ram was provided as an alternative sacrifice. A second angel related to Abraham that it was a test from God which he passed with flying colors. Due to Abraham’s faith in God, his descendants will be a great nation through which all other nations will be blessed.</p>\n\n<p>God himself commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac but He sent two angels to follow through with the other elements of the story. Did Abraham have any doubts when “only” an angel was sent to stop him from sacrificing Isaac? Why didn’t God Himself stop Abraham and, after doing so, why didn’t God inform Abraham his reward? </p>\n\n<p>Note that there are two intertwined questions here. One involving Abraham’s faith only in God but he nevertheless listened to angels. The other being why God commanded Abraham directly but decided to send angels to follow up.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus_Rabbah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Leviticus Rabbah</a> (parsha 1) states that the angel called but the utterance spoke:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>באברהם כתיב ויקרא מלאך ה' אל אברהם המלאך קורא והדבור מדבר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Tzvi_Mecklenburg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg</a> understands this to mean that the angel only called out Abraham's name, but the actual rest of the command to desist was spoken by God Himself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה דעתם כי האמירה היתה מפי הקדוש ברוך הוא והמלאך לא קרא אלא את שם אברהם לעוררו אל שמיעת הדבור שיבא אליו מפי הקב\"ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> in his commentary explains that God had to give the original command to sacrifice Isaac, because had the command been given by an angel Abraham would not have believed it since it contradicted all his previous messages from God. But the command to desist from sacrificing Isaac was believable even from an angel because it realigned with all the previous messages:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הלא דבר הוא שכאן שלח ה' את דברו ביד מלאך בעוד שבכל מקום אחר במשך חיי אברהם ה' בעצמו דיבר עם אברהם אכן כאן כדי לעצור את מילוי הציווי היה די בשליחת מלאך</p>\n<p>דבר זה שהוא יוצא מן הכלל מגלה לנו טפח מהמאבק הפנימי העמוק שאברהם נתנסה בו אילו\nמלאך היה מעמיד בפניו ציווי להקריב את בנו כקרבן לא היה אברהם מאמין לו הלא הסתירה בין ציווי זה לבין הגילויים שגילה לו ה' עד כה הן גילויים באופן כללי והן בנוגע ליצחק בפרט   צועקת עד לב השמים אך לשם חזרה מציווי העקידה היה די בשליחת מלאך לא היה נדרש כל גילוי יוצא מן הכלל כדי להבהיר את הסיבה לחזרה הזאת ולשם הסברת כל ציווי העקידה כנסיון המראה שהיות האדם מוכן לעמוד בנסיון שקולה כעמידה בו חזרה זו התאימה בהתאמה מלאה לכל דבר אחר שאברהם ידע על ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Meir Leibush</a> explains that it was specifically the angel that gave the command to desist because as the Sages say, every fulfillment of a commandment creates an angel. Thus, this was the angel that was created from the fulfillment of God's command which had already been fulfilled without actually slaughtering Isaac. But if Abraham would continue to slaughter Isaac it would turn the entire act into murder and the angel generated from the good deed would lose its existence. Thus, the angel had to jump in and tell Abraham to desist:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה הדבור קח נא את בנך היה ע\"י ה' בעצמו והקריאה אל תשלח היה ע\"י מלאך ולמה לא עכבו ה' בעצמו הנה מלבד מה שיתבאר שהיה נסיון גם בזה  י\"ל עפ\"י מ\"ש חז\"ל שמכל מצוה יולד מלאך שליח ה' לגמלו טוב בעד המצוה ההיא כמ\"ש שכר מצוה מצוה שהמצוה עצמה תגמלהו שכרו  והנה מצוה הגדולה הזאת נגמרה עתה בשלמות בכל פרטיה ונברא ממנה מלאך ה' אבל אם היה אברהם שוחט את יצחק אז היה נחשב כרוצח כי לא היה רצון ה' רק שיעלהו לא שישחטהו  וע\"כ קרא אליו מלאך הזה בעצמו לעכבו מן המעשה שבה תלוי מציאותו וקיומו וע\"כ אמר במד' שהמלאכים בכו כשרצה אברהם לשחוט את יצחק רצו שהמלאכים שנבראו מן המצוה הזאת שהיה בה כמה חלקים הקיחה וההליכה ובנין המזבח ועריכת העצים והעקדה והעליה על המזבח שמכ\"א נברא מלאך וחיות המלאך וקיומו הוא מן המצוה הזאת ואם היה שוחט אותו היו כל המעשים הקודמים הכנה אל רצח ותועבת ה' וע\"כ בכו מלאכים אלה כי יהיו כאין וכאפס  וז\"ש לו כי עתה ידעתי כי ירא אלהים אתה ולא חשכת וכו' ממני שעורו כי עתה ידעתי ממני כי ירא אלהים אתה  שממני ר\"ל מה שנבראתי מן המצוה הזאת ואני חי וקיים ידעתי כי עתה ירא אלהים אתה ולא חשכת את בנך ר\"ל שעתה נגמרה המצוה שהיה תכליתה לידע שאתה ירא אלהים ולא חשכת את בנך וכ\"ז ידעתי עתה והשחיטה היא למותר ויהי' רצח ותועבה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This could perhaps also explain why Abraham believed the angel — when he realized that the angel was already generated he knew that the commandment had already been fulfilled.</p>\n<p>R. Shlomo Sofer records the following incident<sup>1</sup> towards the beginning of Chut Hameshulash (it doesn't seem to be in the earlier edition so there is an image from the 1978 edition below):</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Elijah of Vilna</a> signed the missive against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chasidut</a> his student <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94_%D7%96%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%96%27%D7%99%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Zalman</a> was approached to sign as well. R. Zalman responded by bringing up the question here, namely, how Abraham could heed the command of a mere angel to desist when the command to sacrifice Isaac was from God himself. R. Zalman explained that when it comes to slaughtering someone, only a direct command from God is sufficient to allow it. When it comes to saving someone, however, the directive of an angel suffices. Applying this to the situation at hand, R. Zalman concluded that even though R. Elijah was like an angel, to slaughter someone requires a direct command from God himself, so he was unable to follow his rebbe in this instance. And the story concludes with R. Elijah apparently agreeing to R. Zalman's argument.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GYrZy.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GYrZy.jpg\" alt=\"Image of page of Chut Hameshulash\" /></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

Not only can they be erased, but also transformed into merits. One does not need to actually sin to do this; however, simply transforming the natural emotion of \"love\" of the animal soul is similar to being a Baal-Teshuva in this manner.

This is\n  evidenced by the fact that even after committing sins, in one\n  moment,34 [through teshuvah, all traces of sin can be erased and even\n  a wicked man]35 can become a perfect tzaddik. This advantage which a\n  baal teshuvah possesses — that teshuvah reveals the intensity of his\n  soul’s connection to G‑d — is possessed (albeit in a hidden manner) by\n  a tzaddik.36</p>\n  \n  <p>b) When [a person] turns in teshuvah in a manner that his sins become\n  transformed into merits,37 he gains a new positive potential that\n  tzaddikim do not possess even in a hidden manner. For as is well\n  known,38 the merits [that come about through the transformation of\n  sin] are higher than the merits [achieved by the Divine service of]\n  tzaddikim.39</p>\n  \n  <p>Similar concepts apply with regard to the heights of teshuvah attained\n  by the soul’s descent to the worldly plane. For as is well known,40\n  before the souls’ descent to the worldly plane, they can be considered\n  as perfect tzaddikim, and through the descent into the body, they\n  attain the higher level of baalei teshuvah. Here, too, we find\n  parallels to the two concepts explained above:</p>\n  \n  <p>a) Because the body and the animal soul conceal and veil the light of\n  the soul, the soul’s hidden powers — and even its essential powers\n  which surpass its hidden powers — are aroused.41</p>\n  \n  <p>b) Through the soul’s descent to the worldly plane, it can achieve a\n  new [mode of service], the refinement and perfection of the body, the\n  animal soul, and its portion of the world. Since it is a new [mode of\n  service] (and not merely the revelation of hidden [powers]), it\n  reflects a higher rung than the revelation of the soul’s hidden\n  powers. {Moreover, it is the refinement and perfection of the body\n  which fulfills the intent for the soul’s descent to this worldly plane\n  [through] establishing a dwelling [for G‑d] in the lower realms.}42</p>\n  \n  <p>Since the attainment of this high level (— the new service of refining\n  the body, the animal soul, and one’s portion of the world —) is also\n  achieved by the efforts of the soul, therefore the ascent granted to\n  the soul by virtue of its Divine service on the material plane is also\n  an [entirely] new rung (and not merely the revelation of inner or\n  essential powers which it possesses).</p>\n  \n  <p>This concept is explained in other sources43 with regard to the\n  advantage of the love for G‑d which the G‑dly soul brings about within\n  the animal soul over the love experienced by the G‑dly soul itself.\n  The love of the G‑dly soul allows for a sense of self. Even the love\n  experienced by the soul in which it desires to cling to its root and\n  source although in doing so, it will become void and nothingness,\n  losing all sense of its individual existence,44 [does not represent\n  complete self-transcendence]. For since this is a natural desire, this\n  does not cause [the soul] to nullify its fundamental form. The love\n  [for G‑d] experienced by the animal soul, by contrast, does represent\n  a negation of the animal soul’s fundamental form. For by nature, [the\n  animal soul] is drawn after material things, and the love for G‑d runs\n  contrary to its nature.45 Thus, its experience of a love for G‑d\n  represents complete and utter self-nullification.</p>\n  \n  <p>[Bringing the animal soul to such love has a reciprocatory effect on]\n  the G‑dly soul,46 nullifying its fundamental form, and causing its\n  love to be characterized by self-nullification.47 Instead of the love\n  being motivated by the natural tendencies and characteristics of the\n  lover (i.e., the soul), the love becomes inspired by the object of\n  love (G‑d).</p>\n  \n  <p>Similar concepts apply with regard to the refinement and perfection\n  [achieved by the soul] within its portion of the world. Causing\n  material entities to become vessels for G‑dliness represents a new\n  development, a fundamental change in the nature of the world. [For the\n  nature of the world is to conceal G‑dliness. Indeed, this is alluded\n  to in the Hebrew word which means “world”] עולם which relates to the\n  word העלם, meaning “concealment” or “veiling.”48 This (— that the\n  world becomes a vessel for G‑dliness —) does not come about because of\n  the world’s [natural tendency], but rather is inspired by G‑dliness.\n  Since G‑d’s oneness is totally unlimited, it can also encompass the\n  existence of our [material] world.49</p>\n  \n  <p>Endeavoring to bring about this oneness has a reciprocal effect on the\n  person (who brought about the refinement and perfection within his\n  portion of the world) and enables his Divine service to be\n  characterized by complete bittul: self-nullification that does not\n  stem from his individual identity, but from G‑dliness.50</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"32\">\n  <li><p>See the maamar entitled Vishavti BiShalom, 5738 (Sefer HaMaamarim Meluket, Vol. II, p. 157); Likkutei Sichos, Vol. XV, p. 254ff.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Yeshayahu 59b; note the explanation in Tanya, Iggeres HaTeshuvah, ch. 5.</p></li>\n  <li><p>See Zohar, Vol. I, p. 129ff.

He says that at this level of Teshuva, the person becomes on equal standing pretty much with someone who was already a Tzadik, but not necessarily MORe powerful.  </p>\n\n<p>But besides for just \"erasing\" one's since completely, he also talks about in this Maamer (and many other places) the idea of transforming one's sins into merits, which allows a Baal Teshuva to become even more powerful than a Tzadik, because he not only wipes away the past, but uses it to transform himself into an entirely new entity, and with the power of these new \"merits\" which were transformed from past \"sins\", he gains more power to connect to Hashem than a Tzadik has done through his own regular merits.</p>\n\n<p>So up until then officially answers your question with all of the sources, that yes, sins can not only be completely erased, but even transformed into more powerful merits than would be achievable otherwise. \nTHEN he goes on for the next few paragraphs to explain that this is not only true regarding someone who ACTUALLY sins and then does repentance for his misdeeds, but also in a general way, the difference between a Baal Teshuva and a Tzadik is like the difference between the soul in the physical body, and the soul in heaven before it comes down into the body.</p>\n\n<p>He says that the soul before it comes down into the body is like a Tzadik, it's only connected to G-dly-ness and has nothing to do with the physical world or any kind of animalistic feelings at all.</p>\n\n<p>So just like before there were two levels of \"Teshuva\", so too here than can be two levels of the soul's \"Teshuva\" (returning to Hashem) through coming into the body:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The simple way of Teshuva of the soul, which is simply coming into a physical body which also has an animal soul which (both of them) conceal the G-dly light of the soul initially, and through the soul shining through the body despite the fact that it's being concealed, the souls essence is brought out and felt -- this manner of revealing the soul is like someone who simply erases his sins and becomes like a Tzadik, since he's merely revealing what he already posses in his Soul before it came down into the world, like a Baal Teshuva who merely becomes on the same level as a Tzadik.</li>\n<li>Through coming down into this physical world, not only is the soul able to reveal <em>itself</em> despite the concealments of the body and animal soul (which would be just like regular Teshuva); rather, it can also <strong>transform</strong> the body and animal soul itself (not merely be revealed DESPITE them, rather also transform them themselves), and one's surroundings / \"portion in the world\", and through transforming them into holiness, he the soul attains an even greater level than it  was at before it came down into this world at all.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Then he explains how specifically through making the animal soul love G-d, is one's self-identity completely nullified to Hashem, because even if the G-dly soul  has such a love for G-d that it wants to go out of the body and cling only to G-d (which is talked about in a lot of places in Chassidus and Kabbalah etc. as \"kalos hanefesh, expiring of the soul\"), even that, which is seemingly literally becoming nullified to G-d, isn't a complete way of being nullified to Him, since that is the nature of the G-dly soul: it wants to become close to G-d even if it loses its existence. Whereas the animal soul doesn't want to become nullified to G-d at all, so getting even IT to have a love for G-d that it becomes nullified to Him is the truest way to become nullified to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Then he goes on to explain how the same is true for transforming one's \"portion in the world\" (through doing Mitzos): the world, by definition, is something that conceals G-dliness (the world for \"world\" in Hebrew \"Olam\" is similar to the Hebrew word \"Helem\" -- concealment), so the world by nature wants to conceal G-d. But through, nevertheless, revealing G-d in the world by transforming it through doing Mitzvos, one brings G-dliness into the world despite it's nature, and that is the greatest nullification to Hashem of all, and through THAT the PERSON performing the Mitzvos and transforming the world himself becomes nullified in an even greater way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have a very simple (and funny) proof it never does \"as it never happened\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.86b.3?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yumah 86b</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"אמר ריש לקיש: גדולה תשובה <strong>שזדונות נעשות לו כשגגות</strong><br>\n  שנאמר שובה ישראל עד ה' אלהיך כי כשלת בעונך וכו'...<br>\n  והאמר ריש לקיש <strong>גדולה תשובה שזדונות נעשות לו כזכיות</strong><br>\n  שנאמר ובשוב רשע מרשעתו ועשה משפט וצדקה עליהם יחיה<br>\n  לא קשיא כאן מאהבה כאן מיראה.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we can see from the Gemmorah, the Teshuva either overdoes it and turns sins into merits or underdoes it and can not clean the sin completely.

However, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=7&hilchos=39&perek=12&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Raavad</a> (ibid.) takes issue with Rambam's formulation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם לא רצה לפדותו מצות עשה לעורפו. א\"א בחיי ראשי אין זה מן הפלפול ולא\nמן הדעת המיושבת שיחשוב זה במצות עשה <strong>אע\"פ שאמרו מצות פדייה קודמת\nלמצות עריפה לא שתחשב מצוה אבל היא עבירה ומזיק נקרא</strong> ומפסיד ממונו של\nכהן ומפני שאמר מצות פדייה אמר מצות עריפה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Raavad, one who beheads the donkey has committed a sin, destroyed property and caused a loss to the kohen. Although the Mishnah refers to the \"mitzvah\" of <em>arifah</em>, this is only because it has already referred to the mitzvah of <em>pediyah</em>, but <em>arifah</em> is not a mitzvah at all; it damaging something for no reason and an aveirah.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Raavad's father-in-law, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Isaac_of_Narbonne\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Avraham b. Yitzchak Av Beit Din</a>, held the view of the Rambam and not that of the Raavad. This is clear from his question, cited by the Avudraham, about which mitzvot one recites a blessing on. In his list of mitzvot for which he is unsure whether a blessing is recited, R. Avraham Av Beit Din refers to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ופטר חמור בנתינתו ובעריפתו דתנן (בכורות יג, ב) מצוה פדיה קודמת למצוה\nעריפה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly, he maintains arifah is a mitzvah, but he is unsure whether it receives a blessing.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ibn_Plat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Daniel ha-Bavli (Maaseh Nissim, 3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן מי שהיה לו פטר חמור החוב עליו לפדותו, ואם לא יכול או שאינו שוה לו, אז אסור לו קיומו, אבל מצוה לערפו. והחכמים ז\"ל כבר ביארו בפירוש כי מצות יבום ומצות חליצה שתי מצות: וכן מצות פדיון ומצות עריפה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

So one messenger meets another and says to him before two witnesses: \"let your sender (woman) be Mekudeshet to my sender (man) with this ring\" and voila, <strong>the senders are married, having no idea of to whom (and the fact that they are married at all</strong>, but that's a different question).</p>\n\n<p>How does this work? Why in Judaism is it possible to get married without knowing at all to whom?</p>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I'm aware of the Gemmorah ibid that Rav forbids marrying without seeing first, but that did not become an obligating Halachah.</li>\n<li>I'm aware of the idea of buying a cow without seeing, but as I understand Kinyan Ishut (Kinyan Issur) is (or should be) different (somehow).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>What you're missing in your description (though it's obvious if you read between the lines) is that the messengers were sent by the bride and groom.</p>\n\n<p>One possibility is that the bride/groom said to their messenger \"get me married to X\", in which case bride/groom know who they are planning on marrying.</p>\n\n<p>The other possibility is that the bride/groom said \"get me married to somebody\" in which case they are fully aware that they have no clue they are getting married to.</p>\n\n<p>But back to your question: Kinyan Ishut - becoming husband & wife by proxy.</p>\n\n<p>All that has happened in your scenario is Kidushin which <em>sets aside</em> (is Mekadesh) the bride to the groom. Specifically, the bride can no longer marry anybody else without a Get. (And the groom may have to pay for her food if after 12 months he doesn't marry her.)</p>\n\n<p>No Kinyan Ishut involved.</p>\n\n<p>The actual Kinyan Ishut - marriage - (aka Nisuin) only takes place when the bride and groom meet each other in private.</p>\n\n\n",

The Biah of the Shliach is not just performed by the wrong person, but is the wrong action. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In a lecture at YU's Gruss Kollel (I think <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/893124/rabbi-dr-aaron-rakeffet-rothkoff/rabbi-jacob-moses-lesin-part-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one</a>) R. Aaron Rakeffet described how this question was asked by the high school students in the 1960s, and the answers they were given:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I always tell the story of what happened in YU in the early 60s when the rebbeim were set up by the students. Every rebbe got the same question. We were teaching Masechet Kiddushin, I apologize to the ladies here for this example, but it's a true story.</p>\n<p>So if you've learned Masechet Kiddushin you know you can marry a woman in three different ways: <em>kessef</em>, <em>shtar</em>, <em>biah</em>. Then you have Perek Sheini – that you can marry her, you can send a <em>shliach</em> to marry her. So very innocently, I get the question, and this goes back maybe to '62 '63, I get the question: \"Rebbe, can you send a <em>shliach</em> to be <em>mekadesh</em> a <em>ishah</em> for you <em>al yedei biah</em>?\" You follow the question?</p>\n<p>So I look at the class, <em>baruch Hashem</em> I had seen <em>chiddushei Torah</em> from R. Shurkin of Chaim Berlin a few weeks earlier, and he asked the very question. And he says over from R. Chaim, and this is typical R. Chaim, there are two different types of acquisition – <em>kinyanim</em> – one <em>kinyan</em> is the universal form: the way I buy a field, the way I buy a car, whatever you can sell, there's universal forms of <em>kinyan</em>. Buying an <em>ishah</em> is no different. But relations between a man and wife by definition is <em>ishut</em>, it's not universal. So when can you make a <em>shliach</em>? When it goes with universal concepts. Just like I can make a <em>shliach</em>, Sam, to buy a car for me, to buy a house for me, I can make a <em>shliach</em> to buy a wife for me. But when it comes to <em>dinei ishut</em> no <em>shlichut</em> is possible. And I gave that answer. And that's R. Chaim.</p>\n<p>(My transcription, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(linguistics)#In_English\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fillers</a> removed)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Switching movies in a Movie Theater\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any sources that would constitute the following as gezel/stealing: If you purchase a movie ticket to let’s say Spider-Man and you go to watch Spongebob, and both movie tickets are the same price?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Of course this is stealing!</p>\n\n<h2>לא תחמוד</h2>\n\n<p>Before we even begin: it does not matter whether the theater owner, ticket seller, or anyone else involved is Jewish or not. Stealing is stealing, regardless of the parties’ religions (SA CM 359:1). </p>\n\n<p>We’ll build up to this case by starting with the analogous case of Reuven the grocer. Shimon walks into Reuven’s grocery and lays down $5 on the table to buy a bunch of water bottles. After Reuven takes the money, Shimon leaves the water bottles, grabs a six-pack of soda and starts to walk out of the store. </p>\n\n<p>Reuven calls to Shimon: “Come back here! I didn’t sell you that!”</p>\n\n<p>Shimon shouts back: “I paid you $5 - I should be able to take anything worth $5 from your store.”</p>\n\n<p>The issue at hand is one of intent at the time of the sale. Reuven only agreed to sell Shimon $5 worth of water bottles. It doesn’t matter that the six-pack is worth the same amount; that’s not what the deal was. It doesn’t matter that Shimon first did the deal for water and then for soda. If he forced the sale of the soda directly it would be no different; asking for the water first just helps with the ruse. </p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch CM 359:9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הכופה את חבירו למכור את שלו ונותן לו דמיו אסור אבל אין לו דין גזלן ליפסל מדאורייתא אלא מדרבנן</p>\n  \n  <p>One who forces his friend to sell something of his, and pays him its value - this is forbidden, although the doesn’t have the status of a robber to be disqualified Biblically, only Rabbinically. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch refers to Bava Metzi’a 5b; the Gemara there rules that such a person violates the Biblical prohibition of לא תחמוד, not to covet, but is not disqualified from testimony (Be’er Heitiv, Be’er HaGolah, Sm”a). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>How does this translate to tickets?</h2>\n\n<p>The issue is complicated by the fact that the theater is selling <em>tickets.</em> There’s two ways I see one can interpret this sale: that the theater is selling the ticket, which has the value of granting its holder permission to enter the theater in question, or that the theater is directly selling him the right to enter, with the ticket being a proof of sale. </p>\n\n<p>If the ticket itself is what’s being sold, then this case is comparable to the discussion above. As such, the same way you can’t force someone to sell you soda when they agreed to water, you can’t force someone to sell you tickets to theater 7 when they only agreed to sell you tickets to theater 5. </p>\n\n<p>If they’re selling you the <em>right to enter,</em> then the entire discussion above is moot. If the ticket is a proof of sale, then whatever is on the ticket is what’s binding; since the ticket says that you only bought the right to enter the Spider-Man movie, you have no right to enter the Spongebob movie.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Seating limit</h2>\n\n<p>Another point (h/t DanF) is that there’s a finite number of seats in the theater. Especially on a blockbuster opening weekend, a lot of people may want to see the movie; as the theater will only sell tickets corresponding to the number of seats in the theater, by your switching theaters, you’re stealing that seat from someone who actually paid for it. This point is compounded when you consider theaters that actually sell specific seats, rather than “pick your seat when you enter.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>But DonielF, they probably don’t care!</h2>\n\n<p>One question I hear often, adapted to this situation, is that the seller doesn’t care which theater you enter - so long as they’re not losing money on it. For that matter, they typically don’t make money on the ticket sales anyway - it’s the food where the profit lies. Anyway, when was the last time you saw someone rooting through the aisle making sure that ticket holders have the correct ticket - or even a ticket at all? Even by rated-R movies, where they do often check, it’s more for lawsuits than actual sales, right?</p>\n\n<p>The smarter ones even go so far as to quote §1 of the above-quoted chapter in Shulchan Aruch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם הוא דבר דליכא מאן דקפיד ביה שרי כגון ליטול מהחבילה או מהגדר לחצוץ בו שיניו ואף זה אוסר בירושלמי ממדת חסידות:</p>\n  \n  <p>And if it’s something that nobody is particular regarding it, it’s permitted, such as taking a straw from a haystack or fence to pick one’s teeth with it. But even this is forbidden by the Yerushalmi as a pious act. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See? One shouldn’t do it, sure, but it’s technically permitted. </p>\n\n<p>Yeah...no. </p>\n\n<p>You can’t just go putting thoughts in people’s heads to justify a Biblical prohibition. The fact that they don’t do anything about it doesn’t mean that they don’t care. The guy at the concessions stand? Yeah, he gets paid $3 an hour and just doesn’t want to do more than his job. </p>\n\n<p>But the theater manager? He would care if he knew people were abusing his ticket counter. First it’s going to the wrong movie, then it’s going to three movies instead of the one you paid for, then it’s sneaking in the back door and not paying at all. Is it a likely scenario that it would devolve so far? Maybe not - but as the manager of the place, he has to be concerned that movie producers will stop showing movies at his theaters because they are losing money. So why doesn’t he put in security and ticket scanners? Maybe he wants to enhance the customer experience or whatever - nothing to do with “he doesn’t care.”</p>\n\n<p>Which thought process is more likely - not caring, or absolutely caring and just doesn’t want to do anything about it? Hard to say, but that’s the point - unless you know for certain what they’re thinking, or at least what’s generally done, you can’t just go assuming because you bought the wrong movie. Own up and go to the front desk and ask for an exchange. </p>\n\n<p>And again: even if this Shulchan Aruch applies, he does qualify it with a “it shouldn’t be done, even if it’s technically okay.”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>But what if you <em>do</em> know?</h2>\n\n<p>And here we come to the theater’s fine print. </p>\n\n<p>All this assumes that there’s no qualifying factors. But if you know what the theater’s policy is on the topic, then that’s what you follow, ignoring everything else I’ve said in this post. </p>\n\n\n",

Did he get the 2nd set of tablets at this point, or later? Did he receive any of the Oral law or Written Torah at this point?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Third set of 40 days and nights</strong>: How long after the previous set did he wait before going back up, or did he just stay up there for 80 consecutive days and nights? What did he get exactly at the end of them, is it at this point that he received the second set of tablets, and what part of the Oral Law (if any) did he receive at this point?</p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to clarify the narritive</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The three sets of 40 days were one after the other starting on/about 6/7 Sivan right after God spoke to the Jews on Sinai.</p>\n<p>After the first 40 days--when Moshe came down and smashed the first tablets--the next day he went up for 40 days.

Is this a translation issue?</p>\n\n<p><em>Source: Judaica Press (Chabad.org)</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The literal translation would seem to be as you suggest. Here it is in the original Hebrew, with my translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גִּילִ֨י מְאֹ֜ד בַּת־צִיּ֗וֹן הָרִ֙יעִי֙ בַּ֣ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֔ם הִנֵּ֤ה מַלְכֵּךְ֙ יָ֣בוֹא לָ֔ךְ צַדִּ֥יק וְנוֹשָׁ֖ע ה֑וּא עָנִי֙ וְרֹכֵ֣ב עַל־חֲמ֔וֹר וְעַל־עַ֖יִר בֶּן־אֲתֹנֽוֹת׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, your king will come to you, a righteous man and a savior. A poor man, and one who rides on a donkey, and on a foal, son of she-donkeys. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the Malbim doesn’t ask your question, his explanation of the passuk indirectly addresses it. He interprets various attributes in the verse as indicating that Mashiach will be “reversing” their usage; for instance, a savior appointed by the king is usually bedecked in the finest outfit, yet Ben David is described as a “poor man.” Regarding the final stitch of the verse he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ורוכב על חמור הפך רוכב על סוס מוכן ליום מלחמה, וגם אם ירכב על עיר שהוא צעיר לימים שזה כבוד יותר, (כמ\"ש רוכבים על שלשים עירים שופטים י' ד'), לא יהיה עיר בן סוס רק עיר בן אתונות:</p>\n  \n  <p>“And riding on a donkey” - he reverses riding on a horse, which is designated for the day of war; and also, if he is “riding on a foal” which is young in days, which is a greater honor (as we see in Judges 10:4), it will not be the foal of a horse, but rather the foal of she-donkeys. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By explaining the passuk in this manner, he necessarily translates the ו in ועיר not as “and” but as “or”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A poor man, and one who rides on a donkey, <strong>or</strong> a foal, son of she-donkeys. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Radak explains much less Midrashically that the passuk is just stylistically repeating itself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועל עיר בן אתונות. כפל הענין במילות שונות ועוד זכר עיר שהוא קטן בשנים כי הוא הנבחר לרכוב וכן אמר על בני אבצן רוכבים על שלשים עירים: </p>\n  \n  <p>“And on a foal, son of she-donkeys.” The idea is duplicated in different words; and further, [it uses] a male foal, which is small in years, for it is the most treasured on which to ride. And so does it say regarding the children of Ivzan [also in the book of Judges], “riding on thirty foals.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He therefore would translate the verse as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A poor man, and one who rides a donkey <strong>which is</strong> a foal, son of she-donkeys. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am unaware of another usage of a conjunctive ו being used in this manner; if someone knows of one, please ping me. </p>\n\n<p>While your translation seems to be the common one (I see that, for instance, JTS, quotes by Sefaria, uses the conjunction “and” as well), I do not see any commentators that defend this translation. Once again, if anyone finds one, please ping me. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are there angels?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that the translation of the Hebrew word מלאך means \"messenger\" and an angel is \"G-d's messenger.\"</p>\n\n<p>We see angels mentioned in various roles. Frequently, angels appear in dreams. Sometimes, they are assigned tasks such as the three angels that appeared before Avraham.</p>\n\n<p>If G-d is present everywhere, and he is able to do everything, even doing many things simultaneously (\"multitasking\"), then, why does G-d need to send angels or messengers? Why doesn't G-d just do the job, himself?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In the דרך לחיים edition of דרך השם, at the very end of חלק א, there is a footnote (#12) in which R' Chaim Friedlander addresses this question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בודאי הקב\"ה אינו צריך את המלאכים כדי להוציא לפועל את הנהגתו והשפעותיו, והיו באמת מקרים שהקב\"ה הנהיג בעצמו בלי אמצעי שנקרא מלאך, כמו שאנו אומרים בהגש\"פ \"אני ולא מלאך... אני ה' ולא אחר\" אלא \"שכן רצה וסידר\" שיהיו חוקים \"שתהיינה גזרותיו יוצאות למעשה על ידי מלאכיו\" וזאת משום שהקב\"ה רוצה שנדע את הסיבות איך הדברים יוצאים לפועל כמו שבחוקי הטבע יש כללים שלולא היינו יודעים אותם לא היינו יודעים איך להשתמש בדרכי הטבע, כך הוא גם בחוקים של הרוחניות שבלי לדעת אותם לא היינו יכולים להפעיל אותם, כגון: שמצוה זו מפעילה מלאכים מסוימים להשיג תוצאה פלונית, כי הקב\"ה מנהיג את הועלם לפי הבנתנו ומעשינו, וזה מה שאמרו חז\"ל (אבות ה:א) \"בעשרה מאמרות נברא העולם... והלא במאמר אחד יכול להבראות\" עשרה המאמרות הם עשרה שלבים והשתלשלות, שאז אפשר להבין סיבה ומסובב, ואם היה נברא במאמר אחד לא היינו מבינים כלום בהשתלשלות הבריאה וסיבותיה. \"אלא להפרע מן הרשעים... וליתן שכר טוב לצדיקים\" כי הצדיקים מכח העשרה מאמרות מבינים דרכי שמים ופועלים על פיהם ועל כך מקבלים שכר, ואילו הרשעים שיכולים להתבונן ולהבין, ואינם רוצים ללמוד ולעשות את רצון הבורא, ועל כך יענשו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paraphrased, R' Friedlander essentially says of course Hashem does not need angels, and sometimes He does act without them. But just as Hashem made the physical world with a multitude of laws, in a way that we can understand, so that we should be able to appreciate how they worked and to utilize them, so too Hashem made Spritual \"laws\" in such a way that they are in an orderly system that we can understand and relate to. There are therefore Spiritual rules of \"cause and effect\" so that we can appreciate how, say, a given Mitzvah instigates certain angels to effect a given result. By our being able to appreciate how our Mitzvos affect the world, our performing them becomes that much deeper. Angels represent that relationship of things being carried out, and there being cause and effect, which enable us to understand the spiritual structure of creation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The answer is that G-d created the universe <em>for our benefit</em> not His.  Malachim - messengers parallel a king and his ministers, servants etc.  The King Himself doesn't deal with day-to-day tasks because it is beneath him.  When we understand that idea, then we also understand that when G-d Himself deals with, and is directly involved with the world, it is for the Jewish people - His beloved (Shir HaShirim).  With that in mind, we can perhaps understand that malachim simply express our relationship to the King of Kings.  Sometimes <em>we</em> relate to Him directly, and sometimes through His servants. When we do Mitzvos, learn Torah and behave correctly, we interact with G-d on a level that is, to some degree direct. On the other hand, the nations of the world, and when we're not zoeche (have the right merit), we relate to G-d <em>indirectly</em> and hence, we relate to Him via His servants -  the malachim.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramchal, in Derech Hashem (I 5:3) explains in a far more detailed manner that Melachim are there to sustain and serve physical things so that they may serve and direct themselves to the Will of G-d. </p>\n\n<p>In this respect then, since G-d's overarching presence is limited to some degree (we would simply not exist otherwise - being totally absorbed by the Oneness of the Creator), in order for us to relate to that, Hashem created spiritual beings that help us relate to the spiritual world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While this does not answer why but hints on consistency through the creation:</p>\n\n<p>If we put all the entities in the creation on a \"spirituality axis\" we could spot a pattern of different proportions between the material and the spiritual.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TxsqM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TxsqM.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So angels seem to fit the picture perfectly, filling a place between us and some \"pure spirituality\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>PS: I was hesitating a lot about placing \"humans\" and \"Jews\" and the 50/50 breakpoint. It is not final, just a proposal.</em></p>\n\n\n",

The questioner had always worn tefillin on Chol Hamoed, but then he got married and the only synagogue around was one in which tefillin was not worn on Chol Hamoed. In the first part of the responsum R. Berlin states that the questioner must continue to wear tefillin on Chol Hamoed. </p>\n\n<p>In the second part, though, he references a previous correspondence in which he had said that it would be better to recite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shema</a> and pray <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shacharit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shacharit</a> alone at home. The questioner had apparently questioned this, suggesting that maybe he should just put on tefillin at home without praying Shacharit, and perhaps even without reciting Shema, and then pray with the congregation without tefillin. </p>\n\n<p>R. Berlin rejected this suggestion because the whole point of wearing the tefillin on Chol Hamoed even though he is now in a place where no one does is to continue his lifelong custom of doing such. If we're looking at lifelong customs, it was surely always his custom to pray Shacharit with tefillin, such that from the day of his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_and_Bat_Mitzvah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bar Mitzvah</a> he would have never prayed without tefillin.  Praying with a congregation, however, was certainly not a lifelong custom; indeed, praying alone is a standard practice, and the person had certainly prayed alone many a time.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if the goal is to continue the customs that had been operative his whole life, it would be better to pray with tefillin without a congregation than to pray without tefillin with a congregation.</p>\n\n<h2>Shu\"t Nishmat Chaim</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Benei Brak 2002 edition — Siman 60<br> Jerusalem 2008 edition — 1:15</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואשר הכרעתי במכתבי הראשון במי שמעולם הי' מניח תפילין במועד ועתה קבע מקום תפלתו בבהכנ\"ס שאין מניחין ואין לו בעירו בהכנ\"ס אחר המניחין מוטב לו להתפלל ק\"ש ותפלת שחרית בביתו ביחידות וע\"ז דן כבודו הרי מוטב לו להניח תפילין בביתו ולקרות בהן ק\"ש בלבד או גם בלא ק\"ש ולהתפלל בצבור בלא תפילין הוא פשוט דהרי כל עיקר מה שאנו דנים עליו הוא שלא ישנה מנהגו מכפי שנהג מעולם והרי להתפלל בלא תפילין לא נהג מעולם מיום שהתחיל להניח תפלין ביום שנעשה בר מצוה מיום ההוא והלאה לא התפלל תפלת שחרית בלא תפילין אפי' פעם אחת משא\"כ להתפלל ביחידות הוא מנהג פשוט ובלי ספק כבר התפלל ביחידות כמה פעמים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From here we can derive that there is certainly a value in specifically praying with tefillin, as that is customary, but it is surely not a formal law that one must pray with tefillin. </p>\n\n\n",

These siblings are not Jewish, but if one was raised with these siblings and viewed them as family, do the rules of Bishul Aqum apply to these siblings and make it forbidden to eat food cooked by them since there seems to be no risk of intermarriage? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all Bishul Akum Food cooked by a gentile applies even if there is no worry of intermarriage Rema Yore Dea 112,1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אסרו חכמים לאכול פת של עובדי כוכבים, משום חתנות. (<strong>ואפילו במקום דליכא משום חתנות</strong>, אסור) (רשב\"א סימן רמ\"ח)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Secondly, since a Gentile according to Halacha is allowed to marry a sibling who shares a common father but not a common mother there is concern of marriage in this situation.\n Rambam Hilchot Melachim 9,5 says:<br>\nשש עריות אסורות על בני נח:\nהאם ואשת האב ואשת איש ואחותו מאמו וזכור ובהמה<br>\nThis means his sister from his father might want to marry him as they are not related according to Halacha of bnei Noach (it might not bother her that he is forbidden to her because he's Jewish and shes not) and if she converts they would be able to marry each other as stated in Shulchan Aruch 269,3 (though a convert cannot marry a sister from the mother). Indeed Tamar wanted to marry Amnon her brother through her father Shmuel 2 13,13 she was conceived when her mother was not Jewish yet (see Sanhedrin 21a from here we learn that Yichud is prohibitted)</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly in this situation, this sister probably hangs out with gentile friends so even if she personally feels repulsed to marry him he can still frequent her friends/relatives at meals which she cooks.</p>\n\n\n",

Please help me find one - where did it start?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I commend your question in explicitly stating your assumptions, such that the question follows.</p>\n\n<p>One of your assumptions is that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the default state is that all women (married and not, young and not) are obligated to cover their hair (as שער באשה ערוה - Brochos 24a, ...)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The ellipses are my own; because I only wish to discuss the gemara in Berachot, rather than the Shulchan Aruch's understanding of a different gemara.) The question is whether the words באשה in the gemara you mentioned refers to all women, married or not, and young or not. </p>\n\n<p>It is not obvious because the word אשה in Hebrew <strong>sometimes</strong> refers to a woman, and sometimes it refers to a wife (an אשת איש). <strong>If</strong> in this gemara it refers specifically to a married woman, then this particular assumption upon which your question rests does not hold.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at Rashi in the context of <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%93_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this gemara</a>, he writes about shok be'isha erva:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שוק - באשת איש:\n  ערוה - להסתכל וכן באשתו לק\"ש:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes that it applies to a married woman specifically. It stands to reason that this definition of specifically eshet ish also applies for the next statement in the gemara as well. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of your assumption on the second source, that Ketubot 72 (which you should cite rather than Shulchan Aruch's interpretation of it), which speaks to bnot Yisrael, it is a question of balancing ambiguous sources. The context of the gemara in Ketubot speaks of women leaving marriage without their ketubah, so is explicitly married women. The Tanna deVei Rabbi Yishmael finds (as the other answer notes) this warning to women from the context of Sotah, so even though employs the term bnot Yisrael, the context might mean Jewish daughters in the sense of <em>married</em> Jewish daughters. It does not explicitly say non-married Jewish daughters.</p>\n\n<p>Then, as the Chelkas Mekokek points out, there are other sources such as an explicit Mishna in the second perek of Ketubot that יוצאה בהינומא וראשה פרועה is evidence that she was a virgin. As a result, this idea that unmarried women must cover is only to non-virgins. That is one way of harmonizing and balancing the competing and ultimately ambiguous sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I believe your understanding of שער באשה ערווה is incorrect. That gemarra is discussing a man's obligation to avoid reciting words of Torah when uncovered hair is in his sight. It creates no obligation for a woman to cover her hair. For example, let's say a married couple are alone in a place where she is allowed to have her hair uncovered. Is her hair erva? Yes. Can he recite shema while looking at her? No. Must she cover it? It is after all, erva. The answer is still no.</p>\n\n<p>What is the source for a woman to cover her hair? From the Sotah ritual. That's describing a <strong>married woman</strong>. The default position is no one has to cover their hair. Why would the opposite be true? The Torah teaches us that a married woman must cover her hair. If the Torah doesn't speak about an unmarried woman, we're still at the default understanding. The burden of proof is on the one who says otherwise. This is why no one discusses the \"source\", as there is none.</p>\n\n\n",

Why don’t we extend this principle to here, and one should potentially fulfill the mitzvah after sunset, against the potential prohibition of wearing them at night?

The modern edition that I used simply took the second seif from siman 602 and made it its own siman using the number 603. The total number of seifim was not affected by this.</p>\n\n<p>In Yoreh Deiah there were two places where the siman numbers are corrupted. In the original Venice 1565 edition, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45234&st=&pgnum=89\" rel=\"noreferrer\">169 was skipped</a>. In the modern edition that I used they simply labeled that siman as 168/169 with 27 seifim. In the original edition <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45234&st=&pgnum=192\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the number 296 was used twice</a> (in the modern edition I used it was 297 that was used twice) so they appear as two separate simanim.</p>\n\n<p>There were also (at least) two simanim that had the wrong amount of seifim listed in the title. Siman 234 lists 72 seifim in the title but actually has 74 seifim (both in the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6662\" rel=\"noreferrer\">modern edition</a> I used as well as in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45234&st=&pgnum=141\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the original Venice 1565 edition</a>.)

The <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6918\" rel=\"noreferrer\">modern edition</a> corrected the title to list 39 seifim.</p>\n\n<p>In Even HaEzer there were two sections with no siman numbers. Seder HaGet and Seder Chalitza were counted as their own simanim, with 101 and 57 seifim respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the numbers provided by Josh Friedlander in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/97264/13438\">his answer</a> from Wikisource and Sefaria, I checked every discrepancy against the original Venice 1565 edition. In every instance except one, the Tzuras Hadaf edition that I used had the same number of seifim as the original edition; the Wikisource differed from the original edition in two places; and Sefaria differed from the original in 5 places:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In O.C. 106 <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45227&st=&pgnum=42\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the original edition</a> has 3 seifim while <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Wikisource</a>\nhas 2 (it incorporates seif 2 into seif 1).</p></li>\n<li><p>In O.C. 219 <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45227&st=&pgnum=86\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the original edition</a> has 9 seifim while <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1049\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tzuras Hadaf</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.219?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria</a> have 10 seifim (both of them break off the last bit of the last seif into a new seif, yet they both only list 9 seifim).</p></li>\n<li><p>In O.C. 601 and 602 <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45227&st=&pgnum=245&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the original edition</a> had 2 seifim in each. However, the original edition skipped the number 603 for the next siman (i.e the siman after 602 is 604) so other versions tried to compensate to keep the numbers accurate. The Tzuras Hadaf edition and <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Wikisource</a> simply separated the second seif from 602 and called it siman 603, thus the total number of seifim is unchanged. Sefaria also split off that seif into a siman 603, but for some reason it has the first seif of 602 twice in siman 602, so the total number of seifim becomes off by 1. </p></li>\n<li><p>In Y.D. 32 <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45234&st=&pgnum=16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the original edition</a> has 7 seifim while <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%9C%D7%91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Wikisource</a> has 8 seifim (it splits off the last bit of seif 7 into a new seif).</p></li>\n<li><p>In C.M. 41 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.41?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria</a> duplicates the last seif, so it has 5 seifim instead of 4.</p></li>\n<li><p>In C.M. 74 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.74?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria</a> duplicates the last seif, so it has 8 seifim instead of 7.</p></li>\n<li><p>In C.M. 76 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.76?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria</a> duplicates the last seif, so it has 4 seifim instead of 3.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Limitations</h2>\n\n<p>My data is based on the siman titles in the Tzuras Hadaf edition. If there are any mistakes in the siman titles regarding the number of seifim in the siman then my data for that siman will be mistaken. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it is possible that I may have made data entry errors, in which case some of the numbers might be incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>However, as per above, I corrected errors by consulting the original edition in any case of discrepancy. So unless there was a case where the Tzuras Hadaf edition, the Wikisource, and Sefaria all differed from the original edition in the same siman with the exact same difference, any errors were presumably caught.</p>\n\n<h2>Data</h2>\n\n<p>Here is the data that I entered into the Excel sheet.

(There is a similar  M.Y. question about needing to make a bracha when entering a coffee shop.)</p>\n\n<p>However, if one intentionally smells a bar of soap to enjoy its fragrance, what bracha should he make? Body soap has a combination of some natural products - sometimes aloe (a \"fruit\" plant - normally would have the bracha for smelling fruits); could be honey, might be oatmeal, wheat germ, and mostly it has chemical fragrances (is there any bracha ever made on synthetic fragrances?)</p>\n\n<p>In short, what bracha should you make on bar soap?</p>\n\n\n",

The two points from that answer that are relevant to this question are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As per SA CM 359:1, if it is a stealing issue, it does not matter whether the parties involved are Jewish or not - stealing is always prohibited.</li>\n<li>Forcing someone into a sale they didn’t willingly agree to is prohibited by Lo Sachmod (Ibid. §9, from BM 5a).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since the website (or store, for that matter - no reason to limit the question to websites) requires that their customers be over 18, if one tricks them into selling something to an underage client, they are in violation of Lo Sachmod.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Lying and Geneivas Da’as</h2>\n<p>Your question was about whether this is stealing or not, so technically the answer stops here.

There is a well-known book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judith\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judith in the Apocrypha</a>, which provides details on the story. Usage of the story in the Chanukkah context and other details, such as Yehudis was a daughter of a <em>Kohein Gadol</em> rather than a widow might have been done by mistake, and the story needs to be taken as a midrash / parable.</p>\n<p>The story of Chanukkah according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2nd book of Maccabees</a> states that the <em>Beis haMikdash</em> was overseen by an evil <em>Kohein Gadol</em> Chonioh who changed his name to Menelaus. He was a representative of the hellenist Jews the enemies of <em>Hashmonaim</em>. Menelaus could not have a daughter who frightened the Greek soldiers, simply because Menelaus himself would be killed as a result.</p>\n<p>Finally, as R. Lawrence Schiffman explains, the story of Channukah did not end well. After Yehudah the Maccabi rededicated the <em>Beis haMikdash</em>, he and his followers were defeated again by the Seleucids. Yehudah and his followers were displaced into the wilderness wandering until 162 BCE when the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes had already been dead. By that time Yehudah was killed and the forces were led by Yonathan his brother. Meanwhile, in Syria there were two brothers fighting to become the king of Helenist Syria and they turned to Yonathan for support with his 10,000 soldiers. In return Yonathan was promised to become a ruler of the independent land of Yehudah. Yonathan supported one of them, Demetrius I Soter, to become a king, who in turn appointed him as a <em>Kohein Gadol</em> and ruler over the Yehudah. That is the end of the Chanukkah story and it does not create any possibility for the story of Yehudis to take place.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, the real history, as Hashem develops it, is the main miracle after all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Your question falls under the general question of \"<strong>why the Sages differ in their views and opinions</strong>?\".

As our Sages said [in explaining the sin\n  of the Golden Calf: “This may be compared to a man who had a son. He\n  had him bathed and anointed, he fed him and gave him to drink, he hung\n  a purse around his neck and he put him at the door of a brothel.] What\n  can that son do in order not to sin?” (Berachot 32a).  </p>\n  \n  <p>In such a\n  situation, a person is considered to be completely coerced, in which\n  case the Compassionate One absolves a person.   And so too when a\n  person’s [evil] inclination tempts him with incredible, overwhelming\n  force, that is a situation of coercion. If Hashem compels his heart,\n  his sin was no sin whatsoever. Rather, it was God’s will. </p>\n  \n  <p>See\n  Ketubot 51b describing a case of a [married] woman who is being raped:\n  “Even if, at the end, she cries out that should the rapist stop, she\n  would pay him [to continue, she is not considered to be an adulterer,\n  and] she is permitted to return to her husband. Why? Because her\n  [evil] inclination enveloped her.” Thus, we see that this is\n  considered total coercion although [in the end] she was willing.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, when a person’s [evil] inclination is so great that he cannot\n  overcome it, he is [considered to be] under complete coercion. In that\n  case, there is no punishment for [what he has done], even if he\n  performed a prohibited act, because he was coerced.   However, the\n  person himself cannot testify about himself that this is indeed the\n  case, because it is possible that he still had the ability to overcome\n  his [evil] inclination (as I heard [from the Ishbitzer Rebbe]\n  regarding Zimri, who erred in this matter [when he engaged in\n  relations with a Moabite princess]).</p>\n  \n  <p><em>(trad. <a href=\"http://www.dotletterword.com/new-translations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yaacov David Shulman</a>)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am confused. </p>\n\n<p>I have several questions, of which the last two are most important to me right now:</p>\n\n<p>1) Is R' Tzadok making a determination that one under the overwhelming influence of the yetzer hara is halachically a shoteh in this instance? If not, what is the practical difference between that and what he is saying?</p>\n\n<p>2) How can the conclusions of this text (such as \"his sin was no sin whatsoever. Rather, it was G-d's will\") be reconciled with \"Hakol b'yedei Shamayim chutz miyirat Shamayim\"?</p>\n\n<p>3) Why was Zimri at fault, if the guy at the door to the brothel and the women being raped are totally innocent? (It sounds like the temptation was more or less the same for all of them.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>4) \"The person himself cannot testify about himself that this is indeed the case [that he could not stop himself from sinning].\" Does this mean that one can never and may never self-assess that one is under coercion [and consequently do some act]?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>5) How/why could such a situation of true impossibility ever be, if the reason that we and the yetzer hara exist is so that we can overcome it? \nWhat spiritual purpose would be served for G-d (kavyakhol) by creating occasions of an \"impossible-to-resist\" yetzer hara?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>1.) Yes. Similarly see Talmud Sotah 3a: \"No one sins unless a spirit of insanity enters them.\"</p>\n\n<p>2.) Your level of Yiras Shomayim is subject to how much you work on it. It is also not limited by heaven; whereas your physical height or your IQ etc. are given by Hashem at birth etc.</p>\n\n<p>However, Hashem, for whatever reason He sees fit, could override your current level of fear of sin by coercing you anyway. This doesn't change your level, but temporarily overrides it.</p>\n\n<p>3) and 4) are tied together. :</p>\n\n<p>If I make a vow to go on a special diet for 2 months so I can lose 20 pounds, then I may not sin by breaking my vow.</p>\n\n<p>However, Hashgachah Pratis!! I happened to be driving my car past my favorite bakery and in the window was my favorite Napoleans and Eclaire pastries! </p>\n\n<p>My Yetzer Hara was talking to me....</p>\n\n<p>Hashgachah Pratis!!! There is usually never a parking space right in front of this busy bakery! Suddenly, the clouds parted, the rain stopped, the sun shined through... and there before my eyes was an empty parking spot in front of the bakery calling to me.</p>\n\n<p>I parked and bought the cakes because I couldn't help myself. I am not at fault, for my Father put a credit card around my neck and placed me in free parking by the door to the bakery.</p>\n\n<p>I know it was orchestrated by Hashem Himself as a true miracle (proving my coercion) because I had circled the bakery 10 times for over a half hour first; and according to Teva (nature) it was impossible to find an empty space! So it must have been a miracle....</p>\n\n<p><strong>SO</strong> If a person suddenly finds themselves faced by a challenge (like the boy delivered to the door of  the brothel, or the woman one moment after being raped etc.) then they might be under such strong feelings, that it is called coercion.</p>\n\n<p>If however, you circle the bakery ten times, when your inclination was not overwhelming yet, and then park and put yourself in front of the window, <strong>then that's not coercion from heaven. That's the person coercing themselves.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Zimri was not in the midst of war and suddenly faced with Kozbi in the bedroom of an abandoned enemy base camp. He was hearing reports of the Midianite women seducing a few men. Then he heard they were beautiful and willing...then he investigated, then he started working on legal arguments, then he met Kozbi etc.</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere along the line, he was given the chance to listen to the good side before things got out of hand.</p>\n\n<p>you also cannot say he was coerced at the moment he sinned, because at that point he already convinced himself he was legally entitled to do it.</p>\n\n<p>As to a person trying to claim they know when they are coerced so let them just give in? No that would be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>It is an example of a catch-22. If you are feeling emotionally forced to sin, to the extent of insanity, then you will probably sin; and do so without sitting and making reasoned decisions about it.</p>\n\n<p>If you are under your own control enough to sit and talk to yourself about how you must be feeling pretty coerced about doing this sin, then you are not fully insane at that point. You still have access to reason. So, you cannot honestly declare yourself to be insane and hence issue a permission to yourself. </p>\n\n<p>It would be like a man thinking about the kind of woman that would absolutely overwhelm his desires. Once he has \"her\" in mind, he says: If I met her, I wouldn't be able to control myself...therefore, its a sin that has no punishment or liability since I cannot overcome it. So...for me its allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Then based on that premise, he makes a few phone calls to local brothels, asking if such a woman exists in their employ? Low and behold, there is such a woman. He runs down there (being coerced :) ) and finds her, declaring that he is about to do something which is totally allowed due to Heaven having coerced him.</p>\n\n<p>Nope, it is not considered coercion, since he built the whole inclination himself!</p>\n\n<p>5) There could be many reasons why Hashem would bring someone to fall into a sin. </p>\n\n<p>One example is given in Talmud Sanhedrin, 107a regarding David and Bathsheva.</p>\n\n<p>King David asked Hashem why people don't pray with his (David's) name, like they do with Abraham, Issac, and jacob?</p>\n\n<p>Hashem answered that they were tested but you were not.</p>\n\n<p>David asked: \"Test me!\"</p>\n\n<p>Hashem tested him with the sin of a married woman, and David did not overcome it. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we need to experience something to learn the lesson in life. Hashem telling us is just not good enough for some of us. We have to taste it for ourselves. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, if we are too smug or arrogant in our assessment of our own character, Hashem puts us into a situation that reminds us we can sin. So, we should never ask to be tested. But if we do judge others or assume we can pass a test, then failing the test helps us to be humble afterwards; and to learn that overcoming a particular sin takes more than just immature confidence.</p>\n\n\n",

He named him Binyamin, similar to בן ימים the son of my days, i.e. my old age.

This was standardized in 1984.  Before that, some states had lower minimum ages. In most (but not all states) the law is about purchasing alcohol, not consuming it.  And there are always religious exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>It is indeed illegal in civil law to ask an adult to buy alcohol for you if you are not allowed.  But that's not absolute.  If you go up to an adult in a parking lot and ask them to go inside the store and buy for you, you can both be arrested.  But if you're planning an event where alcohol will be served, you can ask someone overage to take over the task of buying it (but you usually can't be with them when they buy it, unless it's your parent and they don't say it's for you).</p>\n\n<p>In addition to breaking civil law, I'd say there would be religious prohibitions on getting someone else in trouble with authorities.  Police routinely assign officers who are over 18 and under 21 to pose as ordinary citizens and ask random strangers to buy alcohol for them, then arrest them if they do it.  Ditto for store staff who forget (or \"forget\") to ask for ID or who pretend not to recognize an obviously fake ID.  So there is a strong risk of harming the person who tries to help you if you ask them to do this illegal act.</p>\n\n<p>(Going back and forth about making this an answer vs a comment as I am not quoting halachot or religious opinions.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>That would fall into Dina dimalchusa dina, but generally a law that is in place but it is common knowledge that it is not followed and everyone breaks it, is not assur.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As a matter of secular law your premise is incorrect. In the U.S. alone laws regarding minor alcohol consumption are extremely varied. In Wisconsin, a parent can legally buy their child a drink in a bar; in Pennsylvania it is illegal to serve your own child alcohol in your own home. There are many states in the middle.</p>\n<p>In terms of halakhah, I would think dina d'malchuta dina would track whatever the local law is. If it's illegal to buy alcohol for the minor, then it's also asur and asking the adult to do it seems like lifnei iver (placing a stumbling block) and/or mesayeah (aiding and abetting) the Torah violation. If it's legal, then why would it be asur to ask them to do something legal for you?</p>\n<p>The scope of dina d'malchuta seems beyond this question. But two points seem very relevant. (1) There are opinions that dina d'malchuta depends on enforcement. Shut Michat Asher 2:123. But the premise that underage drinking laws are not enforced seems dubious. I think there would be a distinction between laws that are not enforced and laws that are enforced but cannot be enforced in all cases or do not catch all violators. (2) While there are opinions that dina d'malchuta only applies to tax laws or other narrow categories of law, see Beit Yosef to Choshen Mishpat 369, most poskim hold that it applies to laws for the general betterment of society and prevention of mischief. See Rema 369:11; Igrot Moshe Choseh Mishpat 2:62; Aseh L'kha Rav 2:68.</p>\n\n\n",

I think it's well supported with sources, but I haven't seen anyone explicitly link them together in this way.</p>\n<p>My starting point is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_I_Chronicles.1.38.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> at the beginning of Divrei Hayamim, who counts 70 groups from Avraham's family (counting the families from Seir Hachori, who merged with Eisav's family) to correspond to the 70 nations from Noach and the 70 descendants, later families, from Yaakov.  In each case, the 70 people who started each nation or family are listed in the Torah.</p>\n<p>In each case, the 70 people listed are the start of a new reality: the nations of the world, the descendants of Avraham and the beginning of monotheism, and the Jewish people.  While I can't give a specific lesson to be learned from each of the names, I suggest that they are listed to stress the importance of the new world that those people started.</p>\n<p>There is another group of 70 people mentioned in the Torah, but not listed explicitly: the 70 zekeinim who formed the first Beis Din.  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas</a> in Rosh Hashanah explains why their names aren't listed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לו, אם באין אנו לדון אחר בית דינו של רבן גמליאל, צריכין אנו לדון אחר כל בית דין ובית דין שעמד מימות משה ועד עכשיו, שנאמר (שמות כד), ויעל משה ואהרן נדב ואביהוא ושבעים מזקני ישראל. ולמה לא נתפרשו שמותן של זקנים, אלא ללמד, שכל שלשה ושלשה שעמדו בית דין על ישראל, הרי הוא כבית דינו של משה. ‏</p>\n<p>[Rabbi Dosa] said to [Rabbi Yehoshua]: \"If we're going to question Rabban Gamliel's Beis Din, we also have to question every Beis Din from Moshe's time until now.  'And Moshe, Aharon, Nadav, Avihu, and 70 zekeinim went up [to Har Sinai]' - why aren't the zekeinim's names listed?  To teach us that any three who form a Beis Din for the Jews are like Moshe's Beis Din\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the names had been listed, that would indicate that these 70 zekeinim started a new nation within the Jewish people, just like Avraham started a new nation within the world and Yaakov started one within Avraham's descendants.  But because the Torah chose <em>not</em> to tell us their names, they were not qualitatively different than anyone else - and any three Jewish men who form a qualified Beis Din have the same authority as they did.</p>\n<p>(See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.9?p2=Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.9.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.9?p2=Yachin_on_Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.50.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiferes Yisrael</a> on that Mishnah, among others, who explain it differently.  I haven't seen my explanation anywhere, but it forms a nice connection to the other groups of 70 people, whose names <em>are</em> listed.)</p>\n<p>Also see the Malbim in Yisro at the beginning of the Har Sinai experience.  Sefaria has the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Exodus.19.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first part</a> but is missing the next few pesukim.  It's a beautiful and long piece, but the gist is that the zekeinim really were supposed to be a new reality within the Jewish people [my addition: if that had happened maybe their names would have been listed].  But when we said כל-הדברים אשר-דבר ה' נעשה we indicated that we all wanted to be like the zekeinim and were elevated to their level.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Torah mentioned all of בני שעיר because all the names listed are actually places which Esau has in his possession. As is stated in Deut. 2, God prohibited the Israelites to dwell there. Therefore God wrote them here to let the borders of Esau’s land be know.<br>\n(כתב-יד תלמידי הגר״א, ד״ה א, א:לח)</p>\n\n<p>See notes <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=36#C683\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for detailed information. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz explains (unattributed) that the digression here to recount Esav's progeny is to highlight the fulfillment of the blessings he received from Yitzchak. All of Esav's many descendants came to rule over specific lands (which in turn portends the intertwining of the descendants of Esav's offspring with our own history).</p>\n\n<p>As for why it appears here, this is akin to the Torah's account of Yishmael's generations following Avraham's death (this <em>perek</em> appears after Yitzchak's death); once the Torah \"narrative\" is essentially finished with a main actor, there's a resultant summary of the legacy. Esav is not directly mentioned anymore following this episode.</p>\n\n\n",

Esther: “Esther did not disclose her birthplace or her people” (Esther 2:20).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that Rachel spoke first is teaching us something important.

And they treated the signs of God with arrogance and called Moses a liar.  Well, Jesus raised the dead, healed those born blind and a leper. He even made birds out of clay and gave them life. And people witnessed these signs and miracles. Do Jews consider these miracles as black magic?</p>\n\n<p>(To anyone who answers this question: Could you please not use in your argument that Christians consider Jesus to be God/divine and that is the reason for not accepting him?

The Torah specifically warns against a spectrum of dark arts, idolatries, and witchcrafts which all fall into this category. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Let no one be found among you who consigns his son or daughter to the fire, or who is an augur, a soothsayer, a diviner, a sorcerer,one who casts spells, or one who consults ghosts or familiar spirits, or one who inquires of the dead. <strong>(Deut 18:11)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Oral Torah explains that this also involves the raising of the dead (necromancy). Rashi specifically touched upon this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rashi: \"or a charmer\"\n  One who collects snakes, scorpions or other creatures to one place. \n  \"a pithom sorcerer\" - one who raises the [spirit of the] dead, and it speaks from his [the sorcerer’s] armpit.\n  \"a yido’a sorcerer\" - one who inserts a bone of the animal called yido’a into his mouth, and the bone speaks by means of sorcery.\n  \"or a necromancer\" As, for example, one who raises [the dead spirit] upon his membrum, or one who consults a skull. <strong><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/2280404/jewish/Beware-the-Charmer.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Source)</a></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>You cited the story of Jesus molding a dove from clay and animating it to life.</strong> This is a known concept in the mystical traditions and it relates to the sages having discovered divine processes for animating life into clay. <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Golem.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>The Golem of Prague being one of the more famous stories of such a creature.</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Jesus did nothing that distinguished himself from various other figures beyond presenting himself as a false fulfillment of the Mashiach prophecy and declaring himself God in flesh. Miracles are miracles, and they all belong to Hashem regardless of whose hand is used. Dark magic is dark magic regardless of what you use it for and to whose benefit. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Beyond that point, we know for a fact that the writings of the New Testament were written hundreds of years after Jesus walked the earth.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/may-web-only/mark-manuscript-earliest-not-first-century-fcm.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>The earliest manuscript that exists is dated 150-250 years after Jesus.</strong></a> Since this book was rehashed and edited so many times, King James organized a council to formulate a \"finalized\" and uniform version of the book in 1611. <strong><em>(Seriously, 1611)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>The Council of Nicea (325 CE) (which canonized the NT) edited out various other writings and contradictory narratives and books in order to create a uniform text. So many different folks had so many different interpretations and themes of what exactly Jesus was and what he did that they had to have the Church literally hand-pick what stayed and what went. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Jesus was claimed to have communed with an army of dragons in a deleted Bible story. <strong>(The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, Chapter 18)</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Jesus straight up murdered a child. <strong>(Infancy Gospel of Thomas 4:1)</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Jesus convinced a snake which had bitten a child to suck out its poison. <strong>(First Gospel of Infancy 18:13-16)</strong></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So can you see my issue with the claim of <strong><em>\"Look at the amazing things that Jesus did!

We know nothing about Jesus beyond his name and beyond what the Rabbis spoke about him. The New Testament is a mishmash of conflicting stories and eyewitness accounts and themes which not could not give a clear picture of what Jesus was thematically, and which also blatantly misquoted the Torah to meet its own needs. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“For they did not continue in My covenant and I did not care[9] for\n  them…” <strong>[Hebrews 8:9]</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>“My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them…”\n  <strong>[Jeremiah 31:32]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/why-jews-cannot-accept-the-new-testament/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Source)</a></strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This question you have asked is not specific to Jesus. Why not ask the same question about other \"miracle-workers\" throughout time? Although flipping the question doesn't necessarily answer it, it does help us get somewhere. I ask you this: what do Christians think of the \"miracles\" of Mohammad? The answer is that since Christians reject the validity of the Qur'an, they also reject the validity of the miracles recorded within. </p>\n\n<p>Since Judaism does not accept the New Testament as valid, the miracles within the New Testament are rejected as well.

About halfway into the piece, they write:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וי״ל מ״מ כשהיו רואים צורך שעה היו חוזרים ללשכת הגזית כי ההיא עובדא</p>\n  \n  <p>And there is to say that, nevertheless, when they would see that there was a need, they would return to the Lishkas HaGazis [to administer the death penalty], like in “that incident.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosfos seem to be referring to a censored story on 43a; you can find this story in Oz v’Hadar, New Vilna, and Sefaria.</p>\n\n<p>What’s the reason I bring up this Tosfos?

The announcer went before him 40 days [and announced]: “Yeshu is going to be stoned on that he committed witchcraft, that he enticed [to sin], and that he enticed [to idolatry]. Whoever knows a merit for him, come and say it for him.” They did not find a merit, and he was hanged on Erev Pesach. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I should emphasize: most opinions disagree with this reading of the story, saying emphatically that Yeshu as used here is not Jesus, on the grounds that it was after the Sanhedrin stopped administering the death penalty. With Tosfos opening the door, it’s certainly possible that the answer to your question is yes. </p>\n\n\n",

Example: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The father enters the house and the son stands up. The father says \"Oh, please, you don't have to, I'm Mochel wholeheartedly\". The son says: \"Nevertheless, I'd like to show my respect by standing before you\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who said in such a case the son DOES NOT perform the Mitzvah of Kibud Av?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (based on gemara Kiddushin 32a) writes that אב שמחל על כבודו, כבודו מחול.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Chassidim (573) writes that although the Mechila works, one is still obligated 'miDinei Shamayim': </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שאמרו האב שמחל על כבודו, כבודו מחול, מדיני אדם, אבל בדיני שמים חייב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Radvaz (524) brings from the Rema (Baba Metziah) that the Mechila works only to exonerate the son from punishment, but the obligation still stands. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם כן לא תועיל המחילה כי אם לפטור אותו מהעונש אבל מצוה הוא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Perhaps the intention of the Rashba and Avudraham (who explain the reason we don't make a ברכת המצות because Mechila works) is because they understand that although some form of obligation still stands, the words וציונו would only be said on the primary obligation in it's standard form. It is also possible that the Rashba and Avudraham disagree with the aforementioned Radvaz and Sefer Chassidim.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer lies within the understanding of the Rashba's qualification that we don't make a bracha on any mitzvah which requires the involvement of another person.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer (Shu\"T OC\"H §54) proves that the Rashba did not mean to disqualify any Mitzvah whose <em>kiyum</em> requires the involvement of another. (For example, we do make a ברכת המצות on אירוסין, which requires the consent and involvement of the wife.) The Rashba meant to disqualify Mitzvos whose <em>chiyuv</em> requires the involvement of another. Any Mitzvah which is <em>bein adam lechaveiro</em> or ניתן למחילה needs another party to <strong>obligate</strong>, and such a Mitzvah doesn't require a blessing. [The Rashba's reference to Kesuvas 40a supports this] </p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, perhaps your question is answered. Although it is possible to be <em>mekayem</em> the Mitzvah without the consent or involvement of another party, the <em>obligation</em> doesn't. </p>\n\n<p>(See answer above, however, that some level of obligation still exists.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The OP is under a mistaken assumption IMHO.</p>\n\n<p>In the linked answer (provided by the OP) to another question on \"MY\", it was stated (in the name of the Rashb\"a; Teshuvos Vol. I: 18) that there is no brachah made on the mitzvah of kibbud av v'em (honoring parents) or Tzedakah (charity) because the receivers might be \"mochel\" (forego) the obligations owed to them. </p>\n\n<p>I took the liberty to correct that answer by editing the word \"mochel\" (forego) and replacing it with the idea that fits the Rashb\"a IMHO:    </p>\n\n<p>The Rashb\"a says that there is no brachah made on giving Tzedaka because the poor man might \"REFUSE\" the gift offered. (NOT MOCHEL)</p>\n\n<p>So too in the Rashba's example of kibbud av, he explains that the case is where the mitzvah is uprooted entirely, similar to when a woman REFUSES a marriage to a rapist or seducer, thereby uprooting the man's mitzvah to marry her.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously the following example of the OP is not correct:</p>\n\n<p>\"The father enters the house and the son stands up. The father says \"Oh, please, you don't have to, I'm Mochel wholeheartedly\". The son says: \"Nevertheless, I'd like to show my respect by standing before you\".</p>\n\n<p>Rather, the example that fits the Rashb\"a is:</p>\n\n<p>The father enters the house and the son stands up. The father says \"Oh, please, <strong><em>I don't want you to stand up</em></strong> for me, I'm asking you <strong><em>not to</em></strong> do it\". </p>\n\n<p>If the son says: \"Nevertheless, I want to do it anyway\" it is not a mitzvah anymore because:</p>\n\n<p>1) The father specifically asked him not to do it.</p>\n\n<p>2) Hashem is not overriding the father's request (which would make it into a mitzvah anyway), because we know that a father who is mochel his honor, then his honor is mochel.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly if you walk by a poor man and he outright \"REFUSES\" to take charity because of his pride, you will have made a blessing but cannot perform the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we don't make such blessings.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you will argue that the son knows his father doesn't mind if he stands up for him...then he should make the brachah?</p>\n\n<p>The Rashb\"a explains that once a situation like that, (uprooting the mitzvah based on someone else's wishes) in a mitzvah, is merely possible, then Halachah never established a brachah for that mitzvah, regardless of your knowledge about the person's wishes in a particular situation.</p>\n\n\n",

(Shulchan Aruch O.C. 671.)</p>\n\n<p>What would be the <em>halacha</em> on Friday of Chanuka, for one who can afford neither Shabbos nor Chanuka candles? </p>\n\n<p>Should he:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sell his clothing and use the money for Chanuka candles?

[Rationale: Shabbos candles precede Chanuka candles (Shulchan Aruch O.C. 678) because they bring <em>shalom bayis</em>; once he obtains the money, he would be obligated to use it for Shabbos, which takes priority.]</li>\n<li>He doesn't need to sell his clothing. [Rationale: The obligation to sell the clothing would be to fund Chanuka candles.

This is in accordance with the Yeshuos Malko. As pointed out by WFB in his answer, the Biur Halacha & Pri Megadim (in accordance with the Or Sameach) disagree and hold that one must sell his clothing for Shabbos too.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Rambam (Hil. Shabbos 5:1) rules that if one does not have money to purchase light for Shabbos, he should collect money to purchase oil to light: \nאפילו אין לו מה יאכל שואל על הפתחים ולוקח שמן ומדליק את הנר שזה בכלל עונג שבת.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=8218&rid=1227\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Sameach</a> explains that the Rambam's source is from the fact that Shabbos candles have precedence over Chanukah, and for Chanukah one must sell his clothing. Thus for Shabbos, one must certainly do so. Thus, if one could only obtain enough money for one, one would have to obtain money for Shabbos candles. This is also the view of the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%92#%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A3_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beiur Halachah</a>:  על הפתחים:  ועיין בסימן תרע\"א דמוכר כסותו וה\"ה הכא [פמ\"ג]. </p>\n\n<p>Others, however, infer from the wording of the Rambam that selling one's clothing is not necessary for Shabbos light. This is the position of the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=28806&rid=2852\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshuos Malko</a>. The Ponovezher Rav (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48047&st=&pgnum=74&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil. Shabbos here</a>) maintained that one is not obligated to sell his clothing for Shabbos light, because this too will decrease his shalom bayis; therefore, on Erev Shabbos, he is not obligated to sell his clothing at all. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>אמר רבא פשיטא לי נר ביתו ונר חנוכה נר ביתו עדיף משום שלום ביתו</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Says Rava: It is obvious to me, that if its a choice between light for his house (on Shabbos - see Rashi) or Channukah light, then the light for his house is more important because of peace in the home.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tractate Shabbos 23b</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is also brought as the accepted Halachah in Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 678.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that it means minimum. So, if someone had 2 candles, they would split 1 for Shabbos and 1 for Channukah. (not two for shabbos as is customary-see Kaf HaChaim)</p>\n\n<p>However, the Kaf HaChaim says that if a poor man has only 1 candle, it may double as both the Shabbos candle and the Channukah candle at the same time. He claims that in such a difficult situation of poverty, <strong>the usual prohibition of not being allowed to benefit from the light is lifted</strong> for the sake of the poor man. So he can eat the meal by the light of the Channukah candle in this case. <strong>(Kaf HaChaim quoting the Magen Avraham)</strong></p>\n\n<p>So in that case, the obligation to sell the clothing would apply so he could buy 1 Channukah candle, since it would do double service as his Shabbos light.</p>\n\n<p>(Perhaps if he had money for just one candle, he would be spared selling his clothing because he could buy one candle and use it for both Shabbos and Channukah as well.)</p>\n\n<p>He bases this on the fact that in the times of the Gemara, the mitzvah was to light near the street. Therefore, it would never dawn on Rava to say the Menorah could accomplish double service for a poor man on Shabbos (since the Channukah light needed to be in the street, while the Shabbos light had to be in the home). However, later authorities ruled that the obligation to light Menorah is fulfilled in one's home, not facing the street (See S.A. 671:7 based on the opinion of the Rema there). </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, there is room to say the prohibition to use the light would be lifted just as the Gemara allows one to use the light at a time of danger. </p>\n\n<p>The Menorah may be put on one's own table (in the home, and not the street, during times of religious persecution,) and its enough. </p>\n\n<p>The Ran asks how you can put it on your table when you will certainly come to use it. The Ran answers that in such a difficult case, the prohibition to make use of the Channukah lights is lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Further support for this is taken from Shulchan Aruch 673 which brings an opinion that holds one may make use of the Channukah lights for the sake of a mitzvah. (Shabbos light and shalom bayis for the sake of celebrating Shabbos, qualify as a mitzvah.)</p>\n\n<p>However, although some agree with the Kaf HaChaim who says this understanding is possible, not all agree.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, it would seem that a poor man relying on the Magen Avraham would place this one candle in a new location on his table to remind everyone that it is a Channukah light and not just a Shabbos light.</p>\n\n<p>(By the way: Nowadays, if the person had an electric light source, it would work as a Shabbos candle but not a Channukah candle. So money would be spent on a Channukah candle while flipping on the lightbulb before Shabbos, for Shabbos light.)</p>\n\n\n",

Fully wicked people will immediately be written and sealed for Gehinom (Hell), as it is stated: “And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall wake, some to eternal life and some to shame and everlasting contempt” (Daniel 12:2). Average people will descend to Gehinom (to be cleansed and to achieve atonement for their sins), and they will cry out in their pain and eventually ascend from there, as it is stated: “And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried; they shall call on My name, and I will answer them” (Zechariah 13:9).

The version of Maseches Sofrim that we have now is no more authoritative than what the Rishonim had.  In determining a correct text, some will also potentially take the number of words into play.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%92%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%93%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel Goldschmidt</a> (in <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=alWKRAAACAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechkarei Tefillah Upiyut</a>, page 399, but see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=28494&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> of his too) also writes about this at length.

So what do we do if we dream about him?  Well, it is more than likely that subconsciously or consciously Eliyahu Hanavi came up in conversation, or she thought about him.  In which case, it is very common for us to dream about what happened in our lives, which can have a profound effect on us.  </p>\n\n<p>If indeed she dreamed about him, and there was no connection to what she experienced that day, she should make a note of it and speak to a Gadol to ascertain precisely, if anything should be done.</p>\n\n<p>Since this was several years ago, I would take it as something that did not have a profound effect on her, since she would have gone to a Gadol immediately.

The Rabbis exegetically interpreted the word\nmorashah in this passage as if it reads me’orasah (“betrothed woman”),\nwhich teaches that the Torah’s “marriage” to the Jewish People is akin\nto a woman’s “marriage” to her husband (Berachos 57a, Pesachim 49b).\nIn this instance, the word for betrothal is erusin, and cognates of\nthat Hebrew word appear throughout the Bible in that context (for\nexample, see Ex. 22:15, Deut. 20:7; 22:23-27; 28:30). Nonetheless,\nthis essay explores the relationship of the word erusin to a later\nHebrew word for “betrothal” — kiddushin. That word and its derivatives\nappear more frequently in the Mishna than do variants of erusin, and,\nin fact, the Mishnaic tractate that deals with the laws of betrothal\nis entitled Kiddushin. If these two words refer to the same Halachic\nprocedure, does that make them synonyms? If they are indeed synonyms,\nthen why does the Bible use one word, and the Rabbis another?</p>\n<p>Before we delve into various linguistic insights concerning the words\nerusin and kiddushin, a few points about the Halachic conception of\nmarriage must be clarified. According to halacha, Jewish Marriage is a\ntwo-step process. The first step, known as erusin/kiddushin, involves\nthe bridegroom “betrothing” his intended wife. At this point, she is\nhalachically considered his wife, and the prohibition of adultery\ncomes into full swing. However, the new couple may not yet live\ntogether until the second stage of marriage (called nissuin, which is\neffectuated by chuppah).</p>\n<p>Thus, when we refer to erusin/kiddushin as “betrothal,” this does not\nmirror the Western concept of “engagement” that colloquially refers to\na couple who agreed to marry each other but did not yet do so. Rather,\nerusin/kiddushin refers to the first stage of marriage. Some scholars\nprefer the term “inchoate marriage,” but it is too cumbersome and\nobscure for our purposes. In Talmudic times, what we call “engagement”\nwas called shidduchin. This is sometimes confusing because in Modern\nHebrew the term erusin refers to a couple formally becoming “engaged”\nand declaring their intentions to later get married. However, as Rabbi\nSamson Raphael Hirsch (to Ex. 22:16) already clarifies, the earlier\nHebrew term erusin does not refer to this.</p>\n<p>In the opening discussion of Tractate Kiddushin in the Babylonian\nTalmud (Kiddushin 2b), the Saboraic Sages ask why the Mishna\n(Kiddushin 2:1) refers to betrothal as kiddushin instead of using a\nBiblical Hebrew term. They answer that the term kiddushin in the sense\nof “betrothal” is related to the hekdesh (“consecrated property”), as\none who betroths a woman forbids her from being with anybody else,\njust as consecration forbids all people from deriving benefit from the\nproperty that was consecrated.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yitzchak Vana (a Yemenite Kabbalist who died in 1670) writes\nthat kiddushin relates to hekdesh because just as consecrating\nproperty causes one who misuses that property to violate a more\nserious prohibition than previously so, so does betrothing a woman\ncause one who illicitly engages her in intimacy to violate a more\nserious prohibition than had she been single.</p>\n<p>The truth is that according to Biblical law a newlywed couple is\nalready permitted to live together once the first stage of marriage\n(erusin/kiddushin) has been completed. However, the halacha remains\nthat, by rabbinic fiat, the couple are forbidden to one another until\nthey complete the second stage of marriage. The Rabbis instituted that\na betrothed woman is forbidden to her husband until he finalizes their\nmarriage with nissuin (see Kallah 1:1 and Rashi to Kesuvos 8a).</p>\n<p>In light of this, Rabbi Alexander Sender Shor (1660-1737) and Rabbi\nElazar Moshe Horowitz (1817-1890) explain the term kiddushin as\nimplying a procedure akin to hekdesh comes into play only after the\nrabbinic enactment by which a betrothed woman becomes forbidden to her\nown husband. Accordingly, the Rabbis used the term kiddushin to\naccentuate the point that through kiddushin a woman becomes like\nhekdesh — forbidden to everyone else in the world (including her\nhusband). By contrast, since the term erusin is not loaded with this\nimplication, the Torah uses that term to denote “betrothal.” This\nmakes sense because Biblical law maintains that a betrothed woman is\npermitted to her husband, so she does not resemble hekdesh.</p>\n<p>We can offer another, similar reason as to why only the Rabbis use the\nterm kiddushin and the Bible does not. Rabbi David HaLevi Segal (Turei\nZahav to Even HaEzer 34:2) writes that the mere fact that Jewish\nMarriage is a two-step process (commencing with erusin/kiddushin and\nfinishing with nissuin) imbues it with a special holiness (kedushah)\nunseen elsewhere. According to this, we may argue that the Rabbis\ncoined the term kiddushin for “betrothal” because they were\nresponsible for instituting this two-step framework, and that\nkiddushin is what kicks off the process. On the other hand, from the\nBible’s perspective, “betrothal” is simply called erusin, which\nimplies nothing about “holiness,” because from the Bible’s perspective\nthat extra level of holiness which emanates from the two-step process\ndoes not yet exist.</p>\n<p>Tosafos(to Kiddushin 7b) mention a halachic difference between one who\neffectuates betrothal using the terminology of kiddushin and one who\nuses the terminology of erusin. There is a Talmudic principle that\neven if a man betroths “half” a woman, the betrothal still goes into\nfull effect. However, the Tosafists explain that this applies only to\na man who betroths a woman using the terminology of kiddushin. Their\nunspoken logic is that the law of kiddushin is comparable to the law\nof consecrating an animal (hekdesh). If one consecrates “half” an\nanimal for sacrificial purposes, the halacha follows that the entire\nbeast becomes holy. The Tosafists understood that the same is true\nconcerning kiddushin: If one betroths “half” a woman, then the\nkiddushin comes into full effect. However, the Tosafists maintain that\nthis comparison between the two areas of halachah is true only when\nbetrothing a woman using the term kiddushin, which is related to\nhekdesh. If, however, the groom expressed his nuptial intent using the\nterminology of erusin, then this paradigm is not in play and the\nbetrothal will only take “half” effect (whatever exactly that\nentails).</p>\n<p>Although the Saboraic Sages mentioned above connect the word kiddushin\nto hekdesh, the Tosafists (to Kiddushin 2b) point out that the plain\nmeaning of kiddushin relates to kiddush in the sense of “preparing” or\n“designating” something (e.g. see Ex. 19:10, Num. 11:18). The word\nkedeishah (“prostitute”) is a cognate of this root because such a\nwoman is \"set aside\" or “designated” for a specific purpose (see Rashi\nto Gen. 38:21 and Deut. 23:18). Others understand that the Hebrew word\nkedeishah as related to the Akkadian word qadistu, “woman of special\nstatus.” That general definition can apply to both a prostitute and a\nwife, leading Professor Shamma Friedman (a member of the Academy of\nthe Hebrew Language) to entertain this as a possible etymology for the\nterm kiddushin. Either way, these approaches maintain that kiddushin\nis unrelated to “holiness” or “consecration,” per se.</p>\n<p>The commentators buttress the Tosafists’ point with two arguments.\nFirst, in the speech act that contributes to the creation of\nkiddushin, the groom says to the bride “with this ring, you are\nmekudeshet to me…” Rabbi Avraham HaLevi of Barcelona (1235-1303) in\nChiddushei HaRaah (Kiddushin 2b), and Rabbi Yosef Ibn Ezra (1560-1620)\nin Atzmot Yosef, both note that if the term mekudeshet was meant in\nthe sense of “consecration,” then the groom would effectively be\n“consecrating” her to himself. But this would mean he is forbidding\nher to himself, just like consecrating property renders that property\nforbidden! Since this is certainly not the groom’s intention, it must\nbe that mekudeshet is a term of “preparing” or “designating.”\nMoreover, Rabbi Eliezer Asheknazi (1512-1585) argues that,\ngrammatically-speaking, if the bridegroom means to “sanctify” her, he\nshould say mukdeshet. The fact that the traditional formula instead\nreads mekudeshet indicates that he meant to “set her aside” or\n“designate” her as a wife, not to “sanctify” her.</p>\n<p>Dr. Michael Satlow suggests that the Mishnaic term kiddushin is\nactually a “loanword” from the Greek legal term ekdosis, which refers\nto a bride's father \"handing over\" the girl to her new husband. While\nthis is a fascinating proposal, it is quite difficult to accept\nbecause \"handing over\" the bride is actually the definition of nissuin\n(see Ketuvos 4:5). It is thus quite problematic to argue that this is\nthe etymological basis for the term kiddushin. Nevertheless, one could\nargue that the Rabbis may have adapted/adopted this Greek word, and\nslightly modified its pronunciation and meaning — as they often did\nwhen making use of foreign words.</p>\n<p>Let’s now turn our attention to the word erusin andits possible\netymologies. The Yemenite Sage Rabbi Shalom Mansoura of Sanna (d.\n1888) explains that erusin is an expression of “tying” (similar to the\nEnglish euphemism for marriage, “tying the knot”). Rabbi Yitzchak\nRatzabi offers two ways of explaining this etymology. First, he cites\nRabbi Baurch HaLevi Epstein (1860-1940), who writes that the root of\nerusin, ALEPH-REISH-SIN/SAMECH, should be understood as congruent to\nthe root erez, ALEPH-REISH-ZAYIN, because the letters SIN/SAMECH and\nZAYIN are interchangeable. The latter root refers to something packed\ntightly (see Yechezkel 27:24), like the word arizah (“package”) in\nModern Hebrew, so it makes sense that erusin would also refer to the\npowerful bonds of matrimony. Rabbi Epstein also notes that erez is\nrelated to aizor (“tight belt”) by way of metathesis, continuing in\nthe same theme of “tying” something tightly. Alternatively, Rabbi\nRatzabi suggests that Rabbi Mansoura means that erusin is related to\n“tying” by way of a simpler metathesis without replacing any of the\nletters. If we simply transpose the final two letters of the root\nALEPH-REISH-SIN/SAMECH, then we get ALEPH-SIN/SAMECH-REISH, which\nmeans “tie” or “bind.” A betrothed woman is “tied” to her husband in\nthe sense that the only way she can marry someone else is if he grants\nher a bill of divorce (or dies).</p>\n<p>Rabbi Vana argues that the word arusah (“betrothed woman”) is related\nto the Hebrew word eres (“poison”), because once a woman is betrothed\nto another, then she becomes like a poisonous snake or scorpion in the\nsense that anyone who illicitly approaches her is liable for the death\npenalty.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ratzabi cites another Yemenite scholar who explains that a\nbetrothed woman is called an arusah in the same sense that a\nsharecropper is called an aris. The sharecropper enters a sort of\npartnership with the owner of the field, and thus retains partial\nrights to its produce. In a similar vein, a betrothed woman enters\ninto a partnership with her future husband, who at that point only has\na partial “claim” over her (in that she is now forbidden to commit\nadultery), but not a complete entitlement (i.e. if she dies, he does\nnot inherit her property).</p>\n<p>Finally, Rabbi Ratzabi offers two suggestions of his own towards\nunderstanding the etymology of erusin, both of which invoke the\ninterchangeability of the letter ALEPH with AYIN. He explains that the\nroot AYIN-REISH-SIN/SAMECH refers to “mixing,” like in the case of\narisah (“dough”) which is mixed/kneaded. In some sense, erusin\n(spelled with an ALEPH)also refers to a “mixture” of sorts, as it\nrepresents the joining of man and wife in matrimony. Alternatively,\nRabbi Ratzabi connects the word erusin to eres (“bed”), spelled with\nan AYIN, as an allusion to the conjugal reasons for marriage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Similarly, when one studies Torah, he brings light to the branches (i.e. the mitzvot) as well.

Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, also known as the \"Ba'al HaTanya\".</sup></p>\n\n<p><sup>2. This is doubtful the reason why this is the minhag, but it's an interesting story nonetheless. I believe the real reason is because we don't want to distract ourselves from the real beauty of the tallis, the tzitzis, by which the entire tallis is necessary, with a flashy atarah. Or, as brought down in the Aruch HaShulchan (thanks @user <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1418/sam\">sam</a>) to not mistakenly think that the ikkar of the mitzvah is atifas rosh.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3404&st=&pgnum=44\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ashkavta D'Rebbe by R' Moshe Dovber Rivkin (footnote 17)</a>, R' Rivkin saw that Chabad Chassidim do not have an Atara on their Tallit. But he knows the story that when the Alter Rebbe was in jail, the chassidim sold their Ataras and gave the money to the Baal HaTanya's legal fund. </p>\n\n<p>This means that there was a time when Chabad Chassidim did have Ataras on their Tallit. In order to resolve this contradiction, R' Rivkin posits that that was when they stopped. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The footnote also goes through the pros and cons of having an Atara, based on whether the Tzitit on the front of the Tallit must always be worn in the front (different opinions of the Shalah HaKadosh and the Ari HaKadosh whether the Tzitzit on the Tallit are like the Pillars in the Mishkan, which each had a specific place).</p>\n\n<p>R' Rivkin then concludes that the Chabad custom has the best of all worlds, because it does not have a silver Atara, which would be a problem according to the Levush, but they do always keep the front of the Tallit as the front [perhaps referring to the silk lining that goes on the underside of the Tallit that the head goes under (see <a href=\"http://www.tallit-shop.com/tallit/chabad-tallis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)].</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>All these opinions are brought and discussed in more detail in R' Yochanan Gurary's sefer Chikrei Minhagim, you can <a href=\"https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?28748\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see it on page 17 here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also see a summary of some the opinions in English <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1672725/jewish/Why-the-Crown-on-the-Tallit-Prayer-Shawl.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

But [to put them] on a table that's meant for arranging cooked foods, it is permitted to put one next to the other.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>REMA (discussing when two friends dine together, one eating meat and the other cheese)</strong>...\"And they should be careful not to drink from a single vessel because food sticks to the vessel. And of course they should not eat from the same bread. And so is our custom to have individual salt-vessels for each person themselves, because sometimes when they dip into the salt there remains leftovers of the food in the salt.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Rema explains that we should not eat cheese, and then drink from a cup, afterwards passing the cup to a friend who is eating meat, so he can use the recently used cup. (or vice versa)</p>\n\n<p>So, since these two diners are willing to share \"germs\" and \"cooties\" :) , we do fear that meat residue on a recently used cup will be licked/eaten by the second drinker who currently has a mouth full of cheese, at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>From here we can see that a person alone, using a water bottle while munching cheese, should not soon afterwards eat meat while drinking from that same bottle. After all, you are your own best friend. :)</p>\n\n<p>The Shach says that such a mixing of use is in fact \"forbidden\".</p>\n\n<p>The Kaf HaChaim however brings down that it is \"incorrect or inappropriate\" behavior.</p>\n\n<p>He then goes on to say that if you and your friend (and therefore you alone as well) are careful to clean your mouth before using the cup, or wipe your lips well before using the cup, then its OK.</p>\n\n<p>No authority that I know of would go so far as to say the vessel becomes a milk vessel or meat vessel etc. simply because you drank cold water from it at a meal with cheese or meat. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, if you do see with your eyes, a blob of cheesy or meaty substance floating in the bottle, then it should be washed out before using at the opposite meal. </p>\n\n<p>The problem seems to be a real residue of actual foodstuff clinging to the mouth of the vessel. </p>\n\n<p>Backwash from your throat, dragging semi-digested particle back into the bottle, doesn't seem to be a concern here.</p>\n\n<p>It would therefore seem that washing the bottle out and cleaning the rim would definitely be more than enough, (and count as an an extra effort to beautify Kashrus observance,) to use it for a later meal of opposite food. </p>\n\n<p>Cleaning the rim by itself, without washing it out,(and of course making sure your mouth is now clean from previous food) does seem quite adequate without the need for changing the water.</p>\n\n<p>So if you drink half a bottle, and then inspect the rim and wipe it, there should be no need to dump the other half of the bottle if you need to save that water for a later opposite meal.</p>\n\n<p>Of Course, its always nice to have two bottles, because anything that's done to enhance separation of milk and meat is usually a bonus in Kashrus. Some also consider it nice to clean the bottle out and dump the water, if water is usually not scarce or expensive. </p>\n\n<p>NOTE: This applies to a bottle that is used casually for water etc. A bottle used for milk, or gravy, or one that is absorbing a lot of backwash residue and particles of meat and milk, (especially if made of pottery) or under conditions of heat etc. is a different issue which is beyond the scope of the OP.</p>\n\n<p>As always, these are the Halachic sources. For a practical decision in a particular case, you should always ask your local Orthodox Rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Assuming you mean something like the bottles you take on a bike or a poland sportscap, as long as it's clean and the mouthpiece is washed in cold water you are fine with one.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there some information in Jewish religious literature addressing this question?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The concept of <em>guarding the eyes</em> is set up to prevent one from forbidden relationships. The list for a Jew is enumerated <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960647/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. The Talmud Yerushalmi Brachot 1:5 states that the eyes [and heart] cause one to sin (in the right context). In Nedarim 20a it also states that one who looks at forbidden relationship will eventually come to commit a sin. </p>\n\n<p>Recounted by Rambam in \n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Repentance.4.4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Repentance 4:4:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He who wantonly stares at the opposite sex, for he thinks that it is of no matter, saying: \"Have I stilled an urge, or even been near her\"? whereas he remains oblivious to the fact that purposeful eye-staring is a great iniquity and begets actual unchastity, even as it is said: \"And that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes\" (Num. 15.39). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Non-Jews however, do not have a lengthy list of prohibited relationships; just six. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188354/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam, Kings 9:5:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are six illicit sexual relations forbidden to a gentile:\n  a) his mother;\n  b) his father's wife;\n  c) a married woman;\n  d) his maternal sister;\n  e) a male;\n  f) an animal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It comes out that a form of <em>guarding the eyes</em> may need to be implemented, should such issues arise. But surely any method could work. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One of the primary prohibitions in looking at illicit material is that it causes improper thoughts. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכאן א\"ר פינחס בן יאיר: אל יהרהר אדם ביום ויבא לידי טומאה בלילה - כתובות מ״ו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The prohibition (see Igros Moshe E\"H 1 §69) of improper thoughts is because it can cause הוצאת זרע לבטלה [wasting seed].</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not Noahides have the prohibition of wasting seed would depend on the reasoning for the prohibition: If wasting seed is prohibited because of P'ru Urevu (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosafot_on_Sanhedrin.59b.3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos Sanhedrin 59b</a>), a Noahide would not be forbidden (because a Noahide is not commanded to procreate [Tos. ad loc]. See, however, Tosfos Chagiga 2b, who implies that a Noahide is commanded in Pru Urevu, in accordance with the Sheiltos 165 and the <em>pashtus</em> of Yevamos 62). </p>\n\n<p>If, however, the prohibition is from Lo Sinaf (או״ז א-קכ״ד, סמ״ק רצ״ב), a Noahide would indeed be prohibited from wasting seed.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, from the day that Yosef was kidnapped, Ruach HaKodesh was removed from him; he saw, but didn’t see, heard, but didn’t hear. Because of why does it not say that there was food [אוכל] in Mitzraim, that it says “that there was food [שבר] in Mitzraim”? Is it not already written, “and there was a famine across all of the Land of Mitzraim”? What is the passuk coming to teach us by saying “there is שבר”? Rather, don’t read it as “there was שבר”, but as “there was סבר,” for he saw in a vision that his hope [סבר] was in Mitzraim - and who was this? This was Yosef. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yaakov couldn’t see prophetically well; he knew there was <em>something</em> in Mitzraim, but couldn’t tell what. The brothers seemed to understand, though, and when they went down, they sought out Yosef. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֵּרְדוּ אֲחֵי יוֹסֵף, בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל צָרִיךְ הַמִּקְרָא לוֹמַר,\n  אֶלָּא בַּתְּחִלָּה לֹא נָהֲגוּ בּוֹ אַחְוָה וּמְכָרוּהוּ, וּלְסוֹף\n  מִתְחָרְטִין וְאוֹמְרִים אֵימָתַי נֵרֵד לְמִצְרַיִם נַחְזִיר אֶת\n  אָחִינוּ לְאָבִיו, וּכְשֶׁאָמַר לָהֶם אֲבִיהֶם לֵירֵד לְמִצְרַיִם\n  נָתְנוּ כֻּלָּם דַּעַת אַחַת לְהַחֲזִירוֹ.</p>\n  \n  <p>“And Yosef’s brothers went down.” The passuk needed to say “the sons of Israel”! Rather, at the beginning, they did not treat him with brotherly love and they sold him; in the end, they regretted it, and they said, “when will we go down to Mitzraim to return our brother to our father? When their father told them to go down to Mitzraim, they all set out with one mind to return him. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, when the opportunity arises, they jump on it - and they even spend time looking for Yosef before even getting their grain. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִיָּד אָמַר לָהֶם יוֹסֵף סִתְמוּ אֶת הָאוֹצָרוֹת וּפִתְחוּ אוֹצָר\n  אֶחָד, וְנָתַן שְׁמוֹתָם לְבַעַל הָאוֹצָר, וְאָמַר לוֹ רְאֵה\n  כְּשֶׁיָּבוֹאוּ הָאֲנָשִׁים אֵלּוּ לְיָדְךָ תְּפֹשׂ אוֹתָם וְשַׁגֵּר\n  אוֹתָם לְפָנַי, עָבְרוּ שְׁלשֶׁת יָמִים וְלֹא בָאוּ, מִיָּד נָטַל\n  יוֹסֵף שִׁבְעִים גִּבּוֹרִים מִבֵּית הַמֶּלֶךְ וְשִׁגֵּר בִּשְׁבִילָם\n  לְבַקֵּשׁ אוֹתָם בַּשּׁוּק, הָלְכוּ וּמָצְאוּ אוֹתָם בַּשּׁוּק שֶׁל\n  זוֹנוֹת, וּמַה טִּיבָן בַּשּׁוּק שֶׁל זוֹנוֹת, אֶלָּא אָמְרוּ אָחִינוּ\n  יוֹסֵף יְפֵה תֹאַר וִיפֵה מַרְאֶה, שֶׁמָּא בְּקֻבָּה הוּא. וְתָפְשׂוּ\n  אוֹתָן וֶהֱבִיאוּם לִפְנֵי יוֹסֵף.</p>\n  \n  <p>Immediately [upon the brothers’ arrival to Mitzraim through separate gates], Yosef said to [the gatekeepers], “Close the granaries and leave just one open.” He gave [the brothers’] names to the watched of [that] granary and said to him, “See to it that when these men come to your hand, grab them and bring them before me.” Three days passed, and they did not come. Immediately, Yosef took seventy strong men from the palace and sent them out on their behalf to find them in the marketplace. They went and found them in the marketplace of harlots - and what good was there in the marketplace of harlots? Rather, they said, “our brother Yosef is a handsome man; maybe he is in a stall” - and they grabbed them and brought them before Yosef. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here’s the crux of your question, I think: why didn’t they seek him out sooner? You can’t say that the Parsha of Yehudah in fact happened later, because it explicitly says that it happened “at that time.” While the Midrash doesn’t quote that the brothers regretted their decision until the one cited above, Rashi does indeed bring down both teachings; you could say it’s a dispute amongst Midrashim, but you can’t say that Rashi is arguing on himself. </p>\n\n<p>I can think of two answers to this; I haven’t seen anyone address the question at all. </p>\n\n<p>The first answer lies in a careful reading of these two sources. The Rashi you cite says that “had you told us to return him, we would have obeyed you.” He doesn’t say anything about regretting their decision - for all we know, they still felt that they were correct. But the fact that Yaakov’s pain was so much worse than they anticipated - that was reason to demote Yehudah, for that part, at least, was not right. Even when one feels that he’s doing the right thing, he can’t harm someone who did nothing wrong. </p>\n\n<p>However, as time went on, the brothers began to see a fuller picture, until they finally longed for an opportunity to rescue their brother - they finally regretted their sin. </p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t fully answer the question, though, as they still should have gone down immediately when they fully regretted it, rather than long for an opportunity; to that I present answer number two: the brothers didn’t want to torment Yaakov any more than they already did. Yaakov thinks Yosef is dead, and the brothers see that he’s inconsolable. What should they say now? </p>\n\n<p>“Hey, Dad, we’re going to Mitzraim for the week. Don’t worry about us.” </p>\n\n<p>“Oh, okay. What’s the occasion?” </p>\n\n<p>“Um... Yosef’s not dead? We actually sold him to Mitzraim?”</p>\n\n<p>“Are you nuts?! I’ve been sitting here crying all this time - because <em>you</em> told me that Yosef was dead - and all this time you <em>knew</em> that he was still alive?!”</p>\n\n<p>Whether Yaakov would have actually reacted this way or not there’s no way to tell, but perhaps the brothers were concerned for that possibility.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why Did Yosef Get Punished For His Hishtadlut While Yaakov Didn't?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Putting Dinah's box situation aside, Yaakov wasn't punished for taking multiple measures in preparation of his confrontation with Esav.  He should have just prayed, but he also sent gifts, separated his camps, etc..</p>\n\n<p>One answer to this is that we learn from here that hishtadlut is important alongside prayer.  So then, why did Yosef get punished for asking the winemaker to remember him? (According to Rashi)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:  </p>\n\n<p>I don't think a commentator says that Yaakov was successful in his meeting with Esav due to his hishtadlut, but nobody, seemingly, says he was wrong for his hishtadlut, and so it can be figured that his hishtadlut was a good thing.  I think it's the Ramban that says that, from Yaakov's hishtadlut, we learn how to deal with our enemies and not just to rely on righteousness or miracles.</p>\n\n<p>Also, could something be said for Yaakov's formal prayer in the midst of him preparing to meet Esav?  It does not seem that Yosef formally prayed to Hash-m in addition to telling the winemaker not to forget him, unless I am missing something?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To show you that the Halachah is not universal and when one is allowed to show some personal effort, someone else is expected to fully rely on Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>I would go even further and say that the same person might have different situations - in some of those where he's \"expected\" to be prepared and in others to fully submit himself to Hashem's will.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, you could never know if a certain behavior will turn out a big Mitzvah or a misdeed, we can only reveal it a-posteriori after Hashem reacts - there's no way of knowing it apriori. So Yossef thought that Hishtadlus will work for him and it had 50/50 chances, but Hashem had different plans and it TURNED-OUT to be a misdeed.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As you probably noticed, our forefathers were all different in their conduct - some went abroad and some not, some were allowed to have maidservants and some not etc. As their souls were not the same their ways of serving Hashem were different. Moreover, Yaakov himself was very different before and after he stole the Blessings.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One is supposed to do <em>hishtadlus</em> but not supposed to overdo it. In the case of Yaakov, each part of the action was different and was part of the proper <em>hishtadlus</em>. That is, prayer, bribery, and preparation for war were separate actions each of which were appropriate ways of setting up the situation.</p>\n\n<p>Yosef on the other hand, asked the butler to remember him. That was the action of <em>hishtadlut</em> and was proper. He then asked a second time , which repeated the action which was improper. There are meforshim who ask:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since Yosef was punished by a two year delay for asking twice, What\n  would his punishment have been had he only asked once?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer is none, since that was proper hishtadlus.</p>\n\n<p>An analogy is given to buying a lottery ticket. One ticket is hishtadlus, more than one is not proper.</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish in his sefer <em>Emunah U'Vitachon</em> says that the act of asking in such a specific way of the butler was an improper <em>histadlus</em> because the character of the butler was such that the act itself was not <em>normal</em> hishtadlus but an act of desperation normally carried out by someone lacking in <em>bitachon</em>. The Art Scroll biography in Chapter 10, Emunah and Bitachon, in the subsection<em>The Role of Hishtadlus</em>, quotes the Chazon Ish as follows.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yosef knew that his rescue was not dependent on <em>hishtadlus</em>, for all\n  is from Hashem. Only, since a person is obligated to act and not rely\n  on miracles, Yosef obligated himself to utilize this opportunity and\n  make his request of the cup bearer. However, since the arrogant by\n  nature do not remember others to do them good, this act [of requesting\n  the cup-bearer's help] is only fit for one who has despaired, for such\n  a person makes every possible effort, even that which is distant from\n  achieving any results. The <em>bote'ach</em> (one possessing <em>bitachon</em>),\n  though, does not do such things, and such efforts are not obligated.\n  To the contrary, engaging in them is like throwing dust upon the\n  radiance of one's <em>emunah</em> and <em>bitachon</em>. Once such an act is not\n  deemed obligatory, it becomes forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The biographer comments that it was not a lack of <em>bitachon</em> but a mistake in analyzing what <em>hishtadlus</em> required:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus, Yosef epitomized the classic <em>botei'ach</em>; however he erred in\n  this single instance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/hamaayan-5758-miketz/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah.org</a> cites the medrash</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The midrash comments on this: “‘Praiseworthy is the man who has made\n  Hashem his trust’ (Tehilim 40:5) – this is Yosef – ‘and turned not to\n  the arrogant’ (bid) – because Yosef said to Pharaoh’s butler, ‘If only\n  you would think of me,’ and, ‘mention me,’ he remained in prison an\n  extra two years.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article cites the standard meforshim</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many commentaries ask: This midrash appears to contradict itself!\n  First it states that the one “who has made Hashem his trust” is Yosef.\n  Then it appears to say that Yosef was punished for placing his trust\n  in the butler! Most commentaries explain that the first half of the\n  midrash gives the background for the second half. For most people, it\n  would not be a sin to ask the butler for help. “G-d helps those who\n  help themselves.” However, because Yosef usually placed his trust in\n  Hashem to an extraordinary degree, it was a failing on his part to ask\n  the butler for help. (This answer is given by Bet Halevi and others.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it gives an alternative explanation by <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/rabbi-azariah-figo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R’ Azaryah Figo z”l</a> (1579-1647).</p>\n\n<p>He explains that Yosef never placed his trust in the butler, and Hashem left Yosef in jail for an extra two years in order to demonstrate this. He interprets Yosef’s words to the butler as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Even if you would think of me with yourself when [Pharaoh] benefits you,\n  and [even if] you will do me a kindness and mention me\n  to Pharaoh, the most you could do is to get me out of this building.\n  [That would solve my immediate physical problem, but not my spiritual\n  problem.] For indeed I was kidnaped from the land of the Hebrews [and\n  thus expelled from before G-d]. Here I have done nothing for [my\n  spiritual betterment, and therefore G-d has caused that they] have put\n  me in the pit.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Without this interpretation, says R’ Figo, one might wonder how the\n  butler could be so ungrateful as to forget Yosef. With this\n  interpretation, however, it is understandable; in effect, Yosef told\n  the butler that his help was not wanted. The reason Yosef said this\n  was to emphasize that the interpretation of dreams comes from Hashem\n  and that Yosef deserved no credit.</p>\n  \n  <p>Just to make clear that Yosef never expected help from the butler,\n  Hashem caused the butler to forget Yosef and leave Yosef in jail. The\n  last verse of last week’s parashah states, “And the butler did not\n  remember Yosef, and he forgot him.” Why the redundant language – “did\n  not remember” and “forgot”? In line with the above interpretation, R’\n  Figo suggests that the phrase, “and he forgot him,” means that Yosef\n  forgot the butler. (Binah La’ittim: Drush Rishon Le’Chanukah)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/335775/jewish/G-d-and-the-Butler.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a> points out that if the butler had remembered Yosef immediately and gotten him released, Yosef would not have been raised to become the viceroy of Egypt and saved his family and set up the persecution in Egypt and the Exodus. Hashem had to <strong>make</strong> the butler forget until it was time for Pharaoh to have the dream in order to call Yosef from the prison.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The answer lies in the dynamics of Joseph’s story itself. What would\n  have happened had Joseph been released in time? What would Joseph have\n  done on the other side? He would have been known as an ex-convict, and\n  would have struggled to find his place within Egyptian society.</p>\n  \n  <p>As it happened, he waited two short years until Pharaoh had a dream\n  that would require interpretation, and the butler remembered him for\n  his uncanny interpreting abilities. Joseph was brought before Pharaoh\n  and successfully interpreted the dream. Pharaoh was extremely\n  impressed, and appointed him viceroy of Egypt. Had Joseph been\n  released two years earlier, the butler would likely not have known\n  where to find him, and a historic opportunity would have been lost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the punishment was that Hashem did not send the dream until the second birthday after the release of the butler. Had Yosef not had the punishment, perhaps Hashem would have sent the dream the next birthday and the butler would have remembered Yosef (who predicted he would be spared) even without Yosef having asked for help.</p>\n\n\n",

It would help to see sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>My answer is ONLY an outline of the algorithm of resolving such a conflict assuming both parts are observant Jews.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Before discussing anything, <strong>we need to know who was that guy</strong> that <em>\"You called someone to fix the broken pipe\"</em> - was it his son, neighbor, friend, an amateur or a professional plumber. The following discussion only applies to a professional plumber that falls under a אומן category. All other just do a favor and bear no liability whatsoever even if rewarded. For example, I always warn my neighbors that all my help in plumbing or electricity or computer fixing is unprofessional and I'm not responsible for the outcomes.</p></li>\n<li><p>First, we <strong>check if there's a civil law</strong> regarding the plumber's responsibility. Theoretically, such a law might obligate all the plumbers (or car technicians or computer guys etc) to be liable for damages of the repair with certain limitations. That's דינא דמלכותא and it sets the abiding Halachah.</p></li>\n<li><p>If nothing particular is found we continue to מנהג המדינה - <strong>the practice commonly accepted by professionals in that area</strong>. That's the \"implied liability\" we have. One might call a couple of local professional plumbing agencies and tell them a sink leaks and ask how much will it cost. Then ask whether the repair is backed by any warranty as they see it. The chances are that many of them will explicitly mention warranty, maybe even including collateral damages, as they are all insured.<br>\n.<br>\nUnfortunately, <strong>many people have a misunderstanding</strong> of the common professional liabilities in many areas. For example, the content of a hard drive is not covered by reinstalling an operating system on a PC.</p></li>\n<li><p>The next step is <strong>the claim</strong>, as all the financial matters are a subject to forgiveness, the homeowner must claim the damage. He can otherwise attribute it to himself or to a lack of luck. So we need to be sure he's claiming damages.</p></li>\n<li><p>The next step is <strong>to find on whose side is the burden of proof</strong>. Here we follow the המוציא מחברו principle - meaning one who's breaking the status quo must bring the evidence. And in this case, there are two options based on the results of #2: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>if customarily there's no warranty for repairs you have to prove that the plumber CAUSED the leak directly by פשיעה, say, cutting it badly or damaging a rubber band</li>\n<li>if he's customarily held responsible for the repair, he must prove his repair was fine and the owner used the sink unconditionally or else.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>In the later (thanks DannyF), he might still claim that דמים יוכיחו - the <strong>price paid might be an indicator/proof of the work performed</strong>, so if he charged $20 it was probably something very minor with no warranty and the common practice does not apply to him, but for $200 you expect a lot more and a warranty.<br>\n.<br>\nFor example, a guy gives me a computer to fix and I run CHKDSK and it fixes the problem. I charge $10 and everybody's happy. A day later he comes back and claims the computer does not work at all and turns out his disk is dead. The price he paid shows clearly that I only addressed the local problem, and the big problem is not the result of my work.</p></li>\n<li><p>If he's found liable, there's a question of liability for the collateral damages (גרמא/גרמי), like the damage made by the water. The common Halachah is that one is not liable for such damages, but still, #1 and #2 override it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>I know you expect a more Halachic answer, but I only publish it for many others that would like to know how this situation is resolved</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

I read <em>Siftei Chachamim's</em> explanation on Rash\"i, and I'm still puzzled as to why Rash\"i doesn't go with the literal meaning that it means \"bread\" (or \"food\").</p>\n\n<p>First - What would it mean to \"eat\" someone's wife? I.e. - if Rash\"i is stating that the Torah used \"Lashon Naki\", he's implying that the other way is <em>not</em> \"naki\". But, \"eating\" one's wife doesn't sound like it means anything at all. How does Rash\"i state that it's not \"naki\". And even if it weren't, how does Rash\"i know that it means \"wife\"? It could be anything.</p>\n\n<p>Second - Why couldn't it mean \"bread\"? After all, we see that when Yosef's brothers arrived and Yosef invites them to eat at his home, the Torah states that the Egyptians wouldn't eat bread with the Hebrews. Potiphar clearly knew that Yosef was a Hebrew and he wouldn't want Yosef touching his bread. So, why not go by the literal translation esp. where there is clear support for the idea?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I assume that the answer lies <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0139.htm#9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">three <em>p'sukim</em> later</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֵינֶנּוּ גָדוֹל בַּבַּיִת הַזֶּה מִמֶּנִּי וְלֹא-חָשַׂךְ מִמֶּנִּי מְאוּמָה כִּי אִם-אוֹתָךְ בַּאֲשֶׁר אַתְּ-אִשְׁתּוֹ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>39:6 says Yosef had access to everything but Potifar's bread, and 39:9 says Yosef had access to everything but Potifar's wife.

Commentaries that support \"scribal additions\":</strong></p>\n<p>Some manuscripts of the Ibn Ezra's commentary contain the following addition, which sounds like he supports the view that Ezra added this word to the Torah, because he wasn't sure whether or not it originally belonged:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נקודות על וישקהו – [וכן י״ד אחרים בכל המקרא, והיודע סודם נפטר, כי היה שמו עזרא.]‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shadal notes that the verse would make perfect sense even if that word was not originally present (compare Bereishis 46:29, with Ya'akov and Yosef, where the text does not say explicitly that he kissed him, but also notes that many scholars support this view, and cites textual support from Origen. I don't have access to it (nor do I even know what remains of this part of the Torah), but the <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/sep/genesis/33.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Septuagint here</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37701&st=&pgnum=70\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peshitta here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=SP%7Creference=Gen.33&options=NVHUG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samaritan Torah here</a> all have it in their texts.  There are no Dead Sea scrolls that contain these verses.  The Targumin seem to by and large follow the other interpretation, as we will mention.</p>\n<p>As noted by the commentaries to Maseches Sofrim, this understanding is accepted by Tosfos (Piskei Tosfos Menachos 232) and the Taz (YD 274), and they Pasken that therefore, a Sefer Torah missing these dots is still Kosher. An interesting follow-up question would be what the halacha is if the Torah was missing this, and if there is any Posek that would entertain the possibility of it being kosher nevertheless (I doubt it).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Commentaries that support a Midrashic reading</strong></p>\n<p>Various other commentaries quote Midrashim that address this.  The Midrash (Pirkei Derabbi Eliezer, cited in Minchat Shai here, but also in other Midrashim, and Sifsei Chachamim has another interesting version) tells us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אל תקרי וישקהו אלא וישכהו</p>\n<p>Don't read [this word as] \"and he kissed him\", rather [as] \"and he bit him\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yanai in Bereishis Rabbah here makes the inference from the dots over this word, as opposed to directly from the possible swapped reading. No one says clearly that they are meant to be bite marks, though... :)</p>\n<p>Many of the mefarshim (including Radak, Tur, Minchat Shai, Sifsei Chachamim, Targum Pseudo-Yonasan, Yerushalmi, and the Targum Neofiti marginal notes) follow this understanding of the Passuk.</p>\n<p>Various other mefarshim (I'm not making another list) quote other Midrashim here that suggest what we saw in Avos Derabbi Nosson (also found in many other Midrashic sources, such as Bereishis Rabbah), that this is telling us about Esav's intentions, that it was not sincere, or that only this time it was sincere.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Alternative understandings</strong></p>\n<p>Ralbag notes that this was dotted to show that it was something between a kiss and a non kiss, and is thus suspended between being written and not being written (therefore it is dotted). (This sort of fits with approach #2, and a bit with approach #1.)</p>\n<p>Rav Dovid Zvi Hoffman suggests that the dots were added to emphasize that this word remained in the text, because it would be easy to think that it was not true.  Quite original.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To conclude - we cannot say definitively which of the above approaches is correct (although we can say that they were not intended as bite marks).  If we follow the Piskei Tosfos and Taz, we can say that the Torah originally MAY have omitted this entire word, and Ezra filled it in due to doubt.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# On the interpretation of Genesis 1: 1\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm an Italian noahide. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some observations on Genesis 1: 1, about which I would very much like to know your opinion.</p>\n\n<p>1 In most translations I have consulted, the verse is thus render:” In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth”. It is a very ancient translation, already found in the Septuagint: Εν ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν”. According to this meaning, if I am not mistaken, the conception of the \"creatio ex nihilo\" is founded, supported by many masters of the Jewish tradition including Rambam and Ramban. According to this exegesis, before this \"beginning\" there was nothing except HaShem, neither matter nor time.</p>\n\n<p>2 In the translation edited by Judaica Press, however, this is the version: \"In the beginning of God's creation of the heavens and the earth”. This second interpretation, if I understand correctly, does not see \"the beginning\" in the absolute sense, but only as the beginning of the described creation, thus opening the possibility of hypothesizing that:</p>\n\n<p>-God may have created and then destroyed other universes before creating the one in which we live;</p>\n\n<p>-God may have created this universe using a matter that existed before the \"beginning\" (I have also read some articles written by Orthodox Jews who support the creation of the universe from a pre-existing matter).</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I was very surprised by these two statements:</p>\n\n<p>3 Rambam, in his monumental \"Guide for the Perplexed,\" says that Genesis does not actually test the creation of the world, because his words in this sense could have an allegorical meaning, such as those that would make one think of a body dimension of God.According to Maimonides the Tanakh does not prove neither the eternity of the world nor his creation, and if we must adhere to the theory of creation it is because the theory of the eternity of matter seriously endangers religious faith;</p>\n\n<p>4 The great rabbi, philosopher and poet Yehudah ha-Levi says, in his famous work \"Al Khazari\"(I,67):</p>\n\n<p>“The question of eternity and creation is obscure, whilst the arguments are evenly balanced. The theory of creation derives greater weight from the prophetic tradition of Adam, Noah, and Moses, which is more deserving of credence than mere speculation. If, after all, a believer in the Torah finds himself compelled to admit an eternal matter and the existence of many worlds prior to this one, this would not impair his belief that this world was created at a certain epoch, and that Adam and Eve were the first human beings.”</p>\n\n<p>How do you see these multiple positions?</p>\n\n<p>I express my personal reflection: I do not know what is the most precise meaning between \"in the beginning\" and \"in the beginning of”, but I believe that to hypothesize previous creations, by God, of universes that have disappeared today ,or the creation of this universe from pre-existing matter, provided it is always created by God, does not pose problems with regard to the biblical faith; but I am of the opinion , without obviously wanting to disrespect the great Rabbi Yehudah ha-Levi,that the theory of eternal matter is incompatible with the monotheism taught by the Tanakh. In fact, if the matter were eternal wold not be  born of an act of God's will and this, in my opinion, would necessarily lead to one of the following two conclusions:</p>\n\n<p>-There would not be one God but two gods, HaShem and matter, because both of them would be eternal and therefore \"autonomous\" from one another;</p>\n\n<p>-God and matter would coincide: it would reach a pantheism that would destroy the principle of HaShem’s transcendence and His irreducible \"otherness\" compared to any other existing reality.</p>\n\n<p>As for the possible \"allegorical\" sense of which Rambam speaks, I do not know what to think. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This was one of the hottest topics in medieval Jewish philosophy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Saadia Gaon</a> devoted the first treatise of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emunoth_ve-Deoth\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Emunot V'Deiot</a></em> to proving <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> and refuting the opposing arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an excerpt from his introduction to that treatise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore, O thou that seekest the truth, may God be gracious unto thee, if our discussion yield to thee any conclusion of such a nature as [for example] the doctrine of <em>creatio ex nihilo</em>, do not hasten to reject it, since it was precisely something like this that thou didst look for from the beginning of thy quest, and [since] whoever else goes out in search of the truth does likewise. Hear, rather, and realize that thy proofs are stronger than those of the others and that thou art in possession of arguments by means of which thou canst refute any faction of them. Furthermore thou hast over them the advantage of being in possession of miracles and marvels that have been established for thee [as trustworthy]. Therefore hold on to the following three points in every chapter of this book: namely, (<em>a</em>) that thy proofs are stronger than those of the others, (<em>b</em>) that thou art able to refute anyone that disagrees with thee, and (<em>c</em>) that the miracles of thy prophets are a part of thy advantage.

Bahya Ibn Paquda</a> addressed creation in his <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chovot_HaLevavot\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chovot Halevavot</a></em> in Chapter Five of \"The Gate of Unity\". He claims to have proved <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> on the basis of three premises:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Something cannot create itself.</li>\n<li>There must be a first cause which is preceded by no prior cause.</li>\n<li>Anything composite must have been generated.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> devoted a sizable chunk of Book II of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guide_for_the_Perplexed\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Guide for the Perplexed</a></em> to the question of creation vs eternity. He essentially argued that nothing could be proven, but the arguments in favor of <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> are more plausible, and we accept it based on tradition. In Chapter 25 he explains how the Aristotelian view of an eternal universe is incompatible with Judaism, but the Platonic view of eternal matter can be compatible with Judaism, but both are rejected in any case due to lack of proof:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we were to accept the Eternity of the Universe as taught by Aristotle, that everything in the Universe is the result of fixed laws, that Nature does not change, and that there is nothing supernatural, we should necessarily be in opposition to the foundation of our religion, we should disbelieve all miracles and signs, and certainly reject all hopes and fears derived from Scripture, unless the miracles are also explained figuratively. The Allegorists amongst the Mohammedans have done this, and have thereby arrived at absurd conclusions. If, however, we accepted the Eternity of the Universe in accordance with the second of the theories which we have expounded above (ch. xxiii.), and assumed, with Plato, that the heavens are likewise transient, we should not be in opposition to the fundamental principles of our religion; this theory would not imply the rejection of miracles, but, on the contrary, would admit them as possible. The Scriptural text might have been explained accordingly, and many expressions might have been found in the Bible and in other writings that would confirm and support this theory. But there is no necessity for this expedient, so long as the theory has not been proved. As there is no proof sufficient to convince us, this theory need not be taken into consideration, nor the other one; we take the text of the Bible literally, and say that it teaches us a truth which we cannot prove; and the miracles are evidence for the correctness of our view. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp112.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Halevi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yehuda Halevi</a>, like Rambam asserts that philosophy can only take us so far in this question, and we ultimately submit to the superiority of our tradition. Like Rambam as well, he does not feel that creation from eternal matter would be in fundamental opposition to the religion.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> may have devoted the most attention to this issue. The entire Book VI of his <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milhamoth_ha-Shem#Milhamoth_ha-Shem_of_Levi_ben_Gershom,_14th_century\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Milchamot Hashem</a></em> is devoted to the question of creation. While he agreed with Rambam and R. Yehuda Helevi that creation from eternal matter is not fundamentally opposed to Judaism, he went much further. He himself believed and promoted this view, and claimed to have proven it; not only that, he argued that this was the view taught by the Torah, and that <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> and an eternal universe are both philosophically untenable. In the last chapter of part one of Book VI, he notes that all of his predecessors were wrong about this question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Finally, concerning creation of the universe we did not find in any of our predecessors a true philosophical account, other than what is found in the Torah by way of tradition. What we have found in Maimonides almost closes the door against this inquiry. For he advances a theory of creation that is clearly impossible [i.e. creation <em>ex nihilo</em>], and in addition declares that it is impossible for man to reach the truth on this topic by philosophical means. It is therefore quite marvelous that we have actually succeeded in solving these extremely profound problems and in eliminating all the doubts pertaining to them. It is proper, therefore, to give thanks to the Lord (may he be blessed) Who has revealed to us these marvelous and profound truths. May He be eternally blessed and exalted beyond all praise and blessing.

Judah Halevi's view is aptly summed up by Seymour Feldman in his introduction to his translation of Book VI of <em>Milchamot Hashem</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Indeed, whereas Yehudah Halevi confined himself to a cautious, conciliatory judgement that either hypothesis was acceptable from a religious point of view, and Maimonides suggested that although creation <em>ex nihilo</em> was the preferred doctrine from the point of view of tradition, the Platonic theory would be compatible with Scripture, Gersonides claims that the creation <em>ex nihilo</em> doctrine is absolutely false, indeed absurd.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As mentioned in my answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/86704/deviations-of-ralbag-from-normative-jewish-theology/88099#88099\">here</a> Ralbag's view of creation was one of the things that made him a \"radical\" Jewish thinker. Indeed, he was heavily criticized by later Jewish thinkers. </p>\n\n<p>Ralbag does, though, explicitly address your issue that the existence of eternal matter is akin to having multiple deities. In Chapter 18 of Part 1 of Book VI he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Third difficulty. It might be thought that if there were another eternal thing besides God, it would be a deity like Him. But this is an absolutely shameful [idea]. (<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=OK3XAAAAMAAJ&dq=wars%20of%20the%20lord%20seymour%20feldman&source=gbs_book_similarbooks\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Feldman translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reply to third objection. This objection is weak. It does not follow when we posit this body to be eternal that it is on the same level of being as God, so that it is divine like Him. For God is not divine because He is eternal and all other things are not. For even if it were possible that everything were eternal, God alone would be the deity, since He governs everything and gives them their law and order which they possess. In short, God is the deity precisely because of His great level [of perfection], from whose great wisdom and power emanate the beneficial order and rightness found in existent things. The eternal body, however, has no such features, but is utterly and essentially deprived of goodness. And it is the case that whatever attains a greater degree of goodness is therefore more noble; so that man is more noble than an animal and an animal is more noble than a plant. Accordingly, it is clear that this body is utterly defective, whereas God is absolutely perfect. Consequently, this body has no share in divinity at all; for it is farther away from divinity than anything else. And so this rhetorical objection has been removed. (<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=OK3XAAAAMAAJ&dq=wars%20of%20the%20lord%20seymour%20feldman&source=gbs_book_similarbooks\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Feldman translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasdai_Crescas\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Hasdai Crescas</a> devoted five chapters to creation in <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Or_Adonai\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ohr Hashem</a></em> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22063&st=&pgnum=286\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:1:1</a>. He briefly summarized Aristotle's, Rambam's, and Ralbag's arguments, and then laid out his own view that <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> is a fundamental tenet of Judaism. As he says in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22063&st=&pgnum=322\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the beginning of Chapter 5</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושהכפירה בו הריסה בשרשי התורה ואולם איננו יסוד ופינה שלא יצויר מציאות התורה זולתו</p>\n  \n  <p>And that denial of it is a destruction of the foundations of the Torah. However, it is not a foundation and a cornerstone without which the existence of the Torah cannot be conceived.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Albo\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yosef Albo</a> similarly argues in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34496&st=&pgnum=53\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chapter 12</a> of Part 1 of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Ikkarim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer HaIkkarim</a></em> that <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> is an obligatory belief, but he does not think it is fundamentally opposed to the Torah, and that is why Rambam did not count it in his listing of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_principles_of_faith#Maimonides'_13_principles_of_faith\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Thirteen Principles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From then on, <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> has been the basically entirely dominant Jewish view. For several hundred years, Jewish philosophy mostly fell by the wayside, and much of the thought of the \"rationalist <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/581/mi-yodeya-glossary/3718#3718\">rishonim</a>\" was largely ignored. Thus, today, this is the belief that is, to the best of my knowledge, taught in all (Orthodox) Jewish schools, and if you tell an average Jew that you believe in creation from eternal matter, or the eternity of the universe, you will likely be deemed a heretic.</p>\n\n<p>However, with the advent of modern academic Jewish studies, there is a cadre of people who have been rejuvenating the rationalist rishonim, and bringing some of their ideas back into the public Jewish arena. So, perhaps the tide will yet swing, and some of the other views of creation might gain more popularity (but probably not so likely).</p>\n\n<p>We would be remiss if we did not also mention the minority view of some scholars, that Rambam's advocacy of <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> is merely the exoteric reading of <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em>, while the true esoteric meaning is that Rambam actually agreed with the Aristotelian view of the eternity of the universe. As briefly summarized by Seymour Feldman in his introduction to his translation of Book VI of Milchamot Hashem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ever since the Middle Ages there has been an \"esoteric\" reading of <em>The Guide</em> according to which Maimonides' real doctrine is not creation ex nihilo — the \"exoteric teaching\" — but some form of the eternity theory. This was the interpretation of his medieval commentators Joseph ibn Kaspi and Moses Narboni; indeed, it was the interpretation of his translator Samuel ibn Tibbon. In recent years this reading of <em>The Guide</em> has been advocated by Leo Strauss and Shlomo Pines, the most recent translator of <em>the Guide</em> into English.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to briefly summarize: the majority position within Jewish tradition has apparently always been <em>creatio ex nihilo</em>. Rambam and R. Yehuda Halevi indicated that they would theoretically be okay with creation from eternal matter, while Ralbag went further and uniquely argued that creation from eternal matter is the only possibility. A small group perhaps even held some form of an eternal universe. The <em>ex nihilo</em> team largely seems to have won, and for the most part it is currently a dead issue. You are unlikely to find much current serious discussion of the various positions. Most people have simply accepted <em>ex nihilo</em> and moved on.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I will address three of your points mentioned in your question.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"G-d may have created this universe using a matter that existed before the \"beginning\"\" </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In his Guide of the Perplexed 2:25, Maimonides says that the Torah could be interpreted to be saying that G-d formed the world out of preexisting (eternal) matter. For example, it could be that bara, “created,” could be read as “formed,” and is to be read as, “In the beginning when G-d formed the heaven and the earth, [at that time] the earth was formless….” </p>\n\n<p>Although the matter is eternal, this view is not pantheism, nor does it dilute monotheism. G-d is separated from the matter because G-d is transcendental, meaning, G-d is separated from the world. He also might have created or formed the laws of nature and placed them in the world to act throughout eternality.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"G-d may have created and then destroyed other universes before creating the one in which we live...\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yes, some speculate that G-d created other cultures before the present one and destroyed them. There are many midrashim that invented all kinds of imaginative tales about it, a kind of science fiction. Take, for example, the Midrash Tehillim 90:13. This is one of many similar midrashim. Maimonides wrote in his essay called Chelek that people who take midrashim as saying the truth are fools, those who dismiss them entirely are also fools, because midrashim although not true were designed to teach lessons. They are parables.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"As for the possible \"allegorical\" sense of which Rambam speaks, I do not know what to think.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Most people are not aware that Rambam interpreted the six-day creation of the Genesis account to be allegorical. The universe was formed over the course of billions of years. G-d did not literally create the world in six days, He could have done so instantaneously, and the Rambam said that is what He did. Adam was not literally created from the soil or Eve from his rib. Adam had a father and a mother like you and me. The snake in the garden did not littery speak. Animals can not talk, for this is unnatural. The biblical story about the \"Garden of Eden\" story is a metaphor, a parable about morality vs intelligence and Rambam stresses for the use of the latter.</p>\n\n<p>It follows that creation is not ex nehilo, created from nothing. Because from nothing, you get nothing.</p>\n\n\n",

The third verse, which is attributed to \"the Writings,\" is from the Book of Ben Sira 13:17</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל רבא לרבה בר מרי מנא הא מילתא דאמרי אינשי מטייל ואזיל דיקלא בישא\n  גבי קינא דשרכי אמר ליה דבר זה כתוב בתורה שנוי בנביאים ומשולש בכתובים\n  ותנן במתניתין ותנינא בברייתא</p>\n  \n  <p>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter derived whereby\n  people say: A bad palm tree strolls and goes to be among a grove of\n  barren trees, i.e., bad people seek out other bad people? Rabba bar\n  Mari said to him: This matter is written in the Torah, repeated in the\n  Prophets, and triplicated in the Writings, and we learned it in a\n  mishna, and we learned it in a baraita.</p>\n  \n  <p>כתוב בתורה דכתיב (בראשית כח, ט) וילך עשו אל ישמעאל שנוי בנביאים דכתיב\n  (שופטים יא, ג) ויתלקטו אל יפתח אנשים רקים ויהיו עמו ומשולש בכתובים\n  דכתיב (בן סירא יג, יד) כל עוף למינו ישכון ובני אדם לדומה לו תנן במתני'\n  כל המחובר לטמא טמא כל המחובר לטהור טהור ותנינא בברייתא רבי אליעזר אומר\n  לא לחנם הלך זרזיר אצל עורב אלא מפני שהוא מינו</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabba bar Mari explains each of the sources. It is written in the\n  Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael” (Genesis 28:9).\n  It is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “And there were\n  gathered vain fellows to Yiftah, and they went out with him” (Judges\n  11:3). And it is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All\n  fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him (Book of Ben\n  Sira 13:17). We learned it in a mishna (Kelim 12:2): All that is\n  attached to that which is ritually impure is ritually impure; all that\n  is attached to that which is ritually pure is ritually pure. And we\n  learned it in a baraita: Rabbi Eliezer says: Not for naught did the\n  starling go to the raven but because it is its kind, as it too is a\n  non-kosher bird.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unlike Catholics and Orthodox Christians, Jews do not count the Book of Ben Sira as canonical Scripture.

    "content": "# Are dreidels supposed to be fair?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In math terms, dice are expected to be \"fair\": every face should have the same odds of coming up on a proper roll. Before dice existed, people used pastern bones (which is knucklebone from livestock).

I approach this question from the perspective of a dice collector who has a small number of dreidels. The dreidels are clearly \"not fair\", but I'm not sure if that is a defect, expected, or just tolerated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Weighted dice are unfair because someone may know which way they are weighted and take advantage.  No number on a die is better than any other all the time.  Which number you want depends on the game and on your position within the game.</p>\n\n<p>Dreidels are different.  The game is completely one of chance (there is no real use of strategy and, while the order of the rolls you get matters a bit, each turn is basically the same (yes, the pot can be bigger or smaller and you can be more or less desperate to get a good roll, but...)).</p>\n\n<p>The most important thing is that each side of the dreidel has the same meaning each time.  It's not like a die where getting a 6 in some cases is disastrous and other times 6 is the best and getting a 3 is the worst.  You either get the whole pot, half the pot, nothing, or you lose a coin.</p>\n\n<p>So if the dreidel is weighted, it is weighted the same for everyone.  Knowing how it's weighted will make no difference.</p>\n\n<p>So grab your coins (I'm partial to pennies but chocolate gelt is the modern tradition), all the children you can round up, and go play!</p>\n\n\n",

There is therefore nothing in the text that can make one think of a spiritual figure, arbitrarily translated as an \"angel\". The \"SAR\" is, modernly, the minister. In this case he is a border guard, someone appointed by Esav to protect the passage of the Yabbok and who engages with Yaacov a hand-to-hand fight, as it imposes a resistance to the attempt of these to return from head to Israel, to reaffirm the his command. There is nothing mystical about all this, but only a real war of hegemony.</p>\n<p>29 And he said, 'Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, for you have struggled with rulers and high-ranking people, and you have won'. \"</p>\n<p>Many translations report \"Why did you fight with God and with men and you won\", but this is not the meaning, as in the biblical language \"Elohim\" means \"rulers, legislators\" and is \"also\" used to indicate God. The same Rashì specifies that in this case the term is not \"kodesh\", that is  it is not sacred, it is not related to HaShem.</p>\n<p>The same goes for the term \"anashim\" which literally means \"men\", but which in the biblical language indicates \"high-ranking people\", \"prominent persons\" (in the same way as the three \"anashim\" who present themselves at Avraham)\nYaacov struggled with rulers and high-ranking people (Elohim and Anashim): that is, with Essav and with Lavan (traditionally considered the chief and the most powerful of all those who practiced the magical arts) and won.\nYaacov's name will now be \"Israel\" \"Ki sarita im elohim\", \"Because you dominated the rulers\" (\"Israel\" has the same root as \"sarita\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, I have read several Jewish interpretations of the event, and all  linked to the idea of \"theophanic\" nature, although according to different conceptions, but I have never heard of an exclusively \"human\" interpretation of this fighter.</p>\n<p>I would add that in all the translations of Jewish origin that I consulted, in Italian, English and Ancient Greek, the term \"Elohim\" in this passage is translated as \"God\" or \"angel of God\", and so also in the authoritative Targum Onkelos.</p>\n<p>We also read in Hosea 12,3-5:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now YH** has a contention with Judah, and to visit upon Jacob\naccording to his ways; according to his deeds He shall recompense\nhim.       In the womb, he seized his brother's heel, and with his\nstrength he strove with Elohim; He strove with an malach and\nprevailed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you know specific Jewish sources to support this thesis?</p>\n<p>I asked this gentleman, but I had no answer.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If the guy was just some punk Eisav hired to block Jacob's entry, Jacob wouldn't let have let him go in exchange for a blessing.

Eisav has nothing spiritual left to give him.</p>\n<p>If it was a man working for Eisav, it would have been safer for Jacob to alert his family and get assistance in killing him then leave him alive to reveal his location to Eisav.</p>\n<p>Then the guy tells him he struggled with God and Jacob confirms that he saw God when he named the place Peniel. The guy Jacob fought is obviously a spiritual being.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It seems that the words of the Orthodox Jew meant that the texts only uses the word <em>ish</em> - man in connection with the wrestler, not that it was a man. The commentaries assume that it was an angel, however human-like interpretations of the event are given to show, what Yaakov could have thought as the fight unraveled. Ultimately, as the fight is brought to its culmination, the angel reveals himself. For example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.77.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 77:2</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ḥunya said: He appeared to him in the image of a herdsman; this one had flocks and that one had flocks, this one had camels and that one had camels. He said to him: 'Cross yours and then I will cross mine.' Jacob crossed his. He said: 'Let us return and see, whether, perhaps, we forgot something.' When he returned, “a man wrestled with him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. Rabbi Ḥunya would like to say that since all posessions of Yaakov were transfered to the other side of the river, there was no reason to return. The fact that the <em>ish</em> suggested that Ya'akov do it - meant that <em>ish</em> was seeking a fight.</p>\n<p>Other Rabbis note that actually it is a good habit to check if one did not forget anything after such a big transfer. I.e. Yaakov did not need to be reminded about it. They give a story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ḥiyya Rabba and Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi were negotiating the sale of these silk fabrics. They entered Tyre and did their business. When they exited the city gates, they said: ‘Let us go and adopt the craft of our ancestors. Let us return and see if we forgot something.’ They returned and found a package of silk fabrics. They said to them: 'From where do you have this practice?' (The practice of returning to check if anything was left behind.) They said: 'From Jacob our ancestor, as it is written: “Jacob remained alone.”'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the Rabbis offer a different account of what prompted the fight:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbis say: He appeared to him as the leader of robbers; this one had flocks and that one had flocks, this one had camels and that one had camels. He said to him: 'Cross mine (To the other side of the river). and I will cross yours.' The angel crossed that of our patriarch Jacob in the blink of an eye. Jacob was crossing, returning, and finding, crossing, returning and finding all night. He said to him: 'Sorcerer' <em>parkamos</em>; [variant reading: <em>parmakos</em>. Rabbi Pinḥas said: At that moment, Jacob took a scarf and placed it around his (the angel’s) neck.

It would mean that they were\nraising the dust with their feet through their movements. I, however,\nam of opinion that is means “he fastened himself on”, and that it is\nan Aramaic word, as (Sanhedrin 63b) “after they have joined (אביקו)\nit\", and (Menachot 42a) “and he twined (the “Fringes”) with loops”. It\ndenotes “intertwining”, for such is the manner of two people who make\nstrong efforts to throw each other — one clasps the other and twines\nhimself round him with his arms.

The angel, Esau’s protective power,\nhad come to prevent Yaakov from escaping from Esau. He realised soon\nthat G-d’s assurances to Yaakov were strong enough to protect him\nagainst being harmed by Esau. (Rash’bam)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The difference between this approach and the Rambam's\ninvolves only the severity of the prohibition. Both agree that sexual\nrelations outside the context of marriage are forbidden. With regard\nto a pilegesh, a woman one designates as a sexual partner but who is\nnot consecrated as a wife, see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188348/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim 4:4</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this case therefore, Yehudah needed to find a woman whose profession was that of קְדֵשָה as only such a woman was <em>permitted</em> at that time.

Even though the\nPatriarchs - and presumably their families - observed the Torah before\nit was given, they did so <em>voluntarily</em>, so that it was conceivable\nthat where necessary they would act according to the laws that were\nobligatory at that time. Consequently if the Divine Plan required\nJudah to cohabit with a \"harlot\"he would be permitted to do so. [Cf.\nthe case of Jacob marrying two sisters which later Torah law would\nabsolutely forbid].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, once Yehudah attempted to find <em>consolation</em> in the arms of a woman, he could only do so by either marrying (which he felt was not yet proper) or hiring a professional woman. Anything else was forbidden to Bnai Noach at that time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe that the Tora points it out to stress out how desperate Tamar was, How neglecting Yehuda was and how courageous her deed was.</p>\n\n\n",

Then he notes that this is not surprising, since the term used for putting him into the pit, וישליכוהו, implies a distance of greater than twenty cubits, and one sees e.g. from the rules of Chanukah that people don't properly see that far. In fact, he notes, that rule about vision is the basis for the passage immediately before the one about the pit in <em>Shabas</em>. And that explains why the pit is brought in at that juncture: because the same basis underpins it as the preceding passage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Meshech_Hochma%2C_Vayeshev\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Meshech Chochma</em> (also ad loc.)</a> cites a midrash that says that Joseph recited the benediction \"…who performed a miracle for me here\" years later at the site of the pit. This, he says, is because even though his rise to power as viceroy of Egypt was also miraculous, it wasn't a supernatural miracle like being saved from snakes and scorpions, and the benediction is recited only on the latter. Likewise, we recite \"… who performed miracles for our ancestors…\" only for the Chanukah miracle of the oil, which was supernatural, and not for the miracle of winning the war. The rule that the menorah must be lit where people can easily see it, viz for publicizing the miracle, is related to the benediction, so the passage about Joseph and the pit comes right after that rule.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the significance of oil?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Shema Prayer (Hear o’ Israel the Lord is God and God is One) is considered Judaism’s declaration of faith in God. Deuteronomy 7:13, quoted from Chabad.org, reads “And He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your soil, your grain, your wine, and your oil, the offspring of your cattle and the choice of your flocks, in the land which He swore to your forefathers to give you”. </p>\n\n<p>Many of these blessings seem to have a link to Temple service, grain for the challah, oil for the Menorah and for anointing the Kohanim/Priests, wine for Kiddush, cattle for the sacrifices, etc. The blessings also seem to have a link to Israel as a nation including populating the land and feeding it. The one element I specifically question is the oil. What is the signifance of oil in terms of consumption or Temple service that it is a blessing? Wouldn’t water be symbolically appropriate for purifying the Kohanim instead of oil?  In a land “flowing with milk and honey” there has to be bees to produce that abundance of honey and if there are bees, there is bees wax that can be used to light the Temple menorah. Why is oil so essential that it is considered a blessing for the masses?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This paragraph of the Shema is a reminder of the \"blessing and the curse\" put forth in Parasha Haazinu. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/topics/Parshat%20Haazinu?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/topics/Parshat%20Haazinu?lang=bi</a></p>\n\n<p>Grain, cattle, fruit, grapes / wine and olives / olive oil were the mainstays of ancient Israel's economy. Hashem offers to bless His People financially if they keep to his ways, and famine, pestilence, and reliance on loans from resident foreigners if they don't keep His ways. That's an essential part of the Covenant. We say this as part of the Shema on a daily basis so as not to forget.</p>\n\n\n",

I have seen in a collection of Sefardi Halachot that it is certainly a good practice to eat foods that have oil.  The accepted practice in EY is to eat doughnuts on Chanuka.  People also make Potato Latkes.  However, this is also custom and traditional.</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan (670) brings a custom to have milky foods in remembrance of the event of Yehudis who killed a Greek General through giving him very salty cheese, and thus giving him wine to drink afterwards and making him drunk, at which point she severed his head.  The Aruch Hashulchan (670:8) mentions this episode, but suggests that this happened during the 2nd Beis Hamikdash period and is much later than thought to be.  It is certainly a matter of dispute over whether one should increase at your regular Seudah on Chanuka (see the Rama on 670, and Aruch Hashulchan 670:9).  </p>\n\n<p>None of the major Ashkenazi Poskim bring down this minhag of eating oily foods. Since this has become a widespread practice, it is certainly meritorious to do so.  However, many people find oily food to be sickening and one certainly should not over indulge or even eat oily food if it will make one sick.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your question: No, there is no Torah or rabbinic obligation to eat any oily foods.  </p>\n\n<p>That being said, if one's preference is simply the taste of these particular foods (rather than due to a legitimate health consideration, in which case you should not partake if it would make you genuinely ill), one should at least try to fulfill the custom in another way in which oil is used — for example a stir-fry or fried fish.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why would Yosef interpret the baker's dream for bad?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Brachos 56 brings various accounts about dreams and makes mention that a dream is based on the interpretation. </p>\n\n<p>Why would Yosef interpret the baker's dream for bad? Was his interpretation more of a prophecy which he had to say accurately or did he interpret the dream based off what he understood?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>After doing some research I found in the Malbim 41:9-10 which says that Yosef had Ruach Hakodesh to interpret the dreams of the cupbearer and master baker. The cupbearer had a more gross offense since he could have prevented the fly from being in the cup. However the master baker didn't know the stone was in the bread since he didn't bake, rather he just presented it. So the fact that Yosef said that the baker will be hanged proved that his words were divinely inspired.</p>\n\n<p>The Malbim in Parshas va'yeishiv explains that the way it worked was that the cupbearer had servants and the master baker had servants. So in reality based off a court case the cupbearer's offense was a lesser offense if we put guilt on the cupbearer's servants since a fly can jump into the wine at any moment, but if we put the guilt on the cupbearer himself than it is a very great offense since he is holding the cup the whole time. On the other hand, the master baker himself did a small offense since he could not have known about the rock, but his servants did a very serious offense. Based off this information, a regular court would find the cupbearer himself more guilty than the baker since he should have known better. However, the inside information Yosef received from HaShem is that the court will now punish the main ministers (cupbearer and baker) based off the actions of their servants, and the baker therefore is more culpable since his servants put a rock in the bread which is a terrible offence much worse than a fly.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems that Yosef was divinely inspired and explained the dream in a way which seems counter intuitive to the case. However, this itself gave credibility to Yosef' s ability when it came to interpreting Pharaoh's dream. </p>\n\n<p>Since it was done through Ruach Hakodesh Yosef would not change the interpretation. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I saw this in the Art Scroll Chumash this past Shabbat. I am going by memory, now. I'll try to edit in the sources, later, B\"N.</p>\n\n<p>The big difference is that the wine steward demonstrated that he dreamt that he was doing his job. He says things such as \"I squeezed the grapes and I gave Pharaoh the cup.\"</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the baker described how he wanted to do his job but was prevented because the birds ate the bread from the basket.</p>\n\n<p>That was probably a hint that Pharaoh would not allow him to continue doing his previous work.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>Two answers:</p>\n\n<p>1) the baker's dream was unequivocally bad. There was no plausibe good interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>2) one of Joseph's character flaws was that he liked to mess with people. He repeatedly taunted his brothers by prophesying how he will one day rule them and he would always tattle on them. He detained Shimon and Benjamin in disregard of how it would hurt his father. When viceroy of Egypt he used his advance knowledge to speculate on grain prices and reduce the entire population of Egypt to peonage rather than disburse the grain for humanitarian purposes. He had no consideration of the baker's emotions.</p>\n\n\n",

Yosef Albo?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <em>Sefer HaIkkarim</em> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34496&st=&pgnum=71\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:18</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Albo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Albo</a> writes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כמו שנזכר בבבא מציעא בענין מחלוקתו של רבי אליעזר שנעקר חרוב ממקומו וחזר אמת המים לאחוריו וזולת זה ואף על פי כן לא קבעו הלכה כדבריו לפי שלא היה מוסכם בנביא</p>\n<p>As is mentioned in Bava Metzia regarding the dispute of R. Eliezer, where a carob tree was uprooted, a spring of water flowed backwards, and other such things, yet even so they did not set the law like his words because he was not accepted as a prophet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The implication of this statement would seem to be that if R. Eliezer <em>had</em> been a prophet then the law would have been decided in his favor.</p>\n<p>However, this goes against a fundamental rule of prophecy explained by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=1&perek=9&halocha=4&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 9:4</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן אם עקר דבר מדברים שלמדנו מפי השמועה או שאמר בדין מדיני תורה שה' צוה לו שהדין כך הוא והלכה כדברי פלוני הרי זה נביא השקר ויחנק אף על פי שעשה אות שהרי בא להכחיש התורה שאמרה לא בשמים היא</p>\n<p>Similarly, if [a \"prophet\"] nullifies a concept which was transmitted by the oral tradition, or states with regard to one of the Torah's laws that God commanded him to render such and such a judgment, or that such and such is the law regarding a particular instance and the decision follows a certain opinion, he is a false prophet and should be [executed by] strangulation. [This applies] even if he performs a wonder, for he is coming to deny the Torah, which states: \"It is not in the heavens.\" (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904993/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Nine.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the introduction to his <em>Commentary to the Mishnah</em>, Rambam explains this in much greater detail. Specifically, he discusses the exact instance of a dispute between sages where one of them is a prophet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובזה בלבד נבדל הנביא משאר בני אדם בתורה אבל בעיון ובדין ובחקירה בדיני התורה הרי הוא כשאר החכמים הדומים לו שאינם נביאים ואם יפרש איזה פירוש ויפרש מי שאינו נביא פירוש אחר ויאמר הנביא אמר לי ה' כי פירושי הוא הנכון אין שומעין לו אלא אפילו אלף נביאים שכולם כאליהו ואלישע פירשו איזה פירוש ואלף חכמים וחכם פירשו היפך אותו הפירוש אחרי רבים להטות ועושים כדברי האלף חכמים וחכם לא כדברי האלף נביאים המופלגים וכך אומרים חז\"ל האלהים אלו אמרה לי יהושע בן נון בפומיה לא הוה ציתנא ליה ולא שמענא מניה ואמרו עוד אם יבוא אליהו ויאמר חולצין במנעל שומעין בסנדל אין שומעין לו כוונתם בכך שאין תוספת וגרעון בתורה מצד הנבואה בשום פנים וכן אם אמר הנביא שה' אמר לו כי הפסק במצוה פלונית כך ושדינו של פלוני הוא הנכון הרי אותו הנביא נהרג לפי שהוא נביא שקר כמו שביארנו לפי שאין תורה אחרי השליח הראשון ואין תוספת ואין גרעון לא בשמים היא ולא המחנו ה' אל הנביאים אלא המחנו אל החכמים בעלי הדין לא אמר ובאת אל הנביא אלא אמר ובאת אל הכהנים הלוים ואל השופט וכבר האריכו חכמים בענין זה מאד מאד והוא הנכון <br>(Kafih translation)</p>\n<p>And in this alone differentiates a prophet from other men in Torah, but in analysis and application and investigation of the laws of the Torah he is like other sages who are similar to him who are not prophets. And if he propounds an explanation, and someone who is not a prophet propounds a different explanation, and the prophet says \"God told me that my explanation is correct\" we don't listen to him. Even if there are 1,000 prophets all of whom are like Elijah and Elisha who propound an explanation, and there are 1,001 sages who explain it oppositely, we follow the majority and we act in accordance with the words of the 1,001 sages, not in accordance with the words of the 1,000 outstanding prophets. And so said the Sages: \"By God! [Even] if Joshua son of Nun had said this to me with his own mouth I would not accepted it and I would not listen to him.\" And they said further: \"If Elijah would come and say that we do <em>chalitza</em> with a shoe, we would listen to him; [if he would say that we do <em>chalitza</em>] with a sandal, we wold not listen to him.\" Their point with this is that there is no adding to or subtracting from the Torah in any form by way of prophecy. And similarly if a prophet says that God told him that the ruling in a certain commandment is such, and that the law of So-and-So is correct, that prophet is killed because he is a false prophet, as we have explained. Because there is no Torah after the original messenger, and there is no adding or subtracting; it is not in heaven.  And god did not assign us to the prophets, but he assigned us to the sages the masters of derivation; He did not say \"and you shall come to the prophet\", but He said \"and you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and the judge\". And the Sages have already elaborated on this matter very very much, and it is correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does R. Yosef Albo disagree with this fundamental idea? Or is there another explanation of what he wrote?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Whether a navi can clarify a disputed halachah seems to be a machlokes rishonim.

Various answers have been given for why Rashi does not contradict the principle of לא בשמים היא (see, e.g., R. Moshe Leib Shachor, <em>Bigdei Kehudah</em>, p. 275f. R. Kook, <em>Iggerot ha-Raayah</em>, I, p. 123f., sees this as a general machlokes between two approaches, that of Eretz Yisrael and of chutz la'aretz, whether divine inspiration has a place in deciding halachah.) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%91%D7%9C_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95_%D7%90_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chevel Nachalato</a> 1:2 quotes these sources, including R.

Whenever anyone's belief is based on wonders, [the commitment of] his heart has shortcomings, because it is possible to perform a wonder through magic or sorcery.</p>\n  \n  <p>All the wonders performed by Moses in the desert were not intended to serve as proof [of the legitimacy] of his prophecy, but rather were performed for a purpose. It was necessary to drown the Egyptians, so he split the sea and sank them in it. We needed food, so he provided us with manna. We were thirsty, so he split the rock [providing us with water]. Korach's band mutinied against him, so the earth swallowed them up. The same applies to the other wonders.</p>\n  \n  <p>What is the source of our belief in him? The [revelation] at Mount Sinai. Our eyes saw, and not a stranger's. Our ears heard, and not another's. There was fire, thunder, and lightning. He entered the thick clouds; the Voice spoke to him and we heard, \"Moses, Moses, go tell them the following:....\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, [Deuteronomy 5:4] relates: \"Face to face, God spoke to you,\" and [Deuteronomy 5:3] states: \"God did not make this covenant with our fathers, [but with us, who are all here alive today].\"</p>\n  \n  <p>How is it known that the [revelation] at Mount Sinai alone is proof of the truth of Moses' prophecy that leaves no shortcoming? [Exodus 19:9] states: \"Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people will hear Me speaking to you, [so that] they will believe in you forever.\" It appears that before this happened, they did not believe in him with a faith that would last forever, but rather with a faith that allowed for suspicions and doubts. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904992/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Eight.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am trying to figure out what the qualitative difference is between what happened at Sinai and any of the other wonders mentioned. The only things mentioned here that happened at Sinai are that \"we\" saw and heard thunder, lightning, Moshe entering the clouds, and a voice speaking to Moshe.</p>\n\n<p>This does not appear to be qualitatively different from a regular miracle. In fact I'm not even sure it sounds <em>quantitatively</em> different from the other miracles. Moshe split the sea, brought food from the sky, produced water from a rock, and opened the earth. He also walked into clouds accompanied by thunder, lightning, and fire, and we heard a voice. </p>\n\n<p>Rambam's point here is that miracles are not sufficient proof because one could argue that the miracles were somehow done by man himself and are not really from God. So if an onlooker would think that Moshe somehow split the sea, rained food from the sky, drew water from a rock, and split the earth on his own, why couldn't they think that he had produced the thunder, lightning, fire, and voice at Sinai on his own?</p>\n\n<p>What was it about the events at Sinai that proved that it was a divine revelation and not merely another miracle?</p>\n\n<p>Some people will undoubtedly answer that the difference is that at Sinai the people actually <em>experienced</em> the prophetic revelation as opposed to the other cases where they merely <em>witnessed</em> the miracles. Indeed this seems to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Albo\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yosef Albo</a>'s understanding of this point in <em>Sefer HaIkkarim</em> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34496&st=&pgnum=73\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1:18</a>. However, even if we were to grant that experiencing a prophetic revelation is qualitatively different from witnessing a miracle, in that a prophet somehow knows with certainty that he is prophesying (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11546/how-and-when-does-a-prophet-know-that-its-god-whos-speaking-to-him\">which itself is a question</a>), I don't think it would help us here. Rambam himself in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> explains at length that what the masses experienced at Sinai was <em>not</em> prophecy; indeed he writes that it is impossible for people who don't have the prerequisites of prophecy to prophesy. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 2:32</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We hold that fools and ignorant people are unfit for this distinction. It is as impossible for any one of these to prophesy as it is for an ass or a frog; for prophecy is impossible without study and training; when these have created the possibility, then it depends on the will of God whether the possibility is to be turned into reality. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp119.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As to the revelation on Mount Sinai, all saw the great fire, and heard the fearful thunderings, that caused such an extraordinary terror; but only those of them who were duly qualified were prophetically inspired, each one according to his capacities. Therefore it is said, \"Come up unto the Lord, thou and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu.\" Moses rose to the highest degree of prophecy, according to the words, \"And Moses alone shall come near the Lord.\" Aaron was below him, Nadab and Abihu below Aaron, and the seventy elders below Nadab and Abihu, and the rest below the latter, each one according to his degree of perfection. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp119.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 2:33</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>IT is clear to me that what Moses experienced at the revelation on Mount Sinai was different from that which was experienced by all the other Israelites, <strong>for Moses alone was addressed by God</strong>, and for this reason the second person singular is used in the Ten Commandments; Moses then went down to the foot of the mount and told his fellow-men what he had heard. Comp., \"I stood between the Lord and you at that time to tell you the word of the Lord\" (Deut. v. 5). Again, \"Moses spake, and God answered him with a loud voice\" (Exod. xix. 19). In the Mechilta our Sages say distinctly that he brought to them every word as he had heard it. Furthermore, the words, \"In order that the people hear when I speak with thee\" (Exod. xix. 9), show that <strong>God spoke to Moses, and the people only heard the mighty sound, not distinct words</strong>. It is to the perception of this mighty sound that Scripture refers in the passage, \"When ye hear the sound\" (Deut. v. 20); again it is stated, \"You heard a sound of words\" (ibid. iv. 12), and it is not said \"You heard words\"; and even where the hearing of the words is mentioned, only the perception of the sound is meant. <strong>It was only Moses that heard the words</strong>, and he reported them to the people. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp120.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus it seems that according to Rambam himself, the regular people only heard a sound. So in what sense is this different from other miracles? Here they witnessed a miraculous sound, and elsewhere they witnessed other miraculous phenomena. On what basis, then, does Rambam maintain that the revelation at Sinai was qualitatively different from other wonders, such that the former is a proof to Moshe being the messenger of God while the latter is not?</p>\n\n<p>(I am aware of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/59951/how-do-we-know-that-the-revelation-at-sinai-was-not-a-magicians-trick\">this related question</a>, but I do not believe it is a duplicate. That question is simply asking how we know the revelation at Sinai wasn't a trick. My question is how Rambam distinguishes the believability of the revelation at Sinai from the believability of other miracles. Indeed, the answers to the other question would not work according to my portrayal of Rambam here. I am also aware of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/67814/how-would-the-splitting-of-the-sea-have-been-done-with-magic-if-magic-is-just-tr\">this related question</a>, but that one only asks how magic could be faked according to Rambam, not what the difference was between the revelation at Sinai and other miracles.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The miracles of the Exodus were ones the Jews saw or heard.  In a way, as if it were a performance and they were the (participating) audience.  The miracles were all real things, to be sure. The Jews walked through the Red Sea, drank the water, and ate the manna.  People swallowed up by the earth died and stayed dead.</p>\n\n<p>All experience of the miracles came through the senses.  Sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch.  These must have been powerful experiences to witness.  All the more so because their very survival depended on them.</p>\n\n<p>When I think of the revelation of Torah, I don't imagine the way my senses might have experienced it.  For sure there was heat from the fire and trembling from the earth, strange smells, tastes on the air, noises, voices, light.  But there was something more.  Something missing from the other miracles.</p>\n\n<p>I don't necessarily have words for it (which is perhaps part of what makes it different).  It is the Holy Spirit, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit_in_Judaism\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ruach hakodesh</a>.  The very presence of the divine inside us.  The Shekhinah. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"And it was on the day that Moses had finished\" (Numbers 7:1). Rabbi\n  Yehoshua ben Levi said, \"The Holy One, blessed be He, made conditions\n  with Israel before they left Egypt, that He would not take them out,\n  except on condition that they make a tabernacle and that He would have\n  His Divine Presence dwell upon them, as it is written (Exodus 29:46),\n  'And they shall know that I am the Lord, your God, who took you out of\n  the Land of Egypt, to have Me dwell among you.'\" And once the\n  tabernacle was erected, the Divine Presence descended and dwelt among\n  them. At that time all of those conditions were fulfilled. Hence it is\n  written (Numbers 7:1), \"the tabernacle,\" to [indicate] that the Holy\n  One, blessed be He, did what He stipulated. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nasso.22.1?vhe=Midrash_Tanchuma_--_Torat_Emet&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma Nasso,\n  Siman 22</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another quotation from\n  early third century says: \"On that day a thing came about which had\n  never existed since the Creation of the world. From the creation of\n  the world and up to that hour the Shekhina had never dwelt among the\n  lower beings. But from the time that the Tabernacle was erected, she\n  did dwell among them.\" Another tradition claimed that she had always\n  dwelt among her people, but their sins drove her, on and off, into\n  Heaven. However, she was drawn back to her children and tried to save\n  them, over and over. (<a href=\"https://pantheon.org/articles/s/shekhina.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ref</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can imagine the Shekhinah preparing to dwell among the Israelites as they left Egypt.  The travelers put their hearts and souls into building the Mishkan.  Why would they have done it so enthusiastically (so much so that <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9897#v=5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moses had to turn away the precious metals and gems they brought</a>) had they not known what it was for?  Had they not a taste of what it meant for G-d to be in their midst?</p>\n\n<p>Whether it was the Shekhinah or another manifestation of G-d bringing Jews the revelation of Torah, it was far more powerful than a mere miracle.  Every person there, whether born Jewish or not, whether a child or adult, whether simple or learned, would have <em>felt</em> the presence of G-d.</p>\n\n<p>This is not something our mere senses can explain.  The sights and sounds would have been awe-inspiring, but they were a mere fraction of what occurred.  <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881/jewish/Chapter-20.htm#v=15\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The people were terrified</a>. This was an event that changes people.  Not something they saw or tasted or walked through.  Something they <em>became.</em></p>\n\n\n",

Each day‘s  sacrifices varied on Succos; each day’s candles are different one to the next. In that respect Hallel is also completed on Chanukah like Succos. As I wrote in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan,_Orach_Chaim.670.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">670:5,</a> on account of the decrees, they couldn’t bring the Succos sacrifices, so Chanukah was established in place [at that time]. Therefore full Hallel is said just like on Succos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בחנוכה גומרין את ההלל, משום דבכל יום נעשה בו נס בפך השמן. ועוד: דבכל יום חלוק בנרותיו, לפי המהדרין מן המהדרין, והוי כסוכות שחלוקים בקרבנות וגומרין את ההלל. ועוד: שהרי קורים בנשיאים, ובכל יום נשיא של יום זה חלוק משל חבירו. אם כן כל נשיא צריך לגמור ההלל על קרבנותיו (בית יוסף). ועוד: דכפי מה שכתבתי בסימן תרע, עשו שמונה ימי חנוכה תחת ימי הסוכות, שלא עשאו אז. וממילא דגומרין את ההלל כבחג הסוכות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Beit Yosef 683:</strong></em></p>\n<p>Since each day’s amount of lights is different than the last, in that respect it is like Succos which has separate sacrifices each day [and has complete Hallel]. Also, since we read one of the <em>princes</em> each day, and each one needs to complete the Hallel for his sacrifice, it wouldn’t be right to have a different reading and not read the [whole] Hallel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל ח' ימי חנוכה גומרים את הלל בפ\"ב דערכין (י:) מימרא דר' יוחנן משום ר\"ש בן יהוצדק וכתוב בשבלי הלקט שהטעם משו' דחלוק בנרותיו כל יום חלוק משלפניו הרי הוא כחג שחלוק בקרבנותיו ועוד טעם אחר לפי שהנס נתחדש בכל יום ועוד שהרי קוראים בנשיאי' ובכל יום נשיא שלו חלוק משל חבירו אם כן כל נשיא צריך לגמור ההלל על קרבנותיו ואין ראוי לחדש קריאה בלא קריאת ההלל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Yose holds that carcasses of orangutans (and maybe other great apes as well?) have some of the same laws of impurity as human corpses (and which do not apply to other animals) owing to their physiological similarities.

Afterwards, they met in privacy, in the same country, while his\n  love for her and physical power still persisted, and nevertheless, he\n  abstained and did not transgress. This is a complete Baal-Teshuvah.\n  This was implied by King Solomon in his statement [Ecclesiastes 12:1]\n  \"Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, [before the bad days\n  come and the years draw near when you will say: `I have no desire for\n  them.'\"]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Edit- added later.</p>\n\n<p>The answer did not specifically address the part of the the question relating to non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding non-Jews <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4134855/jewish/You-Will-Return-to-the-Lord-Your-G-d-The-Commandment-of-Teshuvah.htm#footnoteRef60a4134855\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this Chabad article</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>…... non-Jews can and must perform teshuvah. </p>\n  \n  <p>We explained that there is a basic level of teshuvah, which is simply\n  the decision to not sin again.

If they have sinned, they must make efforts to change\n  their ways and desist from sinning in the future. Indeed, by doing so\n  they may spare themselves from punishment, as was the case with the\n  people of Nineveh. They are not, however, afforded the special\n  opportunity to rectify the past through regret and confession, thereby\n  wiping the slate clean. According to this approach, this more complete\n  form of teshuvah is reserved for the Jewish people only. This\n  distinction can be understood based on an explanation given by Rabbi\n  Moshe Di Trani, in his work Beit Elokim: Since Jews have six hundred\n  and thirteen mitzvot, it is expected that at times Jews will succumb\n  to sin. Non-Jews, on the other hand, only need to observe seven\n  mitzvot and as such are expected not to fail in their observance in\n  the first place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite that, the author writes in an answer to a question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>…... it is possible that Righteous gentiles actually fall in the same\n  category as Jews with regard to Teshuva and can also reach the higher\n  level of teshuva which wipes the slate clean.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the non-Jew must try to change and stop sinning in the future.

So a Jew can [theoretically] fix his misdeed by doing Teshuva (described in Rambam for example), but a non-Jew that sinned has no such option.</p></li>\n<li><p>Both Jews and non-Jews can decide to stop sinning in the future, but this does not annulate what's already done per se.</p></li>\n<li><p>Even for Jews, for such a serious sin, a simple regret is not enough, Yom Kippur AND suffering are requiered also, and non-Jews don't have Yom Kippor.

Nathan the Prophet tells King David that he did a horrible thing to take away Batsheva from her husband, Uriah. Now in our tradition, it may not have been technically \"adultery\"; men going off to war often signed divorce papers in case they were never heard from again. But still -- if they had an understanding that they would be a couple if he came back alive, then for David to exploit that is absolutely wrong.</p>\n\n<p>As for whether it is technically \"adultery\"? Basically we fall back on the Noahide definition of marriage (i.e. what applies to non-Jews) ... which is a little vague precisely because it does not depend on any ritual or outsiders.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam, Marriages 1:1 writes that before the Torah was given (i.e. what was and is the law for non-Jews), \"a man and woman could meet in the street, agree to wed, go home and have relations in private, and that's it -- husband and wife.\" Similarly in his Laws of Kings 9:12 he writes that if a non-Jewish man tells his wife -- <em>get out, you're on your own</em>, or if she just walks out the door on her own, she is now divorced -- no ceremony required -- and allowed to go find another man.</p>\n\n<p>So short answer -- if the \"boyfriend/girlfriend\" couple still went home to their respective houses every night, they probably weren't considered to be married. If they shared a house ... well I would strongly assume that if they've been in such an arrangement for decades, had children, shared property, and it generally looked like \"common-law marriage\", just without papers -- well Jewish law would view them as married, papers or no papers. </p>\n\n<p>As far as where exactly in-between would it be called marriage ... it's hard to say.

If either of them has no such intention this does not count a marriage at all no matter how long it lasts and how many kids they have. The very status of \"in relations\" or \"being friends\" says \"no intention to marry\".</p>\n<p>If they call it a friendship - they treat it as a friendship, not marriage. If everybody knows that their relationships are a \"friendship\" they are not married. Once they start to call each other husband/wife - we'll rethink it all. A friend means there's no responsibility to one another - Marriage means responsibility!</p>\n<p>This is the reason they have <strong>a ceremony in which they both express their intention to marry</strong>.

The \"problem\" is that you are thinking of \"dew\" as the common liquid form that you see during the spring and summer, mainly. That's commonly called \"dew\". You need to think a bit more broadly. Wikipedia says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dew is water in the form of droplets that appears on thin, exposed\n  objects in the morning or evening due to condensation. As the\n  exposed surface cools by radiating its heat, atmospheric moisture\n  condenses at a rate greater than that at which it can evaporate,\n  resulting in the formation of water droplets. </p>\n  \n  <p>When temperatures are low enough, dew takes the form of ice; this form\n  is called frost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, frost is actually dew that freezes on contact with the cold surface. (Technically, dew can also freeze in the air - what's sometimes called \"frozen fog\".)</p>\n\n<p>If you're a farmer or even just a home plant grower, you know how damaging frost is to plants and herbage. In Israel, I'm sure that if frost develops while produce is growing, it is far from a <em>bracha</em> as this causes significant damage to a huge crop field and farmers can suffer major financial loss overnight.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Alex's answer is more <em>lomdishe</em> as it provides a direct Talmudic citation. So, consider my answer as a \"subset\". Clearly, frost or rime are types of dew that do <strong>not</strong> cause plants to grow. Worse - it kills the ones that are growing.

Aside from the astronomical and cosmological issues discussed by Rambam,\n  Ralbag, Rav Hirsch and Rav Kook, there are a number of instances where the Scriptures,\n  according to traditional and scholarly interpretation, conflict with modern science.<sup>56</sup>\n  While traditionalists struggle to reinterpret these verses and fit them into modern\n  science, the principle of “the Torah speaks in the language of men” as utilized by the\n  aforementioned authorities, while not without its own difficulties, renders these\n  reinterpretations unnecessary.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>56. Thus, as well as the inconsistency between the Genesis account of the age and development of the\n  universe, the geocentric description of the universe, and the description of the firmament being a flat, firm\n  structure, <strong>there is also the description of dew descending from the heavens</strong> and the descriptions of the hare\n  and hyrax as ruminants.</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Moshe Cordovero of blessed memory was the author, and he attributed it to R. Shimon Bar Yochai (his merit should protect us) because [R. Shimon Bar Yochai] hid in a cave for 13 years, as is known in the Talmud. And I recall that the genius R. Yaakov Emden of blessed memory was asked about this and he responded that he is unable to reach a conclusion, but the book is filled with good things whoever the author may be, but  the hands of strangers have ruled over it and struck it with a sharp knife and removed and added [to it], end quote.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, all who engage in kaballah attribute all their wisdom to it, and from it they draw all their traditions, and originally their name for it was \"The Midrash of R. Shimon Bar Yochai\", just like \"The Pirkei of R. Eliezer\". And then in order to endear it to the people and to spread it in Israel they changed its name to \"The Book of the Zohar\", referencing the verse (Daniel Chapter 12) \"And the wise ones will shine like the shining of the sky etc.\". And then others came and added on the appellation \"Holy\" to it, in order to add endearment to its endearment, just like they added the appellation \"Holy\" to the book of the Shelah and the Ohr Hachaim on the Torah and man others, in order to increase their value to the people, so that they would read them and buy them, or both. And similarly they appellated the Chevrah Kadisha in order to endear it beyond all other groups. As opposed to the Tanach and the Talmud and the Midrash, which were always dear and holy in the eyes of the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps for the same reason kabbalistic answers are specifically called \"the truth\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Recently, a friend showed me a <em>maareh mekomos</em> sheet that he made. One of his footnotes reads as follows: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a הספד for Rav Moshe Shapiro Zt'l in the Mir, Rav Aharon Lopiansky explained that the reason why the Ramban refers to <em>penimiyus HaTorah</em> as the \"<em>derech haemes</em>\" is because all other forms of תורה are describing periphery details about the ענינים .\n  They are ancillary to the core truth, they describe details around the center point, but not the center point itself.\n  Whereas <em>penimiyus HaTorah</em> goes straight to the core and describes the center point.

Didn't they all have to feed their donkeys? Or if they all opened their bags, why did only one of them find the money? Was his money stored higher in the bag, or something? Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The question becomes even more complex when we examine Ber. 43: 19-21:</p>\n\n<h2><strong>\"So they drew near the man who was over Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the entrance of the house. And they said, \"Please, my lord, we came down at first to purchase food. And it came to pass when we came to the lodging place that we opened our sacks, and behold! each man's money was in the mouth of his sack, and we returned it in our hands.\"</strong></h2>\n\n<p>According to the OP's quote of Ber. 42:26-35, only one brother opened his sack in the hotel. The others emptied their sacks when they reached home and only discovered that each brother's money had been returned when they got home.</p>\n\n<p>According to the way they later presented the facts to the one over Joseph's house, they claimed that they all noticed the returned funds at the inn; <strong>NOT</strong> when they reached home??</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rashi tells us (see Gen. 42:27) that the one brother who opened his sack in the hotel and discovered the money, was in fact Levi.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"The one opened: That was Levi, who was left alone, without Shimon, his companion.\" — [from Gen. Rabbah]</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Medrash Bereishis Rabbah 70:7</strong>, also tells us that Yaakov Avinu designated Levi as the holy one of his children. (This was to fulfill giving Maaser (Tithe) on his children as well as his possessions.) </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Levi was the first Priest designated as \"especially holy\" in his family. He would be the one to pray and learn Torah all day, while his brothers would support him. (similar to how later generations gave Terumah and Maaser to the Priests and Levites)</p>\n\n<p>If so, then when the brothers came down to Egypt, Levi did not bring money. His brothers took extra money which they gave to Levi, upon their arrival in the grain markets of Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>IOW, when Levi picked out his purchases, the brothers would have simply handed Levi the amount needed, and then Levi paid with his brothers' donation.</p>\n\n<p>The brothers themselves, had brought surplus travel funds, kept in their bags.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when Joseph's Egyptian servants were sneaking money back into each pack, they put money into 9 bags that had other money inside; and they put money into Levi's bag which held no money inside.</p>\n\n<p>So when Levi opened his bag, he saw money where there should have been none at all. So, he exclaimed that his cash was returned!</p>\n\n<p>The other brothers at the hotel, were not phased that the same was done to their bags, because each of them took lots of surplus money with them on the trip just in case. So, when they also opened their bags to feed their animals, the sight of money did not surprise them, as they knew they were each carrying lots of change.</p>\n\n<p>However, when they all reached home and \"emptied out\" their bags, they realized then that they each had too much money! So now they all knew that the money they saw back at the inn was in fact extra and had been returned as well (in addition to Levi's find).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when they returned and spoke to the overseer of Joseph's home, they presented the story that \"all of them\" had found their money returned in the hotel, based on hindsight.</p>\n\n<p>(They now knew that the money they saw at the hotel was in fact extra and when speaking about it now, referred to its sighting as occurring earlier in the hotel and not later at home.)</p>\n\n<p>This now explains any contradictions or difficulties in the verses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SOURCE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>About ten years ago, I was discussing this question with Rabbi Lisker who lives near me in Kensington, Brooklyn, NY. He has a Shul and Kollel which we call \"Lisker's\".</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Lisker researched the issue and came up with the above \"Chiddushei Torah\" to explain the right answer.</p>\n\n<p>I feel his chiddush has the ring of truth, so I like to say this over as a vort. This Shabbos alone I probably taught it about 7 times. :)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A couple of commentaries address this issue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> explains that Joseph deliberately had the money of all the other brothers hidden deep in their bags, so even though presumably everyone opened their bags during the journey, only one brother found the money:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כן צוה יוסף שלאחד מהם ישימו כספו בפי אמתחתו ולאחרים באמצע האמתחת או בתחתיתו שאם ישימו כספם בפי האמתחת כולם בלקחם מספוא לחמוריהם יראו וישובו למצרים על דבר הכסף להשיבו ולהודיע כי לא פשעו בו כי הם נתנוהו לפיכך צוה יוסף לשים הכסף באמצע האמתחת כדי שלא ירגישו בכסף עד היותם בביתם אבל צוה לשים לאחד מהם בפי אמתחתו כדי לצערם וידע כי בעבור כסף של אחד לא ישובו למצרים</p>\n<p>Thus commanded Joseph, that to one of them they should place his money in the mouth of his sack, and to the others [they should place the money] in the middle of the sack or at the bottom [of the sack]. For if they would place their money in the mouth of the sack, all of them would see [the money] when taking provender for their donkeys, and they would return to Egypt on account of the money to return it and to make known that they had not sinned with it, for they were given it. Therefore Joseph commanded to place the money in the middle of the sack[s] in order that they should not feel the money until they were back in their houses. But he commanded to place [the money] for one of them in the mouth of his sack in order to torment them, and he knew that the would not return to Egypt on account of the money of [just] one of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>, on the other hand, explains that in fact only one brother needed to open his bag during the journey:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אחד מהם פתח את שקו במלון לתת ממנו מספוא לחמורו והאחרים לא פתחו את שקיהם עד היותם עם אביהם כאשר אמר ויהי הם מריקים כי אולי היו האחרים לוקחים לחמוריהם תבן כי לא יאכלו כל משאם בדרך וזה האחד לא היה חמורו חזק והוצרך למספוא ומצא כספו בפי אמתחתו</p>\n<p>One of them opened his sack at the inn, to take from it provender for his donkey. And the others did not open their sacks until they were with their father, as it says \"and it was when they emptied their sacks\". [The reason why only one of the brothers opened his sack is that] perhaps the others took straw for their donkeys in order to not consume everything they were carrying during the journey, but this one's donkey was not strong and needed provender, and he [thus] found his money in the mouth of his sack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Caspi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Kaspi</a> has a comment about this as well, which may be relevant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין צורך שיזכיר למה פתח האחד לבדו ומי היה זה ואנחנו נוכל לסבור בזה כמה סברות</p>\n<p>There is no need to mention why only one opened, and who it was, and we can explain this in many ways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This remark might be implying that the entire question is invalid because the Torah contains little detail about this incident, and doesn't need to contain any more detail, and therefore there can be any number of possible explanations. If so, we might even be able to say that everyone opened their bags on the journey but it was simply unnecessary for the Torah to mention it — especially if all the other brothers opening their bags was only prompted by the first brother finding the money. When they were telling it over to Jacob, all the brothers emptied their sacks, so the Torah may have simply noted it that way.</p>\n<p>However, in his commentary to 43:21 Ibn Kaspi goes the opposite way. When the verse there says that the brothers told Joseph that all of them opened their sacks at the inn, <em>that</em> was the imprecision:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה אמרם והנה כסף איש בפי אמתחתו היה אמת וכן היה אמת כי באנו אל המלון ואולם יש עיון באמרם ונפתחה את אמתחותנו כי לא פתח במלון רק האחד מהם והאחרים לא פתחו עד בואם הביתה אבל אין אומרו ונפתחה את אמתחֹותינו מחויב שהיה במלון כן לכולם והם רצו לקצר</p>\n<p>And behold, their statement \"and behold the money of each man was in his sack\" was true, and [their statement] \"when we came to the inn\" was also true.

    "title": "\"Practicalities\" of the Egyptian famine",
    "content": "# \"Practicalities\" of the Egyptian famine\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>B\"H, most of us have not witnessed a famine. So, I hope you will excuse my lack of understanding what actually occurred during the famine mentioned in parshat <em>Miketz</em>. I understand a famine to mean that people are starving or they have an insufficient amount of food.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are two aspects that seem to contradict the idea that people would have nothing to eat:</p>\n\n<p>1) The Nile was abundant with fish. And, the Egyptians could have used their animals (somewhat) for food. Would that have been insufficient?</p>\n\n<p>2) Ya'akov and his children had an abundance of cattle and flock. Also, Ya'akov was an expert in sheep and goat mating, as we see in parshat Vayetze. Would using their animals not have sufficed?</p>\n\n<p>3) Ya'akov tells his children to bring down to Egypt some produce such as nuts and almonds. Perhaps, Israel was producing other types of produce as well. Could they not have survived on these items?</p>\n\n<p>In short, in what way was it a famine in the sense that people were hungry or starving?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In parshat Miketz, the example of the lack of food is shown in the poor harvest of grain (the common translation of \"corn\" doesn't refer to the New World grain corn (maize) but rather any grain, or sometimes specific local grains).  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Grain is the staple food for people in those times.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>If grain is all that is missing, sure, you can eat other things.  But why is the grain not growing or ripening in expected quantities?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Drought.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most of Egypt gets very little rain anyway.  But rain is important further south, to fill the lakes and tributaries that feed the Nile.  Crops grew in Egypt only in or very near places where the Nile flooded each year.  They had an elaborate system of canals and irrigation to provide water to crops during the growing season.</p>\n\n<p>In the Levant, the drought had a more direct effect, since places like Israel get more rain in the wintertime.  In all places, drought reduced the water available for irrigation.</p>\n\n<p>Drought will reduce available quantities of other plant foods.  Even established trees (for nuts or fruit) that do not normally need supplemental water will dry up and die (or live but reduce their yield).  Other plants will die or have lower yields as well.</p>\n\n<p>One year of drought doesn't generally make a huge difference, though it can for some crops.  But here we had 7 years of drought.  Drought can be devastating even if water levels never drop so far that people and animals do not have enough to drink.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Okay, so they can just eat milk and eggs, right?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Well... livestock animals depend on grains too.  Most livestock gets fed grains or hay (which is grain with the stocks still attached...if it's just the stalks without the grain, it's called straw, which is not nutritious).  And most livestock has some access to pasture.  What is grass? it's grain.  Some animals eat the grass in a leafy form and some need grass that has created grain seeds for their nutrition (or both).  Either way, the drought has ruined the pastures.  Poultry can eat bugs but they usually supplement with some seeds or grain and there will be fewer bugs on the pasture if the cows/etc aren't eating the grass and leaving manure.</p>\n\n<p>Birds will not lay eggs and mammals will not produce (much) milk when underfed.  These things are for reproduction, not survival, and they require a huge number of calories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can they eat the animals?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sure.  And they'll have to, since the people won't be able to keep most of their animals alive, so they'll slaughter some instead.  That works out well for better off people who have animals.  For a year.  Maybe two.  But we're talking about 7 years of famine.  That's a very long time to keep animals alive and continue to eat them.  And it doesn't help people who aren't rich with flocks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What about the river fish?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A lot of people will depend on those fish.  In normal years, the river flows high and strong and is full of fish.  People will use the fish as a small part of their total food intake.  Most will be grain, vegetables/fruit, dairy/eggs, and some meat.</p>\n\n<p>Now, all of a sudden, people will crowd the river, desperate to get what fish they can find.  Very quickly, there won't be many fish left at all.  Not to mention, that the drought means the Nile isn't as deep or as wide or as strong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is a famine?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A famine is not the same as starvation.  In any modern country we have starvation.  People who go through dumpsters looking for food, people who go to soup kitchens, and so forth.  Famine means everyone is suffering.  Maybe not the rich, but the majority of people are affected by whatever calamity has caused there to be a lack of food (drought, war, locusts, etc) and there aren't enough other food stuffs or stored food to make up the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Egypt and the Levant probably could have survived this drought for a single year and had it not turn into famine.  Seven years, however, is a disaster.  The kind that leads to mass death, huge migrations, and sometimes even wars.  Even in modern times.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'll elaborate on my comment with a bit of Drush:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The fact of the famine and subsequent relocation to Egypt was already known to Yaakov & sons from Avrohom. He was the first to set the pattern of: famine > going down to Egypt > pass some tests > come back with big benefits (רכוש גדול).</p></li>\n<li><p>Yitzhok knew it too but G-d prevented him from following it, offering him to do the necessary Tikkunim on the border.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yaakov only awaited for the rumor of the famine to start the drill. So the famine was הכי תמצי for the following, not \"the reason\". Therefore all your claims about Yaakov were true.</p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding the rest of the world. If you're familiar with optical illusions, the human perception differs from the physical reality. G-d can easily create an illusion of a famine and make people stop thinking reasonably to fulfill the grand plan. Therefore אין עני אלא בדעת - it all starts within your brain. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Jacob tells his sons, \"Why do you make yourself conspicuous?\" before sending them to Egypt. This indicates that Jacob's family still had food (perhaps miraculously), but he did not want to give the impression that he was blessed more than his neighbors.</p>\n\n<p>As for the nonperishable nuts and almonds, perhaps he had some but was keeping them for emergencies until his other food ran out.</p>\n\n<p>The Nile has fish, but it isn't abundant enough to replace bread for all of Egypt.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems to be mentioned a lot in the Torah throughout the parsha (especially in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.44.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishis 44</a>) that it should have some sort of story behind it. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.44.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Malbim_on_Genesis.44.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim 44:15</a> Yosef accuses them of stealing the goblet due to its divination powers . So Yosef makes the claim to the brothers that they are only returning the first money because Yosef has a special goblet he uses to find things out, and now they steal the goblet and the second money so Yosef will not be able to use his goblet to figure it out.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The following is based on the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47091&st=&pgnum=159&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Be'er Yosef</strong></a> to <strong>Genesis</strong> 44:5. It is part of a <em>devar Torah</em> I wrote up <a href=\"https://parshaponders.com/mikeitz-5780/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Yosef was very purposeful in choosing to scare his brothers with an accusation of stealing his precious goblet. Maybe he was trying to remind them of the time they sold him as a slave. Besides the incredible pain they inflicted on their brother, there was something they didn’t take into account. By separating Yaakov from his favorite son, Yosef, they were also causing the former tremendous grief. But there’s more to it than that.</p>\n<p>Yaakov took great efforts to teach Yosef all the Torah knowledge that he knew. The Torah calls<sup>1</sup> Yosef Yaakov’s בן זקונים. While it could mean that he was the son of Yaakov’s old age, a זקן also connotes someone filled with wisdom<sup>2</sup>. בן זקונים would then also mean Yosef was Yaakov’s wise son. This is how we know that Yaakov taught Yosef all that he knew<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>We have many sources<sup>4</sup> that compare the Torah to wine. As well, we are taught<sup>5</sup> that a teacher learns the most from their students. Students make their teachers wiser. We can then therefore compare a student to a cup, who provides a way for the teacher to drink the wine of Torah. First, the teacher pours the wine into the cup. Meaning, they teach their student the Torah that they know. Subsequently, the teacher drinks the wine, by attaining the wisdom gained from teaching the student.</p>\n<p>This was the intention of Yosef placing the goblet in Binyamin’s bag. Yosef’s servants, as they carried out their arrest, declared that this was the goblet that Viceroy Yosef drank from. This hinted to them that they not only stole Yosef’s goblet, but they stole their brother Yosef from their father. Yaakov would pour wine into Yosef, his goblet, as it were, and then would drink the wisdom gained from him. By selling Yosef, they took away this give and take relationship Yaakov was benefiting from.</p>\n<p>This could be the intention behind the Aramaic translation of בן זקונים. Targum Onkelos translates<sup>6</sup> it as בר חכים, which could be read as a wise son<sup>7</sup>. However, it seems like it’s causative verb. Meaning, Yosef is someone who makes others wise. This is referring to the wisdom that Yaakov gained by teaching everything he knew to Yosef<sup>8</sup>.</p>\n<p>Yosef had good intentions. He wanted his brothers to be completely atoned for selling him as a slave. While they had their justifications, Yosef felt they hadn’t thought the matter thoroughly through enough. They didn’t realize what they were doing to their father. Not only were they taking away his favorite son, which they surely realized and considered, but they were taking away Yaakov’s main source for wisdom. For that, they needed the hint of the goblet. Only then could they properly repent<sup>9</sup>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <strong>Genesis</strong> 37:3</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <strong>Kiddushin</strong> 32b; <strong>Seder Olam</strong> Chapter 30; Toras Kohanim 19:32; <strong>Mishneh Torah</strong> <em>Hilchos Talmud Torah</em> 6:1</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <strong>Rashi</strong>, <strong>Ramban</strong>, and <strong>Targum Onkelos</strong> <em>ad. loc.</em> <strong>Bereishis Rabbah</strong> 84:8.

    "content": "# Can a Jew use a knife that belongs to a non-Jew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know there's a whole thing about a Jew being allowed to use the kli of a non-Jew without tevilah, but I don't know the extent of that allowance. I was part of a conversation on facebook where someone said that a Jew can use a non-Jew's knife and cutting board to prepare kosher food without a problem, but I was under the impression that knives are in a special category of \"DO NOT DO THIS.\" \nAnyone know what the source is for either a yes or no?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The two issues, as I see it, are -- dipping in the mikvah, and any transfer of non-kosher taste.</p>\n\n<p>As for the mikvah -- if it belongs to a non-Jew and the Jew is just borrowing it, there's no obligation to dunk it. The obligation is only on Jewish-owned vessels. If the lender doesn't mind, I suppose you could borrow it and kasher it, which would take care of the kosher concerns. </p>\n\n<p>Now as for if that knife isn't kosher: firstly, the knife may not be quite clean. Traditionally there were many valid concerns that knives retained grease, especially around the serrations. (And especially before stainless steel and modern detergents!) This is why the old-fashioned recommendation for kashering a knife was \"first stick it into frozen earth, which will scrape off all the gunk. Then kasher it.\" (Or today's recommendation -- use steel wool, then kasher.) I've heard differing opinions today how much of a concern this continues to be. (And if the cutting board has lots of little grooves ... good luck getting it clean well.)</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, even if I am sure the non-kosher knife is 100% clean, there is a rule that using it to cut sharp-flavored things like fenugreek, onions, or lemons will still get some of the non-kosher taste transferred from the metal into the food.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, even when dealing with cold, clean, non-kosher utensils, the rule is to use them \"only occasionally\"; if you use them regularly, sooner or later someone is going to use something hot (which transfers more taste). Rabbi Hershel Schachter's opinion is that once a month is the maximum that can be called \"occasionally.\"</p>\n\n<p>So theoretically if I can be certain this knife is clean, I can use it to cut a cucumber -- but not an onion! -- once a month. There are enough conditions here that I can see why many would just say \"not recommended.\" </p>\n\n<p>(See Shach, Yoreh Deah 96.21)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rav Soloveichik foundational essay on what Modern Orthodoxy is\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was having an argument with someone about Modern Orthodoxy, me being pro him being against, he said that even The Rav said in his foundational essay on Modern Orthodoxy that the reason for Modern Orthodoxy is because nowadays we need madah to survive as a nation in the Modern World, making it a <em>bidyeved</em> movement according to The Rav.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know what he might be talking about? I've been searching for this essay and I can't find anything. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Perhaps your interlocutor was referring to \"Joseph and his Brothers\", printed in <em>The Rav Speaks</em>, where R. Soloveitchik says (my emphasis):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Biblical Joseph relates: \"and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars bow down to me\"  (Gen. 37:9) — there is secular culture, great and powerful technology creating wonders and changing the foundations of our life. <strong>Even if it is true that in Canaan we can get along without it — this secular culture entails destructive elements, many negative and perverse aspects; it may be a blessing and a curse simultaneously, and thus as long as one can live without it, so much the better for the spirit — finally we will have to relate to it.</strong> The confrontation will not take place in Canaan, however, where life flows serenely, but in a new and alien land where the tempo of life is greatly accelerated and fundamental changes occur daily.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't know that this would be termed R. Soloveitchik's \"foundational essay on Modern Orthodoxy\", though.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For what little it is worth, two of my rebbeim were close talmidim of \"the Rav\" for many years and I've had many conversations with them about modern orthodoxy. They have never said that the Rav thought modern orthodoxy was some kind of necessary evil or b'dieved concession. (I will add, however, that both those same rebbeim have told me that the Rav thought properly integrating torah u'madah can be a difficult task that many people are not suited for. But that's not the same thing.)</p>\n<p>To the contrary, the Rav's first-hand writings show he thought secular knowledge had intrinsic value and could enhance our understanding of Torah. I myself am not a close scholar of his works, but if you read Halakhic Mind I think that's pretty clear. (I don't know what \"his foundational essay on Modern Orthodoxy\" would be, but Halakhic Mind is a pretty important statement of his views on the subject). In addition, integration of secular thought has been a critical part of many Jewish traditions, most notably during the golden age of Spain. See, for example, this article about the Baal Akedat Yitzchak. <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1705-arama-isaac-ben-moses\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1705-arama-isaac-ben-moses</a>. Halakhic Mind explicitly references these traditions, all of which makes clear (to me at least) that the Rav saw \"Torah u'Mada\" as the traditional, authentic Jewish way and not a modern, b'dieved invention.</p>\n<p>Perhaps your interlocutor was mixing up the Hafetz Haim's rationale for teaching women Torah with Rav Soloveitchik? It's a stretch but the closest I can think of.</p>\n\n\n",

Aloneness means lacking love and friendship; this is an entirely destructive feeling. Loneliness, on the other hand, is an awareness of one’s uniqueness, and to be unique often means to be misunderstood. A lonely person, while surrounded by friends, feels that his unique and incommunicable experiences separate him from them. This fills him with a gnawing sense of the seemingly insurmountable gap that prevents true communion between individuals. While painful, this experience can also be “stimulating” and “cathartic,” since it “presses everything in me into the service of God,” the Lonely One, who truly understands the lonely individual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, he feels lonely in the sense of a feeling of <strong>uniqueness</strong> and <strong>separation from other people</strong>.

    "content": "# Why did brothers take Yossef's dreams seriously?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my understanding, the whole story of the brother's revenge to Yossef started with Yossef's dreams, which he told his father and brothers.</p>\n<p>Yossef wasn't a prophet, he showed no signs of genius or fulfilling of his previous dreams. Nevertheless, the brothers believed the story so much they plotted to kill him and see if the dreams will come true <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.37.20?vhe=Tanach_with_Nikkud&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Gen 37, 20)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>וְעַתָּה לְכוּ וְנַהַרְגֵהוּ</strong> וְנַשְׁלִכֵהוּ בְּאַחַד הַבֹּרוֹת וְאָמַרְנוּ חַיָּה רָעָה אֲכָלָתְהוּ <strong>וְנִרְאֶה מַה־יִּהְיוּ חֲלֹמֹתָיו</strong>׃</p>\n<p>\"Come now, <strong>let us kill him</strong> and throw him into one of the pits; and we can say, ‘A savage beast devoured him.’ <strong>We shall see what comes of his dreams!</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we read the Torah it comes to us naturally postfactum, after reading Parshos Miketz and Vayigash, but they didn't know it.</p>\n<p>What was the reason they took his dreams seriously, especially after Yaakov himself asserted that it was meaningless?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The OP accepts that the \"brothers' revenge\" started with \"Yossef's dreams\".</p>\n\n<p>However, this is not entirely the case.</p>\n\n<p>The problem started with Yossef's slander against his brothers, reported to their father, Yaakov.</p>\n\n<p>Gen. 37:2 \"...and Joseph brought <strong>evil tales</strong> about them to their father.\"</p>\n\n<p>The situation was then irritated further in Gen. 37:4:</p>\n\n<p>\"And his brothers saw that <strong>their father loved him more than all his brothers, so they hated him</strong>, and they could not speak with him peacefully.\"</p>\n\n<p>So jealousy was another reason.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, <strong>slander and jealousy</strong> continued to be the underlying reasons behind the ill feelings between Yossef and his brothers. The dreams merely added to the overall negativity of the situation.</p>\n\n<p>After the first dream the verse says:</p>\n\n<p>Gen. 37:8 \"And they continued further to hate him on account of his dreams and <strong>on account of his words</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi: \"and on account of his words: Because of the evil tales that he would bring to their father.\"</p>\n\n<p>After the second dream the verse says:</p>\n\n<p>Gen. 37:11 \"So <strong>his brothers envied him</strong>, but his father awaited the matter.\"</p>\n\n<p>So we see that envy and slander were still the fuel of the hatred. The dreams were just an additional annoying catalyst.</p>\n\n<p>(Contrary to the OP's assumption, we also find that Yossef was someone who could at least have \"shown signs of genius\" at this time:</p>\n\n<p>Gen 37:3 \"And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because <strong>he was a son of his old age</strong>; and he made him a fine woolen coat.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rashi; 2nd explanation: \"a son of his old age: Heb. - בֶן זְקֻנִים, for he was born to him in his old age (Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, ch. 38). Onkelos rendered: <strong>for he was a wise son to him.</strong> Whatever he had learned from Shem and Eber he gave over to him. ...\")</p>\n\n<p>So what about the verse: \"וְעַתָּה לְכוּ וְנַהַרְגֵהוּ וְנַשְׁלִכֵהוּ בְּאַחַד הַבֹּרוֹת וְאָמַרְנוּ חַיָּה רָעָה אֲכָלָתְהוּ וְנִרְאֶה מַה־יִּהְיוּ חֲלֹמֹתָיו\"׃</p>\n\n<p>\"Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; and we can say, ‘A savage beast devoured him.’ <strong>We shall see what comes of his dreams!”</strong></p>\n\n<p>??</p>\n\n<p>Rashi tells us that the brothers actually did not say the last part: \"We shall see what comes of his dreams!\"</p>\n\n<p>It was said by Hashem Himself.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi: \"and we will see what will become of his dreams: Rabbi Isaac said, This verse says: “Expound on me.” [I.e., this verse demands a midrashic interpretation.] The Holy Spirit says thus: They (the brothers) say, “Let us kill him,” but the verse concludes: “and we will see what will become of his dreams.” Let us see whose word will stand up, yours or Mine. It is impossible that they (the brothers) are saying,“and we will see what will become of his dreams,” because, since they will kill him, his dreams will come to nought.\"</p>\n\n<p>But even if they did mention the dreams when being annoyed at him, (in addition to the slander and jealousy) it does not prove they believed he even had a dream; or that the dreams meant anything.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, it simply could mean that they were threatened by a brother who liked to advertise he was going to rule over them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I read somewhere that the brothers knew that his dreams will become true as later was revealed because they also dreamed about it.</p>\n\n<p>This is why Pharoh crowned him - not because he solved his dreams, but because Pharoh also dreamed the solution to the dream ,and when Josef told the solution, Pharoh knew immidiately that Josef was the man he was looking for crowning at his side.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How would Yossef's story turn different if he was truly prophesying?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Following my last question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/97621/why-did-brothers-take-yossefs-dreams-seriously\">\"why-did-brothers-take-yossefs-dreams-seriously\"</a>.</p>\n\n<p>How would the development of events be different if instead of simply dreaming, Yossef was having G-d's prophecy of the same content, just like his father saw the ladder? </p>\n\n<p>In other words, after seeing the sheaves G-d appears to Yosef and says \"your father and mother and brothers will bow to you.\" And Yosef awakes.</p>\n\n<p>Could he prove it was a prophecy? Would his brothers and Yaakov believe him if he said: \"G-d was speaking to me\" <strong>and treat him differently</strong>? Could he ask his grandfather Itzhak or his father Yaakov what to do with the prophecy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Gen 37:10 \"And he told [it] to his father and to his brothers, and his father rebuked him and said to him, \"What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will we come I, <strong>your mother,</strong> and your brothers to prostrate ourselves to you to the ground?\"</p>\n\n<p>Rashi: \"Will we come: Isn’t your mother (Rachel) already dead? But he (Jacob) did not know that the matters referred to Bilhah, who had raised him (Joseph) as [if she were] his mother (Gen. Rabbah 84:11). Our Rabbis, however, derived from here that there is no dream without meaningless components (Talmud Berachos 55a/b). Jacob, however, intended to make his sons forget the whole matter, so that they would not envy him (Joseph). Therefore, he said,“Will we come, etc.” Just as it is impossible for your mother, so is the rest meaningless.\"</p>\n\n<p>The difference between a mere dream (which can have a level of prophetic content (see Talmud Berachos and the dream section 55a etc.), and a full prophecy, is that a dream can contain elements of nonesense. Prophecy is a clear message from Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Zechariah 10:2 \"...dreams speak falsely...\"</p>\n\n<p>Devarim 18: 21-22:</p>\n\n<p>\"Now if you say to yourself, \"How will we know the word that the L-rd did not speak?\" If the prophet speaks in the name of the L-rd, <strong>and the thing does not occur and does not come about</strong>, that is the thing the Lord did not speak. The prophet has spoken it wantonly; you shall not be afraid of him.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, a prophecy must come to pass in order for it to be true.</p>\n\n<p>So the way we prove prophecy is simply by seeing if it happens.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rambam Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah: 9:1-2</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"\nAny prophet who arises and tells us that G-d has sent him does not have to [prove himself by] performing wonders like those performed by Moses, our teacher, or like the wonders of Elijah or Elisha, which altered the natural order.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, the sign of [the truth of his prophecy] will be the fulfillment of his prediction of future events, as [implied by Deuteronomy 18:21]: \"How shall we recognize that a prophecy was not spoken by G-d?...\"</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if a person whose [progress] in the service of G-d makes him worthy of prophecy arises [and claims to be a prophet] - if he does not intend to add [to] or diminish [the Torah], but rather to serve G-d through the mitzvot of the Torah - we do not tell him: \"Split the sea for us, revive the dead, or the like, and then we will believe in you.\" Instead, we tell him, \"If you are a prophet, tell us what will happen in the future.\" He makes his statements, and we wait to see whether [his \"prophecy\"] comes to fruition or not.</p>\n\n<p>Should even a minute particular of his \"prophecy\" not materialize, he is surely a false prophet. If his entire prophecy materializes, we should consider him a true [prophet].</p>\n\n<p>We should test him many times. If all of his statements prove true, he should be considered to be a true prophet, as [I Samuel 3:20] states concerning Samuel, \"And all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, knew that Samuel had been proven to be a prophet unto G-d.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yosef could prove that his dream was just a dream for 2 reasons. Both of these reasons are given as an explanation of a verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.23.29?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 23:29</a> describing prophecy: <em>Behold, My word is like fire — declares GOD — and like a hammer that shatters rock!</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The prophetic experience draws a person in like fire. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.23.29?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on this verse</a> explains: Is not My word so like fire? They (the false prophets) should not have erred to compare their dreams to say that they are prophecy, for the <em>prophetic word, when it comes to a prophet, it comes into him with force like a burning fire</em>, as the matter is stated (supra 20:9): “And it was in my heart like a burning fire,” and (Ezekiel 3:14): “And the hand of the Lord became strong upon me.”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A prophetic statement has several interpretations as explained in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.34a.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Sanhedrin 34a</a>. The Gemara discusses the ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan: From where is this matter derived? Abaye says: As the verse states: “God has spoken once, twice I have heard this; that strength belongs to God” (Psalms 62:12). Abaye explains: <em>One verse is stated by God and from it emerge several explanations, but one explanation does not emerge from several verses.</em> Alternatively, the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught that the verse states: “Is not My word like as fire? says the Lord; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces” (Jeremiah 23:29). Just as this hammer breaks a stone into several fragments, so too, one verse is stated by God and from it emerge several explanations. (Just note the number of different commentaries we have on our Scripture!)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yosef did not describe his experience when seeing the dream as drawing fire. He believed that his dream also had only one interpretation. Yosef could certainly ask his father and grandfather regarding prophecy, since Rashi on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.3?ven=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 37.3</a> explains that Yaakov taught Yosef everything that he learned in Yeshiva of Shem and Ever. The brothers could accept words of prophecy as well. However, here's a monkey wrench. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.89b.6?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Shabbos 89b</a> implies that, had not Yosef been sold into slavery, Jewish people would be taken to Egypt in iron chains.</p>\n\n\n",

He derives this from two different phraseologies. First, the Torah says וראיתם אותו — \"and you should see it\". Ralbag argues that \"it\" means that there should be only one of them. The Torah also says  אשר תכסה בה — \"that you cover with it\". Again, Ralbag argues that \"it\" means that there should be only one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד למדנו ממה שאמר וראיתם אתו ולא אותו וחברו ר\"ל אין ראוי לאדם שישא יחד שני טליתות מצויינים וכן למדנו זה ממה שאמר אשר תכסה בה [ר\"ל אחת ולא שתים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his commentary to Deuteronomy 22:12 he goes further and states that wearing multiple garments with <em>tzitzit</em> leads to a belief in the lack of unity of God, and is a violation of <em>bal tosif</em> (adding to the commandments):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואחשוב שאין ראוי לאדם שילבש יחד שני בגדים שיש בהם ציצית שהרי נאמר אשר תכסה בה ולא בה ובחברתה וראיתם אתו ולא אותו וחבירו עם שזה יביא להאמנת השניות בשם יתעלה ובתורה כי זאת המצוה מעידה על הפך זה כמו שבארנו במה שקדם בסוף פרשת שלח לך ובכלל הנה כמו שיעברו על נשיאת שני תפילין בראש משום בל תוסיף מפני שיש מקום בראש ראוי להניח בו שני תפילין כן יעברו על נשיאת יותר מבגד ציצית אחד משום בל תוסיף שהרי האדם ראוי לעשות כמה בגדי ציצית כי לא הונח לו מקום מוגבל אם יהיה בבגד העליון או התחתון או האמצעי ואולם שאר הדינים אשר בציצית כבר בארנום בסוף פרשת שלח לך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Avigdor Tzorfati similarly writes that if someone has more than one garment with four corners, only one of them requires <em>tzitzit</em>, as the Torah's statement על ארבע כנפות כסותך — \"on the four corners of your garment\" implies specifically one garment:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pesak 275</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וסבירא ליה לרבנו דאם היו לו לאדם כמה מיני ד' כנפות שאין צריך להטיל ציצית רק באחד מהם שנאמר על ארבע כנפות כסותך משמע לחד ולא לשנים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_ben_Jacob_ha-Kohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Aharon ben Yaakov Hakohen</a> writes that there is a dispute whether or not multiple garments require tzitzit, and he says that neither side adduced proof:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיכא דלביש תרי מלבושים או שלש בעלי ארבע כנפות או יותר בזה יש מחלוקת בין הפוסקים יש אומרים שצריך להטיל ציצית בכלן ויש אומרים שאין צריך אלא בעליון ואין אחד מהם מביא ראיה לדבריו אלא משיקול הדעת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notably, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Karo</a> completely rejects the view that only one garment would require <em>tzitzit</em>:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beit Yosef Siman 8</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה דבר פשוט בעיני ובארחות חיים מצאתי שיש אומרים שאין צריך להטיל אלא בעליון עד כאן ואני אומר דסברא דחויה היא זו ולית דחש לה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Any four-cornered garment made of wool or linen is obligated in tzitzit from the Torah, while other materials are obligated only Rabbinically(Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 9:1 and 10:1).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, wearing multiple four-cornered garments with tzitzit is counted as multiple mitzvot. This was also the practice of R' Chaim Pinchas Sheinberg ztz\"l who wore upwards of 100 talitot katan with different shitot of tying their knots. </p>\n\n<p>The issur of bal tosif applies <em>only</em> when one adds a fifth or more set of tzitzit to a four-cornered garment(as opposed to the four required by the Torah). </p>\n\n<p>Wearing a a four-cornered garment lacking all four tzitziot is a bitul aseh and it is forbidden to wear such a garment until four tzitziot are placed on it, according to halacha and tradition of knotting them(SA OC 8:17).</p>\n\n<p>A garment with more than four corners is also obligated in tzitzit. In this case, the tzitziot should be tied to the farthest of the five(or more) corners(SA OC 10:1). </p>\n\n<p>Four cornered cloths(not clothing) are not obligated in tzitzit when they are meant for something other than clothing. Blankets, towels, scarves, and handkerchiefs are some examples(see SA OC 10:10-12).</p>\n\n\n",

I haven't seen anyone stay with the mourner anywhere that I have been. There's also nothing in the picture stating this is needed.</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, Kabbalat Shabbat is a \"mix\". Technically, men do not accept Shabbat until they say the song for the Shabbat day. This explains in part why the mourner is asked to wait outside - because he is still allowed to mourn.</p>\n\n<p>For the others in the congregation, Kabbalat Shabbat is a joyous prayer that greets the Shabbat queen, and is a \"preparation\" for Shabbat acceptance. Thus, in a way, if a congregant sat with the mourner, in a slight sense, he is mourning on Shabbat, which is a contradiction for him.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Was Adam HaRishon's eating from the Tree of Knowledge really a sin",
    "content": "# Was Adam HaRishon's eating from the Tree of Knowledge really a sin\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Most of the characterizations I have seen portray eating of the Tree of Knowledge as a sin.</p>\n\n<p>Yet (I personally, with no validation for my surmise) would be inclined to think otherwise. My reasoning is:</p>\n\n<p>-- Do we really want to live in Gan Eden. Therein, everything would be benign and \"tam gan eden\" would have no connotation of delight. </p>\n\n<p>-- Coincident with this act is the \"gift\" of free will (I assume this exists). From then on, throughout Torah, man's choices are key constituents, if not drivers, of the narrative. Many times we blow it, but either implicitly or explicitly we are given a choice and sometimes a bit of advice: choose Life. </p>\n\n<p>-- Yenims portray this as a fall, leaving man in sin until their purported redeemer comes along, and you know the rest of the story. Granted there is a thread of mashiac running through our heritage, yet we are informed that \"it is not in heaven\" and are exhorted to \"choose Life.\" Which I interpret as: get on with it; no \"Waiting for Godot.\"</p>\n\n<p>Are there any traditional sources that support this opinion (Erich Fromm expresses such sentiments, but he describes himself as a well-educated nontheist).</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Maybe I should redirect this a bit. Despite the downvotes, I am not oblivious to the fact that a directive of God was violated. Yet, this is not considered in the 613 mitzvos and further the word \"sin\" is not mentioned. If I'm not mistaken, the first time \"sin\" is explicitly mentioned in Chumash is in the context of the golden calf. </p>\n\n<p>My question was, to reiterate, is there any mention of the perspective I mentioned in traditional sources. Does that warrant a downvote rather than a simple \"no\" or otherwise citing a valid source?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps more interesting would be, is there any (again in valid sources) discussion as to what the world would have been like if the command was adhered to?</p>\n\n<p><strong>YET FURTHER EDIT</strong> Here is a quote that I cane across that may be relevant:</p>\n\n<p>\"And it’s very helpful to remember Rebbe Nachman’s statement: 'Everything you see in this world, everything that is created, is all for the sake of man’s free will'” (Tzaddik #519).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Of course it was a sin. </p>\n\n<p>G-d commanded Adam (Bereishis 2.17) NOT to eat from the Tree; eating was in direct defiance to G-ds Will. With all the rationalisations in the world (some including your list of advantages gained from eating from the Tree), it was still forbidden, and henceforth, a sin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The biggest problem in Judaism is the lack of definitions. Nobody starts with defining the terms, therefore the discussions turn to some blind accusations. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>THere's no clear definition of a Mitzvah and similarly a sin/transgression.</p></li>\n<li><p>In my personal understanding, in the current world, defined by Rambam as a reward/punishment system (the 13 principles), whatever results in reward is defined as a Mitzvah, and whatever results in punishment is defined as a sin.</p></li>\n<li><p>Therefore, whatever G-d punishes is automatically classified as a sin, no matter what good/bad consequences it bears. As the eating from the tree was clearly punished, it has to be a sin in G-d's eyes.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now to your points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Adam was granted free will, otherwise, he wouldn't be punished. It might be different from ours but it surely was a free will.</p></li>\n<li><p>The humanity is destined to return to [a sort of] Gan Eden so staying in GE is not bad on its own.</p></li>\n<li><p>THe Gemmorah says (A\"Z 5a) \"בואו ונחזיק טובה לאבותינו שאלמלא הן לא חטאו אנו לא באנו לעולם\" - let's be thankful for our forefathers' sins for without them we wouldn't be born. Your positive attitude is nothing new, many good things came out of destruction and disasters, like the destruction of the Temples because of our sins, and nevertheless, we still call it sins.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As far as I know, taking what is not yours without permission is called stealing, right? By eating the forbidden fruit they comitted a theft.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it was the first sin - stealing and disobeying the Lord.</p>\n\n\n",

If it's <strong>about beauty</strong>, Rambam (Issurey Biyah 22, 8) allows examining a woman's face but what about the rest of the body? If it's <strong>about Midos</strong> (Rambam Ishus 3,19) \"עַד שֶׁיִּרְאֶנָּה <strong>וְתִהְיֶה כְּשֵׁרָה בְּעֵינָיו</strong>\" - how do you check the Midos?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question 2 is predicated on a reading of the word כשר as referring to proper spiritual value, and therefore middot. I do not believe that that interpretation is correct.</p>\n\n<p>Here is Rabbi Daniel Eidensohn (author of the sefer Daat Torah) <a href=\"http://daattorah.blogspot.com/2012/10/is-love-obligation-rambam-vs-yevamos-62b.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">correctly translating</a> the Rambam under discussion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rambam (Hilchos Ishus 3:19): Similarly a man should not marry of a child nor should he marry a woman until he has seen her and <strong>she is acceptable</strong> in his eyes. That is because if he doesn’t see her first it might turn out that she doesn’t find favor in his eyes when he does see her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translating the word כשר as fitting, acceptable, pleasing is not Rabbi Eidensohn's invention. Here is an entry from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%9B%D6%B0%D6%BC%D7%A9%D6%B7%D7%81%D7%A8?ven=London,_Luzac,_1903&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jastrow</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כְּשַׁר ch. same , to be right, pleasing, fit.

XV, 4; a. fr.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since this is within the range of meaning of the word, it makes a ton of sense to say that the Rambam is consistent with his own source, rather than translating it otherwise and positing that he disagrees with his source.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of checking out the rest of her body (for moles), the answer is that there is a tension between values and prohibitions. No, he may not demand to see the woman's nude body, and there are negative repercussions for his doing so. There are also negative repercussions for despising the looks of his wife. These are competing values. What the gemara discusses is in the context of not sending an agent, because he should see her, so it is talking about normal looking at a person when you interact with them. But no one suggested that this concern should override modesty considerations. Otherwise, perhaps he should sleep with her before marriage, in case he might decide that he doesn't like her!</p>\n\n<p>Your question 1, whether it has to do with mekach taut -- it does not seem so from the sources. The gemara references ve'ahavta lereiacha kamocha, that you should not despise her. So it is about ethics. Further, <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-torah-obligation-to-love-ones-wife.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">my own suggestion</a> is that this is a special derasha, of va'ahavta lerei'acha prime. The standard one is loving your fellow person as yourself, which naturally encompasses your wife as well. But Chazal are darshening re'acha as \"your beloved\" -- see Shir Hashirim, 5:2 as an example, רַעְיָתִי.</p>\n\n\n",

It was a wholly spiritual manifesto, pertaining to the soul of man and to the spiritual reality of the “heavens.” While its concepts could, and were, applied to physical life, physical life could not be elevated—it could be improved and perfected to the limits of its potential, but it could not transcend its inherent coarseness and subjectivity.

He summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, empowering physical man to raise his physical self and world to a higher state of existence.

I agree with that assessment, but I still wonder about the custom.  <strong>Is this one local community's innovation, or is it more widespread (and just not in my pre-merger minyan)?  Is it based on anything specific?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'm particularly curious about collecting <em>tzedakah</em> during any part of the torah service (not during the actual reading, of course).  I wondered this morning if it was somehow tied to us just having said <em>mi sheberach</em> for healing.  A comment suggests that it's the first opportunity so that might be why.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Collecting Tzedakka while interrupting a Mitzvah is a transgression and is called \"מצווה הבאה בעבירה\", therefore Tzedakka cannot be collected during Kriat Shemah, the Amida Prayer including the Chazarah, reading of the Torah, Kaddishim etc. (<em>BTW It is also not a good conduct to collect in a Kolel where people are studying Torah intensively</em>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Tzdaka can be collected during Pesukey Dezimra and from the moment of returning of the Sefer Torah to the end of the Teffilah. As the number of people reaches its maximum during the reading of the Torah (unlike Psukey Dezimra) the best time to collect is while returning Sefer Torah to Aron.</p></li>\n<li><p>This is practiced in all Haredi congregations in Israel. This applies to private collectors as well as to Shuls' Gabbayim.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

This teaching is said by Jews at the close of each daily prayer service with the Aleinu prayer. It says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>that You will sweep idolatry away so that false gods will be utterly destroyed, and that <strong>You will perfect the world by Your sovereignty so that all humanity will invoke Your name, and all the earth's wicked will return to You, repentant.</strong> Then all who live will know that to You every knee must bend, every tongue pledge loyalty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It does not say that destruction comes upon humanity, G-d forbid, but rather that everyone will be perfected through Moshiach's coming.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Nobody knows exactly until it happens, see Rambam end of Melachim (cited above).

    "content": "# Pharaoh's adjective change to Yosef\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Pharaoh first hears that Yosef's family is going to reunite, he offers them חלב הארץ, literally the fat of the land (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.45.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 45:18</a>). Rashi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.45.18.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad. loc.</a>) explains חלב means מיטב, the best. Onkelos (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Onkelos_Genesis.45.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ad. loc.</a>) similarly translates חלב הארץ as טובא דארעה.</p>\n\n<p>When the brothers subsequently meet Pharoah, Pharaoh offers them מיטב הארץ (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 47:6</a>). Onkelos <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Onkelos_Genesis.47.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">translates</a> as בדשפיר בארעה, of the beautiful land.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any commentaries which explain this switch in adjective use? Is there a difference in meaning? If so, why did Pharaoh change his mind? If not, why change word choice (ie: say חלב both times, or מיטב if that's what he means)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would argue that the two verses are not talking about the same thing. The verse in 45:18 is saying that the brothers will eat of the fat of the land. It is not talking about the land itself; it is talking about what the land produces. The term for describing the best that the land produces is חלב הארץ.</p>\n\n<p>The verse in 47:6, by contrast, is discussing the land itself. The discussion there is about where they will live (הושב, ישבו). They will live in the best part of the land, and the term to describe the best part of the land is מיטב הארץ.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, we can explain that the two terms are referring to different people. When the verse specifies חלב הארץ it is referring to the brothers. When it specifies מיטב הארץ it is referring to Yaakov. As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> (to 47:6) explains, the verse in 47:6 should be broken up differently. It is saying that Yaakov should dwell in the מיטב הארץ because he is old and simply desires rest and good air. The brothers, however, will dwell in Goshen which is suitable for their pasturing needs. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במיטב הארץ הושב את אביך כי הוא זקן ואינו מבקש רק מנוחה ואויר טוב אבל אחיך בחורים ישבו בארץ גשן ארץ מקום מרעה ואל תשיבני מן האתנחתא לומר שהיא מפסקת שהרי דוגמתו מצינו זבולן עם חרף נפשו למות ונפתלי על מרומי שדה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, חלב הארץ in 45:18 may have been referring specifically to the brothers, and not Yaakov.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are there extraneous words in vaykra (Leviticus) 17:3?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am struggling to understand <a href=\"http://www.breslov.com/bible/Leviticus17.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">VAYIKRA (Book of Leviticus) Chapter 17</a> (<a href=\"http://www.breslov.com/bible/Leviticus17.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.breslov.com/bible/Leviticus17.htm#3</a>) verses 3 and 4.  I have read <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18799/are-there-unnecessary-words-in-torah\">Are there extraneous words in Torah?</a> (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18799/are-there-unnecessary-words-in-torah\">Are there unnecessary words in torah?</a>) and <strong>I think I understand the underlying principle that there are no extraneous words in the Torah, but not the specific application to this verse</strong>.\nAn animal may be slaughtered (Gunther Plaut's and Richard Friedman's translation) either inside the camp or outside the camp.  Why then, does the text say \"Inside the camp or outside the camp\".  I assume that the width of the boundary of the camp is very narrow.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of the text would be \"If anybody in the house of Israel that slaughters an Ox, lamb or goat and has not brought it to the door of the tent of meeting, to present it as an offering to HaShem before the tabernacle of HaShem, then blood shall be imputed unto that person because they have shed blood; and that person shall be cut off from the people.\"  That is not a translation, that is my understanding of the text and you can tell in a moment that that is the understanding of a liberal Jew.</p>\n\n<p><em>Todah</em> </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems that According to Rabeinu Bacheye quoting Rashi, that Initially Hashem forbade Adam to eat slaughtered animals. Hashem only later on allowed slaughtered animals for either the Temple service when slaughterred as commanded inside the Beth Hamikdash, or for regular consumption. So if someone would consecrate an animal for G-d and then \"spill/waste its Blood\" by not adhering to the sacrificial procedures intentionally, he was never permitted to By G-d to do such a thing and has killed G-ds creature and has transgressed the prohibition of Adam not Kill animals so measure for measure his blood gets spilled by the punishment of Kareis (which means he will die before the age of 60). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דם יחשב לאיש ההוא דם שפך. מפני שבזמנו של אדם הראשון היו כל הבעלי חיים אסורין למאכלו כי לא הותר לו אלא הפירות כענין שכתוב (בראשית א) הנה נתתי לכם את כל עשב זורע זרע ואת כל העץ אשר בו פרי עץ, עד שנתחייבו כליה בדור המבול ונצולו בזכותו של נח ואז הותרו למאכלו, ועל כן יאמר בכאן כי מי שישחט במחנה או חוץ למחנה ואל פתח אהל מועד לא הביאו תחלה, דם יחשב לאיש ההוא דם שפך, כאלו שפך דם האדם, כי יחזור לאיסורו הראשון שהיה בזמנו של אדם, שוחט השור כמכה איש, כן פירש רש\"י</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So regular slaughtering for regular consumption can be done anywhere as stated Zevachim 106b the parameters of not slaughtering \"outside the camp\" was intended for Hekdesh (consecrated animals for Temple service) which cannot be slaught outside the encampment of the Divine presence i.e the Mishkan or Beit HaMikdash.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There were basically three \"zones\" as far as sacrifices were concerned. In Moses' times, they were: the Tabernacle (1), the rest of the camp (2), and beyond the camp (3). In King Solomon's times, those translated to: the Temple, the rest of the city of Jerusalem, and outside of Jerusalem. Sacrifices must be <em>slaughtered</em> in Zone 1, but many (e.g. the Passover lamb) can then be eaten throughout Zone 2. </p>\n\n<p>Thus the verse is saying that you are in very big trouble if you attempt to slaughter a sacrifice outside of Zone 1: whether you are in Zone 2 (close isn't good enough), or Zone 3 (even though it's sufficiently far to never be confused with a real Zone 1 offering.) </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why is Benjamin referred to as a youth?",
    "content": "# Why is Benjamin referred to as a youth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In several places, parsha vayigash refers to Benjamin as a youth (na-ar).  But he must have been close to 30 years old since Joseph was at that time already in Egypt for about 20 years.  Why is Benjamin referred to as a youth?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Exodus 33:11 Joshua is referred to as a \"na'ar\" as well (my emphasis):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the LORD spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he would return into the camp; but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, <strong>a young man</strong>, departed not out of the Tent. (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0233.htm#11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechon-Mamre translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many of the commentaries there raise the issue of how he could be called a \"na'ar\" if he was already 57 years old at the time, and most of them answer that \"na'ar\" is used to refer to anyone who serves someone since such people tend to be youths. For instance, R. Abraham the son of Rambam formulates it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נקרא נער מפני שהיה משרת משה וקריאת שם זו נופלת על המשרת מפני שהוא נער על פי הרוב אע\"פ שהוא ע\"ה היה בעת ההיא בן שבע וחמשים שנה כמו שביאר אבא מרי ז\"ל במורה</p>\n<p>He is called \"na'ar\" because he was serving Moses, and the calling by this title falls on one who serves because most of the time [such a person] is a \"na'ar\", despite the fact that [Joshua] was at that time 57 years old as explained by my father of blessed memory in Guide [for the Perplexed].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Abraham is presumably referring to what Rambam wrote in Guide for the Perplexed 2:32:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As to the words, \"For I am young\" (<em>ibid.</em> ver. 6), it is well known that the pious Joseph, when he was thirty years old, is called by the Hebrew \"young\" (<em>na‘ar</em>); also Joshua, when he was nearly sixty years old. For the statement, \"and his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, was young,\" occurs in the account of the Golden Calf (Exod. xxxiii. 11). Moses was then eighty-one years old, he lived one hundred and twenty years; Joshua, who survived him fourteen years, lived one hundred and ten years and must consequently have been at least fifty-seven years old at the time when the Golden Calf was made, and yet he is called <em>na‘ar</em>, \"young.\" (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp119.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of the other commentaries also provide other examples in Scripture where a non-youth is referred to as \"na'ar\".</p>\n<p>Accordingly, it is no surprise that Benjamin is referred to as \"na'ar\". In addition to being the youngest of Jacob's children, he also served Jacob and would thus earn the title \"na'ar\". For instance, Radak explaining the brothers' statement to Joseph that their youngest brother remained at home says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונשאר לשרת אבינו</p>\n<p>He remained to serve our father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Preparing a grave before death\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is it against Halacha to prepare a grave before someone who passed away i.e. that the doctors and family know that the person is going to pass away but don’t know when so they make preparations. </p>\n\n<p>What preparations are allowed? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>(I'm using masculine gender generically here; the same laws apply throughout for male or female.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Elchanan Zohn, who heads the Chevra Kaddisha (Jewish Burial Society) of Queens recently put out a pamphlet on end-of-life issues to be distributed in synagogues across the country. It mentioned that <strong>it is meritorious for a person to plan ahead and buy their own burial plot</strong>; in fact, it's considered a blessing for long life.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, let's assume the fellow hasn't done so and now he's deathly ill; what does the family do?</p>\n\n<p>It appears that any preparation can be made, so long as the not-yet-dead person doesn't know or hear about it. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38248&st=&pgnum=16&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">From the minor tractate of <em>Avel Rabsi</em> a.k.a. <em>Semachos</em>, 1:5</a> (emphasis added):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[If someone is on their deathbed], we may not tear clothing [in a sign of mourning], roll up sleeves [to prepare for pall-bearing], recite eulogies, nor bring a coffin <strong>into the person's house</strong>. We may not summon people to gather, nor tell of his good deeds. Rabbi Yehudah says -- if he is a scholar [and thus it's normal to talk that way with him still alive], we may tell of his good deeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The commentaries there explain that any sign of mourning or preparation done in the person's presence can scare them and hasten their death. Here's a citation from Ecclesiastes Ch. 12; the bold portion is actually the Talmud's citation that it's prohibited to do anything that could hasten the death of someone on their deathbed, with \"the cord snaps\" meaning actual death: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All appetite is lost, as man is going to his eternal place, and the wailers begin to gather in the street. <strong>Not until the silver cord snaps and the golden bowl breaks</strong> ... the dust returns to the Earth, as it was, and the spirit returns to God, Who gave it.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it sounds like the funeral wailers are already prepping outside before the fellow has flatlined. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaRosh.32.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Responsa of the Rosh 32:6</a> mentions in passing that if someone was poor and deathly ill, and the town collected charity to buy him a coffin, but the fellow then recovered, that the funds can be returned to the donors. (He makes no mention of such collection being problematic.) </p>\n\n<p>Similarly the Talmud Sanhedrin 48a discusses what to do if funds were raised for a particular individual's burial expenses, and it turns out there were more funds than were needed. In the course of that discussion it entertains the possibility of funds raised while the fellow was still alive to buy his coffin, which the Talmud didn't reject as an objectionable practice. Presumably it's okay so long as he doesn't know about it.</p>\n\n<p>Still, this could be very sensitive if the fellow on his deathbed realizes he's being kept in the dark about plans, the family all exit his room every so often for secret conferences, or the like. So as always, please ask a rabbi about your particular case.</p>\n\n\n",

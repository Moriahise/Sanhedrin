This leads to several definitions of what a חודש means, here. Which of these methods should we use to count?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>According to the fixed calendar that we have now, a month may be either 29 days long or 30 days long. Should we make the pidyon on the same Hebrew date of the following month?</li>\n<li>Do we follow the molad definition of a חודש, meaning 29 days, 12 hours and 793 chalakim?</li>\n<li>Do we use שעות זמניות (\"seasonal hours\") to count each \"day\"? If so, what if the baby travelled from Israel on the <em>chodesh</em> day and he was eligible for the Pidyon but when he arrives, it is still not yet the <em>chodesh</em> day? OR ...</li>\n<li>Do we use a fixed 24-hour day with each hour being a fixed 60 minutes?</li>\n<li>Some other method</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In surmising - is the reason that people wait 31 days a way of \"compromising\" the doubt caused by the above vagueness?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Not less than 30, but as soon as possible from the 31st. Shulchan Aruch YD 305:11 and Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 164:3 affirm this.</p>\n\n<p>אֵין פּוֹדִין אֶת הַבְּכוֹר, עַד שֶׁיַעַבְרו עָלָיו שְׁלֹשִׁים יוֹם. וּבְיוֹם שְׁלֹשִׁים וְאֶחָד יִפְדֵּהוּ מִיָּד, שֶׁלֹּא לְהַשְׁהוֹת אֶת הַמִּצְוָה. וְאֵין פּוֹדִין בְּשַׁבָּת וּבְיוֹם טוֹב. אֲבָל בְּחֹל הַמּוֹעֵד פּוֹדִין. נוֹהֲגִין לַעֲשׂוֹת אֶת הַפִּדְיוֹן בַּיּוֹם. וּמִכָּל מָקוֹם אִם עָבַר יוֹם שְׁלֹשִׁים וְאֶחָד וְלֹא פָדָה, אוֹ שֶׁחָל בְּשַׁבָּת אוֹ בְּיוֹם טוֹב אוֹ בְּתַעֲנִית, יֵשׁ לִפְדּוֹתוֹ תֵּכֶף בַּלַיְלָה שֶׁלְּאַחֲרָיו, וְלֹא יַמְתִּינוּ עַד לְמָחָר לְהַשְׁהוֹת הַמִּצְוָה יוֹתֵר.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if Shabbat or a Yom Tov occur then it is necessary to perform the mitzvah after the 31st, but as soon as possible.  Yoreh Deah 187 and Otzar Pidyon HaBen 17:2. Yalkut Yosef YD 305:68, however, writes that Sephardic minhag is to perform a pidyon haben at night.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning the hours, am not sure what you mean, but he Ramvam clearly states in his commentary to the Mishna in Berachot 1:3 (1:5 in R' Yosef Kaffih's edition), that an hour in halachic terms is one twelfth of the daylight hours, he does not offer an alternative.  This would affirm that we use the שעות זמניות in this instance. However, in terms of counting a day, then the 30-31 days time frame would address this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Moving between timezones is difficult. One would assume that you would use the 31 days to be safe. Of course, checking with a Beth Din in the place you are relocating to would ensure you comply with that jurisdictions rulings on this issue.  Of course it is common practise for the mother to perform a hefsek taharah, count shivah neki'im then go to the mikveh. As this occurs around 28-30 days, the Pidyon usually coincides very soon after this mitzvah. One would hope, B’’H,  that this period of time would never necessitate unnecessary moving of the mother and child.</p>\n\n\n",

And these are they: One who calls his friend by a nickname [which he doesn’t like - BM 58b] ... one who embarrasses his friend in public... When are these words said, that these people do not have a portion in the World to Come? When he dies without repenting. But if he returns from his wickedness, and he dies having repented, he has a portion in the World to Come. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Combine that with what he says earlier, in 2:9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֲבָל עֲבֵרוֹת שֶׁבֵּין אָדָם לַחֲבֵרוֹ כְּגוֹן הַחוֹבֵל אֶת חֲבֵרוֹ אוֹ הַמְקַלֵּל חֲבֵרוֹ אוֹ גּוֹזְלוֹ וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן אֵינוֹ נִמְחַל לוֹ לְעוֹלָם עַד שֶׁיִּתֵּן לַחֲבֵרוֹ מַה שֶּׁהוּא חַיָּב לוֹ וִירַצֵּהוּ. אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהֶחֱזִיר לוֹ מָמוֹן שֶׁהוּא חַיָּב לוֹ צָרִיךְ לְרַצּוֹתוֹ וְלִשְׁאל מִמֶּנּוּ שֶׁיִּמְחל לוֹ. אֲפִלּוּ לֹא הִקְנִיט אֶת חֲבֵרוֹ אֶלָּא בִּדְבָרִים צָרִיךְ לְפַיְּסוֹ וְלִפְגֹּעַ בּוֹ עַד שֶׁיִּמְחל לוֹ.</p>\n  \n  <p>But sins which are between man and his friend, such as one who wounds his friend, or one who curses his friend, or one who robs him, or the like, he is not forgiven [Above] ever until he he gives to his friend that which he owes him and appeases him. Even if he returns the money which he owes him, he still must appease him and ask for forgiveness from him. Even if he didn’t harm his friend with anything but words, he still must appease him and entreat him until he forgives him.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This latter Rambam is essentially quoting the Mishnah, Yoma 85b. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that Tosfos (BM 58b s.v. “Chutz miGimmel”) takes a slightly different view of these sins:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חוץ מג' שיורדין ואין עולין - אין לפרש דאין עולין לעולם ... אלא ה\"פ כל היורדין עולין מיד ואין אור של גיהנם שולט בהן ... אבל יש מהם נדונין לעולם המלבין פני חבירו ברבים דאמר בסמוך אין לו חלק לעולם הבא ... אי נמי מלבין נמי נהי דאין לו חלק לעולם הבא אינם נדונין יותר מי\"ב חדש אלא לאחר י\"ב חדש לא חיין ולא נדונין ושרוים בלא טובה ובלא רעה... וכולהו בשלא עשה תשובה דתשובה מועלת לכל דבר</p>\n  \n  <p>[When the Gemara says that these three don’t ever leave Gehennom,] don’t explain this to mean that they <em>never</em> leave ... rather, this is its explanation: everyone who descended into Gehennom leaves <em>immediately</em>, and the fire of Gehennom does not rule over them. ... But some of these [mentioned in BM] are judged eternally - one who embarrasses his friend in public, as we say momentarily, does not have a share in the World to Come [while others mentioned are judged for 12 months]. Alternatively, one who embarrasses, also: granted that he doesn’t have a share in the World to Come, he’s not judged longer than 12 months, but after 12 months, he doesn’t live, nor is he judged, and he rests with no good nor bad. ... But all of this is when he doesn’t repent, for repentance helps for anything. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the above halachos, one must repent in full, which, for sins between man and his friend, includes asking for full forgiveness. If he doesn’t ask for forgiveness, his repentance is incomplete, and he will be judged, whether like the Rambam, or Tosfos, or whatever Hashem decides is appropriate for him. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What if this happened before Bar Mitzvah...before 20?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why would you think this is any different than the usual rule, that Divine punishment is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8629/9682\">only meted out at 20</a>?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What if the degree of embarrassment was minor?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who are you to judge what the victim feels? You might not think that it’s minor, but his entire world may have been shattered as a result of your careless remark. But let’s say that you’re psychic and you actually know how embarrassed he was by it. Let’s go back to the Gemara everyone is discussing (BM 58b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מכנה היינו מלבין אע\"ג דדש ביה בשמיה</p>\n  \n  <p>One who calls [his friend by] a nickname - that’s the same as one who embarrasses! [Answer: He’s punished] even if he is used to it being used as his name. </p>\n  \n  <p><sub>Translation follows Rashi.</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see from here that regardless of the amount of embarrassment, it still is a sin. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What if the one/s he offended was not nice to him...as well?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even worse. Now you’re also in violation of “Love your neighbor like yourself.” This is in accordance with the famous Gemara in Shabbos 31a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר לו דעלך סני לחברך לא תעביד זו היא כל התורה כולה ואידך פירושה הוא זיל גמור.</p>\n  \n  <p>Hillel said to him, “That which you hate when done to you, do not do to your friend. This is the entire Torah. The rest is commentary; go and learn.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>as understood by Maharsha there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיינו דכתיב בתורה ואהבת לרעך כמוך</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is that which is written in the Torah, “you should love your friend like yourself.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that this is <em>not</em> an issue of revenge, as Rashi to Vayikra 19:18 notes, quoting Yoma 23a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא תקם. אָמַר לוֹ הַשְׁאִילֵנִי מַגָּלְךָ, אָמַר לוֹ לַאו! לְמָחָר אָמַר לוֹ הַשְׁאִילֵנִי קַרְדּוּמְךָ, אָמַר לוֹ, אֵינִי מַשְׁאִילְךָ כְּדֶרֶךְ שֶׁלֹּא הִשְׁאַלְתָּנִי, זוּ הִיא נְקִימָה;</p>\n  \n  <p>“Don’t take revenge.” Reuven says to Shimon, “Lend me your sickle,” and Shimon says back, “No.” The next day, Shimon says to Reuven, “Lend me your shovel,” and Reuven says back, “I won’t lend you, just like you didn’t lend me.” This is revenge. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So revenge is not <em>doing</em> something to someone, but rather <em>not doing</em> something to someone. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding your final question, I encourage you to post it separately, as while all of the above questions are somewhat contained, this last one is a completely different can of worms. </p>\n\n\n",

Moreover, he neither had a teacher nor one to impart aught to him, for he was sunk in Ur of the Chaldeans among the foolish worshipers of stars, and his father, and his mother, like all the people, worshiped stars, and he, although following them in their worship, busies his heart and reflects until he attains the path of truth, and, by his correct thinking, he understood when he finally saw the line of righteousness. He knew that there is One God; He leads the planet; He created everything; and in all that is there is no god save He. He knew that the whole world was in error, and that the thing which caused them to err was, that their worshiping the stars and the images brought about the loss of the truth from their consciousness. <strong>And, when Abraham was forty years old he recognized his Creator.</strong> After he came to this comprehension and knowledge he started to confute the sons of Ur of the Chaldeans, and to organize disputations with them, cautioning them, saying: \"This is not the true path that you are following\", and he destroyed the images, and commenced preaching to the people warning them that it is not right to worship any save the God of the universe, and unto Him alone it is right to bow down, to offer sacrifices, and compound offerings, so that the creatures of the future shall recognize Him. Moreover, it is right to destroy and break in pieces all of the images, so that the whole population of the future be not led to an error like unto these who imagine that there is no God save these images. <strong>When he had them subdued by his well supported contentions, the king tried to put him to death, but he was saved by a miracle, and went hence to Haran.</strong> There he stood up anew and called out in a great voice to the whole world, to let them know that there is One God for the whole universe, and unto Him it is proper to render service. And thus he went onward with his proclamations from city to city, and from government to government, until he attained the land of Canaan amidst his outcry, even as it is said: \"And called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God\" (Gen. 21.33). When the people who congregated about him asked him concerning his preachments, he replied by imparting knowledge to each and every one according to his mentality, to the end that he was able to turn him to the path of truth, until there congregated about him thousands, even tens of thousands, and they became the people of Abraham's household, in whose heart he implanted this great cause, concerning which he compiled books, and which he imparted to his son Isaac. ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the Rambam doesn’t explicitly discuss the Kivshan HaEish, it is implied that this is what he is referring to. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that while the Rambam holds that Avraham began his journey to discovering Hashem at 3 and ultimately began preaching monotheism at 40, the Raavad argues and places the entire account at <strong>3</strong>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובן ארבעים שנה הכיר אברהם את בוראו. א''א יש אגדה בן שלש שנים שנאמר עקב אשר שמע אברהם בקולי מנין עק''ב:<br>\n  “And, when Abraham was forty years old he recognized his Creator.” Says the Raavad: There is an Aggadah [that Abraham was] three, as it says, “Since [עקב] Abraham listened to my voice,” from the numerical value of עקב [i.e. 172, taken from his age at death, 175, yields 3]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kesef Mishnah notes that it is a debate when Abraham recognized Hashem (Nedarim 32a), whether at 3 or 48. He posits that the Rambam had the reading of “40” for that latter opinion, and he combines the two opinions, as above. However, it would come out that according to our reading of the Gemara, that he recognized Hashem at 48, the story of the Kivshan HaEish took place when Avraham was <strong>48</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, one of the few Midrashim that lists Avraham’s ten tests actually gives us a benchmark for his age. In Pirkei d’Rebbi Eliezer 26, we are told:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עשרה נסיונות נתנסה אברהם אבינו, ועמד בכולן. הנס הראשון, כשנולד אברהם בקשו כל גדולי מלכות והקוסמים להרגו <strong>ונחבא בבית הרן שלש עשרה שנה</strong> ולא ראה השמש ולא הירח ולאחר שלש עשרה שנה יצא מבית הרן מדבר בלשון הקדש ומאס באלילים ומשקץ את הפסילים ובטח בשם יוצרו ואמר אשרי אדם בוטח בך.</p>\n  \n  <p>הנס השני, <strong>נחבש בבית האסורים עשרה שנים</strong> שלשה בכותי ושבעה בבי דרי ולאחר עשר שנים שלחו והביאו אותו אצלו <strong>והשליכוהו לתוך כבשן האש</strong> ומלך הכבוד פשט יד ימינו והצילו מכבשן האש שנאמר ויאמר אליו אני ה' אשר הוצאתיך מאור כשדים.</p>\n  \n  <p>With ten tests was our forefather Abraham tested, and he stood in all of them. The first test: when Abraham was born, all of the kings and magicians wished to kill him, and he was <strong>hidden underground for thirteen years</strong>, without seeing the sun or the moon. After thirteen years, he emerged, speaking the Holy Language, despising idols and being disgusted by images. He trusted in Hashem His creator, and he said, “Praiseworthy is the man who trusts in You.” </p>\n  \n  <p>The second test: He was <strong>imprisoned for ten years</strong>, three in Kusi and seven in Bei Dari. After ten years, they sent and brought him next to him, <strong>and they threw him into a fiery furnace</strong>, and the King of Glory stretched out His right hand and saved him from the fiery furnace, as it says, “And He said to him, ‘I am Hashem Who took you out from the furnace of the Chaldeans.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So for the first thirteen years of his life, Avraham was in hiding, and for the ten years concluding with the Kivshan HaEish, he was imprisoned. As we’re not told the time gap between these events, we can’t be sure of an exact age, but this does tell us that at a minimum, Avraham was <strong>23</strong> when he was thrown into the pit. </p>\n\n<p>In summary: According to the Rambam’s reading of Nedarim, Avraham was 40. According to our reading of Nedarim, Avraham was 48. According to the Raavad, Avraham was 3. According to Pirkei d’Rebbi Eliezer, Avraham was at least 23. </p>\n\n\n",

I recall heard many times that, after it was written (in times with no printing press), Rashi's commentary was so treasured that \"<em>every and each one of his words worth a piece of gold</em>\". </p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if this was just a saying to express how we value his commentary or if there is an actual expression saying these words in the books.

These include, for example, the Sha'ar Ephraim (46), R. David Pardo (Mikhtam L'David to YD 32), Hida (Shu\"t Hayyyim Sha'al 2:41), R. Elazar Landau (Yad HaMelekh to Hilkhot Sotah 1:15), Shu\"t Ben Yamin (41), R. Meir Simha of Dvinsk in multiple places such as Ohr Sameah (to Hilkhot Sehehita 12:3), the Seridei Esh (Makkot 48), and numerous others.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, however, this expression is used about other rabbis such as Rif (cf. Rabbi Akiva Eiger to Pesahim 30b).</p>\n\n<p>Much more significant, in my opinion, would be to look various rabbinic descriptions of Rashi's commentary, not limiting it those that happen to compare it to gold. Would those comparing it to gems, for example be any less meaningful? Or would those actually describing the greatness of his work directly; without metaphor, be any less significant?</p>\n\n<p>One such example is the Meiri's comment in his introduction to his commentary to Avot that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וראש לכל החיבורים שנתחברו דרך פירוש הם פי' רש\"י ז\"ל ואם רבו הלוחמים עליו כלי זיינו עליו ותשובתו מתוך דבריו כולם נכונים למבין אין מעלתו נכרת רק ליחידים כי במלה אחת יכלול לפעמים תירוצים של חבילי קושיות </p>\n  \n  <p>At the head of all works composed as explanatory commentaries is the commentary of Rashi.

For it says, “Hashem is good to all, and His Mercy is on all that He made.” (Tehillim 145 “<em>Ashrei</em>” v. 9). And it says, “[The Torah]’s ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace.” (Mishlei 3:14, also said when returning the Torah to the aron)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Aharon Lichtinstein zt\"l points out that the Rambam's prooftext for \"darkhei Shalom\" are about (1) imitating G-d, and (2) that the authentic ways of the Torah are to be pleasant and advance peace. It would seem that the common understanding of Darkhei Shalom is wrong. Rather, we express our concern toward non-Jews for the sake of remaining on the path of peace, because that is Hashem's Path. (Compare the list of examples the Rambam gives here with the list of kindnesses the Talmud [Sotah 14a] shows us examples in the Torah of Hashem doing.) Not pragmatics or PC, but a fundamental part of the ideal.</p>\n<p>Rav Lichtenstein translated the relevant snippet of a responsum by the Rama (#11) to show that peace in-and-of-itself, without any implications of future danger, is sufficient reason to override some prohibitions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We have learned from here that it is permissible to modify [the truth] for the sake of peace, and it is permissible to violate the injunction, “Thou shalt distance thyself from falsehood.” [The consideration of peace] also overrides the biblical prohibition of “Thou shalt not do thus to the Lord thy God,” which bans the erasure of God’s Name, as is explained in the Sifri to Parashat Re’eh and counted by the Rambam and the Semag in their respective enumerations of the mitsvot. Since this is so, I say that it is also the case that [peace] overrides the prohibition of defamation; in other words, it is permissible to defame another if one’s intention is for the sake of Heaven and for a good cause, [namely,] to promote peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The above is based on an email from Yeshivat Har Etzion from decades ago that I could not find a copy. However, it is very similar to Rav Aharon Lichstein's article “In The Human and Social Factor in Halakhah”, Tradition 6 (2002) pp. 89-114, made <a href=\"http://www.lookstein.org/articles/human_social_factor.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">available on-line</a> by the Lookstein Center for Jewish Education at Bar Ilan Univ.)</p>\n<p>A similar idiom that is also commonly understood on pragmatic grounds is \"<em>mishum eivah</em> -- because of enmity\", usually explained as reason to permit something because the enmity likely caused by observing the prohibition may pose a threat. neither idiom is used not used exclusively where there is real risk to life or limb, but that would have to be the meaning of the phrase if it were pragmatic grounds to override Shabbos.  <em>Mishum eiva</em> is applied between father and child on Bava Metzia 12a; on Yuma 12b to the <em>kohein gadol</em>; and on Kesuvos 58b, between husband and wife. So avoiding <em>eivah</em> is a value of some sort detached from the value of saving people from future retaliation. But we were looking at <em>darkhei Shalom</em> in particular.</p>\n<p>There is a story in the <em>gemara</em> (Sukkah 53a) where David <em>haMelekh</em> dug deep holes into the ground as part of his preparations for the future building of the <em>Beis haMiqdash</em>. He dug far enough down to hit the <em>tehom</em>, the subterranean water, and the water came up threatening to drown the world. Achitofel wrote the name of G-d on a pot sherd and through it down the hole, thus stopping the water. He reasoned from the law of <em>sotah</em>, where a paragraph of the Torah that includes Hashem’s name is written on a parchment, dissolved in water (along with some dust from under the <em>Beis haMiqdash</em>) and given to a <em>sotah</em> — a married woman accused of adultery who then is found alone with the suspected paramour. Achitofel reasoned that if Hashem’s name may be erased to save one marriage, then of course it may be erased to save the entire world.</p>\n<p>So, <em>darkhei Shalom</em> and <em>mishum eivah</em> are in reality expressions about advancing world peace and global harmony, and as per the above Rambam, imply a responsibility of Jews toward the welfare of non-Jews.</p>\n<p>The expression \"<em>tikun olam</em> - establishing the world\" or \"<em>tiqun olam</em> - repairing the world\" found reconjugated in Aleinu (whether the word has a kaf or a quf depends on differing traditions) refers to a spiritual repair (assuming it is \"repair\", not a social one. Although it is possible the implication is a social repair that thereby engenders a spiritual one. But the phrase is \"<em>lesakein/lesaqein olam bemalkhus Shakai</em> -- to establish/repair the world into the kingdom of the One Who Set Limits, and all children of flesh will call in Your Name...\" So, if it meant action, it would be a call to prosletize, not social justice. It is generally taken to be about setting an example.</p>\n<p>The phrase tiqun olam as it appears in the mishnah and tosaefta, though, is indeed about social cohesion. See Mishnah Gitin 4:2-5:3, Edios 1:13; Tosefta Kesuvos 12:1, Gitin 3:8, Terumos 1:14-15. The contexts there involve the soundness of marriage and divorce; pruzbul to make loans to the poor more common; not leaving a slave in half-enslaved half-free limbo; not overpaying for captives so as to avoid making hostage taking too tempting; nor for a Torah scroll, tefillin or mezuzah in the hands of a likely thief, to prevent a market enticing more such thefts... The first 12 are all to protect the have-nots. Gittin 33a explains another case seimilarly, with a debate as to whom the have-not is.</p>\n<p>So, while there is grounds for associating tiqun/tikun olam with social justice, all the examples are within Jewish society. Even though the expression is about \"olam\", the world.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is because our social responsibilities start with those closest to us. If two people are in the desert, and one of them has water but just enough for one person, we follow Rabbi Aqiva that the person is supposed to take the water for themselves. (Bava Metzia 62a) And when figuring out the proper \"triage\" for whom to give charity to, one's child (an adult offspring) comes first, then one's parents, one's other relatives, the poor of one's hometown, etc.. Rav Herschel Schachter taught (I do not know if this is recorded anywhere) that in today's world of telecommunications and rapid travel, \"our city\" has to also taken metaphorically -- not just those closer to us in geography, but also in our social circles regardless of location. See the Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Dei'ah siman 251 for these laws of priority. In fact, the law we saw in the Rambam about \"supporting [non-Jewish] poor among the poor of Israel\" is placed in this context (Ibid, se'if 13).</p>\n<p>Our social responsibility starts with those closest to ourselves, in ever-widening circles of concern. So, in terms of triage -- family, friends, our sub-community of Jews, all Jews, and only then non-Jews.</p>\n<p>Rav Shimon Shkop wrote that this is because <em>chesed</em> (lovingkindness) is not an act of abnegation, but of extending one's self and one's natural self-interest to include an ever broadening definition of \"me and mine\" (introduction to Shaarei Yosher, translation mine, emphasis added). Note how far our we get before we talk about social justice for the general world:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although at first glance it seems that feelings of love for oneself and feelings of love for others are like competing co-wives one to the other, we have the duty to try to delve into it, to find the means to unite them, since Hashem expects both from us. This means [a person must] explain and accept the truth of the quality of his “I”, for with it the statures of [different] people are differentiated, each according to their level. The entire “I” of a coarse and lowly person is restricted only to his substance and body. Above him is someone who feels that his “I” is a synthesis of body and soul. And above him is someone who can include in his “I” all of his household and family. Someone who walks according to the way of the Torah, his “I” includes the whole Jewish people, since in truth every Jewish person is only like a limb of the body of the nation of Israel. And there are more levels in this of a person who is whole, who can connect his soul to feel that all of the world and worlds are his “I”, and he himself is only one small limb in all of creation. Then, his self-love helps him love all of the Jewish people <strong>and [even] all of creation</strong>.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, this idea is hinted at in Hillel’s words, as he used to say, “If I am not for me, who will be for me? And when I am for myself, what am I?” It is fitting for each person to strive to be concerned for himself. But with this, he must also strive to understand that “I am for myself, what am I?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so, the ideal great soul does have a self-interest in all of humanity. But there is so much work until we get there that takes higher urgency.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<h2>Reason 1 - General outlook</h2>\n\n<p>There are three general theoretical views to gentiles in Judaism, all backed up by Talmudic and Rabbinical sources:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They are intrinsically bad, idol worshipers, and therefore they will eventually \"evaporate\" (probably most Ultra Orthodox)</li>\n<li>They are potentially good and can be saved and brought to recognize Hashem as One G-d and Israel as His servants (<em>Chabad and some other movements</em>).</li>\n<li>They are neutral, more like the animal kingdom (<em>all the rest</em>)</li>\n<li>They are neutral, just like humans (<em>secular Jews, not a movement in Judaism</em>)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As you can see only a small part of observing Jews holds an opinion favoring helping the gentiles out.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 2 - \"Poor of your hometown first\"</h2>\n\n<p>According to the Jewish Law, the order of precedence in charity to poor and needy is as following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Family members (first immediate family and then broad)</li>\n<li>Jews of your local Jewish community (Shul, center etc)</li>\n<li>Jews of your hometown and then Jews of your country</li>\n<li>Jews of Israel and then the rest of the world (some say they precede others)</li>\n<li>Non-Jews</li>\n<li>Non humans and environmental needs (just kidding).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you start with some sum of money, it runs away quickly on the first 2-4 stages, so not much is left for others :(.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 3 - \"Don't give them for free\"</h2>\n\n<p>Opinions differ on meaning of this commandment, but many Poskim agree that Jews are forbidden from helping out the gentiles for free. (more on this <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> <em>English source needed</em>).</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 4 - Fear of bad influence and transgression</h2>\n\n<p>The Torah (and subsequently the Sages) prescribe us to keep away from gentiles as possible, not to learn from their rituals and culture, not to get close etc. Many Halakhic prohibitions (like on gentile bread, meat and more) stem from our fear of getting close and adopting their rituals and values and maybe even marrying them (Oy-vey).</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 5 - \"more Catholic than the Pope\"</h2>\n\n<p>Many Halakhic relations with gentiles are based on their own accepted norms. E.g. if returning lost property is not widely accepted by their (moral and civil) laws, we're not trying to be \"more Catholoc\". Same here, if most communities and countries do not worry about those needy, we Jews are not going to be the first in the line.</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 6 - Why do help</h2>\n\n<p>The only Halakhic permission to spend money and effort on gentiles, I can think of, is for the sake of other Jews or Jewish communities indirectly, thru \"give and take\" policy, which is called \"establishing peace\". Israel does it a lot, sending missions to all natural disaster places all over the world, to win their support for our state (I don't know if it really works, according to UN :()</p>\n\n<h2>Reason 7 - Chabad</h2>\n\n<p>Chabad Hassidic movement have more Kabbalic (than Halakhic) view on the ways of bringing the redemption, one of them by enlightening the gentiles with our Jewish Torah and values and building their acceptance of Judaism. I'm not one of them, and I didn't hear of their strict support for gentiles, but their attitude is far more open and accepting than the rest of the Jewish Orthodox world for sure.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>I don't bring sources on purpose to straightforward the answer.

The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kiddushin.3.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">third chapter</a> of Kiddushin has many cases of tenai when it comes to Kiddushin.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering if anyone holds its possible to do Nisuin, the final stage of marriage, aka Chuppah, with a tenai. For example, you say you want nisuin to work on condition she doesn't sleep that day. Or on condition she doesn't own a dog. If she does, they're still in the stage of erusin.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I ask is because I found two Achronim that try to prove that T'nai isn't possible by Nisuin.

The idea is reflected\n  in Exodus 21,14: “from My altar you shall remove him to die.” The\n  meaning of the verse is that even if the party concerned is a priest\n  involved in performing his priestly duties on the altar, he must be\n  removed and executed (Yuma 85).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Emphasis mine)</p>\n\n<p>How should I interpret the above? Certainly Rabbeinu Bachya cannot be condoning killing people. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are certain cases in which it is appropriate to kill someone, and certain cased in which killing is inappropriate. Typically appropriate killing would be legal executions. For discussion of when extrajudicial killing is justified see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/80324/8775\">here</a>. The quote doesn't say anything about which cases are which. Rather, it says that killing certain people is considered a great sacrifice. Presumably this refers to those people whom it is obligatory to kill. Indeed, the case at hand is one of the few cases in which killing may be justified (see the link).</p>\n\n<p>Also noteworthy in context is that as with most rabbinic quotes, they say more about the individuals saying them, then Judaism as a whole. This quote, for example, is rather obscure. Searching through a database of thousands books (Bar Ilan Responsa project version 23), yields just 11 results. It is therefore hard to clarify \"the Jewish approach to it\", given that it is an obscure statement without much clarification. We can, however, clarify which cases warrant extrajudicial killings, and which do not. The above link shows the limits of extrajudicial killing.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, statements about the value of human life, even the value of the lives of the wicked, are much easier to find in Jewish literature. For example, Man is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Additionally, even the bodies of executed criminals must be treated with certain dignity (Deuteronomy 21:22-3). The Talmud recounts that the angels wanted to praise God for destroying the Egyptians in the Sea of Reeds, but God angrily retorted: \"My creations are drowning in the sea, and you want to sing praise?!\" (Megillah 10b, Sanhedrin 39b). Additionally, the Mishna (Makkot 1:10) quotes R. Elazar ben Azarya as stating that a court that executes someone every seventy years is considered violent. R. Tarfon and R. Akiva say that if they were on the court no one would ever be executed. And speaking of the spilled blood of the wicked, the Mishna states that God mourns the spilled blood of the wicked (Sanhedrin 6:5, quoted in Hagiga 15b and Sanhedrin 46a).</p>\n\n<p>The quote in question need not necessarily contradict these classical Jewish sources (although it does unquestionably have a different tone). Indeed, Rabbenu Bahya himself references the teaching of Sanhedrin (6:5) in his commentary to Deut. (21:23). There are unquestionably cases in which someone must be killed. That in those cases, carrying out this deed is meritorious, doesn't seem so problematic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are cases where a community is punished for standing by when evil is committed. We are obligated to prevent it -- hopefully through rebuke or reconciliation (<em>tokhachah</em>) before the crime or sin, or by preventing a repeat, or by setting an example of one person so that the enormity of the offense is driven home.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Rambam (Hilkhos Melachim 9:14) codifies the law that under the Noachide covenant, everyone must set up a legal system and sourts. As an example, he gives Shim'on and Levi's attack on the city of Shechem after the chief's son (who was also named Shechem) raped her. (Genesis 34) He says the whole city was deserving of death because they failed in this duty to establish a rule of law. (And while the Ramban disagrees with this interpretation of the story of Shechem, it is because of Yaaqov's inaction and scolding. He disagrees with the correctness of the example, not the principle.)</p>\n\n<p>A community that does not execute those they know deserve it share in the sin. So, by killing the guilty, the city avoids that guilt. Thus there is a parallel to an atonement offering, which also erases culpability.</p>\n\n<p>Actual capital punishment is rare in Jewish Law because certainty that there is evil is hard to come by. So that one would be obligated to fulfill \"ובארת הרעה מקרבך -- and you shall burn out the evil from your midst\" (Devarim 17:7) or its Noachide equivalent in theory, and that's the value system. But there is a competing value of \"הוי דן את כל אדם לכף זכות -- judge all people on the side of merit\" (Avos 1:6) and to treat other Jews as having a \"חזכת כשרות -- a presumption of innocense\" that more often outweighs this value.</p>\n\n<p>And from this point, I would refer to to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/88527/1570\">Al Berko's answer</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Here's the source first.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/R1Qo9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/R1Qo9.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>To your question: you should interpret it as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabinu Bechaye holds an opinion that \"<em>spilling the blood of the wicked is considered as if he had offered a sacrifice\"</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nothing more. This is his <strong>book of interpretations, not Halakhic statements</strong>. He's allowed to hold any views whether they are accepted or rejected by other interpreters.</p>\n\n<p>Let me put it differently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabeynu Bechaye holds, that <strong>theoretically</strong> there can be a situation where an intentional murder of a Rasha is favorable in G-d's eyes on par with sacrifices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To practical implementations of this interpretation, the accepted approach to Rashoim is what's ruled in Brochos 10a, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruriah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the story of Beruria</a>, that said \"Let the sins be consumed from the earth, and the wicked shall be no more\" (Psalms 104:35), we should try make the Rashoim repent. If not possible, the closest to R\"B is what's ruled in Avoda Zorah 26b - \"מורידים ולא מעלים\" - we cause to take them down and not help them out. And this can only be made by a ruling of a Beis Din.</p>\n\n\n",

If the word וצמתם were used, it would not have expressed any of the prohibitions besides eating and drinking.</p>\n\n<p>This answer addresses the question of why the word ועניתם is used instead of וצמתם, assuming that fasting is included, rather than proving that fasting is included.</p>\n\n<p>Some users pointed out that this answer might be less compelling according to some opinions (the Rosh, which Heshy quoted from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yachin_on_Mishnah_Yoma.8.7.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tif'eret Yisra'el</a> to the Mishna) who hold that the afflictions besides eating and drinking are not forbidden from the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The gemara discusses at length in Masechet Yoma 74b the commandment of \"suffering\" ועניתם.The gemera asks how do we know the Torah didn't mean that one should sit in the sun all day!</p>\n\n<p>The gemara then enumerates a few baraytot that derive this law in various ways using exegesis.

The gemara then applies the rule of \"riba hakatuv\" which uses the unnecessary plural form to derive all foods, and not just those punishable by Karet.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Torah warns that one who does not keep this commandment will be destroyed והאבדתי את הנפש ההיא. From this consequence, the Gemara derives that the prohibition must involve something that can potentially be life threatening - not eating or drinking.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is a Gezera Shava גזירה שוה between ועיניתם and ויענך וירעיבך - being hungry.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is much to add to this discussion, if you are interested in delving deeper into these derivations I suggest you study the Gemara there with its commentaries</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Moshe deliberates whether the chocolate\n  or the raisin is more important in order to determine whether the\n  bracha on chocolate-covered raisins is Ha’eitz, like the raisin, or\n  Shehakol, like the chocolate. Rav Moshe concludes that neither the\n  chocolate nor the raisins can be considered of secondary importance\n  (tafeil) to the other, and therefore chocolate-covered raisins require\n  two brachos, Ha’eitz on the raisins and Shehakol on the chocolate.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Moshe then discusses which of the two brachos to recite first.\n  Usually, one should recite the bracha of Ha’eitz before reciting\n  Shehakol. However, Rav Moshe points out that one must eat the\n  chocolate before reaching the raisin; thus, the bracha on the\n  chocolate will have to be first. Rav Moshe concludes that the best\n  thing to do is to recite Ha’eitz on a regular raisin and then Shehakol\n  on the chocolate. (When this option does not exist, he paskins that\n  one should recite Shehakol on the chocolate and then Ha’eitz on the\n  raisin.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The way that I read this is to make the <em>shehakol</em> immediately followed by <em>haeitz</em> (in the case of a raisin) or <em>mezonos</em> (in the case of the Twix or Kit Kat bar) and then eat the two simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>There are other ways of handling the matter.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/guide-to-blessings/#desserts\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OU Guide to Blessings</a> cited at [Brachot 38 – Which blessing on a twix?] says that one <strong>can</strong> make the shehacol first deliberately excluding the wafer part and then making mezonos to include the wafer. After this eat the two together without a hefsek. This is similar to Rav Moshe's psak, but he does not appear to require that one explicitly excludes the wafer (or the raisin) from the shehakol.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you eat a candy bar containing fruit, nuts, wafers, or other\n  fillings because you specifically want to eat the filling, you should\n  say only the appropriate brachah for the filling. If, however, the\n  chocolate itself is just as important to you, first say Shehakol for\n  the chocolate (bearing in mind that you do not intend to include the\n  filling in this brachah), and then the appropriate brachah for the\n  filling (Igrot Moshe, Orach Chaim 3:31).</p>\n  \n  <p>This does not apply in the\n  case of wafers, since the chocolate is always considered a subordinate\n  ingredient in a candy bar with wafers, and therefore, only Mezonot\n  need be said (Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chaim 168:27).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=3101\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bracha on chocolate with wafer</a> says that it is really indeterminate.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Question:</strong> If a chocolate seems to consist mainly of wafer (eg kif-kef or Kit-Kat) should one say \"Mezonot?\" I assume that if there\n  is doubt concerning whether there is more chocolate or wafer one\n  should say \"Shehakol\"?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Though there is not universal agreement on this point, it seems the most common positions that if the majority is chocolate, it\n  is \"Shehakol\" and if the majority is wafer it is \"Mezonot\". Some hold\n  that since we eat the wafer for the chocolate and the wafer is just to\n  hold it together, it is always \"Shehakol\" while others argue that the\n  wafer also tastes good (sometimes) and therefore the rule that\n  \"Mezonot\" is dominant even when it is not the majority should apply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It appears that the advice given in the first location cited is to say</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As far as I can tell – there is no consensus. You could take the easy\n  route and not eat such chocolate bars/cakes ever again chas veshalom\n  or weigh up the above positions and decide for yourself.

    "content": "# What is the intention when we recite the blessing \"who didn't make me...\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are three blessings containing nine words which are grouped together in the morning blessings. Namely, 1) Who didn't make me a <em>goy</em> (גוי), 2) Who didn't make me a <em>servant</em> (עבד), and 3) who didn't make me a <em>woman/wife</em> (אשה).</p>\n\n<p>These are often explained to mean that the one saying the blessing is thankful for not being in this <em>negative</em> circumstance.</p>\n\n<p>And yet many examples are found where these are all considered to be positive, desirable and beneficial circumstances, like for example with <em>goy</em> in Bereshit <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12:2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.18.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18:18</a>, Shemot <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">19:6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32:10</a>, Devarim <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">26:5</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Or in the case of <em>servant</em> for example in Devarim <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10:12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.34.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34:5</a>, Yehoshua <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.22.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">22:2</a>,Yishayahu <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.42.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">42:1</a>, and Malachi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malachi.3.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:18</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And the absence of a wife is clearly undesirable like is found Bereshit <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:18</a>. And being a <em>wife</em> is given exceedingly high value like is found in Mishlei <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.12.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">12:4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.31.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">31:10</a>, and Ruth <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth.3.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:11</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya,_Devarim.33.1.2?vhe=Midrash_Rabbeinu_Bachya_[ben_Asher]._Warsaw,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bechaye to Devarim 33:1:2</a>. In fact in recounting the preciousness of Israel to G-d, it describes Israel as G-d's <em>wife</em> in Isaiah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.54.5-6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">54:5-6</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In that context, when the blessings recount <em>not making me</em> these things, what are we thankful for and why?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: I'm not sure how to edit this into my question and still have it make sense, but I have been asked to justify how my question is different from the linked question, \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/36902/7303\">Why don't we thank God for making us men/women?</a>\"</p>\n\n<p>On the simplest level, the linked question is asking about why we don't make the blessing <em>in the affirmative</em> like it says in the body of the question, \"<em>Why don't both men and women just thank God for making them the gender that they are?</em>\".  Also, the linked question doesn't make any connection to the other two negatively phrased blessings.</p>\n\n<p>The actual text of the three blessings is in the negative and contains nine words. My question is asking specifically about what is intended by this negative language in the blessings, especially in light of the idea that the three blessings are associated.</p>\n\n<p>The linked question relies upon the translation of אשה as woman as does the answer to that question which was awarded as correct. However, in reviewing the use of אשה in Tanach, it is more often taken to mean <strong>wife</strong>, not woman. <strong>Woman</strong>, meaning human <strong>female</strong>, is properly translated as נקבה, like in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.27?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:27</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5:2</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there are three terms which are used generally to describe humans by gender. The first, אנשים ונשים from the common root אנוש like in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.4.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 4:19</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.13.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13:8</a>, has a connotation of being associated with the profane like <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.4.26?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi explains to Bereshit 4:26</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The second term איש ואשה, like in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.29.32?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 29:32</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.30.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">30:15</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 2:22</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.20.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">20:12</a>. The  terms איש ואשה are related primarily to the state of being married, but also have a connotation of people who have refined themselves somewhat like in the expression איש גבר, meaning someone who has overcome their <em>individual</em> nature like is explained in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pele_Yoetz.359.13?vhe=Torat_Emet&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pele Yo'etz 359:13</a>. And this quality is essential to marriage.</p>\n\n<p>The third term אדם, as in דומה לעליון like Ramban explains to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.1.26.1?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:26:1</a>. This expression is used in its earliest form to refer to when the human male and female were unified as one, mentally, emotionally and physically as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.27?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi explains to Bereshit 1:27</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So the linked question, presumes the very limited and possibly even incorrect translation of אשה to mean human female. And in so doing, it limits the possible understanding of the blessing שלא עשני אשה to something which views women in a diminished state from men, as lesser than men whether in regard to the number of commandments they are allowed to observe or in their essential being.</p>\n\n<p>But among the Rishonim, one of the emphases is that these three blessings are specifically grouped together and are related in their intent. Their text is by many opinions, not to be altered.</p>\n\n<p>In that context and with more accurate understanding of the meaning of the words, my question is aimed at discovering a clearer comprehension of the true intent behind these three associated blessings and their negative language, particularly as it relates to what G-d expects of us in our service (עבודת העבד לקונה הכל) to Him.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The whole point is that we are not thanking Hashem for not keeping his promise and making us a <em>great nation</em> but that we are thanking him for not making us members of the other nations. We are not thanking Hashem for not making us an <em>eved Hashem</em> (something we all strive to be), but for not making us a slave of human beings (eved cna'ani) who is not completely Jewish. We are not thanking him for not providing us with a wife or not making us a <em>married woman</em>, but that we have more mitzvos as a man than as a <em>generic</em> Jewish woman. That is why a woman thanks Hashem שעשני כרצונו. </p>\n\n<p>You misunderstand the fact that the translations of the brachos have a different meaning based on the context. Thus the bracha of גוי means a <em>nonJewish person</em> (an individual who is a member of one of the <strong>other</strong> nations) while the context of (as an example)<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8176#v=2&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishis 12:2</a> is <em>a great nation</em> using גוי as a generic description rather than as an individual. This is the same as the other examples that you bring. They do not apply to the barachos.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the usage of אשה as <em>a woman</em> is not the same as the usage as <em>wife</em> and does not refer to that. That is why it is a matter of referring to the מצות of any woman rather than just the idea of a married woman.</p>\n\n<p>Again the phrase שלא עשני עבד int the context of the bracha does <strong>not</strong> refer to someone who is an <em>eved Hashem</em> or even an <em>eved Ivri</em>. The bracha <strong>in the context of the bracha</strong> refers solely to an <em>eved cna'ani</em>. Each of the brachos is a short hand way of referring to a particular context. While the Hebrew uses the same word in different contexts, or the translations use the same English word, the differing contexts show a completely different meaning.</p>\n\n<p>The brachos are short hand phrases to thank Hashem for not making us the lower levels, which is also why they are in the negative and each one implies thanks for a <em>higher</em> level of מצות </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>but we are not making the blessings in \"that context\"<br>\nwe are making them in the context of:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Goy</strong> meaning a non-jew<br>\n(We are thankful that we have 613 commandments on not only 7)<br>\nBut your context is about the jewish nation (not about a non-jew)   </li>\n<li><strong>Woman</strong> meaning a Jewish woman or wife (as in your sources)<br>\n(We are thankful that we have 613 commandments and not only the ones a woman has)<br>\nIf i am not mistaken your context does not contradict this</li>\n<li><strong>Slave</strong>  meaning a non-jewish slave belonging to a jew<br>\n(We are thankful: <strong>1.</strong> that we are not slaves of a human, or <strong>2.</strong> that we have 613 commandments and not only the ones a woman has (he has <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/86515/5120\">~the same commandment as a woman</a>),<br>\nBut is this not covered by the blessing for not making us a woman (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Menachot.43b.59\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rashi</a>: <strong>1.</strong> a wife is similar to a slave (see bais shmuel <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beit_Shmuel.85.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">85.2</a>),  or <strong>2.</strong> about mitsvos by the woman (#2 above)),<br>\nWe are adding this blessing because either  <strong>1.</strong> being a slave is more contemptible (we prefer being a woman than a slave) and we are additionally thankful for that or <strong>2.</strong> just to add a blessing to have a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.43b.38\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">total of 3</a> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Menachot.44a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rashi</a>)<br>\nBut your context is about being a slave to G-d (not to a human)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Their answer is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One should try lechatchilah to daven in a minyan that finishes before\n  chatzos, but bedieved it is better to stay at Shul and pray with a\n  minyan. (Some say the 6 hours from when you got up not chatzos, some\n  say a drink is enough and most people drink before davening).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Their Sources:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>O:CH 288:1 MIshnah Berurah 1,  Magen Avrohom O:CH 157:1 ibid Pri\n  Megodim Eshel Avrohom 3, Mateh Efrayim 597 Elef Hamogen 2</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, you should also view O:CH 288:1 MIshnah Berurah 2 that cites sources that are lenient regarding the rule against fasting on Shabbat that it doesn't apply to someone who is davening. The key, though, is to keep in mind that <em>chatzot</em> is based on <em>sha'ot zemaniyot</em>. So, this is a concern moreso during the winter, as the Mishnah Berurah states. During the summer, it seems that there would be no priority at all, as the fasting concern isn't even there.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, the arrow paradox notes that at any given point in time, an arrow in flight is motionless. Accordingly, it never moves. Importantly, it too does not address worrying.</p>\n\n<p>One interesting older source that connects the nature of past, present, and future to behaviour, is the <a href=\"https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.131.than.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bhaddekaratta Sutta</a> which cites Buddha as saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is past</p>\n  \n  <p>is left behind.</p>\n  \n  <p>The future</p>\n  \n  <p>is as yet unreached.</p>\n  \n  <p>Whatever quality is present</p>\n  \n  <p>you clearly see right there</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This has a different conclusion though. Rather than not worrying about the present, as it is part of a life composed of fleeting insignificant infinitesimals, we are encouraged to embrace the present given the insignificance of the past and future. In context, this is somewhat similar teaching of אם לא עכשיו אימתי.</p>\n\n<p>This is more similar to the Rav's take (cited there) that one must focus on the present.</p>\n\n\n",

The examples are numerous.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now some discussion on the topic: I understand your question is about avoiding Aginut (or maybe Mamzerut also) by applying a condition that will annul a marriage retrospectively. For example - \"You are Mekudeshet if you won't cheat on me\", or \"You're Mekudeshet if I don't loose contact with you for more that a year\". Once the condition is violated, the marriage will be withdrawn retrospectively.</p>\n\n<p>I was sitting on this Sugya for about a month with my Chevruta. I'm bad citing names but most Rishonim and Achronim can not agree on a couple of basic definitions. The main being the meaning of \"<strong>כל המקדש אדעתא דרבנן מקדש\"</strong>. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some claim that דרבנן means only the Gemmora, and what's not ruled there we can not change. Others claim every Beis Din has the power of setting its own conditions (e.g. in medieval Europe - I don't remember who mentions that) it was accepted that a marriage will not be held (i.g. valid) in less than a Minyan. </p></li>\n<li><p>Another problem is the Kesubah - if the marriage is annulled - there's no obligation for paying Kesubah. Poskim disagree on this also.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another problem is the legal status of their previous saxual relations with Kiddushin annulled - was it Znus, was she a Pilegesh, is she now Muteret to a Cohen etc. Poskim disagree widely on this also.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another problem is it is not clear whether the couple can have Nissuin (relations) while Kiddushin were on condition. Poskim disagree on this also, so there's a serious problem of Yihud in conditional marriage.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another problem is that this opens a wild opportunity of transgressing, knowing that nothing serious will follow. A man can disappear, a woman can cheat etc - we're not so sure we like this option.</p></li>\n<li><p>Another problem is whether an active decision of a respectable Beis Din is needed to actually annul a conditional marriage or it annuls itself, like there was no marriage in the first place. It is not so clear from the Gemmorah and the Poskim disagree.</p></li>\n<li><p>The biggest problem (in my opinion) is that although we have numerous examples of stipulations from the Gemmorah to Shulkhan Aruch, <strong>it was never practiced. I could not find a single Posek that arranges or witnesses a conditional marriage.</strong> We would all love to find a better solution to numerous problems (e.g. Olim couples from secular countries that come to Israel have an unclear status etc) but we don't have a tradition for suddenly conditioning a marriage.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hope this will help to understand the Sugya.</p>\n\n\n",

Rash\"i further explains that first Moshe should relate to Aharon what G-d told him, then Aharon relays the message to Pharaoh.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at the later verses prior to nearly each plague, G-d tells Moshe \"Go to Pharaoh and say to him...\" He seems to be telling Moshe to directly talk to Pharaoh, not Aharon.</p>\n\n<p>Also, when Pharaoh calls Moshe and Aharon back to remove the plague, it seems like Moshe is answering Pharaoh, directly.</p>\n\n<p>Another \"puzzle\", here - In <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=96&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 7:17</a>, the speaker says, \"Behold I will hit with the rod that is in my hand on the Nile waters and they will change to blood.\"</p>\n\n<p>We see later in verse 19, that Aharon uses a rod (it's unclear if he used Moshe's rod or Aharon also had his own rod, which he used) and it is Aharon that strikes the rod, not Moshe. If Aharon was the one speaking to Pharaoh, then, what he said seems consistent, assuming that he also had his own rod, or if he was holding Moshe's rod when he spoke.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like some clarification on who spoke to Pharaoh and when? Did Moshe <strong>ever</strong> speak to Pharaoh? Or was it that Aharon spoke only to tell him the message about an upcoming plague. But, to remove the plague, Moshe spoke to him? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R. Avraham ben HaRambam mentions in his commentary (7:1) that according to some commentators, such as R. Sa'adya Gaon, Moshe was healed of his impediment at some point; possibly while still in Egypt, as suggested by the fact that an interlocutor is not mentioned in his communications. He cites Ibn Ezra, however, who writes that Moshe was never healed, and he always spoke through Aharon, although the Torah frequently doesn't say that his speech was indirect.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are multiple ways to read Exodus (7:17), so it isn't a proof one way or the other about whether Aharon always spoke for Moshe to Pharaoh. Although the implication is that the one speaking to Pharaoh would strike the water, and the later verse (7:19) implies that Aharon was to strike it, we are not forced to conclude that Aharon was the one speaking to Pharaoh. Earlier verses (7:14) imply that Moshe is being spoken to; not Aharon. Accordingly, the instruction to tell Pharaoh \"I will strike the water\" is understood by HaKtav V'HaKabbalah (7:17) as meaning that Moshe said that he would cause the water to be stricken (by Aharon). This is the understanding of Paneah Razza (Parashat B'Shalah s.v. umat'kha) as well.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Ibn Ezra reads 7:17 as stating that God will say that he will strike the water with the staff in His hand! That is, that God will strike the water through his messenger's holding the staff. Accordingly, there is no evidence whether the speaker is Moshe or Aharon. R. DZ Hoffman follows this reading as well.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, although Moshe was instructed to tell Aharon to strike the river, 7:20 says that Moshe and Aharon did what they were commanded, and then the verse speaks of hitting the river. On this basis, R. Yitshak Abravanel (Parashat Vaera ch. 7 s.v. Vayomer) suggests that they both struck the river. Thus, in telling Pharaoh that \"I will strike the river\", it possible that Moshe was speaking of himself.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, 7:17 is sufficiently vague that even ignoring Ibn Ezra's read that it is God who would strike the river, we have no proof for who was speaking to Pharaoh. It could have been Moshe saying that he would strike it himself (as per Abravanel), or it could have been Aharon saying he would strike it himself. Or it could have been Moshe saying that he would strike it through Aharon (as per HaKtav V'Hakabbalah) or it could have been Aharon speaking for Moshe saying that Moshe would strike it.</p>\n\n\n",

Note also Hoshea (12:11) with Radak's commentary, and Zecharia (9:16) with Radak's commentary, in which ביד is used outsides the context of prophecy, or hands.

Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said to her, in a seemingly unrelated response: Does your father keep his wine in simple clay vessels? The emperor’s daughter said to him: Rather, in what, then, should he keep it? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said to her: You, who are so important, should put it in vessels of gold and silver.</p>\n  \n  <p>אזלה ואמרה ליה לאבוה רמייא לחמרא במני דהבא וכספא ותקיף אתו ואמרו ליה אמר לה לברתיה מאן אמר לך הכי אמרה ליה רבי יהושע בן חנניה קריוהו אמר ליה אמאי אמרת לה הכי אמר ליה כי היכי דאמרה לי אמרי לה והא איכא שפירי דגמירי</p>\n  \n  <p>The emperor’s daughter went and said this to her father. He put the wine in vessels of gold and silver and it turned sour. When his advisors came and told the emperor that the wine had turned sour, he said to his daughter: Who told you to do this? His daughter responded: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya. The emperor summoned him and said to him: Why did you say this to her? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said to him: Just as she said to me, so I said say to her, to demonstrate to her that fine material is best preserved in the least of vessels. The emperor said to him: But there are handsome people who are learned.</p>\n  \n  <p>אי הוו סנו טפי הוו גמירי דבר אחר מה שלשה משקין הללו אין נפסלין אלא בהיסח הדעת אף דברי תורה אין משתכחין אלא בהיסח הדעת</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yehoshua replied: Had they been ugly, they would have been even more learned. Alternatively, the Torah is likened to water, wine, and milk because just as these three liquids are spoiled only by diversion of attention, so too, are Torah matters forgotten only through diversion of attention. If water, wine and milk are guarded, they will not spoil or have dirty objects fall into them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.7a.18?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi says there</a> that ugly Talmidei Chachamim are wiser because they are humble and it is (almost) impossible for a good looking person to avoid haughtiness so he will come to forget from his learning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי היכי דאמרה לי - אי חכמה מפוארה בכלי מכוער הכי אמרי לה דיין משתמר בכלי מכוער אף התורה מתקיימת בי יותר משאילו הייתי נאה:</p>\n  \n  <p>אי הוו סנו - אותם נאים שהם חכמים:</p>\n  \n  <p>טפי הוו גמירי - שאי אפשר לנאה להשפיל דעתו ובא לידי שכחה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also see the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.20a.16-20b.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara in Taanis 20a-b</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנו רבנן לעולם יהא אדם רך כקנה ואל יהא קשה כארז מעשה שבא רבי אלעזר (בן ר') שמעון ממגדל גדור מבית רבו והיה רכוב על החמור ומטייל על שפת נהר ושמח שמחה גדולה והיתה דעתו גסה עליו מפני שלמד תורה הרבה</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages further taught in praise of the reed: A person should always be soft like a reed, and he should not be stiff like a cedar. An incident occurred in which Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, came from Migdal Gedor, from his rabbi’s house, and he was riding on a donkey and strolling on the bank of the river. And he was very happy, and his head was swollen with pride because he had studied much Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>נזדמן לו אדם אחד שהיה מכוער ביותר אמר לו שלום עליך רבי ולא החזיר לו אמר לו ריקה כמה מכוער אותו האיש שמא כל בני עירך מכוערין כמותך אמר לו איני יודע אלא לך ואמור לאומן שעשאני כמה מכוער כלי זה שעשית כיון שידע בעצמו שחטא ירד מן החמור ונשתטח לפניו ואמר לו נעניתי לך מחול לי אמר לו איני מוחל לך עד שתלך לאומן שעשאני ואמור לו כמה מכוער כלי זה שעשית</p>\n  \n  <p>He happened upon an exceedingly ugly person, who said to him: Greetings to you, my rabbi, but Rabbi Elazar did not return his greeting. Instead, Rabbi Elazar said to him: Worthless [reika] person, how ugly is that man. Are all the people of your city as ugly as you? The man said to him: I do not know, but you should go and say to the Craftsman Who made me: How ugly is the vessel you made. When Rabbi Elazar realized that he had sinned and insulted this man merely on account of his appearance, he descended from his donkey and prostrated himself before him, and he said to the man: I have sinned against you; forgive me. The man said to him: I will not forgive you go until you go to the Craftsman Who made me and say: How ugly is the vessel you made.</p>\n  \n  <p>היה מטייל אחריו עד שהגיע לעירו יצאו בני עירו לקראתו והיו אומרים לו שלום עליך רבי רבי מורי מורי אמר להם למי אתם קורין רבי רבי אמרו לו לזה שמטייל אחריך אמר להם אם זה רבי אל ירבו כמותו בישראל אמרו לו מפני מה אמר להם כך וכך עשה לי אמרו לו אעפ\"כ מחול לו שאדם גדול בתורה הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>He walked behind the man, trying to appease him, until they reached Rabbi Elazar’s city. The people of his city came out to greet him, saying to him: Greetings to you, my rabbi, my rabbi, my master, my master. The man said to them: Who are you calling my rabbi, my rabbi? They said to him: To this man, who is walking behind you. He said to them: If this man is a rabbi, may there not be many like him among the Jewish people. They asked him: For what reason do you say this? He said to them: He did such and such to me. They said to him: Even so, forgive him, as he is a great Torah scholar.</p>\n  \n  <p>אמר להם בשבילכם הריני מוחל לו ובלבד שלא יהא רגיל לעשות כן מיד נכנס רבי אלעזר בן רבי שמעון ודרש לעולם יהא אדם רך כקנה ואל יהא קשה כארז ולפיכך זכה קנה ליטול הימנה קולמוס לכתוב בו ספר תורה תפילין ומזוזות:</p>\n  \n  <p>He said to them: For your sakes I forgive him, provided that he accepts upon himself not to become accustomed to behave like this. Immediately, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, entered the study hall and taught: A person should always be soft like a reed and he should not be stiff like a cedar, as one who is proud like a cedar is likely to sin. And therefore, due to its gentle qualities, the reed merited that a quill is taken from it to write with it a Torah scroll, phylacteries, and mezuzot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I'd really like some kind of concise guide, or even just a list, of the blessings/prayers and other activities involved in an observant Jewish life on a normal weekday so I can start incorporating them into my routine. As in, what do I do from the moment I wake up and say modeh ani til I go to bed (or at least through the morning)?

Why is this? The <em>pesach</em> was brought after the afternoon <em>tamid</em> which was otherwise the last <em>korban</em> of the day; this <em>zav</em> won't, then, have his <em>ziva</em>-‎<em>korbanos</em> brought that day and won't be able to eat from the <em>pesach</em>, so why is it being slaughtered for him?

    "content": "# How were the Rabbis allowed to trick Karkamit?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Akavya ben Mehallel, <em>Eduyot</em> 5:6 states that a freed maidservant was made to drink fake sotah water (this is how most commentators interpret the phrase). I assume, though I have not seen any commentaries which would support or disagree, that they put this woman through the rest of the Sotah process, including making her take an oath. </p>\n\n<p>My question is: How were the Rabbis allowed to do this? If she was someone who met all the criteria for the sotah trial (accused by her husband with witnesses, etc.), then were they not obligated to actually perform the ritual ?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, part of the ritual is making her take an oath. If the ritual was not really being performed, did they make her take an oath in vain? Were they liable for damages such as embarrassment that are done as part of the ritual? Would this be considered genayvat da'at and, if so, why was this done at all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I don't believe that is how the Mishna is to be read but rather there was a disagreement over whether or not a maidservant is someone who can be considered qualified for the sotah process. Akavya held that she was not. To refute Akavya's position those arguing with him citing an actual incident (maaseh) which contradicted Akavya's opinion. In response to that Akavya posited that the incident in question must have been merely for show. In stating they made her drink a 'doogmah' he was reflecting back on the entire sotah process as being for show. Ostensibly then all your questions are removed. They likely would not have made her swear in God's name in vain in such a situation. Furthermore there are other examples in Chazal (I will find them shortly) of the right of the Rabbis to bend the rules so to speak in order to prevent the moral decay of society, hence even if it was geneivat daat, it was done in a permissible way. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><em>If she was someone who met all the criteria for the sotah trial (accused by her husband with witnesses, etc.), then were they not obligated to actually perform the ritual?</em></p>\n\n<p>The reason Akavyah ben Mahalalel said this was precisely because he held a freed maidservant does not meet the criteria for the sotah trial. They tried to refute his position with an actual example of where a freed maidservant was given sotah-water to drink, and he dismissed the story, according to one interpretation, by saying there they had simply mimicked the ritual, and the water wasn't really sotah-water.</p>\n\n<p><em>Furthermore, part of the ritual is making her take an oath. If the ritual was not really being performed, did they make her take an oath in vain?</em></p>\n\n<p>The Raav says on the Mishnah that the reason Akavyah ben Mahalalel held that a freed maidservant does not meet the criteria for the sotah trial is because he held that the part of the oath in which the <em>Am</em> of the Yisroel is called the <em>Am</em> of the woman is inapplicable to the freed maidservant, because of the specific connotations of the word <em>Am</em>. The Torah prescribes the exact wording of the oath, so if even one word is inapplicable, it cannot be administered on a Torah level.</p>\n\n<p>If so, Akavyah would probably say they either omitted the oath entirely, or they made her take an oath without the word <em>Am</em>. Even if they made her swear, it would not have been in vain. This oath would serve a purpose, just not the full traditional sotah purpose. </p>\n\n<p><em>Were they liable for damages such as embarrassment that are done as part of the ritual?</em></p>\n\n<p>Probably not. There is a general principle that that the houses of law or the heads of the people have power over the people's pecuniary interests (Yevamos 89b, הפקר ב\"ד הפקר). Those who gave this woman to drink had the ability to immunize themselves from liability.</p>\n\n<p><em>Would this be considered genayvat da'at and, if so, why was this done at all?</em></p>\n\n<p>Geneivas da'as is not simply not being straight-up with someone, and sometimes circumstances justify not being 100% straight-up with someone. The classic case of geneivas da'as is causing someone to harbor gratitude towards you for doing something for them when in fact you did not do anything for them (see Chullin 94). It is stealing the appreciation, not just withholding the truth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<h1>The Mishnah in question<sup>1</sup></h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוּא הָיָה אוֹמֵר, אֵין מַשְׁקִין לֹא אֶת הַגִּיֹּרֶת וְלֹא אֶת שִׁפְחָה הַמְשֻׁחְרֶרֶת. וַחֲכָמִים אוֹמְרִים, מַשְׁקִין. אָמְרוּ לוֹ, מַעֲשֶׂה בְּכַרְכְּמִית, שִׁפְחָה מְשֻׁחְרֶרֶת שֶׁהָיְתָה בִירוּשָׁלַיִם, וְהִשְׁקוּהָ שְׁמַעְיָה וְאַבְטַלְיוֹן. אָמַר לָהֶם, דֻּגְמָא הִשְׁקוּהָ. וְנִדּוּהוּ, וּמֵת בְּנִדּוּיוֹ, וְסָקְלוּ בֵית דִּין אֶת אֲרוֹנוֹ. אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוּדָה, חַס וְשָׁלוֹם שֶׁעֲקַבְיָא נִתְנַדָּה...</p>\n  \n  <p>He would say: One may not make a converted woman nor a freed maidservant drink [from the \"bitter waters\" that were drunk by a woman suspected of adultery as a test]. But the Sages say: [They are] made to drink. They said to him: There was the case of Karkamit, a freed maidservant in Jerusalem, who was made to drink by Shama'ya and Avtalyon! He said to them: They made her drink an \"example\" [i.e. the \"bitter waters\" they made her drink were not authentic]. They excommunicated him, and he died in excommunication, and the Court stoned his coffin. Said Rabbi Yehudah: God-forbid [one should say] that Akavya was excommunicated... </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Were the Rabbis allowed to not do the proper procedure?</h1>\n\n<h2>The Rambam</h2>\n\n<p>The Rambam (to this Mishnah) explains the segue between these two parts of the Mishnah, and he touches on your question in the process:<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואומר שגיורת משוחררת אין משקין אותה מי סוטה וכשהביאו ראיה ממה שעשו שמעיה ואבטליון אמר שהם לא השקוה מי סוטה על אמיתתה אבל עשו תחבולה שחשבה שהן מי סוטה והם כדמות מי סוטה ודוגמא הוא הדמיון ועשו זה לפי שהיתה גיורת<sup>3</sup> והם גרים וכאילו הם לא סברו להרחיקה להסתפחה בדת ישראל וקשה זה הדבר על החכמים על שלעג עליהם ונדוהו:</p>\n  \n  <p>And [Akavia ben Mehallalel] said that a convert [and] a freed woman - we do not make her drink the Sotah waters. When they brought a proof from that which Shamayah and Avtalyon did [i.e. the incident with Karkamit], he said that they did not make her drink the Sotah waters over her truth, but they made a ploy that she thought that they were Sotah waters, and they appeared like Sotah waters. They had made an \"example,\" and they did this because she was a convert<sup>3</sup> and they were converts, and they didn't want to distance her and cut her off from the Jewish religion. This matter was so hard for the Chachamim [to believe] until they cried out over it and excommunicated him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it seems that according to the Rambam, the Chachamim had the same problem with Akavia's opinion that you had. But we still need to understand Akavia's opinion.<sup>4</sup></p>\n\n<h2>Tosfos</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps Tosfos (Berachos 19a, s.v. דוגמא) can shed some light on this (this is just the relevant part of Tosfos):<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא מחקו התורה עליה אלא ליראה אותה</p>\n  \n  <p>They only erased the Torah for her to scare her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Tosfos, there is no need for <em>anything</em> to be erased into the waters according to Akavia. The main part is that she should be scared if she actually is guilty. </p>\n\n<p>But, didn't my [some number between 1 and 12]<sup>th</sup> grade Chumash teacher tell us that it was Hashem's Name erased into the waters that gave them their miraculous properties? Sure he did. That's because the Rambam paskens like the Chachamim (Hil. Sotah 2:6).</p>\n\n<p>So why did they not put her through the proper procedure? Well, according to Akavia's position, as understood by Tosfos, they did. There was nothing wrong with doing that.</p>\n\n<p>I would assume, however, that based on Akavia's argument that they were just going through the motions to not push her away, this is not the ideal way of doing things, even if it is valid.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Was it an oath in vain?</h1>\n\n<h2>The oath</h2>\n\n<p>Bamidbar 5:19-22:<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִם־לֹ֨א שָׁכַ֥ב אִישׁ֙ אֹתָ֔ךְ וְאִם־לֹ֥א שָׂטִ֛ית טֻמְאָ֖ה תַּ֣חַת אִישֵׁ֑ךְ הִנָּקִ֕י מִמֵּ֛י הַמָּרִ֥ים הַֽמְאָרֲרִ֖ים הָאֵֽלֶּה וְאַ֗תְּ כִּ֥י שָׂטִ֛ית תַּ֥חַת אִישֵׁ֖ךְ וְכִ֣י נִטְמֵ֑את וַיִּתֵּ֨ן אִ֥ישׁ בָּךְ֙ אֶת־שְׁכָבְתּ֔וֹ מִֽבַּלְעֲדֵ֖י אִישֵֽׁךְ ... יִתֵּ֨ן יְהוָ֥ה אוֹתָ֛ךְ לְאָלָ֥ה וְלִשְׁבֻעָ֖ה בְּת֣וֹךְ עַמֵּ֑ךְ בְּתֵ֨ת יְהוָ֤ה אֶת־יְרֵכֵךְ֙ נֹפֶ֔לֶת וְאֶת־בִּטְנֵ֖ךְ צָבָֽה וּ֠בָאוּ הַמַּ֨יִם הַמְאָרְרִ֤ים הָאֵ֙לֶּה֙ בְּֽמֵעַ֔יִךְ לַצְבּ֥וֹת בֶּ֖טֶן וְלַנְפִּ֣ל יָרֵ֑ךְ</p>\n  \n  <p>If no man has lain with you, if you have not gone astray in defilement while married to your husband, be immune to harm from these bitter waters of bitterness. But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and have defiled yourself, if a man other than your husband has had carnal relations with you...may the LORD make you a curse and an imprecation among your people, as the LORD causes your thigh to sag and your belly to distend; may this water that induces the spell enter your body, causing the belly to distend and the thigh to sag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is any part of this oath not being fulfilled by not having the proper text dissolved in it? Well, remember, according to Akavia, there's no issue with having the \"wrong\" text dissolved. But even so, read the oath more closely. If she is innocent, these waters will do nothing to her. If she is guilty, she'll explode from drinking them. Ultimately, the issue revolves around how you translate the \"bitter waters.\" While the Chachamim require a Megillas Sotah to be dissolved in the waters to fulfill that criterion, Akavia doesn't, as we noted above. If you're still not convinced, let me quote an earlier part of the above Tosfos that I skipped:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בערוך פירש דוכמא השקוה מי צבע אבל לא היו מרים ממש</p>\n  \n  <p>In the Aruch [the phrase \"they gave her Dugma to drink\"] is explained [as] \"they gave her Duchma to drink,\" [i.e.] colored water, but they were not literally bitter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, we see that according to Akavia, the term \"bitter waters\" can be taken <em>extremely</em> loosely.</p>\n\n<h2>Is this even a \"real\" oath?</h2>\n\n<p>Another avenue that should be explored is if this is even an oath in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>The (previously uncited) conclusion of v. 22 states that the woman responds \"Amen, amen\" to this oath. The Gemara in Shevuos (29b and 36a) learns from this that if Reuven adjures Shimon to make an oath, and Shimon responds \"Amen,\" it is as if Shimon made the oath himself, and if Shimon violates it, he is punished accordingly. The Rambam (Hil. Shevuos 2:1 et. al.) and the Shulchan Aruch (YD 237:2) both pasken thus. So clearly this is a valid oath.</p>\n\n<h2>What kind of Shevuah is this?</h2>\n\n<p>Just for completion's sake, let's take a look at Hilchos Shevuah.</p>\n\n<p>I'm going to be nitpicky, because this could make a difference. There are two types of oaths that are often confused with one another. A \"vain oath\" is one who swears regarding something impossible, or regarding something which is known to be false, or regarding violating a mitzvah, or regarding violating a previous oath. An ordinary oath (an \"oath of utterance\") is one who swears regarding an event in the future or the past, regarding its occurrence or non-occurrence. This is all discussed in the third chapter of Maseches Shevuos.</p>\n\n<p>Technically speaking, the oath of a Sotah would not be a vain oath, but rather your run-of-the-mill oath regarding something happening or not happening in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Well, regardless of what kind of water this is, would it not be a valid oath? If she's guilty, she'll blow up. If she's innocent, she won't. Remember, according to Akavia, the contents of the water don't matter.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Were they liable for embarrassment?</h1>\n\n<p>Again, according to Akavia, this was a perfectly valid way of doing the procedure. Nowhere do we find that embarrassment payments are given for an ordinary Sotah, so why should this be different? Further, she would still be eligible to the bracha given to innocent Sotos.<sup>5</sup></p>\n\n<p>But... We're not told in the Mishnah that she was innocent. Maybe she really did explode from the Sotah waters. In that case, this question is a moot point.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Is this Geneivas Da'as?</h1>\n\n<h2>What is Geneivas Da'as?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Geneivas Da'as</strong> (<em>gi•NAY•vas DA•as</em>, also <em>gi•nay•VAT da•AT</em>, etc.), <em>noun</em>.</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>Doing something for somebody for the sole intent of making them think something about you which is false. </p></li>\n  <li><p><em>Literally translated</em> Stealing one's knowledge</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p><em>Examples:</em> \"One is prohibited to steal the knowledge of any person, even the knowledge of a non-Jew. How so? One may not sell a non-Jew a Neveilah in the place of Shechted meat, nor hide from a dead animal in the place of a Shechted animal, nor may he beg his friend to eat by him when he knows he won't accept...\" <em>-Rambam, Hil. De'os 2:6, from Chullin 94a</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, according to the Rambam and the Gemara, you might be correct in saying that this is Geneivas Da'as, since they are giving her dyed water with a fake document rubbed into it, while she thinks that it's real Sotah water with a proper Megillas Sotah rubbed into it.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is still based on the false premise that this isn't real Sotah water. As we demonstrated above, this is real Sotah water according to Akavia, and so this isn't Geneivas Da'as. Sure, she thinks it's a proper Megillah rubbed into it, but ultimately this is real Sotah water.</p>\n\n<h2>Tricking Converts</h2>\n\n<p>Still, you could ask based on their intentions: they didn't want her going off the derech, so they faked her out with not-real-but-technically-real Sotah water. Perhaps that is Geneivas Da'as, as she doesn't know that they didn't <em>have</em> to do this, and they're only doing it to keep her on the derech?</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, there is a precedent for such a practice.</p>\n\n<p>Mishnah Demai 6:10:<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גֵּר וְגוֹי שֶׁיָּרְשׁוּ אֶת אֲבִיהֶם גּוֹי, יָכוֹל הוּא לוֹמַר, טֹל אַתָּה עֲבוֹדָה זָרָה וַאֲנִי מָעוֹת, אַתָּה יַיִן וַאֲנִי פֵרוֹת. וְאִם מִשֶּׁבָּאוּ לִרְשׁוּת הַגֵּר, אָסוּר:</p>\n  \n  <p>A convert and a non-Jew who inherit from their non-Jewish father: he [the convert] can say to him: \"You take the idol worship and I the money, you the wine and I the fruit.\" But if they have come into the possession of the convert, this is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Avodah Zarah 64a-b:<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>The Gemara is discussing what happens when one receives idolatrous items, and it attempted to bring a proof from the above Mishnah in Demai. The Gemara refutes this challenge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר פפא ירושת הגר קאמרת שאני ירושת הגר דאקילו בה רבנן גזירה שמא יחזור לקלקולו תניא נמי הכי<sup>6</sup> בד\"א שירשו אבל נשתתפו אסור</p>\n  \n  <p>Says Rav Pappa: You say the inheritance of a convert? Inheritance of a convert is different, for the Rabbis were lenient regarding it, as a decree lest he returns to his crookedness [i.e. he ditches Judaism for his inheritance]. We taught a Braisa similarly:<sup>6</sup> \"When are these words said [that the convert can make this stipulation]? When they inherit, but if they are partners, it is forbidden.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For reference, the same Mishnah, as well as Rav Pappa's reasoning and Braisa, are brought down in Kiddushin 17b as well.<sup>7</sup></p>\n\n<p>Clearly, then, the Rabbis decreed that Geneivas Da'as does not apply when it comes to keeping a convert Jewish. If that doesn't sit well with you, well, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/ask\">ask</a> away.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>Translation by Sefaria</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>My translation</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup>If you're unfamiliar with the procedure, when one buys a non-Jewish slave of either gender, they undergo conversion, and for the duration of their servitude, they have the same status in respect to what mitzvos they have as women, and upon their being freed, they are like converts in that respect. Nevertheless, there are several halachic differences between converts and freed slaves (see the last Mishnah in Horayos for one example). As will be discussed several times in this post, there is good reason why she is referred to as a convert rather than a freed slave, as that is the reason why they went through this procedure.</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup>It should be noted that other commentaries say that the Chachamim thought Akavia was denigrating Shamayah and Avtalyon's honor, and that's why they excommunicated him. This is also the explanation given in Berachos 19a. But the Rambam thinks it's a good question, anyway.</p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup>See Rashi, Bamidbar 5:28, quoting Sotah 26a that an innocent Sotah is blessed to be fertile, to have children more easily, and that they should be more beautiful than the ones she's had.</p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup>I am unfamiliar with the source of this Braisa. While a parallel teaching to the Mishnah does appear in Tosefta Demai, 6:12, its only addition to this teaching is that Onkelos was stringent upon himself and threw his entire inheritance into the sea. It then switches to bathhouses, a discussion dealt with elsewhere in Avodah Zarah.</p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup>While the statement in Kiddushin is attributed to Rava, note that Rava was Rav Pappa's Rebbe. Clearly, then, when Rav Pappa said his statement, he learned it from his Rebbe.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reversal of the number of positive and negative precepts\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Makkos <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=25&daf=23b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">23b</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דרש רבי שמלאי שש מאות ושלש עשרה מצות נאמרו לו למשה שלש מאות וששים וחמש\n  לאוין כמנין ימות החמה ומאתים וארבעים ושמונה עשה כנגד איבריו של אדם</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Simlai when preaching said: Six hundred and thirteen precepts were\n  communicated to Moses three hundred and sixty-five negative precepts\n  corresponding to the number of solar days [in the year] and two\n  hundred and forty-eight positive precepts, corresponding to the number\n  of the members of man's body. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Makkoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_ben_Avraham_of_Przemy%C5%9Bl\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe ben Avraham of Przemyśl</a> (died 1606) in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40439&st=&pgnum=17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to <em>Mateh Moshe</em></a> reverses this and states that there are 365 positive precepts and 248 negative precepts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי ברא אותו מחובר ברמ\"ח אברים ושס\"ה גידין וכנגדן צוה צורינו <strong>שס\"ה עשין</strong>\n  <strong>ורמ\"ח לאוין</strong> להורות כי לא נברא האדם רק לשמור ולעשות ולקיים את כל הדברים\n  האלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would think that this is simply a mistake; however it is a particularly egregious mistake for a renowned rabbinic figure to make. Most tinokos shel beis rabban know that there are 365 negative precepts and 248 positive precepts.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40439&st=&pgnum=25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a mere few pages later</a> R. Moshe quotes the Gemara in Makkos, but he leaves out the part which specifies that 365 refers to the negative precepts and 248 refers to the positive precepts. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חש בכל גופו אמר זה על דרך דאיתא במסכת מכות דרש רבי שמלאי תרי\"ג מצות\n  נאמרו לו למשה בסיני שס\"ה כמנין ימות החמה רמ\"ח כמנין אבריו של אדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is it purely coincidental that he left out the very part of the citation that he reversed earlier?</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand R. Moshe also wrote a book of the 613 mitzvos (<em>Sefer Shel Taryag Mitzvos</em>), and he does not seem to have an entirely different count (as would be necessary to reverse the numbers of positive and negative commandments).</p>\n\n<p>Is there any possible way to interpret R. Moshe's first statement without simply rejecting it as a mistake? Or are there at least any subsequent rabbinic figures that noted this glaring mistake?</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it is certainly possible that it is just a typo. However, all five editions that I checked (Cracow 1591; Frankfurt 1720; Warsaw 1876; London 1958; Jerusalem 2011) have the same error (which doesn't necessarily mean anything, as they might have just copied from each other) and none of them note this incorrect wording (including the newest edition that has extensive footnotes). Moreover, this would not help explain why the later citation of Makkos left out the part that 365 is for the negative precepts and 248 is for the positive precepts, nor would it explain the fact that the error is not noted in subsequent rabbinic literature.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A partial answer is that his quotation of the Makkot is probably exact, as Ms. Jerusalem Yad HaRav Herzog 1 has:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נאמרו לו למשה בסיני שס'ה כמנין ימות החמה רמ'ח כנגד איבריו שלאדם אמ' רב המנונא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Venice print (1520) does not have the words לאוין  or עשין either. Furthermore, R. Yeroham Fischel Perlow notes (introduction to commentary to Sefer HaMitsvot of Rassag ch. 4) that most Rishonim did not have texts identifying the negatives as 365 and the positives as 248.</p>\n\n<p>It seems unlikely that his citation just happens to match a very common version of the Talmud. Rather, it seems likely that this was his version of the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think that it is so inconceivable that the Matteh Moshe could (at least momentarily) forget which was which, especially if his edition of the Talmud didn't specify. Importantly, at least two other works makes the exact same mistake: (Hadashim Lak'toret of R. Aharon Tenenbaum) <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=32336#p=57&fitMode=fitheight&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, and K'hillat Sh'lmo of R. Sh'lomo Zalman Londan (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=21889#p=4&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). (Although these too can be dismissed as a printers errors, that doesn't seem as likely in the first case given that he didn't even mention negative commandments in that sentence which could have gotten switched.)</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that even the greatest of rabbis have misremembered things. For example, Prof. Marc Shapiro notes many examples of mistaken citations of verses by Rambam in his <em>Studies in Maimonides and His Interpreters</em> (pp. 17-47). Although with enough hand-waving it is always possible to explain away any mistake, these cases seem to indicate mistakes on his part (as Shapiro demonstrates there. See also his broader discussion there about rabbinic mistakes).</p>\n\n<p>Although we probably can't know exactly why the Matteh Moshe wrote this, and you have already noted the relevant editions of Matteh Moshe, it seems like the best we can do is note that other passages of the Talmud omit this, matching his version of the citation, that the mistake is apparently not unique to him, and that there are other cases of flawed rabbinic memory.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Different things falling through the air\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rava has a question: What is the halacha regarding something which you throw through a house, that goes in one window and out the other? Do we say that something that passes through the house's airspace is considered to have landed inside, or not?</p>\n\n<p>This question is first posed on Bava Metzia 12a. While the Gemara there attempted to settle the issue based on the Mishnah there, on 11b, ultimately it rejected that proof, as the Mishnah discusses something which is rolling, which may be different than something which is flying.</p>\n\n<p>The question later appears on 102a, where Rava seemed to pasken one way, when in fact he (as we saw above) remained doubtful about it. The Gemara answers that the case is different, as in 102a, the case was about something flying through the air <em>and landing in someone's domain</em>, while Rava asked about a case where it flew in the air and did not land in anyone's domain.</p>\n\n<p>So, in summary, Rava's question remains unresolved.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the Gemara in Zevachim (25b) records a discussion between R' Asi and R' Yochanan regarding blood from a slaughtered karban-to-be which was falling into its bucket, but the bottom of the bucket fell off before the blood landed inside: do we say that the blood is considered to have landed already or not? Ultimately, the Gemara concludes, according to any of three versions of this question, that it is considered to have landed, but obviously this is parallel to the Gemara in BM 102a, rather than Rava's question from 12a.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The problem is that there's a Mishnah in Shabbos (96a) which records a dispute between R' Akiva and the Chachamim regarding one who throws from a private domain to another private domain through a public domain: R' Akiva holds he's chayiv, while the Chachamim say he's patur. The Gemara explains (97a) that they argue when it was thrown within 10 tefachim of the ground, so R' Akiva holds he's chayiv because throwing is like it's landed, while the Chachamim hold he's patur because throwing is not like it's landed. (If it was thrown above 10 tefachim, it's in a makom petur, and so it doesn't even matter one way or the other - it will be patur anyway.) This discussion is also brought down on 4a-b.</p>\n\n<p>If this is the same as if it goes from a reshus harabim to a reshus harabim through a reshus hayachid, Rava should have resolved his question from here. Even if it's not, this should be the same as the case on BM 102a and Zevachim 25b, which resolved their questions from other sources, indicating in those Gemaras that the Gemara's conclusion follows everyone. Whichever case is more comparable, why does the Gemara not quote this Mishnah as a proof?</p>\n\n<p>So why doesn't Rava resolve his question from this Mishnah, that his two sides to his question are exactly the dispute between R' Akiva and the Chachamim?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Blessing over a wine-water mix\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone I know likes to mix (commercial) grape juice or wine with water or seltzer and drink the result. Of course, the first of those two ingredients normally requires \"<em>hagafen</em>\" and \"<em>al hagefen</em>\", while the second requires \"<em>shehakol</em>\" and \"<em>bore n'fashos</em>\". What proportions (and perhaps quantities) of each ingredient would require the recitation over the mixture of each of the aforementioned benedictions?</p>\n\n<p>For what it's worth, note that United States commercial grape juices often include uncut grape-juice concentrate in addition to the juice.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It appears that you need 1/6 (17%) of wine or grape juice to still be able to say <em>hagefen</em>. The issue is that wine nowadays is already diluted. The proper way therefore appears to be to first say the blessing <em>hagefen</em> on the undiluted grape juice or wine then drink the mix (water drunk after <em>hagefen</em> doesn't require a separate blessing).</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p>Aish <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/blessings/7-Fruit-Juice--Wine.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wine that is watered down retains the bracha</p>\n<p>When diluted, grape juice easily loses its distinctive taste.\nTherefore, when diluting grape juice with any significant amount of\nwater you can no longer say [<em>hagefen</em>].</p>\n<p>In practice, since it can be difficult to determine whether or not the\ntaste of wine or grape juice has been significantly diminished when\ndiluted, it is recommended that you say Ha'gafen on non-diluted wine\nor grape juice before drinking the diluted beverage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.practicalhalacha.com/halacha/1593-borei_pri_hagafen___mixed_drinks__wine_grape_juice\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PracticalHalacha</a> writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Say borei pri ha'gafen on drinks of wine or grape juice mixed with\nwater if at least 1/7th of the total volume is wine (or grape juice)\nbut the mixture but also still be considered to be wine or grape\njuice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not everyone agrees with the above, see e.g., <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2014/09/15/adding-water-to-grape-juice/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dinonline</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some authorities are stringent with regard to grape juice (unlike\nwine), and maintain that if grape juice is diluted with water it loses\nthe Borei Peri HaGafen blessing. Although other authorities are\nlenient concerning adding a small amount, this will only be true\ninsofar as the grape juice retains its principle taste and strength\n[...] See Shut Minchas Shlomo no. 4, who is particularly stringent\nconcerning adding water to grape juice; a similar ruling has been\ngiven by Rav Elyashiv z”l.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See more sources and details from Shulchan Aruch Harav <a href=\"http://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/wine-mixed-with-water/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.49.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">KSA 49:3</a>.</p>\n<p>Note this is only for Ashkenazim, Sefaradim <em>pasken</em> differently (I believe using 50% instead of 1/6).</p>\n\n\n",

Israel was more of a סף, a container, a\n  vessel, and a \"threshold\" to them, they were \"contained\" in Israel but\n  never really became an integral part of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, they were <em>piled up</em> inside the Bnai Yisrael and continued to regard themselves as separate in a way as well as insisting on getting all the <em>benefits</em> but not subject to any of the responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>Note that Rav Hirsch seems to say that חג האסיף would therefore come from the root אסף rather than ספף because the harvesy actually becomes <em>part of</em> Bnai Yisrael and requires תרומות ומעשרות to be taken and made <em>kadosh</em> so that the <em>tevel</em> of the initial <em>in-gathering</em> becomes permitted to the <em>Am Hashem</em>. Something that the <em>rabble</em> did not allow to happen (as shown by their actions).</p>\n\n<p>I should note that it appears that not everyone of them was like this, but that those who were caused the deaths at <em>Kivros Hata'avah</em>. Rav Hirsch goes into more details on the matter in the entire commentary of chapter 11.</p>\n\n\n",

In Yerushalmi there's a discussion at <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r2a03.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 3:2,</a> whether one should sell the property of the community to a private person.

Some pashtanim interpret this as instructing the living brother to name the son he has with his deceased brother's widow after his deceased brother (Ibn Caspi and Ralbag there, implication of Abravanel to Deut. 25 as noted by HaKtav V'HaKabbalah to 25:6, and note Ibn Ezra). This has to do with perpetuating the deceased brothers' legacy (Ralbag to 25:5-6). According to this explanation, perpetuating the name of the deceased is considered like perpetuating <em>him</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the destruction of Amalek includes destroying זכר עמלק (Deut. 25:19); meaning the memory or mention of Amalek (that the same word can be used for both is itself significant). Some interpret this as an instruction to destroy their property so that their name will no longer me mentioned in connection with their former property (Rashi there).</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Proverbs (10:7) which speaks of the name of the wicked rotting, is interpreting by the Talmud (Yoma 38b) as instructing people to <em>not</em> name people after the wicked.</p>\n\n<p>These are admittedly loose connections.</p>\n\n<p>Significantly, after this question, the first google result for related terms, is project stolpersteine, and after some searching I cannot find such a quote in the Talmud. Also notable is that such sentiments <em>are</em> found in other recent sources (listed <a href=\"http://legacymultimedia.com/2015/01/09/when-is-your-memory-truly-forgotten/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). For example, David Eagleman writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are three deaths. The first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This might not exactly answer the question, but the Talmud in Berachos 32b discusses how someone can be forsaken yet still not be forgotten. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותאמר ציון עזבני ה׳ וה׳ שכחני היינו עזובה היינו שכוחה אמר ריש לקיש\n  אמרה כנסת ישראל לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא רבונו של עולם אדם נושא אשה על אשתו\n  ראשונה זוכר מעשה הראשונה אתה עזבתני ושכחתני אמר לה הקדוש ברוך הוא בתי\n  שנים עשר מזלות בראתי ברקיע ועל כל מזל ומזל בראתי לו שלשים חיל ועל כל\n  חיל וחיל בראתי לו שלשים לגיון ועל כל לגיון ולגיון בראתי לו שלשים רהטון\n  ועל כל רהטון ורהטון בראתי לו שלשים קרטון ועל כל קרטון וקרטון בראתי לו\n  שלשים גסטרא ועל כל גסטרא וגסטרא תליתי בו שלש מאות וששים וחמשה אלפי\n  רבוא כוכבים כנגד ימות החמה וכולן לא בראתי אלא בשבילך ואת אמרת עזבתני\n  ושכחתני התשכח אשה עולה אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא כלום אשכח עולות אילים ופטרי\n  רחמים שהקרבת לפני במדבר אמרה לפניו רבונו של עולם הואיל ואין שכחה לפני\n  כסא כבודך שמא לא תשכח לי מעשה העגל אמר לה גם אלה תשכחנה אמרה לפניו\n  רבונו של עולם הואיל ויש שכחה לפני כסא כבודך שמא תשכח לי מעשה סיני אמר\n  לה ואנכי לא אשכחך והיינו דאמר רבי אלעזר אמר רב אושעיא מאי דכתיב גם אלה\n  תשכחנה זה מעשה העגל ואנכי לא אשכחך זה מעשה סיני</p>\n  \n  <p>But Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten\n  me.

Thou hast both forsaken me and\n  forgotten me! The Holy One, blessed be He, answered her: My daughter,\n  twelve constellations have I created in the firmament, and for each\n  constellation I have created thirty hosts, and for each host I have\n  created thirty legions, and for each legion I have created thirty\n  cohorts, and for each cohort I have created thirty maniples, and for\n  each maniple I have created thirty camps, and to each camp I have\n  attached three hundred and sixty-five thousands of myriads of stars,\n  corresponding to the days of the solar year, and all of them I have\n  created only for thy sake, and thou sayest, Thou hast forgotten me and\n  forsaken me! Can a woman forsake her sucking child [‘ullah]? Said the\n  Holy One, blessed be He: Can I possibly forget the burn-offerings\n  [‘olah] of rams and the firstborn of animals that thou didst offer to\n  Me in the wilderness? She thereupon said: Sovereign of the Universe,\n  since there is no forgetfulness before the Throne of Thy glory,\n  perhaps Thou wilt not forget the sin of the Calf? He replied: ‘Yea,\n  \"these \" will be forgotten’.

This is generally on the basis of the two cases appearing in the same Scriptural verse. This is perhaps best stated by Tosafos in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=31&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 31a</a> (ד\"ה ור\"י) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היקישא דהיינו שני דברים המוקשים בפסוק אחד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The exact methodology/rules for making hekeishim is not entirely crystallized, and thus we find some lengthy discussions about the viability and/or parameters of specific hekeshim. For example, the Talmud in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 5a</a> spends quite a few lines discussing a potential hekesh from the verse which mentions divorce and marriage.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומנין שאף בשטר ודין הוא ומה כסף שאין מוציא מכניס שטר שמוציא אינו דין\n  שמכניס מה לכסף שכן פודין בו הקדש ומעשר שני תאמר שטר שאין פודין בו הקדש\n  ומעשר שני דכתיב ונתן הכסף וקם לו אמר קרא ויצאה והיתה מקיש הויה ליציאה\n  מה יציאה בשטר אף הויה נמי בשטר ואקיש נמי יציאה להויה מה הויה בכסף אף\n  יציאה בכסף אמר אביי יאמרו כסף מכניס כסף מוציא סניגור יעשה קטיגור אי\n  הכי שטר נמי יאמרו שטר מוציא שטר מכניס קטיגור יעשה סניגור מילי דהאי\n  שטרא לחוד ומילי דהאי שטרא לחוד הכא נמי האי כספא לחוד והאי כספא לחוד\n  טיבעא מיהא חד הוא רבא אמר אמר קרא וכתב לה בכתיבה מתגרשת ואינה מתגרשת\n  בכסף ואימא בכתיבה מתגרשת ואינה מתקדשת בכתיבה הא כתיב ויצאה והיתה מקיש\n  וכו' ומה ראית מסתברא קאי בגירושין ממעט גירושין קאי בגירושין וממעט\n  קידושין</p>\n  \n  <p>And whence do we know that [a woman may be acquired] by deed too? But\n  may it not be inferred a minori: if money, which cannot free, effects\n  betrothal; then deed, which frees, can surely tie? — [No.] As for\n  money, that is because hekdesh and second tithe can be redeemed\n  therewith; can you say likewise of a deed, by which hekdesh and second\n  tithe cannot be redeemed, for it is written, [and if he that\n  sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,] then he shall add\n  the fifth part of the money of thy estimation, and it shall be assured\n  to him. Therefore Scripture saith, And when she is departed [out of\n  his house, she may go] and be [another man's wife]: thus ‘be — coming’\n  [betrothed] is assimilated to ‘departure’ [divorce]; just as the\n  ‘departure’ is by deed, so is ‘becoming’ too. Then let ‘departure be\n  assimilated to ‘becoming’: just as the ‘becoming’ may be by money, so\n  the ‘departure’ too may be effected by money? — Abaye replied: Then it\n  will be said: Money unites and money sunders: shall the defender\n  become the prosecutor! If so, of deed too it will be said: Deed\n  sunders and deed unites: shall the prosecutor become the defender! —\n  The contents of each deed are distinct. Then here too, [the purpose\n  of] this money is distinct and that of the other is distinct? —\n  Nevertheless, the impress [of the coin] is the same. Raba said:\n  Scripture saith, then he shall write her [a writ of divorcement]:\n  [hence], she can be divorced by writing, not by money. Say rather, she\n  can be divorced by ‘writing’, but not betrothed by writing? — But it\n  is written, and when she is departed, she may go and be, etc.,\n  assimilating etc. And why do you choose thus? — It is logical: when\n  treating of divorce, one excludes [a particular method of] divorce;\n  but when dealing with divorce, shall one exclude [a form of] marriage?\n  [Surely not!] (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An example of a hekesh that compares two cases that are in separate verses, is the hekesh mentioned in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=20b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 20b</a> from which we derive that women are obligated in the positive aspects of Shabbos.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב אדא בר אהבה נשים חייבות בקדוש היום דבר תורה אמאי מצות עשה שהזמן\n  גרמא הוא וכל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמא נשים פטורות אמר אביי מדרבנן א\"ל רבא\n  והא דבר תורה קאמר ועוד כל מצות עשה נחייבינהו מדרבנן אלא אמר רבא אמר\n  קרא זכור ושמור כל שישנו בשמירה ישנו בזכירה והני נשי הואיל ואיתנהו\n  בשמירה איתנהו בזכירה</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Adda b. Ahabah said: Women are under obligation to sanctify the\n  [Sabbath] day by ordinance of the Torah. But why should this be? It\n  is a positive precept for which there is a definite time, and women\n  are exempt from all positive precepts for which there is a definite\n  time? — Abaye said: The obligation is only Rabbinical. Said Raba to\n  him: But it says, ‘By an ordinance of the Torah’? And further, on this\n  ground we could subject them to all positive precepts by Rabbinical\n  authority? Rather, said Raba. The text says Remember and Observe.\n  Whoever has to ‘observe’ has to ‘remember’; and since these women have\n  to ‘observe’, they also have to ‘remember’.

Most often it's translated as 'thou shalt command' as in the OJPS, but the NJPS translates it as 'You shall further instruct' which comes closer to it's true meaning. In this case the word seems to mean that Moshe will command the people of Israel, somewhere in the future, about the preparation of the oil.

Perhaps, if there is a <em>mohel</em> among our readers, can he confirm or dispute this? If this is true, why does it take 3 days?

For example, after you say the motzi, how much time do you have before you must eat a piece of bread?  I am interested in a broad answer.  In this week's portion, Bo, we are told \"And you shall watch over the matzot\n﻿  וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם אֶת-הַמַּצּוֹת [Ex. 12:17]\"\nThe Mechilta d'Rabbi Yishmael says: Rabbi Yoshiah says: Do not read:, אֶת-הַמַצּוֹת, the matzot, but אֶת-הַמִצְוֹת, the commandments. Just as we may not permit the matzot to become leavened, so may we not permit the commandments to become leavened [by waiting too long before performing them].  If [a commandment] comes your way, perform it immediately.<br>\nIs any further guidance available, beyond \"as soon as possible\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The lesson quoted in the question, \"If [a commandment] comes your way, perform it immediately\" (in the Hebrew \"מצוה הבאה לידך אל תחמיצנה\") isn't implying a time restraint but rather an overall idea that the execution of a given commandment should not be delayed or put on the back burner.</p>\n\n<p>This concept is echoed in another lesson by the rabbis (BT <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.4a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesahim 4a</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זריזים מקדימים למצוות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translated as (Sefaria):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the vigilant are early in the performance of mitzvot</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, questions of time limits such as eating bread after pronouncing the appropriate blessing, is a matter of <em>hefsek</em> (interruption). This specific issue is of concern that unnecessary interruption between a blessing and execution [of the related commandment] alienates intention of the doer from his/her action. </p>\n\n<p>A somewhat related matter is commandments that are subject to and contingent on a specific time/date, e.g. circumcision on the eighth day or searching/ridding of <em>chametz</em> (unleavened bread) on the eve of the fourteenth of Nissan. In this category each commandment (biblical or rabbinic) has different guidelines and a full scope of the minutiae is beyond this answer. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I think you ask two different questions here.</p>\n\n<p>The first part of your question deals with <strong>Shiurin for Mitzvot - Time allotment</strong> for performing a Mitzva. That can include, for example, time for Chanuka candles being lit, time to consume a measure of Matzah at the Seder, time allotted for saying Birkas Hamozoyn after a meal, time allotted for a loan to pay back, times allotted for prayers, etc.</p>\n\n<p>You second part, the Mechiltah you brought is talking about something different - להחמיץ in Hebrew simply means to miss something, like missing a train. So <strong>you can miss a Mitzva, the way you miss a train</strong>. E.g. Mishna in Avos 2,4 - \"Don't say I will study when I'll have some free tome, for you might not have a chance (so start now)\". Or if you see a poor don't say I will help him tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the proper definition of a \"Poretz Gader\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are a few places in halacha where it states that someone who violates a rule is called <em>Poretz Gader</em>. An example is someone who doesn't stand while saying <em>Vehu Rachum</em> (or according to Mishna Berurah, it applies to someone who doesn't say it at all. See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 134:1</a> and Mishnah Berurah #3, there.)</p>\n\n<p>What is an accurate definition of this term? I know that a literal translation is \"breaching a fence\". I'm seeking a more accurate definition that explains more how \"severe\" this designation is, if there are any punishments or consequences for someone who is called this, and if there are specific criteria or parameters to assigning this designation. It seems to apply to someone who breaks a certain <em>minhag</em>. But, it's not assigned to every minhag, obviously. So, what criteria are there as to when they use this term?   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The phrase <em>Poretz Geder</em> in the context of being one who violates rules, like in your question, can be understood by looking at the two words which make up the phrase as found in Sefer HaAruch from Rabbi Natan of Rome.</p>\n\n<p>He clarifies the meaning <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11828&st=&pgnum=301\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">of <em><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42538&st=&pgnum=252\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">peretz</a></em> (פֶּרֶץ)</a> from Brachot 17b which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“There is no breach”; that our faction of Sages should not be like the faction of David, from which Ahitophel emerged, who caused a breach in the kingdom of David. \n  “And no going forth”; that our faction should not be like the faction of Saul, from which Doeg the Edomite emerged, who set forth on an evil path. \n  “And no outcry”; that our faction should not be like the faction of Elisha, from which Geihazi emerged. \n  “In our open places”; that we should not have a child or student who overcooks his food in public, i.e., who sins in public and causes others to sin, as in the well-known case of Jesus the Nazarene.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And also from Sukkah 26a which discusses the idea that a <em>breach</em> (פִּרְצָה) summons the thief. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rava said: A breach summons the thief. If the guardian builds a sukka, thieves will know where the guardian is located in the field and they will enter the field elsewhere. The exemption of the watchman from the mitzva of sukka prevents that situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This implies that the poretz not only personally behaves in a deviant fashion in public, but that they also have influence on others to cause them to take bad actions. They <em>summon the thief</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch defines <em><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42538&st=&pgnum=62\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">geder</a></em> as it is explained from Brachot 17a which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מרגלא בפומייהו דרבנן דיבנה אני בריה וחברי בריה אני מלאכתי בעיר והוא מלאכתו בשדה אני משכים למלאכתי והוא משכים למלאכתו <strong>כשם שהוא אינו <em>מתגדר</em> במלאכתי כך אני איני <em>מתגדר</em> במלאכתו</strong> ושמא תאמר אני מרבה והוא ממעיט שנינו אחד המרבה ואחד הממעיט ובלבד שיכוין לבו לשמים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He says that <em>geder</em> there has a connotation of <em>authority</em>. The Aruch also says that there are those who say in that context that <em>geder</em> has the connotation of Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>So using these two components, the phrase <em>Poretz Geder</em> means  someone who doesn't learn Torah and doesn't acknowledge the authority of the Torah, who violates it publicly and leads others on that path, which is a definition with a negative connotation.</p>\n\n<p>This is in keeping with your specific example from Mishnah Berurah 134:2 which attributes the requirement of saying V'Hu Rachum to a Takanah of the Soferim as found in Kol Bo. This person, who refuses to say it in minyan, meaning in public, which has influence on others, is called a <em>Poretz Geder</em>. In your specific example, it would be alluding to someone who denies the authority of the Oral Torah like is explained in the name of Rava in Eruvin 21b.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל <strong>וכי תורה פעמים פעמים ניתנה</strong> אלא הללו מדברי תורה והללו <strong>מדברי סופרים</strong> דרש רבא מאי דכתיב (קהלת יב, יב) ויותר מהמה בני הזהר עשות ספרים הרבה וגו' <strong>בני הזהר <em>בדברי סופרים</em> יותר מדברי תורה</strong> שדברי תורה יש בהן עשה ולא תעשה ודברי סופרים כל העובר על דברי סופרים חייב מיתה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This also seems to be the understanding and contrast of these words as found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.63a.23?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 63a-b</a> and the discussion of Rabbi Chanina, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua when he left Israel to teach Torah in Bavel.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>התחיל הוא מטמא והם מטהרים הוא אוסר והם מתירים הכריז עליהם אנשים הללו של שוא הם של תהו הם אמרו לו כבר בנית ואי אתה יכול לסתור כבר <strong>גדרת</strong> ואי אתה יכול <strong>לפרוץ</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The general discussion on this page is talking about when an individual should work to build Torah learning and mitzvah performance doing outreach in their particular community and when they shouldn't. One of the examples brought to illustrate this is from Rabbi Chanina. The complete story in translation is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Safra said: Rabbi Abbahu would relate: When Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, went to the Diaspora, Babylonia, he would intercalate years and establish months outside of Eretz Yisrael. Because Judaism in Eretz Yisrael had declined in the wake of the bar Kokheva rebellion, he considered it necessary to cultivate the Jewish community in Babylonia as the center of the Jewish people. Among other things, he intercalated the years and established the months even though the halakha restricts those activities to Eretz Yisrael. Eventually, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael sent two Torah scholars after him, Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar and the grandson of Zekharya ben Kevutal. When Ḥanina saw them, he asked them: Why did you come? They responded: We came to study Torah. Since he saw his standing enhanced by the Sages of Eretz Yisrael coming to study Torah from him, he proclaimed about them: These people are eminent scholars of our generation, and their fathers served in the Temple. As we learned in tractate Yoma: Zekharya ben Kevutal says: Many times I read before the High Priest from the book of Daniel on the eve of Yom Kippur. These two scholars, however, began to dispute every decision Ḥanina rendered in response to questions raised in the study hall. He ruled it impure and they ruled it pure; he prohibited it and they permitted it. Eventually, he proclaimed about them: These people are worthless. They are good for nothing and they know nothing. They said to him: You have already built up our names and glorified us; you cannot now demolish. You have already <strong>built a fence</strong> and you cannot <strong>break through it</strong>. He said to them: Why is it that when I rule something impure, you rule it pure; when I prohibit it, you permit it? They said to him: We do this because you intercalate the years and establish the months outside of Eretz Yisrael. He said to them: Didn’t Rabbi Akiva ben Yosef also intercalate years and establish months outside of Eretz Yisrael? They replied to him: Leave the case of Rabbi Akiva, as, when he left, he did not leave behind anyone as great in Torah as he in Eretz Yisrael. Rabbi Ḥanina said to them: I also did not leave behind anyone as great as me in Eretz Yisrael. They said to him: The kids who you left behind have grown into goats with horns; they are greater than you are. And they sent us to you, and this is what they said to us: Go and tell him in our name: If he obeys, fine; and if he does not obey, he will be ostracized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea of <em>building a fence</em> is when Rabbi Chanina lauded the two visitors from Israel as eminent scholars and the idea of <em>breaking that boundary</em> was when he said they were worthless, good for nothing and knew nothing.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to point out that in Torah, there is another usage of this expression which is not negative. It is like is found in Sefer Kehillat Yaacov by Rabbi Yaacov Tzvi Yolles who also links the phrase with the manifestation of G-d's Kingship.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Font size variation within siddurim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>People might write this off as a matter of typeface and nothing more, but why do so many siddurim vary the font size within the tefillos? I used to think that they made the more important tefillos larger and the less important tefillos* smaller but in many siddurim there seems to be no order at all, they just <strong>change the font size randomly</strong> whenever they want. Is there a reason for the varying font size? Perhaps the publisher is trying to convey that certain portions of davening are more important than others? </p>\n\n<p><sup>*What even is a more important/less important tefillah? They're all important. I guess what I mean is that they make Baruch She'amar, Yishtabach, Shema, etc. large and things like various perakim from Tehillim small.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This answer is informed by my research and work in typography.</p>\n\n<p>There is significance, but it's not specifically based on the importance of the passages. If you look in some older siddurim, such as <em>Siddur Tefilat kol Peh</em> (Ashkenaz, someone will have to verify for Sfard) Pss. 146 (הללי נפשי את ה׳) and 148 (הללו את ה׳ מן השמים) are set in relatively large type, compared with Ps. 147 (כי טוב זמרו ﭏהינו). The latter mizmor is significantly longer than the former ones. Similarly, Ps. 100 (מזמור לתודה) is often set in larger type than הודו and יהי כבוד.</p>\n\n<p>In my own work, I have tried not to change type size based on verbosity, as it seems rather distracting for the reason mentioned in the OP.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I believe a Siddur is a very different kind of book than any other. This gives editors of siddurim a very unique challenge; to make the prayer experience as intuitive and interactive as possible. I find that these changes are most prevalent in pesukei dezimra and shemone esrei. </p>\n\n<p>To meet this challenge, the siddur must be usable at a glance, without the reader having to pay too much attention to instructions, and allow focus on the prayers themselves. I can see two functions for font changes, both of which may be real reasons.</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Make each page recognizable.</strong> This gives the prayers a familiar feel, so after someone becomes accustomed to one siddur, they can go almost on autopilot (for the good or the bad).</p>\n\n<p>2)  <strong>Make rarely read passages obscure.</strong> This allows the prayers on a regular day to flow without having to find the end of the excerpts.</p>\n\n<p>There may be other needs in a siddur that font size can be helpful with, but the notion that it is to indicate importance is surely faulty. I looked around in various siddurim, and found that there is no correlation in that regard.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>At times it is true that they will make one tefilla in a larger font if they feel it is important. Many times though, it is just a typesetting thing. The artscroll siddur actually seems to have a more or less equal font size, only making a larger font for the special teffilos. I don't think ther eis much more to this.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The comparison of the altar with the heart\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read this on the Chabad website</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/41988/jewish/The-Continual-Fire.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In</a> his Likkutei Torah (Devarim 78d) Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi\n  explains that the altars form the whole heart of the Jew. And corresponding to\n  the two altars of the Sanctuary, the outer and the inner, are the\n  outer and inner levels of the heart, its surface personality and its\n  essential core.</p>\n  \n  <p>The altar on which the continual fire was to be set was the outer one.\n  And for the Jew this means that the fire of his love for G‑d must be\n  outward, open and revealed. It is not a private possession, to be\n  cherished subconsciously. It must show in the face he sets towards the\n  world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What I would like to know is from where the Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi got his idea from to compare the altars with the heart. Are there any verses in the Scripture which take this symbolism, or make a alogy or metaphor in similar fashion? </p></li>\n<li><p>And Secondly, if the continual fire was to be set on the outer one, in order to represent that the fire of his love of G-d must be outward, open and revealed in the surface of one's personality.. then what about the inner altar in which way does it represents the inner essence? Or what about the other continual fire (i.e. light), that of the Ner Tamid that was placed in the inner core? </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is drawn from two sources in the Zohar. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14246&st=&pgnum=571\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshat Balak 196b, chapter 220</a> and in the second introduction to <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53706&st=&pgnum=77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tikkunei Zohar 17a quoting Eliyahu HaNavi</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This also follows the way it is explained in Sefer Kehillat Yaacov beginning with the words, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=165\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מזבח תרין מדבחן אנון כו׳</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44143&st=&pgnum=166\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מזבח הזהב</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By way of illustration, when looking at the overhead floor plan of the Temple, it is compared to the silhouette of either a person laying prostrate, arms outstretched before G-d or a Kohen raising their hands to bless. The placement of the outer alter is in the general position where the heart would be. The Holy and Holy of Holies are in the position of the head. The inner alter, the gold, incense alter is in the place where the brains would be.</p>\n\n<p>In context, the Mochin (Brains) are what give rise to the Middot (Emotional Attributes) in proper service to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>This same structure follows the placement of the Tefillin <em>shel Rosh</em> and Tefillin <em>shel Yad</em>. The 4 Batim of the <em>shel Rosh</em> correspond with the brains. The straps of the <em>shel Rosh</em> meet at the heart which is the place where the Avnet (Gartel) is tied. And the Bayit of the <em>shel Yad</em>, which is turned toward the heart to receive it's influence, concludes with the strap which ends at the hand. This means performance of the commandments, external action, is the main thing.</p>\n\n<p>See here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/umGds.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/umGds.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Overwhelming individualism in Jewish Halachah",
    "content": "# Overwhelming individualism in Jewish Halachah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><sub>(Please follow the idea before finding counterarguments).</sub></p>\n\n<p><strong>The dawn of Judaism</strong> - Abraham, Itzhok, Yaakov, the Tribes - most fateful decisions were made almost exclusively on personal basis, without consulting other living authorities. Abraham and Itzhok did not consult Shem and Ever (and Noah), even though they lived in the same time in Eretz Isroel. The Brothers did not consult neither the family (father and grandfather) nor the Shem's Beis Din.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tanakh:</strong> Moses, Joshuah, Judges, Kings - all issued their rulings without, seemingly, consulting the Zkeynim (or any Beis Din). Phrases like \"Let me ask the Beis Din!\" or \"Let the Sanhedrin decide!\" are very rare in the Tanakh. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Talmudic times</strong>: from Hillel and Shammay and to Amorayim - the great Sanhedrin was fully functioning through the whole epoch, but nevertheless  every Rabbi  kept his own Braysos and ruled for himself. The situation was so severe, that the next generation Tanoyim or Amoroyim had no idea what the previous generation had in mind. 90% of uncertainties in the Talmud could be avoided if the discussions were brought to the Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ever since:</strong> Geoynim, Rishoynim, Akhroynim and to the present days Gdoylim , <strong>all Halokhos were ruled individually by single persons</strong> <em>(with a few exceptions</em>), with no attempts to gather the leading Rabbis of every era and rule Halochos together either to resemble the Torah's idea of the \"70 Elders\" or simply to seek agreement and acceptance. </p>\n\n<p>As such, they all suffer from extreme lack of systematization, lack of accepted terminology, personal cultural biases, duplicates (hence waste of time), mutual disregard and accusations and more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How come the original Torah idea of bringing every Makhloykes to a Beis Din was kept overridden in all times? Is this how Judaism is planned to work?</strong>  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The preferred method for how <em>halachic</em> rulings are decided is established in the Torah, Devarim 17:8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי יפלא ממך דבר למשפט בין דם לדם בין דין לדין ובין נגע לנגע דברי ריבת בשעריך וקמת ועלית אל המקום אשר יבחר יהוה אלהיך בו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When a question arises, the ideal situation was to go to \"the place that Hashem chose\" to have it answered. The Talmud (Sanhedrin 86b) understands this to be a reference to the highest court which sat in the Lishkas HaGazis of the Beis HaMikdash, from which Torah comes out to the Jewish people:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ב\"ד הגדול שבלשכת הגזית שממנו יוצא תורה לכל ישראל שנאמר (דברים יז, י) מן המקום ההוא אשר יבחר ה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The structure of the Sanhedrin involved taking into account the opinion of all members of the body. The entire Sanhedrin would sit together in a semi-circle (Sanhedrin 36b):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סנהדרין היתה כחצי גורן עגולה כדי שיהו רואין זה את זה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sanhedrin was meant to engage in discussion, and in fact it was prohibited to appoint a king to the Sanhedrin since others would not be allowed to argue with him (Rambam Hil. Sanhedrin 2:4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין מושיבין מלך ישראל בסנהדרין, שאסור לחלוק עליו ולמרות דבריו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam, in his introduction to his Mishnah Torah, commonly refers to each Sage as \"Rabbi Ploni <em>and his beis din</em>, as the Sages were not making decisions in a vacuum, but rather working with their respective courts. Indeed, the Rambam implies later in the introduction that the Sanhedrins were active until not too long before the compilation of the Talmud - when discussing the post-Talmudic authorities, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובית דין הגדול של שבעים בטל מכמה שנים קודם חיבור התלמוד</p>\n<p>The Great Sanhedrin of 70 was nullified some years before the compilation of the Talmud</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not only that, but the Rambam describes that the rulings of the Talmud are binding because they were achieved through consensus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל כל הדברים שבתלמוד הבבלי, חייבין כל בית ישראל ללכת בהם; וכופין כל עיר ועיר וכל מדינה ומדינה לנהוג בכל המנהגות שנהגו חכמים שבתלמוד, ולגזור גזירותם וללכת בתקנותם.\nלה  הואיל וכל אותן הדברים שבתלמוד הסכימו עליהם כל ישראל, ואותן החכמים שהתקינו או שגזרו או שהנהיגו או שדנו דין ולמדו שהמשפט כך הוא הם כל חכמי ישראל או רובן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was the ideal system. However, with the breakdown of centralized Jewish settlement and autonomy, and the difficulty of convening, this system broke down, as the Rambam writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מפני רוחק מושבותיהם, ושיבוש הדרכים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam discusses a possibility of how this system could be reinstituted in Hil. Sanhedrin ch. 4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראין לי הדברים, שאם הסכימו כל החכמים שבארץ ישראל למנות דיינין ולסמוך אותן--הרי אלו סמוכין, ויש להן לדון דיני קנסות, ויש להן לסמוך לאחרים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If all of the Sages of the Land of Israel would unanimously agree to appoint judges, they would reinstitute the chain of <em>semicha</em> necessary to convene a Sanhedrin. However, as the Rambam there continues, this is not a likely situation to occur - as they say, 2 Jews, 3 opinions. (It should be noted that many authorities disagreed with the Rambam's suggestion of how <em>semicha</em> could be revived.)</p>\n<p>In conclusion, discussion and consensus is the ideal, but the system became untenable and is not in operation right now.</p>\n\n\n",

So it would appear as well from a responsum of one of our great authorities, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Asher b.

In the old rabbinic literature we find converts bearing names such as Onkelos (BT Meg. 3a), Judah (Mishnah Yadaim 4:4 and BT MK 9a) Samuel (BT Yeb. 101b) Yochanan (Midrash PR 14) among other, both Hebrew and Greek names. Examples post Talmud are found as well; one notable one was a contemporary of Maimonides, Ovadiah. </p>\n\n<p>However, there is a in old custom that a convert assumes the name Abraham (and more precisely 'son of Abraham' - but this is beyond the question, cf. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49231&st=&pgnum=153\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kelalei Ha'milah p. 136</a> by <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6621-gershon-b-jacob-ha-gozer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

Only Kiddushin does. But Kiddushin started only after Matan Torah (see Rambam Ishus 1). </p>\n\n<p><strong>So were the Affinity Arayos forbidden prior to Matan Torah?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ramban (to Yevamos 98a) holds that Noahides have no prohibition of relationships with relatives who are not blood relatives. He brings a proof to this from the fact that Yehuda absolved Tamar upon discovering her identity, and she was not put to death for violating the prohibition of Father-in-Law/daughter-in-law. Yibbum, he writes, was a minhag, and therefore Yehuda did not remain with Tamar, but there was no mitzvah which could have overridden the prohibition if it would have existed. (The Ramban to Bereishis 38:2 explains that there is some mystical benefit that is inherent in Yibbum, and therefore the wise men of the ages practiced Yibbum even though there was no formalized Mitzvah.)</p>\n\n<p>The Rashba (same place) on the other hand, holds that this is not a proof, and writes that even if Noahides had a prohibition to relatives through marriage, the mitzvah of Yibbum would have overridden it. The Rashba explains that before Matan Torah, Yibbum extended to all relatives, and that Mitzvah overrode the any prohibition which existed for them. However, they only had the prohibition to blood relatives, and not to relatives through marriage.</p>\n\n<p>I can't find the text of the Ramban online, but here is the pertinent section of Rashba:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותדע לך שהרי יהודה אמר על כלתו צדקה ממני, ואלו היתה אסורה לו משום כלה, אכתי חייבת מיתה היא משום ערוה לכולי עלמא, דהא בית דין של ישראל ממיתין עליה, אלא ודאי עריות דאישות דקרובים לית להו. ומיהו אין תמר ראיה דמותרת היתה לו ליהודה דבר תורה משום יבמה, דקודם התורה היה יבום מותר בקרובין, אלא שרצה יהודה לנהוג בה כדרך שצותה התורה באחים, לא באב שהאח עיקר, ובקי היה בענינו. ויורה על זה בועז כנ\"ל. והא דתניא כל ערוה שבית דין של ישראל ממיתין עליה בן נח מוזהר עליה לאו בעריות דאישות קא מיירי אלא בעריות דשאר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to both Ramban and Rashba, bnei noach do not have arayos caused through marriage, and this began only with Matan Torah.</p>\n\n<p>(Mostly copied from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/50566/4794\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Timing for hamotzi\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After you say hamotzi, how much time do you have before you must eat some bread? I note that <em>quantities</em> of food are frequently specified (e.g., at least a kazayit-- an olive's worth, etc.). Are times also specified? My research produced no answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There  are three different issues here.</p>\n\n<p>1) Time difference between saying a blessing over food (not just hamotzi) and eating that food.</p>\n\n<p>2) Quantity of food and time in which it is consumed to need a blessing afterwards (not just bread)</p>\n\n<p>3) Amount of bread over which it is necessary to say the blessing on the ritual washing of hands. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>1) The <a href=\"http://yonanewman.org/kizzur/kizzur50.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Oruch 50 (5)</a> says in this extract:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One shouldn't hesitate more than momentarily (note i) between\n  (making) the blessing and eating (the food). Even while chewing,  it\n  is forbidden to make any interruptions until one swallows. An\n  interruption by speaking, between the blessing and eating,  about\n  matters not related to the food, requires repeating the blessing. \n  However, if he waited in silence,  he does not need to go back and\n  (again) bless.  Waiting that's required for the eating isn't\n  considered an interruption at all.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note i) The time it takes to say the words ''Shalom Alecha Rebbi''\n  (Mishna Berurah 487:4), or according to the Pri Megadim ''Shalom\n  Alecha Rebbi U'Moree.''</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>2) See the <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/4105/kzayis-a-guide-to-halachic-food-measurements/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Star K article</a> where it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>K’zayis Measurement – 1.27 fl. oz. (38 ml) – If one eats a k’zayis of\n  bread, he must recite birchas hamazon. Similarly, if one eats a\n  k’zayis of any other food a brocha acharona must be recited.</p>\n  \n  <p>An after-brocha is only recited if one eats a k’zayis in the amount of\n  time known as k’dei achilas pras. This means, to recite Birchas\n  hamazon or a bracha acharona  one has to have eaten a k’zayis ideally\n  within a two minute span (b’dieved within a four minute span). The\n  same applies to fulfilling various mitzvos (e.g., achilas matzah).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3) From the same Star K article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When washing before eating bread, one recites the brocha of Al\n  Nitilas Yadayim only if one intends to eat a k’beitzah of bread (= Two\n  k’zayisim, 2.53 fl. oz. (75 ml) ).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This answer only starts the subject. Study more and CYLOR. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes there are times involved as well. For example, <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/halacha-lmaaseh/hamotzi/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaMotzi Richard B. Aiken</a> specifies.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wash the One-Time Method and say ha’motzi on bread made of the Five\n  Grains (wheat, rye, oats, barley, or spelt), even if you will not eat\n  at least 1.3 fl. oz. (39 ml, or 1/6 cup) within four minutes.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note: Say the blessing al netilat yadayim on washing hands ONLY if you\n  will eat at least 1.9. fl. oz. (56 ml) of bread within four minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The bracha rishona applies even for a <em>mashehu</em> (any amount). The specification of a particular amount (kazayis) applies only for how much is required in order that one is to say the <em>birkas hamazon</em>. The <em>bracha rishona</em> statement applies to any food item as explained by <a href=\"http://www.ravaviner.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Shlomo Aviner</a>. As an example</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Q: Does one recite a blessing on chewing gum?</p>\n  \n  <p>A: Yes, since a blessing before eating does not require a minimal\n  amount (Mishnah Berurah 210:1), one benefits from the sweetness, and\n  it reaches one's stomach (Shut Yabia Omer 7:33 #2.  Although the book\n  Bikdushato Shel Aharon [Volume 1 p. 162, 186] relates that when the\n  Chafetz Chaim and the Belzer Rebbe - Ha-Rav Aharon Rokeach - met in a\n  Rabbinical conference in Warsaw, the Belzer Rebbe poured the Chafetz\n  Chaim a glass of wine and said: Here, we arrived at the minimal\n  amount.  The Chafetz Chaim immediately understood that the Rebbe meant\n  for the blessing preceding the drinking, and was surprised!  The\n  Chafetz Chaim said that this is the position of the Kol Bo [brought in\n  the Beit Yosef, Orach Chaim #210], and apologized, saying that if he\n  had known that there are those who follow it, he would have included\n  it in the Mishnah Berurah!  Only those who are the most particular,\n  however, follow this ruling).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since it applies to the smallest amount of food, there is no time requirement in which the eating must take place. A time requirement only exists if there is a minimum amount of food mentioned (as with <em>birkat hamazon</em> or other <em>bracha acharona</em>.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "\"A moon like this you should sanctify\"?",
    "content": "# \"A moon like this you should sanctify\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshas Bo G-d says to Moses to sanctify a new Moon, but Moses \"had trouble understanding\" and G-d showed him exactly the picture of a new Moon, saying <strong>\"כזה ראה וקדש\"</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, Moses knew the idea and the calculation of new moon either by the tradition his tribe kept, or simply by being educated in Egypt, he probably knew astronomy very well. </p>\n\n<p>The Mishna (Bavli R\"H 23b) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"How do they examine the witnesses who come to testify about the new moon? ... Say how you saw the moon: Was it in front of the sun or behind the sun? To its north or to its south? How high was the moon over the horizon, and in which direction did it tilt? <strong>And how wide was it</strong>?*\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi explains it is about its \"measure\" to be suitable for Kidush, but I don't recall a discussion about Moon's width, except for Yerushalmi (12) says it should be a barley wide (Bavli omits it) with no discussion in place. We also hold that the minimum time the Moon can be seen from the time of Molad is 6 hours but not its width.</p>\n\n<p>So what exactly was G-d's Chidush to Moses about New Moon?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Netziv in his pirush on the Mechilta addresses what was difficult. </p>\n\n<p>He quotes Tosafos in Pesachim 6b that this event happened on Rosh Chodesh and the difficulty was simply seeing the sliver of the moon as per Rosh Hashana 24a.</p>\n\n<p>He also quoted the words of the Rambam in the beginning of Hilchos Kidush Hachodesh who wrote in the name of the Rabbis that Hashem showed Moshe a vision of the moon in a prophetic vision. According to this the Netziv suggests, the vision did not happen on Rosh Chodesh which is why it required a special vision.</p>\n\n<p>(In fact, Rabbi Yaakov Kaminetsky quoted this Rambam and since he was assuming based on the gemara in Pesachim that the vision was on Rosh Chodesh, he questioned what forced Rambam to say Hashem showed Moshe the moon in a prophetic vision. He left it unresolved.)</p>\n\n<p>So the difficulty was either seeing a tiny unnoticeable sliver of a moon, or seeing something which would be physically impossible at that point in time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9873#v=2&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bo 12:2</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַחֹ֧דֶשׁ הַזֶּ֛ה לָכֶ֖ם רֹ֣אשׁ חֳדָשִׁ֑ים רִאשׁ֥וֹן הוּא֙ לָכֶ֔ם\n  לְחָדְשֵׁ֖י הַשָּׁנָֽה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That this was a method of giving the command, not that Moshe Rabbeinu did not understand the cycle of the moon.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Just as Hashem told Noah to turn his looks away from the earth which\n  had just been regiven to Man, and direct them to the heavens, and,\n  showing him the rainbow, said זאת אות הברית, this is tobe the sign,\n  the guarantee, of My covenant with the new future which I promise to\n  humanity, in the same way, in Egypt, at the threshold of the new\n  Jewish future, He called Moses and Aaron into the open, showed them\n  the silver crescent of the new moon, and said: \"This renewal is to be\n  to you a beginning of New-moons\" (literally a beginning of renewals,\n  of revivals), \"and it, the month that is beginning with it, is to be\n  for you the first of the months of the year!\". There are two מצות\n  contained in this verse, (a) קידוש החודש על פי ראית הלבנה בחידושה,\n  fixing the beginning of the month with the new moon becoming visible,\n  and (b) to make the order of the monts of the year start with Nissan,\n  the month of the redmption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, the knowledge of the full cycle was already known and the calculation was used as the basis of determining when the witnesses were to be expected (as explained in Rosh Hashana, 23, 24, 25). That is why (for example) we see in the haftarah that we read for מחר חודש that Dovid and Yonasan knew that it was going to be Rosh Chodesh and that two days of Rosh Chodesh were kept at that time.</p>\n\n<p>Thus we see that Hashem shows Moshe the first crescent of the new moon and tells him that this well known astronomical event is to be declared by witnesses and consecrated by the <em>bais din</em>. Otherwise, Hashem could have instructed Moshe to start from the actual conjuction of Nisan and alternate 29 and 30 day months or to use the calculated <em>molad</em> (as we do now) rather than waiting until witnesses can see the moon. . As Rav Hirsch says.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is striking evidence that it is <em>not</em> the actual condition up\n  above, but the consecrating declaration of the representatives of\n  Israel that is the decisive factor on which the beginning of the month\n  depends.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think the OP is asking about where the <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=12&mefaresh=mehilta\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mekhilta says (on 12:2)</a> \"החדש\n  הזה לכם וגו'... זה אחד מג' דברים שנתקשה משה והראהו המקום את כלן\n  באצבע\", and the OP understands it to mean that Moshe didn't know till\n  then what a 'new moon' was. – @TamirEvan</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this is the case then I would read it as meaning that Moshe Rabbeinu knew exactly what a new moon was (the actual conjunction - when no moon is visible at all). Hashem was taking the opportunity to show him that the month would be determined by Bais Din on the basis of witnesses. I would also read it more like Rav Hirsch that Hashem was showing the deeper meaning of the <em>new moon</em> to Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n\n",

According to this approach one can even\n  say that the said laws in impurity are intended only to reveal the\n  reality that already exists in the spiritual nature of the world.\n  According to this view, the spirit of impurity may cause damage to the\n  soul of those who come into contact with it, and the preservation of\n  the purification saves the person from this damage. Expressions of\n  this perception can be found in the writings of several of the\n  Rishonim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that even though the impurity is a reality it is only a spiritual entity – not given to detection by the human senses. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2 הטומאה כרעיון סמלי</p>\n  \n  <p>גישה שנייה סוברת, שאין צורך להניח את דבר קיומה הממשי של רוח טומאה,\n  ועניין הטומאה הוא ריחוק, לרוב כביטוי סמלי של רעיון כלשהו. כך סבר\n  הרמב\"ם, שהטומאה איננה ישות רוחנית מציאותית, אלא הגדרה הלכתית גרידא,\n  וכפי שכתב בסיום \"ספר טהרה\" בחיבורו הגדול משנה תורה: \"דבר ברור וגלוי\n  שהטומאות והטהרות גזירות הכתוב הן, ואינן מדברים שדעתו של אדם מכרעת\n  אותן, והרי הן מכלל החוקים. וכן הטבילה מן הטומאות - מכלל החוקים היא,\n  שאין הטומאה טיט או צואה שתעבור במים, אלא גזירת הכתוב היא... כיוון שטבל\n  - טהור, ואף על פי שלא נתחדש בגופו דבר.\" (משנה תורה לרמב\"ם, ספר טהרה, הלכות מקואות, פרק י\"א, הלכה י\"ב) </p>\n  \n  <p>2] Impurity as a symbolic idea</p>\n  \n  <p>A second approach holds that there is no need to assume the actual\n  existence of a spirit of impurity. The essence of impurity is a\n  symbolic expression of the idea of distancing. Thus Maimonides\n  believed that impurity is not a real spiritual entity, but rather a\n  purely halakhic definition, and as he wrote at the end of Sefer Tahara\n  in his great book Mishneh Torah: \"It is abundantly clear that the\n  impurities and the purity are the decrees of Scripture. And they are\n  beyond human understanding -  they are part of the decrees (of the\n  Almighty). And the immersion (in a mikvah) for the impurity – is also\n  one of the decrees. Impurity is not mud or feces that will be removed\n  by the water, but it is the decree of Scripture is ... that after he\n  has immersed he becomes pure and even though nothing has changed in\n  his body. \"(Mishneh Torah of Maimonides, , Chapter 11, Halacha 12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, impurity is not even a spiritual reality. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the transfer of tumah is the transfer of either a spiritual reality or the transfer of the decrees of the Almighty. </p>\n\n<p>Tumah finds its expression in our days through the laws of Family Purity and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niddah#Ritual_purity_aspect\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah</a> and through the [Prohibition of Kohen defilement by the dead] (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_Kohen_defilement_by_the_dead#Modern_applications\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_Kohen_defilement_by_the_dead#Modern_applications</a>) .   </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rambam explains the reason for the laws of ritual impurity in Guide for the Perplexed 3:47.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>THE precepts of the twelfth class are those which we have enumerated\n  in the section on \"Purity\" (Sefer tohorah). Although we have mentioned\n  their use in general, we will here offer an additional explanation,\n  and [first] fully discuss the object of the whole class, and then show\n  the reason of each single commandment, as far as we have been able to\n  discover it. I maintain that the Law which was revealed to Moses, our\n  Teacher, and which is called by his name, aims at facilitating the\n  service and lessening the burden, and if a person complains that\n  certain precepts cause him pain and great trouble, he cannot have\n  thought of the habits and doctrines that were general in those days.\n  Let him consider the difference between a man burning his own son in\n  serving his god, and our burning a pigeon to the service of our God.\n  Scripture relates, for even their sons and their daughters they burn\n  in the fire to their gods (Deut. xii. 31). This was the way in which\n  the heathen worshipped their gods, and instead of such a sacrifice we\n  have the burning of a pigeon or a handful of flour in our worship. In\n  accordance with this fact, the Israelites, when disobedient, were\n  rebuked by God as follows: \"O My people, what have I done unto thee?\n  and wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against me\" (Mic. vi. 3).\n  Again, \"Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness?\n  Wherefore say my people, We are miserable; we will come no more unto\n  thee\" (Jer. ii. 31); that is to say, Through which of the commandments\n  has the Law become burdensome to the Israelites, that they renounce\n  it? In the same manner God asks the people, \"What iniquity have your\n  fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?\" etc. (ibid. ii.\n  5). All these passages express one and the same idea.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the great principle which you must never lose sight of.\n  <strong>After having stated this principle, I repeat that the object of the Sanctuary was to create in the hearts of those who enter it certain\n  feelings of awe and reverence, in accordance with the command, \"You\n  shall reverence my sanctuary\" (Lev. xix. 30). But when we continually\n  see an object, however sublime it may be, our regard for that object\n  will be lessened, and the impression we have received of it will be\n  weakened. Our Sages, considering this fact, said that we should not\n  enter the Temple whenever we liked, and pointed to the words: \"Make\n  thy foot rare in the house of thy friend\" (Prov. xxv. 17). For this\n  reason the unclean were not allowed to enter the Sanctuary, although\n  there are so many kinds of uncleanliness, that [at a time] only a few\n  people are clean. For even if a person does not touch a beast that\n  died of its own accord (Lev. xi. 27), he can scarcely avoid touching\n  one of the eight kinds of creeping animals (ibid. 29, seq.), the dead\n  bodies of which we find at all times in houses, in food and drink, and\n  upon which we frequently tread wherever we walk; and, if he avoids\n  touching these, he may touch a woman in her separation (ibid. xv. 18),\n  or a male or female that have a running issue (ibid. ver. 1, seq. and\n  25, seq.), or a leper (ibid. xiii. 46), or their bed (ibid. xv. 5).\n  Escaping these, he may become unclean by cohabitation with his wife,\n  or by pollution (ibid. 15), and even when he has cleansed himself from\n  any of these kinds of uncleanliness, he cannot enter the Sanctuary\n  till after sunset; but not being enabled to enter the Sanctuary at\n  night time, although he is clean after sunset, as may be inferred from\n  Middot and Tamid, he is again, during the night, subject to becoming\n  unclean either by cohabiting with his wife or by some other source of\n  uncleanliness, and may rise in the morning in the same condition as\n  the day before. All this serves to keep people away from the\n  Sanctuary, and to prevent them from entering it whenever they liked.\n  Our Sages, as is well known, said, \"Even a clean person may not enter\n  the Sanctuary for the purpose of performing divine service, unless he\n  takes previously a bath.\" By such acts the reverence [for the\n  Sanctuary] will continue, the right impression will be produced which\n  leads man, as is intended, to humility.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The easier the diffusion of uncleanliness is, the more difficult and\n  the more retarded is its purification. Most easily is uncleanliness\n  communicated by the dead body to those who are under the same roof,\n  especially to relatives. The purification can only be completed by\n  means of the ashes of the red heifer, however scarce it may be, and\n  only in seven days (Num. xix. 11). The uncleanness caused by a woman\n  having running issue or during her separation is more frequent than\n  that caused by contact with unclean objects: seven days are therefore\n  required for their purification (Lev. xv. 19, 28), whilst those that\n  touch them are only unclean one day (ibid. vii. 18). Males or females\n  that are unclean through running issue, and a woman after childbirth,\n  must in addition bring a sacrifice, because their uncleanness occurs\n  less frequently than that of women in their separation. <strong>All these\n  cases of uncleanliness, viz., running issue of males or females,\n  menstruations, leprosy, dead bodies of human beings, carcases of\n  beasts and creeping things, and issue of semen, are sources of dirt\n  and filth. We have thus shown that the above precepts are very useful\n  in many respects. First, they keep us at a distance from dirty and\n  filthy objects; secondly, they guard the Sanctuary; thirdly, they pay\n  regard to an established custom (for the Sabeans submitted to very\n  troublesome restrictions when unclean, as you will soon hear);\n  fourthly, they lightened that burden for us; for we are not impeded\n  through these laws in our ordinary occupations by the distinction the\n  Law makes between that which is unclean and that which is clean. For\n  this distinction applies only in reference to the Sanctuary and the\n  holy objects connected with it: it does not apply to other cases. \"She\n  shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary\" (Lev. xii.\n  4). Other persons [that do not intend to enter the Sanctuary or touch\n  any holy thing], are not guilty of any sin if they remain unclean as\n  long as they like, and eat, according to their pleasure, ordinary food\n  that has been in contact with unclean things.</strong> But the practice of\n  the Sabeans, even at present general in the East, among the few still\n  left of the Magi, was to keep a menstruous woman in a house by\n  herself, to burn that upon which she treads, and to consider as\n  unclean every one that speaks with her: even if a wind passed over her\n  and a clean person, the latter was unclean in the eyes of the Sabeans.\n  See the difference between this practice and our rule, that \"whatever\n  services a wife generally does to her husband, she may do to him in\n  her separation\"; only cohabitation is prohibited during the days of\n  her uncleanness. Another custom among the Sabeans, which is still\n  widespread, is this: whatever is separated from the body, as hair,\n  nail, or blood, is unclean; every barber is therefore unclean in their\n  estimation, because he touches blood and hair; whenever a person\n  passes a razor over his skin he must take a bath in running water.\n  Such burdensome practices were numerous among the Sabeans, whilst we\n  apply the laws that distinguish between the unclean and the clean only\n  with regard to hallowed things and to the Sanctuary. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp183.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, emphasis added.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Essentially, there is nothing inherently bad or wrong or spiritually deficient about ritual impurity. It is either a physical uncleanness, or a legal state of being designed to keep one from frequenting the Holy Temple.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Isaac_Bekhor_Shor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Bechor Shor</a> (Exodus 15:26) also explains ritual impurity as actually being physical uncleanness, and God was doing us a favor by keeping us from these sources of defilement, as it prevents disease.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כמו שהרופא שומר מאכל האדם ומתקנו שלא יבא עליו שום חולי כן אני אשמור\n  אותך שלא תבא לידי חולי כמו שהמתקתי לך המים שלא יזיקו לך וכן הזהיר\n  הקב\"ה על ישראל נבילות שקצים ורמסים ובהמות טמאות ועופות טמאים ודגים\n  טמאים שהם מזיקים וממאיסים גופו של אדם כי האוכלם נמאס ומזוהם וגם הפרישם\n  מנגעים ומזבין ומזבות ויולדות ונידות ומנבלת אדם ובהמה ומנגעי אדם ובתים\n  ובגדים שכל אילו מביאין אותם לידי זיהום כי כל דבר שהכתוב קוראו טמא\n  מיאוס הוא כי טמא לשון מיאוס כמו שכתוב ביחזקאל והיא בגללי צאת האדם\n  תעוגינה [לעיניהם ויאמר ה'] ככה יאכלו [בני] ישראל [את] לחמם טמא בגוים\n  אלמא טמא לשון מיאוס וכן אמרו רבותי' כל האוכל פת בלא ניגוב ידים כאילו\n  אוכל לחם טמא מפני שהוא מאוס כשידיו לחים הלחם נמאס מליחלוחית מי ידיו\n  ומביאין זה הפסוק לראיה ככה יאכלו [בנ\"י] את לחמם טמא שהוא לשון מיאוס\n  וזהו כי אני ה' רופאך שאפרישך מכל המיאוסין הללו כי המיאוס מביא את האדם\n  לידי חליות וכן הוא אומר וברך את לחמך ואת מימיך והסירותי מחלה מקרבך\n  ואינו אומר כי אני ה' רופאך שתהיה חולה וארפאך דאם כך הוי קללה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The background of the assumption is probably the following two sources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=102a&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 102a</a>, according to which Jeroboam decreed that anyone who goes to Jerusalem would be killed</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הם העמיקו משלי אני אמרתי כל שאינו עולה לרגל עובר בעשה והם אמרו כל העולה לרגל ידקר בחרב</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=121b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Batra 121b</a>, which says that Hosea son of Elah, the last king of Israel, removed Jeroboam's decree not to go to Jerusalem on the fifteenth day of Av</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יום שביטל בו הושע בן אלה פרדסאות [שומרים - רש\"י] שהושיב ירבעם על הדרכים שלא יעלו ישראל לרגל</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Despite the guards that Jeroboam is said to have placed, we do see some travel between Israel and Judah. Naboth the Jezreelite went to Jerusalem and is specifically condemned for <em>not</em> going to one time  by the midrash (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?mefaresh=shimoni&book=10&perek=21\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yalkut Shim'oni Kings 221</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נבות היה קולו נאה והיה עולה לירושלים והיו כל ישראל מתכנסין לשמוע את קולו.\n  פעם אחת לא עלה והעידו עליו בני בליעל ואבד מן העולם. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition, the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r2904.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ta'anit 4:4</a>) implies that people were not prevented from passing the border if they didn't specifically go to bring bikkurim (or presumably for hakhel or other forms of worship in Jerusalem), and that people who wanted to bring bikkurim were able to disguise it in order to fool the guards into letting them pass:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל מי שהיה כשר וירא חטא באותו הדור היה מביא את בכוריו ונותנן לתוך הסל ומחפה אותן קציעות ונוטל את העלי ונותן את הסל על כתיפו ונוטל את העלי בידו.  וכיון שהיה מגיע באותו המשמר היה אומר לו לאיכן אתה הולך והוא אומר לו איני הולך אלא לעשות מעט קציעות הללו כפות אחת של דבילה בעלי הזה שבידי.  וכיון שהיה עובר את אותו המשמר היה מעטרן ומעלה אותן לירושלם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Please leave your answer. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Malbim lists the following distinctions:</p>\n\n<p>ארר (the noun form of which is מארה) - A curse which has real effects. Thus we always find (with one exception) that curses from Hashem are in the form of ארור, as they have real effects upon the accursed or his possessions.</p>\n\n<p>קלל - A curse which is more of an insult or disgrace. Thus, all curses directed towards Hashem are in the form of קללה, as in כי יקלל אלקיו - Vayikra 24:15 (or קבב, as in ויקוב את ה - Vayikra 24:10), as they do not have any real effect. The word is related to the word קל, which means light, because the curse lessens the image of the accursed.</p>\n\n<p>קבב - A curse which is spelled out in detail. It comes from the same root as נוקב, as in נקבה שכרך עלי, which means to specify in detail.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim to Shemos 22:27 (#188), Bamidbar 22:6, Iyov 3:8.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim in several places understands אלה to be a language of a vow or declaration, as opposed to a curse.

    "content": "# \"One in 5, one in 50, two in 600,000\" - can this be called a Geulah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Different Midrashim give different estimates on the number of Jews actually exiting Egypt, ranging from one in 5 (חמושים) and up to 2 in 600,000, the rest dying in the Plague of Darkness. </p>\n\n<p>I was trying to explain this to my son, just picture it, say the Moshiah is coming tomorrow and out of 6M Jews in Israel anything from 5M to 5.999999M die and the rest have all the fun of the Geulah.</p>\n\n<p>This does not sound so much of a Geulah, for that was exactly Moses claim not to kill Jews in the desert when G-d offered to \"re-start\" the Jewish nation from Moses.

Please help.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>For reference, here is the text of this Midrash (this version is from Tanchuma Beshalach):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחמשים עלו בני ישראל אחד מחמשה, ויש אומרים אחד מחמשים, ויש אומרים אחד מחמש מאות, רבי נהוראי אומר העבודה לא אחד מחמשת אלפים, ואימתי מתו בימי האפלה שהיו קוברין ישראל מתיהן ומצרים יושבין בחשך, ישראל הודו ושבחו על שלא ראו שונאיהם ושמחו בפורענותן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This Midrash about large numbers of Jews dying before leaving Egypt, can be explained literally according to some of the opinions found in the Midrashim (like 1 in 5, maybe even 1 in 50), by some Mefarshim (see Sabbahillel's comments above, and Oznaim Latorah).  However, in this case, it has already been noted by Rishonim that the question is better than the answer, and that in fact, taking this literally will undermine the entire Nes of Yetzias Mitzraiyim, as well as go against a number of Pesukim.</p>\n<p>My answer (in the comments as well) was that this was simply a Derasha based on the words Vachamushim, and really many fewer people died.  However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Hirsch_Weiss\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaac Hirsch Weiss</a> in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33719&st=&pgnum=96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peirush Midos Sofrim Beshalach 1</a> (which is meant to be a Peshat explanation of the Mechilta?), the idea of exaggeration is refuted, as he feels that a Lashon of Shevuah (made by Rabbi Nehorai) would be inappropriate unless that person though that they were telling the exact truth.  (He notes there that according to the version that we have in the Tanchuma, this would mean that there were about 3 Billion Jews in Egypt, which is obviously impossible, and he admits he cannot understand this Midrash.)</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra to Shemos 13:18 says that this opposes the entire concept of Yetzias Mitzrayim, I have bolded various points below.  He concludes that perhaps the one who said it intended it with some deeper meaning, (although he does not offer what it may be):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ודרש (מכילתא שמות י״ג:י״ח): שעלו אחד מחמש מאות, דבר יחיד הוא, ועליו מחלוקת, ואיננו קבלה כלל</strong>. ודי לנו הצער שאנחנו בו עם חכמי ישמעאל, שהם אומרים: איך יתכן מחמשים וחמשה זכרים, שיולידו במאתים ועשר שנים שש מאות אלף זכרים מבן עשרים. והנה היו כפל הכפל עם הטף והנשים, כי לא חשבו יעקב ובניו, כי לא הולידו במצרים עוד, כי לא מצאנו יחוש רק אל היורדים מצרימה, ולא ספרו הבנות. ותשובתנו: כי הנה יעקב לבדו הוליד בארבעים שנה ושש שנים תשעה וששים בנים ובני בנים, ועל זה המספר יכפלו עד שיהיו כפלי כפלים מהמספר הכתוב. אז השיבו לנו עוד: כי יעקב ובניו לא הולידו נקבות כי אם שתים, וזה היה במעשה נס, ואל תספור כן ליורדי מצרים. ועוד שיעקב היו לו ארבע נשים, ומי יבאר שכן היו לכל אחד מבני בניו. גם אנחנו השיבונו: תנו לנו שלשה עשר זכרים, בין בנים ובני בנים, בארבעים ושש שנים, והנה יהיו יותר מן שבע מאות, ובסוף תשעים ושנים יהיו תשעת אלפים ושלש מאות, ובסוף מאה ושלשים ושמונה יהיו יותר ממאת אלף, ובסוף מאה ושמונה ושתים יהיו יותר מאלף אלפים וחמש מאות אלף, ועוד לא הגענו למאתים ועשר שנים. גם יתנו לנו עשרה בארבעים ושש שנים, ויספיקו. <strong>ועוד כי הכתוב אומר על מכת ערוב: ושמתי פדות בין עמי ובין עמך (שמות ח׳:י״ט).</strong> ואמר בספר תהלות: ישלח בם ערוב ויאכלם (תהלים ע״ח:מ״ה). <strong>והנה במכה שאכלה את מצרים נמלט ישראל, גם מת רוב מקנה מצרים בדבר, וממקנה ישראל לא מת אחד (שמות ט׳:ו׳)</strong>, <strong>ובמכת בכורים לא מת מישראל אחד</strong>, <strong>ובמכת חושך כתיב: ולכל בני ישראל היה אור (שמות י׳:כ״ג).</strong> <strong>והנה במכות שמתו בהם המצריים לא מתו ישראלים,</strong> ואף כי במכה שלא מת מצרי ממנה. <strong>ואיך מתו כל ישראל בחשך עד שלא נשאר מהם רק חלק מחמש מאות. והנה לא היה לישראל אור במושבותם,1 רק מחשכי דבר ואפלות מות. ואחר שלא נשאר כי אם חלק קטון מעם רב, הנה לא היתה גאולה לישראל כי אם רעה חולה, וזה הפך הכתוב.</strong> והכלל: דרש הוא, ואין לסמוך עליו, <strong>אולי שאמרו בתחילה היה לנו סוד</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya/Bechayei (same link as Ibn Ezra) explains the Midrash as each of these numbers (one in 5, 50, or 500) to balance the later Midrash of Veshalishim al Kulo (3 or 30 or 300 Egyptians per Jew), to equal 900 million \"Angels of harm\" that Hashem came down with, so that there would be 900 million Egyptians chasing the Jews according to each opinion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וע״ד המדרש וחמשים עלו אחד מחמשה וארבעה חלקים מתו בג׳ ימי החשך כדי שלא יראו המצריים בפורענותן, ויש אומרים אחד מחמשים ויש אומרים אחד מחמש מאות מכאן ואילך צא וחשוב. ושלשים על כלו, יש אומרים יצאו עליהם ג׳ מצריים על כל אחד ואחד מישראל ויש אומרים שלשים ויש אומרים ג׳ מאות, ע״כ במדרש.\nובאור הענין כי מי שאומר אחד מחמשה א״כ היו תחלה ישראל ה׳ פעמים ס׳ רבוא שהם שלש מאות רבוא ודעתו כי ושלשים על כולו באורו שלש מאות מצריים על כלו על כל אחד ואחד מישראל, ויעלה העם תשעים אלף רבוא שיצאו המצריים עליהם, וכן מצינו במדרש כשירד הקב״ה למצרים ירדו תשעים אלף רבוא של מלאכי חבלה במחנה מצרים. ומי שאמר אחד מחמשים היו ישראל ג׳ אלף רבוא ודעתו כי ושלשים באורו שלשים על כל אחד ואחד הרי ל׳ פעמים ג׳ אלף רבוא הם תשעים אלף רבוא. ומי שאומר אחד מחמש מאות היו ישראל תחלה שלשים אלף רבוא ודעתו כי ושלשים ג׳ על כל אחד ואחד והם תשעים אלף רבוא. הרי חשבון כל החכמים מכוון שיצאו המצריים עליהם בתשעים אלף רבוא בין למי שאומר אחד מחמשה בין למי שאומר אחד מחמשים בין למי שאומר אחד מחמש מאות עם צרוף החשבון ושלשים על כלו לפי דעתו וסברתו של כל אחד מהם וכנגדן הוציא עליהם הקב״ה תשעים אלף מלאכי חבלה זה באור המדרש הזה. ותמצא מלת וחמשים חסר וא״ו וחמשים כתיב ללמדך שהתורה שנתנה לחמשים יום היתה תכלית מה שעלו בני ישראל מארץ מצרים, ועוד יש בו רמז לחמשים פעמים שנזכרה יציאת מצרים בתורה. )</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What comes from all of this, is that teaching such a Midrash as actual, factual Peshat is harmful to the story of Yetzias Mitzrayim, and should be avoided.</p>\n\n\n",

Others, however, say that it is permitted to use a zipper only if it is meant to be unzipped in a short time.</p>\n<p>Shibbolei HaLeket (108; cited in Beit Yosef 340:7) writes that it is permitted to connect two pieces of clothing using loops and hooks and it isn’t considered Tofer. Based on this Shibbolei HaLeket, Yalkut Yosef (Shabbat vol. 5 pg. 140) permits using zippers on Shabbat, since the connection between the two pieces only is an external connection with interlocking pieces similar to loops and hooks. Rabbi Mordechai Willig (Halachipedia Article 5773 #13), Shemirat Shabbat KeHilchata 15:74, Sh”t Betzel Chachma 3:92, 39 Melachos (Rabbi Ribiat, vol 3, pg 818), and The Shabbos Home (Rabbi Simcha Cohen, vol 1, pg 75) agree. Rabbi Sobolofsky (“Tofer 2” min 7-8) said that another reason to be lenient is because its normal usage is to zip and unzip it, similar to closing a door (see Mishna Brurah 340:17).</p>\n<p>Rav Soloveitchik (quoted by Rav Hershel Schachter, Halachipedia Article 5773 #13) suggested that since the small zipper teeth interlock so much so that it becomes like one material, it could be an issue of Tofer. He added that using a zipper that one uses all the time is permitted just like a very temporary knot. Sheivet HaLevi 3:51, Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky (Emet LeYacov 317:3), and Rav Yisrael Belsky (cited by [Halachically Speaking 3:14:3) agree but add that one shouldn’t zip a lining into one’s winter coat, as that is meant to be left for a long period of time. Rav Hershel Shechter (quoted by Rabbi Rosner between minutes 37:30 and 38:30) is strict for this opinion and doesn’t zipper his Shabbat Tallit bag because of this. Rabbi Rosner (between minutes 36:30 and 37:30) explained that even those who are strict to consider zippers Tofer would be lenient regarding pants zippers because anything which will be unzipped in 24 hours is considered temporary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This may be due to the fact that the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Jewish_Encyclopedia_Volume_2.pdf&page=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JE's simplyfied system</a> didn't differentiate between ת and תּ, which they <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/preface#23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">based</a> on recommendations of the <em>Geneva Congress of Orientalists.*</em> There were many authors and journals, who did this distinction, while there were some others that didn't (see the tables in <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23503254\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Werner Weinberg's paper</a>). To illustrate the randomness,  the American Library Association used only <em>t</em> in <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/catalogrulesaut01assogoog#page/n89/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1908</a>, then both <em>t</em> and <em>th</em> in <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.60524/2015.60524.A-L-A-Catalog-Rules-Author-And-Titles-Entries#page/n373/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1941</a>, and reverted back to only <em>t</em> in  <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/alacatalogingrul007642mbp#page/n276/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1949</a>, while still having <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.60524/2015.60524.A-L-A-Catalog-Rules-Author-And-Titles-Entries#page/n109/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">inconsistent</a> <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/alacatalogingrul007642mbp#page/n143/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples</a> (Japheth vs. Sheshet).</p>\n\n<p>Although one is clear, all these methods follow the Sefardic pronunciation (no <em>s</em> for ת). Almost none of the English books had the Ashkenazi system <em>(aulom, aylom, oylom</em> etc. for עוֹלָם), but were using the simplified one proposed by the JE either only with <em>t</em> or with <em>t</em> and <em>th.</em> Two extremely influential 20th century books in the English-speaking Jewish world, <em>The Pentateuch and Haftorahs</em> edited by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hertz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hertz</a> and the <em>Soncino Talmud</em> edited by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Epstein</a> had the <em>t/th</em> system, just as in your examples.</p>\n\n<p>Even though now it's almost impossible to reconstruct the intent of individual authors, Bargès made clear that without dagesh he proposed a soft and aspirated sound, while Weinberg (p. 4.) is more explicit by giving a good example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a congregation called itself <em>\"Adath Yeshurun,\"</em> [...] the rendition of ת by <em>th</em> could be either a German transliteration (in old orthography) to be pronounced /t/ or an English transliteration-transcription, rendering the pronunciation of undageshed ת as that of unvoiced English <em>th.</em> The original intention was then to realize the pronunciation /adát (or adáθ) yəšurún/. But the congregational member will usually pronounce it the way the spelling suggests, namely /ædəθ ǧéšərən/.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, the latter <em>th</em> is closer to the original <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberian_Hebrew#Orthography\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiberian pronunciation</a> (which is preserved by the Yemenites) and was strongly advocated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bension_Kohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefath Emeth</a>.</p>\n\n<p><sub>* It was in 1894, but I couldn't find any reference on this issue in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/actesdudiximeco00unkngoog\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">report</a>.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

Another proof is the Rama who states that the cheese made from\nmany unchecked cows who were only considered kosher by merit of a\nchazaka remains kosher. This gemara is cited by the Rosh (Chullin\n7:37) for a similar point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also see R Michoel Zylberman from YU's Kollel wrote <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiywPqxqo_xAhWKyoUKHX98C1YQFjALegQIAxAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdownload.yutorah.org%2F2007%2F1065%2F750416.PDF&usg=AOvVaw3YMzRe3kAPIeCRZXZQZj7b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an entire article on the topic</a> in the Journal of Halacha bringing different proofs and concluding with the reasoning above. See especially pp. 106 and following.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm not sure that all Cholov Yisrael dairy producers do this; there have been a number of questions in the past about whether many dairy cows are <em>treifa.</em></p>\n\n<p>In a theoretical sense, we know that some dairy cows -- let's say more than 1.6% but less than 50% -- are <em>treifos</em>. If I have one cow on my farm, Bessie, then <em>rov</em> says assume Bessie is kosher, so Bessie's milk is 100% kosher. Okay I walk into a modern dairy setup with a thousand cows' milk all mixed together; if 4% of those cows are treifa, does that mean my milk is 4% treifa and 96% kosher? If so it's not kosher! <a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/_pdfs/55-70%20Bleich.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi J. David Bleich writes about this in <em>Tradition</em> Spring 2008</a>. The answer seems to be based on a <em>ruba de-leisa kaman.</em> If I don't know that any particular cow on my farm is treifa, even if I know that the general population in theory has a 4% treifa rate, then I assume each of my cows is 100% kosher, and thus the milk is 100% kosher.</p>\n\n<p>So your question would only be if a mashgiach walks onto a dairy farm and knows specifically that there are one or more treifa cows here. Which I doubt is usually the case in industrial-scale <em>chalav stam</em> production.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>From the Chashash Terefa point of view, the unsupervised milk is better</strong>. Because nobody would try to check if a cow is Terefa. Even if they decide to eat it, the non Jews would not verify if the animal is terefa. So we have both Chazaka and Rov. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The first is <strong>Chazaka</strong>, Milk cows are greater than one year, so they wasn't terefot when they born. The chazaka is a Chazaka demeYkara. This point is a Machloket Rishonim in Gemara Chulin 11a. See Tosfot paragraph Atia. Tosfot rules that this Chazaka is not valid because the non-terefut was not clear at time. We know that the cow wasn't terefa before 12 month because a terefa cannot live 12 months. </p></li>\n<li><p>Even if the Chazaka per se is not valid, we have a <strong>Rov</strong>. Most animals are healthy. Moreover, Rav Shimshon bar Shimshon says there is a Chazaka that come from the strength of Rov (he think that Rov is a Berur equivalent). That is, even if a cow becomes Terefa and you have cheese from it, Rashba (there) says that from the strength of the Chazaka we say that it became terefa after the confection of the cheese. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Anyways, in non supervised dairy, there is no case of discovery of Terefa. Even more, if it was the case, milks of all cows are mixed and Zil batar Ruba, the mixture of Chalav Terefa with a majority of Chalav not Terefa is cancelled. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# B'nai Yisra'el complaining about water and food - sometimes punished, sometimes not\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There were numerous times that B'nai Yisra'el complained to Moshe (and, sometimes, Aharon) about the lack of food or water in the desert. But, it seems that sometimes G-d punishes them and sometimes not. Examples:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Not punished</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At Marah (Shemot 15:24) </li>\n<li>Mahn (Shemot 16:2)</li>\n<li>Refidim (Shemot 17:2)\nalthough according to a number of commentaries, the reason that\nAmalek attacked them was a form of punishment. But the Torah, itself,\ndoesn't indicate any punishment.</li>\n<li>Kadesh (Bemidbar 20:3)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Punished</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Complaint about the mahn in Bemidbar 11</li>\n<li>After leaving Hor Hahar  (Bemidbar 21:4)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What was the difference in these situations? Was there some \"leniency\" in the first two or three situations because the nation was \"new\" and the people were still earning and getting accustomed to Moshe's leadership? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that the situations were different. For example, at Mara they came and found water that was impossible to drink. After Eilim, they found themselves in the dessert with nothing visible as to how they would be given food or water. As slaves they had been accustomed to their masters making sure that food and drink were always available. They had not yet learned that Hashem was indeed providing for them. In fact, Hashem was already about to provide them with the <em>man</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As Rav Hirsch explains in Beshalach 17:5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In these two verses, Hashem tells Moshe what would have occurred even\n  without the people having \"complained\". They were to be given daily\n  only and exactly the requirements for that day to accustom them to\n  look up to Hashem, with confidence for the so-called petty necessities\n  of daily life, and to impress them with the certainty that each\n  individual man and each man's individual home is a special object to\n  which Hashem gives his attention:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that at Rephidim, they were indeed punished for panicking as Amalek attacked them when they lost control and started running to the well of Miriam. This was part of the lesson that they were supposed to learn.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9878#showrashi=true&v=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Verse 17:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The entire community of the children of Israel journeyed from the\n  desert of Sin to their travels by the mandate of the Lord. They\n  encamped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They still had water but had been accustomed to finding water already available. Here they complained (as Rav Hirsch points out)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here they were not yet making reproaches, did not refer to their\n  requirements, but as a justified claim, demanded water. Where we camp\n  there must be water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later in verse 3, Hashem let them get thirsty to show them the lesson.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The people thirsted there for water, and the people complained against\n  Moses, and they said, Why have you brought us up from Egypt to make me\n  and my children and my livestock die of thirst?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch shows that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From Rephidim to Horeb is but one station and from these verses seems\n  to have hardly been a day's journey. It seems that, had it not been\n  for their untimely murmurrings, Hashem would have let them feel the\n  scarcity in Rephidim and let them move on to Horeb, which was the real\n  goal of their wandering in the wilderness, and then there at Horeb, He\n  would let water gush out of the rock for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, at kadesh they were suddenly faced with the loss of the well that had accompanied them for forty years and which they assumed was their due. The sudden shock of the loss caused them to think that Moshe had made a mistake.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9948#v=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chukas 20:2</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The congregation had no water; so they assembled against Moses and\n  Aaron.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9939#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beha'aloscha 11:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The people were looking to complain, and it was evil in the ears of\n  the Lord. The Lord heard and His anger flared, and a fire from the\n  Lord burned among them, consuming the extremes of the camp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָֽאסַפְסֻף֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּקִרְבּ֔וֹ הִתְאַוּ֖וּ תַּֽאֲוָ֑ה</p>\n  \n  <p>But the rabble that they had taken in amongst them goaded themselves\n  on to desires</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which means that they deliberately tried to pretend to have complaints rather than being faced with problems that they had no precedent for dealing with. They were just attempting to make an excuse to complain.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9949#v=4&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chukas 21:4</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּסְע֞וּ מֵהֹ֤ר הָהָר֙ דֶּ֣רֶךְ יַם־ס֔וּף לִסְבֹ֖ב אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ\n  אֱד֑וֹם וַתִּקְצַ֥ר נֶֽפֶשׁ־הָעָ֖ם בַּדָּֽרֶךְ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and the soul of the people was impatient of the way</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is they became impatient as to the way of traveling and complained about something that they had regularly for the past 40 years. As a result, Hashem showed them that the ease and comfort that they had become accustomed to over the past forty years was an illusion. If they did not have the <code>לֶּ֖חֶם הַקְּלֹקֵֽל</code> and all the nissim that protected them, they would have been subject to the natural dangers of the dessert (like the fiery snakes).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Not punished:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּלֹּ֧נוּ הָעָ֛ם <strong>עַל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה</strong> לֵּאמֹ֖ר מַה־נִּשְׁתֶּֽה׃ (Shemos 15:24)</p>\n<p>וַיִּלּ֜וֹנוּ כׇּל־עֲדַ֧ת בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל <strong>עַל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה וְעַֽל־אַהֲרֹ֖ן</strong> בַּמִּדְבָּֽר׃ (Shemos 16:2)</p>\n<p>וַיָּ֤רֶב הָעָם֙ <strong>עִם־מֹשֶׁ֔ה</strong> וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ תְּנוּ־לָ֥נוּ מַ֖יִם וְנִשְׁתֶּ֑ה וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לָהֶם֙ מֹשֶׁ֔ה מַה־תְּרִיבוּן֙ עִמָּדִ֔י מַה־תְּנַסּ֖וּן אֶת־י״יֽ׃ (Shemos 17:2, repeated again in 17:3)</p>\n<p>וַיָּ֥רֶב הָעָ֖ם <strong>עִם־מֹשֶׁ֑ה</strong> וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ לֵאמֹ֔ר וְל֥וּ גָוַ֛עְנוּ בִּגְוַ֥ע אַחֵ֖ינוּ לִפְנֵ֥י י״י׃ (Bamidbar 20:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Punished:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְהִ֤י הָעָם֙ כְּמִתְאֹ֣נְנִ֔ים רַ֖ע <strong>בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י י״י֑</strong> וַיִּשְׁמַ֤ע <strong>י״י֙</strong> וַיִּ֣חַר אַפּ֔וֹ וַתִּבְעַר־בָּם֙ אֵ֣שׁ י״י֔ וַתֹּ֖אכַל בִּקְצֵ֥ה הַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃ (Bamidbar 11:1)</p>\n<p>וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר הָעָ֗ם <strong>בֵּֽאלֹהִים֮</strong> וּבְמֹשֶׁה֒ לָמָ֤ה הֶֽעֱלִיתֻ֙נוּ֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם לָמ֖וּת בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר כִּ֣י אֵ֥ין לֶ֙חֶם֙ וְאֵ֣ין מַ֔יִם וְנַפְשֵׁ֣נוּ קָ֔צָה בַּלֶּ֖חֶם הַקְּלֹקֵֽל׃ (Bamidbar 21:5, repeated again in 21:7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think I have noticed an important distinction, namely, that the nation speaks out directly against God in the instances where they are punished.

Therefore, Yaakov freed Bilhah and Zilpah when he married them. The way he freed them was with biah, which simultaneously freed them and was mekadesh them. However, Reuven held that biah doesn't free a shifchah and therefore felt that his father was never married to her, since Kiddushin <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.68a.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">doesn't work with a shifchah</a><sup>1</sup>.

He felt Yaakov wasn't married to her, only Leah. Also according to his shita, in theory he could be with Bilhah, since she's not his father's wife. So the verse considers it as if he was with her. This also gives new meaning to what the gemarra says: כל האומר ראובן חטא אינו אלא טועה, whoever says Reuven sinned is mistaken. A new way to read it is: Whoever says Reuven sinned (is wrong since), <strong>Reuven</strong> made a mistake (in pesak).

He posits that there is an inconsistency regarding the time that Yohyachin began ruling. But, of interest is the end that says that says that the 18 years refers to the 18th year of Nebuchadneztar's kingdom. Thus, it's possible that he was just a ruler, while not having any title as king.</p>\n\n\n",

Dr. Kennicott, as well as Michaelis, Rosenmuller, and Maurer defended their genuineness. So does Knobel, who complains that Rabbi Jacob Ben Chajim, in his Rabbinical Bible of 1525, has very improperly omitted these towns on the authority of the Masora, and that many editors have foolishly imitated him They have no doubt been omitted by the mistake of a copyist, who passed on from the אַרְבָע (four) of ver. 35 to that of ver. 37, omitting all that lay between.

(<a href=\"/q/88835/11532\">Some versions add them after 21:35</a>, but the conclusion of the Radak followed by the Minchas Shai is that they're not supposed to be there).  Rav Hai Gaon, quoted by the Radak, addresses the question, but just says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על פי דהכא לא חשיב להו בדברי הימים חשיב להו</p>\n<p>Even though it doesn't list them here, it lists them in Divrei Hayamim (1 6:63-64)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone explain why they're not listed in Yehoshua?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=39784#p=157&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Soferim on 21:38</a> suggests that when the cities were being allotted, there weren't suitable ones in Reuven's territory. (There are various criteria for them, listed in <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=25&daf=10&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos 10a</a> and codified from there in <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=11&rtype=%D7%98%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%A1%D7%98&hilchos=68&perek=8&halocha=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Hil. Rotzeach 8:8</a> - not too big or too small, in commercial areas, etc.) So the Leviim got, in effect, an IOU from Reuven to build four such cities in their territory and allocate them to the Leviim.</p>\n<p>(Now, one of them, Betzer, had already been chosen by Moshe in Devarim 4:43. It's possible that it was already suitable, but that Yehoshua didn't want to list just that one if he couldn't list all four. It's also possible that Moshe chose Betzer even though it didn't fit all those criteria, and then instructed Reuven to upgrade it accordingly - and that this job hadn't been completed by the time the lottery was being conducted.)</p>\n<p>By the way, Daas Soferim further notes, in his <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=39784#p=152&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary on 21:3</a>, that in the last census in the desert, the Leviim numbered only 23000 males one month and older.

Typical approaches are from Rosh Hashana to Rosh Hashana, or from January to December (so you know how much taxes you will pay).</p>\n\n<p>Even from year to year you can use \"credits\" from over donating in previous years. Remember most consider tsedaka a very worthwhile minhag, not a strict halacha (see beginning of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67389/11501\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Both R Avrohom Chaim Feuer in <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1578195144\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The tsedakka treasury</a> \nand R Shimon Taub's in <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578195893.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The laws of tsedakah and maaser</a>) <strong>allow <em>yearly accounting</em> of once's maaser, i.e., you do not need to give maaser as income arrives as long as you \"clear the account\" regularly</strong>. This is also the allowance of <strong>The Chofetz Chaim</strong> (in Ahavas Chesed 18:2).</p>\n\n<p>As I wrote <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67389/11501\">here</a>, the Chofetz Chaim offers the following guidance on setting up a maaser system (with personal additions to make it practical to the 21st century)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Set up a separate ledger (or a spreadsheet) to track earnings, any business expenses, taxes and donations</li>\n<li>Designate a specific date (e.g., Rosh Hashana) to mark the end of an accounting period where you \"close the books\" - should be at least once a year - can be more frequent</li>\n<li>At the time of the closing period, calculate profits, deduct losses and acceptable expenses and the amount of maaser</li>\n<li>Deduct all donations already made and distribute immediately whatever you owe (i.e., the difference between maaser and previous donations)</li>\n<li>If you have given more than your planned maaser, some authorities allow to carry over to the next accounting period. Even those that are strict allow it if you stipulate (orally) that you may deduct from your maaser obligations at all times any donations you make at any time you desire</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think the halacha is that the obligation to give <em>Ma'aser</em> (10%)  applies when one gets a unit of money i.e a paycheck. Once one obtains the money, in order to use it for his own personal needs he must give 10% of the money he has now.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have sources off hand though.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You confuse Maaser and Zedaka (charity):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Zedaka is practically unlimited and not refundable. You can give any amount to anyone anytime. </p></li>\n<li><p>Maaser is a sort of \"10% tax\" on your net income. Opinions differ, but most hold that once you <strong>knowingly</strong> give more than 10%, the surplus is counted as a Zedaka, not as a future Maaser, as one can not pay taxes for future income.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

(my own very loose translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How could the Gra attack the Bahag so harshly?  Isn't the Bahag (The Baal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halachot_Gedolot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachos Gedolos</a>) a  Gaon who lived close to a thousand years before the Gra.

Orach Chaim 287 -   <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_25.html#HtmpReportNum0045_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן רפז - נחום אבלים ובקור חולים בשבת</a> - states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סימן רפז - נחום אבלים ובקור חולים בשבת<br/>\n  ובו סעיף אחד <br/>\n  <strong>א</strong> יְכוֹלִים  לְנַחֵם אֲבֵלִים בְּשַׁבָּת, וְכֵן יְכוֹלִים לְבַקֵּר אֶת הַחוֹלֶה. וְלֹא יֹאמַר לוֹ כַּדֶּרֶךְ שֶׁאוֹמֵר לוֹ בַּחֹל, אֶלָּא אוֹמֵר לוֹ: שַׁבָּת הִיא מִלִּזְעֹק  וּרְפוּאָה קְרוֹבָה לָבֹא, וְרַחֲמָיו מְרֻבִּים וְשִׁבְתּוֹ בְּשָׁלוֹם. <em>הגה: וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים דְּאֵין צָרִיךְ לוֹמַר וְרַחֲמָיו מְרֻבִּים, וְכֵן נָהֲגוּ (רַמְבַּ''ם פֶּרֶק כ''ד).</em> ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>One may comfort mourners and visit the sick on Shabbat, but one doesn't say to him (רְפוּאָה שְׁלֵמָה) as one says during the week, but rather <em>\"Shabbat is not a time to daven, healing should be soon, His mercy is great. Have a peaceful Shabbat.\"</em><br/>Rema: The custom is  not to include the words \"His mercy is great\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there any source for the popular custom of blessing a long list of people on Shabbat; some of whom are recuperating, convalescing or in <em>bad health</em>, but are nowhere near <em>deathly ill</em>, (thank Gcd)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R' <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binyamin_Shlomo_Hamburger\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Binyamin Shlomo Hamburger</a> wrote an extensive and thorough survey of the issue of praying for the ill on Shabbat in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53907&st=&pgnum=178\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Chitzei Gibborim</em> vol. 6</a> including his characteristic historical geographic breakdown of the positions and a survey of texts in historical Siddurim. You can find all the sources you want in that article, including discussion of the various leniencies that have been suggested throughout the ages.</p>\n\n<p>One famous later authority who struggled with the issue is the Magen Avraham at the end of OC 288, who proposes that the custom is relying on a minority opinion in Rishonim that simply/concisely phrased prayers are permitted (à la R Yossi, Shabbat 12b). As you note though, especially among Ashkenazi authorities, the simplest read of the vast majority of sources clearly prohibits it. Even the Arukh haShulchan, who is known for defending local customs, writes (287:2) \"I don't know who permitted this for them\" and offers no further defense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara[1] says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... One may not visit the sick on the Sabbath.[2] These are the words\nof Beis Shammal — But Beis Hillel permits these activities on the\nShabbath.[3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hillel says we should visit the sick because these are acts of kindness (Aruch HaShulchan, Orach Chaim 287:1). Jews are even encouraged to visit and pray for the recovery of non-Jews (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 151:12). Just as G-d, The Holy One, visited Abraham when the patriarch was sick (Chapter 18 Genesis), so, too, we should visit the sick. This is called called “imitatio deo.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, visited the sick ... so should you visit\nthe sick (Midrash Sifrei; Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 14a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara cites a Baraisa about visiting the sick on the Shabbath:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sages taught in a Baraisa: One who enters to visit a sick person\non the Shabbath SHOULD say: \"It is the Shabbath now, therefore we are\nprevented from crying out for your recovery, but recovery will come\nsoon.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that we should not pray to G-d on his behalf since this prayer will arouse weeping and sorrow. Rather, we are to offer him hope to lift his spirits (Ran).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And R' Meir says: One should say \"[The Sabbath] itself can have mercy\nand bring your recovery.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that if the sick person honors the Shabbat, perhaps he will merit a fast recovery. Thus, the Shabbat does not delay recovery but hastens it unaided by prayer (Maharsha)[4].</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R' Yehudah says: One should say: \"May the Omnipresent have mercy on\nyou and on the sick of Israel.\" R' Yose says: \"May the Omnipresent\nhave mercy on you among the sick of Israel.\"[5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By using Rabbi Yose's formula which groups the sick person together with the sick of Israel, the prayer, offered on the behalf of many, becomes a dual prayer (Rashi). Although R' Yehudah and Yose agree with the Tannaim that this prayer should not be directed to G-d on the Shabbat (Maharsha).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Shevna, a prominent person in Jerusalem, would enter to visit a\nsick person on the Shabbat, he would say: \"Peace.\" And when leaving, he\nwould say: \"The Shababth prevents us from crying out for your\nrecovery, but recovery will come soon. [G-d's] mercies are many, and\nrest on the Sabbath in peace.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that G-d's mercies are so great that He will heal the sick on the Shabbat even without prayer. The person must observe Shabbat in peace. Shevna suggests one begins and ends their visit with the word shalom (peace), which is a Name of G-d.[6]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara specifies which of these Tannaic opinions is the source for\nthe following Amoraic statement:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With whom does this teaching states by R' Chanina accord? One who has\na sick person in his household must include him together with the sick\nof Israel when praying on his behalf. With whom does this teaching\naccord? It accords with R' Yose. (This is the view of R' Yose). the\nGemara cites another teaching by R' Chanina on this topic: And R'\nChanina said: It was with difficulty that [the Rabbis] permitted one\nto console mourners and to visit the sick on the Shabbath (because of\nthe distress felt by the visitors (Rashi).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, a person requires the assistance of the ministering angels to send his prayers to G-d (Rashi to Sotah 33a, see also Rabbeinu Yonah to Berachos folio 7a).</p>\n<p>[1] Talmud Bavli 12a4 (tractate Shabbos, the Artscroll addition)</p>\n<p>[2] Because this activity causes anguish (Rashi, see Rif and Ran)</p>\n<p>[3] Hillel referred to Isaiah's words \"your business\" to mean that personal needs are forbidden but not a mitzvah</p>\n<p>[4] Although he must ignore his pian</p>\n<p>[5] Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 12b1</p>\n<p>[6] See 10b (Maharsha)</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Mordechai Eliyahu (Ma'amar Mordechai vol. 3 Kedushat HaAretz Siman 3) seems to hold that way, as well. However, Piskei Teshuvot (224:9) concedes that one who does recite the Beracha on glamorous Batei Kenesiot and Batei Midrashot in Eretz Yisrael isn't out of line.

The Gemara explains that this includes even a mamzer.<br/>\nביבמות כב ע\"א כותבת: \"מי שיש לו בן מכל מקום - פוטר אשת אביו מן הייבום\".‏</p>\n\n<p>The Minchas Chinuch explains:.<br/>\nומסבירה שם הגמרא כי הכוונה היא לבן ממזר. המנחת חינוך דן בשאלה אם אדם שיש לו בן ממזר קיים את מצוות פריה ורביה או לא. ניתן, כמובן, לחלק בין ממזר בהיתר - גר שנשא ממזרת, לבין ממזר באיסור. הירושלמי כותב שבכל ממזר יש קיום למצוות פריה ורביה, והמנחת חינוך עצמו מביא שתי אפשרויות בהבנת הירושלמי:‏</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>כוונתו רק לממזר בהיתר.‏</p></li>\n<li><p>למרות שממזר באיסור הוא מצווה הבאה בעבירה - הביאה היא רק הכשר מצווה ולכן הולדת הממזר אינה נחשבת למצווה הבאה בעבירה.‏</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regarding the mitzvah of Pru urevu, the Minchas Chinuch has 2 options with regards to a forbidden relationship from the Torah that results in the birth of a mamzer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Only someone that is permitted to marry a mamzer, e.g. a convert, can the child fulfill \"Pru urevu\". A child from a forbidden relationship is a mitzvah Haba beaveira.</p></li>\n<li><p>Despite the Aveira caused by the relationship since the zera is only a means to the end but not directly resulting the child to be born (there is 9 months of pregnancy and many stages), the children (male and female) have made him fulfill his obligation of Pru urevu and this is not a mitzvah Haba beaveira.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So a forbidden relationship might still not be zera levatala since a child is born from the result (for which one might even achieve Pru urevu) even though it is a result of a grave aveirah that is punishable by death.</p>\n\n<p>Since premarital relations are forbidden miderabanan and therefore the children are not mamzerim (as I have proven here  <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/87703/does-devarim-2318-prohibit-pre-marital-relations/87786#87786\">Does Devarim 23:18 prohibit pre-marital relations</a>) the seed is definitely not zera levatala as maimless children are produced from the zera and one has definitely fulfilled the mitzvah of Pru urevu (despite transgressing a severe rabbinical enactment for which the punishment is also death bidei shamayim).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion: the child is kosher and the zera was not wasted and has achieved its purpose of forming a child.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>In short, No, WoS way is by having no female \"receptacle\", no matter what way.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to dig deeper, you should differentiate the Halachical prohibition from the Kabbalic one. I cited the later. Halachicly wise opinions differ vastly, some may call WoS for anything but having one's legitimate wife in ready to get pregnant way (even for the end of month cycle or already pregnant), but I regard it more as for educational purposes only.</p>\n\n<p>To your second question, very same rules apply here. As people love credible citations, here's one from Rambam (IB 21,9) regarding one's wife, but it applies in general:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"י  [ט] אשתו של אדם, מותרת היא לו; לפיכך כל מה שאדם רוצה לעשות באשתו, עושה--בועל בכל עת שירצה, ומנשק בכל אבר שירצה, ובא עליה בין כדרכה, <strong>בין שלא כדרכה, בין דרך אברים</strong>.  ואף על פי כן, מידת חסידות שלא יקל אדם את ראשו לכך, ושיקדש עצמו בשעת תשמיש, כמו שביארנו בהלכות דעות; ולא יסור מדרך העולם ומנהגו, שאין דבר זה אלא כדי לפרות ולרבות.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But as I said, Halachic views differ vastly!</p>\n\n<p>The real question here is not WoS but:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Znut (\"prostitution\"), as some (Rambam and more) consider such relations as Znut, and some not.</p></li>\n<li><p>\"Boel Aramit\" (relations with gentiles), which is a different topic.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Egypt had a system in effect wherein they worshiped many animals, cattle among them. Soon after the exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel even worshiped a golden calf, fashioned by Aaron in the absence of Moses (Exodus 32:1–4). It’s possible they were so steeped in Egyptian ways that they couldn’t bring themselves to eat animals they worshiped.</p>\n<p>Second, did they see their livestock as their source of income? They were shepherds, and they came from shepherds. No one would want to eat his source of income. Perhaps they were preserving their flocks and herds for when they came into the Promised Land and would once again be shepherds and herdsmen. If they ate up the source of all their income, they would be paupers and beggars in their new country. A third possibility is that they were just whining because they were tired of eating the same old thing all the time. Perhaps they just wanted some variety in their diet.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.gotquestions.org/Israelites-eat-flocks.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></em></p>\n\n\n",

Those include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Numerous <strong>complains of Bnai Israel</strong> on physical conditions, i.g. lack of fresh water, food, meat etc - after they complained, Moses took steps to solve it.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Public transgressions</strong>: the Golden Calf, the spies, Bnot Moab - after Beny Isroel sinned Moses tried different ways to fix it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Parashat Itroh - establishing the first judicial system - Moses didn't plan well and could undermine the whole enterprise, and many more.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Seemingly, many of those episodes could be prevented or totally avoided, if Moses, as a prophet, adopted a more active approach, by foreseeing the possible problems and preparing for them. </p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of how Moses would act if he adopted a proactive style of leadership: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"By expressing his care for his people he asks Hashem every time what awaits Bney Isroel at their next stop - is there enough food and water, what are the enemies and dangers etc. After Hashem tells him the plan, Moses gets back to the nation and proposes a plan of passing it in the most convenient and safe way.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Before sending the spies, Moses holds a meeting to find out the general attitude of the chosen 10 people. Turns out they are not as eager to enter the Promised Land as Moses and Yehoshuah. Despite the effort, the spies refuse to change their outlook. Moses aborts the mission and nobody's hurt.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It also seems that Moses as a prophet was not commanded on a specific form of management, his reactive style seems to be his own choice.  </p>\n\n<p>So why did Moses adopted a reactive position instead of a proactive?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I believe Moshe Rabbeinu maintained a very proactive stance; he told Klal Yisroel exactly how to behave, and the majority complied. The cases in the Torah are isolated and relate to a small section of Klal Yisroel. These cases were dealt with as they came up.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why Counting Months (first, second) is not a Mitzvah from Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>This is not a duplicate, the other question asks about adopting the Babylonian calendar system, please remove the notice.</strong></p>\n<p>The original names for Hebrew months, as they appear in Torah - are just serial numbers, counting from Nissan, being the first month, Iyar the second etc. As in:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ויסעו מרעמסס בחודש הראשון, בחמישה עשר יום <strong>לחודש הראשון</strong>\" (Num 33,3)</p>\n<p>\"בשנת הארבעים, לצאת בני-ישראל מארץ מצריים, <strong>בחודש החמישי</strong>, באחד לחודש\" (ibid 28)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many interpreters mention that this is one of the ways of a remembering the Exodus.</p>\n<p>This is consistent with the ruling of the Gemmorah that <strong>\"ישראל מונים ללבנה\"</strong>, which literally means \"Israel <strong>count</strong> months\". However, the current names we use were brought from the Babylon exile, and those names are proper names, <strong>lacking the serial counting, and, therefore, remembering Nissan and the Exodus</strong>.</p>\n<p>How come such a big Deoraisoh issue was forgotten, and the Sages decided to override the naming of the Torah and the remembrance of the Exodus in counting Hebrew months?</p>\n\n\n",

As long as what you are doing affects the vessel in a 3 dimensional manner, e.g. adding on or engraving, then it is considered a vessel you made. It goes to follow that unscrewing a screw, taking it out, reinserting and tightening it would be enough. – <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1135/electric-appliances-and-mikva#comment939_1136\">Yahu Apr 22 '10 at 17:26</a> \"</p>\n<p>Is this true?

There the חכמת אדם discusses oversized vessels that are hard to טובל and gives the advice to drill a hole into it. For further reference into the exact למדות see שיעורי הלכה פרק י\"ד סעיף ד and in the associated footnotes which cites the שבט הלוי  and the מעדני אשר.</p>\n<p>The consensus is that we need the vessel to be created in the ownership of a Jew so that the halacha of a Jewish vessel that does not need tevilah can apply. Mere engraving will not have this effect. Even more so, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, as brought down in שיעורי הלכה, would instruct that a professional must disassemble the vessel, because otherwise it is not considered broken enough.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why krias yam suf, not bkias\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as i know, the torah shebichsav <strong>never</strong> refers to the splitting of the sea as a 'kriah', i.e. a ripping. The torah says things like ויבקעו המים (Shemos 14:21) which means that the sea split.\nIn torah she'b'al peh, it is always referred to as קריעת ים סוף.</p>\n\n<p>Why did chazal choose to change from.the way the torah refers to that which occurred and why such an odd choice off word? Ripping seems to make little to no sense in this context.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya says that the water opened up like a zipper. The further they walked the more it opened up. That is similar to kriah which is tearing. One must say that two things happened. First there was a small cut or chop in the water to cause a small split which is bekiah and then the water gradually opened up more and more which is kriah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ok. Here's a chidush. The Mechilta has many drashos based upon all the various terminologies used for or applied to this particular miracle in Tanach.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכילתא על שמות יד-פסוק טז</p>\n<p>ואתה הרם את מטך עשרה נסים נעשו לישראל על הים. נבקע הים ונעשה כמין כיפה שנ' נקבת במטיו ראש פרזיו יסערו להפיצני (חבקוק ג) נחלק לשנים עשר גזרים שנ' ונטה את ידך על הים ובקעהו נעשה הים יבשה שנ' ובני ישראל הלכו ביבשה נעשה כמין טיט שנ' דרכת בים סוסיך חומר מים רבים (שם) נעשה פירורין פירורין שנ' אתה פוררת בעזך ים (תהלים עד) נעשה סלעים סלעים שנאמר שברת ראשי תנינים על המים נעשה גזרים גזרים שנ' לגוזר ים סוף לגזרים (שם קלו) נעשה ערימות שנ' וברוח אפיך נערמו מים נעשו כמו נד שנ' נצבו כמו נד נוזלים הוציא להם זיכרי מים מתוקים מתוך מלוחים שנ' ויוצא נוזלים מסלע ויורד כנהרות מים (שם עח) הקפיא להם את הים משני חלקים ונעשה כמין בולוס של זכוכית שנ' קפאו תהומות בלב ים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So for instance nivka was used to expound that there was a dome of water overhead. Gozer was used to expound that there were many paths cut through not just one big one.</p>\n<p>So <em>perhaps</em> we can suggest that chazzal wanted to use a term that was never used in Tanach in order to refer to the miracle in a general sense. If they would refer to it as the miracle of Bekias Yam Suf, one might mistakenly assume they were only referring to the dome miracle. If they referred to it as Gizeiras Yam Suf, one might mistakenly assume they were only referring to many paths aspect of the miracle. So a new name was invented to refer to the entirety of the miracle all together.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong>  The Sefer Midrash Chidush (by R' Eliezer Nachman Puah,) writes that Hashem commanded Moshe to split the sea with the term Bekiah, as explained above, this denotes one division. However, as the various Midrashim bring the sea adamantly refused. Until \"Hayam ra'ah vayanos” - “The sea saw (Hashem coming) and fled.” However, Hashem was not pleased and punished the sea by tearing it to (twelve) pieces, - \"Legozer yam suf Iigzarim”. Therefore, although it is written in the Torah that the sea was split \"Vayibaku”, Chazal are mechadesh to us that what actually took place in the end was keriah.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong>  An answer (partially brought by the Likutei Yehuda) in the name of the Chidushei Harim. He explained that the term Keriah is used to denote two things: <strong>a)</strong> When two separate things have been made into one and then are separated. E.g. when one tears a garment which is (separate threads joined together) in mourning this is called \"keriah\". <strong>b)</strong> The term Keriah implies the possibility of the two now separate things being rejoined afterward. Again, with the example of the garment, in olden times it was customary to sew it back together after the appropriate time, (known as Me'acha).</p>\n\n<p>Bekiah, however, refers to only one thing - Something that was one piece to begin with for example a tree or piece of wood. When divided it is called Bekiah - e.g. Bereishit 22, 3 \"Vayevaka Atzeh Olah”- “And he (Avraham) cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering.”) When creating the sea, Hashem made its existence conditional upon it splitting when the Jews left Egypt. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in reality the sea was made from two parts held together as one until that time, it only had the appearance of being one. Therefore, the correct term is for the split should be keriah, because the sea was joined back together afterward to kill the Egyptians.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem called it bekiah. Bekiah refers to splitting only, because when Hashem instructed Moshe regarding the sea, he did not want to use the word keriah which would hint to the destruction that He had to bring upon His creatures when He would later reunite the sea.</p>\n\n\n",

As the date of authorship becomes farther away from the date in which the events described happened, evidence becomes scarce, and the evidence found at times contradicts the story entirely.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some key examples:</p>\n\n<p><em>The Exodus</em></p>\n\n<p>Whatever traditions the exodus story is based on, archaeological evidence shows that Egypt was in fact the ruler of Canaan during the 14th century BC, and that no mass changes to the population (600,000 men plus their families would have constituted around half the population of Egypt at that time) seem to have happened. Cities and nations mentioned by name in Exodus are known to have only existed many hundreds of years later, Camel's are known not to have brought to Egypt until many hundreds of years later, as well as many other issues. In short, here the archaeological evidence clearly dismisses the biblical story, and indeed, we're talking about some 700 years before the reign of Josiah.</p>\n\n<p><em>David and Solomon's Kingdom</em></p>\n\n<p>There is no real archaeological evidence for the large united kingdom of David and Solomon large kingdom described in the Bible, with a lack of large structures and inhabited sites that would be required in such a kingdom. The earliest evidence we have for David is from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dan_Stele\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Tel Dan Stele\">Tel Dan Stele</a> which only mentioned the \"House of David\", not David himself. In short, at the very least, no real evidence.</p>\n\n<p><em>Kings of Israel</em></p>\n\n<p>The Omrides are mentioned in multiple archaeological findings, with the defeat of Joram son of Ahab mentioned in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesha Stele</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Assyrian siege of Jerusalem</em></p>\n\n<p>The famous Assyrian clay prisms describe Sennacherib's siege on Jerusalem, and agree with most biblical details, other than the miracle described in the bible, where 185,000 of Sennacherib's troops perished overnight.</p>\n\n\n",

The two main categories are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Written Torah (includes all 24 books of Tanakh)</p></li>\n<li><p>Oral Torah </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Oral law (includes the Mishna, Talmud [palestinian and babylonian], Sifra, Sifri, Mechilta and many other scattered Toseftas. They were composed by the Rabbis living in babylonia and the land of Israel roughly between the beginning of the common era til 500 CE)</li>\n<li>Halacha (includes Alfasi, Rambam, Tur, Shulchan Aruch and much more. They were all composed much later in Medieval Europe)</li>\n<li>Midrashic literature (includes Midrash Rabba, Midrash Tanhuma and many more. They were also composed by the Rabbis in Babylonia and Israel. They are not concerned with law but with homiletics and biblical analysis, philosophy and ethics and ancient Jewish lore)</li>\n<li>Kabbalah (includes Zohar, sefer yetzirah, Hekhalot literature and many more mystical texts. Some of these texts were composed by the Rabbis in the Talmudic period and some of them much later in the Middle ages or even later)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Talmud is classified as a book of Jewish law, but it actually contains different elements of Midrash, Jewish lore and maybe even Kabbalah. But it is mainly concerned with Jewish law and classified as such. There are two kinds of Midrash found in the Talmud. One is concerned with biblical texts analysis which deeply affects the law, and one with homiletics and ethics.   </p>\n\n<p>The difference between Oral law and Halacha may seem artificial since they are both concerned with Jewish law, but they are very different from each other. The Halachic literature was composed in a different land, culture and by different people, period and belief system, so they are rightly considered to be a different category in Jewish texts.  </p>\n\n\n",

That is, it appears that even if he drives around in it, if he lives in it permanently he should put up a mezuzah (though possibly without a bracha). It appears that the reason is that its purpose is to provide a dwelling. On the other hand, a car, whose purpose is transportation, does not require a mezuzah. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What about a Mobile Home?</p>\n  \n  <p>The Minchas Yitzchak (2: 82) discusses whether someone who lives\n  permanently in a mobile home is required to put up a mezuzah,\n  concluding that he is required to do so; however the Minchas Yitzchak\n  is uncertain whether he should recite a brocha when he puts it up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Kaganoff mentions this concept when he discusses <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/does-an-elevator-require-a-mezuzah/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">whether an elevator would require a mezuzah</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dayan Weiss questions whether an elevator requires a mezuzah, since it\n  constantly moves and cannot be considered a residence.

Rav Avraham Dovid of Butchatch, usually\n  called “the Butchatcher,” rules that a moving residence requires a\n  mezuzah.

In a different\n  responsum, Dayan Weiss deliberates whether mobile homes require a\n  mezuzah, since people often reside in them, whereas using a bus or\n  automobile as a residence is considered temporary and does not require\n  a mezuzah (Shu’t Minchas Yitzchak 2:82; see also Chovas HaDor pg. 37).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Because Scripture states: “I have separated you from the peoples to be for Me\", whichyour separation from them (from their doings) should be for My sake — that one should keep aloof from sin and take upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven (Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 12 23).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The two examples that Rashi mentions, pig and shatnez, are both laws that Rashi himself 18 4 refers to as being chukim, laws with no apparent reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואת חקתי תשמרו. דְּבָרִים שֶׁהֵן גְּזֵרַת הַמֶּלֶךְ, שֶׁיֵּצֶר הָרַע מֵשִׁיב עֲלֵיהֶם לָמָּה לָנוּ לְשָׁמְרָן? וְאֻמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם מְשִׁיבִין עֲלֵיהֶם, כְּגוֹן אֲכִילַת חֲזִיר וּלְבִישַׁת שַׁעַטְנֵז וְטָהֳרַת מֵי חַטָּאת, לָכַךְ נֶאֱמַר אני ה', גָּזַרְתִּי עֲלֵיכֶם, אִי אַתָּה רַשָּׁאִי לִפָּטֵר (יומא ס\"ז):</p>\n<p>ואת חקתי תשמרו AND KEEP MINE ORDINANCES — matters which are decrees of the King (promulgated without any reason being stated) against which the evil inclination raises objections: \"Why should we observe them and against which also the nations of the world raise objections, as e. g., the prohibition of eating swine’s flesh, of wearing clothes of a mixture of wool and linen, the purgatory \npower of \"water mingled with the ashes of the Red Heifer\" (טהרת מי חטאת) — therefore it is stated: \"I\", the Lord, have enacted this for you — you are not at liberty to evade the obligation (Yoma 67b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As of now, it seems like we could assume Rashi would tell us to only say \"I would, indeed, like them, but what can I do since my Father in heaven has imposed these decrees upon me” concerning a chok but not a command which falls under the umbrella of mishpat. So we should not say \"I would love to steal or kill but what can I do, since my Father in heaven has imposed these decrees upon me\".</p>\n<p><strong>Is this true?</strong></p>\n<p>To make the case even stronger, it seems Rashi's quote from Toras Kohanim is different than the one Malbim had (which he tacks on the Sifra) seen <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifra,_Kedoshim,_Chapter_12.23?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' אלעזר בן עזריה אומר מנין שלא יאמר אדם \"אי אפשי ללבוש שעטנז. אי אפשי לאכול בשר חזיר. אי אפשי לבוא על הערוה\" אבל \"אפשי ומה אעשה ואבי שבשמים גזר עלי כך\"? תלמוד לומר \"ואבדיל אתכם מן העמים להיות לי\"-- נמצא פורש מן העבירה ומקבל עליו עול מלכות שמים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here added to the two examples of shatnez and pig is adultery.

By the former, one who wishes to do them but holds himself back is deficient.

Because He later explained each\n  statement [of the Ten Commandments] individually. —</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first two commandments were said by Hashem directly to the people; for the rest, Moshe relayed them. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=25&daf=24&format=text\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(Makkos 24a)</a>.

Sinai (presumably)) (Rashi [insert source here, somewhere in Sefer Shemos]), and there's many drushu's about the 10 commandments having 620 letters to alude to the 613 commandments and 7 noahide commandments (see baal haturim) etc. so it seems like there was no other version (except the 2nd time the 10 commandments are mentioned in Devarim with several changes, <em>maybe</em> that says something regarding an untold 3rd version that was only said to Moshe, but if there really was a 3rd version it would probably be pretty well known in the commentaries)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems that my question is answered <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/horayos/insites/ho-dt-008.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>  in\nINSIGHTS INTO THE DAILY DAF, prepared by Kollel Iyun Hadaf of Yerushalayim.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>OPINIONS: Rebbi Yishmael states that the Jewish people at Sinai heard\n  the first two commandments of the Aseres ha'Dibros (\"Anochi Hash-m\"\n  and \"Lo Yiheyeh Lecha\") directly from Hash-m. Does this imply that\n  they did not hear the other eight commandments from Hash-m, but from\n  Moshe Rabeinu?</p>\n  \n  <p>(a) The RAMBAM in MOREH NEVUCHIM (2:33) writes that this indeed is\n  correct. He explains that even though the first two commandments were\n  heard directly from Hash-m, the Jewish people did not understand the\n  words; they could not comprehend where one word ended and the next\n  began. Moshe Rabeinu clarified this for them. The Rambam explains that\n  this is why the Torah repeatedly refers to the \"Kol\" (\"sound\" or\n  \"voice\") that the Jewish people heard (see Devarim 4:12 and 5:19-20).\n  They heard only the sound of the letters of the words, and they could\n  not clearly discern the words until Moshe Rabeinu helped them. They\n  did not hear the last eight commandments directly from Hash-m, <strong>but\n  rather Moshe Rabeinu related them to the Jewish people as he heard\n  them from Hash-m.</strong> (See RABEINU BACHYE to Shemos 20:1.)</p>\n  \n  <p>(b) The RAMBAN (to Shemos 20:7) argues that the Jewish people\n  definitely heard all ten of the Aseres ha'Dibros directly from Hash-m.\n  He explains that the intention of Rebbi Yishmael is that the only\n  commandments that the Jewish people heard and understood on the same\n  level as Moshe Rabeinu were the first two. <strong>The rest of the\n  commandments were also heard by the Jewish people directly from\n  Hash-m, but they did not understand what they heard until Moshe\n  Rabeinu explained it to them.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Ramban explains that this is the meaning of the verse, \"Moshe\n  Yedaber, veha'Elokim Ya'anenu v'Kol\" (Shemos 19:19). The verse is\n  saying that Hash-m will be made to be heard by Moshe's explanation of\n  the last eight commandments that they heard from Hash-m but did not\n  understand.</p>\n  \n  <p>(c) The BE'ER SHEVA quotes the MA'ASEI HASH-M who gives a different\n  explanation. He says that the method of communication of Hash-m at\n  Sinai was similar to that of a powerful and awesome king who gives\n  orders to his servant. If he says all of his orders directly to his\n  servant, then the servant will be very frightened. However, if the\n  king gives the orders to a different party and intentionally lets the\n  servant overhear the orders being given, this would be much less\n  frightening. Similarly, after Hash-m said the first two Dibros\n  directly to the Jewish people and they consequently became very\n  frightened, <strong>Hash-m decided that in order to make the experience\n  bearable for them He would say the rest of the Dibros as if He was\n  speaking only to Moshe. The Jewish people heard but were not as\n  frightened, and they understood all of the Aseres ha'Dibros clearly,\n  with no need for explication.</strong> The difference was merely that the\n  first two Dibros were said directly to them, while the rest of the\n  Dibros were said directly to Moshe and overheard by them. (See also\n  TORAH TEMIMAH to Shemos 20:2.) (Y. MONTROSE)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to all views,then, there was only one version and no differences in the language of the last eight of the Ten Commandments.</p>\n\n\n",

The fact that they had to be exiled two years before 852, rather than one year, is a proof that the value can be off by one, because if they had been in the land for 851 years, they would have still been in danger of being \"utterly destroyed\" because it is within 1 of the value of 852, the value of ונושנתם.

It seems that we get two different stories.</p>\n\n<p>In Shemot 18:13 - 17, Yitro sees that the people are standing waiting for Moshe to resolve cases for them. He says to Moshe, this is a huge task for you and a burden to the people, you can't do this alone. Then, in verses 19-23, he advises Moshe to appoint heads of different divisions. Moshe listens to Yitro's advise (verse 24), and does this.</p>\n\n<p>In Devarim 1:12, Moshe complains that the people's burdens are too large for him, and he advises the people to find smart and renown people. This seems different from Shemot, where it seems that Moshe found these people.</p>\n\n<p>Next, in Devarim 1:14, the people tell Moshe, \"This is a good idea\". In Shemot, it doesn't seem that Moshe asked for the people's approval of the idea. It seems that he realized on his own that Yitro offered the right advice.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, Rash\"i's comment on Devarim 1:14 seems negative. He says that the people should have said, \"No, we'd rather learn directly from you.\" It seems that this was the people's fault that they agreed to having separate heads. I don't see how Rash\"i arrives at faulting the people. In Devarim, it seems clear that Moshe himself decided that he needed help. In Shemot, he was listening to Yitro's advice.</p>\n\n<p>How do we reconcile these seemingly conflicting stories? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Mefarshim <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Devarim/1.9#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as usual:</p>\n\n<p>Ibn Caspi to Devarim 1:9 says that the story in Devarim story took place after Yisro had suggested this idea to Moshe.  This seems to also be the understanding of R\"i Bechor Shor there, and perhaps other Mefarshim as well. Hoil Moshe there explains this clearly and in depth. See also Netziv 1:10, and Devarim Rabbah 1:10)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya/Bechaye suggests that Moshe told the nation this \"through Yisro\", but I don't understand how the details of the story fit according to his retelling.</p>\n\n<p>RDZ Hoffman suggests that Moshe told this to the nation without mentioning who had given him the suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>See Or Hachaim to 1:13, who says that Moshe had a role in appointing the judges even here, based on the words \"Vaasimeim Berasheichem\".  See Keli Yakar there, who says that the choosing of the people is about the Nesiim, not judges.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to Rashi, Baruch Shekivanti to Netziv there who says that the Midrash is picking up on the words there \"Vataanu Osi) which seem to be saying that they pained Moshe, and that was the reason for this Derasha, not that it was intended as a context based Peshat:</p>\n\n<p>There is much more on this, but I hope I have provided some ways to look at the two stories hand-in-hand.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Negiah before Nisuin\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Unless I'm mistaken, after a non-ervah goes to the mikvah, affectionate touch would at most be prohibited rabbinically. I assume here it is prohibited rabbinically. If so, there are two cases I am wondering about:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Arusa, after kiddushin before nisuin does this prohibition apply?

Is the potential yavam forbidden from affectionate touch with his shomeres yavam before yibum? If so, I would imagine it would make yibum slightly more difficult/awkward, unless for some reason it is permitted while one is in the process of performing yibum</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Even if there's no prohibition touching a <em>penuya tehorah</em><sup>1</sup> (single girl), these two cases have some sources which could indicate an issur.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arusa</strong></p>\n\n<p>That very passage in <em>masseches kalla</em> states without <em>sheva brachos</em> a <em>kallah</em> is אסורה כנדה and this is quoted by Shu\"t HaGeonim Shaarei Tzedek (4:4:24), Rashi Kesubos (7b) and many other sources.</p>\n\n<p>It is forbidden to touch one's wife who is a <em>nidda</em>, as Rambam writes in Issurei Biah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Forbidden_Intercourse.11.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">11:19</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, the Chida writes in his commentary to <em>masseches kalla</em> there that it is forbidden to touch a <em>kalla</em> like a <em>nidda</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כלה בלא ברכה אסורה כלומר אפי' לחבק <strong>או ליגע בה</strong> כנדה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So according to him there is prohibition to touch your <em>arusah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, it should be noted that the simple reading of <em>masseches kalla</em> isnt that she is actually like a <em>nidda</em>, but just that although she is your wife, relations with her are prohibited.That is the natural reading of the continuation: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה נדה שלא טבלה אסורה לבעלה, אף כלה בלא ברכה אסורה לבעלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no evidence that the particulars of <em>hilchos nidda</em> apply to her. Indeed, R. Aurbach of T'veria is quoted in the article: הוראות והערות הרב שלמה זלמן אוירבך בדיני חופה ונשואין printed in מבקשי תורה כז, תשס\"ב, יב - טו that it obviously doesn't mean that they have the same laws<sup>2</sup>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הדבר פשוט ואין צריך לפנים שאין בכלה בלא ברכה דיני הרחקות אף שכ' ואסורה לבעלה כנדה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, a noteworthy comment of the Rambam sheds light on what he thinks is the significance of the comparison to <em>nidda</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תשובת  הרמב\"ם סימן רפח </p>\n  \n  <p>וכלה בלא ברכה אסורה לבעלה מדרבנן וזה שאמרו כנדה לחזק הדבר בלבד </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see he felt <em>Chazal</em> used this expression to show how serious their prohibition should be viewed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shomeres yavam</strong></p>\n\n<p>Regarding a <em>shomeres yavam</em>, one important source potentially indicating a problem touching her, is the Yerushalmi Yevamos (1:1) regarding the practice of R. Yossi ben Chalafta who performed the act of <em>yibbum</em> through a sheet. While there is much discussion about this passage, some, such as Korban Ha'Edah there, connect this to the view of Abba Shaul (Yevamos 39b) that intent for <em>yibbbum</em> must be pure since otherwise the children are like <em>mamzerim</em>. Rambam explains (Bechoros 1:7) that in his view, the <em>shomeres yavam</em> retains characteristics of erva, and is therefore only permitted through <em>yibbum</em> alone. Similarly, Maharshal implies in Yam Shel Sh'lomo to Yevamos (4:2) that R. Yossi's behavior was related to the <em>erva</em> status of a sister in law that <em>yevama</em> carries.</p>\n\n<p>This would be a source to prohibit non-<em>yibbum</em> contact that would be forbidden with other <em>arayos</em> (classically hugging or kissing and other such contact).</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that there are many reasons why <em>halacha</em> would nevertheless not follow this.</p>\n\n<p>Credits to an anonymous scholar who provided me with the sources.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Interestingly, regarding touching brides, the Sefer Maharil ‏(מנהגים) הלכות נישואין writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והחתן תופש אותה בידו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The groom holds her hand. He was speaking on the day of the wedding, before the <em>kiddushin</em></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> However, the following in the <em>Sefer</em> <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books/about/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%99_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%94.html?id=mma2ZwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shalmei Simcha</a> pg. 186 implies Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach himself held she does have <em>harchokos</em> like a <em>niddah</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש נוהגין שהחתן לא ימסור לכלה את כוס הברכה מידו לידה, כיון דהוי אחר האירוסין, וכלה בלא ברכה אסורה לבעלה כנדה. ורבינו אמר שזה אינו ובודאי מן הראוי שהחתן יתן לכלה. ואין בזה כל חשש, שהרי הכוס של אירוסין הוא לפני אירוסין, ועדיין איננו \"כלה\" בלא ברכה, והכוס של נישואין אף דהוי אחר קידושין לפני הנישואין דהיינו לפני ייחוד, אין בזה כל חשש, ששתי חומרות הן, א. שיטת הר\"מ שמצריך גם ייחוד. ב. חומרא דהושטה מיד ליד כשיטת רש\"י.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps this is just <em>derech pilpul</em> but not to imply she's really like a <em>niddah</em>. I subsequently saw the source of Rav Auerbach of Tiveria inside and realized he was directly commenting on this source. He says like I thought on this statement of his father:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודברי אאמו\"ר זצ\"ל נאמרו בדרך מו\"מ של הלכה בלבד דממנ\"פ אין לאסור, אבל לא נתכוין לדייק מדבריו שיהיה החתן אסור לאחוז ביד הכלה בלכתם לחדר יחוד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

When you hear the long shofar sound, you may again climb the mountain.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi points out that this was a divine Shofar blowing\n - <code>ושופר של אילו של יצחק היה</code> - in which case we understand how a few million people could hear it.</p>\n\n<p>However, in various places in תנ\"ך we see the Shofar being used for announcements; often to signal the end of a conflict. <em>The shofar was sounded and the conflict ended</em>. Somehow everybody heard it and put their weapons down.</p>\n\n<p>E.g.: Shmuel-2 Ch. 2 18 verse 16:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּתְקַע יוֹאָב בַּשֹּׁפָר וַיָּשָׁב הָעָם מִרְדֹף אַחֲרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל כִּי חָשַׂךְ יוֹאָב אֶת הָעָם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yoav blew the shofar and the nation stopped chasing the Israelites, for Yoav spared the nation.</p>\n\n<p>How did this work? <strong>How far can the sound of a Shofar trave</strong>l - even if they had an entire group of Shofar blowers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did people know this was a genuine peace-blast</strong> and not some peace activist trying to end the war?</p>\n\n<p>The most astounding case is in Shmuel-2 Ch. 15 verse 10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּשְׁלַח אַבְשָׁלוֹם מְרַגְּלִים בְּכָל שִׁבְטֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל לֵאמֹר כְּשָׁמְעֲכֶם אֶת קוֹל הַשֹּׁפָר וַאֲמַרְתֶּם מָלַךְ אַבְשָׁלוֹם בְּחֶבְרוֹן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Avshalom sent spies to all the tribes with instructions that when they hear the Shofar blast they should announce that Avshalom was crowned in Hebron.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How would the blast travel, reliably,  all over the country?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can ultrasound be used to resolve a niddah question?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2018/01/keep-science-away-from-torah.html?spref=fb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this post</a> Rabbi Slifkin makes the following statement</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Somebody once asked the great and underappreciated Rav Nachum Rabinovich, shlita, about <strong>whether one can use ultrasound to resolve a niddah question. He said that the answer is yes</strong>, but chas v'shalom to say that people should do such a thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is not clear to me exactly which type of niddah question would be resolvable but later on in the post he explains that ultrasound could be a better indicator of niddah than reviewing a stain. </p>\n\n<p>I am not an expert in ultrasound technology or in hilchot niddah, but I would like to understand exactly how one could use ultrasound to resolve a niddah question. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>(In general, perhaps you could just ask Rabbi Slifkin what he meant, as opposed to posing the question here.)</p>\n<p>Just after you wrote this question (I think), Anonymous commented the following on the blogpost:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think you mean ultraviolet light, not ultrasound. Ultrasound is what is used to look inside the womb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Judging by the context (evaluation of stains), I would imagine this to be correct, as I think that UV can identify what is blood or what might be something else.  We can only know whether or not this is the correct answer when Rabbi Slifkin responds at some point, which I will try to check later and update.</p>\n<p>However, I believe that ultrasound <strong>could probably be used to some extent</strong> to determine Niddah status in some cases.  For example, for unidentified bleeding, if an ultrasound showed certain information about the uterine/endometrial lining, it could be perhaps used in a Pesak (to determine that it has not come from a particular location).  Also, there are some Hilchos Niddah that are affected by being pregnant for a certain amount of time, which, if an ultrasound could confirm that earlier, perhaps would affect those Halachos, but these have already been discussed by Poskim.</p>\n<p>(A good website that discusses what a pelvic/gynecologic ultrasound shows is <a href=\"http://www.advancedwomensimaging.com.au/pelvic-gynaecologic-ultrasound\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, if this is of use to anyone in answering the question.)</p>\n<p>Edit: Just Curious has responded to Anonymous as follows (there have been no comments from Rabbi Slifkin):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm pretty sure R' Slifkin means ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the lining of the uterus and thereby ascertain whether the source of vaginal bleeding is uterine or otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

One was Eliezer, the other was the famous rasha Og.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.39?lang=bi&with=Da%27at%20Zekenim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Zekeinim to Genesis 24:39</a> (one has to wait to let it upload, so here's entire comment):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלי לא תלך האשה אחרי, “perhaps the woman (that I chose) will not follow me. (to this land).” Rashi comments on this that it is remarkable that the word: ulay here is spelled without the letter ו after the first letter as we would have expected, and that this is a hint by Eliezer who had a daughter, that he secretly hoped that the refusal of a potential bride from Avraham’s family to move to the land of Canaan, might make his master Avraham willing to let her become Yitzchok’s wife. [Rashi bases himself on an interpretation by B’reshit Rabbah on why in the report of the conversation between Avraham and Eliezer on the same subject in 24,5 that letter ו is not missing. Ed.] It is difficult to understand why he did not write this comment already on verse eight in this chapter where Avraham had not excluded a marital union with the daughters of any of his three friends Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre, although they were Canaanites, and not slaves from Damascus, and Avraham had Eliezer released him from his oath in the event that a girl from Charan were to refuse to move to the land of Canaan. We must assume that Avraham had felt that the curse that rested on Canaan had already run its course, whereas the curse on Eliezer’s antecedents had not yet run its course, so that marriage into that family would be spiritually much more dangerous. B’reshit Rabbah 59,9, states specifically that Eliezer was a descendant of Cham, whose son Canaan Noach had cursed. In the book: Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 15, Eliezer is identified with Og King of Bashan, whom the Israelites slew in a battle during their last year in the desert. [My edition of Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer does not have this, and my research of a lengthy article about Og by Dr Admiel Kosman of the Bar Ilan university, also does not bring any source for that statement. Ed.] According to our author, the following is the text in his edition of Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer. “Eliezer has been described as the most senior servant, and added that he was a servant for evermore. When he did Yitzchok a great favour by choosing a wonderful wife for him, Yitzchok freed him forever. G–d then rewarded Og by making him King of Bashan. If this is true, why did G–d order Moses to kill Og as a punishment for defending his country against invaders? According to Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer he was a perfectly righteous man! We also know from the Talmud, tractate Sofrim chapter 21, as well as from Derech Eretz zuttah, tractate Sotah, 1, that he was one of only nine people who immediately upon drawing their last breath had their souls transferred to the spiritual hereafter. This matter was discussed in connection with a tradition that when Yitzchok first joined Rivkah in the marital bed, and found that she was not a virgin, he suspected Eliezer as having been to blame for this. He said to him: “may you live as long and enter paradise as you are innocent of my accusation!” <strong>In light of all the above, we must assume that there had been two Kings called King of Bashan, one during Avraham’s lifetime and another during Moses’ lifetime. It was the former who was so righteous. Each one of these two persons, once crowned king, used the title King of Bashan, seeing that all of Bashan’s king were called Og, just as all of Egypt’s kings were called Pharaoh.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't know the rabbinic \"consensus\", but I can add a useful source to the discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Chida in Shem Hagedolim (Maareches Hagedolim, Mar Rav Avraham Gaon) notes that Mabit (1:276) states that people who name after Eliezer must be naming after Eliezer the son of Moshe Rabbeinu, because Eliezer was cursed (with the assumption by Chida based on this being that he was a Rasha).  However, Chida himself concludes that he was a Tzaddik and Chacham (even asking on the Mabit based on this conclusion).  He bases his opinion on Yoma 21b (in comments) and the source quoted above that he entered Gan Eden alive.</p>\n\n\n",

Moshe fled Mitzrayim at the age of 18 (like is discussed in Midrash HaGadol to Shemot 2:14) and traveled to the Kingdom of Cush which was ruled over at that time by King Kikanus. Queen Adoniyah was the wife of King Kikanus of Cush. When Kikanus died, in the tenth year of Moshe's flight from Mitzrayim, the people elected Moshe to be their King in place of Kikanus.</p>\n\n<p>Because Moshe was appointed King of Cush, he was given the Queen of the late King as his wife. But Moshe never consummated that marriage sexually because of the tradition going back to Shem, Cham and Yafet, the children of Noach. Moshe was a descendent of Shem while Queen Adoniyah was of descendent of Cham.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is recorded in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40009&st=&pgnum=246\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer HaYashar on parshat Shemot</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ben Tzion Luria in his essay in Hebrew \"Ancient Chapters\" in Sefer Yosef Breslevski, pg. 206, footnote 41, suggests that there was a Midianite tribe named the \"Cushim\" or the \"Cushanim\" (yes, perhaps as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.3.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cushan Rish'ataim</a><sup>1</sup>). This word as the name of a tribe appears already in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari,_Syria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mari</a> texts of the 19th century - it's possible they inter-married with the Midianites<sup>2</sup>. This tribe is mentioned in Tanach in relation to the Midianites:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As a scene of havoc I behold The tents of Cushan; Shaken are the pavilions Of the land of Midian!\"(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Habakkuk.3.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chavakuk 3:7</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, it's possible that Tzipporah was both a Cushite and a Midianite at the same time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As for how could Cushan, king of Aram Nahara'im, be related to Midianites, Luria suggests a complicated theory that \"Aram Nahara'im\" doesn't refer to the Aramaic city/province but to a different place, more in the area of Edom (and neighboring Midian). I can also suggest that at least some of the Midians were nomads (we see this from the location of the Midians in the story of Baal Pe'or and the subsequent war, and during their invasions in the time of Gidon), so Cushan's tribe might have journeyed to Aram (the edge of Aram, at least, isn't too far from the northern Israeli border).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Perhaps also worth mentioning that Nimrod, king of Akkad, was a son of Cush - perhaps the ancient Cushanim were related to the Babylonian descendants of Cush.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand, the Gemara also says that Rabban Gamliel, upon seeing all the Torah on that day, had his doubts if he was correct all those years, and Hashem eased his doubts with a dream (though Rabban Gamliel was indeed incorrect for keeping people out of the Beis Midrash). Perhaps he was acting based on that?</p>\n\n<p><strong>What do the poskim have to say about this?</strong> If such a situation were to occur today, where the Rav of a community (or worse, a Gadol HaDor) were to publicly humiliate someone as Rabban Gamliel did - perhaps for noble intentions, but still forbidden - <strong>is the community allowed to fire the Rav and get a new one in his stead</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Normally I would tack a CYLOR disclaimer on here, but given the topic, I’m going to say see your non-local-but-still-personal Orthodox Rabbi instead. \n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Seems to be a bit complicated.

Rabbi Wertheimer... also explains that mateh and makel are only made from wood, while shevet can be made from wood or metal (see Psalms 2:9 which refers to an iron shevet)...</p>\n  \n  <p>Citing an explanation from Rabbi Shmuel Dovid Luzzatto (1800-1865),\n  Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Mecklenburg (1785-1865) writes that the words shevet\n  and mateh actually have different meanings, but because they are\n  conceptually related they became interchangeable. He explains that the\n  word shevet originally referred to the leader of a tribe, while mateh\n  originally referred to the other members of a tribe. The leader of a\n  tribe is similar to a mast upon which a flag is mounted because all of\n  the members of the tribe rally around the leader. In this way the word\n  for a leader of a tribe is homonymous with the word for stick. Since\n  all the members of a tribe are united behind their leader, references\n  to them can be subsumed under the word used for the leader. Thus, the\n  word shevet also came to mean members of a tribe because the leader of\n  the tribe embodies the entire tribe itself. In terms of sticks, he\n  argues that shevet and mateh can both refer to the exact same type of\n  stick, but they refer to different parts of the stick. The word shevet\n  refers to the top of the stick (just as the leader sits atop the\n  hierarchal structure of a tribe), while the word mateh — seemingly\n  related to the Hebrew word lematah (underneath) — refers to its bottom\n  (just as the other members of the tribe live under the leadership of\n  their clan chief).</p>\n  \n  <p>Malbim (to Gen. 49:28) writes that the word shevet does not literally\n  mean “stick”, rather it means “branch,” which was the most common item\n  used as a stick. Based on this, he explains that shevet means branch\n  and tribe because each of the Tribes of Israel is simply a branch of\n  the greater family tree of Jacob’s descendants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/whats-in-a-word\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's in a Word?</a>, \"Tribesmen Stick Together\"</p>\n\n\n",

Where Amalek tries to destroy, Moshe builds. An altar is an inherently peaceful structure, devoted to God's service, and divorced from even a hint of weapons of war, as we see in <a href=\"https://Sefaria.org/Exodus.20.22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 20:22</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאִם־מִזְבַּ֤ח אֲבָנִים֙ תַּֽעֲשֶׂה־לִּ֔י לֹֽא־תִבְנֶ֥ה אֶתְהֶ֖ן גָּזִ֑ית כִּ֧י חַרְבְּךָ֛ הֵנַ֥פְתָּ עָלֶ֖יהָ וַתְּחַֽלְלֶֽהָ׃</p>\n<p>And if you make for Me an altar of stones, do not build it of hewn stones; for by wielding your tool upon them you have profaned them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>נס doesn't mean \"miracle\" so much as \"banner.\" It's the sign that tells the fighters where to go.

According to R'Hirsch, these contractions represent the dimunition of the rule of God over the world represented by Amalek. Amalek asserts that humans should reject Godly morality in favor of the pursuit of might and power. So, as long as some humans follow this Amalekite philosophy, they are rejecting God's rule, and the power of His throne (יד על כס) is incomplete. As long as that's true, the struggle against Amalek will continue, kept up by those who March under \"God's standard.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You could simply explain it the way Onkelus does:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבְנָא משֶׁה מַדְבְּחָא וּפְלַח עֲלוֹהִי קֳדָם יְיָ דַעֲבַד לֵהּ נִסִין</p>\n<p>And Moshe built an altar <strong>and prayed on it to Hashem who had made a miracle for him</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The next verse is either the details of his prayer or an added oath that there shall be an eternal enmity towards Amaleq.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think \"nissi\" (\"nes\") has to be understood in connection with  \"nissah\"/\"massah\"  - (to) test  in the beforegoing episode.</p>\n<p>v.2 Why do you test the Lord?</p>\n<p>v.7 He named the place Massah (...) because of their testing the Lord</p>\n<p>v.8 Amalek came</p>\n<p>Any proof (trying to prove) of the existence of God provokes the proof of the contrary.</p>\n<p>God doesn't need to be proved</p>\n<p>He is \"my miracle\"</p>\n\n\n",

Although the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> is\nlenient in certain cases, one must consult a Rav before applying this\nleniency to a <em>melachah</em> that is done with a <em>shinui</em>.</p>\n<p>As a guideline, the following thought process is considered credible,\nand may be applied: R Yosef Shalom Elyashiv (Orchos Shabbos 23, fn 179) and R Shlomo Zalman\nAuerbach (Shmirat Shabbat Kehilchata 30, fn 49) distinguished between a <em>shinui</em> that produces an inferior\nresult to what would result with a normal <em>melachah</em>, and a <em>shinui</em>\nthat ultimately causes the same result. In both cases it is a Rabbinic\nprohibition, but where the result is inferior, it is less of a\n<em>melachah</em>, and using this leniency is permitted. However, where the result is identical, this leniency may not be used.</p>\n<p>As an example</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if one taps a light switch with his elbow, it is abnormal, and qualifies as a <em>shinui</em>. However, the light would not have been\ndifferent if one had switched it on normally. The quality of the act\nis the same, and so, one may not ask a non-Jew to switch a light\nabnormally for a great personal need</li>\n<li>on the other, if one writes with his weaker hand, the quality of the writing will certainly be inferior to that of his natural\nhandwriting. Therefore, one may ask a non-Jew to write with his left\nhand in a case of great need</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that in cases in which the non-Jew was told to do the act with a\n<em>shinui</em> and he decided to do it normally, one may still benefit from that <em>melachah</em>, unless the expectation of the non-Jew doing it in\nsuch an unusual way was unreasonable. In other words, this leniency\n(telling a non-Jew to do a <em>melachah</em> with a <em>shinui</em> in cases where\nthe result will be inferior) does not apply if the non-Jew will almost\ncertainly stil do it in the normal way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Hence, the Ben Ish Chai and Rav Ovadia convinced many communities to change for the better. Those who maintain the Minhag are not in bad standing, though.

Instead of offering to involve Aharon and his sons (5 men), or the Heads of the tribes (12 men) or the Elders (70 men), he offers to jump straight to a total of 77,000 judges. <strong>Is this way of thinking reasonable</strong>?</p></li>\n<li><p>The system offered by Yitroh totally contradicts the Oral Law we have ruled in Sanhedrin, i.g. courts of 3, 23 and 71. <strong>All appointed judges were single judges (דיין יחיד). How come</strong>?</p></li>\n<li><p>Moses prophesied the 77,000 judges. But <strong>did he also prophesied the division of the Israeli nation into tens and fifties and hundreds and thousands</strong>? If no, what's in the name of the judges, if yes, what was the division based on? (A bonus question - the tribes did not count full thousands and even hundreds - did some judges worked with more that one tribe?)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Slightly off-topic and more general question</em>: <strong>When does Moses decide to act on his own and when he decides to consult Hashem</strong>? Why did he not consult Hashem as he did on other occasions (like Bnot Zlofechad)? What was Hashem's reaction in this case - did He agree?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am open to adding your questions also. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n",

And the Lord said\n  unto Satan, whence comest thou? And Satan answered etc. He addressed\n  the Holy One, blessed be He thus: Sovereign of the Universe, I have\n  traversed the whole world and found none so faithful as thy servant\n  Abraham. For Thou didst say to him, Arise, walk through the land to\n  the length and the breadth of it, for to thee I will give it, and even\n  so, when he was unable to find any place in which to bury Sarah until\n  he bought one for four hundred shekels of silver, he did not complain\n  against thy ways. Then the Lord said to Satan, Hast thou considered my\n  servant Job? for’ there is none like him in the earth etc. </p>\n  \n  <p>Said R. Johanan: Greater praise is accorded to Job than to Abraham.\n  For of Abraham it is written, For now I know that thou fearest God,\n  whereas of Job it is written, That man was perfect and upright and one\n  that feared God and eschewed evil. What is the meaning of ‘eschewed\n  evil’? — R. Abba b. Samuel said: Job was liberal with his money.\n  Ordinarily, if a man owes half a prutah [to a workman], he spends it\n  in a shop, but Job used to make a present of it [to the workman].</p>\n  \n  <p>And then Satan answered the Lord and said, Doth Job fear God for\n  nought? Hast thou not made at hedge about him and about his house etc.\n  What is the meaning of the words, Thou hast blessed the work of his\n  hands? — R. Samuel b. R. Isaac said: Whoever took a prutah from Job\n  had luck with it. What is implied by the words, His cattle is\n  increased in the land, — R. Jose b. Hanina said: The cattle of Job\n  broke through the general rule. Normally wolves kill goats, but in the\n  cattle of Job the goats killed the wolves. But put forth thine hand\n  now and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy\n  face... And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold all that he hath is in\n  thy power, only upon himself put not forth thine hand etc. . . . And\n  it fell on a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking\n  wine in their eldest brother's house that there came a messenger unto\n  Job and said, The oxen were plowing etc. What is meant by the words,\n  The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them? — R. Johanan\n  said: This indicates that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Job a\n  taste of the future world. While he was yet speaking there came also\n  another and said, The fire of God. . . While he was yet speaking there\n  came also another and said, The Chaldeans made three bands . . . and\n  fell upon the camels and have taken them away . . . While he was yet\n  speaking there came also another and said, Thy sons and thy daughters\n  were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, and\n  behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four\n  corners of the house and it fell upon the young men . . . Then Job\n  arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head. . . and he said, Naked\n  came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return thither; the\n  Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the\n  Lord. In all this Job sinned not nor charged God with foolishness.\n  Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves\n  . . . and the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan\n  answered the Lord and said, From going to and fro in the earth etc. He\n  said: Sovereign of the Universe, I have traversed the whole earth, and\n  have not found one like thy servant Abraham. For thou didst say to\n  him, Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth\n  of it, for to thee I will give it, and when he wanted to bury Sarah he\n  could not find a place in which to bury her, and yet he did not\n  complain against thy ways. Then the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou\n  considered my servant Job, for there is none like him in the earth . .\n  . and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me\n  against him to destroy him without cause. Said R. Johanan: Were it not\n  expressly stated in the Scripture, we would not dare to say it. [God\n  is made to appear] like a man who allows himself to be persuaded\n  against his better judgment. A Tanna taught: [Satan] comes down to\n  earth and seduces, then ascends to heaven and awakens wrath;\n  permission is granted to him and he takes away the soul.   And Satan\n  answered the Lord and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath\n  will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now and touch his\n  bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face. And the\n  Lord said unto Satan, Behold he is in thine hand: only spare his life.\n  So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and smote Job etc.\n  R. Isaac said: Satan's torment was worse than that of Job; he was like\n  a servant who is told by his master, ‘Break the cask but do not let\n  any of the wine spill.’ Resh Lakish said: Satan, the evil prompter,\n  and the Angel of Death are all one. He is called Satan, as it is\n  written, And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.

Why is a slave sold for six years?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because the Torah decided so.

As mentioned <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/blessings/1-What-is-a-Bracha.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, \"partaking in His creation without consent would be tantamount to stealing. When we acknowledge that our food comes from God – i.e. we say a bracha – God grants us permission to partake in the world's pleasures.\"</p>\n<p>But we benefit from the world in so many more ways than just eating, all the time. If I take cotton and weave a shirt, if I take corn and use it for ethanol, if I take a frond, or by extension, an umbrella and cover myself in a rainstorm, or sit at a table or play a video game. In each case, I am benefiting from the world but I don't know of a particular blessing I should be making. It seems, though, that every moment, during which I am breathing air, I should be making a blessing asking for permission.</p>\n<p>Why does the gemara extend Birchat Hanehenin to eating and not to the myriad other things I do for which I might think I would similarly have to ask that permission?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This is a very good question. I asked it many times and did not get a clear answer so I needed to come up with my personal understanding of <strong>what a Brocho does</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Praising Hashem is free and unlimited, one can recite as many personal praises as she can. Reciting a formulated Brocho is different - it acts something beyond a simple praise, otherwise it could be said on every bite or after consuming it. The fact that there are strict Halochos of when, how and what not, points to some \"practical applications\" of a Brocho that work in a certain way only.</p>\n\n<p>Kabbalist books shed some light on how it works, which I will not elaborate much, only say that it is because the food contains some parts that need a sort of \"spiritual digestion\" that the Brocho acts. Food that does not contain such parts (such as the Manna) does not obligate a Brocho (to some Poskim).</p>\n\n<p>So back to your question: the <strong>Brochos are intended for occasions where our Sages saw a need for an action performed by a formulated Brocho</strong>, a free-wording praising can be said in any situation when one experiences pleasure (such as sex). </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why say V'Hu Rachum at Ma'ariv only when saying Barchu?",
    "content": "# Why say V'Hu Rachum at Ma'ariv only when saying Barchu?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Siddurim usually print Psalms 78:38 and 20:10 (<em>V'Hu Rachum</em>) before Barchu at the beginning of the evening service.  It is my understanding that it is desirable to begin a service with a psalm as introductory material as opposed to jumping right into tefilla.  This is often given as the reason for P'sukei D'Zimra in the morning and Ashrei before the afternoon prayer.  I think the ultimate source of this concept goes back to </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.32a.32?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot.32a</a> Rabbi Simlai taught: One should always set forth praise\n  of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and then pray for his own needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.32b.20?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot.32b</a> \n  The early generations of pious men would wait one hour in order to\n  achieve the solemn frame of mind appropriate for\n  prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With these things in mind, it seems different in the evening.  I see people say the introductory psalm verses only when there is a minyan and they are saying Barchu.  Otherwise, they start with the first bracha of Ma'ariv. This makes it seem like the psalms are bracketed with Barchu, not attached to the evening prayer like at the other two services.</p>\n\n<p>Is the custom I have observed correct, and why are these introductory psalm verses treated differently?  When praying at home, I have been adding these verses before beginning Ma'ariv.  I cannot see a problem with this since it is almost never a mistake to say a psalm, but I wonder why this is not standard practice. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Vehu Rachum is recited as some sort of Kaparas Haavonos/forgiveness).  See Tur and B\"Y OC 237 which bring earlier sources and reasons for this, based on the above (forgiveness).  I did not see anyone who tied this in to Barchu. The reason for the error you observe may be due to the Poskim who say that it should be said before Barchu, and people misread it as having to do with Barchu.  </p>\n\n<p>The only related point is in Piskei Teshuvos OC 236:2, where if one did not say it before Barchu, and then answered to Barchu, it would be considered a Hefsek to say it then, so they should say it only after Shemoneh Esrei/Maariv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Vehu rachum isn't linked to barechu.</p>\n<p>First in the comments to the Shulchan Aruch Peach Chayim 236, 1, Mishna Berura paragraph 1, the custom to recite vehu rachum is mentioned in name of the Tur in 237</p>\n<p>שולחן ערוך אורח חיים סימן אל\"ו משנה ברורה סעיף קטן א</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בערב - והמנהג לומר והוא רחום קודם תפלת ערבית [טור בסי' רל\"ז ע\"ש הטעם].‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tur explains a couple of reasons for this custom. Vehu rachum refers to the mercy of g-d. In morning and afternoon the Tamid gives us mercy and there is no korban Tamid at evening. In evening a man is punished for the sins he made through the day. When someone was whipped by the Court, they say three times vehu rachum. This verse contains 13 words and if we multiply it by 3 the result is 39, the number of lashes that gives the Court.</p>\n<p>טור אורח חיים סימן רל\"ז</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סדר תפלת ערבית - אומר \"והוא רחום\".‏</p>\n<p>ותקנו לאומרו, לפי שבשחרית ומנחה יש תמידין שמכפרין, אבל ערבית שאין תמיד לכפר תקנו לומר והוא רחום. ויש אומרים לפי שנהגו ללקות ערבית לאחר שחטאו כל היום ובמלקות מתכפר להם, לכך נהגו לומר אחר המלקות והוא רחום, וגם מפני שאומרים אותו ג\"פ בשעת המלקות כי יש בו י\"ג תיבות הרי לג' פעמים ט\"ל תיבות כמנין המלקות.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Beth Yosef quotes the Kolbo, to explain why we don't recite it at leil Shabbath an Yom Tov</p>\n<p>בית יוסף</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וז\"ל הכלבו למה אומרים והוא רחום בתפלת ערבית משום דאמרינן (בתנחומא) לעולם לא לן אדם בירושלים ובידו עון שתמיד הבקר מכפר עונות הלילה ותמיד הערב מכפר עונות היום ולכך תיקנו ערבית ושחרית לחלות פני המקום שיכפר עונותינו יומם ולילה שחרית אנו אומרים אותו בסדר קדושה ותקנוה נמי בפסוקי דזמרה בשביל ליל שבת שאין אנו אומרים אותו לפי שאין איברי תמיד הערב קריבין בליל שבת דכתיב עולת שבת בשבתו ולא עולת חול בשבת וכן בי\"ט ולכך תיקנו לומר והוא רחום בתפלת ערבית משא\"כ בשחרית ומנחה לפי שבאותן תפלות היו מקריבין תמידין והיו מכפרין ובתפלת ערבית אין מי יכפר ותיקנו בה לומר והוא רחום ועוד שכל היום אדם חוטא ובערב צריך אדם לומר כפרה על חטאו עכ\"ל:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It happens, but mostly the various explanations live side by side.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to explaining Halacha-related texts, there's only one correct way, in theory. When we do have multiple opinions they are either Minhag-based (which I suspect is the majority of them, with different locations developing variant customs) or they disagree on how to explain/decipher/implement a passage in the Gemara. Whichever way they explain it will be consistent across the board, which is why the layman cannot pick & choose which Poskim to follow in different areas. Since we're (blissfully) unaware of the roots of each halacha and how they are intertwined, we may be doing contradictory things by following multiple opinions in different areas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The difference</strong></p>\n\n<p>Point being that while you may create an entirely new <em>school of thought</em> regarding the narrative, (and the Malbim does that, for example), if you have a novel way of explaining a Halacha-based text, e.g. a Gemara, then the chances are you're misunderstanding something.</p>\n\n<p>In the narrative case, write it down for posterity.<br/>\nIn the Halacha case, write it down and ask around to find out where you went wrong.

What is going forth? The Rebbe explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הליכה אמיתית - a true \"going/movement/progress\" is היא כאשר החידוש של התלמיד הוא מכוחותיו הנעלמים - when the new Torah ideas that a pupil sees in the Torah, כוחות שעד רגע זה לא ידעו שהם קיימים בו! - comes from his hidden powers, that he did not be aware of that they excisted at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rebbe says that even if a Jew has already learned much Torah in his life, it is an obligation to \"lech lecha\", go forth, e.g. learn more and more. To add to it, even if it is in the form of chiddushim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפי' אם יהודי למד כבר הרבה תורה, תמיד שייך להוסיף בזה, עד באופן של חידוש – שכן התורה הינה בלי גבול, \"ארוכה מארץ מידה ורחבה מני ים\"[106]. ויתר על כן: בהיותה חכמתו של הקב\"ה, הרי כל ענין בתורה בעצמו נותן את הכח \"להוליד\" עוד ענינים חדשים, עד אין סוף.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to this explanation of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, everyone has the right to come up with chiddushim, it is an obligation to keep stheiging so to speak.</p>\n\n\n",

Abarbanel brings a proof from the grammar of the word \"משיתהו\", which sounds like someone else had drawn him out.</p>\n\n<p>Shadal himself seems to assume that Pharaoh's daughter simply said this in Egyptian, and the Torah translated to Hebrew:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי מן המים משיתהו – היא אמרה בל׳ מצרי, והכתוב אמר בלה״ק, והזכיר פעל משה להיותו ל׳ הנופל על הלשון.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He explains how Moses comes from Egyptian as follows (including sources):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומ״מ משה היה שמו (ולא שם אחר כגון מוניוס כדברי ראב״ע), כי mo בל׳ מצרי מים, usee מֻצָּל, והנה משה ענינו מֻצָּל ממים. ומזה היה כי המתרגם האלכסנדרי במקום משה כותב תמיד Mωυσής (Mo-yses)‎ להיות תחלה גזרתו (Mo-isee), וכן יוסף פלאויוס כתב כי המלה מורכבת מן Mo-yses, שענינו מֻצָל ממים (Jablonsky וראז׳{נמילר} וגיז׳{ניוס}).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hizkuni says that according to the Rabbis, she had converted and learned the language (which would support Ibn Ezra), but says that according to the \"Peshat\" of the verse, she did not know Hebrew, likely implying what Shadal suggests himself.</p>\n\n<p>Note: There are a few other worthy notes in RDZ Hoffman, Netziv, and Minchas Yehudah there, I will try to add them when I have some time later, or I invite any reader to edit them in (they are available at the above link).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Some thoughts from Rabbi Kaplan's Living Torah on that passuk.</p>\n\n<p>He writes that moshe means son in Egyptian.

The word moshe may indeed be of Semitic origin introduced by the Semitic Hyksos.\n  According to other ancient sources the name Moses comes from the Egyptian <em>mo</em> (water) and <em>uses</em> (drawn from) Josephus Antiquities 2:9:6, Contra Apion 1:31, Philo De Vita Moses 2:17, Malbim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Henry_Breasted\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">James Henry Breasted</a>, in <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.76190\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Dawn of Conscience</em></a> (p. 350) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is evident that some of the Hebrew nomads, after  having taken\n  refuge in Egypt in time of famine, were  subjected to slavery, from\n  which a Hebrew of statesman-like gifts and notable powers of\n  leadership, who placed  himself at their head, delivered them and thus\n  became  the first great Hebrew leader whose name has come down  to us.\n  It is important to notice that his name, Moses, was  Egyptian. It is\n  simply the Egyptian word “mose” meaning “child,” and is an\n  abridgement of a fuller form of  such names as “Amen-mose” meaning\n  “Amon-a-child”  or “Ptah-mose,” meaning “Ptah-a-child,” these forms \n  themselves being likewise abbreviations for the complete  form\n  “Amon-(has-given)-a-child” or “Ptah-(has-given)-a-child.” The\n  abbreviation “child” early became a convenient rapid form for the\n  cumbrous full name, and the  name Mose, “child,” is not uncommon on\n  the Egyptian  monuments.

Then, Elisha refutes him and gives another explanation that, offhand, sounds valid.</p>\n\n<p>If one were, say, studying with someone else and his friend offered a novel explanation, how would one be able to evaluate if it was valid or the words of a heretic similar to Elisha ben Avuya?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> While I'm citing the example of Elisha ben Avuya, please generalize your answer regarding dealing with anyone.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>One approach is discussed in the continuation of the Gemara in Chagiga:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But how did R. Meir learn Torah at the mouth of Aher? Behold Rabbah b.\n  Bar Hana said that R. Johanan said: What is the meaning of the verse,\n  For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the\n  Law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts? [This\n  means that] if the teacher is like an angel of the Lord of hosts, they\n  should seek the Law at his mouth, but if not, they should not seek the\n  Law at his mouth! — Resh Lakish answered: R. Meir found a verse and\n  expounded it [as follows]: Incline thine ear, and hear the words of\n  the wise, and apply thy heart unto my knowledge. It does not say,\n  ‘unto their knowledge’, but ‘unto my knowledge’. R. Hanina said, [he\n  decided it] from here: Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline\n  thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house etc.\n  The verses contradict one another! There is no contradiction: in the\n  one case Scripture refers to an adult, in the other to a child. When\n  R. Dimi came [to Babylon] he said: In the West, they say: R. Meir ate\n  the date and threw the kernel away. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Chagigah.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, until one has reached a certain level of intellectual maturity one must be very careful about whom he learns from, precisely because it is difficult to distinguish the good from the bad.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are a couple of points in your question which should be clarified. If you consult the Gemarah you cite I believe your reading is not accurate. Elisha did not refute anything R' Meir said, he only countered that R' Meir's teaching was not in accord with the way R' Akiva, R' Meir's teacher, learned. AFAIK nothing Acher says there is heretical. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of your question, assuming (and this is a big assumption) that the Rambam's <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/332555/jewish/Maimonides-13-Principles-of-Faith.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13 principles of faith</a> are binding, then the listener would merely need to know if what s/he is hearing violate those principles. In a <a href=\"https://issuu.com/orthodoxunion/docs/winter_18_for_issuu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">recent Jewish Action article</a> (starting on page 55) Rabbi Weiderblank makes the assertion that if a novel interpretation goes against the basic gist of how something has been interpreted for millennia; for example if one were to propose that Esav was a complete tzaddik, even if this assertion is logical and sourced in the verses it would be heretical. </p>\n\n\n",

For instance, see Shabbos 115b, \"כותבי ברכות כשורפי תורה\", <em>Those who write down blessings are like a burner of the Torah</em>. The question could arise why we have a siddur today; and the answer is that around 875 CE some scholars approached Rav Amram Gaon and asked him to write down the text of the siddur,\n out of fear of the text becoming lost. This would be similar to Rav Yehudah HaNasi's writing down of the Mishnah, which was forbidden, but it was done in a period when Torah Sheba'al Peh was in danger of becoming lost.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><strong>The men of the great assembly</strong></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.33a.27?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 33a</a>, the Men of the Great Assembly (אנשי כנסת הגדולה) instituted blessings, prayers, kiddush, and havdala. (These translations are copied from the linked page at sefaria.org.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנשי כנסת הגדולה תקנו להם לישראל ברכות ותפלות קדושות והבדלות</p>\n<p>The members of the Great Assembly established for Israel blessings and prayers, sanctifications and havdalot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam, in the laws of prayer (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah,_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1:4</a>), probably based on this source, describes how Ezra and his court authored the blessings because of the inability of the people to express themselves properly in Hebrew.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כיון שגלו ישראל בימי נבוכדנצר הרשע נתערבו בפרס ויון ושאר האומות ונולדו להם בנים בארצות הגוים ואותן הבנים נתבלבלו שפתם והיתה שפת כל אחד ואחד מעורבת מלשונות הרבה וכיון שהיה מדבר אינו יכול לדבר כל צורכו בלשון אחת אלא בשיבוש שנאמר ובניהם חצי מדבר אשדודית וגו' ואינם מכירים לדבר יהודית וכלשון עם ועם ומפני זה כשהיה אחד מהן מתפלל תקצר לשונו לשאול חפציו או להגיד שבח הקדוש ברוך הוא בלשון הקדש עד שיערבו עמה לשונות אחרות. וכיון שראה עזרא ובית דינו כך עמדו ותקנו להם שמנה עשרה ברכות על הסדר</p>\n<p>When the people of Israel went into exile in the days of the wicked Nebucednezzar, they mingled with the Persians, Greeks and other nations. In those foreign countries, children were born to them, whose language was confused. Everyone's speech was a mixture of many tongues. No one was able, when he spoke, to express his thoughts adequately in any one language, otherwise than incoherently, as it is said, \"And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod and they could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people\" (Nehemiah 13:24). Consequently, when anyone of them prayed in Hebrew, he was unable adequately to express his needs or recount the praises of God, without mixing Hebrew with other languages. When Ezra and his Council realized this condition, they ordained the Eighteen Benedictions in their present order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that Rambam doesn't connect this to the destruction of the Temple; according to him, everyone prayed in his own way (1:3).</p>\n<p>This is the source for the prayers having been formulated by the Men of the Great Assembly. However, this tradition (unlike Rambam) says neither that they established the wording, nor that they established eighteen blessings.</p>\n<p><strong>Rabban Gamli'el</strong></p>\n<p>A barayta in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.28b.23?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 28b</a> tells us that Shim'on Happakuli arranged the eighteen blessings before Rabban Gamli'el in Yavne. (Shmu'el Hakkatan arranged the nineteenth blessing, against the heretics, as told later in the same barayta.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמעון הפקולי הסדיר י\"ח ברכות לפני רבן גמליאל על הסדר ביבנה</p>\n<p>Shim'on Happakuli arranged eighteen blessings in order before Rabban Gamli'el in Yavne (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Koren translation at sefaria.org actually tries to harmonize this with the opinion of the Rambam earlier by saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shimon HaPakuli arranged the eighteen blessings, <strong>already extant during the period of the Great Assembly</strong>, before Rabban Gamliel, the Nasi of the Sanhedrin, in order in Yavne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ezra Fleischer, in <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/23598311\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> (Hebrew) advances the view that the wording of the prayers was instituted by Rabban Gamli'el at Yavne. Rabban Gamli'el was also the one who scolded Rabbi Yehoshua on \"that day\" (בו ביום) because the latter said that the evening prayer was optional (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.28a.2?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 28a</a>). The mishna in Berachot (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berakhot.4.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">4:3,4</a>) shows the differing opinions of his contemporaries: Rabbi Yehoshua thought people should pray a \"shortened eighteen blessings\" (מעין י\"ח), and Rabbi Eli'ezer believed that anyone whose prayer was fixed (קבע) was acting improperly (note, though, that the Talmud interprets Rabbi Eli'ezer differently).</p>\n<p>Also, it's obvious that many of the blessings (such as רצה and ולירושלים) must have been instituted <em>after</em> the destruction of the Second Temple. I'm not sure exactly how Rambam would explain these prayers.</p>\n<p><strong>Later additions</strong></p>\n<p>Rav and Shmu'el instituted the prayer ותודיענו which is recited in the holiday prayer after Shabbat (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.33b.14?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 33b</a>). This is the only explicit statement I know of that refers to adding a prayer in the shmone esre after Rabban Gamli'el.</p>\n\n\n",

His reasoning is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The neshama is by its nature lofty and spiritual, and if left to its own nature, would immediately refine and purify the physicality of the body. This would obviously eliminate the whole purpose of putting the body and the neshama together, as it would eliminate the entire context for the challenge of choosing spirituality. Therefore, Hashem artificially limited the neshama (or, more accurately, commanded the neshama to limit itself) such that it would not do this. However, even after that, upon the performance of a mitzvah, the spiritual \"energy\" (for lack of a better word) that the neshama would gain would immediately cause the same imbalance, and the neshama would refine the body. Therefore, the spiritual \"energy\" (still haven't come up with a better word) was put on hold. The neshama will gain this spiritual growth from the mitzvos that it does in the \"World of Souls,\" which is where the neshamos go after a person dies. When the neshama returns to the body, it is with this heightened spiritual energy that it is able to refine the body and bring it up to the level where they can be partners in receiving the eternal reward.</p>\n\n<p>A representative excerpt from Derech Hashem (1:3:12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יב. ואולם מלבד היות עולם הנשמות מקום לנשמות לשבת בו כל זמן היותן מצפות לגוף, כמו שכתבנו, הנה עוד תועלת גדול נמצא בו לנשמות עצמן ואחריהן לגוף, למה שיצטרך אחר כך בזמן התחיה. וזה, כי אחר שהיתה הגזירה על האדם שלא יגיע לשלימות אלא אחרי המות, אף על פי שכבר נראה לו מצד מעשיו עודנו חי, כי זולת זה לא היה מגיע לו מעולם, שהרי אין זמן קניית השלימות אלא בעולם הזה טרם המוות, וכמו שנתבאר; עוד נמשך מן הגזירה הזאת, שהנשמה כל זמן היותה בגוף בעולם הזה שהרע דבוק בו, שאי אפשר שיפרד ממנו לגמרי, תהיה גם היא חשוכה ועמומה. ואף על פי שעל ידי המעשים הטובים שהאדם עושה קונה היא בעצמה שלימות יקר, לא יוכל הדבר להיגלות, ולא תוכל להזדהר בזוהר שהיה ראוי לה להזדהר כפי היקר ההוא שהיא משגת באמת, אלא הכל נשאר כבוש בעצמותה עד הזמן שינתן להיגלות. ואולם אין העכבה מצידה כלל, כי אם מצד הגוף, כמו שנתבאר. והוא עצמו מפסיד בזה, שלא יקבל כל אותו הזמן הזיכוך שהיה ראוי שיקבל, כמו שנתבאר. אמנם גם היא מפסדת, שהיא כבושה בעצמה ואינה יכולה לפשט זהריה. ועוד, שאינה פועלת הפעולה הראויה לה, שהיא זיכוך הגוף. ואילו היתה פועלת אותה, היתה משתלמת בזה שלימות גדול מצד מהות הפעולה עצמה, שהרי פעולת שלימות היא היות מיטיב ומשלים זולתו. ועוד, שזאת היא הפעולה הנאותה לה לפי מבעה וחוקה, שלכך נוצרה; וכל נברא משתלם כשפועל מה שחקק לו בוראו יתברך שיפעל, וחסר משלימות כל זמן שלא יפעלהו. ואמנם בצאת הנשמה מהגוף ולכתה אל עולם הנשמות, הנה שם מתפשטת ומזדהרת בזהריה כפי מה שראוי לה על פי מעשיה, ובמה שהיא משגת שם כל זמן היותה שם, מתחזקת ממה שנתחלשה בגוף, ומזדמנת יותר למה שראוי שתעשה בזמן התחיה, עד שכשתשוב בגוף בזמן הראוי, תוכל לפעול בו הפעולה הנאותה לה, דהיינו הזיכוך שזכרנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is there no Kaddish after Torah reading at mincha on a fast day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Every Torah reading is followed by half Kaddish, except for Shabbat and fast day mincha. </p>\n\n<p>Mishnah Berurah #4 on <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%91_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 292:1</a> says that on Shabbat and fast days we don't say Kaddish after Torah reading because there is really nothing interrupting the Torah reading and the Kaddish that's said just before <em>Amidah</em>, so that Kaddish works for the one that should be said after Torah reading.</p>\n\n<p>This reasoning seems to work for Shabbat. But, on fast days a haftarah is said. WHy does Mishnah Berurah not consider that as a <em>hefsek</em> (interruption)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See Magen Avrraham OC 292 SK 2</p>\n\n<p>The reason is that there is nothing between the eventually (and not existing)  kaddich after the third ole and the kaddich before Tefilah shmona esre. The source is in in Hagahot Maymoniot. The Sefer Hapardes says that the Kaddich before the shmona esre plays for the end of kriat Hatora, despite the interruption by gelila. The Rivash says that if there is no Sefer to read, they don't need to say the Kaddich before Shmona esre. This last din is controversial.\n<strong>Regarding fasts, the Hagahot Maymoniot says that the maftir is not after the end of kria but he is the acharon. There is no reason to say Kaddich after the Levi because the kria is not finished. In the middle of the presence of the maftir,  this is not possible because the ole hasn't finished.</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ג' אנשים:    וא\"א קדיש על התורה שאין כאן במה להפסיק בין קדיש זה לקדיש שקודם י\"ח ואפי' במנחה בתענית שמפטירין אין כאן הפסק דהפטרה שייכא אל הקריאה (הגמ\"נ) וכ\"כ בליקוטי פרד\"ס שהקדיש שלפני י\"ח קאי אקריא' ואף על פי שמפסיקין בין הקריא' לקדיש עד שיגלול ס\"ת לא חשיב הפסק דסיומא אריכת' היא עכ\"ל וכ\"מ בלבוש וכתב הריב\"ש סי' שנ\"א דבמקום שאין ס\"ת א\"א קדיש שלפני י\"ח ונ\"ל שלא יאמרו ג\"כ ואני תפלתי כמש\"ל וגם שלא להפסיק בין הקדיש שאחר ובא לציון לתפל' י\"ח וא\"ל שיאמרו ואני תפלתי ויאמרו קדיש עליו דפסוק א' לא חשיב הפסק מידי דהוי איהללו או יאמרוהו קוד' הקדיש וכ\"כ בסידור מהרר\"ה שלעולם לא יתחילו י\"ח בלא קדיש שלפניו:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, since the purpose of the intention of Moshe was to help and fix his Neshama by killing him with the Shem Hameforash, if so, he killed him Beshogeg (i.e. <strong>since his intentions were for good, even though he killed him, it is not punishable by death, rather by Galus</strong>), and this is why it continues \"Vaasher Lo Tzadah\", which refers to Moshe...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rambam on the relationship between oneness and incorporeality\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of Rambam's arguments for the existence of only one God is that the existence of multiple gods by definition implies some form of corporeality.</p>\n<p><strong>Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 1:7</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלוה זה אחד הוא ואינו שנים ולא יתר על שנים אלא אחד שאין כיחודו אחד מן\nהאחדים הנמצאים בעולם לא אחד כמין שהוא כולל אחדים הרבה ולא אחד כגוף\nשהוא נחלק למחלקות ולקצוות אלא יחוד שאין יחוד אחר כמותו בעולם <strong>אילו היו\nאלוהות הרבה היו גופין וגויות מפני שאין הנמנים השוין במציאותן נפרדין זה\nמזה אלא במאורעין שיארעו בגופות והגויות</strong> ואילו היה היוצר גוף וגוייה היה\nלו קץ ותכלית שאי אפשר להיות גוף שאין לו קץ וכל שיש לגופו קץ ותכלית יש\nלכחו קץ וסוף ואלהינו ברוך שמו הואיל וכחו אין לו קץ ואינו פוסק שהרי\nהגלגל סובב תמיד אין כחו כח גוף והואיל ואינו גוף לא יארעו לו מאורעות\nהגופות כדי שיהא נחלק ונפרד מאחר לפיכך אי אפשר שיהיה אלא אחד וידיעת דבר\nזה מצות עשה שנאמר ה' אלהינו ה' אחד</p>\n<p>This God is one. He is not two or more, but one, unified in a manner\nwhich [surpasses] any unity that is found in the world; i.e., He is\nnot one in the manner of a general category which includes many\nindividual entities, nor one in the way that the body is divided into\ndifferent portions and dimensions. Rather, He is unified, and there\nexists no unity similar to His in this world.</p>\n<p><strong>If there were many gods<sup>1</sup>, they would have body and form, because like\nentities are separated from each other only through the circumstances\nassociated with body and form.</strong></p>\n<p>Were the Creator to have body and form, He would have limitation and\ndefinition, because it is impossible for a body not to be limited. And\nany entity which itself is limited and defined [possesses] only\nlimited and defined power. Since our God, blessed be His name,\npossesses unlimited power, as evidenced by the continuous revolution\nof the sphere, we see that His power is not the power of a body. Since\nHe is not a body, the circumstances associated with bodies that\nproduce division and separation are not relevant to Him. Therefore, it\nis impossible for Him to be anything other than one.</p>\n<p>The knowledge of this concept fulfills a positive commandment, as\n[implied by Deuteronomy 6:4]: \"[Hear, Israel,] God is our Lord, God is\none.\" (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, when he discusses angels he asserts that they are also incorporeal, yet he states that there are many different angels.</p>\n<p><strong>Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 2:2-5</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל מה שברא הקב\"ה בעולמו נחלק לשלשה חלקים מהן ברואים שהן מחוברים מגולם\nוצורה והם הווים ונפסדים תמיד כמו גופות האדם והבהמה והצמחים והמתכות\nומהן ברואים שהן מחוברים מגולם וצורה אבל אינן משתנין מגוף לגוף ומצורה\nלצורה כמו הראשונים אלא צורתן קבועה לעולם בגולמם ואינן משתנין כמו אלו\nוהם הגלגלים והכוכבים שבהן ואין גולמם כשאר גולמים ולא צורתם כשאר צורות\n<strong>ומהן ברואים צורה בלא גולם כלל והם המלאכים שהמלאכים אינם גוף וגויה אלא צורות נפרדות זו מזו</strong></p>\n<p>ומהו זה שהנביאים אומרים שראו המלאך אש ובעל כנפים הכל במראה הנבואה ודרך\nחידה לומר שאינו גוף ואינו כבד כגופות הכבדים כמו שנאמר כי ה' אלהיך אש\nאוכלה הוא ואינו אש אלא משל וכמו שנאמר עושה מלאכיו רוחות</p>\n<p><strong>ובמה יפרדו הצורות זו מזו והרי אינן גופין לפי שאינן שוין במציאותן אלא כל אחד מהן למטה ממעלתו של חבירו והוא מצוי מכחו זה למעלה מזה</strong> והכל\nנמצאים מכחו של הקדוש ברוך הוא וטובו וזהו שרמז שלמה בחכמתו ואמר כי גבוה\nמעל גבוה שומר</p>\n<p>Everything which the Holy One, blessed be He, created within His world\nis divided into three categories. They include:</p>\n<p>a) Creations which are a combination of matter and form. They are\nconstantly coming into existence and ceasing to exist; for example,\nthe bodies of man and beasts, plants, and metals.</p>\n<p>b) Creations which are [also] a combination of matter and form, but do\nnot change from body to body and from form to form as those in the\nfirst category. Rather, their form is permanently fixed in their\nmatter, and they do not change as the others do; for example, the\nspheres and the stars [which revolve] in them. The matter [from which]\nthey [are composed] differs from [a simple conception of] matter, and\ntheir form differs from [a simple conception of] form.</p>\n<p>c) <strong>Creations which have form, but no matter at all; for example, the\nangels, for the angels do not possess bodies or corporeal being, but\nrather are forms which are separate from each other.</strong></p>\n<p>What is meant by the prophets' statements that they saw an angel of\nfire or with wings? All these are prophetic visions and parables, as\n[Deuteronomy 4:24] states: \"God, your Lord, is consuming fire,\" though\nHe is not fire and [the description of Him in this manner] is only\nmetaphoric. Similarly, [Psalms 104:4] states: \"He makes His angels as\nwinds....\"</p>\n<p><strong>Since they possess no body, what separates the form [of the angels] from each other? Their existence is not alike. Rather each one is\nbelow the level of the other and exists by virtue of its influence,\n[in a progression of levels,] one above the other.</strong></p>\n<p>Everything exists by virtue of the influence of the Holy One, blessed\nbe He, and His goodness. Solomon alluded to this [concept] in his\nwisdom, saying (Ecclesiastes 5:7): \"Because above the one who is high\nthere is a watcher [and there are others higher than them].\" (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904962/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why is it that angels can be distinguished from each other without a physical manifestation, yet gods cannot be distinguished from each other without a physical manifestation?</p>\n<p>Even if one were to argue, as does R. Elyahu Touger in his footnote to 1:7, that Rambam is even referring to \"a spiritual sense of these concepts\", it does not explain why gods cannot be differentiated while angels can.</p>\n<p>If one were to point out that the very method of differentiation of angels is based on their hierarchy of levels which, if existing for gods would by definition render them non-gods (if there is a god on a higher level, the lower god by definition is lacking a quality of godliness) then Rambam's argument is really a different argument – that the existence of multiple gods is impossible because the definition of god entails absolute power and it is impossible for two separate entities to both have absolute power (as discussed by Saadia Gaon in Emunos V'Deios 2:2).</p>\n<p>See also Guide for the Perplexed 2:1 where Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The hypothesis that there exist two Gods is inadmissible, because\nabsolutely incorporeal beings cannot be counted (Prop. XVI.), except\nas cause and effect; the relation of time is not applicable to God\n(Prop. XV.), because motion cannot be predicated of Him. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp088.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander\ntranslation</a>.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once again it appears that this argument must necessarily be predicated on the argument of impossibility of two absolute powers. Thus, the argument from the impossibility of distinguishing incorporeal entities should either be insufficient or unnecessary to prove that there is only one god.</p>\n<p>Any answers, or flaws/incorrect assumptions in the question?</p>\n<p>[I think the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22770/who-is-the-author-of-the-pirush-on-the-first-four-chapters-of-rambams-hilchos-y\">Peirush</a> sort of addresses this, but he makes the proof dependent on a different earlier premise, namely, that there can only be one First Cause. If that is the case then once again this specific proof should be either insufficient or unnecessary.]</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.One of the answers challenged this translation, and said that the word here is \"godliness\" rather than gods.

Multiple <em>equal essences</em> (שוין במציאותן) cannot coexist incorporeally. Mutiple essences that are not equal in essence can coexist incorporeally. Therefore, gods/divinities (assumed to be equal in essence), cannot coexist incorporeally. Angels, which are NOT equal in their מציאות (their מציאות are hierarchically distinguished in the chain of causation), can coexist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(As far as I understand)</p>\n<p>There are two separate discussions. One discussion is how many gods there are. In that discussion, your points as to the incompleteness of the Rambam's argument, as well as the relevance of Rav Saadia's argument, would apply. That discussion is the topic of the previous halacha in the Rambam, halacha 1:6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל המעלה על דעתו שיש שם אלוה אחר, חוץ מזה--עובר בלא תעשה</p>\n<p>Anyone who considers that there is another god other than This One violates a negative commandment ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our halacha is now discussing the G-d, which was already established that He is the only one. Now Rambam ise discussing whether this G-d is one or consists of multiplicity, or parts. Thus Rambam starts this halacha with</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלוה זה אחד הוא--אינו לא שניים ולא יתר על שניים, אלא אחד</p>\n<p>This G-d is one. <strong>He</strong> is not two nor three, rather one</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In which the Rambam is discussing the \"number,\" so to speak, of this one G-d.</p>\n<p>Rambam continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אילו היו <strong>(ה)אלוהות</strong> הרבה--היו גופין וגווייות</p>\n<p>If <strong>Godliness</strong> was many...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam does not say אילו היו אלוהים הרבה, if there were many gods, but if the concept of G-d were many. In this discussion, differentiating between something which is one unified concept could only be done by the arbitrary distinction of a boundary, or physical distinction. Thus the Rambam negates that possibility.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why is it that angels can be distinguished from each other without a physical manifestation, yet gods cannot be distinguished from each other without a physical manifestation?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is, in general, based upon a false assumption.</p>\n\n<p>You list all these details that Rambam uses to define G-d's uniqueness. Then you look at Rambam using similar language in the context of angels and make the assumption that because of that similar language it can be applied uniformly to either subject, meaning to G-d and to angels. That assumption, that the two subjects are equal, is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>G-d is not a 'נברא', a created thing or being. G-d always is, was and will be. All of creation, including all categories of angels are נבראים, creations. They have a beginning (and possibly an end). This distinction is the essence of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.1.1-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah, 1:1-4</a>.</p>\n\n<p>By definition, you cannot place the limitations of the creations upon that which transcends creation altogether. This is the meaning of what is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.117.2?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on the Torah 117:2</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>למה מכנין שמו של הקב\"ה וקורין אותו מקום מפני שהוא מקומו של עולם ואין\n  העולם מקומו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The superstition is actually of Turkish origin (at least according to <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Superstitions-Why-do-Indians-consider-bird-poop-lucky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). It's possible that the superstition made its way into Jewish culture, as the Turks have historically ruled over areas with high Sephardic Jewish populations. (They even ruled over the land of Israel for four hundred years; see <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ottoman-rule-1517-1917\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> from the Jewish Encyclopedia.) Although I can't say for sure that this is reason you've heard it, it might be interesting to note that it's not uncommon for a Sephardic superstition to have its origins in Muslim or Turkish culture. (Similarly, Ashkenazic superstitions often have roots in Northern/Eastern European culture.) For instance, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hamsa</a> is a popular amulet among many Sephardic Jews, however its origins are not Jewish at all, and it is shared throughout many Middle Eastern and North African cultures.</p>\n\n<p>Although I'm tempted to write more on superstition and being superstitious in Judaism (including many famous writers who cautioned people not to be so superstitious), that's not what the question was and therefore I will refrain. </p>\n\n\n",

The main reason that I state \"only Jews\" is that there could be a problem of \"Bishul Akum\" even if a non-Jew places kosher food in it, or even a potato.</p>\n\n<p>Practically, though, I wouldn't recommend this in a mixed environment. Most workers, I find, are both careless and \"care less\". Non-kosher food will likely get into the microwave accidentally or even purposefully. There are loads of Gentile and Jewish anti-Semites who want to cause a problem, and this is an easy way to demonstrate it, and no one will know the difference. After all, when you're not there to observe, they've cooked their food in your oven and eaten it, already. Essentially, it's highly unlikely that anyone there will guarantee that the microwave stays kosher unless a reliable Jew is standing guard watching everything that enters it.</p>\n\n<p>Case in point - someone I know works at Price Waterhouse. He says that on his floor, about 80% of the people are yarmulke / hat and / or \"tzitzit-swinging\" Jews. Despite that overwhelming majority, they won't put a kosher microwave in their pantry mainly for the reasons I mentioned, as well as that even among religious Jews, no two people have the same kashrut level. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I fully agree with DanF's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/89205/16117\">answer</a>, that unless we know for sure that it's not being used for now kosher food, we should not rely on non-Jews to keep to the rules, either because of carelessness or cluelessness or honest mistakes. I mean, did we ever put a dairy fork in the meaty sink? So if we can make that mistake, kal vachomer...</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, to be safe, I suggest that it be treated as a non-kosher microwave. You'll see that that's not such a hard thing to do.</p>\n\n<p>Below is an article by Rabbi Tzvi Rosen on Star-K's website, titled Microwaving in the workplace. It's about using a non-kosher microwave.</p>\n\n<p>(The full article can be found <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/kosher-appliances/489/microwaving-in-the-workplace/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are three types of microwaves:  <strong>Regular</strong> microwaves, Microwaves with a <strong>browning element</strong>, and <strong>Convection microwaves</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p>A <strong>browning element microwave</strong> or a <strong>convection microwave</strong> must be\n  treated like a regular oven and food to be heated must be completely\n  double wrapped in leakproof wrapping. For example, Two Ziploc bags or\n  Saran Wrap.</p>\n  \n  <p>Since the chamber of a <strong>regular</strong> microwave does not get hot, food can be warmed uncovered if the following criteria are met:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>The microwave – the ceiling, floor, and door and walls are completely clean of food particles, spills or residue. </p></li>\n  <li><p>No non kosher food is being microwaved in the microwave at the same time. </p></li>\n  <li><p>The floor or turntable is covered or the food is placed on a thick plate.</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p><strong>Q</strong>. What qualifies as adequate floor covering or thick enough plate? </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>A</strong>. A sheet of styrofoam or a styrofoam plate is sufficient.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Q</strong>. Can food be warmed double wrapped in a regular microwave if a\n  person does not want to follow the cleaning criteria? </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>A</strong>. Yes</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

What did the previous part assume, to say that he pays for a full row?  It doesn't explain what the actual argument is. What would R' Akiva hold if it was a \"row between the rows\", he would hold the opposite that he pays the value of a weak one? But R' Akiva only obligates him for the actual value, so would he agree with R' Yishmael that he pays for a full one? But then what would the argument be at that point?</p>\n\n<p>And also the previous section in fact <em>did</em> take into account that \"one who takes money from his friend has to pay\", since it (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.6b.15?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Bava_Kamma.6b.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a.k.a., Rashi</a>) said that the row is amongst <em>big and small rows</em>, the simple reason for Rashi saying that is probably because if it was only among weak ones, for sure the damaged one has to prove himself that it was a big row before demanding it, so what changed in between the 2 sections of the Gemara?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Lets say high quality patch (or row) was worth $50 and the same size lower quality patch is worth $25.</p>\n\n<p>Tosfos Bav Kama 6a explains that according to Rav Idi Bar Avin, the <em>hava Amina</em> (first assumption later proven incorrect) of Gemara assumed that Rabbi Akiva says we only pay the minimum amount when unsure how much it was worth only Rabbi Yishmael says pay maximum: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי עקיבא לא בא הכתוב אלא לגבות לניזקין מן העידית משמע ששמע מר' ישמעאל שבא הכתוב לחייב יותר ממה שהזיק כגון דאם אכל כחושה משלם שמינה:<br>\n  Rabbi Akiva says the Passuk is only requiring the damager paying highest quality land he has i.e but no more than the minimum, since he heard Rabbi Yishmael saying he would pay when in doubt the maximum (e.g When unsure of damage if the Minimum damage was $25 and maximum was $50 Rabbi Akiva says pay $25 from vandal's best land, Rabbi Yishmael pay $50 which is the victims best patch) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However in the <em>Maskana</em> (conclusion) of the Gemora Rav Acha bar Yaakov explains both Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva agree <em>Hamotzi mechaveiro alav haraaya</em> One pays the minimum amount without any further proof, so the payment both according to Rabbi Akiva <em>and</em> Rabbi Yishmael is only $25 . Their dispute is which type of land to pay when they are rich:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כגון שהיתה עידית דניזק כזיבורית דמזיק ובהא פליגי רבי ישמעאל סבר בדניזק שיימינן ורבי עקיבא סבר בדמזיק שיימינן<br>\n  - If a rich man damages a a poor man's best land (e.g which is a $25 patch),Rabbi Yishmael says one who is rich and his low quality land is worth the same as the poor mans best ($25 a patch) pays that low quality land.(The rich man has even better produce worth $50 a row which he keeps).<br>\n  - Rabbi Akiva argues that this rich man should pay his own best quality land - so if an equivalent size patch is worth double ($50) he pays half a patch (worth $25) which is worth the same as a full patch of land of the poor man which he damaged*</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Note:<br>\n1. if a poor man damaged a rich man, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael agree he can only give the value of damage with the best land he's got (e.g if he damaged $50 patch he pays 2 patches of his best $25 patches)(Tosfos Kegon Gittin 49a).<br>\n2. if a rich mans damages a poor mans land (worth $25) and his worst land was better than the poor mans best land, (e.g poor mans best is $25, Rich mans worst $50 rich mans best is $100 a patch) Rabbi Yishmael agrees to Rabbi Akiva the rich man pays the damage equivalent with his own best (i.e a quater of the $100 patch) in accordance with the Torah (Bava Kama 6b).<br>\n3. Also If one wants to he can pay money/movable goods instead of land as Bava Kama 7a says ישיב לרבות שוה כסף.<br>\n(Summary of Bava Kama 6a and Gittin 48b-49a:)</p>\n\n\n",

He told me that he has known the story his whole life, he's read it or heard it in many places (including Olomeinu Magazine), and he feels sure that the story is true.</p>\n\n<p>A man died and bequeathed his 17 cows to his 3 sons on the following plan: the oldest son was to get (1/2) of the cows, the second was to get (1/3) of the cows, and the youngest son was to get (1/9). The will did not allow the sons to sell or slaughter the cows or depart from the specified amounts. The sons wanted to comply with the will but could see no way to fulfill these terms. Although they were not Jewish they brought the problem to Reb Chaim Volozon for advice. Reb Chaim suggested that if there were 18 cows instead of 17, then the oldest son would take 9 cows, the second son 6 cows, and the third son 2 cows; this is a total of 17, the actual number of cows in the estate. So, he concluded, they should actually take these latter numbers, as if the total available were 18.</p>\n\n<p>My friend had some questions about this story, and I have a few of my own.</p>\n\n<p>HALACHIC QUESTIONS</p>\n\n<p>Stated generally, problems in wills must be very common. For example some people must misstate their actual property even when writing a will, and then in their remaining years (after writing their last will) some people must acquire and part with property in ways that eventually make the descriptions found in their wills inaccurate. People must sometimes describe the allocation of their property in such a way that some property is assigned more than once and some is omitted.</p>\n\n<p>The allocation in the story does not seem to fulfill the will. Each son is rounding up the allowance under the will (taking 9 instead of 8 1/2, 6 instead of 5 2/3, 2 instead of 1 8/9), therefore taking more property than the will authorizes, and in amounts that are simply chosen for administrative convenience. Is that allowable?</p>\n\n<p>What is the proper way to deal with instructions in a will that don't make sense or cannot be executed?</p>\n\n\n",

But I have also read that some Rabbis use to play Chess, some said it was because they where depressed. There where some rules against games that made noise and made wholes in the ground, this has nothing to do with Chess. On the other hand Chess is a wargame and you destroy, not rest, and so may not keep with shabbat. Today Chess is seen as a sport as well if that might be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>There is a part of relaxing and joy that comes with Chess and is an important part of Shabbat. And you're not creating anything as far as I can see.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Chess on Shabbat is technically allowed but many note it would be better for adults to spend the day in Torah learning.</p>\n\n<p>See for instance <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2013/05/chess-in-jewish-law/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Gil Student</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You would be wrong to take for granted the permissibility of playing\n  chess on Shabbos. The issues raised include: making sounds, conducting\n  business, non-Shabbos behavior.</p>\n  \n  <p>Apparently, on old chess boards, metal pieces that knocked into each\n  other made musical sounds which might be considered forbidden on\n  Shabbos. However, Shiltei Ha-Giborim (Rif, Eruvin 35b nos. 2-3)\n  permits this because the players do not intend to make music with\n  these sounds. The Rema (Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chaim 338:5) follows the\n  Shiltei Ha-Giborim. Note that the Magen Avraham (ad loc., no. 8)\n  confirms that the Rema is discussing chess (but requires using a\n  special Shabbos set).</p>\n  \n  <p>The Magen Avraham quotes from a R. A. Sasson who argues that playing\n  chess is similar to conducting business. He seems to mean that because\n  chess was often played for money, even when you omit the prize the\n  game is still forbidden because of its usual practice. However, the\n  Rema rules that chess is only forbidden when you play for money.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Many argue that chess is simply not appropriate for Shabbos. For\n  example, the Shemiras Shabbos Ke-Hilkhasah (16:34) dismisses all\n  arguments to forbid chess. However, earlier in the chapter (16:1), he\n  says that this only applies to children. Adults should spend the day\n  in spiritual–religious–pleasure.</strong> Similarly, R. Moshe Feinstein\n  (Iggeros Moshe, Yoreh De’ah 3:15:2) rules that chess is not\n  technically forbidden but should be avoided because of ve-dabeir\n  davar, by which I think he means that the game is not in the spirit of\n  Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See here from <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/01-22-13/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Eliezer Melamed</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Poskim disagree whether one may play games on Shabbat. Some say that\n  since Shabbat is meant for Torah study, one may not play games, as\n  that would be wasting time that could be used to study Torah.\n  Accordingly, one may not play checkers, chess, backgammon, billiards,\n  or any ball game, whether the games are played inside on the floor or\n  outside on a paved area. And since one may not play these games, they\n  are considered muktzeh as well (R. Aharon Sasson, cited in Birkei\n  Yosef 338:1; Petaĥ Ha-devir ad loc. 4).</p>\n  \n  <p>Others maintain that there is no prohibition on playing games on\n  Shabbat, as long as nobody is playing for money (Rema 338:5; Ma’amar\n  Mordechai). Indeed, some rabbis would play chess on Shabbat, as it is\n  a game that requires thought and sharpens the mind (Shiltei\n  Giborim).</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>In practice, it is appropriate for adults to be stringent and not play\n  ball games, chess, and the like, both because it is prohibited\n  according to some poskim and because one should not to get used to\n  neglecting Torah study on Shabbat. Those who wish to be lenient have\n  an opinion on which to rely</strong> (see SA 308:45; MA 338:5; MB ad loc. 21;\n  Kaf Ha-ĥayim ad loc. 39). Children should also be trained to study\n  Torah on Shabbat, but almost all poskim agree that one should not\n  prevent them from playing games on Shabbat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In addition to the previous answer, there is another consideration. I believe Rav Moshe Feinstein (I think this is in Igrot Moshe) noted that there are people who get very upset when they lose a game of chess. Such people shouldn't play on Shabbat to avoid experiencing emotional distress on Shabbat. </p>\n\n\n",

When did the practice of writing with a feather begin?

The differences in use was more related to writing properties and the type of klaf (parchment) in use. Reeds are more commonly used by Sefaradim whose klaf is much softer and thicker (I believe that feathers skip too much on such klaf). Also, there is a trade-off: reeds write smoother but need to be sharpened more frequently, while metal has the opposite properties. feathers seem to strike the happy medium.

It appears that there are <a href=\"http://www.practicalhalacha.com/halacha.php?id=2518\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">two</a> general components, Shamor (refraining from the forbidden behaviors -- negative) and Zachor (engaging in proper behaviors, positive).

Aside from the Kiddush, candles, havdalah, there seems to be an obligation to have \"oneg\" and \"kibud\" but do those require intent? If I sit and eat tasty foods and put on special clothes, but only because I want to, not considering that it is Shabbat, have I fulfilled that aspect of Zachor? Have I been mechalel Shabbat, or not observed it in the \"proper\" way if I don't have Shabbat in mind when relaxing?</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, If I sleep through the entire 25 hour period, have I observed Shabbat in any proper sense (having done no melachot but without awareness of Shamor, and not having actively done \"Zachor\")?</p>\n\n\n",

That's in line with how Chazal generally avoid ascribing such intensely physical things to God, even as an anthropomorphism (e.g. God smells our offerings, but does not taste them).</p>\n\n<p>The Artscroll Baal HaTurim does not say this is based on any prior source. Is there <em>any</em> place in which intimacy with the Jewish People is described in Tanach or Chazal?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The most straightforward book is <strong>Shir Hashirim</strong> with all its allegories and interpretations. </p>\n\n<p>Between 3 types of intimacy b/w Hashem and Am Israel (Slaves, Sons, Spouse), this topic is not referenced or discussed by the mainstream (non-Hassidic) Meforshim, as it is very delicate. If you dig deeper in Hassidic and Kabbalic sources, you will find a lot of such allegories and metaphors.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: THIS ANSWER CAN NOT BE UNREAD. IF YOU THINK HOW YOU RELATE TO A POPULAR <em>TEFILLAH</em> AND SONG WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM BEING ANALYZED IN THIS CONTEXT -- SKIP READING THIS!!!!</p>\n<p>Aside from Shir haShirim (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/89254/1570\">R' Al Berko's answer</a>), there is another example in Tanakh that would more famous -- if people paid more attention to what they're saying in <em>tefillah</em>.</p>\n<p>Yeshaiah 62:5 is explicit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּֽי־יִבְעַ֤ל בָּחוּר֙ בְּתוּלָ֔ה, יִבְעָל֖וּךְ בָּנָ֑יִךְ; וּמְשׂ֤וֹשׂ\nחָתָן֙ עַל־כַּלָּ֔ה, יָשִׂ֥ישׂ עָלַ֖יִךְ אֱלֹקיִךְ׃</p>\n<p>For as a young man consummates his marriage with a maiden, so shall You consummate your marriage with us; and as a groom rejoices on his bride, so shall your G-d Rejoice upon you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"על\" in the second half of the verse could have been taken to mean \"about\", figuratively \"over\" -- meaning \"as a groom rejoices about his bride\". But is pretty clear from the context of the first clause talking about בעילה (marital intimacy) that the clause means \"on\", literally.</p>\n<p>From which Rav Shelomo haLevi al-Qabetz (16th cent Tzefat) paraphrases in Lekha Dodi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יָשיש עָלַיִךְ אֱלקיִךְ. כִּמְשוש חָתָן עַל כַּלָּה.</p>\n<p>Your G-d should rejoice on you the way a groom rejoices on a bride.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most <em>siddurim</em> translate it \"rejoice over\", with a figurative connotation. Ignoring the scriptural source, or perhaps aware that <em>siddurim</em> have younger readers. But given that the author of the poem was one of the leading Qabbalists of Tzefas, erotic imagery is far more likely. And in any case, R Shlomo al-Qabetz's familiarity with the <em>pasuq</em> in Yeshaiah is a given.</p>\n<p>However, the songwriters who put melodies to this line of Lekha Dodi couldn't possibly be aware of the original in Yeshaiah. Because as a song to sing at weddings, these words are <strong>incredibly</strong> inappropriate.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources forbidding a gentile from keeping the Sabbath\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77371/gentile-keeping-shabbos\">read</a> that there is a halacha that a non-Jew may not observe Shabbat. This seems to stem from the gemara cited <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16325/1362\">here</a> and the Rambam listed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13448/1362\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But the gemara only seems to be saying that a non-Jew may not cease his productive employment out of laziness [<strong>sheshavat</strong>] (the Schottenstein reads \"an idolater who <em>ceased working</em> for an entire day\" as opposed to the translation in the linked answer which reads \"A heathen who <em>keeps a day of rest</em>\" and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/77476/1362\">this</a> answer which reads \" A non-Jew who <em>observes Shabbos</em>\"). In fact, the Schottenstein explains Ravina's elaboration that even a Monday would qualify to point out that the issue is not the religious observance of the Sabbath but any choice not to work for any day.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam says (in Hilchot Melachim 10:9) \"וכן גוי ששבת--אפילו ביום מימות החול--אם עשה אותו לעצמו כמו שבת\" a non-Jew <strong>sheshavat</strong>, even on a weekday. He then explains \"if he <em>made it for himself as a Sabbath</em>\" so the reasoning has to be religious: he did it for religious reasons but not as part of observing a Jewish sabbath. He continues \"אין מניחין אותן לחדש דת, ולעשות מצוות לעצמן מדעתן\" \"They are not to be allowed to originate a new religion or create mitzvot for themselves based on their own decisions\" (translation from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188355/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). The Rambam also says a line later, \"If a gentile studies the Torah, makes a Sabbath, or creates a religious practice, a Jewish court should beat him, punish him, and inform him that he is obligated to die.\" This is at odds with Ravina's statement but can't be a blanket condemnation of all Torah related behavior of the non-Jew because a convert can study the Torah, at least <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/47908/1362\">parts</a> of it. It also can't be a blanket condemnation because the Rambam, then writes, \"We should not prevent a gentile who desires to perform one of the Torah's mitzvot in order to receive reward from doing so, provided he performs it as required.\" He is not creating a religious practice, just following Jewish law, so it is OK (and he doesn't say \"except for observing the Sabbath).</p>\n\n<p>So the problem according to the Rambam still has to be doing these things in an effort to create his own religious practice, not in an effort to observe them as mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>So how do these two sources (one about laziness and one about crafting a new religion) develop into the idea that a non-Jew who wants to rest or observe the Sabbath (as part of a process of Jewish belief, or at least, not in an expression of laziness) is not allowed to? I don't see a citation to the Shulchan Aruch in this regard. No where in the gemara's statement is there mention of melacha being the issue so carrying a pen wouldn't address Ravina's point and if one was in the process of converting, the Rambam's concern wouldn't be present.</p>\n\n<p>The other aspect, that the Sabbath is a unique covenant between God and the Jews so non-Jew cannot participate in it, seems not to connect with either of the potential sources. And since observance requires both Shamor and Zachor, a non-Jew should be able to \"rest\" completely and just not make Kiddush.</p>\n\n<p>Then how/where did the statement of the gemara and the Rambam turn into the conventional wisdom which leads to jokes like <a href=\"http://crazyjewishconvert.blogspot.com/2011/07/oldie-but-goodie-ever-present-convert.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>? How did a concern about laziness or about making a new religion turn into a prohibition against keeping a sincere and proper Sabbath on the path to conversion?</p>\n\n\n",

It's long, but the essence of his explanation is near the beginning. He says this means that it is a day of rest.

That's not in this verse, but later on regarding Yom Kippur.)</p>\n\n<p>While both words do imply a day of rest, שבת is generally used to refer either to the 7th day of the week, or sometimes it means just \"week\". So, perhaps, to avoid confusion, the Torah uses the word שבתון to clarify that one should rest on this day even though some form of <em>melacha</em> is permissible on Yom Tov, unlike on שבת .</p>\n\n<p>The word שבתות in 23:15 means, simply \"weeks\".

This prohibition is codified by Rabbeinu Yerucham (Nesiv 2, §50) and by Rama (Yoreh Deah §284:2). Rama (Teshuvos HaRama §34) is inclined to rule that one can treat Torah materials written in the popular script differently than an actual Torah scroll because the former is not written in the real Ashuri and is therefore not as holy as a Torah scroll. However, Rabbi Aharon HaKohen of Lunel adds (Orchos Chaim, Hilchos Talmud Torah §9) that for this reason the Sephardic Jews traditionally write in a script that is different enough from traditional Ashuri that it can be considered an entirely different script.

In regards to where, all of the manuscripts of the \"Rashi on the Rif\" are Ashkenazi, and in many places, the author copies Rashi word for word, but replaces Rashi's translation into French with a German word.

    "title": "Why is it neccesary to have an Oral Law?",
    "content": "# Why is it neccesary to have an Oral Law?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why was it necessary to have an oral law? Couldn't we have avoided inaccuracies and machlokot in the mishnah, gemara and etc by writing it down originally? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Rambam in Moreh Nevochim 1:71 addresses this question. The Rambam actually says that the opposite is true - the integrity of the Oral law was preserved <em>specifically</em> by it's being oral. The Rambam writes as follows (קאפח edition):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכבר ידעת כי אפילו תורה שבע\"פ המקובלת לא היתה כתובה לפנים, כפי הצווי המפורסם באומה \"דברים שאמרתי לך על פה אי אתה רשאי לאמרם בכתב\", והרי זו היא תכלית החכמה בתורה, לפי שהיתה הרחקה ממה שאירע בה בסופו של דבר, כלומר רבוי הסברות והסתעפות השטות, ומשפטים בלתי ברורים שיארעו בהסברת המחבר, ושכחה שתארע לו, ויתחדשו מחלוקות בין בני אדם ונעשים כתות ונבוכים במעשה. אלא נמסר בכל זה לבית דין הגדול</p>\n<p>(My rough translation) : Of course you are aware that even the Oral Torah which we have received was not originally written down, according to the accepted command \"that which I have said to you orally you are not allowed to say in writing,\" and this is the epitome of wisdom by the Torah, as it serves to fend off that which eventually ended up happening, namely abundance of [conflicting] lines of reasoning and branching off of opinions, unclear statements through the explanatory skills and forgetfulness of the author, and disagreements arise and they become splintered groups, and what should be done becomes unclear. Rather, the entire system was given over to the Great Court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As R' Yaakov Weinberg explained, a role of the Sanhedrin, as custodians of the Oral Law, was to explain it to the contemporary generation. Oral Law was <em>specifically</em> meant to be communicated in modern parlance, with examples that were clear to the person to whom they were being given. Oral Law was specifically <em>not</em> meant to be codified into static passages which would not have the same meaning in different cultures and periods. The system of Oral transmission forced that the Torah was given over in contemporary terms, face to face with a live person who would explain it in a way that you understood it.</p>\n<p>It was only when this system broke down, and the ability to maintain the actual body of knowledge became impractical, that the risk of losing the content of the Oral Law overrode the method that guaranteed its clarity of transmission. This led to the current system, in which set-in-stone phrases become subject to the debate of their meaning, and different paths of reasoning in order to make sense of unclear statements emerge.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>To just answer your question:</p>\n\n<p>1- Because no finite text could fully describe what it the right answer for every situation and every context a human being might face. Therefore, Hashem gave Moshe a system, not a set of halachic conclusions and agadic guidelines. Something with which human beings can derive the rest.</p>\n\n<p>2- No finite text could capture Hashem's Thought anyway.</p>\n\n<p>3- The whole point of Torah study is the exercise of figuring answers out. G-d didn't want Torah study to be memorization. This is why we still study gemara, rather than just skip to the chase with the Rif's selection of its conclusions, or study just the Rambam's Mishneh Torah or the like.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem gave Moshe a process for humans to work. This is why, in the <em>tanur shel akhnai</em> story (Bava Metzia 59a-b), even though R' Eliezer is capable of invoking miracles \"if I am correct\", the law still follows the majority against him. Halakhah follows the process given, the kelalei hapesaq -- the rules of decisionmaking, not revalation of Divine Truth. The debate concludes by quoting the verse \"<em>lo bashamayim hi</em> -- it is not in heaven\", because Hashem didn't intend to give us answers. And the story concludes with us learning that at that moment Hashem laughed (so to speak) \"Nitzchuni banai -- My children have bested Me / My children have eternalized Me\".</p>\n\n<p>He intended to give us the tools with which to grapple with the question and work toward an answer. That is more important than always getting the answer right. For that matter, that work is itself the \"right answer\", which is why Hashem gave us a system in which Beis Hillel and Beis Shammai can disagree and still \"<em>eilu va'eilu divrei E-lokim chaim</em> -- both these and those are the 'living' words of G-d\". Because both worked the process.</p>\n\n<p>That is the way we can fully realize our being \"in the Image of the Divine\", and to partner with G-d in the creative process. The latter being an idea explored at length in R' JB Soloveitchik's \"Halakhic Man\". Or as his grandfather, R' Chaim Brisker, put it, through the giving of the Oral Torah, the Jewish people were elevated into becoming the \"parchment\" upon which G-d's Word is written. The Torah becomes of us, instead of an externality to study.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There already are great answers, so I'll just add two more benefits to an oral law:</p>\n\n<p>1) The written law (i.e. the Old Testament) was co-opted to form new religions. The oral law by definition will remain only among true scholars, who can be better trusted to keep it sacred and unique to Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>2) Written texts are very limited in what they can teach. While they excel at holding facts and data, they struggle to convey methods of thinking and rules for dealing with principles. The benefit of oral instruction is that it serves better to convey these abstract ideas.</p>\n\n\n",

I will paste it here and provide a source:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Pharisees argued that Shavuot is to be counted from the first day\n  of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which they designated a “Sabbath.”\n  According to the Pharisees, “morrow of the Sabbath” means the “morrow\n  of the 1st day of Unleavened Bread.” The ancient Pharisees and their\n  modern day successor the Orthodox rabbis begin the 50-day count to\n  Shavuot on the second day of Unleavened Bread, which is always the\n  16th day of the First Hebrew Month. As a result, the Pharisee Shavuot\n  always fell out in ancient times from the 5th to the 7th day of the\n  Third Hebrew Month (Sivan). After the destruction of the Temple, the\n  Pharisees became the predominant surviving faction among the Jewish\n  leadership and their interpretation is followed by most Jews until\n  this very day. In 359 CE, the Pharisee leader Hillel II established a\n  pre-calculated calendar and ever since the Pharisee Shavuot has always\n  been observed on the 6th of Sivan.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Essenes who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls began the 50-day count to\n  Shavuot on a different Sabbath from the Pharisees. In their reckoning,\n  the Omer offering was to be brought on the morrow of the weekly\n  Sabbath, in modern terms: “Sunday.” The Essenes began their count on\n  the Sunday after the seven-days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. As a\n  result, they always began their count on the 26th day of the First\n  Hebrew Month. The Essenes had a 364-day solar calendar, which began\n  every year on a Wednesday and had fixed lengths for each month. Based\n  on the Essene calendar, Shavuot always fell out on the 15th day of the\n  Third Hebrew Month. The Essenes are presumed to have been wiped out\n  when the Romans invaded Judea in 66-74 CE and only their documents\n  survive today.</p>\n  \n  <p>The third faction, the Sadducees, agreed with the Essenes that Shavuot\n  must be counted from a weekly Sabbath, but disagreed as to which one.\n  The Sadducees believed the 50-day count must begin on the weekly\n  Sabbath that falls out during the seven-days of the Feast of\n  Unleavened Bread. According to their reckoning, the counting towards\n  Shavuot could begin anywhere from the 15th to the 21st day of the\n  month, depending on what day of the week the Feast of Unleavened Bread\n  began. If Unleavened Bread began on a Sunday, the count would begin on\n  the 15th day of the month. If Unleavened Bread began on a Saturday,\n  the count would begin on the 16th day of the month, and so on. Based\n  on this counting, Shavuot could fall out from the 4th to the 12th of\n  the Third Hebrew Month. Karaite Jews have accepted the Sadducee\n  reckoning as the only one to be consistent with the plain meaning of\n  the biblical text.</p>\n  \n  <p>The bigger problem with the Pharisee interpretation of “Sabbath” is\n  when it comes to the end of the 50-day count. Leviticus 23:16 says,</p>\n\n<pre><code>“Until the morrow of the seventh Sabbath shall you count fifty days.”\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>The 1st day day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread could theoretically\n  be called “Sabbath,” even though the Hebrew Bible never uses this\n  terminology. However, the 49th day of the Pharisee counting is not a\n  Sabbath, unless it happens to fall out on a weekly Sabbath - the 7th\n  day of the week. Consequently, the Pharisee Shavuot is rarely the\n  “morrow of the Seventh Sabbath” as required by Leviticus 23:16. About\n  once every seven years, the Pharisee Shavuot does happen to fall out\n  on the “morrow of the seventh Sabbath.” For example, in the year 2018\n  the Feast of Unleavened Bread begins in the Pharisee reckoning at\n  sunset on Friday March 30. In that year, the Pharisee counting begins\n  on Sunday April 1, 2018 and ends 50 days later on the “morrow of the\n  seventh Sabbath,” Sunday May 20, 2018. However, this is the exception\n  to the rule. In most years, Shavuot according to the Pharisee\n  reckoning is actually the morrow of seventh Monday, the morrow of\n  seventh Tuesday, etc. The only way for Shavuot to consistently be the\n  “morrow of the seventh Sabbath” is for the counting to begin on the\n  morrow of a weekly Sabbath, in modern terms on a “Sunday.” Of course,\n  Scripture did not call this a “Sunday,” because that term did not\n  exist in ancient Hebrew. The ancient Hebrew term for Sunday morning is\n  “morrow of the Sabbath.”</p>\n  \n  <p>An important verse that confirms the timing of Shavuot appears in the\n  Book of Joshua:</p>\n\n<pre><code>“And they ate of the produce of the land on the morrow of the Passover, unleavened and parched grain on this very day. And the Manna\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>ceased on the morrow when they ate of the produce of the land...”\n  -Joshua 5:11</p>\n  \n  <p>This verse describes the events surrounding the cessation of the\n  Manna, shortly after the Children of Israel entered the Land of\n  Canaan. To understand this the significance of this verse, we must go\n  back to the Book of the Leviticus, where the Israelites were forbidden\n  to eat of the new crops of the Land of Israel until the day of the\n  Omer offering:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"And bread and parched grain and ripe grain you shall not eat until this very day, until you bring the sacrifice of your God; it\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>shall be an eternal statute for your generations in all your\n  habitations.\" Leviticus 23:14</p>\n  \n  <p>When Joshua 5:11 describes the eating of “unleavened bread and parched\n  grain... on this very day\" it is using almost the precise wording of\n  Leviticus 23:14 “and bread and parched grain... you will not eat until\n  this very day.” The new produce of the land was forbidden until the\n  Omer offering was brought. Joshua 5:11 is saying that when the\n  Israelites entered the Land for the first time, they observed this\n  commandment and waited until the terms of Leviticus 23:14 were\n  fulfilled. In other words, they waited for the Omer offering before\n  eating the grain of Israel. This has been widely recognized by Jewish\n  Bible commentators throughout history, such as the 11th Century rabbi\n  Rashi who explains on Joshua 5:11, “morrow of the Passover is the day\n  of the waving of the omer.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Joshua 5:11 is saying that the first Omer offering in the Land of\n  Israel was brought on the “morrow of the Passover.” Immediately after\n  this, the Children of Israel were permitted to eat of the new crops of\n  the Land. For the first time, the Israelites pulled out their sickles\n  and ate of the good bounty of their new homeland.</p>\n  \n  <p>To understand the phrase “morrow of the Passover” we need to define\n  two terms: “morrow” and “Passover.” The Hebrew word for “morrow” is\n  mi-mocharat which refers to “the morning after.” In the phrase “morrow\n  of the Sabbath” it describes Sunday morning, the morning after the\n  24-hour Sabbath.</p>\n  \n  <p>Today we commonly refer to the Feast of Unleavened Bread as\n  “Passover.” However, in the Hebrew Bible, the term “Passover” (Pesach)\n  always refers to the Pascal sacrifice. The “morrow of the Passover” is\n  the morning after the Passover sacrifice. The sacrifice was\n  slaughtered at twilight at the end of the 14th day of the First Hebrew\n  Month (Nissan) and eaten on the evening that began the 15th day of the\n  First Hebrew Month (see Exodus 12:18; Deuteronomy 16:4). The morrow of\n  the Passover is therefore the morning of the 15th day of the First\n  Hebrew Month.</p>\n  \n  <p>Confirmation of the meaning of the phrase “morrow of the Passover” can\n  be found in a verse in the Book of Numbers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>“And they traveled from Ramesses in the first month on the fifteenth of the month; on the morrow of the Passover the Children of\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Israel went out with a high hand in the eyes of all Egypt.” - Numbers\n  33:3</p>\n  \n  <p>This verse describes the day of the Exodus from Egypt as both the 15th\n  of the First Hebrew Month and as the “morrow of the Passover.”</p>\n  \n  <p>What all this means is that the first Omer offering in Israel took\n  place on the 15th day of the First Hebrew Month. The first year that\n  the Israelites entered Canaan, the 14th of the First Hebrew Month must\n  have fallen out on a Sabbath so that the 15th of that month was a\n  Sunday. In that year, the “morrow of the Passover” happened to also be\n  the “morrow of the Sabbath,” what we call “Sunday morning.” This\n  proves the Pharisee interpretation of Leviticus 23:15 to be wrong.\n  According to the Pharisees, the Omer offering could only be brought on\n  the morning of the 16th of the First Hebrew Month, but in the year\n  that the Israelites entered Canaan, they brought the sacrifice one day\n  earlier.</p>\n  \n  <p>The great 12th Century rabbinical Bible commentator Ibn Ezra mentions\n  a “Roman sage” who brought Joshua 5:11 as proof for the Pharisee\n  interpretation. According to this Roman rabbi, Joshua 5:11 is no less\n  than the silver bullet, the irrefutable proof for the Pharisee\n  position. This Roman rabbi argued that since Passover begins on the\n  15th of the First Hebrew Month (Nissan), the “morrow of the Passover”\n  must be the 16th. This is exactly when the Pharisees believe the Omer\n  offering is supposed to be brought, on the 16th of the First Hebrew\n  Month. If the Israelites brought the Omer on the 16th day of the First\n  Hebrew Month in the year they entered the Land of Israel, argues the\n  Roman rabbi, it proves that the Pharisees are correct in beginning the\n  50-day count to Shavuot on the 16th.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Ibn Ezra, bringing up Joshua 5:11 was a disaster for the\n  Pharisee position:</p>\n\n<pre><code>“[The Roman Rabbi] did not know that it cost him his life, for the Passover is on the fourteenth and its morrow is the fifteenth, and so\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>it is written, “And they traveled from Ramesses in the first month,\n  etc.” (Numbers 33:3). Eating parched grain is forbidden until the\n  waving of the Omer.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Desperate to salvage the situation, Ibn Ezra proposes a novel\n  re-interpretation of Joshua 5:11. Previous rabbis understood this\n  verse to describe the Israelites eating the new grain of the Land of\n  Israel, which only becomes permissible each year after the Omer\n  offering is brought (Leviticus 23:14). The time between harvest and\n  the Omer offering might be anywhere for a few hours to a couple of\n  weeks. During this interim period, the new grain must be stored and\n  only old grain may be eaten, that is, grain from a previous year’s\n  harvest. Since the Israelites were new in the Land of Israel, they did\n  not have any grain from previous years. They had been wandering in the\n  desert eating Manna for 40 years. As soon as they entered the Land,\n  they harvested the grain they found growing in the fields of Jericho.\n  They then waved the Omer, the first sheaf of the harvest, making all\n  their new harvest permissible to eat and began the 50-day count to\n  Shavuot.</p>\n  \n  <p>From Ibn Ezra’s perspective, the Israelites did this one day too\n  early, on the morning of the 15th day of the First Hebrew Month.\n  According to the Pharisees, the Omer must always be brought on the\n  16th day of the First Hebrew Month. Ibn Ezra’s ingenious solution to\n  this embarrassing biblical fact of history is to add the word “old” to\n  Joshua 5:11. If the Israelites ate “old grain,” that is, grain\n  harvested in a previous year, then the verse has nothing to do with\n  the Omer offering or the 50-day count to Shavuot.</p>\n  \n  <p>Ibn Ezra’s new interpretation was highly influential, more than most\n  people realize. When Christian scholars started translating the Bible\n  into English, they went to Jewish rabbis to learn the Hebrew language.\n  When it came to Joshua 5:11, the rabbis told the Christian translators\n  to add the word “old” to the verse. More precisely, they told them\n  that the word “grain,” in Hebrew avur, actually means “old grain.” As\n  a result, Ibn Ezra’s novel interpretation is reflected in the most\n  famous English translation of all time, the King James Version:</p>\n\n<pre><code>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Joshua 5:11 –King James Version</p>\n  \n  <p>Most translations do not employ the Ibn Ezra translation trick of\n  adding the word “old.” This is true for both Christian and Jewish\n  translations. Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n<pre><code>“On the day after the passover, on that very day, they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.” New Revised\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Standard Version</p>\n\n<pre><code>The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.” New\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>International Version</p>\n\n<pre><code>“And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day.”\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Jewish Publication Society 1917</p>\n\n<pre><code>“On the day after the passover offering, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the country, unleavened bread and parched\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>grain.” Jewish Publication Society 1985</p>\n\n<pre><code>“And they ate of the grain of the land on the morrow of the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain on this very day.”\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Judaica Press</p>\n  \n  <p>These translations were made by people who read Hebrew and they knew\n  that the word “old” was simply not there. The Christian translators of\n  the King James Version, on the other hand, did not know this and took\n  someone else’s word for it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Ibn Ezra himself must have known that adding “old” to the verse was\n  not the correct linguistic interpretation. In his introduction to his\n  commentary on the Torah, Ibn Ezra declares that the rules of language\n  and grammar must be bent to fit rabbinical interpretation when it\n  affects practical religious observance. Adding the word “old” to\n  Joshua 5:11 is a clear example of bending the rules of the language.\n  Ibn Ezra reveals his true understanding when he points out in response\n  to the Roman rabbi, “Eating parched grain is forbidden until the\n  waving of the Omer.” He only mentions the “parched grain” from Joshua\n  5:11 and not the “unleavened bread” because he knows it disproves the\n  very thing the Pharisees wanted to prove.</p>\n  \n  <p>“Parched grain,” in Hebrew kali, refers to nearly ripe grain that is\n  still slightly moist. The farmers would harvest this moist grain early\n  and parch it in fire to make it crunchy and delicious. Parched grain\n  could only come from a freshly harvested crop, not from old grain!\n  Joshua 5:11 says the Israelites ate “parched grain” on the morrow of\n  the Passover, on the morning of the 15th day of the First Hebrew\n  Month. The “unleavened bread” could theoretically have come from the\n  old grain, as Ibn Ezra suggested, but the parched grain had to be new\n  grain. Year-old moist grain would go bad, so parched grain could only\n  be “new” grain from that year’s harvest. This new crop would be\n  forbidden to eat until the waving of the Omer, which took place on the\n  “morrow of the Passover,” which Ibn Ezra knew from Numbers 33:3 was\n  the morning of the 15th day of the month. That first year in the Land\n  of Israel, the Israelites ate the new grain and began the 50-day count\n  to Shavuot on the 15th of the First Hebrew Month. This was one day too\n  early for the rabbinical reckoning, which is why Ibn Ezra says that\n  bringing Joshua 5:11 into the discussion of the timing of Shavuot cost\n  the Roman rabbi his life - figuratively speaking, of course.</p>\n  \n  <p>One technical point to consider is that the word “morrow” is the\n  operative term in the phrase the “morrow of the Sabbath.” Joshua 5:11\n  makes it clear that the “morrow” has to be during the seven days of\n  the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The Sabbath itself might actually\n  precede these seven days, as it did that first year the Israelites\n  entered the Land of Israel.</p>\n  \n  <p>In ancient times, the Pharisee Shavuot would coincide with the\n  Biblical Shavuot about once every seven years. This would happen\n  whenever the First Hebrew Month began with the sighting of the new\n  moon on a Friday night. In years such as these, the 16th day of the\n  month would be both the second day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread\n  and the morrow of the weekly Shabbat. The modern rabbinical calendar\n  established by Hillel II in 359 CE calculates the beginning of the\n  month using the dark moon, making this a less common scenario.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.nehemiaswall.com/truth-shavuot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.nehemiaswall.com/truth-shavuot</a></p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara\n  in Moed Katan (20b) writes that a person must mourn together with\n  close relatives (that he would mourn for), meaning that when a father\n  is mourning for his father, the son (and grandson) would also have to\n  mourn (the Gemara cites a dispute concerning which circumstances this\n  applies to). However, many rishonim, including Ramban (Toras Ha’adam\n  40), Rosh (M.K. 3:35), Hagahos Maimonios (Eivel 2:4), write that the\n  reason for this is out of respect for the mourner, and in our days,\n  mourners forgo this oglibation of respect (as brought in Kessef\n  Mishnah, Eivel 2:4). Rashba (1:138) also writes that a grandson need\n  not mourn for his grandfather, but see Terumas Hadeshen (291) who is\n  more stringent (see below).</p>\n  \n  <p>Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De’ah 374:6) rules that a close relative mourns\n  together with his relative (e.g. a son/daughter with his/her father on\n  the grandfather’s passing), whereas Rema cites (from Tur) the custom\n  of leniency in this regard, adding (from Hagahos Maimonios) that\n  anybody who is stringent in this matter is min ha-matmihin\n  (outlandish). Yet, he adds (from Terumas Hadeshen) that some take on\n  “partial mourning,” such as not changing clothes and washing, during\n  the first days of mourning, until the first Shabbos. Shach and Taz\n  cite the ruling of Bach, who writes that a grandson should not go out\n  to meals (and the like) until the first Shabbos after passing.</p>\n  \n  <p>Gesher Hachayim (p. 183) and Chochmas Adam (161:5) rule, in accordance\n  with the above, that a grandson (or other distant relative) is not\n  obligated to mourn together with his close relatives, yet it is\n  customary to take on some practice of mourning, until the first\n  Shabbos.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that Rema adds that it is although it is not obligatory, one who\n  wishes to take on the full mourning together with his close relative\n  is not prevented from doing so.

I love this site.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>If you want to learn about anything, you can't ignore what was said by the experts who came before you. This is especially true in the field of law which depends on logical analysis. Your personal conscience might be satisfied -- indeed, ignorance is bliss -- but you will inevitably be missing innumerable facts and logical nuances. The Talmud is the foundational book laying out the received teachings, arguments and logical analyses of our greatest scholars. Your personal opinion will not -- and should not -- carry much weight if you cannot even humble yourself to become familiar with what it says on the subject.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think we have a related question on this site, which I'll include when I find it.</p>\n\n<p>There's a rather simple answer for your friend. The Talmud could be considered the \"foundation\" of halacha. Almost every later halachic work refers to the Talmud at some point. (I say \"almost\" in the sense that Ramba\"m is a respected halachic authority but he is known, generally, for not citing his sources.) So, it is always better to view the source of something.</p>\n\n<p>The other reason to study Talmud is because it is far more than a halachic book or journal. The argumentative style of the Talmud, I have found, is extremely helpful in teaching a person thinking skills and such skills are an incredibly important life skill as a person matures. Thus, it is best to start learning Talmud at a young age. However, even people who have begun studying Talmud in their 60's and 70's have benefitted from the argumentative thinking. I've personally seen this change in many people, and I'm sure there's enough research evidence to prove this, as well. (I'd be curious if anyone found that Talmudic study could hold off Altzheimers.)</p>\n\n<p>As for your friend's saying, \"it is just these people's opinions\", no it is not just an \"opinion\". If you look at the structure of the Talmud, it's an <strong>analysis</strong>, not an opinion. Rarely, does the Talmud state a rabbi's view and leave it at that without explaining why he arrived at that view. And, inevitably, the reasoning is challenged, sometimes by a contradictory statement the same rabbi said elsewhere! So, it's definitely not just a person's opinion. It's a carefully derived analysis, which, at the end, may not even be \"valid\". That's why you would need to see the Talmud to see both what and why they arrived at the conclusion. You wouldn't get this from just the Mishnah.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing wrong with coming up with your own conclusions, and, in a sense, that's encouraged in Torah study. But, you cannot use your own conclusions to decide halachic matters unless your a rabbi. And, even within that, there are guidelines.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I know the person probably wont be satisfied with this answer <em>but</em> ... </p>\n\n<p>The reason we learn Gemara (talmud) is because it is part of the chiyuv talmud torah (positive commandment to study Torah). Only after that is clear should we come up with explanations as to what we gain from it. This rule applies to most things in Judaism.</p>\n\n<p><em>Now...</em></p>\n\n<p>The Gemara (talmud) says that one who learns halacha (final rulings) without the Gemara behind it will lack in Yirat Shomayim (fear of God).</p>\n\n<p>Also, because not everything is codified in Sifrei Halacha, one must understand the reasoning behind the rulings so that he or she (or most commonly, their Rav) can know what to do in a situation where there is no clear cut ruling. This is usually what the Poskim do in Shut sefarim (books of Q&A).</p>\n\n<p>The process starts with learning Gemara. Afterwards one learns the sifrei halacha and tries to understand how they  (the poskim) learnt the sugya (topic). At this point the learner should have somewhat of an understanding in the underlying reasons for the Dinim (rulings) in question, and as above will know how to apply them to a unique situation. </p>\n\n\n",

However, it seems like viewing eyes may be מותר, from the גמרא in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.75a.2?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 75a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב יהודה אמר רב מעשה באדם אחד שנתן עיניו באשה אחת והעלה לבו טינא ובאו ושאלו לרופאים - Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rav: There was a case with a certain man who gave away his eyes to a certain lady, and his heart filled with jealousy (i.e. he regretted giving his eyes away), and they came and lent [the eyes] to the doctors. (presumably to study them.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This גמרא is difficult, because during the time that the eyes were in the custody of the doctors, they must have been looking at them! How does this fit with the גמרא that says it is אסור to view eyes?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is found in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Avodah_Zarah.9b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Avoda Zarah 9b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רופא אומן מותר - [for a] skilled doctor it is permitted (to view eyes).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The whole issue of מארית עין is that a person viewing the eyes may become tempted touch them because of their beauty (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.74a.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 74a</a> - עין יפה - an eye is beautiful), and thereby damage them. Therefore, חזל instituted the תקנה that people should avoid looking at eyes. But for a skilled doctor, who is both able to look at eyes without ending up touching them, and can touch eyes without damaging them, חזל was lenient, at least specifically for healing purposes. </p>\n\n<p>This is the reason for why the doctors mentioned in Sanhedrin were able to have the eyes in their custody. They did not only intend to study the eyes, but also to determine if it was possible to return them to the man who had donated them.</p>\n\n<p>So in your case, it is indeed מותר for an optometrist to view your eyes; however for a regular person it will be אסור.</p>\n\n\n",

Why is it that people say \"The Rambam says x, but Rashi says y\"? </p>\n\n<p>(Same is true for the Ramban, the Meiri, the Mordechai, the Rashbam, the Rosh etc. vs. Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, Rabbeinu Yona, Tosafos)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is pure conjecture (but I think any answer to this question will be conjecture) but perhaps the difference between Rashi/Tosafos and all other rishonim (not counting rishonim who are called \"Rabbeinu\" as there it would be quite strange to say \"the Rabbeinu\") lies in how people were studying.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine they are studying the Talmud. Someone wants to bring up R. Solomon Ben Aderet. He can say \"the Rashba says\" and quote the Rashba and everything will be fine. The same goes for other rishonim. However, when studying the Talmud, Rashi and Tosafos are not separate from the Talmud like other rishonim are. The Talmudic page is Talmud, Rashi, and Tosafos. Now if someone wants to refer to Rashi or Tosafos generally (in the same way as the earlier example referenced R. Solomon Ben Aderet) there is perhaps potential for an issue. If someone says \"the Rashi\" or the \"the Tosafos\" it may seem as if he is referring to a specific Rashi or Tosafos on the page. Thus, leaving out the word \"the\" indicates that you are referring to Rashi and Tosafos in general and not to a specific text on the page. (Indeed, when they are specifying a specific Rashi or Tosafos text they <strong>will</strong> use the word \"the\", e.g. \"the second-to-last Tosafos asks this\" or \"the Rashi we just read\".) This issue does not exist for the other rishonim because the other rishonim are not part of the Talmudic page.</p>\n\n<p>(Note that I think there is a sociological element here as well; it seems to me that it is really the \"yeshivish\" groups that refer to other rishonim with the word \"the\", whereas academics and those identifying with intellectual Modern Orthodoxy tend to not use \"the\" for anyone. For example, if you read the Torah U'madda Journal, or Tradition, or similar publications, I think you will find that they primarily write \"Rambam\" and not \"the Rambam\".)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Shout out to @Efraim and @AlBerko for their sevaros.

Adding \"the\" before the title of a name may be a way of referring to something written (such as a book), or that it originally stood for Harav X.  </p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of other Rishonim referring to the Rambam as \"Rambam\" rather than Harambam:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tosfos Rid Nedarim 17a</li>\n<li>Ran Rosh Hashana 20b</li>\n<li>Mordechai Kesubos Remez 154 (47a)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Many more examples can be found from various religious authorities over time, and the same is true (although to a lesser extent) to referring to Rashi as Harashi.

The footnote said to reference page x in a book called ‘Obermeyer’ I didn’t know what that was so I tried to look it up.

This is indeed a correct reference as the footnote cites:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בדיתא לובי i.e., the canal Baditha near Luba on the northern Euphrates, v. Obermeyer, p. 311.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The original German on page 311 is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Der Nahr al-Badāt ist zweifellos mit dem Moed Katan 11a verzeichneten Baditha identisch. Hier wird nämlich tradiert: Der Kanal Baditha Lubaï (בדיתא לבאי), d. h. bei der Ortschaft Luba, war derart fischreich, daß “alle Welt” dorthin ging, um Fische zu fangen, auch an den Feiertagen oder gerade an solchen, wo andere Arbeiten außer der Herbeischaffung und Zubereitung von Nahrungsmitteln für den betreffenden Tag verboten sind (S. 2 M. 12, 16).</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Daß der arabische Nahr al Badāt mit dem talmudischen בדיתא לבאי identisch ist, beweist insbesondere dessen Beiname לבאי. Das ist eine Ortschaft, die sich in derselben Gegend befunden hat, wie der oben bei Ibn Serapion verzeichnete Unterlauf des Nahr al Badāt. “Lauba (לובא)”, schreibt Jakut s. v., “ist ein Ort in Irak, im Sawād von Kaškar, zwischen Wașiț und den Bațāïh”. Dieser Ort lag demnach am Nordrande der Euphratsümpfe zwischen der Ebene von Kaškar-Wașiț und der von Kufa. Diese sog. Bațāīḥ (Sumpfegebiete) waren außerordentlich reich an Fischen (s. Ibn Roste 94), insbesondere (s. Kazwini II, 299) an einer Fischgattung, der auch Šabbat 119a genannten Šabuț, die sehr groß sind und noch heutigen Tages unter diesem Namen in Bagdad stückweise nach Gewicht verkauft werden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The body of water known in Arabic as Nahr al-Badaat is undoubtedly the same as the one mentioned in Moed Katan 11a. This is the traditional description: The channel Badita Lubai (בדיתא לבאי), which literally means ‘by the town of Lubai’, was so well known for its large quantities of fish that everyone would go there to satisfy all of their fishing needs. Even on holidays or especially on such days where any work beyond the collection and preparation of food is prohibited.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The Arabic name Nahr al Badaat is synonymous with the Talmudic בדיתא לבאי. This is particually demonstrated by the nickname לבאי, which is a village located in the same place, as quoted above in Ibn Serapion, the lower reaches of Nahr al Badaat. Yaqut writes: “Lauba (לובא) is a place in Iraq, in Sawaad of Kashkar between Wasit and the Bataaih”. It is therefore located on the northern edge of the Euphrates marshes between the planes of Kashkar-Wasit and Kufa. The so called Bataaih (swamp areas) are extraordinarily rich with fish (see <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bibliothecageogr07goej/page/n100\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Roste 94</a> line 8), in particular (see Kazwini II 299) a fish species which is also mentioned in Shabbat 119a ‘Shibuta’ (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48236&st=&pgnum=13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שיבוטא</a>), which is a very large type of fish still sold in Baghdad nowadays in pieces by weight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A list of 74 libraries with the book can be found <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/landschaft-babylonien-im-zeitalter-des-talmuds-und-des-gaonats-geographie-und-geschichte-nach-talmudischen-arabischen-und-andern-quellen/oclc/5824015\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=vr0LAAAAIAAJ&dq=editions:-oS4im2GO-gC&hl=iw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google Books</a> has the book in snippet view.

In the game, the titular plumber must travel the world to chase Bowser to prevent his marriage to Princess Peach, alongside his new sidekick Cappy.</p>\n<p>One of the places he visits is called the <a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Luncheon_Kingdom\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Luncheon Kingdom</a>, an Italy-inspired food-themed land. The Kingdom is known best for its <a href=\"https://www.mariowiki.com/Stupendous_Stew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Stupendous Stew</a>, a vegetable dish which, when Mario first reaches it, can be seen to have contained both several blocks of cheese and a slab of meat.</p>\n<p>Is there an issue of benefiting of Basar B'chalav by playing this game? What about if you play the game, but you never complete that particular level, so that the meat is never put into the pot?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This is absolutely amazing.  The Ralbag (Devarim 3:1, Toaliyos) says that a person will receive a punishment for playing Mario, and if one doesn't realize that he was hit for playing Mario, he will not accept Mussar for anything:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>התועלת השביעי הוא במידות, <strong>והוא להודיע שהוא ראוי למי (שישיגהו)[שהשיגהו] עונש מהשם יתעלה על מריו</strong>, שיראה שהוא מרגיש שיעור מה שאבד ממנו, כי בזה תועלת ללקיחת המוסר. <strong>כי מי שלא ירגיש שהוכה על מריו לא יקבל מוסר</strong>, כמו שאמר הנביא על מה תוכו עוד תוסיפו סרה וגו׳. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly, it is considered Hanaah from Basar Bechalav, and is a very serious Issur.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It still may be comparable to eating at seudas achashverosh.

This is there, because it is following on the heels of other halachos related to how we treat non-Jews. In siman 160, the Tur starts by saying</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבית הואיל ואתא לידן נימא ביה מלתא</p>\n<p>As long as we've mentioned interest, let's talk about it a little bit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both the Bach and the Perisha on that line comment that the Tur is explaining why the laws of interest are here, when seemingly they should be elsewhere, among the other monetary laws. The Bach points out that the Talmud put the laws of interest in Bava Metzia, amidst other monetary laws, and the Rambam put it in the laws of lending and borrowing, and the Tur wishes to explain why he didn't do so.</p>\n<p>The words of the Perisha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רצונו לומר ... הוה ליה לסדר הלכות רבית בחושן משפט בין דיני ממונות</p>\n<p>He means to explain ... that he should have arranged the laws of interest in Choshen Mishpat among the monetary laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the reason it is here is because it was mentioned, and now we're going off onto a tangent into the rest of the laws of interest.</p>\n<p>Shulchan Aruch is merely following the Tur's model, as he does in all of Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://eretzhemdah.org/newsletterArticle.asp?lang=en&pageid=48&cat=7&newsletter=286&article=1045\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for an interesting point on this.

From 45:10 it seems they also had their own flock. </p>\n\n<p>From different verses like Shemot 8:22 we know the people still lived in this region at the time of the Exodus. </p>\n\n<p>Verse 1:14 suggests that they were working in construction because they had to work hard/severe through working with stones of mud and straw, and that they were employed as farmers in agriculture and perhaps also livestock, since they had to do heavy work on land and in the field. </p>\n\n<p>So here's my question, since they were freed from the bondage, opressions or burdens from Egypt, but also from the fact that some people still longed back to it I became to wonder what kind of life they had and how they lived in Egypt;</p>\n\n<p>Did they lived like most slaves at the time (and were kept) in an organized context (encampment); in their own area in small mud houses close to their area of ​​work? Or did they lived a seperate or independt life of some sort, like other lower social classes did and most often were explioted, suppressed and supposed to do the dirty and heavy work and punished if they couldn't pay the high taxes or produce enough, or punished as foreign slaves were not allowed to do much reproduction, because if they would become to many it would be threatening the Egyptian culture and livestyle. </p>\n\n<p>So are there any commentaries which explain how they could live in Goshen in their own houses (with maybe some flock) while still being slaves or mistreated? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>While the Jews did live in Goshen, that was where their families lived and where they lived on Shabbos (after Moshe Rabbeinu convinced Paroh that they needed one day off a week <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shemot_Rabbah.1.28?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see shemos rabbah 1-38 and 5-8 </a>). However, during the entire week the men were forced to sleep in the ditches on the sides of the fields where they worked, as their taskmasters claimed that it would take too much time to allow them to go back to their houses and return in the morning (and therefore they would stop the population from growing (at least before they had Shabbos off). Therefore, their wives had to come to them, in the ditches of the fields, in order to be able to have children - בזכות נשים צדקניות נגעלו אבותינו ממצרים). </p>\n\n<p>Being a slave did not mean that you were unable to own property, rather it meant that you were forced to work, without wages, for however much time any Mitzri demanded (as well as doing your normal work to support yourself and your family; the Mitzrim didn't pay them anything). Therefore, they were able to own houses, however cramped, and own sheep (which the Mitzrim didn't want anyway).</p>\n\n<p>In regards to the Jews owning slaves, the Ohr Sameach says that this refers to those tribes which were not slaves themselves (Levi, and possibly Reuvein and Shimon ans well according to the Yerushalmi), who owned non-Jewish slaves, and possibly even bought the right to have Jewish slaves as well.</p>\n\n\n",

To the best of my knowledge most traditional halakhic authorities clearly state that “good-deed” is not an accurate translation of mitzvah. Commandment is. It seems to me, however, that my understanding is wrong and the concept of mitzvah has indeed changed over time to include a wider range of behaviors such as “good-deeds”. </p>\n\n<p>I have heard actions such as, for example, a child cleaning up their toys, paying a shiva-call, giving a lift to a friend, being texted to help make a minyan, loaning a sweater to someone going out on a date, allowing someone to use your cell to make a call while theirs is recharging, etc., etc., all being referred to as mitzvahs. Am I being too literal or are such behaviors actually mitzvahs? Does context matter?</p>\n\n<p>It just seems to me——although I admittedly cannot prove it——that far too many people these days over use the term mitzvah when describing a rather ordinary act or to guilt someone into doing something for them; oh, please do this favor for me, it’ll be a mitzvah. Is this perhaps a reflection of society as a whole where grade-inflation, political-correctness, etc. is en vogue? Could it be misleading to make people think they are accumulating so many mitzvahs when they are simply doing the right thing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The word mitzvah means commandment. However, there is a commandment to do kindness for others, and to emulate G-d in his selfless giving to humankind. Therefore, it is not much of a stretch to call any kindness a mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>That said, one probably shouldn't call anything other than an actual commandment a mitzvah, as it causes people to equate actual commandments with other things. So I wouldn't call them mitzvos, but they aren't technically wrong (except for maybe having a child clean up his toys if it is not for the sake of the Sabbath, etc. Having him share them, though, is another story.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although there are 613 commands, mitzvahs, an act that serves as pro hac fulfillment of one of those commands is also (in my experience) colloquially called a mitzvah. Thus, the command is to wear tefillin; wearing them each time is considered doing a mitzvah even though \"doing a command\" makes no sense. Likewise, there's a command to revere one's parents; each time one restrains himself from contradicting his parent, he's said to be doing a mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

Achai answered.</p>\n\n<p>There is a discussion in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosafot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos</a> as to the identity of R. Achai. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashbam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a> claims that this is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achai_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Achai Gaon</a>, the author of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achai_Gaon#A%E1%B8%A5a's_Sheiltot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sheiltos</a>, and because he lived after all the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoraim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">amoraim</a> he always has a different word associated with him such as פריך רב אחאי or פשיט רב אחאי.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbeinu_Tam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Tam</a> rejects the view of Rashbam, and offers a different reason for the unique words associated with R. Achai. He asserts that every amora had their own unique words so the fact that R. Achai also had  unique words does not indicate that he was not a regular amora. Rabbeinu Tam provides three examples of words unique to specific amoraim 1) מגדף בה ר' אבהו (3 תהי בה ר' יוחנן (2 לייט עלה אביי.</p>\n\n<p>The question is: is all this talk about unique words actually true?</p>\n\n<p>There are in fact 9 places in the Talmud where a point is introduced with פריך and in all 9 cases the person doing the פריך is R. Achai/Acha. (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=24&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 24a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=46&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 46a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=47&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 47a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=13&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 13a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=26&daf=41b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shavuos 41b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=29&daf=102b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 102b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 65b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=32&daf=6&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechoros 6a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=33&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 33a</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>However, פשיט is only used once in reference to R. Achai (our case under discussion), while it is used on several occasions for other amoraim (though granted not in the precise format of פשיט רב פלוני).</p>\n\n<p>While תהי בה is indeed used for R. Yochanan more often than for other amoraim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=107b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 107b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=55b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 55b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=21&daf=112b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 112b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=39&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 39a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=32&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechoros 42b</a>,)  it is still used for a whole bunch of amoraim, such as R. Zera (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=38b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 38b</a>), Reish Lakish (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=29&daf=13b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 13b</a>), R. Elazar (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=66&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 66a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=21&daf=76b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 76b</a>), such that it is a bit of a stretch to call it R. Yochanan's unique lashon. In fact, in the parallel passage in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosafot#Tosafot_ha-Rosh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos HaRosh</a> one of the examples given of unique words is תהי בה ר' זירא!</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the term מגדף בה is used most often for R. Abahu (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=62b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 62b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=3b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 3b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=40b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 40b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=29&daf=12&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 12a</a>) but it is also used for R. Yirmiyah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=35&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 35a</a>) and R. Chanina (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=43&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 43a</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the term לייט עלה is used primarily for Abbaye (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=29&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 29a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=120b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 120b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=104&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 104a</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=29b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 29b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=12&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moed Katan 12b</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=33b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 33b</a>)  but it is also used for Rav (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=120b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 120b</a>). If we include other variations (such as לייט אמאן) we can include several others as well (e.g. R. Yehoshua Ben Levi, R. Chisda).</p>\n\n<p>While it is possible that Rabbeinu Tam meant not that these words were unique to these amoraim, but that these amoraim always used these words, it would still be a stretch because each of these amoraim only use their specific words a few times in the entire Talmud (aside from פריך רב אחאי/אחא which is used 9 times).</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the phrasing employed by Rabbeinu Tam וכל אמורא היה תופס לשונו implies that each amora chose his unique word. However, the unique words in question are all verbs describing actions taken by the amoraim. Therefore the amoraim were not using these words themselves; rather, the redactors of the Talmud chose to use certain words to describe the actions of certain amoraim. </p>\n\n<p>If we grant that it was the redactors that chose the unique words we have another problem: if, in accordance with the theory of Rabbeinu Tam, these unique words were used deliberately for specific amoraim, why did the redactors sabotage their goal by also using the same words for other amoraim once in a while?</p>\n\n<p>(I have not found any subsequent sources that deal with this issue.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>(I am prepared for all of the downvotes this might get me...)</p>\n\n<p>In my understanding of Rabbeinu Tam, this is a non-issue.  Rabbeinu Tam rejects Rashbam's opinion because Rav Ashi answers Rav Achai in Kesubos.  Finished.</p>\n\n<p>Once that is the case, Rabbeinu Tam must come up with some explanation as to why Rav Achai always appears using the terms of Parich/Pashit.  To this, Rabbeinu Tam notes that it is common among some Amoraim that they often appear \"linked\" to a particular wording (regardless of whether or not this was by their design or by the design of whatever redactors had added), such as לייט עלה, מגדף בה, etc.  <strong>It's not that Rabbeinu Tam is stating a rule that particular Leshonos are unique to an Amora</strong>, but rather, <strong>Rabbeinu Tam is simply providing a framework within which having an Amora (i.e. Rav Achai) use the same Lashon (i.e. Parich) many of the times that he appears in Talmud Bavli is not a big problem that needs to be explained</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>Note that due to to the number of other places in Shas (thank you Robev for Kesubos 10a!, see also Chulin 59b, Bechoros 5a) where Rav Achai is mentioned or speaks without \"Parich\" or \"Pashit\", I believe that Rashbam must hold that that there was also an Amora named Rav Achai, whereas for Rabbeinu Tam, this is just like any of the Amoraim mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Rabbeinu Tam is correct in this assertion.  This is also why it is inconsequential that Tosfos HaRosh change an Amora, and that exceptions appear for all of these.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  I found this discussed <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=PMwOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP25&lpg=PP25&dq=%22%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A1%20%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%22&source=bl&ots=ps3mj_O6OF&sig=E4FQuuK1H_YgDMvDdh7F1wHKR3M&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjC9tHktrLZAhVC4oMKHbE9C70Q6AEIUDAI#v=onepage&q=%22%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A1%20%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%22&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/21132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Lev Shomea</a> by Chaim Hakohen of Tripoli).  He quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zvi Hirsch Chajes</a> to Nazir 51b, who says that Rabbeinu Tam clearly did not intend to note that these Leshonos were unique to a particular Amora, but simply that a specific Amora often \"used\" one in particular.  Hopefully this helps support my case.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: This also seems to be what Rabbeinu Tam is saying, based on the wording of Tosfos Harosh there (thanks Alex!), who makes it seem much lighter, and no \"rule\" of \"Amora Tofes Leshono\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומצינו באמוראין שהיה לשונם משונה זה מזה תהי בה ר' זירא מגדף בה ר' אבהו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The author of Sheilas Shalom on Sheiltos gives this issue an adequate <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19335&st=&pgnum=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dissertation</a>. He establishes Rashbam’s opinion that this is indeed the Rav Achai of the Savorai, which was added in after the sealing of the Talmud.  He deflects Rabeinu Tams logic (cf. Tosafos, Zevachim 102b, s.v. parich) by pointing out that the same order is found in Nidah (33a), where Rav Asi, an earlier figure, also answers Rav Achai’s question. He explains based on Tosafos (Chulin, s.v. anah) that the question was already asked in the earlier Amoraic times, but it was also asked later by Rav Achai. Read further for more discussion. </p>\n\n<p>This is also the apparent opinion of Maharatz Chajas in Mavo Hatalmud (31). </p>\n\n<p>Rabeinu Tam’s rule is thus no longer valid, because the only reason that Rav Achai has his own word is indeed because it was added in later, as Rashbam notes. </p>\n\n<p>As far as the rule then stated regarding specific phraseology among Amoraic statements, it is possible to now decrease the intensity in which Rabeinu Tam was quoted, and to say that he was only quoting analogous examples to explain his position on Rav Achai. However, he would perhaps concede. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/j97ZR.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/j97ZR.jpg\" alt=\"photo\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

Does it actually say that anywhere?  I want to know what, if anything, their text is based on:</p>\n\n<p>\"There he made his home in a town called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, “He will be called a Nazarene.\" (Matthew 2:23)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The answer is that there is no prophecy in the entire Tanach which foretells that a prophet should come from Nazareth, or that the Messiah should be called a \"Nazarene\". Christians throughout the ages have tried reconciling the fact that Matthew's Gospel claims that there is a reference in the prophets to this, but there is not. Even Christian Bibles do not print a reference to this \"claim\". The simple answer is that the reference cannot be found at all within the Jewish Scriptures. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it is not a requirement in Judaism that the Messiah come from Nazareth, nor that he be called a \"Nazarene\". (Which I'm not sure what the Christian Bible means by this.)</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that questions such as this one in the future might not be within scope of the site. </p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/89593/11486\">heshy's answer</a>, the Ramban, whom you've named yourself after on this site, was famous for his debates with the Christian authorities at the time, defending Judaism and explaining why Yeshu cannot be the Messiah.

However, based on the third-person paraphrase that the Torah gives (Numbers 11:26), we can reconstruct their chant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתָּ֧נַח עֲלֵהֶ֣ם הָר֗וּחַ</p>\n<p>Ruach has rested upon us, yes it did! Ruach has rested upon us, how 'bout you?<sup>$</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Moses' response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמִ֨י יִתֵּ֜ן כָּל־עַ֤ם יְהוָה֙ נְבִיאִ֔ים כִּֽי־יִתֵּ֧ן יְהוָ֛ה אֶת־רוּח֖וֹ עֲלֵיהֶֽם</p>\n<p>Would that God would give his ruach upon all of the nation of God, would that he would! Would that he would give his ruach upon all of the nation of God, how 'bout you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The chant was passed from generation to generation until the reign of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, when Isaiah (61:1) and Micah (3:8) also engaged in the chant with each other:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר֛וּחַ אֲדֹנָ֥י יְהוִ֖ה עָלָ֑י יַ֡עַן מָשַׁח֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֹתִ֜י לְבַשֵּׂ֣ר עֲנָוִ֗ים שְׁלָחַ֨נִי֙ לַֽחֲבֹ֣שׁ לְנִשְׁבְּרֵי־לֵ֔ב לִקְרֹ֤א לִשְׁבוּיִם֙ דְּר֔וֹר וְלַֽאֲסוּרִ֖ים פְּקַח־קֽוֹחַ</p>\n<p>The ruach of my Lord God is upon me, yes it is! The ruach of my Lord God is upon me because God anointed me to announce to the humble, sent me to bandage the broken of heart, to call freedom to captives, and opening up to the bound,<sup>%</sup> how 'bout you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To which Micah responded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאוּלָ֗ם אָֽנֹכִ֞י מָלֵ֤אתִי כֹ֨חַ֙ אֶת־ר֣וּחַ יְהוָ֔ה וּמִשְׁפָּ֖ט וּגְבוּרָ֑ה</p>\n<p>Well, I am full of the strength of God's ruach and judgment and strength, yes I am! I am full of the strength of God's ruach and judgment and strength, how 'bout you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus we see that chants about ruach have existed since we first became a nation, and have evolved ever since. They probably first came about after the Exodus. In Egypt, the Children of Israel suffered from קֹּצֶר רוּחַ, lack of ruach (Exodus 6:9). But ever since God blew his ruach (נָשַׁפְתָּ בְרוּחֲךָ֖) at the splitting of the sea, the Israelites were proud of their salvation and their attainment of ruach. Of course, being Jews, they choose to demonstrate this by arguing.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sub>$) The phrases \"yes it did\" and \"how 'bout you\" are reconstructed from the descendant chants for complex metrical reasons.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>%) Isaiah's chant continues for another two verses. Opinions differ regarding whether he said all of them at once, or if he alternated between the different reasons. Seeing as he managed to write 66 chapters, the first possibility is not to be discounted.</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The chant is primarily used at gatherings such as stadiums, parks, trips, etc. While the camps justify these outings as necessary for the well-being of the campers, they still know that this is something that God does not really approve of. (See e.g. Maharsha Shabbos 119b.) Therefore whenever these events take place, the camps issue a disclaimer that God is not with them. This is done by declaring that they have ruach, because as we know from Kings 19:11 God is not present in ruach ('לא ברוח ה).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Camp chants evolve; I'm glad to take this opportunity to provide you with original words of this one, as written by the great kabbalist and liturgical poet <em>Rav Yisrael Gershovitz</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've got Nefesh!<br />\nI've got Ruach!<br />\nI've got Nshama!<br />\nWho could ask for anything more?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We all, then, have Ruach. We also have Nefesh, which is also called Ruach Habhamis, animalistic Ruach, and Nshama, the highest of all. The verse from Ecclesiastes (that you quoted in part) details:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִי יוֹדֵעַ רוּחַ בְּנֵי הָאָדָם הָעֹלָה הִיא לְמָעְלָה וְרוּחַ הַבְּהֵמָה הַיֹּרֶדֶת הִיא לְמַטָּה לָאָרֶץ.‏‏</p>\n<p>Who knows Ruach of people? It rises up. And animalistic Ruach? It sinks to earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the sabbath, we have an extra Nshama, two in all; the extra one is also called Shabas Malksa, the sabbath queen. In honor of this, <em>Rav Yisrael</em> wrote an additional chant for the sabbath:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shabas, you is my queen now.<br />\nYou is, you is!<br />\nAnd I must laugh and sing and dance as two instead of one.…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He is a figure of the Christian Bible.</p>\n\n<p>There is, however, an old Jewish tradition that Elijah will come to prepare the way for the Messiah. This is mentioned in Malachi 3:23 (\"Behold, I send unto you Elijah the Prophet\") and in the Talmud as well (Eiruvin 43b). </p>\n\n<p>Most likely, the writers of the Christian Bible knew of this tradition and therefore sought for a way to make it work with the life of Jesus, in attempts to \"prove further\" his status as Messiah. Since Elijah the Prophet did not come before Jesus to announce him as the Messiah, they had to say that John the Baptist did this job as a reincarnation of Elijah.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, in John 1:21 in the Christian Bible, John the Baptist replies \"no\" to the question of whether he is Elijah the Prophet or not. So there is a contradiction between this and Matthew 11:13-14 and 17:12, where Jesus says on two occasions that John <em>was</em> Elijah.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, Rambam  makes it clear that Elijah coming before the Messiah is not necessarily a requirement of the Messianic Age (Hilchot Melachim 12:2), although most Sages maintain it is. Despite what Rambam says, though, the idea that Elijah's coming will proceed the coming of the Messiah is a widespread tradition in Jewish circles.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>No. The entirety of the 5 books of Moses does not mention Elijah the prophet.

    "content": "# Can one be compelled to testify?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can a witness be compelled to testify?  The Torah says you must testify [Lev. 5:1] but the Talmud says punishment for not doing so can only come from God [Bava Kamma 55b]. You may not want to testify because you don't want to lose valuable work time, or because you are afraid of the consequences (threats of harm, ostracism from litigant or community, loss of livelihood etc.), or simply because you don't want your past probed and your private life dragged in the open for cross-examination, etc.  In civil law, you can be subpoenaed (summoned to court) to testify in court and jailed if you refuse. But what about in halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The only way to be sure <em>Lehalacha</em> that a man is withholding testimony is if 2 <em>Eidim</em> (witnesses) were to witness that this person (or these 2 people) saw the occurrence, and they can only be sure he saw the occurrence by seeing the occurrence themselves at the same time. So there would be no point compelling the \"withholder\" to testify, as those witnesses could just give <em>Eidus</em> (testimony) themselves, we only need as תרי כמאה-  <em>eidus</em> of 2 people is the same as 100 people (Shavuos 42a).</p>\n\n<p>If their are no <em>eidim</em> that saw the \"withholder\" see the occurrence, we cannot force him to testify as there is no halachic proof he was there, the litigant is biased and we don't trust his word. However the litigant can <em>Mashbia</em> (force the \"withholder\" to swear) a \"witness' oath\" - שבועת העדות on the \"withholder\" (as the questioner correctly quotes from Vayikra 5) that he saw nothing, and we have no choice but to believe him. If he lied under oath and later admits, he would bring a <em>korban oleh veyored</em>. (Shavuos 30a). If he swears falsely does not admit see Gittin 35a that False Oaths causes ones children to die. But we believe him as he is innocent until proven guilty.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While not a direct proof, there is perhaps some roundabout evidence from the Talmud in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=12b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 12b</a>. The Talmud there had been discussing at length the possibility of witnesses mistaking the times that they are testifying about. According to various suggestions for what level of mistakes we would be concerned about (e.g. being off by an hour) the Talmud asks why the rules for eating chametz on on the day before Passover do not follow the same assumptions (that people will only mistake the time of day to the same degree as in testimony). The Talmud answers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר אביי עדות מסורה לזריזים חמץ לכל מסור</p>\n<p>Said Abaye: Testimony is committed to careful men, [whereas] leaven is\ncommitted to all.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Pesachim.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין אדם בא להעיד על הנפש אא\"כ בקי בשעות לפי שיודע הוא שסופו להדרש בדרישה וחקירה אבל חמץ על הכל מוטל ושאינו בקי בשעות טועה בהן</p>\n<p>A person does not come to testify on [matters of] life unless he is expert in hours, because he knows that he will end up being cross-examined. But chametz  is incumbent on everyone, and one who is not an expert in hours will make a mistake with them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now if testimony could be compelled, then how would we know that only experts are testifying? Perhaps the compelled witness was not an expert? If, however, testimony could not be compelled then the assumption that the witness is an expert would hold up.</p>\n\n\n",

I thought the tediousness and arbitrtariness, and the fact that\nit was a waste of time, were just common traits of all religion.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>It took a year in college, and a stint as bookkeeper for the Secular\nFreedom Alliance of Sacramento (SFAS), for Melanie to realize that not\nonly were some people not Reform, but they were not in any organized\nreligion at all: \"<strong>I suddenly realized that I could just stay home on\nSaturday morning and watch TV, and no one would arrest me for not\ngoing to the synagogue. I hadn't put that together before.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>Once she did, Melanie watched the fall seasons of no fewer than\nthirty-six of her favorite shows, sometimes staying up late into\nSunday morning to finish watching all the shows she had recorded to\nDVR. \"<strong>It was so liberating</strong>,\" Melanie said. \"<strong>I didn't only watch\n'my' shows -- I discovered new ones. <em>Dance Moms</em> and <em>Jerry Springer</em>\n-- and that channel that advertises timeshares.</strong>\" In addition to buying a timeshare, Melanie gained thirty pounds and \"<strong>enjoyed every\nbite</strong>\" because of a lingering belief from organized religion that \"calories don't count\" on Saturday. \"<strong>Plus, it was delicious,</strong>\" she adds.</p>\n<p>This and other bizarre beliefs were replaced by a new lease on life\nshe calls the \"Live until you die\" approach: \"<strong>It's basically that\nwhile people are alive, they're alive, and nothing can change that. So\nthey might as well do whatever, because of the thing I just said, you\nknow?</strong>\" Melanie explains thoughtfully, sliding the twined and trussed\npig into the oven. \"<strong>It just makes a lot of sense when you think\nabout it.</strong>\"</p>\n<p><strong>==A CULTURE OF CONFUSION==</strong></p>\n<p>Injury. Loss of money. Severe, even debilitating illness (nisht\ngedacht). These are just some of the ordeals faced by the members of\nthe Reform Jewish movement. Increasing numbers of disillusioned former\nmembers link these disasters to the \"<strong>contradictory and frankly\nconfusing</strong>\" faith which they are encouraged by the Movement to adopt.</p>\n<p>\"<strong>You are required to believe in this thing they call the\n'G-d-idea,'</strong>\" reports former member Amy Smith. \"<strong>It doesn't make\nsense. No one even knows what those words mean.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>\"<strong>We sometimes had to say long, complicated prayers that referred to\narcane rituals like animal sacrifice,</strong>\" describes an ex-member, Tim,\nwho now suffers from occasional \"<strong>bizarre dreams in which his own\npets are being sacrificed.</strong>\" Tim sees a therapist, but \"<strong>[The\ndreams] just won't go away. One night I dreamed it was my goldfish.\nSeveral months later I dreamed it was my sister's pet hamster--a\ngerbil, really.</strong>\"</p>\n<p><strong>==\"WHO THAT GUY WAS, I COULD NOT TELL YOU\"==</strong></p>\n<p>That confusion reflects the state of mind of many Reform members.\n\"<strong>For some reason, in the Reform temple, we were always hearing about\nGandhi,</strong>\" said‎ Hirsch. \"<strong>It had to do with world peace or\nsomething. But, I mean, was he even Jewish?</strong>\" Hirsch shakes her head.\n\"<strong>And then there's Martin Luther King.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>\"<strong>Some of the stuff seemed pretty made up,</strong>\" muses Smith.</p>\n<p>Children of serious members of the Movement are coerced into attending\na so-called \"Hebrew School\" two afternoons a week. They are forced to\nlearn to chant and sometimes read in an abstruse language said to be\nused in religious rituals from the ancient world. Many report\neducational and personal trauma as a result of this experience. \"<strong>I\nwas bored, so bored, all the time,</strong>\" said one ex-member, who wishes\nto remain anonymous. He grimaces and adds, \"<strong>I never, ever, ever want\nto go back to that place.</strong>\"</p>\n<p><strong>==\"I COULD NO LONGER GO ON\"==</strong></p>\n<p>The last straw for Melanie was when a bus hit her. She knew then that\nnot only was her belief system limiting -- it was also ineffective.</p>\n<p>\"<strong>I came face to face with the harsh reality that 'having faith' was\nnot actually going to save me from life's worst trials,</strong>\" reports\nMelanie tearfully. \"<strong>I just couldn't do it anymore. I had to give it\nup.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>Initially, Melanie's mentors tried to discourage her from leaving the\nmovement. \"<strong>Melanie paid us over two thousand dollars a year in\nmembership dues-not including the High Holiday services and Hebrew\nSchool for the kids,</strong>\" explains the shul's director, Rabbi Christine\nO'Donnell. \"<strong>She was like a mother to us, financially.</strong>\" Many\nhigh-ranking congregation members tried to force Melanie to stay,\nbribing her with aliyot to the Torah and promises of \"substantially\nsubsidized\" trips to Israel. But eventually they realized she would\nnot be deterred from leaving the movement, and gave up.</p>\n<p>\"<strong>I just wasn't worth it to them,</strong>\" Melanie confides, sobbing.\n\"<strong>It's like people don't care if you stay or if you go.  They think\nyou'll be fine without the Reform Movement.</strong>\"   She shakes her head\npensively. \"<strong>In that case, what's the point?</strong>\"</p>\n<p><strong>==\"FROM DISAPPOINTMENT TO HOPE\"==</strong></p>\n<p>What indeed? Melanie describes her\njourney making the documentary as a \"rising from the ashes\" of her\nyears in the Reform Movement. \"<strong>Making the movie really let me see\nthe space I had been in for the really fake place that it was,</strong>\" she\nexplains. She reveals that she is thinking of becoming Chareidi:\n\"<strong>Chasidic or one of the great Lithuanian rabbinical dynasties--the\nreal deal.</strong>\" She smiles mysteriously and adds, \"<strong>I've always wanted\nto study kabbalah.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>Since her transition out of Reform, Melanie is more optimistic about\nlife. \"<strong>Now, I have a sense of self and of the future,</strong>\" she\ndiscloses. \"<strong>I feel happy every day. I realized that even though the\nbus hit me, I can never really be down, because it's the road that\nmatters, not the bus.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>Next on Melanie's calendar? Purim. \"<strong>I love, love, love Purim,</strong>\"\nsays Melanie. \"<strong>All the parties. All the costumes. And the\nhamentaschen--oh, the hamentaschen!

The halacha there continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם שולט בשתי ידיו מניח בשמאל כל אדם</p>\n<p>And if he rules over both of his hands, he can leave it to everyone else's left hand</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you let your friend use your right arm as well, so that he rules over both of your hands, then you can defer all of the work to everyone else's left hands, leaving you free to go about your business.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The good news is that Purim is coming up, when things are reversed (Vanahafoch Hu), and you will be able to use his right hand, as opposed to him using your left hand.  This was in fact what happened between Avram and Lot, when Avram said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִם הַשְּׂמֹאל וְאֵימִנָה וְאִם הַיָּמִין וְאַשְׂמְאִילָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, your friend should know that according to Shir Hashirim, he may only use your left hand as a pillow:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שְׂמֹאלוֹ֙ תַּ֣חַת לְרֹאשִׁ֔י</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi there Paskens that this only applies in the desert:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמאלו תחת לראשי – במדבר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if you let him know of these sources, perhaps it will make things easier, but if not, at least you'll get the last laugh on Purim!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Actually, you have an obligation from the Torah not only to give your hand, but not to harden your heart (Deuteronomy 15:7).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹ֧א תְאַמֵּ֣ץ אֶת־לְבָבְךָ֗ וְלֹ֤א תִקְפֹּץ֙ אֶת־יָ֣דְךָ֔ מֵאָחִ֖יךָ הָאֶבְיֽוֹן׃</p>\n<p>Don't harden your heart and don't withhold your hand from your poor brother!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Regarding the heart, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/89400/1569\">PTIJ - Heart transplants</a> for more information.)</p>\n<p>However, since the obligation is only דֵּי מַחְסֹרוֹ (as much as he lacks), he can only demand your left hand if he himself lacks a left hand. And if you are forced to labor for him with your left hand, you are also considered to be lacking a left hand, and it is your right to demand the use of any other lefty's left hand.</p>\n\n\n",

Shavuot: for the obvious reason. Yom Kippur: [...] because on that day the second set of tablets were given. Purim: as we explained [on the page before referencing קימו וקבל, Shabbat 88a, etc.]. Purim was \"originally established for that\", meaning it was established for the acceptance of the Torah [unlike Shavuot which doesn't have a specific date associated with it].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That explanation of that variant could answer your question. (I didn't ask R Schachter if this is what he meant.)</p>\n\n<p>A major problem with this understanding is that there are some manuscripts (brought in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38517&st=&pgnum=211\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dikdukei Soferim</a>) that give the reason as דמעיקרא להכי אתקין דכתיב יום משתה ושמחה because for that reason it was established as <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3309.htm#19\" rel=\"noreferrer\">it says</a> \"days of feasting and happiness\".

Johanan further said in the name of R. Jose: Three things did Moses\n  ask of the Holy One, blessed be He, and they were granted to him. He\n  asked that the Divine Presence should rest upon Israel, and it was\n  granted to him. For it is said: Is it not in that Thou goest with us\n  [so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people, from all the people\n  that are upon the face of the earth]. He asked that the Divine\n  Presence should not rest upon the idolaters, and it was granted to\n  him. For it is said: ‘So that we are distinguished, I and Thy people’.\n  He asked that He should show him the ways of the Holy One, blessed be\n  He, and it was granted to him. For it is said: Show me now Thy ways.\n  Moses said before Him: Lord of the Universe, why is it that some\n  righteous men prosper and others are in adversity, some wicked men\n  prosper and others are in adversity? He replied to him: Moses, the\n  righteous man who prospers is the righteous man the son of a righteous\n  man; the righteous man who is in adversity is a righteous man the son\n  of a wicked man. The wicked man who prospers is a wicked man son of a\n  righteous man; the wicked man who is in adversity is a wicked man son\n  of a wicked man.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Master said above: ‘The righteous man who prospers is a righteous\n  man son of a righteous man; the righteous man who is in adversity is a\n  righteous man son of a wicked man’. But this is not so! For, lo, one\n  verse says: Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,\n  and another verse says: Neither shall the children be put to death for\n  the fathers. And a contradiction was pointed out between these two\n  verses, and the answer was given that there is no contradiction. The\n  one verse deals with children who continue in the same course as their\n  fathers, and the other verse with children who do not continue in the\n  course of their fathers! — [You must] therefore [say that] the Lord\n  said thus to Moses: A righteous man who prospers is a perfectly\n  righteous man; the righteous man who is in adversity is not a\n  perfectly righteous man. The wicked man who prospers is not a\n  perfectly wicked man; the wicked man who is in adversity is a\n  perfectly wicked man. Now this [saying of R. Johanan] is in opposition\n  to the saying of R.

Our hands have to hold the Siddur, carry the Torah, wear tefillin, and do other things involved with prayer. I haven't seen a Siddur called <em>Y'dei Esav</em>. It seems like this would be a decent name, as long as we have alluded to this verse, already to name a siddur. Is there such a Siddur around, and if so, where can I buy one? If not, why isn't there one?</p>\n<p>For those who insist that Esav was an evil man, I counter that there is nothing stated directly in the Torah that says this. Additionally, even a number of rabbis have commended his loyalty and commitment to honoring his father. To me, that feature alone should let him have a Siddur named after him.

Is it as simple as \"you're enabling them to give gifts to poor people on Purim, so it's good enough\"?  Or do they have somebody in the office actually make a kinyan on your behalf before giving the money or food to the poor people, with some formulation that makes sure each donor gives a shaveh perutah to each of two recipients?  If it's the second, does anyone know what text is actually used?</p>\n\n<p>For the standard mitzvah of tzedaka I would be surprised if the first option isn't good enough, since at the end of the day money is going to poor people.  For matanos laevyonim it's not so clear to me that it counts as an actual matana to two people, since the money all gets mixed up and it's not clear how it's divided.  The simplest ways to divide it would be:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Each recipient receives money from each donor, proportional to how much the donor gave.  For example if 100 people each gave $10 and there are 100 poor people, each poor person gets $10 total, 10 cents from each donor.  The problem is in general each donor's tzedaka is not necessarily going to a shaveh perutah for each of two poor people.</li>\n<li>The money gets given out in the order it was received.  In the same case, each donor would give to one recipient, which means they're not giving to two people as required.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For normal tzedaka it doesn't matter too much, but neither of these allows the donor to fulfill matanos laevyonim in the general case.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "PTIJ:When can you study Greek philosophy?",
    "content": "# PTIJ:When can you study Greek philosophy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud [Menachot 99b] tells us that someone asked Rabbi Ishmael, “May one such as myself, who have studied the entire Torah, learn Greek philosophy [chochmat yevanit]?”  The rabbi noted that the Tanach says that you must meditate on the Torah day and night [Joshua 1:8]. So he concluded: \"Therefore, go and find a time that is neither day nor night, and at that time you may study Greek philosophy!\"\nObviously, he was telling him to take a spaceship and go far, far from the solar system, where there is no day and no night, and there, in the middle of nowhere, he could study Greek philosophy to his heart’s content.  My halachic question is: How far must he be from the nearest star?</p>\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To understand when Greek Philosophy may be studied we must figure out what was meant by day and night. There is a very early Scriptural source that tells us what day and night are.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּקְרָא אֱלֹהִים לָאוֹר יוֹם וְלַחֹשֶׁךְ קָרָא לָיְלָה וַיְהִי\n  עֶרֶב וַיְהִי בֹקֶר יוֹם אֶחָד</p>\n  \n  <p>And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And\n  there was evening and there was morning, one day. (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0101.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mechon Mamre</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, what R. Yishmael meant was that one can study philosophy at a time when there is neither light nor darkness. Now this brings us to the old philosophical debate about whether darkness is the opposite of light, or merely the absence of light. If the former, there could conceivably be a time at which there is no light and no darkness. According to the latter view, though, there can not exist such a time because a lack of light is automatically darkness.</p>\n\n<p>The textual evidence in the Talmud does not indicate which school of thought R. Yishmael belonged to. If he belonged to the \"opposite\" camp then he was possibly allowing philosophy at certain times. If he belonged to the \"absence\" camp then he must have been saying that philosophy is never allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Talmud remains vague, we have a direct ruling from one of the earliest post-Talmudic sources. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Saadia Gaon</a> in Emunos V'deios Treatise I writes as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yet I cannot remain content at this point with all that I have\n  mentioned until I have made it clear that this thing to which these\n  proponents of dualism adhere so firmly – I mean [what they call the\n  principle of] <em>darkness</em> – is not a principle opposed to that of\n  light, but merely the absence of light. (<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=tjQdAAAAIAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=absence\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosenblatt translation p. 64</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Treatise II he states this again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ignorance, on the other hand, has no such source from which it is\n  derived, being merely the absence of knowledge, as we explained in the\n  matter of darkness that it constitutes the absence of light and not\n  its opposite. (<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=tjQdAAAAIAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=absence\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosenblatt translation p. 89</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, we have a clear ruling from R. Saadia Gaon that there can be no such time where there is neither light nor darkness. As such, one is never permitted to study Greek Philosophy (which probably includes parts of the very Emunos V'deios from which this ruling is derived).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Let us take a closer look at the actual Talmudic text.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צא ובדוק שעה <strong>שאינה לא</strong> מן היום ולא מן הלילה ולמוד בה חכמת יונית</p>\n  \n  <p>Go and search for a time that is <strong>not not</strong> of the day and not of the\n  night, and learn in it Greek Philosophy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The double negative clearly indicates that R. Yishmael is saying to find a time that is either day or night and learn philosophy. I.e. philosophy can be learned at any time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am taking issue with your quotation where you said,  \"Therefore, go and find a <strong>time</strong> that is neither day nor night, and at that <strong>time</strong> you may study Greek philosophy!\" Rabbi Yishma'el is talking about a <strong>time</strong>, whereas your question is asking about a <strong>place</strong>. That contradicts what Rabbi Yishma'el was saying.</p>\n\n<p>So, I will answer regarding when that time is. He is clearly referring to the Mashiach, of which <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14261&st=&pgnum=392\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zacharia 14:7</a> says that this will be a day which is neither day nor night.

But, in the name of taking some of the burden off of readers and potential answerers, I offer this discussion:</p>\n\n<p>@DoubleAA points out that it is ribis to deposit money into a Jewish-owned bank. This is presumably because the bank (a Jew) pays you interest for the privilege of keeping your money.

Could it be ribis on the seller's part to charge you interest, as it were, for keeping your own money (i.e., when you buy a smaller size for a higher unit price)? In other words, in the case where you are buying individual units one at a time as needed, you are taking longer to pay the seller for the same amount of merchandise, and you are paying interest for it in the form of a higher price for that merchandise.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In general, Ribis involves charging for allowing someone to hold onto your money or merchandise for a given amount of time (אגר נטר).

    "content": "# Difference between sins of Saul and sins of David?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Two of the most prominent Kings of Israel in the Scripture are Saul and David. These two men are given the most attention in 1 and 2 Samuel. David and Saul are foils of one another. Saul was rejected by God while David was a man after God’s own heart. However, if you’ve studied their lives carefully both of the men had some incredible failures in their life. Saul failed to obey the Lord in his commands and David committed adultery with Bathsheba. If both men had grievous sin in their lives, why was one rejected and the other blessed? What is the difference between these two men?</p>\n\n<p>P.s. How could David still be a man after G-ds Own Heart. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>David's sin was a personal matter, Saul's was national.</p>\n\n<p>King Saul was personally commanded to eradicate Amalek. This was a national interest which was under his authority as king. When he sinned and didn't obey, it was in his position as king, and so God punished him as a king (i.e. by losing his monarchy).</p>\n\n<p>King David sinned in something everyone was commanded against, not just him personally. It also had nothing to do with him being king; he could have done the same thing if he was a peasant (in theory). So his sin was personal, not national. Therefore God punished him as He would any person.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard this explanation in a couple shiurim, and also see it explained in <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/he-il/tanach/iyunim/ktuvim/tehilim/prakim/albo-shaul-vedavid.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article on daat.co.il</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the article it provides a parable to two notaries, one counterfeits a document, one commits adultery. The king punishes each according to their crime, but in addition, the counterfeiter loses his job, because he can't be trusted with it. Same with King Saul, he didn't uphold the responsibilities of the kingship, so he lost it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This question is addressed in the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%99_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%90.html?id=v_PloAEACAAJ\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Responsa of the Sages of Provence</a> # 71. Essentially the answer is that although David's sin was much more serious than Saul's, David immediately confessed when confronted by the prophet, while Saul did not confess but instead made excuses:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודע באמת שכל גזר דינו של שאול נתחתם שלא נמשכה מלכותו ועונו היה נכתם\n  ונקרע  גזר דינו של דוד ולא עלה בכף מאזנים ואע\"פ שגדול חטאו בענין בת\n  שבע כפלי כפלים ואע\"ף שרבותי' ז\"ל הפכו לזכות משפטו שכרם הרבה אבל אין\n  מקרא יוצא מדי פשוטו ומפני מה זכה שנמחל לו ושאול מת במעלו ואע\"פ שלא הקל\n  אלא בדבר עמלק להיות משרש אחריהם ולא להיות בדברי הנביא חולק גם שמואל\n  צעק עליו כל הלילה ולא נענה והשם אל תפלתו לא פנה אלא שאול לא הודה כדרך\n  המתודים אלא בא בעקיפין ואחר דרך בימו וחמד בדבר לצון ואמ' כי חמלו על\n  מיטב הצאן חייב העם הנגדר וזכה עצמו כמתהלך בתומו על זה הקפיד עליו השם\n  ללמדך כמה קשה בעיניו עון החוטא ואין מכיר את עוניו ומראה עצמו כמי שאינו\n  חוטא מפני היותו מתפטה אבל דוד השלם תכף שהוכיחו נתן הנביא והמשיל משל\n  העשיר וההלך הודה ולא בוש ואם הוא רך ומשוח מלך ולא מצא עקיפין ועלה אל\n  נגד זקני עמי וזקני פתה ואמר חטאתי ליי' ראה מה השיב לו נתן על ההודאה\n  ועל התמימות גם יי' העביר חטאתך לא תמות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Leib_Shmuelevitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz</a> has a sicha on this (Sichos Mussar § 53) which I <a href=\"http://parshaponders.com/tetzaveh-zachor-5778\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">translated and summarized</a>. You can read it there.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the explanation is that the sins of King David were the transgressions of mitzvos, for which he repented and was forgiven. He therefore didn’t lose the kingship. King Shaul on the other hand, the root cause of his sin was his middos (his character traits). Even though he repented for the transgression itself, he lost the kingship. This is because the underlying motivator for the sin, his misplaced humility, wasn’t corrected. This trait was a contradiction to his being King, so he lost the kingship to David.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz adds that he also incorrectly waived the honor due to him, another trait inappropriate for a king.</p>\n\n\n",

Had the Gemara just said it in the name of \"Rabbi Yehudah ben Il'ai\", then we would have been redeemed.  However, the Gemara attributed it to the wrong person no less than 8 times!  Do you really expect us to be redeemed?!</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As I suggest <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/89475/2\">here</a> based on R' Hirsch citing Isaiah, the <em>ultimate</em> Redemption is associated with our attribution of God as the Author of everything.</p>\n<p>Therefore, R' Shim’on ben Zebid's reporting the attribution of his idea all the way back to R' <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_bar_Ilai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehudah ben Il'ai</a> gets us part of the way back to God, but not all the way. Had R' Shim'on continued tracking the provenance of his teaching all the way back to Moshe Rabbeinu and thence to God, that would have constituted Redemption.</p>\n<p>It's possible the R' Shim'on was overcautious about making such an attribution. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.8b.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">very lesson</a> he was transmitting was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאי דכתיב וזרחה לכם יראי שמי (שמש צדקה וגו') אלו בני אדם שהן יראין להוציא שם שמים לבטלה</p>\n<p>What is the meaning of that which is written: “But to you that fear My name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and you shall go forth and leap as calves of the stall” (Malachi 3:20)? “You that fear My name”; these are people who are afraid to mention the name of Heaven in vain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>Translation including elucidation from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/william-davidson-talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">William Davidson Talmud</a> on Sefaria</sup></p>\n<p>So, perhaps he was afraid that if he attributed the idea all the way up to God, people would think he was taking God's name in vain, contradicting the lesson itself. Oh, well. No one ever said Redemption would come easily.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Y'know, repeating something that someone else said can get you into BIG trouble.</p>\n\n<p>True story as an example:</p>\n\n<p>My kids used to have this game where they would throw clothes up to the ceiling fan and watch the fan bat it around the room. They thought it was funny. (Kids have such queer imaginations, sometimes!) </p>\n\n<p>One day, I go up to the bedroom, and I see my ceiling fan is not rotating. Stuck around the fan was a pair of pantyhose. I ask my oldest son, who did it? He says he did it, but, I shouldn't get angry at him because his younger brother suggested that he do it. Guess who got in trouble? The older son, not the younger one.</p>\n\n<p>He thought that he would redeem himself by telling us that his brother suggested it. He was very wrong.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, I don't know what the rabbis in Talmud Megillah and Chulin were thinking. But the ones named in Nedarim seemed like they were all drunk on Purim wine. </p>\n\n\n",

One answer mentioned, here suggests not to think - at all. That doesn't solve the problem, at all, because you need to think about something at some time. People that never think are, well, just plainly <strong>stupid</strong>. That's not you, and you don't want to be stupid, believe me.</p>\n\n<p>You just need something that helps you stop thinking about halacha when you enter the bathroom. There are many simple things that you can do.</p>\n\n<p>For one thing, you can excrete without lifting the toilet seat. Trust me - within a few seconds, you won't be thinking about halacha or anything else other than how to clean up the damage before your wife finds out what you did. Then, you'll be thinking of some clever excuse to explain to her why you did it.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck to you. You, indeed, have a bigger problem than you think! </p>\n\n\n",

This is not the only place in Pesachim. A quick search in sefaria reveals a couple other places in Shas bavli and yerushalmi (about 20 or so places) which also spell it הילל. However, to search בית הלל hundreds of results pop up, as expected. </p>\n\n<p>So the question simply is why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In Tanakh, the name Hillel is always found defective: הִלֵּל (Judges 12:13, etc.). This form is also found in the Bar-Kosiba letters recovered at Wadi Murabbaʿat (הלל בן גריס, Mur. 24). </p>\n\n<p>However, the name Hillel is found both plene or defective in the best rabbinical manuscripts. Take, for example, the Codex Kaufmann A50, widely considered to be (one of) the most exact Mishah manuscripts. There, one finds both הֶלֵּל and הֶילֵּל, even in close proximity. In <a href=\"http://kaufmann.mtak.hu/img/ms50-50pc/ms50-004v-large.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot 8:1</a>, we find the following:</p>\n\n<p>... 'אֵלּוּ דְבָרִים שֶׁבֵּין בֵּית שַׁמַּיִ לְבֵית <strong>הֶלֵּל</strong> בִּסְעוֹדָה בֵּית שַׁמַּיִ אוֹמְרִין מְבָרֵךְ עַל הַיּוֹם וְאַחַר כָּךְ מְבָרֵךְ עַל הַיַּיִן [וּ]בֵית <strong>הֶילֵּל</strong> אוֹמְ</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://aleph.nli.org.il/F/LXFPBTM9TIYQHNLGFJ8CHLQJBCDFG2QXE8RYVII42SGYBB41CE-09201?func=service&doc_library=NNL01&doc_number=000070680&line_number=0001&func_code=WEB-BRIEF&service_type=MEDIA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MS Parma A</a> and <a href=\"https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-00470-00001/9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MS Add. 470.1</a> give both names as defective in this verse.</p>\n\n<p>The Leiden MS is the only complete manuscript of Yerushalmi is extant, and it too has both הלל and הילל forms. See Shevi'it 10:3:</p>\n\n<p>מה שתיקן <strong>הילל</strong> פרוזבול. ברם כמן דא. מעשרות מדבר תורה. <strong>והלל</strong> מתקין על דבר תורה.</p>\n\n<p>A profusion of Bavli variants also exist. Even in the pericope you cited, Pesachim 103a, the form הילל can be found in manuscripts Vilna, Venice, Munchen 95, T-S F 1(1).55 and Hr. 15.37; but in the same section, the form הלל is found in manuscripts Munchen 6, JTS 1608 & 1623, Vatican 125 & 109, Columbia 294–295 and British Library Or. 5530.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, Hillel can be found as both הלל or הילל. Plene and defective spellings were used interchangeably in many other cases as well, even in Tanakh, to a certain degree. Obviously, the issue of spelling the name was of little consequence to the scribes of these manuscripts and certainly the spellings do not affect the way the name was pronounced.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For the Gemara, I don't know. I can tell you this discussion comes up in the laws of Gittin, though -- how do you spell Hillel in a Get? The common practice is without a Yud, and as the Vilna Gaon points out rather strongly, the name occurs in Tanakh (mentioned briefly in Shoftim) spelled only one way -- no Yud -- which should settle it conclusively. Some, however, say to do it with a Yud, something to do with kabbalah and Gematria and ... I forget the details. Come to think of it ... you could probably check if that explanation fits better with those places in the Gemara ... but it's a stretch. I'd be more inclined to say \"printing oddity\" when talking about the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>The haskalah poet Y. L. Gordon actually runs this how-to-spell-Hillel question with in a poem called <em>Kotzo shel Yud</em>, in which a woman will be left an Agunah unless she accepts <em>this</em> Get; the Get spells her husband's name, Hillel, with no Yud. The nasty, overly-stringent rabbi declares the Get invalid, thus ruining the poor lady's life. (Of course what bothers me isn't so much that the fictional rabbi in the story is stringent, so much as that he's going against a rock-solid proof of the Vilna Gaon!) </p>\n\n<p>(I haven't read the poem; I just heard about it in a YUTorah lecture from Rabbi Dr. Shenur Leiman shlit'a.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is God resting on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently I learned that in the service of Shabbat there are no petitions made to God, as it is believed God is also resting. Unfortunately I read this a few weeks ago, and cannot longer find the reference.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, my question is, do Judaism (or maybe only e.g. Orthodox) believe that in Shabbat God is also resting?</p>\n\n<p>If this is the case however, when exactly would God be resting? Because there are hours of the day when it is Shabbat in say Australia but not in Canada, and <em>vice versa</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry the two questions together, but they are necessarily related.</p>\n\n<p>PS: non Jew here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This seems to be a common misconception among many Jews also, so I'll try to address it as clearly as possible:</p>\n\n<p>There are 2 separate parts to your question - 1. Why do we not make requests of G-d on Shabbos, and 2. Does G-d do work on Shabbos (and when does he consider it Shabbos)?</p>\n\n<p>In regards to the first question, the reason why we don't make requests of G-d has nothing to do with whether or not he is \"resting\", but rather, as the Talmud Yerushali says in 'שבת פרק טו הלכה ג, that we do not make requests about our personal needs, with the exception of certain prayers (eg. אלוקי נצור וברכת המזון) whose language is set and identical to that of the rest of the week, is because making requests shows that one is lacking something, and has needs, which is a lack in מנוחה (roughly translated as rest, but includes a completeness).</p>\n\n<p>This being said (that our lack of making requests of G-d on Shabbos has nothing to do with him, rather with us), G-d does, in fact, also \"rest\" on Shabbos (in regards to question 2). However, as Rebbi told the Emperor Antoninus in meseches Shabbos, while it does rain etc. on Shabbos, that is not G-d doing acts of creation (the true definition of melacha, \"creative work\"), but rather him moving things around in his own domain. There is no question of \"somewhere in the world it is not Shabbos\", as G-d refrains from doing melacha in each place when it is Shabbos there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Firstly, with your comments about it being Shabbat at different times in different places, you are assuming G-d to be physical and finite and residing in one location (possibly Jerusalem).</p>\n\n<p>We do say the phrase \"Sab'einu Mituvecha\" (satisfy us with your goodness) in the Shabbat prayer as well as in the weekday prayer (where it appears in Barech Aleinu, although some change the second word from \"your goodness\" to \"its goodness\" referring to the land). </p>\n\n<p>The weekday prayer of Barech Aleinu is a prayer for material goodness - asking in particular for the land to yield crops and thus we also put in the prayer for rain in that blessing as that is part of the process of getting a good yield.</p>\n\n<p>In the Shabbat prayer it is a spiritual goodness we are requesting - a good feeling so we can serve Hashem. (V'Taher Libeinu l'ovd'cha be'emet - purify our hearts to serve you in truth ).</p>\n\n<p>So we do make requests but not in a material way, which requires \"melacha\".</p>\n\n<p>Of course, rain does fall on Shabbat, and wind blows, and we still mention that in Atah Gibor, but we do not \"request\" this on Shabbat because we are supposed to take our mind off the physical acts.</p>\n\n<p>We do not ask non-Jews to perform forbidden labour for us on Shabbat. And we don't ask G-d either.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.29a.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot 29a</a> provides the text of this abridged Amida, in the name of Shmuel.</p>\n<p>Within that discussion, Rav Bibi bar Abbayei says that Havineinu may not be said throughout the entire rainy season, during which we require the insertion of ותן טל ומטר. The Gemara concludes that the main issue in doing so would be the potential confusion it would cause to people who are used to leaving out that phrase from Havineinu during the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Does this imply that if one had the text in front of them, and there were no grounds for confusion, then saying Havineinu with ותן טל ומטר wouldn't be a problem? Is this discussed in any post-Talmudic texts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This sort of goes into a meta-halakhic question of when the circumstances behind a statement in the Gemara change, whether the halakhah changes, or whether we assume that the rabbis in the Gemara were reacting to their circumstances but setting rules that are independent of them.  There are cases where the halakhah definitely changes (like assuming fires on Shabbat are only threats to property and not life), there are cases where the halakhah definitely doesn't change (like medicine on Shabbat, really most gezeirot), and there are some that get debated on occasion (like mayim achronim).  There are unsettled issues in this area.  But usually the initial assumption is that the Rabbis used their assumptions in setting up davening, and now that they have, the liturgy they instituted is relatively fixed even if what they had in mind has changed.</p>\n\n<p>This is discussed in later halakhic texts.  The Shulchan Arukh, OC 110, rules that one does not say Havineinu in the wintertime.  As does the Rambam (MT Hilkhot Tefillah 2:4).  Some of the commentaries on Shulchan Arukh do not mention any difference davening from siddurim (Mishnah Brurah, Taz).  The Kaf HaChaim there notes that if one erred and did havineinu during the rainy season, one still fulfilled their obligation.  The Magen Avraham there says something about one who is sure they won't err, which might apply to this situation, but I can't quite parse what he's saying.</p>\n\n<p>edit: However the Koren siddur notes permit saying havineinu in wintertime.  But I'm not really sure a siddur would prevent getting mixed up.  I don't think most people read the siddur so slowly that they'd get up to ten tal umatar and think about whether it's winter or not.  People get confused and say/don't say the correct one with siddurim even without the havineinu confusion.</p>\n\n<p>The Chayei Adam rules similarly (Klal 24, part 30) that one can say Havineinu in a pressing situation, but not in wintertime.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Arnold Schoenberg's Survivor from Warsaw\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is kind of a music question, and kind of a Judaism question. Several years ago, when I was assistant director of the Nashville Symphony Chorus, I sang with a men's chorus on the Arnold Schoenberg work  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Survivor_from_Warsaw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>A Survivor From Warsaw</em></a>. Part of my responsibility (apart from learning a very difficult 18 bars of music) was teaching this completely Gentile choir the pronunciation of the Shema (I am not Jewish, but the task fell on me anyway). The thing is, Schoenberg specifically indicates in the score that it should be pronounced with Ashkenazic Hebrew, rather than Sephardic Hebrew. So, even though some of us had sung some Hebrew before, we had to re-learn it for this piece.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you suppose Schoenberg specified Ashkenazic pronunciation?</strong> (The piece was written and premiered in America, where Sephardic pronunciation seems to be dominant.)\n.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Mr. Shoenberg most likely specified Ashkenazic pronunciation of the Hebrew because until the Holocaust, Poland/Lithuania/Eastern Europe was the center of the Ashkenazim Jewish population, and he wanted accuracy in that detail.

    "content": "# My Adult Conversion\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m seriously interested in converting from Baptist to Judaism. I am aware of the local  synagogues in my area, but I’m unsure on which to approach and any protocols.</p>\n\n<p>For example; should I go during the week to inquire? Should I call to make an appointment? Should I attend service and then inquire? (Awkward since I have never attended , but I’m adventurous so that’s not a deterrent.) Is ethnicity a challenge in southern synagogues? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Conversion to Judaism is a major life change, therefore it is much, much more difficult to convert to Judaism than it is to convert to other religions. You must examine your motives for conversion before actually pursuing it. Why do you want to be Jewish? Do you want to become closer to G-d? Unlike other religions, Judaism does <strong>not</strong> teach that in order to please G-d you must be Jewish. Non-Jews can serve G-d just as well as any born Jew can, by observing the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/62221/jewish/The-7-Noahide-Laws-Universal-Morality.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seven Noahide Laws</a> and living a righteous life. </p>\n\n<p>I would recommend speaking to your local Orthodox rabbi and talking with him about your interest in conversion. He can either help you himself or put you in the right direction. </p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that conversion to Reform or Conservative Judaism does not make you Jewish according to traditional Jewish law. In order to be accepted by everyone as a true Jewish convert, you must go through an Orthodox conversion. Do not settle for anything less. </p>\n\n<p>Ethnicity is not something that has ever been focused on in Judaism, and historically most Jews I have ever known in my life (myself included) have not been racist. But as with any group of people, you will most certainly find people who will be concerned with this. But understand they do not represent Judaism's thoughts on race and ethnicity at all. Besides, Jewish people come in all sorts of colors - there are Jews all over the racial spectrum. </p>\n\n<p>Hatzlachah rabbah (good luck) in your journey!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is absolutely no harm in visiting the synagogue! Look online to see if you can find the synagogue's website. There, it should have contact information for individuals looking to visit. Call or email ahead to ask when would be appropriate for you to visit, and who you can talk to about becoming Jewish.\nMake sure you do research on the synagogue/rabbi. Not all rabbis perform conversions, and of those who do, not all are recognized by the Rabbinical Council of America or the Israeli chief rabbinate. If you do wish to pursue an Orthodox conversion, it'd be best to complete under the supervision of a reputable rabbi and beit din the first time. Otherwise, questions on the validity of your Jewish status could come up, and that can cause all kinds of hassle when making Aliyah, moving to a new community, or getting married.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not wish to convert Orthodox, but wish to convert Conservative, you still need to find a reputable rabbi and beit din to be recognized throughout the conservative community. While you can make Aliyah under the law of return with a conservative conversion, you will not be recognized as a Jew by the chief rabbinate or the larger orthodox community. Instead of the RCA, you'd be looking for Rabbinical Assembly associated individuals.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Get in touch with the <a href=\"http://judaismconversion.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbinical Council of America</a></p>\n\n<p>305 Seventh Avenue, 12th Floor New York, New York 10001 </p>\n\n<p>Phone 1: 212-807-9000 Phone 2: 212-741-7522 Fax: 212-727-8452 </p>\n\n<p>To contact the Rabbinical Council of America by email office@rabbis.org </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Mark Dratch, Executive Vice President mdratch@rabbis.org </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Elazar Muskin, President President@rabbis.org </p>\n\n\n",

Believing, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9203/9682\">some on here do</a>, that aliens are just another species of animal, Yosef had killed ET to feast on him. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי אתי יאכלו האנשים בצהרים</p>\n  \n  <p>For ET will the men eat at noon</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow. This Purim Torah joke just took a dark turn. </p>\n\n<p>Yehudah was therefore angry with Yosef, and so in his final argument before Yosef reveals himself, he exclaims (44:34):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי איך אעלה אל אבי והנער איננו אתי</p>\n  \n  <p>For how can I go up to my father and the lad is not ET?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yehudah had previously promised that he would return ET safely. Now what is he supposed to do?!</p>\n\n<p>Alas, when Yosef revealed himself, the brothers were so overcome with shock that he was the viceroy of Egypt, regret over having tortured him so, and anxiety over the possibility of revenge that they could not focus on ET’s demise - and, like the butler with Yosef, they did not remember ET, and they forgot him. </p>\n\n<p>According to Shemos 20:20:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא תעשון אתי</p>\n  \n  <p>Do not make ET</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In context, this means that one should not make a statue in ET’s likeness. Why would anyone do this? To memorialize his brave sacrifice on the brothers’ behalf. </p>\n\n<p>Some time later, Hashem gives Moshe a tour of ET’s home world (33:21):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה מקום אתי</p>\n  \n  <p>Behold, the place of ET</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, after all of this, it turns out that ET was okay! For we find in the story of Bilam (Bamidbar 22:13) that Balak says to Bilam:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכה נא אתי</p>\n  \n  <p>Please, come, ET</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somehow ET managed to survive being eaten in Yosef’s palace, and now Balak sook him out, hoping that he would want to take revenge on that people. </p>\n\n<p>As we know, Bilam failed, so ultimately ET did not turn against them. Why not? Maybe he didn’t want to take revenge - he’s a peaceful being, after all. Even if he did, only Yosef would be targeted - the others tried to save him. And what could ET do? Yosef is protected from Ayin Hara (BM 84a). </p>\n\n<p>There are many other pesukim that discuss אתי, but I think this joke is getting old by now. </p>\n\n\n",

If one isn't obligated to ask <em>mechilah</em> (ask for forgiveness) in this context, one would still be obligated to maintain the peace. The fact remains someone may be annoyed or angry and you can do something to alleviate it. The whole question of guilt aside.</p>\n<p>The Torah says, \"לֹֽא־תִשְׂנָ֥א אֶת־אָחִ֖יךָ בִּלְבָבֶ֑ךָ הוֹכֵ֤חַ תּוֹכִ֙יחַ֙ אֶת־עֲמִיתֶ֔ךָ וְלֹא־תִשָּׂ֥א עָלָ֖יו חֵֽטְא׃  -- Do not hate your brother in your heart; you shall surely rebuke your compatriot, and do not carry a sin for him.\" (Vayiqra 19:17) From the middle of this verse, we learn the obligation to rebuke others. However, commentaries on the verse itself notice the combination of clauses and suggest a second <em>mitzvah</em> is being given as the more literal read (<em>peshat</em>) of the verse. For example the Chizquni (only because I can cut-n-paste <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni,_Leviticus.19.17.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a translation from Sefaria</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא תשנא את אחיך בלבבך אם שמעת שהעוה לך לא תהיה נוטר לו שנאה בלבבך מסותרת אלא הוכיח תוכיח אותו מדוע עשית לי כך ושמא מתוך כך יתברר הדבר כי הכל שקר ולא נתכוין למה שאתה סבור, או יתקן את מה שהעוה ומתוך כך לא תשא עליו חטא לחשדו בדבר שאינו. ד״‎א הוכח תוכיח את עמיתך אם ראית בו ערות דבר תוכיחנו. אבל אם לא תוכיחנו תשא עליו חטא לחשדו בדבר שאינו.</p>\n<p>“Do not hate your brother (fellow Jew) in your heart.” If it has come to your attention that that Jew made negative comments about you, accused you falsely behind your back of wrongdoing, do not bottle your resentment up in your heart by hating him.” You should rather הוכח תוכיח את עמיתך, “remonstrate with your colleague about having wrongly accused you,” asking him what prompted him to badmouth you. Perhaps, once matters are in the open you can demonstrate to your colleague that he completely misinterpreted one of your actions. Alternately, you will become aware that what had been reported to you as having said by him about you was misrepresented, and not meant detrimentally at all. (B’chor Shor) You are to act in this manner even if you are convinced that your remonstrations will not help at all. In fact, your failure to make an attempt at reconciliation will be held against you by the heavenly tribunal. This is why the verse concludes with the words: ולא תשא עליו חטא, “so that you will not burden him with a sin.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, there is a mitzvah in the Torah to clear the air. After all, animosity is prohibited (except of the truly evil person).</p>\n<p>The only caveat I would give is the famous dispute between Rav Yisrael Salanter and the Chafeitz Chaim. In R Yisrael Meir haKohein's Seifer Chafeitz Chaim, he rules that if one intentionally did something that would hurt another if they knew about it, in his case -- spoke ill about them -- one still has to ask <em>mechilah</em> in order to do <em>teshuvah</em> for it. Rav Yisrael Salanter was asked to give a letter of approbation to the work and refused to do so unless this one ruling were taken out. It wasn't. (This story might be apocryphal or not, but the ruling is at part 1, 4:12. <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2013/10/why-forgive/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Musings has a nice discussion</a> of sources for this dispute that includes exploring what's the purpose of asking mechilah; probably of interest to you given the question.)</p>\n<p>But in our case, if one isn't really guilty, and the only point would be to clear the air, then I would think even the Chafeitz Chaim would agree that one shouldn't mention the offense when there is no ill will to be resolved.</p>\n<p>As for guilt, there are still ways a person might be guilty even though they acted unintentionally, while asleep, under compulsion, etc...</p>\n<p>1- Criminal neglect. Perhaps the offense happened in a situation I should have been more careful to avoid. So that even while I offended accidentally, I am guilty of putting myself in the situation where that accident were possible. Of course, that depends on circumstance. As the <em>mishnah</em> says (Bava Qama 2:6),  \"אדם מועד לעולם, בין בשוגג בין במזיד, בין בין ער בין ישן -- a person is always forewarned [of liability to do damage], whether asleep or awake.\" The Nemuqei Yoseif explains the point of \"whether asleep\" as including things done without will, \"<em>be'oneis</em>\" (under compulsion). Which is consistent with the variant version found in the talmud (Sanhedrin 72a) which ends, \"בין באונס בין ברצון -- whether under compulsion or willingly.\"</p>\n<p>2- There is a principle about how Divine Providence works, \"מגלגלים חובה על ידי חייב -- they [in heaven] bring about a deleterious [event] through someone deletorious.\" (Tana deVei Eliyahu Rabba ch. 15; Rashi's version of Taanis 29a, but our text has \"וחובה ליום חייב -- and deleterious [event] on a deleterious day\".)</p>\n<p>G-d has many potential ways of bringing trial to that other person's life.

    "content": "# How could Aharon stand inside the Mishkan\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the position in the gemara in Shabbos :צב that all of the leviim (includes cohanim) were 10 amos tall, how could Aaron or Moshe fit in the Ohel Moed (10 Amos tall as well, see parshas Teruma) standing straight and wearing tefillin and the mitznefes above their heads? Magnifying the question, Tosfos (and seemingly all of the rishonim other than the Rashbam in Bava Basra) holds that ten amos is just until his neck (and with his head he was 10 1/2 amos tall), and this was his height before having the shemen hamishcha, which according to many, we see from Dovid hamelech made people grow taller?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Aron did not take up any room as it says Yoma 21a and Megila 10b. </p>\n\n<p>Likewise we find in Avos 5,5  עומדים צפופים ומשתחוים רווחים they stood in the Bais Hamikdash squashed and bowed down with space.</p>\n\n<p>So too with Aharon and Moshe - who were 10 Amos tall not including the Mitznefes, which made them taller - didn't suddenly bang their heads because their presence took up less space relative to the Mishkan which made space when it was needed. \nThe Alshich in Eicha (Lamentations) 4,12 explains (see hebrew books) that there are no boundaries of space in the Sanctuary because it is an area in this world that is shared with the upper Realms Where Hashem Dwells which is Ruchni (Metaphysical) and do not have space constraints. Hashem is infinite and still encapsulates within the Mishkan/Beis Hamikdash. </p>\n\n<p>An alternative answer is The Malbim commentary on Maseches Shabbos 92a which says that Moshe and the cohanim/levied who carried the mizbeach were able to miraculously change height according to the task at hand but their height was that of a regular person. So Moshe for example was only 10 Amos high to set up the planks which were ten Amos but once he went into the mishkan to serve he was back to a regular height. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Aharon and Moshe were not giants. These are metaphors and stories that have been taken literally. Many Rishonim have spoken about what a shame it is that people take aggadot literally when they are usually either speculation or meant to convey sodot. Very rarely are they literally true. In this case Aaron is obviously not 10 amot tall. Og's bed was 9 amot by the Torah's words, implying that was his height, now how did Moshe, who is taller than him, jump and only reach his ankle?</p>\n\n<p>The blessed Rambam's thoughts on the matter: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first class is, as far as I have seen, the largest in point of their numbers and of the numbers of their compositions; and it is of them that I have heard most. The members of this class adopt the words of the Sages literally, and give no kind of interpretation whatsoever. With them all impossibilities are necessary occurrences. This is owing to their being ignorant of science and far away from knowledge. They do not possess that perfection which would spur them on of their own accord, neither have they found any means for rousing their attention. They think that in all their emphatic and precise remarks the Sages only wished to convey the ideas which they themselves comprehend, and that they intended them to be taken in their literalness. And this, in spite of the fact that in their literal significance some of the words of the Sages would savour of absurdity. And so much so that were they manifested to the ordinary folk (leave alone the educated) in their literalness, they would reflect upon them with amazement and would exclaim: “How can there exist any one who would seriously think in this way and regard such statements as the correct view of things, much less approve of them.” This class of men are poor, and their folly deserves our pity. For in their own opinions they are honouring the Sages, whereas in reality they are all the time degrading them to the lowest depths—and this all unconsciously. As God lives, it is this class of thinkers that robs our religion of its beauties, darkens its brilliance, and makes the Law of God convey meanings quite contrary to those it was intended to convey... </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>-Rambam, Introduction to Mishnah Tractate Sanhedrin, chapter 10 (Perek Helek)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is asked by Moshav Zekeinim (Shemos 26:1), brought by Tosafos HaShalem (Shemos 26:16 § 7), and by the Shita Mekubetzes HaShalem on Bechoros 44a s.v. משה רבינו.

In there he describes his tradition of the correct way to learn, going back to his father (R. Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik) and his grandfather (R. Chaim Soloveitchik). There are several passages there that allude to the idea, but the one I quote below is probably the closest match.</p>\n\n<p><strong>שעורי רבנו משולם דוד הלוי דרוש ואגדה עמוד נ</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזה המצב היום שכן האופן שבו לומדים כיום אין זה בגדר לימוד כלל מחנכים\n  את הבחורים להתעכב על הדף הראשון ולומר סברות ו'תורות' בלא לדעת כלום פעם\n  למדו עוד ועוד מסכתות וכל בחור טוב ידע כמה סדרים וידעו שבחור על גיל\n  עשרים ושתים אינו צריך לומר סברות וחידושי תורה רק ללמוד הרבה מסכתות עס\n  רש\"י תוס' ורמב\"ם ולהבין היטב מה מחלוקת רש\"י ותוס ומה מח' הרמב\"ם\n  והראב\"ד ורק אחרי שיודע הרבה גמרות יכול לומר בכל מקום הערות וחידושי\n  תורה אמיתיים משא\"כ כשאין יודעים הרבה מסכתות וסוגיות הש\"ס השכל עדיין לא\n  טעם טעמה של תורה וכשרוצה לומר סברות מעקם את הגמ' כדי שתתאים לשכלו\n  השבוע אמרתי איזה דין בשיעור וכולם היו בדעה פה אחד שאין הדבר כן עד\n  שפתחתי גמ' והראיתי להם שזו גמ' מפורשת הרי היו יכולים להעביר על כך עשרה\n  ימים להתווכח ולחשוב שהם צודקים כך זה כשאין יודעים הרבה גמרות כאשר\n  לומדים באופן זה התורה היא שטחית כי איך אפשר לעיין כראוי כשחסרים ידיעות\n  מקיפות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another source that seems to attribute this idea to R. Chaim Soloveitchik is a pamphlet by R. Shimon Fuerst on proper methodology of learning. In there he relates that he heard the following story from a great Torah scholar who heard it directly from the Gaon of Brod (one of the characters in the story). Most of the story is in Yiddish so I can't provide a real translation, but I think the punchline is that R. Chaim Solovetichik said that you can't say a pilpul without knowing the entire Talmud with Rashi.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tenu Kavod LaTorah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22633&st=&pgnum=10&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">p. 9</a>)</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סיפר לי גדול בתורה אחד ששמע מפי קדשו של הגאון מבראד ז\"ל (ולא עד מפי\n  עד) פעם אחת נסע לקבל את פני הגאון רבי חיים ז\"ל מבריסק בעבור שדיברו\n  לבתו את בנו רבי וועלוועל ז\"ל שנעשה אח\"כ גאון הדור הר' וועלוועל היה בעת\n  ההיא בערך בן ט\"ז שנים</p>\n  \n  <p>אמר הגאון רבי חיים להגאון מבראד מיין וועלוועל גידענקט גאנץ ש\"ס מיט\n  רש\"י הרב מבראד עמד נשתומם ושאל את הגאון רבי חיים רבי חיים וואס איז מיט\n  אייך גישעהן זייט ווענן איז בייא אייך בקיאות אויך א ענין בייא אייך\n  לערנט מען דאך נור בעיון </p>\n  \n  <p>אמר לו הגאון רבי חיים בראדער רב בייא מיר אויב עמעצער זאגט א פילפול\n  איידער ער גידענקט גאנץ ש\"ס מיט רש\"י איז דאס בייא מיר א פילפול של הבל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This idea was also stated by R. Yaakov Kamenetsky. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Making of a Godol p. 724:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"When R' Shurin related his grandfather's opinion on how much gemara\n  to cover to whoever was his <em>rebbi</em> at the time, the latter argued\n  that only the prodigies in Slabodka could maintain such a pace, and\n  that if one had to make a choice between broad knowledge and\n  <em>lomduth</em>, the latter took primacy. When R' Shurin transmitted his <em>rebbi</em>'s thesis back to his grandfather, he exclaimed angrily, \"א סברא אהין א סברא אהער [A (<em>lomduth</em>) conjecture hither, a conjecture\n  thither]: how can one say a סברא without knowing gemara?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The grandfather is R.

I've attempted wherever possible to convey the sense of each paragraph and argument,\nusually in the same basic order as the author.

The Palestinian Talmud is much more cryptic than the Babylonian Talmud, and as such requires extensive explanations for almost every line. This is why you often find people discussing whether a post fulfills the criteria of PTIJ/פתא\"י – most of these posts are themselves rather cryptic, and it doesn't do anyone any good to explain cryptic passages by substituting it for something else cryptic. As Rambam writes in his introduction to Guide for the Perplexed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For I observed that by expounding these passages by means of\n  allegorical and mystical terms, we do not explain anything, but merely\n  substitute one thing for another of the same nature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>תלמוד פרסי <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_Yaakov\" rel=\"noreferrer\">אין יעקב</a> (<em>Persian Talmud Isn't Jacob</em>) is a collection of the stories and moral teachings of the Persian Talmud.

    "content": "# PTIJ: Was Yehoshua Jewish?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah says Yehoshua was \"bin Nun\", the son of a Catholic nun. Does this mean that Yehoshua had to convert to be a part of the Jewish people (which might explain his name change from Hoshea to Yehoshua)? Perhaps his mother was indeed a Jew but she converted out of the faith? Whatever the possibility, his mother was obviously a bad nun as nuns are supposed to be celibate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

The Torah was not written in English, so his mother was not a nun. Rather, נון is the Aramaic word for fish.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97_%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bechorot 8a</a>, where the gemara writes:\nהדולפנין פרין ורבין כבני אדם\nwhere Rashi emends the text and writes:\nה\"ג הדולפנין פרים ורבים מבני אדם - שאם בא אדם עליהם מתעברות הימנו:</p>\n\n<p>that \"dolphins\" interbreed with humans, meaning that if a human has intercoure with them, they become pregnant from it.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Yehoshua was a merman.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, one might then have questions about his status, since a fish is not Jewish and we follow matrilineal descent. However, Yehoshua bin Nun was present at Mattan Torah (see Shemot 32:17), and before Matan Torah, patrilineal descent was the rule. See <a href=\"http://revach.net/ask/article.php?id=1331\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, for example.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You've totally misread the text! In the Bavli Talmud, written in Aramaic, the good man is referred to as \"Yehoshua <em>Bar</em> Nun\" i.e. \"Bar None\", as in \"the best ever\".</p>\n\n<p>As for the name change, there is a well-known midrash explaining that Moshe was constantly calling him over by saying \"Yo, Hoshea\" and it just sort of stuck. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Yehoshua 'bin נ' means that the number Nun, or 50, is supposed to be written in BINary. 'bin' is the designation that the number that follows is a binary number. Yehoshua used to wear a jersey that said 'Yehoshua 110010' as we today would write 'Yehoshua 50'. The 1s and 0s actually indicated victory (1) and loss (0). Moshe Rabbeinu saw prophetically that Yehoshua would be battling 6 canaanite nations. One nation would run away, leaving 6 or the original 7 for Yehoshua to battle, hence a 6-digit binary string. Each of the nations was designated a specific location in his binary string. Moshe Rabbeinu also foresaw that Yehoshua would not complete the settling of the Jews in the land. Moshe indicated this to Yehoshua by having some of the 1s where he accomplished the settling, and the 0s represent unsettled tribes left for after his death.</p>\n\n<p>There were 31 kings in the land of Canaan when Yehoshua came in. He designated a bit position in a double word byte (32 bits altogether) to track elimination of each one, leaving himself in the final primary bit position.</p>\n\n<p>Yehoshua was into people wearing Jerseys. Each tribe would go out to battle with a different colored jersey, with the color that matched that tribes Degel (flag). If he encountered someone without a Jersey, he would typically approach him, bow, and ask 'Are you for us or against us?'.</p>\n\n<p>The binary notation is seen in other areas of the book of Joshua as well. He encircled the city of Jericho 7 times because 7 in binary is designated as 111, which signifies victory all around.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara tells how they hold of these Tanaims' methods of expounding on Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>However, in Rashi, he has a different text for when the Gemarah says the words: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבא סבר לה כר' יונתן ומתרץ לקראי כר' יונתן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which implies that Rava holds of Rav Yonasan's way of expounding Scripture. However, Rashi has the following different text:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ורבא מתרץ להו בתר דעתיה דרבי יונתן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which seems to imply something completly different, in that he does not hold of Rav Yonasan's opinion, rather in this argument, he bases his side of the argument on the opinions of Rav Yonasan, and not that he himself holds of this opinion. As it says he 'goes after the opinion of Rav Yonasan'.\nAnd so, at face value, it would seems the text Rashi brings is adding a nouvelle addition. </p>\n\n<p>However, later on in the Gemarah, on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.96a.1?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">96a</a> in the Gemarah's re-quoting of this section of Gemarah, to discuss Rava's angle of the dispute, the Gemarah bring the same words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבא סבר לה כרבי יונתן ומתרץ לקראי כרבי יונתן </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the peculiar part is that Rashi no longer has the words that were mentioned earlier, rather the same text that the Gemarah has maintained until now:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבא סבר לה כרבי יונתן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in conclusion, the contradition in the text Rashi has seems quite puzzling, becuase it is unclear wheather Rava is using Rav Yonasan's opinion to <em>win</em> the present argument, or if he holds of his shitta le'halachah.</p>\n\n<p><sub>hmmmm</sub></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The words ורבא מתרץ להו בתר דעתיה דרבי יונתן do not imply that Rava disagrees with R. Yonasan. Rashi merely states that Rava follows the position of R. Yonasan. The only reason one would infer otherwise is because Rashi's text differs slightly from that printed in our Gemaras, and therefore sounds as if Rava disagrees--but since presumably this was Rashi's text, not something that he consciously modified, the inference is not a valid one. Thus, there is no contradiction in Rashi. </p>\n\n\n",

I'd like to mention a few <em>halakhic</em> parameters of this mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>The simple mitzvah is to wear one pillow. However, <em>mehadrin</em> is to replace the pillow with a larger pillow whenever one hears the word גדול in the Megillah (7 times, hence 8 pillows total). This is learned from Esther 9:4, where Mordechai is described as הולך וגדול, hence <em>al akhat kama vekhama</em> Achashveirosh.  A further opinion says that <em>mehadrin min hamehadrin</em> is to add a pillow every time you hear the word גדול, for a total of 8 by the end of the reading.  There is a <em>makhloket</em> whether one needs successively larger pillows to fulfil <em>mehadrin min hamehadrin</em> or not.</p>\n\n<p>There is also a discussion of what to do if your pillow falls out.  Most opinions say that you have fulfilled your obligation if the pillow is in when the reading starts. However, if the pillow was placed in a way that it is likely to fall out, then most say that you need to replace it. Also, if the reading is not in its proper time, then all agree that it must not fall out for the entire reading.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><em>L'hatlicha</em>, we have to add a pillow on each mention and we don't remove/replace pillows.  Chazal learn this from the <em>other</em> post-written-torah holiday; Hillel successfully argues on Shabbat 21 that for each night of Chanukah we add a light because we should always increase, not decrease.  So, too, with the pillows.  Beit Shammai says to remove pillows, but when do we ever listen to them?</p>\n\n<p><em>B'dieved</em>, if we only used one pillow for the whole reading, it is acceptable, just like with Chanukka lights.  In both cases you need at least one for the entire duration of the <em>mitzvah</em>, in this case the reading of the <em>megillah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If using more than one pillow then, like Hanuka lights, they must appear uniform.  Since they will be under your clothing, variations in color and fabric don't matter (no one will see); they just need to each add the same amount of bulk.  There is a <em>makhloket</em> about whether they all need to be of the same dimensions or if they only need to have the same volume.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you should bring a ninth pillow to the <em>megillah</em> reading, so you have something comfortable to sit on.  There are no specific <em>halachic</em> requirements for this <em>shamash</em> pillow.</p>\n\n\n",

There were two other conspirators, an Egyptian (צר, a shortened form of מִצְרָיִם) and Haman, their leader, who sought to eliminate Achashverosh and claim the throne.</p>\n\n<p>It was quite ironic, then, that after Bigtan and Teresh were executed, the king promoted Haman to the #2 spot.  But hey, the king was always kind of oblivious; Bigtan would have failed a security check had the king bothered to check the annals before hiring him, but he didn't.  Haman was content to bide his time, but the Egyptian was rightly concerned that Haman would sacrifice his former conspirator at a moment's notice.  After all, the guy was ready to start a major bloodbath over one guy not bowing down to him, and that stake was big enough for more than just Mordechai.  Haman was clearly unstable and the צר would have to eliminate both Haman and Achashverosh before Haman eliminated him.</p>\n\n<p>Now Ester wouldn't mind <em>at all</em> if the צר eliminated Haman, but she couldn't guarantee the outcome.  The צר might first kill Achashverosh and then <em>fail</em> to kill Haman, and we'd end up with King Haman, a horrifying thought.  So she warned the king about the צר who was coming for both of them, but since she knew that the king was pretty reckless (look how he treated Vashti), she focused on the threat to the king's trusted advisor instead of relying on his own self-interest.  She hoped that, at the least, the צר would not have a vendetta against her people like Haman did.

It is in contrast to being an \"express\" Rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>For some reason, congregational and yeshiva rabbis like to give long speeches. On and on and on for hours on end, sometimes. They like to express themselves. That's your express rabbi. Believe me, I've had my fill of express rabbis.</p>\n\n<p>You want a local rabbi, instead. You want someone who makes a short sermon, gets to the point quickly, wraps it up, and gets you to the Kiddush before you and the rest of the congregation get overly hungry, and while the chulent hasn't yet turned into spackle and the kugel hasn't yet burned to black carbon.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>\"Local\" also has a nuance that it's specific for your needs and not generalized.

I ask the rabbi, \"Can I use a tissue to blow my nose into it on Shabbat?\" So he tells me, \"Well ... it depends ... Rabbeinu Tam says yes; Rabbeinun Metumtam says maybe only if it's a specific type of tissue and only if you have a bad cold, not a good cold...\"</p>\n\n<p>OMG!

Come on, rabbi, all I want is a \"yes\" or \"no\".</p>\n\n<p>Seriously, if your rabbi can't give you a straight answer on a somewhat simple question, imagine what things will be like if you have to ask him a tough question!

It is for this reason that the Mishnah (Eruvin 3:5) uses the example of a Rabbi coming to town in its discussion of conditional Eruvei Techumin. </p>\n\n<p>Now, we hold that Techumin are d’Rabbanan (Sotah 30b). By this logic, then, if one is unsure if the Rabbi is in the Techum, we can apply Safek d’Rabbanan l’Kula and therefore you can assume that he is. </p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s say that you call up your Rabbi, or Skype him, or send him an email. In these scenarios, it’s necessary that both you and your phone/computer are within the same Techum, and that your Rabbi and his phone/computer are within the same Techum. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s say that both you and your Rabbi are outside of the Techum; in this instance, you must be within each other’s Daled Amos. </p>\n\n<p>As for the source that it’s until the Techum? That would be Shemos 33:7:</p>\n\n<p>‎> וּמֹשֶׁה֩ יִקַּ֨ח אֶת־הָאֹ֜הֶל וְנָֽטָה־ל֣וֹ ׀ מִח֣וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶ֗ה הַרְחֵק֙ מִן־הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה וְקָ֥רָא ל֖וֹ אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֑ד וְהָיָה֙ כָּל־מְבַקֵּ֣שׁ יְהוָ֔ה יֵצֵא֙ אֶל־אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵ֔ד אֲשֶׁ֖ר מִח֥וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃\n></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Moshe took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, a distance away from the camp, and he called it the Tent If Meeting. Anyone who sook out Hashem would go out to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi there notes, Moshe’s tent was 2000 Amos outside the camp. Why is this important? Because if it was any further, it would be outside the Techum, and his rulings would be invalid. Note that based on this source, all of these halachos are true even during the week, not just on Shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>I should note, though, that it’s not that his decisions aren’t <em>binding</em>, per se, so much as them not being considered <em>rulings.</em> Therefore, it’s only rulings issued outside the Techum which are invalid, not the ones previously or subsequently made inside the Techum. It’s a deficiency in the <em>ruling</em>, rather than the <em>person</em> issuing them - in Yeshivish, a chisaron in the cheftza, not the gavra. </p>\n\n<p>Note that none of this is applicable when there are no competent Rabbis in your area. In that situation, you may receive a psak from outside your Techum, as the d’Oraisa of learning Torah overrides the d’Rabbanan of learning Purim Torah. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I neglected to mention the halachos of sending a shliach to ask the question for you. Since we hold shelucho shel adam kimoso, all of these halachos would apply equally to the shliach, rather than the one who sent him. </p>\n\n\n",

However, Rashi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.9a.23?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Moed_Katan.9a.23.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mo'ed Katan end of 9a</a>) holds that one performs a <em>mitzvah</em> even if it will prevent the performance of another <em>mitzvah</em> which is greater than it. According to Rashi, it would seem to make sense to listen to the Megillah at night, as this is the <em>mitzvah</em> that comes first. (Following Rashi, the Radbaz in Responsa 4:13 ruled that someone in prison, who was given one day \"out\" of his choice, should not wait until any particular Holiday or other time when optimal <em>mitzvah</em> performance could be achieved, but rather should take off for the performance of whatever <em>mitzvah</em> opportunity comes first.)</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.687.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 687:3</a>) indeed brings this line of reasoning regarding this exact question, and says that even though the daytime reading is primary, one would not bypass the night reading for the sake of the daytime reading because we do not bypass any mitzvah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאף על גב דקריאת היום הוא העיקר, מכל מקום לא יעבור על המצוה, ויקראנה בלילה שהיא קודמת, ואין מעבירין על המצות. וכן נראה לי עיקר לדינא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the Sefas Emes writes that the entire point of the night reading is to prepare for the day, and that in the event that there will not be a daytime reading, for whatever reason, there is no mitzvah to read at night:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואפשר דהא דאמר ולשנותה משום דעיקר מצותה ביום היא והקריאה בלילה היא רק שיהיה ביום קריאה שניה ונפקא מינה דהיכא דביממא לא יהיה עליו חיוב גם בלילה פטור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it would make sense to prefer the daytime reading, for if one reads only the night reading, they end up with no mitzvah at all.</p>\n\n\n",

The 19 year cycle only refers to the positions of the 13-month years in those cycles. These years are the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years of the cycle. Any of those years can be either 383, 384, or 385 days long.</p>\n  \n  <p>Moreover all periods of 19 Hebrew years can be either 6938, 6939, 6940, 6941, or 6942 days each. Since none of these values are exact multiples of 7 it follows that no two consecutive periods of 19 years can begin on the same day of the week. Hence, the Hebrew calendar clearly does not repeat itself after every 19 years.</p>\n  \n  <p>At one time some authorities suggested that the calendar would repeat itself after every 13 cycles of 19 years, that is, once every 247 years. However, simple arithmetic shows that the 247 year cycle is short by 905 halaqim (about 50 minutes) and therefore cannot be a full repetition cycle.</p>\n  \n  <p>Periods of 247 Hebrew years can be either 90214d, 90215d, or 90216d. The period of 90,216d is a complete number of weeks and occurs 98% of the time over the full Hebrew calendar repetition cycle.</p>\n  \n  <p>The true calendar repetition cycle is 689,472 Hebrew years long, requiring 36,288 cycles of 19 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not aware of any online resources that list years together with their length, but I happen to have created a helpful calendar in Excel, and have made the first 6000 years available as a Google Sheet <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GQw5RHfE3DVf_ZyYq2Ekj_6_u-Hdl2X-0H6UpsNwY7g\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For your purposes, you would want to look up the relevant year number in column B and then move across to column G to see whether the year is shleimah, kesidrah or chaseirah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Affliction and refraining from work",
    "content": "# Affliction and refraining from work\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Leviticus 23 describes some commands in regards to Yom Kippur in which it teaches us to afflict ourselves (verse 27). Although I'm familiar with most of the commentaries which teach what this '<em>affliction of ourselves</em>' mean, I noticed something else. </p>\n\n<p>It explicitly says (vers 28-30) that <strong>no manner of work</strong> (melachah) can be done, because it's Yom Kippur a day to make atonement for ourselves before HaShem our G-d. For whatsoever soul it be that shall not <strong>be afflicted</strong> in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people and whatsoever soul it be that doeth <strong>any manner of work</strong> in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people. </p>\n\n<p>There seem to be some connection between work or not working and between to afflict or not to afflict. </p>\n\n<p>And it doesn't seem to stop here it goes on with verse 31: Ye shall do <strong>no manner of work</strong>; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. And again states in verse 32: It shall be unto you a sabbath of <strong>solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls</strong>; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.</p>\n\n<p><em>Why is it so important to afflict oneself in 'rest'? Why this connection between the two?</em> </p>\n\n<p>P.s.\nIsaiah 58 seems to describe a situation in which people follow or pursue their own interests, one example of this is by <strong>letting others work</strong> for themselves while they were fasting (<strong>while working is forbidden</strong>, like it's on a Shabat; and everyone and every living thing has to rest, see also verse 13). Adventually they find themselves surprised that HaShem didn't recognize their fast, but they should not have let others work for themselves on that particular day.</p>\n\n<p>And then HaShem asks: \nIs such the fast that I have chosen, the day for a man to afflict his soul?\nWilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Me? To continue by stating: \"Is not this the fast that I have chosen..\" after which HaShem explains that one has to refrain himself from things that really matter. </p>\n\n<p>This story seem to relate to the affliction, but it clearly states that fasting alone isn't sufficient and that one has to refrain from a lot of things and keep from any work on a shabat (a day of rest), from pursuing one's own business on His holy day (verse 13). </p>\n\n<p><em>So again why is the link between refraining and keeping rest so important?</em> </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've heard the following inference drawn from the words of Rambam in support of the point you're making. (I'm afraid I can't recall where or when I heard this.)</p>\n\n<p>First, note that Rambam gave the section of laws dealing with Yom Kippur in his Mishneh Torah the title \"Hilchot Shevitat Asor\" (the Laws of Refraining on the Tenth [of Tishrei]). In this section, he discusses the laws of Yom Kippur in terms of <em>shevita</em> (refraining) from both work and physical pleasures.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Rest_on_the_Tenth_of_Tishrei.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 1 Law 1</a> he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצות עשה <strong>לשבות</strong> ממלאכה בעשור לחודש השביעי שנאמר שבת שבתון הוא לכם</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a positive commandment to <strong>refrain</strong> from work on the tenth of the seventh month, as it states \"it shall be a Sabbath of rest for you\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Rest_on_the_Tenth_of_Tishrei.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Law 4</a> he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצות עשה אחרת יש ביום הכיפורים, והיא <strong>לשבות</strong> בו מאכילה ושתייה שנאמר תענו את נפשותיכם</p>\n  \n  <p>There is another positive commandment on Yom Kippur, and that is to <strong>refrain</strong> from eating and drinking, as it states, \"Afflict your souls\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The message that I think emerges is that afflicting ourselves on Yom Kippur is not some independent idea of \"mortification of the flesh\". Rather, it exists on a continuum together with the restrictions in place on other holy days during the year.</p>\n\n<p>If on <em>shabbat</em>, we refrain from interacting with the outside world in a creative sense, in order to create a space in which to better be able to focus on the spiritual, on Yom Kippur we take that one step further and refrain from any sort of involvement with our material needs, and spend the day totally immersed in the spiritual realm.</p>\n\n\n",

But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, for the adversary is not worthy that the king be endamaged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>None of this should be news to Achashverosh; Haman already told him about his plot to kill the Jews. The only new information here is that the queen herself is Jewish. So why does this information suddenly enrage Achashverosh against Haman? If anything, Esther was the one who withheld information. It's not even clear to me that Haman knew about Esther's relationship to Mordekhai and thus her Jewishness.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Haman never said \"the Jews\"; he just said \"some small people out there.\" Technically true ... but Achashverosh didn't think he meant <em>that</em> people.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim observes that Haman offered <em>l'abdam</em> -- \"to make them go away.\" It could have been interpreted as a massive social education/assimilation effort, especially in the context of the verse -- \"they act differently than anyone else.\" Or at least ...

Fortunately, this didn't happen in Persia at the time. But, when Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, Spain suffered great economic downfall, afterwards.

If we take their opinion into account, the question would then be how far to take what they're saying.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I subsequently discovered that the answer to my question is basically addressed in the Gemarra in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.26a.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 26a</a> (and 32b, see below):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במתנוונה דרך אברים מהו דתימא הא זנויי זנאי והא דלא בדקוה מיא כי אורחיה משום <strong>דבאונס זנאי</strong> ולגבי כהן אסירא קא משמע לן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemarra says that the Mishnah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.24a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on 24a</a>) is discussing the case where a woman, after drinking the <em>sotah</em> waters, starts to deteriorate in an unusual manner (unlike a normal <em>sotah</em>), she is permitted to her husband who is a Kohen (and obviously then a woman married to a regular Jew as well). What's the <em>chiddush</em> (novelty)?</p>\n\n<p>I would have thought that since she's deteriorating abnormally, even though she wasn't intentionally adulterous, we can say that <strong>she was raped while in seclusion with this other man</strong>. Since a raped woman is forbidden to her Kohen husband, this woman should be forbidden to him. The Mishnah teaches us that this is not true. But in what way is this not true?</p>\n\n<p>According to the Mishneh LaMelech (Sotah 3:24), there are two ways to understand it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If she was raped <strong>she would have died</strong> like any other <em>sotah</em>. Since she didn't, she must not have been raped, and is permitted if her husband is a Kohen.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <em>sotah</em> water <strong>doesn't test for the case of rape</strong>. While it's possible that that's what happened, we aren't concerned for such a possibility.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Toras HaKinaos gives a third explanation, that if she was raped she would deserve to deteriorate in an abnormal way. Since that's what happened, maybe it's proof that she was raped (and would thus be forbidden to her Kohen husband)...comes the Mishnah to teach us that this is not a proof, as it could just be a coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>So you see from here that the default position of the Gemarra is that a <em>sotah</em> would not die if she was raped, and would be permitted to her non-Kohen husband. According to explanation #1 of the MLM, she would actually die (seemingly like the Maharal and Penei Yehoshua). According to explanation #2, she would not die, as the sotah waters don't test for this case. This is also the opinion of the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sotah.20a?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 4:4</a>), codified by the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Woman_Suspected_of_Infidelity.3.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Sotah 3:24</a>). It's also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Sotah.32b.5.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's</a> understanding of the Bavli (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.32b.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32b</a>). I didn't check if others understand differently. According to the explanation of Toras HaKinaos, she also would not die if she was raped.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the Toras HaKinaos, asks from this Gemarra on the Penei Yehoshua, that if she is treated as an intentional adulteress, why doesn't she die when she drinks the <em>sotah</em> waters? You see from his question that he doesn't see room to differentiate between the two (See also Yad HaMelech Sotah 3:24).</p>\n\n<p>He answers that the case of the Penei Yehoshua is where she intentionally went into seclusion, and was subsequently raped. However, the Gemarra is discussing a case where she was coerced into the seclusion as well <sup>1</sup> (my guess is the witnesses aren't aware of the coercion, but I may be wrong). This would mean then that he holds that in the Penei Yehoshua's case, she would indeed die if she drank the <em>sotah</em> waters.</p>\n\n<p>See also Tosafos Shantz to Sotah 6a, who says as a blanket statement that if a woman had consensual seclusion with a man, any resulting activity is considered consensual as well.</p>\n\n<p>Sources culled from Oz VeHadar's Mesivta Shas.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> This is how the Oz VeHadar Mesivta summarizes his words, but looking at them myself I'm not sure if this is what he is saying, I'll have to go over this again.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In light of my lack of knowledge on this subject i have tried my best to provide a source for the <strong>Maharal</strong> and <strong>Pnei Yehoshua</strong>'s opinion:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.51b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 51b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה הני נשי דגנבו גנבי שריין לגוברייהו אמרי ליה רבנן לרב יהודה והא קא ממטיאן להו נהמא מחמת יראה והא קא משלחן להו גירי מחמת יראה <strong>ודאי שבקינהו ואזלן מנפשייהו אסירן</strong></p>\n<p>Rav Yehuda said \"Woman which are kidnapped from their husbands are permitted.\"\nThe rabbis asked him \"surely they bring food to their captors and give them arrows to fight their enemies?<br />\nHe replied: \"They do so out of fear, <strong>but if they are abandoned and go back willfully to be with their captors they are forbidden to their husbands</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to imply <strong>the actual going voluntarily to someone for adulterous relations makes her forbidden to her husband</strong> (with testimony of intent and seclusion) regardless what happens afterwards as we cannot be sure, makes her forbidden to her Husband.</p>\n<p>The proof from Esther proves that even though we are 100% sure through Nevua of Mordechai she was Oneis the very going still forbids her.</p>\n<p>All this being said if she gets raped, even though she put herself in seclusion and is forbidden to her husband, she won't die from the sotah waters as the actual Biah she does not want and is oneis at that time so Hashem (who know everyone's true intentions) does not punish her as clearly indicated in by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.28b.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 28b</a> (and other places as well)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואונס רחמנא פטריה דכתיב                  ולנער [ולנערה] לא תעשה דבר אין לנער [לנערה] חטא מות...(צעקה הנער [הנערה] המארשה ואין מושיע לה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why did Esther's handmaidens fast?",
    "content": "# Why did Esther's handmaidens fast?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Esther 4:16, Esther instructs Mordechai:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צ֣וּמוּ עָ֠לַי וְאַל־תֹּאכְל֨וּ וְאַל־תִּשְׁתּ֜וּ שְׁלֹ֤שֶׁת יָמִים֙ לַ֣יְלָה וָי֔וֹם גַּם־אֲנִ֥י וְנַעֲרֹתַ֖י אָצ֣וּם כֵּ֑ן</p>\n  \n  <p>Fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night and day; also I <strong>and my handmaidens</strong> will fast thusly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand why Mordechai and the Jews should fast; they were the ones in danger, so they therefore had to fast. The same logic would apply to Esther. But why did her handmaidens fast?</p>\n\n<p>We first meet these handmaidens in 2:9 (I assume that the handmaidens Heigai gave her were the same ones she kept as queen):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאֵת֙ שֶׁ֣בַע הַנְּעָר֔וֹת הָרְאֻי֥וֹת לָֽתֶת־לָ֖הּ מִבֵּ֣ית הַמֶּ֑לֶךְ</p>\n  \n  <p>And seven handmaidens who were fitting to be given to her from the King's palace</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Megillah 13a discusses why she was given seven (and answers what \"fitting to be given to her\" means):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואת שבע הנערות וגו' אמר רבא שהיתה מונה בהן ימי שבת </p>\n  \n  <p>\"And the seven handmaidens, etc.\" Rava said: she would count with them the days of the week (and would therefore always know when Shabbos was).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For this purpose, there is no need for the handmaidens to be Jewish specifically; further, had Esther specifically requested Jewish handmaidens, she would have given away her nationality, which she specifically kept secret; in 2:10, discussing when Esther was still at the harem, the Megillah notes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לֹא־הִגִּ֣ידָה אֶסְתֵּ֔ר אֶת־עַמָּ֖הּ וְאֶת־מֽוֹלַדְתָּ֑הּ כִּ֧י מָרְדֳּכַ֛י צִוָּ֥ה עָלֶ֖יהָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־תַגִּֽיד</p>\n  \n  <p>Esther did not tell her nationality nor her birthplace, for Mordechai had commanded her not to tell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if even at that stage, Esther was careful not to reveal her nationality, she wouldn't have requested specifically Jewish handmaidens - that would have raised too many eyebrows.</p>\n\n<p>What is the other option, then? Heigai just happened to give her seven Jewish handmaidens? If he's picking them randomly, it's much more likely that few, if not none, of them would be Jewish; if he's not picking them randomly, well, why not? What advantage is there, from Heigai's perspective, of giving Esther specifically Jewish handmaidens?</p>\n\n<p>Based on this logic, then, it would seem that Esther's handmaidens, or at least most of them, weren't Jewish. Therefore, the logic behind the Jews' fasting would not apply to them. So why would Esther insist on her handmaidens' fasting?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Perhaps they fasted because they were <em>Esther's</em>, similar to how the people of Ninveh made their animals fast when they repented.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Maharal to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44288&st=&pgnum=65&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that verse</a> assumes like your two assumptions: (a) her handmaidens weren't Jewish, as that would have raised suspicion that she was Jewish and (b) no seeming purpose that they should fast.</p>\n\n<p>He infers from the end that verse which says <code>אָצ֣וּם כֵּ֑ן</code>, literally I will fast, excludes her handmaidens from her fast. He explains that while they did indeed fast, it was for a different reason.</p>\n\n<p>When she arrives at the king's palace uninvited, maybe Achashverosh will accuse her of lacking the proper fear of royalty. Esther would then be able to prove that she does have fear by stating that she's been fasting for three days as preparation, which shows she knows how serious it is coming uninvited.</p>\n\n<p>If Achashverosh were to not believe her, she could use her handmaidens as proof that she did indeed fast, for they fasted as well. So she had them fast as a backup plan to prove her integrity. I don't understand why they had to specifically fast instead of simply saying Esther fasted, maybe she worried they would lie. Then it's not clear to me how them fasting would prove anything, as maybe they're lying about that...unless it was somehow clear that they fasted.</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n95020675/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yosef Nachmiash</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_ben_Elijah_Ashkenazi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yosef Lekach</a> (to 2:9) assume that she for sure had Jewish handmaidens.</p>\n\n\n",

How would the story have been different? Esther still would have been queen. Haman still would have wanted to kill the Jews. Mordechai and Esther still would have had their fasts and their conversation. Esther still would have asked Achashveirosh and Haman to her parties, at the latter of which she still would have had Haman killed.</p>\n\n<p>I see two differences between these two plotlines. First, if Mordechai wasn't in the king's book, then the parade wouldn't have happened, obviously. But more importantly, if Achashveirosh could sleep that night, not having an unsettled account rattling around in the back of his mind, Haman would not have been able to ask about the gallows in any event; and if Achashveirosh couldn't sleep, perhaps the officers would have been able to get him to sleep with the Royal Chronicles, which was their goal even as the story actually played out. So ultimately, while that night would have played out differently, the end result presumably would have been the same.</p>\n\n<p>The second one is Charvonah's jumping in at the end of the second banquet. If Haman was trying to kill Mordechai, who had saved the king, what else would Haman do? So Achashveirosh killed Haman. But let's say that Mordechai never saved the king. Charvonah still might have accomplished something: after all, Mordechai was still an advisor to the King, as we see from 2:19:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּמָרְדֳּכַ֖י יֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּשַֽׁעַר־הַמֶּֽלֶךְ</p>\n  \n  <p>And Mordechai was sitting in the palace gates</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>as explained by Megillah 13a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אזיל שקל עצה ממרדכי אמר אין אשה מתקנאה אלא בירך חבירתה ואפי' הכי לא גליא ליה</p>\n  \n  <p>[Achashveirosh] went to get advice from Mordechai [on how to get Esther to tell her nationality]. [Mordechai] said: \"Nothing makes a woman jealous like the thigh of her friend.\" But even so, she did not reveal to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Achashveirosh obviously held Mordechai in high regard anyway, Charvonah still may have had his intended effect.</p>\n\n<p>So what part of the story would have been different had the Bigsan and Seresh subplot not happened? (That is to say, they never plotted to kill the king.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>If Mordechai never discovered the Bigsan and Seresh plot, then he would have (presumably) been executed by Haman. </p>\n\n<p>When Haman came to ask the king permission to hang Mordechai, the king interrupted him (before Haman could reveal he wanted Mordechai dead) and proceeded to reward Mordechai. Haman from that moment on (it wasn't the parade that mattered) would never have the guts to mention killing Mordechai again. Even if the king was asleep, Haman would have come in the morning to secure Mordechai's death warrant instead. He would have been granted it, since Mordechai was violating the king's order to bow down to Haman. </p>\n\n<p>So, with Mordechai's death, the Jews would not have a powerful representative at court. So, when the new decree would be issued allowing the Jews to stand up and defend themselves, the enemies would not have been so intimidated by it. But, with Mordechai as leader, they were intimidated. The Megillah mentions proof to this by reciting how much the people were in awe and respectful of Mordechai and his power etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>To add to the excellent answer by David Kenner, note that Charvonah, when reporting the gallows, notes that it was built to hang Mordechai <em>who spoke good to the king</em> (I.e. saved his life!)\nI remember seeing somewhere that this was an important part in ensuring Homon's immediate execution, as it made it appear he was planning a coup.\nThe need for his immediate execution being important both to prevent any chance of him avoiding it if he went on trial etc, and  also to immediately undermine the standing of his pet project to massacre the Jews.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Malbim, the whole reason why Achashveirosh promoted Haman to second-in-command was because Haman took credit for saving Achashveirosh’s life.

    "content": "# \"If eight couldn't save the world, certainly eight couldn't save one city.\" Why not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi to Bereishis 18:32, explaining why Avraham only bargained for 10 and no less:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָמַר דוֹר הַמַּבּוּל הָיוּ ח', נֹחַ וּבָנָיו וּנְשֵׁיהֶם, וְלֹא הִצִּילוּ עַל דּוֹרָם; וְעַל ט' עַל יְדֵי צֵרוּף כְּבָר בִּקֵשׁ וְלֹא מָצָא</p>\n  \n  <p>He said, \"The generation of the Flood had eight [righteous people] - Noach, his [three] sons, and their [altogether four] wives - and they were unable to save their generation.\" He did not ask for nine plus Hashem, because he already asked that [when he asked for 45 to save the area].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why is this true? Maybe eight (nine) have sufficient merit to save a city, but not the entire world. If the argument went the other way, I could hear that, but the way it's written, it seems backwards.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/64973/how-is-it-that-abraham-didnt-ask-that-four-save-a-city-yet-four-did-so\">This related question</a> asks why Lot was successful with just four, while Avraham wasn't able to argue that. While it's a similar question, what I'm asking is that Avraham's own logic doesn't seem to make sense - the reason he has not to plead further seemingly isn't a valid argument.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>1) The simple answer is that the 8 righteous people by the flood didn't save the world, <strong><em>or any part of it</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If Abraham could point to the flood history and say that the waters washed away everything <strong><em>except</em></strong> downtown Akkad, then you would expect him to try and find 8 decent Sodomites to save a city. However, since the 8 righteous by the flood saved no one at all, Abraham dropped that argument.</p>\n\n<p>2) The OP argues that if 8 could not not save a world, then maybe they could at least save a smaller amount, like a city?</p>\n\n<p>I would argue just the opposite. If a mere city should be destroyed as wicked, but the rest of the world is preserved, then why should that city be spared due to merits of the righteous? Maybe its a special exception to justice, to invoke the merits of the righteous when saving something big, like the entire world? Who says that justice would allow mercy when only a town is at stake?</p>\n\n<p>3) Finally, check verse 29 with Rashi. Since your question is against Rashi, we can look into the previous Rashi to see where he is coming from here.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi says that Abraham's argument for finding 40, 30, 20, and 10 righteous would only save 4, 3, 2, or 1 town respectively. </p>\n\n<p>Also, Abraham never asks that the righteous around the world should help Sodom survive.</p>\n\n<p>We see from here that Rashi understood that Divine Justice was viewing each individual Sodomite town, as its own private world. Each town was treated as trying to save a whole world, not just a town. Therefore, Abraham could compare the 8 righteous of the flood and their world, to one town in Sodom.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

The comment to line 52 regarding the typo mentioned by the OP in the book states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although the MSS are almost unanimous in reading <em>twenty eight years</em> here, the error is clearly one of transmission, not that of ibn Daud himself, as thought by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azariah_dei_Rossi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">De Rossi</a>, <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300079067/the-light-of-the-eyes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Me'or 'Einayim</em></a>, ch. 35.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One can see that this is a typo of the copyists, because Yehoshaphat's reign is included in the 433 years that the first Temple stood (line 20 in Cohen's edition of ShQ). It requires that Yehoshaphat's reign be 25 years. Moreover, R' Abraham ibn Daud intended his book to defend the Rabbinic tradition against attacks of the Karaites who would certainly note the divergence with the verse.</p>\n\n\n",

The idea that non-procreative sex is forbidden comes from St.Paul's misreading of Onan and has absolutely no basis in Judaisim.</p>\n\n<p>Jewish men are <em>biblically</em> commanded to  provide our wives with sexual pleasure as the mitzvah of <em>onah</em>; this includes during pregnancy (when they are unable to get more pregnant) and even acts that cannot lead to pregnancy. It would be easy to cite the Rambam on this, but I'm going to go with another source:</p>\n\n<p>\"Ra’avad, Ba’alei Hanefesh, Gate of Holiness – selection 4</p>\n\n<p>הארבע כוונות אשר המעשה ההוא נכון עליהם.</p>\n\n<p>הראשונה לשם פריה ורביה והיא הנכונה שבכולם…</p>\n\n<p>והשנית לתקון הולד… וגם זו הכוונה נמשכת בכונת פריה ורביה.</p>\n\n<p>והשלישית אף על פי שאין בה לא זה ולא זה אלא שהיא משתוקקת אליו… גם על זו יש קבול שכר והיא היא מצות העונה שאמרה התורה, דמיון שארה וכסותה לא יגרע שהם צרכי האשה והנאותיה.</p>\n\n<p>והרביעית שהוא מתכוין לגדור את עצמו בה כדי שלא יתאוה לעבירה…</p>\n\n<p>ואם לא נתכוון כי אם למלאות תאותו מן הנאות העולם הנה הוא בדרך הסתת היצר ורחוק מן השכר וקרוב להפסד…</p>\n\n<p>ואחרי שראינו כל אלה שהאדם חייב לעשות חפצי אשתו ולשמחה במצוה זו בכל עת שהיא צריכה לה, על כן הזהירוהו שתהא שמאל דוחה וימין מקרבת פן תסיתנו לעבור על המדה ותמשכהו אחריה אל הבלי העולם ויאבד בעבורה.  </p>\n\n<p>The four intentions (or “motivations”) which are proper for that act (of marital sex) [are as follows]:</p>\n\n<p>The first is for the sake of procreation, and this is the most proper of all the intentions…</p>\n\n<p>The second is for the well-being of the fetus [when the wife is pregnant]… and this intention is connected to the intention for procreation.</p>\n\n<p>The third is even in a case when neither of the above two apply, but merely that the wife is longing for her husband… even in this case there is reward in the act (i.e., it is a religiously positive act), and this is the Biblical mitzvah of onah. It is comparable to the mitzvah “thou shall not withhold her food and clothing,” for these are the things that the wife needs and which give her pleasure.</p>\n\n<p>The fourth is if he is intending to protect himself so that his sexual desire does not lead him to sin (so he gives licit outlet to this desire through sex with his wife)…</p>\n\n<p>But if his only intent is to satisfy his sexual desire with this-worldly pleasures, then he is following his evil inclination. Such an the act is distant from any reward and close to being a loss (i.e., a religiously negative act)\"…</p>\n\n<p>( \n )</p>\n\n<p>Now, if he has not fulfilled his obligation to be fruitful and multiply, some may rule he is required to divorce his wife and marry a non-menopausal woman. But as long as they are married, he is not only permitted to have relations with her, he is commanded by the mitzvah of <em>onah</em> to do so</p>\n\n<p>The sin referred to in your question may be less literlly but more accurately translated to as \"wasting\" seed as opposed to spilling it; preventing the creation of new life is not the reason it is forbidden, indeed, kaballistic sources wouls argue that it does indeed create new life in the form of demons and evil spirits.</p>\n\n\n",

The analysis of seven vowels, rather than five vowels with diphthongs, is for clarity, and to correspond with the Hebrew orthography.)</p>\n\n<p>For comparison, Sefaradim (and modern Israeli speakers) pronounce both Ashkenazi /a/ and /ɔ/ as /a/, and /e/ and /ɛ/ as /e/ (except for <em>kamatz katan</em>, which Ashkenazim pronounce /ɔ/ and Sefaradim pronounce /o/).</p>\n\n<p>The vowel <em>patach</em> (IPA /a/) and the vowel <em>kamatz</em> (/ɔ/) are distinct in this version of Hebrew, and both are distinct from the <em>cholam</em> (/o/). Using the five orthographic vowels a, e, i, o and u inevitably forces anyone transcribing seven different vowels to either use digraphs (e.g. ei, ou), accents (e.g. ê, ô) or simply to leave the distinction between the different sounds ambiguous. The choice of <em>o</em> to transliterate the <em>kamatz</em> is simply the third option. This transliteration obviously doesn't imply they pronounce it the same as the <em>cholam</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Since this is the traditional pronunciation for Ashkenazim, presumably they do their best to preserve it when reciting Shema and other prayers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It depends on what havarah (pronunciation) you use. Ashkenazim pronounce the vowel kamatz as somewhere between an \"o\" and \"aw\", whereas Sephardim pronounce it as \"ah\". Therefore the Hebrew word ישראל becomes \"Yisro'eil\" in Ashkenazi and \"Yisra'el\" in Sephardi. As for Ashkenazim saying \"Yisroel\", this is because it's difficult to say \"Yisro'eil\" quickly and therefore it generally becomes slurred until the tzeirei becomes an \"eh\". </p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Talmud there analyzes this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רמי רב טובי בר רב קיסנא לרבא תנן כל העושה מצוה אחת מטיבין לו עשה אין\n  לא עשה לא ורמינהי ישב ולא עבר עבירה נותנים לו שכר כעושה מצוה אמר ליה\n  התם כגון שבא דבר עבירה לידו וניצול הימנה</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Tobi son of R. Kisna pointed out a contradiction to Raba: We\n  learnt: HE WHO PERFORMS ONE PRECEPT IS WELL REWARDED; hence, only if\n  he [actively] performs it, but not otherwise. But the following\n  contradicts this: If he sits and commits no transgression he is\n  rewarded as though he has fulfilled a precept! — Said he to him: There\n  it means, e.g., that he was tempted and successfully resisted. (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi there explains that you get rewarded for not doing an aveira when an opportunity to do one is presented to you and you overcome the temptation to do it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>התם שבא דבר עבירה לידו. ההוא ישב ולא עבר עבירה דקאמר נוטל עליה שכר\n  בעבירה שבא לידו וכפה יצרו ולא עבר אין מצוה יתירה מזו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the case of one who does not know that he left sheaves behind, how is it any better than anyone else who was ישב ולא עבר עבירה, for which the Talmud concludes there is no reward? Only if the person knows that he forgot the sheaves and he still does not go back to retrieve them, would he then be in the category of בא דבר עבירה לידו וניצול הימנה for which the Talmud states that he would receive reward.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Sefer Hachinuch states (mitzvah # 592) explicitly that the positive commandment is to leave the sheaves <strong>once you are made aware</strong> that you forgot them:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שנצטוינו כשנשכח עומר בשדה להניחו שם ולא נשוב לקחתו <strong>כשיודע אלינו\n  הדבר</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I’m not clear if the new moon that starts the month had to occur after the equinox. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisan-years\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Technically, its New Years Day is the day after the New Moon closest to (<strong>within fifteen days before or after</strong>) the Vernal Equinox (Spring Equinox, when the day and the night is of equal length, set at March 21 in the Gregorian Calendar). It begins the first month, named Nisanu/Nisan/Abib. The month of Nisan is important since it begins the Spring Feasts of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What was the official rule in the days of Sanhedrin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Following is based on a summary of what I recall from Ramba\"m hilchot Birkat Hachodesh. I will, iy\"h, add more specific info, later.</p>\n\n<p>Ramba\"m mentions that the primary concern is to have Pesach (15 Nissan) occur in the spring (i.e., after the equinox) since the Torah refers to Pesach as <em>Chodesh Ha'aviv</em>. The concern is not regarding the 1st day of Nissan, so, in most cases, that date occurred before the equinox. Sanhedrin would declare a leap year if the 15th of Nissan occurred before the equinox, Since this adds an extra month, by doing this, Rosh Hodesh Nissan now most likely occurs after the equinox, as well. </p>\n\n<p>Sanhedrin could also declare a leap year for other reasons such as the barley has not yet ripened. Barley was needed for the omer offering on the 16th of Nissan. If heavy rains knocked out bridges so that it became too difficult for many people to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Sanhedrin may declare that year a leap year, too even if without it, 15 Nissan would be after the equinox, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, we are on a fixed calendar. In most non-leap years, Rosh Hodesh Nissan occurs before the equinox. When Pesach is at its earliest (I think the earliest Gregorian date I have seen is March 26) it is barely after the equinox. Of course, if it is not, that year, on the fixed calendar becomes a leap year.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the Judaic fixed calendar historically, you will notice a \"seasonal shift\" in that the 1st day of Pesach is slowly getting later on the Gregorian calendar. (There's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/71333\">a separate M.Y. question</a> discussing this, if you're interested.) Thus, currently year 8 in the 19 year Judaic calendar cycle has the latest Gregorian date for Pesach. This year is a leap year, which, currently, could be eliminated as without it, Pesach would still be after the equinox. However, when the fixed calendar was created millennia ago, that year needed to be a leap year. We haven't changed the fixed calendar system at all. However, assuming that we kept it this way eternally, we would need to adjust things as at some point Pesach would occur in the fall season.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the Babylonian calendar, which Jews used in the late pre-exilic, exilic, and early post-exilic periods, the month of Nisanu always began after the equinox by our definition, though not always by the Babylonians' definition.</p>\n<p>In the Herodian period, according to Josephus, it is the 14th of Nisan that falls on or after the equinox:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the month of Xanthicus, which with us is called Nisan and begins the year, on the fourteenth day by lunar reckoning, the sun being then in Aries, our lawgiver, seeing that in this month we were delivered from bondage to the Egyptians, ordained that we should year by year offer the same sacrifice which...we offered then on departure from Egypt. <em>Antiquities</em> 3.10.5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tosefta gives the rule that the 16th of Nisan was to fall on or after the equinox:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The year is not to be intercalated unless the spring equinox is still distant the greater part of a month.  How much is the greater part of a month?  Sixteen days.  R. Jehuda says: two-thirds of a month, twenty days.  Tosefta <em>Sanhedrin</em> 2.7</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fixed Rabbinic calendar has already been covered by DanF in his answer.</p>\n\n\n",

I am well aware that it is possible to be mechalek between birth by a mother and creation of a robot using machines and technology, but I thought there also might be makom to compare the two and hence thought I would throw this out there as food for thought. edit - the user called 'Alex' messaged me that the Chacham Tzvi says a similar sevara, that a being created through the sefer yetzira may be considered jewish if it/he/she was created by a jew.</p>\n\n\n",

Shlomo Ganzfried, author of Kitzur [SA]) brings a support for those\nwho permit women to write a Megilla from the verse “Then Esther wrote”\n(Esther 9:29), the source from which Megilla 19a derives the law that\na Megilla must be written like a Torah scroll. He concludes that\nle-khatĥila, one should use a Megilla that was written by a man, in\norder to satisfy all opinions. Be-di’avad, however, when the only\navailable Megilla was written by a woman, one may read from it and\neven recite the berakhot over it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>@DoubleAA (in comments) notes the Avnei Nezer actually retracts his position later in responsum #518 and R Akiva Eiger only says he isn't sure why the Shulchan Arukh permitted it.

However, the Gemara equates a number of the laws of Megillah with those of a Sefer Torah, deriving each law from a separate verse (see Megillah 16b, 19a). Since a woman is disqualified to write a Sefer Torah, the question is whether the equations of Megillah to Sefer Torah are the exceptions or the rule. This is a dispute among the Rishonim.</p>\n<p>The Ramban (Megillah 17a) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וי\"ל מגילה נקראת ספר ונקראת אגרת, ולא\nידעינן לאיזה דבר הוקשה לספר ולאיזה דבר הוקשה לאגרת...  <strong>ואמרו בירושלמי מה בין ספרים למגילת\nאסתר אלא שהספרים נכתבים בכל לשון ומגילת אסתר אינה נכתבת אלא אשורית הא\nלכל דבריהם זה וזה שוין</strong>, וכ\"כ רב אחא משבחא בשאלתות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל ר' משה הספרדי\nז\"ל אמר שא\"צ עבוד לשמה, שמא הוא סבור לומר דלשמה כיון דאינו דבר הניכר\nבה כלל אינו כדברים שמגופה וכדברים שהן בה ואינן מגופה, אלא כדברים שהן\nחוץ לגופה ודינה בה כדין אגרת, אבל הירושלמי שכתבתי יקשה עליו, אא\"כ יאמר\nדקולי ספרים קתני חומרי לא קתני, ואינו מחוור כלל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ומסתברא שלא הקלו משום אגרת אלא בפסול שאינו מתפשט בכולה</strong>, כגון תפירה\nמקצתה בגידין כדין ספר ומקצתה בפשתן משום אגרת. ומזה אמרו דהשמיט בה\n,הסופר אותיות או פסוק, וקראן הקורא כמתורגמן, יצא. והוינן בה קראן על פה\nומתרצינן לא קשיא הא בכולה הא במקצתה, דכיון דפסול דמקצת היא, כשרה כאגרת,\nשאלו בס\"ת שהשמיט בו אות אחת פסול, אלא קל הוא שהקילו במגילה משום אגרת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Ramban, the general rule is that the laws of Sefer Torah apply to Megillah (with some exceptions). If so, the law that a Sefer Torah written by a woman is <em>pasul</em> would apply to Megillah as well (at least if it was written wholly by a woman). This is also the clear position of Rabbenu Tam, cited by the Tur (OC 691):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ור\"ת ז\"ל כתב <strong>כיון דנקראת ספר נותנים לה כל דין ס\"ת חוץ ממה שמפרש\nבהדיא, דהיינו שאם הטיל בה ג' חוטי גידין כשרה, אבל לכל שאר הדברים היא\nכספר תורה</strong>, לענין עיבוד לשמה והיקף גויל וחטוטרת חתי\"ן ותליית ההי\"ן\nוקופי\"ן וכל גופות האותיות כצורתן וזיונן של שעטנז ג\"ץ ובחסירות\nויתרות וצריכה עמוד בראשה וחלק בסופה כדי להקיפה בו הכל כס\"ת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, the implication of the Rambam (Hilchot Megillah 2:9) is that a woman can write a Megillah, since he lists only the invalidation of goy and min:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>או שכתבה גוי או מין, פסולה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maggid Mishneh explains that the Rambam only equates Megillah to a Sefer Torah for those things which the Gemara mentions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין העור שלה וכו'. זה פשוט שלא נזכר בה עבוד <strong>ואינה כס\"ת אלא\nלדברים שהשוה לו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If so, we can understand why a woman would be valid to write a Megillah.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is the argument of the Chida (<em>Birkei Yosef</em> 691:6) to allow women to write the Megillah: Since the Shulchan Aruch cites the Rambam's view that <em>lishmah</em> is not required for Megillah as primary, based on the Maggid Mishneh we can infer that women are allowed to write the Megillah as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש להסתפק אשה שכתבה מגילה, מי מדמינן לספר תורה להא נמי ופסולה, או\nדילמא ספר תורה שאני, והמגילה כשרה? ולכאורה נראה להכשיר, ממ\"ש התוס'\nבגיטין דף מ\"ד, אהא דאמרינן סתו\"ם שכתבן עכו\"ם וכו' ואשה וכו' פסולין,\nשנאמר וקשרתם וכתבתם, כל שישנו בקשירה ישנו בכתיבה, וכו' דדוקא בסתו\"ם\nדרשינן הכי וכו', אבל שאר נביאים לא. והוא הדין נימא גבי מגילה שכתבה אשה\nכשרה. אך אין ראיה מזה, דהא לכמה מילי מקישינן מגילה לס\"ת. אבל ראיתי\nלהרמב\"ם שכתב פ\"ב דמגילה דין ט' ואין העור שלה צריכה עבוד וכו'. וכתב הרב\nהמגיד זה פשוט, שלא נזכר בה עבוד, ואינו כספר תורה אלא לדברים שהשוה בו,\nעכ\"ל. וכפי זה אפשר להכשיר זו מגילה ניתנה ליכתב ביד אשה, <strong>שהרי לא הוזכרה\nהך פיסולא דאשה לכתיבת המגילה, וכללא כייל לן הה\"מ דאינה כס\"ת אלא לדברים\nשהושוה בו</strong>. ואף דבהא דעבוד איכא רבוואתא דפליגי, מ\"מ מרן סתם בסמוך\nכהרמב\"ם, דאין העור צריך עיבוד לשמה. וידוע דדעת מרן כסברא דכתב בסתם.\nוכ\"כ הפר\"ח, דיש להכשיר בדיעבד, וכוותייהו נקטינן. ולסברת הרמב\"ם כבר כתב\nהרב המגיד דאין לנו במגילה אלא מאי דאתמר בהדיא דהויא כספר תורה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the Chida's argument is based on the opinion that Megillah does not require <em>lishmah</em>. If so, since Ashkenazi pesak follows the second view of the Shulchan Aruch, that Megillah requires lishmah (at least <em>lechatchilah</em>), it would follow that Ashkenazim should not accept the position of the Birkei Yosef regarding women writing a Megillah (<em>lechatchilah</em>). This is also the position of the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6930&st=&pgnum=97&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillas Sefer</a> by R. Moshe Meir Perles, who was asked by R. Dovid Oppenheim whether the latter's daughter's megillah was kosher.</p>\n<p>There may be another possibility for why women can write a Megillah even though they cannot write a Sefer Torah. A woman cannot write a Sefer Torah based on the principle of כל שישנו בקשירה ישנו בכתיבה (Menachot 42b). However, since women are obligated in the Megillah, perhaps they should be allowed to write it as well (this is the argument of the <em>Pri Megadim</em>). This was the position of R. Dovid Oppenheim himself about his daughter's megillah.</p>\n<p>However, this argument of the <em>Pri Megadim</em> depends on how we understand the extension of כל שישנו בקשירה to Sefer Torah. According to the Tosfot HaRosh (Gittin 45b), this halacha disqualifies women from halachot of writing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודוקא ס\"ת הוא דילפינן מתפלין\nומזוזה <strong>דכתיבה מכתיבה ילפינן</strong> אבל בשאר מצות לא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this reasoning, women presumably cannot write a Megillah. However, if the halacha disqualifies women from writing a sefer Torah because they are exempt from that mitzvah, then we can understand the Pri Megadim. Therefore, if we hold like R. Tam that women should not tie tzitzit because they are exempt and the halacha of כל שישנו disqualifies them, they should be allowed to write a megillah. (Cf. Avnei Nezer [OC 516] who maintains that even according to R. Tam that women may not tie tzitzit, women are invalid to write a Megillah--since a Megillah is equated to a Sefer Torah. This is based on the Avnei Nezer's understanding that Megillah is part of the distinct category of sefer Torah, tefillin and mezuzah. See also R. Michoel Elias, <em>Minchat Mordechai al HaTorah</em>, inyanei Purim; R. Mordechai Rabinovitch, <em>Tzafoh Ha-Tzafit</em>, on Aroch Ha-Shulchan cited below [n. 38]; and R. Menachem Genack, Gan Shoshanim vol. 3.)</p>\n<p>This also may depend on whether women have the same chiyuv as men. The Behag's view is that women are chayav only in שמיעה, not קריאה. Likewise according to the Turei Even women are chayav מדרבנן while men are chayav מדברי קבלה. If so, perhaps the כל שישנו בקשירה argument is insufficient for a woman to write a megillah (at least to be motzi a man). The Behag is quoted as one opinion in the Shulchan Aruch. Listen to \"<a href=\"https://app.lakewooddafyomi.com/browse/listen?type=other&id=174130000\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Can a Woman Write a Megillah</a>\" by Sruly Bornstein.</p>\n<p>The Aruch Ha-Shulchan (OC 691:3) decides in favor of the lenient view, noting that a woman is even permitted to tie tzitzit, and therefore all the more so can she create a Megillah in which she is obligated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה דגם אשה פסולה לכתיבת המגילה, אף על פי שחייבת בה, כמו שפסולה\nלכתיבת ספר תורה, תפילין, ומזוזות; אף על פי שחייבת במזוזה, וכמו כן\nמגילה (הגרע\"א). ויש מי שמכשיר (ברכי יוסף הובא בשערי תשובה).</p>\n<p>וכן נראה לי: דבשלמא בספר תורה, תפילין, ומזוזות, דרשינן \"וקשרתם...\nוכתבתם\" – כל שישנן בקשירה ישנן בכתיבה, וכל שאינן בקשירה אינן בכתיבה.\nוממילא דאשה, כיון דאינה בקשירת תפילין – אינה בכתיבה גם לענין מזוזה, אף\nשחייבת, כיון דחדא פרשה היא עם תפילין.</p>\n<p>אבל למגילה לא שייך זה. ואדרבא: כיון שחייבת – וודאי דכשרה לכתיבה. והרי\nמותרת לעשות ציצית, וסוכה, ושופר, אף על פי שפטורה מהם, וכל שכן מגילה\nשחייבת בה. וכן מבואר מהטור, ושולחן ערוך, והרמב\"ם, וכל הפוסקים שלא\nהזכירו אשה לפסול במגילה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(See also <em>Orah ve-Simchah</em>, Megillah 2:9 no. 50, who rejects the argument of the Pri Megadim for a different reason, but nevertheless accepts his conclusion.)</p>\n<p>The <em>Sdei Chemed</em> (<em>Ma'arechet Purim</em>, 12) quotes a manuscript from one of the rabbis of Jerusalem from the year 1734 which argues based on Masechet Sofrim that a woman can write the Megillah: Masechet Sofrim states that anyone who can exempt the congregation of its obligation can write the text as well (cited by Mordechai, <em>Halachot Ketanot</em>: זה הכלל, כל המוציא את הרבים ידי חובתם כותבו). This is based on the position of the Shulchan Aruch and Rambam that women can be <em>motzi</em> men in the obligation of Megillah; however, according to the Rema, who maintains based on the Behag that women cannot be <em>motzi</em> men in their obligation, it would seem based on the same Masechet Sofrim that women would not be able to write a Megillah on behalf of men either. Nevertheless, this Jerusalem rabbi concludes that even if women cannot be <em>motzi</em> men, they can still write a Megillah since they have a connection to the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>R. Moshe Sternbuch, <em>Stam ke-Hilchatan</em>, ch. 28, p. 254, argues that women may be invalid for writing a Megillah, even if Esther herself wrote the first Megillah, because the current status of Megillah differs from what was required at the time of Esther. Once the Megillah was canonized as part of <em>kitvei ha-kodesh</em>, it no longer suffices to have a Megillah which does not fulfill the requirements of <em>kitvei ha-kodesh</em>. In this respect, R. Sternbuch argues with his teacher R. Yitzchak Ze'ev Soloveitchik, who maintained that a Megillah does not need to fulfill the requirements of <em>kitvei ha-kodesh</em> in order to be used to fulfill the mitzvah of <em>keriat ha-megillah</em>.

    "content": "# Is a meal bracha over dairy forbidden if the Jew in question still has meat in their stomach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Obviously, the functional answer is you eat parve and wait for the allotted time period to pass so that one may eat dairy. I'm in no way challenging conventional dietary law.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This question is simply a hypothetical regarding whether one can acceptably make a bracha over a meal if the ingestion of that meal would then result in it becoming treif. </p>\n\n<p><em>Is the bracha for the meal as it currently exists and is prepared or is the bracha for the meal entirely in all digestive processes?</em></p>\n\n<p>If you aren't supposed to make a bracha on a meal which violates Kashrut standards, would the bracha in question be canceled out or considered improper if your ingestion of the kosher meal would result in it becoming treif in your digestive tract?</p>\n\n<p>Or does the bracha still count because the food you are praying over is still pure, even if you are eating it in an incorrect manner?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The source for not making a brachah on non-kosher or stolen food would be the Drashah on Tehillim 10:3, \".... and the robber congratulates himself for having blasphemed Hashem.\"</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch O.C. 196:1 deals with this and says we are not to make a blessing on forbidden food in the beginning or after eating, (even a Rabbinical prohibition) even if it was an accident.</p>\n\n<p>This strict opinion follows the Rambam; who learns it from the Mishnah in Berachos 7, that says we do not do the mitzvah of inviting (zimmun) on forbidden food. However the Raavad and Rosh seem to hold differently, The Raavad specifically says on the Rambam, that it may be that \"zimmun\" is not done, but why shouldn't there be a brachah? After all, the person benefited? Does the Raavad (simply reading his wording) mean to allow all blessings even if the violation was intentional?</p>\n\n<p>The Taz interprets (as understood by the Mishnah Berurah) that the proper thing to do is to follow the Raavad by allowing the after-brachah in the case of an accidental violation. But, the Shaarei Teshuvah brings the Bach that seems to hold an after blessing is always in order. Furthermore, he brings that there was an authority that allowed someone who ate a food in violation of a vow to make the after blessing. But neither case allowed a blessing in the beginning of eating. Of course others disagree. The Kaf HaChaim (attributing to other authorities like the Magen Avraham) wants to say that in certain cases of theft the violator would be obligated to recite Birkat HaMazon (while contritely repenting) so as not to add the sin of eating without thanking Hashem (D'oraisa) upon his first sin of theft! He even says that the initial blessing may be recited by uttering it in his heart without actually saying the blessing. and the S.A. and its commentaries bring other related cases and opinions that are interesting and shed more light; but I feel it would be too lengthy and not directly addressing the scope of the OP. Suffice this for background.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, does the OP's case of eating milk without waiting the customary time after eating meat, qualify as a blessing that would be \"blaspheming Hashem\" under Tehillim 10:3 and S.A. O.C. 196???</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Rema brings in Shulchan Aruch , Yoreh Deah, 89:1 that there are valid opinions who do not require waiting any time after one eats meat at all provided they finish the meat meal, make an after brachah and clean their mouth.</p>\n\n<p>This implies that someone who eats dairy right after eating meat cannot be put into the category of a \"sinner\", even though R' Yosef Caro writes that you need to wait 6 hours and even the Rema says the standard custom is 1 hour (as well as saying he agrees that 6 hours is the correct thing to do).</p>\n\n<p>So, it would seem the brachah recited on the \"pre-mature\" milk meal is not cancelled or wasted/rejected in any way. This is even true regarding someone who has a family or community custom (and such custom may even be Halachically binding; therefore I am in no way making less of a minhag) to wait a certain time and has violated it; since this custom is not universally accepted as actual mandatory Talmudic Law. In other words, it doesn't seem to be a clearly and universally forbidden D'Rabbanan act under S.A. O.C. 196:1 .</p>\n\n<p>We can draw support for this lenient position in allowing both the first blessing and after blessing (even when the eater has not waited the proper time to eat milk after meat) even in the case of \"mezid\" (intentional violation) by relying on the Kaf HaChaim 196:1(7) in the name of R' Akiva Eiger. </p>\n\n<p>S.A. Y.D. 97 says there is a Rabbinical prohibition to bake bread with milk, (and it is forbidden to eat that bread) because maybe someone will come to easily eat it with meat. (unless we make a small amount or give it an identifying shape or mark so it won't become confused) The same rules apply to bread baked with fat of meat.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Akiva Eiger (although some argue against him) says that such a Rabbinical prohibition would not be strong enough to qualify as restricting the blessings upon anyone who eats the bread in violation of YD 97. (The bread is essentially kosher on all levels, were it not for the Rabbinical fence of what it could lead to.) </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when viewing the violation of merely waiting time in between milk and meat, which is only a Halachic custom, and not an actual prohibition upon the milk food eaten but merely eating it at the wrong time, there is certainly grounds to obligate the blessing before the meal and after the meal under all circumstances; especially Birkas HaMazon, which is a mitzvah D'oraisa (if you ate enough to be satisfied/full; and a mitzvah D'Rabbanan if you ate an olive's size or more).</p>\n\n<p>Of course we should always strive to act in a way that everything we do is free of any questionable wrongdoing, and as always if you have a specific case, CYLOR.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You are right that brachos are not acceptable on food that is not kosher. However, this applies even to stolen food, so the idea is not kosher or not, the idea is that if the person is committing a sin, his brachos are not wanted (\"he is not blessing; he is taunting\"). That being said, since in your case the transgressor is committing a sin, his blessing is rejected.</p>\n\n\n",

The machine consists of a stainless steel pitcher that has a rotating \"wheel\" with an optional removable wire wisk that attaches to the wheel. The whisk is used to create extra foam. The pitcher is placed on a base that acts as both the power source as well as the heater.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming one observes the following throughout the year:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only milk is poured into the unit. (Milk is not marked as Kosher LePesach.)</li>\n<li>The unit is hand cleaned using soap and water and a clean paper towel. It does not touch the chametz sink.</li>\n<li>When pouring the milk, the unit does not touch a chametz cup and foam is spooned out using a clean plastic spoon.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Can this same unit be used during Hol Hamo'ed Pesach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If I understand correctly, let's simplify slightly: I have a pot that I used to cook regular milk (and nothing else) year-round; can I use that same pot for Pesach?</p>\n\n<p>Okay let me simplify <em>that</em> question one more step: \"on Purim, I took a brand-new pot. I poured in a gallon of water, tossed in one grain of wheat, and cooked it all for a few hours until the wheat had totally dissolved. then I washed it out really well. The pot sat, cold, clean, and empty, for a month. Now can I use that pot on Pesach? Or um, let's say it was one kernel of corn instead of wheat, and I'm Ashkenazic. Now can I use the pot?\"</p>\n\n<p>That's what this boils down to (pun intended). That year-round milk may contain trace amounts of <em>chametz</em>. (More likely vitamins that are <em>kitniyos</em>, but if it's on a line that's also producing malted milk, let's say trace amounts of chametz.) Before Pesach, such <em>chametz</em> is nullified 1:60 by volume. On Pesach, it's not.</p>\n\n<p>You could buy such milk before Pesach, at which point it's nullified, and even keep it in the fridge and drink it on Pesach. You should not, however, go to the store on Pesach and buy milk that may contain, let's say, 0.1% chametz, because on Pesach, it's not <em>batel</em>.</p>\n\n<p>When it's all said and done, standard practice is that if a pot was used for any amount of chametz -- or even kitniyos -- before Pesach, we kasher it before using it on Pesach. Which is probably your best solution here; clean it out well, wait 24 hours, then run the whole thing with boiling water.</p>\n\n\n",

A person's children's and students' deeds performed AS A RESULT OF HIS INSTRUCTIONS <em>do</em> continue to cause his neshama to be raised in Gan Eden (the commentators explain that this is why there is a final judgement day at the end of days. Although the deceased have been judged upon their death, at the end of days the full consequences of their actions will become clear.) So when one performs a mitzvah that would not have been done otherwise because of the deceased, the deceased acquires the merit of causing their good deed and hence receives additional reward (\"rises\").</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is there never a break between parshiot Parah and Hachodesh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I think Talmud Megillah mentions the various arrangements for the 4 parshiot.

I understand the placement of each of the other parshiot, and what would cause the breaks, possibly.</p>\n\n<p>However, I don't understand why Parah must always precede Hachodesh with no break, ever. Can someone explain why these two must be together?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan in OC 685 says that there are no breaks between them because they are related to each other (unlike the others, which are unrelated to the ones next to them, meaning that Zachor is unrelated to Shekalim and Parah):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל פרה וחדש שייכות זל\"ז <strong>לפיכך אין לעשות הפסקה ביניהם</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is likely due to what he explained earlier for each of them, that Parah is מטהרת את הטמאים, reminding us to become Tahor before Pesach, as is the Parsha of Hachodesh about preparing for Nisan and Pesach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Each of the 4 parshios has a specific reason when to read it. Shekalim is either on or before Rosh Chodesh Adar, Sochor is the Shabbos before Purim, Chodesh is either on or before Rosh Chodesh Nisan. \nThe <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashba_on_Megillah.30a.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashb\"a</a> in Megilla Daf 30a, quotes a Yerushalmi that Parah is supposed to really be after Chodesh since the burning of the Parah took place on the second day of Nisan, However due to the  sanctification of Israel, we precede it. However it is always the week before Chodesh. The 2 breaks split out depending on the year.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם תאמר שיקראו פרשת פרה בשבת הסמוכה לפורים ויפסיקו בינה ובין פרשת החדש אי אפשר וכדאמרינן בירושלמי (פ\"ג ה\"ה) סימן לדבר בין הכוסות הללו אם רצה לשתות ישתה בין שלישי לרביעי לא ישתה, וטעמא דמילתא כאידך דאיתמר בירושלמי (שם) דבדין היה שתקדים פרשת החדש לפרשת פרה שבאחד לחדש הוקם המשכן ולא נשרפה פרה אלא בשני אלא מפני מה הקדימוה מפני שהיא טהרתן של ישראל והלכך די לנו אם נקדים אותה שבת אחת קודם לפרשת החדש, וכיון שכן הא דתניא איזו היא שבת שלישית כל שסמוכה לפורים מאחריה על כרחין מאחרי הפורים של פרזים ושל כרכים קאמר ומפסיקין בחמשה עשר וסימן זט\"ו.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Perhaps it is this \"parsonage\" that you're thinking of?  (I don't know all the details; what I know comes from a conversation I once had with a rabbi about compensation structure.)</p>\n\n\n",

So, in order to make the sale more tangible, these rabbanim will make sure that the goy actually could, if he wanted to, get to the chometz that he bought.</p>\n\n<p>(Rav Shuchatowitz also puts on the contract where a key to the house with the chometz could be obtained. He has the appointment of agency, the contract that lets him sell the chometz, written in plain English, and specifies on it exactly who he will sell the chometz to and where he lives. You actually feel like your selling something.)</p>\n\n<p>All this is to drive home to the seller that there is a serious transaction going on here. Most rabbanim don't insist on this, and the sale works without any of this of the seller actually wants to sell his chometz.</p>\n\n<p>(When would he not?

Normally a person doing an obligated mitzvah gets rewarded more than a non obligated person doing it voluntarily (Kidushin 31a) </p>\n\n<p>However, there's also a rule that the more difficult and painful the mitzvah is, the more reward one gets. Additionally, the man is only able to complete the mitzvah because of her (and vice versa). So even though the woman is not commanded she should get some of her husbands reward for undertaking such pain. </p>\n\n<p>So who in the end gets more reward? (this is obviously a purely academic question. Not really any practical implications) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Technically...  one could ask from a more broader perspective then pru urevu,  for any positive Mitzvah which the man is commanded, is the woman's role in aiding the husband of a secondary nature? </p>\n\n<p>A man is commanded to procreate Mishna Yevamos 61b.<br>\nBut that does not mean a woman doesn't get equal schar</p>\n\n<p>Firstly,  a man and his wife are on the same side as Rav  Yosef  Chaim sonnenfeld said in the artscroll biography about him : In spite of my infererior merit at least my wife can bring me through her account to Olam haba. (Translation from Yiddish). The source of this seems to be the plain interpretation  of being one flesh as stated in Bereishis 2 and quoted many times in the Talmud as Ishto kegufo.  </p>\n\n<p>Secondly Our Rabbis taught in Brachos 17a:\nGreater is the assurance made by the Holy One, blessed be He, to women, than to men; for it says,(Yishaya 32,9) “Rise up, you women of leisure; listen to My voice....” How do women earn [equivalent] merit? By bringing their children to the Beit HaMidrash and to the synagogue, and by waiting for their husbands to return from the Bais hamedrash.<br>\nFrom here we see that even though women don't learn Torah they get just as much schar by making it possible for their husbands to learn, how much more so when they are going through pain to help their husbands procreate.(even though child birth pain is a punishment to Chava and future generations for eating from the fruit of knoledge (Bereishis 2) she is still helping her husband have children and should get equivalent schar). </p>\n\n<p>So yes thank your wife for her input in giving birth which by no doubt is a tremendous zechus for both of you. Even if a woman is separated from her husband she gets equivalent schar for herself.  </p>\n\n\n",

Do any commentators theorize why it switches gender?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>R. Eliyahu of Vilna (the Vilna Gaon) is quoted as having asked this question. A presentation of his approach (excerpted below) by R. Mordecai Kornfeld, can be found <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/parsha/pesach3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In fact, notes the Gaon, the night is feminine in its very essence. It is for this reason, the Gaon explains, that many positive commandments (\"Thou shalt...,\" as opposed to negative commandments -- \"Thou shalt not...\") must be performed exclusively during the daytime. (Examples of these are blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, holding the four species on Sukkot, wearing Tzitzit and Tefillin, etc.) This is in accordance with the \"feminine\" nature of the night. Just as women are exempt from fulfilling these positive commandments (see Mishnah Kiddushin, 29a), so too, the night, in its role as \"female,\" is \"exempted\" from all those Mitzvot. The exceptions to this general rule are the Mitzvot performed on the seder night: the eating of Matzah, Maror [= bitter herbs] and (in former -- and future -- times) the paschal lamb; and relating the story of the Exodus. The Torah earmarks these commandments to be performed <em>exclusively</em> at night. (It may be noted that the Mitzvot of the night of Pesach apply to women as well, even though positive commandments that are holiday-related generally do not apply to women -MK.)</p>\n  \n  <p>This, asserts the Gaon, is the deeper meaning of the Haggadah's question: Why is this night (HaLaylah) \"masculine\" (HaZeh) in its properties, being laden with positive Mitzvot, whereas all other nights are feminine in nature?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[As an aside, and as noted by Kazi bácsi in a comment to the OP, the question of the Vilna Gaon is very difficult to understand in the first place. לילה, despite its plural form of לילות, is clearly a masculine noun, and always appears in Tanakh with masculine adjectives. R. Kornfeld in the linked article presents a possible approach to understand the intent of the Vilna Gaon.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are words in Tanakh that are sometimes masculine and sometimes feminine, but לילה is not one of them.  לילה is masculine and לילות is masculine.  The form usually indicates the gender but is not definitive.  Kazi's is good advice: the adjective will indicate the noun's gender.  There is no such thing as a feminine noun that takes a masculine adjective.  With all respect to the Gaon, I don't think he was offering a grammatical explanation.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The general rule for feminine nouns ending in ה is that they have a kamatz gadol followed by a ה. Also, the stress is on the final kamatz-ה sequence (i.e. the ultimate syllable).  The stress on לילה is on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable (i.e. the first ל).  The final kamatz-ה is probably the locative ה which expresses movement towards or into (so לילה would technically be rendered as “into the night”) as a substitute for אל or ל (as Rashi notes in many places).  For example, we say ביתה, מצרימה, ירושלימה, הרה, etc.. The word for night is actually ליל (patach under 1st ל and chirik under the י).  I can’t find the nekudot on my phone so I have to spell it out.  We find the phrase ליל שימורים with ליל in construct form and thus having tseirei beneath the first ל as is the normal vowel change from absolute to construct for all nouns with dual endings. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Chametz removal and public garbage pick up\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is an area that really confuses me...</p>\n\n<p>I've heard from two rabbis that if you place your chametz in your trash can, but the trash doesn't get picked up before the deadline to own chametz on Erev Pesach, you own the chametz. Therefore, you must take your trash to a place where you know that the town will pick it up before the deadline.</p>\n\n<p>What confuses me are:</p>\n\n<p>1 - If someone nullifies the chametz and puts the can out on the street so that the can is in a public property, doesn't that action alone make the chametz public property? I say this because people walking in the street that see anything in a trash can and sometimes actually <strong>do</strong> take things out of the trash. They're not trespassing any private property.</p>\n\n<p>2 - The town garbage pick up allows the trash men to go into a person's driveway to get the trash and drag it out on the street and put it into the truck on the day that they pick up the trash. This is also not considered trespassing onto private property. It's not a question of the owner giving permission to them to do that, it's a town rule stating that the trash men are authorized to do this automatically by the fact that the owner lives in the town and pays town taxes for the trash service. Given this ruling, wouldn't someone merely nullifying the chametz and placing it in the trash can in the driveway automatically make it ownerless, even if the trash is picked up during Pesach?</p>\n\n<p>In short, with these conditions, is it really necessary for someone to seek a place that gets rid of the trash before the deadline?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Adam and Chava’s Punishment\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m sure this was asked here multiple times, but I’m having trouble finding it. Can someone please explain to me:\n1) how is Adam’s punishment of “eating bread from the sweat of your brow” a rectification of eating from the tree?\n2) how is pain in childbirth a rectification for Chava’s part in this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The punishments are definitely corrective:\nAs I see it, the biggest problem is that Adam cedes responsibility for his one mitzvah to his wife, and even denies responsibility after the fact.\nHe is given a new life which teaches him responsibility: you have to constantly be responsible to work for sustenance. If you shirk responsibility and don't work, you and your family won't eat.</p>\n<p>Chava, who was created to be an ezer kenegdo, put herself first and tried to bring Adam down with her. And she used her special influence to bring him down. So now Chava will have pain and struggles with the process of bearing and raising her family which will lead to outward-focused, sacrificial focus on them, AND the balance of power in her relationship with her husband is tweaked so she doesn't have full dangerous control over him. All her punishments are shifting her approach to the main relationships in her life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The basic answer is that once Adam got the evil inclination, he has to keep it at bay. Therefore he needs to work or else he'll try to do sins.</p>\n<p>Regarding Chava it seems from the pirkei drav eliezer ch.21 that it was a natural effect of eating from the tree. The Zohar says people gave birth differently before the eating of the tree.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Maybe say it a little differently. מדה כנגד מדה, each punishment is a consequence of the sin - not necessarily called a \"rectification\". Adam sinned against the earth that sustained him, by eating a forbidden part. The woman sinned again the man she was created to protect, by leading him into sin instead of being a wall around him against it. The Nachash (highest creature of the Earth) sinned against humanity by leading it astray instead of helping serve Hashem properly.<br />\nThus, each of them were punished by being <em>distanced</em> from their proper service. Adam was supposed to be לעבדה ולשמרה, to work the earth and take care of it; that became harder for him. Chava was supposed to help man populate his world and that became more difficult for her. The Earth was supposed to serve man, and the snake was to be the greatest servant; instead the snake was fired, completely distanced, and the earth could not serve man as well.<br />\nMaybe call it grit in the three-part machinery; everything worked same as before, but not properly.</p>\n\n\n",

I started looking into this yesterday and was a bit surprised, both that there is an answer and more so by the answer itself. I can understand if the solution might bother some people, given that the midrash connects this to none other than Yonah. Therefore, I think it's necessary to first summarize some information concerning the background of Pirkei de'Rabbi Eliezer (henceforth PRE).</p>\n<p>Like most midrashim, PRE's authorship is unknown. Unlike most midrashim, it has long been known that PRE's author based his work on a wide variety of sources, several outside of the sphere of typical, normative traditional Jewish sources. Much has been written on the topic, the following are just a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.26.3?vhe=hebrew%7CPirkei_Derabi_Eliezer&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PRE 26:3</a> states that Avraham's mother's name was Atedai, which is vastly different from what is typically considered the older tradition brought in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.91a.14?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli</a>, Amtalai bat Karnevo. Incidentally, the PRE's view was perhaps reiterated in a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133681/20472\">later commentary</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.30.6?ven=hebrew%7CPirke_DeRabbi_Eliezer,_Vocalized_Edition&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PRE 30:6</a> gives a strange account of Yishmael's adulthood. First, unlike the wives he takes in Tanach, his wives here are named Aisha and Fatima. Not only are these clearly late (i.e., post-biblical) Arabic names, but they are also names of female relatives of Muhammed known from early Islamic sources! <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aisha</a> was the third and youngest wife of Muhammed, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fatima</a> was one of his daughters. Second, this passage contains many strange details. It describes Avraham actually going to visit Yishmael, but strangely is told by Sarah to never get off of the camel. He meets Aisha the first wife and learns that she is not hospitable. So he sends a coded message to his son through her, and leaves without seeing his son.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.8.2-3?ven=hebrew%7CPirke_DeRabbi_Eliezer,_Vocalized_Edition&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PRE 8:2</a>: Chanoch (Enoch) takes part in establishing the calendar.

This is also true of PRE, which relates that after the fish showed Yonah the River of Ocean, it showed Yonah various mysteries of the sea, and eventually came to Gehinnom and Sheol.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the River of Ocean?</strong></p>\n<p>So, what exactly is this \"River of Ocean\" mentioned in the various sources?</p>\n<p>The River of Ocean, also known as the River of Oceanus or River Oceanus, is a mythological river that represents the essence of the Greek titan <a href=\"https://mysteryinhistory.com/oceanus/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oceanus</a>. In early Greco-Roman mythology it was believed that the known world was flat and surrounded by the essence of Oceanus, in the form of a circular river. Anything beyond that river may be the lands unknown. This river is mentioned, for example, in Homer's famous work, the Odyssey:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Odyssey 12.1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Now after our ship had left the stream of <strong>the river Oceanus</strong> and had come to the wave of the broad sea...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For other Classical Greco-Roman sources, see <a href=\"https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?q=river%20oceanus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theoi.com/Kosmos/Okeanos.html#:%7E:text=CLASSICAL%20LITERATURE%20QUOTES\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for example.</p>\n<p>Similar mythical beliefs of a river surrounding the world are also known from Mesopotamian cultures, such as <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1882-0714-509\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> Babylonian tablet describing a \"Bitter River\" encircling a map of the world. Some have proposed that the Greek myth was based on the Babylonian myth of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apsu</a>, but this is debatable (see <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/2351259/%CE%91%CE%A8%CE%9F%CE%A1%CE%A1%CE%9F%CE%9F%CE%A5_%CE%A9%CE%9A%CE%95%CE%91%CE%9D%CE%9F%CE%99%CE%9F_A_Babylonian_Reminiscence\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>In any case, since we know that the world isn't actually surrounded by a river (never mind that Oceanus is mythological), the river in all of these sources, including in PRE, does not exist, and the citation does not refer to a particular real-world river. It seems that the later apocryphal Jewish and, l'havdil, Christian sources reused older pagan mythologies, but reshaped them into mystical geographical locations fit for usage in descriptions of spiritual journeys. Likewise, the idea presented in PRE seems to be building upon the same older apocryphal sources that indicate that travelling to the River of Ocean with the assistance of an ethereal guide (typically angels, but in PRE's case, a God-sent large and intelligent fish) will allow select humans to cross the boundary of the legendary river and travel to gehinnom (or even Shamayim/Gan Eden in some cases, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.10.9?ven=english%7CRabbi_Mike_Feuer,_Jerusalem_Anthology&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D6%B0%D7%94%D6%B6%D7%A8%D6%B0%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%94%D7%95%D6%BC%20%D7%94%D6%B5%D7%99%D7%9B%D6%B7%D7%9C%20%D7%94%27%2C%20%D7%A9%D6%B6%D7%81%D7%A0%D6%B6%D6%BC%D7%90%D6%B1%D7%9E%D6%B7%D7%A8%20(%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94%20%D7%91%2C%20%D7%96)%3A%20%D7%B4%D7%9C%D6%B0%D7%A7%D6%B4%D7%A6%D6%B0%D7%91%D6%B5%D7%99%20%D7%94%D6%B8%D7%A8%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%99%D6%B8%D7%A8%D6%B7%D7%93%D6%B0%D7%AA%D6%B4%D6%BC%D7%99%D7%B4%2C%20%D7%9E%D6%B4%D7%9B%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%90%D7%9F%20%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%A0%D7%95%D6%BC%20%D7%9C%D6%B0%D7%9E%D6%B5%D7%93%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%A9%D6%B6%D7%81%D7%99%D6%B0%D6%BC%D7%A8%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%A9%D6%B8%D7%81%D7%9C%D6%B7%D7%99%D6%B4%D7%9D%20%D7%A2%D6%B7%D7%9C%20%D7%A9%D6%B4%D7%81%D7%91%D6%B0%D7%A2%D6%B8%D7%94%20%D7%94%D6%B8%D7%A8%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%90%20%D7%A2%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%9E%D6%B6%D7%93%D6%B6%D7%AA%2C%20%D7%94%D6%B6%D7%A8%D6%B0%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%94%D7%95%D6%BC%20%D7%90%D6%B6%D7%91%D6%B6%D7%9F%20%D7%A9%D6%B0%D7%81%D7%AA%D6%B4%D7%99%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%94%20%D7%A7%D6%B0%D7%91%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%A2%D6%B8%D7%94%20%D7%91%D6%B7%D7%AA%D6%B0%D6%BC%D7%94%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%9E%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%AA%20%D7%AA%D6%B7%D6%BC%D7%97%D6%B7%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D6%B5%D7%99%D7%9B%D6%B7%D7%9C%20%D7%94%27%20%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%91%D6%B0%D7%A0%D6%B5%D7%99%20%D7%A7%D6%B9%D7%A8%D6%B7%D7%97%20%D7%A2%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%9E%D6%B0%D7%93%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%9E%D6%B4%D7%AA%D6%B0%D7%A4%D6%B7%D6%BC%D7%9C%D6%B0%D6%BC%D7%9C%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%A2%D6%B8%D7%9C%D6%B6%D7%99%D7%94%D6%B8.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">including in PRE</a>). In Yonah's case, he was eventually brought to the foot of Hashem's Throne.</p>\n<p><strong>Why would Yonah take part in such a journey?</strong></p>\n<p>Since the Jewish and, again, l'havdil, the Christian sources describe this journey as a mystical experience, presumably the author of this midrash also had mystical reasons for choosing to imagine Yonah taking part in such a journey. Perhaps this journey is a metaphor for the change of heart <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jonah.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yonah went through</a> while sitting in the fish's stomach. This may be hinted at by the fact that when he arrives at Hashem's Hall ('היכל ה), he sees Bnei Korach praying to Hashem. P'shat Torah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.26.11?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&qh=%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%97%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a> that the sons of Korach didn't die along with their father, and later traditional Chazalic sources <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/search?q=%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%97%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%95&tab=text&tpathFilters=Talmud%7CMidrash%2FAggadah%2FMidrash%20Rabbah%2FBamidbar%20Rabbah%7CMidrash%2FAggadah%2FMidrash%20Tanchuma%7CMidrash%2FAggadah%2FMidrash%20Tanchuma%20Buber%7CMidrash%2FAggadah%2FMidrash%20Tehillim%7CTanakh%20Commentary%2FRishonim%20on%20Tanakh%2FRashi&tvar=1&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explain</a> that they had a change of heart and a special place was reserved for them in Gehinnom, where they sing praises to Hashem (evidently a callback to descendants of Korach taking part in the Mikdash's Levitical choir (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/118946/looking-for-more-details-about-the-other-authors-of-tehilim-malki-tzedek-heima/118949#118949:%7E:text=Heiman%3A,First%20Temple.\">here</a> for a summary of sources])). It's likely that other aspects of the journey were also key to leading Yonah to his change of heart, though understanding those parts requires more thought. In any case, this change of heart brought Yonah to pray to Hashem for forgiveness for running away, and so Yonah was spat out by the fish and continues on his way to Nineveh.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Much research has been written on the sources used by PRE.

Therefore, he fooled Achashveirosh into issuing a decree to destroy the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>Haman said to Achashveirosh, “im al hamelech tov yikateiv le’avdam (3:9) — “If the King agrees, letters should be sent out to make slaves (לעבדם) out of the Jewish people.” Achashveirosh consented and gave Haman authority to send the letters. However, in the letters, Haman did not write לעבדם (slavery) but \"לאבדם\" (le’abdam)“complete annihilation.”</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Esther said to Achashveirosh, “If we were being sold into slavery as you and Haman originally planned, I would reluctantly keep silent because you are the King and this is your wish, but the scoundrel tricked you and has sent letters in your name ordering the annihilation of the Jewish people.”</p>\n\n<p>When Achashveirosh heard that he had been fooled, he became furious and bellowed, “Who is this who had the audacity to do such a thing?”</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ohev_Yisrael,_Selections,_Selections.30?vhe=Ohev_Yisrael,_Zhitomir,_1863.&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אוהב ישראל</a>)</p>\n\n<p>(Taken from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2821549/jewish/Dvar-Torah-Questions-and-Answers-on-Megillat-Esther.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chabad.org)</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>My rav explained that Achashverush's question was addressing Esther's claim at the end that \"the enemy doesn't care about the king's damage\" (I think it's the previous verse.)</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Esther is hinting that the Jews pay taxes to the King and the King benefits from this.

Others say that Achashverosh had known that Haman's decree to kill the Jews had been enacted but he had not realised that this would include Esther. Therefore he wondered who else could have been responsible for such an edict (Ma'amar Mordechai). Some posit that Achashverosh surely knew what Esther was telling him; he himself had implemented the decree together with Haman. Embarrassed that his own designs were now threatening his queen, he feigned astonishment and ignorance (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26876&st=&pgnum=15&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iggeres Purim</a> - refer to the last paragraph on the page).

Esther told him that, were this the extent of the decree, she would have remained silent; such was as expected experience in exile and not familiar in our nation's history. However, Haman altered the decree, changing the word לעבד, <em>le'abeid</em>, written with the letter <em>ayin</em>, meaning to enslave them, to לאבד written with an <em>aleph</em>, which means to destroy them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Can I, for instance, empty the cupboards, clean the cupboards, clean the items I emptied out, and then put them back in?</li>\n<li>Is it fine if I put down fresh shelf paper?</li>\n<li>If not, what am I supposed to do with the displaced (but clean) items in the meantime? I have cats and they are likely to try and play with items that are just sitting out.</li>\n<li>Can I use an un-koshered dishwasher to do the washing, or do I need to do the washing all by hand?</li>\n<li>When does the 24-hour wait time begin? Once I'm done with all of it? Or do I need to remember the exact order I did things in? </li>\n<li>During the 24-hour wait period, what should I do for food? Eat out? Use disposable dishes? Can I bring food into the kitchen? </li>\n<li>Also, during the actual kashering process, where do I put all of the newly kashered dishes until the surfaces they need to sit on are also kashered? Or, should I do the surfaces first and then the items? </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I really don't want to waste my rabbi's time and want to get this right!

    "content": "# With reference to Lev 23:22, what was the equivalent act of kindness for those with no harvestable produce?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The question \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/49118/16903\">Why mention the ger in Lev 19:10, 23:22?</a>\" references Vayikra 23:22 and quotes from it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you reap the harvest of your Land, you shall not completely remove the corner of your field during your harvesting, and you shall not gather up the gleanings of your harvest. [Rather,] you shall leave these for the poor person and for the stranger</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The referenced question deals with the identity of the recipient of kindness. This question relates to how people followed this instruction if their work didn't produce something edible or harvestable.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand the passage, the intent is to extend kindness to the poor and the stranger (which I take to be migrants/sojourners, in a position somewhat similar to that of the Israelites in Egypt prior to the Exodus). From a simple reading of the passage, I infer the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the farmer (for want of a better term) deliberately avoids expending effort to achieve a 100% harvest;</li>\n<li>the farmer does not expend effort to identify or assist the gleaners (again, for want of a better term) with harvesting;</li>\n<li>the gleaners expend their own effort to gather what they need from the farmer's land after the farmer has completed the (primary) harvest.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The intention appeared to be that when one had 'increase' (profit, harvestable gain, etc), some of that increase should be shared with the poor and the stranger.</p>\n\n<p>My question is this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>for someone whose 'increase' or 'profit' wasn't harvestable (say, a craftsman, doctor or an engineer), how should they follow this law?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For simplicity, let's assume the person's role in the company is 'business owner', in a similar position as the passage's owner of the land. I wouldn't expect a carpenter, for example, to make a chair and leave it for someone to take. Would he make cash donations to the temple instead?</p>\n\n<p>On the matter of effort expended by whom, it isn't practical to talk about 'gleaning' cash. Did the temple authorities play a role in facilitating the helping of the poor and the stranger? If so, were the poor and the stranger expected to expend any effort in the process of acquiring aid (analogous to the effort required in gleaning in farms to acquire grain or fruit etc)? Perhaps taking the cash to the market to make their own purchases was the analogue. In any case, the focus of my question is the part highlighted in bold above.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My interest in this question is as someone \"interested in knowing more [about Jewish law and tradition]\" (<em>cf</em> the Mi Yodea <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/tour\">tour</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic\">FAQ</a>). Apologies in advance if the tags I chose for this question aren't the most suitable - please feel free to edit them. Thank you for reading my question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This commandment is specifically for someone who has a field, and doesn't apply to other circumstances.</p>\n<p>I will comment that it's more common than you might think - it's relevant to anyone who grows certain kinds of fruits and vegetables.  Tomatoes and similar vegetables that aren't all harvested at the same time are <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Peah.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">excluded</a>, but it applies to anyone who has a grape vine or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Peah.1.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">several other kinds of fruit trees</a> in their backyard (and I know people who had a grape vine for a while, in a not-so-warm climate, and they did get grapes from it.  They eventually took it down).  I'm pretty sure I've seen string bean plants sold at a nursery; it applies to them too.</p>\n<p>Even in cases where the commandment applies, it's not terribly useful to poor people today.  If I planted a string bean plant in my garden, I would have to leave over maybe 2-3 string beans for poor people.  They probably wouldn't even bother coming to get them, at which point I would be allowed to take them because it's not required to let them go to waste.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you're correct that the commandment is not supposed to be ignored by people who aren't in a position to follow it.  Even though someone who doesn't plant the right kinds of crops is exempt from this commandment, anyone can learn the laws and derive lessons in compassion from them.  The Sefer Hachinuch writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‏ משרשי המצוה, כי השם ברוך הוא רצה להיות עמו אשר בחר מעוטרים בכל מדה טובה ויקרה, ושיהיה להם נפש ברכה ורוח נדיבה. וכבר כתבתי כי מתוך הפעולות תתפעל הנפש ותהיה טובה ותחול ברכת השם בה. ואין ספק כי בהותיר האדם חלק אחד מפירותיו בשדהו ויפקירם שיהנו בו הצריכים, תראה בנפשו שובע רצון ורוח נכון ומבורך, וכי השם יתברך השביעו בטובו, וגם נפשו בטוב תלין.</p>\n<p>One of the roots of this commandment is that G-d wanted His nation to be crowned with every good character trait, and they should have a giving soul.  I've already written that a person's soul is influenced by doing actions and through this commandment he will become a better person [he speaks more poetically, but that's the gist].  There's no doubt that when someone leaves part of his produce in the field and leaves them so that people who need them will benefit, he will see [their?] satisfaction, and be satisfied with the good that G-d gave him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And there are many other, more general commandments that involve giving to poor people (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.15.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">example</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A non-agarian is not bound by those particular rules. But the Torah is setting up a value system that should lead you down a path of doing the right thing. Judaism thus strongly recommends (and according to some, obligates) a <em>tithing of funds</em> (\"ma'aser kesafim\") for the poor. In fact it is inspired by the agarian system to the point that one rabbi wrote (<em>Noda BiHuda</em>) that because the agarian cycle's fiscal year started on Tu BeShvat (new year for the trees; typically mid-February), one should pay their tithes to charity every year by then.</p>\n\n\n",

He even made a pact with Saul's son and presumed heir to the throne, Jonathan (id. 18:3). It was only after Saul's death in war that David was crowned by the people, first in Hebron and then in Jerusalem (see II Sam. 5), although Saul himself explicitly recognized that David would become king (I Sam. 24:21). The story of his annointment seems to simply be the account of God's pre-approval of the king the Jewish people would accept by choice years later.</p>\n\n\n",

This makes it so Lubavitch women can't use any other mikva. Is there a real difference or is it a political thing? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>It's not politics (at least not purely); it's a matter of construction. Suppose you have a big pit in the ground that collects rainwater; everyone agrees that pit is a mikvah. Fine. Today, people want a mikva with mostly clean, heated water. So they immerse in a pit of clean, heated water that is connected via a small opening to the rainwater pit. (Or usually there's an intermediate pit in between, to keep the for-dipping mikva the cleanest and warmest.) How do you connect the two pits?</p>\n\n<p><em>Chabad</em> builds <em>bor al gabei bor</em>, \"pit on top of pit.\" If you immerse in a Chabad mikvah, you'll look down at the floor and see a small hole which leads to another pit of more-rainwater (and then another one after that). Others build them <em>bor al yad bor</em>, \"pit next to pit.\" If you immerse in a non-Chabad mikvah, look along one of the side walls and you should see a hole leading to another pit.</p>\n\n<p>So there's a legitimate halachic debate on which is the better design. Obviously ask your rabbi, but non-Chabad people would have a strong halachic preference to follow a mikvah that their <em>Achronim</em> say is the right design.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gray_Matter_II%2C_Building_and_Maintaining_Mikva%27ot%2C_Part_V%3B_Five_Approaches_to_Creating_a_Mikvah?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> explains the halachic pros and cons of the Chabad mikva.</p>\n<p>Lubavitch mikva <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wCxSt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wCxSt.png\" alt=\"Lubavitch mikva\" /></a></p>\n<p>Common Mikva <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJYMJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJYMJ.png\" alt=\"Common Mikva\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

At that time we were informed that all the added spring wheat has been from stored spring wheat to make sure that the matzos remains Yoshon. However, in some cases this year some hand matzos bakeries have not been able to obtain Yoshon spring wheat for this purpose. Therefore, some hand matzos this year may be Chodosh. The Guide to Chodosh will not survey all the bakeries to ascertain which will be Yoshon and which will not. Do not contact the Guide for information about this. Instead, call the mashgiach of your specific matzo bakery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone know which brands are a concern and/or which are not?</p>\n<p>(Also, on the assumption that the concern is supposedly [also?] with shemura - does that mean there were special shemura spring wheat harvests?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I just spoke with the rav from the Kof-K who certifies the Lakewood Matzoh.

He informed me that all the matzos sold by Lakewood this year are Yoshon (including all hand made and all machine made).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Lakewood matzoh is Yoshon. This also includes their oat matzohs that may have at times been Chodosh in the past (this year the oat matzos are marked Yoshon on their website).</p>\n\n<p>I had received the same information from Rabbi Herman and so I emailed Lakewood matzoh with this question. I received a response that all of the Lakewood matzohs are Yoshon but are not marked Yoshon. You can order matzohs from Lakewood and find their contact information for any questions at <a href=\"http://lakewoodmatzoh.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://lakewoodmatzoh.com/</a> The Lakewood Shmurah Machine Made matzohs are under the Kof-K and they can be contacted as well about machine made (and perhaps hand made) - <a href=\"https://www.kof-k.org/AboutUs/ContactUs.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.kof-k.org/AboutUs/ContactUs.aspx</a></p>\n\n<p>According to the person from Lakewood matzoh, since all bakeries are Shemurah from the time of harvest, the only way the flour could be Chodosh is if the bakery didn't care about Yoshon. However, people tend to be careful about Yoshon when it involves the mitzvah of matzoh.</p>\n\n<p>Orders for Shmurah Matzoh from Lakewood Matzoh should be placed by 4 PM on March 21, '18 (eastern time).</p>\n\n<p>I would add that this does not imply that Lakewood Matzoh is the only reliably Yoshon matzoh for Pesach. There are probably a number of other choices, though I would recommend you contact other matzoh companies to determine their Yoshon status.</p>\n\n<p>Also, matzohs that come from Israel with a reliable hashgacha are most likely Yoshon even if they import flour from outside of Israel, though you should check with each hashgacha to confirm whether this is the case with them. Close to two years ago I contacted a number of hashgachas including Badatz Agudas Yisroel, Chasam Sofer, (Badatz) Eidah HaChareidis, Rav Rubin, and Shearis Yisrael (among others) and they said their products are Yoshon.</p>\n\n\n",

In the bible the term used is דברים, from דבר (Davar), loosely translated as a  \"the items that were spoken about\". In Chazal, the term used is plural of דיבר (Diber), used as a noun to mean specifically the word of God as transfered by a human prophet, as in Jeremiah 5,13:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהַנְּבִיאִים יִהְיוּ לְרוּחַ, וְהַדִּבֵּר אֵין בָּהֶם; כֹּה\n  יֵעָשֶׂה, לָהֶם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The exact reason Chazal switched the term is difficult to say, but suffice to note that their Hebrew was rather different. Already in the time of the Mishna, דבר came to it's more modern meaning, i.e. \"a thing / item\", without the context of being spoken, e.g.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עשרה דברים נבראו בערב שבת בין השמשות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This may suggest that Chazal wanted to emphasize the divine origin, moving away from a term that at their time meant \"The ten items\", moving towards something closer to the original meaning of ten divine utterances.</p>\n\n\n",

If he does marry any of them, their children likewise become\n  chalalim. Sons born do not have priestly status, and daughter may not\n  marry kohanim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>Tur, Even Haezer 8</em> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... convert or a freed slave who marries a Levite or Israelite woman or a\n  chalalah, then the child follows the status of the man – it makes no\n  difference whether the convert marries the Israelite woman or the\n  Israelite man marries the convert.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch EH 4:23 and EH 8:3 state:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גר שנשא בת ישראל, או ישראל שנשא גיורת, הולד ישראל לכל דבר ואסור בממזרת.</p>\n  \n  <p>A convert who marries a [born] Jewess or a [born] Jew who marries a\n  convert, the child is an Israelite for all matters and may not marry\n  a mamzer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mishna in Kiddushin 66b</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל מקום שיש קידושין ואין עבירה הולד הולך אחר הזכר ואיזה זו זו כהנת לויה וישראלית \n  נשאו לכהן לוי וישראל</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a principle with regard to the hala-khot of lineage: Any case where there is betrothal, i.e., where the betrothal takes effect, and the marriage involves no transgression by Torah law, the lineage of the offspring follows the male, his father. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the list of the mishna the marriage between a Levi and a convert is not written. The Gemara asks about calling this Kol Makom (This a general principle) is it really a generality (true for every case for which the rule is applied)!? and objects that there are exceptions that are (convert with mamzeret, Chalal with Israelite). The Gemara explains that some cases are skipped in the list because the list of men contains Cohen and illustrates this by the case of Chalala, not written in the Mishna despite than she can marry each of the list of men excepted the Cohen, because Cohen is written. I deduced obviously from this that as a standard case of Kiddushin without Avera, the son of a Levi with a convert is a regular Levi. This case is not written in the mishna because the list of women written there contains only women who can marry a Cohen.  </p>\n\n\n",

Since only one of the methods is correct, we are still only dipping <em>two</em> times.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, on a child's level, I would expect him to notice the dipping as with the maror, but not notice the making of the sandwich as a dipping.

The Chachamim\n  believed that the Matza and Maror should be eaten separately and\n  Hillel believed that the Matza and Maror should be eaten together. The\n  dispute hinges upon how to interpret the Pasuk (Bemidbar 9:11) that\n  states, \"With Matzot and Maror should one eat it,\" whether the word\n  \"and\" implies that the Matza and Maror must be eaten together. (We\n  have merely presented a straightforward explanation of this dispute; a\n  careful examination of Pesachim 115a, Tosafot ad. loc. s.v. Ella Amar\n  Rav Ashi, and Rambam Hilchot Chametz Umatza 8:6-8 reveals more layers\n  of interpretation, which we will not discuss in this essay.)</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rishonim dispute whether Hillel would wrap the Korban Pesach\n  together with the Matza and Maror (Rashi Pesachim 115a s.v. Shehaya\n  and Rashbam ad. loc. s.v. Korchan) or eat the Korban Pesach separate\n  from the Matza and Maror (Rambam Hilchot Chametz Umatza 8:6-7). This\n  dispute accounts for the variations in the text of Zecher Lemikdash\n  Kehillel that we recite before eating the Korech (see Baer Heitev\n  475:9 and Mishna Berurah 475:21). Some versions state, \"He would wrap\n  Matza and Maror and eat then together,\" in accordance with the\n  Rambam's view. Other versions state, \"He would wrap Pesach, Matza, and\n  Maror and eat them together\", following the view of Rashi and the\n  Rashbam.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara concludes that since the dispute between Hillel and the\n  Chachamim has not been resolved, we should accommodate both opinions.\n  Hence, we should first recite the Berachot on Matza and eat the Matza,\n  then bless on the Maror and eat it, and then eat the Matza and Maror\n  together Zecher Lemikdash Kehillel (to remember the practice in the\n  Beit Hamikdash according to Hillel). The Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim\n  475:1) codifies the Gemara's conclusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Let us ask another question to help address this one:</p>\n\n<p>The question about the dipping is asked long before the Maror and Korech are dipped. So how is a child supposed to know to ask about why we have two dippings, if thus far there has only been one?</p>\n\n<p>This question is resolved by what <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosafot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos</a> writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=114&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 114a</a>) about the removal of the table. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הביאו לפניו מצה. לפי שעקרו השלחן לפני מי שאומר הגדה ועושה הסדר קתני\n  הביאו לפניו מצה ועקירת שלחן היא כדי שישאל הבן ואביו עונה לו עדיין\n  יביאו שלחן לעשות טיבול שני והבן ישאל למה אנו מטבילין שתי פעמים ומיד\n  כשעוקרין מחזירין לפניו והמצה והמרור עליו שהרי צריך לומר בהגדה מצה זו\n  מרור זה וכדאמר לחם עוני שעונין עליו דברים הרבה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As explained by Tosafos, the table is removed from before the seder leader so that the child will ask. When the child asks about the removed table the father responds that they will bring the table back for the second dipping. This prompts the child to ask why we are dipping twice on this night. </p>\n\n<p>According to this, the child is able to ask about two dippings even before the second one occurs because his father has told him that there will be a second one. Now if the entire question is based on this piece of information that his father tells him, there would be no reason for him to ask about a third dipping because he does not know that there will be a third dipping.</p>\n\n\n",

This both justifies the dual form of the blessing-endings and explains, to our purpose, why Yisrael is mentioned in the Festival blessing at all.</p>\n<p>This section in Berachot goes on to mention the mixed blessing of \"Shabbat, Yisrael, and the seasons,\" but it's discussed in greater depth in Beitza, so let's go there. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beitzah.17a.2-3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beitza 17a</a><sup>2</sup> explains why the elements in this blessing-ending are ordered the way they are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנו רבנן יום טוב שחל להיות בשבת ... רבי אומר אף חותם בה מקדש השבת ישראל והזמנים תני תנא קמיה דרבינא מקדש ישראל והשבת והזמנים אמר ליה אטו שבת ישראל מקדשי ליה והא שבת מקדשא וקיימא אלא אימא מקדש השבת ישראל והזמנים אמר רב יוסף הלכה כרבי וכדתריץ רבינא</p>\n<p><strong>The Sages taught</strong> the following baraita: In the case of a <strong>Festival that occurs on Shabbat,</strong> ... <strong>Rabbi</strong> Yehuda HaNasi <strong>says: He even concludes</strong> this blessing with mention of both Shabbat and the Festival, saying: <strong>Who sanctifies Shabbat, the Jewish people, and the seasons.</strong> <strong>A tanna taught</strong> a baraita <strong>before Ravina</strong> with a slightly different reading: He concludes the blessing with: <strong>Who sanctifies the Jewish people, Shabbat, and the seasons.</strong> Ravina <strong>said to</strong> that tanna: <strong>Is that to say that the Jewish people sanctify Shabbat? Isn’t Shabbat already sanctified</strong> from the six days of Creation? Every seventh day is automatically Shabbat, without the need for any declaration on the part of the Jewish people. <strong>Rather</strong>, amend it and <strong>say</strong> as follows: <strong>Who sanctifies Shabbat, the Jewish people, and the seasons,</strong> as the Jewish people indeed sanctify the New Moon and the Festival days. <strong>Rav Yosef said:</strong> The <strong>halakha</strong> with regard to the conclusion of the blessing <strong>is in accordance with</strong> the opinion of <strong>Rabbi</strong> Yehuda HaNasi <strong>and as</strong> the difficulty was <strong>resolved</strong> by <strong>Ravina.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In establishing the order of the combined blessing, this passage also helps us understand why Yisrael isn't tacked on when the blessing is only about Shabbat: Unlike the Festivals, whose sanctity is dependent on Yisrael's, Shabbat's sanctity is as old as Creation and therefore independent of Yisrael.</p>\n<p>R' Hirsch adds some more conceptual meat to the bones provided in the Talmud:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All the festive seasons have had their origin in the history of Yisrael's founding, and their purpose is to help in effecting the fulfillment of the task which has been set the people of Yisrael. It is only through the existence of Yisrael, then, that these festivals came into being, and it is for the sake of Yisrael that they continue to exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to explain how the sanctity of the Festivals is dependent on the Jewish nation establishing the calendar each year by determining the start of each month and when to make leap years.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the relationship of the Sabbath with Yisrael is quite different. It is Yisrael that had its origins in the Sabbath. The institution of the Sabbath was originally intended to conserve among all of mankind the truths about God and man's relationship to Him. However, mankind had forfeited it. Hence Yisrael was chosen to reestablish this sacred institution, and to restore and spread among men the views of God and man's relationship to Him that are afforded to us by the observance of the Sabbath. Thus Yisrael actually came into being because of the Sabbath, and it is for the sake of the Sabbath that Yisrael has survived.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We thank God for sanctifying Shabbat in and of itself, back in the dawn of time, and we thank God for sanctifying Yisrael, and through Yisrael, the Festivals, whose job is to help promote Yisrael's mission.</p>\n<p>Finally, the way R' Hirsch sets up these two relationships for Yisrael as mirror images allows him to resolve a problem brought up in the next part of the passage in Berachot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מקדש השבת וישראל והזמנים חוץ מזו</p>\n<p>Levi cited an additional blessing that concludes with two themes, the blessing recited when Shabbat coincides with a Festival: <strong>Who sanctifies Shabbat, Israel, and the seasons.</strong> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi answered: <strong>Except for that one.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Yehuda HaNasi's answer sounds a bit unsatisfying, but R' Hirsch explains that blessing in light of his conceptual framework: We thank God for sanctifying Shabbat, and through Shabbat, Yisrael, whose job is to promote the lesson of Shabbat, and through Yisrael, the Festivals, whose job is to help promote Yisrael's mission.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

I always assumed the commandments given there were  for future generations (like most commentators teach). But then it says in verse 43: \"And HaShem said to Moshe and Aharon..\" followed by 47: \"all the congregation of Israel shall keep it\" and in verse 50 \"thus did all the children of Israel, as HaShem commanded Moshe and Aharon\". </p>\n\n<p>Does this mean that at that moment in Egypt other people could join?

    "content": "# What is the best translation of the word נַעַר?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So I have been studying the meaning of the Hebrew word נַעַר. I understand that it's difficult to always find exact translations of certain words in the Hebrew vocabulary, but I have found in my search that the word generally means a young adult, child, or person who can already tell the difference between good and bad - a youngster. </p>\n\n<p>In the Tanach, when the word נַעַר is used, sometimes it's (more or less) obvious what the young adult's age is. (See for instance Bereishit 21:17; we can see that Yishmael is no longer a toddler.) </p>\n\n<p>But how can I tell what age range the word נַעַר covers, when no further information is given? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p><em>Radak</em> in <em>Sefer Hashorashim</em> (<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">page 155 in this copy</a>), explains that it refers to someone who is \"young in years\", without specifying an age. However, he continues, it can also refer to an attendant (since the young generally serve the elderly), or one who is young in wisdom (i.e. foolish).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, there is no definitive age referred to by the word נער, and it largely depends on the context to define its meaning.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Notice that the word נער can refer to anyone from birth (Bereishis 8:21) to 3 (24:28ff according to Rashi) to 12 (Ibid. according to Tosfos) to 13 (25:27 according to Rashi) to 14 (18:7) to 17 (37:2) to 37 (22:12 according to Rashi) to 51 (22:5 according to Rashi) to 54 (Shemos 33:11). So claiming that a נער refers to a young child doesn’t seem accurate in the slightest. (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/90509/9682\">With all due respect to the Radak</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Notice also the first passuk quoted above - רע מנעריו, which, while loosely translated as “evil from his birth,” more literally translates to “evil from his being shaken [out of the womb].” So the word נער somehow relates to being shaken. </p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, a Rebbe of mine explains that a נער has nothing to do with age - it means an immature person, whose plan for life is a bit “shaky.”</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The word best translates to \"boy\" in the outdated sense. It can mean a young male child of various ages, a diminutive phrase for a servant (as in the now racially charged \"Come here boy\"), and also refer to a young soldier or troops (as in \"Tell the boys the war is ended\").</p>\n<p>In short, you cannot know what age is being referred to, much like the English word \"boy\" - you have to tell from the context, though the last meaning, that of a young soldier or squire is by far the most common in the Bible.</p>\n<p>A baby:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתִּפְתַּח וַתִּרְאֵהוּ אֶת הַיֶּלֶד וְהִנֵּה נַעַר בֹּכֶה וַתַּחְמֹל\nעָלָיו וַתֹּאמֶר מִיַּלְדֵי הָעִבְרִים זֶה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A small child:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתַּעֲלֵהוּ עִמָּהּ כַּאֲשֶׁר גְּמָלַתּוּ בְּפָרִים שְׁלֹשָׁה\nוְאֵיפָה אַחַת קֶמַח וְנֵבֶל יַיִן וַתְּבִאֵהוּ בֵית יְהוָה שִׁלוֹ\nוְהַנַּעַר נָעַר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A young soldier / squire:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקְרָא הַמֶּלֶךְ אֶל צִיבָא נַעַר שָׁאוּל וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו כֹּל\nאֲשֶׁר הָיָה לְשָׁאוּל וּלְכָל בֵּיתוֹ נָתַתִּי לְבֶן אֲדֹנֶיךָ</p>\n<p>וַיֹּאמֶר לְיֶתֶר בְּכוֹרוֹ קוּם הֲרֹג אוֹתָם וְלֹא שָׁלַף הַנַּעַר\nחַרְבּוֹ כִּי יָרֵא כִּי עוֹדֶנּוּ נָעַר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I would encourage you to open your mind, though, since it is pretty clear in every area of Jewish thought, including Halachick, historical, and philosophical, that egalitarianism is not a Jewish value.</p>\n\n<p>What comes to mind is that in general the Maharal parallels Man and Woman with form and material, where material is a physical reality and form is a concept that finds its expression in a material. For example, in a wooden chair wood is the material while \"chair\" is the concept expressed in the wood. While of course this just begs the question, what does this have to do with Man and Woman? </p>\n\n<p>In general it's observable that men are more interested in concepts while woman are more interested in things. (Of course neither of these are inherently good or bad, just strengths each gender possesses and can use as they wish.) That's why we find more men being musicians, mathematicians, scientists, etc, while woman gravitate more towards helping professions that emphasis personal interaction more and intellect less. Obviously there are exceptions, and there is nothing wrong with a female scientist or a male occupational therapist, just trends that reflect a deeper spiritual reality. This is also why while there is a place for women in Jewish learning, the emphasis, in concept and execution, has always been on men learning. The role of the woman is to bring these concepts down into the physical world, by building a home and nurturing an environment that engenders Jewish values.</p>\n\n<p>So to, in the quintessential relationship between man and women, that of husband and wife, the husband has more of an affinity for grasping  and articulating concepts, while the woman has more an affinity to bring this concept into reality.</p>\n\n<p>The sexual relationship between man and woman parallels these roles as well, though this forum doesn't feel as appropriate to discuss this. In terms of the actual child baring this is pretty intuitive though. The mother is the one who actually \"gives birth\" in a physical sense, while the man's contribution in more conceptual, not perceptible at the time of birth. Additionally his contribution is from outside of the body that produces the baby, while the female provides the physical framework for the baby to develop.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of our relationship with Hashem, Hashem provides the concept, the spiritual values and realities we are meant to connect to, while it is left to us to provide expressions for these ideas in this world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is a huge question, but I'll focus as you asked on Halachic implications. <em>This answer is a summary of the AriZ\"L's views</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There are <strong>three levels of closeness</strong> between that are reflected in our relations with G-d: 1.

But they still have their own personality and desires.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The wife</strong> (in AriZ\"L's tradition) completely cancels her autonomy and become one with her husband as תדא\"ר פ\"ט says: \"איזוהי אשה כשרה? כל שעושה רצון בעלה\", meaning she has no desires of her own and all her desires are to please her husband. She is driven by pure love, unlike the other two she has no fear of him, only love. This is the highest level of dedication and closeness, where all his thoughts and deeds are toward her husband.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Practically and Halachicly</strong>, </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Slaves keep the minimum and try to avoid as much burden as possible - they keep the most lenient way.

But as they are separate entities they put themselves first (like your kids - \"I'd like to help but I need to go, sorry\").</p></li>\n<li><p>Spouses have no autonomy in thought or desires or actions but to please their loved one. They constantly engage in understanding the mind of the husband (learning Torah) and keeping all the obligations to the highest bar of severity and strictness and fear only one thing - to lose their loved one's love.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>NB: an interesting observation, in our cultures a married woman takes her husband's name (Like Mr. and Mrs. Moshe Cohen), and the same happened to Yaakov when he took G-d's name and the Jewish nation is called in G-d's name.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The pasuk is not talking about us individuals but about Yerushalayim (see Rashi) which is (not a symbolic representation of a collective of individuals but rather) the home of Hashem's house.

If it is a problem, can one wear the tallit if it is already stretched out before Shabbat, and if he doesn't fold it after he is done. or would it be considered <em>muktzah</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Most questions of \"new cases\" within the laws of Shabbos, are best approached by looking at the source reason behind the prohibited melachah; and then continuing into the reasons and/or framework we know of, for any Rabbinical fence.</p>\n\n<p>Two of (of the 39) the works prohibited on Shabbos are writing, and erasing.</p>\n\n<p>In the Mishkan, writing was performed when someone made a numerical marking on each of the boards that formed the Mishkan's walls (so they could be reassembled with the same boards reconnected in the same order as before). (see Gemara Shabbos 31b with Rashi) OR writing was performed by the accountant recording written calculations in a book concerning the inventory of gold and silver etc. in the Temple treasury.(see commentary of Avnei Nezer to Shulchan Aruch O.C. 199:10) Erasing was needed when someone would have written a mistaken symbol and you needed to erase it with intent to rewrite the true value in its place.(see again Gemara Shabbos 31b with Rashi)</p>\n\n<p>Either way the work prohibited on Shabbos would be the actual creation of the letters and words; and the erasing (actual destruction) of those same letters or words.</p>\n\n<p>The OP's case is that of the embroidered words on the collar of a talis which have been fully written before Shabbos began. <strong>Folding the talis neither creates nor erases any wording. The words are still there exactly as before, just wrinkled or folded partially.</strong> Although the onlooker may now see visually a different message, or none at all etc., this does not matter. This is because the actual symbols have not been changed in any way. No writing or erasing has taken place at all!</p>\n\n<p>This can easily be seen by the fact that poskim debate the law concerning a book with \"public library\" stamped on the edge of the pages. We see that the debate (about permitting the opening and closing of this book) is only if the written words will be destroyed by actual separation or recombined by actual reassembly of the individual edges of each page. However, poskim do not debate or question if you may open a notebook or book without writing on its edge for fear that you will \"reveal\" or \"hide\" sentences or letters while flipping pages! No one has a question on this at all!</p>\n\n<p>One reason that some poskim allow opening and closing a book with stamped writing on the edges of the pages, is due to the comments of the Rema in his teshuvos (119) dealing with this case in S.A. O.C. 340. He writes that since the book is made to be used like this, so that it is constantly meant to be opened and closed, it cannot be considered writing or erasing at all. This is similar to our Halachah which permits opening and closing a door on Shabbos even though every time you open or close the door, you are in essence destroying and building a section of wall. It is permitted because the door was built for that usable function and therefore it is not the \"work\" of building or destroying. So folding a talis would certainly be considered its functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, R' Moshe Feinstien Z'tzl, allows one to take two separated, and torn halves of a written page, and match them up back together again on Shabbos. This is because the ripped print is usually recognizable and readable without putting them back together. Putting it back merely enhances the reading experience. However, he does say that if you know for certain that some letters are cut in half to a point where individual letters are not recognizable, then one should not put them back. However, one need not suspect this to be the case and may assume the split letters would be readable without checking first. (see Igros Moshe Y.D. 2:75) (also see Gemara Shabbos 104b, \"Amar R' Ami...\")</p>\n\n<p>If so, then a talis, which has no split letters (merely whole letters folded or concealed) should certainly be OK.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :-)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Even if it would be putting words together it would probably still be permitted according to many acharonim.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the similar case of a book that has words written on the sides of the pages such that by opening the book you destroy the words and by closing the book you form the words. This is debated by the acharonim. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Isserles</a> in a responsum (Shu\"t Rema # 119) permits it because a book is meant to be opened and closed and thus it does not constitute \"writing\" and \"erasing\". See the commentaries to Shulchan Aruch O.C. 340:3 for a list of who agrees and disagrees.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the tallis as well, one could argue that it is meant to be opened and closed and thus does not constitute \"writing\" and \"erasing\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Other than the potential issues with folding a Tallis outlined in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11364/can-you-fold-a-tallis-on-shabbos\">Can you fold a tallis on Shabbos?</a>, there are no issues with folding or unfolding such a Tallis.</p>\n\n\n",

Following this logic, just about all women nowadays are considered to be <em>Nashim Chashuvos</em> (consider: the requirement for leaning at the Pesach Seder applies equally to women due to this fact) and thus all women can learn/be taught Torah without any concern for violating this original law in the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>Trouble is, I have not been able to find any sources that discuss this particular idea. (I know of the commentary of the <em>Perishah</em> to the <em>Tur</em> where he picks up on the language of Rambam explaining that the prohibition applies only to \"most women\" and not women that choose to learn on their own, but that is not quite what I am referring to here.

If one or both parties had divorced in the meantime, would the repentance be any less complete?</p>\n\n<p>If <em>yichud</em> is required, would that not be a serious transgression of the following principle set forth in Avodah Zarah 17a (as well as elsewhere):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עולא כי הוה אתי מבי רב הוה מנשק להו לאחתיה אבי ידייהו ואמרי לה אבי\n  חדייהו ופליגא דידיה אדידיה דאמר עולא קריבה בעלמא אסור משום לך לך אמרין\n  נזירא סחור סחור לכרמא לא תקרב</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara relates: When Ulla would come from the study hall, he would\n  kiss his sisters on their hands.

And\n  the Gemara points out that this action of his disagrees with another\n  ruling that Ulla himself issued, as Ulla says: Mere intimacy with a\n  woman with whom one is prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse\n  is prohibited, due to the maxim: Go, go, we say to a nazirite, go\n  around, go around but do not come near to the vineyard.

If you do teshuvah in the second situation, you are not being tested as severely (or at all, as on the day of his death), but it counts as well.<br />\nThe Rambam is not giving advice here, or orders.

The reasons being either because travelling far could lead to dangerous encounters (e.g. travelling overseas in days of old), or that travelling certain distances between cities you could encounter bandits or wild animals (as the blessing itself states), etc.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nishmat.net/torah/view.asp?id=269\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> goes on to say that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We don't say the bracha in town, even though there are many car accidents also inside the city, because the blessing was established for travelers on the way, and only outside town does one fall under the category of a \"traveler\". But as soon as one is on the way, the dangers are immediate, and not a function of how much time is spent on the road. Therefore it makes sense to say the bracha immediately after leaving town, if traveling for more than 4 kilometers, even if for less than 72 minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since travelling large distances is immeasurably safer nowadays, could it be legitimate to revoke Tefillat HaDerech altogether? Change the nusach? Or only said under very specific conditions?</p>\n\n<p>As an aside: It is good to pray and acknowledge Hashem's help in any situation we encounter and there could be grounds for saying the blessing in any case, even though we are not obligated. However, we don't make a yehi ratzon for all things that are potentially dangerous (eating, walking down the street, swimming, bunjee jumping), but the 'traveler of the past' was given the status of 'in danger', such that a special blessing was instituted. It seems like the metziut has changed considerably.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Seemingly because of a concern like yours, there are some poskim that say that you should only say the tefila in a case where you are nervous to travel.</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Tefillat_HaDerech\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to some poskim, one should recite Tefillat HaDerech only if\none is nervous about the trip.</p>\n<p>[ R' Joseph B.

The Alter Rebbe then said that that's incorrect, because a cow exists, and wings exist, he's just putting two things that already exist together, but it's impossible to actually think of / know about anything that doesn't exist, so the Alter Rebbe concluded that since we know about G-d, he must exist, because we know about him, and it's impossible to know about something that doesn't exist!</p>\n\n<p>When I first heard this it sounded pretty good, but then I thought: why can't you just respond that he know of human creators of art (for example) and the \"know\" about G-d is just to consider everything as like a big art piece, and then to imagine some bigger creator, so it would just be like imagining something that does already exist, a human creator, and putting it in another perspective. </p>\n\n<p>So I'm not trying to challenge the existence of G-d, chas v'shalom, nor am I challenging the wisdom of the Alter Rebbe, but I was trying to understand this particular proof from the Alter Rebbe (and the Rabbi I heard it from said it was found later in the Rishonim). So if anyone either #a can explain why it can't be refuted from the above or #b just find the source of this story somewhere ('cause it might clarify things to see it inside), then that would be the #1 answer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> \njust to clarify, the context in which this story was said was to explain the following: There's some parts of G-d we can actually know about, like how He creates the world(s) etc., like it's actually possible to know about / imagine the energy that gives life to every being, that's something we can comprehend, know about, imagine, etc. so relative to that level of G-d, it's considered an \"existence\", hence the Alter Rebbe's proof that G-d \"exists\", since it's referring to that aspect of G-d, which another aspect of G-d (which isn't at all related to the Alter Rebbe's proof) is that aspect of G-d that's totally removed from the world(s), it doesn't create them at all, it has nothing to do with actively giving life to the world, and regarding <em>that</em> level of G-d, it's actually <em>not</em> at the level of \"existence\", because we can't know about it, and (the Rabbi I heard the speech from goes on to say) these two levels correspond to \"Memale\" and \"Sovev\" as discussed in Kabbalah etc. </p>\n\n<p>but anyway, the Alter Rebbe was just trying to answer the question of a Russian \"How do we know there's a G-d at all!\" and to that question the Alter Rebbe just gave the proof simply about since we know about it, it must exist (and he was only / simply referring to the first level \"Memale\", since he didn't want to get into deep Kabbalah with this Russian, just to simply explain that there <strong>is</strong> a G-d at all).</p>\n\n<p>My question was only just why can't you say, according to this simple answer, that by \"knowing about Him\" the person is just putting other things that exist together to form a \"Super Creator\".</p>\n\n<p>As I was just writing this, I realized I actually answered my own question that the proof G-d exists is because we know about the G-dly energy behind the worlds, as said above ,or even if someone hasn't reached that stage, he at least knows about the basic energy that gives life to everything, it's simple that everything (or at <strong>least</strong>) somethings have energy at least giving them life, and because we know about that, that's proof that it exists. So basically, I (with Double AA's help) actually answered my own question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Ok I realized the answer to the question, after Double AA helped me by asking \"What <em>do</em> we know about G-d?\", 'cause that is actually the answer. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, this story was told by the Rabbi in context of explaining that there are some parts of G-d that we can know about, like how He gives life to every living being, and (this one takes a little deeper meditation to realize, but still possible to realize that) He creates everything from something to nothing etc.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, this level of G-d that we can know (says the same Rabbi I heard this whole thing from) is on the level of \"existence\", it <em>exists</em> in at least somewhat tangible terms, and only something that exists we can know about, and only something that we know about exists (as mentioned in the actually story), but there's another aspect of G-d that we <em>don't</em> know about, and that's the part of Him which is removed / separate so to speak from the world(s), that level of Him doesn't actively create the worlds, it's a thing for itself, and regarding that level, we <em>don't</em> know about it, as Double AA said, but the Alter Rebbe's entire proof was just regarding the aspect of G-d that we do know about , namely, the aspect of Him which creates the worlds, since the Alter Rebbe wasn't trying to get into any deep Kabbalah with the Russian, he was just trying to explain simple how we know there is some kind of a \"G-d\".</p>\n\n<p>So it turns out that Alter Rebbe's proof is only for the part of G-d that we can know about, and the proof is (I guess, someone correct me if they think differently) that since everyone knows about the G-dly life force that's within everything (or at least the concept of life force just for basic, living creatures, since it's obvious that at least <em>some</em> things have life force), so then it must exist, since we know about it, because it's so obvious (I think I'm getting this right, someone let me know if there's any kind of flaw in this understanding of it)</p>\n\n\n",

Word is not found in Tanach, apparently. How is it distinguished from other triliteral roots meaning village כפיר, lion, expiation כפר and cover כפרת?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Edits in <em>italics</em>:</p>\n\n<p><em>Balashon blog discusses it at length <a href=\"http://www.balashon.com/2006/09/kapara.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, and provides many sources, as well as a look at one example of it by various Rishonim.  I have added some content from there during this edit.</em></p>\n\n<p>K-P-R is used throughout the Bible to mean wiped away or covered up, which are similar to what a denial does; it wipes away or covers up a fact.  This would be how the word to deny comes from that word (<em>see below for more details</em>), and would also be the connection to the word Kapores, and most uses of K-P-R in the bible.</p>\n\n<p>This is noted by Radak in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43656&st=&pgnum=172\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Hashorashim Erech K-P-R</a>, that K-P-R means covering/removing/annulling, and he suggests that forgiveness comes from this word, becomes it is \"removal of sins\".  </p>\n\n<p>In terms of the other words you mentioned <em>(as well as the various ones listed in the Balashon post)</em>, Radak there notes that they are unconnected to the other K-P-R (and in fact, there are more words that are unconnected, such as Kefor).  He (Radak) doesn't give a reason why, <em>however, Rabbi Menachem Leibtag goes through a number of them <a href=\"http://mail.tanach.org/special/kippur.txt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (he understands K-P-R to be protection; Kefor protects the ground, Kofer is protection money, etc.), and the Balashon post quotes a few other sources to explain some of the others that Leibtag does not address.</em></p>\n\n<p>Ibn Janach (in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36864&st=&pgnum=269\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his Sefer Hashorashim here</a>) connects some of the other K-P-R roots (such as village) with those roots in other languages, such as Arabic, and I'm sure some modern scholars have done more work on this.  See the Balashon post for discussions of Akkadian and Arabic.</p>\n\n<p>Jastrow (as you noted above in the comments) seems to understand this as the Aramaic word, and quotes a couple of Targumin as sources.  Just as a correction, it is not פנו אלי עורף that is translated as Kefirah, but rather the Targum simply fills in the narrative of ובעת רעתם later in that verse.  <em>Apparently he understand this as \"wiping out the truth\".</em></p>\n\n<p>Edit 2: Y Zibenberger (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37062&st=&pgnum=116\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) suggests that it comes from an Arabic word, and notes a much better proof from Targum Yonasan than Jastrow has, as in <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Mishlei/30.9#e0n7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishlei 30:9</a>, T\"Y translates וכחשתי, which means to deny, as ואכפר. </p>\n\n<p>Y. Matmon Cohen (<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/24394513\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) suggests that the Hebrew word K-P-R to mean 'denial' came about after the Babylonian exile.  He lists a number of Talmudic sources where K-P-R is used in that fashion, but obviously no biblical sources.</p>\n\n<p><em>Balashon quotes another site that I cannot access as explaining:</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>[in] discussing the cognate Arabic term kuffir, suggests \"to cover or to conceal\" the truth.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would add that it could be argued that verses such as <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Yeshayahu/28.18#e0n7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yeshaya 28:18</a> could be interpreted in a very similar fashion, and that they are obviously some sort of link between the old and newer translations.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>When exactly people used the word \"Kefirah\" without anything following it to be a Kefirah of Hashem is an interesting question, and I don't have an exact answer, as it is kind of contextual.  Even early sources that use this term to refer to denial, such as <a href=\"https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?728\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnas Rabbi Eliezer</a> (supposedly of Tannaic origin), still write terms such as כפירה בהקב\"ה, so that it is clear what is being denied.  However, it seems to have been popular from the middle of the period of Rishonim (13th century), at least in some places; for example, a search for the term \"כפירה ומינות\" comes up with results from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ibn_Aderet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashba</a> (Shu\"t 1:418), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Ephraim_Luntschitz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Keli Yakar</a> (various sources), and many later sources.  Additionally, this term is used by itself in the works of Abarbanel a number of times to mean heresy. </p>\n\n<p>However, in many cases, even nowadays, the \"Kefirah\" will have some description added (such as \"He's a Kofer Baikar\", or \"that is Kefirah in Chazal!\").  </p>\n\n\n",

Those words in italics are my clarifications.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The mitzvah which is after this is to tell about the praises (<em>meaning\n  improvements or benefits</em>) of the Egyptian exodus (<em>meaning departing\n  from finite, limited conditions</em>). That it is a constant obligation on\n  a Jew to recount these praises.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, do we (<em>meaning Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and those who follow his\n  teachings</em>) establish.</p>\n  \n  <p>Every Jew who recounts about the Egyptian exodus and rejoices in this\n  recounting with <em>outward joy</em> (simcha), in the future will rejoice\n  with the Shechinah (<em>meaning the revelation of G-d's presence within\n  the creation</em>) in the world to come.</p>\n  \n  <p>That this is joy from every perspective. It is the Jew rejoicing in\n  his Master and the Holy One, blessed be He rejoicing in this story.</p>\n  \n  <p>In this moment, the Holy One, blessed be He gathers together the\n  entire Heavenly household (<em>including the servants of the Heavenly\n  household meaning all angelic forces</em>) and says to them, \"Come and\n  listen to this story of My praise which my child recounts and how they\n  rejoice about My redemption.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Then, they all come and join together with Israel and listen to the\n  story of praise.

And they acknowledge to Him about the Holy\n  Nation that is His in the land, who rejoice about the benefit of their\n  Master's redemption.</p>\n  \n  <p>Then, power and the overcoming of opposition is increased for Him\n  above. And Israel, through this story, give power to their Master.\n  Like with a king whose power and strength is increased at the time\n  that they (<em>his subjects</em>) rejoice about his strength and acknowledge\n  him.</p>\n  \n  <p>And all of them (<em>the Heavenly household</em>) are moved because of Him and\n  His glory (<em>gravity</em>) is increased by all of them.</p>\n  \n  <p>On account of this, is it necessary to rejoice and recount this story.\n  Like it is said in similar matters, a Jew is always obligated to\n  recount before the Holy One, blessed be He and to publicize a miracle\n  which He has done for them from among all the miracles which He has\n  performed.</p>\n  \n  <p>And don't be surprised that this is an obligation and say, \"Doesn't\n  the Holy One, blessed be He know everything?! Everything that is, will\n  be, and was?! What is this publicizing to Him and why is it done? He\n  knows!\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Rather, it is certain that it is necessary for the Jew to publicize a\n  miracle and to recount before Him everything that He did. (<em>Meaning\n  that on account of Him, everything was done. It is not random.</em>)</p>\n  \n  <p>And thus, these words ascend and the entire Heavenly household gather\n  and are warmed (<em>influenced and moved</em>) by them and all of them\n  acknowledge the Holy One, blessed be He. And the honor (<em>which has a\n  connotation of gravity</em>) of G-d increases over all of them, above and\n  below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The emphasis here is that Israel, through fulfilling this mitzvah which relates to them personally and individually, cause the Heavenly household to perform the same thing in regard to everything (all the miracles and all the gevurot that G-d does everywhere).</p>\n\n<p>Israel is the catalyst which changes the creation from a place where G-d's presence is hidden and concealed (a universe which appears to be populated with individuals and separate states of being) to a place where G-d's presence is revealed (where G-d is one).</p>\n\n<p>It shouldn't be lost on the reader that much of the language used in this Zohar is describing how this ultimate revelation of G-d's oneness in the universe (Shechinah) relates to increasing gravity (<em>Yikar, G-d's honor which also can mean heaviness.</em>) Taken in a modern sense, this infinite increase in gravity (which is going out from the boundaries of this universe, Yetziat Mitzrayim) would result in a manifestation of the singularity, where everything is, quite literally, one.</p>\n\n\n",

Their argument is that even according to the opinion which maintains mitzvos do not need kavanah, mis'asek or one who lacks all kavanah is not yotzei. See R. Hutner's Pachad Yitzchak on Pesach, pp. 53-54, as well as R.

David Bleich, based on the Ramban's introduction to his commentary on Iyov, makes a slightly different argument: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Commandments, regardless of their intrinsic rationality, are binding and significant in the theological sense only because they constitute the fulfillment of a divine command. Thus, not only the existence of God but also the authenticity of revelation as a historical event and the divinity of the entire corpus of Torah are inherent even in those moments of Judaism which concern themselves with action and conduct rather than belief.\" - R. J.D. Bleich, With Perfect Faith, p. 3</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Netziv, in Haamek Davar Bamidbar 15:39, also states that one who performs mitzvot without belief has not fulfilled the mitzvah: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא תתורו אחרי לבבכם - לימדנו בזה מעשה המצוות, <strong>שלא נחשבו למצוה אלא\n  אם עושה ומאמין עכ\"פ שהוא מצווה ועושה, לאפוקי אם לבבו פונה אחרי מינות\n  שאינו מאמין במצוה כלל, אין בעשייתו נחשב למעשה</strong>, וזהו \"אחרי לבבכם\",\n  ופירשו בגמרא ברכות (יב,ב) \"זו מינות\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A society that follows and adheres to kosher diets essentially builds their life around it and I think that sparked a lot more than just pleasing God; of course pleasing God comes with its own blessings and merits which the Jewish people have benefited from.\nSo it would still be unkosher because the animal as a whole is kosher not a particular part.

Similarly if one made a Daysa with wheat flour or grain, Chimutz would occur in minutes, as one is heating it up. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is an obvious one. <strong>If no yeast is added to the dough it will be well over 24/48 hours before there can be any signs of rising</strong>. This is to allow the tiny amount of natural yeast in the flour/air to build up to a level high enough to trigger the fermentation of the dough. It is only when the starch breaks down into CO2 & alcohol that the rising can begin. It would seem that scientifically nothing significant at all is happening before many hours pass.<br>\nThe question would, therefore, be - <strong>what actually is happening after 18 mins</strong>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One could, perhaps, try and say that this would be another example of Chazal describing something that we do not observe scientifically today. I believe that this would be false as the kneading, fermenting, and baking processes were extremely common and found in every household. They for sure would have been aware of this problem (of nothing happening after 18 mins). Additionally there are Mishnayos that state clearly that without a certain amount of yeast no discernible fermentation takes place (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Orlah.2.8?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orlah 2:8-11</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Temurah.1.4?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Temurah 1:4</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are Chazal, perhaps, referring to some metaphysical changes? Would this be what the Torah is concerned about?<br>\nWould be interested to hear any theories/opinions about this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The 18-minute rule is one of a few heuristics offered by the Talmud for determining whether a dough has become <em>chametz</em>. These are summarized by the Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/937304/jewish/Chametz-UMatzah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hilchot Chametz Umatza</em> 5</a>:13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל זמן שאדם עוסק בבצק אפילו כל היום כולו אינו בא לידי חמוץ. ואם הגביה ידו והניחו ושהה הבצק עד שהגיע להשמיע הקול בזמן שאדם מכה בידו עליו כבר החמיץ וישרף מיד. ואם אין קולו נשמע אם שהה כדי שיהלך אדם מיל כבר החמיץ וישרף מיד. וכן אם הכסיפו פניו כאדם שעמדו שערותיו הרי זה אסור לאוכלו ואין חייבין עליו כרת:‏</p>\n<p>As long as a person is busy with the dough, even for the entire day, it will not become chametz. If he lifts up his hand and allows the dough to rest so that [it rises to the extent that] a noise will resound when a person claps it with his hand, it has already become chametz and must be burned immediately. If a noise does not resound and the dough has lain at rest for the time it takes a man to walk a mil, it has become chametz and must be burned immediately.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if its surface has become wrinkled [to the extent that it resembles] a person whose hair stands [on end in fright] - behold, it is forbidden to eat from it, but one is not liable for כרת [for eating it].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The primary heuristics are physical observations: hearing a noise when the dough is clasped or seeing a change in the dough's surface. Secondarily, there is a time heuristic, which comes from the Mishna and Gemara on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.46a.7-8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 46a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מתני׳</strong> בצק החרש אם יש כיוצא בו שהחמיץ הרי זה אסור:‏<br />\n<strong>גמ׳</strong> אם אין שם כיוצא בו מהו אמר רבי אבהו אמר רבי שמעון בן לקיש כדי שילך אדם ממגדל נוניא לטבריא מיל</p>\n<p><strong>Mishna:</strong> Deaf dough, if there is dough similar to it which became leavened, is prohibited.<br />\n<strong>Gemara:</strong> If there is no dough similar to it, what is the halakha? Rabbi Abbahu said that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:  the time it takes a person to walk the distance from Migdal Nunaya to Tiberias, which is a mil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the definition of the 18-minute limit is something like \"the shortest duration in which anyone, to the Sages' knowledge, had ever observed dough to take from being left alone until it was showing the first signs of leaven.\" To make sure that we're not accidentally consuming any leaven at all on Passover, we don't use dough that sat for this duration, even if we don't observe signs of leavening directly.</p>\n<p>Now, note the context in which the Rambam lists these heuristics. He's talking about (and interpreting the Talmud to be talking about) fully-formed dough that's been mixed and worked for an arbitrary amount of time, then left alone. Given these conditions, the dough could have had ample time and exposure to allow airborne yeast to enter and get incorporated. What it hasn't had the opportunity to do, thanks to being worked the whole time, is build up any appreciable amount of internal gas, which would cause rising, hollow sounds, and surface changes.</p>\n<p>It seems, therefore, that the change that makes the dough forbidden is specifically the buildup of gas, not the incorporation of yeast or any chemical change. The 18 minutes is the minimum time it could take for gas to build up, and the minimum would naturally be when a dough has already incorporated a healthy dose of environmental yeast.</p>\n<p>That explains the physical origins of the 18-minute limit, consistent with the process you describe of first airborne yeast being incorporated, then rising happening.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The question remains: if this limit is intended to apply only to dough that's already mixed and left alone, why do we apply it to the time from flour first meeting water until the matza is fully baked, having been worked continuously the whole time before it gets into the oven? I dealt with that question previously <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/69943/2\">here</a>. The bottom line<sup>1</sup> is that latter-day <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/581/mi-yodeya-glossary/1428#1428\"><em>posekim</em></a>, taking minority opinions among the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/581/mi-yodeya-glossary/3718#3718\"><em>rishonim</em></a> into account, rule that we should be extra-strict with respect to Passover by applying the 18-minute limit to the entire time of preparing the dough, even if it's not left alone. I couldn't find any source for the common practice of including the baking time into this limit as well, but it's not difficult to imagine that this is the result of yet another layer of using the very strictest possible interpretation of a rule.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

He even goes so far as to suggest the author was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_(high_priest)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the high priest Jason</a>, although you will have to read his <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1507968\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">whole paper</a> to see his logic.</p>\n\n<p>As wikipedia says, it didn't enter the haggadah until much later.

    "title": "Source for Hiding or Locking Away All Non Passover Vessels",
    "content": "# Source for Hiding or Locking Away All Non Passover Vessels\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Bit of a debate with someone. I never saw my Sephardic family make a special room to lock away <strong>all</strong> chameitz dishes. Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 451:1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ceramic dishes that have been used for hametz the whole year, even if they were used for oats or other grains, should be wiped well such that there is no noticeable hametz left, and then it is permitted to keep them until after Passover and use them either for what they were used for before Passover or something different. They should be hidden on Passover in a hidden place where one does not normally go, lest one come to use them on Passover. It is good to close them in a room and to hide the key. But refiring it in fire does not work for any ceramic item that was used for hot things, even if it was not used on the fire and boiling liquid was just poured into it. Rem\"a: There are those who forbid even for the second container (the Magid chapter 5). Even if they are filled with coals, we are concerned that he will be worried that the containers will crack (meaning that they will break) and will not do a complete refiring. However, if he returns them to the furnace where they make new ceramic items, it is permitted. Because they are sent into a big fire like this, clearly he will not be concerned that they will break. But this is not true of our ovens. Rem\"a: For every object that needs to be made white-hot or scalding, it is forbidden to use it even for cold things without kashering it (Mordechai at the beginning of Chapter Kol Shaah). See in Yoreh Deah Chapter 421.</p>\n  \n  <p>קדרות של חרס שנשתמש בהם חמץ כל השנה, אפלו אותם שעושים בהם דיסא ומיני\n  קמחים, משפשפן היטב בענין שלא יהא חמץ נכר בהם, ומתר להשהותן לאחר הפסח\n  להשתמש בהם בין במינו בין שלא במינו. ומצניען בפסח במקום צנוע שאינו רגיל\n  לילך שם, כדי שלא יבא להשתמש בהם בפסח, וטוב לסגרם בחדר ולהצניע המפתח.\n  אבל הסק שיסיקם באש, אינו מועיל להם ולא לשום כלי חרס שנשתמש בהם חמין\n  אפלו שלא על ידי האור אלא שערה לתוכה רותחין. הגה: ויש אוסרים אפלו בכלי\n  שני (המגיד פרק ה'). ואפלו אם ימלאום גחלים, דחישינן דלמא חייס עליהו שמא\n  פקעי (פרוש, שמא יתבקעו) ולא עביד להו הסקה מעליא. ומיהו אם החזירן לכבשן\n  שמצרפין בו כלי חרס חדשים, מתר, ודיכון שמכניסן להסק גדול כזה ודאי לא\n  חייס עליהו דלמא פקעי, אבל לתנורים שלנו לא. הגה: כל כלי הצריך לבון או\n  הגעלה, אסור להשתמש בו אפלו צונן בלא הכשר (מרדכי ריש פרק כל שעה). ועין\n  ביורה דעה סימן קכ\"א</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To me the halakha seems clear that we are only talking about unglazed ceramic dishes because they are too risky. Also, the phrasing of \"they should be\" seems less like a halakhic statement, rather a suggestion. Is there some other source I'm not aware of? Do other Sepharadi posekim weigh in on this?</p>\n\n<p>Update: I am noticing a discrepency. The S\"A seems to posit putting away any ceramic dishes, whether they were for cold or hot hameitz, which goes against the Rambam.</p>\n\n<p>Chameitz UMatzah 5:21</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All earthenware vessels that were used for chametz while cold may be\n  used for matzah while cold, except for the utensils in which yeast and\n  charoset were placed, for their leavening effect is powerful.\n  Similarly, a kneading trough in which chametz is kneaded and left to\n  become leavened is considered as a place where yeast is soaked, and we\n  do not use it on Pesach.</p>\n  \n  <p>כל כלי חרס שנשתמש בהן חמץ בצונן מותר להשתמש בהן מצה בצונן. חוץ מכלי\n  שמניחין בו את השאור וכלי שמניחין בו חרוסת מפני שחימוצו קשה. וכן עריבות\n  שלשין בהן החמץ ומניחין אותו שם עד שיחמיץ הרי הן כבית שאור ואין משתמשין\n  בהן בפסח:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam only seems to be concerned about ceramic vessels in which you will cook or eat hot items on, so this means that all your \"chameitz\" cups, cheese plates, or things that don't reach hot enough temperatures do not need to be stored.</p>\n\n<p>Chameitz UMatzah 5:25</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All earthenware utensils that were used for chametz in hot water,\n  whether as a כלי ראשון - for example, pots - or as a</p>\n  \n  <p>כלי שני - for example, bowls - whether they were glazed and coated\n  with lead so that they became like glass, or they were of simple\n  earthenware: we do not use them for matzah. Rather, we put them aside\n  until after Pesach, and then we may cook with them.</p>\n  \n  <p>כל כלי חרש שנשתמש בהן חמץ בחמין בין כלי ראשון כגון קדרות. בין כלי שני\n  כגון קערות. בין שהיו משוחין ושועין באבר שעושין אותן כעין זכוכית. בין\n  שהיו חרס כמה שהן. אין משתמשין בהן במצה אלא מניחן לאחר הפסח ומבשל בהן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To me the halakha seems clear that we are only talking about unglazed ceramic dishes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, but such dishes can't be made kosher for Passover so were put aside. No one in those days put aside a metal spoon: they made it kosher for Passover.

If your $10,000 heat pump is broken in deep-freeze weather and $200 can fix it, you don't have to give the repairman more than the $200 he asks.  So in our case, you don't have to offer the widow more than $100.  You could give her thousands and even marry her if you wish, but you don't have to.

Not sure, but probably yes.  Are you also obligated to disclose that you have a match in the back?  Most probably not.  What if she is smart and asks \"How much is it worth TO YOU?\", what should you say?  If you lie, is that putting a stumbling block before the blind, which is forbidden by Torah [Leviticus 19:14]?

The penalty for killing a Gentile is \"death by the hands of heaven\". The Ra'avan in his commentary to Bava Kamma 74d also explains that \"Thou shalt not murder\" in the Ten Commandments applies to any person, including gentiles. (as well as not to steal or commit adultery)</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 5:7 brings the Gemara's ruling (Pesachim 25b etc.) as Law and explains in a case where someone threatens Reuven and says kill Shimon or I will kill you!; a person must rather be killed than to murder someone else. The reason is \"who says your blood is redder?\" or why should one life be chosen over the other?</p>\n\n<p>The Kessef Mishnah explains that even in a case where you could actually prove that someone's blood is in fact redder than the other person's, (the other fellow's life is more important) we still do not commit murder to save ourselves. The Jewish people have a tradition that we do not do so under any and all circumstances. The logical reason given by the Gemara, usually applies. But, even if it doesn't,the Law remains the same.</p>\n\n<p>Now the Rambam, and Rashi, seem to frame the case by example, regarding two Jews. However, if we go with the Kessef Mishnah's tradition, then Rambam and Rashi are simply stating the case to match the Gemara's logic (weighing two potentially equal lives on a scale). However, the Kessef Mishnah's tradition teaches that the logic need not apply. As long as its a question of murdering someone to save oneself, we forbid it. So why would we weigh the difference in who to save based on Jew or Gentile (even if one has more commandments than the other etc.)? Besides, what would be the point of killing someone else to save your life, when the penalty is death? You didn't save your own life at all if it is condemned to be punished by death?!</p>\n\n<p>Finally, IMHO, the greatest Kiddush Hashem is for a person to withstand any urge (even self preservation) and show the world that a Jew, Hashem's representative, would never commit murder! This sacrifice is the better path because we must make sure human life is precious in the eyes of the world.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps, :-)</p>\n\n\n",

Here is the <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/rambam/hakdamat-2.htm#5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew version</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>There he explains at length that the ultimate spiritual state is to do what is right for its own sake--to be intrinsically motivated.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, even achieving this ultimate spiritual level should not be one's motive, but merely to do what is right at whatever level one is holding.</p>\n\n<p>It is a subtle point, but a careful study of Rambam there will make this clear. (Rambam himself warns there that not all people will understand his point, so it certainly is not simple.) Here are two quotes, but it is a long discussion that really requires reading the entire section.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One ought not to busy oneself with God’s Torah in order to earn one’s\n  living by it; nor should the end of studying wisdom be anything but\n  knowing it. The truth has no other purpose than knowing that it is\n  truth. Since the Torah is truth, the purpose of knowing it is to do\n  it. A good man must not wonder, “If I perform these commandments,\n  which are virtues, and if I refrain from these transgressions, which\n  are vices which God commanded us not to do, what will I get out of\n  it?” This is precisely what the child does when he asks, “If I read,\n  what will you give me?” The child is answered in some such way\n  because, when we know his limited understanding and his desire for\n  something other than a real goal, we answer him on the level of his\n  folly, as it is said in Proverbs 26:5: “Answer the fool according to\n  his folly.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The world to come is the ultimate end toward which all our effort\n  ought to be devoted. </p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, the sage who firmly grasped the\n  knowledge of the truth and who envisioned the final end, forsaking\n  everything else, taught: “All Jews have a share in the world to come”\n  (Sanhedrin 10:1).  </p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, even though this is the end we seek,\n  he who wishes to serve God out of love should not serve Him to attain\n  the world to come. He should rather believe that wisdom exists, that\n  this wisdom is the Torah; that the Torah was given the prophets by God\n  the Creator; that in the Torah He taught us virtues which are the\n  commandments and vices that are sins. In so doing, he will perfect the\n  specifically human which resides in him and will be genuinely\n  different from the animals. When one becomes fully human, he acquires\n  the nature of the perfect human being; there is no external power to\n  deny his soul eternal life. His soul thus attains the eternal life it\n  has come to know which is the world to come, as we have explained.\n  This is the meaning of the verse: “Be not as the horse or as the mule,\n  which have no understanding; whose mouth must be held in with bit and\n  bridle” (Ps. 32:9). Restraints which prevent animals from acting in\n  accordance with their nature are external ones, like the bit and the\n  bridle. With man, the influences which restrain him are his control of\n  self. When a man achieves human perfection it restrains him from doing\n  those things which are called vices and which withhold perfection from\n  him; it urges and impels him toward those things which are called\n  virtues and which bring him to full perfection. This is what all the\n  teaching of the sages have made clears to me about this most important\n  matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>R. Yosef Cohen writes (Sefer Hateshuva 8:3 & 9:2) that when Rambam writes that they desired olam haba, it was not for the personal benefit of olam haba but for the sake of attaining the shleimus of knowing God.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כוונת הרמב\"ם כאן ליישב שלא תהא סתירה הא שהתאוו כל הנביאים לחיי העוה\"ב\n  להא דאיתא בספרי והובא ברמב\"ם פ\"י ה\"ד שלא יאמר אדם הריני לומד תורה\n  בשביל שאקבל שכר לעוה\"ב לזה כתב הרמב\"ם שהנביאים לא התאוו לעוה\"ב משום\n  הגמול והשכר על מעשיו להנאת עצמו אלא להגיע לתכלית שבעוה\"ב שהוא השלמות\n  לדעת ולהשיג מאמיתת הקב\"ה כלשון הרמב\"ם בה\"ב ומה זה שאמרו ונהנין מזיו\n  השכינה שיודעים ומשיגים מאמתת הקב\"ה וזה תכלית הבריאה וכלשון המסילת\n  ישרים בתחילת ספרו שהאדם לא נברא אלא להתענג על ד' וליהנות מזיו שכינתו\n  וכו' ויעוין להלן ציון 43 שכ\"ז מבואר בדברי הרמב\"ם בפיה\"מ פ' חלק שהובא\n  להלן ויעוין בבארי בשדה ציון 28 וציון 32 ובה\"ד ציון 96</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, I don't really see how this is indicated in Rambam's words here.</p>\n\n\n",

The baraita asks: But according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, how do I uphold the verse: “And there went up a mist from the earth”? Rabbi Yehoshua could answer that this verse teaches that the clouds grow stronger, and rise to the firmament, and open their mouths like a leather bottle, and receive the rain waters from above, as it is stated: “For He draws away the drops of water, which distill rain from His vapor” (Job 36:27).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The law against adultery is no longer enforced (they will laugh at you if you try to file a case). The courts <em>do</em> take action against murderers and thieves, though there are probably minor differences in how edge cases are handled versus how <em>halacha</em> says they <em>should be</em>.

That in addition to their status as individuals, they have another state of being where the collective of individuals is a distinct, unified, single entity.</p>\n\n<p>This is expressed through the posuk from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.7.23?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2 Shmuel 7:23</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וּמִ֤י כְעַמְּךָ֙ כְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל גּ֥וֹי אֶחָ֖ד בָּאָ֑רֶץ</strong> אֲשֶׁ֣ר הָלְכֽוּ־אֱ֠לֹהִים לִפְדּֽוֹת־ל֨וֹ לְעָ֜ם וְלָשׂ֧וּם ל֣וֹ שֵׁ֗ם וְלַעֲשׂ֨וֹת לָכֶ֜ם הַגְּדוּלָּ֤ה וְנֹֽרָאוֹת֙ לְאַרְצֶ֔ךָ מִפְּנֵ֣י עַמְּךָ֗ אֲשֶׁ֨ר פָּדִ֤יתָ לְּךָ֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם גּוֹיִ֖ם וֵאלֹהָֽיו׃</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>And who is like Your people Israel, a unique nation on earth</strong>, whom God went and redeemed as His people, winning renown for Himself and doing great and marvelous deeds for them [and] for Your land—[driving out] nations and their gods before Your people, whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this same idea is also explained in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.6a.20-21?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 6a</a> in the name of Rav Nachman Bar Yitzchok who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</strong> to Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin: <strong>What is written in the phylacteries of the Master of the world? Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin replied: It is written: “Who is like Your people, Israel, one nation in the land?”</strong> (I Chronicles 17:21). God’s phylacteries serve to connect Him, in a sense, to the world, the essence of which is Israel. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak continues: Is the Holy One, Blessed be He, glorified through the glory of Israel? Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin answered: Yes, as indicated by the juxtaposition of two verses; as it is stated: <strong>“You have affirmed, this day, that the Lord is your God, and that you will walk in His ways and keep His laws and commandments, and listen to His voice.</strong>” And the subsequent verse states: \n  “And the Lord has affirmed, this day, that you are His treasure, as He\n  spoke to you, to keep His commandments”</p>\n  \n  <p>(Deuteronomy 26:17–18). From these two verses it is derived that\n  <strong>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: You have made Me a single entity [ḥativa] in the world, as you singled Me out as separate\n  and unique. And because of this, I will make you a single entity in\n  the world, and you will be a treasured nation, chosen by God.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This idea is also discussed by the Rogatchover Gaon in connection with the reasons behind why the judgements against the <em>Rebellious City</em> are different from those of the individual, even though the transgression is the same. For Jews, the <em>Community</em>, meaning Tzibbur, is a distinct entity.</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe also discusses this concept, quoting the Rosh, in connection with the subject of <strong>ציבור לא מת</strong>, that the Tzibbut does not die. See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yachin_on_Mishnah_Temurah.2.16.1?vhe=Mishnah,_ed._Romm,_Vilna_1913&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yachin to Mishnah Temurah 2:16:1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_Yom_Tov_on_Mishnah_Temurah.2.2.3?vhe=Mishnah,_ed._Romm,_Vilna_1913&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot Yom Tov to Mishnah Temurah 2:2:3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Steinsaltz_on_Temurah.15b.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Hebrew&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Steinzaltz to Temurah 15b:6</a>, and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The mitzvah for the Noahide is not to fail to establish courts of justice. The function of these courts is to arbitrate disputes between non-Jews and to educate them about their individual responsibilities as members in a civilized society. All of this promotes the general peace.</p>\n\n<p>When you ask to what extent should the individual exert themselves in that direction, it would seem to be associated with the desired result. If an increase in unresolved disputes and the breakdown of society is being observed, it is an indication that there is a lack in establishing those courts of justice whether to resolve disputes or to educate the public about their commonwealth. It is clearly in their best interest as individuals when the society functions peacefully.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your discussion of whether modern day, secular courts fulfill the concept of the Noahide court, this would seem to revolve around who is a Noahide and who is not. Simply being a non-Jew does not qualify someone as being a Noahide. A Noahide acquires that status through meeting the legal definitions outlined within the Torah. In that context, none of the current, secular, civil courts among the non-Jews, that I am aware of, would meet that criteria simply by definition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam (Maimonides) in Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and Wars (9:14), states that Noahides are obligated to establish courts of justice in every city, indicating a collective duty.</p>\n\n\n",

Is there any reason why I can't sell my chameitz to a non-Jew, such as a neighbor, myself?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is no Halachic restriction stopping you from selling your chametz to a gentile, provided that you make a valid sale in accordance with all the pertaining halachot. However this becomes a bit complicated once you take into account that you most probably will buy back the chametz from the gentile after pesach, this can potentially render your sale invalid if you don't do it properly and with full sincerity. In addition there is a timing issue, e.g. if you sell to early and you are still using the chametz, or if you sell too late and there was already a chiyuv to burn it, etc. For these reasons (in most cases) it is better to sell through your LOR. </p>\n\n<p>As a side note I will mention a story I once heard from my Rebbi: In a particular kehila they had written in the mechira contract that they are selling all wheat products. They had mistakenly failed to write all <strong>leavened</strong> wheat products, thereby selling their matza together with their chometz & potentially being mevatel their mitzvah of eating matzah on Leil Pesach or even being mevatel the mechira (because they had no intention to sell their matza so when they signed the contract they were not actually having in mind to be bound by the language it used.). I don't remember when my Rebbi actually caught the mistake. This story goes to show how easy it is to botch up and cause serious issues.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one open the chametz closet for any reason during Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My understanding of the prohibition of <em>Bal Yer'aeh</em> (Do not see / find the chametz) is that it is a \"protection\" against eating the chametz. Thus, the chametz is usually stored in a sealed closet.</p>\n\n<p>What if someone knows exactly which items are chametz in his closet, but needs to retrieve something from the closet during Pesach. Would he be allowed to open the closet to retrieve any of these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pesach food item (such as a canned item) needed for the current Pesach meal</li>\n<li>Non-food item not meal related (a book)</li>\n<li>Non-food item needed for current Pesach meal (e.g. paper plates)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Would the prohibition / permissibility matter if it was \"mitzvah\" item? E.g. the <em>Haggadot</em> are in the closet, and you don't have siddurim or anything else containing the <em>Hagaddah</em> text, around, and you don't know the entire <em>Haggadah</em> text by heart. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Torah (Shmos 12:7, Devarim 16:4) uses the language of \"your chametz shall not be seen\". \"Hebrew; Lecha\".</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Pesachim (5b) teaches that this means you may not see your own chametz on Pesach but you may see the chametz owned by others (example: a Gentile).</p>\n\n<p>However, if you do sell the chametz to a Gentile before Pesach, The chametz needs a proper transfer act (kinyan) from the Jew to the Gentile. Also, the chametz should be removed from the Jew's property and delivered to the Gentile. A reason for this (besides kinyan) is to show that this is not a fake sale (since the goods were delivered to the Gentile's domain) and also because if the chametz is destroyed by accident, the Jew may be construed as being responsible for the lost chametz. The Gemara in Pesachim (5b; Rava's ruling to the people of Machuza) explains that we should remove even Gentile owned chametz from our homes if we are financially responsible for that chametz. (sources, see: Shulchan Aruch O.C. 448; Terumas HaDeshen 120; Magen Avraham 448:4) </p>\n\n<p>In order to help relieve all of these issues (and since more and more Jews found themselves owning more chametz before Pesach) the Bach (Bach to S.A. O.C. 448:2) issued a ruling that the Jew could designate a space in his home (instead of the hard task of delivery) that he sells as real estate to the Gentile along with the chametz. Now the chametz has been \"removed from the Jew's domain\" , and \"delivered to the Gentile\".</p>\n\n<p>However, the contract doing so need not grant the Gentile such exclusive right to the designated space as to automatically and completely bar the Jew's access to that space. It is enough that the Gentile own it or rent it from the Jew. The Gentile need not be consulted each time you wish to access the area designated for the Gentiles storage of delivered and sold chametz within your home. However, one should try not to access that space.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, according to Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 440:2), you still should have the Gentile's area separated by a partition or covered over since we do not want Jewish household members to forget or be confused and access the chametz without thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, since all of the above are precautionary measures, and not an absolute obligation to deny your access to the area, you can if need demands, access the area to retrieve an item you did not sell on Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yirmiyahu Kaganoff was asked this question and discusses his answer at <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/may-i-enter-the-room-that-i-sold-to-the-non-jew/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">May I Enter the Room that I Sold to the Non-Jew</a> and concludes that one is allowed to enter the room that was rented to the nonJew. His teshuva was translated from the original Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>The main problem was that the <em>Terumas Hadeshen</em> insisted that the chametz had to be completely removed from the property of the Jew. However, Rabbi Kaganoff concludes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most later authorities explain that one is permitted to leave the\n  non-Jew’s chometz in one’s house, provided that he has taken adequate\n  care that no one mistakenly eat it. The reason that the Terumas\n  Hadeshen insisted on removing the chometz from the Jew’s property was\n  because of the technical laws that must be followed in order to change\n  ownership of the chometz  to the non-Jew. However, should one\n  accomplish changing ownership to the gentile without moving it out of\n  your house, you are not required to do so.</p>\n  \n  <p>One of the standard methods we use of guaranteeing that the sale of\n  our chometz to the gentile is fully valid is to rent to the gentile\n  for the entire holiday the area where the chometz is stored. However,\n  even when one rented to the gentile the area where the chometz is\n  stored, this rental should not preclude the Jew from entering this\n  area for a short period of time.

Therefore the Hebrew language never employs the\n  word tabnit in speaking of the qualities of God Almighty.</p>\n  \n  <p>The term temunah, on the other hand, is used in the Bible in three\n  different senses. It signifies, first, the outlines of things which\n  are perceived by our bodily senses, i.e., their shape and form; as,\n  e.g., \"And ye make an image the form (temunat) of some likeness\"\n  (Deut. iv. 16); \"for ye saw no likeness\" (temunah) (Deut. iv. 15).\n  Secondly, the forms of our imagination, i.e., the impressions retained\n  in imagination when the objects have ceased to affect our senses. In\n  this sense it is used in the passage which begins \"In thoughts from\n  the visions of the night\" (Job iv. 13), and which concludes \"it\n  remained but I could not recognize its sight, only an\n  image--temunah--was before my eyes,\" i.e., an image which presented\n  itself to my sight during sleep.

Hershel Schachter</a> has discussed this issue a number of times, and explains it thus:</p>\n\n<p>It is based on technicalities of kinyanim. One of the kinyanim that is used for selling chametz is a kinyan chatzer. A potential issue raised with this kinyan is that a kinyan chatzer works as a shliach, and a non-Jew does not have the ability to create a shliach. However, this is only true for a man. For a woman, a chatzer works as a yad. Therefore it is possible that a kinyan chatzer with a non-Jew only works if the non-Jew is a woman.</p>\n\n<p>He says that because of this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sofer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Moshe Sofer</a> would specifically sell the chametz to a woman. You can hear him explain this, among other places, <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/849026/rabbi-hershel-schachter/chullin-shiur-90-yifh/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> starting at approximately 27 minutes in.</p>\n\n<p>(This is an oversimplification, so you should listen to the shiur. Even the shiur is an oversimplification, so perhaps a good place to start is the Ketzos 194:3.)</p>\n\n<p>The original source for this Chumra is the Machatzis Hashekel OC 448, s.v. Vetzarich Iyun (see the full discussion for details):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולכן עלה ברוחי <strong>דעדיף למכור לאשה גויה שאין לה בעל</strong>, דכהאי גוונא איכא למימר דמודה תשובת אמונת שמואל דחצרה קונה לה, דמבואר בחו\"מ סימן רמ\"ג [סעיף כג] דקטן אין לו חצר, דלגבי איש חצר מטעם שליחות אתרבי ואין שליחות לקטן, אבל קטנה יש לה חצר דגבי אשה חצר משום יד אתרבי וקטנה יש לה יד. ואם כן אשה גויה יש לה חצר דהא אית לה יד.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I finally found one source that deals with this, hope to find more.</p>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"http://www.kipa.co.il/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%A8-%D7%9C%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A5-%D7%99%D7%93-%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%94/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this site</a>, we find the following question to Rav Aviner:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שאלה: האם לאור דברי הגר\"מ פיינשטיין שמותר לנסוע ברכבת תחתית על אף שקשה להיזהר מנגיעה, מותר להחזיר יד לאישה כאשר היא מושיטה?‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his answer, he quotes Rav Reuven Feinstein in Sefer Masores Moshe, who says that he asked Rav Moshe if one CAN sell Chametz to a woman, and Rav Moshe told him that in fact, that was the Minhag in his hometown, although he does not provide any reason why it would be preferable, just why it would be permitted.  (He also found a way to get around the handshake):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תשובה: מה זה קשור? והרי הגרמ\"פ עצמו כתב שקשה להתיר החזרת יד. שו\"ת אגרות משה אע\"ה א נו. ד לב (<strong>ופעם הג\"ר ראובן פיינשטיין שאל את אביו הגרמ\"פ: האם מותר למכור חמץ לנכרית? והשיב: \"אין חסרון במכירת חמץ לנכרית, ושבאמת כך נהגו באוזדא [עיר מולדת שלו], דהלא אין 'מעשה ידיה' של נכריה, לבעלה. ולגבי התקיעת כף - או שלא יעשה, או איזה אשה יהודיה תעשה\". מסורת משה עמ' תה.</strong> א\"כ ברור שהגרמ\"פ לא התיר לחיצת יד אישה גם כשיש צורך).‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that in Igros Moshe OC 5:20 he discusses the issue of possibly selling Chametz to a non-Jewish woman who is married to a Jew, and suggests that there is no issue of what she owns perhaps going to her husband.

Gerizim and Mt. Eval, they became one community and obligated (for all time) to make sure that none of their fellows would sin, or else be punished themselves for lack of taking responsibility for their neighbors actions.</p>\n\n<p>So, if your fellow Jew sins, and you could have prevented it, you are also liable to punishment, and are obliged to try and stop the other person from sinning.</p>\n\n<p>Levit. 19:17 states: (\"Hocheyach Tochiyach\") \"You shall not hate your brother in your heart. <strong>You shall surely rebuke</strong> your fellow, but you shall not bear a sin on his account.\"</p>\n\n<p>From here we learn the general obligation that every Jew is obligated to rebuke another who is sinning.</p>\n\n<p>Levit. 19:14 also tells us: \"lifnei iver\" \"...You shall not place a stumbling block <strong>before a blind person</strong>...\"</p>\n\n<p>It is a mitzvah to not cause another Jew to violate a Torah prohibition. (see Rambam Sefer HaMitzvos negative command 299)</p>\n\n<p>Based on these verses and chazal, it is instantly understood that one must help a Jew who does not know they are Jewish by letting him/her know and showing them how to practice Judaism. Certainly, one should not be a party to allowing a Jewish child to be given to a gentile family.</p>\n\n<p>A \"tinok shenishbah\" or an \"infant that was captured\" by gentiles, is the subject of Talmud shabbos 68b. There, Rav and Shmuel both agree that although the child will spend many Sabbaths violating the laws of Shabbos unknowingly and unwittingly, the child will eventually be obligated to bring a korban (sin offering) as soon as they find out they are Jewish and what Shabbos really means. (even Rabbi Yochanan and Reish Lakish agree that the child is living a life of sin albeit forcibly, so as not to require the official offering) The Rambam paskens (decides) according to Rav and Shmuel, that the Halachah requires such a person to make up for their sins with a korban. (see Rambam Hilchos Shegagos 2:6 ; 7:2)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we certainly have an obligation to help such a \"tinok shenishbah\" become aware they are Jewish, so they can stop sinning and keep Shabbos (as well as all the Torah).</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam says that anyone who does not believe in Torah sheh'baal peh, is not even considered in the category of \"Israel\". However, if a child of such a person grew up in that father's community, (of heretics) we should treat that child as a \"tinok shenishbah\" and try to speak with that child in a peaceful manner in order to bring them back to Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>(see Rambam Hilchos Mamrim 3:2-3 )</p>\n\n<p>It should be learned from this Rambam, that a Jewish child living among gentiles (who are certainly not in the category of \"Israel\") would also be treated like a \"tinok shenishbah\". We would have to inform the child he is Jewish and re-affiliate them in a friendly way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemara Gittin 47a</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>\"If someone sells himself and his children to idol-worshippers, we do not redeem him but we redeem the children.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"(We redeem the children) because of the ruin (that may befall them), how much more so, where there is a chance of murder.\"</p>\n\n<p>From here we see that even if there is no risk of murder, we would redeem children (even without their parents) back into the Jewish community.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gemara Gittin 57a</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbis taught: It once happened that Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Chananya was travelling to a great city in Rome. They said to him, \"There is a baby in the prison who has beautiful eyes and a fine appearance, and his locks are arranged in curls\"....</p>\n\n<p>The story continues that R' Yehoshua found out he was a Jewish child and redeemed him.

They were tasked with finding lost Jewish children in orphanges. They came to a monastary in France which housed an orphanage for victims of the war years. R' Silver asked that the Jewish children be handed over. The priests denied there were any Jewish children there. So, R' Silver went to the children by bedtime and started reciting the bedtime Shma Yisroel verses out loud.

So he answered, that all foods can be good in measure. Sugar can be good sprinkled here and there. Even a fattening sugary cheesecake can be a kosher treat at the right time and place. However, overindulgence is a choice. It is overindulgence that makes some foods dangerous. That's the consumer's business, not the Kashrus industry's business to regulate.

However he isn’t an observant Jewish person, nand nor are his kids (my daughter in law is Christian, my son is Christian Catholic).  That said, I think it’s important for my grandchildren to learn about thisother part of their “family tree” and my son and daughter in law have said I am welcome to teach them about it since I find it so important. Now, I grew up in nyc and had friends from every faith tradition when I was younger, but I now live in Ohio and unfortunately my social circle is small and I don’t know any Jewish people here, so I don’t know where to start.  Can you share the name of a synagogue that would be open to a non  Jewish person attending and learning about the Jewish faith with my grandchildren?  Thank you. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>So from the way I understand your question, your daughter-in-law's father is Jewish. Right? Well, sadly, if your daughter-in-law's mother isn't Jewish, that mean she isn't either, which means your grandchildren are one hundred percent not Jewish. (This isn't a bad thing, necessarily, although it is sad that the Jewish grandfather chose to intermarry, which is a sin according to the Torah.) </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, any education you want to give your children on Judaism should not be done with the intention of showing them at they are Jewish, because they aren't.</p>\n\n<p>Taking your grandchildren to a Jewish establishment to help them learn about Judaism might give them the wrong impression that they are Jewish, and it might come as a shock (or disappointment) when they learn that they aren't considered Jewish at all. </p>\n\n<p>I'd suggest finding a video or something, or teaching them what you know about Judaism yourself. They don't need to learn the ins and outs of the religion, because they aren't Jewish. You mentioned that you are Catholic, therefore you should be familiar with the story of Abraham, the Exodus, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

Abraham of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Viterbo</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן הוא מציאות ה' שהענין אמת אע\"פי שאין לו מופת זו היא כונת בעל העקרים\n  וראיתו יותר נכונה מכל ראיות הרב</p>\n  \n  <p>And so it is [with regard to] the existence of God – it is true even\n  though there is no proof for it.

Joseph Albo]</a>, and his evidence is better than all\n  the evidence of the Rav<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> [Rambam]</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It depends what you mean by \"rationally\". There are <em>rishonim</em> who believed that a <strong>philosophical</strong> proof of G-d was either pointless or meaningless. For example, Rabbi Yehudah haLevi has the <em>Chaver</em> say in the first chapter of the Kuzari:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That which you are describing is religion based on speculation and system, the research of much thought, yet open to many doubts. Now ask the philosophers, and you will find that they do not agree on any one action nor any one principle, since some doctrines can be established by arguments, which are only partially satisfactory, and still much less capable of being proved. (Kuzari 1:13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then later:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is an excuse for the Philosophers. Being Greeks, science and religion did not come to them as inheritances. They belong to the descendants of Yafes, who inhabited the north, while that knowledge coming from Adam, and supported by the divine influence, is only to be found among the progeny of Sheim, who represented the successors of Noah and constituted, as it were, his essence. This knowledge has always been connected with this essence, and will always remain so. The Greeks only received it when they became powerful, from Persia. The Persians had it from the Chaldaeans. It was only then that the famous [Greek] Philosophers arose, but as soon as Rome assumed political leadership they produced no philosopher worthy the name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We have knowledge of G-d from trusted sources -- our own ancestors. The Greeks did the best they can with less inherited knowledge and much deduction, but as he said earlier, such results are unreliable and open to debate.</p>\n\n<p>The Kuzari invokes something much like what epistemologists today call \"Reliabilism\". Which is a pretty rational reason to believe something. If you get a lot of useful advice from a medical textbook, at some point it's irrational to double-check every fact before using it. Similarly, the information from your parents or a tradition from our whole culture.</p>\n\n<p>But it's likely not the kind of \"rational proof\" you were talking about.</p>\n\n<p>It also draws a very different image of G-d. To the Rambam, one proves G-d Exists (Moreh Nevuchim, sec II, about the first third or so) and from there that such a G-d would talk to prophets, give a Torah, <em>halakhah</em>, etc... (Taking us through to the rest of the Moreh.)</p>\n\n<p>To Rabbi Yehudah haLevi, we start similar to the way the <em>Aseres haDiberos</em> start, \"I am Hashem your G-d Who took you out of the land of Egypt\" (1:11):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I believe in the G-d of Avraham, Yitzchaq and Yisrael, the One Who led the children of Israel out of Egypt with signs and miracles; Who fed them in the desert and gave them a land, after having made them cross the [Red] Sea and the Jordan in a miraculous way; who sent Moshe with His Torah, and subsequently thousands of prophets, who confirmed His Law by promises to the observant, and threats to the disobedient. Our belief is comprised in the Torah--a very large domain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The king of the Khazars is unhappy with this answer, expecting a more philosophical approach to G-d (par. 12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I had not intended to ask any Jew, because I am aware of their low state and narrow-minded views, as their misery left them nothing admirable. Now shouldn't you, Jew, have said that you believe in the Creator of the world, its Governor and Guide, and in Him who created and sustains you, and such attributes which serve as evidence for every believer, and for the sake of which He pursues justice in order to resemble the Creator in His wisdom and justice?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that is when the <em>Chaver</em> gives the response we saw above (par. 13), about how limited philosophy is at establishing truth. But his alternative is equally rationalist.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam's audience was influenced by a Moslem school of thought of the time called the <em>Kalam</em>, which eventually makes it to Christianity as Scholasticism. They take Aristotilian philosophy as discovered Truth, religion as revealed Truth, and try to make one picture of reality from the two. So his \"Guide to the Perplexed\" is a Jewish Qalam type picture.</p>\n\n<p>The Kuzari was written before the Rambam's lifetime. (Perhaps it was a response to an even earlier Jewish Aristotilian, Rav Saadia Gaon and his \"Emunos veDei'os\".) However, the <em>rishonim</em> of Catalonia responded in the following centuries with a countervailing tendency. In particular, including the Ramban, the Ran, his student R' Yosef Albo and his Seifer haIqarim, and <em>his</em> student, Rav Chesdei Crescas in Or Hashem. There's was a staunchly rational approach, philosophical, but less accepting of Greek thought. Although in the language of the day, Or Hashem was an anti-philosophical work, that is only because \"philosophy\", then, was thought of as being the Greek kind in particular.</p>\n\n<p>As per the name of his book, \"Seifer haIqarim\", Rav Albo believed that Judaism was founded on three postulates \"<em>iqarim</em>\" (essentials). From which one can derive 9 more mandatory beliefs, \"<em>shorashim</em>\" (roots), and many many other implications, \"anafim\" (branches). Interestingly, his list of 3 <em>iqarim</em> and 9 <em>shorashim</em> closely resembles the Rambam's 13 <em>iqarei emunah</em> (mandatory beliefs, none of which were held to be postulates). The 3 <em>iqarim</em> include belief that the universe has a Creator. (The other two are that the Creator revealed Truth to humans and that He metes out justice.) Belief in G-d is a postulate, not something proven from other postulates. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/90707/1570\">Alex's answer</a>.) Which is typical of this school.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, off in Ashkenaz, there was little organized study of philosophy. You can glean things about worldview between the cracks, by implications of comments made about Tanakh or <em>halakhah</em>. But nothing like the Ramban's commentary, where he would take the time to spell out a philosophical point.</p>\n\n<p>An outlier case was one of the Tosafists, Rav Moshe ben Chasdai Taqu, who wrote a work called Kesav Tamim, of which only portions survived. He is usually assumed to be the one referred to by the Raavad when the Raavad objects to the Rambam labeling anyone who believes that Hashem has a body is a heretic. The Raavad says that at least one rabbi greater and more pious than the Rambam had such a belief.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Kesav Tamim doesn't actually say that Hashem has a body, at least not in any text that survived. Rather, he so completely denies being able to reason about G-d that he says we cannot rule out Hashem having a body. In contrast to the Rambam, who says that G-d is so unfathomable all we can do is rule out what He isn't, Rav Moshe Taqu is saying all we can do is rely on prophecy and not reason at all.</p>\n\n<p>A rational argument against rationalism. No?</p>\n\n<p>That does not mean he insists we know for sure that phrases found in Tanakh like the \"Hand of G-d\" or \"the anger of His Nostrils\" was definitely meant as literal descriptions of G-d, as opposed to idioms referring to His Control and His Punishing the wicked. It seems more he was saying that in principle we cannot know for sure one way or the other. His primary topic is a polemic against R' Saadia Gaon and the Rambam for bringing philosophy to bear on the question, rather than trusting the Torah's words on their own terms.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, there is at least one <em>rishon</em> who was anti-rationalist, saying that all theology is beyond reason. Then there were many <em>rishonim</em> who were anti-Kalam, who believed that the right way to ground religion was in something other than a philosophical proof from first principles. And yet, still held rational approaches.</p>\n\n\n",

We’ve made <em>kiddush</em> and eaten an appetizer. We’ve brought the food and bread to the table. It looks like the main meal is about to start. We then break the bread.

In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 5:4</a>, the unnamed <em><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannaim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tana</a></em> says that ten plagues were suffered in Egypt, and ten on the Sea. </p>\n\n<p>Why is this <em>tana</em>'s opinion not included in the Hagada?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The opinion in Avos is fundamentally different from those in the Haggada. The opinion in Avos is simply stating that 10 things happened in Egypt and 10 things happened by the sea. The opinions in the Haggada however, are explaining how each thing was really multiple makkos (based on expounding certain words and then using a 1:5 ratio from finger to hand). Perhaps the purpose of these passages in the Haggada is to highlight how not only did God redeem us and perform wonders, he even kept on adding more and more to it (this fits the theme of dayeinu that immediately follows). The opinions quoted in the Haggada demonstrate this, while the opinion in Avos does not. Thus that opinion was not cited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps the Mishna in Avos is consistent with all three opinions in the hagadah. All three opinions in the hagadah must agree that there were ten plagues in Mitzraim, yet they argue if there were ten, forty or fifty. The idea is obviously that each plague can be counted for more than one, if broken down into more detail. This would mean, that the given is that there were sets of ten and ten plagues, then the question would be how many each plague of each set would count for. And I'll attempt to prove this.</p>\n\n<p>If you notice, the one to five ratio is derived from the fact that the plagues in Mitzraim are referred to as the finger of G-d and the splitting of the sea as His Hand. This may be hard to understand, since only one plague was referred to as a finger of G-d, not all of them combined, so perhaps the Mitzraim Plagues totaled ten, and the Sea Plagues totaled five?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is, that the actual amount of plagues, when counted broadly as in the Torah, is non-negotiably ten and ten. The question remains as to the severity of each set. So if a Mitzraim Plague can be called a finger, and a Sea plague a hand, then the consensus is that these refer to severity and not amounts, and it can be inferred that the ten of the Sea can be counted as five times that of Mitzraim.</p>\n\n<p>[sorry, this is just an oversimplified version of Alex's answer, with a proof]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Another possibility re <em>Avot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Frequently in Talmudic literature, multiple ideas that fit a pattern or theme are clustered. Chapter 5 of Avot is a \"classic\" example. You have groups of 4's, and, as you see, here, groups of 10's. So, this was placed in Avot. </p>\n\n<p>Likewise in the <em>Hagaddah</em>, you find a pattern of different rabbis all using the same verse to compare the number of plagues. So they included these 3. The one from <em>Avot</em> doesn't fit the <em>Hagaddah's</em> pattern.</p>\n\n\n",

Has anybody here used either of these Artscroll Mishna commentaries?</p>\n\n<p>What I would like is (if at all possible) a comprehensive breakdown of Artscroll's \"Mishnayos\", for the purposes of comparison. Are they comprehensive? Easy to read? Easy on the eyes?</p>\n\n<p>Effectively, would you recommend one of them over the other, and why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>I have learned the entire Mishna based on the Yad Avraham series in English. I also own much of the newer Schottenstein Edition of the Mishna. Here are a few thoughts</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I found the introductions to each tractate to be incredibly well done and useful. Just reviewing the introductions to all tractates would be in itself wonderful learning. I compared the introductions to Brachot and it is somewhat more detailed in the Yad Avraham edition</li>\n<li>The commentary in the Yad Avraham edition is very very very (!) detailed. It was too much for me when learning the text but is obviously what you want if you are interested to go in depth in certain places</li>\n<li>The translation between both is very different. Yad Avraham translates the English \"in one go\", like the Stone Chumash does, while Schottenstein has the literal translation a few words, then a few words of explanation to make it a running text, then again literal translation. Exactly as the elucidation of the Talmud Bavli you refer to. The latter (Schottenstein) is far more readable and avoids to constantly need to refer to the notes</li>\n<li>The Yad Avraham has 44 volumes, the new Schottenstein has 21. In the introduction to Schottenstein, artscroll themselves address the difference between them. They write</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Yad Avraham is an encyclopedic, in-depth commentary that presents\n  many explanations and explores nuances and complexities, raises\n  questions and cites a wide variety of works on the Mishnah and Talmud.\n  Its thoroughness has won the praise of even masters of the Talmud\n  throughout the world so that those who study and benefit from the\n  Schottenstein edition may turn to the Yad Avraham commentary when they\n  wish to delve into the nuances of the Mishna more deeply and explore a\n  wider range of comments. Thus, in effect, the two editions complement\n  each other</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I learn the Mishna again from beginning to the end, I plan to use the Schottenstein edition.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, note that</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I bought the \"<a href=\"http://search.artscroll.com/Books/9781422610800.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">personal size</a>\" (small size) full set which retails for 500$ but can regularly be bought at an additional discount of 10-20% when artscroll runs a sale. You can also buy one order of the mishna now to start learning and buy the others when the discounts start</li>\n<li>The Schottenstein is about 30% cheaper (4 sets of Zeraim, Moed, Nezikin, Nashim are about 200$ vs 290$ for Yad Avraham)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

It seems that most of the opinions state that one should say a bracha in shul.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that there is always a requirement to say a bracha before Hallel. Th exception is the Hallel said during the Seder, and the linked answer sattes a reason why the bracha is omitted.</p>\n\n<p>So this makes me wonder about Chazon Ish's opinion not to say the bracha in shul. Is it because he is \"imitating\" the same rule that the bracha is omitted at the Seder Hallel, or is there something else to his reasoning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Just saw this <em>Ran</em> (<em>Pesachim 26</em>, <em>dapei Harif</em>). He discusses the opinions regarding the bracha on Hallel at the Seder itself. </p>\n\n<p>1) Make a bracha, either at the meal or in <em>shul</em>, whatever comes first. Saying it in Shul seems to be a \"Good Thing\", but not obligatory (based on <em>Meseches Soferim</em>).</p>\n\n<p>2) He quotes Rav Hai Gaon as not reuiring a bracha, because \"This is not <em>kerias Hallel</em>, but a <em>shirah</em>\", as we say in the Haggada <em>Lefichach...</em> \"and thus we must praise etc.\" </p>\n\n<p>(Ed. I assume he means that it doesn't need a bracha because the <em>shira</em> is part of the Haggada \"experience\", which itself, for some reason, doesn't get a bracha.)</p>\n\n<p>This would then support either not saying it at all in <em>shul</em>, as we haven't said the Haggada, and certainly not saying a bracha.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the continuation of the <em>Ran</em> seems to indicate a different reason for not saying a bracha at the Seder, which conforms better to <em>Meseches Soferim</em>, as well as a Yerushalmi he brings. He writes that since people who say a bracha in <em>shul</em> wouldn't say one at home, <em>Chazal</em> \"made things equal\" and removed the requirement for a bracha.</p>\n\n<p>This approach clearly assumes that <em>shul</em> does get a bracha, (and Seder should but doesn't) but doesn't fit with Rav Hai's reasoning of <em>shira</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur, AFAIK, implies that since the bracha on Hallel at the seder is a dispute, it's good to say it in <em>shul</em> with a bracha, which fits with the Ran himself.</p>\n\n<p>So, in summary, the original opinion of Rav Hai not to say a bracha at the seder would also account for not saying a bracha anywhere else. If the Chazon Ish was worried about that, that may be why ruled against saying a bracha. The reading of Hallel is then simply in deference to the <em>Meseches Sofrim</em> passage which implied that it's a \"Good Thing\" to say it in <em>shul</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Bittul (nullification) and Mechira (sale)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sorry if this is a duplicate. It is my understanding that one must sell his chometz, prior to declaring his chometz nullified. Reason being, how can one sell something that is null and void? It is also my understanding that the rav sells the chometz in the hour prior to it becoming assur behana - forbidden to benefit from. \nMust one find out exactly when the rav is selling to ensure he didn’t nullify too soon? This is very applicable for someone who burns his chometz earlier, in theory he should post pone his nullification until the last moment to ensure the rav sold it. Is this correct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban Pesachim 4b says that Bittul (nullification) can <em>only</em> work on chametz that he completelely abandons ownership.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ה\"מבטלו בליבו\" - אין אדם עובר אלא על חמץ שלו שהוא רוצה בקיומו ודעתו עליו, הא נתייאש ממנו ונתן דעתו שאינו רוצה מחמת איסורו, ולא יהנה בו לעולם, אינו עובר<br>\n  \"he annuls it in His heart\" - A person is only considered in possession of Chometz (and subsequently transgresses bal yerae on pesach) if he wants its existence and he is thinking about keeping it. Only if he abandons it and says in his mind that he does not want it and will not benefit from it for ever after is he free of its possession.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So chametz that one wants to benefit from through sale to a gentile is <strong>automatically not included in this nullification</strong> since one does not abandon possession of the chametz as either:<br>\n1. Monetary benefit will come out of the sale if the gentile wants his chametz,<br>\n2. He will repossess the chametz after Pesach from the gentile and eventually have personal benefit.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>{Note: i think this idea is also illustrated in Nedarim 43b: כל הנודר אין דעתו על מה שהפקיר - one automatically does not forbid something verbally (amount his other possessions) that he had declared owner-less (even though it's still in the owners domain ), so too something which will be owned by someone else via sale (even though it's still in the owners domain ) is automatically not included in the Bittul, which is also a verbal declaration, since he has already set his mind to save that chametz for someone else.}</p>\n\n\n",

Is this discussed by Rishonim?</p>\n\n<p>If it is true, does anyone hold like Rabbah (or are they at least worried enough to take this position into account)?

Cooking close to when it gets dark, in such a way that it is not possible for him to use it on Yom Tov itself (i.e. before Shabbat) could involve a <em>melacha de'oraita</em> ... They wrote that for this reason we are accustomed to pray Ma'ariv early on Friday night when it falls immediately following Yom Tov, so that one won't delay his cooking on Yom Tov until close to dark.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, Mishnah Berurah (following <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.527.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 527:1</a>) rules that one should follow Rabbah i.e. that cooking for Shabbat on Yom Tov with an Eruv Tavshilin needs to rely on <em>ho'il</em> and therefore should be completed early in the day.</p>\n\n<p>However, he then refers the reader to what he wrote in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%9B%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bi'ur Halachah</a>, where he notes that there are many Rishonim on both sides of the question of whether the halachah is like Rabbah or Rav Chisdah.</p>\n\n<p>His bottom line is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וע\"כ נראה דאף דלכתחלה בודאי צריך לזהר כדעת כל הני רבוותא הנ\"ל ושהוא בענין דאורייתא וכמ\"ש האחרונים מ\"מ בשעת הדחק י\"ל דכדאי הם רבותינו הראשונים האלה לסמוך עליהם בענין סמוך לחשיכה ... וכ\"ש ביו\"ט שני שהוא דרבנן בודאי יש לסמוך להקל לעת הצורך</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore it appears that although ideally one should be careful for the above-mentioned opinions of all our Rabbis [that one must finish cooking early enough before dark] as we are dealing with a <em>de'oraita</em> as the Acharonim wrote, nevertheless, in pressing circumstances, we can say that is is appropriate to rely on these [other] Rishonim to cook close to dark ...

With food, it is quite frequent; according to some opinions, one makes a bracha first on the food one likes most. One may arguably omit meat or fish or other traditional foods Shabbos if (and only if) one doesn't like them.

Shidduchim--and the necessity of seeing a potential bride, and choosing her based at least somewhat on one's own tastes--come to mind. In this arena, one's personal יש--that which makes him himself rather than another Yid with the same status--is ascribed some sort of religious legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>There were also nedoves, freewill offerings, which we also have in tefilla today. And finally, I once read an opinion that the decision of whether to say hamapil before or after other bedtime prayers should be based on one's personal sense of what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone point out other significant or interesting points of halacha where the individual judgment of a layperson determines the law?

The reason to do so is that all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt. For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, had not been circumcised. For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD; unto whom the LORD swore that He would not let them see the land which the LORD swore unto their fathers that He would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. And He raised up their children in their stead; them did Joshua circumcise; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised by the way. </p>\n\n<p>I always assumed that because all the males had to be circumcised all these circumcised men that left Egypt died on their way, and all that were born during their trip were uncircumcised. But that's because my bible translation reads: '<strong>even</strong> all the men of war'. But this word '<strong>even</strong>' was added to verse 4 and 6 and is not shown in the literal Hebrew. </p>\n\n<p>So without this it seems to be about all males who were men of war that died in the wilderness. Then I found <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.32.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 32:11</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.32.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13</a> confirming this teaching\nthat the males within the age of 20 and above wouldn't see the land, for He made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed except for Kalev and Yehoshua (see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.26.64-65?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 26:64-65</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 2:14</a>).</p>\n\n<p>But then again I looked at Bamidbar 14 were it all started: \nThe spies came back and made the whole edat rebel and say that it would have been better to have died in Egypt or even on this way trough the wilderness. And so HaShem punishes them by letting them die exactly as they wanted in the wilderness. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So here are my questions:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>1)</strong> Which group of males exactly needed to be circumcised here? and which group died?</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>2)</strong> Why did HaShem held only the males from the age of 20 and above responsible? (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.14.29?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 14:29</a>).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(Subquestions: Does this means that the group in the age under 20 which was circumcised at the moment of Bamidbar, didn't needed to be circumcised at the time of Yehoshua? And didn't their children needed to replace their parents? And does this command given to Yoshua only refered to the children of these men of war? or also to the children of other men within the congregation which were 20 or above at the moment of Bamidbar?). </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would definitely suggest splitting up your questions.  </p>\n\n<p>To answer the first question(s), Radak (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Yehoshua/5.4#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) explains that \"all the man of war\" does not mean all of the men who actually went to war, but rather, it means all those men 20 and above, who were of \"warring age\" when they left Egypt. This seems to be the understanding of many of the commentaries, including Rashi (verses 4-8), although they do not say it as explicitly.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we can conclude that </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>All those who were 20 and older (when the nation left Egypt) died in the desert (verse 4)</li>\n<li>All those that were younger than 20 when they left Egypt were already circumcised (beginning of verse 5)</li>\n<li>Those who were born on the way (in the desert) needed to be circumcised now (verse 5 and 7)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In his words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל אנשי המלחמה – ר״ל מבן עשרים שנה ומעלה כי אותם הם הפקודים ואותם מתו שהיו מולים זהו שאמר כי מולים היו והטעם להודיע כי זה שלא מלו לא בעבור שנשתכחה מהם מצות מילה במצרים או התרשלו עליה כי מולים היו כל העם היוצאים ואפילו לדברי בעל הדרש שאומר שהתרשלו במילה במצרים וסמך לפסוק גם את בדם בריתך שלחתי אסיריך מבור אין מים בו וכן מה שאמר בדמיך חיי פעמיים ר״ל שתי דמים דם פסח ודם מילה אעפ״כ בצאתם מלו כלם קודם שעשו הפסח וזהו שאמר כי מולים היו כל העם היוצאים והנה אותם שהיו מבן עשרים שנה ומעלה מתו במדבר ומבן עשרים שנה ומטה נשארו מולים ולא הוצרך יהושע למול אלא הילודים במדבר שלא היו יכולים למול בדרך כמו שפירשנו ופירוש לא מלו לא מלו אותם כי הוא פעל יוצא.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He is the oldest son, and most Christians presume the husband/father is dead.  Apparently, there are other family members in the city (there is no common agreement if these are children of the same mother, or just close relatives).  Yet he directs one of his disciples to take over the future care of his mother.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that the children were generally responsible for caring for their aging parents; beyond that, I have no knowledge of any laws or customs that might have impacted this situation in this ancient time period.  As such, the following questions came to my mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Would it have been against law or custom to provide care outside the family?</li>\n<li>Would another adult child have been able to challenge this?</li>\n<li>Would the son’s status as a condemned criminal have any impact on any rights to assign this care?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Why is this so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe the expression of the Satan 'dancing' is more to demonstrate his joy at succeeding in his job and is not to be understood in the literal sense.</p>\n<p>With regards to the Gemara you bring in Megillah, the <strong>Ben Yehoyada</strong> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.11b.12?lang=bi&with=Ben%20Yehoyada&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> explains that the 'dancing' was more a celebration of his success in generating a great sense of depravity and immorality:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...בָּא שָׂטָן וְרִקֵּד בֵּינֵיהֶן, רוצה לומר ריקד בתאות הניאוף</p>\n<p><em>The Satan came and danced amongst them - This means to say that he danced at the desire for immorality/adultery</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the case of him 'dancing between his (the ox) horns' as mentioned in Berachos and Pesachim - the <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.112b.6?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Punctuated_Aramaic&lang=bi&p2=Rashbam_on_Pesachim.112b.6.1&vhe2=Vilna_Edition&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a></strong> in Pesachim writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מפני שהשטן מרקד - <strong>לאו דווקא אלא משוגע</strong> כדמפרש לקמן</p>\n<p><em>Because Satan dances between his horns - <strong>not specifically, but rather to make it mad</strong>, as we will explain later</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the implication is that this dancing is not to be taken literally but rather done in an act to antagonise the ox into action. I.e. it is an idiomatic way of saying that the ox is crazed and thus more likely to attack.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting <a href=\"https://www.dafdigest.org/masechtos/Pesachim/Pesachim%20057.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (in the Halacha Highlight section - p.2) that on the subject of arguing for the sake of heaven both the <strong>Nodeh BiYehuda</strong> and the <strong>Chasam Sofer</strong> say that is rare to find nowadays an argument that is truly motivated for the sake of heaven - and the result is that the Satan 'dances at such occasions' - namely, he instigates such 'righteous arguments'. Again understood in a non-literal sense.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kav_HaYashar.88.7?ven=Kav_HaYashar,_trans._Metsudah_Publications,_2007&vhe=Kav_HaYashar,_Metsudah_Publications,_2007&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kav Hayashar 88:7</a></strong> provides further elaboration on understanding this \"dancing\" of Satan in the case of the Ox - again the implication being that this \"dancing\" is a done as a means to antagonise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִנֵּה לֹא בְּחִנָּם הַשָּׂטָן מְרַקֵּד בֵּין קַרְנָיו שֶׁל הַשּׁוֹר, כִּי עִקַּר גַּאֲוַת הַשּׁוֹר הוּא בְּקַרְנָיו, כְּמוֹ הַתַּרְנְגוֹל, שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ גַּאֲוָה בְּכַרְבָּלְתּוֹ. וְלָכֵן מָצָא הַשָּׂטָן שָׁם מָקוֹם לַחֲנִיָּתוֹ, מְקוֹם הַגַּאֲוָה. וְזֶהוּ תּוֹכָחָה מְגֻלָּה עַל כָּל בַּעֲלֵי גַּאֲוָה, הַמִּתְגָּאִים בִּשְׁבִיל עָשְׁרָם אוֹ בִּשְׁבִיל חָכְמָתָם אוֹ בִּשְׁבִיל יִחוּסָם אוֹ בִּשְׁבִיל לִמּוּדָם, יִהְיֶה מַה שֶּׁיִּהְיֶה. אַף אִם הֵם עוֹסְקִים בַּתּוֹרָה, מִכָּל מָקוֹם אִם יֵשׁ בָּהֶם מִדַּת הַגַּאֲוָה, אֲזַי הֵם מֶרְכָּבָה לַסִּטְרָא אָחֳרָא. וְזֶהוּ הָאוֹת מַה שֶּׁנִּזְכַּר, שֶׁהַשָּׂטָן מְרַקֵּד בֵּין קַרְנָיו שֶׁל שׁוֹר שָׁחוֹר, שֶׁשָּׁם מְקוֹם הַגַּאֲוָה</p>\n<p>It is not by chance that the Satan “dances” between the horns of the ox, for that is the main place where its pride is displayed, just as a rooster’s pride is displayed in its comb. Thus the Satan takes up residence there because it is a center of pride. This should serve as an open rebuke to those who glory in their wealth, cleverness, lineage, learning or whatever it might be.

[חידושי רע\"א]:</p>\n<p>And if you recited shema, you haven't fulfilled your mitzvah and you have to recite it again after the burial</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see from here that someone who is exempt from a mitzvah, doing the act isn't considered doing the mitzvah, so they haven't fulfilled the obligation (meaning if they become obligated later they can't rely on what they did earlier).</p>\n<p>However, in Hilchos Pesach the SA (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.475.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 475:5</a>) says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָכַל כַּזַּיִת מַצָּה וְהוּא נִכְפֶּה, בְּעֵת שְׁטוּתוֹ, וְאַחַר כָּךְ נִתְרַפֵּא, חַיָּב לֶאֱכֹל אַחַר שֶׁנִּתְרַפֵּא, לְפִי שֶׁאוֹתָהּ אֲכִילָה הָיְתָה בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁהָיָה פָּטוּר מִכָּל הַמִּצְוֹת.</p>\n<p>Someone who was in a state of insanity and ate matzah and later became better, they have to eat matzah again.

This is because they are a normal person (unlike someone deranged), just the Torah exempted them because they're doing a different mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I see a glaring contradiction here. Someone exempt from a mitzvah who does it anyways, did they fulfill it or not? You could argue one is a case of אונן and one עוסק במצוה, but I don't see the distinction. Besides, I believe an onen is exempt because they have the status of one who is עוסק במצוה, (I found the Magen Avraham <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.696.16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says this</a>, although Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Berakhot.17b.12.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in Berachos</a> says onen is equivalent to a chasan on his wedding night, טרוד במצוה which is related to עוסק במצוה).</p>\n<p>Edit: I found another instance where the Mishnah Berurah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.70.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">70:4 s.k. 18</a>) says someone עוסק במצוה, if they recite Shema, they've fulfilled their obligation. So this seems to be a rule with עוסק במצוה. The only question then is how to differentiate an אונן.

Asher Weiss asks this question on the Mishnah Berurah in Minchat Asher, Devarim 11:3.</p>\n<p>His answer is that Mishnah Berurah must hold (unlike Rashi) that the exemption of <em>onen</em> from <em>mitzvot</em> is not (solely) due to his status as an <em>osek bemitzvah</em>, but because of the principle of <em>kevod hamet</em> (behaving respectfully toward the dead).</p>\n<p>A regular <em>osek bemitzvah</em> is technically obligated in the commandment, but has a  legitimate reason not to perform it.

The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.28a.16?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana 28a</a> says that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שלחו ליה לאבוה דשמואל כפאו ואכל מצה יצא כפאו מאן אילימא כפאו שד והתניא עתים חלים עתים שוטה כשהוא חלים הרי הוא כפקח לכל דבריו כשהוא שוטה הרי הוא כשוטה לכל דבריו</p>\n<p>It is related that the following ruling was sent from Eretz Yisrael to Shmuel’s father: If one was forcibly compelled to eat matza on Passover, he has fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara clarifies the matter: Who compelled him to eat the matza? If we say that a demon forced him, i.e., that he ate it in a moment of insanity, this is difficult. Isn’t it taught in a baraita: With regard to someone who is at times sane and at times insane, at the times when he is sane, he is considered halakhically competent for all purposes and is obligated in all the mitzvot. And when he is insane, he is considered insane for all purposes, and is therefore exempt from the mitzvot. If so, someone who was compelled by a demon to eat matza is not considered obligated to perform the mitzvot at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can even be forced to eat Matzah and be Yotzei.</p>\n<p>Many Acharonim point out this is similar to the Halacha that מתעסק בחלבים ועריות חייב שכן נהנה.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we can differentiate between the Mitzvos being talked about.</p>\n<p>This is the first way to differentiate.\nThe second way is that Tosfos, multiple times in Brachos say that Onen is Assur to do a Mitzvah, not that they are not Chayav. Therefore we do not relate to their action as a Mitzvah, unlike an Osek Bemitzvah.\nI think this is the most simple way to differentiate.\nTosfos in Brachos 17b explicitly say this.</p>\n<p>So if someone is assur to do something, then we don't count it as a Mitzvah.</p>\n<p>If they are Patur, then we do.</p>\n<p>(and the case of insanity is not relevant as it is not viewed as your action)</p>\n\n\n",

Once Avraham had the ה added to his name, the Ayin Hara, which comes from the power of מדת הדין, was able to take hold on him, enslaving his children for 400 years.

The Gemara asks: Granted, it is prohibited to\n  reflect on what is above, what is below, and what is after. This is\n  fine, since one is examining things that are not part of the world but\n  lie beyond it. But before the creation of the world, what has happened\n  has happened. Why is it prohibited to reflect upon this?</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: This can\n  be demonstrated through a parable with regard to a flesh-and-blood\n  king who said to his servants: Build for me large palaces on a garbage\n  dump. They went and built them for him. Clearly, in that case, the\n  king does not desire that they mention the garbage dump. Here too, God\n  does not want people to concern themselves with the chaos that\n  preceded the world. (Translation and elaboration from Sefaria.org)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we see that it is not proper to ponder certain questions.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, Rambam clearly holds (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishne Torah, Foundation of Faith 2:2</a>) that there is an obligation to study the wisdom of Creation as a path to know G-d. And he goes on to explain the fundamentals of scientific knowledge of creation, as well as metaphysics.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But how may one discover the way to love and fear Him? When man will\n  reflect concerning His works, and His great and wonderful creatures,1\n  and will behold through them His wonderful, matchless and infinite\n  wisdom, he will spontaneously be filled with love, praise and\n  exaltation and become possessed of a great longing to know the Great\n  Name, even as David said: \"My soul thirsts for God, for the living\n  God,\" (Ps. 42,2); and when he will think of all these matters,2 he\n  will be taken aback in a moment and stricken with awe, and realize\n  that he is an infinitesimal creature, humble and dark, standing with\n  an insignificant and slight knowledge in the presence of the All Wise,\n  as David said: \"For when I see Thy heavens, the wonderful works of Thy\n  fingers, of what use is man that Thou mayest remember him?\" (Ibid.\n  8,4). And, in harmony with these matters, I elucidate great, general\n  principles of the works of the Lord of the universe, so that they\n  might serve as an opening for one who understands by which to love the\n  Name, as some sages said on the subject of love: \"Out of it thou wilt\n  recognize the One who spoke, and the universe was called into\n  existence.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that anything that is a testable theory about reality falls into the obligation to know G-d's wisdom. String Theory is a mathematical model that attempts to better explain the behavior of matter, although it generally has not yet produced any testable hypothesis.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, Rambam would call scientific principles, such as the laws of nature, angels. \nSee The Guide for the Perplexed Part II ch. 6</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They only show that all parts of the Universe, even the limbs of\n  animals in their actual form, are produced through angels: for natural\n  forces and angels are identical. How bad and injurious is the\n  blindness of ignorance! Say to a person who is believed to belong to\n  the wise men of Israel that the Almighty sends His angel to enter the\n  womb of a woman and to form there the fœtus, he will be satisfied with\n  the account; he will believe it, and even find in it a description of\n  the greatness of God's might and wisdom; although he believes that the\n  angel consists of burning fire, and is as big as a third part of the\n  Universe, yet he considers it possible as a divine miracle. But tell\n  him that God gave the seed a formative power which produces and shapes\n  the limbs, and that this power is called \"angel,\" or that all forms\n  are the result of the influence of the Active Intellect, and that the\n  latter is the angel, the Prince of the world, frequently mentioned by\n  our Sages, and he will turn away; because he cannot comprehend the\n  true greatness and power of creating forces that act in a body without\n  being perceived by our senses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Rambam explains in The Guide for the Perplexed (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_2.23.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">part II, ch. 23 (see also end of ch. 22)</a>) that we do not consider things about the past that are impossible to prove and are inherently philosophical choices. In these areas we rely on tradition and the approach that is best morally.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thirdly, [before choosing a philosophical model] you must be morally good. For if a<br>\n  person is voluptuous or\n  passionate, and, loosening the reins, allows his anger to pass the\n  just limits, it makes no difference whether he is so from nature or\n  from habit, he will blunder and stumble in his way, he will seek the\n  theory which is in accordance with his inclinations. I mention this\n  lest you be deceived; for a person might some day, by some objection\n  which he raises, shake your belief in the theory of the Creation, and\n  then easily mislead you: you would then adopt the theory [of the\n  Eternity of the Universe) which is contrary to the fundamental\n  principles of our religion, and leads to \"speaking words that turn\n  away from God.\" You must rather have suspicion against your own\n  reason, and accept the theory taught by two prophets who have laid the\n  foundation for the existing order in the religious and social\n  relations of mankind. Only demonstrative proof should be able to make\n  you abandon the theory of the Creation: but such a proof does not\n  exist in Nature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Evolution in the past--as opposed to current mutations--and the age of the universe might fall into this category. String Theory as a theory of creation might fall into this speculative category, but as an attempt at a unified theory of everything (joining quantum mechanics and relativity (gravity)), it is certainly good to pursue.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, any theory with practical application today is advisable to pursue. But when a theory is merely a philosophical choice, we choose the one that is morally good, being that there is no practical difference. (In the popular debate between science and religion these two--science and philosophy--are often confused. It is scientifically impossible to prove--and irrelevant--that the world didn't pop into existence last <a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thursday</a>. <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Occam's Razor</a> is a subjective tool for choosing a philosophical model. It can be useful, but it will not always select the model that is most moral.)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In my understanding, the string theory is not about the creation of the world at all, it is about fine-tuning the explanation of the existing phenomena on a smaller, sub-subatomic scale.</p>\n\n<p>All the rests are hypotheses and extrapolations that have nothing to do with the theory.</p>\n\n<p>Halachicly-wise this is not different from the theory of evolution, in Rambam's approach: as long as learning the theory targets a better understanding of the Creation and the ways of G-d and making this world better (יישוב עולם) it is fine, but once it targets heresy and denial of G-d's Creation it is surely forbidden.</p>\n\n\n",

According to the essay brought by @ezra, pythonic sorcery is comprised of different forms of sorcery and divination done with relation to snakes. The Witch of Endor was called by classical and medieval Christians a \"Pythonissa\" which, according to <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/dlc/garland/deweever/PQ/phitonis.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this entry</a>, related her to the priestess of Apollo (better known as \"the Oracle of Delphi\"):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The priestess of Apollo was called Pythia. The witch of Endor is called <em>mulier Pythonem habens</em>, \"a woman having the python,\" I Kings 28:7, indicating that she had some aspects of the pagan priestess. Isidore, in his discussion of magicians, says that the woman who called up Samuel was Pythonissa (<a href=\"http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0706/_P6P.HTM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Etym VIII.ix.7, 21</a>).</p>\n<p>The fiend explains to the summoner that sometimes devils arise with dead bodies and speak as reasonably and as fairly as Samuel did to the Phitonissa, FrT 1506-1511...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This interpretation, which connects different forms of necromancy with snakes, isn't too far-off from the Talmud's explanation of the Yid'oni, which involved calling forth spirits through a bone of a mysterious animal called a \"Yaddua\" (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.65b.6?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/121550/20472\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>My own guess is that this Greco-Roman term is the origin of the word \"Pitom\" which is used by our sages to describe such necromancers (see for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.7.7?vhe=Mishnah,_ed._Romm,_Vilna_1913&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Sanhedrin 7:7</a>). Compare especially the Latin \"<em>Pythonem</em>\", which has an \"M\" at the end. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_HeArukh%2C_Letter_Alef.8?vhe=Sefer_HeArukh,_Lublin_1883&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And it seems</a> that the Aruch may have also thought so, or something similar.</p>\n<p>It is known that the early Church Fathers (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isidore_of_Seville\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isidore</a> being the last of them) learned many Jewish traditions - not all of which survived in Jewish texts we have today - from local Jews, including Tannaim and Amoraim (see Jerome <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/119482/when-were-the-books-and-the-text-of-the-torah-settled/119491#119491\">here</a> for example). It would not be far-fetched to say that Isidore's tradition of the Ba'alat Ov from the time of Shaul being some sort of pitom-serpent sorceress came from Jewish tradition. As for the connection to Apollo, let's not forget that the Plishtim, who most likely originated in the Grecian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mycenaean</a> culture, neighbored Yisrael for many centuries. It is possible that Israelite sorcerers received magical knowledge from them, thus resulting in the connection.</p>\n\n\n",

So I know “how things work” in some ways, but still have questions from my own perspective.</p>\n\n<p>That said, one aspect of Passover has always confused me: I understand that Chametz (aka: leavened food/bread and such) is forbidden on Passover and must be removed from the home. And I understand that in many communities, Chametz is burned. And I further understand that Chametz may be sold to a non-Jew as well to unburden the original owner of the Chametz.</p>\n\n<p>But why then isn’t the Chametz routinely donated to a charity—such as a non-Jewish charity—to help feed others? Wouldn’t donating the food to those in need be seen as a Mitzvah since the food would help the poor and needy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>To summarize the comments (as well as my personal experience):</p>\n\n<p>It is required to burn (or otherwise destroy) a small amount of Chametz (see <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Biur_Chametz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for some technical stuff).  Chametz that is typically burned is a small, token amount of opened food.  For many (if not most) people that I see, it is ten small croûtons or bread pieces that are customarily scattered around the house (see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/870652/jewish/Why-scatter-10-pieces-of-bread.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) and \"hunted down\" during the Search for Chametz the night before Passover.  </p>\n\n<p>Prior to the burning of Chametz on the day before Passover, there are various Jewish and non-Jewish charities that collect Chametz.  The Jewish charities tend to make sure it is consumed before Passover (and/or sold for Passover), where as non-Jewish charities would not need to.  This is certainly a big Mitzvah, and I myself try to donate excess Chametz to these causes.</p>\n\n<p>Others try to feed some excess Chametz to the local animals or birds, which also technically fulfills the obligation of destroying it.</p>\n\n<p>Many expensive Chametz items (such as bottles of whiskey or any Chametz-containing alcohol) are typically sold to a non-Jew to avoid large losses, although I'm sure some people are okay with donating expensive foods to charity.</p>\n\n<p>(As an aside, prior to passover there is an early custom to give extra charity in advance of the upcoming holiday, although this obviously does not include Chametz.

I mean it as a legitimate question for Jewish people asked by a non-Jewish person.</p>\n\n<p>I was raised in a Christian household. And was always taught that Jesus was  the Messiah not just the Jewish people, but all people.</p>\n\n<p>Now most modern Jews do not accept the legitimacy of Jesus's claim to be Messiah, that being the case, the Deity of Judaism has never (to my knowledge) revealed any path to salvation for gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>So from a Jewish perspective who then should we gentiles worship?</p>\n\n<p>Judaism being  a mostly non proselytizing faith one would assume that the Jewish God does not encourage his followers to spread their faith to the gentile community.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The question is neither inappropriate nor ignorant, and thanks for asking it so respectfully.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism believes in one God. One of Judaism's most important statement of faith, called the Shema (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>This one God is the one Gentiles should worship.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Judaism does have commandments for non-Jews. They are called the <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Seven_Laws_of_Noah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seven laws of Bnei Noach</a> (the sons of Noach, i.e., all of humanity), one of which is</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do not worship false Gods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maimonides (the Rambam, one of the most important codifiers of Jewish law) writes clearly (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Kings_and_Wars.8.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Melachim 8:11</a>) that any Gentile who observes these seven laws has a portion in the World to Come (which, I believe, is you are calling a path to salvation)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Anyone who accepts upon himself and carefully observes the Seven\n  Commandments is of the Righteous of the Nations of the World and has a\n  portion in the World to Come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason Judaism does not proselytise (i.e., actively try and convert others) is that we believe that Judaism is for Jews, and the seven laws of Bnei Noach are for non-Jews. As such there is no need to try and convince non-Jews to follow Judaism when they can instead follow the path God carved out for them.</p>\n\n\n",

Admittedly, it was poorly written and the tone may have been overly lighthearted. That said, I believe the core of the answer had merit, so I’m presenting a revised version here in a clearer and more thoughtful tone. (ahem.)</p>\n<p>First, a couple of points:</p>\n<h2>my interpretation of the OP's question</h2>\n<p>There is a tradition that when we open the door for shfoch chamoschu, we are opening it for Eliyahu hanuvy. The OP needs to bring a source for this, but the question is based on this assertion (fwiw, my family custom is to \"apologise\" to Eliyahu as we close the door, for \"closing it in his face\", so to speak).</p>\n<p>This tradition seems to understand that Eliyahu is \"present\" at the doorway in some corporeal sense, and the OP is asking \"is he really coming\" - meaning, <em>is this to be taken literally in any way</em>. If yes, this would mean that Eliyahu \"apparates\" at hundreds of thousands of houses in one night, similar to the mythical Santa Claus.</p>\n<p>(The truth is that even if this tradition is a myth, the question is still relevant to similar occasions when we claim Eliyahu is \"present\" - such as a brit milah, for example, where we designate <em>an actual seat</em> for him.)</p>\n<h2>Techum</h2>\n<p>The halachic concept of Techum is a prohibition for Jews to travel more than 2000 cubits beyond their original place of dwelling (definition beyond the scope of this question) on Shabbat or Yamim Tovim.</p>\n<p>Now, there is a gemara in Masechet Eruvin 43a, which I will paraphrase - see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.43a.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for the full text.</p>\n<p>The gemara asks the following question:</p>\n<p><em>Does the prohibition to breach the Techum perimeter apply above 10 tefachim (handbreadths) from the ground?</em></p>\n<p>So, for example, if I were to stand at the edge of my personal Techum perimeter, strap my (shabbat-permitted) jetpack onto my back, and lift vertically into the air, would it be forbidden for me to travel forwards and breach the airspace outside my Techum? or is the prohibition only within 10 tefachim of the ground.</p>\n<p>One of the proofs the gemara attempts to resolve this question is from a story. The gemara recounts an occasion when a teaching was given by one individual in two locations on the same Shabbat, despite the distance between them being far greater than the 2000-amot limit. The only seeming justification for this, assumes the gemara, is that the teaching was delivered by Eliyahu Hanuvy himself - <em>which proves that travel above 10 tefachim is permitted</em>.</p>\n<p>My understanding of that gemara is that at least to some extent, Eliyahu is understood to travel <em>in a physical sense</em>. (Remember, the gemara attempts to use this story as a <em>halachic determination</em> - this isn't mere agadata.)</p>\n<p>In addition, the method of travel must involve rising up into the air (hence the reindeer reference!), even if he \"transits\" through heaven.</p>\n<p>(@YDJ, in a comment to my original answer, claimed that the gemara should be interpreted that Eliyahu is an angel. But I find that difficult to accept, for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angels are incorporeal, therefore the concept of above/below 10 tefachim is illogical;</li>\n<li>The apparition of an angel across two physical locations more than 2000 amot apart does not represent a challenge to the concept of Techumin, because angels don't travel in the sense that people do)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are welcome to dispute my interpretation of the gemara, but please provide your own explanation if you do.</p>\n<p>Ho ho ho.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>My grandfather related from his father this explanation (a somewhat similar explanation is given in Taamei Minhagim) In past times Jews frequently suffered from blood libels in which it was alleged that they used the blood of a Christian boy for the wine at the Passoer Seder. When the gentile police (or mob) would show up at the door demanding to taste the wine, the children would be understandably scared. The parents would comfort the children by telling them <em>\"Don't worry zeiskeit, its Eliyahu Hanavi\".</em></p>\n\n\n",

In what sense is it true that we have a sort of independent ability to do things? How does that interplay with God's ''help''?</p>\n\n<p>(It seems to me that b'ezras Hashem is used as a replacement for 'hopefully' or the like when 'frum' people talk, but that is a side point.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are two similar expressions: אם ירצה ה (אי\"ה - if G-d so Desires / Wills) and בעזרת ה (בע\"ה - with G-d's Help). It seems from your question that you have no problem with the former, אי\"ה, as it leaves the future in G-d's \"Hands\" with no other factors under discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Saying \"בע\"ה\", however, brings up issues of bechirah chofshis (free will) and hashgachah peratis (personalized Divine Providence). See the question \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/70234/1570\">Free choice versus the Will of G-d</a>\". (My own answer is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/70309/1570\">here</a>.) I think it is there that you will find answers to the fundamental dilemma underlying your question.</p>\n\n<p>But the bottom line is \"אין סומכין על הנס -- we do not rely on miracles\", and even the resolutions of free will vs providence that give providence the most expansive role acknowledge that there is a role for human effort. That success and failure are in G-d's \"Hands\", but it is still fair to also acknowledge that we're talking about success or failure of our efforts.</p>\n\n<p>בע\"ה is thus a good counterfoil for taking too much credit for those successes. While leaving אי\"ה a great attitude to take when the situation leaves us little to do, we don't run such risks. We can still  avoiding losing hope by placing our trust in Him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The idea behind this custom is that even when we go about our mundane daily tasks, G‑d should always be on our minds, our tongues and our pens. This is in line with the verse in Psalms “I have placed the L‑rd before me constantly; because [He is] at my right hand, I will not falter,”(Psalms 16:8) and the verse in Proverbs “Know Him in all your ways, and He will direct your paths.”(Proverbs 3:6) The habit of peppering our ordinary conversation with thankful mentions of G‑d was even displayed by our forefather Jacob. According to the Midrash, when he masqueraded as his unruly brother as a ruse to have his father, Isaac, bless him, Jacob almost blew his cover by repeatedly mentioning G‑d in his conversation with his blind father.(Chabad.org)</p>\n\n\n",

See Mishnah Berurah (318:91).\nThe question, however, is whether or not there is a concern of bishul for the actual touching of the hot scoop with the ice cream: Is this a problem of “cooking” the ice cream.\nI believe that this will not be a problem, because there is no interest in any “cooking,” and the actual “cooking” that takes place is entirely negligible.\nThis is somewhat similar to the question of pouring hot water into a cup that is not entirely dry, for which Rav Shlomo Zalman zt”l was lenient, because the cooking is negligible, and one has no interest in it.\nAn added factor is that ice cream is general pasteurized, so that there are no major ingredients that have not already been cooked, and therefore the issue will only be bishul achar bishul. This is especially the case for ice cream, which is solid, though the issue of something that becomes liquid as it cooks might apply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I can think of 2 problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Heating the knife: if it could become red-hot then it would be considered a Tolda of cooking.</p></li>\n<li><p>Melting food: causing food to melt could also be a Tolda of cooking.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Both of these are codified in the Rambam Hilchos Shabbat Ch. 9 (though I cannot find their parallel in the Shulchan Aruch.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ו:</strong> הַמַּתִּיךְ אֶחָד מִמִּינֵי מַתָּכוֹת כָּל שֶׁהוּא אוֹ הַמְחַמֵּם אֶת הַמַּתָּכוֹת עַד שֶׁתֵּעָשֶׂה גַּחֶלֶת הֲרֵי זֶה תּוֹלֶדֶת מְבַשֵּׁל.‏<br/> וְכֵן הַמְמַסֵּס אֶת הַדּוֹנַג אוֹ אֶת הַחֵלֶב אוֹ אֶת הַזֶּפֶת וְהַכֹּפֶר וְהַגָּפְרִית וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶם הֲרֵי זֶה תּוֹלֶדֶת מְבַשֵּׁל וְחַיָּב.‏<br/> וְכֵן הַמְבַשֵּׁל כְּלֵי אֲדָמָה עַד שֶׁיֵּעָשׂוּ חֶרֶס חַיָּב מִשּׁוּם מְבַשֵּׁל.‏<br/> כְּלָלוֹ שֶׁל דָּבָר בֵּין שֶׁרִפָּה גּוּף קָשֶׁה בָּאֵשׁ אוֹ שֶׁהִקְשָׁה גּוּף רַךְ הֲרֵי זֶה חַיָּב מִשּׁוּם מְבַשֵּׁל:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The publisher could mark both dates as overlapping partially, but since the second modern common calendar date overlaps with most of the holiday, they often just mark that. It's imprecise, but usually sufficient for most people's needs.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As others have noted, this has been a very longstanding Jewish rule - holidays start/end at sundown. But it actually gets a little more complicated. A brief overview:</p>\n\n<p>1 - This applies to ALL days, not just special holidays. In particular, that means the days of the week, including Shabbos (Sabbath) start/end at sundown. That means the Friday night special Shabbos dinner (which traditional Jews eat every Friday night, except if Yom Kippur starts on Friday night) is eaten after sundown Friday night and Shabbos continues until sundown on Saturday night.</p>\n\n<p>2 - The time for sundown is \"fuzzy\". Officially this is called Bein Hashmashos. The ends are \"shekia\" = \"sunset\", which generally has a pretty clear astronomical definition (sun below horizon) and \"tzeis hacochavim\" = \"stars come out\". Depending on location (ignoring the really wild situation in extreme northern/southern latitudes) and time of year and different traditions/interpretations of the Jewish laws involved, this time is typically between 42 and 72 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>3 - The sundown time is normally treated as an extension in whatever way is strictest. For Shabbos and holidays where work is prohibited, that effectively means a 25-hour \"day\" instead of just 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>4 - For normal Shabbos and holidays, one is allowed to start the evening services and the festive meal early (Plag Hamincha). But specifically for Passover the Seder meal is to take place \"at night\" which is normally understood to mean \"after tzeis hacochavim\". The result is that Melachah (work) is prohibited from \"shkia\" but you can't start the Seder until \"tzeis\". That really isn't a problem as there are prayers and last-minute preparations that can be done \"bein hashmashos\".</p>\n\n\n",

Matzah on Pesach (Passover)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Matzah on Pesach can be made from white (refined) or whole grain wheat (or any of the other allowed grains).</p>\n\n<p>Did our ancestors typically bake with refined or whole grain wheat?</p>\n\n<p>Were the first matzah white (refined) or whole grain wheat?</p>\n\n<p>Why do we see more white (refined) matzah nowadays?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The flour used to bake matzot has changed through the years. However, grains have soaked to enable separation of the bran and germ (present in whole wheat) from the starchy endosperm (what makes the \"white\" in white flour) for almost all recorded history (will get you a citation later).</p>\n\n<p>The Egyptians generally had pretty bad flour, using soft stones to do their milling. They often wound up with lots of rock dust mixed in with their flour. See \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Food_and_Cooking\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On Food and Cooking</a>\" for more details. So, presumably the first matzot were made with flour like this, likely from Khorasan-ancestor wheat.</p>\n\n<p>Zohar Amar claims that matzah used to be baked with a coarse-ground flour, much like semolina, but I don't think his claims are convincing. See his book חמשת מיני דגן.</p>\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.40a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">disagreement among the Amora'im regarding this question</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבה בעל נפש לא ילתות מאי איריא בעל נפש אפילו כולי עלמא נמי דהא תניא אין לותתין שעורין בפסח הכי קאמר בעל נפש אפי' חיטין דשרירי לא ילתות א\"ל ר\"נ מאן דציית ליה לאבא אכיל נהמא דעיפושא דהא בי רב הונא לתתי ובי רבא בר אבין לתתי ורבא אמר אסור ללתות ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rava initially felt this was not a good idea (he eventually changed his mind), and Rav Nachman basically said whoever holds like Rava is eating terrible bread (the \"white vs whole wheat\" debate is fairly old!). Since Rava changed his mind and said that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.40a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it's obligatory to soak the grains</a> (and thus have white flour) -- \"הדר אמר רבא מצוה ללתות\"  -- it seems that in the times of the Talmud, most people baked matzah preferentially with white flour.</p>\n\n<p>However, from the times of the Ge'onim and on we no longer soak grains. See, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Leavened_and_Unleavened_Bread.5.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (easier to find the source online, but it's explicit in the Geonim):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּכְבָר נָהֲגוּ כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּשִׁנְעָר וּבְאֶרֶץ הַצְּבִי\n  וּבִסְפָרַד וּבְעָרֵי הַמַּעֲרָב שֶׁלֹּא יִבְלְלוּ הַחִטִּים בְּמַיִם\n  גְּזֵרָה שֶׁמָּא יִשְׁהוּ וְיַחֲמִיצוּ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, in the middle ages most flour was likely coarsely-sifted whole wheat. Nowadays, most \"white\" matzah flour today is actually partially whole wheat (about 60% <a href=\"https://www.gristandtoll.com/flour-properties/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">extraction</a>), since it's stone ground whole wheat that's sifted.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is an infant firstborn child not simply exempt from the firstborns' fast?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Fast of the First Born was instituted for the day before the first Passover Seder.</p>\n\n<p>I have an older brother, so I'm not obligated to fast then. But my first child was a son, and he is obligated to fast. Of course when he was only a few years old he did not fast.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_of_the_Firstborn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an article at Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many authorities, including the Rema, note the custom that the father\n  of a firstborn should fast on his child's behalf until the child\n  reaches halakhic adulthood. The Rema rules that if the father is a\n  firstborn himself, the mother should fast on behalf of the child. The\n  Mateh Moshe and Maharil dispute this and rule in such a scenario that\n  the mother need not fast. The Magen Avraham rules that it is\n  appropriate to follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother\n  excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, but he adds\n  that a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain\n  that custom and fast in subsequent years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems pretty unusual.</p>\n\n<p>I realize that there are commandments (like circumcision or redemption) which the father normally does for his son, and which the son would otherwise have to do for himself eventually. But this fast doesn't seem like that. If nobody fasts on behalf of a child, those neglected fasts aren't hanging over the child's head, waiting for him to reach adulthood and perform the fasts of his first 12 years of life.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I suppose, if a father won't circumcise or redeem his son, someone else could do it instead. The fast is not just an obligation hanging over the community, like offering hospitality to guests. It's not that someone must fast, and if a firstborn child cannot fast then someone else should. It seems that particularly the father (or mother) should. I realize that during the plague of the firstborn, the Jewish parents must have been happy that their children lived. Younger siblings might have been happy too, and parents of firstborn adults, and lots of other people might have been happy. So I feel like there's something missing from that reliance on natural feelings.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that with respect to commandments in general, a child is simply exempt. Nobody has to perform any of the commandments for him, during his childhood or later, that he fails to perform as a child. Why don't we make that subjective analysis in the case of other commandments? Why is this one special?</p>\n\n\n",

To my knowledge, there's nothing wrong with water or water bottles (even when in the possession of a non-Jew) and that the person who told you that it was not permitted to bring the water bottle in was enforcing a no outside food or drink policy of the dining hall.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Without being able to ask the staff who sets the standards for your \"kosher cafeteria\", we can only speculate if it was truly not allowed to bring a water bottle in, or why.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is my best guess based on what you described and based on my experience with kosher supervisors in the past. </p>\n\n<p>If someone is allowed to bring in foreign food into the kosher cafe (even if it is kosher), then eventually the situation will become lax and people will start bringing just about anything to lunch. So in order to make sure no one brings anything unkosher, there is a total ban on bringing any food or drink from outside the kosher kitchen into the kosher mess hall.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, water is kosher.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Water is kosher period. Prior answers are correct and especially during Passover. It depends on your strictness and the strictness of the kosher eatery to retain its kosher certification. I also agree that the issue has nothing to do with racism, anti-Semitism, etc.; this is purely an instance of the establishment attempting to uphold its kosher certificate.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, it has נישט and ניש (=\"nish(t)\") instead of the expected Lithuanian ניט (=\"nit\"); it has דיא for \"you\", which suggests \"di\" instead of the expected Lithuanian \"du\"; it has פין (=\"fin\") and קימט (=\"kimt\") and װעסטי (=\"vesti\") instead of the expected \"fun\" and  \"kumt\" and \"vestu\", among others; it has both זײן and זאן for \"to be\", which suggests the pronunciation \"zan\" instead of the expected Lithuanian \"zayn\"; similarly, it has גלאך (=\"glakh\") and דאן (=\"dan\") instead of the expected \"glaykh\" and \"dayn\", among others; it has טאוט (=\"taut\"!) instead of the expected \"teyt\".

I have also heard this \"dispute\" from another rabbi recently.</p>\n<p>Are there any available articles or information that talk about this subject? Also, if you have any additional information, please post.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 22)\n\n<p>I think the Ba'al Shem Tov had to have existed in some way (even if it's not the way we've been taught), as I doubt an entire branch of Orthodox Judaism would base itself off the teachings of a ficticious figure. Let me ask you this - if the Besht didn't exist, who made him up? </p>\n\n<p>From a historical standpoint, saying he didn't exist is futile. We have books which belonged to him (such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_Tov#/media/File:Besht_Siddur.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his siddur</a>), the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_Tov#/media/File:Besht_Shul1_Medzhibozh.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">shul where he taught</a> (which was sadly destroyed by the Nazis, y.s. and has been replaced with a replica), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_Tov#/media/File:BaalShemMatzeivoh.JPG\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his grave</a>. Also he is recorded in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_Tov#/media/File:Besht_Tax_List_1758.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1758 Polish census</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I think with the above evidence, it's pretty clear he existed. I think the question is not \"did he actually exist\" but rather \"did he exist the same way he's presented in all the stories\".  And now here's where the following quote comes in handy:</p>\n\n<p>\"If you don't believe any of the stories of the Besht, you're a heretic, and if you believe all of the them, you're a fool.\" - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Rabinowicz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Rabinowicz</a>, the first Radomsker Rebbe</p>\n\n<p>The variation between each of the stories is where the problem arises. In some stories his entire backstory changes. I think we ought to look for which stories come from authentic sources, and throw out the rest.

It was written from the city of Tzfat in Israel on Sunday, Yom Rishon of parshat Chukat in the year 5502, which corresponds with 1742. The Ba'al Shem Tov had sent a special package to a Rabbi who was passing through Tzfat at that time, namely Rabbi Chaim Ibn Attar, the Ohr HaChaim. The Ba'al Shem Tov had requested of the Ohr HaChaim to meet him \"face to face\" via some kabbalistic practice mentioned in his letter. The Ohr HaChaim replied that he no longer did such things because he was only immersing in a mikvah once (per week). But he said they could meet face to face via the kabbalistic practice referred to from <em>Kiddush Levanah</em> when done on Shabbat Kodesh. It adds that the Ohr HaChaim sent gifts to the Ba'al Shem Tov, in return for his package, of two sets of Tefillin boxes made from olive wood from Israel and five gazelle skins all manufactured by G-d fearing people. The importance of this letter is that it corresponds to the exact time when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_ibn_Attar\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim was on his way to Yerushalayim from Livorno, Italy in the year 1742</a>.

(appears in Sefer Az Yashir Moshe, Page Kaf Hey, Parashat Noach)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>The Rambam in the laws of Teshuva as you cited indeed says that a tzadik is one who has a majority of merits, a wicked person is one who has a majority of not good deeds (which the Rambam says would cause one to pass away instantly G-d forbid) and an average person (beinoni) is one who has half righteous deeds and half wicked deeds.</p>\n<p>To clarify, \"majority\" does not mean 51% deeds in quantity alone, the Rambam says that there can be one good deed worth many bad deeds etc... So it's a combination of quantity and quality.</p>\n<p>But does this measurement apply even after one does Teshuva? The Gemara says that when one does Teshuva one's bad deeds are converted to good deeds, so is one still considered to \"have\" those bad deeds after doing Teshuva?</p>\n<p>Also, a source in the Gemara says that if one transgresses even one prohibition, even a seemingly \"minor\" rabbinic prohibition, is called \"wicked\", and one who does Teshuva is called \"completely righteous\", so how could we ever have a middle state of a \"beinoni\", an average person, who has half righteous deeds and half wicked deeds (seemingly, before even doing Teshuva)? If he didn't do Teshuva, then he would be completely wicked for even one minor misdeed, and definitely for not performing a mitzvahs aseih.</p>\n<p>Based on these questions, and other sources, the Tanya chapter 1 concludes that when the Rambam says that a righteous person is one who has a majority of good deeds (seemingly, even before doing Teshuva, according to my understanding, although correct me if I'm wrong), he's only \"righteous\" in a figurative, non literal sense, of still being able to live, meaning that he is meritorious in his divine judgement passed against him, which happens every moment.</p>\n<p>Then he says that there's actually a \"true\" understanding of a righteous person, which is a completely different category than that the Rambam mentions, which is one who has no yester hara at all (OR has it not it's completely inoperable).</p>\n<p>He quotes the Gemara and Rashi which references the verse from King David \"my heart is empty within me\", that through fasting, King David \"killed\" his yeitzer hara.</p>\n<p>Then he quoted a midrash as saying that Hashem saw that the righteous were few, so he scattered the souls of the righteous throughout many generations, only having a few alive at any given time.</p>\n<p>This does not have anything to do with the free choice one has in one's actions of thought, speech and deeds, which are in one's control, which determine if one is the \"figurative\"/\"borrowed term\" of a righteous person that the Rambam talks about, this is only referring to certain souls having the ability within them to completely banish/transform the yeitzer hara within oneself, while other people who weren't created with those few souls don't have that ability to transform their inner nature, and perhaps the entire purpose of their existence is to be in a constant inner battle etc. until moshiach comes.</p>\n<p>To summarize, according to Tanya:</p>\n<p>In the realm of the \"borrowed\" terms of righteous, average, and wicked (although the Tanya doesn't explicitly say that the term \"wicked\" is also a borrowed term I'm assuming it is based on the context):</p>\n<p>When the Rambam says that a righteous person has a majority of good deeds, implying he could still have even one minor bad deed, that's just a borrowed term.</p>\n<p>Similarly, an average person who has half bad deeds and half good, is still a borrowed term.</p>\n<p>A wicked person is one who has a majority of bad deeds (and again, majority in this context is not only quantity but mainly quality), and the Rambam says if one reaches this level G-d forbid, they would instantly pass away.</p>\n<p>According to the Rambam (and my understanding of the sources), all of these cases must be talking about before one has done (complete) Teshuva, because of one has done complete Teshuva, then one would not have even one minor bad deed remaining. (Again this is my own understanding not explicitly mentioned in Tanya but I think this is the only way to understand it).</p>\n<p>Now, in the more \"real\" terminology of wicked, anyone with only one minute prohibition in their \"list\" of deeds is considered wicked. Even a rabbinic prohibition, and for sure a nullification of a positive commandment of the Torah, even the commandment to consistently be involved in Torah study every second.</p>\n<p>Later in Tanya it classifies your even further and says even if one intentionally has bad thoughts once in every few years, one is classified as wicked (until one has done Teshuva, seemingly).</p>\n<p>If one has done Teshuva, then one has no bad deeds in their accounting at all, so they are not wicked. But if so, what are they (according to the \"real\" terminology)?</p>\n<p>Even if one has done complete Teshuva, they are either a tzadik or an average person.</p>\n<p>The difference between the two, according to Tanya, is not based on one's deeds at all, but only based on one's internal nature that only Hashem decided at the time of one's birth, like it says in Job, \"you have created righteous (souls)\".</p>\n<p>Either one was created with a soul that has the ability to transform/nullify the yeitzer hara completely, or one was not.</p>\n<p>If one was, and one accomplished that, then one is a \"true\" tzadik (and within that itself, there are many different levels, depending on if it is completely transformed or only \"dormant\" but has no actual effect).</p>\n<p>If one was not, AND if one has no bad deeds at all currently (either through doing Teshuva for past deeds or if one has never done any prohibition in their entire life), then one is \"average\", according to the \"true\" definition.</p>\n<p>This, the Tanya says, is why Rabbah in the Gemara made the mistake about himself to think he was an average person, despite the fact that his mouth never ceased from words of Torah, implying that he didn't even nullify any positive commandment, and for sure he didn't violate any negative rabbinic or Torah commandments.</p>\n<p>Because if Rabbah, when saying he was average, meant only the Rambam's definition of \"average\", meaning having exactly equal (quantitatively+qualitatively) merits and bad deeds, it wouldn't align at all with the reality of his actions.</p>\n\n\n",

That is why some people will hold the cup with a towel or carefully dry the hand that is about to be washed. Perhaps the chassidim that you speak of follow the psak of the <em>Chazon Ish</em> that Rabbi Kaganoff cites.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Washing wet hands</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Must one’s hands be completely dry before you begin washing netilas\n  yadayim? The authorities dispute what the halachah is in this case.</p>\n  \n  <p>As we learned above, someone who, when pouring water for the first\n  time, rinsed only part of his hand, must dry his hand thoroughly and\n  begin the procedure over. The authorities dispute whether one must\n  always have dry hands when beginning netilas yadayim or whether one\n  may perform netilas yadayim even though his hands are wet or the\n  handle of the cup is wet. According to the Magen Avraham (162:10) and\n  the Mishnah Berurah (162:27), one may begin washing netilas yadayim,\n  even though one’s hands are wet. The Chazon Ish (Orach Chayim 24:20)\n  disagrees, contending that one’s hands must be dry when one begins\n  washing netilas yadayim. Therefore, the handle of the cup must also be\n  dry or, alternatively, one may grip the handle of the cup with a towel\n  or some other item that keeps his hands dry until he washes netilas\n  yadayim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another possibility is that the water on the cup <strong>may</strong> be considered <em>used</em> water, which can cause problems. Note that if the first hand is held properly, the water from the first hand being washed will not flow onto the cup so there would be no problem of <em>tum'ah</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does the Siddur Torah Ohr differ from the Siddur Tehilas Hashem?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The most common Chabad siddur is obviously the Siddur Tehilas Hashem (TH), which was first published in Rostov, Russia in 1918. It is used by over 300,000 Chabad families worldwide. However, it's not the only Chabad siddur on the market - before the last Lubavitcher Rebbe encouraged its use, the Siddur TH wasn't as common. Instead, the Siddur Torah Ohr (TO) was more commonly used. (Indeed, the Lubavitcher Rebbe himself used such a siddur.) Lastly, there is another siddur printed with interpretations, instructions, and discourses from the Alter Rebbe of Chabad, Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi. </p>\n\n<p>I have been told that the Lubavitcher Rebbe encouraged the use of the Siddur TH based on the fact that it's \"much easier to navigate\" and \"that you don't have to keep flipping back and forth\".  I was wondering what the differences are between the Siddur TO and TH, practically.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, how much easier is it to navigate, really? What about the Siddur TO makes it to where you have to keeping flipping pages back and forth? </p>\n\n<p>Second, are there any differences in nusach between the Siddur TH and TO? They're both Chabad, but one of them is older, which might present certain nusach variants. (Possibly. Probably not.) </p>\n\n<p>Mai nafka minnah between these two siddurim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As is common with most older siddurim, in Torah Or, things aren't duplicated, just printed once, e.g., the weekday Amidah.

And for Ma'ariv, you would use the same Amidah.</p>\n\n<p>The 4-letter name of God is printed in Torah Or, rather than the yud-yud abbreviation used in Tehillat Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Torah Or is complete for the whole year, with amidah prayers for Rosh HashShannah and Yom Kippur, and with a Haggadah for Passover, which I don't think Tehillat Hashem has. Torah Or would be better on a desert island.</p>\n\n<p>There are fashions in prayer books, and Tehillat Hashem conforms to the more recent trends.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>the siddur TH you refer to (Rostov 1918) is not the same TH used by Chabad today, the TH used today was first published in 1945, it was a copy of an older siddur called Seder Hoavoda (סדר העבודה) printed in Vilna 1911.</p>\n<p>I'm not certain the Lubavitcher Rebbe specifically encouraged the use of TH, but it was printed by Merkoz Leinyonei Chinuc (מרכז לעניני חינוך) for children with larger letters and all the prayers in its place.</p>\n<p>as opposed to Siddur TO was printed in 1896 (in its entirety), to save on money, the publishers would only print each prayer once, it was also reprinted multiple times to fix the mistakes that fell during the printing.</p>\n<p>as of today, most Lubavitchers will use TH, but there are plenty of Lubavitchers who will daven from TO, either because that's the siddur the Rebbe davened from, or because they feel this is the authentic Chabad siddur and TH was only published for children, while some would only use it because of the nostalgic vibe that comes with it.</p>\n<p>either way, the proper place for a siddur, especially with such a historic relevance, is not on a desert island, most Lubavitchers, even that don't use TO will still have one in their home!</p>\n\n\n",

The Mabit, in Beis Elohim\n  Shaar Teshuvah chapters 13-14 writes that although non-Jews are able\n  to do teshuva, their repentance is fundamentally different than that\n  of Jews in several important ways. However, all of the differences\n  that he lists are metaphysical differences (such as not being forgiven\n  right away, or not being able to exempt themselves from punishment in\n  the afterlife). Regarding the actual procedure of repentance, however,\n  it appears that Jews and non-Jews are equal in this regard. This is\n  also borne out of the fact that the Gemara (and many later poskim)\n  learn laws regarding the teshuvah of Jews from the story of Ninveh as\n  it's portrayed in the book of Jonah (see Taanis 15a, for example).</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, just as a Jew has to be forgiven by his fellow who was the\n  subject of his wrongdoing, a gentile must also be granted forgiveness\n  from the person whom he has wronged before being forgiven by God. The\n  \"release clause\" that is included in the pre-Yom Kippur prayer may not\n  suffice for anyone, Jew or non-Jew. This issue is discussed at length\n  <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=881&st=&pgnum=156\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in this teshuva from R. Binyamin Zilber</a>. However, given that it does\n  work for Jews, it's possible that the original intent of the prayer is\n  to only refer to Jews. Having said that, if you as the person reciting\n  the prayer have in mind to forgive the non-Jews as well (and, better\n  yet, if you say that explicitly), then whatever power it has for Jews\n  is probably just as effective for non-Jews too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Suppose someone today wanted to learn the unique \"Slabodka approach\" as embodied and taught by the Alter. Are there any remaining students of the Alter alive today (they would presumably have to be over 100 years old) that one could learn from? If not, are there any second generation students that are known** to represent the Slabodka approach?</p>\n\n<p>(Note, Wikipedia has a partial list of famous students of the Alter who went on to become influential in many of the modern day yeshivos. I am not simply asking for a list of students. My question is specifically if there is someone alive today who is known** to accurately represent the Alter's approach and can give it over to a student.) </p>\n\n<p>** This is obviously somewhat subjective.

Unlike other yeshivos, that is their central identity, a true \"mussar yeshiva\" in the way of slabodka, as opposed to a regular yeshiva with some mussar built in. If you are a brilliant rebbe but not committed to the Slabodka way, you will not be hired.</p>\n<p>Another option is the Chevron Yeshiva in Israel. In his later years, the Alter actually left the city of Slabodka and reeatablished the yeshiva in Chevron.

He himself is a student of Rav Shlomo Wolbe, who is a student of Rav Yeruchem, who is a student of the Alter. But as is evident from his diverse range of students (Rav Aaron Kotler, Rav Yitzchak Hutner, Rav Yaakov Kamentsky, Rav Ruderman etc) it is clear that the Alter catered his method to each student, so presumably any loyal student of the Alter would be doing the same thing. Therefore, \"The Alters Method\" isn't so formulaic in any event.</p>\n\n<p>Note however that Rav Leuchter's shiurim are fairly challenging, so it may take some time to appreciate them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ner Yisroel (or Ner Israel Rabbinical College) explicitly patterns itself after Slabodka.

This amount is a Halacha l’Moshe miSinai, for a Revi’is of blood is enough to give off tum’ah in a tent, because a Revi’is is considered a ‘nefesh’ that we may apply to it ‘to any dead nefeshos he may not approach.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But do not fear; this Gemara in Sotah is so surprising that Tosfos had to take notice. And they do provide an answer (rough translation on my part):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אדם שאין בו אלא רביעית דם - פר\"ח הוא דם הצלול שממנו משתית הלב אין בו אלא משקל כ\"ה סלעים שהיא רביעית הלוג:</p>\n  \n  <p>A person, who only has a Revi’is of blood - Rabbeinu Chananel explains that this is the <em>clear blood</em> which is contained in the heart. It weights only 25 Sela, which is a Revi’is. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Gemara isn’t saying that a person can survive on just a Revi’is of blood, but rather than a person’s heart is constantly pumping a Revi’is of <em>clear blood</em> at a time. </p>\n\n<p>Clear blood may refer to the plasma, ie the liquid where red globules are swimming. It represents about 50% of blood.</p>\n\n<p>How does this measure up? According to <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Reference_of_Measurements_in_Halacha#Revi.27it\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia</a>, a Revi’is is between 3 and 5.3 ounces. <a href=\"https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/VitaliyShchupak.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This site</a> estimates a heart to be around 280 mL, or 9.77 US oz. So when take half of this for the plasma part, we get close to a Revi'is.  Perhaps the difference can be chalked up to estimating on both ends. Perhaps it’s that Tosfos wasn’t referring to the entire heart, but just one or two quadrants of it. Perhaps hearts were physically a different size back then (not likely, at least not to a significant enough degree). Perhaps Tosfos were referring to a younger age than adult - at the opposite extreme, the above link claims that an infant has 8.5 ounces <em>in its entire body</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Assuming your affirmation that \"<60% : lethal\" (--> sources?)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In math this is called a <strong>necessary but not sufficient</strong> condition.</p>\n\n<p>Our Sages knew that, the smallest vital amount of blood is a <em>revi'it</em>.

    "content": "# Sects within Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have seen several different categorical terms to describe Jewish people, but I'm unclear of the distinctions.</p>\n\n<p>Most notably, are there differences in theory and practice between <strong>Chasidic</strong> and <strong>Lubavitch</strong> Jews?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not concerned with Conservative or Reform Judaism. But there are other terms I'm interested in: <strong>halachic</strong> Jew, <strong>Orthodox</strong> Jew not otherwise specified, and <strong>Chabad</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone explain the differences?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Orthodox Jews are religious Jews who follow halacha, traditional Jewish law and practice. Hasidic Jews therefore fall under this category as well, as halacha-abiding Jews. I must say, I wasn't familiar with the term \"halachic Jew\" until you used it, but I'd assume it means exactly the same thing as Orthodox Jew. </p>\n\n<p>(Before the Jewish Reformation in the 1800s, the term \"Orthodox Jew\" did not exist - you were either an assimilated or converted Jew or a Jew who adheres to halacha.) </p>\n\n<p>In the 1700s, Rabbi Israel b. Eliezer (d. 1760), known as the \"Baal Shem Tov\" (Heb. \"Master of the Good Name\"), began teaching from his homestead in Medzhybizh, Ukraine. The followers of the Baal Shem Tov became known as \"Hasidim\", which means \"pious ones\" in Hebrew. Hasidic philosophy is not something I can summarize here; it's such a large topic upon which volumes are written. Basically, Hasidim live like normal Orthodox Jews, except that they are extremely particular in their observance of Jewish law, and have incorporated mystical teachings into their daily practice. Rabbi Isaac Luria (d. 1572 in Safed, Israel), known as the Arizal, was a mystic. The Hasidim took his teachings and tried their best to reconcile them with the already familiar practices of Ashkenazic Jewry. Therefore, Hasidic prayer books began to emerge, which were different from the traditional Ashkenazic liturgy, as they brought in kabbalistic additions from the teachings of the Arizal. </p>\n\n<p>When the Baal Shem Tov passed away, his prime disciple, Rabbi Dov-Ber b. Abraham (d. 1772), known as the Mezritcher Maggid (Yid. \"Preacher from Velyki Mezhyrichi\") sent his disciples to various places in Europe to spread Hasidism. Different \"dynasties\" of Hasidim arose from the towns the disciples were sent to. This is the origin of many of today's Hasidic dynasties. </p>\n\n<p>Chabad was started in Lithuania by Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi. A long time ago, there were many dynasties within Chabad, but after the Holocaust only one remained - Chabad-Lubavitch, the branch of Chabad Hasidim from the city of Lubavitch (Yid. \"Lyubavichi\"). This is the Chabad which exists today. </p>\n\n<p>Other Hasidic dynasties, such as Gur, Satmar, Belz, Vizhnitz, etc. are named after the cities in which their teachers came from. Gur = Góra Kalwaria, Satmar = Satu Mare, Belz = Belz, Vizhnitz = Vyzhnytsia, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Chabad specializes in outreach to unaffiliated Jews and religious Jews in remote areas. This behavior was encouraged by the last Lubavitcher Rebbe (a Rebbe is the leader of a Hasidic dynasty), Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (d. 1994).  One obvious reason why Chabad is different from other Hasidic dynasties is its lack of distinct Hasidic garb shared by other dynasties, however, the philosophy of Chabad differs from that of other dynasties. But this is true throughout all dynasties (ie, Gur is different from Satmar). Entire books have been written about Chabad and its philosophy. I'd suggest if you want to learn more, you do some further reading. I've only provided the basics here. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask in the comments. </p>\n\n<p>I didn't know what you knew and didn't know, so I summarized everything here.

While the title isn’t quite accurate, I couldn’t think of a better way to phrase it - feel free to edit if you can. </p>\n\n<p>In sci-fi literature, (backwards) time travel tends to take one of two forms: either (1) one’s actions were already taken into account in the timeline, leading to the trope of someone trying to prevent something from happening but causes it to happen in the end (think <em>Doctor Who</em>); or (2) one can actually alter the past, leading to a branching timeline (think <em>Back to the Future</em>). </p>\n\n<p>Does Judaism address whether either of these are accurate? That is, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8496/\">assuming time travel is possible</a>, can one go back in time and alter the past?</p>\n\n<p>The flip side of the coin, which might open some other possibilities for answers: if I somehow receive a message from the future, can I take measures to prevent it from happening, or will it automatically happen regardless of what I do?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The main question ends here. The following are some of my thoughts on potential proofs one way or another from methods we know to be true of predicting the future. </p>\n\n<p>While astrology, kishuf, necromancy, and urim v’tumim all do this to some effect or another, there is a fundamental issue with all of them that prevents them from being proofs - namely, a large portion of the message is left up to interpretation, and thus any inaccuracies might be chalked up to user error. Take the example of Paroh’s message of Ra’ah (Shemos 10:10) - while one could argue that the symbol was overturned, one could just as easily argue that it was never intended to refer to murder, and Paroh misread the stars. </p>\n\n<p>Nevuah, also, isn’t a good proof: a negative prophecy can be overturned, but perhaps it was just to scare the people and never was intended to be fulfilled at all. A positive prophecy might never be overturned, but that could be just because Hashem doesn’t lie - not that it fundamentally <em>can’t</em> be overturned, but that He <em>chooses</em> not to overturn it. </p>\n\n<p>While different, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/856/9682\">yedi’ah versus bechirah</a> is very heavily related. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Without getting into comparing sci-fi literature to lehavdil Judaism.

It decided when one must recite a prayer (Krias Shema), it directs man to abstain from labor (Shabbos), and it demands when one must preform other ritual duties (Korban Pesach, Korban Bein Ha’arbayim, etc.)</p>\n<p>Yet we also find that man (more specifically the Rabbis), in a sense, have a mastery over time. For example, the Mitzvah to Sanctify the New Moon, known as Kiddush Hachodesh. Two witnesses are brought in, and through their testimony of the seeing the new moon, the Beis Din declares the new month, which then sets off a myriad of obligations.</p>\n<p>There is a fascinating Midrash in the Yakut Shimoni that attests to this idea, that Man plays a powerful part, almost on par with G-d himself, in the control of time:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מתכנסים מלאכי השרת אצל הקב\"ה ואומרים לפניו: \"רבונו של עולם, אימתי ראש\nהשנה?\" והוא אומר: \"ולי אתם שואלים? אני ואתם נשאל לבית דין של מטה!\"</p>\n<p>גזרו בית דין של מטה ואמרו \"היום ראש השנה\", אומר הקב\"ה למלאכים: \"העמידו\nבימה, והעמידו סנגורים והעמידו ספיקטורים [מקטרגים], מפני שגזרו בית דין\nשל מטה ואמרו היום ראש השנה!\". נשתהו העדים לבוא, או נמלכו בית דין לעברה\nלמחר [החליטו לדחות את קידוש החודש למחר] - הקב\"ה אומר למלאכי השרת:\n\"העבירו בימה, ויעבירו סנגורים ויעבירו ספיקטורים, שגזרו בית דין של מטה\nואמרו, ראש השנה למחר\". (ילקוט שמעוני בא קצ, קצא</p>\n<p>The angels gathered together with the Holy One, blessed be He, and\nsaid to Him: \"Master of the world, when is the New Year?\" G-d\nresponded : \" Why do you ask me?

For how can time, being that Rosh Hashana is the literal date and beginning of the world (yes, this aspect is subject to a tannaic dispute, but the point nonetheless stands), be subject to the decisions of the Beis Din. There are further examples of this that we find throughout halacha (the status of a girl physical maturity etc. the bringing of the Korban Ha’omer).</p>\n<p>These are but a few examples, but i hope to add more.</p>\n<p>Regarding time travel in general, we find the Gemara in Taanis (23a)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I am sorry to write my comments as an answer, but it might help to think of some additional ideas.</p>\n\n<p>When watching a movie on a PC I asked myself: \"How come, the whole movie is stored on my disc as a file, but I can only watch it sequentially?\"</p>\n\n<p>Same with the creation, it is one \"4D\" piece that unfolds before our eyes sequentially.

I found a discussion of the issue by Rabbi S.B. Genut (in the case of someone locked in a bathroom) <a href=\"http://www.shabes.net/bsd/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3630:sfirat-haomer&catid=57:categoryhagimpapers&Itemid=81\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, which I'll summarise for those for whom Hebrew is a barrier.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, we'll assume that a modern bathroom is considered a place of uncleanliness (which is a discussion in itself, since our bathrooms are pretty clean compared to those in olden times).The <em>Mishna B'rura</em> (<em>Biur Halacha</em> OC 588 <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A4%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.v. שמע ט' תקיעות</a>) quotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephraim_Zalman_Margolioth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mateh Efraim</a> (a classic work on the laws of the Days of Awe) that if someone became incontinent while blowing the <em>shofar</em>, he should stop. The MB asks why - after all, why should this automatically be like <em>shema</em> or <em>tefillin</em> where we explicitly are commanded to read/wear it in a clean place? It's not forbidden to do other mitzvot in an unclean place - we don't take off <em>tzitzit</em> when entering a bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>He suggests that it might be because of מצוות צריכות כוונה, mitzvot requiring thought (as @DonielF floated in the comments). However, many hold that Rabbinical mitzvot don't require <em>kavana</em>, and that counting the Omer in our times is rabbinical. (Which is why if you accidentally say what day it is in answer to someone's question, you don't count with a <em>bracha</em>.) So he suggests that one may count without <em>kavana</em> (and obviously without a blessing).</p>\n\n<p>However, he notes that the שו\"ת מעט מים (which I think was by R' Avraham of Salonica, who was among those expelled from Spain in 1492) discusses the issue and forbids it because one cannot possibly do a mitzva without thinking about it, and that is no different from thoughts of Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason the MB quotes is that this might just be disrespectful of the mitzva. (Similarly, it is brought that it is forbidden to use urine to wash/sterilise a <em>shofar</em> [which apparently was something people did back then!] because it is disrespectful.) However, R' Genut says that if this will cause you to miss out on counting for the rest of the <em>sefira</em>, there is room to be lenient, just like with an <em>onen</em> (as @Danny Schoemann mentioned, though he sources it to the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Landau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noda B'Yehuda</a></em> <em>Mahdura Kama</em> OC 27).</p>\n\n<p>He also quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Palachi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Chaim Palachi</a> (in <em>Lev Chaim</em> 2:123, <em>Moed L'Kol Chai</em> 5:6), asked about one who is imprisoned in an unclean place. He says that one may count without a <em>bracha</em>, just like one may give charity or slaughter an animal in an unclean place.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, he notes that he asked someone to ask <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Kanievsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Chaim Kaniyevski</a> <em>shlita</em>, who said that one may not. But there are claims that on another occasion he ruled that one may.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Hayyim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Chaim of Baghdad</a> has a responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15114&st=&pgnum=108\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Lishmah # 132</a>) about performing <em>mitzvot</em> in the presence of excrement or nakedness. He brings several proofs that it is permissible:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You are allowed to enter a bathroom while wearing a <em>talit katan</em> even though you are thus performing a <em>mitzvah</em>.</li>\n<li>The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x3013\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C.640:4</a>) rules that if there is a foul odor in the <em>succah</em> you can sleep outside the succah. And the Shulchan Aruch (Rema <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x3013\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 639:7</a>) rules that when you are exempt from the succah, if you stay in the succah you are called a fool. The implication of this is that the only issue is that you were stringent when you need not have been, but not that there is any problem with actually performing a <em>mitzvah</em> in the presence of the foul odor.</li>\n<li>The Mishnah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37939&st=&pgnum=250\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Demai 1:4</a>) states that one can tithe <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">demai</a></em> while naked. As explained by the Jerusalem Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15203&st=&pgnum=125\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Demai 1:4</a>), this is because no blessing is required. And this is codified by Rambam (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=7&hilchos=37&perek=9&halocha=4&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Ma'aser 9:4</a>). Thus, we see that it is only a problem to make a blessing naked, but not to perform a <em>mitzvah</em> naked.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He also quotes a proof that he heard from a scholar: The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=32b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 32b</a>) states that with regard to the commandment to rise for the elderly you might have thought that you even have to rise in a bathroom; therefore, the Torah used the term \"you shall honor\" to teach us that only a rising that confers honor is commanded, which excludes rising in a bathroom. Now if it was generally forbidden to perform a <em>mitzvah</em> in a bathroom, why would we need a special source by the <em>mitzvah</em> of rising for the elderly? Perforce, then, one <em>may</em> perform <em>mitzvot</em> in the bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>R. Yosef Chaim, however, rejected this proof. He argued that it is possible that in general one may not perform a <em>mitzvah</em> in the bathroom, but perhaps there is an exception for a <em>mitzvah</em> that will pass by. Thus, without the special source by the case of rising for the elderly, you might have thought that you have to rise even in a bathroom since it is a <em>mitzvah</em> that will pass by.</p>\n\n<p>The rejection of this proof is perhaps even stronger support for the case of <em>sefirah</em> in the bathroom, because since it is a <em>mitzvah</em> that will pass by you could do it in the bathroom even if in general it was forbidden to perform <em>mitzvot</em> in the bathroom.'</p>\n\n<p>(Of course, all this assumes that our bathrooms are problematic in general like the bathrooms of old. However, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99704/13438\">some are of the opinion</a> that our bathrooms do not have the status of \"bathrooms\", in which case there would be even more reason to permit <em>sefirah</em> if you are stuck there.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would be inclined to permit it - despite <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/91150/501\">Danny's (unsourced) answer</a> forbidding it.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0195_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן קצו - הלכות אונן</a> the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch states that an Onen (a mourner before the burial takes place) should wait until after the burial to count the Omer, since an Onen is not allowed to do any Mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>However, continues the Kitzur, if waiting until after the burial would cause him to miss a day, then the Onen counts.</p>\n\n<p>So we see that counting in order not to miss a day is permissible even when one may not do Mitzvoth.</p>\n\n<p>I am tempted to say that your scenario is similar, though I can't prove it, yet.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף י\"ח:</strong> \n  אוֹנֵן בְּלֵיל סְפִירַת הָעֹמֶר, לֹא יִסְפֹּר בַּלַיְלָה, אֶלָּא בַּיוֹם לְאַחַר הַקְּבוּרָה יִסְפֹּר בְּלֹא בְרָכָה. וּבִשְׁאָר הַלֵּילוֹת, יִסְפֹּר אַחַר כָּךְ בִּבְרָכָה. <strong>וְאִם רוֹאֶה בַּיוֹם כִּי הָאֲנִינוּת תִּמָּשֵׁךְ עַד הַלַּיְלָה, יִסְפֹּר אֲפִלּוּ בַאֲנִינוּת בְּלֹא בְרָכָה, כְּדֵי שֶׁיִסְפֹּר שְׁאָר הַלֵּילוֹת בִּבְרָכָה‏</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It says that  one should not stuff himself so much during the meal that he has no room to enjoy the <em>afikoman</em> and feels forced to eat it. I got that idea. However, if the afikoman is to represent <em>Korban Pesach</em>, I would think that one should specifically satiate himself (i.e., intentionally eat a lot so that he is full) because the korban Pesach was supposed to be eaten <em>al hasova</em> - after being satiated. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Rishonim dispute whether Hillel would wrap the Korban Pesach together with the Matza and Maror(Rashi Pesachim 115a s.v. Shehaya and Rashbam ad. loc. s.v. Korchan) or eat the Korban Pesach separate from the Matza and Maror (Rambam Hilchot Chametz Umatza 8:6-7, Rabeinu Chananel ibid). This dispute accounts for the variations in the text of Zecher Lemikdash Kehillel that we recite before eating the Korech (see Baer Heitev475:9 and Mishna Berurah 475:21). Some versions state, \"He would wrap Matza and Maror and eat them together,\" in accordance with the Rambam's view. Other versions state, \"He would wrap Pesach, Matza, and Maror and eat them together\", following the view of Rashi and the Rashbam.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam and Rabeinu Chananel, Hillel and Chachomim:<br>\n Both hold that the Kezayis of Pesach offering was eaten right at the end (al hasova) without Matza and Maror so the <strong>Afikomen is merely a representation of the Pesach offering</strong> and therefore should be treated like the Pesach offering to be eaten when full but have a room left. Hillel just reasons that the Matza and Maror have to be together beforehand whereas Chachamim say one can eat them separately a swell.</p>\n\n<p>The opinion of Hillel (Chachamim don't argue they just say eat separately if you want)According to Rashi and the Rashbam:<br>\nThe main Matza and Maror were eaten right at the end together with the kezayit piece of Pesach lamb/kid in the time of the Beis Hamikdosh, and no Matza or Maror was eaten beforehand. So nowadays the pesach is not availlable and the marror is no longer a Mitzva Deoraisa, <strong>so the Afikomen at the end is a representation of the actual Matzas Mitzva which accompanied the Pesach offering.</strong> This is why Rashi and the Rashbam say Pesachim 119b:<br>\n  אין מפטירין אחר מצה אפיקומן - שצריך לאכול מצה בגמר הסעודה זכר למצה הנאכלת עם הפסח וזו היא מצה הבצועה שאנו אוכלין באחרונה לשם חובת מצה אותה שלאחר אכילה - The Afikomen should be eaten as the main Mitzva of Matza on Seder night as a rememberance to the Matza that was eaten together with the Pesach Offering at the end of the meal al hasova (i.e not being stuffed but almost full).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://olamot.net/shiur/%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> is a wonderful Shiur at Olamot that addresses all that you asked.</p>\n\n<p>In short, it's a Machlokes why the Afikoman is eaten during the Seder, either because it is a Zecher of the Korban Pesach, or that it is part of the Chiyuv to eat Matzah, or because Chazal wanted the taste of Matzah to remain in our mouths.  Over time, it seems to have become a weird hybrid of all of these Shitos.  </p>\n\n<p>As for not stuffing oneself, we obviously want to avoid potential Achilah Gasah issues.  See there.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it the same steps since I’m a gentile?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Teshuva requires understanding and admitting that what one has done wrong is a sin, and leaving sins behind and not doing them again (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20240/16354\">see here</a>).  </p>\n\n<p>If we assume that according to Judaism, belief in Jesus is a sin for you as a gentile (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/134/16354\">see here</a>, as well as other answers on that page), <strong>it seems that according to Judaism you could not do Teshuvah for believing in Jesus while simultaneously believing in him</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of repentance for other sins, you could of course repent, however, in all personal cases, it is suggested to see a Rabbi for guidance through a process like this. </p>\n\n<p>If you do believe in Jesus, it might also be worth asking this question on <a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com\">Christianity.SE</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The belief that Jesus is G-d violates the first Noahide Law against idolatry. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89/is-christianity-avodah-zara\">here</a>.) The believe that he's the son of G-d or messiah is a non-Jewish belief and has no place in Judaism but is not necessarily idolatry according to many authorities.  </p>\n\n<p>You ask if you can do teshuva. Of course you can. But I don't really understand the question. What sin are you doing teshuva for? Are you asking G-d to forgive you for believing in some mistaken belief or are you asking forgiveness for something else? </p>\n\n<p>If you did something wrong, you do teshuva. If you do two sins, you can do teshuva for one and not the other. Does that absolve both of them? No. It only resolves the sin for which you did teshuva. </p>\n\n<p>If you believe that believing Jesus is G-d is wrong, then you should do teshuva and abandon the belief. Like I said, I don't understand what you're asking here. </p>\n\n<p>But if you believe Jesus is G-d, then why are you asking this question on a Judaism site? For one thing, Christianity teaches that Jesus died for people's sins, so where does the concept of teshuva have any place in the eyes of a believer in Jesus? </p>\n\n<p>If you believe Jesus is G-d, Son of G-d, or Messiah, I advise you to ask this question somewhere else. Judaism rejects the notion that Jesus of Nazareth was any of these three things, therefore your question really isn't much about Judaism. I suggest you ask on some Christian forum or perhaps the <a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/\">Christianity Stack Exchange</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hmmm... \nI do realize christianity takes its base on jewish tradition and also value the practice of repentance. However, I also understand that christians take Jesus as a savior and redentor, nullifying hallachah and making a new pact. Therefore, if you are a christian, I understand that although you are not only allowed to repent but also encouraged to repent from your transgressions, if you do it the jewish way you would be denying jesus is your savior. If you do it the christian way, you deny Torah and hallachah.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to be a situation of making a circle fit in a square.\nAs a jew, perdonally, i see no problem if you apply a jewish concept in your way to repent as long as you recognize yourself a christian... however... it might bring you trouble with other christians? Not really sure.\nHope the... \"insight\" was of any help to you.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Does every woman have a destined match?",
    "content": "# Does every woman have a destined match?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a Talmudic statement in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 2a</a> which is commonly used as the source that every person has their destined match (the parameters of \"destined\" is a separate discussion):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והא אמר רב יהודה אמר רב ארבעים יום קודם יצירת הולד בת קול יוצאת ואומרת\n  בת פלוני לפלוני בית פלוני לפלוני שדה פלוני לפלוני</p>\n  \n  <p>for Rab Judah has said in the name of Rab: Forty days before the\n  creation of a child, a Bath Kol issues forth and proclaims, The\n  daughter of A is for B; the house of C is for D; the field of E is for\n  F! (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Sotah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At face value, this statement only speaks from the man's perspective. That is to say, when a man is born Heaven announces his destiny. This \"destiny\" consists of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92678/what-is-specific-about-the-pre-ordination-of-these-3-things-spouses-houses-a?rq=1\">his destined wife, his destined field and his destined house</a>. However, the Talmud makes no mention of a Heavenly announcement preceding a woman's birth wherein Ploni is destined for the Daughter of Ploni. </p>\n\n<p>Based on this, perhaps the concept of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shidduch#Bashert\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bashert</a>\" only applies to men and not to women. (This would seem to be a big chiddush, as every discussion of shidduchim that I've ever seen appears to be based on the premise that everyone, both men and women, have their destined match.)</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosafot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos</a> on the spot explicitly notes that the Talmud seems to be discussing the male perspective:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קודם יצירת הולד. נראה לרבי קודם יצירת הזכר בין אם לא נולדה הנקיבה עדיין בין אם נולדה</p>\n  \n  <p>Prior to the formation of the fetus. It appears to Rabbi [that the\n  Talmud is referring to] prior to the formation of the male, whether or\n  not the female has been born yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharsha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Samuel Eidels</a>, in his commentary to this Tosafos, appears to come perilously close to saying straight out that this only applies to males:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובתוס' בד\"ה קודם יצירת הולד נראה לר\"י קודם יצירת הזכר בין אם נולדה\n  הנקבה בין אם לא נולדה עדיין עכ\"ל. יראה דמשמע להו הכי דבת פלוני לפלוני\n  דומיא דבית ושדה פלוני לפלוני דביצירתו תליא מילתא ומדקאמר נמי בת פלוני\n  לפלוני משמע דבהריון הזכר שהוא בעולם (ושייך לומר עליו פלוני) תליא מילתא\n  אף שהנקבה אינה בעולם דלא שייך למימר עליה פלונית אלא בת שתהיה לפלוני\n  דאביה הוא בעולם ואפשר שלזה כוונו בפ' המפלת זכר זה כר נקבה נקייה באה\n  <strong>ר\"ל שהזכר נולד במזלו אבל הנקבה נקייה באה בלי מזל כי כבר נתלה מזלה ביצירת הזכר זוג שלה</strong> ועוד כתבנו שם פירוש אחר ע\"ש</p>\n  \n  <p>Meaning to say that the male is born with his destiny, but the woman\n  is clean. She comes without destiny because her destiny has already\n  been made dependent on the formation of her male partner. (Translation of bolded portion only)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In light of all this, is there actually an explicit Talmudic source that women have destined matches as well? Is this issue discussed in Rabbinic Literature (either on this Talmudic passage or elsewhere)? Have any contemporary shidduch discussions noted this?</p>\n\n<p>(Technically, a valid answer could be that the Talmud is not speaking so precisely, and simply did not bother to spell out that the reverse is true as well. However, I am primarily looking to see if any commentators even took note of this issue. If one did and concluded that the whole thing is not meant precisely, that is fine.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Edit for clarification:</h2>\n\n<p>It appears that I might not have done a good job explaining what I am asking. My question is based on two premises.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In my exposure to the Jewish world it seems that everyone takes for granted that there is a concept (sometimes referred to as \"bashert\") that every (Jewish?) person has a destined mate. This is not to say that everyone will automatically marry this mate, but it is to say that in a sense God has picked out a mate for each person. This concept is often used to comfort/encourage those who are having trouble finding a spouse, and most often seems to be based on the above Talmudic statement.</p></li>\n<li><p>To me it appears that the simple understanding of the Talmudic statement is that God picks out a woman for every man. It does not seem to say that God also picks out a man for every woman. I cited Tosafos and the  Maharsha because they both have comments to this Talmudic statement that indicate that they are aware that the Talmud appears to be speaking specifically to men.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Even before I ask the actual question, one can answer by challenging either of my two assumptions. If either of my assumptions is proven incorrect (either via sources or some other form of argumentation) then the question will never start.</p>\n\n<p>Now here is what I am not asking:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I am not asking a question on the Talmudic passage.</li>\n<li>I am not asking a question on Tosafos.</li>\n<li>I am not asking a question on the Maharsha.</li>\n<li>I am not asking a question about statistics.</li>\n<li>I am not asking why there should be a difference between men and women.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What I am asking is simply how we justify premise # 1 in light of premise # 2. That is to say, why is there such a pervasive belief about destined matches that is unsupported by the Talmud? Again, someone can answer by saying that I am wrong and there is not such a pervasive belief. Someone can answer that I am wrong and the belief <strong>is</strong> supported by the Talmud (I believe that is what <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/91156/does-every-woman-have-a-destined-match/91184#91184\">this answer</a> is attempting to do). Someone can answer that the belief serves a greater purpose so we keep it despite it being unsupported by the Talmud. Someone can answer that the great commentaries have struggled with this very question for hundreds of years. Someone can answer that the belief is indeed incorrect, but it will rarely have a practical impact (due to similar number of boys and girls) so nobody cares that the belief is technically not correct. (Perhaps that is what <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/91163/13438\">this answer</a> is arguing.) There are many different ways one can go about answering this question. Of course, answers with sources are very valuable; mere assertions have much less value.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to those who have already commented/answered. If I have still failed to adequately explain my question, please ask me to clarify further.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Tosfos HaRosh on the gemara in sotah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הא בזוג ראשון הא בזוג שני. פירוש שני לשניהם דאיזה מהם שהוא ראשון נגזר לו זוגו קודם יצירה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I have understood this correctly, he says that זוג שני in the gemara must refer to the second marriage for both man and woman. If it was first marriage for either, the marriage would have been from the decree pre-conception.</p>\n\n<p>This assumes that the statement in the gemara applies to both genders equally. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are various parallel passages to this Talmudic passage scattered througout Midrashim. One such passage is found in Bereshis Rabbah Parshah 68. In this Midrash we read about a matron who asked R. Yose Bar Chalafta what God has been doing since creating the world. R. Yose told her that God spends His time making matches:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מטרונה שאלה את ר' יוסי בר חלפתא אמרה לו לכמה ימים ברא הקב\"ה את עולמו\n  אמר לה לששת ימים כדכתיב כי ששת ימים עשה ה' את השמים ואת הארץ אמרה לו\n  מה הוא עושה מאותה שעה ועד עכשיו אמר לה הקב\"ה יושב ומזווג זיווגים בתו\n  של פלוני לפלוני אשתו של פלוני לפלוני ממונו של פלוני לפלוני</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While this is the text in the standard version, the critical edition by Albeck & Chanoch actually has a slightly different text:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מטרונה שאלה את ר' יוסי לכמה ימים ברא הקב\"ה את עולמו אמר לה לששת ימים\n  מאותה שעה מהו עסוק אמר לה יושב הוא <strong>ומזווג זיווגים איש לאשה ואשה לאיש</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The phrase that I bolded might be the answer to the question here. The apparent redundancy of \"man to woman\" and \"woman to man\" may be telling us that every man has a woman who is his match, <strong>and</strong> every woman has a man who is her match.</p>\n\n<p>If this understanding is correct, this would be a source in Hazalic Literature that both men and women have destined matches.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here is the actual page (full PDF <a href=\"https://ia800207.us.archive.org/3/items/bereschitrabba02albe/bereschitrabba02albe.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) of the critical edition of Bereshis Rabbah with the phrase underlined:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sZqhO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/sZqhO.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The version in Yalkut Shimoni, both in Bereshis 117 and in Tehillim 794, has this phrase as well. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You seem to have provided pretty good sources that this gemara in fact does not apply to women. I agree with your conclusion based on your evidence.</p>\n\n<p>You ask on this, how is it that \"everyone\" uses this as a source for the idea that everyone has a predestined match. I believe that you are requesting a source that would discredit your sources. I disagree with your approach.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, we don't know who \"everyone\" is. However, taking \"everyone\" into consideration, suppose you are right, and there is no source for women being given a predestined match. \"Everyone\" would still be right! That is, because at least 95% of women (so be super safe) are the subject of some man's bas kol. This should give heart to any girl struggling with shidduchim, that someone out there is meant to go and find her, and her name has already been picked for the special someone out there for whom she was chosen by Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>I believe what I write is very sensible, however it does not provide you with that which you asked for, that is, \"is there actually an explicit Talmudic source that women have destined matches as well? etc.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Another question might be, \"what is the meaning of this disparity?\" Al berko touched on this issue, however he might have done a better job...)</p>\n\n\n",

There, since the passage is clearly referring to twilight on erev shabbat in particular, Rashi explains why so generic a term is used by suggesting that we most often <em>think</em> of twilight in relation to Shabbat: this is the time by which all of our Shabbat preparation needs to be completed, and it's therefore a more important twilight than any other.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in Masekhet Shabbat, Rashi gives a <em>different</em> explanation. There, on daf 86b, Rashi says that twilight on erev shabbat can simply be referred to as \"twilight\", not because of its importance but because of the frequency with which the Talmud mentions that particular twilight specifically.</p>\n\n<p>Most interesting to me is that Rashi <em>also</em> addresses this issue in a third masekhta, Masekhet Taanit! And there, on daf 25a, he says that he has no idea why twilight on erev shabbat is just called \"twilight\"!!</p>\n\n<p>It would seem to me that Rashi's peirush on Taanit must have been written before his peirushim on Shabbat and Ketubot, since he seems to have come up with two different explanations for the same phenomenon in the time since declaring that he didn't have even one.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: I found these passages using <em>liqqutei rashi</em>, which is printed in the margins of my gemara. Has anybody done anything similar, working out a broader order in which Rashi's peirushim would have been written? It would be interesting to get a sense as to the relative order in which he compiled them, and the extent to which his opinions and interpretations changed over that time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yisrael Isser Tzvi Herczeg wrote a book \"Patterns in Rashi\" (there is a more expanded Hebrew volume of his דרכי רש''י. He mentions that Rashi's commentary only explains the <em>sugia</em> of <em>masechta</em> where it belongs. It is common for Rashi to say differing comments on the same matter in different places in Gemara. Perhaps, timing of a comment can be a factor. The primary issue at hand though is a specific law or aggadeta discussed. I.e. the Rashi's comment should be viewed only in the context of the law or aggadeta, which he is trying to explain. Tosafos comments address commonality of issues across Gemara and perhaps somewhere in the places that you mention you may might find the Tosafos comment discussing all 3 place that you found.</p>\n\n\n",

There are, of course, exceptions to this: various Chasidic groups use the daled knot, and certain Sephardi communities use the square knot (such as the London community). </p>\n\n<p>Some have told me that the use of the square knot is obsolete, and that one should use the daled knot, even if his family custom is to use a square. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/75265/11486\">Some</a> have even cited Rav Soloveitchik in this. </p>\n\n<p>A few questions:</p>\n\n<p>What are the origins of both knots?</p>\n\n<p>Is there a reason why Ashkenazim use a square knot while Sephardim use a daled? Also, considering that Spanish-Portuguese customs usually reflect an older Sephardi tradition, does this mean that the older custom is to use a square knot? </p>\n\n<p>Why would a daled knot be preferred, when it seems the square knot is older?</p>\n\n<p>If you look at companies which sell tefillin online (whether this is a good idea or not aside), the default option is to have a daled. Square knots are usually tied upon special request. Could it be that the daled knot is much easier to tie? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your question begins with a misunderstanding; I am sepharadi, and the dalet knot does not exist in our tradition. That custom began in ashkenaz and became standard due to a literal examination of the text. Every sepharadi community is halachically obligated to use a square knot because that's what we have always done. We started using dalet knots when sepharadim moved to the states and israel, and when turning in tefillin to get checked by ashkenazi sopherim it would be returned with dalet knots. Nothing to do with sepharadi custom or obligation. It just took over in the last century because of assimilation and people not caring about preserving their traditions.</p>\n\n\n",

This is not the case with a regular Mitzva e.g Blowing Shofar where there is no intention and no benefit for the body his mind comes first.<br>\nThis is also the opinion of Rashi pesachim 119b who says לאחר שמילא כריסו הימנו היאך חוזר ומברך עליו - after he has filled his stomach (i.e benefitted from eating the matza) has he not already fulfilled the Mitzva and therefore can't make a Brocho after he has already eaten even though he has negative intention not to fulfill the Mitzva untill Aphikomen.</p>\n\n<p>Rabeinu Yerucham in the name of Tosfos however argues and says that if he knows its Matza and does not want to eat it and is forced to eat it even though he is hungry his negative intention can negate the Mitzva so he would be able to make a Brocho at Afikoman if he specifically does not want to fulfill his Mitzva (and Tosfos 115b holds like Rashi and the Rashbam that the aphikomen is the main Mitzva although tosfos is saying is that as long as there is no hesech hadaas between the motzi matza and Afikomen then you can even make a brocho on the first matza with כוונה and only be Yotzei the mitzva later on during the \"continuation of eating\" afikomen later in the meal , (no idol chatter distractions during the meal otherwise repeat Brocho of al Achilas Matza befor Aphikomen, Rav Neverzal ) so its the same result just Rabeinu Yerucham allows you to chat during the meal as bircas Mitzva is before Aphikomen. ).</p>\n\n<p>Since The Rambam (Chomeitz Umatza 8), Rashi, Rashbam (pes. 119b),Ran,Tur and Shulchan aruch (O.C 475) (it could be even rabeinu Yerucham and Tosfos also hold like the Rambam that the Afikomen merely represents the paschal lamb and is not the main mitzva of Matza which is at Motzi matza) clearly say to make a bircas hamitzva at Motzi matza that is what we do lehalacha.</p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p>*הרמב\"ם פסק בהל' חמץ ומצה כדשלחו ליה לאבוה דשמואל דכפאוהו עו\"ג יצא ובפ\"ב מהלכות שופר פסק כר' זירא ותמהו הר\"ן וה\"ה שנראה שדבריו סותרין את דבריו והר\"ן בס\"פ ראוהו כתב דאיכא למימר דלא פליגא דידיה אדידיה דס\"ל דבתקיעת שופר כיון דחזינן דר' זירא אמר לשמעיה איכוין ותקע לי נקטינן דצריך כוונה אבל בכפאוהו ואכיל מצה כיון דלא חזינן בגמרא מאן דפליג עליה בהדיא לא דחינן ליה דאע\"ג דבתקיעת שופר לא יצא הכא יצא כדאמרינן בעלמא (כריתות יט.) המתעסק בחלבים ובעריות חייב שכן נהנה ובגמרא נמי עבדינן צריכותא ממצה לשופר הלכך אע\"ג דשופר מידחיא דקי\"ל צריך כוונה בכפאוהו ואכל נקטינן דיצא: ובהא דכפאוהו עו\"ג ואכל מצה יצא כתב דדוקא כה\"ג יצא שיודע הוא שעכשיו פסח וזו מצה אלא שאינו מתכוין לצאת אבל כסבור חול הוא ואכל מצה או כסבור לאכול בשר ואכל מצה ודאי לא יצא דאם איתא למה לי למינקט כפאוהו עו\"ג לינקוט חד מהני גווני אלא ודאי כדאמרן עכ\"ל וכ\"כ ה\"ה ג\"כ ובהכי אתי שפיר שכתב שאם אנסוהו עו\"ג לאכול מצה יצא ולא כתב שאם אכלן בלא מתכוין יצא דבלא מתכוין בכל גוונא דלאו מתכוין משמע. אבל רבינו ירוחם כתב בשם התוספות דכפאוהו ואכל מצה מיירי שהיה סבור שהוא חמץ ונמצא שאכל מצה אבל אם ידע שהיא מצה ולא רצה לאכלה וכפאוהו ואכלה לא יצא ואפי' למ\"ד דמצות אין צריכות כוונה אם מתכוין שלא לצאת לא יצא עכ\"ל:</p>\n\n\n",

(The article speaks in terms of microcosm and compares the Genesis account to other far \"Near Eastern Creation stories\".)   The article mentions God being like a priest because He a) gives blessings, b)consecrates the Sabbath, and c) parallels are seen between constructing the Earth and the construction of the Tabernacle.    Anyway I was wondering if anyone had more to add to this topic?

(Because 1 Darkon according to Rambam is 8 Dinarin and 25 Dinarin are in a Dinar Zahav so that means 25/8 Darkonos are in a Dinar Zahav, which is the same as 3 + 1/8 (which it says on the chart for the number of selaim!)), and that would mean that since 1 Darkon is 2 Selaim, so that means that 3 + 1/8 Darkonos = 2 * (3 + 1/8) Selaim = 6 + 1/4 Selaim, so according to the Rambam 6 + 1/4 Selaim = 1 dinar zahav, while according to this chart 3 + 1/8 selaim = dinar zahav (and the chart doesn't even mention darkonos, not sure if it's relevant though)</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know how to answer this contradiction?</p>\n\n<p>Also,\nI'm aware that everything up to the Dinar Zahav was either silver or copper, and the Dinar Zahav was gold, but the Maneh and Kikar etc. are higher than the Dinar Zahav, were they also gold, or silver?</p>\n\n\n",

I've done it myself. Additionally there are many ways to get the sulfites (free SO2) out (either by letting them dissipate or making them bind with something else) which would then allow you to even use regular yeasts (although they can't get the alcohol content as high). However, I have not found a good source as to whether the fact that you are able to add something else to grape juice to make it ferment is enough to make it considered on its way to fermenting (as Rav Elyashiv and the Teshuvos Vehanhagos say is necessary) without adding anything. I haven't found anyone who disagrees with this explicitly although I have seen a few Poskim who clearly would hold its okay. Certainly the Minhag is to be lenient- after all most people in America would have no problem with someone making Kiddush on Kedem grape juice. Does anyone have a strong Raya as to whether the fact that you could add/do something to the grape juice to cause it to ferment is enough to make you allowed to make Kiddush on it without adding anything?</p>\n\n<p>By the way, although I'm not done working on this piece I gave it as a Shiur yesterday, in part because I wanted to see what everyone attending the Shiur had to say. Anyway I only had about 20 minutes so I didn't get through anywhere near everything anyway. You will notice that I did mention that I had an open bounty on this question on judaism.stackexchange ;) \nI only remembered to say the story I found at @user15464's link after I ended the recording since it wasn't in my original Shiur plan so I restarted the recording afterwards (I also added a few more details I found after doing some more research). If you want to hear the story just don't get scared off by the way the recording goes silent for five seconds. You can listen to the Shiur <a href=\"http://www.ohrreuvenapp.com/shiur/24536\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and if you have any comments please let me know as soon as possible so I can make changes before I publish in the coming weeks. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>- The Sefer was published a while ago. If you'd like to see how I handled this you can download the Sefer <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YopEVlZ21jG6KWqs59rj4AxVKG68jatL/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and read it on page 36.

That juice will not contain any live yeast but yet the Chayei Adam holds you can make Kiddush on it.</p>\n\n<p>I'm still hoping for a significantly better proof, and I'm confident that a good proof from the Rishonim or earlier exists but I haven't found it (although I won't know for sure that I haven't found it until I'm done doing all the research @DoubleAA wants me to do).</p>\n\n<p>The Shevet HaLevi 9:58 also brings some incredibly strong reasons why it should be permitted to make Kiddush even if it can't ferment, but as I mentioned in the question that's not what I'm looking for. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The source that Grapejuice must be alcoholic is from the Gemora Brochos35b:<br>\n The Gemora asks מאי שנא יין - why does wine have a unique <em>Brocho</em> different to grapes?<br>\nThe Gemora answers אית ביה תרתי סעיד ומשמח - It has 2 properties its filling (when drinking in lesser consumption) and it Gladdens. The Gemora derives that wine is supposed to gladden from tehiim 104,15-  ויין ישמח לבב אנוש.</p>\n\n<p>Bava Basra 97b however says: סוחט אדם אשכול של ענבים ואומר עליו קידוש היום - One can the squeeze the grape juice from the grapes immediately prior to Kiddush (before Shabbos commences) it is considered wine even though it hasn't fermented yet. So we see its the potential that matters.</p>\n\n<p>This is a quote from <a href=\"http://www.torahlab.org/doitright/using_grape_juice_for_kiddush/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.torahlab.org/doitright/using_grape_juice_for_kiddush/</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemara (Bava Basra 97b) states that one may (ipso facto) squeeze a cluster of grapes into their cup and say Kiddush, seemingly indicating that grape juice is permissible to use for kiddush, and all other sacramental purposes.<br>\n  This is how the halacha is decided in Shulchan Aruch (272:2). However the Magen Avraham (3) adds that it is preferred to use aged wine, at least forty days old.<br>\n  Rabbi Hurewitz’s position, and this position was initially held by Rav Henkin as well, was that our grape juice was different than the grape juice discussed in the Gemara. After squeezing grapes, the juice can either be turned to wine, or it will spoil. Contemporarily, in order to have grape juice, we pasteurize it, which gives it a long shelf life as unfermented juice.<br>\n  The reason that grape juice was permissible in the Gemara was because it was, in essence, unfermented wine. However our grape juice, in order to preserve the grape juice it is necessary to pasteurize it, effectively neutering its potentiality of becoming wine. Thus, argued Rabbi Hurewitz, it was not the same as the grape juice of the Gemara.<br>\n  Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank, (Har Tzvi, OC 1:158) in a letter to Rabbi Hurewitz disputes this. He writes that just as cooked wine is permissible for Kiddush, because we recognize it as retaining the character of wine despite it being cooked (and despite it not being usable in the Bais Hamikdash and therefore not being an ideal choice) so too grape juice will retain its character despite being cooked and will still be permitted. This is also the position of Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Minchas Shlomo 1:4).<br>\n  Rav Henkin in a later responsum on the subject retracts his reservations regarding using grape juice for a different reason. He consulted with Mr. Herzog, of Herzog Winery fame, who demonstrated to him how one can easily fermented even pasteurized grape juice by adding a little sugar and yeast and leaving it exposed, thus refuting the pasteurization argument from a scientific perspective as well.</p>\n  \n  <p>The common practice, and the position of the vast majority of contemporary poskim including Rav Moshe Feinstein, Rav Elyashiv, Rav Ovadia Yosef, Rav Soloveitchik, and the aforementioned poskim, is that grape juice may be used for Kiddush and all other sacramental purposes. Many do note the position of the Magen Avraham, that it is preferred to use wine when possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that just like bread could leaven via sour dough which an external source and the Torah still prohibits this bread on Pesach as it has leavened despite from an external source, so too grape-juice can be externally fermented even after killing off the original yeast by adding new yeast. So the the pasteurized juice <em>still</em> has the potential to react with yeast which Bava Basra 97b says is considered wine, so that is why Rav Henkin consented after having seen that the grapejuice can still ferment with new added yeast. </p>\n\n\n",

Certainly, today, we see numerous <em>ba'alat teshuva</em> as well as \"FTP\"'s (\"Frumer than Parents\" - this seems to be a common <em>shidduch</em> resume abbreviation, BTW) as well as other reasons. I would imagine that during the time of the Gemarah, there were also such daughters. It seems that the <em>Gemarah</em> focused attention on the parents regardless of the daughter's status. Why is that? Were they concerned that the parents would be a heavy influence?</li>\n<li>Has anyone written a <em>teshuva</em>, etc. that would allow a man to marry a learned girl, today? If so, how do they interpret this ruling and why would it not apply, today?</li>\n<li>As an extension, what if the girl is also an <em>am ha'aretz</em> but is becoming learned?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Don't have precise source right now, but I recall reading that, at Talmud time, almost all the education of girls was from her parents; so <em>bas am haaretz</em> had little chance to be different.

And it is written: “And the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day” (Exodus 16:4). And it is written: “The people went about and gathered it” (Numbers 11:8). How can these texts be reconciled? For the righteous, the manna fell at the opening of their homes. They expended no effort at all.

The mun fell all over; inside, around, and beyond the camp. Whoever woke up early to daven/learn and be responsible, was a tzadik and took first come first serve. People waking up respectably later, had to walk farther, and people goofing off still got to eat, but had to suffer the dishonor of straggling about in search.

The most virtuous and wise of them said although he knew his truck was taken he was able to come to a wise realization of \nthe unorthodoxy of the ambience and as such the other man's trickery and remained calm because the other man was absent and knows all the wicked ones are asleep at the hour we were up to work. In other words - if for better or for worse - in the past, future and certainly the present - early risers tend to not only get more done in their life but are of , generally speaking, the of people whom self discipline, direction, reward and manhood are of a positive connotations. Who knows what the ancients were thinking or what they were trying to infer?

Effort is made to treat the second day of Yom Tov of golus as if Yom Tov is starting for the first time.  It is given the same respect, as though there were an actual doubt when Yom Tov begins.  Since counting sefirah must start on the night following the first day of Yom Tov, counting sefirah before the Seder contradicts the idea of starting the Seder anew.  Therefore, counting sefirah is placed toward the end of the haggadah, when the mitzvos of the night have concluded.  Those who count sefirah earlier maintain, zerizim makdimim l’mitzvos, i.e., mitzvos should be performed at the first opportunity.  This is especially so regarding sefirah, according to the opinion it is med’Oraisa (a Torah obligation) even when there is no Omer offering.</p>\n\n\n",

We generally hold as the Rambam does that Muslims are not idolatrers, but that Islam is avodah zarah (in the literal sense of \"foreign worship\")for Jews. The Rambam in Hilchot  Avodat Cochavim states that Christians (\"the Edomites\" in the version I have) are idolatrors, but not all hold that way. You could also do an interesting analysis of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Protestant practices, there are certainly arguments to be made that the former are idolatrous in a way that the latter is not (ignoring the unity of Hashem for such purposes). Regardless, it is an interesting maloches.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of \"needing to\" give your life to idolatry today, though Buddhism as practiced inside and outside of Asia is a pretty nonviolent faith,it would not be entirely outside the realm of possibity to imagine being forced to practice Buddhism in contemporary Myanmar/Burma. </p>\n\n<p>Hindus are generally a pretty tolerant bunch (see close to 2000 years of Jewish life in India as an example) and where they're not it usually involves Islam, so I think the only possible forced avodah zarah scenario there involves being kidnapped by a renegade Hindu inspired cult.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, for most of the Edomite Galut, the problem regarding forced Avodah Zarah has mainly come from Christianity; I am unaware of any country where this is still an issue.</p>\n\n<p>On an interesting side note, many \"new age\" and other \"spiritual\" types, Jewish and Goyish alike, put quite a bit of time and effort into studying astrology, which is at least \"Avodah Zarah-adjascent\" if not outright idol worship.Then again, who's forcing you to read horoscopes?</p>\n\n\n",

What are the <em>dis</em>qualifications?</p>\n<p>For example, I have been told that someone who is not Shomer Shabbat, or a Kohen who has married a Giur, may not read from the Torah. These are the sort of disqualifications I mean.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I will try to add to this as I find more info, so this is a partial answer.</p>\n\n<p>It is a given (it should be, at least) that the reader must be able to pronounce Hebrew pretty much flawlessly. This is not to say that, inevitably, even an expert reader wouldn't make occasional mistakes. But, someone who has trouble pronouncing most Hebrew words or can't read Hebrew without vowels should not be the reader. (See my comment above re what often happens in Reform and Conservative shuls, and, sadly, a number of Orthodox ones, as well. <strong>major</strong> problem!)</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2012/04/23/aliyah-for-mechalel-shabbos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> regarding giving aliyot to non-Shomer Shabbat people. Rav Feinstein ruled that if the person is an <em>avaryan</em> - e.g. he is not <em>Shomer Shabat</em> because he feels he must go to work, you can give him an <em>aliyah</em> and thus, have him read (See general rule, explained, below.)) However, those that publicly violate Shabbat may not be given an aliyah, and thus, may not read. Orchos Rabbeinu (p. 122), in the name of the Steipler Rebbe does not make this distinction and says that any non-Shomer Shabbat person may receive an aliyah.</p>\n\n<p>Certain disabilities disqualify a person from reading the Torah in public. I should mention that in understanding public Torah reading, the general rule is that we assume that the original obligation is for each <em>oleh</em> to read his own section. You'll find this to be the general guideline in O.C. It's only later that the Shat\"z became the shul Torah reader, and later in time, the Shat\"z's role was \"reduced\" to just <em>tefilla</em> and shuls had designated Torah readers. Thus, when reading the halachot, you can assume that if the <em>oleh</em> is disqualified to receive an <em>aliya</em> because he can't read for his own aliyah, it's a given that he can't be a <em>ba'al Kri'ah</em> reading an entire parsha.</p>\n\n<p>Having said this, see pages 171 - 178 in this <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=WYKCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=who%20is%20disqualified%20from%20reading%20the%20torah&source=bl&ots=__1YtbVR1r&sig=2MmrmWovm-FAggNsuw1hL1w2T_I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDqpb47NXaAhVGAqwKHakpDs0Q6AEIUjAH#v=onepage&q=who%20is%20disqualified%20from%20reading%20the%20torah&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google book</a>. There is a debate as to whether the blind can read from the Torah. The debate stems on a combo of the rule of \"written words of Torah should not be recited by heart\". Does this rule apply to individual / private Torah reading or public reading? Also see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=38\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 139:2</a> - debate between <em>Mechaber</em> and <em>Mahari\"l</em></p>\n\n<p>Most opinions say that a mute cannot read because he can't audibly say the words. However, it seems that many opinions allow someone who uses a voice processor to be able to read.</p>\n\n<p>The deaf pose an interesting question. There's a question as to whether sign language can be sued as a means of Torah reading. I'll post a MY link on this aspect, later, as I asked this question a while ago. Most current rabbinical opinions state that the standard halachic <em>cherish</em> definition mentioned in the Talmud does not apply to most deaf people today as most can speak well. Numerous others use hearing aids and cochlear implants (which BTW are considered <strong>more</strong> halachically acceptable than aids regarding halachic hearing questions.) Thus, most opinions are that the deaf can read, but, you may find some opinions that disqualify them.</p>\n\n\n",

The Malbim explains that in earlier times a prophet was called a roeh because the main function of the prophet was to “see” with his Divine Inspiration, and use that to help individuals discover that which was hidden from them (whether in terms of lost items or self-improvement). For example, when Shaul lost his father’s donkeys, he sought out the prophet Samuel to either help him find them or figure out what sin he had committed which led to this loss (I Sam. 9). In essence, a roeh was sought out by those wished to consult with them.</p>\n\n<p>In later generations Jewish society degenerated, and a new type of prophet emerged: A navi was G-d’s messenger sent to rebuke the nation for their sins, and bring them back to the proper path. The navi did not generally speak to the individual, but to the public at large. As opposed to the roeh who was sought out, the navi was a feared character, from whom people tended to run away.</p>\n\n<p>The Vilna Gaon (to Prov. 22:12, Isa. 1:1) explains that the terms navi and roeh/chozeh focus on different aspects of a prophet’s function. The word navi, as we mentioned above, is related to the word niv which refers to the prophet’s mouth.</p>\n\n<p>That word focuses on the prophet’s role in relaying with his mouth G-d’s message.</p>\n\n<p>However, the words roeh and chozeh refer to the prophet “seeing” a certain vision which he is to convey to others. Within this role of the prophet, the Vilna Gaon explains, there are two types of Seers: One is called a roeh,which is the Hebrew word for “he who sees”, and was the term used for the earliest prophets, whose clarity in the visions they saw was quite sharp. A later prophet, by contrast, is called a chozeh, the Aramaic word for “he who sees”. Because Hebrew is considered a more spiritually-attuned language than Aramaic, later prophets are referred to by an Aramaic term for “Seer”. This shows that those prophets were not as clear on the meaning of their visions as the earlier prophets were. For this reason, a later prophet is called a chozeh (and his vision a chazon/machaze), and an earlier prophet, a roeh (and his vision is called a mareh).</p>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <em><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/whats-in-a-word/x8FnJRPT2LA/dg6f6qZuDQAJ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's in a Word?</a></em>, \"<a href=\"https://ohr.edu/this_week/whats_in_a_word/8165\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prophets and Visionaries</a>\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why isn't it considered Borer to use a spoon to take cholent from a cholent pot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are three requirements in Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 319 to separate food (or other needed articles) from a mixture on Shabbos without it being a melacha of borer.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Good from the bad.</li>\n<li>With one’s hand.</li>\n<li>Immediate use.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It's usually understood that a spoon is considered to be an extension of one's hand, but this doesn't seem to apply to a cholent pot because cholent can be very hot so taking it with one's hands directly would be difficult and probably somewhat painful. If I wouldn't be able to separate the cholent without the help of the spoon, how can I still consider that spoon to be an extension of my hand?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Cholent is considered a mixture of beans, potatoes, meat, etc. If you dip into cholent with a spoon, you are separating one glob of cholent from another glob. IOW, you are taking a mixture from a mixture. Since what you took is still mixed up, you have not performed \"selection\" of one type from another. So you have not performed borer at all.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch in O.C. 319 (as another user has already shown) is the source of these laws.</p>\n\n<p>A technical way to look at it, is that borer can only be violated if you separate one \"type\" from another \"type\". (see Rema 319) The poskim explain that a type is defined by a piece either having a different taste, or a different name. (see for example Pri Megadim on 319: 5, and 19)</p>\n\n<p>For example, salty crackers mixed with sweet crackers, may look similar and are made from almost similar ingredients and are both called cracker; <strong>but they taste different.</strong> Also, salami and bologna etc.</p>\n\n<p>OR if they have <strong>a different name (or function)</strong> like kosher candy mixed with non kosher candy of the same type and flavor (one has a hechsher while the other does not because it has a treif ingredient) or juice oranges mixed with eating oranges. Also, forks and spoons mixed up in a close pile together. Some also say size matters if the item is specifically sold in different sizes. But as shown by another user, 319 tells us that bigger slices and smaller slices of the same thing is not a borer mixture.</p>\n\n<p>So based on this we can easily see that your spoon of cholent as compared to the remaining cholent in the pot you left behind is a) also called \"cholent\" and b) tastes just like \"cholent\", so it is not two types being separated at all. Therefore there is no borer.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Taz is of the strict opinion to not allow separating even one type from its own type! But the Mishnah Berurah tells us that many poskim do not agree with the Taz. In any case, the Taz allows you to take what you want (the \"good\") from what you wish to leave behind (the \"bad\") as usual. so you can take what you want, with your hand, for use right away, even according to the Taz when taking one type from itself.</p>\n\n<p>(According to everyone then, the way to encounter forbidden borer with cholent is if you do not like potatoes and use a spoon to sift and pick out the potatoes from the cholent mixture in order to discard the potatoes.)</p>\n\n<p>However, how can we say that a Ladel is an extension of (or just like) your hand? </p>\n\n<p>Sefer Shmiras Shabbos K'Hilchasah explains (Ch:3:126) that there are actually 3 ways to use a utensil as merely an extension of your hand (so it counts as \"by hand\" and not a \"kli\")</p>\n\n<p>1) Convenience: avoiding getting your hands dirty.</p>\n\n<p>2) You cannot reach deep into the pot without it (The utensil merely facilitates covering distance or accessibility).</p>\n\n<p>3) If the utensil is the only way you can perform the act (like peeling an apple with a regular knife, which is permitted.) In this case, we say that since you would not be willing to take your nails and scratch the peel off, the knife is your only way to eat the apple in a normal manner (without the peel).

Up until thirty (days), it is softened. After twelve moths, it returns to the scabbard. What is the thing similar to? (It is similar) to a dome built of stones. Since one of them is diminished, all of them are diminished. And Rebbe (Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi) said trying to help, if a male child is born in the family, the entire family is healed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The allegory of the family experiencing the mourning being compared to a <em>dome made of stones</em> (כיפה של אבנים) suggests according to the natural order of things that the senior family member would be the one passing away. That individual would be compared to the keystone in a masonry dome. It locks the entire structure together and enables the cohesive strength of the whole dome. When the single keystone is removed, the whole dome becomes unstable.</p>\n<p>But Rebbe adds that if a male child (בן like אבן) is born to the mourning family during that year, then the missing stone is replaced and the structure is made strong and whole again.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting the choice of structure in the allegory, <em>a dome</em> (כיפה). This alludes to the traditional Jewish headcovering (yalmuke) which all Jewish males are required to wear. In context, it would be a sign of one who accepts the authority of the Oral Torah, the continuous oral tradition transmitted via the Talmud which ties us all together.</p>\n<p>The Seudat Mitzvah being referred to is the informal Shalom Zachar meal made in the home of the parents on the first Friday night (or the Brit Yitzchok meal made among Sephardi Jews the evening before the Brit) following the birth like is mentioned by the Rema in Yoreh De'ah 265:12.

However, as soon as he enters the air of this world, an angel comes and strikes him on his mouth, causing him to forget the entire Torah\". Because the baby forgot all the Torah he learned, he is likened to a mourner.

Is it real? Where is is from? How to do it? Etc. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>To expand on Joel's answer, you would be able to determine the correct cantillation by determining where to place the divisions and subdivisions within the verse, and once you have the divisions, there are rules determining what goes around them. (This isn't to say there is one objective way of determining <em>where</em> the divisions are.)</p>\n\n<p>To take the verse you gave as an example to show how the cantillation was determined:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֵּחָלֵק עֲלֵיהֶם לַיְלָה הוּא וַעֲבָדָיו וַיַּכֵּם וַיִּרְדְּפֵם עַד-חוֹבָה אֲשֶׁר מִשְּׂמֹאל לְדַמָּשֶׂק</p>\n  \n  <p>And he chased after them by night, he and his servants, and he struck them; and he chased them until Hobah, which is north of Damascus</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You would start by dividing the verse into two sections, which the te'amim do at the word וַיַּכֵּם, and so the etnachta is placed on וַיַּכֵּם. Now we would have to divide the two halves of the verse into further subdivisions, working backwards from each half of the verse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֵּחָלֵק עֲלֵיהֶם לַיְלָה הוּא וַעֲבָדָיו וַיַּכֵּ֑ם </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The last division here is at the word וַעֲבָדָיו, and so the greatest available ta'am is used to separate it from וַיַּכֵּ֑ם, the tippecha. (The tippecha is always the last pause before an etnachta, and always comes either one or two words before the etnachta.)</p>\n\n<p>The previous division (since we are working backwards) is לַיְלָה. If it were a greater division than וַעֲבָדָיו it would deserve a zakef katan (or its equivalent); however, since it is more of a subdivision of the phrase וַיֵּחָלֵק עֲלֵיהֶם לַיְלָה, הוּא וַעֲבָדָיו than its own phrase, it gets the next rank, which is (always before a tippecha) the tevir.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, since there are no more divisions, we only have to use the filler cantillation (\"servants\") that don't divide, which is automatic: Before a tippecha we put a mercha; before a tevir we put a darga,<sup>1</sup> and before a darga we put a kadma.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֵּחָלֵ֨ק עֲלֵיהֶ֧ם ׀ לַ֛יְלָה ה֥וּא וַעֲבָדָ֖יו וַיַּכֵּ֑ם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the second half:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּרְדְּפֵם עַד־חוֹבָה אֲשֶׁר מִשְּׂמֹאל לְדַמָּשֶׂק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Once again, working backwards, we know there has to be a tippecha on either מִשְּׂמֹאל or אֲשֶׁר. Since מִשְּׂמֹאל is a greater division, the tippecha goes there. Now we have to continue backwards until the next division, which is חוֹבָה, and thus gets a zakef katan. Continuing to work backwards, וַיִּרְדְּפֵם is a subdivision of the phrase וַיִּרְדְּפֵם עַד־חוֹבָה and so it gets a pashta for being before a zakef katan. (It would have gotten a munach if we had instead decided it wasn't a division.) Now the only servant to add here is a mercha before the tippecha, which gives the full verse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֵּחָלֵ֨ק עֲלֵיהֶ֧ם ׀ לַ֛יְלָה ה֥וּא וַעֲבָדָ֖יו וַיַּכֵּ֑ם וַֽיִּרְדְּפֵם֙ עַד־חוֹבָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר מִשְּׂמֹ֖אל לְדַמָּֽשֶׂק׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was a short verse, but the same type of rules apply to longer verses too. Given where to place the divisions (such as by using Mechon Mamre's punctuation), and given their levels, you would be able to predict with reasonable accuracy how to punctuate this verse as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֗אמֶר צֵ֣א וְעָמַדְתָּ֣ בָהָר֮ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָה֒ וְהִנֵּ֧ה יְהֹוָ֣ה עֹבֵ֗ר וְר֣וּחַ גְּדוֹלָ֡ה וְחָזָ֞ק מְפָרֵק֩ הָרִ֨ים וּמְשַׁבֵּ֤ר סְלָעִים֙ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה לֹ֥א בָר֖וּחַ יְהֹוָ֑ה וְאַחַ֤ר הָר֙וּחַ֙ רַ֔עַשׁ לֹ֥א בָרַ֖עַשׁ יְהֹוָֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To learn these methods, there are books written on the subject (Joel pointed to one of them), but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantillation#Functions_of_cantillation_signs_in_explanation_of_text\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> is a good starting point.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the predictability, the te'amim are themselves a subjective interpretation of the verse, and there are times when they seem to change the plain meaning for theological reasons (e.g. to avoid saying seraphs stand above God at Isaiah 6:2, to avoid calling human God at Ezekiel 28:14, to change \"gods\" to \"God\" at Psalms 36:8) or just give other possible readings (Psalms 73:8 could have been read differently), or are simply mystifying (I have yet to understand the te'amim on Isaiah 12:2).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1 It really should be a mercha, since a darga is only used when there are 2 intervening syllables between the two stressed syllables, but the darga is apparently used here because there is a pasek after עֲלֵיהֶם.

Each half-verse constituted by the main dichotomy - if of sufficient length - was divided by a <em>minor</em> dichotomy. And the parts thus formed were subjected to the same  process...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wickes goes into great detail in his book describing how this system (which he calls 'the Law of Continuous Dichotomy') works.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the system of <em>trup</em> looks for the main dividing point in a verse, and places the major pausal note (ususally <em>etnachta</em>) there. Then each half-verse is also divided, and, based on a whole system of rules, those major divisions are noted.</p>\n\n<p>We now have four quarter-verses, and we can continue to divide the partial verses according to the rules of the system, as long as the clause is long enough.</p>\n\n<p>Having said all this, it is not necessarily the case that one would be able to add the <em>trup</em> to a verse himself.</p>\n\n<p>As Wickes notes (chapters III and IV) there are many verses where there are multiple options as to where to place the divisions, and different, competing priorities to consider when dividing. Also, musical considerations can often play an important role in how to apply the rules.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the system itself sometimes allows a choice between alternative notes. (E.g. see Wickes p.77 where he discusses how the system allows a choice of <em>pashta</em> or <em>revi'i</em> in certain circumstances.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To answer your first question: Is it real?</p>\n\n<p>The Torah Temima in his sefer M'kor Boruch quotes a friend of his, a Dikduk expert (I don't remember his name) who was able to determine the trop of any Posuk if given just the asnachta. The expert couldn't explain his own system; he had processed it subconsciously (ala <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink:_The_Power_of_Thinking_Without_Thinking\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Blink</a>).</p>\n\n<p>I have a brother who can also determine trop in any Posuk with about 75% accuracy.

Even if they come into contact with a source of ritual impurity, they do not become impure. Beyond a certain size, containers are no longer considered vessels and, consequently, cannot become ritually impure.

I am assuming that there was no dispute as to exactly what that length of time was as there was an agreed / standard definition of when sunset begins and when <em>tzet</em> begins.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud brings in a debate of these two endpoints, which makes me assume that the definition of בן השמשות is not as clear.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, do the Torah term and the Talmudic term refer to the same time span and these two terms are simply synonymous? Or are these referring to different time spans? If so, what are the differences?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Bein Ha'arbayim means the middle of the afternoon (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.58a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 58a</a>, Sefaria):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא אמר רבא מצותו דתמיד <strong>משינטו צללי ערב מאי טעמא דאמר קרא בין הערבי' מעידנא דמתחיל שמשא למערב</strong></p>\n<p>Rather, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s source is rejected, and instead Rava said: The mitzva of the daily offering is from when the sun begins to descend westward so that the evening shadows slant eastward, shortly after midday. What is the reason for this? It is because the verse states: <strong>In the afternoon [bein ha’arbayim], which we understand to mean from the time that the sun begins to descend westward [ma’arav].</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bein Hasmashos means the end of the day, and possibly the beginning of night, \"twilight\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.34b.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 34b</a>, Sefaria):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ואיזהו בין השמשות משתשקע החמה כ\"ז שפני מזרח מאדימין</strong> הכסיף התחתון ולא הכסיף העליון בין השמשות הכסיף העליון והשוה לתחתון זהו לילה דברי רבי יהודה ר' נחמיה אומר כדי שיהלך אדם משתשקע החמה חצי מיל רבי יוסי אומר בין השמשות כהרף עין זה נכנס וזה יוצא ואי אפשר לעמוד עליו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless, the definition of twilight is uncertain. <strong>And what is twilight? From when the sun sets, as long as the eastern face of the sky is reddened by the light of the sun.</strong> If the lower segment of the sky has lost its color, and the upper segment has not yet lost its color, that is the twilight period. If the upper segment has lost its color, and its color equals that of the lower one, it is night; this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya says: The duration of the twilight period is the time it takes for a person to walk half a mil after the sun sets. Rabbi Yosei says: Twilight does not last for a quantifiable period of time; rather, it is like the blink of an eye: This, night, enters and that, day, leaves, and it is impossible to calculate it due to its brevity.</p>\n<p>For further details, I would suggest seeing the two Sugyas (which I quoted above) at length.</p>\n\n\n",

Answers to any of the questions above or recommended reading/sources about this topic would be appreciated!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Let's start at the beginning. The Oral Law was not meant to be written down, but for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Torah#Codification\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">various historical reasons</a> the material that was taught in the academies was later collected and edited into the text that we know today as the Mishnah and the Gemara. However, there was no such an extreme stringency with the text that we see for copying a Torah scroll. This resulted that there are minor differences in the various manuscripts.</p>\n\n<p>In a later period the church began to learn Hebrew, and they started to criticise Jews for having certain parts regarding their religion in the Talmud that they considered derogatory and unacceptable. Therefore they initiated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disputation_of_Paris\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mass burnings</a> of Talmud manuscripts mainly from the 13th century. With the advent of the printing press, the church required a written approval from the <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4170-censorship-of-hebrew-books\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">censor</a> that they removed the sensitive parts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bomberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel Bomberg</a> was famous for trying to minimise this intervention of the church, but still, his edition (published between 1519-1523) was not free of censorship. He also made great efforts to consult many different manuscripts in order to filter out scribal errors (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi#Commentary_on_the_Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> had also done similar work in his comments). Although published in the 19th century, the famous Romm edition of Talmud from Vilna - the one that most 20th century editions used - was also censored. If we don't consider the censorship, this edition has very few errors, which was highly appreciated, when books were typeset manually. The history of these editions is discussed in detail in the book <em><a href=\"http://www.jewishhistory.com/PRINTINGTHETALMUD/book.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Printing the Talmud</a>,</em> kindly suggested by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/759/double-aa\">Double AA</a> in comment.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Jerusalem Talmud it is quite clear that <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11869-palestinian-talmud#anchor6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bomberg</a> mainly used the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden_Jerusalem_Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leiden</a> <a href=\"http://www.yerushalmionline.org/manuscripts/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Codex</a> with three other manuscripts. For the Babylonian Talmud there were far more early manuscripts. The censorship mostly had an effect on aggadic material, where a certain person, called Yeshu was involved. After a while scribes tried to find euphemisms to avoid censorship and persecution. These cases are compared in <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8383.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peter Schäfer's book</a>, but a few examples are given also on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_the_Talmud#Text-criticism,_versions,_and_alterations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>. Here you can find reference to many important and high quality manuscripts.</p>\n\n<p>As the power of the church started to decrease in the 19th century, some publications started to list these omissions. There is a shorter one, called <em><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/32457\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chesronot haShas</a>,</em> published in Königsberg in 1860. However, there's a far more detailed work by Rabbi <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12500-rabbinovicz-raphael-nathan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Raphael Rabbinovicz</a>, who found in Munich an uncesored manuscript of Bavli from 1342. He compared <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/86691/chesronot-hashas-sources\">this and other manuscripts</a> with the printed editions and published the multi-volume <em><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/38512\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dikdukei Soferim</a>,</em> an extremely detailed and precise work, which may serve as a basis of <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol18Vaynman.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">similar analysis</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately the scope of the church and the halakhic decisors were quite different, so this censorship had a small effect on our religious laws. In newer editions these <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/35332/talmudic-censorship\">omissions were reinserted</a> as well. Your example is a consequence of a scribal error, and in overall they should have an even smaller effect, as they are random. Personally, I only know one case (whether there should be <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.it/2009/09/how-many-lines-in-haazinu.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">67 or 70 lines in Haazinu</a>), when such and error affected halakhah, but it was in Mishneh Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

See for example the Ahiram Inscription (9th\n  century BC?), where זו zu is even contracted to just ז z and attached\n  to the next word (like Hebrew ש), for example: ארון זֶפּעל אתבעל בן\n  אחירם (Phoenician) = ארון שעשה אתבעל בן אחירם (Hebrew)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, from my understanding of all this, it seem that the best choice would be זאת, since the word טבעת is feminine. <em>Zo</em> is an acceptable substitute. It seems that <em>zu</em> is incorrect in this context.</p>\n\n<p>Note by comparison, in the <em>Hagaddah</em>, the commn language is \"Matza <strong>zu</strong> ...\". And, I think, there that is correct, because the rest of the sentence says שאנו אוכלים ...\"</p>\n\n<p>So, in this context we are saying \"The matzah <strong>that</strong> we are eating...\". While the word <em>zo</em> would probably work in the Hagaddah, too, \"<strong>This</strong> matzah that we eat..\", from the explanation above the term <em>zu</em> seems like a better fit.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus the ban is not on placed on the one who simply reads,\n  which would mean reading in the usual sense, but on the one who\n  meditates. For meditation conveys the sense of something which is\n  veiled or hidden as is demonstrated by the expressions <em>consider my\n  meditation</em> (Ps. 5:2) and <em>May the meditation of my heart be\n  acceptable to You</em> (Ps. 19:15).

He was ill and did not have time for the recipient to acquire the property by pulling. The Sages said to him: One in this situation has no remedy but to transfer them by means of land. What did he do? He went and acquired a beit sela, apparently meaning land the size of a sela coin, near Jerusalem and said: This northern portion of the beit sela is given to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels.

The <em>aron</em> is huge and holds 10 <em>Sifrei Torah</em> arranged on 2 rows. The back row is higher than the front one.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that all the \"older\" shuls that have a multi-row aron have one row higher than the other. I assume that this is mainly for practicality so that you can easily reach a Torah from the back row if you need it. But, I'm curious if there is any halachic prohibition of storing <em>Sifrei Torah</em> in an Aron one directly behind another one?</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, it's not practical. However, I believe that one of the Bobover shuls in Boro park has an \"elevator\" Aron. I.e. the two rows are connected to a chain so that pulling the chain raises or lowers a row (i.e as one ascends, the other descends.) Technically, it is possible for them to have the two rows placed on the same level.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As sam pointed out in a comment, it says in Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.282.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 282:19</a> as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מֻתָּר לְהַנִּיחַ סֵפֶר תּוֹרָה עַל סֵפֶר תּוֹרָה,</strong> וּמַנִּיחִים חֻמָּשִׁים עַל גַּבֵּי נְבִיאִים וּכְתוּבִים, אֲבָל אֵין מַנִּיחִים נְבִיאִים וּכְתוּבִים עַל גַּבֵּי חֻמָּשִׁים, וְלֹא חֻמָּשִׁים עַל גַּבֵּי סֵפֶר תּוֹרָה. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>One is allowed to place a Sefer Torah on top of another Sefer Torah</strong>, and a Chumash on top of Nevi'im and Kesuvim, but we don't place Nevi'im or Kesuvim on top of a Chumash, and not a Chumash On top of a Sefer Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So at least according to the Shulchan Aruch, there is no problem to place them on top of each other, how much more so behind each other.</p>\n\n<p>As for why an old shul might have them on different levels, that might be as you said, to make it easy to remove, or it could also be in order that everyone could see the amount of Sifrei Torah that the shul has.</p>\n\n<p><Hr></p>\n\n<p>To address your comment that reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's possible that there may be a difference between storing it in an Aron and placing one on top of the other while they are \"actively\" used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's a good point, but the Shulchan Aruch doesn't mention that the Sefer Torah has to be used in order to place it on top of another.

For it says, “Hashem is good to all, and\n    His Mercy is on all that He made.” (Tehillim 145 “<em>Ashrei</em>” v. 9). And\n    it says, “[The Torah]’s ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its\n    paths are peace.” (Mishlei 3:14, also said when returning the Torah to\n    the aron)</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>Rav Aharon Lichtinstein zt\"l points out that the Rambam's prooftext\n  for \"darkhei Shalom\" are about (1) imitating G-d, and (2) that the\n  authentic ways of the Torah are to be pleasant and advance peace. It\n  would seem that the common understanding of Darkhei Shalom is wrong.\n  <strong>Rather, we express our concern toward non-Jews for the sake of\n  remaining on the path of peace, because that is Hashem's Path.</strong>\n  (Compare the list of examples the Rambam gives here with the list of\n  kindnesses the Talmud [Sotah 14a] shows us examples in the Torah of\n  Hashem doing.) <strong>Not pragmatics or PC, but a fundamental part of the\n  ideal.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Lichtenstein translated the relevant snippet of a responsum by the\n  Rama (#11) to show that peace in-and-of-itself, without any\n  implications of future danger, is sufficient reason to override some\n  prohibitions:</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>We have learned from here that it is permissible to modify [the truth] for the sake of peace, and it is permissible to violate the\n    injunction, “Thou shalt distance thyself from falsehood.” [The\n    consideration of peace] also overrides the biblical prohibition of\n    “Thou shalt not do thus to the Lord thy God,” which bans the erasure\n    of God’s Name, as is explained in the Sifri to Parashat Re’eh and\n    counted by the Rambam and the Semag in their respective enumerations\n    of the mitsvot. Since this is so, I say that it is also the case that\n    [peace] overrides the prohibition of defamation; in other words, it is\n    permissible to defame another if one’s intention is for the sake of\n    Heaven and for a good cause, [namely,] to promote peace.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>(The above is based on an email from Yeshivat Har Etzion from decades\n  ago that I could not find a copy. However, it is very similar to Rav\n  Aharon Lichstein's article “In The Human and Social Factor in\n  Halakhah”, Tradition 6 (2002) pp. 89-114, made <a href=\"http://www.lookstein.org/articles/human_social_factor.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">available on-line</a>\n  by the Lookstein Center for Jewish Education at Bar Ilan Univ.) </p>\n  \n  <p>A similar idiom that is also commonly understood on pragmatic grounds\n  is \"<em>mishum eivah</em> -- because of enmity\", usually explained as reason\n  to permit something because the enmity likely caused by observing the\n  prohibition may pose a threat. neither idiom is used not used\n  exclusively where there is real risk to life or limb, but that would\n  have to be the meaning of the phrase if it were pragmatic grounds to\n  override Shabbos.  <em>Mishum eiva</em> is applied between father and child\n  on Bava Metzia 12a; on Yuma 12b to the <em>kohein gadol</em>; and on Kesuvos\n  58b, between husband and wife. <strong>So avoiding <em>eivah</em> is a value of some\n  sort detached from the value of saving people from future retaliation.</strong>\n  But we were looking at <em>darkhei Shalom</em> in particular.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is a story in the <em>gemara</em> (Sukkah 53a) where David <em>haMelekh</em>\n  dug deep holes into the ground as part of his preparations for the\n  future building of the <em>Beis haMiqdash</em>. He dug far enough down to hit\n  the <em>tehom</em>, the subterranean water, and the water came up threatening\n  to drown the world. Achitofel wrote the name of G-d on a pot sherd and\n  through it down the hole, thus stopping the water. He reasoned from\n  the law of <em>sotah</em>, where a paragraph of the Torah that includes\n  Hashem’s name is written on a parchment, dissolved in water (along\n  with some dust from under the <em>Beis haMiqdash</em>) and given to a <em>sotah</em>\n  — a married woman accused of adultery who then is found alone with the\n  suspected paramour. Achitofel reasoned that if Hashem’s name may be\n  erased to save one marriage, then of course it may be erased to save\n  the entire world.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>So, <em>darkhei Shalom</em> and <em>mishum eivah</em> are in reality expressions\n  about advancing world peace and global harmony, and as per the above\n  Rambam, imply a responsibility of Jews toward the welfare of non-Jews.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Unfortunately, none of them brings the standard commentaries. What I miss most are the sources the Rambam uses for his various rulings. As is well known, the Rambam himself doesn't bring sources but those are incredibly useful to understand the why. For instance when the Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Marriage.3.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> a father is allowed to but shouldn't marry his underage girl, it would be helpful to know this comes straight from the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.41a.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 41a</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What are recommendations on editions of the Mishne Torah which bring those sources?</strong> Ideally they should come with a clear and recently printed text, as little Rashi script as possible, abbreviations spelled out and a reasonable price (200-250$ would be an ideal range).</p>\n<p>Mosad Harav Kook's <a href=\"https://www.mosadharavkook.com/shop/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%9D-%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%9D/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam LeAm</a> might be such an option and your opinion of it would be most welcome.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I think the Frankel Rambam contains what you are looking for. It has the standard commentaries on the page, such as Maggid Mishnah, Kessef Mishneh, Radvaz, Lechem Mishneh, Migdal Oz, Rabbeinu Manoach, etc.  It also has a section in the back where it lists dozens of other commentaries that speak about each individual halacha. </p>\n\n<p>The text is very clear, and it provides textual variants as well. You can get the entire new set (17 volumes or so) in the small size for $300 - $350. </p>\n\n<p>If that is too expensive, they also have a cheaper set that does not have the additional material in the back, but still has the standard commentaries on the page, in a few volumes. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, they sell the volumes individually as well, if you don't want to spend so much money at once. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The standard edition, out of copyright and republished by many publishers over the years, sounds like what you want. It's got <em>Raavad</em>,  <em>Kesef Mishne</em>, <em>Magid Mishne</em>, <em>Lechem Mishne</em>, <em>Hagahos Maymaniyos</em>, and more. In particular, it has <em>Migdal Oz</em>, which cites the <em>Mishne Tora</em>'s sources. Because this edition has been published by so many, I can't recommend a publisher, but if you ask a Jewish bookseller for the standard old-fashioned <em>Mishne Tora</em>, you'll probably get it. It's also (I'm guessing) the cheapest edition with commentaries on the market. A downside is that the print is not as crisp as some newer editions'. And another thing to note (and you may consider it a downside) is that it has the text that everyone had for years, which had been censored to avoid insulting Christianity too much, rather than a more original text that some newer editions have. <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qyene.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here's a picture of a page.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chazak.co.il/product/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%9D/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> edition is specially made for Chabad program. It contains a lot of bibliographic references. But the font is very small,  it's tiresome to read for hours small letters. It's better than mifal Mishne Tora because of the wide mare mekomot, Raavad is not skipped, for travel it's good. To skip the Raavad is a pity, because notes of Raavad on Rambam are very short and show the reading of this big genius.</p>\n\n<p>There is a pocket version of Eshkol edition, which is also vowelized, and easy to read with a beautiful font, as all Eshkol books. This edition contains Magid Mishne, the most important comment, the \"Bartenura of Rambam\", the most pleasurable reading which gives us sources of Rambam in a marvelous Hebrew style. This comment upgrades lecture and lector. IMHO this kind of edition is the best.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mishnetorah.co.il/light-edition/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> pocket edition (מפעל משנה תורה) is not beautiful but the text follows manuscripts, but there is missing Raavad notes and Magid Mishne comment.

The improvement is effective only if it is the result of additional baking. For example, if bread had a light color and a thin crust, and re-baking the bread will make it darker and give it a thicker crust, this improvement will render the bread Pas Yisroel. Similarly, Rabbi Belsky, zt”l held that if a Jew toasts bread or bagels to enhance the taste, this will effect a Pas Yisrael status. This is also the position of Rav Sternbuch (Teshuvos V’hanhagos I: 444).</p>\n  \n  <p>In contrast, Sefer Issur V’heter Ha’Aruch(43:11) writes that heating cold bread to make it fresh does not make the bread Pas Yisroel since there is no change in the degree of baking</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There are two possible solutions: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the stuff is owned by the company at all times.</li>\n<li>the stuff is owned by the company as long as it is usable, and when declared unusable it is considered abandoned.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>The answer about stealing fits the first scenario but not the second (see the clarification below). The second scenario can be regarded generally as \"אבידה מדעת\" or \"הפקר\". It can be also divided into two sub-scenarios:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the stuff is explicitly declared as waste by the management</li>\n<li>the stuff is unanimously considered as waste without the management's confirmation.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Once the stuff is declared as waste by the management it surely bears the status of \"אבידה מדעת\" and can be taken without their specific permission on every item.</p></li>\n<li><p>Once the stuff is declared not usable but is not officially declared as abandoned, but everybody knows that it is - that's the tricky situation. This is similar to what the Gemmoarah discusses in BM: the questionable property such as fruits of a tree that fall outside the fence - are they still considered their owner's or אבידה מדעת.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are different approaches to resolving such a situation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>consult the local laws (דינא דמלכותא) including the corporate's internal regulations - will you be incriminated for such behavior - if yes, it's wrong with the Torah also.</li>\n<li>take it to yourself and wait until claimed. It's not a steal if you claim it was abandoned, so the other party must prove otherwise.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Clarification on stealing (גניבה or גזל): It has two parts: the monetary (בין אדם לחבירו) which is a subject to repay and ethical (בין אדם למקום) which is the wrongful thought of stealing. So theoretically one who takes something legal (postfactum) but fells that's a steal also transgresses this commandment. On the other hand, if he takes it rightfully but he's proven that the item was not הפקר, he only transgresses the first part בשוגג and postfactum.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><sub>The fineprint: the last distinction applies to non-J, גזל גוי is forbidden only because of the second part, as it \"deforms the Jewish soul\", but the monetary part is forgiven, כמו אחד שלוח מקל מכלב.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

He says that Pirkei Avot is just an utterance, an amirah –\n  something we recite as opposed to something we analyze. He also says\n  (in his Mishnah Berurah commentary) that since many people come to\n  shul on Shabbat afternoon and engage in idle conversation, it is\n  beneficial for people to listen to words of reproof that will cause them\n  to refrain from such idle conversations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One explanation is that it was a response to Islamic historical accounts of transmission of tradition.

Zunz</a> reports on good\n  authority that the reading of Abot was customary in Arabic countries\n  at least as early as the 9th Century and became an established\n  practice in the 11th Century. <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/sar-shalom-ben-boaz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sar Shalom</a> relates that the reading of\n  Abot on Sabbath after Minha was a customary practice in Baghdad or\n  Sura. Both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amram_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amram</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Saadia</a> include in their respective <em>Siddurim</em> the\n  practice of reading Abot after Minha-service on Sabbath. Thus we see\n  that the reading of Abot originated in the geonic period in an Islamic\n  environment. <strong>Since, as we have shown, the <em>Hadiths</em> i.e., the\n  historical stratum were most probably added to Abot in geonic times,\n  there can be little doubt as to the true reason for its inclusion as a\n  part of the regular service. Other explanations given in various\n  literatures are conjectures or aggadot, i.e., weak attempts to explain\n  an extraordinary addition to the service.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A somewhat similar explanation is that reading Pirkei Avos on Shabbos afternoon is a statement of anti-Karaism. In <a href=\"http://www.oqimta.org.il/oqimta/5776/adams4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Development of a Waiting Period\nBetween Meat and Dairy:\n9th – 14th Centuries\"</a> (p. 4) Steven H. Adams writes as follows, with my emphasis:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even many <em>minhagim</em> extant today were arguably initiated as a response\n  to the Karaite movement. For example, many historians agree that the\n  recital of the 3rd chapter from <em>Mishnat Shabbat</em>, “<em>Bamme Madlikin</em>,” on\n  Friday evenings following the prayer service was introduced during the\n  time of the geonim with the intent of reinforcing the rabbinic stance\n  on having fire prepared before Shabbat, in opposition to the Karaite\n  view that no fire may be present in one’s home on Shabbat.  <strong>Similar\n  arguments have been made for the origins of the custom of reading\n  <em>Pirkei Avot</em>, the introduction of which traces rabbinic teachings to\n  Sinai, on Shabbat afternoons.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The footnote to the last sentence states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wieder, <em>Jewish Liturgy</em>, p. 350; compare Alexander Guttman, “Tractate\n  Abot: Its Place in Rabbinic Literature,” <em>JQR</em> 41 (1950), pp. 190-193,\n  who argues that the rabbinic chain of tradition in Avot was a late\n  stratum added under the influence of hadıth scholarship. His arguments\n  do not preclude the existence of anti-Karaite intentions behind Amram\n  b. Sheshna and Saadya’s inclusion of this portion of\n  <em>Avot</em> in their liturgies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for why, according to these reasons, the custom would be specifically on Shabbos afternoon and during a specific time of year, I would guess that those details are incidental to the actual reason. That is to say that it is probably simply something like Shabbos afternoons in the summer months are a particularly convenient time to read Pirkei Avos. As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> wrote in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 3:26 about details of mitzvos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those who trouble themselves to find a cause for any of these detailed\n  rules, are in my eyes void of sense: they do not remove any\n  difficulties, but rather increase them. Those who believe that these\n  detailed rules originate in a certain cause, are as far from the truth\n  as those who assume that the whole law is useless. You must know that\n  Divine Wisdom demanded it--or, if you prefer, say that circumstances\n  made it necessary--that there should be parts [of His work] which have\n  no certain object: and as regards the Law, it appears to be impossible\n  that it should not include some matter of this kind.

Thus, most of this Masechta focuses on the passion for learning Torah and doing mitzvos. Moreover, this is the time of the harvest which is a time when people follow their desires and pleasures. Therefore, in order to calm our passion and straighten our focus, we learn this Masechta of Avos filled with Mussar to evoke greater levels of self-control and humility, as we ask Hashem to protect us from straying after our physical passion during this time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the Abudraham writes this time of physical passion specifically between Pesach and Shavuos, it's not a stretch to consider the entire summer months until Rosh Hashana as being a time when we would especially need the clear perspective which Avos provides. Certainly it is worthwhile all year round, but we need it most during the summer months when so many of the physical restrictions and inhibitions naturally imposed during the winter are lifted.</p>\n\n\n",

He proceeds to bring many sources to defend\n  his opinion, one of which is based on the Gemara in Masechet Beitzah\n  (25b) which states that one may not go out in a chair on Shabbat. This\n  refers to the custom of an important figure sitting in a chair and\n  being carried around by people to his destination of choice (as is\n  common in some lands in the Far East even today). Our Sages prohibited\n  this practice on Shabbat, for this is not respectful to the Shabbat as\n  this is considered a weekday mode of travel. Maran Shlit”a brings\n  other reasons to be stringent as well. \n   >   \n   > Thus, halachically speaking, one should not be lenient to ride a\n  bicycle on Shabbat; even if one is doing so for the purpose of\n  performing a Mitzvah, one should still act stringently regarding this\n  matter. We shall, G-d-willing, discuss the laws regarding\n  bicycle-riding for children in the Halacha that will be published on\n  Thursday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there any permissible way to put cooked dry food into an oven on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know that this seems like a very generalized question. But, perhaps, someone can help me understand something.</p>\n\n<p>I've viewed a number of online sites regarding whether one is allowed to rewarm dry / solid completely cooked food into an oven on Shabbat morning after it has been in the fridge. I checked OU, CRC, BVK articles on this topic. There is not one that seems to allow doing this. They all state that one can use a \"warming drawer\" if it is lined with foil and the nobs are covered.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, I know a number of religious \"black hat\" Orthodox families that have been reheating cold food in ovens for years.</p>\n\n<p>Am I missing some leniency or method here, or have they been ignorant and doing things wrong?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>One reason we are not allowed to \"return\" a cooked food (in a pot) to the fire on Shabbos is that it \"looks like\" you are cooking. (\"mechzei c'mevashel\"). This makes it forbidden D'Rabbanan. </p>\n\n<p>However, D'Oraisa (Biblically) once a food has been completely cooked, it cannot be cooked again (ain bishul achar bishul) unless it is a liquid that has completely cooled down. </p>\n\n<p>We can place a \"blech\" (simple sheet of metal to cover/retard the flame) on a stove top burner, before Shabbos. This causes two things to happen:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Putting fully cooked food on such a blech, no longer \"looks like\" cooking, because no one usually wants to cook on top of a retarded flame.</p></li>\n<li><p>A blech is viewed by the Chazon Ish as one sheet of flame. However, other poskim accept the concept that a blech on a stovetop has zones (on the fire, yad soledes, not yad soledes ). One ramification is that putting food on a merely \"warm\" spot can help heat up the food but still be distant from questions of cooking.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The oven however runs into potential problems that the stove top doesn't have to deal with.</p>\n\n<p>1.) Although there is no bishul after bishul, there can be baking after bishul. If a type of cooking is different from how the food was prepared the first time, it may be considered cooking anew on Shabbos. Ovens bake. Pots on a stove cook. So putting dry solids that were boiled in a pot within an oven, would raise the idea that they are being \"baked\" for the first time on Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>2.) Many try to avoid opening an oven door on Shabbos if it will directly affect the thermostat and cause an increase in fuel consumption to automatically turn up the heat to compensate for the new cold air rushing in. Similar to opening a fridge on shabbos, this question is a subject of dispute between R' Moshe Feinstein Z\"tzl and R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach Z\"tzl. R' Moshe is machmir since the new air is \"your force\" while R' S.Z. holds that you merely removed a shield and the air flow is not \"your force\".</p>\n\n<p>3.) Everywhere within a modern hot oven, is one uniform temperature, and the flame is not retarded by a blech. Therefore, using the oven in a regular manner, always \"looks like\" cooking.</p>\n\n<p>In ancient times, a blech was possible within an oven by scraping out the coals and sprinkling ashes over the flame. Nowadays, there is no such thing.</p>\n\n<p>4.) Sometimes, you can cause a modern oven's lights to turn on when you open the door.</p>\n\n<p>That also explains why the authorities quoted by the OP says: \"that one can use a \"warming drawer\" if it is lined with foil and the nobs are covered.\"</p>\n\n<p>The lining and knob covering, create a \"blech\" for the warmer's heat source within. Not everyone holds you need to cover knobs or gas range dials. The lining is the main thing since that is what retards the flame and makes it not the normal way of heating food. The knob cover is an added reminder not to play with the heat levels on Shabbos. However, once one has \"removed their mind\" from the fire by covering the heat, the knobs should not matter according to the lenient ones.</p>\n\n<p>So probably, a way to use the oven on Shabbos would be to take dry solid baked chicken, rely on R' Shlomo Zalman to open the door, and/or use a type of modern oven that has a Shabbos friendly thermostat, and electric lighting program, and somehow create an insert within the oven that you can place food into, which seems to block the heat from fully penetrating the insert.</p>\n\n<p>If you can do all of that.... it seems OK. </p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To quote from R. Ribiat’s The 39 Melochos Vol. II pp. 612-613:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If an oven insert is being used, the pot or pan of food may even be <em>returned</em> to the oven, because an insert is a proper blech upon which Chazara can be permitted (pursuant to certain conditions). Therefore, the pot of fully cooked food may be returned if it was constantly held, and was removed with the intention of returning it.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, if an insert is not being used, the food (even if fully cooked) may not be returned to the oven once it was removed, as this would give the distinct appearance of initiating cooking (Mechzi K’mevashel).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

My older Brother was hoping to be called for the first Aliyah and wanted to honor me with either the 4th or 7th one.  The Rabbi at the shul however says that only one Kohen is to be allowed. I understand that this can be an Ashkinazi tradition but am curious how common this is. Is it true that other Ashkenazi Rabbis would allow a second Kohen just as long as two Kohens aren't called back to back, or is that a Sephardic tradition.

However, its compilation and its style of of codification, most notably being without sources raises with it a large amount of issues, as many commentators had no idea where the Rambam derived his conclusion. This led to a myriad of interpretations, and divergent opinions being quoted. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore the Rambam largely ignored other opinions (most notably the French Tosafists), as was his right for obvious reasons. But from a halachic perspective this would leave the sugya (topic) severely lacking.</p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishneh_Torah?wprov=sfti1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Maimonides intended to provide a complete statement of the Oral Law,\n  so that a person who mastered first the Written Torah and then the\n  Mishneh Torah would be in no need of any other book. Contemporary\n  reaction was mixed, with strong and immediate opposition focusing on\n  the absence of sources and the belief that the work appeared to be\n  intended to supersede study of the Talmud. Maimonides responded to\n  these criticisms, and the Mishneh Torah endures as an influential work\n  in Jewish religious thought. According to several authorities,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arba'ah_Turim?wprov=sfti1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a> a\n  decision may not be rendered in opposition to a view of Maimonides,\n  even where he apparently militated against the sense of a Talmudic\n  passage, for in such cases the presumption was that the words of the\n  Talmud were incorrectly interpreted. Likewise: \"One must follow\n  Maimonides even when the latter opposed his teachers, since he surely\n  knew their views, and if he decided against them he must have\n  disapproved their interpretation.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus enters the Shulchan Aruch, or prior to that the Tur Shulchan Aruch which was an attempt to blend the learning styles of the Rif (who lived before the Rambam), his father the Rosh (who lived in both among the Ashkenazim and the Spanish Sefardim) and the Baalei Hatosfos, the Ashkenazi commentaries on the Talmud</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arba'ah_Turim?wprov=sfti1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> explains this quite well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the Arba'ah Turim, Rabbi Jacob traces the practical Jewish law from\n  the Torah text and the dicta of the Talmud through the Rishonim. He\n  used the code of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi as his starting point; these views\n  are then compared to those of Maimonides, as well as to the Ashkenazi\n  traditions contained in the Tosafist literature. Unlike Maimonides'\n  Mishneh Torah, the Tur is not limited to normative positions, but\n  compares the various opinions on any disputed point. (In most\n  instances of debate, Rabbi Jacob follows the opinion of his father,\n  Rabbi Asher ben Jehiel, the Rosh.) The Arba'ah Turim also differs from\n  the Mishneh Torah, in that, unlike Maimonides' work, it deals only\n  with areas of Jewish law that are applicable in the Jewish exile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A further difference is that the Rambam dealt with laws that didn’t apply in the Jewish exile, but the Tur was limited only to laws applicable B’zman Hazeh (as with the rest of the works explained below)</p>\n\n<p>The most prominent commentary on this work, the Tur Shulchan Aruch, is the magnum opus of Rav Yosef Karo, known as the Beis Yosef, which attempts to review all the relevant material and come to a final conclusion, something that the Tur Shulchan Aruch did not always do.</p>\n\n<p>However the Beis Yosef was a long, running commentary that was very hard to fully digest, especially if it was meant to come to a final practical conclusion. Therefore, Rav Yosef Karo authored the Shulchan Aruch, as we know it today, which is a summation of the Beis Yosef. This has been accepted as the defacto halachic work, and all halacha that is decided today uses it as a jumping off point.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna Berurah, compiled by the Chofetz Chaim, his son and his students, is considered by many (most prominently, Rav Ahron Kotler zt”l and the Chazon Ish zt”l) as the posek acharon (final halachic decisor) for our generation, and thus binding on everyone (or at least Bnei Ashkenaz). Famously Rav Moshe Feinstein and Rav Yosef Eliyahu Henkin disgareed and held that it was the Aruch Hashulchan. But even they agreed that the Mishna Berurah decisions needed to be reckoned with and not easily ignored or disgarded. The Mishna Berurah, like most modern day halachic works, attempts to apply the decisions of the Shulchan Aruch to modern day situations. For the Chofetz Chaim was a rare figure that has been accepted as a Tzaddik and a Scholar by literally all the Jewish People.</p>\n\n<p>The Peninei Halacha, authored by a modern-day Rabbi - Rav Eliezer Melamed, is a compilation of halachos, including summaries, but also features modern day questions that were not discussed in the Shulchan aruch itself, but applies the Shulchan aruch, and other sources as well to these new questions.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rav Melamed, recognized as a Talmid Chacham, is not a widely accepted authority that his halachic decisions are considered binding (as opposed to the Shulchan Aruch). However, if you consider him to be your Rav, that is your choice, just as someone may accept upon himself the psakim of Rav Ovadia, or Rav Shlomo Zalman (though they both are greatly more accepted among a larger swath of the Jewish people than Rav Melamed). Obviously this means that you may not pick and choose when to follow his opinions or not. As once you have accepted him as your authority it is binding. (This is admittedly not a simple issue, consult your local Rav)</p>\n\n\n",

Is “Davidic lineage” a status just like Kohanim which is lost after intermarriage, never to be regained even if the progeny converts? If so, what are the sources for that?</p>\n\n<p>If the answer is no, then in identifying a potential Moshiach one would have to prove that there isn’t even a single instance of intermarriage through the paternal line going back to King David. In other words: if a direct patrilineal descendant from King David marries a non-Jewish woman, and then their son converts and rejoins the Jewish people (which is not unheard of) then none of his direct patrilineal offspring could ever be considered to be a potential Moshiach. Over many generations this could mean a tremendous amount of people. I admittedly don’t know much about it, but are Jews really that sure that there were no such instances through their patrilineal lines? I guess families with Kohanim status might keep really strict genealogical records, but I imagine most Jews certainly don’t.</p>\n\n<p>I do not intend to offend anyone or start any kind of trouble; I’m not even a Jew myself. So forgive me for my ignorance if you perceive it as such. I’m just curious as to how it works, considering so many Jews are sincerely expecting the arrival of Moshiach.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The converted child cannot potentially be Moshiach because he is not an inheriting son from the biological father. He is considered descended from the gentile mother and not <em>from Israel</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Kingship, including the kingship of the house of David is a hereditary possession. Like is found in Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 1:7 which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומאחר שמושחין המלך הרי זה זוכה לו ולבניו עד עולם. <strong>שהמלכות ירשה</strong> שנאמר (דברים יז כ) \"למען יאריך ימים על ממלכתו הוא ובניו בקרב ישראל\". <strong>הניח בן קטן משמרין לו המלוכה עד שיגדיל.</strong> כמו שעשה יהוידע ליואש. <strong>וכל הקודם בנחלה קדם לירשת המלוכה.</strong> והבן הגדול קודם לקטן ממנו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Mishnah Torah, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Inheritances.1.2?lang=bi&with=Maggid%20Mishneh&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Laws of Inheritance, chapter 1, laws 1 and 3</a> it establishes the principle of inheritance.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפיכך אין לך <strong>אדם מישראל</strong> שאין לו יורשין:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Maggid Mishneh to this Rambam points to the last chapter of <em>HaGozel</em> (there are 3 chapters) in Tractate Bava Kama as the source.</p>\n\n<p>The idea here is that <em>all legally valid heirs</em> inherit from such a person.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that a child born from a non-Jewish mother and a Jewish father is not a legally valid heir is mentioned explicitly in the Laws of Inheritance 1:7 which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל הַקְּרוֹבִין בַּעֲבֵרָה יוֹרְשִׁין כִּכְשֵׁרִים. כֵּיצַד. כְּגוֹן שֶׁהָיָה לוֹ בֵּן מַמְזֵר אוֹ אָח מַמְזֵר הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ כִּשְׁאָר בָּנִים וְכִשְׁאָר אַחִים לַנַּחֲלָה. <strong>אֲבָל בְּנוֹ מִן הַשִּׁפְחָה אוֹ מִן הַנָּכְרִית אֵינוֹ בֵּן לְדָבָר מִן הַדְּבָרִים וְאֵינוֹ יוֹרֵשׁ כְּלָל</strong>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This subject as it relates to the Kingship of Israel in the land of Israel, like the Kingship of the house of David, is also brought from Metzudat David to Daniel 3:1:1 which specifically states that the gentiles will not inherit the <em>Malucha</em> (Kingship).</p>\n\n<p>And the last source to consider on this is what is stated explicitly in regard to the throne of Kingship of <em>Malchut Beit David</em> which is one of the three blessings made at the conclusion of the reading of the haftorah each Shabbat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמחנו...באליהו הנביא עבדך <strong>ובמלכות בית דוד משיחך</strong>. במהרה יבוא ויגל לבנו. <strong>על כסאו לא ישב זר ולא ינחלו עוד אחרים את כבודו</strong>. כי בשם קדשך נשבעת לו שלא יכבה נרו לעולם ועד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Zar</em> is referring to gentiles. <em>Ode acherim</em> (additional others <em>who are excluded</em>) is a category which would include the type of Jewish convert that you describe in your question. And this is in keeping with the halacha brought by Rambam in Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 1:4 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אין מעמידין מלך מקהל גרים אפלו אחר כמה דורות</strong> <em>עד שתהיה אמו מישראל</em>. שנאמר (דברים יז טו) \"לא תוכל לתת עליך איש נכרי אשר לא אחיך הוא\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It can’t mean that because the Mishnah Brurah himself says that you can count the volume of a sponge-cake as is).

Or one could argue that the weekly <a href=\"https://www.ouisrael.org/torah-tidbits/the-holiest-day-of-the-year/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sabbath is the holiest day</a>, since it has the most Torah readings and the severest penalties for its violation. <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday3.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana and Yom Kipur</a> each certainly have unique importance and solemnity, and deservedly get a great deal of attention in the Jewish world, but they don't necessarily outrank everything else.</p>\n<p>It's pretty clear that Judaism doesn't have a single observance that truly rises above all others in importance.

And are you obligated to walk away from the area if someone approaches you (and therefore away from the automatic light)?</p>\n\n<p>My intuition would be that it's forbidden to walk up to someone standing underneath it, since this would be turning it on, but you wouldn't be obligated to walk away from it if you were underneath such a light (whilst it is off) and someone was approaching you, since you wouldn't be the one turning it on. Although that then begs the question can you then walk away if the light is on, since that would turn it off.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Assuming the person walking is Jewish, that the light always turns on and that the person walking benefits from its light, then it is forbidden to walk towards it intentionally. This is called <em>psik reisha</em>, i.e., something that you know will happen, and it is forbidden when done intentionally.</p>\n\n<p>R Eliezer Melamed writes in Peninei Halacha</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>One may not enter a room where doing so automatically turns on the\n  lights or air conditioning.</strong> While one might claim that he did not\n  intend to turn on the lights or air conditioning by entering the room,\n  the fact is that everyone knows how the system works in such places.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the person doesn't care for the light (e.g., a streetlamp that adds light to a path you want to walk on during Shabbat, but you would have walked there anyway), then it becomes <em>psik reisha de lo nichalei</em> (an expected event you don't want) and many are lenient. R Melamed continues</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What if the hotel guest is inside such a room when Shabbat begins, and\n  he knows that if he leaves he will cause the lights or air\n  conditioning to shut off? If he can easily stay inside until after\n  Shabbat, or if a non-Jew is due to come shortly to disable the system,\n  it is preferable to wait inside. However, if doing so causes him\n  anguish, he may leave the room or bathroom because the purpose of this\n  system is to save the hotel money by conserving electricity. The hotel\n  guest does not care about that, so it is a case of psik reisha de-lo\n  niĥa lei regarding a rabbinic prohibition (since all agree that the\n  prohibition of turning off the lights or air conditioning is\n  rabbinic). When necessary, in such a case, one may be lenient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do not see however why someone would have to walk away from the area. It would be a good idea to call out to the second person she cannot walk there (<em>do not place a stumbling block in front of the blind</em>) but staying there is not forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, should this become a real scenario, <a href=\"http://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9146\">ask a rav</a> and don't trust Internet strangers.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the source for writing names of Haman's sons in a separate column?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the source for writing names of Haman's sons in a separate column? We see that most megillos are written this way, but where can I find halacha? Shulchan Aruch doesn't seem to be discussing it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Talmud Yerushalmi (Megillah 3:7) says about the list that the word איש should be at the \"head\" of the column and ואת should be at the \"end\" of it. Some versions (see Masekhet Sofrim 13:6) also mention that עשרת should be at the \"end\" of the column. The remarks about איש and עשרת are important because we may have thought the song structure didn't include those words and, for example, the last line could read ויזתא עשרת בני המן בן without any gaps.</p>\n\n<p>Now it's clear from the fact that every ואת [and עשרת] can't all be at the bottom of the column that either \"דפא -- column\" here means row, or that \"head\" and \"end\" mean the right and left sides respectively. Many Rishonim note this explicitly (Haghot Maymoniot Megillah 2:12 quoting Ri and Maharam, Haghot Ashiri Megillah 1:9, Or Zarua 373, Semag Asin Derabanan 4, Raavyah 253 in the name of the Bahag, Beit Yosef 691, and more). This is the practice in ancient Esther manuscripts.</p>\n\n<p>The practice of writing the names in their own column is a \"stringency\" so that איש can literally be at the top of the column and עשרת can be at the literal bottom. This practice presents a number of Halakhic problems in terms of spacing and font sizes (eg. Beiur HaGra OC 691), but it remains quite popular (see the valiant defense of the Nishmat Adam 155). The Vilna Gaon, 3rd Lubavitcher Rebbe, Chatam Sofer, Aruch leNer and others did not write the sons of Haman in a separate column.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest source I'm aware of that mentions matching the top or bottom of the column is the Orchot Chayim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40307&st=&pgnum=276&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Megillah 17</a>) who mentions \"some\" who put עשרת at the bottom of the column because of קבלה (tradition?). (It seems from his wording that he views this as an alternative to what he viewed as the \"mainstream\" tradition of placing איש at the top of the column, not that he advocated doing both and stretching the letters (cf. his comments in 18 about stretching the letter ו in ויזתא).)</p>\n\n<p>The source that most gets quoted through in the Acharonim is the Keneset HaGedolah (OC 691) who develops a theory that while the above proof shows that ואת needs only to be at the end of the row, the extra claim of עשרת at the end of the column found in Masekhet Soferim is to be taken as the bottom of the column not the end of the row. He thus ruled that we should be stringent not to read from a Megillah where עשרת is not at the bottom of the column, even though the Tur doesn't even mention that extra claim regarding עשרת, since many Rishonim (including many of those listed above as explaining \"end\" as \"left side\") did mention the extra claim of עשרת at the end. He argues that the Tur must not have seen Masekhet Sofrim's expanded version and he definitely would have ruled like it if had. Many didn't find this convincing (Beit Ephraim OC 70, Chatam Sofer OC 190, Ginat Veradim 4:12). Even the Keneset HaGedolah agreed that if you already read from a scroll that didn't have עשרת at the bottom of the column that you don't need to read it again.</p>\n\n<p>The only Rishon I'm aware of who explicitly indicates that איש must be at the top of the column and עשרת at the bottom is the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99_%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Piskei Tosfot</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37957&st=&pgnum=469\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Megillah #30</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the Kovetz Migdal Dovid (Lubavitch) has a nice section on this whole inyan.

When did that happen, and why was that change made?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, it's true, once upon a time in ancient times Torah Scrolls were brought into synagogues, and were not there initially. This is due to several reasons. Many early synagogues arose in exile, located in ordinary residential buildings. People simply gathered to study or read the Torah in public.\nAron HaKodesh is a relatively new phenomenon. They appeared about 2000 years ago, approximately. And the fact that it was presented in different ways everywhere. In some communities, Aron HaKodesh was a box on wheels that was \"imported\" into the synagogue or traveled with it.\nFor the synagogue, the most important thing is first of all the Bimah. It is much older, this element of the synagogue was introduced by Ezra Soifer during the Babylonian Captivity.\nThe reason for the changes associated with the appearance of Aron HaKodesh in the synagogue is the emergence of Minhagim in Galut conditions. Communities, for the most part, are free to choose the type and structure of their synagogues on their own.\nOnce upon a time, the location of Aron HaKodesh was not important at all, he could be anywhere. And nowadays its location and direction serve us as the direction of prayer: towards Eretz Israel, towards Jerusalem, towards Kodesh Hakodashim.\nTimes are passing, new customs are emerging, traditions are being formed, this is normal. A lot has changed in Galut over 2000 years. This is changing even nowadays...</p>\n\n\n",

The real debate is whether the relationships between the Jews and Shabbos and Torah is more like property or like marriage. But in either case, the connection to the Jewish People is considered similar enough to something already prohibited to be included in that umbrella.</p>\n\n<p>Which touches on a more fundamental point; the 7 mitzvos are pretty broad. There are counts of 30 (Chullin 92) or 66 mitzvos that are described as subcategories of the 7. The count of 30 is explained this way by the (Rama miFano, Asarah Maamaros, Ma'amo Chaqor Din 3:21), saying that this position is not in dispute with the more usually cited 7, just giving more detail. Whereas Rav Aharon Lichtenstein (\"The Seven Laws of Noah\") only justifies his giving a longer list by stating that he is expounding on the standard 7.</p>\n\n<p>An example of the breadth of each Noachide mitzvah. Abortion is prohibited to both Jews and non-Jews. However, it is not punishable when performed by a Jew. And for that matter, the Rambam distinguishes between cases where it would be permitted to abort a moment before birth, and prohibited to commit infanticide a moment after. (Hilkhos Rotzeiakh 1:9) In the opinion of many (most?) recent and contemporary decisors, abortion is not murder as the law is defined by Jews; it's another prohibition -- perhaps injury to the mother, or a more extreme form of the prohibition against masturbation (as both prevent a future person), yet more debate. But all agree that abortion is murder as defined in the Noachide Laws. \"Murder\" is an umbrella term that includes numerous prohibitions if counted the way the Jewish 613 were counted.</p>\n\n\n",

This does not seem to match any of the exceptions listed in Tikun Simanim.</p>\n\n<p>Why then does it not apply here?</p>\n\n<p>(23:4 has a <em>tipcha</em> which is disjunctive on מקראי so you wouldn't expect it to be <em>nasog achor</em>.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֵ֚לֶּה מוֹעֲדֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה מִקְרָאֵ֖י קֹ֑דֶשׁ אֲשֶׁר־תִּקְרְא֥וּ אֹתָ֖ם בְּמוֹעֲדָֽם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm sure there are other cases where you would expect <em>nasog achor</em> and it isn't there, but i'm asking about this specifically because i feel like i have seen these words with <em>nasog achor</em> somewhere, but i can't find it right now.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%92_%D7%90%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A8_(%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">its Wikipedia</a> page, Nasog Achor is not an absolute rule, and there are great numbers of exceptions that do not follow any rules that would exclude them (see the page for examples):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נסוג אחור אינו כלל חובה ולעיתים נראה כי בעלי המסורה קבעו אותו באופן שרירותי למדי. כמעט בכל עמוד בתנך מודפס ימצאו מקרים שהיו ראויים לקבל נסוג אחור - ואין.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would be one of them, I guess.</p>\n\n\n",

First, on the matter of the premise of the question.</p>\n<p>Is Onkelos from Sinai? I don't know about you, but I don't see any indication from the gemarra in Megillah 3a that it is. As you pointed out, all the gemarra indicates is that they had Targum at the time of Ezra. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Kasher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Menachem Mendel Kasher</a>, in his Torah Sheleimah Volume 24 is entirely devoted to the Targumim, and in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51493&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 1</a> he brings many sources which he feels proves that Ezra and the other Neviim of his time wrote the Targum.</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51493&pgnum=21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end</a> of chapter 1, and in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51490&pgnum=325\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Miluim</a> to Torah Sheleimah 17, he addresses the sources which say that Onkelos is from Sinai. Most of them quote a Semag, which is quoting from Seder Rav Amram Gaon. He brings the original text and shows that there is no mention of Targum from Sinai. He wonders if the Semag held it himself, or was attributing this belief to the Geonim. He eventually tries to bring support for the Semag and other sources.</p>\n<p>He also brings the Rashi you wrote. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51490&pgnum=327\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He feels</a> that if we examine Rashi's language carefully, it's possible to say he means something else.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואונקלוס <strong>כשהוסיף</strong> לא מדעתו הוסיף שהרי בסיני ניתן</p>\n<p>Onkelos, <strong>when he added [to the Torah]</strong>, it wasn't from himself, since it was given at Sinai</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Rashi meant like what we thought he did, he should have just said \"All of Onkelos is from Sinai\". Why add, \"Onkelos when he added to the Torah\". Rather, Rashi could mean that there are two parts to the Targum: 1) the literal Aramaic translation. This could have been done later, and Torah Sheleimah feels he has sources that it was Ezra and the other Neviim. 2) The additional parts, not the literal translations, which are from the Torah SheBaal Peh. These, like any other part of the Torah SheBaal Peh, can have machlokes. Onkelos received these additions he from his teachers, who received it from theirs, all the way back to Sinai. This is what it means, his Torah SheBaal Peh had a mesorah. He brings other supports for this interpretation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In any event <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51490&pgnum=329\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">he concludes</a> by asking your question. He points out that many times Rishonim actually <strong>argue</strong> on Onkelos.</p>\n<p>Exodus 22:2, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.22.2.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שלם ישלם. הַגַּנָּב מָמוֹן שֶׁגָּנַב וְאֵינוֹ חַיָּב מִיתָה; וְאוּנְקְלוּס שֶׁתִּרְגֵּם אִם עֵינָא דְּסַהֲדַיָּא נְפָלַת עֲלוֹהִי, לָקַח לוֹ שִׁטָּה אַחֶרֶת</p>\n<p>שלם ישלם means the thief shall only restore the money he has stolen but is not subject to the death penalty. Onkelos who renders אם זרחה השמש עליו by, “If the eye of witnesses fall upon him” chose a different way of explaining the verse</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Exodus 23:2, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.23.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...וְאוּנְקְלוּס תִּרְגֵּם...וַאֲנִי אוֹמֵר</p>\n<p>...Onkelos translates...but I say</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Deuteronomy 12:30, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.12.30.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi speaks</a> harshly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פן תנקש. אוּנְקְלוֹס תִּרְגֵּם לְשׁוֹן מוֹקֵשׁ, וַאֲנִי אוֹמֵר שֶׁלֹּא חָשׁ לְדַקְדֵּק בַּלָּשׁוֹן</p>\n<p>Onkelos renders תנקש as an expression of the same root and meaning as מוקש, a snare. But I say that he was not particular to examine carefully the expression</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Torah Sheleimah suggests that because Onkelos was the one who brought back the Targum, and he learned from Tenaim, his Targum has the same status as a Tanna. So when Rishonim disagree with him, it's because they found other explanations in Chazal to follow instead.</p>\n\n\n",

These are complicated issues of the utmost importance. I checked with a rosh kollel in Bnei Brak who specializes in <em>nidda</em> issues.

Relevant issues are whether alternatives exist, whether the couple already has a boy and a girl and whether the husband agrees.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Immersing the day after the normal night is by no means obvious</strong>. There is an issue noted in <em>poskim</em> that a daughter will see the immersion by day and start to believe it is possible to immerse on the 7th day. Poskim will typically only agree if the issue delaying the immersion at night is valid every night for everyone (i.e., it is dangerous to immerse at night) but not when the issue is for a specific individual (e.g., there is a <em>simcha</em> one wants to attend one specific evening)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>On using a lake as a mikvah</strong>, there are additional complications vs. a river. Specifically a lake might have somewhat dirty water which creates pressure to immerse quickly, might not provide enough isolation to be alone with the guardian and might not be deep enough to properly immerse. In addition one has to make sure there is a guardian, avoid interpositions (e.g., sand on feet) and wear a loose robe (see e.g., <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2232\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>When we asked similar questions, we were always strongly advised to find alternatives and NOT to put ourselves in such a situation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Yoazot site specialises in these questions and might be a useful resource, see e.g., here on <a href=\"http://www.yoatzot.org/questions-and-answers/answer.asp?id=856\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lakes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yoatzot.org/questions-and-answers/ask.asp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> to ask a question.</p>\n\n\n",

If in his second time he then also accidentally began the weekday brachos does he need to finish the bracha he's in? We might say that since the only reason one finishes the bracha is because really one should have been obligated to say the full (weekday) davening even on shabbos, but this person has already said the whole weekday davening, and he now needs only the Shabbos brachos, so why should he complete the weekday bracha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When the person is chayav to daven a second amida because he forgot Shabbos - in his repeat, he should really recite the entire thing with both shabbos and weekday, and the chachamim went easy on him and said only do shabbos - but if he went into weekday mode the same svara to finish it should apply.

    "content": "# How long does it take to learn to layn Megillas Ester?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How much time would it take to learn Megilla layning to the level of a pro with zero prior layning experience?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>I've been a Torah reader for about 45 years, and have read Megilla for about 20 years. This is tough to give you an exact assessment, here, because there are several factors here. So, take what I write as my own \"best professional\" opinion.</p>\n\n<p>I'm going to assume throughout that you can both read and pronounce Hebrew well. (I've been listening to numerous Bar Mitzvah boys in my shul that can't, but some of them are reading the maftir and haftarah and are butchering everything. So, pardon, my having to state the assumption, but I hope I'm right. If not, then my estimates are going to be <strong>way</strong> off.)</p>\n\n<p>Most Bar Mitzvah boys do spend a year learning their parsha. I agree that it's way too long for most assuming that your diligent. That means that you need to practice your notes and parsha about once per week. An average parsha is about 100 verses. If you practice once per week, I think a competent musically inclined person could do a competent job in about 6-8 months assuming no prior knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>My method, though, is \"unconventional\". Most Bar Mitzvah teachers start by teaching each individual trope sound and trope \"groups\" and have students practice and review this for 2 - 3 weeks. It's nice to know the theory, and it can't hurt. But, I have found that many Bar Mitvah boys are nervous / stressed by the Bar Mitzvah itself (much of this is really the parents' fault, BTW) and focusing on this can be more frustrating than it's worth. Even for adults that will lain, occasionally, this can be useful, but it's unnecessary. You can learn the parsha like you're learning a song without even knowing the names of the notes.</p>\n\n<p>The Megilla is a constant. The words never and trope never change from one year to the next. Also, it's the only trope \"mode\" of its kind. (I.e., Torah trope sounds one way, haftara another way, and its \"portable\" to multiple parshiot.) So, in short, the learning method for Megilla is the same as for Torah. Learn it like a song (i.e., don't waste your time on what each trope sounds like, unless that interests or helps you.)</p>\n\n<p>Now extrapolate the time estimate above. The Megilla has about 200 verses. Now, I'm not suggesting that it will take you double the time as learning a Torah parsha, but it might. Offhand, I think that if you review a chapter once per week, you should be able to do it in about 8 months.</p>\n\n<p>Some factors that will affect this time:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your musical inclination / ear / competency. You don't have to have a stellar voice, but you definitely can't be completely tone deaf either. The better you can memorize the sound, tone, nuances, the quicker it will be.</li>\n<li>How good is your memory for music and word pronunciations? The Megillah has both the longest verses in Tanac\"h (that does make it quite challenging) as well as some of the more unusual \"tough\" pronouncing words in Tanac\"h.</li>\n<li>How much time can you review and how frequently? Obviously, the more frequently you practice the quicker things will go. But, you must practice frequently, because it's easy to forget what you did if you don't.</li>\n<li>What's your stamina and determination? You will make many mistakes at the beginning, especially, as well as throughout this venture. If you're the type of person that gets easily frustrated and gives up ... well, my friend, maybe this venture isn't for you.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I strongly encourage you to learn from a competent <em>Ba'al Kri'a</em>, but most of all someone who is extremely patient and someone who encourages and believes in your competence. This is a tough project for a beginner to do on his own. There are various tapes / CDs and online resources. But, none of them will either correct you or give you useful criticism, which is really what you will need.</p>\n\n<p>Another method you can use - but you really need a good musical ear. I learned Torah laining mainly by attending shul weekly and following along with the Chumash and listening to my shul's professional <em>Ba'al Kri'a</em> (Torah reader.) I focused on a set of trope notes and picked up the sound and rhythm by listening to the reading. In my case, by the time I was taking Bar Mitzvah lessons with the <em>Ba'al Kri'a</em> and my parents and neighbors said I needed about 8 months, the <em>Ba'al Kri'ah</em> heard me and said I needed about 3 months. Alas, few shuls now use a hired reader who is the same one each week, so this may pose a challengs. But, if you have a good musical ear, you can do it this way.</p>\n\n<p><em>Megilla</em> won't be as quick because it's read just twice per year. But, you could, technically, learn it from a tape / CD if you have a sharp musical ear. It's not for everyone, obviously.</p>\n\n<p>I hope all this info helps. Best of luck.</p>\n\n\n",

Are there any sources that discuss how this practice interacts with the prohibition against following <em>darkhei emori</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>I don’t see it being called Minhag Yisroel but the source for the practice in general is from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua chapter 2</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The <em>red thread</em> or הוט שני is the <em>Sign of truth</em> which was given to the prostitute Rachav to indicate her home and all contained within it would be safe from the tumult of conquest by the children of Israel in Eretz Yisroel. The practice was to indicate the non-Jew who protects Jews from danger.</p>\n\n<p>The thread was hung in the window of the home to be visible to the outside. In many ways, it is reminiscent of the lambs blood smeared on the doorposts of the Jewish homes in Egypt at the first Passover.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, there are some Jews who employ this red thread as a similar mark of protection, like Rachav the prostitute. And this is like is explained by the <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Wearing-Red-Thread.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Aish Rabbi\"</a> who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a matter of fact, the red thread (“roiteh bendel” in Yiddish) is one of those Jewish practices which has very little Jewish about it. The peddlers of red threads today claim that they come from a string wrapped around Rachel’s Tomb seven times and that they possess Kabbalistic powers, in particular warding off the Evil Eye. And in fact, <strong>there are rabbis who attest that similar customs has been practice going back several generations. (Many tie a red string to a baby’s crib for protection.)</strong> Yet there is no known early source which mentions or condones the practice. If it has any Kabbalistic powers, there is no work on Kabbalah which makes any mention of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it is surprising that the Aish Rabbi fails to recognize the red thread practice mentioned in Sefer Yehoshuah.</p>\n\n<p>This connection between the red thread, Rachav the prostitute, Yehoshuah and several of the prophets of Israel is discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.14b.11-13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 14b</a> which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Naḥman said: <strong>Huldah was a descendant of Joshua. An allusion to this is written here: “Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas [ḥarḥas]” (II Kings 22:14)</strong>, and it says elsewhere with regard to Joshua: “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres [ḥeres]” (Judges 2:9), therefore intimating that there is a certain connection between them. Rav Eina the Elder raised an objection from a baraita to Rav Naḥman’s teaching. <strong>The baraita indicates that Huldah was in fact a descendant of Rahab, and seemingly not of Joshua: Eight prophets, who were also priests, descended from Rahab the prostitute, and they are: Neriah; his son Baruch; Seraiah; Mahseiah; Jeremiah; his father, Hilkiah; Jeremiah’s cousin Hanamel; and Hanamel’s father, Shallum. Rabbi Yehuda said: So too, Huldah the prophetess was a descendant of Rahab the prostitute, as it is written here with regard to Huldah: “The son of Tikvah,” and it is written elsewhere in reference to Rahab’s escape from the destruction of Jericho: <em>“This cord of [tikvat] scarlet thread”</em> (Joshua 2:18).</strong> Rav Naḥman responded to Eina the Elder and said to him: Eina the Elder, and some say that he said to him: Blackened pot, i.e., my colleague in Torah, who has toiled and blackened his face in Torah study, from me and from you the matter may be concluded, i.e., the explanation lies in a combination of our two statements. <strong>For Rahab converted and married Joshua, and therefore Huldah descended from both Joshua and Rahab.</strong> The Gemara raises a difficulty: But did Joshua have any descendants? But isn’t it written in the genealogical list of the tribe of Ephraim: “Nun his son, Joshua his son” (I Chronicles 7:27)? The listing does not continue any further, implying that Joshua had no sons. The Gemara answers: Indeed, he did not have sons, but he did have daughters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This same theme of the red thread is also mention in Shir HaShirim 4:3 in describing the beauty of G-d’s beloved.</p>\n\n\n",

Nonetheless, the dairy component would be minimal, and from a Halachic perspective, the dairy residue is nullified (botel bishishim) and of no consequence. The bottom line of all this is that these cookies may be consumed after meat and poultry, but not simultaneously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>IMSMC, according to the Maharshal, being stringent by not relying on the halachik principle of nullification (bittul) is considered heretical/quasi-heretical (as unjustified rejection of a traditional halachik principle; as opposed to the traditional principle of <em>ein mevatlin issur l'chatchila</em> - not intentionally nullifying forbidden food).  Nonetheless, this does not appear to reflect normative practice.  </p>\n\n<p>However, in the case of \"dairy\" equipment, there appears to be the added issue that it is not clear that there was even bittul to begin with (i.e. based on the language cited above, it seems there is at least an additional uncertainty whether any given cookie has even a trace amount of dairy).  </p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, which halachic authorities (rishonim and/or achronim) does the OU rely on in crafting its ruling that even an alleged uncertainty (safek) of a possible trace amount of <em>heter</em> dairy should nonetheless prevent eating the overall product <em>together</em> with meat (assuming, of course, that Oreos are considered <em>nosein taam lishvach</em> [tasty] in a cholent)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The OU's psak is based on treating the cookies as a case of Nat bar Nat i.e. dairy 'taste' absorbed by the machinery is then considered to have been absorbed by the pareve cookies, <strong>even if the machinery is completely clean of any dairy residue on the surface</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The stringency not to eat such a food directly with meat, but to permit it immediately following meat, is based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.95.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rema Yoreh De'ah 95:2</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/nat-bar-nat-status-pareve-food-cooked-dairy-or-meat-pots\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> by R. David Brofsky gives a nice overview of the topic. Key quotes which are relevant here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rema notes that food which is fried or cooked in dairy utensils may not be eaten WITH meat.

He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people. 5 This is to the end that the people of Israel may bring their sacrifices that they sacrifice in the open field, that they may bring them to the Lord, to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the Lord. 6 And the priest shall throw the blood on the altar of the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the fat for a pleasing aroma to the Lord. 7 So they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons, after whom they whore. This shall be a statute forever for them throughout their generations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And yet we find in the book of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.7.9-10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Samuel Chapter 7</a>, Samuel making a sacrifice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>9 And Samuel took one sucking lamb and offered it up as a burnt offering, entirely to the Lord, and Samuel cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord answered him.      ט וַיִּקַּ֣ח שְׁמוּאֵ֗ל טְלֵ֚ה חָלָב֙ אֶחָ֔ד וַיַּעֲלֵ֧הוּ (כתיב וַיַּעֲלֵ֧הֻ) עוֹלָ֛ה כָּלִ֖יל לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה וַיִּזְעַ֨ק שְׁמוּאֵ֚ל אֶל־יְהֹוָה֙ בְּעַ֣ד יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וַֽיַּעֲנֵ֖הוּ יְהֹוָֽה:</p>\n<p>10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near for war against Israel, and the Lord thundered with a loud noise on that day, upon the Philistines, and threw them into a panic, and they were beaten before Israel.        י וַיְהִ֚י שְׁמוּאֵל֙ מַעֲלֶ֣ה הָעוֹלָ֔ה וּפְלִשְׁתִּ֣ים נִגְּשׁ֔וּ לַמִּלְחָמָ֖ה בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וַיַּרְעֵ֣ם יְהֹוָ֣ה | בְּקוֹל־גָּ֠דוֹל בַּיּ֨וֹם הַה֚וּא עַל־פְּלִשְׁתִּים֙ וַיְהֻמֵּ֔ם וַיִּנָּגְפ֖וּ לִפְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi's commentary is very peculiar. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.7.9?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_I_Samuel.7.9.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and offered it up as a burnt offering: The kethiv is ‘vayaaleha’ fem. gender, because it was a female. Hence, our Rabbis deduced that a female animal is acceptable for a burnt offering in a private high place, in Tractate Abodah Zarah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems totally unnecessary since in a different place (I forget where) Rashi says such things were done because Shiloh had been destroyed. It also opens up a whole can of worms because in Leviticus there are several areas where female animals are specifically mentioned, as needing to be brought to the Kohanim.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Peace Offering may be either Male or Female. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.3.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 3:1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.3.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6</a>)</li>\n<li>The Sin Offering would be male for a ruler but female for a for a common person (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.4.27-28?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 4:27-28</a>)</li>\n<li>The Trespass Offering is to be female (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.5.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 5:6</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus it would seem that both male and female sacrifices are contemplated by Leviticus 17!</p>\n<p>So my question is, in view of such a major prohibition, how do we see the book of Samuel describing people doing this in 1 Samuel Chapter 7? In the 17th verse Samuel builds an altar in Ramah. Presumably, Samuel would have done it also with King Saul if he had waited for him.</p>\n<p>And my other question is, how come Rashi comments that the rabbis deduce this about female sacrifices, when there are other sacrifices elsewhere, there is no need to talk about female sacrifices, <em>and</em> Leviticus clearly enumerates female sacrifices among the Shlomim and others?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This episode took place after the destruction of Shiloh (as you mentioned in your question) but before the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem by King \nSolomon. During this period, there was a central, national sanctuary first in Nob and then in Gibeon (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_The_Chosen_Temple.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchot Beit HaBechirah 1:2</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbis understood that the prohibition mentioned in Vayikra 17 of sacrificing outside of the sanctuary applied during the time of the <em>mishkan</em> in the desert, while the <em>mishkan</em> stood in Shiloh, and then once the Temple was built in Jerusalem the prohibition lasted forever.</p>\n\n<p>As we see in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Zevachim.14.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zevachim 14:7</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באו לנוב ולגבעון התרו הבמות</p>\n  \n  <p>Once they came to Nob and Gibeon, private altars were permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, there was no issue for Samuel to sacrifice at a private altar, away from the main sanctuary in Nob.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As for your question on Rashi, note that Samuel is here described as offering a lamb as an Olah, or burnt offering.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.1.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayikra 1:10</a> we read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאִם מִן הַצֹּאן קָרְבָּנוֹ מִן הַכְּשָׂבִים אוֹ מִן הָעִזִּים לְעֹלָה זָכָר תָּמִים יַקְרִיבֶנּוּ</p>\n  \n  <p>And if his offering is from the flock, from the sheep or the goats, as a burnt offering, he shall offer an unblemished male.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The point that Rashi is making is that this requirement that a burnt offering must be male only applies at the central sanctuary, not at a private altar, which is why Samuel could offer a female burnt offering here. The fact that other types of sacrifices (such as peace offerings or sin offerings) offered at the central sanctuary were in fact female is not really relevant.</p>\n\n\n",

In the interview Rabbi Besser tells the following story. (Where the story mentions \"the Lubavitcher Rebbe,\" the reference is usually to Menachem Mendel, although the story took place when the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe Yoseif Yitzchok was living, and Menachem Mendel had not yet become the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gnFG5.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gnFG5.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the Belzer Rebbe came to Berlin to see an eye doctor, so the\n  Lubavitcher Rebbe told Itzche Meir \"You know what, I hear the Belzer\n  Rebbe's here. I would like to see him.\" And, uh... so they went, they\n  knew where he was staying, they went, the two of them went up and the\n  [Belzer] Rebbe was standing with closed eyes because he couldn't, he\n  had problems with his vision and the people were in line giving Shalom\n  one after another and he had on his hand a towel and that's how he\n  gave Shalom, with... through the towel. And one of... Itzche Meir gave\n  Shalom; then the [Lubavitcher] Rebbe gave Shalom. When the Rebbe gave\n  him Shalom he looked up, maybe opened his eyes, and he took off the\n  towel and he gave him Shalom with the hand. Everybody there was\n  astonished: he made an exception here. So they started to ask Itzche\n  Meir \"Who is this? Who... who is he?\" So he said \"He's the eidim\n  [son-in-law] of [the sixth] Lubavitcher [Rebbe].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is, what is this towel for? Was it related somehow to Tumah and Taharah? If this question is not too personal, what is it that everyone else was doing, that the Rebbes in the story were not doing, that explains that the one would shake the hand of the other directly?

I know the Hataf is usually placed under gutteral letters, but that does not seem to be the case here. Why do all of our siddurim show the shewa and not the hataf patah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In Tiberian Hebrew, a shewa naʿ is by default equivalent to a hatef patah. Some masoretic manuscripts write this explicitly more frequently than others. One of the key features of the Aleppo Codex (A) is the frequency of explicit hatefim. Thus where the A has הַֽלֲלוּיָהּ, other mss have הַֽלְלוּיָהּ or הַֽלְלוּ־יָהּ. (Note that the gaʿya is present to indicate that the shewa is naʿ; were it not present, a simple gemination would occur.)</p>\n<p>For example, Isaiah 10:1:</p>\n<p>הַחֹקֲקִ֖ים חִקְקֵי־אָ֑וֶן (A)</p>\n<p>הַחֹֽקְקִ֖ים חִקְקֵי־אָ֑וֶן (<a href=\"https://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Isa10:1-10:1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leningrad</a> [gaʿya corrected], <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42690&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Venice</a>, <a href=\"https://digital.blb-karlsruhe.de/image/tile/wc/nop/4049/1.0.0/3396516/3/2/1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Codex Reuchlinianus</a>)</p>\n<p>Ignoring the placement or existence of the gaʿya, the form הַחֹקְקִ֖ים is also found in the codices: Leningrad Firkovich 9, 25-26, 59, 124, 225, Cairo, and Sassoon 1053. It may even be the uncorrected form in A itself.</p>\n<p>It is important to realize that the masoretic pronunciation is identical completely in any case: [haːħoːqaqiː(i)m ḥiqqeː'ʔɔːvεn].

The Medresh Rabbah (ואתחנן פ' יח) says that there are two types of haircuts that fall under the category of darkei emori, which is asur. The medresh describes one of these haircuts as \"תפיסת קורצין\" (I appologize for potential misspelling) which the Eitz Yosef (one of the primary commentaries on Medresh Rabbah) says is a haircut which cuts the peyos in such a way that there is no obstruction when trying to grab the ear, rather the proper way to have your peyos is over the ear which would create an obstruction, ע\"ש.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Not sure how strictly \"prohibit\" is meant in your question - but the Idra Rabba seems to say the <strong>ideal form of them (the hair of the \"Peot\") goes from over the ears and is part of the beard at large, which surrounds the face and covers down to the core of the heart.</strong> <em>Rather than a prohibition to tuck them behind the ears it might be a type of bittul Asseh of \"walking in His ways\" - (however, consider the opening of Rashbi's discussion, \"Woe! to he that \"extends his hand\" - see there)</em> - and the Zohar greatly praises and emphasizes the enormous power of Pikudin d'Asseh, the positive commandments, to arouse His love and sweeten judgments etc.</p>\n<p>First Rashbi explains thirteen Tikkunei Dikna, corrections and formations of the Supernal \"Beard\" (and the hair of the Peot is included the Beard but not by the name Peot) of the Saba Kadisha. The Friends in turn together reveal another thirteen Tikkunim. Then this is followed by the Nine Tikkunim of the Beard of Zeir Anpin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Zohar III:130b ff.</p>\n<p>R' Shimon opened the discussion and said:<br>\nWoe to he that extends his hand (destroys/cuts - degrades/<strong>displaces?</strong>?) the Precious Supernal \"Beard\" of the Saba Kadisha, the most Hidden and Concealed!\n...</p>\n<p>We have learned in Sifra D'Tzniuta that this (Supernal) \"Beard\" [which is] the universal faith, <strong>goes forth from</strong> [behind] <strong>the ears and descends encircling the Holy Mouth, descends-rises-and-covers with a (powerful) offering of fine fragrance the whiteness/brightness of (His) glorious (Face).

The Avnei Nezer has a teshuva which says that changing the knot back after borrowing it shows that the knot wasnt a permanent knot and that knot made isnt considered a permanent knot. However, I beileve many(Rav Soloveitchik for one) do not consider this to be an issue. </p>\n\n<p>An additional reason to having your own pair is by a careful reading of the Tosefta Chagiga 3:1 seems to says this. When talking about lulav it says if he knows how to wave then he is obligated in lulav. By teffilin it says that the father should buy him teffilin. That seems to imply that lulav he can borrow,but teffilin he should buy his son his own pair.</p>\n\n<p>Text of Tosefta:</p>\n\n<p>קטן שאין צריך לאמו חייב בסוכה קטן שצריך לאמו יוצא בעירוב אמו ושאינו צריך לאמו מערבין עליו מזון שתי סעודות בעירובי תחומין [יודע] לנענע חייב בלולב יודע להתעטף חייב בציצית יודע לדבר אביו מלמדו שמע ותורה ולשון קודש ואם לאו ראוי לו שלא בא לעולם יודע לשמור תפיליו אביו לוקח לו תפילין...</p>\n\n<p>See Tosfos in Erchin 2b</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>(Summary at the bottom.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph Karo</a> lays down the following ruling:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x403\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch O.C. 38:12</a></strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היה צריך לתפילין ומזוזה ואין ידו משגת לקנות שניהם תפילין קודמים</p>\n  \n  <p>If one needs tefillin and a mezuzah and cannot afford to acquire both\n  of them, tefillin take precedence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moses Isserles</a> gives the same ruling:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6800\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 285:1</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומ\"מ אם אין ידו משגת לקנות תפילין ומזוזה יקנה תפילין ולא מזוזה דמצוה\n  שהיא חובת הגוף עדיפא</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, if he cannot afford to acquire tefillin and a mezuzah he\n  should acquire tefillin and not a mezuzah, because a mitzvah which is\n  an obligation on the body is greater.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would seem to imply that halacha does expect one to own tefillin; otherwise one could simply buy the mezuzah and borrow someone else's tefillin. However, this is not necessarily a proof because it is possible that the aforementioned rulings simply mean that tefillin is more important than mezuzah, and if a situation arises in which the only way to fulfill either mitzvah is by expending money then the money should be spent on tefillin, but perhaps in a regular case one should in fact borrow tefillin and buy a mezuzah.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Gombiner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Abraham Gombiner</a> in his commentary to the first ruling writes as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6800\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 38:15</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מיהו לדידן שאין מניחין רק בשעת ק\"ש ותפלה אם אפשר בשאלה מזוזה קודמת\n  דא\"א בשאלה</p>\n  \n  <p>However, for us who don't put them on except at the time of the\n  recitation of Shema and prayer if it is possible via borrowing then\n  mezuzah takes precedence, because it [mezuzah] is impossible via\n  borrowing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This clearly indicates that one does not need to own tefillin (as they can be borrowed) but it does not necessarily mean that there is no ideal to own tefillin.</p>\n\n<p>Along these lines, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayyim_Mordecai_Margolioth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Hayyim Mordecai Margolioth</a> cites a ruling that buying tzitzit takes precedence over tefillin if tefillin are available to be borrowed. He adds that this is only if one is certain that he will be able to borrow tefillin whenever he needs; if, however, there is a possibility that he will not be able to borrow tefillin on any given occasion then he should buy tefillin instead of tzitzit:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x376\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'arei Teshuvah O.C. 25:1</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עבה\"ט וכתב בר\"י בשם האחרונים שאם אפשר שיהיה לו תפילין בשאלה מאחר ציצית\n  קודמין ע\"ש וע' לקמן סי' ל\"ח ס\"ק י\"ד לענין תפילין מזוזה ונראה דהיינו אם\n  נכון לבו בטוח שיוכל לשאול תפילין שעכ\"פ לא יצטרך להחזירם כל זמן שירצ'\n  אם לא יזדמנו לו לקנות ואם לאו אכתי איכא למיחש שמא יצטרך להחזירם טרם\n  יזדמנו לו אחרים ונמצא בטל ממצות תפילין שהיא קודמת למצות ציצית לדברי\n  הפוסקי' אלו שהם עיקר לדינא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This indicates that there is a value, and perhaps even an obligation, to own tefillin in order to ensure that one will always have the ability to don them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%A9_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%99%D7%96%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%98\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Abraham Tzvi Hirsch Eisenstadt</a> cites R. Margolioth, but offers an alternative argument. He suggests the possibility that buying tefillin only takes precedence over tzitzit and mezuzah when it is <em>certain</em> that without buying the tefillin he will be unable to fulfill the mitzvah by borrowing. In such a case tefillin takes precedence. If, however, it is <em>uncertain</em> whether he will be able to borrow tefillin then mezuzah and tzitzit should take precedence because the <em>definite</em> inability to fulfill a mitzvah should supersede the <em>possible</em> inability to fulfill a mitzvah:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6800\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pitchei Teshuvah Y.D. 285:2</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועיין בש\"ת בא\"ח סימן כ\"ה סק\"א שכתב לענין ציצית ותפילין שכתבו האחרונים\n  שאם אפשר שיהיה לו תפילין בשאלה ציצית קודמין וז\"ל ונראה דהיינו אם נכון\n  לבו בטוח שיוכל לשאול תפילין בכל יום שעכ\"פ לא יהיה צריך להחזירם כ\"ז\n  שירצה אם לא יזדמנו לו לקנות ואם לא אכתי איכא למיחש שמא יצטרך להחזירם\n  טרם שיזדמנו לו אחרים ונמצא בטל ממצות תפילין שהוא קודם לציצית עכ\"ל וא\"כ\n  ה\"ה לענין תפילין ומזוזה אם אינו בטוח שיהיה לו תפילין בכל יום בשאלה\n  תפילין קודמין אך לדעתי צ\"ע דאפשר הא דתפילין קודמים למזוזה וציצית דוקא\n  ודאי דתפילין מודאי דמזוזה וציצית היינו היכא שאם לא יקנה תפילין יתבטל\n  בודאי ממצות תפילין אבל לא שיהא ספיקא דידיה מוציא מידי ודאי שלהם כגון\n  הכא שאם לא יקנה תפילין אפשר שיקיים גם מצות תפילין בשאלה אולי מזוזה\n  וציצית קודמין דאם יקנה תפילין יתבטל בודאי ממזוזה וציצית אבל אם יקנה\n  מזוזה וציצית אפשר שיקיים גם מצות תפילין וא\"כ אף אם אינו בטוח שיהיו לו\n  תפילין בכל יום מכל מקום מזוזה וציצית קודמין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Eisenstadt's argument does not, however, preclude the possibility of there being a preference for one to own tefillin. He merely argues that it wouldn't be enough to justify not fulfilling a different mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Meir_Kagan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Israel Meir Kagan</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 38:37</a>) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Michel_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Gombiner, that if one can borrow tefillin then he should spend the money on a mezuzah instead. Again, though, this does not mean that there is no preference for one to have his own tefillin; it merely means that it is not enough of a preference to supersede a different mitzvah entirely.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>In sum, there is almost certainly an ideal for one to own tefillin in order to ensure that he will always be able to fulfill the mitzvah, and perhaps there is even an obligation which according to some might even be strong enough to override fulfilling the mitzvah of mezuzah at all.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

In fact, the\n  practice of kissing the hand of an elder in the synagogue is one which\n  dates back to Talmudic times (Avoda Zara 17a; Rashi). As such, we see\n  that giving a kiss in a religious context is often more of a\n  ceremonial gesture than an affectionate one.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to a number of authorities, the prohibition against kissing\n  in the synagogue applies exclusively to kissing one's children and not\n  to others. This is because the feelings that one has for one's\n  children are unlike those for any other person (Kaf Hachaim, OC\n  98:10) [...] Conversely, kissing any other person following an aliya\n  or other synagogue honor, as is the custom in many Sefardic\n  congregations, would be permissible according to this approach (Ben\n  Ish Chai; Vayikra 11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://hirhurim.blogspot.co.il/2010/06/kissing-children-in-shul.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">original</a> for further details</p>\n\n<p>I remember reading (in R Moshe's biography I believe) that R Moshe Feinstein used to kiss his grand-children in shul as he held that the prohibition applied only to direct children.</p>\n\n<p>R Chaim Cohen <a href=\"https://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.il/2014/11/kissing-others-in-shul.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes further</a> that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R’ Avraham Yitzchak Kook (Orach Mishpat OC 22) writes that this\n  prohibition applies to kissing other family members and friends, too.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Ben Ish Chai (Vayikra 11) writes that while one shouldn’t kiss\n  one’s young children in Shul, the sefardi minhag of kissing the hand\n  of a Talmid Chacham is commendable because it is done out of respect\n  rather than personal affection. Likewise, one may kiss one’s father or\n  Rabbi after being called up for an aliyah where that is the accepted\n  practice (See Kaf Hachaim OC 151:6). R’ Ovadia Yosef (Yechave Daas\n  4:12) explains that showing them kavod is a form of honouring Hashem,\n  just as one must stand for them, even in Shul.

It takes place after Noah brings sacrifices after the Great Flood. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיָּ֣רַח יְהֹוָה֘ אֶת־רֵ֣יחַ הַנִּיחֹ֒חַ֒ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־לִבּ֗וֹ לֹ֣א אֹ֠סִ֠ף לְקַלֵּ֨ל ע֤וֹד אֶת־הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽעֲב֣וּר הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָֽאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו וְלֹֽא־אֹסִ֥ף ע֛וֹד לְהַכּ֥וֹת אֶת־כָּל־חַ֖י כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשִֽׂיתִי:</p>\n  \n  <p>And the Lord smelled the pleasant aroma, and the Lord said to Himself, \"I will no longer curse the earth because of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and I will no longer smite all living things as I have done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even earlier, in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8168/jewish/Chapter-4.htm#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 4</a>, reference is made to the Yetzer Hara:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הֲל֤וֹא אִם־תֵּיטִיב֙ שְׂאֵ֔ת וְאִם֙ לֹ֣א תֵיטִ֔יב לַפֶּ֖תַח חַטָּ֣את רֹבֵ֑ץ וְאֵלֶ֨יךָ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָת֔וֹ וְאַתָּ֖ה תִּמְשָׁל־בּֽוֹ:</p>\n  \n  <p>Is it not so that if you improve, it will be forgiven you? If you do not improve, however, at the entrance, sin is lying, and to you is its longing, but you can rule over it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואליך תשוקתו: של חטאת, הוא יצר הרע, תמיד שוקק ומתאוה להכשילך:\n      ואתה תמשול בו: אם תרצה תתגבר עליו:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"And to you is its longing\" [The longing] of sin, which is the Yetzer Hara, which constantly longs and lusts to cause you to stumble.<br>\n  \"but you can rule over it\" If you wish, you will overpower it. \n  [Source: Sifrei Ekev 45, Kiddushin 30b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we have the Talmud and early <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Medrashim</a> also speaking about the Yetzer Hara. Indeed, both the Talmud and Medrashim are peppered with references to the Yetzer Hara (just try searching \"יצר הרע\" in any Talmudic search engine. You can find a few examples <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/3575\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/3603\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>As far as the identification of the snake with the Yetzer Hara, I believe the source is the Zohar.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"רבי יצחק אמר: דא יצר הרע, רבי יהודה אמר: נחש ממש\" (פרשת בראשית דף לה ע\"ב).</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yitzchak says: This is the Yetzer Hara. Rabbi Yehudah says: An actual snake.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the medieval commentators explain that previous to the First Sin, the Yetzer Hara (=snake) was external to the person. After the First Sin, the Yetzer Hara was internalized.</p>\n\n\n",

In discussing this point with others in the comments to the latter question, we arrived at the Rambam, Hilchos Kiddush HaChodesh 5:2ff who says nothing about sanctification, merely that we can use a calendar if there’s no Sanhedrin around to sanctify the month, and a reference to the <a href=\"http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php?title=Committee_concerning_the_fixing_of_the_Calendar\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Netziv and other poskim</a>, but it doesn’t have any sources. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know where I can find someone who says this explicitly, that the calendar’s existence hangs on the fact that Hillel and his Beis Din sanctified the calendar for the following 1600 years, only up to the year 6000 in anticipation of Mashiach’s arrival?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>You write that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s often said that when Hillel instituted the current calendar, he set an “expiration date” of 6000 AM; at that point the calendar would be invalid. Since Mashiach presumably will come by then (as per Sanhedrin 97a et. al.) the calendar doesn’t need to run farther than that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think that this is a misunderstanding. What is actually said (as we shall see) is that Hillel sanctified all of the months until Mashiach's arrival, without specifying when that would be.</p>\n\n<p>When this is coupled with the assumption that Mashiach will come by the year 6000, people may say that Hillel fixed the calendar until that time, but by no means is he said to have explicitly given an expiration date.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest source I find for the assertion that Hillel pre-sanctified the months is Ramban in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hasagot_HaRamban_al_Sefer_HaMitzvot,_Mitzvot_Ase_List.153.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">glosses to Sefer HaMitzvot, Aseh 153</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי הלל הנשיא בנו של רבי יהודה הנשיא תקן חשבון העבור הוא קדוש חדשים ועיבור שנים הראויים להתעבר לפי מנינו עד שיבוא אליהו ז\"ל ונחזור על פי הראיה בב\"ד הגדול והקדוש אמן במהרה בימינו יהיה</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Hillel the Prince, son of R. Yehudah the Prince, fixed the calculation of the <em>ibbur</em>, that is the sanctification of the months and the intercalation of the years which ought to be intercalated according to his count, until Eliyahu comes and we return to [the system] of observation in front of the great and holy court. Amen, may it be speedily in our days!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, if for whatever reason, Mashiach has not arrived by the end of the sixth millenium, Hillel's pre-sanctification of each and every month will just keep going for as long as necessary.</p>\n\n<p>(Of course, there may be other reasons why a reform of the calendar may be needed in the event of Mashiach's late arrival, not least the issues with the slowly shifting date of Pesach with respect to the solar calendar, but there would seem to be no need for a renewed sanctification of the months after the year 6000, even if one accepts Ramban's position over that of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Sanctification_of_the_New_Month.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a>.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Note the Netziv is not quoted as saying Hillel sanctified the calendar only until year 6000. As we discussed in the comments <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/91855/11501\">here</a>, this might not have any source at all, and might be a confusion with the often-repeated idea that Mashiach will become before the end of the sixth millenium (based on Zohar and others, see e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_6000#cite_ref-11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The Netziv is quoted <a href=\"http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php?title=Committee_concerning_the_fixing_of_the_Calendar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as saying that, mechanically, the current calendar will have Pesach coming out two new moons after the first day of Spring which conflicts with the requirement that Pesach should come out after the new moon of Spring (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.16.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 16:1</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The answer given on that site is that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some poskim replied that Mashiach would come by the year 6000, so\n  there was nothing to worry about. Others said this would become an\n  halachic question that will eventually require the re-establishment of\n  the Sanhedrin to universally authorize a change in the calendar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I see that something similar is said by the Biur Halacha to OC 427, described <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/94311/9682\">here</a>. He says there that the calendar will fall out of sync by the year 5847 AM, but not to worry, since Mashiach will come by then. I wonder if people rounded 5847 to 6000, then, based on the Gemara in Sanhedrin 97a, swapped the cause and effect - not that it’ll fall out of sync, but Mashiach will come by then so it doesn’t matter, but rather Mashiach will come by 6000, so the calendar will expire by then. </p>\n\n\n",

How can we judge the Nazis in an absolute fashion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>People cannot be ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN they love their children. Ask a psychologist about things lurking in unconscious parts of our minds because we won't admit ugly truths to ourselves. We certainly can't prove that love to others. And yet, we do not demand any kind of proof before making major sacrifices on their behalf.</p>\n\n<p>If the sun has come up every day of your life, and was always in shades of yellow or orange (when on the horizon) when you saw it, you would make firm plans on the sun being a yellow or orange next time you were able to see it. Would you demand a proof first? Or try to figure out a way to show other people the sun is really that color before acting? Do you believe that the sun is yellow because you can get other people to say the same thing, or because you have seen it uncountably many times and it's yellow (or sometimes orange).</p>\n\n<p>What you're asking for is simply not how people make decisions. You're holding up religion to an unrealistic standard of certainty.</p>\n\n<p>(I am ignoring your examples, which are problematic in other ways.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>The answer to this OP IMHO, is to be found in Talmud Kiddushin 80a. The name of the \"sugya\" (topic) is \"Soklin v'Sorfin al Ha'Chazakos\" (\"We stone and burn the accused because of a [strong] presumption of established evidence\")</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Gemara there explains that the Court has the legal power and obligation to stone and burn the accused (finding them guilty of a capital offense) based upon a mere established presumption. How so?</p>\n\n<p>If a man, a woman, and a girl live together in the same family household as man and wife, while claiming the child to be their biological product, we accept the absolute fact that they indeed enjoy such relation.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if witnesses come and testify (years later when the girl becomes an adult) that the father (just now) committed incest with the daughter; then the Court executes them both (father and daughter). We do not say in their defense that perhaps he is not the real biological father of the girl.</p>\n\n<p>This Gemara is based on the Torah itself. The Torah authorizes and requires that someone who strikes their father be put to death. This is regardless of the fact that one can never actually absolutely prove the identity of someone's father in Court. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So here you actually have a case in the Torah where Judaism teaches that even if you do not absolutely know something, you may still impose these rules on others in the Torah's name.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>But, the OP is asking how we can impose things upon others \"if we are not absolutely cetain\" Judaism is true? If so, we cannot simply quote the Torah to prove how we can impose the Torah. That would be the fallacy of circular reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>Lets step back and try to show that accepting the Torah (even without absolute proof) in the first place is considered to be following known objective truth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CARTESIAN PROOF?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rene Descartes was a French philosopher (1596 - 1650) (\"I think , therefore I am\") who proposed a way to know if something is absolutely true or not. It can be expressed like this:</p>\n\n<p>Proposition A is true, if you cannot find any alternative to A that <em>could be</em> true instead of A.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Is it absolutely (known to be) true that I should take a dose of the prescription drugs in this bottle the doctor gave us?</p>\n\n<p>Answer: You cannot say it is absolutely true, because the pharmacist may have accidentally switched the right medication, for poison, when filling this prescription.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you can certainly eliminate all alternative possibilities, you can never say something is absolutely true.</p>\n\n<p>Although, this definition (known as \"Cartesian Proof\") seems foolproof in theory, it breaks down when applied to the practical world as a thresh-hold for initiating responsible action or belief. Examples:</p>\n\n<p>1) I woke up this morning and met my son at breakfast. He asked me for pocket money. I decided not to give him the money because maybe he was just my son's doppleganger, or an alien?</p>\n\n<p>2) Although I feel and understand murder to be wrong, I have no absolute proof that it is wrong. So I have no right to condemn or judge murderers.</p>\n\n<p>3) I need to stay home today, because there may be a lion in the streets and I have no proof that I will not be eaten.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, Cartesian proof will even have you question if you are actually awake, or just dreaming that you are. (Descartes actually asks this himself!) </p>\n\n<p>So, we have established that anyone holding their beliefs and actions to the standards of Cartesian, or \"absolute\" proof of truth, will probably find it very hard to remain sane and live a normal life. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So, there is no such thing as absolute certainty; and that is OK.</strong></p>\n\n<p>What we need is to try our best with the resources we have, and the knowledge available, to make the best possible decisions in life that we can. We need to define \"what we know to be absolutely true\", by the best possible facts we can find, that make the most sense. Then, the stronger the facts, the stronger will be our sense of believing in what we hold to be \"true\". </p>\n\n<p>Now the OP did not ask us to prove the truth of the Torah. So, for the sake of the OP, and this exercise, we will treat the truth of the Torah as a given, as follows:</p>\n\n<p>1) I have exerted myself to find the truth as best as I can.</p>\n\n<p>2) That search has led me to believe that the Torah is true.</p>\n\n<p>3) But, I cannot say I know the Torah is \"absolutely true\" with Cartesian proof.</p>\n\n<p>4) However, since waiting for (such unattainable) Cartesian proof will cause sure madness and risk destroying the world etc. I have the obligation to choose responsible action and to go with the overwhelming proof I have found which has triggered my own inner belief and convictions based upon it.</p>\n\n<p>5) Based on the above, my belief in Torah is now elevated to the level of \"absolutely true\" in effect and as far as I can tell. That is absolutely good enough and it is relevant and compelling as well.</p>\n\n<p>6) The Torah itself also obligates me to act and impose, even upon others. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion: Therefore I am justified and obligated in living a Torah life and doing whatever the Torah says about imposing it upon myself and others.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The above applies ditto for condemning such people as Nazis. You do not need to be absolutely morally sure that Nazis are wrong to condemn them. Your knowledge about the evil of murder and hate etc. is enough to be considered just as good as absolute knowledge, even if you would not win a debate with your knowledge at Harvard.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you do not really think you know the Torah (or any moral code) to be true, (forget \"absolute\" LOL) then the truth is, you are a bit lost. Under such circumstances, you should not be imposing life decisions upon others or yourself in a major way. However, life is not such a willing partner to your ignorance. Pretty soon, you will be faced with daily paradox situations forcing you to choose even if you are not sure. (unless you simply live in a cave)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, you need to still strive to work hard at learning, until you do in fact realize you have found a set of values that are true. Of course, I think you will find that it is the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>(references to \"you\" are style and grammar, not assumptions about the particular person reading this.)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps :)</p>\n\n\n",

I don't think I've seen it as part of Friday night, but I have seen it at the beginning of the morning Kiddush as well as zemirot for <em>Se'udah Shlishit</em>. Nusach Sefard also includes this near the end of <em>Ma'ariv</em> for Lail Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>What is the reason or what theme is in Psalm 23 that was deemed important to include it in all of these items? Is there some theme that connects Psalm 23 with Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadok_HaKohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin</a> addresses this question in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pri_Tzadik,_Terumah.11.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pri Tzadik, Terumah 11</a>. He gives a number of different explanations, of which one of the less esoteric is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ביום השבת שאנו שובתין מכל העבודות ומו\"מ להכין צרכי פרנסה ומוציאין הוצאה על עונג שבת ... ועל כן תיכף בכניסת השבת אחר תפילת ערבית אנו אומרים כי אנו יודעים כי ה' רועי וממילא לא אחסר כלל. וכן אנחנו אומרים מזמור זה אחר סעודת ג' דשבת כדי להמשיך הקדושה הזו בלבבנו שנדע אף בימי המעשה שאנו משתדלין בעסק הפרנסה מכל מקום ה' הרועה שלנו והמפרנס ולא בכח מעשה ידנו ועל כן לא אחסר אף בחול</p>\n  \n  <p>On shabbat we rest from all work and business for the purposes of earning a living, and we spend money on delighting in shabbat ... therefore, immediately at the start of shabbat after the ma'ariv service we say that we know that 'Hashem is my Shepherd' and therefore 'I will not lose out' at all. Similarly, we say this psalm after the third meal of shabbat, to extend this holiness in our hearts, so that we know that even during the working week, when we put in effort to earn a living, nevertheless Hashem is our Shepherd and the One Who Sustains, not through our own handiwork, and therefore 'I will not want' even during the week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The intention of chapter 23 from Tehillim in connection with Shabbat is the union of <em>Masculine</em> and <em>Feminine</em> (דכרא ונוקבא). This is explained in many Siddurim that include Kabbalistic explanations like for example <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6755&st=&pgnum=269\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Kol Yaacov by Rabbi Yaacov Koppel</a> and Siddur Tefillah m’kol HaShanah by Rabbi Shabbtai of Rashkov.</p>\n\n<p>This is expressed many ways, but one of the easiest to recognize is that there are 45 words preceding the phrase אך טוב וחסד. And 9 words follow the phrase. Thus, אך טוב וחסד, <em>which according to the Ari z\"l as discussed in both Sefer Etz Chaim and Sefer Pri Etz Chaim is intended to indicate G-d</em>, is surrounded or enclothed so to speak by the group of 45 words and the group of 9 words.</p>\n\n<p>The 45 words is a siman for masculine as in Adam (אדם <em>which is gematria 45</em> and alludes to <em>Similar to G-d</em>, Domeh l'Elyon דומה לעליון) and the 9 words are a siman for the feminine because it alludes to the womb which is associated to the letter ט. This reference about ט is mentioned in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaBahir.124?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bahir, chapter 124</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In this context, the phrase אך טוב וחסד alludes to what joins the masculine and feminine together. The end letters of אך טוב וחסד are 26 which is a siman for G-d’s name. <em>(In fact, the Ari z\"l also points out that the first letters of אך טוב וחסד together with the first letter from the first of the 9 words that are associated with the feminine are also the gematria of 26.)</em></p>\n\n<p>That the womb, which is associated with the feminine, corresponds to the <em>Makom Panoy</em> (<em>the empty space</em>) that G-d created within His essence in order that the universe <em>(something which on a certain level appears separate from G-d)</em> could be created. And following the explanation in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6755&st=&pgnum=238\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Kol Yaacov</a>, one of the things we recall on Shabbat is the creation of the universe during the 7 days of Bereshit. That the <em>Makom Panoy</em> is filled with the flow from G-d. This is the words of Kiddush for Shabbat night.</p>\n\n<p>And this points to an underlying theme of Shabbat, namely the 3 partners in marriage (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.30b.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 30b</a>), איש ואשה, husband and wife together with G-d. Without G-d, יה, all that remains is fire. (אש\"י ואש\"ה, איש ואשה)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Shapiro of Dynov (1783-1841), in his <strong>בני יששכר</strong> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14490&st=&pgnum=58\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Benai Yissachar, in the section on Minchat Shabbat, chapter 20</a><sup>1</sup>, gives the following numerical symbolism to the connection between this mizmor and Shabbos.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The number of letters within mizmor 23 adds up to the equivalent sum\n  of \"ברכה\" - (“Beracha” - Blessing). By reciting the Mizmor three\n  times, (at the 3rd meal of Shabbos), we are invoking a “<strong>Beracha\n  Meshuleshet</strong>” (a “tripled” blessing.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Also know the number of words in the Mizmor is <strong>57</strong> which is the\n  equivalent of \"<strong>דגים</strong>\" (“Dagim” - pl. for fish), a staple of the\n  Shabbos menue).</p>\n  \n  <p>It is also to symbolize our hopes that the abundant food from Shabbat\n  will carry over into the weekdays. There is also hinted in this mizmor\n  (pasuk. 2) \" בנאות דשא ירביצני\" (“B'Neos Desheh Yarbitzaini” - In\n  grass meadows He Makes me lie down). The word  <strong>''ד' - 'ש'</strong>  <strong>א</strong>' \n  -— <strong>Dalet</strong>; <strong>Shin</strong>; <strong>Alef</strong> can be viewed as an acrostic representing <strong>דגים - שבת - אדם</strong> ( Dagim (fish); Shabbos, and Adam\n  (man) ), drawing attention to how man should celebrate the Shabbos by\n  eating particular special foods on Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1.

These are his spiritual soul (what we call his neshamah)\nand his animal soul. The conscious “I” that thinks and feels is made\nup of both parts. The neshama comes from under the throne of Hashem's\nglory. It is pure and lofty, holy and sublime. All that it wishes for\nis that which is good, proper, and noble. Because it comes from the\nupper worlds, it derives no benefit from this world and can’t relate\nto any of its pleasures. The other part of man’s soul is very\ndifferent. It is exactly like that of an animal, with all of the\npassions and desires necessary to keep it alive. That is his animal\nsoul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Just as the body needs food to live and grow, the neshama also needs \"food\". There are sources that write the food of the neshama is Torah. As such the joy from learning Torah would literally come from feeding the neshama with its expected nourishment.</strong></p>\n<p>Two sources I have found so far on this are</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since through the knowledge of Torah the Torah is absorbed in the soul\nand intellect of the person and is encompassed within them,it is\ntherefore called the “bread” and “food” of the soul.

So too, Torah is naturally sweet, but if you use your mouth for obscenities you won't be able to taste the sweetness of Torah.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to this story, Torah is naturally sweet.

Thanks</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I can see where you may get confused. The term <em>kove'ah</em> has a nuance of \"fixing\" or \"setting\" implying that it has to be the same thing that never changes. But, I don't think in this context it means that you need to have the same time each day. It means \"establishing a fixed amount of time.\" I.e., establish an hour, 15 minutes, etc. for learning. Ideally, it should be the same time slot, but, of course circumstances will arise that will change things. That doesn't mean all is lost. The idea is to establish a fixed interval, and, make the best effort to adhere to it. </p>\n\n<p>There are numerous online resources available for learning, and there are various methods. It depends what you like to learn. This past week, for example, many communities in U.S. began a 5 minute WhatsApp group focusing on hilchot <em>lashon hara</em>. I haven't yet signed up, myself, as I am still trying to get the email address. Let me know if this would interest you.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.partnersintorah.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Partners in Torah</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jnet.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jnet.org</a>. They will match you with someone either in your area or you can learn via Skype or other similar method. Technology has really vastly improved the means to learn Torah with others - be it 1 person or a group. These days, with almost everyone having a computer, I see little reason why someone cannot find a way to learn with another.</p>\n\n\n",

Accordingly, he wouldn't sell his own Chametz but he would consume Chametz sold by someone else since the sale did in fact work.</p></li>\n<li><p>The whole idea of a Jew owning Chametz on Pesach is a bit of a misnomer since Chametz, like any other object from which it is forbidden to derive benefit from, has no [current] value and can't formally be owned. The Talmud (Pesachim 6b) tells us that for Chametz on Pesach the Chametz is not really in your possession but the Torah made it \"as if\" it was in your possession. Some argue (see Magen Avraham and Mishna Berura to OC 448:3) that if you genuinely attempted to remove the Chametz from your possession, even if the attempt unknowingly failed, the Torah doesn't put it into your possession against your will. Accordingly, one couldn't sell his own Chametz, but the Chametz of others who genuinely tried to sell it would be fine.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Eventually, Moshe Rabeynu himself is called down from heaven and asked his opinion. He testifies that he personally saw the back of Hashem's Tefillin shel Rosh, but Rabeynu Tam is not persuaded. In the words of the Seder Hadoros: \"Rabeynu Tam got up like a lion and said Moshe Rabeynu you are mistaken!\".</p>\n\n<p>2) The Chossid R' Hillel of Paritch was a devoted follower of the Tzemach Tzedek. There was once a dispute amongst the Chassidim on how to interpret a certain point of one of the Rebbe's discourses. When they asked the Rebbe himself what he meant, his response favoured the other Chassidim's approach and not R' Hillel's. However R' Hillel refused to retract from his position, explaining: \"When the Rebbe says a Chassidic discourse, the Torah is being given from Sinai. But like all words of Torah, it is crucial that we understand them, and that means using our own brains. So the Rebbe has his understanding of the discourse - said this morning at Sinai - and I have mine.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One might ask: if, as we established in Chapter One, all the basic\n  explanations if the laws of the Torah were received from Moses, (the\n  general wording of the laws {written in the Torah} and also the\n  particulars and details of all the laws of the entire Torah were\n  spoken on Sinai- the Tora Kohanim, B'har) then what is that special\n  class of laws designated by the term \"Halacha L'Moshe Mi-Sinai\"-Laws\n  given to Moses at Sinai?</p>\n  \n  <p>This basic point must be understood: [None of] the explanations which\n  were known to have originated with Moses were ever contested. Ever\n  since Moses,until the present, we have never found a dispute arising\n  among the sages of any time or era- from the days of Moses to those of\n  Rav Ashi- in which there would be a sage who would say that one who\n  takes out the eye of his follow has his eye removed as an observance\n  of the verse, \"Eye replaces eye\" (Deut. 19:21), and that it would be\n  only another sage who would state that the verse merely means he is\n  obligated to monetarily compensate for the loss. </p>\n  \n  <p>Neither have we ever found any disagreement arising over the meaning\n  of the verse, \"You shall take the fruit of he glorious tree\" (Levit.\n  23:40)....

DoubleAA <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16931/permissibility-of-removing-wisdom-teeth#comment37160_16934\">gave other examples</a> to the contrary.</p>\n\n<p>My question is when you can say that a machlokes counts as a safek.</p>\n\n<p>(I thought I had asked this in June, but apparently I forgot.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems to me that a disagreement among rabbis can very well acquire the status of a <em>safek</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Avodah Zarah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=7&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">7a</a>) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היו שנים אחד מטמא ואחד מטהר אחד אוסר ואחד מתיר אם היה אחד מהם גדול\n  מחבירו בחכמה ובמנין הלך אחריו ואם לאו הלך אחר המחמיר ר' יהושע בן קרחה\n  אומר בשל תורה הלך אחר המחמיר בשל סופרים הלך אחר המיקל א\"ר יוסף הלכתא\n  כרבי יהושע בן קרחה</p>\n  \n  <p>If there are two sages present and one declares unclean and the other\n  clean; one forbids and the other permits; if one of them is superior\n  to the other in wisdom and in numbers, his opinion should be followed.\n  Otherwise, the one holding the stricter view should be followed. R.\n  Joshua ben Korcha says: In laws of the Torah, follow the stricter\n  view. In those of the rabbis, follow the more lenient view. Said R.\n  Joseph, the Halacha is according to R. Joshua ben Korcha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=81&perek=1&halocha=5&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mamrim 1:5</a>) rules this way as well, and incidentally this is the same way we rule on every matter of <em>safek</em>; i.e. in questions of biblical law we are strict and in questions of rabbinic law we are lenient. To me, the simplest explanation is that these two rulings are one and the same, for every matter of doubt based on conflicting opinions is actually a <em>safek</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, there are certain considerations one needs to take into account.</strong> Most basically, <a href=\"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com/2012/06/standing-on-shoulders-of-giants.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">everyone has the right to an educated opinion</a>. If someone is confident about their opinion and has the requisite knowledge to be this confident then it is certainly not Halachically considered a <em>safek</em> to them, regardless of who disagrees, as long as this opinion works <a href=\"http://beismedrash.blogspot.com/2012/06/authority-of-talmud.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">within the Halachic system</a>. For this reason the Rambam (ibid) qualifies the above ruling by saying it only applies \"when you do not know which way the law leans.\" This is why the Shulchan Aruch will often rule in accordance with one opinion and not the other without mentioning that it is a matter of doubt, because to him it simply wasn’t. He ruled that way because in his opinion that view carried more weight logically.</p>\n\n<p>A spinoff of this consideration is the fact that everyone has the right to have a specific rabbi one always follows when one does not know the Halacha. The Gemara’s ruling is only to prevent picking and choosing in a Halachically arbitrary fashion, but one who says “I always follow Rabbi X” can follow him even when he is a lenient minority and it is a question of biblical law. As the Gemara itself (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=6b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eruvin 6b</a>) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והרוצה לעשות כדברי בית שמאי עושה, כדברי בית הלל עושה, מקולי ב\"ש ומקולי\n  ב\"ה רשע, מחומרי ב\"ש ומחומרי ב\"ה עליו הכתוב אומר (קהלת ב:יד) הכסיל בחשך\n  הולך, אלא אי כב\"ש כקוליהון וכחומריהון, אי כב\"ה כקוליהון וכחומריהון</p>\n  \n  <p>One who wishes to follow the words of the House of Shammai may do so.\n  The words of the House of Hillel; may do so. The leniencies of the\n  House of Shammai and the leniencies of the House of Hillel; is wicked.\n  The stringencies of the House of Shammai and the stringencies of the\n  House of Hillel; upon him Scripture (Ecc. 2:14) says “the fool walks\n  in darkness.” Rather either the House of Shammai with their leniencies\n  and their stringencies, or the House of Hillel with their leniencies\n  and their stringencies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the Gemara elaborates, the specific application mentioned in the passage does not apply anymore; for reasons not relevant to this discussion.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that one does have the right to choose an opinion even though one is not sufficiently educated and knowledgeable to have one, as long as one always follows the opinions of this individual and is therefore not acting recklessly and wickedly.</p>\n\n<p>On this authority we can theoretically follow the decisions of the Shulchan Aruch even when we do not feel confident enough deciding ourselves which of the Rishonim got it right. The idea is, simply put: the Shulchan Aruch is our rabbi. When we don’t know, we always follow him. Or the Rema. Or the Aruch HaShulchan. Or the Mishna Berura. This can apply to anyone, and is really the concept known as posek acharon, final Halachic authority. It isn’t that we truly believe that any particular person has the final word, but there are certain people we hang our hats on, so to speak, in all cases where we aren’t confident to have our own opinion. Doing so is of great benefit to us for this very reason – it takes care of a lot of doubts and precludes them from acquiring <em>safek</em> status.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary:</strong> Every disagreement is potentially a <em>safek</em>, but in actuality if one has a confident, educated opinion, or if one consistently relies on someone else who has a confident, educated opinion, then said opinion does not have the status of <em>safek</em> at all (unless one has an educated, reasonable doubt about the particular opinion that is not simply translated as \"but someone else said...\").</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This isn't a full answer, because it doesn't address when you <em>can</em> call a disagreement a Safek, but it answers, I think, why you can or can't in some of the examples you gave.</p>\n\n<p>I think there are at least two differences between the case of the wisdom teeth and the case of the 'Omer. With the 'Omer, first comes the Safek that perhaps you counted it already. Then, since there is a difference of opinion in the Halachah, we allow you to call the Mahloketh a Safek for purposes of establishing a Sfek Sfeka. With the wisdom teeth case, you're essentially saying maybe the Halachah is different, and maybe the Halachah is different (in this case). That's, at best, the same Safek repeated. Not enough to establish a Sfek Sfeka, or even to call the Mahloketh a Safek for any purpose with a Nafka Minah.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, he writes in his commentary to Deuteronomy (28:47):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והשמחה במעשה המצוה מצוה בפני עצמה</p>\n  \n  <p>The joy in doing a mitsvah is a mitsvah in and of itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You are correct that the vast majority of Rishonim, such as Rambam, do not count it as its own technical mitsvah. However, as we quoted from him, he nevertheless states that it constitutes a great act of divine service</p>\n\n\n",

When Rashi writes in Sefer Bereishit that Canaan captured the territory from Shem, he did not mean that Canaan launched an independent campaign. Rather, his father, Cham, assigned him the task of conquering the unsettled areas of the land for him, Cham. After Canaan completed the conquest, Cham rewarded him with the land and built the city of Chevron. We can thus reconcile the two comments of Rashi.

Nor can I speak about any midrashic analysis of it. However, I can address what causes it.</p>\n\n<p>The pashta is a pausal trup sign that splits in half a clause that ends in zakef. Where two occur, first the first one divides, then the second one divides. This division usually occurs on the basis of syntax, such as whether an object, subject, verb, or preposition leads the clause. See William Wickes for a full discussion of this.</p>\n\n<p>In the pasuk in question:</p>\n\n<p>וְהָיָ֗ה הָאִישׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַע֙ אֶל־דְּבָרַ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר בִּשְׁמִ֑י אָֽנֹכִ֖י אֶדְרֹ֥שׁ מֵֽעִמּֽוֹ׃</p>\n\n<p>looking only at the first half, up to the etnachta, we have:</p>\n\n<p>וְהָיָ֗ה הָאִישׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַע֙ אֶל־דְּבָרַ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר בִּשְׁמִ֑י</p>\n\n<p>The trup symbol at play that divides something ending in etnachta is the zakef on Devaray and the tipcha on yedaber. Thus, it is divided into:</p>\n\n<p>וְהָיָ֗ה הָאִישׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַע֙ אֶל־דְּבָרַ֔י</p>\n\n<p>אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר בִּשְׁמִ֑י</p>\n\n<p>and the second part of that is divided into:</p>\n\n<p>אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר</p>\n\n<p>בִּשְׁמִ֑י</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the first half, the revii and pashta(s) both divide something ending in zakef. And so, the clause:</p>\n\n<p>וְהָיָ֗ה הָאִישׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַע֙ אֶל־דְּבָרַ֔י</p>\n\n<p>is divided into:</p>\n\n<p>וְהָיָ֗ה</p>\n\n<p>הָאִישׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַע֙ אֶל־דְּבָרַ֔י</p>\n\n<p>and the latter part is divided into:</p>\n\n<p>הָאִישׁ֙</p>\n\n<p>אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַע֙ אֶל־דְּבָרַ֔י</p>\n\n<p>and the latter part is divided into:</p>\n\n<p>אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַע֙</p>\n\n<p>אֶל־דְּבָרַ֔י</p>\n\n<p>The clause keeps getting divided off at the start, for syntactic reasons Wickes discusses.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the general rule of dividing a clause ending in zakef (see in Wickes) is that the symbol used to divide is a pashta close to the zakef, and a revii further from the zakef. That is:\n1 word before: Pashta\n2 words before: most frequently Pashta, but Revii admissable\n3 words before: most frequently Revii, but Pashta admissable\n4 or more words before: must be revii</p>\n\n<p>However, from a musical standpoint, a series of Reviis will not stand in certain circumstances, and so they will \"transform\" into Pashtas. This is what is happening in the present instance. To cite Wickes:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FFaRn.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>While I don't possess statistics as to the frequency of this pattern (there is some software out there that will indeed tell you), note that Wickes mentions that \"examples of this transformation are (as we should expect) much more numerous than those in which R'bhia remains.\"</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, since this is a perfectly normal pattern predicted by the rules of trup and subject to a specific syntactic structure of the sentence, I would expect this pattern to occur on occasion. And I would see no need to seek out midrashic explanation.</p>\n\n\n",

I will quote one additional answer</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They instituted the practice of reciting V’Hu Rachum before Tefilas Maariv. The reason to do is clear. In Midrash Ruth we learned that three entities rule in hell: Mashchis (destroyer), Af (anger) and Chaima (rage). They are responsible to judge the souls of the wicked. All others who serve there work under their control. Those agents of punishment create such a tumult that the sound can be heard in the heavens. Within the noise can be heard the voices of the wicked crying out: Oy Yoy and no one extends any pity towards them. These agents rule on each day of the week beginning at night and they judge those whose actions brought darkness and are forced in death to constantly think about what they did.</p>\n<p>Therefore they instituted the practice of reciting the verse: V’Hu Rachum because beginning with the\ntime of Tefilas Maariv the wicked are judged by the three agents, Mashchis, Af and Chaima. Notice that all three\nof the agents are mentioned in the verse: V’Hu Rachum. The words: V’Lo Yashchis represent Mashchis. Af is\nrepresented in the words: V’Hirbah Li’Hashiv Apo; Chaima, in the words: V’Lo Ya’Ir Chamaso. That is why\nwe recite this verse on weeknights. Once Shabbos comes, the process of judging those in Hell pauses. The wicked in\nHell are extended a rest. Once Kiddush Ha’Yom is recited on Shabbos the agents of punishment stop their work.\nThat is why we do not recite the verse of V’Hu Rachum before Tefilas Maariv on Erev Shabbos. We do not want\nto stir the agents of punishment. It is prohibited to say the verse on Erev Shabbos out of respect for G-d who\nprotects the wicked on Shabbos. We demonstrate that the process of judging the wicked has been suspended for the\nday and that the agents of punishment are prohibited from inflicting punishment on Shabbos</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>tl;dr the agents that administer hell beginning on week-nights have names that are found in that pasuk. We recite this pasuk to placate those agents of hell.</p>\n\n\n",

Lambdin</a> calls out the words שְנַיִם and שְתַּיִם as exceptions to \"shewa as the initial vowel in a word is always vocalized,\" i.e. it is \"shtayim\" and \"shnayim\". That's a secular expert's view.</p>\n\n<p>I recently moved, and the Rabbi at my new shul says \"shi-tayim\" and \"shi-nayim.\"  I asked him about it, citing in particular that in שְתַּיִם the tav would not have a dagesh if the shewa were vocalized.  He said he has a source, but I haven't seen it.</p>\n\n<p>What is the halachically correct pronunciation: \"shtayim\" or \"shitayim\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The words שְׁתֵּי, שְׁתַּיִם etc. had two pronunciations during the masoretic period. The first pronunciation was with an epenthetic aleph, as אֶשְׁתַּיִם, etc. The second was simply to omit the sheva at the beginning: shtayim.</p>\n<p>The accent yetiv only appears on the first vowel of a word. If there is a vowel before the stress syllable---including a sheva---the yetiv is replaced by a pashta. In many good manuscripts, such as the Aleppo Codex and Leningrad Codex, שְׁתַּיִם receives a yetiv. In these cases, it appears that the pronunciation of shtayim was followed. Some manuscripts have a pashta in these positions, implying that the prosthetic vowel was used by their authors.</p>\n<p>Both pronunciations are described in many masoretic treatises (see <a href=\"https://www.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/OBP.0163.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>). For instance, <a href=\"https://www.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/OBP.0194.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hidayat Al-Qaari</a> (Sefer HaHilufim) (I.L.2.12.5) describes the pronunciation with the added aleph in the kere (קרי):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A  mobile shewa is  not  followed  by  a  letter  with dagesh [...]\nThis is not contradicted by שְׁתַּיִם  and שְׁתֵּי.  For  if  there\nis  an  added ʾalef  and  you  say [ʔɛʃˈtʰaːjim] (i.e. eshtayim)  and [ʔɛʃˈtʰeː] (i.e. eshte),  the\nshewa becomes  quiescent.  I  shall discuss this at greater length in\nthe section concerning yetiv with the  help  of  G-d  and  His  good\nwill.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note Judges 16:28, with a dagesh hazak in the shin, and a rafe on the tav: נְקַם־אַחַ֛ת מִשְּׁתֵ֥י עֵינַ֖י. But on the other hand, we find in Jonah 4:11 no dagesh hazak, and a ga`ya lengthening the hiriq: הַרְבֵּה֩ מִֽשְׁתֵּים־עֶשְׂרֵ֨ה רִבֹּ֜ו</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Ibn Janah and other early Jewish grammarians in the centuries immediately after the Masoretic Era state that the shewa is nah (quiescent) and the daghesh is qal (soft).  Ibn Ezra was surprised to discover many many communities in North Africa that retained the pronunciation eshtayim which was not the case in his native Spain.  Despite comments you might see to the contrary, eshtayim was not pronounced with a real aleph.  It was described that way because the grammarians could not imagine a vowel that did not follow a consonant -- hence they described pathah genuba (furtive pathah) as having a \"hidden\" aleph before it.  The epenthetic (helper) vowel was a hateph-segol.\nThe key question for your Rabbi is whether he is simply following the arbitrary rule that shewa on the first letter of a word is na` (mobile).  If so, he is in error.  If, however, he is following a specific shita of a recognized authority or of an authentic reading tradition, then he should do so.  You will need to determine in this whether you determine your tradition as the Rabbi does.  The rule of shewa on first letter of a word being na` is misstated.  The rule actually is that a shewa on the first letter of a syllable is na`.  This is the only case where the first letter of the word does not start a syllable.\nBy the way, none of this applies to shenayim, where the shewa is na`.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your Rav is correct that most of the time (in fact, nearly all the time), a Shəvah under the first letter of a syllable should be Na', but he is not correct about the Dagesh.  </p>\n\n<p>Shtayim is the correct pronunciation, and is even evidenced by the fact that the Dagesh wouldn't be in the Tav if the Shəvah weren't Naḥ.  </p>\n\n<p>See, for example, Arabic, which, as a way of compensating for the same phenomenon, has an introductory vowel, an Alif, before the Shin (well, really, its cognate; the Arabic/Hebrew relationship is funny).</p>\n\n<p>Another example to compare with Arabic is Ibn.  In Hebrew it's Ben.  Why the difference?  Because both languages are compensating for the fact that it's really Bn.  One (Arabic) compensates with an introductory vowel, while the other (Hebrew) compensates with a change in the first vowel.  Yehoshua' Bin Nun can be seen as an example where the original pronunciation was somewhat preserved (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/8336/5\">this question</a> asks why his name is Bin Nun instead of Ben Nun, and the answers tend to assume a more Midrashic reason, although <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8344/5\">this one</a> delves a bit into the grammar).</p>\n\n<p>Other examples abound in Arabic, and many Arabic-speakers have a distinct accent when speaking English or other languages with double consonants at the beginning of words, such as \"eblease\" (please; there's also no 'p' in Arabic), and my favorite example, Eskander, the Arabic name for Alexander ('Al' being treated as the direct object and therefore dropped, leaving a name starting with 'X', which is transposed to 'Sk', which is a double-consonant, which gets the helper-vowel 'ə' appended to it).</p>\n\n\n",

It appears from your question that your primary concern with the Chabad philosophy is what you term \"Chabad Messianism\", and how that is perceived by other Orthodox groups. I am assuming you are referring to the belief that the Rebbe is Moshiach. I wish clarify from the start that it not my intent to debate this fact or not.</p>\n\n<p>From my experience I have seen the vast majority of other Orthodox groups to be quite respectful and accepting of Chabad and consider us to be a branch of authentic Orthodox Judaism. There is always the radical vocal few that will dismiss us as Messianics, possibly without even taking the time to understand our view. Often there are other reasons behind the animosity and this is just used as an forum to argue. </p>\n\n<p>[It is also important to note that is impossible to generalize that Chabad holds one way or another on this issue. I have personally encountered Lubavitchers, include Rabbonim with diverse views on the subject.  Anyone who makes a blanket statement that Chabad holds x is simply wrong. Additionally it is important to remember that Chabad is an extremely inclusive group, and thus there is a very diversere group of people claiming to be Chabad. Also, those who subscribe to a more radical viewpoint are by nature more vocal so it is difficult for outsiders to hear the mainstream views.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Chabad is controversial because it challenges the mind to intellectually grasp the concept that the Atzmus (Essence of) Ein Sof (the Infinite Light) is present although concealed in every aspect of this physical world. </p>\n\n<p>This above mention is idea can be explained through the concept of Tzimtzum. Is G-d's light contracted ie: removed from the world, or is it merely concealed, vested in creation with a purpose for the Jew to reveal it? The Lubavitcher Rebbe breaks it down to four ways of understanding (Source: Marbitzei Torah U’Mussar, Vol. III, p. 66.) </p>\n\n<p>a) the tzimtzum should be interpreted literally, and moreover, that it affected G-d’s essence.

This is sole purpose of creation and the concept has been foreign since the Churban and limited to small circles of kabbalists. Chabad revealed it to the world and this is the root of any and all controversy. </p>\n\n<p>Torah Or, in the maamar Pasach Eliyahu  Likkutei Torah, in the additions to Sefer Vayikra, the maamar Lehavin Mashekasuv beSefer Otzeros Chayim; Shaar HaYichud; Sefer HaMitzvos, [the maamarim entitled] Mitzvas Haamanas Elokus, and Shoresh Mitzvas HaTefillah (beginning ch. 34); in the Siddur, [the maamar] on the verse Zecher Rav Tovecho. In the maamarim of my revered father-in-law, the Rebbe shlita, that have been printed, [the subject is discussed] in [the maamarim entitled:] Al Yipater Adam [56]89, Dirshu Havayah [5]691, Al Kein Yomru [5]691, [Sichos] Shavuos [5]693, p. 8, and Tov Li [5]697. </p>\n\n<p>The above all sources from this above sourced letter. </p>\n\n<p>“It is not possible to ask a question about a [Rebbe being a] go-between, since this is G-d Himself, as He has clothed Himself in a human body.” (Likutei Sichos II:p. 510-511).</p>\n\n<p>This controversial enough? The Tzaddik is a Chariot for Hashem. Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov are all called chariots. (See Ch. 46 of Tanya) What is a chariot? It is something you get inside and control it to aid you in your bidding. But more importantly, a chariot is an object with no will of its own. It does exactly what its driver wants it to.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Really interesting thread. I think it does illustrate at least one reason why Chabad is \"controversial\": You can see from the comments that Chabad people have their <em>traditions</em> about the attitudes of the rest of the Orthodox world, and the rest of the Orthodox world sees those traditions as being inaccurate, out of touch. \"Everyone else disagrees with us about ___ concerning tzimtzum, etc.\" \"The Vilna Gaon came out against us because ___.\"<br />\nIt would never occur to them to ask us.<br />\nI love Chabad guys and get along well with them, but they don't ever pay any attention to what the rest of the Orthodox world does or thinks. They do their own thing. That has its strengths and its disadvantages.<br />\nUpdate: I note that the original question was about messianism, and maybe I got distracted by the comments. But truth is that I think the messianism is also linked to what I wrote: If Chabad were more connected with the rest of us, they would not have gotten so deeply invested in a messianic theory that the rest of us thought was nuts.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Jewish mysticism involve \"feeling\" G-d?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have read an accusation from the Traditionalist Catholics that Modern Catholicism has changed under the influence of Judaism its understanding of the Holy Ghost. Modern day Catholicism together with Protestantism involves feeling the workings of Holy Ghost or even  attempts at experiencing its presence. I was surprised once to hear a Polish Jew speak on the radio in a similar manner, making use of the etymological relation between \"Ruach\" and \"breath\" to picture his vision of experiencing G-d. </p>\n\n<p>I am surprised by the above statements which counter my prior understanding of Judaism. Does Judaism indeed involve practices of trying to get the literal union with G-d instead of just obeying the Law and trying to maintain a close relation as if between a father and a son? If so, how exactly would such an experience of \"feeling G-d\" look like and how does its notion vary among the different Jewish communities? How does Jewish mysticism vary in terms of practice and aims looking from the perspective of experiencing either ruach ha-kodesh or shekinah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is a very complicated question, with a complicated answer. I apologize that I can't provide sources for my answer, and I will try to simplify it.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the Talmud and earliest mystical writings, the answer to this question would be a clear \"No\", Judaism does not attempt to unify and \"feel\" Gd.  Rather the goal of the mystical journey is to enter Gd's court, and become close, but not unify with Him.  An absolute unity would be seen as dangerous and would cause a person's soul to cease existing as a separate entity.  The Talmud and Heichalot and the Merkava, speak of witnessing the angels, entering rooms and courtyards, and viewing from a distance.  The after life is spoken of as a grand Yeshiva where the greatest people sit in the front row.  But there is a clear distinction and separation between the Divine and the mystical practitioner.</p>\n\n<p>Jump forward after the Zohar, and after Chasiduth in the 18th century and things change a bit. Most certainly in the 1960s, the view of meditation and feeling unity with Hashem changed drastically.</p>\n\n<p>Today, you will definitely find people who understand the Zohar, and chasiduth as an attempt to feel and join in the unity of the Universe and Hashem.  It is hard today to find a unified Jewish mystical approach.  Each group of Chasiduth, and each Mekubal school approaches things differently based on numerous factors.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One major stream of Judaism has been the philosophical approach associated with Maimonides, in which the Divinity is considered a 'muskal', an 'intellegible'; that is to say, something that cannot be perceived through the physical senses, but only through the intellectual faculty. In this approach, it would not make sense to talk about feeling God. On the other hand, there is much more content to the religious life of one following this path than just acts of obedience to the Law. One of the major books in this stream of thought is the 'Hovot HaLevavot', the 'Duties of the Heart', which is based on the principle that the physical performance of the commandments, the 'duties of the limbs', are just a small part of religion, the greatest part of which is the interior practice, the 'duties of the heart', that a person of religion works to cultivate, in their minds and hearts.</p>\n\n<p>But if the Divinity in itself is beyond the grasp of our lower faculties of perception, the creations of the Divinity are not. The Hovot HaLevavot talks about contemplating the wisdom manifest in the created world as a way of connecting to God, because the wisdom has its source in God.</p>\n\n<p>Expanding on this idea, the Kabbalists (who maintain the position that Divinity as it is in itself is completely beyond our grasp) turn their attention to multiple emanations that can be said to flow from the Divinity in the aspect of His connecting to his creation. These are emanations like love, severity, beauty-- reflected through many symbols, images, words. I think they experience them in various ways that include powerful emotions and visions, though the literature is focused on theory and exegesis, not confessional first-person accounts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Itamar Schwartz, in his sefer Bilvavi Mishkan Evneh, argues that it is important, and attainable, for Jews to feel Hashem's presence.

On Motzei Shabbos, however, he lit them only after ma'ariv (which he davened approximately three quarters of an hour after sunset) and making havdoloh. [The report in Tohoras Habayis (part 2, p. 273) that the Chazon Ish lit Chanukah lights twenty minutes after sunset even on Motzei Shabbos--from which the author deduces that melochos may be done this soon after sunset when there is a pressing necessity--is erroneous].</p>\n\n<p>The source of the minhag of the Chazon Ish of when to light Chanukah lights on weekdays is found in the Bei'ur HaGra in Yoreh Dei'ah, Hilchos Milah chap. 266:17, who explicitly mentions Chanukah lights!</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish based his reasoning on the fact that there must be some darkness for Chanukah lighting, since \"what good is a candle during the day?\" In central Eretz Yisroel we light 20-21 minutes after sunset (depending when Chanukah falls according to the solar calendar). The sun is at that time 4.8 degrees below the horizon.</p>\n\n<p>Using the sun's position below the horizon as our criterion, these are the times to light Chanukah lights in selected cities worldwide according to the Chazon Ish: Zurich 27-28 minutes after sunset; Vienna 28-29 minutes; Sydney 22 minutes; Strasbourg 28 minutes; Stockholm 43-44 minutes; Rome 24-25 minutes; Paris 28-29 minutes; New York 23-24 minutes; Gateshead 35 minutes; Melbourne 23-24 minutes; Manchester 33 minutes; Los Angeles 21-22 minutes; London 31 minutes; Johannesburg 20 minutes; Cleveland 24 minutes; Chicago 24-25 minutes; Buenos Aires 22-23 minutes; Amsterdam 32 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>The custom in Yerushalayim, based on the traditions of the talmidei Hagra, is to light at sunset.</p>\n\n<p>See Birur Halocho Teliso'oh, Orach Chaim 772</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any idea for the other rabbonim calculations ?</strong> </p>\n\n\n",

The Sepharad minhag is that shat\"z says (almost) the whole prayer out loud. Sepharadim don't repeat the last sentence. So there's certainly no problem \"using\" the single sentence for two puposes: praying and informing the tzibur that the part is over. I'd say that there's no Isur and Ashkenazim can do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Since there's no problem with saying the last verse once and thus \"using\" it also for sync with the tzibur, I just don't see any justification for repeating it. Not that it causes great harm, but what for?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: repeating ends of blessings might well be Bracha-Levatalla as DoubleAA mentioned. Also, when the last verse contains Shem Hashem it might also be considered as saying Shem Hashem Lashav (for no justified need).</p>\n\n<p>All-in-all, this leads to a more unequivocal conclusion, that the last verse should not be repeated.</p>\n\n\n",

All indications are that it does not (actually as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18814/1601\">@avi</a> pointed out it does not really even mean a garment per se); <a href=\"http://www.snopi.com/ToraSearch/torasearch.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from other verses throughout the Torah</a> and <em>from this verse itself</em> - if שמלה alone meant an exclusively women's garment, the verse would not need to modify שמלת אשה and would have simply stated לא ילבש גבר שמלה.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the fact that the verse uses the term כלי when describing something a man wears is no proof to the contrary, because it changed another thing as well - it says לא יהיה instead of לא ילבש. It would seem that the simplest explanation is that when describing what the man wears the verse is actually being more broad than just describing the clothing he dresses in, which is the same reason it uses the term כלי and not שמלה. (Perhaps it was from here that R. Eliezer ben Yaakov inferred that it refers to a woman carrying a weapon in an exclusively male fashion, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18798/1601\">@SethJ</a> noted.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, two pesukim later, we see וְלֹא-יִלְבַּשׁ גֶּבֶר שִׂמְלַת אִשָּׁה (and a man shouldn't wear a woman's dress) — apparently, a dress is an exclusively female piece of clothing</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I disagree with your logic.</p>\n\n<p>וְלֹא-יִלְבַּשׁ גֶּבֶר שִׂמְלַת אִשָּׁה does not mean that a שמלה is exclusively a woman's clothing.

Since the Torah could have simply listed all the different categories (mamzerim and converts of Amonite, Moabite or Egyptian descent) and stated once that they may not enter the congregation, the gemara assumes that the word \"congregation\" must have been used extra times in order to teach further details about these prohibitions.

Unfortunately, the rebuke I received made me so self-conscious about my Tefillah that I have had trouble concentrating ever since.</p>\n\n<p>I would hope that if someone is being too loud while Davening, he will either catch himself or it will be an isolated incident.

    "content": "# Why was the translation considered a tragedy if it was already translated into 70 languages?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I just read in Parashat ki tavo that the Torah was translated into 70 languages and written on giant stones, yet the Talmud says the translation of the Torah to Greek many years later was considered a tragedy.</p>\n<p>Why was it considered a tragedy if it was already translated into 70 languages?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 26)\n\n<p>Actually, the earliest rabbinic sources present the Greek translation (the Septuagint) in glowing terms. In the Mishna, Megillah 1:8, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is quoted as having said that Greek is the only language, other than Hebrew, in which it is permissible to write <em>sifrei Torah</em>. Commenting on this, the Jerusalem Talmud (Megillah 71c) says that the sages checked and discovered that Greek is the only language into which it is possible to translate the Torah with its exact meaning.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, in the Babylonian Talmud (Megillah 9a), the origin story of the Septuagint is presented, and one which testifies to the miraculous nature of its composition. This origin story is very similar to the earliest extant text that testifies to the Septuagint's composition: a pseudepigraphic Jewish letter that purports to be written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Aristeas\">Aristeas</a>, King Ptolemy's bodyguard.</p>\n\n<p>The reality is that, by the time we come to the composition of the extracanonical tractate, Sofrim, the attitude had changed rather dramatically. There, in Sofrim 1:6-7, it is explicitly said that <em>sifrei Torah</em> cannot be written in Greek, that it is impossible to translate the Torah into any other language without changing its meaning, and that the day on which the Septuagint was written (by no more than <em>five</em> elders!) was as hard for the Jewish people as the day on which the golden calf had been constructed.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this change of attitude lies in the fact that the Septuagint (which, in time, came to denote the translation into Greek of the entire Tanakh) was embraced by the nascent Church and used in anti-Jewish Christian polemic. A favourite in that regard was the translation of Isaiah 7:14, in which עלמה (<em>'almah</em>, \"young lady\") was rendered παρθενος (<em>parthenos</em>, \"virgin\").</p>\n\n<p>By the time of the composition of minor tractate Sofrim, Christians had composed a number of anti-Jewish tracts, which utilised the Septuagint for the purposes of demonstrating Jewish stubborness in their rejecting Jesus. Perhaps the most graphic of these texts was a 6th century text (the same century in which Sofrim was composed), titled <em>Disputatio cum Herbane Judaeo</em>: \"Disputation with the Jew, Hurban [from the Hebrew word, Destruction]\". The author identifies himself as Bishop Gregentius of Tafra, in Yemen, but is only adopting that persona for the purposes of the text.</p>\n\n<p>In it, he attributes the following sentiment to his invented Jew, Hurban:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our fathers wrongly and capriciously translated the books of Israel\n  into Greek so that you could take possession of the same and silence\n  us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Martin Hengel, <em>The Septuagint as Christian Scripture: its Prehistory and the Problem of its Canon</em> (ed. David J. Reimer; Edinburgh & New York: T&T Clark, 2002), 35.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With such attitudes as these, it was no wonder that the Jews came to view their Greek translation as a tragedy, to rule it out altogether as a liturgical text, and to undermine the earlier texts that spoke of the miraculous nature of its composition.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Emanuel Tov, \"The Septuagint\".

    "content": "# Where did the book Otzrot Hayyim come from?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen the book Otzrot Hayyim recommended as the best first text to use when starting to learn the system of the Ari. When was this book published and where did it come from? References to Kitvei Ha-Ari in seforim usually cite Eitz Hayyim or Pri Eitz Hayyim. Wikipedia says that an additional set of books called the Shmoneh She'arim were published relatively recently, after previously circulating only in manuscript and only in Eretz Yisrael. But Otzrot Hayyim does not seem to be one of the works that made up the Shemoneh She'arim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Arizal hardly ever wrote at all (however, the Cairo Geniza has recently surfaced several piyutim that he wrote while living in Egypt). Thus, his teachings come to us from the students who learned from him during his short time in Tzfat. Most of these teachings were written by his closest disciple, R. Chaim Vital. There are, however, books by other students such as Sefer HaKavanot (R. Trinko), Kanfei Yonah ( R. Menachem Azariah of Fano), and Emek HaMelech (R. Seruk). </p>\n\n<p>The most important, and perhaps most complex, of R. Vital's works are the Etz Chaim books (Etz Chaim, Pri Etz Chaim, and Nof Etz Chaim books). Much of the work deals with kavanot and secrets for mitzvot, as well as laying down the foundations of Lurianic kabbalah. </p>\n\n<p>The Shmoneh Shearim are the \"eight gates\" that are considered less complicated, often go over the Etz Chaim topics, but also range into Tanakh, Gemarah, meditation, Zohar, and reincarnation (they are Shaar Hagilgulim, Hakavanot, Hahakdamot, Hamitzvot, Hapsukim, Maamarei Rashbi, Maamarei Rashbi, and Shaar Ruach Hakodesh). They are each separate works, but generally stick to R. Vital's teachings. </p>\n\n<p>Otzarot Chaim is from another category: those edited by R. Yaakov Tzemach (he was R. Meir Pepperos's student, who edited the Etz Chaim books). It incorporates other students of the Arizal besides R. Vital in framing the system of kabbalah. </p>\n\n<p>The best first texts to approach the Arizal, are the Etz Chaim, Shaar Hahakdamot, and Mavo Shearim (also ed. by R. Tzemach). Etz Chaim is really the foundation of foundations on the Arizal, and according to R. Aryeh Kaplan, \"for one who has mastered the contents of this work, the rest is essentially revealed.\" Shaar Hahakdamot repeats many of themes of Etz Chaim, as does Mavo Shearim (which does mean <em>Introduction to the Gates</em>). Thus, those 3 works are usually the first works studied. </p>\n\n<p>One last note; the very name of kabbalah indicates that such learning need be taught by those capable and fluent in them. A reliable, smicha rabbi is called to the task for one proven to have already filled his stomach with the bread and meat of Jewish sustenance: Tanakh, Mishnah, Gemarah, Halachah, Rishonim and Achronim. B'Hatzlacha!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From getting more familiar with the subject, I've learned that the book Etz Chaim, the most important and most popular book of the teachings of the Ari, was put together by editors from several writings left by Rabbi Chaim Vital. One of the writings was Otzrot Chaim. Whenever in Etz Chaim a passage is marked 'mahadurah tinyana' it is from Otzrot Chaim. These passages are interspersed throughout Etz Chaim (along with passages from the other sources, which are marked 'mahadura kama' and 'mahadura batra'). So, if you have Etz Chaim, you already have Otzrot Chaim, just broken up and interspersed  among passages from other sources. But Otzrot Chaim is also available as a separate book and in this form it has been recommended as a text for people first approaching the Ari's teachings because it is less complex and less discursive than Etz Chaim. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/44605\" rel=\"nofollow\">Otzrot Hayyim was written by Rabbi Chaim Vital Zatzal</a>, the foremost disciple of the Arizal. </p>\n\n\n",

The question remains then, if the gemara considered this as a possibility and explicitly rejected it, why was it later instituted?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> It seems from the Gemara that there are two different periods where there are restrictions. The first concerns laundry (where one opinion says 9 days), and the second concerns meat and wine (where there is no opinion that says that it lasts nine days, the most machmir opinion says that for the whole day one should not have either of these items (and two cooked foods) and the most makil opinion says that one can have these foods, even at the seudah ha'mafseket, but less than normal).</p>\n\n<p>It therefore seems that there are really three related questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why did the laundry mourning period get extended to 9 days</li>\n<li>Why was the meat and wine restriction extended to 9 days</li>\n<li>Why (to the best of my knowledge) was the \"two cooked foods\" restriction not extended to the nine days (the gemara seems to lump meat wine and cooked foods together)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Each of the opinions in the braisa learned their law from the pasuk:</p>\n\n<p>והשבתי כל משושה חגה חדשה ושבתה</p>\n\n<p>R' Meir- we start mourning from the chag of Rosh Chodesh\nR' Yehuda- we morn the entire month\nR' Shimon b. Gamliel- we mourn the entire week</p>\n\n<p>Normally we should only rule like one of the tanaim (The law is usually like R' S.b.G).  Here, we go like R' S.b.G. regarding the start point of that week, but like R' Meir regarding not extending the mourning period past 9-Av.  This goes like no one in the gemara!</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, these are not real drashos.  The tanaim are using the pasuk to clarify a mandatory rabbinic mourning period (asmachta), so the final law need not take the verse into account, only the law.  The gemara then follows the general rule of leniency for mourning periods of R' SbG who limits mourning to that week, and to R'Meir not to extend the mourning past 9-Av- the verse notwithstanding.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot is that the gemara did not make a merit based rejection of the \"9 days\", it simply followed the rule to be halachically lenient by mourning.  Whoever does more- harei ze messhubach, more power to them!</p>\n\n\n",

I am not familiar with Mishna/Gemara/Tosafot/Geonic materials(..yet...) so there could be plenty of Rabbinic views on Nahum, but to me the main reason that Nahum and Nineveh's fate are important is because Judah and Israel were oppressed subserviant tribute-bringers to the Assyrians for the longest period of time--at least 230 years.  King Jehu is shown bowing down and bringing tribute before Shalmanezzar III on his Black Obelisk from 840 BCE. Later on Menachem started paying tribute in II Melechim 15:19.  They oppressed, then destroyed the Kingdom of Israel. According to Pritchard's ANET, Manassah brought tribute and helped get wood for the Assyrian kings' palace. This lasted all the way to 612 BCE, when Nineveh was destroyed.  Nahum assures Jews that no matter how long the oppression is, WE WILL SURVIVE(Thanks, Jerry!) their mistreatment and live to see their complete and utter payback.  Another reason Nahum is important is because he says at the beginning of Chapter 2 \"Keep your feasts Judah, perform your vows\" showing that even under oppression, we should continue to behave as Jews--unlike King Ahaz, who tried to behave more like the oppressor(II Melachim 16:10).  As for Nahum's length, after 230 years of oppression, nowhere near all of it recorded in Melechim, 3 chapters detailing Assyria's misery seems quite fair to me.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does G-d approve or merely permit human consumption of meat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many vegetarians and vegans <a href=\"http://thebeeteatingheeb.com/2012/05/16/does-the-bibletorah-condone-meat-eating-take-a-closer-look-at-genesis-93/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">argue that G-d gave humans permission to eat meat only because of a human failing in abstaining anyway</a>.  My takeaway from that argument is that, in light of a more traditional approach I've heard, that after the Flood, all animals owed their very existence to humans and therefore humans were placed atop the food chain, and since humans could not overcome the temptation to remain herbivorous anyway, G-d granted us the right to eat meat.  I've also heard that in the days of the Messiah, we will no longer eat meat.</p>\n\n<p>But is that really how are to view this permission?  I know a direct parallel cannot be drawn from the fact that G-d asks for animal sacrifice, because we are <em>giving</em> in that case, not <em>taking</em>, and the argument over leather also proves virtually nothing.  Further, it makes it even more difficult for us to budget for our own consumption if we have to <em>sacrifice</em> part of our flocks to G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Yet we have certain statements with the force of Halachah behind them (whether we Pasken like them or not), that indicate that eating meat is spiritually desirable.  I found a reference to Ramban (online, though I cannot trace the source at the moment) indicating that Kosher meat is good for the soul - of course on the other hand, non-Jews are not restricted to such meat, so there's that.  But there is the famous statement that there is no joy without meat and wine, and furthermore a requirement (I'm using that term loosely, although some take it very seriously) to eat meat and fish on Shabbath.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line, is eating meat a <em>good</em> thing, or is it a concession but better not to if we don't have an overwhelming desire to eat meat?  Or is there a middle-ground, that since we have the concession it is something we need not worry about and are free to enjoy?</p>\n\n<p>More food for thought (no pun intended): <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/11014/5\">This answer</a> indicates a necessity to eat meat to distinguish humans from animals (possibly even for the animals' sake as much as the humans').\n(If anyone can help with general sourcing, it would be greatly appreciated.  I've heard R' Kook strongly encouraged vegetarianism (veganism?). If anyone can provide a source for that, I'd appreciate that as well.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>These two articles on Chabad.org break it down well, see them for full details and sources\n:\n\"<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/858870/jewish/Judaism-and-Vegetarianism.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Judaism and Vegetarianism</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2941/jewish/Meat.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chassidic Masters - Meat</a>\"</p>\n\n<p>In short:</p>\n\n<p>Originally, Meat was forbidden, since man was unable to elevate it [<em>When a person drinks a glass of water, eats an apple, or slaughters an ox and consumes its meat, these are converted into the stuff of the human body and the energy that drives it. When this person performs a G‑dly deed—a deed that transcends his natural self and brings him closer to G‑d—he elevates the elements he has incorporated into himself, reuniting the sparks of G‑dliness they embody with their source.</em>]. After the flood, man was able to elevate the meat (either because man, the animal, or the world became more refined as a result of the flood - possibly all 3).</p>\n\n<p>Meat is a luxury, while bread is a staple. As such, one should only eat it when he is sure he will have a spiritual advantage over eating vegetation. As our sages tell us that an Am Ha-Aretz should not eat meat (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=49b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 49B</a>) and that one should never eat meat out of hunger, but fill up on bread first (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=84&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chulin 84A</a>).</p>\n\n<p>However, if one can properly eat meat, it would be cruel for him not to do so, since he is denying the animal the chance to be spiritually elevated. - see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2243/jewish/Does-G-d-Want-Us-To-Enjoy-Ourselves.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This covers the Chassidic/Kabalistic approach. The philosophical approach, presented by R' Yosef Albo, is that originally man was told not to kill animals and eat them, since this is a cruel act. The generations preceding the flood mistakenly understood this to mean that animals were equal to man. Therefore, after the flood, G-d commanded man to eat meat, to remind themselves that they were superior to animals, and had a task to fulfill that was not animalistic. When the Torah was given, animals whose meat had negative effects were prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>According to this, eating meat is \"necessary, but not desirable\".</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/858870/jewish/Judaism-and-Vegetarianism.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>, Rav Kook said that in the Messianic Era, meat would not be eaten, but \"insists that this ideal is not to be assumed as the norm until the coming of Moshiach, when human nature will be completely refined.

    "title": "A fence within a fence",
    "content": "# A fence within a fence\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a well known dictum that a lot of rabbinic enactments were created to 'create a fence' around the major sin; the idea being that if someone does something that would be Biblically permitted but might lead them to wind up doing something Biblically prohibited, better to make the secondary act prohibited, so that they won't wind up doing a Biblically prohibited act (I'm trying to come up with examples, but the only one I can think of offhand is that you're not allowed to tear off leaves from a tree because you might wind up tearing off branches from the tree - feel free to edit this if I got this wrong).</p>\n\n<p>However, there is also an indication (if memory serves) that when we prohibit a tertiary act, we can be lenient in such a case. I.E. If we are worried that someone doing action Z will wind up doing action Y, and as a result will wind up doing action X which is biblically prohibited, we make actions Y & Z rabinically prohibited as well; if someone were to have a doubt about action Z, we have room to be lenient, because this is a 'fence within a fence'. </p>\n\n<p>I then have two questions:\n1) How far down are we obligated to go? In theory, you could add multiple layers of 'fences' (which ultra-orthodox people tend to do, for fear of coming anywhere near a prohibited act), but I can't imagine that these rulings are/should be binding on everyone who wants to follow G-d's law.\n2) If someone were to break a tertiary (or a quaternary - yes, that is how you describe something at a fourth level - etc.) prohibition, are they liable for similar punishment as the primary or secondary prohibition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Generally, the Rabbis enacted decrees that protect us from coming near Biblical prohibitions, but they do not enact \"decrees for decrees\", or what you call \"fences within fences\". There are exceptions to this, but it is a general rule, cited multiple places in the Talmud (e.g. Shabbos 11b).</p>\n\n<p>There are several leniencies that are applicable to Rabbinic enactments, in contrast to Biblical laws, such as how we resolve cases of doubt, and for which considerations we suspend those laws. </p>\n\n<p>The punishment for transgressing a Rabbinic law is almost never identical to transgressing the Biblical law it is intended to prevent.</p>\n\n<p>A person is enjoined by the Torah to enact personal safeguards to protect himself from transgressing Biblical laws, however these aren't binding (unless an oath was undertaken) and are just a fulfillment of a positive command. See Moed Katan (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=12&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">5a</a>) based on a verse in Leviticus (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0318.htm#30\" rel=\"nofollow\">18:30</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You might be referring to the concept of <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.19a?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">דברי סופרים צריכים חיזוק</a>. This means that we are more stringent with regard to rabbinic laws. This would sound as a direct contradiction to the famous rule that we don't mage a Gezeira to a Gezeira.</p>\n\n<p>To answer this we must understand the idea of not making a Gezeira for a Gezeira (a fence of a fence) and Safek Derabanan Lekula (when in doubt about a rabbinic law we take the lenient approach). The function of these rabbinic rulings are as fences. Therefore they aren't inherently wrong. For this reason there is no Gezeira protecting you from the possibility of transgressing the rabbinic law. However, we are very much protective of the law being kept and not being taken lightly.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate this point, if there is a deep cliff near a school the responsible authorities would erect a strong, tall fence to keep people from landing up at the cliff. Now, if the fence got moved there would be no urgency to put it back at its original spot. The spot is arbitrary. It is there merely to make sure nobody lands up at the cliff. Likewise, there won't be any kind of protection from those who manage to reach under and over the fence. We won't either be implementing safeguards to make sure that absolutely nobody ends up <em>by mistake</em> on the other side of this fence, since that is not what bothers us — as long as the marked area is observed.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, anyone tampering with the fence itself or trying to sneak through it would surely be stopped in his tracks. There is no doubt that this person is endangering himself and others by doing away with this fence. </p>\n\n<p>The same applies for rabbinic laws. They might have created more stringencies to express the importance of keeping up the validity of these fences in general, but at individual cases we understand that it is not the spot near the fence that is being protected and that that is not what we came to avoid.</p>\n\n\n",

There are other customs as well, such as additional supplications prior to \"petira\" and prayer for the rebuilding of the temple following \"petira\".</p>\n\n<p>Directly following the \"petira\" we say a prayer \"ose shalom bimromav\", that G-d should grant us peace.

But, the prayer at the end of Shemoneh Esrei is from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 17a</a> (which was added by Mar Bereih Deravina) does not finish with Shalom.  Thus, we added on this \"saying\" which was a standard phrase already (see below), or because this is a \"Giving of Shalom\", whereas the Beracha of Hamevarech es Amo Yisrael is not (for whatever reason). </p>\n\n<p>The Chavrusa Gemara notes suggest that the source of this saying here is the Tur, as they note the Ritva there (could not find it), who has a different wording that was used. \"ויש נוהגין לתת שלום ממש, שהם אומרים שלום לימיני שלום לשמאלי.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, it appears to be much earlier than the Tur, as Rashi in <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=6Z1CAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP19&lpg=PP19&dq=%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%AA%20%22%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D%22%20%D7%91%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D&source=bl&ots=hWmSwQZyOa&sig=4bjY8EZSdCIpVbFLqE0jfVl0SNA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjforHxgIPZAhVDQ6wKHQqxCnI4ChDoAQhIMAU#v=onepage&q=%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%AA%20%22%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%94%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D%22%20%D7%91%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Hapardes</a> seems to have had this wording at the end of Shemoneh Esrei, as does Machzor Vitri, and other early Rishonim.</p>\n\n<p>You asked: <em>It seems to end other prayers as well such as kaddish and the harachamans following bentching. Is there a common thread?</em></p>\n\n<p>There indeed is.  Rashi in the Likutei Hapardes above notes that even in his time, the Passuk ends all of these places, the only question is how it got there.  </p>\n\n<p>One approach is the \"one-by-one\" approach.  It seems to be that there was a reason to end Shemoneh Esrei like this (as above), and that it was somehow transferred to Kaddish, either because the Sha\"tz did not take his steps back until that point (based on the Shitah of the Ri\"tz Gias brought in the Hearos of Yalkut Yosef Siman 56:3).</p>\n\n<p>Based on the Tzlosa Deavraham (siddur, I think) Rav Shmuel Pinchas Gelbard suggests <a href=\"http://shut.moreshet.co.il/shut2.asp?id=104663\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that it was simply moved to Kaddish as a translation of Yehei Shelama Rabbah.  This happens to fit in very well with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13830/16354\">this conversation</a>, based on Rashi (quoted above), who says that this last line was so the Malachim could understand.  (Although it seems more likely that it was taken from Kaddish or Birkas Hamazon to everywhere else, as many earlier sources have it everywhere except for Shemoneh Esrei.)</p>\n\n<p>That explains Kaddish.  For Birkas Hamazon, Mateh Moshe gives two potential reasons for adding in a \"Shalom line\" to finish bentching:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>From the Pesukim in Bechukosai (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 26</a>:4, 6) where it says that God will give rain at the appropriate times, which is followed by him saying that he will place Shalom in the land.  See Toras Kohanim there which emphasizes this juxtaposition (even quoting the words of the Passuk \"Oshe Shalom\" in Yeshaya 45:7), and Mateh Moshe suggests that it is the reason for our juxtaposition.</p></li>\n<li><p>He quotes Chazal (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.27a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagiga 27a</a>) that one's table is considered to be like the Mizbeach, and he notes that the last Korban mentioned in \"זאת התורה לעולה למנחה ולחטאת ולאשם ולמלואים ולזבח השלמים\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 7</a>:37) is the Korban of Shalom (Sifra Vayikra 16).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Note that Seder Rav Amram Gaon has עושה שלום במרומיו הוא יעשה שלום על כל ישראל in Birkas Hamazon and Kaddish, but not Amidah.</p>\n\n<p>Note also that there are a couple of sources that seem to tie this phrase into Aveilus (See Sefer Halachos Ketzuvos from the Geonim Section Nehigas Haavel), which might also be motivation for attaching it to Kaddish, depending on when the connection between the two was made.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The \"general approach\" is the one given in Maseches Derech Eretz Perek Hashalom (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Derekh_Eretz_Zuta,_Section_on_Peace.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna 19</a>), which says that all Berachos end in Shalom, and this was one of the common phrases, a short prayer which could end a paragraph.</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אמר ר' יהושע דסכנין בשם ר' לוי גדול השלום, שכל הברכות והתפלות חותמין בשלום, קרית שמע חותמה בשלום, ופרוס סוכת שלומך, ברכת כהנים חותמה בשלום, שנאמר וישם לך שלום, וכל הברכות חותמין בשלום, עושה שלום במרומיו.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Yet there is discontinuity in the way the days are numbered. The verse says: \"There is evening and morning, Day One.\" But the second day doesn't say \"evening and morning, Day Two.\" Rather, it says \"evening and morning, a second day.\" And the Torah continues with this pattern: \"Evening and morning, a third day... a fourth day... a fifth day... the sixth day.\" Only on the first day does the text use a different form: not \"first day,\" but \"Day One\" (\"Yom Echad\"). Many English translations make the mistake of writing \"a first day.\" That's because editors want things to be nice and consistent. But they throw out the cosmic message in the text! Because there is a qualitative difference, as Nachmanides says, between \"one\" and \"first.\" One is absolute; first is comparative.Nachmanides explains that on Day One, time was created. That's a phenomenal insight. Time was created. You can't grab time. You don't even see it. You can see space, you can see matter, you can feel energy, you can see light energy. I understand a creation there. But the creation of time? Eight hundred years ago, Nachmanides attained this insight from the Torah's use of the phrase, \"Day One.\" And that's exactly what Einstein taught us in the Laws of Relativity: that there was a creation, not just of space and matter, but of time itself . . . Now if the Torah were seeing time from the days of Moses and Mount Sinai ― long after Adam ― the text would not have written Day One. Because by Sinai, hundreds of thousands of days already passed. There was a lot of time with which to compare Day One. Torah would have said \"A First Day.\" By the second day of Genesis, the Bible says \"a second day,\" because there was already the First Day with which to compare it. You could say on the second day, \"what happened on the first day.\" But as Nahmanides pointed out, you could not say on the first day, \"what happened on the first day\" because \"first\" implies comparison ― an existing series. And there was no existing series.

The Shema itself, though, may be recited the entire day.  (Other authorities also allow the recitation of the blessings throughout the day.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A footnote on the last (parenthetical) sentence says that the Chatam Sofer permits the blessings until noon, and the Mishneh B'rurah (58; Biur Halochah) says if one was prevented by factors beyond one's control, he may recite the blessings until noon.</p>\n\n<p>19:1 says of the t'filah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, after the fact, if one transgressed and delayed one's prayers [past the first third of the day], one may recite the Shemoneh Esrei until noon.  This applies even if the delay was intentional.  Though a person who recites the Shemoneh Esrei at this time does not receive the reward of one who prays at the required time, he still receives reward for prayer.

It just seems to me like the Gemara is comparing HaShem to a terribly disturbed king, and Moshe to a worthless onlooker who doesn't want to get involved even though he could save someone's life. Not to mention that it seems to paint Bnei Yisrael as hapless victims of the crazy king's wrath. I thought HaShem was merciful here because Moshe heroically stepped in to save Bnei Yisrael even though they didn't deserve it.

It is similar to the way that we can view the <em>makkos</em> that occured in Mitzraim as tests of faith for the <em>mitzrim</em> and the pharaoh, when Hashem hardened the heart of pharaoh so that he could withstand these tests of faith. When a person fails the test, we call it a <em>beating</em>.</p>\n<p>The Jewish people are compared to a son because of the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.22?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 4:22</a>. The Gemara calls Hashem angry, because he administered the test of the Golden Calf strictly, as Chur lost his life. Many Jews did not approve of the Calf, yet as former slaves, had their spirit broken and were afraid to act, even though the number of violators was small. The test of the Golden Calf was supposed to rectify the incomplete revelation at Sinai, when Jewish people heard only two commandments and ran away.</p>\n<p>The aggadeta speaks of Moshe's silence, in the language of the Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.18?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 4:18</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Do not try to appease your friend (<em>i.e. Hashem</em>) during his hour of anger,</p>\n<p>Nor comfort him (Hashem) at the hour while his dead (Chur) still lies before him;</p>\n<p>Nor question him at the hour of his vow (Hashem tries to make a vow to annihilate Jewish people);</p>\n<p>Nor strive to see him (the beaten son, Bnei Israel) in the hour of his disgrace.*</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moshe is certainly not displaying weakness, he is passing his test as a leader of Jewish people, and he is ready to act, when Hashem offers him to do so.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara asks, that being that the Sea was round, and the area/volume of something round is one fourth that of something square of the same diamater, the Sea should have held 125, not 150 Mikvas. Rashi (s''v Michdi) explains that of the 500 cubic Amot in a block of 10 by 10 by 5 Amot, take away a fourth from the first 400, making 300. And a Mikva is 3 cubic Amot, therefore we have 100 Mikva'ot. Of the last 100 Amot, there are 25 Mikva'ot, \"as each Mikva is 4 Amot, and these four are really three, as they are short Amot.\"</p>\n\n<p>Two questions: Would it not be simpler to say \"subtract a fourth from 100 and you have 75, and each Mikva is 3 cubic Amot, so there are 25 Mikva'ot\"?

They have no connection to Judaism that modern Judaism would accept (without matrilineal descent or an approved process of conversion) and claim that the proof of their connection is that black people found world-wide suffer the curses in Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28, and this defines who is a proper \"Israelite\". They deny, then that modern Judaism has anything to do with who Israelites are or that anyone else who isn't black can claim any connection.</p>\n\n<p>Because they lack any actual familial tradition of connection, and do not practice Judaism, they are not accepted as Jews.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Hebrew Israelite issue is a demonstration of how complete and unfounded wannabism can be turned into a reality.</p>\n\n<p>Towards the end of the 19th century some African-Americans churches who previously had identified themselves <em>with</em> the ancient Hebrews shifted into an identification <strong>as</strong> ancient Hebrews. This movement gave birth to various groups, mostly clear Christian denominations and others that mix Jewish and Evangelical elements in their worship. The <em>Commandment Keepers</em> founded by Wentworth A. Matthew, for example, adopted mostly traditional Jewish worship and lifestyle and kept cordial ties with the mainstream Judaism. </p>\n\n<p>While the Commandment Keepers viewed the non-black Jews as those who preserved Judaism over the centuries many of the present-day Hebrew Israelites accuse the rabbinic Jews of being <em>white impostors</em>. The Anti-Defamation League has accused some groups of promoting black supremacy.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Carter, later to be known as <em>Ben Ammi Ben-Israel</em>, founded the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago in 1966 and moved in 1969 with a group of 30 adherents to Israel. About 600 members have moved after them to Israel where the community in Dimona now counts ca. 2,500 members and reveres Ben-Israel as their \"messiah\".</p>\n\n<p>Many of them clearly state that they are \"Hebrews\" or \"Israelites\" as opposed to traditional Jews. It is unclear up to what extent they follow the New Testament. However they completely deny the authority of the Jewish Oral Law. </p>\n\n<p>Some members of the Hebrew Israelite community in Dimona have converted to Judaism, it is unclear to me what their status is in their strictly closed community after the gijur.

There, the \"evil spirit\" is exorcised (if you will) not by any arcane ceremony, and not by a <em>kohen</em> (\"priest\"), but by the playing of music. (See verses 16, 23.) Seemingly, the \"evil spirit\" was a form of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_%28mood%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">depression</a>. This is, indeed, implied by the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14258&st=&pgnum=134\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>M'tzudas David</em> to verse 16</a>, who writes that \"because of the joy of the sound of the music, the dread will pass\". (That it was \"from God\" (verse 17) means just that — that God instilled it within Saul — but nonetheless it seems to have been some sort of depression, and nothing that begs arcane explanation.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm going to attempt an answer here that will mirror <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18908/5\">the answer provided by msh210</a> and the comments <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18907/did-the-priest-ever-cast-out-evil-spirits/18920#comment46503_18907\">made by Ted</a> (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18907/did-the-priest-ever-cast-out-evil-spirits#comment46544_18908\">and me</a>).  In a nutshell, you are asking a question not based on the verses you cited.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The verses cited do not discuss demonic possession. Those discussing demons are condemning people for worshiping false gods.</p></li>\n<li><p>The verse cited that discusses \"priests\" and \"possession\" and \"casting off\" is discussing the Priests and Levites who were cast off by the king from the land they possessed.</p></li>\n<li><p>The verse that talks about Saul, which you have interpreted to be discussing his being <em>terrified by an evil spirit</em>, is talking about his being filled with dread because he had lost G-d's support and he knew it. <em>His advisers</em> told him that he was possessed by an evil spirit sent from G-d, but he knew in his heart that his reign was over, and he was terrified of what was to come (and, it turns out, rightly so). He asked for someone to play music to calm him down. David was known in the camp for his talent, so they chose him to play music. He was not a priest, and he was not chosen because he could perform an exorcism. There was no ritual being performed here.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In short, I do not believe the Priests (Kohanim) ever performed a ritual exorcism of demons possessing a human. In this answer I am attempting to point out that the idea is not borne out of the verses cited as the basis for the question.  I hope this helps to clear up any confusion in the verses.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I found a relevant section in the <a href=\"http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5942-exorcism\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Encyclopedia</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Josephus (\"Ant.\" viii. 2, § 5) relates:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"I have seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was Eleazar,\n  releasing people that were demoniacal, in the presence of Vespasian\n  and his sons and his captains and the whole multitude of his soldiers.\n  The manner of the cure was this: He put a ring that had a root of one\n  of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac,\n  after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils; and when the\n  man fell down, immediately he abjured him to return into him no more,\n  still making mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which\n  he composed. And when Eleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the\n  spectators that he had such a power, he set a little way off a cup or\n  basin full of water, and commanded the demon, as he went out of the\n  man, to overturn it, and thereby let the spectators know that he had\n  left the man; and when this was done the skill and wisdom of Solomon\n  were shown very manifestly.\" See Ba'aras.</p>\n  \n  <p>Exorcism in Rabbinical Literature.

Under Siman 242, Halakhah 5, regarding the mitzvah to change from weekday clothes into more elegant garments, the editor (R. Yisrael Bitan) added a special footnote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Kabbalists ruled that one must wear white suits on Shabbat. Even\n  so, in our time all the greatest Torah scholars are accustomed to wear\n  black suits on Shabbat, and one should not act differently.

I also just came across an <a href=\"http://www.jewishideas.org/blog/sephardic-rabbis-ashkenazic-garb\">article</a> from R. Marc Angel on the subject. He mentions personally talking with R.

Rakeffet, who explained that R. Ovadia's children went to Ashkenazic yeshivot because those institutions had the highest standard of Torah learning at the time.

Eliyahu noted. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Institutionalized Judaism is largely composed of Ashkenazim, which makes some Sepharadim feel like they need to fit in or dress 'acceptably' in order to be accepted.

I'm not going to quote him in detail because it's long.  In short: she doesn't need to be concerned about her old period, and she needs to be separate starting 3 days after she stops taking the pills until 7 days after she stops taking the pills (temporarily), though she can establish a veset kavua based on the number of days after she stops taking the pills, and then she only needs to separate then.

It all depends on a person’s physical situation and intentions. Napping for pleasure is improper; the day is short and there is much work to do. Napping to regain strength so you can do that work is acceptable. Presumably, all would allow someone who has functioned for days on little sleep to take a nap in order to regain his abilities. The <em>Arukh Ha-Shulchan</em> (<em>Orach Chaim</em> 231:3) points out that the Talmud seems to conclude that napping is permitted and therefore suggests, albeit inconclusively, that this subjective approach was the <em>Shulchan Arukh</em>‘s view.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Appearing to him as an old man, he said, “Where are you\n  going?” Avraham answered, “To pray.” The Satan said, “And why does one who goes to pray need fire and a knife in his\n  hand and wood on his shoulder?” Avraham said, “Perhaps we will stay for a day or two and we will need to slaughter and\n  bake and eat.” \n  Then the Satan said, “You old man, didn’t the Satan tell you to sacrifice your son? A sage like you will go and kill a son\n  given to him at hundred years old? You will be punished for this.” Avraham said, “It was not the Satan, but the Holy One,\n  blessed is He Himself who commanded me to do this.” \n  Seeing that he was unsuccessful in talking to Avraham, the Satan took the form of a young man and argued with\n  Yitzchok, saying, “How many times your mother fasted and prayed to have you! And now this old man has gone crazy\n  and is going to slaughter you.” But Yitzchok said, “I will not go against the will of my Creator and the command of my\n  father.” \n  The Midrash goes on to describe how the Satan took the form of a deep river, but that too did not stop Avraham. Finally\n  he said to Avraham, “I heard from behind G-d’s partition that the burnt offering will be a sheep, not Yitzchok.” Avraham\n  replied, “That is the liar’s punishment: even when he tells the truth, he is not believed. I will do as Hashem commanded\n  me.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The word \"satan\" in Hebrew is the title of a role, not a personal name.

There are several examples of the prosecutor addressing God and being addressed by God in the Heavenly Court, but the prosecutor never speaks directly to a human in Jewish scripture as far as I can tell. </p>\n\n<p>So, from what I can find, the answer is no; there is no source in Jewish scripture of ha-satan (the prosecutor) speaking directly to a person.  Of course, this answer only covers scripture.  There may be allegorical texts (midrashim, aggadot, chassidishe stories, folk tales) that do suggest such an encounter, but there is no such encounter recorded in the Jewish Bible.   </p>\n\n\n",

Yishmael teaches that the word את\nand its suffix are\nunderstood to be reflexive, the other two places being in Vayikra\n(22,16) “and so cause themselves (אותם) to\nbear iniquity and guilt”, and in\nDevorim (34,6) “and he (Moshe) buried himself (אתו)\nin\nthe valley”.</p>\n<p>Therefore, here also the hidden meaning is that they pastured\nthemselves.\n</p>\n<p>The full English text can be found <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Other-Books/Rashi-Terumas-Hadeshen/Vayeishev.html#2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have no source for this: it's my own thought. I've heard that letters with dots are interpreted as if absent. (Citation needed, as they say over at Wikipedia. On the other hand, that seems to be the premise of the question, too.) If <em>es</em> were absent from this verse, it could be read \"The brothers went to pasture. The sheep/goats of their father were in <em>Sh'chem</em>.\" which could imply they were pasturing themselves.</p>\n\n<p>But of course that's a <em>d'rasha</em>: the plain meaning is that they were in fact pasturing their father's sheep/goats, which is why the verse mentions the latter.</p>\n\n\n",

Zinberg). </p>\n\n<p>In the introduction, Hakham discusses the various traditional positions of interpreting the Song of Songs, which include the importance of the holy love between a man and a woman. Because of the beauty in his words, I'm quoting them directly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The very nature of poetry is to portray circumstances more beautifully and more perfectly than they really are.  Here too, the primary goal of the Song of Songs is to present an ideal portrait of the innocent love between a <em>dod</em> and his <em>ra’eyah</em>.  But the descriptions are based on reality. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...it seems that the poet deliberately excluded the explicit form of\n  God’s name from the text.  Possibly, because the poems -- in their\n  literal sense -- were originally meant to be recited as expressions of\n  love between a groom and bride, it was feared that they might not\n  always be recited in purity, and for this reason God’s name was\n  omitted.  It is also possible the omission contains a moral statement,\n  related to Rava’s comment (Mo’ed Katan 18b), that a lover may not\n  solicit divine intervention in the hope of marrying his love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...although the natural, literal sense refers to the love between a flesh-and-blood <em>dod</em> and <em>ra’eyah</em>, by virtue of the fact that their love is wholesome, innocent, pure, and holy, it is worthy of serving as a representation and a model for a more exalted love.  Support for such an approach can be found in the statements of the Sages and Jewish scholars throughout history.  Indeed, while the Sages of the Midrash interpreted the Song of Songs’ love as that between Israel and God, they also interpreted it naturally, viewing the <em>dod</em> and the <em>ra’eyah</em> as two human beings.  For example, in R. Yohanan’s exegesis of the verse, “I have come to my garden, my own, my bride” (5:1; see the commentary, in the poem’s summary section) [In the summary of that poem, Hakham cites Vayikra Rabba (9:6): “The Torah teaches you proper etiquette: A groom may enter the bridal chamber only after receiving his bride’s consent. First, (the bride) says, ‘Let my beloved come to his garden and enjoy its luscious fruits’ (4:16); and only then (in the next verse, the groom responds), ‘I have come to my garden, my own, my bride’ -dsz].  This is linked to the idea, appearing frequently in the literature of the Sages, that all aspects of marital relations are rooted in holiness and allude to holy matters.  For this reason, the marriage blessings include the following: “The barren will surely rejoice when her children return to her joyfully.  Blessed are you, God, who brings joy to Zion with her children.”  From the formulation of this blessing, we may infer that the joy experienced by every bride and groom represents the joy associated with the redemption and the ingathering of the Diaspora.  There are many kabbalistic teachings which take aspects of marital relations as symbols of lofty matters.      </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The fact that the prophets compare the covenant between God and Israel to the marriage covenant suggests that the latter is sacred and noble.  The Sages have said, “If a married man and woman are worthy, God’s presence dwells with them” (Sotah 17a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus, we may conclude, a variety of hermeneutics of the Song of Songs are possible: The literal interpretation, describing the love between a man and woman; the midrashic, referring to God’s love for his people; the hermeneutic which speaks of the devout’s love for God; the mystical interpretation, which is about the love that permeates all of creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wish to thank David S. Zinberg for translating this lovely introduction. </p>\n\n\n",

Also, the Aleinu prayer was composed by Yehoshua bin Nun at a time when there were idol worshipers around, unlike nowadays. Also, it is a very dangerous practice because the nations that we live amongst might think the phrase \"ככל המונם\" refers to them, and as we just explained, Yehoshua composed the prayer for his times.

I know many converts and all of them were required by their rabbis to start doing this fairly early on in the process.  Conversion is in part about joining a community, so you'd better get to know it.  Also, while you can practice prayers on your own, you need the experience of praying in that setting to really start to \"get\" those skills.</p>\n\n<p>Further, sometimes non-Jewish friends of the family attend a bar mitzvah on Shabbat morning.  If it's ok for them, who are there out of friendship and not out of belief, then how much the moreso should it be ok for someone who wants to join with the Jewish people?</p>\n\n<p>It is forbidden for a gentile to <em>fully</em> observe Shabbat (see discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13447/is-it-a-discouraged-or-an-unacceptable-practice-for-a-gentile-to-keep-the-sabbat\">here</a>, thanks @ba).  So long as there is one aspect that you violate, you're not doing that.  If there's no eiruv where you live, carrying your keys in your pocket would satisfy that.</p>\n\n<p>As far as behaving in a synagogue in general, decline any honors that are offered to you (like an aliyah) and you already know they can't count you in the minyan.  Beyond that, you can just do what other people are doing.  It it usually expected that men cover their heads; it's ok to use a kippah to do that.  (Kippot are not restricted to Jews.)  For more on head-covering see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/14679/1569\">this question</a> (thanks @ba again).</p>\n\n<p>I wish you well on your journey.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUWtj1qiFcM\" rel=\"nofollow\">one rav</a>, a goy can keep shabbos without doing a single melecha. </p>\n\n<p>I just thought I'd throw this out there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Only that someone who is not Jewish may not refrain from doing \"work\" in the same manner that a Jew must. Here \"work\" refers to 39 specific categories of of creative work. Someone who is in the process of converting need not publicly break shabbos and your example of carrying something small in your pocket would work just fine, or any of the other 39 categories of \"work\" (malachoh in Hebrew)</p>\n\n<p>As far going to synagogue there is no problem there with the exception one should decline any requests to lead parts of the prayers or to receive an aliya. Also if it a small synagogue to let someone be away not to count you for a minyan. </p>\n\n<p>no there aren't any special rules regarding specific behaviors. Best thing is to focus on one's prayers along with the rest of the congregation (kehilla). If you don't know where to follow along you can ask someone you are sitting next to show you.

    "content": "# Specific punishments for specific sins\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am aware that the concept of reward and punishment is difficult, and often requires a complex understanding.  However, there are places where the Mishna or Gemara claims a specific punishment for a specific sin.  The most well known example is probably found in the second chapter of Shabbat, where it says, \"for 3 sins women die in childbirth: not being careful about niddah, challah and candlelighting\".  Another example is the statement that particular disabilities of children, such as blindness or muteness, are the result of parental sexual sins.</p>\n\n<p>This seems difficult to reconcile with the reality that not everyone who gets these punishments has neccesarily committed these sins.  How do commentators or others deal with this?  Does anyone take these passages non-literally?  If so, what do they say?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7939/jewish/Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Shneur Zalman of Liadi</a> writes in Iggeres HaTeshuva that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But even if one has incurred excision or death, there yet remains an impression within him of his Divine soul, and through this he may live until fifty (in the case of excision) or sixty years (in the case of death by divine agency), but no more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the next chapter, however, he says that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, all this obtained when Israel was on an elevated plane, when the Divine Presence dwelt among Israel1 in the Beit HaMikdash. Then the body received its vitality only through the divine soul, from the innermost source of the life-giving power issuing from the Infinite One, through the Tetragrammaton, as discussed above. But they then fell from their estate, and through their actions brought about the mystic exile of the Divine Presence, This means that the benevolence flowing forth from the above-mentioned latter hei of the Tetragrammaton was lowered far down, from plane to plane, until it became enclothed in the Ten Sefirot of nogah, which transmit the benevolence and vitality through the hosts of heaven and those charged over them, to every living physical being in this world, even to vegetation,  as our Sages state: “There is no blade of grass below that has no spirit [Above that smites it and commands it: Grow!]” Hence, even the sinful and deliberate transgressors of Israel may receive vitality [from it] for their bodies and animal souls, exactly as other living creatures do...</p>\n<p>Hence the statement of our Sages, of blessed memory: “It is not within our hands (i.e., it is not given us) to understand the reason for either the tranquillity of the wicked [or the suffering of the righteous].” The quotation specifies “in our hands,” i.e., in this time of exile after the Destruction</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, there is a spiritual system laid out in the Torah - Do mitzvos and get a reward. Do aveiros and get punished. It worked in the time of the Beis Hamikdash as our physical life and sustenance was given through the \"direct flow\" of G-dliness. Therefore, someone that was punishable for the death penalty in the heavenly court would die right away, as he had no source from which to live. However, nowadays we are in exile, and not just physically but also spiritually. Therefore, our life-force comes through the impure-side (which gets its life-force from the Makkif [the G-dly light which comes through without limitations]). Therefore, we do not always have a correlation between doing mitzvas and reward (and lack of mitzvas and lack of reward).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37941&pgnum=97\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Bartenura explains</a> what the sages are saying with this Mishna.

As a result, many people are strict and won't take their three steps back when finishing prayer if there is someone praying behind them who hasn't finished yet.</p>\n\n<p>A) How strict should you be in this situation? If someone immediately behind you began Shemoneh 'Esreh late and therefore is still near the beginning when you finish, do you really just have to stand there until he finishes? Do the people in front of you have to also (because you haven't <em>completely</em> finished)?</p>\n\n<p>B) If the congregation continues forward with Tefillah are you allowed to continue with them even though you haven't taken your steps back and said 'Oseh Shalom, etc.?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Your second question is easier to answer:  The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=290&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">MB 122:4</a> quotes the Maamar Mordechai that one who is finished with his tefila, but cannot step back because someone behind him is still in the middle of tefilla, \"he may say then even baruch hu uvaruch shemo\".  It sounds to me like you may go on with other prayers as well, but I cannot say that with 100% certainty.  He may certainly say tachanun, since one may make supplications even before yihyu l'ratzon...</p>\n\n<p>Regarding stepping back, although I have heard an opinion that is lenient nowadays (because we have siddurim and nobody has great kavana anyways), I do not know its source.  However, the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=261\" rel=\"nofollow\">MB 102:18</a> allows at pressing times to rely on the Taz who allows someone to walk within 4 amos in front of one who is in the middle of tefilla and stand there, so long as he does not \"pass by\" within that distance. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Regarding part A of the question, the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x229\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beis Yosef in Orech Chaim 102 s.v. כתב</a> cites the Mahari Abuhav as saying that one needs to wait even if the person behind them started after them.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the people in front of you (the person waiting), R' Shlomo Zalman Aurbach (Halichos Shlomo Hilchos Tefillah ch. 8 <em>os</em> 47) writes that the <em>shechina</em> is still \"present\" even after you finish until you take your steps back, which would imply that the person in front is also \"stuck.\" In <em>os</em> 34 he writes that if the person behind you is finished, you could go back for <em>mitzvah</em> purposes. One example of <em>mitzvah</em> that he gives is <em>tachanun</em>, so that would mean that the person in front would not be stuck once the congregation is moving on to <em>tachanun</em>.</p>\n\n<p>R' Chaim Kanievsky, in Siach HaSadeh vol. 3 berachos 10a writes that it is OK to go back if the person behind you is finished as long as you avoid the 4 <em>amos</em> of the person behind him who is not finished.</p>\n\n<p>(Seemingly, this should depend on if the reason one cannot pass someone praying is due to interrupting their concentration (Magen Avraham O.C. 102:6) or interrupting between them and the <em>shechina</em> (Chayei Adam Klal 26, #3). If it is a concentration issue, once they are done there is no more issue. If it is a <em>shechina</em> issue, then the problem persists as long as the <em>shechina</em> is still present.)</p>\n\n<p>The Kesser Rosh of R' Chaim Volozhoner in Hilchos tefillah number 33 says that it is אסור to take the three steps and there isn't an issue of יוהרא (looking haughty) in waiting.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding part B, the same source says that while you are waiting you should say techinos and bakashos, and learning is also allowed.  I would assume techinos extends to the continuation of davening in most situations.  Certainly tachanun.

He has a positive commandment to remain in a Tahor state, and negative commandments not to become Tamei.</li>\n<li>A Nazir who has to restart his Nazir count - and bring an atonement for transgressing a negative commandment of not becoming Tamei- if he becomes Tamei.</li>\n<li>Somebody on his way to bring Korban Pessach - who could get the punishment of Karet if he doesn't fulfil the positive commandment to bring the Korban Pessach on time. </li>\n<li>Somebody on the way to give his son a Brit Mila; a positive commandment with Karet consequences of unfulfilled.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Similarly we see in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00885.html#HtmpReportNum0003_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daf 3b of מגילה</a>  that Meis Mitzvah takes precedence over prohibitions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גדול כבוד הבריות שדוחה את לא תעשה שבתורה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There the Gemara defines precedences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Meis Mitzvah takes precedence over Torah study.</li>\n<li>Meis Mitzvah takes precedence over עבודה - bringing sacrifices.</li>\n<li>Meis Mitzvah takes precedence over Megila reading, despite being Pisumei Nisa - advertising the miracle - which takes precedence over almost everything else.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That said, the Gemara on <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00887.html#HtmpReportNum0010_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">7a in  יבמות</a> mentions that Shabbat observance has precedence over Meis Mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we assume that the Torah forbids an Onen from doing Mitzvoth, nevertheless Kovod HaBrioth would override that - as we see that it overrides positive and negative commandments. </p>\n\n<p>He would therefore be obligated to bury the Meis Mitzva, possibly even at the expense of delaying his own relative's burial.</p>\n\n\n",

Do you know where it is?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think that you are referring to Bereishit Rabbah 21:5.</p>\n\n<p>There, Rav Papus understands the verse to be suggesting that people sought to become like one of the ministering angels. Rabbi Akiva disagrees, and interprets the verse as indicating that they chose the path of death instead of the path of life. Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon understands it to mean that they sought to become like God himself, while the other rabbis understand it to imply that they sought to become like Gabriel. Finally, Reish Laqish suggests that before this point they had been like Jonah, while Rabbi Berekhiah believes that they had been like Elijah.</p>\n\n<p>A number of things about the passage are difficult to interpret, not least among which is how Reish Laqish connects the text to Jonah in the first place. The Maharzav (Rabbi Ze'ev Wolf Einhorn) and the Rashash (Rabbi Shmuel Strashun) connect the word אחד in the verse (כאחד ממנו) with the same word in 2 Kings 9:1, which both Rashi and Radaq connect with Jonah (based on Seder Olam Rabbah §18).</p>\n\n<p>In any case, the language used by Reish Laqish is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ריש לקיש אמר כיונה מה זה בורח משליחותו של מקום שנאמר ויקם יונה לברח\n  תרשישה מלפני ה, אף זה בורח מלקים צווי המקום, מה זה לא לן בכבודו אף זה\n  לא לן כבודו עמו</p>\n  \n  <p>Reish Laqish said [that they were] like Jonah. Just as this one ran\n  away from the mission of God - as it says, \"Jonah arose and fled from\n  before God to Tarshish\" - so too this one [ie: these people] escaped\n  from observing the commandments of God. Just as this one lost all\n  honour [lit. \"did not sleep with his honour\"], so too did this one\n  [ie: these people] lose all honour.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Bereishit Rabbah 21:5</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The notion that Jonah lost all honour is explained by the Maharzav <em>in situ</em>, in reference to a passage at the beginning of the Mekhilta.)</p>\n\n\n",

There are two types of Issuei Melacha of Amira LeNochri. Well actually there are really three but the third isnt really about Amira Lenochri. The third one is the Issur to speak on Shabbos about Dvraim Ha'asurim to do on Shabbos. This applies even if you say I will do this Melacha on Sunday. The speech itself is the Chilul. Because this is the Issur, any type of hinting is OK because hinting is considered thought rather then speech and it is speech that is Ossur, not thought. (Although the Gemoro says MeMidas Chassidus is not to even think about doing Melachas after Shabbos).</p>\n\n<p>The next Issur is to request a non-Jew do a Melacha for you on Shabbos regardless if you benefited from it in the end. It is simply forbidden to request a non-Jew to do a Melacha for you. Therefor the Rema says certain types of hinting are also included in this Ban. This is because if you wink at the non-Jew to do it and nod your head at the air-con fo example, that is considered a request. Speech it isnt, and that is why it is not included in the first Issur, but a request it still is. On that the Mishnah Brurah says that is only by a hint in a tone of command, ie a nod, or put the lid on the cap when you want to refer to a totally different Melacha which the non-Jew understands. Because these are essentially requests, just not spoken, these are Ossur. </p>\n\n<p>However to say that it is not light enough in here, or I cannot put on the light, because you are not requesting at all, however obvious it may be that is your intention, it is not considered a request and therefore one may ask the non-Jew. (Obviusly it must be in a way where there is no benefit from the Melacha of a non-Jew that was done for a Jew on Shabbos, because even when you are allowed to ask a non-Jew to do it, you may not benefit. One way that is consiedered not benefiting, is if he put on a candle for you and there was alraedy some light there so it is not considered a Ha'anoh)!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now for my own hypothesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>I see no reason why it should be Ossur to tell a non-Jew that you are not allowed to ask him to do it on Shabbos. <strong><em>You are not saying it as a request, it is a hint and therefore is in my humble opinion Muttar</em></strong>! (A harder question is to tell the non-Jew during the week, 'why didn't you do that thing last week', this is a debatable topic and is disputed amongst the Rishonim)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Just to add another point, in the specific case you mentioned, there are authorities who permit asking the non Jew directly to turn off the air conditioning, as according to them turning off the air conditioning is only rabbinically prohibited, and one may ask a non Jew in case of need to do something which is only rabbinically prohibited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5762/shoftim.htmlhttp://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5762/shoftim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">There are two prohibitions of Amira L'Akum.</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>To tell a gentile to do melachah</li>\n<li>To benefit from a melachah done by a gentile for a Jew</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first problem can be avoided through hinting, e.g. \"It's cold in here, and we may not turn of the air conditioning.\" Note that the halachos of what is considered hinting vs. saying is fairly complicated.</p>\n\n<p>The second problem is not an issue if it's not considered a true benefit (such as turning of a light to allow for easier sleeping). In the case of it being cold, however, providing heat is a real benefit, so we have a problem.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, there may be room to permit it in this case. Since \"everyone is sick when facing the cold\", it may be possible to be lenient, depending on whether the activity is prohibited <em>min haTorah</em> (Biblically) or <em>miderabanan</em> (Rabbinically), how cold it is, whether there's somewhere else to go to avoid the cold, and whether there are young children suffering.</p>\n\n\n",

The criterion by\nwhich to distinguish between the two fears is that implied in the\nstatement of our Sages of blessed memory (Pesachim 8b), \"Where there\nis a likelihood of danger, it is different.\" That is, <em><strong>where there\nis a recognized possibility of injury, one must be heedful, but where\nthere is no apparent danger, one should not be afraid.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation credits: <a href=\"http://www.rabbisilber.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MESILAT_YESHARIM.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.rabbisilber.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MESILAT_YESHARIM.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I learned from one of my teachers that sometimes the Heavenly decree as to what will happen to a person is dependent on whether he has merits or not. For example, there may be a Heavenly decree saying \"If this person has enough merit he will succeed in his business, if not he will not.\nAdditionally, when one is in a situation of imminent danger more merit is needed to save him from a disastrous result.\nTherefore, one should look before crossing the street so in case he is in a situation where without the danger he might merit continued life and health, but he does not have enough merit to be worthy of being saved from the imminent danger, he should not get himself into a dangerous situation.</p>\n\n\n",

If it is a knife that can only be used once it is sufficiently sharp and you sharpen it, the <em>issur</em> is <em>de'oraita</em> and it falls into the category of <em>makkah bepatish</em>. If it is a knife that does not require sharpening and you have merely done something with it that inadvertently caused it to be sharper, that is only a problem - and only according to some authorities - if doing so is the sort of thing that you would normally do during the week.

This of course means one's private areas, but it also means a shirt, and some kind of shoes for the vast majority of people, and also pants and probably socks for most people as well.  However, it is clear that everything is relative.  <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623&st=&pgnum=244\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The only thing that will invalidate prayer is being nude.</a></p>\n\n<p>Full disclosure: I wear shorts and sandals <em>a lot</em> during the summer, so, although I would not go to an important meeting with my boss in shorts and sandals, if I'm tight on time and won't be able to change, or if I don't have any better options, I feel it is acceptable to wear shorts and sandals, as the \"requirement\" of dressing as before a king is mentioned, even according to the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623&st=&pgnum=244\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah (91:1:3)</a>, as a Midath Hasiduth.  My first preference, if possible, though, is to try to meet that Midah.  Also, when I was younger, I wore sandals to Shi'ur one day.  A classmate asked the Rav if that was appropriate, to which the Rav answered, \"If it was good enough for our ancestors at Har Sinai receiving the Torah, it should be good enough for Seth.\"  The point is, as stated above, it's all relative: you should look dignified when praying.  You should look dignified <em>all the time</em>.  What is <strong>required</strong>, however, is not the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the entire section (Hilchoth Tefillah) cited above is referring to Tefillah, not wearing Tefillin, which msh210 objected to in a comment on b a's answer, but it is not unreasonable to treat the two similarly.  Perhaps a slightly higher standard is warranted if you are doing both, but if you are going to be stricter for a twofer (Tefillin <em>and</em> Tefillah), you should probably be strict all the time (Tefillin <em>or</em> Tefillah).</p>\n\n\n",

I remember seeing an answer somewhere that taste does not come out of something that is alive..]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Tl;dr According to most Rishonim, humans are not included in the Torah’s prohibitions against eating non-kosher animals, and there is no inherent prohibition against eating human flesh. However, there may be rabbinic issues with doing so. There is no unanimous consensus among later authorities.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Dov Linzer writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is human flesh kosher?[13] Halakhah does not classify human beings as animals (if it did, they would be non-kosher, as they do not have split hooves or chew their cud).  As humans are not included in the Torah’s prohibitions against eating non-kosher animals, it would follow that there should be no prohibition against eating flesh taken from a living human being.[14]  This is the position taken by most Rishonim, including Raavad (on Rambam, Ma’akhalot Asurot 3:4), Tosafot (Ketuvot 60a, s.v. yakhol), Ramban, Rashba and Ran (on Ketuvot 60a), and Rosh (Ketuvot 5:19). Rosh and Rashba qualify this and state that there would be a mitzvat prosh, a rabbinic requirement to separate oneself from this, either because it is repulsive (this seems to be the point of Rashba, Responsa 1:364), or because of concerns of marit ayin, when it would look like one is eating non-kosher meat (Rosh 5:19, quoted in Taz, YD 79:3).</p>\n<p>In contrast to these more lenient positions, Rambam rules that while human beings are not “non-kosher,” they are also not “kosher;” one who eats human flesh transgresses the positive Biblical mitzvah “These are the animals that you shall eat,”[15] which is understood to mean “the only meat you may eat is meat which is categorized as kosher” (Rambam, Ma’akhalot Asurot 2:3).[16]  Shulkhan Arukh does not rule on this matter but Rema rules like Rambam that, “It is Biblically forbidden to eat human flesh” (YD 79:1). Although many poskim adopt Rema’s strict ruling, other poskim continue to treat the matter as unresolved or even rule like the Rishonim who are lenient (see Taz YD 79:3, Pri Hadash 79:6, and Darkhei Teshuvah 79:15).</p>\n<p>[13] Another related question is whether there is an obligation to bury parts of the human body that have fallen off or been removed during a person’s lifetime. This could include amputated limbs and organs that have been surgically removed, as well as an embryo after a miscarriage or the placenta after a live birth (in these last two cases there is a question of whether we view these as part of the woman’s body or not; in the case of miscarriage, whether the fetus or embryo requires burial for its own sake). In the case of a limb (ever min ha’hai), Rav Moshe Feinstein (Iggrot Moshe YD 3:141) is of the opinion that there is a mitzvah of burial while other poskim (Noda Bi’Yehudah Tinyana, no. 209 and Tzitz Eliezer 10:25, chapter 8) state that there is no mitzvah of burial per se, but that care must be taken to prevent kohanim from coming in contact with it. All poskim agree that in the case of an internal organ or a placenta after live birth, which is not considered a limb and not a source of tumah, there is no mitzvah of burial or a need to dispose of it in any particular way (see Iggrot Moshe, ibid., final paragraph, and Tzitz Eliezer, ibid., par. 9).</p>\n<p>[14] The law would be different regarding flesh taken from a dead body as deriving benefit from a corpse is prohibited. See Avodah Zarah (29b), Ramban Ketuvot (60a, s.v. hakhi garsinan), Rambam, Avel 14:21, Shulkhan Arukh YD 349:1, Shakh YD 79:3).</p>\n<p>[15] Vayikra 11:2</p>\n<p>[16] Ra’ah (Ketuvot 60a, s.v. katav ha’rav) and Ritva (Ketuvot 60a, s.v. uli’inyan basar) also state that it is forbidden to eat flesh taken from a human.  They argue that it is Biblically forbidden, derived from the prohibition of eating the meat of non-kosher animals. Ritva adds that it should also be forbidden on the basis of eiver min ha’hai, since other than fish and locusts no meat is permitted without shehitah. Responding to this argument, Rashba states that there is no prohibition of eiver min ha’hai or basar min ha’hai in a case where no shehitah has been mandated (in other words, it is no different than fish and locust). See Teshuvot Ha’rashba (1:364) and Ramban, Commentary on Torah, Vayikra 11:3, and also Arukh Ha’shulkhan YD 79:11-12.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-<a href=\"https://library.yctorah.org/lindenbaum/eating-placenta-halakhic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Linzer, Dov. Eating the Placenta: A Halakhic Option?</a></p>\n<p>Rabbi Gil Student <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2007/05/cannibalism/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are at least four different opinions on the subject.</p>\n<p>The Ramban says that when the Gemara learns that eating blood is permissible, it also learns that eating human flesh is permissible.</p>\n<p>The Ra’avad (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Foods.3.4?lang=bi&p2=Hasagot_HaRaavad_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Foods.3.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on Hilchos Ma’achalos Assuros 3:4</a>), the Rashba, and the Rosh (5:19) agree with the Ramban. However, the Rosh adds that the same rabbinical prohibition that applies to human blood (when it is detached) also applies to human flesh.</p>\n<p>The Reah and Ritva say that eating human flesh is forbidden because humans are not kosher animals and that the permission learned in the Gemara does not apply to flesh.</p>\n<p>The Rambam (Hilchos Ma’achalos Assuros <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Foods.2.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:3</a>,<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Forbidden_Foods.3.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:4)</a> agrees that the permission does not apply to human flesh. However, he feels that the prohibition not to eat non-kosher animals does not apply to humans but the positive commandment to only eat kosher animals effectively excludes the option. The difference being that if you did eat human flesh and it was forbidden by a prohibition (Reah and Ritva) then you would be punished by a beis din (rabbinic court) with lashes. If it was only forbidden from a positive commandment (Rambam) then there would be no such punishment from a beis din.</p>\n<p>The Nimukei Yosef agrees with the Ramban that theoretically human flesh is permissible to eat. However, because it forbidden to eat flesh from a live animal (Eiver min hachai) and it is forbidden to derive any benefit from a human corpse, it is impossible in practice to use this permission.</p>\n<p>The Tur and Shulchan Aruch do not discuss this issue and the Rema (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.79.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 79:1</a>) says that human flesh is biblically forbidden (not like the Ramban, Rosh, etc.) to eat (not like the Ramban, Rosh, etc.) but does not specify which biblical prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more on this, see:\n<a href=\"https://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/parsha/is-a-human-kosher/2013/04/04/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/parsha/is-a-human-kosher/2013/04/04/</a>\n<a href=\"http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2006/06/does-torah-permit-cannibalism.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2006/06/does-torah-permit-cannibalism.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Doomsday scenario, what would Hashem do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Lets say John is about to end all mankind by releasing a deadly virus that can never be reversed, cured, or stopped. Will Hashem step in and stop the act? This is a contradiction because Hashem gave us all free will so if he stops the act that isn't really free will. If Hashem stops John, he is basically stopping the test of life. But then would Hashem who loves all his Jewish people allow somebody to end his creation? If Hashem doesn't stop John, will he only save the Jewish people or would he save all the people of the world?</p>\n\n<p>Quantum physics tells us all possible outcomes do occur in alternate timelines. This brings up another question. Let's say Hashem does not stop John from commiting the sin because Hashem doesn't want to break one of his fundamental laws, would we all die or would our spirits get transported into an alternate universe which is exactly the same as this one, but John will not exist there?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>You have several assumptions in your question.</p>\n\n<p>First: \"deadly virus that can never be reversed, cured, or stopped\". It's a basic assumption in your question, but it is not supported. There is no such thing. Just from a biological basis a virus depends on its host to survive, if it kills the host the virus dies too. This balance prevents any virus from getting out of control.</p>\n\n<p>Second: \"Quantum physics tells us all possible outcomes do occur in alternate timelines.\" This isn't true either. First, quantum physics tells us no such thing, it's a theory, but it has not even a shred of evidence except for \"you can use this theory to solve a paradox (specifically single photon scattering)\".</p>\n\n<p>Third: \"all possible outcomes\". Even if the theory is true, all possible outcomes do not occur. Only things that are random at a quantum level are duplicated in this way. But the vast majority of actions are not dependent on quantum randomness and are identical in all universes.</p>\n\n<p>There is a theory (and I VERY strongly emphasize the word theory here, this is a very controversial idea) that free will is basically quantum randomness. Without randomness you would assume that everything is predetermined since all physical interactions are deterministic. Why should a human brain be any different? So what is free will? It's quantum randomness, which is not deterministic. (The alternative non-religious explanation for free will is that there is no such thing.)</p>\n\n<p>Except that free will is actually a function of the soul, and the soul is not subject to quantum randomness, so any action a person takes in one world is likely to be the same in all of them. Including the actions of Mr. John.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth: \"our spirits get transported\" Transported to what? Wouldn't that world already have people in it? And if not, it's completely equivalent to simply stopping John in this world. (How would you tell the difference?)</p>\n\n<p>Fifth: \"Hashem doesn't want to break one of his fundamental laws\" Can't Hashem give a human the power to stop John? Hashem has the ability to do anything, including giving a human the ability to stop an unstopable virus. (The virus was created by man after all - since when does man have the ability to create something absolute?)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>While a person has free choice as to how he behaves, his free choice is only for himself and cannot affect other people. Rabbi Shnuer Zalman of Liadi (<a href=\"http://beta.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7970/jewish/Epistle-25.htm\">Iggeret HaKodesh Epistle 25</a>) explains the saying of Chazal (Zohar I, 27b; III, 179a; Rambam, Hilchot De’ot 2:3): \"One who gets angry is considered as if he has worshiped idols,\" as follows: One of the basic foundations of belief is <em>hashgacha protis</em>, that every event in the world is Divinely ordained. If someone should walk up to me and slap me in the face, that would only have been possible to happen if Hashem wanted it to. Getting angry at the person who did it is likened to <em>avoda zorah</em> because it is as if he believes something else besides for Hashem could have caused it to happen. Sure, the person who slapped me has free choice, he is in the wrong and needs to do teshuva but as far as I am concerned the slap is from Hashem. If that individual would have made decision not to hurt me, <em>\"harbeh shluchim lemakom\"</em>, Hashem has many messengers and someone else would have done it. Free choice does not influence the outcome, only the responsibility. Likewise in your doomsday scenario, while John might have free will, he cannot use it to alter G-d's masterplan.</p>\n\n<p>[Additionally, free choice is only in matters of Torah and Mitzvos - and not in every action a person performs].</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beta.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3020/jewish/Question-4-Omnipotence.htm\">See also this article.</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did the Gedolim achieve fear of Yom HaDin when the Gemoro says daya letzarah beshatah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemoro says (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=9b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 9b</a>) <code>dayah letzarah beshaatah</code>. The way I understand this and I think Rashi learns like this as well, is that there is no point worrying about an upcoming Tzarah. If you can do something to stop the Tzarah, then do it. If you cant, then do nothing. <a href=\"http://www.needaneitzah.com/q/141\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">But either way worry and fear is pointless</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If this is the case, how to we understand how the Gedolim all trembled in fear of the Yom HaDin? Of course, Teshuva is very important especially if one doesn't want to suffer the consequences of Onesh HaDin. But why were they scared. Whatever will be will be. They should make themselves the best plan of action, but should not be experiencing emotions such as fear and worry; they should be telling themselves <code>dayah letzarah beshaatah</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Do not answer my question that the reason why they are scared is because it helps Teshuva. I understand how fear would help the Teshuva process, but they shouldn't be able to get to that fear. Their supreme knowledge and wisdom should stop their fear which they are trying to attain by saying, <code>dayah letzarah beshaatah</code>? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>If the concept of the Day of Judgement is internalized it will naturally lead a person to fear. Humans have emotions. \"Gedolim\" are human too. Let's read the Gemara:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ל הקב\"ה למשה לך אמור להם לישראל אני הייתי עמכם בשעבוד זה ואני אהיה\n  עמכם בשעבוד מלכיות אמר לפניו רבש\"ע דיה לצרה בשעתה א\"ל הקב\"ה לך אמור\n  להם (שמות ג, יד) אהיה שלחני אליכם</p>\n  \n  <p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Go and say to Israel: I\n  was with you in this servitude, and I shall be with you in the\n  servitude of the [other] kingdoms. He said to Him: Lord of the\n  Universe, sufficient is the evil in the time thereof! Thereupon the\n  Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Go and tell them: I AM has sent\n  me unto you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דיה לצרה שיתאוננו בה בשעה שתבא עליהם למה תדאיבם עכשיו בבשורה קשה</p>\n  \n  <p>Sufficient is the evil that they worry about it when it comes upon\n  them; why cause them sorrow about it now with a harsh tiding?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara that says <em>daya tzara besha'ata</em> means that it is not worth telling someone of a bad thing until it is necessary to. It isn't saying that people should suppress their natural emotions. Actually it is implicit in the Gemara that people do not naturally deflect their fears, because if they did, it wouldn't be necessary to hide the bad news.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21194&pgnum=484\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21194&pgnum=484</a></p>\n\n<p>Aimas Yom HaDin comes from the fact that we are standing in front of Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

I find that the shades make the lighting more pleasant to look at (not looking at bare bulbs), and it feels less like Christmas lights (<em>l'havdil</em>).  The strands of bare lights are brighter than the lanterns; each lantern seems to be about as bright as one candle (or so it seemed on Yom Tov when I could directly compare).  I used two strands (totaling 20 lanterns) for my 8x8 sukkah and that produces a nice warm light, but it's not as bright as I'd like so I'll probably add a couple more strands next year.  According to the specs, you can daisy-chain up to 15 strands.</p>\n\n<p>I tie the cords to the sukkah frame with string.  A system of clips could make that faster, but it takes me about 3 minutes to put up my lights so I haven't bothered.</p>\n\n<p>As an alternative, <a href=\"http://costcocouple.com/ge-energy-smart-100-led-icicle-lights/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this strand of icicle lights</a> costs $15, burns only 8W, and generates a lot of light according to Isaac Moses (thanks!).  While I haven't done this myself, I've also seen sukkot that add a single larger light (sometimes LED) suspended from the center.</p>\n\n<p>In the past I've <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4lOEc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrapped</a> the connections (extension cord to plug, plug to plug) in plastic and then taped it tight with electrical tape.  That hasn't caused me any problems.  This year, since I was ordering new lights anyway, I also added these <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002MHFXS8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">water-tight cord protectors</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/US0bi.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/US0bi.jpg\" alt=\"cord protector\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As for operating costs, during chol hamoed I just plug the lights in before using the sukkah and for yom tov I just leave them on.  A timer would reduce the wasted electricity on yom tov if you're concerned about that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This year, I ran an outdoor-rated extension cord (not hard to come by) out a window (through the already-insulated gap where an air conditioner is) to the sukkah and plugged in a <a href=\"http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1vZ1xj1/R-100661441/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053\" rel=\"nofollow\">five-bulb lighting string</a>, also outdoor-rated.

I used this where the lighting string plugged into the electrical cord.</p>\n\n<p>The yellow light does a great job of not attracting bugs. Our ~8'x10' sukkah is comfortably and warmly lit, if a bit yellow* (and probably not as bright as SethJ's dining room). The total power usage is 65 W, and the total fixed cost was ~$85, with all materials reusable in future years (including the CFLs, which ought to last a while). I'm confident that the setup is safe, since everything is outdoor-rated, the sechach provides some additional rain protection, and the CFLs don't emit much heat.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* The yellowness of the light has an interesting effect.

It's worked fine despite all the rain; I'm not concerned about it burning or electrocuting anything; it provided enough light for us to see our food (though it still felt like nighttime); and with fresh batteries and turned on right before yomtov, it was still providing light (though slightly dimmer) 50+ hours later, good enough for the third night of a 3-day yomtov.</p>\n\n\n",

How is it they were \"yotzee\" davening if they couldn't hear the shliach tzibbur?</p>\n\n<p>Look into the Yerushalmi Sukkah Perek 4 Halacha 1 (in my print this comes out on daf 23a a little down from the top.) The version over there the case was that they were leining from the Torah and someone would then alert the tzibbur when to answer Amen on the brachos of Krias HaTorah (according to the Yerushalmi we weren't even talking about Shemoneh Esrei.) Now if one looks into the Karbon Ha'Aeeh you will see this pashut. He does add \"v'ee nami\" on the brachos of the shliach tzibbur. However I think he is perhaps forced to add this pashut in only because of the traditional understanding of the bavli. However I want to say that without the Yerushalmi you can't begin to understand what the case was exactly. Is there any proof there from the Bavli that it's speaking about Shemoneh Esrei davka? It just uses the word \"brachos\" However clear in the words of the Yerushalmi that it's talking about Bircas HaTorah.</p>\n\n<p>From the Rosh in Brachos Perek 7 Siman 17 one could say not like this and that pashut in the gemorah was that it's speaking about Shemoneh Esrei. However he also says there that perhaps the gemorah was speaking about when they were already yotzee davening.</p>\n\n<p>So between Yerushalmi and the Rosh there seems what to be in order to answer this kasha on the gemorah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Saying Misod and Reshut (introduction) for piyutim, then skipping them\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have seen that many yeshivos (and recently, even some shuls) often say just Misod and the Reshus on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and then skip the actual piyutim they are meant to introduce!<br>\nThis is even more evident in Musaf where they say Misod and go directly to Zachreinu L'Chaim. But it's clear that Misod is there because we are introducing piyutim in the first brachos (as is the case with other yotzros on yom tov and daled parshios).  And therefore, on the second day of RH in Musaf, there is no Misod, even though we still say Unesaneh Tokef.</p>\n\n<p>Question 1 - Does anyone know of any rationale for such a practice?  (I understand that the goal is to save time in order to say other parts of the davening more slowly, but saying the first three piyutim (the ones that follow Misod) does not really add more than 2-3 minutes, (and they add so much to the davening.) </p>\n\n<p>Question 2 - If they really need to skip parts of the davening, why not say less stanzas in Melech Elyon, and not lose out on the beautiful piyutim that connect the brachos that we just had a whole long Reshus (\"Yereisi biftzosi\" on first day) to introduce them?</p>\n\n<p>Question 3 - And if they specifically don't want to say these piyutim, why say Misod and the Reshus at all?  </p>\n\n\n",

What is the origin of this 'verse' and why was it placed here in Selichot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 17)\n\n<p>Seconding @Aryeh that this is an excellent question. I did some research on the subject and this is what I've found on the matter:</p>\n<p><strong>Authorship:</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, it seems that the composer of this non-verse is, sadly, unknown. The only source I've currently found who attempts a suggestion on the author's identity is from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzvi_Elimelech_Spira_of_Dinov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech Shapira of Dinov</a> in his book <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4759&pgnum=211\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Regel Yesharah, pg. 207</a>, where he states that it was composed by the Men of the Great Assembly. Personally, though, as I have yet to find any other source stating this, and not even the Yaavetz states this, I believe this was the Rebbe of Dinov's own idea, based on how anonymous prayers are generally attested to the Great Assembly. The idea in itself is not entirely implausible, given how ancient this non-verse is (see below), but the fact that other sources are silent makes it more questionable.</p>\n<p><strong>The composition of the non-verse:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Yehudah Ratzhabi</a> in his essay \"סדר רחמין מתקופת הגאונים לעשרת ימי תשובה\", Sefer Aviad, pg. 317-369, writes that he believes that the oldest manuscript of Selichot we currently have is MS Heb. e.69 and Heb. d.68 (the manuscript fell apart and was accidently put into separate folders), dating to before Rasag's time (!). In <a href=\"https://genizah.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/fragments/full/MS_HEB_e_69_54b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">e.69/54b</a>, the nusach of the verse is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"זכור ה' <strong>חרפת</strong> ירוש'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Prof. Ratzhabi explained that Selichot during that time weren't as organized as they are today, with no properly-set nusach. At the time they were called \"Rachamin\" and were made of a mixture of piyutim, verses, verse targums, verse \"embellishments\" (e.g., הביטה ענינו ה' אלוקינו instead of הביטה ענני ה' אלוקי (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.13.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 13:4</a>) and folk-compositions.</p>\n<p>This particular manuscript, according to notations left by the scribe, was copied from the community's main siddur. This Seder Rachamin was essentially a collection of suggestions of things to say. Many of the Rachamin are written in shorthand because at the time most people remembered all of the lines and verses by heart, or could at least complete when given the first couple of words. Anything that one might happen to not remember could be checked in the main siddur.</p>\n<p>Therefore, this line probably was not just short for \"זכור ה' חרפת ירושלם\" but for the entire non-verse (i.e., the shortening of ירושלם signified more than just that word).</p>\n<p>The question is, what's the original version: \"חרפת ירושלם\" or \"חבת ירושלם\"?</p>\n<p>To that extent, I examined a number of manuscripts. There are six Genizah MSS with variants of this non-verse. Variants (including extra letters) are underlined:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3RAtR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3RAtR.png\" alt=\"table of manuscripts and verse-versions\" /></a></p>\n<p>As can be seen, there's only one MS with \"חבת\" in it, in full spelling: \"חיבת\". According to the Genizah catalogue, this MS is that of Italian nusach selichot that were found in the Genizah. Though not dated, I believe that the MS is significantly less older than most Genizah MSS, because the script style looks almost modern:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kbJ0i.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kbJ0i.png\" alt=\"JTS ENA 2050.9 Italian selichot\" /></a></p>\n<p>As opposed to this Italian MS, <a href=\"https://web.nli.org.il/sites/nli/english/digitallibrary/pages/viewer.aspx?presentorid=MANUSCRIPTS&docid=PNX_MANUSCRIPTS990000834970205171-1#%7CFL24917732\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parma 3536</a>, <a href=\"https://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLIS/en/ManuScript/Pages/Item.aspx?ItemID=PNX_MANUSCRIPTS990000834970205171\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dated to 1297</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4XgOX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4XgOX.png\" alt=\"Parma 3536 MS Italian selichot\" /></a></p>\n<p>If anyone is more knowledgeable on dating script styles, I'd be happy to hear more info.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I believe that the Italian MS is not evidence that the original was \"חבת\" and not \"חרפת\".</p>\n<p>So far, the other oldest European MS that I've found that have this verse are <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=harley_ms_7618_f058v\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Harley MS 7618, f58v</a>, an Ashkenaz (Germanic) nusach:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cdBiQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cdBiQ.png\" alt=\"Harley MS 7618, f58v Ashkenaz selichot\" /></a></p>\n<p>thought to be dated to somewhere in the 13th century, <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=harley_ms_5701_f074r\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Harley MS 5701, f074r</a>, also an Ashkenaz (Germanic) nusach:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8jaPd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8jaPd.png\" alt=\"Harley MS 5701, f074r, Ashkenazi selichot\" /></a></p>\n<p>thought to be dated from the 13th-early 14th century, and <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/manuscripts/NNL_ALEPH000044560/NLI?volumeItem=2#$FL21059608\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machzor Worms (Ashkenaz), vol. 2, pg. 146</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JaXc6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JaXc6.jpg\" alt=\"Machzor Worms\" /></a></p>\n<p>dated to 1280.</p>\n<p>In short, we have four European MSS (three Ashkenazi and one Italian) from the 13th-14th centuries that attest that in Europe, the version was \"חיבת ירושלם\". In all likelihood, it was from here that it evolved into the modern version used by Ashkenazim \"זכור ה' חבת ירושלם אהבת ציון אל תשכח לנצח\" (the Yod in חבת was taken out).</p>\n<p>However, most Genizah MSS attest to \"חרפת ירושלם\", which leads me to believe that this was the original version, while a later European Jew wanted to make the two parts of the non-verse parallel one another (as can be found both in many Tanachic verses and in many lines in piyutim and songs) and changed \"חרפת\" to \"חבת\", to match the \"אהבת\" part.</p>\n<p>Though to us it seems that חבת would make more sense as the original version of the verse, there's actually at least some sense to חרפת. Prof. Ratzhabi explained in the above-mentioned essay that many of the Rachamin of d.68-e.69 mention decrees against the Jews, some having been thwarted, but perhaps not all. As there are similarities between some of the decrees and decrees set against the Yemenite Jews over the centuries, and the scribal notations are in Arabic (but none of the Rachamin themselves), it seems that the חרפה mentioned here may be a reference to fairly-recent (to the time of the composition) events that happened in Yerushalayim. Consider that the Temple Mount was not a place significant to Christians, so it was mostly left alone by them. However, the Arab Conquest of Israel changed the status of the Mount, as it was deemed holy by them as well, which led to the building of mosques on it (see <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). This was a great tragedy, which may be what is referenced here. If it's as ancient as the Rebbe of Dinov wrote it was, then perhaps it came from a now-lost text and was dusted off and placed in the Rachamin, because of said-recent events.</p>\n<p>Now, you might have noticed that some of the European versions feature an extra Vav before \"אהבת ציון\", forming \"<strong>ו</strong>אהבת ציון\". As most MSS don't have the extra Vav, and none of the Genizah ones either, I'd guess that the original version didn't have a Vav and adding the Vav was probably later scribal error.</p>\n<p>Another variant is a change from \"אל תשכח לנצח\" to \"אל <strong>תזנח</strong> לנצח\". It is difficult to tell which version is older. The oldest dated MS, as we saw, is only a short-form of the non-verse and doesn't have this section.</p>\n<p>Lastly, ENA 1968.22 says \"זכור ה' חרפת עבדיך אהבת ציון אל תשכח לנצח\". In some MSS, the verse \"זכור ה' חרפת עבדיך שאתי בחיקי כל רבים עמים\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.89.51?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 89:51</a>) appears directly preceding this non-verse (though I believe it is no longer said in any modern nusach), so I think that in this MS's case, the scribe accidently skipped part of both lines, merging the verse with the non-verse.</p>\n<p><strong>The Tanachic roots of the verse:</strong></p>\n<p>As to what verses it might be based on, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Sadan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dov Sadan</a> wrote an essay on the subject of this non-verse - \"פכים קטנים, ד. חיבת ירושלים ואהבת ציון\", Sinai 87, pg. 282-287 and brought several suggestions for the Tanachic roots of the verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"זכור ה'\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.132.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 132:1</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.137.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 137:7</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Lamentations.5.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha 5:1</a>), \"אל תשכח\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.10.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 10:12</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.74.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 74:19</a>) and the Genizah variant \"אל תזנח לנצח\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.74.1-3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 74:1-3</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.44.24?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 44:24</a>) and similar phrasing in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.9.19?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 9:19</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Lamentations.5.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha 5:20</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Amos.8.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amos 8:7</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sadan, though apparently unaware of the Genizah variant of \"אל תזנח לנצח...\", thought that this was the original ending of the non-verse. It's possible, though as I said, it's difficult to know which one is older.</p>\n<p>Other verse suggestions were brought in the book <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41596&st=&pgnum=300&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Areshet Sefateinu, pg. 265</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99#%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%95%D7%98%D7%99%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Nachum Meir Bronznick</a> in his book \"פיוטי ייני - ביאורים ופירושים\", vol. 2, pg. 22, wrote that he thinks this non-verse was based on \"יבחר לנו את נחלתנו את גאון יעקב אשר אהב סלה\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.47.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 47:5</a>), however he writes this based on the \"חבת\" version and makes no mention of the \"חרפת\" version. He finds parallels between סלה and נצח and suggests there's evidence that Eretz Yisrael is sometimes known as Yerushalayim.</p>\n<p><strong>What is it doing among real verses?</strong></p>\n<p>As Prof. Ratzhabi explained, there were different types of Rachamin, but no set nusach. Some Rachamin were entirely blocks of verses, some were entirely non-verse piyutim and some were mixtures. As we can see from the older Genizah MSS, this non-verse was originally part of a section that was a mixture. It seems that at some point, the זכור ה' verses and non-verses were set apart, forming a new Rachamin. From there it eventually became part of the Ashkenazi Vidui.</p>\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Heinemann</a>, as brought by @Argon (see <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23594785.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ae18e4aea97719f4fe4f170a6644bb452\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), thought it was inserted to even up the numbers of זכור verses, I don't believe this was the case, because זכור verses as standalone sections were comprised of varying numbers of verses (compare different MSS and nusachim) - 2, 4, 6, etc. Moreover, we see that it wasn't originally part of a זכור-only section in the early Gaonic period. A זכור section first appears in the mid-Gaonic period, in Seder Rav Amram Gaon:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OwyzJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OwyzJ.png\" alt=\"זכור verses in Seder Rav Amram Gaon\" /></a></p>\n<p>And a זכור section also appears in the slightly-later Siddur Rasag. A variant of the Rachamin of his siddur which also includes our non-verse appears in <a href=\"https://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/Hebrew/digitallibrary/pages/viewer.aspx?presentorid=MANUSCRIPTS&docid=PNX_MANUSCRIPTS990001081230205171-1#%7CFL28748779\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MS JTS 4284</a>, pg. 14. The copying was finished in the year 1605 CE. According to Prof. Ratzhabi, this was probably done in Turkistan. It's important to note that neither Rasag nor Rav Amram Gaon intended for their orders of the Rachamin to be any sort of final version that everyone must follow. Rasag states in his siddur (Mekitzei Nirdamim edition, pg. 264), in the introduction to that section that (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And now that most have accepted upon them the custom of saying piyutim of Yom Kippur in the prayer of the Tamid and this doesn't damage the prayer, I will write down for Yom Kippur three piyutim, one for Tamid and one out of two - whatever is chosen - for Mussaf. And then I'll write also 23 selichot, 13 for Tamid and 7 for Mussaf and 3 for Neilah, in short-form, and I'll write long Rachamin, that it is not acceptable to divide them and to say some in Tamid and some in Mussaf, but it is acceptable to divide them in a set order and to say some of them at dawn during every one of these ten days of the month of Tishrei, and to also pick out some of them and to say during every fast that is set on a weekday, and saying more or saying less depends on the wish of the person who says them for he can say as much as he wants.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>One last note:</strong> Prior to reading @DoubleAA's comment that it would be cool if this came from an apocryphal work, the idea had already occurred to me, along with two other possibilities: a. The Dead Sea Scrolls and b. The Karaites.</p>\n<p>I did several searches in the DSS (<a href=\"https://maagarim.hebrew-academy.org.il/Pages/PMain.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מאגרים</a> was very useful, they have almost all of the DSS transcriptions) but sadly nothing came up. I didn't search all of the apocryphal works. I focused on works where it would make sense that it might be in, such as Tobit, ben-Sira and the additions to Daniel. Finding the non-verse in apocryphal works still isn't sure-proof because it all comes down to what the original Greek said and how the translator decided to translate it (I once came upon an old Hebrew translation of ben-Sira (I think it was from Greek, but I'm not entirely sure) where it seems that the translator decided to include in the text wise teachings from Chazalic sources he thought were related to the subject matter). Lastly, I started going through some Karaite works. I went through about 3-5 machzorim. Most didn't have any sections of זכור, except for one, <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/books/NNL_ALEPH001103403/NLI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סדר התפילה למנהג קהל הקראים</a>, from Venice, 1528:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oK1jO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oK1jO.png\" alt=\"Karaite זכור verses\" /></a></p>\n<p>As can be seen, they didn't include this verse.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For the time being (while still considering whether a more serious revision is in order), I will leave this point as a note. Originally, I was convinced that the Genizah evidence and Ratzhabi's arguments are evidence enough that the original form of the non-verse was זכור ה' חרפת ירושלים etc. However, since then, having learned more about the issue of the mysterious origins of Ashkenazi prayers and customs, as well as learning about the almost equally mysterious ways in which sources are preserved over the ages, I am no longer convinced that there is clear evidence to suggest which version is the original. It seems equally possible that זכור ה' חבת ירושלים is the original, but for reasons beyond our understanding came to only be preserved in Ashkenazi rites.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Great question! I do not know the history of its placement in the selichot (and I'm not familiar with the piyut since I recite the Sephardic selichot). </p>\n\n<p>Regarding its origin, I would guess it comes from Yeshayahu 62:6-7:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עַל-חוֹמֹתַיִךְ יְרוּשָׁלִַם הִפְקַדְתִּי שֹׁמְרִים כָּל-הַיּוֹם וְכָל-הַלַּיְלָה תָּמִיד לֹא יֶחֱשׁוּ <strong>הַמַּזְכִּרִים</strong> אֶת-יי אַל-דֳּמִי לָכֶם. וְאַל-תִּתְּנוּ דֳמִי לוֹ  עַד-יְכוֹנֵן וְעַד-יָשִׂים אֶת-יְרוּשָׁלִַם תְּהִלָּה בָּאָרֶץ</p>\n  \n  <p>On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen; all day and all\n  night, they shall never be silent; those who remind the Lord, be not\n  silent. / And give Him no rest, until He establishes and until He\n  makes Jerusalem a praise in the land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These watchmen, as <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14257&st=&pgnum=471\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi explains</a>, are the ministering angels who remind God to rebuild Jerusalem. He's quotes Menachot 87a, which also references pesukim on mercy for Zion. Then he comments on \"appointed watchmen\" as a reference to being written in a book of remembrances. </p>\n\n<p>In light of the Rashi, it sounds quite appropriate to recite some derivation of it as we approach Rosh Hashanah, if you ask me!</p>\n\n<p>Also, in Yechezkel 16:60, God tells Jerusalem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וְזָכַרְתִּי</strong> אֲנִי אֶת-בְּרִיתִי אוֹתָךְ, בִּימֵי נְעוּרָיִךְ; וַהֲקִימוֹתִי לָךְ, בְּרִית עוֹלָם</p>\n  \n  <p>But I shall remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I shall establish for you an everlasting covenant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then in 60:63:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לְמַעַן תִּזְכְּרִי, וָבֹשְׁתְּ, וְלֹא יִהְיֶה-לָּךְ עוֹד פִּתְחוֹן פֶּה, מִפְּנֵי כְּלִמָּתֵךְ--<strong>בְּכַפְּרִי</strong>-לָךְ לְכָל-אֲשֶׁר עָשִׂית, נְאֻם אֲדֹנָי יי</p>\n  \n  <p>In order that you remember and be ashamed, and you will no longer have an excuse by reason of your humiliation, when I forgive you for all that you have done,\" says the Lord God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe I shouldn't read too much into B'Chapri, but it did jump out. There are other pesukim on God remembering Jerusalem/Zion, ie., Yeshayahu 49:14-18. Then again, these are just my speculations.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Too long for a comment:</p>\n\n<p>Footnote 34 in Heineman's \"The Ancient 'Orders of Benedictions' for New Year and Fasts\" (Tarbiẕ, 1976), argues that the non-Biblical verse was inserted to have a complete ten verses.

This is only true if the one saying the blessing is not fulfilling his obligation then as well. In the vast majority of cases where the one saying the blessing is fulfilling his obligation with you, you can fulfill your obligation by simply listening to the entire blessing. (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2501.htm#11\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Brachot 1:11</a>, see also R. Akiva Eiger to OC 219:5) I note that the former case (fulfilling someone else's obligation without doing so yourself) is not allowed in general for food blessings except those which directly relate to Mitzva food (eg. Kiddush, Matza at the Seder). (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2501.htm#10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Brachot 1:10</a>, <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A1%D7%96#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.9B\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch OC 167:20</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, in order for a listener to fulfill his obligation, both the listener and the speaker must intend for that to happen. Additionally the listener must hear every single word (not just the end). Both these statements are true even if the listener said Amen. (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%92#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 215:3</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Now in terms of your second question, the answer will depend on the one saying the blessing's intention: if his intention is to fulfill the obligation of anyone who needs (as is the general assumption in the case of a Chazzan) then you can fulfill your obligation if you hear the whole thing etc. But if his intention is just for a specific group of people, then only those people can fulfill their obligation. (parallel to <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A4%D7%98#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 589:9 and MB sk 17</a>) As for how to determine the intent of the one saying the blessing at the other table, I'm not sure and you might just have to ask him. It seems to me to be a good practice to always have anyone who wants to fulfill their obligation in mind when you say blessings in case someone tries to fulfill his obligation without realizing he needs to be careful for this. As above, if you ever don't want to fulfill your obligation with this blessing just don't intend to; problem solved.</p>\n\n<p>Finally as to your first question, the Shulchan Aruch rules (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%98%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 215:2</a>) that if one hears an entire blessing from a believing Jew even if one does not intent to fulfill one's obligation with it, one is obligated (חייב) to say Amen. (I phrased that very minimalisticly; there are other instances where Amen should be said but I don't want to complicate this answer any further.) Moreover, the Gemara says (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=53b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Brachot 53b</a>) that the one who answers Amen is greater than the one who said the blessing! The Rashba (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1379&pgnum=131\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shu\"t 5:53</a>) explains this to mean that a praise of God is not complete without others confirming it, similar to a contract which needs signatures of witnesses to make it complete. In this way, the one answering Amen is doing more than the one saying the blessing could have done on his own.</p>\n\n\n",

So, if the answer to my first question is \"it applies even to something used once\", then how do we take someone's <em>talis</em> and lay it out for a <em>sefer Tora</em> to be read on (as is frequently done on <em>Simchas Tora</em> and in a mourning house)?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is there a custom to join \"Hashem\" and \"Elokenu\" together in the line Al Taazvenu in Shema Kolenu in Selichot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Shema Kolenu, based on the Posuk in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c2638.htm#22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psalms 38:22</a> we say the phrase:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Al Taazvenu Hashem Elokenu Al tirchak mimenu | Don't leave us Hashem Our God Don't distance yourself from us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The interesting thing is that, although it seems many people have a custom whilst reciting this phrase to join the words <code>Hashem</code> and <code>Our God</code> together and put a comma after the word <code>God</code> (and, indeed, there are Siddurim that have a comma at this point in the text), this appears to be incorrect. When one checks the Posuk that the phrase is based upon in the Tehillim, there is a break after the word <code>Hashem</code>, and the phrase <code>Our God</code> is part of the next clause.</p>\n\n<p>The way most people seem to have a custom to say it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't leave us Hashem Our God; don't distance yourself from us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The (seemingly) correct way, following the verse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't leave us Hashem; Our God don't distance yourself from us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I always thought people were just ignorant of the fact that that it is not joined in the Posuk. But when I heard a Choshuve Rov daven for the Amud and he said that together, I had to ask him what is the Pshat. He told me that he knows that it is not the correct way according to the Posuk, but he has a minhag to say it like that, and that it might possibly come from Muncatch. He could offer no further details. </p>\n\n<p>Can you tell me when this Minhag started and who started it?<br>\nCan you tell me why this Minhag started?<br>\nOr have you got another reason to judge favourably the thousands of Yidden who otherwise seem to be reading it wrong?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This seems to be a question of whether both names are being invoked for both pleas, or whether each plea gets its own name.</p>\n\n<p>Is seems difficult to bring a proof from the Passuk itself, as i'm assuming that the OP is referring to the Taamim, and the Taamim are tricky in Tehillim. Also, it would seem that even though there is indeed a hisnachta under HaShem, there is an azla-geireish under Elokai, which indicates a phrase for itself, so I am not so sure if the Hisnachta is such a good proof in this case, since the word Elokai also has a phrase-ender so to speak (correct me if i'm wrong).</p>\n\n<p>This brings it down to the Meforshim, to see if they split up the names or not.</p>\n\n<p>The Radak and the Alshich do explain that Al Taazveini is a plea to the name Hashem, and Al tirchak mimeni is a plea to the name Elokai.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand the Malbim bunches both pleas together without pointing out any separation. Moreover, and perhaps the best source for this minhag to put the two names together, the Rokeach (Rabbi Elazar of Worms, circa 1160-1260) in his commentary on the siddur, clearly puts the two names together:</p>\n\n<p>פירושי סידור התפילה לרוקח [סט] אנא מלך חנון ורחום עמוד שפט\nאל תעזבינו ה' אלהינו אל תרחק ממנו הואיל ואתה חוזק שלנו ואלהינו, אין לך \nלעזבינו בצרותינו ולא לירחק ממנו. </p>\n\n<p>\"Since you are our strength and our God (Elokeinu), you must not forsake us in our angst, nor must you not distance yourself from us.\"</p>\n\n<p>This would clearly require a reading of the passuk the way the minhag is according to the OP.</p>\n\n\n",

If you see a flaw with the walls themselves, feel free to point it out in the comments, but also realize this is an academic question, as I do not intend to purchase two, or even one, of these products, given the cost, and I'm just curious about what is valid vis a vis a gap in a wall.

Some say he needs to put a gateway (tzurat hapetach) across that gap (A). If he wants he can put a larger solid wall (3) and a smaller gap (A) (even zero gap) so long as the solid wall (3) makes it at least seven tefachim (the minimal length of a full wall) from the side wall (1). (Shulchan Aruch OC 630:3) This is true if the gap (Gap B) from the short wall (3) to the far side wall (2) is less than 10 amot. If it is more than that it (B) requires a tzurat hapetach, although the Rambam says that a tzurat hapetach only works on a gap (B) of more than 10 amot if the 'short wall' (3) is of greater length than the total gap (A+B).

It seems pashut from the Shulchan Aruch that one who converts is considered a \"tinok shnolad\" and therefore has no obligation to mourn for their parents. Therefore it seems obvious to me that aninus is definitely not an issue. The question is that if a convert in that situation would wish to mourn could they mourn and to what extent. The Taz seems to indicated that one may willingly mourn for someone as long as they accept the mourning completely and do not transgress any negative commandments in the process.

Halacha specifically recognizes internal emotion as a separate sphere or mourning and chooses not to regulate it in this case. It would seem that anninus would be entirely appropriate in your case, but you already knew that. :)</p>\n\n<p>I had an unfortunate situation in a slightly different direction. The direction given us was that no minyan could be held, we could not call our open-house a \"shiva,\" and there were no requirements of shiva placed upon the relatives. It was... okay, I guess. The guideline was passive behaviors were permitted, active ones were not.</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, we could voluntarily chose to observe customs of shiva without a formal acceptance since that has no real halachic import.

And with regard to that which is stated about Shabbat, “And you shall honor it,” Rav said: To honor Shabbat, make the Shabbat feast earlier than on other days, in order to show that one delights in eating it.

Maimonides reasoned that the bleeding and loss of protective covering rendered the penis weakened and in so doing had the effect of reducing a man's lustful thoughts and making sex less pleasurable.

It is done to \"quell all the impulses of matter\" and \"perfect what is defective morally.\"</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This commandment has not been enjoined as a complement to a deficient\n  physical creation, but as a means for perfecting man's moral\n  shortcomings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>2. that it weakened the penis</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and to weaken the organ of generation as far as possible</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>3. had the effect of reducing a man's lustful thoughts and making sex less pleasurable.</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt\n  that circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and\n  sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><em>4.

This is also from the same chapter in the Guide:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No one, however, should circumcise himself or his son for any other\n  reason but pure faith; for circumcision is not like an incision on the\n  leg, or a burning in the arm, but a very difficult operation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Whoever accepts upon himself, in front of three Torah scholars not to worship idolatry — these are the words of Rabbi Me'ir. And the rabbis say: Whoever accepts upon himself the seven commandments which the sons of Noach accepted upon themselves. And others say: None of these are a ger toshav. A ger toshav is whoever accepts upon himself all the commandments except not to eat <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9251/1569\">neveilah</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&hilchos=27&perek=14&halocha=7&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isurei Biah 14:7</a>) rules like the rabbis, and adds that he's called a \"ger toshav\" (lit. resident stranger) because he's allowed to live in the Land of Israel with us.</p>\n<p>The term \"ben Noach\" (son of Noah) is often used as a synonym for ger toshav, but the difference between the two, as far as I know, is not clearly delineated anywhere. The literal meaning of the term is any descendant of Noah, but the Rambam (Melachim 10:3,10) uses it specifically to refer to someone who accepts the laws of Noah, apparently synonymously with the term ger toshav (brought to my attention by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20541/1569\">Tamir Evan</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As noted by @ba there are three views in Avodah Zarah 64b. R. Meir holds that the ger toshav commits to not worship idolatry, the rabbis include all seven commandments, and \"others\" hold that he keeps all mitzvot except for the consumption of <em>nevelah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As noted, Rambam (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/5114.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Issurei Biah 14:7</a>) sides with the rabbis. It should be noted that other Rishonim side with R. Meir, e.g. apparently Rashi (Bava Kamma 113b s.v. ger toshav).</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted, that there was another view; which is not the \"accepted view\" that the ger toshav <em>must convert within a year</em>! R. Shaul Lieberman z\"l discusses this in his <a href=\"http://www.massorti.com/IMG/pdf/liberman_midrash_teiman.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Midr'shei Teiman</em></a> (p. 8).</p>\n\n<p>While present in several Midrashim that he cites (such as Midrash Lamed Beit Middot p. 374), it is almost absent from the Talmud. The closest we find is R. Yohanan (Avodah Zara 65a) who could be understood as having espoused this view. However, the Talmud there rejects interpretation of the words of R. Yohanan. Nevertheless, it appears that the Yerushalmi understood R. Yohanan as requiring a ger toshav to convert within the year (cf. Yerushalmi Yevamot 8:1).</p>\n\n<p>This fascinating view is implied by the Bahag (Hilkhot Milah) as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I see no one has answered you in the context of the scripture that you cited. Your Rabbi is right; but, see in scripture whenever it's speaking of the ger it means convert, but the foreigner can be a bnei Noach if he lives in the land of Israel, or just a foreigner that obeys the 7 just for the wisdom in them, but the later is no bnei Noach because he's not doing it to join himself to HaShem. They are only called the wise of the nations. The foreigner starts becoming a stranger when he seeks to do more and more mitzvos. A stranger is the one that has it in his mind to be a full citizen, were as the foreigner does not. Nor does he have the rights of a full citizen. He is under common law or universal law, were as the stranger is under Israeli national law. As shown in Exodus 12.43. </p>\n\n<p>Then we see when it speaks of keeping pesach the stranger is mentioned to keep it but not the foreigner Exodus 20.10. You should also know that when the stranger is singled out; with words like don't abuse/mistreat them, it simultaneously also means the foreigner, evidence being the following words \"you were strangers in the land of Egypt\". Where the Israelites converts in Egypt? No, maybe some but not for the most part. All the do and don't do to the stranger commandments always apply to the foreigner too. You have to be a foreigner to get labeled stranger. But when it says foreigner that strictly means the one who is not a citizen, even if he is in the process of conversion.</p>\n\n<p>Now Isaiah's sermon can be understood with this in mind. By saying foreigner he can address everyone and linking them with proper paralleling subject as we have it outlined in the Torah. Watch the clever thing he throws in there. Let not the foreigner say, who has attached himself to GD say \"GD will keep me apart from his people.\" In the temple there was a separation wall. A court for the foreigners, how do we know here, it means stranger. Because the stranger is addressed alongside the eunuch, just as in Exodus 22.20-.21 but with widows and orphans. Orphans because according to HaLacha the convert has no parents. A woman convert addressed with the widow in the passage given above, because she may never find a husband, so Isaiah expounded on the teaching by speaking of the eunuch and the one in process to converting in the same sentence. It's an encouragement to them. And yes even the true Beni Noach must keep shabbat. I know you heard otherwise but only the gentile idol worshipers. </p>\n\n<p>It says Takumim that keep the sabbath merit the death penalty. Why then do we make those taking conversion classes do something to not keep it perfectly. It's a hedge [Takanot] [enactment] to protect them. Remember he can change his mind at the very last minute about converting. Let's say he goes back to idol worshipping? That means an idolater has desecrated the Shabbat of HaShem. Its the reality of our world. Now I seriously doubt that bnei Noach ever kept shabbat in the manner of a Jew. He simply did not work his occupation. Notice the eunuch is keeping Shabbat, now we know that a man with crushed testicles can't become a part of the national congregation. Obviously it's a way of addressing the bnei Noach since the bnei Noach is like the eunuch in a small ways. That is that he has an issue in regards to his private area that keeps him out of the congregation. Obviously he's talking two different covenants because he's saying both that hold fast to my covenant but I just don't know enough to address the Shabbat keeping.</p>\n\n\n",

Concentration of the entire\nhuman race in a single location created the possibility of sudden extinction. A localized natural\ndisaster could destroy the entire species. Through dispersing humanity the impact of a localized\nnatural disaster was diminished. Should a specific location experience a devastating disaster,\nonly a portion of humanity would be destroyed. The remainder would survive.\nRalbag makes another important point. He discusses the manner in which the Dispersion was\nbrought about.

Why did they wish to create a single monolithic society?  Sforno seems to say that the objective was to empower a single ruler over all of humanity.  This would be accomplished through two steps.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A great capital city would be built.  </li>\n<li>The people would share a single religion, culture and language.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sforno explains that Hashem opposed the creation of a universal form of idolatry.  The pervasiveness of the shared religious beliefs discourages any individual from seeking an alternative theology.  This is for two reasons.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The psychological pressure to conform to a universal theology would be            tremendous.</li>\n<li>Anyone challenging a universal set of beliefs would be a pariah and could not hope to find refuge anywhere.  He would be hunted down and destroyed. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These factors precluded the development of a person like Avraham who would seek the truth.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the existence of multiple religions contributes in finding Hashem.  First, in a world with multiple religions, it is natural for a person to question the credibility of the various perspectives.  Second, the development of multiple cultures and societies would provide the opportunity for a dissenter to find refuge.  When rejected from one society, he could find refuge elsewhere.  In short, the Haflagah contributed to the development of Avraham. As a result of these considerations, Hashem caused the Dispersion.  This, in turn, produced a variety of cultures and religions.</p>\n\n<p>ספורנו עה\"ת ספר בראשית פרק יא פסוק ד \n(ד) ויאמרו הבה נבנה לנו עיר. זאת הית' עצת שרי הדור להמליך את נמרוד על כל המין האנושי: ומגדל וראשו בשמים ונעשה לנו שם. נעשה שם שתהיה במגדל ויצא בכל המין האנושי שם גובה מקומה וגודל עירה באופן שתחשב אלהי האלהים אצל כל בני האדם ואליה ידרשו כלם. והכונה בזה היתה שהמלך על אותה העיר ימלוך על כל המין האנושי בהיות שם דרישת כלם:</p>\n\n<p>ספורנו עה\"ת ספר בראשית פרק יא פסוק ו \n(ו) הן עם אחד. כי אמנם הבטול המפר עצות ומניא מחשבות הוא המחלוקת הקורה אם לסבת הדתות ואם לסבת הלשונות. והנה אלה היו עם אחד בענין הדת כי היו כלם מסכימים בדעת אנשי הצא\"בה ועם זה היה כלם מסכימים בלשון: וזה החלם לעשות. וגם כן נמצאה לכלם עתה זאת ההתחלה שעשו בהסכמת כלם: ועתה לא יבצר מהם. אם כן אין מונע להם מהשלים כונתם ותהיה אותה עו\"ג אשר יבחרו כללית לכל מין האדם ולא יפנה אחד מהם לדעת את הבורא ית' ולהבין כי יוצר הכל הוא. והפוך זה יקרה כשתהיה מחלוקת בענין האלהות כי כל אחד יחשוב שיש אלהי האלהים שכל האלוהות מסכימי' לדעתו ובו ישלם סדרם וסדר המציאו' כאמרו כי ממזרח שמש ועד מבואו גדול שמו בגוים:</p>\n\n\n",

I would think that wine means a fermented grape product, or at least a fermented fruit product. On what basis do so many people use grape juice instead of wine for rituals like Kiddush? If there's a leniency to allow something similar to wine (viz, grape juice), why not other things that are similar to wine (e.g., fermented pomegranate juice (aka pomegranate wine) or plum wine)?</p>\n\n<p>I know there are some times when we are less particular generally and allow whiskey or even orange juice.</p>\n\n<p>I'm asking about those times when we are particular to have wine, yet we still allow grape juice, albeit sometimes begrudgingly.

A mixture of grape juice and water is fit for kiddush so long as its blessing is that of grape juice/wine.

Theverse in Tehilim is speaking about שכר and teaching that one should trust that this reward is not lacking. On the contrary, the פרס is the reward that is negotiated by the worker. For example, a Kohen would grab a <em>pras</em> of ketores to burn in the morning and <em>pras</em> in the afternoon, or <em>peres</em> is a bird of prey that tears its prey by feet.

This accords with the pasuk quoted in Michoel's answer (Nechemyah, 8:10). </p>\n\n<p>Because of those opinions that fasting is appropriate, the Shulchan Aruch writes (based on the Agur) that if someone fasts once, it is considered that he has accepted that practice and he must subsequently fast on every Rosh HaShanah. The Rema writes that he should get the custom annulled instead.  Notably, R' Yosef Karo in <em>Maggid Meisharim</em> praises the custom of fasting on the first day of Rosh HaShanah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33143&st=&pgnum=94&hilite=\">Siman 40</a>). I have heard that this encouragement to fast was relegated to the <em>Maggid Meisharim</em> because R' Karo felt that fasting is only an appropriate approach for rare individuals.</p>\n\n\n",

There seem to be many different situations where the dagesh is found -- in some, the hei has no vowel but follows a letter with a kamatz (as in the second line of eishet chayil \"batach baH lev ba'laH\" and this seems to show the possessive in 2 ways:</p>\n\n<p>baH = \"in her\"\nba'laH = \"her husband\"\n(other words in the poem, like kapaH and neiraH seem to work like this as well).</p>\n\n<p>However, in the rosh hashana davening, we say the word \"vayigbaH\" which has a hei following a patach and having a dagesh -- with no possessive indicated.</p>\n\n<p>Even more confusing, there is also the case where the dagesh is in a hei which HAS a nikkud. The one that really jumps out at me is the word \"elo-Ha\" (or is it \"elo-aH). In the rosh hashana davening, we say \"v'ein elo-Ha mibal'adecha\" which is not possessive, while on Yom Kippur, we say \"v'al kulam, elo-Ha slichot\" which means \"the god OF\" or \"the god to whom belongs forgiveness.\"</p>\n\n<p>So I don't see any consistency in the use of dagesh there in terms of possession and also meaning. This leads to having the word \"elo-Ha\" mean both god and god's.

(The alternative is that the letter is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matres_lectionis\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mater lectionis</a> indicating a particular vowel.) Whether a he-mapiq indicates possessive is a matter of context. The Divine name yod-he, for instance, is always spelled with a mapiq, possessive or not. (By the way, if the he has a patach, it is -aH—never -Ha—with or without a mapiq.)</p>\n\n<p>When not used in the Divine name, it's usually used to indicate feminine possessive. That's what I would assume unless the context required otherwise.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>That's not a dageish, though it's a logical mistake to make because it looks exactly like one.  That's called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mappiq\" rel=\"nofollow\">mapik</a> and occurs in a <em>hei</em> at the end of a word.  It almost always means feminine possessive, though it also appears in the short divine name beginning with <em>yud</em>.  It also appears that you have found some examples of non-feminine possessive; \"elo-aH s'lichot\" is, most accurately, \"God of forgiveness\", which isn't possessive <em>per se</em> but uses the noun-chain construct (the implicit \"of\").  (And it's not feminine either, of course.)</p>\n\n<p>The mapik is not a vowel, so I guess there's nothing to preclude that <em>hei</em> from also having a vowel.

As far as I am aware, during the week, nobody ever eats food without making their own bracha. Why is simply responding \"amen\" permitted for shabbos and yom tov meals?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: They may want to rely on the brocha of the master of the house on Shabbos in order to be included in his lechem mishna, although this may not be necessary,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long Answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are two types of brochos: 1) <em>Birkos Hamitzvos</em>; recited (usually) before performing a mitzva 2) <em>Birkos Hanehenin</em>; recited before and after having pleasure from something (such as food). While by <em>Birkos Hamitzvos</em>, it is sufficient to be obligated in the mitzvah to be able to recite the brochah on behalf of another,  this is not the case by <em>Birkos Hanehenin</em>, where the person deriving the benefit must personally say the brocha. In order to say the brocha for another, the pair must be be established as eating together at the same table to be considered one unit. (Based on <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/14/167/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch Harav 167:17</a>)</p>\n\n<p>In a case where people are sitting together at a table to eat and fulfill the conditions needed to be included with each other, it would in fact be better for one person to say the brocha on behalf of the other participants, fulfilling \"ברוב עם הדרת מלך\". However, due to concerns that people are not careful about avoiding an interruption between the hearing of the Brocha and eating the bread, the custom nowadays is for each person to make his own brocha. (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/14/167/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ibid. :18</a>) </p>\n\n<p>On Shabbos, there is an obligation to have lechem mishna; two loaves of bread. In a case where lechem mishna is not available for each person, the leader of the house will make hamotzie on lechem mishna on behalf of all present. (See <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh2/1/274/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch Harav 274:4)</a>. Some mantain that in order to be included in this they would also have to be part of his brochah homotzie.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Lubavitcher Rebbe writes in a letter (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/ig/14/4779.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iggres Kodesh Chelek 14 Page 29</a>, see <a href=\"http://www.haoros.com/Archive/index.asp?kovetz=1011&cat=9&haoro=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) challenging this, and asserts being included in the hamotzie brocha is not a precondition to being included in the lechem mishna. In fact, one is able to be yotzei lechem mishna by hearing hamotzie even if he has not yet washed. Therefore, he claims that the correct custom should be for each person to recite his own hamotzie even on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

Next (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1131.htm#14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verses 14-16</a>)  is the scene of Rachel weeping and God promising redemption, which is part of the theme of <em>Zichronos</em> - recalling the patriarchs or matriarchs as a merit to end the exile.</p>\n<p>Then (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1131.htm#17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verses 17-18</a>) describe Ephraim's <em>teshuvah</em> (repentance), including the different parts of <em>teshuvah</em>, an important thing to mention during the <em>Aseres Yemei Teshuvah</em> (Ten Days of Repentance):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי אַחֲרֵי שׁוּבִי נִחַמְתִּי וְאַחֲרֵי הִוָּדְעִי סָפַקְתִּי עַל יָרֵךְ, בֹּשְׁתִּי וְגַם נִכְלַמְתִּי כִּי נָשָׂאתִי חֶרְפַּת נְעוּרָי</p>\n<p>Surely after that I was turned, I repented, and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, as Rashi on Megilla 31a (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Megillah.31a.19.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.v. \"הבן יקיר לי אפרים\"</a>) points out, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1131.htm#19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse 19</a> cites God remembering Ephraim and having mercy on him, which, appropriately enough, is one of the verses of <em>Zichronos</em> included in the Rosh Hashanah <em>mussaf</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Sources, while welcomed, may not be strictly necessary for this one:</p>\n\n<p>In all siddurim that I have ever seen, the <em>Shemona Esrei</em> requires a blessing for dew in the second benediction (מוריד הטל), which is to be recited between Pesach and Shemini Atzeret, and a blessing for rain in place of that one (משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם) throughout the rest of the year. In presenting these two variations, siddurim generally precede the first of those with something like בקיץ באר\"י (\"When it is summer in the land of Israel\").</p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows: in light of the fact that the population of Jews in the southern hemisphere is, relatively speaking, statistically negligible, and in light of the fact that the <em>nuschaot</em> that I am familiar with were actually produced for European Jews anyway, is not summer in the land of Israel exactly the same as summer \"everywhere\" else? Why is it necessary to make such a distinction when virtually every Jew for nearly the entirety of Jewish history lived within the same hemisphere? Why not just say, בקיץ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I assume you use <em>nusach Ashk'naz</em> prayer books? \"בקיץ באר״י\" means not \"when it's summer in Israel\" but \"in summer, in Israel [say...]\". In <em>nusach Ashk'naz</em>, \"<em>morid hatal</em>\" is said only in Israel. (Open a <em>nusach S'farad</em> prayer book, and you'll see just \"בקיץ\" as the qualifier, since <em>nusach S'farad</em> says \"<em>morid hatal</em>\" even outside of Israel.)</p>\n\n\n",

If I understand correctly, he argues that Ashkenazic Jews are bound by the traditional communal practices of their Eastern European ancestors. (However ... a responsum of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein allowing an Eastern European immigrant to change his garb from that of a traditional Eastern European Jew to that of an American Orthodox Jew -- i.e. a two-piece suit or the like -- argues that \"communal practices\" only retain their halachic force during geographic transplantation if a specific community relocates <em>en masse</em> at a single point in time, which is not the case other than the Frankfurt community of Washington Heights, plus perhaps a few Hassidic communities.

    "content": "# Why do we read vayechal twice on a fast?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been doing some research on the question of vayechal at mincha and have hit a roadblock. So far, here are the questions I have considered and feel ok with as \"answered\":</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>why lain at mincha on a fast day? <a href=\"http://www.vbm-torah.org/3weeks/tisha60mt.htm\">Got it</a> -- mincha is an important time for tshuva when fasting</p></li>\n<li><p>why lain vayechal on a fast day -- got it (the above article and my own research) -- even though the gemara posits other readings, the sense is that reading which reflects the midos etc. is appropriate</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But here's the remaining question -- <strong>why lain the same thing in shacharis and mincha</strong>? There are other options for readings according to the gemara, and the notion of reading the same thing is unprecedented in practice. In fact, on tisha b'av we DO read 2 different things. Unless one says that the primary reading on every other fast day is the one at mincha (as is hinted to at the end of the linked page) and it was moved to shacharis for some sociological reason with no halachic basis and therefore no change is made in the reading, I can't understand why we don't read 2 different lainings. Any insight would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You seem to be assuming that it would make more sense for there to be different readings than for there to be the same readings. I don't see a good reason for this assumption. The only other days that have readings by Shacharis and Minchah are Shabbos and Yom Kippur. On Shabbos there is a different reading by Minchah because the point of that reading is to continue the regular reading cycle. By Yom Kippur we read the section of arayos by Minchah because there was a specific need for that section to be read on Yom Kippur. As neither of these two reasons apply to fast days, why should there be a different reading by Minchah?</p>\n\n<p>Now one might then ask that if on fast days there is no purpose of having a different reading, why have a second reading at all? We don't ever find that there is a point of just rereading the same section again later in the day (and perhaps this is actually what your question was).</p>\n\n<p>This question is asked by Rabbeinu Manoach.

What order? — R. Ammi said:\n  The order of weekly portions: R. Jeremiah said, The order of haftarahs\n  is resumed. Said Abaye: The opinion of R. Ammi is the more probable,\n  Since we learnt: THE REGULAR READING IS INTERRUPTED FOR ANY SPECIAL\n  OCCASION FOR NEW MOONS, FOR HANUKKAH, FOR PURIM, FOR FASTS, FOR\n  MA'AMADOTH AND FOR THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. This accords well with the\n  opinion of the one who says that the order of weekly portions is\n  resumed, seeing that a portion [of the Law] is read on weekdays. But\n  on the view of him who says that the order of haftarahs is resumed —\n  is there any haftarah on [ordinary] weekdays? [What says] the other to\n  this? — The one rule holds where it applies, and the other where it\n  applies. <strong>But on fast days [according to R. Jeremiah], why should\n  there be an interruption [of the regular portion]? Let us read in the\n  morning from the portion of the week and at Minhah on the subject of\n  the fast? — [R. Jeremiah's ruling] supports R. Huna; for R. Huna said:\n  ‘In the morning of fast days there is a public assembly’.</strong> How do we\n  act? Abaye said: From the morning to midday we examine the affairs of\n  the town; from midday to evening, for a quarter of the day we read the\n  portion of the Law and the haftarah, and for a quarter we offer up\n  supplications as it says, And they read in the book of the law of\n  their Lord a fourth part of the day, and another part they confessed\n  and prostrated themselves before the Lord their God. But cannot I\n  interpret this in the reverse way? — Do not imagine such a thing,\n  since it is written, Then were assembled unto me every one that\n  trembled at the words of the God of Israel because of the\n  faithlessness of them of the captivity and I sat appalled unto the\n  evening offering; and it goes on, And at the evening offering I arose\n  up from my fasting. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>; capitals in original,\n  emphasis added)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Manoach explains that we see from here that there should be two readings on fast days, but in Talmudic times they couldn't do so because there was a public assembly in the morning on a fast day. Nowadays when we don't have the public assembly we should then have two readings. Once we are having two readings we read the \"topic of the day\" both times because the Mishnah ruled that we override the regular reading schedule on fast days.</p>\n\n<p>Since \"Vayechal\" is the \"topic of the day\" we read it both by Shacharis and by Minchah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rabbeinu Manoach Hilchos Tefilla 13:18 s.v. Korin</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא\"ת למה קורין בתעניות בתורה ב' פעמים והלא אין שורש לו בגמ' התשובה\n  אעפ\"י שאין שורש מן ההלכה יש ענף וסמך קרוב לראיה מההיא דאמרי' בשלהי פרק\n  בני העיר דמתמהינן ובתעניות למה לי הפסקה כלומר למה מפסיקי' פרשת היום\n  ליקרו מצפרא בעניינא דיומא ובמנחתא בתעניתא ומשני מצפרא כנופיא משמע\n  דצריך לקרות בתורה ביום התענית שני פעמים אי לאו משום טעמא דמצפרא כנופיא\n  והשתא דליתא לההיא טעמא דהא אין כנופיא לא בצפרא ולא בפניא ממילא שמעת\n  דצריך לקראת בתורה שני פעמים ביום ומאחר דקרינן ב' פעמים ביום עניין\n  המאורע קרינן דהיינו ויחל כיון דקיי\"ל דמפסיקין לתעניות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

What am I doing Teshuvah for?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ramban (in Toras Ha'adam Shaar Hegemul) brings two reasons why one who sins בשוגג requires repentance:</p>\n\n<p>1) If he was truly worried and fearful of Hashem he would not have done what he did without investigating fully if it was permitted. I remember hearing an example for this that you don't hear of anyone accidentally jumping into a fire. This is also explained in the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/9405.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchos Shegogos Chapter 5 Halacha 6</a>) who differentiates between a שוגג and an אונס. In the case of a שוגג the person is at fault for not bothering to thoroughly investigate, whereas in an אונס situation there was nothing he could have done.</p>\n\n<p>2) Even if the person cannot be blamed for his action, the end result is that the sin was committed which affected a blemish on his soul that must be rectified. This is brought out in more \"lomdishe\" words by the Toras Chesed (O.C. Siman 31) who explains that there are two parts to commiting a sin: the גברא (person) and the חפצא (object). The גברא part means that the individual is commanded to fulfill the will of Hashem, and by failing to do so he is rebelling, and the חפצא part is that by performing an aveirah a blemish is caused to his soul. In the case of a שוגג, although the גברא issue is not present (he is not rebelling since he did not intend to do so), the חפצא part is still present and needs atonement.</p>\n\n<p>[Based on this reasoning some Achronim (Nesivos Hamishpat C.M. Siman 234 Biurim Sif Kotan 3, and see Ohr Sameach Hilchos Girushin Perek 1 Halacha 17) claim that by a Rabinical prohibition which is only on the גברא not the חפצא one does indeed not require attonment for a שוגג.]</p>\n\n<p>(Answer based on <a href=\"http://www.haoros.com/Archive/index.asp?kovetz=1003&cat=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> Hebrew essay.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The soul is incapable of doing wrong, even by mistake.

T'shuva, T'shuva is commonly broken into four parts.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>חרטה - The acceptance and decision that whatever has been happening until now - it was wrong.</li>\n<li>עזיבת החטא - Stop doing wrong. Getting onto the right path.</li>\n<li>וידוי - Admitting you did wrong, taking responsibility. It's the only way to realize that <em>you</em> are in charge and <em>you</em> have the power to make the change, as well.</li>\n<li>קבלה לעתיד - Continuing on the right path, the decision that from now on, you will be doing the right thing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, you are talking about phases 2 & 4. It's not exactly that one still has to do T'shuva after stopping the behavior, but that stopping the behavior is part of the T'shuva, the T'shuva, however, should be complete.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe of Lubavitch in <a href=\"http://beta.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7934/jewish/Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igeres Hatsheva Perek Aleph</a> (based on Sanhedrin 34b, and Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat Siman 34) defines the mitzvah of Teshuva as the abandonment of sin; that is the sincere resolution never again to violate Hashem's will. As far as that goes, if you have stopped the behavior that is considered the Teshuva.</p>\n\n<p>However that this is only in terms of the <em>mitzvah</em> of teshuva, not the <em>concept</em> of Teshuva. One who G-d forbid sinned needs to rectify the spiritual damage caused by his misdeed, and repair the severed connection to Hashem. As the Alter Rebbe explains at the beginning of the chapter, when one performs a positive command he not only fulfills Hashem's Will, but also draws down a flow of Divine light into the higher spiritual realms and upon his own soul. If one neglects the positive command, that spiritual light is lacking. Transgressing a negative commandment blemished the individual’s soul and the celestial realms. Teshuva is the process of repairing this.</p>\n\n<p>[Additionally, the Alter Rebbe explains in <a href=\"http://beta.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7908/jewish/Chapter-29.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Perek 29 Tanya</a> that Teshuva is an ongoing lifelong process. Dovid Hamelech said \"וחטאתי נדגי תמיד\", \"My sin is constantly before me.\" However, Dovid was a <em>Tzadik Gamur</em> who also said \"ולבי חלל בקרבי\", \"My evil impulse is as if dead within me\" (Rashi). Why was it necessary for him to constantly bear in mind his past sins? The Alter Rebbe explains the greater one's stature, the higher the level of repentance is required of him. Thus even if he may already have repented sincerely, when he ascends to a higher level he requires a higher level of Teshuva to rectify that same sin.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What if there is no object for use in a mitzva?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a story I once heard about the Ben Ish Chai examining the only known etrog available in Iraq. Despite the great need for it, he declared the etrog passul for use and no one could fulfill the mitzva on Sukkot. </p>\n\n<p>There are many physical mitzvot. Some of them form the main mitzvot of holidays, such as: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Arba Minim</li>\n<li>Matzah</li>\n<li>Menorah</li>\n<li>Sukkah</li>\n<li>Shofar</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What does someone do if, for reasons beyond one's control, it is impossible to attain them? Is there any kind of substitutional prayer or other that acknowledges this lack? There must have been communities throughout history, and including today, that dealt with these issues.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm familiar with substitutions for less-essential issues (i.e., the Ben Ish Chai Nitzavim 3 recommending washing the hands 40 times if there is no mikva or shower before a chag).</p>\n\n<p>A friend of mine recently told me how, because of the remoteness of his location, he could not attain an etrog. So, without saying a bracha, he used a lemon and shook the \"lulav.\" He knew he wasn't fulfilling a mitzva, but he felt he should at least do something to remind him of that mitzva. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know of any customs that address lacking such physical mitzvot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I don't know of any prayers for such cases (other than ones regarding the lack of Temple services), there are many cases where one might be inclined to use something else instead (like using a lemon instead of an Esrog). In certain cases, it seems like it is better to 'fake it', so to speak, so as to do <em>something</em> even if it isn't the mitzvah, while in other cases this might be prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>Let me elaborate. The Gemara specifically addresses the case of someone who lacks an Esrog:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא מצא\n   אתרוג לא יביא לא רמון ולא פריש ולא דבר אחר, פשיטא, מהו\n   דתימא לייתי כי היכי שלא תשכח תורת אתרוג, קמ״ל זימנין דנפיק\n   חורבא מיניה דאתי למיסרך.</p>\n  \n  <p>If someone couldn't find an Esrog, he should not take a pomegranite or quince or anything else in it's stead. [Is this not] obvious?! One might have thought [that such a thing should be done] in order so as not to forget the law of the Esrog, so [the Tosefta] comes to teach us that sometimes destruction could come through such an act, as someone might come to be drawn after it (Sukkah 31b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the Gemara gives no prayer or the like for such a situation, it appears that it's better to do <em>nothing</em> than to hold a lemon instead of an Esrog, because one might mistakenly come to think that taking a lemon is a fulfillment of something. The Rambam (Sukkah 7:5) extends this to the other 3 species as well. </p>\n\n<p>There are important exceptions to this rule of \"not faking it\". After all, there were several enactments made in order so as not to forget certain laws that depended on the Temple, which includes not only prohibitions (such as the fact that new grain is prohibited for entire 'yom hanef') but also positive institutions, such as waving the four species every day of Sukkos, and in a different way, the entire institiution of eiruvei chatzeros (see Eiruvin 46b, 80b) and taking Challah from dough in areas that would otherwise not require it (see Bechoros 27a). In these examples, where there's no possibility of 'destruction' (since the worst that would happen is that people do <em>extra</em> things that they aren't supposed to do, not that the fake rituals would replace required commands) such actions were encouraged.</p>\n\n<p>However, the differences between permitted 'mitzvah remembrances' and prohibited ones may not be so clear cut. The Gemara also brings (approvingly) the case in Menachos 32b of the 'Munbaz household', who placed their Mezuzos on sticks in a manner which was not a fulfillment of the mitzvah when it was a time of danger. </p>\n\n<p>There is one further case where the Sages explicitly stated doing <strong>something</strong> for the mitzvah at a time when it can't be fulfilled in actu: regarding Channukah candles. In a case of 'a time of danger', when one cannot place the candles where they would be seen, the Gemara Shabbos 21b says to place them on the table. (However, this may either be, as Tosfos explain, because there's also a fulfillment of <em>pirsumei nisa</em> in the house, <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/admur/lkus/35/13/12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">or because Chanukah candles don't actually have to be visible to others</a>). A friend of mine used this as fodder <a href=\"http://doleh-u-mashkeh.blogspot.com/2013/12/chanukah-dvar-torah-from-last-yr.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for a nice piece of Channukah drush</a></p>\n\n<p>This plays regarding another question as well. According to some opinions, (Shyarei Knesses Hagedolah O.C. 143:1, brought by the Magen Avraham there) if a congregations does not have a Sefer Torah than they should read the appropriate reading from a printed book specifically \"so as not to forget about the law of Torah reading\". Even though others prohibit this practice, it appears that they do so only out of respect for the congregation, and not because they are worried that someone might come to think that reading from a Chumash or invalid Torah scroll is enough (See <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%9E%D7%92#.D7.A1.D7.99.D7.9E.D7.9F_.D7.A7.D7.9E.D7.92_.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan 143:7</a>). Perhaps the difference between this case and that of the Esrog is that here, (1) the Torah portion is actually being read (i.e. people are still learning Torah) so at least <em>something</em> is being accomplished (2) since Torah reading is something done in public, we aren't worried that people will come to mistakenly think that it doesn't need to be done with a Torah scroll.

I don't have a great answer and I hope it will get more posts.</p>\n\n<p>I am acquainted with some ideas on this topic; some, but not all, through chassidus Chabad. Here are a few of them:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Get the mitzvah item at any cost.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This is what the Jews of old did. I include with them the Jews of the last century. The stories of their courage and <em>mesiras nefesh</em> in obtaining and preserving the needed articles, especially during the Holocaust, are extremely moving. Of course, this was always true, not only in Europe but for thousands of years before. This is no longer remarkable to the Jewish ear because we have heard it so much because it was done so much.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. \"If you can't, you can't\"</strong> </p>\n\n<p>There is such an idea as not being able to perform a mitzvah, and it very likely stops short of that, where other mitzvot such as pikuach nefesh or the  <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=20192\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Decree of Usha</a> or similar <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/65690/1516\">checks</a> from the Torah come in to play before you actually go to the end of human effort and find that you \"can't.\" One is allowed to stop pursuing a mitzvah in these cases, and sometimes it is required. </p>\n\n<p>Seen another way: We try as hard as we can, and count on H' for the rest. That is the proper way of doing everything. In the latest parshah (Pikudei) we saw H' command Moshe to lift the beams of the mishkan, which were physically impossible to lift; Moshe lifted them as high as he could, and H' lifted them the rest of the way. In other words we have faith that Siyata Dishmaya will narrow the gap between our abilities and what He has asked of us, and that G-d's mercy will close it. (\"If you can't, you can.\")</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Teshuvah</strong></p>\n\n<p>Second chances, and opportunities for repair and teshuvah, exist in Judaism. In some cases they are enshrined in the tradition (tashlumin, Pesach Sheni, vidui and tachanun, korbanos, Yom Kippur, etc., etc.), and, where they are not, we take the standard steps of teshuvah (apologies, repairing damage, contrition, commitment to do better) and then look forward with clear eyes. </p>\n\n<p>There are specific tikkunim such as personal fasts and tehillim that supposedly repair the spiritual damage of a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20249/1516\">mistake</a>. The Lubavitcher Rebbe seemed to think, more practically, that atonement lay in making the next time better. He would suggest to chasidim who asked him for a tikkun that they spend time learning Torah about the area they had transgressed. </p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Doing another form of the mitzvah</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is some idea in our tradition of doing physical versions of mitzvot <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/1005223/jewish/Be-Fruitful-and-Multiply.htm#footnoteRef36a1005223\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">similar</a> to those you cannot--as in using zeroa to stand in for the Peasch, and a personal fast to stand in for a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.17a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">korban</a>. At least as interestingly, there are examples brought in our tradition of mitzvot that may be performed in spiritual form--either by learning, by davening, or by having a machshava--as an adjunct to the physical mitzvah or even as its replacement. The example repeated most throughout Jewish tradition is bringing korbanos, which the Talmud says in several places may be replaced by studying their halachos [Taanis 27b, Menachos 110a, Yoma 86b, and Vayikra Rabbah 7:3, which says: \"Since you involve yourself in studying them, I consider it as though you had actually brought them.\"] According to various sources, the mitzvah of building the Temple is achieved by <a href=\"http://www.chabadwestside.org/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/2865539/jewish/Terumah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">learning the halachos of building the Temple</a> and/or by making a place for Hashem in our homes, hearts, and synagogues. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2317444/jewish/Chapter-5-The-Maamar.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">maamar</a> Isa B'Midrash Tehillim of the Fifth Rebbe of Chabad explores how a spiritually- or intellectually-attained mitzvah may accomplish the same spiritual tasks as a physical mitzvah. This idea of the \"long-short way\" in Chasidic practice, where a mitzvah is ideally accomplished through feeling, understanding, and self-transformation above and beneath the doing, is rehearsed in Tanya and <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/148153/jewish/How-We-Can-Build-the-Bais-Hamikdash.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">throughout</a> Chasidus <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/148157/jewish/Towards-the-Complete-Fulfillment-of-a-Mitzvah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad</a>. The existence of purely-spiritual forms of the mitsvot (all of them!) at the place of their initiation, namely the Supernal Realms, is the source of this idea. (I think I also learned that in the cases where the avos couldn't do a particular mitzvah because it or its conditions didn't yet exist, they did the spiritual form of the mitzvah, too.) It therefore seems that performing the spiritual equivalent of a mitzvah--namely, learning about it--is a legitimate option when one has no way to do the deed itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Paying someone else to do the mitzvah</strong> </p>\n\n<p>I heard this was also recommended by the Lubavitcher Rebbe in a case when a chosid had missed an opportunity for a mitzvah. He suggested the chosid give some money afterwards to an organization working to further this mitzvah. This seems like a very practical offset to me. </p>\n\n<p>Also, many mitzvot--like matones l'evyonim, writing a Torah scroll, kibbud av va'eim, and perhaps even certain prayers--may be performed <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2015/11/27/do-the-mitzvah-yourself-the-principle-of-mitzvah-bo-yoser-mi-beshlucho/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">through a shaluach</a> or a motzi. Let us hope that the shaluach or the motzi has the ritual object that you lack.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Doing a different mitzvah</strong></p>\n\n<p>“A mitzvah does not atone for a sin” (Sforno, Exod. 32:33)--and yet a mitzvah is the right thing to be doing at all times. Perhaps, instead of the impossible mitzvah, one could fulfill another one, like one that one had neglected. There is maybe even a tiny bit of backup for this advice in the Torah: \n<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/900269/jewish/Positive-Commandment-87.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/900269/jewish/Positive-Commandment-87.htm</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/289091/jewish/Increase-in-Torah-study\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">All mitzvot nourish the entire soul</a>, and there are <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/949305/jewish/What-are-the-six-perpetual-mitzvot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mitzvot</a> that are obligated for all <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Peah.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">times</a>. If you can't do the mitzvah you are supposed to be doing, at least you will be doing another mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p><strong>7. The effort to do the mitzvah is the mitzvah</strong></p>\n\n<p>To recapitulate number 2, what you're supposed to do is try. The time you spend trying is avodas hakodesh and whatever happens in the end is, strictly speaking, not your problem. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n\n<p>Everything I have just said and infinitely more is summarized most gracefully in this <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/71941/jewish/When-You-Cant-Do-the-Mitzvah-Youre-Told-To.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">six-sentence letter</a> of the Lubavitcher Rebbe to one of his chasidim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And yet one more thing...</strong></p>\n\n<p>I find myself smiling at the apt and lovely fact that G-d anticipated your exact question to the letter and supplied a plain answer in His torah. (Isn't that always the case on Mi.Yodeya, as everywhere?!)</p>\n\n<p>That answer, of course, is the story of the Chanukah miracle, in which people desperately wanted to do a mitzvah, but found themselves lacking the goods for it. What happened was that G-d provided the goods, much as He provided the lamb, and provides everything. The Torah was given to people; people live on Earth; Earth is defined by limitations. We, unlike angels, sometimes don't have the goods. And yet G-d makes a way for us to serve Him, as if to prove that He He wants us to serve Him indeed. We continue to celebrate that gift for the rest of our generations, as if to prove, as if it were necessary, that we really want to serve Him, too.</p>\n\n\n",

However he then says if that's the case (\"v'im cain\"), then on Yom Tov one should make the bracha and then light. (Since there is no problem of lighting a candle on yom tov, therefore better to make the bracha first.) He says this is also what's written (\"cain csav\") b'sof Sefer HaDrisha b'shem imo (in the name of his mother! This, by the way, is a famous thing: that the whole reason that many woman when lighting candles on yom tov make the bracha first is because of that which the Drishas mother did (however if you look at the Drisha inside I think he is referring to his Grandmother if I'm not mistaken -- but it would make sense anyway that that is where his mother got the minhag from)). However, the M\"A writes then, \"avel ain chachma l'isha...d'lo chelku chachamim...\" his kavana (according to the Maktzes HaShekel) is that not all women will know how to make a difference between Shabbos and Yom Tov and if you tell them to, on Yom Tov, make a bracha and then light, then they will come to do the same on Shabbos, which will get them into a problem of being makabel Shabbos before lighting (as mentioned before).

Others, though, see modesty as subjective to the standards of society at large, and therefore, while still adhering to a standard (which may be hard for other groups to identify), is much more in line with what one might see elsewhere in society.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I couldn't find any relevant teshuvot on the Rabbinical Assembly web site, and as already noted by Seth J, there isn't a single authority for Orthodox (Modern or otherwise).  I can describe what I have observed (primarily in one city).  I often attend a Conservative shul for weekday services and occasionally others, and I've visited several Orthodox congregations a few times.</p>\n\n<p>Women in Conservative synagogues may wear skirts, dresses, or pants.  Sleeves may be short or long, but necklines are moderate to high.  Covering hair appears to be uncommon.  Women and men shake hands and there is mixed seating at kiddushes.  Social activities do not appear to be gender-segregated.  Some women work outside the home and do not limit themselves to gender-segregated jobs.  I don't know what happens at public swimming pools.</p>\n\n<p>It's harder to tell which synagogues are \"Modern Orthodox\" versus some other Orthodox designation.  I've been to Orthodox synagogues where men freely shook women's hands and where women wore short sleeves (not pants, though).  I've been to others where these things don't happen.  This is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/7725/472\">somewhat confusing</a>.  A woman who told me she is Modern Orthodox dresses the way I described Conservative above (but no pants in shul), and she has both male and female coworkers. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>My experience (of the American scene) is that there are numerous shades of Jewish observance, but that there is a particularly significant split between Conservative and Orthodox denominations with regards to women's modesty and separation of the sexes.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is appropriate to draw up three (mostly) distinct categories:</p>\n\n<p>Modern Orthodox (mainstream) /   M.O. (Liberal)  /  Conservative</p>\n\n<p>Shaking hands with men/women: In my experience, all Conservatives and most M.O. (liberal), as well as a a lot of M.O. (mainstream), have no problem with it. However, as you get to the right-wing side of mainstream Modern Orthodoxy, people start being more strict about this. Often, a handshake for reasons of politeness is still appropriate, but there is hesitancy with more gratuitously affectionate forms of touch between men and women.</p>\n\n<p>Women's singing/performing in public (not in shul): Again, this goes from being very much not a problem (for Conservatives) to not a problem (for M.O. liberals) to often/sometimes not a problem (for mainstream M.O. people). It becomes more of a problem as you get to the center point of M.O. and rightward. Even so, a lot of Modern Orthodox people do not worry about the kol isha prohibition (prohibition on hearing women's singing voices) as much as those in non-M.O. strains of Orthodoxy. </p>\n\n<p>Pants outside shul - You will by hard-pressed to find any Conservatives who have a problem with pants in or out of shul. Liberal Modern Orthodoxers may go either way on this; a lot of the women in this category wear skirts <em>most</em> of the time. Once you get to mainstream M.O. and rightward, skirts become more of an assumption--although even then women may make exceptions for exercise, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Hair covering - Conservative women almost never cover their hair on a regular basis. If they do, it is often with a kippah. Within liberal Modern Orthodoxy, you will find a whole range, from women who wear a full covering such as a tichel on a daily basis, to those who wear a partial covering, to those who wear no covering, to a great many who may wear a covering only on Shabbos/to shul and for candle-lighting. Within mainstream and right-wing Modern Orthodoxy, it is more common to find women covering their hair full-time with either a full or a partial covering, although even here, there are significant numbers of women who cover only for Shabbos/shul and holidays. </p>\n\n<p>In my experience, mixing with men at work is absolutely standard for all manner of Modern Orthodox women as well as all Conservatives.</p>\n\n<p>Swimming pools are harder. In Modern Orthodoxy, women generally do swim in mixed settings. They will usually wear something a little more modest than a regular bathing suit. The closer you get to mainstream Orthodoxy, the more women will cover up for the pool, or else relegate themselves to single-sex sessions when possible. </p>\n\n\n",

After many prayers she finally became pregnant, but Yehoshua's father became upset when he was told from On High that his son would chop off his head. Yehoshua's mother, knowing this, hid the baby in a box and cast it in the river where it was swallowed by a great fish. The fish was then caught for the king's feast and the king found the crying baby inside. The king raised baby Yehoshua and eventually appointed him Chief Butcher. Yehoshua's father later sinned against the king of Egypt, so the king told Yehoshua to chop off his head and take his wife, children, and possessions, as was the law in those times. When Yehoshua drew near his mother to come upon her, the bed became filled with milk from her breasts and Yehoshua was about to kill her for witchcraft. His mother then remembered the words of her husband and told Yehoshua that this was the milk that she nursed him with, as she was his mother. She told him the whole story, and he got up from her since he also remembered the claim that he had been found in a fish, and he repented. Therefore he was called בן נון because he was found in a fish and נון in Aramaic means fish. (I.e. יהושע בן נון means Yehoshua the son of a fish.)  </p>\n\n<p>Note that referring to this legend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Ginzberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Professor Louis Ginzberg</a> wrote:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=r8uJAAAAMAAJ&dq=the%20responsa%20of%20professor%20louis%20ginzberg&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=jonah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Ma'aneh Levi p. 278</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is no way of telling where Shapiro found the legend, and I have\n  very little hope that at present anybody would be willing to undergo\n  the trouble [of] examining the rather bulky transcripts of Shapiro.\n  There can be, however, no doubt that it is not a very old source, as\n  can be seen by the style and language, which indicate a rather late\n  period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Humming as an interruption during Birkat Kohanim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is the humming by the kohanim during birkat kohanim considered a hefsek of their bracha? Please be clear what halachik reasoning allows or disallows this humming.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Mechaber rules (OC 65:1) that if someone pauses in the middle of a mitzva an amount of time in which he could have performed the entire mitzva (henceforth: a long pause) he does not have to start over with the exception of Tefillah (ie Shmoneh Esrei) where one would have to go back. The Rama rules that for deoraita requirements, one would have to go back if the pause was forced (באונס) and not voluntary. For derabanan requirements he would allow one to not go back, per the Mechaber, and make one always go back for Tefillah, also per the Mechaber. (All the above is as explained in Biur Halacha to OC 65:1 sv Kar'ah.) The amount of time sung by the Kohanim is IMO definitely longer than the time it would take to just say all three pesukim responsively.</p>\n\n<p>So we have three issues:</p>\n\n<p>1) Is this singing considered a forced interruption? The Magen Avraham quotes two opinions if forced means that one was halachically unable to continue (eg. something unclean passed nearby) or if one was practically unable to continue (eg. armed robbers passed nearby). He seems to side with the former definition while our case would seem to be more similar to the latter (the Kohein <em>could</em> go ahead and say the final word loudly while everyone else was singing, I suppose).</p>\n\n<p>2) Does Birkat Kohanim count as Tefillah and would therefore need to be restarted even without a forced long pause for the Rama? So I can't say for sure, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if it were. Consider the full name of the Rambam's section: הלכות תפילה וברכת כוהנים‏. Birkat Kohanim is said as part of Shmone Esrei, and utilizes the Chazzan and Minyan to do so. The Mishna in Rosh Hashana 4:5 even calls the last Bracha of Shmone Esrei (about peace) \"Birkat Kohanim\". So the two are closely related. I'm not sure though if that carries over into the laws of Hefsek or not.</p>\n\n<p>3) Does the length of time to say all of Birkat Kohanim include the singing, since that is the custom? The Biur Halacha there mentions this as a possibility but leaves the matter for further study (צ\"ע). I don't get the feeling he is particularly convinced by this option.</p>\n\n<p>So if you assume Birkat Kohanim is not Tefillah and you either hold like the Mechaber or hold like the opinion that this type of case is not considered forced, then even if you hold the time spent singing does not combine to the action's length you would not have to go back and restart Birkat Kohanim for singing too long.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>All this is at least on a <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/702/759\">bedieved</a> level. The Aruch haShulchan (OC 65:5) writes that for sure in all cases one should not make such a long break <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/702/759\">lechatchilah</a> and it is only permitted to do so for great need.</p>\n\n<p>Does Birkat Kohanim count as great need, ie can a Kohen go up if he knows singing will take place? Well, it is a mitzva deoraita, but on the other hand, if a he were to leave the Minyan before the start of the 3rd to last blessing of Shmone Esrei (Retzei...) he would not be obligated in this mitzva, so no loss. CYLOR for a final ruling.</p>\n\n<p>Does reciting the prayers regarding dreams count as a great need, ie should a shul abolish the minhag of singing? Well, it is an old minhag, and the dream-prayers date back to at least the Gemara (Brachot 55b), but on the other hand see the Levush OC 128:26 who records the minhag of the Kohanim singing \"the ך in וישמרך, the ך in ויחנך and the ל in שלום [because that way they have finished the bracha at hand (<em>groan</em>)]\" thereby avoiding extended pauses. CYLOR for a final ruling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I spoke this out with a Rov who said this is simply the Minhag and says that the Cohanim should m'varech (bless) the am (people) b'ni'imah (melodically).\nAlthough a \"source\" I don't have for this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17873/1274\">this answer</a> that making sounds that are not words does not constitute a hefsek in general. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/9895/1274\">This answer</a> indicates that what makes something an interruption is the fact that it distracts one from what one was doing, so something that doesn't change the subject would not be an interruption.</p>\n\n\n",

The math is straightforward: There were 20 boards of 1.5 amos on the north and south, thus requiring the poles to span 30 amos (the top and bottom poles were 2 x 15 amos, and the middle pole 1 x 30 amos). On the west was 8 boards of 1.5 amos, which required the poles to span 12 amos (again, top and bottom 2 x 6, middle 1 x 12).</p>\n\n<p>Now, the 8 boards on the west overlapped one amah of the ones on the north and south. But evidently the poles on the N and S sides did not extend over the thickness of the western boards. So the math works out perfectly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As far as I understand, Rashi only says that there was a 5 amos span in between amudim in reference to the possuk discussing southern wall. He also explains that the south-eastern corner post was of the southern count and the 3 of the southern Shoulder are 15 amos towards the center and the same is mirrored on the northern side.\nThe question remains for the west wall. The possuk says there were 10 amudim so there must have been a different span, namely 50/9 amos.\nThe east gate masach must also have different spans. 20/3 = 6 2/3 amos because there were 4 amudim so three spans and 20 amos.</p>\n<p>Ikur Sifsei chachamim assumes universal span and lays out in clockwise direction the next sides first amud holding up the end of each side and ends up  attributing this to rashi which doesn't work with rashi's explanation of the shoulders.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Another possible answer is that in between each 5 amos span the amud itself took up space along which there was that much kela. Nine spans on the West and 19 spans on the North and South. Two posts in western corners. The shoulders' 5 includes the amud and the masach is back to a weird span or outsized amudim.</p>\n<p>Another possible answer which doesn't fit with Rashi's expalanation of the corner amud is that each amud held the kela from the middle by suspending the kela on a roll from cords. the 5 amos span is still produced. Exactly how this was set up is not clear.</p>\n\n\n",

He writes that such a suggestion was made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by some French Rabbis, based on a Rama (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.157.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 157:4</a>) who provides a similar procedure to avert potential chalitzah problems.</p>\n\n<p>However, this proposal was rejected by nearly all the halachic authorities at the time. In fact, an entire book, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/595\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ein Tenai Benisu'in</a>, was published collecting the letters that hundreds of halachic authorities wrote against the idea, including Rav Yitzchok Elchanan Spektor, Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, Rav Chaim Soloveitchik, Rav Yisroel Meir Kagan, Rav Yechiel Michel Epstein, Rav Meir Simcha of Dvinsk, Rav Malkiel Tannenbaum, Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank and Israeli Chief Rabbis Avraham Yitzchak Kook and Ben Tzion Uzziel.</p>\n\n<p>The opposition was based on several Halachic issues:  Firstly such a condition may be considered \"<em>masneh al mah shekasuv batorah</em>\" (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.56a.16?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 56a</a>) -  if one makes a condition which contravenes a Torah obligation, the condition is void and the transaction is effective. Another problem is that the Gemora (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.94b.7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 94b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.72b.11-74a.9?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 72b - 74a</a>) seems to imply that a condition can only apply to the first stage of marriage (Kiddushin) but not the second stage (Nissuin).</p>\n\n<p>There were also technical grounds to the rejection. The laws of formulating conditions are complex and many Rabbis do not know them. Furthermore, such a proposal would weaken the entire institution of marriage - if a couple knew that the that its marriage could be retroactively undone at any time by just filling for civil divorce, they may be tempted to cheat on their spouse knowing that they could avert the sin of adultery by retroactively cancelling the marriage. The Rabbis were not prepared to weaken the entire institution of of marriage in order to solve the difficulties a small percentage of people incur. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This concept that the Rabbis can annul/ uproot a marriage is found in several places in the gemara such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.33a.9?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Gittin.33a.9&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 33a</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.3a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesuvos 3a</a>. The Rabbis have the right to do this because when we get married we say <em>k'das moshe v'yisrael</em> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.3a.3?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Ketubot.3a.3.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos Kesuvos 3a</a>) which means in <strong>a select few cases</strong> the Rabbis have the power to retroactively uproot the <em>kiddushin</em>.  Nowadays we can't add cases where the marriage retroactively doesn't work, which is why we unfortunately can't use this device to solve every aguna problem.</p>\n\n<p>It does not pose a problem to integrity since the husband and wife agreed upon it, when he said <em>k'das moshe v'yisrael</em>. Also the cases where we use this concept is where there are problems that people might violate <em>arayos</em> or it will come to lead people to think <em>arayos</em> are permissible. Also in the case in Kesuvos the husband gave a <em>get al tanai</em>, thus we see he had already given a get. In Kiddushin the Rabbis stopped the marriage in the first place. So we see that the Rabbis don't just pop into marriages just cause they feel like it.  </p>\n\n\n",

The problem is that it's made of canvas, which is wrapped around a metal frame.  This does not seem like it would be expandable.  But then I began to think about the possibility of pulling back one of the \"walls\" (ie., just not wrapping it around, and instead extending it out).  Below are some rough sketches of my current canvas Sukkah and my first rough idea of a way to expand it and open it up. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/04426.gif\" alt=\"Canvas Sukkah - Rough Sketch\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7LLvE.gif\" alt=\"Canvas Sukkah - Expanded, First Idea\"></p>\n\n<p>The idea is that I would just not wrap the canvas all the way around, and instead I'd extend it outward and set up posts to support the Sechach.  Some of the posts are needed for the structural integrity of the Sukkah frame itself, and so they won't be taken down, and I'd add new posts in a couple of spots to support additional \"roof\" beams with bamboo laid across the top of them.</p>\n\n<p>So the theoretical side of my question is, how far can I extend the 3rd wall (the wall that's roughly 7 feet long) without a physical wall there?  It would have a Tzurath HaPethaḥ, if that makes a difference, all the way across, because I would still need beams to support the Sechach, and those posts are there to support the beams.  So, every place you see a gap, there would still be a beam over the top of that gap.</p>\n\n<p>(I know the dimensions are off, but my computer graphic abilities are limited!)</p>\n\n<p>On the practical side of my question, one issue of possible concern with my new design is that the tightly wrapped canvas might act like a sail and topple the Sukkah in a gust of wind. The frame is heavy and very sturdy, and the canvas itself is also heavy, but I wonder if it might still be a problem.  Another issue related to wind exposure is whether items on the table might be blown to the ground.</p>\n\n<p>And, as I said, this is a first rough idea of one way to expand it, so if you have other suggestions that would work better, from either the standpoint of Halachah or practicality, I'm open to ideas, especially from those with real-world experience!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I've seen someone extend his canvas Sukka by purchasing additional poles and canvas.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Have a look at <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38644&pgnum=423\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chayei Adam 145:3</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/LCcsJ.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Chayei Adam 145:3\"></p>\n\n<p>While four walls are ideal, if you have two walls that form a corner, and the third wall has at least a <em>tefach</em> (~4 inches) of width and forms a <em>tzuras hapesach</em>, that works.</p>\n\n<p>(He continues on a discussion whether this is an adequate \"private space\" with regards to carrying on shabbos; basically if we call it good enough to be a sukkah, we call it good enough for carrying inside on shabbos -- at least the shabbos of sukkos --  but that's a different issue.)</p>\n\n\n",

The <em>Bach</em> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2586\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 550</a>) seems to understand the Ramban as saying that, during some period in Talmudic times (e.g. R' Y'huda HaNasi's time) things were copacetic enough to be in the middle category of neither oppression nor \"peace\"<sup>2</sup> (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=18b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Rosh HaShana</em> 18b</a>), but that it was a time of oppression in the time of the Ramban (and the Tur). The <em>Bach</em> concludes that the Ramban holds that one must observe the original requirements of the fast whenever it is a time of oppression.<sup>3</sup> The <em>Beit Yosef</em> (OC 550) likewise indicates that the Ramban holds this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאע״פ שהם בטלים באותו זמן, אם יהיה שמד חס ושלום יחזרו\nהצומות לקביעותם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Yehuda Leib Chanales<sup>4</sup> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40386&st=&pgnum=135\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Vayigash Y'huda</em> OC 550:1</a>) seems to say that the Tish'a B'Av-type requirements were permanently uprooted by communal practice during a period when there was neither peace (since the Beis HaMikdash was not standing) nor serious oppression. However, a resurgence of oppression makes it appropriate (though not required) to observe the original requirements that had originally been absolutely mandatory (by <em>divrei kabbala</em>) during times of oppression.</p>\n<p>The Chafetz Chayim appears to take the former approach, and describes his era as a time of oppression (<em>Sha'ar HaTziyun</em>, OC 550:9). He also mentions that the Vilna Gaon (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2905\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Bei'ur HaGra</em> OC 550:2</a>, s.v. <em>tzomos hallalu</em>) approves of the Ramban's approach. However, it seems to me (IMHO) that the Gra only approves of Ramban's approach regarding the basic mechanics of the prophetic institution of those fast days (see <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2308.htm#19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Z'charya</em> 8:19</a>), namely, that the prophets instituted all four fasts with the same types of requirements as those of a biblical <em>ta'anis tzibur</em> (\"וכל דתקון נביאים כעין דאורייתא תיקון\") but that there was an option to reject these requirements during a period of reprieve (\"אין גזרת המלכות ואין שלום\" - <em>Rosh HaShana</em> 18b) for all those fasts except for Tish'a B'Av. The Vilna Gaon concludes that R' Y'huda HaNasi exercised this option and uprooted these requirements except for the daytime fasting (see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=5&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>M'gilla</em> 5a</a>-b), and the Vilna Gaon's wording seems to indicate that he would hold that these requirements could not return during a time of oppression (though he says this less explicitly than does the Bach, see fn. 3 below).</p>\n<p>In any case, the Ramban did not seem to hold that anyone would have to declare that it was a \"time of oppression\" in order to require fasting, but rather that the return of oppression (\"שמד במקום ידוע בישראל\") would automatically generate the requirement to observe the full stringencies of the fasts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל שכן בדורות הללו שהרי בעונותינו שרבו יש שמד בישראל ואין שלום הילכך חייבין הכל להתענות מדברי קבלה ותקנת נביאים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Judging by the wording used in <em>Sha'ar HaTziyun</em>, that also appears to be the Chafetz Chayim's approach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דהאידנא מצוי גזירות מן עובדי גלולים ואם כן חל עצם החיוב על הג' צומות כמו על ט' באב לפי דברי הרמב\"ן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>Besides for the Ramban's opinion, individuals wishing to conduct themselves stringently during any era would be encouraged by the opinion of Rashi (<em>Sefer HaPardes</em>, cited by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Aseret_HaDibrot%2C_Taanit%2C_Ner_Mitzva.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>ShL\"aH</em>, <em>Ta'anis</em>, <em>Ner Mitzva</em> §6</a>, paragraph beginning \"<em>min hara'ui</em>\").</sub></p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>Although Rashi interprets a time of peace to mean a time when the Jews are not subject to the dominion of the non-Jews (<em>Rosh HaShana</em> 18b, s.v. <em>sheyeish shalom</em>), the Ramban defines this as referring to a time when the Temple is standing.</sub></p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <sub>The Bach then mentions opinions of various rishonim and finally disagrees with the Ramban and concludes that R' Y'huda HaNasi permanently uprooted the <em>divrei kabbala</em> fasts, and they were replaced with our version of those fasts as a <em>minhag Yisra'el</em> (except for <em>Tish'a B'Av</em>, which has the status of a rabbinic fast: \"דרבנן תיקנו להחמיר בו בכל החומרות\"). This is similar the opinion of the Vilna Gaon, except the wording of Vilna Gaon seems to suggest that the daytime fasting retains its <em>divrei kabbala</em> status.</sub></p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> <sub>d. 1596.

    "content": "# Food cooked by woman during Niddah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If according to my Bible translation - please correct me if it is wrong - anything a woman in niddah or a state of tumah, or 'impurity', touches or sits on becomes 'impure', can food cooked by her be eaten by others and if so, do they also become tumah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>Yes, someone who eats impure food becomes impure themselves (Rambam Shar Avot Hatumah 8:10).</p>\n<p>However, this needs some perspective. Niddah is one kind of impurity, and another one is that of a corpse (see <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0419.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 19</a>). The procedure for purifying oneself of Niddah-impurity is by using a mikvah which can and is done today regularly. The procedure for purifying oneself from corpse-impurity involves the Red Heifer (outlined in the verses there) which is not something we have available today. Thus every Jew today is already in a certain state of impurity. As such, we are not careful to not consume impure food, as we are already impure.</p>\n<p>To clarify, even if we were all pure, one would generally only choose to avoid eating impure foods if one would have needed to remain pure later on for various sacrificial or Temple related rites. Otherwise impure foods are just as \"kosher\" as pure foods according to the basic letter of the law. Rambam discusses the value of food impurity at the very end of his Laws of Food Impurity (16:12):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על פי שמותר לאכול אוכלין טמאים ולשתות משקין טמאים, חסידים הראשונים היו אוכלין חוליהן בטהרה ונזהרין מן הטומאות כולן כל ימיהן; והן הנקראין פרושים.  ודבר זה קדושה יתרה היא, ודרך חסידות שיהיה אדם נבדל ופורש משאר העם, ולא ייגע בהן ולא יאכל וישתה עימהן:  שהפרישות מביאה לידי טהרת הגוף ממעשים הרעים, וטהרת הגוף מביאה לידי קדושת הנפש מן הדעות הרעות, וקדושת הנפש גורמת להידמות בשכינה, שנאמר \"והתקדשתם והייתם קדושים, כי קדוש אני\" (ויקרא יא,מד).‏</p>\n<p>Even though it is permitted to eat impure foods and drink impure beverages, the pious men of the early generations would partake of their ordinary food in a state of ritual purity and would avoid all of the sources of impurity throughout their lives. They are called <em>perushim</em>.<br />\nThis is an extra measure of holiness and a path to piety: to be separate from people at large, to hold oneself apart from them, not to touch them, nor eat and drink with them. For setting oneself apart leads to the purification of the body from wicked actions. Purifying one's body leads to sanctifying one's soul from wicked character traits. And the holiness of the soul causes one to resemble the Divine presence, as <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0311.htm#44\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Leviticus 11:44</a> states: \"And you shall make yourselves holy; and you shall be holy, because I, God, Who makes you holy, am holy.\"<br />\n(Translation from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1525395/jewish/Chapter-16.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Even in the times of the Beis Hamikdosh (Temple) it was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumah_and_taharah#Mandatory_or_optional\">not mandatory</a> not to eat food defiled by a Nidda; it was a voluntary stringency.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Generally a woman in niddah would have been in a state of confinement, perhaps only providing for herself and anyone else who may have become unclean, perhaps other daughters in the house hold?  Perhaps meals were made for them, by those clean or perhaps they would provide for themselves, this decision would have depended on the individuals take on ritual cleanness, but their decisions would have been undoubtedly been affected by what time in Israel's history these events were to take place, and what unique concerns the household may have been subject to at that time. However please see: Footnote: 1. [H] (from root [H] or [H]) 'isolation', 'impurity'. A menstruant is 'isolated' from her husband and keeps away from other persons and things because, being in her 'impurity' she renders them ritually unclean if she comes into contact with them.

Friday evening is very sweet but short, and you won't really be able to get a good sense of what a service is all about. Plus, you get to see the Torah Reading Service on Saturday. Expect to spend a good 3 hours in synagogue Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>Women and men sit in different sections of the synagogue. Usually (but not always) men and women enter the building through the same door, but then there will be separate doors on the inside which lead to their respective seating sections. You might need to look around first to see which door other men and women are entering before you go in.</p>\n<p>In terms of what to do and what not to do:  Women should wear a dress or skirt that comes down to at least a little below your knees, and not wear slacks. Men should wear a suit or at least a dress shirt and pants. Your top should cover your arms down to at least a little below your elbows. Do not wear a scoop-neck top. Modest jewellery is fine. All men wear a head covering, but only married women wear a head covering. If you're an unmarried woman, do not wear a head covering. If you're a woman, you do not wear a tallit (prayer shawl), either. Do not bring a purse or pocketbook in to the synagogue, and do not bring in cameras or cell phones, either. Really, don't bring anything in with you.</p>\n<p>Sit when everyone else sits, and stand when everyone else stands.</p>\n<p>Yes, you can certainly hold the siddur and the humash (Bible). As Shalom pointed out, however, be very careful not to bring any books into the restroom; leave them on your seat if you need to go.</p>\n<p>There are certain points during the service when we are not allowed to interrupt the prayers by speaking. If you ask someone a question and they hold up a finger to signal \"Wait a minute,\" just wait a minute and they will answer you as soon as they are permitted to talk again. Don't worry about it; it happens all the time that people interrupt other people at a point when they cannot respond. It's completely normal and usual.</p>\n<p>There will always be someone who will be happy and honored to help you follow along in the siddur. Let the details wash over you; if you decide to pursue it, you will learn the details in time. Know, too, that you will not be the first or only person coming in who has never seen a service before. Everyone is at a different level of learning and experience, and it's all okay. May you receive blessings on your journey.</p>\n\n\n",

That point will serve as the core of the devar Torah.</p></li>\n<li><p>Now, start thinking about things you can say about this point:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First of all, what the interesting point is, in your own words</p></li>\n<li><p>Why it's interesting</p></li>\n<li><p>Why you care or even are excited about it</p></li>\n<li><p>How it connects to the context (e.g. the celebration at hand)</p></li>\n<li><p>Some story, joke, other Torah point, etc. that it relates to</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Make a brief list of these points on paper.</p></li>\n<li><p>Look at the list, and think about what would be good to open with, what would be good to close with, what needs to follow what, and what transitions you can make from one point to another, then tentatively number the points in the order you think you'll hit them.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using this list as a rough outline <em>write out a fully-written speech, word for word.</em> Whether you end up saying those particular words or not, going through this process will help you come up with good phrases to use and will help you be sure that the devar Torah will really hang together. Some writing tips:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Try to make everything work together using good transitions, referring back to shared themes, and reminding listeners at the end what you started with at the beginning.</p></li>\n<li><p>Be enthusiastic. Don't be afraid to show your love for Torah and your interest in the topic at hand. Feel free to use the word \"I\" in relating personally to the material, as in \"and then I found this Rashi that just blew me away.\" If you care, so will your listeners.</p></li>\n<li><p>Also, feel free to address your listeners directly as in, \"Listen to these beautiful words of the Ramban,\" or \"What do you think he meant by that?\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Have a beginning that gets people's attention (e.g. a joke, an anecdote, a headline, or a really intriguing question).</p></li>\n<li><p>End on a positive, enthusiastic note. \"Bimheira viyameinu, amein!\" is fine, if it fits, as are \"Mazal Tov!\",  \"Lechaim!\", or other words of blessing.

Err, at this point, on the side of cutting. If you say something interesting, appropriate, clear, and coherent <em>no one</em> will complain that it's too short, ever. On the other hand, the longer it is, the more chances listeners' minds will have to wander, and the more likely that someone will consider it too long.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you really want to deliver it well, practice reading it slowly and clearly a bunch of times, until it really sounds good to you. You may find more to edit as you go.</p></li>\n<li><p>Regarding how you read the devar Torah, there are two choices, each of which can be useful: either read the speech word-for-word or break it down into an outline and work from that. The latter allows for more natural-sounding delivery, if you're confident that you can remember what you want to say and (close enough to) how you want to say it. The former makes it easier to make sure that you hit all the points and phrases that you worked so hard on.</p></li>\n<li><p>Either way, as (or right before) you're giving the devar Torah, if an interesting or amusing ad-lib occurs to you, go for it! There's no reason to turn off your creativity and engagement with the material just because you're finally delivering it. One good example of this would be if what you're saying relates to another speech at the same event.</p></li>\n<li><p>When speaking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Speak slowly, clearly, and loudly enough for everyone to hear. Just as you are very unlikely to speak for too short a period of time, you're also very unlikely to speak either too slowly or too clearly.</p></li>\n<li><p>Try to make eye contact with as many people in the room as possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use expression in your voice and gestures with your hands to make it clear that you're alive.

While no one is locked into one approach, in my experience people tend to have \"favorite\" approaches.  In my minyan, where this duty rotates, I know that Person A is probably going to jump off from some problem in the pshat, Person B is probably going to look at it in terms of historical context, Person C is probably going to draw on midrash, and so on.  Any of these people might surprise me in any given week, of course, and if you don't yet know what approach you're most comfortable with, try several and see what works for you.</p>\n\n<p>The following thoughts are drawn from careful observation (particularly of my rabbi, who I think excels in this area) plus some seminars designed for lay leaders.</p>\n\n<p>First, know your \"audience\".  What is their level of learning?  What are they used to from other speakers?  If it's your community you know this already; if it's not, you'll need to do some investigation.  A d'var can be objectively brilliant and still fall flat because the listeners were either lost (insufficient background) or bored (tell me something I don't already know).  A d'var is given in a context, not in isolation.  (This is less true when you're publishing on the Internet, perhaps, but you asked about speaking.)</p>\n\n<p>Second, choose a manageable amount of material to cover.  A d'var torah that tries to cover an entire parsha in five minutes is going to be shallow and cursory; my advice is instead to pick <em>one thing</em> in it as a jumping-off point.  Maybe that's a problem in the pshat (\"how could he do that?\"), maybe it's a \"minor\" side story like the wood-gatherer in Sh'lach, maybe it's a seeming oddity in the text (\"male and female he created <em>them</em>?\").  From there, you can draw on commentaries or midrash; your goal shouldn't be \"survey what everyone says\" but to build toward some point, selecting commentaries etc as appropriate.  This next part may not work for everybody, but I, following in the footsteps of my betters, try to make it \"relevant\" somehow.  Studying torah for its own sake is great, of course, but when I give a d'var I want people to come away with some idea that they can apply in their lives.  It won't always be a big, grand thing; it may be something small.  And sometimes it may not be an action but a new way of looking at something familiar.  But in my opinion a good d'var causes the listener to feel some investment in what you said, something he'll do or think about differently now.</p>\n\n<p>I've been talking about the parsha as a starting point, but the calendar can also serve this purpose.  Early in Elul you might talk about t'shuva and draw on Psalm 27 or the feelings the daily shofar blast evokes, for example.  I once gave a d'var during late December about assimilation.  Sometimes something going on in the community, either local or broad, will serve as a starting point.</p>\n\n<p>Now, some thoughts about \"nuts and bolts\":</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What you identified as your starting point may or may not be the first thing you say.  I have heard (and I think given) successful divrei torah that start out by telling a personal story/reflection, and then partway through the relevance to the parsha/calendar/community issue/whatever emerges.</p></li>\n<li><p>A homelitics teacher gave me the following advice: <em>always</em> write out your talk in full beforehand, even if you're planning to speak from notes.  I've found that this helps me to get the details of flow, pacing, etc right; if I just practice from notes, I'm more likely to say (during a practice run) \"ok, that part's rough; I'll fix that next time\" -- and not actually do it because I lose track of it.</p></li>\n<li><p>As implied by the previous, practice your talk.  I am always torn between reading the text I wrote, which will provide higher-quality content, or speaking from notes and thus more-easily making eye contact and otherwise connecting with people.  A more-proficient public speaker would be able to speak from a written copy and still look like he's talking to each person in the room; I'm not there yet.  So there's a trade-off, and what your community is used to should inform how you handle this.  (If you do read, try to find some sections that you know well enough that you can look up!)</p></li>\n<li><p>If you're going to read, prepare your copy for that.  Don't just print out your talk in 12-point text (or whatever) and read that; find a size and line spacing that works for you.  I break lines at phrase boundaries (commas or periods) to make delivery more natural.  I mark up my typed copy, underlining places to emphasize, marking longer pauses, etc.  Make any annotations that will help you give a more dynamic rendition.</p></li>\n<li><p>Time yourself in practice, and know whether public speaking tends to make you speed up or slow down.  Aim for your community's average length.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The best speakers <strong>don't waste peoples's time</strong>.

After I was reminded of this question by a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/28465\">recent post</a>, I decided I might as well post my comments here. CYLOR, as usual.</em></p>\n\n<p>If someone kneaded dough on Yom Tov of Pesach, and it became tamei, the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in the Mishna (<em>P'sachim</em> 46a) is that the dough should be baked before challah is separated so that the challah doesn't turn into chametz. R' Eliezer holds that this is not <em>afiya shelo l'tzorech</em> prior to the separation of challah. Rabbeinu Baruch writes that the challah is muktza only after it is separated, since it is not fitting to be eaten in its state of tumah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8917&st=&pgnum=38\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sefer HaT'ruma</em>, <em>Hil. Challah</em>, § 84</a>). </p>\n\n<p>This seems to imply that, <em>binidon didan</em>, the fact that challah has not yet been separated does not intrinsically make the bread muktza. The question remains whether the bread is muktza because it may not be eaten on Yom Tov. Seemingly, the bread would be muktza because it would not be considered a <em>davar shenigmar bidei adam</em> since it cannot be made edible until after yom tov (so we can expect that <em>asach da'tei minaihu</em>) (<em>Mishna B'rura</em>, 310:19).</p>\n\n<p>The bread seemingly may not be baked because, in this case, it would seem to be <em>afiya shelo l'tzorech</em>, as it may not be eaten on Yom Tov. Additionally, it seems that it may not be left to burn because of you cannot burn challah on Yom Tov (<em>Shabbos</em> 24b; <em>Rashi</em>, <em>P'sachim</em> 46a).</p>\n\n<p>Assuming one could not apply the solution described in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/28100\">Meir Zirkind's answer</a>, it would seem that the bread would need to be removed from the oven <em>kil'achar yad</em>. However, it may be logistically difficult to remove bread from a hot oven <em>kil'achar yad</em>; ironically, R' Moshe Feinstein is quoted as saying that it is questionable whether even moving an item backhanded qualifies as <em>kil'achar yad</em> (<em>Igros Moshe</em> OC vol. 5, 22:8).</p>\n\n<p>It is further questionable whether one would be allowed to remove the bread in a normal manner, thus violating the <em>d'rabbanan</em> of muktza, in order to avoid cooking the bread, which would constitute a biblical prohibition. This seems to be related to the topic explored in the <em>sugya</em> of <em>hidbik pas batanur</em> (<em>Shabbos</em> 4a; see <a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2006/04/does-avoiding-issur-doraysa-license.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2006/04/violating-derabbanan-to-avoid-doraysa.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for some discussion of relevant points).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Being that you are allowed to bake bread on Yom Tov, it would follow that you are allowed to do anything you can to eat the bread, including taking off challah, (because without taking off challah the bread is tevel). This is provable from Pesachim 36b/37a: \"...Beis Hillel permit the baking of 'pas aveh' on yom tov... what is 'pas aveh'? 'pas merubeh'\", i.e. a lot of bread, implying even an amount that would be chayav in challah. It would therefore follow that the bread is not muktzeh, being that is is indeed usable- all you need to do is take challah. (For more information on taking challah on Yom Tov, see Pesachim 46a/b.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Not Bentching on a Kos when wine is already on the table\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12261/5\">this answer</a> R' Moshe Feinstein Paskened that, since for many years the practice of Bentching on a Kos (reciting grace after meals over a cup of wine, as formally constructed in the Talmud) was abandoned because wine was scarce and expensive, nowadays we do not need to Bentch on a Kos, even when wine is readily available.</p>\n\n<p>What if there is actually wine on the table, the bottle is open, and the host asked moments before it was decided that everyone would Bentch, \"Does anyone want some more wine?\" (In other words, one need not be shy in taking some, as the host wants the open bottle to be used and not wasted.) Is the Halachah actually that we no longer require it at all, or simply that if it's going to be a burden at all, even if it's just to go to the kitchen to get a bottle, it's not necessary to go to that trouble?  Hence, if it is right in front of you, open, and there is leftover wine that's probably going to be wasted if it isn't consumed, do you have a responsibility to take advantage of it and Bentch on a Kos, or if nobody is really in a mood to drink the wine do we say that then it still isn't necessary?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37782&st=&pgnum=68\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ruach Chayim</a> (by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Palachi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

In the notes, he mentions in the name of the Imrei Noam that the Gematria of the word \"Tapuach\" (the Hebrew word for apple) is the same as the Gematria of \"S'e Akeida\" - so we eat the apple to recall the Akeida (Binding of Isaac).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>1) The Maharil explains that the apple is connected with \"חקל תפוחים קדישין\"; when Yaakov came to get the brochos from Yitzchok, he had the smell of an apple orchard upon his clothing. Besides for the Kabbilistic meanings, (according to one opinion) this episode happened on Rosh Hashana (GR”A O.C. 583:8)</p>\n\n<p>2) There are three types of benefit derived from an apple; taste, sight and smell. This is symbolic of our appeal for sustenance in the three aspects of children, health and livelihood for the entire year (Ben Ish Chai, first year Parshas Nitzavim)</p>\n\n<p>3) It is written in Zohar (Parshas Shmini 4a) that after one drinks wine, they eat an apple in order that the wine should not harm them. Wine represents gevurah (severity) and thus the apple calms the severity. Therefore on Rosh Hashana we eat apples to pacify the harsh judgement. (Ben Ish Chai there)</p>\n\n<p>4) The Zohar (there) states that source of all fruit is from the Divine aspect of malchus (feminine), besides for the apple which is sourced the aspect of Tiferes (male). The Arizal says that the summer months represent malchus and the winter months (Tishrei through to Nissan) are Tifferes. Therefore at the start of the “male” months we eat an apple which comes from “male” source.

It also tells us that this method of division should be used when dividing the aliyot in the synagogue.

The gemarah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=76b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoma 76b</a>) seems to learn it out as a comparison to food consumption: would that mean it has the same shiurim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The <em>Mazal Sha'ah</em> on the Rambam infers that the <em>shi'ur l'chayyev</em> for anointing with <em>t'rumah</em> oil is a <em>k'zayis</em>, based on R' Yehudah's opinion in the gemara (<em>K'risus</em> 6b) who holds that a person is liable for a <em>k'zayis</em> of prohibited anointing with the <em>shemen hamishchah</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=33900&rid=6628\">Commentary to <em>Mishneh Torah</em>, <em>Hil. T'rumos</em> 10:2</a>). (One should note that it is still Biblically forbidden to anoint with even less than a <em>k'zayis</em>, at least in the case of the <em>shemen hamishchah</em>). </p>\n\n<p>Although in those cases the oil itself is a prohibited substance, one might consider further extrapolating the above standard to the prohibition against anointing on Yom Kippur. However, disagreement among the Rishonim about the Biblical or rabbinic status of the anointing prohibition on Yom Kippur suggests that there must at least be no Biblical penalty for anointing. Rashi and the Rambam both maintain that the punishment for violation is <em>makas mardus</em> (<em>Rashi</em> on the <em>Rif</em>, <em>Shabbos</em>, Chapter 9; Rambam's <em>Peirush HaMishnayos</em>, <em>Shabbos</em> 9:4, and <em>Tosafos Yom Tov</em>, ibid., who clarifies the Rambam's position). The lack of a Biblical penalty is confirmed by the <em>Yerushalmi</em> (<em>Yoma</em> 8:1; see also <em>Korban HaEidah</em> ibid., s.v. <em>Aval lo l'onesh</em>)  Therefore, the issue of a liable quantity seems moot.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a lengthy halachic discussion by Dayan Y.Y. Fisher (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=146&rid=4971\"><em>Even Yisrael</em>, <em>Hil. Ma'achalos Asuros</em> 17:27</a>) yields the conclusion that, according to those Rishonim who view anointing as Biblically forbidden, the Biblical prohibition against consuming a <em>chatzi shiur</em> of nourishment on Yom Kippur may be derived from the prohibition against anointing (which is itself derived from <em>Daniel</em>, 10:3,12). This seems to be premised on the lack of a minimum <em>shi'ur</em> for anointing on Yom Kippur.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, the <em>Semag</em> distinguishes between Biblically and rabbinically prohibited anointing, though not in terms of the quantity of ointment used. He maintains that a criterion for the Biblical prohibition against anointing on Yom Kippur is anointing the entire body, while anointing even part of the body is forbidden rabbinically (<em>Tosafos Y'shanim</em>, <em>Yoma</em> 77b). This view is echoed by the <em>Mabit</em> (<em>Kiryas Sefer</em>, <em>Hil. Sh'visas Asor</em>, 3). </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://ybm.org.il/hebrew/LessonArticle.aspx?item=1303\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://rygb.blogspot.com/2005/07/daf-halachah-shabbos-86a-partial.html\">here</a> for further halachic discussion on this topic.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, if most married women in a community don't don a wig or head scarf, would this be acceptable behaviour for the convert as well? If a convert was super-observant during the conversion process and then after their conversion gradually became as relaxed as the other members of the community in terms of observance, would their conversion be invalidated? I guess the gist of my question is, is a convert expect to assimilate to the community they are joining, or are they expected to be super super observant, even if this means exceeding the norms of that community?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It's not surprising that if someone's lifestyle is being evaluated, that a higher standard is expected. This has been frustrating for many a convert (as well as born Jews who've affiliated with a more-observant lifestyle).</p>\n\n<p>In theory, conversion is instant and irreversible. One second before converting, the would-be convert could eat pork all s/he likes. One second afterwards (if we magically knew the convert was <em>totally sincere</em> at the time of commitment), there could be all the regret in the world, still, no pork allowed. A rabbi could meet conversion-candidate \"John\", who is 100% absolutely sincere about committing to keeping kosher. But given how unstable John's lifestyle is (e.g. he lives on a college campus with no kosher meal plan and zero other Jews in a hundred-mile radius), John is likely to stop keeping kosher soon. If so, the rabbi may not want to convert John as he'll just be causing him to sin.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ruled that conversion requires \"sincere intent to observe all the commandments\", with the caveat \"as best the candidate understands it at the moment.\" Someone asked him -- \"when I converted, somewhere in the back of my mind I knew that if I was threatened with being fired rather than work on Jewish holidays, I probably would have gone into work that day\" -- well, people make serious commitments all the time that are tested -- Rabbi Feinstein ruled that conversion was still valid. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, regarding an individual who recently converted in a Sabbath-observant community where married women don't usually cover their hair (outside of synagogue) and many lay people eat fish-baked-in-foil at non-kosher restaurants (<strong>I do not condone this practice</strong>), Rabbi Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff commented that her conversion was valid even if she did likewise, as she accepted Judaism to the best of her understanding -- and her understanding was based on what she saw her Jewish colleagues doing.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the Talmud says that converts can make things difficult on born-Jews, with one explanation being that the sincerity of their practice puts \"the mainstream\" to shame!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As a convert myself, I can tell you that the newby convert not only seeks acceptance, but worries about rejection; some more than others.  As a result, it is a natural tendency to err to the strict side.  I would add that converts of color and others whose physical characteristics makes it impossible to \"pass,\" tend to be even more strict in their observance and dress.  This tendency long precedes my experience and is recognized in the Talmud.  There is a Gemara, Pesachim 91b,  which banned a group consisting only of converts from bringing their own Passover offering.  The idea there was that a group of converts only would be extra-strict and might mistakenly find a defect in a perfectly good offering.  (But see Tosafos at Pesachim 91b Who points to other views that converts are less stringent.)  There are numerous comments, as well, on Rabbi Chelbo's comment that converts are like a \"scab,\" some interpreting this to mean that converts can be so strict that it can be embarrassing for Jews from birth.  See Tosafos to Kiddushin 70b who quotes R' Avraham the Ger who said that because converts are more meticulous than born Jews, they underscore the shortcomings of born Jews.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In a review <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/746045/Rabbi_Daniel_Stein/Hilchos_Geirus_Review_5770\" rel=\"nofollow\">class about conversion</a>, Rabbi Daniel Stein said that a conversion is invalid if the convert did not intend to accept all the commandments.  Figuring out from later behavior what constitutes a failure of intent to accept, as opposed to later sinning is difficult.  He suggests there that activities within 30 days may be grounds for invalidation of a conversion.  He also says that there is no requirement that they think they will never sin.  So if a convert speaks some lashon hara (presumably even within 30 days) that does not invalidate the conversion.</p>\n\n<p>Applying this to the case discussed by the questioner: If a convert says, \"I have no intent of covering my hair when married.\" that would be an invalid conversion.  If on the other hand after a significant period if she stops covering her hair due to social pressure, or even if she never covers her hair, assuming she doesn't marry until some time after conversion, she might be a sinner, but she is still Jewish. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# גמר חתימה טובה gender\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During the nine and a half days ending with <em>Yom Kipur</em>, we wish each other \"גמר חתימה טובה\" (an end to the good signing). This seems very strange. Shouldn't it be \"גמר חתימה טוב\" (a good end to the signing)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I'm not sure, but I think that it's actually being pronounced \"גמר חתימה-טובה\".\n(The last two words are connected.)</p>\n\n<p>And it is correct (grammatically) to say \"חתימה טובה\"....</p>\n\n<p>To my opinion, the meaning is \"I wish to you that the good-signing will end well for you\".</p>\n\n<p>I may be wrong, but that's what I have in mind when I'm telling people \"גמר חתימה-טובה\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The question is entirely apt, because it gets to the heart of the nature of the possessive form in Hebrew, called \"construct state\" in English and \"סמיכות\" in Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>The question recognizes that the first term in a possessive relationship between two nouns, (called a \"construct chain,\" which can include any number of nouns from two, on up) is the term that controls the gender and number of the chain. Meanwhile, the second term determines whether the chain is definite (with the definite article) or absolute (without).</p>\n\n<p>Hence: בית הכנסת הגדול</p>\n\n<p>\"Beit\" is in the construct form, signaling a possessive relationship, and governing the qualifier \"ha-gadol\" in gender (m) and number (sing.).</p>\n\n<p>The \"ha\" in \"ha-knesset\" determines the definite status of the chain (i.e., characterized by the definite article \"ha\") and, therefore, of its qualifier \"ha-gadol.\"</p>\n\n<p>In all of this, over the years, confusion has crept in. The Ashkenazic synagogue in Venice, Italy, for example, is called the בית הכנסת הגדולה. They did not mean the \"House of the Great Assembly.\" They meant, rather, the \"Great Synagogue,\" so they should have used the masc. qualifier \"ha-gadol.\"</p>\n\n<p>Still, this mistake lies at the heart of the question and one of the answers. Does גמר חתימה טובה intend to wish \"a good end to the sealing [in the Book of Life]\" or \"an completion for the good sealing\"?</p>\n\n<p>There is a clue to this problem, found in our common abbreviation of this greeting: גמר טוב, which implies that the \"completion\" is the thing at stake. However, we also abbreviate with the phrase \"חתימה טובה,\" implying that the \"seal\" is the thing.</p>\n\n<p>After some research, it seems to me that, strictly speaking, it should be גמר חתימה טוב, because this is how the construct chain works canonically, notwithstanding the reasonable logic, proposed above, that we might introduce (if only in our minds) a maqqef (dash that unites two words) into חתימה-טובה and therefore construe it as a single idea/unit. Standard grammar doesn't really go there, though perhaps there are biblical examples of it (I didn't research that far).</p>\n\n<p>If one wants to wish \"a completion to a good sealing\" then one would, strictly speaking, have to re-word the phrase to something like גמר של חתימה טובה, which would obviate the grammatical problem, though simultaneously introduce a stylistic one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Academy of the Hebrew Language (see <a href=\"https://hebrew-academy.org.il/2018/09/16/%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%90%D7%95-%D7%92%D7%9E%D7%A8-%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91%D7%94/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> – in Hebrew), the phrase refers to the גמר of the חתימה טובה. I admit that this is strange and, as far as I know, such a construct is considered non-standard. But I guess many such expressions have been coined over the generations – in periods where Hebrew was no one's native language – and they've been preserved till today. It's a pity that the Academy's explanation on the page linked to above is so laconic, though. Maybe it's explained in more detail somewhere out there.</p>\n\n\n",

The explanation always given (see, for example, the commentary of Rav Ovadia of Bartenura) is that marital relations are forbidden on Yom Kippur: those who do not light candles do so so as not to see one's spouse and desire them while those who do light candles do so because since it will be light they will not think of having marital relations, something only done in darkness.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch rules this way in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 610:1</a> and the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/14738/759\">pseudo</a>-Rama even comments that those who light Yom Kippur candles (which I think nowadays is everyone) should light them in the room s/he sleeps in.

To get around this issue, some of these stores offer the option to request Chalav Yisroel milk for those who need it.</p>\n\n<p>For visualization purposes: the store carries a Chalav Yisroel milk bottle. When a customer requests it, the storekeeper will substitute the standard milk with the milk from the Chalav Yisroel bottle.</p>\n\n<p>My question, though, is whether this actually helps the Chalav Stam/Akum issue? After all, if the milk bottle is sitting in the store throughout the day, do we not suspect that the storekeeper (who's presumably a gentile) may mix the milk? Shouldn't this \"Chalav Yisroel\" milk once again become Chalav Stam/Akum milk?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Clarification: My question is due to my understanding that milk in particular requires an extra level of supervision. For example, in order to make milk Chalav Yisroel, it is required to have a Jew supervise the actual milking process. This is very much unlike other products where concepts such as נכנס ויוצא (perhaps best translated as \"spot checking\") do work.</p>\n\n<p>So: the hechsher I referred to in this case is merely serving the purpose of providing a basic level of Kosher supervision - and confirming that the milk in question does indeed qualify for the \"Chalav Stam\" leniency. The milk in question, on the other hand <strong>was</strong> at one point Chalav Yisroel (according to the label), but is <strong>now</strong> sitting in the store - open and unsupervised. Does this change its status?</p>\n\n<p>[If it helps: it's also possible to construct this case without any hechsher at all: simply pick your favorite unflavored coffee scenario that's permissible anywhere and add a Chalav Yisroel milk bottle.

But <strong>still</strong>, it has the status of minhag.</p>\n<p>Either parallel to this, or subsequent to this, the practice in some communities was not to whip. You can ask, perhaps, whether this initial lack of practice was justified, or was a deviation from an initial practice. But regardless, the minhag developed not to whip. Minhagim often develop organically, as folk practice is wont to do, or for valid halachic reasons. This minhag then stands in its place in opposition to the minhag which happened to be recorded in Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>If so, we don't need a <strong>textual</strong> justification for a minhag, even if that minhag is the opposite of a minhag recorded in Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>Can we compare this to kitniyot? Sure. There is a prevalent custom not to eat kitniyot. If someone who was an Ashkenazi wanted to go against that custom, there might be a problem that  אינו כדאי והגון לזה שיתיר דבר שאבותינו ואבות אבותינו נהגו איסור. And there are such precedents in the gemara. But nullifying a customary prohibition is different from nullifying an <em>action</em>, and keeping one's community's established nullification of said action is even more different.</p>\n<h1>2</h1>\n<p>I would need to see the Rosh inside, but this idea of punishing oneself in order to obtain kappara seems characteristic of the sorts of tortures the Chassidei Ashkenaz used to inflict upon themselves to atone for various sins. Rolling around naked in the snow, fasting, etcetera. This approach to life, in general, has fallen out of vogue. Do teshuva, regretting what you did and resolving not to repeat it, and Hashem will forgive you. You don't need to also undergo torture. (Of course, as the sources point out, this is not administered by bet din of semuchim, and so it is just a zecher to move someone to teshuva.)</p>\n\n\n",

I have with my Rebbe's help tried to follow Jewish customs and laws, to my best ability. Furthermore, I and my wife give generously to Jewish orphanages in Israel. We have lost many friends over this. However, I am still a Goy.</p>\n\n<p>A few days ago I came across Tractate Sanhedrin 59a which states that a gentile who studies Torah is liable for death. Am I now liable to be stoned for my devotion to Hashem and the Jewish people?</p>\n\n<p>I don't like this to become an obstacle for me.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>Rabbi Chaim Clorfene writes in his popular (and heavily annotated) book, <em>The Path of the Righteous Gentile</em> (p. 42), that B'nei Noach should learn parts of the Torah relevant to their service of God, as well as to the Torah's view on God. He adds that this can be broadly applied, as many areas of Torah \"can bring one to greater knowledge concerning the performance of the Seven Noahide Commandments.\" He continues that \"Talmudic or Halakhic study of subjects that pertain <em>exclusively</em> (emphasis added) to the Jew's service of God is forbidden.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Meiri (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 59a), as paraphrased in <a href=\"http://koshertorah.com/PDF/Non-Jew-&-Kabbalah.pdf\">this article</a>, writes: \"The seven laws of the Righteous Gentile, similar to the 613 laws for the Jew, have many different levels of understanding and many details of application. Most aspects of the Torah are therefore included in them.\" For example, the Rema rules that non-Jews should abide by halachah in areas of commerce (Shu\"t 10). This would imply that a non-Jew should learn most of <em>Choshen Mishpat</em>, a massive undertaking.</p>\n\n<p>The above link also cites Rabbi Eliyahu Touger as writing that, to help one \"become aware of G-d's unity... a number of contemporary Sages have suggested the translation of certain basic Chassidic and Kabbalistic texts into English with the intent that they be studied by gentiles.\"</p>\n\n<p>The linked article concludes with the statement of R' Meir (<em>Bava Kamma</em> 38a, referring to Torah topics that are permissible to learn): \"A Gentile who studies Torah is like a High Priest.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Also, from <a href=\"http://e.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/shiur.asp?id=14572\">this article</a>: \"There is a dispute among poskim whether one may teach a non-Jew Torah if the non-Jew is planning to convert. The Meiri (Sanhedrin 58b) and Maharsha (Shabbos 31a s.v. amar lei mikra) rule that it is permitted, whereas Rabbi Akiva Eiger forbids it (Shu\"t #41).\" This, of course, only refers to the parts of Torah that would otherwise be forbidden to teach a non-Jew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>To answer your more specific question: no, a Gentile who studies Torah in a forbidden way is still not stoned. The Rambam rules (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e510.htm#12\">Milchamot 10:9</a> and <a href=\"http://beta.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188355/jewish/Chapter-10.htm\">English</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם עסק בתורה, או שבת, או חידש דבר--מכין אותו ועונשין אותו, ומודיעין אותו שהוא חייב מיתה על זה; אבל אינו נהרג.‏<br>\n  If a gentile studies the Torah, makes a Sabbath, or creates a religious practice, a Jewish court should beat him, punish him, and inform him that he is obligated to die. However, he is not to be executed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suppose the \"death penalty\" here is more a statement of severity than a court order.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Because of the length, I am including this as a separate answer:</p>\n\n<p>As far as a death penalty for studying forbidden topics, the <em>Lechem Mishneh</em> commentary on the Rambam writes that there is no actual death penalty in this case, whether judicial or divine. He writes that it is a non-literal, rabbinic \"death penalty\" (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=94133&rid=15012\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Hil. Melachim</em>, 10:9</a>; see ad loc where he writes that there are other places [e.g. <em>Hil. Melachim</em>, 10:6] where the death penalty is figurative). </p>\n\n<p>Presumably he means that a figurative death penalty was mentioned in order to convey the significance of the Torah as God's special and intimate bond with the Jewish people (<em>B'rachos</em> 57a), and the gravity of violating that bond. That is why, according to the Rambam, in a time and place where rabbinic courts had legal jurisdiction over the populace, non-Jews who were convicted of studying forbidden topics were liable to be severely chastised and punished by the court, or even flogged (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=83&perek=10&halocha=9&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Hil. Melachim</em>, 10:9</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The seemingly hyperbolic choice of words is consistent with the Talmudic approach of emphasis through exaggeration (see <em>Tamid</em> 29a; see also examples from <em>Sotah</em> 10b and <em>Yerushalmi</em>, <em>Pe'ah</em> 4a). In fact, <em>Tosafos</em> discuss a Talmudic statement that a certain act carries a heavenly death penalty, and conclude that the usage of the term \"death penalty\" in that context is non-literal and \"merely symbolic\" (<em>Rosh HaShanah</em> 12a, s.v. <em>Tana d'Rabbanan</em>). </p>\n\n<p>Mind you, there are prohibitions that carry an actual heavenly death penalty (see <em>Sanhedrin</em> 83a for a list), though such a penalty is not irrevocable. Unlike with a judicial death penalty, sincere repentance can absolve one of <em>kareis</em> (lit. excision, this punishment is interpreted in different ways) or a divine death penalty (<em>Makkos 13b</em>).</p>\n\n\n",

Dessler, Michtav MeEliyahu, II, p.94, the sins enumerated in על חטא litany are not primarily individual acts, but personal flaws that lead people to sin. One can also have a clue for why this is the case from the first letters of the enumerated sins from each section making the word <strong>אֶכֶף</strong> / <em>presure, burden</em> as a connection to the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.33.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 33:7</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִנֵּ֣ה אֵ֭מָתִי לֹ֣א תְבַעֲתֶ֑ךָּ וְ֝<strong>אַכְפִּ֗</strong>י עָלֶ֥יךָ לֹֽא־יִכְבָּֽד׃</p>\n<p>You are not overwhelmed by fear of me; My <em>pressure</em> does not weigh heavily on you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which causes people to err due to presence of personal flaws. The second acrostic from last letters of each section, when read backwards makes the word <strong>תֹעֵי</strong> - <em>confused, straying</em> as a hint to a verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.29.24?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishayahu 29:24</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְיָדְע֥וּ <strong>תֹֽעֵי</strong>־ר֖וּחַ בִּינָ֑ה וְרוֹגְנִ֖ים יִלְמְדוּ־לֶֽקַח׃</p>\n<p>And the <em>confused</em> of spirit shall acquire insight, And grumblers accept instruction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>once people make <em>teshuvah</em>. Perhaps, the division is set based on these acrostics.</p>\n<p>One can also obseve that the same rule seems to be working with the division of the <em>viduy</em>, although not as perfectly.

However, to address your point about \"a prayer\":</p>\n\n<p>One must recite a <em>b'rachah</em> upon slaughtering an animal, which is the typical practice when performing <em>mitzvos</em> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=2&hilchos=10&perek=11&halocha=15&hilite=\">Rambam, <em>Hil. B'rachos</em> 11:15</a>). However, as usual with <em>birkas hamitzvos</em>, the absence of this blessing does not render the slaughtering unfit (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=19\"><em>Bi'ur HaGra</em>, YD 1:31</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldad_ha-Dani\">Eldad Ha-Dani</a>, in his account of the religious practices of his claimed Jewish tribe in Africa, wrote that meat slaughtered without a <em>b'rachah</em> is forbidden. However, as the linked Wikipedia article notes, a number of Rishonim have considered his account unreliable (e.g. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39939&st=&pgnum=45\">Ibn Ezra, Commentary to <em>Sh'mos</em> 2:22</a>). Regardless, Eldad's extra-Talmudic requirements in <em>hilchos sh'chitah</em> are not accepted in practice (<em>Bi'ur HaGra</em>, YD 1:30).</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, it is not the blessing that primarily characterizes Jewish slaughter; it is rather the careful attention to the many detailed and subtle laws governing the slaughter of kosher meat, as well as the fact the the slaughterer must be a God fearing and halachically observant Jew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Kudos to both answers above; just one more point: after the ainmal is slaughtered by a Jew according to Jewish law, the meat is then inspected, soaked, and salted; then it can be packaged in a reasonably tamper-proof container and shipped off and sold at any general supermarket. So you don't have to go to a \"kosher butcher shop\" per se.</p>\n\n\n",

However, the Talmud (Sukkah 29a) explicitly forbids keeping lit candles in a small Sukkah and this is codified in Shulchan Aruch (OC 639:1). The Mishna Berura there (sk 8) is clear that this doesn't mean the minimum possible Sukkah (7x7 tefachim) but rather any Sukkah which is small enough for there to be a risk of fire. If your Sukkah is such a risk, then you should light candles on an indoor windowsill or something adjacent to the Sukkah (where you can see them) if possible. If this is not possible, then you can light them inside but you must be sure to have them last long enough that you derive benefit from them at night (even after your meal); otherwise the brachot you said when lighting them were in vain (Shulchan Aruch OC 263:9).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Technically, yes. Candles should be lit on the Yom Tov or Shabbos table, or at the very least in the same room (unless there is a danger, such as young children who can get hurt). Succos would be no exception (barring any danger of course). Also, the Succah is meant to be like your home so everything important should ideally be done there (including, for example, davening, if you're not at shul).</p>\n\n<p>I have seen many people who light in the Succah. One solution, which we do in our home, is to get special \"outdoor\" candles/candle holders that protect from the wind. They often use regular tea lights.</p>\n\n<p>On YT, the candles can easily be moved, so they don't have to be left out there when no one is around (shabbos becomes more complicated and it wouldn't be safe to leave candles unattended in the Succah).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Oh, goodness, I would say no.

Therefore [the night after Yom Kippur] is different from the night after any other festival, when a blessing is not recited over [fire].</p>\n<p>[The rationale is that] a blessing is recited over fire only at the time when it was brought into being, i.e., on the night after <em>Shabbos</em>, when fire was first created, or on the night after Yom Kippur, when fire is like a new entity for us, as was explained above.</p>\n<p>5. On the night after Yom Kippur, the blessing is not recited over fire that was produced [that night] from flint or wood, nor over fire that was kindled from such fire, but only over fire that \"rested\" from work, such as a lamp that has been alight since the eve of Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>On the night after [any] <em>Shabbos</em>, a blessing may be recited over fire that was produced from flint or wood, because it was in this manner that fire was originally created on the night after [the first] <em>Shabbos</em>. As [our Sages relate, on the night after the first <em>Shabbos</em> of creation] Adam took two stones, struck them together, brought forth fire, and recited the blessing <em>borei meorei ha'esh</em>, [praising G-d as \"the Creator of the lights of fire\"]. Hence on the night following [any] <em>Shabbos</em>, the blessing may be recited over any fire (unless it was used for forbidden labor on <em>Shabbos</em>, as stated in sec. 298[:7]) - even over fire produced at that time from flint, for this resembles the way it was originally brought into being.</p>\n<p>On the night after Yom Kippur, by contrast, the reason for this blessing is that\none was unable to benefit [from fire] on that day, and now this is permitted. Hence,\nthe blessing should be recited only over fire that actually \"rested,\" i.e., that was\nkindled on the day before Yom Kippur and \"rested\" throughout the day of Yom\nKippur. Even when Yom Kippur falls on <em>Shabbos</em>, the blessing should be recited -\nat night, at the close of the holy day - only over fire that was kindled on the day\nbefore Yom Kippur and \"rested\" throughout the day of Yom Kippur, to show that\nthis day was sanctified in that fire was not kindled during that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torahlab.org/calendar/article/the_well_rested_candle/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TorahLab</a> give the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Yom Kippur we are celebrating the fact that we hadn’t used fire all day.

Rabbi Hershel Schachter recalls planning the wedding of one of his sons, where the bride's parents asked if he'd officiate. Rabbi Schachter replied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Well ... if you do the wedding in the daytime then it should be someone else; if we do the wedding at nighttime then we're not trying to accommodate the court-function opinion, so then I could officiate.

As the new Jewish day starts then, you get a whole mess about exactly what date the <em>ketubah</em> document has (let's say that's signed just before sunset), vs. when the ceremony actually happens (let's say just after sunset).

But I included it since it's instructive.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>9) At present, people at large have adopted the practice of following\n  a lenient approach when it comes to sleeping [in the sukkah).

Hence the fact that a person does not desire to separate\n  from his wife is considered a matter associated with a mitzvah, and\n  whoever is occupied with the performance of a mitzvah is exempt from\n  performing a different mitzvah, as explained in sec. 640[:18]. Thus [a\n  married man] is not obligated to sleep in the sukkalt at night. [The\n  above line of thought applies] even if one's wife is not ritually\n  pure, for she is happy when her husband shares the privacy of their\n  room with her, as will be explained. Nevertheless, it is desirable\n  that one follow the stringent approach and have a private sukkah where\n  he can sleep together with his wife, and thus perform both mitzvos.</p>\n  \n  <p>10) [The following laws apply when a man) marries a virgin bride two\n  or three days before the festival and thus the seven days of the\n  [wedding] celebrations extend into the festival. (Weddings are not\n  held on Sukkos itself, as stated in sec.\n  546.) In earlier generations, it was customary for the bride and groom to spend all seven days of the [marriage] celebrations secluded in a\n  private room called a chuppah. Other people would join them only at\n  times when they wanted to celebrate with them and eat and drink with\n  them.</p>\n  \n  <p>The groom, his attendants, and all the bridal company - i.e., the men\n  who eat with the groom- are exempt from [the mitzvah of] the sukkah\n  for all seven days of the [wedding] celebrations. They are permitted\n  to eat, drink, and celebrate outside the sukkah, i.e., in the room\n  called the chuppah. One cannot celebrate properly in a sukkah, because\n  one can truly rejoice only in the chupppah, which is essentially where\n  the bride and groom dwell; it is here that are alone. The essential\n  dwelling place of the bride and the groom cannot be in a sukkah, for a\n  [typical] sukkah has only three walls and is open on the fourth side.\n  A groom would be embarrassed to rejoice with his bride in such a\n  place.</p>\n  \n  <p>Today, therefore, when a sukkah is customarily built with four walls,\n  even a groom is obligated [to observe the mitzvah of] sukkah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See Mishna Berura siman 639 se'if katan 18, where he says it's apparent from many Achronim that sleeping in the sukkah does not override mitzvas onah (for one who doesn't have the ability to sleep with his wife in the sukkah, for example if he doesn't have a private sukkah available), and afterwards he does not have to leave and sleep the rest of the night in the sukkah.</p>\n\n\n",

No matter what a person does (even if he tries to convert), once Jewish, always Jewish.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On others it's says that non jews should not follow Torah. In particular sabbath observance is no no.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not \"In particular\" but rather \"specifically\". Non-jews should not keep Shabbath - but it does not say non-jews should not follow the Torah, in fact quite the opposite, they should, and they will be rewarded for it. Note that some of the laws in the Torah are specifically for Jews, and for a non-jew to do them would be pointless. But not the rest.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Say, because I am not jewish I must not follow Torah. Should I kill, steal, murder, etc.?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This one is actually specifically commanded to non-jews as well, in the form of the 7 laws of Noah. If you have not heard of that, please google it, there are lots of good sites with info.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Should I work on Sabbath? What's the difference?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The difference is that Shabbath was specifically commanded to Jews. Some commandments were given to humanity as a whole, others were given just to Jews. Someone who is not Jewish does not need to observe those, his soul simply does not require it in order to be fulfill it's mission in life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I'll try to clarify:</p>\n\n<p>The Jews have 613 commandments; non-Jews have the seven Noahide laws:</p>\n\n<p>DON'T DO:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Murder </li>\n<li>Idolatry</li>\n<li>Adultery/incest/bestiality/etc.</li>\n<li>Eat a limb torn off a live animal</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31897/is-g-ddamn-considered-cursing-god\">Curse G-d</a></li>\n<li>Steal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>YES DO:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Establish and uphold laws necessary for the functioning of society (i.e. vote and pay your taxes!)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yes the Bible says \"don't work on Sabbath, you ... or your ox ... or the foreigner around you.\" But the Talmud points out that as cutting grass from the earth is considered \"work\", does that mean my ox isn't allowed to go eat? No! Rather, the Bible is saying: \"Don't work on sabbath, and don't <em>make</em> your ox or a foreigner work <em>on your behalf</em>. (In the reiteration of the Ten Commandments, it actually fills in -- \"so they can rest too.\") By the way, sometimes when the Bible says \"foreigner\" (\"Ger\" in Hebrew), it means a non-Jew; other times it means a convert.</p>\n\n<p>So we have no expectation whatsoever of non-Jews keeping anything other than the seven laws. As stated above, the Talmud actually says it's tricky if non-Jews study Torah (it's described as \"an heirloom for the people of Jacob\") or keep the sabbath (\"it is forever a sign between [G-d] and the children of Israel\") because those are described as highlighting the special role of the Jewish people. But otherwise -- you want to eat pork? Fine. You don't? Also fine. Really makes no difference to us.</p>\n\n<p>Someone Jewish can not, however, just up and declare themselves not-Jewish and thus get out of the 613 (actually, out of the remaining 606). If someone wasn't born Jewish and then converted, in theory conversion is instant and irreversible; however, conversion requires full commitment. If someone's actions right after conversion prove that the commitment was a joke, that means that no conversion happened to begin with.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>All of humanity should obey Torah.

A device which can shut off everything during davenning, would not have this problem.)</li>\n<li>One should be able to Daven without distractions, including looking for things in a siddur, so he should have page numbers all written down.

    "content": "# Christian believe in the Noahide Laws, will they end up in heaven?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Some Christians believe in <strong>and live according to</strong> the Noachide Laws. According to Judaism, <strong>doesn't this qualify them for heaven?</strong> I know blasphemy is in that list, but Christians Genuinely believe that Jesus is the messiah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Blasphemy is not the problem — it refers to cursing G-d with His name (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=14992\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Melachim 9:3</a>). The problem is idolatry, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89/is-christianity-avodah-zara\">many hold</a> that Christianity is idolatry. However, the Rambam writes elsewhere (ֲ<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=83&perek=8&halocha=11&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 8:11</a>) that a non-Jew only has a portion in the World to Come for doing the things he is commanded in if he does them because G-d commanded them; if he does them because they seem to be good things to do, even if G-d didn't command them, then this doesn't apply.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>There any many passionate feelings and positions regarding this issue. There is no one correct answer. Some say Christianity is shituf (acceptable idolatry?) yet others feel it is simply idolatry. I even heard an interpretation saying that G-d dislikes the notion of a partnership (Jesus) more than idolatry. </p>\n\n<p>Be it as it may, I think that Maimonides criticized Christianity. I think what bothered him the most was the notion that there are three gods. He felt strongly that this is philosophically impossible. Nevertheless, Moslems who worship Allah (one G-d) are considered Noahide. Can Chrisitan non-Jews practice the Seven Noahide Laws?</p>\n\n<p>Surprising as it may sound, the Bible actually never make mention of these commands, known as the Seven Noahide Laws, commandments which G-d gave Noah after the flood. The seven Noahide commandments are part of the “Oral Torah,” the unwritten parts of the Torah. Although there is no source for this, these laws are explicable in nature and could be considered the basic laws of humanity, applicable to all human beings. But people should not observe these laws simply to have a place in “the world to come.” I think that G-d wants people to act as if there is no G-d. That is to say, if people recognize a need to be done, people should help people and society, and act as if there is no G-d and nothing will be done to resolve the problem unless they do what needs to be done. For the sages taught in Avot: do not observe the mitzvot shelo lishmah: “not for the sake [of the Torah] itself.” </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, people can't observe the commands because G-d said so since G-d is incorporeal. Maimonides explains in his Guide of the Perplexed 1:65 that whenever the Torah says that G-d “said” or “spoke” something, it should be read as “thought”  or “willed,” for G-d has no mouth with which to speak. God has no vocal cords. For example, in Genesis 1, G-d did not speak or utter words during the act of creation, but “willed” creation into existence. Similarly, the conversation G-d had with Noah was a dream. A person does good acts because it is the right thing to do, as it is the will of G-d, and avoids doing evil because it is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>In any event, even those who stress the importance of the commands, the mitzvot, all agree that the ultimate goal of humans is to develop their intelligence. Maimonides felt that knowing about G-d's creations (the laws of nature) and an understanding of how they function (the impact of natural laws) is essential. For Maimonides insisted that the basic human duty is to know about G-d; and since it is impossible to know the essence of G-d, he stressed the need to understand the laws of nature that G-d created or formed so as to improve themselves and society (Guide of the Perplexed 1:1).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, any observance of commands is a means to help people better understand G-d. If a non-Jew observes the Noahide commands and knows their divine origin, but fails to acquire knowledge, they have failed and in this respect, is no different from a Jew who does not develop their mind. </p>\n\n\n",

However what exactly is the \"chag\" of Shmini Etzeres. Sukkos we are commemorating the Anei HaKavod, Pesach is Yetzias Metzriam, Shavuos is Matan Torah. What exactly are we \"celebrating\" on Shmini Etzeres?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Interestingly, the Torah itself doesn't mention anything special we are celebrating, nor does it give any specific Mitzvah to relate to (besides the special קרבן מוסף).</p>\n\n<p>The Yalkut Pinchas 782(ילקוט שמעוני פרשת פנחס רמז תשפב) brings a משל (from TB <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.55b.9?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukah 55b</a>) describing Sukot as a party a king has with many friends. When the party is over he asks his son to stay a bit longer to have time only with him.

It seems always to mean, according to most commentaries I've seen, something along the lines of rally/get-together/group. This goes well with what I've written previously - us having a party with <em>Hashem</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One may note, that שביעי של פסח and שבועות use this term as well. For שביעי של פסח Yonatan Ben Uziel translated (English mine) <code>get together in praise to Hashem</code>. As these times are all an end of a period, this getting together seems like a summary or חשבון נפש, resembling what @Isaac brought.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Below is what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Hirsch</a> says on the subject (Commentary on <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0323.htm#36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev. 23:36</a>, on p. 684 - 686 of the original <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0910818126\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levy translation</a>, with italicized transliterations, elisions, and added paragraph divisions by me).</p>\n<p>Very brief summary: The special nature of the holiday is indicated by its name \"Atzeret,\" meaning \"a preserving summing up\" (R' Hirsch's translation), and the fact that it's on a separate day from the rest of Sukkot. These elements tell us that we're meant to focus on gathering all the lessons of Sukkot and the entire year's worth of holidays to help us lead the rest of our lives in the presence and service of God.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The denomination of this special <em>mo'ed</em>-day runs: - <em>atzeret hee</em>. ... If we examine the places where the root <em>'aTzR</em> is used in <em>Tanach</em>, we find, in the far predominating number of cases, that it has the meaning of retaining, keeping back persons, things, or forces to guard against their becoming withdrawn or lost. ... We accordingly thing we are not wrong if we take <em>atzeret</em> to designate a day which is not fixed to bring new lessons and new truths for us to accept and assimilate, but which has the mission to keep us still before the presence of God ... to strengthen and solidify the impressions and knowledge we have already gained, so that they remain with us permanently, and do not become lost in the hurly-burly of life.</p>\n<p>This would be entirely in accordance with the designation of the last day of a festival. Take <em>Pesach</em>: for six days we have lived permeating oursevles with all the facts and teachings which the <em>yetziat-Mitzrayim</em>-thoughts pledge and grant us, the Children of Israel. The seventh day is <em>atzeret</em> (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0516.htm#8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 16:8</a>), it is a gathering up of all the spiritual \"treasures\" that we have collected during the days of the Festival before the Presence of God, so that we can, at the end of this seventh day, step over into the course of our ordinary life which then begins, truly enriched by them.</p>\n<p>The purpose of <em>atzeret</em> is accomplished by our realising once again all that we have gained by the festival, and by the firm resolution not to allow ourselves to be robbed in the turmoil and struggle and work of our lives of what we have won. Therein lies the dual conception of <em>'aTzR</em>: persistance, remaining with God, and holding fast to all the spiritual acquisitions obtained, both really at the bottom coming to the same thing.</p>\n<p>Now, it <em>atzeret</em> were on the seventh day of <em>Sukot</em>, it would only have the meaning of summing up and holding fast to the teachings which have been given to us by the Festival of <em>Sukot</em>. But as <em>atzeret</em> here comes <em>bashemini</em> as an independent festival on its own, and makes the mission of persevering and continuing and holding on before God, into a separate <em>mo'ed</em>-idea, and with it brings to a close, not only the cycle of Festivals of the seventh month, but the whole cycle of the festivals of the whole year, <em>Shemini Atzeret</em> would that come to tell us, once again to summarise and gather to ourselves all the thoughts and messages and resolutions which the <em>mo'adim</em> of the whole year have brought to us, and to resolve to persevere and hold fast to them before God. To impress them so deeply in our hearts that they become an unassailable part of ourselves which can not become lost in the course of the ordinary run of our yearly life on which we are now entering. That, in all the vicissitudes which may be awaiting us, richly endowed by the <em>mo'adim</em>, we may \"persevere and remain\" with God. ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the original for the parts I elided, which include discussion of some sources in Talmud and Midrash that lend some support and some challenge to this interpretation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>We can discover what we are celebrating by examining the two main actions of that day: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>changing the second Amidah blessing to \"Who causes the wind to blow and the rain to fall\"</li>\n<li>changing the number of sacrifices for the gentile nations to only one sacrifice (when sacrifices were offered in the Temple).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I see those mitzvot directly answer what we celebrate:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Celebrating God's goodness for providing the rainy season in Israel (representing the Jewish people's nourishment, physical and spiritual) </li>\n<li>Celebrating the intimate relationship between God and the Jewish nation</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The customs of the Sephardic Tikkun HaGeshem and Ashkenazic Tefillat HaGeshem underscore the first point. I see the establishment of Simchat Torah as related to the second point, in which the Jewish people celebrate God's gift of goodness that emphasizes this intimate relationship - that is, the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>To hear from someone significant, I'd refer to Rav Adin Steinsaltz, who reflects about Shemini Atzeret this way in his book <em>A Guide to Jewish Prayer</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our sages see this festival as a private celebration between God and Israel. On the festival of Sukkot, we pray on behalf of the entire world, whereas Shemini Atzeret is like a \"small banquet made by the King for His beloved\" (Rashi on Numbers 28:35). This festival also marks the beginning of the winter season, for on it we begin to pray for the rains of the upcoming year. </p>\n  \n  <p>Perhaps because of this special significance, it was decided to connect this festival with the ceremony for completing the yearly cycle of Torah readings and with the festivities for Simhat Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But s\"k 6 reads קטן מותר לגלח במועד אפילו נולד קודם הרגל which would mean that a koton may <strong>shave</strong> on chol hamoed <em>even if he had been born before the holiday began</em> (because,  as the taz explains, he was alive before hand but wasn't bar mitzvah so he had no obligation to shave before hand the way an adult would be obligated to shave beforehand). The \"אפילו\" as an extension makes it seem that this would clearly apply to a child born ON chol hamoed, meaning a newborn.</p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham quotes the nodah Byehudah as saying that this applies when the koton has שער רב ומצטער, a lot of <em>hair</em> and it bothers him.</p>\n\n<p>Is the text introducing a new case of a pre bar mitzvah boy (or even a baby) who has <strong>so</strong> much hair on his face that he has to shave or is the text following s\"k 5 which discusses hair cutting with s\"k 6 and using g-l-ch in a loose sense to ALSO mean hair cutting and not shaving (because it would seem unlikely that the text would be discussing a case of a baby with so much שער and not זָקַן, beard). The various other logical clues indicate that this is talking about a minor with an unruly and long beard which would only point to a strange order of se'ifim, but the commonsense of it would seem to be against a claim of a ZZ Top-esque newborn.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Y.

He first quotes the <em>Panim M'iros</em> (2:27), <em>Chasam Sofer</em> (OC 127), and the <em>Minchas Chinuch</em> (313), who hold that <em>hana'as mei'av</em> is a necessary criterion for <em>birkas hamazon</em>. Therefore, these opinions hold, if someone ate half of a <em>k'zayis</em>, then vomited it up, then ate another half <em>k'zayis</em>, he would be exempt from <em>birkas hamazon</em> (see also <em>Chullin</em> 103b). The <em>Har Tz'vi</em> infers from these opinions that if someone ate a <em>k'zayis</em> at one time, there might be grounds to say that <em>birkas hamazon</em> is required. </p>\n\n<p>However, he then quotes the Gra (<em>Kol Eliyahu</em>, § 9), who writes that if someone vomited out all of what he ate, he is exempt from <em>birkas hamazon</em> because this is similar to a case of delaying <em>bentching</em> until after the food is digested (whereupon one can no longer <em>bentch</em>). </p>\n\n<p>The responsum concludes by referencing the <em>Imrei Binah</em> (OC, § 14), who writes that even if a person kept a little bit of the <em>k'zayis</em> down, he should not <em>bentch</em> because <em>kdei sviah</em> does not remain in his digestive tract. </p>\n\n<p>See also <em>Torah Lishmah</em> (§ 125), who writes that someone who vomits, if he won't be able to eat more and keep it down, should bentch without <em>shem u'malchus</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

The Halacha is that the third person is obligated to interrupt his eating in order to participate in the zimun, and then afterwards continues eating. In the event that the third refuses to stop his eating and does not answer, Shulchan Aruch rules that although he does not fulfill his own obligation of the zimun, the other two do. From here we see that the zimun is not dependant on all parties answering; as long as there are three people present who hear the zimun, those who do answer fulfill the obligation.</p>\n\n<p>[The Rishonim write that as long as he is present, hears the zimun and \"is able to answer\", the other two fulfill their obligation.

Since most people will only drink a sip of the Kiddush wine, the Sukka blessing is actually on the rest of the meal.

The minhag is as brought down in Shulchan Aruch Siman 643 to make the bracha leishiv by kiddush. Leaving the sukkah to go wash ones hands is all l'tzrich the seudah and v'dei the leishev is going on the mitzvas that one will be doing now in the sukkah (eating, sleeping, learning, \"tiul\", etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Many do have the ability to wash in the sukkah itself or perhaps right near by making this less of a problem. However someone who lives on the 4th floor an an apartment building and builds their sukkah on the street can run into this problem.</p>\n\n<p>However that which people adopt the minhag that the Rema brings down makes a lot of sense. It takes care of the problem as well of being a hefsek between washing and hamotzei which is also a problem (perhaps even more so then being mafsik between the leishev and the start of the seudah.) It's also more convinient as to not bother the family and guests to go back into the house to wash for the seudah especially in a situation where the sukkah is far from the house. Being somach on the Rema (even if others argue) in such a situation I believe is perfectly ok. I heard b'shem Rav Padva (from England) that one can always be somach on what is brought down in Shulchan Aruch when it's needed.</p>\n\n\n",

On the second night, however, Shehechiyanu is said before Leishev Basukkah.</p>\n\n<p>According to other minhagim: Leishev Basukkah is always said first.</p>\n\n<p>So what's up with that? Why <em>should</em> one be said before the other? Which should normally be said first? And why the switch for me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The proper order of these blessings is a machloket between Rav and Rabba bar bar Chana on Sukkah 56a. Rav held the blessing on the Sukkah comes first because it's the obligation of the day and Rabba bar bar Chana held that Shehechiyanu comes first because it is Tadir = said more often. The Rambam (Sukkah 6:2) rules like Rav and Shulchan Aruch does likewise in OC 643:1.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur (OC 661) quotes two opinions regarding the second day. The Rosh holds that the order should be flipped and the Avi Ezri holds that the order should remain the same. At first glance the Avi Ezri makes the most sense: when else do we distinguish between the different days of Yom Tov? We say a Shehechiyanu on the day in case it is really the first day, shouldn't we say a Shehechiyanu on the Sukkah in case it is really our first time performing the mitzva?</p>\n\n<p>The answer lies in the nature of the Shehechiyanu on the Sukkah. It is not being said on the new mitzva performance, but rather is said upon building the sukkah and can even be said many days before the holiday starts (OC 641, note also our custom to use the Shehechiyanu on the holiday to fulfill this obligation). Thus even if the second day really is the right day, we have already fulfilled the obligation of Shehechiyanu on the Sukkah the previous night. (This is also why we don't say a Shehechiyanu on the Lulav on the second day of Sukkot, but we do on the Shofar on the second day of Rosh HaShana.)</p>\n\n<p>(I'll note that neither Rav nor Rabba bar bar Chana seemed to care that the Shehechiyanu be after the Sukkah in order to have the Shehechiyanu apply to the Sukkah as well, ie Shehechiyanu should apply to everything by default anyway. Tzarich iyun on the Rosh IMO.)</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch and Rama rule like the Rosh, while Bach, Maharshal and Gra rule like the Avi Ezri (see more names on both sides in Shaar HaTziyun OC 661 sk 3) and hence the differences in custom.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First night: say a leisheiv. Then say a shehechiyanu, as that is covering both the yomtov (shehechiyanu is part of the standard kiddush of the first 2 days of pesach and shavuos too), <em>and</em> the new experience of the mitzva of dwelling in the sukkah (just as you'd make a shehechiyanu the first time you take a lulav, but not subsequent times).</p>\n\n<p>Second night: well as a rule of thumb on yomtov, the Sages enacted a shehechiyanu for the second-night-yomtov kiddush, to generate more respect for the second (rabbinically-enacted) day. However, it's not your first time saying a <em>leisheiv</em>. Therefore:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Custom A</strong>: Make regular kiddush, including the standard second-day <em>shehechiyanu.</em> THEN, make a <em>leisheiv</em>, which will be immediately followed by your sitting down and drinking in the sukkah (so your \"dwelling in the sukkah\" came immediately after the blessing to do so).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Custom B</strong>: We don't want people to treat the second day as any less special than the first day. The rest of the prayers are the same for both days. Therefore, say the exact same kiddush as day #1, i.e. concluding with <em>shehechiyanu</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I can answer your family Minhag based on the following logic:</p>\n\n<p>The Shehehiyanu is on the Mitzvah.  In the case of the first night, two Mitzvoth are being performed for the first time.  In the second, the Mitzvah of \"dwelling\" in the Sukkah has already been performed.  However, the Yom Tov and Kiddush obligate a Shehehiyanu.</p>\n\n<p>Why you would say Shehehiyanu on Kiddush of a second night of Yom Tov is an interesting question all year round.</p>\n\n<p>I remember hearing what I thought then was an interesting approach, which explained why others don't follow this pattern, but I don't remember what that was, unfortunately, and I was thinking about it this year wondering if I should follow that or what my Mahzor said (it was the first year it was applicable to me making Kiddush on the first night of Sukkoth).  I should have looked this up before Yom Tov.  :(</p>\n\n\n",

The ones that you use your voice for are called <em>voiced</em> and the others are called <em>unvoiced</em>. The sounds \"s\" and \"z\" have identical mouth positions (the lips part and the corners pull back while the teeth themselves lightly touch). The difference is whether or not you use your voice when you say them. When a voiced sound comes before an \"s\", it often makes it sound like a \"z\". [For example: backs and bags. The \"s\" sounds like an \"s\" in backs because there is a \"k\" in front of it, which is voiceless. In bags, it sounds like a \"z\" because there is a \"g\" in front of it, which is voiced.] Since the <em>unvoiced</em> \"s\" in beis comes after the <em>voiced</em> \"b\" it can make it sound more like a \"z\".</p>\n\n\n",

Obviously this is beyond our comprehension how it is possible to fit another note in an already covered octave but that part I do not seek to understand. What I am trying to understand is why Chazal said there were 7 notes in an octave at the moment to which another note will be added! </p>\n\n<p>Introduction:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An octave is just a range of pitches from point A to point B where A and B are the same note but on different pitches!</li>\n<li>An unlimited amount of notes can be played in an octave, each slightly different from each other only detectable my machine. </li>\n<li>Non-Western music has quarter notes in its music, and people with \"perfect pitch\" can listen to even more precise fractions of notes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Western music has for Mathematical and \"sounding right\" reasons decided on 12 half notes in an octave! To people with perfect pitch the notes are not spot on but since for most people 12 equal half notes are good enough, that is the way it is!</p>\n\n<p>A look at the piano shows 7 white keys and 5 black. See <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/q/11669\">this question here</a> about why they are split like that but after perusing the answers a few times the number seven doesnt seem all that significant. The seven white keys of the piano correspond to the major scale, starting from the C note. They are not equa-distant however, with some having a full note in between and some having a half note.</p>\n\n<p>So why did Chazal say there are seven notes? Are they only counting the 7 white notes because they are the keys of the major scale of C? This style was only created later in history created by the Greeks, what did Chazal think before the Greeks came around! To quote one of the answers to the music question I linked to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So, the western scale is based upon frequency relationships that make combinations of notes \"ring\" in consonance in it's purest form... like the Gregorian Chants of the Roman Church.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, a basic \"western keyboard\" could be made from just these 7 notes repeated across the frequency spectrum. Look at the layout of a Greek Lyre (a harp) and that's what you will find. A sequence following the diatonic scale which sounds pleasant if you just strum across the strings due to the tuning of even multiples (adjusted by octaves).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>By the way in the response to @Michoel's comment the fact that a Greek Lyre (a harp) has the main seven notes and Chazal said that we will soon have eight and the harp was the instrument of David, it appears that Chazal meant there will be an additional note, not just another repeat string!</em></p>\n\n<p>To quote a second answer: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note also that many cultures use a pentatonic scale. This would correspond to playing only the notes CDEGA.

In this world, all the קדושות occur in groups of seven, seven days of the week, shvi'is, yovel the sefiros. (Perhaps these are the 7 שיר של יום  that were said in the Beis HaMikdash). During Yemos Moshiach, an additional שירה will be said, according to the concept of \"there is no difference between Olam HaZeh to Yemos Moshiach, except for subjugation of the kingdom\". Since we will have that additional quality of no longer being under the subjugation of foreign governments, we add an additional שירה. The 10 strings represent Olam HaBah when we will be exalted above all 10 קדושות in the world (here he gives examples of the 10 קדושות).</p>\n\n<p>The Ben Ish Chai takes a slightly different approach that might indicate that the strings refer to actual notes. In בניהו בן יהוידע he explains that the first 7 represent the שפע from the lower seven ספירות. The 8th string of Yemos Moshiach represent the additional שפע of the 8th ספירה from top to bottom, בינה. The 10 strings represent the שפע of the top most ספירה of כתר.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps according to the Ben Ish Chai's interpretation, with the additional שפע will come additional notes.</p>\n\n\n",

As a service to him, and to make his first Siyum special, the half-'Amud was learned again, followed by another Hadran and Kaddish.

    "content": "# Are there forms of Jewish mysticism outside of kabbalah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is kabbalah the one and only form (source?) of Jewish mysticism? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>'Kabbalah' means \"received\", i.e. received knowledge. It is an oral tradtion, but has been recorded in several books. Many consider it the 3rd pillar of Jewish knowledge (with the Written and Oral Torah being the other two). So you can't really have another form of it - that would be a contradiction of definition.</p>\n\n<p>The Zohar (meaning brilliant/radiant) is the most famous book, and is what most people mean when they say Kabbalah. So perhaps that is what you are asking. And if you are, the answer is yes, there are other books too: Sefer Yetzirah is the most famous (and oldest) of them. The Etz Chayim from the Ari is another.</p>\n\n<p>Chassidut is inwardly based upon the ancient doctrinal tradition of Kabbalah. Outwardly it gives new emphasis to the simple and joyful service of God, particularly through prayer and acts of loving-kindness. In Chassidic thought, the abstract and often impenetrable formulae of classical Kabbalah are recast into the psychological terms of human experience. (<a href=\"http://www.inner.org/chassidut/chassidut.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">from inner.org by Rabbi Yitzchok Ginsburgh</a>) </p>\n\n<p>Wikipedia has a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah%3a_Primary_texts#Primary_texts\" rel=\"nofollow\">list</a> of some others that I have not heard of till now.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>From the first 60 seconds of <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/712417/Rabbi_Alan_Brill/Introduction_to_the_Kabbalah_02\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a>by Rabbi Alan Brill it is clear that there are other types of Jewish mysticism outside of Kabbalah. The wikipedia list cited in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20575/1561\">another answer</a> does not clearly make this distinction. Texts such as the the Sefer Yetzeirah or the Heichalot literature differ radically in their form of mystical expression and understanding, as does the mysticism of Rabbi Avraham ben HaRambam cited in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20584/1561\">another answer</a>. From the academic perspective the main text of the Kabbalah is the Zohar which is believed to have been written by Rabbi Moshe DeLeon in the 1200's, as such there are several mystical works which predate it. For a good summary and overview see the introduction to \"<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/27387578/Joseph-Dan-The-Early-Kabbalah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Early Kabblah</a>\" by Yosef Dan. Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan presents the orthodox view, which is the information in the Zohar has existed from a much earlier period and was passed down orally until Rabbi DeLeon published it. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever the case may be unless you use kabbalah in a colloquial sense to actually mean mysticism (which I understand from the question is not the case) the works cited above are representative of different schools of orthodox Jewish mysticism that are separate and apart from Kabbalah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There was a a kind of religious path that developed around the 1200s which was close to the Sufi path within Islam. A major book in this stream was written by Avraham the son of the Rambam. It was re-published recently by Feldheim with an English translation as <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/mussar-growth-and-inspiration/torah-classics-library/the-guide-to-serving-g-d.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Guide to Serving God</a>. There are also a couple of Hebrew translations that have been published recently (the original is in Arabic), so maybe the ideas are undergoing a bit of a revival at the moment.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam in codifiying this law (<a href=\"http://beta.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188355/jewish/Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Melachim uMilchamot 10:9</a>) explains that the issue is in gentiles innovating their own laws:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Similarly, a gentile who rests, even on a weekday, observing that day\n  as a Sabbath, is obligated to die. Needless to say, he is obligated\n  for that punishment if he creates a festival for himself. The general principle governing these matters is: They are not to be allowed to originate a new religion or create mitzvot for themselves based on their own decisions. They may either become righteous converts and accept all the mitzvot or retain their statutes without adding or detracting from them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>2. The Maharsha (Sanhedrin 58b) compares Shabbos to the bride of the Jewish people, and compares gentiles observing it to adultery:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Maharsha explains that the Sabbath is, metaphorically, a bride.\n  Indeed, the Talmud refers to the Sabbath as a bride and the Shabbos is\n  greeted in the same way that a bride is greeted. This imagery was\n  immortalized by Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz (a 16th century poet and\n  Kabbalist from Tzfas) in his classical liturgical song, Lecha Dodi,\n  which is sung just before the reception of the Holy Shabbos. Rabbi\n  Avraham Sperling writes, based on this allegorical comparison, that\n  “Shabbos” is the female companion to the Israelite nation. The Jewish\n  Nation is “married” to Shabbos. Therefore, when a non-Jew follows the\n  rules of Shabbos, it is as if he is committing “adultery” with the\n  married bride “Shabbos”, and so he is liable for the death penalty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3. He suggest (based on Rashi's explanation) that the resting of Shabbos is an exclusive gift to the Jews:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Adam sinned by\n  eating the Forbidden Fruit, he was punished by all future males having\n  to work, “with the sweat of his brow.” This implies that HaShem\n  expects man to work continuously without rest. However, two thousand\n  four hundred and forty-eight years later, HaShem granted the Jews a\n  special present, namely, the Holy Sabbath, with which they can\n  rest, in contrast to the remainder of society. Therefore, world\n  society is not allowed to rest because of the curse of Adam, while the\n  Jews are allowed to rest because the Torah specifically calls for a\n  Mitzvah of Shabbos, which was a unique gift granted to the Jewish\n  Nation . .  Rabbi Meir ben Todros HaLevi Abulafia (1170-1244) explains that the gift of Shabbos was given specifically to the Jews, and therefore if a Noahide keeps Shabbos, he is actually stealing from the Jews and is therefore liable for the prohibition of stealing (which is one of the Seven Noachide Laws).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Talmud, <a href=\"http://www.e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=3726&size=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 58B</a>, learns it out from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0108.htm#22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 8:22</a> (I went into more detail <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16325/603\">here</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>כב</strong>  עֹד, כָּל-יְמֵי הָאָרֶץ:  זֶרַע וְקָצִיר וְקֹר וָחֹם וְקַיִץ וָחֹרֶף, וְיוֹם וָלַיְלָה--לֹא יִשְׁבֹּתוּ.‏</p>\n<p><strong>22</strong> While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"And day and night shall not cease\" is interpreted as an injunction to Bnei Noach not to cease from working for a day.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Although I haven't had time to look at the sources mentioned, there appears to be an opinion by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi</a> (<a href=\"http://www.thesanhedrin.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=2468&sid=a68bca87e680aded330604069318289d#2468\" rel=\"nofollow\">cited here</a>) that people dwelling the land of Israel who are obligated to keep the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Noahide_Laws\" rel=\"nofollow\">7 Noahide Laws</a>, must also keep the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sabbath</a>, and apparently <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Kanievsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky</a> (cited in that forum thread) wrote that gentiles in the diaspora today have the same status as gentiles living in the Land of Israel in ancient times, including keeping the Sabbath (referring back to the aforementioned opinion of Rashi).</p>\n\n<p>I have <strong>NOT</strong> heard of either of these opinions quite as stated above.  I'd have to look at the sources mentioned, and I don't have time right now.  There is, however, a verse about the Sabbath that includes the language \"and the stranger within your gates\" (Zachor).  It does sound from here that non-Jews in Israel may not perform any work on the Sabbath (and I've heard this as a potential problem in modern-day Israel).</p>\n\n<p>But, in a nutshell, it is widely held, at least outside of Israel, that non-Jews are specifically <em>not</em> allowed to keep the Sabbath because the Sabbath is called an eternal \"sign\" (some render this as \"covenant\") between G-d and Israel.

That said, there's a lot more to this than just \"no\", and there have been many religious Jews throughout history who have believed that God does (or at least can) possess corporeal form.</p>\n\n<p>In his commentary on Tractate Sanhedrin in the Mishna, the Rambam (12th century) delineated thirteen principles that, at the time, he held to be crucial to Judaism. His third principle states that God does not possess a physical form. People tend to cite that principle today in asserting God's incorporeality.</p>\n\n<p>Prof. Marc Shapiro wrote a book entitled <em>The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised</em> (Oxford, 2005), and in chapter 3 (45-70) he goes into some detail, listing the various rabbinic authorities throughout the ages who have either supported the view that God possesses physical form or who have disputed with the Rambam over his making it necessary to believe that God does not.</p>\n\n<p>For an interesting example of an ancient text that discusses God's dimensions, and that the Rambam was influential in having destroyed, see Gershom Scholem's <em>On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead</em> (New York: Schocken Books, 1991) - in particular, pp15-37.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20594\">The earlier answer by Shimon bM</a> addresses God's corporeality; I'll take another tack and address your reading of <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%92_%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 3:8</a>. You say it implies God's corporeality by saying He was walking through the garden; in fact, though, the plain reading IMO is that God's sound, not Himself, was walking (i.e., traveling, moving) through the garden, and this is the reading clearly favored by various commentators quoted by Nachmanides in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%92_%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his commentary</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Mosheh Aberbauch taught me that many people believed G-d has a body, including Jews in error.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam composed his text, \"Dalilath Alha'irin\" Guide for the Perplexed to explain \"the arm of God, hand of God, vayichar af HaShem (lashon kinuyim) figure of speech.  Thus he defended the fundamental beliefs 13 Iqarim.

There, Rabbi Yehuda is quoted as noting that people used to give their children dead non-kosher grasshoppers to play with.</p>\n\n<p>Just to be clear, I'm not looking to understand Rabbi Yehuda, whose opinion is not problematic for me. I want to know how religious Jews (might) have dealt with this passage, if it is true that they frown upon coming into contact with impure animals.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe strongly suggested (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15848&st=&pgnum=220\">Sha'rey Halacha Uminhag Chelek Gimmel pg. 233</a>, English translation <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/essays/15.htm\">here</a>) that children not be surrounded by even pictures or toys of impure animals. He explains the tremendous impact visual stimuli has on a person's mind both for good and bad, and how children are particularly susceptible since the impressions formed in a child's tender mind will have potent affects when he is older. He brings a Halachic source for this (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9146&st=&pgnum=336\">Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 198:48</a>) that, \"Upon leaving immersion in a mikveh women should be careful ... that the first thing they encounter should not be an impure thing [such as a dog or donkey] ... If she encountered such things, a G-d-fearing women will return and reimmerse herself\". This is because looking at impure animals can have a harmful effect on an embryo and conversely viewing something sacred after immersion has a beneficial effect on the embryo.</p>\n\n<p>[It should be noted there are numerous exceptions to this, several being noted in footnotes to the Sicha above; for example visiting a zoo is permitted as this affords the child the opportunity to ponder the greatness of Hashem.]</p>\n\n<p>With regards to your question from the Mishna in Shabbos: Not showing children impure animals is not a Halachic issue but rather a matter of hashkafa. R' Yehuda is not  advocating the practice of children playing with non-Kosher grasshoppers; he is noting the Halachic implication of what common practise was to do so.</p>\n\n\n",

He (Nitey Gavriel) suggests that doing so is considered shameful to the custom of the Nevi'im of hitting the Arovos, and that since there are allusions to judgment and severity it is not considered appropriate to re-use them. However, he writes that in terms of the strict letter of the law there is no problem, and one would fulfill the minhag with a previously used arova.</p>\n\n<p>[The proof of the Zakan Aharon is as follows: Firstly he proves that that it is permissible to use the arovah from the arbah minim for hoshana rabbah from the Gemora in Sukka 44. He then asks from the Gemora in Gittin 52 that the manager of the estates of orphans purchases a lulav and arovah for the orphans - as per above it would be sufficient to use the arbah minim for both purposes. He concludes that since the case in question is multiple orphans, although one lulav suffices, he needs multiple arovos for each orphan as we do not reuse them.

    "content": "# Is it true that Jews believed in sheol before the belief in hereafter entered into Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have heard claimed that Jews first believed in Sheol as a place below the ground and was meant to be a place of eternal rest, free of any reward and punishment. However, in later periods and mostly during the exile new beliefs about the afterlife were introduced into Judaism. Thus Jews first believed in no hereafter or after life that could have any meaning of punishment or reward. They simply believed in a place called Sheol, which meant a place located below the ground, and all people whether righteous or unrighteous went there forever, and they believed there was no punishment or reward. During the exile, the belief in an afterlife found its way into Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Is such a claim true and right or valid? If so, would you please introduce some references about that to me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The word Sheol simply means \"pit\". It functions as a euphemism for the grave, though in some biblical texts appears to be a kind of underworld, populated by the wicked and the powerful. References to it in the Torah are sufficiently oblique as to lend themselves to either of those readings.</p>\n\n<p>As to whether or not there is reward and punishment after death, your friend's claim is a valid one but that doesn't mean it is necessarily correct. There are no references to post-mortem judgment in the Torah, to the extent that the rabbis (who later considered it necessary to believe in such a thing) went to very creative lengths to read such references <em>into</em> the text.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of the Torah, but still in Tanach, there are indications either way. Qohelet 3:18-21 appears to explicitly assert that the fate of humans and animals is alike in being nothing, while Psalm 115:17 says that the dead don't praise God. On the other hand, Isaiah 66:24 appears to imply that the wicked will suffer perpetually in death, and Daniel 12:2 explicitly says that people will experience a bodily resurrection, the righteous for eternal glory and the wicked for everlasting shame.</p>\n\n<p>A major point of conflict between the Pharisees and the Sadducees was the latter's belief in there being no reward and punishment after death, while the former stressed it as an integral article of faith. That is mentioned by Josephus (Wars of the Jews, 2.8.14), who says that the Pharisees believe \"that all souls are incorruptible; but that the souls of good men are only removed into other bodies, - but that the souls of bad man are subject to eternal punishment\", and that the Sadducees \"take away the belief of the immortal duration of the soul, and the punishments and rewards in Hades\" (trans. William Whiston).</p>\n\n<p>This conflict, incidentally, is also recorded in the rabbinic literature. The Mishna in Berakhot 9:5, for example, records that people used to conclude their berakhot in the Temple with the insertion of the words, מן העולם - \"from the world\". When the number of sectarians increased, who claimed that there was no world other than this one, the sages altered the blessing to מן העולם ועד העולם - \"from this world to that world\", loosely translated.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most famous example of a passage that the rabbis recontextualised to refer to the world to come is Isaiah 60:21. There it is declared that \"your people is entirely righteous; they will forever inherit the land\" (עמך כלם צדיקים לעולם יירשו ארץ). Isaiah is of course speaking of the land of Israel, the eternal inheritance of which is the focus of the book's final twenty-seven chapters. Since it doesn't take long for people to feel that their restoration in the land of Israel was an incomplete one (being first subject to the authority of an empire, and subsequently possessing a monarchy, but one comprised of priests), the passage was reinterpreted.</p>\n\n<p>The most well-known instance of its reinterpretation is in the New Testament: Matthew 5:3-5. In verse 3, Jesus blesses \"the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\". In verse 5, Jesus blesses \"the meek, for they will inherit the earth\". Samuel Tobias Lachs, in his <em>A Rabbinic Commentary on the New Testament</em> (New Jersey: Ktav, 1987), suggests that these two verses are both the same, and that the variation between them originated from a marginal gloss. \"Poor in spirit\" = עני, while \"meek\" = ענו. What is more, inheriting the earth <em>is</em> inheriting the kingdom of heaven, based on an exegesis of Isaiah 60.</p>\n\n<p>For a Jewish parallel, and one more pertinent to your question, there is the famous mishna in Sanhedrin 10:1. There it says that all Jews receive an inheritance in the world to come (כל ישראל יש להם חלק לעולם הבא), and the proof-text is Isaiah 60:21. What is more, of the people who void their inheritance, one such category is those who deny the resurrection of the dead, which was an integral component of the rabbinic belief in reward and punishment. Another such category is arguably those who deny reward and punishment altogether, in the manner of Epicurus (<em>apikorus</em> in Hebrew), who asserted that the gods have no interest in the activities of men.</p>\n\n<p>One way or another, while your friend may be correct about beliefs held by certain Israelites (and is certainly correct that there have <em>always</em> been Jews who denied reward and punishment, the world to come and resurrection), neither attitude can be substantiated by anything explicit within the Torah, and both require some degree of interpretation. As such, you can feel to translate Sheol as either \"grave\" or \"underworld\", depending on personal preference and immediate context.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Unplugging a Phone Charger on Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a phone charger (or any electric adapter that is not connected to a device, for that matter) is plugged into an outlet, does unplugging it constitute any forbidden form of work, or is simply a 'muktzeh' issue? If it is a muktzeh issue, can it be unplugged and moved if the space is currently needed? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>If the charger has an indicator light it would obviously be forbidden as unplugging would extinguish it. Even if not, phone chargers <a href=\"https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/7288\">utilize electricity</a> even when the phone is not plugged in.

But what is the symbolism of the tree of life?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Rebbe Rashab explains in his Kuntres Eitz Chaim (<a href=\"http://beta.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144822/jewish/Chapter-X.htm\">Chapter 10</a>): Kabbalistically the Tree of Knowledge refers to the Divine attribute of <em>Malchus</em>, and the Tree of Life refers to the attributes of <em>Ze'r Anpin</em>. Malchus is the source of the false feeling the world has that it is an entity which enjoys seemingly self-sufficient existence, as if independent of its Creator. Thus it is essential that is be a unity between the <em>Malchus</em> and <em>Zeir Anpin</em> which does not allow any nurture to the external forces. Adam’s sin was that he attached himself to the level of <em>Malchus</em> (The Tree of Knowlege) alone, and rejected the level of <em>Ze'r Anpin</em> (The Tree of Life). For when Malchus is taken alone, it is natural for the external forces to prevail. Therefore, the influence of the Tree of Life is also necessary. As the Mikdash Melech states in the name of Rabbi Chayim Vital, Adam should have first eaten from the Tree of Life, or he should have eaten from both Trees together, so that there would be a congruence of the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. When this is accomplished, even the Tree of Knowledge will not provide a source of nurture for the external forces. On the contrary, it will refine them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R’ Pinkas answers that death can come either through a killing agent, or because of not having a reason to keep on living.  The Eitz Hachayim not only stopped death, it also gave a reason to live.  He brings the story of the Chasam Sofer, who was sick after Sukkos and died at the end of Tishrei, who said that he had made it through the Yomim Nora’im well, but he didn’t do well on Hoshanna Rabba. If the psak is already done, but the ‘piskim’ are brought in on Hoshanna Rabba, why would he have died?  The answer is, that even though there was no psak against him, he still needed the ‘piska’ of life to be delivered.  He also uses this to explain “sifrei chayim vesifrei meisim psuchim lefonov”.  This means that a person not only has to be mispallel to avoid being written in the sefer of misah, but also needs to be mispallel to be put into the sefer of chayim.  </p>\n\n\n",

A person may eat on the night before a ta’anis prior to alos hashachar, as long as he follows the above-mentioned halacha of not starting a meal within a half-hour of alos.

It might also be quite expensive by now, but the newer projects might be in your ballpark. It is very diverse and has TONS of English-speaking people. There is also an English-speaking community in Moshav Matityahu. </p>\n\n<p>There are also more \"Modern Orthodox\" English-speaking communities in Efrat, Maale Adumim, and to a lesser extent Mitzpeh Yericho. If I am not mistaken, there is also newer areas of Safed being built and many English-speaking people are moving there. </p>\n\n<p>Maale Amos and Meitzad are smaller settlements which are also largely English-speaking and are \"open minded\" Chareidi types. </p>\n\n<p>I recently moved to Beitar Illit because living in Ramat Eshkol (a neighborhood in Jerusalem) was too expensive. Beitar is more \"chilled out\" than Kiryat Sefer but it is still heavily Hareidi and probably is mostly a kollel-type community even though there are a lot of people there who do work. Also, Beitar Illit is a largely Hassidic town. There are a significant number of Americans in both sections of Beitar Illit (A and B), there are no official English-speaking Shuls there, but there is at least one Shul in B which has a large percentage of English-speakers as well as other shuls there with a smaller percentage of English speakers. I'm not sure what the situation in A is but I do understand that there are more English speaking people in A than B. There is an English-speaking Kollel community starting in Karmiel, but again I don't that's what you are looking for.</p>\n\n<p>This is all in addition to the options mentioned above by the other posters.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You also have strong English speaking communities in Raanana and Netanya if you want the central area rather than the Jerusalem area</p>\n\n\n",

How do we view this from a torah pespective?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Prof. Nathan Aviezer wrote a book \"בראשית ברא\" answering questions about the creation in torah view.</p>\n\n<p>There he claims the 6 days of creation to be 6 periods of time that didn't necessarily last 24 hours. Moreover - maybe it was one cycle of dark&light, but things happened at a quicker pace.</p>\n\n<p>Take, for example, a person's growth. If you were to calculate the rate of growth during his first two years, you would conclude that at the age of 20 he'd be as tall as a skyscraper. Similarly, scientists calculate age of things according to he worlds' pace today, but things may have worked differently in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, dinosaurs might have lived and died prior to <em>Adam Harishon</em>. Maybe created on \"day\" 5 and extinct before 6.</p>\n\n<p>(Somewhat related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10079/what-is-the-meaning-of-yowm-in-bereshit?rq=1\">What is the meaning of יוֹם (yowm) in Bereshit?</a>)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The <em>Malbim</em> (on Noach <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40102&st=&pgnum=97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7:23</a>) addresses \"large animals\" that couldn't be \"wiped out\" by the flood, but were buried in depths of the earth following quakes the <em>Mabul</em> created. He is clearly addressing dinosaurs since he's talking about (my free translation): \"... geologists who dig and find large animals who have become extinct, they use this to show earth existed long before <em>Bereshis</em> creation...\"</p>\n\n<p>Some attribute \"התנינים הגדולים\" (Bereshis 1:21) to the dinosaurs as a reference of their existing (not mentioned in <em>Malbim</em>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another opinion I've heard from reliable people (suggested by the Lubavitcher Rebbe in <a href=\"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=FmabnhsgSVAC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> letter) is that the world was created \"old\", such as <em>Adam Harishon</em> was created as a man of 20 and not a newborn baby. Hence, dinosaurs could have either existed - or their remains and footprints were melded into the creation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb addresses this issue in <a href=\"https://www.dovidgottlieb.com/Rabbi_Gottlieb_Tapes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">many shiurim</a> (check out <a href=\"https://audio.simpletoremember.com/gottlieb/Evolution-age-of-the-Universe.mp3?download\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Evolution & the Age of the Universe</a> for example).</p>\n<h4>Background of approach</h4>\n<p>His general approach follows the <strong>general chareidi approach</strong> (he is a Bostoner Chassid teaching in Ohr Samayach, indeed due to his background many Rabbonim will refer you to his lectures if you ask this question), and has done a lot of research into the scientific reconciliations such as Dr. Schroeder's relativity solution, and uses his background as a professor of mathematical logic with special interest in philosophy of science to deal with this in a manner that doesn't compromise Torah positions at all but is still palatable to someone who wants rational, logical solutions.</p>\n<h4>Summary of approach</h4>\n<p>To summarise what he says, the consensus among the <em>gadolei adar</em> is that the 6 days of creation are 24 hours (our hours) each. I've personally asked him if he holds that we <em>pasken</em> <em>hashkafa</em> and he said yes, referencing several sources in Rambam. There is room for interesting resolutions, that the history of the universe did play out, but faster, for example, but the 24 hours is important.</p>\n<p>So we have to now deal with fossils, and the general solution offered is the same as Lubavitcher Rebbe (see Yaacov Deane's comment below for more on this citation); the universe was created <em>aged</em> rather than <em>embryonic</em>, in the same way that Adam was created aged, as that of a man of 20 (Bereshit Rabba). Indeed, it would take 13.8 billion years to make a universe like ours from an embryonic state, and dinosaurs would be an important step in the evolution of the body of man, but Hashem skipped all that (in some sense) and created year zero 5783.5 years ago, with a universe \"aged\" 13.8 billion years.</p>\n<h4>Dealing with a common issue with this approach</h4>\n<p>One might ask, isn't this deceptive? He makes it one way, but makes it appear another, and (as some people claim) He did so to give us free will - this makes people uncomfortable. Rabbi Gottlieb gives the philosophical answer: Hashem isn't deceiving us because <strong>He told us in the Torah how old the universe is</strong>. The reason the world <em>looks</em> older is irrelevant, whether it is purely for free will, or simply because Hashem loves nature (Derashot HaRan 8:63a), or any other reason.</p>\n<h4>Concluding remarks</h4>\n<p>So, the rational thinking Torah Jew doesn't have to have a position on dinosaurs. He doesn't have to say \"they didn't exist and anyone who says so is an apikorus\" (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135435/31534\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135433/31534\">this</a> answer), but he also shouldn't feel boxed in to insist that they did exist otherwise he's an anti-science irrational religious zealot, even though you'll certainly find authorities holding by both sides (as always CYLOR). He can simply say it certainly looks like they existed, and the science done on their bones paints a very cool story of what they were like and one can be impressed about that in the same way all of nature impresses one to the awesome ways of Hashem*. If he wants to follow a strong opinion in the traditional Torah world that the days were 24 hours, then he has philosophical feet to stand on.</p>\n<p>Remember, rational thinking knows limits. Science is not history and historical theories are never theorems. Torah tells us absolute truths but it also leaves out a lot of the history in its pshat. So what actually happened is something we currently don't <strong>know</strong> for sure. Rabbi Gottlieb places a lot of stress on not getting too worked up about this. As a younger man I found that hard to hear; I wanted to know! I still do, but it's clear that there's no point taking a definite position without definite facts, and that Hashem doesn't have to have done it the way <em>I</em> think would be the most sensible or cool. As cool as dinosaurs are**, I'm sure if I ever find out how Hashem did it, I'll agree He did it in the most fantastic way, far beyond anything I could have imagined :)</p>\n<p><sup>*I'll say from experience that there are many traditional households that do not hold like this, and one should be respectful. Scientism has been a damaging enemy to the religious world over the centuries and some people have felt it more than others, and have their own reasons for not wanting to teach their children about dinosaurs.<br />\n**Do note though, the world of the dinosaurs is an especially hard one to reconcile with the idea of goodness. In a world where there were no humans with free will to accomplish a great good that makes creation worth while, for a hundred and fifty million years there was violence and horrific death we can't imagine, an ever ongoing arms race of size and teeth and poison and claws and every nasty horror in nature...</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the sefer <a href=\"http://www.seforimcenter.com/product.asp?cookiecheck=yes&numPageStartPosition=64&P_ID=7913&strPageHistory=cat&strKeywords=&strSearchCriteria=&PT_ID=72\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Q&A Thursday Nights With Rabbi Avigdor Miller\" Volume 2</a>, pg 284, he was asked why were the dinosaurs and the mastodon not saved from the mabul?

The Kehunah — Priesthood — was the domain of the Hasmoneans,\n  and the Malchut — kingship — belonged to the descendants of David.\n  Hillel was upset with the Hasmoneans for acquiring kingship, which was\n  not their domain.</p>\n  \n  <p>Herod denied Chananeil the position of Kohen Gadol and appointed his\n  brother-in-law Aristablus, who was a Hasmonean, instead. Despite his\n  young age of only seventeen, he impressed everyone with his superb\n  performance and became highly acclaimed. This aroused the jealousy of\n  Herod, and he planned a way to be rid of him.</p>\n  \n  <p>Once Herod scheduled a celebration in Yericho, and he invited his\n  wife, mother-in-law, and brother-in-law to participate. Present also\n  were Hillel the Nasi, and Shammai the Chief Justice. After the King\n  and Aristablus played together and perspired, the King invited his\n  brother-in-law for a swim. The waters were deep and very swift, and\n  the King secretly instructed his servants to drown Aristablus. While\n  in the water, they engaged in horse-play, and then they kept him under\n  the water till he expired. They exited the water pretending that they\n  knew nothing about the whereabouts of Aristablus. Suddenly, his skull\n  floated on the waters and everyone realized what happened and blamed\n  the King for it, but were unable to do him anything.</p>\n  \n  <p>Upon seeing the skull, Hillel declared that there is an ultimate\n  accounting for all that one does: \"Because your family, the\n  Hasmoneans, pushed aside the family of David from kingship, they\n  received their punishment in the form of the drowning of their\n  descendant, and ultimately all those who had a hand in your drowning\n  will drown.\" In the end, Herod gave Aristablus a royal funeral in an\n  attempt to remove any suspicion from himself and killed the servants\n  who had a hand in his drowning. (Knesses Yisroel) - <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15498&st=&pgnum=101\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pg. 85</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>5. Why add the word \"v'sof\"?</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hillel is emphasizing that nothing in this world is accidental. There\n  is a reason for everything that occurs. Moreover, when carefully\n  analyzed, one will see that it is midah keneged midah — measure for\n  measure. A difficulty with this theory, to some, is that at times it\n  appears that the no punishment was meted out or that it is not\n  commensurate with the iniquity. In reply, Hillel says that since we\n  Jews believe in gilgulim — reincarnation — it is clear that even when\n  the immediate punishment is not exact, however, \"vesof\" — \"ultimately\"\n  — when one will return to earth through reincarnation, he will receive\n  precisely whatever was due to him in a previous lifetime that he did\n  not receive then.

Recall that Zimmun originally meant that the leader said all the blessings out loud and everyone fulfilled their obligation by listening. Thus if you couldn't hear the leader in a big room then you did not fulfill the biblical obligation of bentching.</p>\n\n<p>(Note also that generally speaking, you cannot break up a minyan for zimmun because then you lose the opportunity to say the zimmun with God's name. You can however break up a larger group into smaller groups so long as you don't switch from a zimmun of 10 to one of 3 or from one of 3 to alone.

One preparing such tea should still use a kli sheni to pour into a kli shlishi (See Igros Moshe OC 4:74 Bishul 16).</p>\n<p>Although tzoveya, dyeing, does not apply to food, it is best to place the tea in the cup before the water so as not to colour the water in the cup (Sha’ar Hatziyon 318:65).</p>\n<p>Those relying on R’ Moshe must leave the teabag in their cup or remove it with a spoon as straining the teabag would be borer (Minchas Yitzchak 4:99:20).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://yalkut.info/%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97-%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A3-%D7%92-%D7%95%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%94-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yalkut Yosef 318:40-44.</a> where Hacham Yishak discusses this. </p>\n\n\n",

But the water didn't save him, the little basket, the Egyptian lady who yanked him out or even the sister who watched him might have saved him, the water didn't do anything. If someone was in a car accident an survived unharmed they would say the seat belt saved them, not the road. How can we make sense of this ma'amar chazal?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There was no benefit from the road because if the road didn't exist then you would have been fine anyway because you wouldn't have been driving. In no way did the road save your life. However had the water not existed in Moshe's time then Yocheved wouldn't have been able to hide him, so the water saved him by giving him a hiding place. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Had Yocheved put Moshe in still water, whether or not the reeds were there, he would have <a href=\"http://www.kon-tiki.no/E-Exp_Tigris.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"see here on the limited buoyancy of reeds\">eventually sunk</a> or been discovered by one of Paroh's men.  Instead, she put Moshe into a running river which took him downstream into Batyah's sight giving him hope (and giving Yocheved plausible deniability so that she could nurse him).  Thus, the running of the water saved him as much if not more than the reeds.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I was thinking about this over Shabbos and came up with a possible answer. I checked on the web afterwards and found this post. None of the answers provide an explanation that adequately compares the role of the earth saving Moshe by swallowing up the Egyptian victims to the role of the water saving Moshe. It would seem that the water too provided an active salvation.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my best guess: They likely put Moshe in the water at the end of town that they lived which was far from the palace and normally the current would have taken the basket to the shore long before reaching the palace region and he would have been found by a random Egyptian who would have likely killed him (figuring he was Jewish child). The water kept the basket in the middle of the body of water far from the shore the whole time so that even bas paroah had to miraculously (or figuratively) stretch out very far to take the basket.</p>\n\n\n",

Based on this he explains the verses in Tehillim (118:2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.אבן מאסו הבונים היתה לראש פנה. מאת יהוה היתה זאת היא נפלאת בעינינו<br>\n   The stone that the builders rejected became a cornerstone. This was from the Lord; it is wondrous in our eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"The builders\" are a reference to the people who built the Tower of Bavel. They rejected what later became the site of the Beis Hamidkosh. This was Divinely orchestrated by Hashem, as is does not make logical sense -  they should have rationally chosen a high place to build the tower, and it was only Hashem's intervention that caused them to do otherwise.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Pasuk mentions that the whole point of the tower was for the Bnei Bavel to make a name for themselves.(11:4) Additionally, when the Torah goes through the genealogy it mentions Nimrod as a Gibor Tzayid(10:9) and Rashi explains that he was good at convincing people to rebel against Hash-m. So Rabbi Storch explained that this means that he convinced the Dor Haflagah to try to rebel against Hash-m to show off humanity's greatness. Therefore, Simcha W. explained based on this idea, that they were being all the more arrogant by building the tower starting in a valley, because they were saying that that humanity was so great that they could build a great tower starting from even a valley.[Similar to how Hash-m sometimes makes Bnei Yisroel fight with like 200 people versus a whole nation in Navi to show that the victory was totally from him and to enhance the miracle]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As I understand the real goal wasn't reach a heaven - no one thought that man can really fight hand-to-hand with G-d. I think, that that generation was like Philistines in the time of King David (they wanted to fight with G-d too). They just want to show that they don't need G-d, that they can made all what they need by thyself. So itwas supposed to be just a high tower as a symbol of the power of the people.</p>\n\n\n",

The Ketzos HaShulchan (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7723&st=&pgnum=37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Badei HaShulchan 107:43</a>) holds that it's forbidden:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Other [i.e. not Torah] newspapers in our generation are pretty much all against G-d and His anointed and are full of dirty jokes, heresy, and atheism, unfortunately, and even on a weekday it is forbidden to read them. Even if someone only wants to read the news part brought in the newspapers, it's still forbidden, lest he continue to read the other bad parts ... [Someone who reads them] transgresses \"Don't turn to the idols\" and strengthens his yetzer hara against himself ... Many people stumble in this area because they don't impart to themselves the enormity of the prohibition; someone who cares about his soul should distance himself from them, because these newspapers have made many dead fall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shmiras Shabbas KeHilchasah (second edition, ch. 21 note 117) quotes this source, and doesn't bring a dissenting view.</p>\n<p>The common practice seems to be to read newspapers. I was wondering if there was a discussion of this in the modern responsa. (It's said that the Netziv would read the newspaper on Shabbas, but his position isn't clear. We don't know his exact reasoning. I'm looking for modern decisors who specifically speak about the issue — and aren't just quoted as having read it or say it as a side point.

Doesn't mean newspapers are good for all of us though - and Yiddish newspapers of the time are not today's newspapers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My shver was uniquely sensitive to society. Despite what they write in\n  all the books about him, my shver never failed to read the Yiddish\n  newspaper – either the Tog in the early years or the Morgn-Zhurnal\n  later on – cover-to-cover every single day. People publish that he\n  would walk down the street and avert his eyes when he passed by\n  newspaper stands. There are a thousand talmidim of his who will\n  testify, “I bought the paper and handed it to him in the lunchroom in\n  the yeshivah,” but it does not make a difference for some people –\n  they do not want to hear that.</p>\n  \n  <p>Even when he was not well and the doctor insisted that he must lie\n  down to sleep for an hour, he would go home, put on a bathrobe, and\n  smuggle a newspaper into the bedroom so that his wife would not see\n  it. He sat there reading the whole time, rather than sleeping.</p>\n  \n  <p>I used to ask him, “Why do you read this chazeray (junk)?” He would\n  respond to me, “Dos iz mayn vinde” – this is my window [to the world].\n  He understood society and his piskei Halachah show that. He used to\n  say, “People think that because I’m aware of society, I became a\n  meikel (lenient decisor). What do they want me to do – paskn\n  incorrectly? I’m not a meikel – I paskn the way it has to be. The\n  Halachah takes into account societal factors.” This willingness to be\n  exposed to society made his teshuvos more meaningful and more\n  acceptable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2014/06/did-rav-moshe-feinstein-read-newspapers.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is a picture of him reading a newspaper</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xensEm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xensEm.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>However I have now seen the following in R Shlomo Aviner's book <a href=\"https://www.ateret.org.il/uploads/files/Rabbenu%201-224.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Ha-Rav Tzvi Yehudah Ha-Cohain Kook</a> (p. 186)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a student asked our Rabbi (R Tzvi Yehudah Ha-Cohain Kook) if he should read the newspaper, our\n  Rabbi responded that he should not.

In some communities, fencing off the world is an ideal, and you would expect to find explicit teshuvot against reading of newspapers. But in other communities, this would not even rise to the level of a question, such that <strong>of course</strong> one may read the news.

We find three basic opinions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Many hold that reading this type of material is included in the Rabbinical edict against reading non-business documents and is forbidden to be read.(13)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Others hold that if one enjoys reading these type of articles then it is permitted to do so. These poskim maintain that the Rabbinical edict against reading non-business documents does not include enjoyable reading material.(14) Mishnah Berurah, however, does not support this position.(15)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some poskim hold that while it may be permitted to read certain parts of the newspaper, reading a newspaper should be strongly discouraged since it is extremely difficult to avoid the advertisements or other parts of the paper which are forbidden to be read.(16) But other poskim, however, permit the reading of a newspaper as long as one makes a conscious effort to avoid the forbidden sections.(17)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following is a free translation of guidelines given by Harav N. Karelitz(18) on this subject: \"While a ben Torah and his family should avoid reading a newspaper on Shabbos altogether, we do not object to those who are lenient and read the permissible parts of the newspaper. This is especially true with regard to women, children and those who do not engage in the study of Torah [who require a kosher alternative so that they will not come to engage in idle or forbidden talk or worse]; we definitely should not object to their reading the permissible parts of the newspaper.\"</p>\n<p>One should consult his halachic authority for guidance as to how he should conduct himself in this matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You could then refer to footnotes 14,17, and 18:</p>\n<p>14 See Magen Avraham 301:4 and Peri Megadim; Ya'avatz 1:162; Kalkeles Shabbos 33; Tehillah l'David 301:1; Da'as Torah 307:15.</p>\n<p>17 See Da'as Torah 307:16, Shemiras Shabbos K'hilchasah 29:46.

On Friday night the world receives spiritual energy from the attribute of <em>malchus</em>. On Shabbos day there is an even higher revelation of the <em>middos</em>, and on Shabbos afternoon a yet high revelation that unites <em>malchus</em> and <em>middos</em>. Thus, on Friday night we say \"בה\" corresponding to the feminine aspect of <em>malchus</em>, on Shabbos day we say \"בו\"  as <em>middos</em> are considered masculine, and finally on Shabbos afternoon we say \"בם\" indicating the unification of <em>malchus</em> and <em>middos</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to Artscroll (quoting Rabbi (Elie?)

    "content": "# Saying \"Shehecheyanu\" on Mitzvot on the second day of Yom Tov\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The two days of Rosh Hashanah are considered as one day (Yoma Arichta), so why do we say Shehecheyanu when we blow the Shofar on the second day? Moreover even if we somehow view it as two days, why say a Shehecheyanu again on the Shofar when we don't say one <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10701/shehechiyanu-on-lulav?lq=1\">on Lulav</a> or <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20538/759\">on sitting in the Sukkah</a> on the second day of Sukkos which is certainly viewed as two days (S'feika d'Yoma)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch Harav (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh4/2/600/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 600:5-7</a>) explains that although some hold that the two days of Rosh Hashana are considered one day with regards to the brocha shechiyanu, the Halacha is not like them and therefore we make a second shechiyanu the second day by Kiddush and Shofar blowing. [However, we do try and take the opinion into concern and therefore have a new fruit/clothes but this is only l'chumra and l'chatchila].</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the difference between Shofar and Lulav - the earliest source I could find that deals with this is the Tashbatz (a student of the Maharam of Rottenburg) <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4087&st=&pgnum=24&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ois 151</a> who brings an answer in the name of R' Nissim Gaon. [I'm don't understand the answer (yet), so I won't explain it here].</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14585&st=&pgnum=249\" rel=\"nofollow\">Levush OC 662:2</a> (and similarly in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40432&st=&pgnum=357\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magen Avraham S\"K 1</a> there) also addresses the question and explains that in the case of Lulav it is enough to make the brocha once - if that day was Yom Tov he certainly fulfilled the obligation, if it was a weekday it's no worse than if he made the brocha when he made the Lulav which would work. However, by Shofar one cannot make a brocha at the time of making the Shofar; the brocha only works when it's blown. [Since a) most people don't make their shofar personally b) a new shofar is not made every year].  We therefore make the brocha again the second day incase the first day was not Yom Tov. (This same line of reasoning would also explain why we do not make shechiyanu on Sukkah the second day.) See also Pri Megadim on M\"A for another reason. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In terms of Shehechiyanu on the second day for Shofar, it is not as clear as you make it sound that this should be the Halacha. First of all Rashi in a Teshuva (quoted in Tur OC 600) quotes and argues with his Rabbis whether to say Shehechiyanu at Kiddush on the second night. His Rabbis argued not to, as it is one long day. Rashi disagrees because even in the days of the Mikdash they would say Shehecheyanu on both days because whenever there was a second day of Rosh Hashana, it was the real one. The Halacha follows Rashi, but the custom is to have a new fruit or new clothing at the time of Kiddush to fulfill the opinion of Rashi's Rabbis as well.</p>\n\n<p>As for Shofar, the same discussion would apply, although see Beit Yosef 600 who seems to quote opinions that wouldn't say Shehecheyanu on the second day if the first day was a weekday (if the first day was Shabbat and the Shofar is not blown then all agree Shehecheyanu is said by Shofar on the second day). Also see Bach who tries to argue that the argument of Rashi's Rabbis doesn't apply to Shofar, although neither I nor the Mishna Berura (Shaar Hatziyun 5) seem to understand his argument.</p>\n\n\n",

What exactly was their sin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Sforno suggests that we begin by understanding the motivations of these people.  Why did they wish to create a single monolithic society?  Sforno seems to say that the objective was to empower a single ruler over all of humanity.  This would be accomplished through two steps.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A great capital city would be built.  </li>\n<li>The people would share a single religion, culture and language.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sforno explains that Hashem opposed the creation of a universal form of idolatry.  The pervasiveness of the shared religious beliefs discourages any individual from seeking an alternative theology.  This is for two reasons.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The psychological pressure to conform to a universal theology would be            tremendous.</li>\n<li>Anyone challenging a universal set of beliefs would be a pariah and could not hope to find refuge anywhere.  He would be hunted down and destroyed. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These factors precluded the development of a person like Avraham who would seek the truth.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the existence of multiple religions contributes in finding Hashem.  First, in a world with multiple religions, it is natural for a person to question the credibility of the various perspectives.  Second, the development of multiple cultures and societies would provide the opportunity for a dissenter to find refuge.  When rejected from one society, he could find refuge elsewhere.  In short, the Haflagah contributed to the development of Avraham. As a result of these considerations, Hashem caused the Dispersion.  This, in turn, produced a variety of cultures and religions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ספורנו עה\"ת ספר בראשית פרק יא פסוק ד  (ד) ויאמרו הבה נבנה לנו עיר. זאת\n  הית' עצת שרי הדור להמליך את נמרוד על כל המין האנושי: ומגדל וראשו בשמים\n  ונעשה לנו שם. נעשה שם שתהיה במגדל ויצא בכל המין האנושי שם גובה מקומה\n  וגודל עירה באופן שתחשב אלהי האלהים אצל כל בני האדם ואליה ידרשו כלם.\n  והכונה בזה היתה שהמלך על אותה העיר ימלוך על כל המין האנושי בהיות שם\n  דרישת כלם:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>ספורנו עה\"ת ספר בראשית פרק יא פסוק ו  (ו) הן עם אחד. כי אמנם הבטול\n  המפר עצות ומניא מחשבות הוא המחלוקת הקורה אם לסבת הדתות ואם לסבת\n  הלשונות. והנה אלה היו עם אחד בענין הדת כי היו כלם מסכימים בדעת אנשי\n  הצא\"בה ועם זה היה כלם מסכימים בלשון: וזה החלם לעשות. וגם כן נמצאה לכלם\n  עתה זאת ההתחלה שעשו בהסכמת כלם: ועתה לא יבצר מהם. אם כן אין מונע להם\n  מהשלים כונתם ותהיה אותה עו\"ג אשר יבחרו כללית לכל מין האדם ולא יפנה אחד\n  מהם לדעת את הבורא ית' ולהבין כי יוצר הכל הוא. והפוך זה יקרה כשתהיה\n  מחלוקת בענין האלהות כי כל אחד יחשוב שיש אלהי האלהים שכל האלוהות\n  מסכימי' לדעתו ובו ישלם סדרם וסדר המציאו' כאמרו כי ממזרח שמש ועד מבואו\n  גדול שמו בגוים:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <strong>Rasa\"g</strong> (probably based <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0111.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">on the simple reading of Perek 11, Passuk 4</a>) explains that their sin was that they wanted to stay in one singular area and not filling the earth as Hashem commanded them earlier, which led Him to disperse them (see passuk 8).

He explains that\nthese people did not sin in any way. They were not dispersed as a punishment. Instead, they\nwere dispersed in order to assure the preservation of humanity. Concentration of the entire\nhuman race in a single location created the possibility of sudden extinction. A localized natural\ndisaster could destroy the entire species. Through dispersing humanity the impact of a localized\nnatural disaster was diminished. Should a specific location experience a devastating disaster,\nonly a portion of humanity would be destroyed. The remainder would survive.\nRalbag makes another important point. He discusses the manner in which the Dispersion was\nbrought about. Hashem awakened in families the desire to differentiate themselves. This led to\nthe establishment of different customs and eventually completely unique languages.</p>\n\n<p>See רלבג עה\"ת ספר בראשית פרק יא פסוקים ב-ט </p>\n\n\n",

The Rema (89:3) goes further, saying that one must wait after a meat dish just as if he had actually eaten a piece of meat.</p>\n<p>Although the Shulchan Aruch is not stringent on this matter, the Beis Yosef (Orach Chaim 173) does mention the stringency, and later authorities (Ashkenazi and Sefardi alike, including the Ben Ish Chai and the Kaf Hachaim) are stringent in this matter.</p>\n<p>Eating the fries implies consuming the meaty oil, and therefore one must wait after eating them before milk (Source: <a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2011/07/08/frying-in-meaty-oil/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dinoline.org</a>).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/sidebar/lecture.cfm/871104/rabbi-hershel-schachter/basic-kitchen-kashrut-for-young-couples/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Schachter</a> (\"Basic Kitchen Kashrut\" end of shiur) explained that one doesn't need to wait 6 hours after having french fries from a restaurant that fried them in the same deep fryer that was used to fry chicken. This is true if the cook didn't intend for the meat taste to be imparted into the french fries and just uses the same oil for convenience. In that case, the fries aren't even considered tavshil basar. This ruling is based on the Rama YD 89:3, Shach YD 89:19, and Yad Yehuda 89.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Horah Brurah 89:43 writes that the pot needs to be clean in order for the food to be considered parve and not meat. In the biurim he explains that for Sephardim the idea of the Shach doesn't follow from the Bet Yosef 173:1. Additionally, the Bet Meir 89 argues on the Shach since if the remnant foods are more than sixty certainly that's called a meat dish.</p>\n<p>This also disputed between Rabbi Felder and Divrei Moshe whether the deep fried food which was fried in the same oil as meat or chicken was fried in requires the one eating the food to wait six hours. Rav Felder is strict since the Shach was only talking about a pot which was clean but there was a bit of meat remaining unintentionally. Also, teimat yisrael doesn't help since the taste of chicken or meat fat and vegetable oil is very similar.</p>\n\n\n",

The customary ordering of the books is different. Christian translations, especially more contemporary ones, are open to conjecturing that scribal error crept in and suggesting emendations. But, yes, you're looking at something that aims to be a translated version of the same texts. In general, Jews learn the original text in the original language, consulting commentaries, rather than using translations into other languages. And there is huge body of tradition explaining the text and a long line of give-and-take among commentators that is very important to Jews studying the Bible.</p>\n\n\n",

She's not religious now; that could change, especially when children arrive on the scene.  You're currently ok with marrying someone not of your religion; what happens if you find yourself becoming more evangelical in the future?

When G-d created Adam originally he created him \"male and female\" split them in two and then commanded them to become married to become one again. Thus marriage is the reuniting of both body and soul. The Jew and the non Jew are fundamentally different at the soul level. This incompatibility results in a relationship of sorts but not an actual marriage. While this is not an easy pill to swallow as it involves a highly emotional subject both the christian and the jew should seek out partners they are better suited for. As far as treatment goes it depends on the context mostly and there could be a number of reactions but are all based on the individuals level of politeness. One area that is significant to point out would be religious participation. A non-jew has no requirements in the Jewish faith as far as commandments (except 7 universal laws applied to everyone) and so that person would be excluded from leading in synagogue activities not for any personal dislike but because they aren't jewish much in the same way a non christian would not receive communion</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>How intermarried couples are treated by the Jewish community:</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, each intermarriage is seen as a grave tragedy, because even if the children are technically Jewish, they are unlikely to have a strong Jewish identity and will probably intermarry themselves. A Jew who marries a Christian is likely to have grandchildren or great-grandchildren who are mainly Christian (or at least non-Jewish). This is very painful for many with a connection to Judaism, because Jews have maintained their faith through thousands of years of exile and persecutions (the worst of which were perpetrated by Christians).</p>\n\n<p>However, the practical answer to your question depends on what Jewish community you are referring to. The Jewish community is made up of a number of different groups. For unaffiliated, unreligious Jews, intermarriage is pretty normal. So they would probably not treat you differently. If you tried to convert them to Christianity, this would be different, as even secular Jews would not take kindly to that.</p>\n\n<p>For Reform or Reconstructionist Jews, intermarriage may be discouraged in general but in practice is common. Synagogues and other religious groups affiliated with these denominations have been trying to reach out to intermarried couples to encourage them to be involved in the Jewish community in some way (to attend services, send their children to Jewish schools (whether or not they are Jewish under Jewish law), attend community Jewish events, etc. </p>\n\n<p>For this reason, these denominations probably treat intermarried couples as they would anyone else, even if the non-Jewish spouse has no intention of converting. (In these denomination, the conversion to Judaism of a non-Jew already married to a Jew is common, and is usually not a particularly difficult or lengthy process. However, such conversions would not be accepted by Orthodox Jews (or many Conservative Jews), because they are not done in accordance with Jewish law.)</p>\n\n<p>Under Conservative Judaism, while intermarriage is forbidden, if an intermarried couple were to start attending a Conservative synagogue, they would probably be welcome (even if the non-Jew may not formally be able to become a member), because synagogues in general are in need of more members and do not want to discourage anyone. Conversion to Judaism of a non-Jew already married to a Jew is also fairly common in Conservative Judaism, though the process tends to take longer and has more requirements in terms of knowledge and observance (and would not be accepted by Orthodox Jews). </p>\n\n<p>Orthodox Judaism forbids intermarriage, and it is rarer than in other denominations. While intermarriage is considered a sin, and a very consequential one due to the fact that the children will either be non-Jewish or will probably not identify as Jews, I'm not sure if that would mean Orthodox Jews would actually treat such couples poorly on a personal level. In practice, it is fairly common for a non-Jew already married to a Jew to convert Orthodox. Even so, this is a long process that requires becoming completely observant, and can cause marital difficulties if one spouse is less interested than the other.</p>\n\n<p>Within Orthodoxy, Chabad is a chassidic movement focused on outreach to non-Orthodox Jews. Their goal is to encourage the fulfillment of mitzvos (commandments) by all Jews, and every mitzvah is considered precious. For this reason, they are very accepting of everyone and do not pressure anyone to become completely observant. It does often happen that an intermarried family (or the Jews in the family) will at least occasionally attend Chabad events or services (without fear of being mistreated or ostracized).</p>\n\n<p>Effects on the children: </p>\n\n<p>Will the children be raised as Christian, Jewish, both, or neither? Regardless, having parents of different religions can be a source of difficulty for the child, who may feel unsure about his or her identity, and may feel guilty for choosing one of the religions (as if it would mean rejecting the other parent). It also may lead to marital conflicts on the subject of how to raise the children, which can affect the children as well.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of Jewish law, there is at least one effect having a non-Jewish father could have on the children. If you have a daughter, she would not be able to marry a kohen. (However, under the law if she marries one anyway they are not required to divorce). This would only be relevant if the daughter decides to become Orthodox (as the other Jewish groups have abandoned the rules relating to kohen marriages). In that case, it would restrict somewhat her dating/marriage options.</p>\n\n\n",

Given that one of the two examples of such a woman is a gentile, the practical upshot is that the offspring of a non-Jewish woman is always non-Jewish, irrespective of who her partner is.</p>\n\n<p>(There have always been dissenting voices to this principle, an opinion to the contrary even being recorded in the post-Mishnaic Avot deRebi Natan, but the halakha is as I have outlined it. For further information on the development of this principle and its potential social origins, I recommend Shaye J.D.

In fact, the product of a Jewish mother and non-Jewish father is considered by Jewish law to technically have <em>no</em> father. (They are identified in a <em>ketubah</em>, for instance, as \"the son of [mother's name]\", or \"the son of [maternal grandfather's name].\" A kid whose father is a Jewish product of adultery is a lot worse-off in Jewish law than a kid whose father wasn't Jewish (in which case dad's parentage is totally moot).</p>\n\n<p>I don't know where you got this \"sins to the soul\" business, but it doesn't fit with the laws described in the above paragraph, nor sound like anything I've heard in classical Jewish sources.</p>\n\n<p>If you wanted to propose some basic suggestion as to understanding why (not \"oh the reason is x and therefore x doesn't apply so I don't have to keep it\"), it may be that mom tends to be more of an influence on kids than dad. Note that the Biblical source for matrilineal descent occurs in a warning on pagan influences -- \"don't marry your son or daughter to a pagan, as the male pagan will influence your grandchildren\" -- implying that the female pagan's children aren't even \"yours\", Jewish grandpa.</p>\n\n\n",

Reading, silently or aloud, passages from Tanakh isn't restricted to Jews, as evidenced by the lack of outcry from Jews when Christians quote our texts all the time.  (There may be outcry about their <em>interpretations</em>, of course, but not that they read a passage from D'varim aloud.)</p>\n\n<p>As for prayers, some use the phrasing \"praised is God... who has sanctified us with the commandment to X\".  These are inappropriate for a non-Jew to say because God hasn't given the non-Jew that commandment.  Other prayers are not of this form and I believe there is more flexibility there.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is forbidden for a non-Jew to say either type of prayer on behalf of the community; the community cannot fulfill its obligation to bless through someone who is not obligated.  (This is why, when there is a bar mitzvah in a family with a convert or an intermarriage, the non-Jewish relatives are not allowed to recite the torah blessings.)</p>\n\n<p>It's worth noting that a person in the process of converting will begin to say that class of prayers for himself well in advance of conversion, but not on behalf of others.</p>\n\n\n",

Joseph Albo explains that (contra Maimonides) not praying to anyone or anything other than God is not to be counted as a fundamental or derivative principle of the religion precisely because there are specific verses in the Bible that forbid it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The truth of the matter is that none of the commandments of the Torah should be regarded as principles, fundamental or derived. It follows from this that the duty to worship God alone, which is in Maimonides’ list, should not be counted as a principle, primary or secondary, for it is a specific command: <strong>“Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any manner of likeness... thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them;...”</strong></p>\n<p>(Husik translation Vol. I p. 124-125, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, Maimonides explicitly states (Commentary to Mishnah, Introduction to Sanhedrin Chapter 10) that praying to an intermediary is linked to idolatry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן אין ראוי לעבדם כדי להיותם אמצעים לקרבם אליו אלא אליו בלבד יכוונו המחשבות ויניחו כל מה שזולתו וזה היסוד החמישי הוא שהזהיר על ע\"ז ורוב התורה מזהרת עליו</p>\n<p>And similarly it is improper to serve them in order for them to be intermediaries to bring them closer to Him. Rather, to Him alone they should direct their thoughts, and they should leave aside everything other than Him. This is the fifth principle, which warns against idolatry, and the majority of the Torah warns against it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The second understanding brought by the <em>Mechaber</em> there would seem to be the primary source (at least as far as it is codified in the Shulchan Aruch) for purchasing <em>mehudar arbah minim</em>. It explains (if I'm reading it correctly) that one should pay an additional third to purchase an <em>esrog</em> with greater <em>hiddur</em>. Although the Poskim (see M.B. 2 citing the M.A.) point out that this applies to other mitzvah items as well, which would in principle include <em>sha'ar arbah minim</em>) the advice to choose the more <em>mehudar esrog</em> was in no way contingent upon the <em>hiddur</em> of the rest of the <em>arbah minim</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

When none is forthcoming, Eliyahu tells them (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.18.27?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">18:27</a>) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Call with a loud voice, for he is a god.

So perhaps Eliyahu we see at least had a sense of humor. (Although I'll wager that the priests of Baal didnt find it half as funny!!!) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>There is an excellent book by Yehuda Radday and Athalya Brenner, entitled <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1850752419\" rel=\"noreferrer\">On Humor and the Comic in the Hebrew Bible</a></em> (JSOTS Series; Continuum International Publishing Group, 1990). I don't have a copy on hand, so I cannot provide you with the relevant page numbers, but the sorts of issues that they explore are whether or not, and to what extent, Jonah is a parody and Esther is a parody, whether or not there is scatological humour in such passages as Ehud's assassination of the fat Moabite king, and so on. For passages within the Torah in particular, I seem to remember them mentioning situational humour (such as when Pharaoh's magicians demonstrate their prowess by making the plagues worse), and puns. That last one is important, since it underscores the fact that humour isn't necessarily that which makes you laugh.</p>\n\n<p>To my mind, the most beautiful example is one found outside of the Torah, in the book of Samuel. When we meet Saul, we are told that he is exceptionally handsome and very tall. On his way to find the seer, Samuel, he encounters a group of young girls drawing water from a well. (Almost every book I've ever seen on the Hebrew Bible as literature mentions the trope of 'boy meets girl at well'). When Saul asks them about the location of the seer, they respond with the most syntactically awkward conglomeration of phrases, anticipating and repeating one another in confusion. Rather than suppose that we are looking at a corrupted text (as some have, historically, supposed), it makes greater sense to suggest that the author is representing the sound of a group of young girls speaking over one another in order to answer the handsome stranger.</p>\n\n<p>For the Torah in particular, one of my favourite examples (and one not mentioned in Radday and Brenner's book) is the response of Cain to his punishment. He is already singled out as being arrogant (his statement in 4:13 can be read as both an expression of anguish and a rhetorical question: \"Is my crime too great to be forgiven!?\"), so it is unsurprising that after being condemned to a life of vagrancy he goes and settles himself elsewhere and founds a city.</p>\n\n<p>The specific punishment that God gave him was that he be \"נע ונד\" (a wanderer and a vagabond) upon the earth - 4:12. Both of those words are participles, which means that they can be read as verbs (wander, move back and forth) or as nouns (one who wanders, etc). The land in which Cain settles himself after receiving this punishment is Nod - formed off the participle of נד! In other words, it would be like somebody being told they must be \"a wanderer\", so settling in a land called \"Wander\".</p>\n\n<p>As to whether or not these are viable examples, and as to whether or not they reside in the minds of interpreters, you should look at Radday and Brenner's book. There is good evidence either way, and anybody who wishes to treat the Bible as literature needs to consider the sorts of difficulties inherent in ascertaining genre and intent, given the length of time between its composition and today, the foreignness of the culture that produced it, and the fact that it is written in a language that is no longer spoken.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Postscript</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I was going to add a second answer, now that people are actually\n  providing more in the way of specific examples, but I figured I'd add it to\n  this one instead. This is an example of humour in Tanakh that I didn't\n  mention - one that I personally find very funny, and which I think is\n  <em>continually</em> mistranslated. It can be found in 1 Samuel 15:32-33, and constitutes the (rather grisly) execution of Agag, king of Amalek.</p>\n  \n  <p>When Agag is brought before Samuel, his \"famous last words\" are to\n  declare that, אכן סר מר המות. This is translated by JPS as \"Ah, bitter\n  death is at hand!\" - although they note that the Hebrew is apparently\n  uncertain. Artscroll, similarly, translates it as \"Alas, the\n  bitterness of death approaches\", the NRSV has \"Surely this is the\n  bitterness of death\", and so too several other translations.</p>\n  \n  <p>Myself, I would read סר as a masc. sg. participle of סור (\"turn\n  aside\"), its referent being מר המות.

We believe in our tradition as it has been passed down generation after generation. Thus, if a statement of Hillel is quoted in the talmud, barring a revision by a competent Rabbinic authority, we will assume that statement is from Hillel irrespective of any comparative syntactical study. </p>\n\n<p>As has been mentioned in other answers it is obviously quite easy to take any statement out of context, especially if the author's intentions are clearly malicious. If you want to know what a statement means in context I would suggest consulting an orthodox Rabbi whom I'm sure will appreciate your desire to seek the truth, and who can guide you through the ancient source text.  </p>\n\n\n",

Rabanan agree with R' Yehuda that davar she'eino mitkaven\n  is forbidden but they do decree Kirtzuf because of Kerud so they\n  forbid both. And R' Elazar Ben Azaria thinks like R' Shimon that said\n  that davar she'eino mitkaven is allowed, thus he allows both Kirtzuf\n  and Kerud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the only thing that apparantly bothers the Tanaim is making a Chabura (bruise) (and the Tosfot also mention Isur Tolesh - tearing of hair), it seems that Borrer isn't a problem.

An interesting thing I once noticed is that if you look at the Hebrew text you'll notice that when stating how each one doesn't have split hoofs the tense is different:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד. אַךְ אֶת זֶה לֹא תֹאכְלוּ מִמַּעֲלֵי הַגֵּרָה וּמִמַּפְרִיסֵי\n  הַפַּרְסָה אֶת הַגָּמָל כִּי מַעֲלֵה גֵרָה הוּא <strong>וּפַרְסָה אֵינֶנּוּ\n  מַפְרִיס</strong> טָמֵא הוּא לָכֶם: ה. וְאֶת הַשָּׁפָן כִּי מַעֲלֵה גֵרָה הוּא\n  <strong>וּפַרְסָה לֹא יַפְרִיס</strong> טָמֵא הוּא לָכֶם: ו. וְאֶת הָאַרְנֶבֶת כִּי\n  מַעֲלַת גֵּרָה הִוא <strong>וּפַרְסָה לֹא הִפְרִיסָה</strong> טְמֵאָה הִוא לָכֶם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The camel...does not have a [completely] cloven hoof (present tense)</p>\n\n<p>The hyrax... will not have a [completely] cloven hoof (future)</p>\n\n<p>The hare... didn't have  a [completely] cloven hoof (past)</p>\n\n<p>I looked in a Mikraot Gedolot but couldn't find anything about this diyuk.

However the Torah requires (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/showrashi/true/aid/9912/jewish/Chapter-11.htm#v3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">see Vayikra 11:3 and Rashi there</a>) that they be \"שסעת שסע\" - completely split into double hooves. Therefore the verse could not say \"פרסה לא הפריס\" (it does not have split hooves) which is not true, but rather said \"פרסה איננה מפריס\" - \"it has split hooves which <em>cannot be described as</em> split [according to the Torah definition]\".</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the hyrax, there is a species that is called a \"וועווער\" that resides in the clefts of the rocks in Har Sinai, which chews its cud and its hind legs have split hooves, however the front legs are not split. Since it could have possibly been considered split due to the hind legs, the Torah says \"ופרסה לא יפריס\" in the future tense, meaning that although it began splitting in one part of its body, \"it will not split\" - nature did not continue this split in its front legs.</p>\n\n<p>The hare is totally not split, and therefore the Torah simply stated \"it's hooves are not split\".</p>\n\n\n",

Nothing about returning to Egypt to convert the inhabitants.  The only return to Egypt was threatened as part of the Curse in Devarim 28:68.</p>\n\n<p>I venture to guess that your uncle got the idea as a result of the \"Telephone Game\" corruption of the idea that the Jews influenced Pharoah <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akhenaten's</a> sun-god monotheism. The opposite idea that the Jews learned monotheism from Akhenaten has also been theorized. The first idea seems more likely, since the Exodus was (approximately) a couple of generations before his reign. There had to be records extant then of the signs of the One G-d victorious during the Exodus and in the conquest of Canaan during his reign...possible reasons for that Pharoah to devote himself to one (sun) god, instead of many.   </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This theory is proposed by Rabbi Dovid Fohrman in his book, <a href=\"https://shop.alephbeta.org/products/passover-book-the-exodus-you-almost-passed-over\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Exodus You Almost Passed Over</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Fohrman spends fully the first third of the book developing just questions on the story. In addressing these questions, he proposes that ultimately, Hashem's goal was not just to free the Jews, but to convince not just any nation, but the one most stooped in paganism, that He is the one true G-d, Who wants a connection with His creations. Egypt was the perfect candidate, as not only did they worship a pantheon, they were a powerful and stable society, one which viewed their king as their creator. What greater testimony to Hashem than to convince such a king that he, in fact, is <em>not</em> the true G-d?</p>\n<p>Paroh enslaves the Jews because he can. He has the power to do so, and might makes right. Ultimately, this is the general philosophy behind paganism. By tearing down this philosophy, the Jews will go free automatically; these goals are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<h1>Plan A</h1>\n<p>Plan A was to give Paroh a nonviolent demonstration of Hashem's authority. Moshe provides some signs, with the hope that Paroh would recognize Hashem. The idea was that they would go for a three day journey, receive the Torah, go back, and teach the Egyptians about their newfound religion, all in incremental steps. Moshe first says that Hashem wants His people to celebrate with him, but Paroh isn't ready to accept this: \"Who is Hashem that I should listen to Him?!\"</p>\n<p>Moshe then backtracks: Okay, you don't get a Hashem Who wants a connection. Certainly you understand serving a higher power in general, right? Paroh doesn't reject this out of hand; he simply says that the slaves are lazy, that they don't fear him as much as they do Hashem. So he ups their workload. But had he been willing to accept that at face value, they would have gone out for their three day celebration, received the Torah, returned, and continued teaching the Egyptians, in incremental steps, what it is that Hashem wants of them.</p>\n<p>Take a closer look at the story surrounding Yaakov's burial. There's a lot of details which parallel Yetzias Mitzraim: the archers, the route taken, the deliberations about the kids and cattle, etc. Perhaps this was supposed to portend what should have happened later on: The Jews would go out for their three-day celebration, receive the Torah, come back, teach the Egyptians, and they'd all go up to Eretz Yisrael together as Hashem's people – and other nations would join in, too, as they did in Yaakov's burial.</p>\n<h1>Plan B</h1>\n<p>Instead, Paroh declares war, and so Hashem declares war in return. A polytheistic god will display power, but not precision; a monotheistic G-d is capable of both. Throughout the plagues, a careful reading will indicate that Paroh is testing Hashem's precision: he wants the frogs gone <em>tomorrow</em>, rather than <em>immediately</em>; he notes by the Arov and Dever that they didn't affect the Jews, only the Egyptians; and so on.</p>\n<h1>Plan C</h1>\n<p>But Paroh can be stubborn, and so a Plan C must be devised. Barad is the deciding factor whether Plan B or C will be the successful one: Barad is somehow tantamount to all the plagues combined; that it's only for this that Hashem has kept Paroh alive; that Hashem <em>warns</em> Paroh of how to avoid its destruction, as a monotheistic G-d Who cares about His creations rather than a polytheistic one who just displays power; that fire and ice are combined into one, something absolutely impossible in a polytheistic worldview. Paroh finally admits that Hashem is in control, but simply doesn't care; that's why only at this point does the passuk describe his stubbornness as a sin. He's too proud and arrogant to let the Jews go at this point.</p>\n<p>Plan C addresses this possibility: if the Egyptians aren't going to be actors in Hashem's display of authority, then they'll be His pawns. No longer is it that <em>Egypt</em> will know that Hashem is the true G-d, but that <em>you</em>, the Jewish people will know. The Egyptians are no longer actors, but rather pawns, in Hashem's revealing to the world His authority. Paroh's servants get it: \"Until when will this be a trap for us? Don't you know that Egypt is lost?\" They see that Paroh is being trapped in his arrogance, and that Hashem is the one in charge.</p>\n<p>Because Plan C is playing on Paroh's arrogance, while Paroh keeps requesting that Moshe let him save face, Moshe's not having it. They're going to be taking <em>everyone</em>, and all of their animals. No deals are going to be brokered here. And as Paroh gets more desperate, Moshe intentionally provokes him: not only are we not leaving any cattle, why don't we take some of yours, too?</p>\n<p>Leading to the climax of Plan C, the firstborn motif which is so prominent through the story – right from the beginning, Hashem says that Bnei Yisrael are His firstborn, and so the Egyptians' firstborn will be killed as a result – comes full circle. Those who are willing to be Hashem's firstborn, to have that connection with him: they can survive. Those who are only firstborn of a human will perish.</p>\n<p>Finally, Kri'as Yam Suf. If you read carefully, it's basically a repeat of Creation all over again: there's the wind blowing over the waters, the separation of light and dark in the form of the pillars of cloud and fire, the separation of waters, the drying of the seabed. Chazal are winking at us when they propose that there were fruit trees growing in the Yam Suf, as if to reassure us that this pattern is real: after all, vegetation was the next thing in the Creation story after the drying of the continents. The irony here is perfect: in this momentous display of Hashem's having created the world, the Egyptians, who refused to serve their Creator, drowned in the sea, as these signs of creation were removed and the waters crashed down on their head. You want to deny a world with a Creator? Then live in a world without one.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>Your suggestion that \"the original intention was for the Jews to go out of Egypt to receive the Torah, <em>and then come back to convert the Egyptians.</em>\" was indeed the Plan A. Paroh wasn't up to the task, so Plans B and C had to come into play, to ultimately show them, the Jews, and the world that \"there is none like Hashem in all the land.\"</p>\n<p>I've attempted to pose his basic theory, but I can't possibly do it full justice. There's so much more than what I've described here. I highly recommend that you take a look at his book if you're interested in pursuing this further.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>We see from the dvar Torah from Rabbi Moshe Kormornick (<a href=\"http://shortvort.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.shortvort.com</a>) quoted above that the Jews definitely did not have any intention of returning to Egypt to convert the Egyptians!</p>\n\n<p>We can also add a proof to this based on Hashem's words to Moshe: \"You will not see Pharoah every again (alive)\" We also have a debate in the Gemora whether Pharaoh was killed or not at the time of the splitting of the sea.

    "content": "# Why use an active verb with no subject?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In parshat Noach, perek 7, pasuk 23, The opening word \"וַיִּמַח\" is presented as an active verb, attested to by the presence of the word אֶת (I am summarizing the discussion of rashi and the Sapperstein explanation, driven by the lack of a dagesh in the mem).</p>\n\n<p>כג וַיִּמַח אֶת-כָּל-הַיְקוּם אֲשֶׁר עַל-פְּנֵי הָאֲדָמָה, מֵאָדָם עַד-בְּהֵמָה עַד-רֶמֶשׂ וְעַד-עוֹף הַשָּׁמַיִם, וַיִּמָּחוּ, מִן-הָאָרֶץ; וַיִּשָּׁאֶר אַךְ-נֹחַ וַאֲשֶׁר אִתּוֹ, בַּתֵּבָה</p>\n\n<p>The ramban, when he discusses this section of the pasuk uses the idea in the passive, as it is used further on in the pasuk.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, from pasuk 17 and on, the opening verbs are either in the active form with an initially explicit subject - \"hamayim\" or \"hateivah\" (as in  וַיִּרְבּוּ הַמַּיִם, וַיִּשְׂאוּ אֶת-הַתֵּבָה, וַתָּרָם, מֵעַל הָאָרֶץ.  יח וַיִּגְבְּרוּ הַמַּיִם וַיִּרְבּוּ מְאֹד, עַל-הָאָרֶץ; וַתֵּלֶךְ הַתֵּבָה, עַל-פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם) or in the passive (וַיְכֻסּוּ, וַיִּגְוַע). In this pasuk, though, there seems to be an importance to the fact that the verb is active and yet no subject is listed. If it has been in the passive (either with or without the אֶת), it would have made perfect and consistent sense. Does anyone have any insight as to why this choice of the unattributed active might be? I can understand not wanting to attribute erasing mankind to the water which was just a proxy for hashem and thus making the verb singular, but then why not say \"elokim\" in the beginning of 23?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The difference between active and passive verbs has nothing to do with whether or not there is a subject, but whether or not that subject is having the verb done to it (whether or not it is the \"patient\", in other words, rather than the \"agent\"). The verbs ויכסו (in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0107.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">7</a>:19 and 20) and ויגוע (in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0107.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">7</a>:21) are both in possession of subjects (ההרים and כל-בשר, respectively).</p>\n\n<p>As for the active verbs that you mention, what gives you the impression that וימח (in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0107.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">7</a>:23) lacks a subject? It is in possession of an initial <em>yud</em>, marking it as a 3rd masc. sg. imperfective. There's your subject: a masculine singular entity. Were its subject the water, it would say וימחו, given that water (מים) is a masc. pl. word.</p>\n\n<p>That said (and this is where Rashi's observations are relevant), the only thing that indicates to us that this is an active verb with כל-היקום as its subject is the Masoretic vocalisation - not the presence of the word את. Had they placed a <em>dagesh</em> in the <em>mem</em>, it would be a niphal and not a qal. Compare, for example, וימּחו later on in that same verse, and וישּאר immediately afterwards. The presence of את does not, by itself, prevent us from reading the verb as a passive. Examples of niphals that take את include <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0104.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 4</a>:18 and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0512.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deuteronomy 12</a>:22, amongst others.</p>\n\n\n",

However, when the soviets came they pushed locals to withdraw their tribal surnames and change them into russian sounding names with 'eva','ev' at the end. This is what my great grandparents told me. Some tribal surnames are: Naiman, Aday, Kerei, Alan, Argyn, Kagan. After the collapse of the USSR some Kazakh returned back (or returning) to their original tribal surnames.

Here is a review I read:\n<a href=\"http://matzav.com/dirshu-edition-of-mishna-berurah-chelek-gimel-revolutionizes-the-learning-of-hilchos-shabbos\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://matzav.com/dirshu-edition-of-mishna-berurah-chelek-gimel-revolutionizes-the-learning-of-hilchos-shabbos</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Making coleslaw and potato salad on Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>All of the halachos in regards to lisha on Shabbos have always been difficult to understand. What do the poskim say in regards to making coleslaw (mixing together small pieces of cabbage and carrots together with mayonnaise and other ingredients) and potato salad (mixing together relatively bigger pieces of potato together with mayonnaise and other ingredients.) Seemingly the coleslaw (without making a shinui) would be a problem as by mixing in the mayonnaise it puts together the salad. However with the potato salad perhaps this would be <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/591\">muter</a> (even without a shinui) since mixing together the potatoes with the mayonnaise doesn't actually stick them together like it does to the coleslaw or other mixtures. I'm looking for sources for this two questions with poskim that speak about them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The definition of the <em>melocha</em> of <em>losh</em> is that multiple ingredients are <strong>converted</strong> into one entity (Shmiras Shabbos Kehilchosa 8:1 citing Mishna Berura 321:50). Therefore a mixture of bits or chunks of food that cling together with a liquid or oil is not included in <em>losh</em>, because the pieces do not appear to melt into a single mass, but rather are clumped together by the liquid medium which acts somewhat as a glue. Since the individual segments visibly retain their separate identities, they cannot be classified as a solid, unified mass (the \"39 Melochos\" book by Rabbi Dovid Ribiat Volume 2 pg. 547 based on Taz 321:15 and Mishna Berura S\"K 68). Based on this, Shmiras Shabbos Kehilchoso (8:4) permits preparing potato salad on Shabbos, and the \"39 Melochos\" book (pg. 548) writes that coleslaw is also permitted. Although the cabbage strips stick pretty well they still remain individually identifiably and not one mass of salad.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps, the rabbi in yeshiva adapted the story when seeing that his talmidim show interest in philosophy. Certainly, the story would not be significantly different from using Kant instead of Bismark.</p>\n<p>The source of the story, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Rosenstain\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Moshe Rosenstein</a>, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/32675\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yesodei Da'as</a>, Choveres Aleph, perek 26 (page 40). The <em>mashal</em> is given in connection with his discussion of the differences between <em>chazal</em> and wise men of the world discussed in section 25:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמשל בזה, אם ינתן לסוס שכלו של ביסמארק אשר היה בזמנו חכם\nמדיני היותר גדול בעולם, אבל נפש הסוס תשאר כמו שהיתה, הנה לא יהיה\nבזה לאדם וישאר סוס כמו שהיה, ושכלו הגדול ישתמש בו אך ורק להוציא\nלפועל עניניו הסוסיים, אף שבעניניו אלו יהיה יותר פקח מכל בני אדם ואם יבוא\nבמשא ומתן עמהם לא יעמדו לפניו כנגד כל תחבולותיו וערמתו, ויוכל לרמות\nבתחבולות שונות אף את היותר פקחים בבני אדם, ובכל זה ישאר סוס כמו שהית\nמפני שנפשו היא סוסית, וכל עניניו ושאיפותיו כלם יהיו ענינים סוסיים לבד\nולא אנושיים. ועל דרך זה יש לנו לדעת שהבדל מדרגות בני אדם אינו\nתלוי בגדל השכל והפקחות, כי אם בחשיבות ומעלת לבו ונפשו של אדם,\nאם המה זכים וטהורים גם השכל זך, ואם נפשו של אדם אינה זכה\nוטהורה והיא נמשכת אחר הקנאה והתאוה והכבוד גם שכלו ימשך אחריה,\nויאמת השקר ויכזב את האמת, ויאמר לרע טוב ולטוב רע לחשך אור ולאור\nחשך (כמאמר ספר הישר, ש\"השכל פרי הנפש וכאשר העץ כן פריו״). וזה\nעיקר הסוד והיסוד של ההבדל בין חכמינו ז״ל לחכמי העולם, שחז״ל\nהיו קדושי עליון כמלאכי אלהים, ונפשם היתר, זכה ובהירה ומאירה כשמש\nבצהרים וכאור שבעת ימי בראשית, ובכן היה שכלם זך ובהיר וראו כל\nהאמתיות וידעו סודות העליונים ותחתונים, וכמאמר הכתוב ,סוד ה׳ ליראיו״ ,\nועליהם יש לנו לסמוך בכל עניני חיינו, אבל חכמי העולם אשר יחסר להם\nעבודת אלהים ולמוד התורד, וכל המ״ח דברים שהתורה נקנית בהם, הנת\nהיתה נפשם לעומת חז״ל כנפש הסוס לעומת נפשנו, ושכלם בודאי היה נמשך\nאחרי נפשם מפני שהוא פריה, ומזה ידע כל אחד, שאין שום מקום ודמיון\nלהשוות חכמי העולם לחכמינו ז״ל.</p>\n<p>And the parable for it (i.e. comparison of <em>chakhamim z\"l</em> with the wise men of the world) is this. If a horse were given the mind of Bismarck, who was in his time the greatest statesman in the world, but the soul of the horse remained equine, as it was, then it would not make him human, rather he would remain being a horse. And its great mind would be used solely to carry out its equine affairs, although in these matters it would be more clever than any human being. And if it entered into negotiations with them, they would not stand before it against all its tricks and deceit. And it would be able to deceive even the cleverest of humans with various tricks, and in all this the horse would remain as it was, because its soul is that of a horse, and all its affairs and aspirations would be solely equine affairs and not human. (The parable suggests an idea for contemplation which helps to understand) that the difference in the spiritual levels of human beings does not depend on the greatness of intellect and intelligence, but on the significance and exaltation of a person's heart and soul. If they are clear and pure, the intellect is also pure. However, if a person's soul is not clear and pure and is drawn to envy, lust, and honor, his mind will also be drawn to it. He will make the lie true and deny the truth, and will call evil good and good evil, darkness light and light darkness (as the Sefer haYashar says, \"Intellect is the product (literally \"fruit\") of the soul, and its fruit is in accordance with the kind of the tree that it is\"). This is the main secret and foundation of the difference between our Sages, of blessed memory, and the wise of the world. Our Sages were saints of the Most High, like the angels of G-d, and their souls were pure and bright, they shone like the sun at noon and like the light of the seven days of Creation. Thus, their minds were clear and pure, and perceived eternal truth and knew the secrets of the higher and lower worlds, as the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.25.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 25:14</a> says \"The counsel of Hashem is for those who fear Him; to them He makes known His covenant.\" And we must trust them in all the matters of our lives.  However, the wise men of the world lack the service of G-d and the study of the Torah, and all the forty-eight ways in which the Torah is acquired (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.6.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 6:6</a>). Therefore, comparison of their souls to our sages souls would be similar comparison of the soul of a horse compared to our (human) souls. And their intellect would certainly be drawn after their souls because their intellect is the product (\"fruit\") of their souls. And from this parable everyone understood that there is no way or possibility to compare the wise men of the world to our Sages, of blessed memory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How was Er considererd to be married to Tamar?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemarah (yevamos 34b) indicates that Er slept with Tamar sh'lo k'darka. If this is the case how was Er ever married to Tamar if the injunction of the pasuk  וְדָבַק בְּאִשְׁתּוֹ (Bereshis 2:24) is not fulfilled?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Gemarah in Yevamot 55b says that all ביאה works even it is done שלא כדרכה. (Tosafot on 20a s.v. יבא say that the reason is that the people having ביאה need to be able to impregnate/be impregnated, not that the act of ביאה needs to be able to impregnate.) The one exception is a שפחה חרופה, as that needs שכבת זרע to be חייב (learned out on Yevamot 55a/b). Being that this is so, the ביאה needed for קידושין need not be כדרכה, and ער was indeed קונה though קדושי ביאה.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is no question that Er was married to Tamar as indicated in Bereshis 38:8, the easiest way to answer this question is to say that Er and Onan had a din of a ben Yisroel, not a ben Noach, even before Matan Torah. Based on this assumption it would be a question of if kiddushin is chal on chayvei la'vim which it is(as opposed to if they were b'nei noach it would be chayvei misah). </p>\n\n<p>to really be m'varer this sugya you need to see the summary in the sefer Mitzvos Hashem Bara on Vayishlach (appended to <a href=\"http://orot.com/maamar-al-yishmael/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this work</a>).

Again the nafka minah would be difficult to find since chicken is itself a d'rabbanan. If the skin of the chicken itself is not considered to be like the baser but would still create an issur of baser b'chalav to some degree then perhaps it would be 2 d'rabbanans. Maybe that would be the application in terms of chicken skin based on Siman 87 Sif 7. However I'm in doubt as to whether it's speaking about an edible skin which might be different.

This is based on Rambam (Hil Ma'achlos Assuros 4:21) that such edible skins are considered meat in regards to the prohibition of neviala, treifa, and tomei.

Is it, therefore, a good thing to use a picture of the Western Wall as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrah\" rel=\"nofollow\">“mizrach”</a> (\"mizrach\" refers to an ornamental wall plaque used to indicate the direction of prayer in Jewish homes).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The relevant quote from <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/8/90/22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav</a> is as follows (my own translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בגדים המצויירים שתולים בכותלי בית הכנסת לנוי אע\"פ שמן הדין אין בהם משום חציצה אין נכון להתפלל כנגדם כדי שלא יהא מביט בציורם ולא יכוין בתפלתו ואם יקרה לו להתפלל נגדם יעצים עיניו וגם כשמציירים כותלי בית הכנסת נכון שלא לצייר ציורים נגד פניו של אדם אלא למעלה מקומת איש.</p>\n  \n  <p>Pictures that are hung on the walls of a synagogue for decoration; although they are not considered a \"separation\", it is nonetheless <strong>not correct</strong> to pray in front of them, to avoid looking at the illustrations and lose concentration in his prayers. If he happens to pray in front of them, he should close his eyes. Similarly, when decorating a synagogue, it is correct not to draw pictures at eye level, but rather they should be placed above the height of people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems quite clear from the words of the Shulchan Aruch Harav that this is a practical recommendation - it's not advisable to daven in front of things that will distract you.</p>\n\n<p>This is the way the Lubavitcher Rebbe seems to understand the law. He writes in a letter (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15900&st=&pgnum=154\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iggres Kodesh vol. 10 pg. 137</a>) that a possible justification for those shuls which do not follow the above and do have decorations, is that people who frequent the shul will not become distracted since they are already used to the decorations. He compares this to the law by Birkas Cohanim, that although a Cohen with physical deformities may not recite the blessing because it is distracting to the people present. However, if the Cohen is well known in the city it is permitted since he will no longer attract their attention. However the Lubavitcher Rebbe concludes that nonetheless this is not advisable, since newcomers may pray in the shul and get distracted.</p>\n\n<p>It therefore stands to reason that if such pictures of the Kossel do not distract the person davening in front of them (or even <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/21955/should-we-use-a-picture-of-the-western-wall-as-a-mizrach/21959#comment53437_21959\">cause him to think about Yerushalayim</a> etc.) this would not be a problem. If however, he will spend the duration of the davening admiring the artistic techniques of the painter it is surely not correct to pray in front of them.</p>\n\n\n",

Why specifically the connection between the 8 days and the 8 strings of the tzitzis? (I realize much could be said in the realm of drush, I'm more asking in the realm of p'shat as Rashi brings this.) What significance is there to this?</p>\n\n<p>(I realize also there is a famous question here since in fact it was only 7 days until klal yisrael waited until they sang shiur.

The eight days of geula come as an opinion of R' Moshe haDarshan as explained by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mizrachi%2C_Numbers.15.41.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Eliyahu Mizrachi on Bamidbar 15:41</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושמנה חוטין שבה כנגד ח' ימים ששהו ישר' משיצאו ממצרי' עד שאמרו שירה על הים שהוא סותר מה שכתב בפרש' בשלח ליל שביעי ירדו לים ובשחרית אמרו שירה והוא יום שביעי של פסח לכך אנו קורין השירה ביום השביעי של פסח כי אלה הדברים האמורים פה הם דברי ר' משה הדרשן וליה לא סבירא ליה:</p>\n<p>And the eight threads in tzitzis correspond to 8 days that they waited to say the <em>Shira</em> from the moment of leaving Mitzraim - that contradicts what we wrote in parsha Beshalach, that on the night of the 7th day they went down into the sea and in the morning they sang <em>Shira</em>, which was the 7th day of Pesach. Thus we read the <em>Shirah</em> from the Torah on the 7th day of Pesach. Rashi was quoting the opinion of R'Moshe haDarshan and we do not accept it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The commentary Nachalas Yaakov on Bamidbar 15:41 (missing in Sefaria) presents two solutions to the apparent contradiction: either we have to count one extra day into the geula until the Jewish people left the Red Sea; or as Rabbeinu Bachya notes and also Gur Ariyeh, the freedom from the power of Mitzraim occured to Jewish people on the 14th of Nissan when they slaughtered <em>korban Pesach</em>. Thus we have 8 days of <em>geula</em>.</p>\n<p>We can see that all the 8 days of <em>geula</em>, the Jewish people had an enormous connection to Hashem.

The word \"es\" is similar to (Yeshayahu 2:4) \"le'itim ve'limazmeros\" - \"plowshares and pruning hooks\"; since they are sharp instruments similar to knifes we derive the obligation to prepare the knifes on Erev Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Korban Shabbos (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24980&st=&pgnum=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Perek 1 Siman 7</a>) explains the Kabbalistical meaning behind sharpening knives on Erev Shabbos. Shabbos corresponds to the seventh millenium where evil will be banished from the world, and the food we eat on Shabbos symbolizes the Divine revelation we will then receive. Food cut with a blemished knife is a source for evil (as it creates ne'vaila), and therefore on Shabbos when evil has no power it is not fitting to eat from such a knife.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above, I would suppose that the simple kavana should be to get ready for Shabbos and to avoid strife in the house, and a more Kabbalistic kavana that the forces of Shabbos will be banished on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

Are there any opinions they are relying on? I was once told in passing that there is a shitta (in the rishonim?) that as long as you start the general tefila before the zman it's ok to start amidah after, but I never found that opinion 'inside'.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yosef Avraham Heller, the Rosh Kollel of Crown Heights, Brooklyn and former member of the Beis Din there, wrote a essay explaining the Halachic justification for davening after Chatzos, published in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48573&pgnum=36\">\"Kobetz Beis Chayenu\" 11 Nissan 5760 pg. 28</a>. The crunch of the explanation is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The Gemora (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=26&format=pdf\">Brochos 26a</a>) states that, \"He may go on praying [Shachris] the whole day. But up to midday he is given the reward of saying the Tefillah in its proper time; thereafter he is given the reward of saying Tefillah, but not of saying Tefillah in its proper time.\" Although the mainstream view in Rishonim is that of the Rashba that after Chatzos is only considered tashlumim if he accidently missed the time, the Perisha in OC Siman 89 cites an alternative view that even after Chatzos is still considered the time of davening Shachris but only that one would not receive the reward for davening on time. Rabbi Heller continues to back up this view based on many Rishonim that maintain that the time for Shachris is the entire day. Although this Prisha argues with the Mechaber and Rama, Rabbi Heller suggest that since it concurs with the view of many Rishonim,  Chassidim relied on his ruling in order to have adequate kavana in their davening.</p>\n\n<p>There are also several letters of the Lubavitcher Rebbe on the topic collected in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15787&st=&pgnum=108&hilite=\">\"Sharey Halacha U'Minhag\" OC Chelek 1 pg. 111</a>. The Rebbe brings the halacha (OC 98:2 and Rambam Hilchos Tefila 4:15-16) that proper kavanah during davening is integral to the davening, and without it the teffila is nullified. He asserts that therefore proper preparation for davening takes precedence over being exact in the time of davening.</p>\n\n<p>However, it must be stressed that all the above is only when one is involved in davening or it's preparation from before zman tefila. There is no justification to begin davening after chatzos.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of an opinion that as long as one begins before zman tefilla they may continue even after, I heard that this comes from Tosfos in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=7&format=pdf\">Brochos 7a</a> \"Sh'ilmaley\". The Gemora relates that Biliam tried to find the exact second Hashem was angry to curse the Jews, and Tosfos asks what he could have said in that short moment. In their second answer Tosfos says that as long as he would have started at a time of Divine anger the curse would work even after. Similarly, the \"zman tefilla\" follows when one begins even if he finishes after.</p>\n\n\n",

He should realize that he is fighting for the sake of the oneness of God's Name. Therefore, he should place his soul in his hand and not show fright or fear.He should not worry about his wife or children. On the contrary, he should wipe their memory from his heart, removing all thoughts from his mind except the war.Anyone who begins to feel anxious and worry in the midst of battle to the point where he frightens himself violates a negative commandment, as it is written (Deuteronomy 20:3): 'Do not be faint-hearted. Do not be afraid. Do not panic and do not break ranks before them.'Furthermore, he is responsible for the blood of the entire Jewish nation. If he is not valiant, if he does not wage war with all his heart and soul, it is considered as if he shed the blood of the entire people, as ibid. 20:8 states: 'Let him go home, lest he demoralize the hearts of his brethren like his own.' Similarly, the prophetic tradition explicitly states: 'Cursed be he who does God's work deceitfully. Cursed be he who withholds his sword from blood.' Jeremiah 48:10In contrast, anyone who fights with his entire heart, without fear, with the intention of sanctifying God's name alone, can be assured that he will find no harm, nor will bad overtake him. He will be granted a proper family in Israel and gather merit for himself and his children forever. He will also merit eternal life in the world to come as I Samuel 25:28-29 states: 'God will certainly make my lord a faithful house, for my lord fights the wars of God and evil will not be found with you... and my lord's soul will be bound in a bond of life with God.'\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Brachos Daf 2a - What does Creation have to do with Krias Shema?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemorah in Brachos Daf 2a asks two questions right away after\nlearning the Mishnah. The second is: Why is it that the Mishnah\ntaught about the time at night for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shema_Yisrael#Recitation_and_reading\" rel=\"nofollow\">Krias Shema</a> first - really we\nshould have taught the time for the day first? (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosafot\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tosfos</a> justifies this question by pointing out that since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korban\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karbonos</a> start by day, the order should have been the same here, too, perhaps since prayer is in place of the Karbonos.)</p>\n\n<p>The Gemorah gives two answers to this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Because the Torah says \"... u'b'shachbecha u'b'kumecha.\" (\"... and when you lie down, and when you arise.\") regarding Krias Shema - therefore we teach the time of night\nfirst.</p></li>\n<li><p>Because, in describing Creation, the Torah says \"...vayehi erev, vayehi boker ...\" (\"... and it was evening, and it was morning ...\") Since it spoke about night first,\nso does the Gemorah regarding Krias Shema.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The question is, what significance is there in understanding the Mishnah that the Gemorah had to give specifically these two answers? The first answer I can understand. However the second - what does it have to do with Krias Shema? Why should we refer to Creation as a way\nto teach that we should first deal with the timing of Krias Shema at night\nbefore day? What does Creation have to do with Krias Shema?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>No source on this, but my thought is that the gemara is trying to say that since <em>vayehi erev, vayehi boker</em>, we should start all things with night first.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think Tosafos (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ד\"ה אי</a>) provides an explanation which shows the relevance of the second answer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אי אמרת בשלמא דסמיך אקרא דבשכבך א\"כ אינו מקפיד קרא אלא אק\"ש אלא א\"א דסמיך אקרא דברייתו של עולם א\"כ קפיד אכל מילי א\"כ סיפא דקתני וכו</p>\n<p>It's fine if you say that [the Mishnah] relied on the verse of \"when you lie down\", as then the verse is only particular about <em>Kerias Shema</em>. But if you say that [the Mishnah] relied on the verse of the creation of the world, it is thus particular about everything and therefore the end [of the Mishnah] which states etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words Tosafos looks to the Gemara's follow-up question. The Gemara asked that once we established that the Mishnah should talk about night before day, it should continue to talk about night before day in the next Mishnah when it discusses the blessings. Tosafos points out that if we accept the Gemara's first answer above then this question is not very strong. If the whole source for the Mishnah's order is the verse that speaks about <em>Kerias Shema</em> then it would seem that the order of night before day should only apply to <em>Kerias Shema</em>. Why should we list the night blessings before the day blessings just because when it comes to <em>Shema</em> we list night before day?</p>\n<p>If, however, we accept the Gemara's second answer, the basis for the order has nothing to do with <em>Shema</em> in the first place. It must be that since the Torah describes night before day by creation, everything should always be described with night preceding day. Therefore the blessings too should be ordered thus.\nSo the answer to your question is that creation indeed does not have anything to do with <em>Shema</em>, and it is not being used as a source for the order of the discussion of <em>Shema</em>; rather it is being used as a source for all orderings.</p>\n\n\n",

Sort of mixed me up... looks like a contradiction.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a leniency and stringency each way depending on the context:</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch mentions the muktza status of bones separated from their meat twice: in Seif 27 and Seif 29. In Seif 27, Shulchan Aruch states that although the bones are no longer fit for human consumption they are not considered muktza as they can still be given to dogs. Seif 29 rules that animal food is only not considered muktzah if the animal that would eat it is common to that area. Based on this, the Rama there justifies the ruling in Seif 27 that meatless bones are not muktza, as dogs are commonly found animals.</p>\n\n<p>In Seif 27, the reason we might have considered such bones muktza is because they are similar to nolad; we now have animal food that was \"made\" on Shabbos when the meat was separated and they became no longer fit for humans. Since Shulchan Aruch rules that they are not considered muktza, it is a kal ve'chomer that if they were separated before Shabbos they are not muktza as there is certainly no question of nolad.</p>\n\n<p>Seif 29 defines the parameters where animal food is considered muktza or not. According to the Ran (the way the Rama understands him in Darkey Moshe; see Biur Halacha 29), even if animals are commonly found in the area, one who is not a pet owner cannot move animal food on Shabbos, since for him it was not prepared before Shabbos. However, the Rama rules like those who argue with the Ran, and hold that as long as there are animals commonly found even a non pet owner may move animal food. The Ran himself though would agree that if such animal food only became suitable for animals on Shabbos, but on Erev Shabbos was fit for humans, then even a non animal owner may move it as it was prepared for him before Shabbos. Thus in this case the novelty is the other way round; if the Rama rules against the Ran that even if the bones were separated from the meat on Erev Shabbos they are not muktza, certainly this would be the case if they were separated on Shabbos where even the Ran would agree.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore had God been angry at Sarah why wouldn't he have spoken directly to her (as he did with, say Miriam and Ahron)? </p>\n\n<p>Rather, God was in fact indicating to Avraham that though he (Avraham) had the exact same laughing reaction (when the same nevius was presented at the end of lech-lecha) Sarah's response was in fact <strong>BETTER</strong> and worthy of being emulated. What was the difference between the two? Sarah laughed publicly, Avraham did so privately. </p>\n\n<p>How do I know? Firstly, God omits the word b'kirbah, which means as far as Avraham knows she did so publicly. Second, Rashi says the world \"leimore\" teaches us \"l'acheirim\" to others (note this Rashi is not found in our editions but is brought down by Abravenel). </p>\n\n<p>Why did Sarah laugh publicly? I believe it was in order to cause more giluey kavod shomayim. She shared this ludicrous sounding prophecy with her friends and relatives so that when it came true it would be a bigger kiddush Hashem. This was God's lesson to Avraham; he asks rhetorically, \"Why did Sarah laugh?\" knowing that Avraham would inquire for himself (which he does, as the following pasuk where Sarah denies laughing implies that Avraham asked her to explain her behavior) and in this way God teaches Avarahm not only to emulate Sarah but to view her as a role model and to seek out her tutelage in avodas Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Some unsourced thoughts (I can break these into separate answers if that's better):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Abraham thought Sarah was too old, but G-d didn't want to embarrass him in front of his guests.

The Torah only records that which Abraham perceived.</li>\n<li><strong>Updated:</strong> G-d wanted Abraham to remember that Sarah's feelings were relevant here. Sarah wasn't in the room now, and according to Ramban, Abraham hadn't yet told Sarah about the news he had received earlier.

In fact, many manufacturers, especially higher-end ones, place stickers directly on the dish, bowl, cup, etc., even if they are sold in boxes.

I don't know if the opposite color in the spectrum represents the opposite of purity (yes, I know it's not technically the opposite, but is perceived as such); but if the purpose is to dress in a modest way that does not attract attention, there are certainly better colors than black, which seems to be the most frequently worn color in the female Jewish world (based on my unscientific study of looking around every day). This is especially true at joyous functions like a wedding. Why wear a somber color at such occasions? Furthermore, black is generally seen in the fashion world as a slimming and elegant color, so assumedly it would actually attract more attention than say a nasty brown or gray, thus defeating the purpose of wearing it to be more tznius.</p>\n\n<p>So I ask again, why do women overwhelming favor black clothing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9146&st=&pgnum=245\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shach on Shulchan Aruch 179:1 (s.k. 3)</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וצבע השחור הוא דרך צניעות והכנעה וכדאמרינן מי שיצרו מתגבר עליו ילבש שחורים ויתעטף שחורים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not clear if he's talking about men or women or both.

I can well remember my (and other people's) shock at attending a wedding in Jerusalem in the early 1990s at which the bride's female family members (right-wing Modern Orthodox, from New York) all wore black - this was completely new to all of us. In the 16 years I have been living in London, it seems that more and more women in the haredi sector are wearing black, down to small girls. I asked an acquaintance, who was a bit surprised and after some thought said she thought it was because 'black was always fashionable, so women don't have to keep buying new outfits for special occasions'. However, this wouldn't explain the everyday use of black. It seems to me that the custom has no specific, conscious source but that (a) women want to fit in with their community (b) the men in their communities wear black, so there is an element of identification with them (c) the need for distinctive dress signalling the wearer's identity as a member of a 'frum' community may be becoming more acute.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Well, for starters black matches with everything so its the easiest color to wear.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tashmish Ha-Mitah B'yom (Marital Relations by day.)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It says in Shulchan Aruch Siman <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1064\" rel=\"nofollow\">240</a> Sif 11 that it's prohibited to have marital relations by day unless the house is dark (\"Bayis Afel\".) The Rema adds that a Talmid Chacham that covers himself with his talis (or seemingly a sheet or some sort of cover) is also permitted to have marital relations by day. The Mishneh Brurah in Sif-Katan 45 explains that since a Talmid Chacham is modest in his ways he won't come to look (at his wife in the light.) Therefore it's permitted to have relations if he covers himself well. However the the M\"B ends off that this is only to be done in a case of tzrich gadol or if his yatzer is misgaver over him.</p>\n\n<p>What does it say about this inyun in other seforim or poskim? Are people more makil then the Mishneh Brurah now a days or even less? Obviously it's hard to take a survey in this however perhaps what we see from other seforim or poskim (or any \"shmu'os\") would be a good way to tell.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch speaks about a case where the entire house is dark and one is not relying on the heter of using a talis. Seemingly in that case there is more of a reason to be makil (even without a \"tzrich gadol\" -- great need. I later saw that in the Bar Hativ Siman 21 this is what he says from the Magen Avraham based on the Gemorah in Kasubos Daf <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=65&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">65</a>.) It's interesting also that the Rema speaks about being matir for a Talmid Chacham (only the reason makes sense since he is anyway more modest in his ways) why is it that the Talmid Chacham has such a \"yatzer\" to have relations by day.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>On this, and many other related issues, see Rabbi Yehuda Herzl Henkin's excellent essay in Bnei Banim 4:17.

When Abraham wanted his servant, Eliezer, to take an oath, he told him to \"place your hand under my thigh\"(Genesis 24:2). An oath is taken while holding a sacred object such as a Torah scroll or tefillin; here Abraham is telling Eliezer to swear on the part of his own body sanctified by the mitzvah of circumcision. Yet our sages tell us that \"Abraham observed the entire Torah\" though it was yet to be given [at Sinai]; so Abraham studied Torah, put on tefillin, affixed a mezuzah on his doorpost, etc. It would therefore seem that he had no shortage of \"sacred objects\" available to him. Why, then, did he have Eliezer place his hand \"under his thigh,\" contrary to all common standards of modesty and propriety?</p>\n<p>But as explained above, the import of Abraham's pre-Sinai mitzvot were of a wholly spiritual nature. Since G-d had not commanded him to do them, they remained human deeds, subject to the natural law that separated the spiritual from the material; while they had a profound effect on his own soul, the souls of his descendants, and the spiritual essence of creation, they had no impact on the material substance of the universe. The single exception was the mitzvah of circumcision, whose commandment by G-d constituted an empowerment to sanctify the physical. Thus, this was indeed the only sacred object available to Abraham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Ibn Ezra explains that this was a standard form of displaying the servant's subservience to the master, and notes that it is still in practice in India:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והקרוב אלי שהיה משפט בימים ההם לשום אדם ידו תחת ירך מי שהוא ברשותו והטעם אם אתה ברשותי שים נא ידך תחת ירכי והאדון יושב וירכו על היד הטעם הנה ידי תחת רשותך לעשות רצונך וזה המשפט עודנו היום בארץ הודו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many other commentators follow with some variation or another of this basic idea:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rashbam</li>\n<li>Bechor Shor</li>\n<li>Radak</li>\n<li>Chizkuni</li>\n<li>Rabbeinu Bechaye</li>\n<li>Tur</li>\n<li>Ibn Kaspi</li>\n<li>Ralbag</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

If someone knows no sorrow in his life, then that likely means the person will predecease everyone that is related to him - that is not a blessing at all, and certainly the blessing is meant to imply that this person should live a life in which no circumstances of sadness should ever happen again.  That is not something that can be reconciled with reality.  I also recently saw something like, \"May the Neshamah enjoy hearing the beautiful words read from the Torah written in their memory.\"  </p>\n\n<p>Should (or may) a person respond \"Amen\" to such a blessing/wish?  Does this even count as such?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The biography preceding Igros Moshe volume 8 describes how an elderly Rabbi Moshe Feinstein heard wishes for a long life -- IIRC he was at a bris and they said \"may you see his wedding!\" He tearfully acknowledged it wouldn't happen, but answered amen nonetheless.

For example if a private person lands on the moon or an asteroid can he be koneh it? Do you retain the rights to something that you send into space?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First you have to differentiate between Reshut HaRabim and Hefker.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody can do a Kinyan on Reshut haRabim; it belongs to everybody unless the \"king\" or local equivalent decides otherwise. (Unless you cause damage; it belongs to you insofar as you are responsible for restitution.)</p>\n\n<p>When a tract of land is Hefker you can do a Kinyan - appropriate to land like digging in it - but only that piece of land you dug up is yours. Unless it's fenced in, but then it's probably not Hefker. Fencing in a tract of land may be a Kinyan.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on my reading Tur and Shulchan Aruch Choshen HaMishpat these past few months. How to do Kinyan on an heirless Ger's estate comes to mind.)</p>\n\n<p>So the question really becomes: do things in outer space have the status of Hefker or Reshut haRabim.</p>\n\n<p>As was pointed out, you may not be able to claim ownership of the sea floor, as it probably is Reshut haRabim by common agreement. Once out of territorial waters, ships seem to have a \"free route\" and nobody would want to change that.</p>\n\n<p>So, do we (sensible earthlings) want outer space to be Hefker or Reshut haRabim?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You couldn't do it halachically anyway.  Treaties signed by the major\nnations declare space as the common heritage of mankind, with ownership\nof any portion of celestial body by any nation explicitly forbidden.\nMost opinion articles seem to believe this also extends to private \nownership, that the goods created by any private party must be\nequally shared among all the people of Earth, rich and poor\nnations alike.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a citizen of a country who is signatory to these treaties,\nthen as a Jew you must obey that treaty, since that is the law\nof your land.   Therefore, sanctification of ownership in this\ninstance should be meaningless.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>To answer this question you have to understand the idea of the property on Earth. <strong>All monetary matters are subject to social approvement</strong>, in other words, \"דינא דמלכותא דינא\".</p>\n\n<p>So imagine you find an iceberg in Iceland and you'd like to privatize it - is it Halachicly yours? The only way to answer this is to ask others - It makes no sense of having a property with no humans around, think about that.</p>\n\n<p>So there is no difference in boundaries for that social approval - you might claim you own 5 square miles on Uranus, but as long as there's no existing agreement about Uranus, your claim is meaningless.</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishnah Brurah (in the Bi'ur Halachah) quotes the Pri Chadash to the statement in Rosh HaShanah 25a that this was the message that they sent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Interestingly, the Stropkover Rebbe, Rabbi Avraham Shalom Halberstam, a descendant of the Shinover Rebbe, quoted (in a speech in Los Angeles on Saturday Night, 7 Shevat, 5767) a similar Midrash (Exodus Rabbah §8) that says that when King Solomon inaugurated the First Holy Temple, he met some difficulty squeezing the Holy Ark, which was ten cubits wide into the Holy of Holies, whose entrance was also exactly ten cubits wide. In order to remedy the situation, King Solomon called upon the merit of his father, King David, so that HaShem should perform a miracle and save him from great embarrassment. He brought the coffin of his deceased father into the Holy Temple, whereupon his father, King David, arose from the dead (although, see the parallel to this Midrash at Yalkut Shimoni, Prophets, §193 which does not mention this detail).</p>\n\n<p>Based on this Midrash, Rabbi Halberstam reasoned that the decree that all humans are destined to die is specifically if one is alive, then he is supposed to die, but if one already died and has been resurrected, there is no decree that he should ever die again. Therefore, he explained that after King David arose from the dead, he was alive and furthermore, he shall continue to live because the limits of human mortality do not apply to one who already experienced death and returned from the dead.</p>\n\n<p>This explains the interpretive anomaly in the contrast between Jacob and King David, for regarding Jacob's state of living, the Talmud simply says (Taanis 5b, See Rashi to Genesis 49:33 who proves this based on the connotation of a scriptural verse), \"Jacob, our father, did not die.\" In contrast, a popular refrain declared by the Jewish Nation for many generations, as a source of inspiration through many trying times, states, \"Dovid Melech Yisrael Chai V'Kayam, meaning, \"David, king of Israel, is alive and enduring.\" (This phrase is not only found in popular songs, but is a liturgical part of many joyous occasions (such as Kiddush Levana and its grouping with the phrase Mazel Tov).) Jacob simply did not die, but King David not only remains alive, but continues to live and will never die. </p>\n\n<p>Source: I heard it myself from him, see <a href=\"http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.co.il/2007/07/completing-mitzvah.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rchaimqoton.blogspot.co.il/2007/07/completing-mitzvah.html</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As hinted at in @ba's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/22150/20472\">answer</a>, the words of this song come from an aggadah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rosh_Hashanah.25a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 25a</a>, where it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"רַבִּי חִיָּיא חַזְיֵיא לְסֵיהֲרָא דַּהֲוָה קָאֵי בְּצַפְרָא דְּעֶשְׂרִים וְתִשְׁעָה. שְׁקַל קָלָא פְּתַק בֵּיהּ, אֲמַר: לְאוּרְתָּא בָּעֵינַן לְקַדּוֹשֵׁי בָּךְ, וְאַתְּ קָיְימַתְּ הָכָא?! זִיל אִיכַּסִּי. אֲמַר לֵיהּ רַבִּי לְרַבִּי חִיָּיא: זִיל לְעֵין טָב וְקַדְּשֵׁיהּ לְיַרְחָא, <strong>וּשְׁלַח לִי סִימָנָא: ״דָּוִד מֶלֶךְ יִשְׂרָאֵל חַי וְקַיָּם</strong>״.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ḥiyya once saw the waning moon standing in the sky on the morning of the twenty-ninth of the month. He took a clump of earth and threw it at the moon, saying: This evening we need to sanctify you, i.e., the new moon must be visible tonight so that we may declare the thirtieth of the month as the New Moon, and you are still standing here? Go and cover yourself for now, so that the new moon will be seen only after nightfall. The Gemara further relates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi once said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: Go to a place called Ein Tav and sanctify the New Moon there, <strong>and send me a sign that you have sanctified it. The sign is: David, king of Israel, lives and endures.</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This phrase eventually made its way to the text of Kiddush Levanah (the sanctification of the new moon).

Therefore, it was necessary to hide the sages' attempt at sanctifying the new moon with secret passwords.

    "content": "# A Convert taking on customs of ashkanazim or sephardim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When someone converts is there any determining factor on what minhagim (customs) they will take upon themselves in terms of Ashkanazim or Sephardim? Should it be dependent on the Beis Din they converted with? May they choose to do however they please (picking one or the other.) \nR' Ovadia Yosef Shlit\"a has a Teshuva in ShuT Yachaveh Das Chelek 5 Siman 33 where he writes that someone who converts in Eretz Yisrael must take on the Minhagim of the Sephardim. Since he holds that Maran Beit Yosef the Machaber of the Shulchan Aruch is the \"Morah D'Asra\" in Eretz Yisrael and after someone converts they are considered to be like a baby that is just born. And since the person converted in Eretz Yisrael it's as if he was \"born\" in Eretz Yisael therefore he must take upon himself the minhag of the Sephardim. If there are more mareh makomos (sources) to this or savaras one way or the other please share!</p>\n\n<p>(In both situations I'm asking, someone who converts outside of Eretz Yisrael and someone who converts in Eretz Yisrael.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Speaking as a convert whose great-great-great-great-great grandfather was born a Sephardi Jew (America's first Jewish governor, David Emanuel (Georgia 1801)), one might have thought I should have adopted Sephardi practices.  The rabbi who was m'geiur me, Rabbi Bertram Leff, shlita, never accepted that.  Someone who converts is considered like a new-born child (Yevamos 22a) and, therefore, is not tied to any particular set of customs.  I followed the principal expressed in Pirkei Avos 1:6 that one should make for himself a teacher, i.e. I followed the minhagim of my rabbi, an Ashkenazi.  However, Rabbi Leff acknowledged that he had converts previously who had moved far to the right, one becoming a Hasid and a Neturei Karta member.  He said he didn't object to his students adopting chumras that he personally did not observe, but he drew the line at hatred toward the state of Israel and told the convert that had he known he would head in that direction, he never would have approved the conversion.  </p>\n\n<p>I know many converts who cherry-pick their minhagim, collecting chumra after chumra. Based on my own experience, I've always suspected that they do so because they are insecure about how they are accepted as Jewish among other Jews (after 32 years, I'm way passed that stage).  I think that they should be consistent with how their Rav holds, but my good friend, Rabbi Daniel Pollock, shlita, a rebbe at Yeshivas Madreigas Ha'adam, strongly disagrees with me. It's not the only thing we disagree about, but we're still great friends.  The point is, there really isn't a set rule on this issue and the convert has relative freedom to choose.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As every Rav will tell you, minhag is something passed along through inheritance. The minhagim originate from the unique practice of each tribe. </p>\n\n<p>For gerim (Jewish male converts) they have no obligation in regard to specific minhagim, meaning like Ashkenazi or Sephardi, etc. practice. This Halacha was decided explicitly by Moshe Rabbeinu in the case involving the Jewish woman who was married to the Egyptian convert. That convert and consequently his wife, who had been a part of one tribe, were no longer included as part of that tribe or any other tribe.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, since the land of Israel is apportioned by tribe, converts have no inheritance in the land just like Leviim and Cohanim.</p>\n\n<p>Just as Cohanim represent all of the Jewish people, so too gerim are an embodiment of this principle.</p>\n\n<p>The only minhag they follow is minhag Yisroel, which means a practice which was accepted by all Jews like for example lighting 8 candles for Channukah instead of the minimum requirement of one candle.</p>\n\n<p>Contrary to being something less, gerim do what is common to all Jews. They are a living example of the unity and oneness of the Jewish people. They may partake of any minhag if they find it meaningful but with the understanding that they are not bound and restricted by it. In the end, this mobility of the ger demonstrates the legitimacy of all the Minhagim. No traditional approach is invalid. All the Jewish people are \"kosher\".</p>\n\n<p>For a female Jewish convert, she follows the Halacha that all Jewish women follow. When she marries, she takes on the minhag of her husband. This idea is also in keeping with the decision made by Moshe Rabbeinu mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is important for male converts to chose a set minhag in order to properly fulfill several mitzvot such as wrapping tefilin, putting on talit, and performing lulav and etrog. Simply adopting \"Minhag Yisroel\" is not sufficient.</p>\n<p>While there is some freedom in choosing a minhag, it is recommended that potential converts seek guidance from a Rav. Regardless of whether they choose an Ashkenazi or Sephardi minhag, it is beneficial for the convert's identity as a Jew, their children's Jewish identities, and the Jewish identities of future generations to maintain a consistent minhag.</p>\n<p>If available it is an option in the converting community/area, I highly recommend someone converting to select a Sephardi minhag.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rama (YD 19:1) rules like the Or Zarua that <em>post facto</em> the blessing can still be said after the mitzva, but he qualifies that it must still be סמוך = adjacent to the mitzva.

One's fate is sentenced on Rosh-Hashana, for Tzadik or Rasha, or on Yon Kippur for Beinoni. That sentence applies till next year (with measured dynamics :-) ).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(including themselves)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If they're doomed for Gehenom, their own sake is to do Teshuva, which is enabled only in their lifetime.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>keeping those who are thoroughly wicked alive is not really a kindness\n  since they will eventually damage others as the gemora says \"He who is\n  merciful to the cruel is destined to be cruel to the merciful\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Off the top of my head, as Double AA and Tamir Evan indicated, he prays for the righteous. However, regarding Tamir's comment that it seems that the prayer is also for the whole place (<code>האף תספה ולא תשא למקום למען חמשים הצדיקם אשר בקרבה</code>), I'd say that the verse explicitly says that it's for the Tzadikim <code>למען חמשים הצדיקים</code>. Also, in the next verse: <code>חללה לך מעשת כדבר הזה להמית צדיק עם רשע והיה כצדיק כרשע</code>, it's again clear that the essence of the prayer is the righteous' lives.</p>\n\n<p>So, <strong>why also save the whole place?</strong> Maybe because Avraham also prays for their <strong>living-conditions</strong>. If the city gets destructed, the Tzadikim lose their house, the close-by market, their fields... Inevitably, they also suffer from the punishment. <code>אוי לרשע ואוי לשכנו</code>, woe to the wicked and woe to his neighbour. Avraham prays for the whole place so that the slightest harm won't reach the Tzadikim (the words <code>אשר בקרבה</code>, are maybe used to emphasize the strong connection between them and their city).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>i dont think one can answer: \"to give them time to repent\", because we\n  see that they were thoroughly wicked, as when they attacked Lot (all\n  of them came out, from young to old)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But that only happened after the prayer. Even Gd has decided to \"go and see with own eyes\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ארדה נא ואראה הכצעקתה הבאה אלי עשו כלה ואם לא אדעה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and Unklus translates to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אעביד עמהון גמירא אם לא תיבין ואם תיבין לא אתפרע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'll eliminate them if they don't make Teshuva but if they do I will not.</p>\n\n\n",

He extends this rule to fasting when a Torah is dropped by his own logic, and then extends it again to tefillin being dropped based on a gemara (Moed Kattan 26a) which says that if a Torah or tefillin is forcefully burnt one must rend one's clothes. As the Rosh (Moed Katan 3:64, ruled in Shulchan Aruch YD 340:37) extends the requirement of clothes-rending to even \"one parsha from Nevi'im or Ketuvim\", it would seem that the Mishpetei Shemuel's logic follows here as well.</p>\n\n\n",

He was circumcised at age 13 (2048) and Yitzchak was born 6 months later. He and Hagar were sent away in 2061 (at age 27). The Akeida was when Yitzchak was 37, in the year 2084. At this point (which leads right into Sarah's death) 50 years had passed since Avraham first married Hagar.</p>\n\n<p>Avraham (re)marries Keturah/Hagar (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10921/if-ketura-wasnt-hagar-who-was-she\">cf</a>) either in 2088 or 2096, ranging from 54 to 62 years since she (assuming Keturah was Hagar) birthed Yishmael. I don't want to assume that Hagar was married to Avraham when she was under a reasonable age (say 12) regardless of opinions that Rivkah was 3. So using the age of 12 as a minimum, Hagar would have to be between 66 and 74 years old when she started giving birth to the next 6 kids. Sarah knew that (at age 90, based on a death at 127 years old in 2084 and Yitzchak's birth about 37 years earlier) she would not conceive naturally because her cycle had stopped already.</p>\n\n<p>Unless one assumes that at that time, women continued their menses until well into their 80's (which would make the miracle of a 90 year old birth less amazing) it seems strange that Hagar would be able to conceive and carry children naturally so late in life. I can't figure out <strong>not</strong> why the Torah wouldn't ascribe any miraculous nature to the ability of a clearly post menopausal woman to give birth, but why Hagar would deserve to be the recipient of such a miracle.</p>\n\n<p>[Yes, I know I have made a few assumptions about Hagar's initial age and the time of the cessation of the menstrual cycle at that era, but if someone can give me facts and sources which show me the numbers or facts are different I'd appreciate that.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The Ramban addresses this in his commentary to <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&perek=17&mefaresh=ramban\">B'reishis 17:17</a>. He explains that miracle of Yitzchok's birth was not the age of Avraham or Sarah (as Avraham later had children from Keturah (Hagar) when he was 140). At that time, as long as people remained fertile they could still conceive children past age hundred. Rather, the miracle was in the fact that this couple who were childless for so long could bear children.</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe also addreses the question (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16077&st=&pgnum=96\">Likketey Sichos Chelek 20 pg. 81</a>) and explains that it was specifically Sarah who was barren and miraculously gave birth. Avraham (and Hagar) were never barren and thus having a child was natural.</p>\n\n\n",

This seems to indicate that it was his actual profession, since it doesn't seem likely Rashi would just be explaining the translation of his surname.</p></li>\n<li><p>It seem that the fact he is called Rebbi in the Gemora indicates that he had Semicha (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=13b&format=pdf\">see Sanhedrin 13b</a>).

    "content": "# Why does Yakov bless Ephraim and Menashe at the same time?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why does Yakov bless Ephraim and Menashe at the same time? Why not bless them one after the other?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Before answering this question from the sefer <a href=\"http://download.hebrewbooks.org/downloadhandler.ashx?req=14491\" rel=\"nofollow\">בני יששכר</a> we need to mention two more problems that the commentaries raise:</p>\n\n<p>The posuk in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0148.htm#14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishis (48,14)</a> says that although Yosef placed Menashe on Yaakov's right and Ephraim on Yaakov's left, Yaakov deliberately crossed his hands and placed his right hand on Ephraim and his left hand on Menashe. Why did he not have them switch places instead of crossing his hands?</p>\n\n<p>And the posuk says that the reason why he crossed his hands was \"because Menashe was the firstborn\". But if Menashe was the firstborn, then on the contrary he should have placed his right hand on Menashe!</p>\n\n<p>But the Bnei Yisasschar explains that each month of the Jewish year has one of the tribes associated with it, and the three months of Tishrei, Cheshvon and Kislev are associated with the tribes of Ephraim(Tishrei), Menashe(Cheshvon) and Binyamin(Kislev), the three tribes who came from Rachel.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there are altogether three Batei HaMikdash (Temples). The first was inaugurated in Tishrei the month associated with Ephraim, the second was inaugurated in Kislev the month associated with Binyamin, and third and final temple will be inaugurated in Cheshvon the month associated with Menashe. This third temple is the main temple of the three, and this is alluded to by the sign of the Zodiac which is associated with this month, the sign of the scorpion (Scorpio) which in Hebrew is called עקרב which is עקר ב, that is, the עיקר בית (the main house). </p>\n\n<p>The first temple was actually completed in Cheshvon, the month in which the inauguration of the main temple is supposed to take place, but its inauguration was pushed off until Tishrei, the month of Ephraim. This is why Yaakov placed his right hand on Ephraim, to show that first temple which is associated with Ephraim would precede the main temple that is associated with Menashe, the firstborn.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the only way all this could be alluded to in Yaakov's blessing was by blessing them together, so that by placing Menashe on his right he showed that he was more important because he was the firstborn and so the main temple was to inaugurated in his month, and at the same time by crossing his hands and placing his right hand on Ephraim he showed that the temple that was associated with Ephraim was to precede that of Menashe.</p>\n\n<p>And thus when the posuk says that he crossed his hands because Menashe was the firstborn, it means that he crossed his hands rather than have them switch places because Menashe was the firstborn and so had to be placed on Yaakov's right.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Emden firmly rejects the idea of singlehanded blessings.  He explains that Moshe and others used two.  Yaakov was but an exception as he wanted to bless both of his grandsons simultaneously because he was already changing the order and wanted to minimize, as much as possible, the differences between the two.  Further blessing the younger before the older would be an unforgivable insult.

Some learn it from the Gemara Chagiga (13b) that it is forbidden to eat a loaf of bread from which a mouse nibbled since the impurity has spread throughout, and this is all the more so when a righteous person eats from it that the purity spreads throughout (Ha-Rav Avraham Shapira explained it in this manner [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Or the Yerushalami Moed Katan (2:3) which says that after the meal celebrating the New Month, Rebbe Yohanan would collect the crumbs and eat them, saying: \"May I spend my life in the next world together with those who ate here last evening\" (Brought in Shaarim Metzuyanim Be-Halachah 42:2.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Yerushalmi is mentioned by the Munkatcher Rebbe, Rav Chaim Elazar Shapira,  in his commentary there as the source for <em>shirayim</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Sanhedrin 92a, there is some discussion on the value of giving out bread to others and leaving behind bread prior to saying the blessings after meals: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמר רבי אלעזר: כל הנותן פיתו למי שאין בו דעה - יסורין באין עליו</p>\n  \n  <p>R.

Eleazar also said: He who leaves no bread on the table [at the end of his meal] will never see a sign of blessing</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shmuel Barzilai asserts that the custom of <em>shirayim</em> during a Shabbat <em>tisch</em> [chassidic gathering with a rebbe] comes from this gemara. In his work, <em>Chassidic Ecstasy in Music</em>,  he records the custom and the spiritual significance of it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Sages also said: \"Whoever does not partake of bread at his [the Tzaddik's] table has never seen a blessing in his lifetime.\" The Chassidim receive the Tzaddik's <em>shirayim</em> and what is left of the meal is shared among them, as the Tzaddik's act of eating is altruistic, and the Chassidim would almost give up their souls to receive <em>shirayim</em> from the Tzaddik's hands.  </p>\n  \n  <p>The Kabbalah endows mystical importance to these <em>shirayim</em>, as food contains \"elevation of the sparks.\" The Besht said: </p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>Why did the Holy One, Blessed be He, create man with the ability to become hungry and thirsty when He could have created a man able to live without food or drink? For it is said, 'their souls fainted in them' [Ps. 107:5]? Therefore, G-d made man hungry for food and thirsty for drink, in order for him to uplift the sparks, that is, the souls that have fainted in [becoming] the food, which is the meaning of 'their souls have fainted in them'.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>The Chassidim viewed the <em>shirayim</em> as a meritorious 'charm' for filling them with heavenly awe, livelihood and good health. In some courts of Tzaddikim, a second table was set as soon as the first was complete. The second 'round' offered various delicacies in honor of the Shabbat. At this second setting, the Tzaddik would discuss issues with his Chassidim and relate Chassidic tales. The sense was one of \"brethren sitting together\" [Ps. 133:1]. This second setting was usually lengthy, lasting until well into the night, and was one of the most beautiful periods of the whole Shabbat. (Barzilai 89)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For an alternative, simpler explanation, Steven Bayme argues that the origin of <em>shirayim</em> developed from the belief that a tzaddik could perform wonders, so picking up his crumbs could \"provide physical closeness and connection to the rebbe\" (<em>Understanding Jewish History</em> 248). Similarly, in his <em>Hakira</em> article \"Hasidism and the Rebbe/Tzaddik: The Power and Peril of Charismatic Leadership,\" Elijah Judah Schochet writes that: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hasidim believed that\n  such edibles contain magical power as they had been touched and\n  sanctified by the Rebbe/Tzaddik. <em>Shirayim</em> were believed to be a <em>segula</em>\n  for the ill, and the verse “He will bless your bread” [Ex. 23:25] was interpreted\n  to mean that as a result of eating sanctified food “I (G-d) will remove\n  all disease from your midst.” [cf. Kalonymous Kalman HaLevi Epstein, <em>Meor va’Shemesh</em>,  “Mishpatim.”]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And then there are other explanations for the custom, <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.co.il/2008/08/shirayim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">summarized by R. Ari Enkin</a> and noted by user2083.  I'm not familiar with the first recorded source of the custom, but regarding the reason for its performance on Shabbat and holidays, it is likely due to the fact that rebbes were particularly accessible to their chassidim during this time. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The practice was passed on via an un-named Jewish Town-Proprietor who passed the practice onto the Besht. The Proprietor told the Besht that the meal is to see-out the sabbath Neshamah (a kind of death) among one's people Israel. Although the Proprietor's name is not mentioned, the practice originated with the medieval Ashkenazi Hassidim expression of the Hitveadut for the Seudah Shlishit of the Sabbath and Yom Tov. The Kos Shel Bracha following such meals was combined with Havdalah a practice whose order is the subject of debate between Shammai (Candles, Birkat HaMazon, Besamim, Havdalah) and Hillel (Candles, Besamim, Birkat HaMazon, Havdalah). The Shirayim of such meals was usually breadcrumbs which were put into the Kos shel Brakha with warm water as discussed in the Shulchan Arukh. As long as the tzadik who ate the meal had eaten a KeZayit piece of the bread, they could say Birkat HaMazon while the rest of the bread could be broken up into crumbs up to but not equal to the size of an olive and distributed to the haverim with the Kos Shel Bracha wine and covered by Al HaMichya. Distributing one's shirayim is a kind of tzedakah as a positive mitzvah from Devarim 24:19 and Leviim 23:32. In 17th century Eastern Europe, the Shirayim was so commonly Kugel (particularly Lokshen Kugel) that Kugel became an alternative name for Shirayim in many Hassidic circles and Xians in Poland were prohibited from eating it. Thus we see references to Lokshen Kugel (by which we understand Shirayim) being ordained at Mount Sinai. The transfer of the Tish from Seudah Shlishit to Erev Shabbat was a 19th century innovation. </p>\n\n\n",

That is, if someone lit Shabbos candles Erev Shabbos Parshas Chayeh Sarah (for example) and they stayed lit until Erev Shabbos Parshas Toldos and would easily burn well into the night, is this enough? Or must new candles be lit in honor of this Shabbos?  The main reasons for Shabbos candles is for Shalom Bayis — in order that one may see around the house — as well the enjoyment one has by eating by the candles. Seemingly these two things are fulfilled with the candles that remained lit from the previous Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The reason why candles that were lit for the previous night of Chanuka must be extinguished and re-lit is, (as Shulchan Aruch OC 675 explains) because \"hadloka oseh mitzvah\". That is, the mitzvah of Chanuka candles is not the fact that they are lit, but rather the actual act of lighting. The Gemora (Shabbos 23a) derives this from the fact that the brocha we make on lighting Chanuka candles is \"lehadlik ner shel chanuka\" - to (actively) light the candles of Chanuka. Many poskim learn from this that similarly by Shabbos candles, where we say the brocha \"lehadlik\" we apply the principle of \"hadlaka oseh mitzvah\" (see Ravyah Chelek 1 Siman 199, Birkey Yosef 675:2, Pri Megadim M\"Z 675:1, Mishna Berura 675:1 and 263:48 and more). Thus it would seem that according to them, candles lit for the previous Shabbos would not count for the mitzvah of the comming Shabbos. However, some do argue with this (for example see Taz 675:1 and Pnei Yehoshua to Shabbos 23a) and do not extend the principle of \"hadloka oseh mitzvah\" to Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think the Gemara indicates that it would not be proper to light Shabbos candles in such a fashion.

    "title": "How is knowledge of G-d different from any other knowledge?",
    "content": "# How is knowledge of G-d different from any other knowledge?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam, in his Morei Nevuchim, says that when it comes to knowledge about G-d, we can only know what G-d is <em>not</em>. I.e. He is not limited in space, or time, He does not have property A, nor does he have property \"not A\". We can have no positive knowledge of G-d's essence. </p>\n\n<p>Of course this poses an obvious question that statements like \"G-d is not A\" or \"it is not true that G-d is A\" are themselves some forms of positive knowledge about G-d. But that's not my question here.</p>\n\n<p>My question is - given the above restriction, how can we then ever know about or relate to G-d, and in particular how are we to understand statements like \"G-d is Just\" or even \"G-d Created heaven and earth\". It seems that the these statements are to be given meaning only in terms of observable effects by humans or by an analogy. For example, \"G-d is Just\" means that G-d's actions are seen to be 'just', as humans define that term. Or that \"G-d created heaven and earth\" means that the appearance of the physical reality bears some resemblance, via an analogy (or some sort of isomorphism?), to an act of creation as defined in common usage by man.</p>\n\n<p>But even an analogy or even some conception connecting what is physically observed to G-d, also represents some <em>knowledge</em> of G-d. Namely, it is some sort of model inside one's mind, that links the concept of G-d to normal everyday concepts or structures such as \"creating\", \"justice\", etc. If we are able to have these models in our heads, then how is this knowledge qualitatively any different from knowing G-d's essence? For in truth, even for regular things (cars, rocks, humans, numbers, etc.) we do not know truly know their 'essence' - we speak only in terms of abstractions, models of these concepts that we have in our minds, and theories that allow us to link our models to observable reality. If so, how is that any different then from knowing G-d in the sense described above? If the knowledge about a computer, say, consists of various abstractions in our head about the mechanisms of how its inputs get transformed to outputs, then how is that knowledge different (qualitatively) from the various abstractions and models that we have in our minds about G-d (both with observable effects or not)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rambam himself deals with these issues toward the end of Part One of the Guide. In <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp063.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1:53</a> he writes (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many of the attributes express different <strong>acts</strong> of God, but <strong>that\n  difference does not necessitate any difference as regards Him from\n  whom the acts proceed</strong>. This fact, that from one agency different\n  effects may result, although that agency has not free will, and much\n  more so if it has free will, I will illustrate by an instance taken\n  from our own sphere:</p>\n  \n  <p>Fire melts certain things and makes others hard, it boils and burns,\n  it bleaches and blackens. If we described the fire as bleaching,\n  blackening, burning, boiling, hardening and melting, we should be\n  correct, and yet he who does not know the nature of fire, would think\n  that it included six different elements, one by which it blackens,\n  another by which it bleaches, a third by which it boils, a fourth by\n  which it consumes, a fifth by which it melts, a sixth by which it\n  hardens things--actions which are opposed to one another, and of which\n  each has its peculiar property. He, however, who knows the nature of\n  fire, will know that by virtue of one quality in action, namely, by\n  heat, it produces all these effects.</p>\n  \n  <p>If this is the case with that which is done by nature, how much more\n  is it the case with regard to beings that act by free will, and still\n  more with regard to God, who is above all description. If we,\n  therefore, perceive in God certain relations of various kinds--for\n  wisdom in us is different from power, and power from will--<strong>it does\n  by no means follow that different elements are really contained in\n  Him</strong>, that He contains one element by which He knows, another by\n  which He wills, and another by which He exercises power, as is, in\n  fact, the signification of the attributes of God] according to the\n  Attributists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding is that whenever the Torah says that God <em>is</em> something, it really means that God is acting in a way that if he were subject to our comprehension, he would be that thing. The Torah simply \"speaks the language of man\" in this way, according to the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The main difference of perception, IMHO, regarding \"what a computer is\" and \"What G-d is\" stems from the observations that a computer's behaviour is deterministic. e.g. for the same input it will always emit the same output.</p>\n\n<p>Our understanding of G-s is that it is \"nondeterministic in nature\" - e.g. everything that is deterministic is, by definition, not-G-d (from similar reasons to those the Rambam states about why anything that's compound can't be G-d).</p>\n\n<p>So a better analogy would be to think of G-d as a non-deterministic model, or at least mathematically chaotic entity. E.g. any model you might have in your mind as of what G-d is would never allow you to predict G-d's \"doings\".</p>\n\n\n",

However from M\"B Sif-Katan 10 we see that if there is a possibility to take out the rock itself then that should be done.

I think this can be illustrated by imagining the situation. If you were to picture a bowl of Apples and Oranges mixed together, you have a mixture. A stone on the bottom of a basket, is a stone in a bottom of a basket. Perhaps even in a situation where the stone is \"in\" the apples it could be small enough that it would/could settle to the bottom on its own, which would also exclude it from the category of a mixture (see Shemiras Shabbos K'Hilchasa 3:6).</p>\n\n\n",

Just take a look at the retribution God exacted for the killing of Zecharyah, a Cohen Venovi.

This is where each god was thought to live - its altar.  A very common decoration under the god was a gold bull or calf.</p>\n\n<p>Although we wanted to worship an idol and were creating the calf to that end, Aaron had a different idea in mind.  He wanted to create a throne for G-d.  He said, \"אֵלֶּה אֱלֹקיךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל\" \"This is your G-d, Israel,\" and gestured not to the calf, but to the space <em>above the calf</em>.  Aaron knew G-d's true nature and was trying to use symbolism the Israelites would understand.  But unfortunately, they failed to understand it and treated the calf as an god itself.</p>\n\n<p>After some Googling, it seems this idea is advanced by Michael Coogan in <em>A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context</em>.  From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_calf#Criticism_and_interpretation\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of [G-d].

He argues that Aaron was actually trying to prevent the idolatry, and did everything in his power to delay it as much as possible, hoping that Moses would return in the interim and sort things out. Here is the <a href=\"https://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/32.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ESV translation</a> of the relevant passage in Chapter 32:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1 When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the\n  mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron and said to\n  him, \"Up, make us gods who shall go before us. As for this Moses, the\n  man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what\n  has become of him.\" 2 So Aaron said to them, \"Take off the rings of\n  gold that are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your\n  daughters, and bring them to me.\" 3 So all the people took off the\n  rings of gold that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. 4 And\n  he received the gold from their hand and fashioned it with a graving\n  tool and made a golden calf. And they said, \"These are your gods, O\n  Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!\" 5 When Aaron saw\n  this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made proclamation and\n  said, \"Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.\" 6 And they rose up\n  early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace\n  offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to\n  play.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, Gersonides argues that first Aaron told them to get the jewelry from their wives and children, knowing that this would take a while as the women and children would be very hesitant to give up their jewelry. When Moses still hadn't returned, Aaron dragged out the process further by \"fashion[ing] it with a graving tool\". When Aaron then saw that Moses had still not returned and the people had begun referring to the calf as \"gods\", he delayed further by building an altar. When this was still not enough he delayed again by saying \"Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.\" But the next morning the people arose and brought offerings and there was nothing more that Aaron could do.</p>\n\n<p>Gersonides argues further that Aaron could not have objected outright to the idea because then the people would have simply killed him and there would be nothing left to temper their idolatry. If Aaron remains alive he at least has the ability to be undercover and try to minimize the great sin that was to take place.</p>\n\n\n",

(I am not asking here what happens if I was asked to duchan when I was davenning in his shul.)</p>\n\n<p>If you say CYLOR, the Rav of my old shul said that I should not go to duchan. The Rav of my present shul is well known to allow it.</p>\n\n<p>So I am really looking for sources please.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>I posed this question today to HaRav Shammai Gross Shlit\"a. He is one of the Gedolei HaPoskim here in Eretz Yisrael (and happens to be a Cohen as well.) He said while there were poskim that said once the Ashkanazi Kohen is in a Sephardi minyan in chutz l'aretz that does duchen that he may join them. Still one shouldn't lichatchila go to such a shul in order to duchen -- the main reason that it is not the minhag of the Ashakanazim to make Bircas Cohanim the whole year.</p>\n\n<p>He didn't give a particular makor or proof for this aside from the fact that this is not the minhag of the Ashkanazim. I still felt it important to post this answer as he is from the Gedolei HaPoskim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>When a Koehein is called to duchan (\"Kohanim!\"), there is a mitzvah d'oraysa for him to go up and say the blessings. For somewhat unclear reasons, this practice was abandoned among Ashkenazi Jewry except for on yomim tovim. This means that Kohanim are missing the opportunity to fullfil the mitzvah, but they are not going against the mitzvah as long as they haven't been called. If a Kohein is in a shul where they still duchan, he definitely must go also. </p>\n\n<p>With regards to purposely going to such a shul, it seems like a good idea, since that way you can fullfil the mitzvah. The Gr\"a and R' Chayim Volozhiner tried to re-establish Birkas Kohanim, but did not succeed in Europe. (Talmidim of the Gr\"a were able to duchan in Israel, where there was no Minhag not to.) So I would assume they would approve of going to a shul that does fullfil that mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Reb Sholem Schwadron ZaTza\"l went especially for this to Sfaradic shuls when he was outside of Eretz Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

This is based on two factors: 1. It is a case of a life-threatening situation.  2. Walking in the middle of the Shemoneh Esrei without speaking is not considered an interruption.  For example, if I am Davening the Shemoneh Esrei and a child is bothering me to the point that I cannot concentrate, I can move to another place.  Or if I am Davening by heart and I cannot remember \"Ya'ale Ve-Yavo,\" I can go and get a Siddur.  Speaking is forbidden, but there is no problem of moving if there is a need (Mishnah Berurah 104:2).  Therefore, if I am in the middle of the Shemoneh Esrei and I hear a warning siren for an incoming missile, I should go to the bomb shelter without talking and continue to Daven where I left off (Piskei Teshuvot, Orach Chaim 104.

But just in case not everyone agrees, I will offer another. You state in your comment that  there are many ma'amarei chazal which state that Avraham was the first person to circumcise himself. This leads you to the presumption that Terach did not have a bris at all. </p>\n\n<p>However see Rashi on 15:15 from Bereshis Rabbah 30:4 that Terach did Teshuva toward the end of his life. In that case it is very probable that he also had a bris done afterwards. His death was long after Avrahams own Milah. (205[Terach died] - 70[Terach at Avraham birth] = 135).</p>\n\n<p>It has just occurred to me that I am not sure why Terach was in Hell seeing as he had done Teshuva but I suspect that is a contradiction not based on my answer. Perhaps I'l ask it separately. </p>\n\n\n",

I know that many people do eat turkey, myself included. What are the two sides of this dispute? Is there really no Mesorah, then how come many people eat it? If there is one then what is the reason that some people do not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>We <strong>do</strong> have a masorah on turkey. That <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/buffalo/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">is</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bechorot 7a declares that kosher and non-kosher species cannot cross-breed. Thus, if two species can hybridize, and one is known to be kosher it is proof positive that the other is kosher as well. This is cited (Rambam, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&hilchos=28&perek=1&halocha=13&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ma'achalot Assurot 1:13</a>) as an halachikally valid means of distinguishing between kosher and non-kosher animals, and should obviate any need for a mesorah, when it can be applied.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I've seen this presented as a masorah of sorts. Namely, we have a masorah on chickens. And we have the talmudic statement. Therefore, the masorah extends to every animal which cross-breeds with chickens.</p>\n<p>Turkeys can successfully cross-breed with chickens. <a href=\"http://www.messybeast.com/genetics/hybrid-birds.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Thus</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MW Olsen, US Dept of Agriculture, successfully bred turkey x chicken hybrids from Beltsville Small White turkey hens artificially inseminated with semen from Dark Cornish male chickens. Morphological evidence of the hybrid status of the birds (Olsen, M. W., J. Heredity, 51, 69 (1960)) included the fact that the adult hybrids' dark plumage resembled that of the chicken, being dominant over the recessive white colour of the turkeys. Serological studies on their red cells also provided evidence of the birds being hybrids.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>, based on Double AA's comment, as to whether <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/ThreeBirds/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this encompasses birds</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Up to this point the universally agreed upon need for a mesorah in order to deem a bird species kosher has been discussed. However, there may be a way around this requirement. The Talmud (Bechorot 7a) mentions a rule known as the \"hybridization principle.\" This principle states that kosher species cannot mate with non-kosher species; hence, the fact that a suspect species can interbreed with a known kosher species confirms the kosher status of the unknown species. In the Talmud it is not explicitly stated if this principle applies only to animals or to birds as well. Many authorities have been willing to rely on the hybridization principle to rule that a bird species is kosher even in the absence of a mesorah. Among them are: Chatam Sofer (Yoreh De'ah 7436 ); Avnei Nezer (Yoreh De'ah 1:75:19-2137 ); Maharsham, (Da'at Torah , Yoreh De'ah 82:338 ); Rav Shmuel Schneerson,39 and Chesed L'Avraham (Tinyana, YD:22-2440 ). All of these authorities seem to view the hybridization principle as a rule separating two disjoined sets. In other words, they are not necessarily subsuming the new species under the mesorah of the known bird. Rather, the known bird is serving to prove that the new species is a member of the set of kosher birds.41</p>\n<p>There is a second group of authorities who are willing to accept a weaker form of the hybridization principle.42 Within this group, some accept the stronger form in theory but are unwilling to apply it in practice while others are altogether unsure if it applies to birds. However, they all accept a weaker statement that states that if the unknown species freely chooses to mate with a known kosher species when offered the choice of either its own species or the other species, that is a sufficient indicator to subsume the new unknown species under the mesorah of the known kosher species. This group includes the Netziv (Meshiv Davar , Yoreh De'ah , section 2, 22)43 and Arugat Habosem (Kuntrus Ha'tshuvot , related to siman 82, p. 342-34344 ).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Here's a clear explanation of the Heter side:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Arugot Habosem (Rabbi Aryeh Lebush Bolchiver, author of Shem Aryeh, Russia, published 1870; kuntras ha'tshuvot in the back, siman 16) very neatly presents the quandary: Birds require a tradition to be kosher and turkey (indik) is a bird that comes from America, a place that was not discovered until the year 5254 (1494) and so no tradition is possible. 55 Yet, he notes, all Jews, except for one well-known family in Russia, the Frankels, eat it. He therefore reaches the very important conclusion that when the Ramo requires a tradition, it is only when there is uncertainty about the bird's dores status. He posits that if a bird is no longer \"new\" but has been observed for a long period of time, i.e. 12 months, and observed to be non-dores it is possible to say with certainty that it is not a dores. Furthermore, he rejects the Avnei Nezer's (YD 1:76:13-14) contention that domestication and living among \"friends\" may be the reason for the non-dores behavior. Arugot Habosem therefore posits that even according to Rashi and the Ramo, a bird, like the turkey, that is raised in thousands of houses for hundreds of years and is clearly not a dores does not require a mesorah if it also has the three other indicia of a kosher bird; which the turkey does. 56</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Taken from <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/articles/turk_part5/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It's pretty clearly widely accepted, but note that there are still those, today, even in what is considered the Modern Orthodox circle, who don't eat turkey.  One prominent example reported to follow this (although I cannot locate a source online at the moment) is R' Hershel Schachter of Yeshiva University, who is one of the Poskim for the Orthodox Union.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong><br>\nI have confirmed with a family member of R' Schachter's that he does not eat turkey because of a lack of Mesorah, but I didn't want to pry and ask if that's his official Pesak when others ask him, since I could just ask him myself but don't feel compelled to.  The article linked above, however, cites <em>Nefesh HaRav</em>, written by R' Schachter, and quotes R' YB Soloveitchik as permitting turkey.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Michael Broyde (in the article \"Is Thanksgiving Kosher?\" <a href=\"http://www.tfdixie.com/special/thanksg.htm#N_15_\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">footnote 15</a>), the question of the permissibility of eating turkey was complicated because there were two birds referred to by the same name. For what is now called a turkey, he quotes Rabbi Shlomoh Kluger who forbids it, and Divrei Chayim, Igros HaBosem (probably the author of Arugas HaBosem quoted in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/22317/1569\">Seth J's answer</a>) and Maharam Shik who permit it. He also references Darkei Tshuvah on both sides. He concludes that the practice in America is to eat it.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rasha does not ask, so we do not judge him favorably. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>While many answers have been suggested to this question over the years, a simple answer may be that the question is based on textual variants.</p>\n\n<h2>The Text of the Haggada</h2>\n\n<p>The question is premised on the fact that the text that we have for the wise son's question uses the word אתכם while the text that we have for  the wicked son's question uses the word לכם. If both sons used the term \"you\" instead of \"us\", why do we only castigate the wicked son and not the wise son? Now while in most texts today this is indeed how the questions appear, this was not always the case. Many old editions of the Haggada (see one of many examples <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=10582&st=&pgnum=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) have the text of the wise son's question as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה העדות והחוקים והמשפטים אשר צוה ה' אלהינו אותנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is to say that the word אתכם (you) is replaced with אותנו (us). With this text there is no question; the difference between the wise son and the wicked son is clear – the wicked son excluded himself with the word אתכם while the wise son included himself with the word אותנו.</p>\n\n<h2>Rambam</h2>\n\n<p>At the end of Hilchot Chametz U'matza, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> provides his version of the Haggada. While the standard text that we have now has the word אתכם in the wise son's question, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabsai_Frankel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frankel</a> edition notes the existence of editions with the word אותנו:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אתכם.</strong> בעץ חיים ובכמה דפו\"י אותנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Other Sources in Rabbinic Literature</h2>\n\n<p>The discussion of the four sons appears in external sources (i.e. not the Haggada) as well. In the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhilta_of_Rabbi_Ishmael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechilta D'Rabbi Yishmael</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40607&st=&pgnum=76\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshah 18</a>) the text of the wise son's question reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חכם מה הוא אומר מה העדות והחוקים והמשפטים אשר צוה ה' אלהינו אותנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this version, the wise son did not exclude himself, as he in fact asked about the laws that God commanded <em>us</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The text of the wise son's question in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem_Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Yerushalmi</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14141&st=&pgnum=519\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 10:4</a>) reads similarly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בן חכם מהו אומר מה העדות והחקים והמשפטים אשר צוה ה' אלהינו אותנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in the version recorded in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_ben_Solomon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Sechel Tov</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobiah_ben_Eliezer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Lekach Tov</a>, only the wicked son's question is actually quoted. They don't quote the wise son's question at all. And they have an additional detail not found in the Haggada nor in the Yerushalmi or Mechilta, namely, that they spell out that the problem with the wicked son's question is precisely that he did not use the word לנו.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33212&st=&pgnum=155&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Sechel Tov Exodus 13:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עשה ה' לי. למה נאמר לפי שהוא אומר בבן רשע מה העבודה הזאת לכם <strong>ולפי\n  שהוציא את עצמו מן הכלל שלא אמר לנו</strong> בידוע שכפר בעיקר אף אתה הוציאהו\n  מן הכלל ואומר לו בעבור זה עשה ה' לי ולא לך שאילו הייתה לשם לא הייתה\n  נגאל פי' אלא כבר היית מת בשלשת ימי אפילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14141&st=&pgnum=519\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Lekach Tov Exodus 13:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רשע מה הוא אומר מה העבודה הזאת לכם כלומר לכם ולא לו <strong>ולפי שהוציא את\n  עצמו מן הכלל שלא אמר לנו אלא לכם</strong> בידוע שכפר בעיקר לכך נאמר בעבור זה\n  עשה ה' לי כלומר לי ולא לו שאלו היה שם לא היה נגאל אלא היה מת בשלשת ימי\n  אפלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this version, almost all the other suggested answers are eliminated, as they rely on using some other aspect of the wicked son's question to explain why it is problematic, yet here we are specifically told that the problematic aspect is his failure to include himself. Thus, virtually the only way to explain why we are okay with the wise son's question would be to say that he did not in fact say אתכם.</p>\n\n<h2>The Scriptural Source</h2>\n\n<p>While to resolve the discrepancy between the way we treat the wise and wicked sons we can suggest that the correct version of the wise son's question did not contain the word אתכם, (rather it has אותנו) it leaves us with a very basic problem. The questions of the four sons are derived from Scripture. The question of the wise son is taken from Deuteronomy 6:20 which reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי יִשְׁאָלְךָ בִנְךָ מָחָר לֵאמֹר מָה הָעֵדֹת וְהַחֻקִּים\n  וְהַמִּשְׁפָּטִים אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ אֶתְכֶם</p>\n  \n  <p>When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying: 'What mean the\n  testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which the LORD our\n  God hath commanded you? (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0506.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechon Mamre translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we see clearly in the Scriptural verse, the question of the wise son does in fact contain the word אתכם. How does this square with all the sources that have the word אותנו?</p>\n\n<h2>The Penei Moshe</h2>\n\n<p>This problem is dealt with by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Margolies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moshe Margoliot</a> in his commentary (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14141&st=&pgnum=519\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Penei Moshe</a>) to the passage in the Talmud Yerushalmi. He suggests that although the text in the Torah has the word אתכם, the wise son deliberately changed it and used the word אותנו precisely to avoid excluding himself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובכתוב נאמר אשר צוה ה' אלהינו אתכם אלא שהחכם ניכר בשאלתו ואינו רוצה\n  לומר אתכם ואומר אותנו שלא להוציא עצמו מן הכלל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this, the wise son is indeed distinguished from the wicked son, and we do not reject him <em>precisely because</em> he included himself by saying אותנו.</p>\n\n<h2>The Septuagint and Vulgate</h2>\n\n<p>We can actually go one step further than R. Margoliot's answer. If we look at the ancient Greek and Latin translations of the Torah, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Septuagint</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vulgate</a>, we find that they translate the last word of Deuteronomy 6:20 as \"us\" and not \"you\". This might indicate that there was even a version of the Torah that had the word as אותנו in the wise son's question.</p>\n\n<p>Septuagint:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>καὶ ἔσται ὅταν ἐρωτήσῃ σε ὁ υἱός σου αὔριον λέγων τί ἐστιν τὰ μαρτύρια\n  καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο κύριος ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν\n  ἡμῖν</em></p>\n  \n  <p>And it shall come to pass when thy son shall ask thee at a future\n  time, saying, What are the testimonies, and the ordinances, and the\n  judgments, which the Lord our God has commanded <strong>us</strong>? (<a href=\"https://www.biblestudytools.com/lxx/deuteronomy/6.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brenton\n  translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Vulgate:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>cum interrogaverit te filius tuus cras dicens quid sibi volunt testimonia haec et caerimoniae atque iudicia quae praecepit Dominus\n  Deus noster nobis</em></p>\n  \n  <p>And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow, saying: What mean these\n  testimonies, and ceremonies and judgments, which the Lord our God hath\n  commanded <strong>us</strong>? (<a href=\"http://vulgate.org/ot/deuteronomy_6.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is particularly noteworthy because (some versions of) the Mechilta cited above did not just have the word אותנו in the wise son's question; it also has the word אותנו in the quotation of the verse at the beginning of the exposition, perhaps again indicating the existence of a variant text in the Torah.\nIf even the text of the Torah itself said אותנו by the wise son, the question would surely fall by the wayside.</p>\n\n<h1>Reverse Explanation</h1>\n\n<p>Interestingly, Rabbi Dr. Professor <a href=\"https://www.ozny.org/about-our-rabbi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Allen Schwartz</a> noted the fact that the other sources (Mechilta, Yerushalmi, and Septuagint) have the word as אותנו, but he explained it in reverse. He suggested that this is further evidence of the earliness of the Haggada, and that in fact the Mechilta, Yerushalmi, and Septuagint were all influenced by the Haggada. That is to say, that all three of these other sources deliberately changed the text from how it was in the Haggada (replacing אתכם with אותנו) precisely to avoid the question of how we differentiate the wise son from the wicked son. (This is in fact similar to the answer given by R. Margoliot mentioned above.) This suggestion, as well as his broader discussion of this question, can be found in <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/897955/rabbi-allen-schwartz/the-four-sons/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this lecture</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

A couple of years ago I got Mashechet Bava Kamma from the Shas Vilna Hachadash published by Mesoret HaSHas and Z. Berman. I honestly, have not delved too much into it and I am not enough of a sholar to be able to tell the difference. Nonetheless, before I begin to build up my entire set with this publisher I was wondering what are the merits of other Hebrew versions of Shas. The ones I know of are Oz V'hadar, Shas Vilna Hachadash, and the Hebrew Steinsaltz version with the Vilna page layout.</p>\n\n<p>What are the merits of these versions. Do any of them employ heavy revisionism, reflect academic or haredi hashkafot, etc...? I would love to get a handle on what's available on the market so that I can build a set that I am satisfied with as I learn more.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I do not have a single edition to recommend, but here are some things to look for when choosing a Shas. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My credentials: I use a huge 35-year old \"yellow\" Greenwald edition of\n  the Shas daily in my Daf Yomi shiur, a tiny Oz Vehadar to prepare on\n  the bus (5 days a week) and whatever is available in the various shuls\n  that I learn in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Pesukim - Verses</strong></p>\n\n<p>The advantage of the \"old\" layout is the ability to see at a glance where a verse came from. The narrow margin around the gemara had that information.</p>\n\n<p>In the newer versions you have to follow a tiny letter (usually one of 3 or 4 in different fonts) to some random location on the page. This location usually changes from page to page, making it difficult to \"glance\" at a reference.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of the newer layout is that you get to see the entire verse; having it in context often helps one understand the Gemara. Sometimes the portion of the verse being discussed is actually missing from the actual text of the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>So ideally you'd want to find a version that has inline references (in the tiny margin between the Gemara and Rashi/Tos.) as well as the full Pasuk. IIRC there used to be a \"red\" version that had this.</p>\n\n<p>You want to ensure that each \"marginal section\" has a distinct \"referring\" font, otherwise you'll become frustrated deciphering which section to go to for which letter. Some version even use digits for the Pesukim, making it distinct, hence easier.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cross references</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the older layouts you can see at a glance to the margin where the related Gemarot are. Knowing where the issue is discussed elsewhere often provides a clue to the context.</p>\n\n<p>In the newer layouts this is also hidden behind a letter referencing a random spot on the page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternate Girsaot and tiny remarks</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the older versions the margin is splattered with alternate versions of the text as well as some comments.</p>\n\n<p>In the newer ones they are also hidden behind a letter, often making one unaware of their existence. Some of the newer version have at least highlighted the word(s) that matters, in the random spot on the margin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commentators at the back</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some of the newer versions have taken the dozens of Meforshim at the back of each Masechta, and made them into a compendium. This saves a lot of time.</p>\n\n<p>However, some of the Meforshim have disappeared; potentially being lost \"forever\".</p>\n\n<p>Also, some of the newer versions have not redone (all) the the meforshim at the back - and some of them will still be hard to read.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi's French</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some - but not all - of the newer version have a translation of Rashi's foreign words on the page. This is very useful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi elsewhere</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some of the never versions have added to the page Rashi's comments elsewhere on related topics. This can be very useful. Others have out this at the back, leaving more room on the page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Margins</strong></p>\n\n<p>The older layout has a lot of room in the margin to add your own notes. In some of the newer version, every spare millimeter is occupied.</p>\n\n<p><strong>עין משפט השלם</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many years ago there was the \"red\" set that printed the full version of the referenced Rambams on the page.</p>\n\n<p>Some versions may have this in the back, nowadays.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tiny letters</strong></p>\n\n<p>Make sure all the tiny letters are readable. Some printers have fonts that are easier to read than others. Also check the last few volumes; many of the Kodshim volumes have smaller fonts in the original Vilna Shas, (more words on each page) and the newer editions may have trouble with that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>E&OE</strong></p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that newer version can also potentially introduce new errors. I have found that the new Mishnayot (Zecher Hannoch) and the new Chumashim have their own collection of typos they introduced.</p>\n\n<p><strong>All the meforshim</strong></p>\n\n<p>30 years ago they started printing huge volumes where each Masechta included \"all\" the Rishonim and popular Achronim.</p>\n\n<p>At the time we were learning Bava Basra with the Rosh Yeshiva, Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach זצ\"ל.

    "content": "# Milk of a woman -- Only for a sick person or even healthy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In says in Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah Siman 81 SIf 7 that it's <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/591\">muter</a> to drink chalav isha (the milk of a Woman) as long as it's \"pirush\" from the body (i.e. it was already extracted and now inside of a vessel). However for a gadol (adult) to nurse from a woman is like nursing from a \"sheretz\" (a creepy crawler) and is <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/591\">ossur</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Seemingly many poskim understand this as being muter even lichatchila (see Shach Sif-Katan 17 and what the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9081&st=&pgnum=73\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Caf HaChaim brings in Siman 81 Sif-Katan 47</a>).\nHowever the Pri Megadim in Sifsei Das Sif-Katan 17 seems to say that it's muter only for a choleh (sick person -- even a choleh shain bo sacana -- one that is not in a dangerous situation in terms of their health).\nHis wording is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עש״ך ר״ל אפילו חולה שא״ב סכנה ומיהו מההיא דלקמן סי׳ פ״ז ס״ד אין מוכח\n  דשם אסור לבשל בלא אכילה משום מ״ע</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We have now many poskim that seem to hold that it's muter lichatchila, and the Pri Megadim that seems to be saying it's muter only for a choleh. Although I can't say with a certainty what the halacha is l'maseh, the majority of the poskim hold it's muter lichatchila. However what is the reasoning behind both sides? Especially that of the Pri Megadim that it's muter only for a choleh.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The reasoning for the opinion that mother's milk is permitted even to a healthy would be because the Torah specifically tells us it is permitted (see Kesuvos 60a), and only directly from the women is forbidden because of \"yonek sheketz\".</p>\n\n<p>With regards to the other opinion - The Tziyunim Vehago'os on Pri Megadim in the Machon Yerushalayim edition point out that the Pri Megadim is difficult to understand, because from the Shach it seems quite clear that mother's milk is mutar l'chatchila even to a healthy person. They quote the Meged Shamayim who writes after the words of the Pri Megadim \"אפילו לחולה שא\"ב סכנה <strong>א\"צ</strong>\". [I think that stands for \"אין צריך\", as in him questioning why the Pri Megadim wrote]. They also point to Darkey Teshuva Ois 77, though I could not understand what he adds there.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Pri Megadim does seem quite difficult to understand. Especially since really he's not arguing with the Shach but rather trying to say that this is how the understand the Shach since he says the words \"Rotzeh l'omar\" (ר\"ל)</p>\n\n<p>I saw however an interesting thing. I don't know if this is an answer to explain the Pri Megadim but could be this is a start. The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9081&st=&pgnum=110\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caf HaChaim in YD Siman 87 Sif-Katan 29</a> when discussing the inyun of maris ayin and cooking chalav isha with baser he writes at the end that everything he wrote is l'inyan dina and that in our times chalav that comes from a person is \"disgusting\" (\"mius\") and that there would be an issur of bal tishkatzu (one is not allowed to make themselves \"disgusting\" by eating such things.) Perhaps because of this the Pri Megadim felt the need to write that it's only muter for a sick person (however even a sick person that is not in danger.) Although I don't believe this is a complete answer it's something to think about and could be a way to explain Pri Megadim. It would be important to see if the Caf HaChaim has an earlier makor or if he is saying this from himself.</p>\n\n\n",

However, in <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%91%D7%90_%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%9B%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra, 21:a</a>, it <em>is</em> related:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאמר רב יהודה אמר רב ברם זכור אותו האיש לטוב ויהושע בן גמלא שמו שאלמלא\nהוא נשתכח תורה מישראל שבתחלה מי שיש לו אב מלמדו תורה מי שאין לו אב לא\nהיה למד תורה מאי דרוש (דברים יא, יט) ולמדתם אותם ולמדתם אתם התקינו\nשיהו מושיבין מלמדי תינוקות בירושלים מאי דרוש (ישעיהו ב, ג) כי מציון\nתצא תורה ועדיין מי. שיש לו אב היה מעלו ומלמדו מי שאין לו אב לא היה\nעולה ולמד התקינו שיהו מושיבין בכל פלך ופלך ומכניסין אותן כבן ט\"ז כבן\nי\"ז ומי שהיה רבו כועס עליו מבעיט בו ויצא עד שבא יהושע בן גמלא ותיקן\nשיהו מושיבין מלמדי תינוקות בכל מדינה ומדינה ובכל עיר ועיר ומכניסין\nאותן כבן שש כבן שבע</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, it seems that school is only second choice, comparing to the father himself teaching his son. The Melamed is only Shluach-Mitzva, since the father is incapable of performing it himself (whatever the reason). But if he could, then maybe the known statement from <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kidushin, 41:a</a> <code>מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו</code> should take effect.</p>\n<p>So I'm able to present some Talmud citations, but I'm asking what's the present Orthodox Rabbis' observation over the subject?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Just one source - but I like it! </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rechovot.blogspot.co.uk/2011_09_01_archive.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Rebbetzin's Husband blog</a> comments on the importance of a relationship with the Rebbe </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am not among those who want the junior high Rebbe to stick to the\n  curriculum.

And she never even replied to Leah saying she was the one who let her sister's marraige!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There is a fascinating Daat Zekenim which explains the answer to your question. He writes that the Simanim -\"signs\"- that Yaakov and Rachel made to be able to confirm that Lavan would not pull a \"switcharoo\" on them and substitute Leah for Rachel on the wedding night (Megillah 13b) where actually the laws of Niddah (women's menstruation cycle), Challah (separating bread), and Hadlakat Haner (Lighting the Shabbat candles). Thus, when Rachel feared that, should Lavan actually substitute Leah for her, Leah would become embarrassed if she didn't know the Simanim  (see ibid.), she gave over the Simanim to Leah. However, says the Daat Zekenim, Leah did not know these were Simanim; she thought Rachel simply wanted to teach her some laws! And when she \"passed the test\" of knowing the signs when Yaakov tested her, she assumed it was a mere coincidence that she had learned these laws previously with Rachel. Thus, it turns out that Leah actually never knew of this whole scheme, and of Rachel's sacrifice for her; she honestly believed that Yaakov was originally her husband! It is this that led Leah to exclaim \"it's not enough that you took my husband, etc.\" \n(Rachel, however, did not answer back and tell Leah the whole sacrifice she actually made for her.

Rochel was requesting the <em>dudoim</em> to help her conceive. Leah tried to explain that the fact that Yaakov stayed so often with her proved that evidently the reason for her barrenness was not physical which could be helped by natural remedies and the proper course of action should be for her to daven to Hashem. However Rochel misunderstood this and thought Leah wanted something in return for the <em>dudoim</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Ben Ish Chai (Oid Yosef Chai - Droshos) explains that Leah understood with Ruach Hakodesh that the tremendous self sacrifice of Rochel to give the signs to her has a merit which would stand for the Jewish nation forever (as the famous Midrash states that all our forefathers will implore on our behalf to bring the redemption, and it will be only the merit of Rochel that will convince Hashem). Leah wanted to prove that the Rochel's deed was selfless and thus she said \"You have taken my husband away\", knowing that Rochel would not reply, \"He was my husband originally\".</p></li>\n<li><p>I have seen an interpretation of the posuk that explains that Leah was not telling of/complaining to Rochel that she took away her husband (בתמיה) but rather negotiating a deal; if you let me have my husband for a bit I will give you the <em>dudoim</em> (בניחותא).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Cooking water on Shabas renders the pot non-kosher?",
    "content": "# Cooking water on Shabas renders the pot non-kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>halacha</em> (<em>SA OC</em> 318) generally is that if someone cooks food <em>b'mezid</em> (on purpose) on <em>Shabas</em> then he may not eat it, not even after <em>Shabas</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Magen Avraham</em> adds that the pot in which the food was cooked is non-kosher also. Later authorities explain that it is non-kosher for that person: anyone else can eat what may be cooked in it on a future date, but not him. (It can, incidentally, be made kosher again by the usual means (<em>Kaf Hachayim</em>).) They also mention that the ban on eating the food applies even to plain water that was cooked.</p>\n\n<p><em>Mishna Brura</em> explains that the reason the pot in which food was cooked is non-kosher (to him) is that it absorbed the forbidden (to him) food.</p>\n\n<p>Now, normally, absorption is a problem because the taste of the non-kosher food is absorbed in the walls of the pot, and comes out again when the pot is next used. Seemingly, then, if one cooked plain water on <em>Shabas</em>, the pot should not be rendered non-kosher: after all, water has no taste.</p>\n\n<p>Do any <em>pos'kim</em> discuss this issue: whether a pot in which plain water was cooked on <em>Shabas</em> is rendered non-kosher for the one who cooked in it? Or can anyone offer arguments one way or the other (beyond what I've written above)?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Someone raised this question at the <em>Shabas</em> table this week, and I figured I'd bring it here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I believe we can compare this case to the Din of the גיד הנשה (sciatic nerve) that Shulchan Aruch YD Siman 65:9 says that the actual גיד הנשה is like a piece of wood which has no taste but the Torah forbids it, therefore it does not make its mixture forbidden from what it exudes.</p>\n\n<p>In Siman 100:2 it says, if the גיד הנשה disintegrated and unrecognizable it needs 60 against it to nullify the mixture. (Meaning that since there is actual גיד הנשה in this mixture, though it has no flavor/taste, it is treated as any other prohibition which needs 60:1 ratio).</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9081&st=&pgnum=190&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kaf Hachayim (ibid #27)</a> brings a story that a גיד הנשה was cooked and the rabbi permitted the pot on the grounds that it does not give out any taste.</p>\n\n<p>This all assumes that water has no taste at all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There is machloket amoraim on a status of a food cooked on shabbat.\nrabbi meir holds that something which is intentionally cooked on shabbat is not allowed for use to everyone till after shabbat, and mutar to everyone including the cook after shabbat\nrabbi yeuda-  asur to the one that cooked forever and mutar to everyone else till after shabbat\nGra pasak for shita of rabbi Meir\nShulchan Aruch pasak for Rabbi Yehuda\nNow,acc to the Gra if you be strict like magen avraham, you can use the pot after shabbat , since r rabbi Meir holds of an opinion that everybody, including the cook is allowed to get benefit from the food after shabbat.\nRabbi Ovadya Yosef paskins like this (you are allowed do use a keli which u cooked with on shabbat, after shabbat is over, yalkut yosef shabbat kerch 3 page 27), even though he points out that from midst chasidut one can , if he can do hagala on a keli</p>\n\n<p>In addition by water may be even stronger side to be meykil since some rishonim(radbaz,rambam) hold cooking things that you can eat raw is asur only miderabanan and not mideoraita. Shulchan Aruch doesn't hold of that opinion.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Yaakov Kissing Rachel",
    "content": "# Yaakov Kissing Rachel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parashat Vayetzeh, Yaakov goes to Lavan's house, but prior to his arrival he meets up with Rachel. Shockingly, the Pasuk says that he kissed her and cried (29:11). How exactly are we to understand this episode? Do we not say that the Avot kept the whole Torah before it was given, and can we not assume that the righteous Yaakov would not do something so immodest as to kiss a girl he isn't married to yet - in public?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>Many commentaries have offered explanations to this issue. Even if you disregard societal differences of modesty or niddah concerns, there are other possibilities. Here are a few:</p>\n<h2>Rachel was too young to arouse passion</h2>\n<p>Ramban argues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורחל היתה קטנה ואין לחוש לה. וזה ענין וישק יעקב לרחל</p>\n<p>Rachel was young and so there was no concern [that she went shepherding alone], and that is the way \"Jacob kissed Rachel\" [was permissible].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Seforno indicates (on 29:18) that Jacob had to work so long for Lavan so that she be old enough to marry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>בתך הקטנה</strong>. כי תוך ז' שנים יהיה עתה עת דודים ותוכל בין כך להשיא הגדולה</p>\n<p><strong>your younger daughter</strong> - During these seven years she would reach marriageable age and in the meanwhile [Lavan] would marry off the older daughter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>Jacob was related to her and old.</strong></h2>\n<p>This argument bolsters the first and is usually explained concurrently. As the Seforno comments, this is why in the verse after the kiss does Jacob tell Rachel that they're related :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וישא את קולו ויבך</strong>. על שלא זכה לשאת אותה בנעוריו והיו לו לעת כזאת בני נעורים</p>\n<p><strong>And he raised his voice and wept</strong> - that he didn't merit to marry her in his youth for then he would have had children born to him as a young man.</p>\n<p><strong>כי אחי אביה הוא</strong>. להודיע שלא חטא במוסר כשנשק אותה</p>\n<p><strong>that he was her father's relative</strong> - to assure her that he did not act improperly by kissing her.</p>\n<p><strong>וכי בן רבקה הוא</strong>. הזכיר לה את רבקה אף על פי שהיתה בלתי נודעת לרחל כדי שתגיד לאביה</p>\n<p><strong>and that he was Rivka's son</strong> - He referred to Rivka even though she didn't know her, so that she would tell her father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this case, being related and the age gap permitted it in the spirit of the halacha (Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer 21:7) that parents can kiss their young children.</p>\n<h2><strong>Jacob kissed her head/shoulder/hand (or blew her a kiss?)</strong></h2>\n<p>Ramban offers this other explanation. He refers to Ibn Ezra's commentary on Jacob kissing Isaac (27:27). In both cases, the verb \"kiss\" is following by the preposition \"to\" or \"towards.\" This could mean that he didn't actually kiss her, or that it wasn't on the lips. Ramban writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>או הוא כדברי רבי אברהם (לעיל כז כז), כי נשיקה בלמ\"ד איננה בפה, רק נשק אותה על ראשה או על כתיפה:</p>\n<p>Or perhaps this is like R. Avraham's explanation (cf. 27:27), that kissing with a <em>lamed</em> means it wasn't on the lips. It was only kissing her on her head or on her shoulder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that explanation softens the potentially erotic conjuring of kissing.</p>\n<p>There are other explanations, especially kabbalistic ones, but these are the most common <em>peshat</em> explanations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The gemaroh in Kesubos daf 17 says that Rav Acha danced with the kallah on his shoulder. When the Chochomim asked if they were allowed to also? He answered - if she is like a beam in your eyes then you could do it too. But if not then certainly not. That was all only in those days when they were on a tremendously higher level then us today. Nowadays, shulchan aruch (pischei tshuva on Even Haezer 65:1) rules that we are not allowed to because nobody could say that holding the bride effects him like a wooden beam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Tanhuma Exodus 28, says that \"all kisses are of <em>tifluth</em>, except for the kiss of parting, the kiss of honoring and the kiss of meeting.\"\nthe kiss of meeting is a permissable display of affection between close relavtives. \nHere, the Torah, 29.10 is telling us that Ya'acov is being reminded of Rivkah when he sees Rachel. It repeats the phrase \"his mother's brother\" three times in passuk 10 to emphasize he is the son of Rivkah but only to tell us of the emotional encounter - \"and he raised his voice and wept.\" VaYishaq - \"kissed\" 29.11, is related to 29.10, VaYashe'qe \"watered\" - the Torah is emphasizing he watered Rachel with his tears!!! (without vowels, VaYishaq \"kissed\" is spelled the same as VaYashe'qe \"watered\"...)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Shimshon R Hirsch comments that the Torah mentions a number of times, in various phrases surrounding the kiss, that Rachel was Jacob’s kin. The Torah wishes to point out that Jacob’s actions were within the context of the realization that Rachel represented the continuation of his family’s traditions and values. In addition, Jacob sensed the embodiment of his sainted mother, Rebecca’s, persona. The intense emotion engendered by these awarenesses caused Jacob to kiss Rachel. Indeed, notes Rabbi Hirsch, Jacob’s tears should be sufficient proof that his Jacob’s intentions were completely pure.</p>\n\n\n",

However his whole family seems to be be there when Eisav arrives, furthermore Yaakov himself states (and it seems to be a metzius) that families with belongings travel far slower than Eisav and his warriors.

He was not sure that G-d would keep his fortune intact. He therefore split his family and their essentials in one camp, and the rest of his fortune in the other camp. Yaakov figured that \"if Eisav will hit one camp (i.e. his belongings) the other camp will surely be spared (i.e. family).</p>\n\n<p>We see later that all the family was together when they met Eisav.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>After struggling and overcoming the angel of Eisav, spiritually Yaakov now knew that his encounter with Eisav would be successful and that there was no need to send away the second camp. Furthermore Yaakov felt that his method of bribery/appeasement, which had worked with Eliphaz would be successful enough to abate Eisav's anger. </p>\n\n<p>I believe the way it could have worked in theory had it been necessary would be that they would leave the animals and most of the belongings behind so as to be able to travel more quickly. Yaakov specifies that traveling with children and all of the family belongings are what slows them down; it is reasonable to assume that traveling with servants (especially angelic ones) and women and children only would be able to move more quickly.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore we were commanded not to speak idle speech, as one [thereby] loses a part of his soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, according to the Nefesh Hachaim, inhaling words would not be involving one's <em>nefesh</em> in the prayer, and would be lacking in the <em>avodah</em> aspect of prayer.</p>\n\n\n",

Yaakov's wives name all of their children (except that Yaakov changes Ben-oni to Binyanim).  Yitzchak and Yishmael are named by God, and for Esav \"they\" named him and Yaakov's naming is passive (\"his name was\").  For the genaeologies we're just given names, not who bestowed them.</p>\n\n<p>What is special about Er (or Yehudah) that he gets special naming treatment?  Rashi is silent on this, and I didn't find anything in the chumashim I have.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14387&st=&pgnum=370\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a>, at that time and in that area, it must have been customary for the father to give the name to the first child and then alternate with the mother for future children. Here then, Yehuda names Er, his wife, the daughter of Shua, names Onan, then Yehuda should have named the third child, except that he was absent during the birth (\"וְהָיָה בִכְזִיב בְּלִדְתָּהּ אֹתוֹ\"), so the mother named him instead.</p>\n\n<p>In modern Biblical scholarship, the fact that sometimes the father names a child and sometimes the mother does is seen as strong evidence for the Documentary Hypothesis. One source must have originated in a culture in which the father customarily named the child while another was written in a culture where that custom belonged to the mother.</p>\n\n<p>Professor Umberto Cassuto, in his book (actually a transcribed and translated series of lectures) \"<em>The Documentary Hypothesis and the Composition of the Pentateuch</em>\" to combat this evidence, writes as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>When the Torah informs us of the name given to any child at birth, mostly it advances, as we know, an etymological explanation alluding to some circumstance that preceded or accompanied the birth. Now whenever this factor, to which the name owes its origin, is connected with the father, then the naming of the child is ascribed to the father, and when it is related to the mother, then she is said to name the child. This rule is simple and logical, and is valid in every case, without exception. When the circumstance appertains to the son himself or no etymological explanation is offered (which rarely obtains), then the rule does not, of course, apply; in one of these instances the naming is ascribed to the father, in another to the mother, and in the rest it is stated indefinitely,</em> \"one named\" <em>or</em> \"they named\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This case seems to be the exception to the rule mentioned by Cassuto. No explanation is offered for the naming of Er nor of Onan. (One can consider \"וְהָיָה בִכְזִיב בְּלִדְתָּהּ אֹתוֹ\" to be the explanation for Shelah's name.) Why, then, does the Torah specify who named the child? We can revert back to Abarbanel's explanation that this was merely the custom at the time. Or, more likely, the names <em>were</em> inspired by circumstances that preceded or accompanied the birth just like the other namings in Bereshis, except that for some reason the circumstance is not specified in the text. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a midrash somewhere that fills it in, but I know of none.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In footnote 5 of \"What's in a Name\" chapter 1 (footnotes unavailable in the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/273282/jewish/1-Who-Has-the-Right-to-Name-a-Child.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">online version</a>), R. Wilhelm goes into great length bringing sources for the custom of the father naming the first child, the mother the second child, the father the 3rd child, etc. (later in the chapter he brings many sources for the opposite opinion).</p>\n\n<p>He says that there may be a source for this custom from the naming of Yehuda's first 3 children. Yehuda Named Er, his wife named Onan, and Yehudah would have named Shilah, if not for the fact he was out of town during the birth (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&pgnum=496\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereshit 37:5</a>). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&pgnum=496\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Ramban on the verse</a> says that trying to connect the two ideas \"has no taste or smell\", but R' Wilhelm says (perhaps quoting some of the sources he brings) that perhaps the Ramban is not disagreeing with the custom, but only of trying to prove it from this verse.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do people daven so quickly, and what's the support for it?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I learned that one must clearly enunciate every word of tefila.  At the least this would include Shemoneh Esreh and Shema, but one might presume it includes the entire prayer service.  This question can easily apply to whatever definition of tefila one uses.</p>\n\n<p>In many shuls, the prayer leader is generally careful to clearly enunciate every word.  However, in some synagogues the pace of prayer is so fast that it seems physically impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, I have been davening for only about eight years, and a lot of these people have been davening for many decades.  Still, there's a certain physical limit to rate of speech.  It would seem, therefore, that in these synagogues they are not really enunciating every word - that or they are employing some form of kefitzas hadiburim.</p>\n\n<p>I want to stress that I am not in any way condemning this practice or saying that it is in fact better to spend more time on tefila than on learning, which I assume is the impetus to pray quickly in the first place.  On the contrary, I think both ways are very good, and I am not passing any judgements at all, Heaven forbid.  I'm sure that this practice is well supported.</p>\n\n<p>But please, help me understand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What exactly is the practice here?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Slurring all words together into a long drone?</p></li>\n<li><p>Only saying certain words and scanning the rest?</p></li>\n<li><p>Only saying the beginnings and endings of each part?</p></li>\n<li><p>Something else?</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Also, what is the halachic support for the practice?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is no support for slurring words. Many poskim, the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> among them, speak out strongly against slurring words, skipping, or mispronouncing. See the <em>Mishnah Berurah</em> in his opening to Hilchos Berachos and Pesukei D'zimra. He says that one must say blessings and pray as slowly as one who is extremely careful and meticulous about counting his money. If someone does any of the practices you mention, they certainly have no basis in Jewish law for doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Rabbi Avigdor Miller zt\"l and also the <em>Mishna Berurah</em> (Hilchos Pesukei D'zimra) says it is better to say fewer things properly, and with the right concentration, than to engage in speeding and slurring. (Though this is generally not followed or practiced as the accepted custom.)  One must remember that as they pray they are standing before a King and act appropriately (<em>Mishna Berurah</em>, Hilchos Hanhogos Ha'adam Ba'boker). </p>\n\n<p>However, I do know and have spoken to Hebrew speakers who are able to daven properly and at a considerably faster pace because they know the language significantly better. So, it is possible, but unlikely for many who are not fluent.</p>\n\n<p>Go at your own pace. Just because everyone else goes fast doesn't mean you have to.</p>\n\n\n",

If he did not continue (which is the translation I've always seen until now), then did he finally give her his third son?  Or was that unnecessary now that children were produced?

The letter, published in\nOlam Katan [Small World], a weekly pamphlet to be distributed in\nsynagogues nationwide this Friday, cited the biblical story of the\nShechem massacre (Genesis 34) and Maimonides' commentary (Laws of\nKings 9, 14) on the story as proof texts for his legal decision.\nAccording to Jewish war ethics, wrote Eliyahu, an entire city holds\ncollective responsibility for the immoral behavior of individuals. In\nGaza, the entire populace is responsible because they do nothing to\nstop the firing of Kassam rockets. The former chief rabbi also said it\nwas forbidden to risk the lives of Jews in Sderot or the lives of IDF\nsoldiers for fear of injuring or killing Palestinian noncombatants\nliving in Gaza. Eliyahu could not be reached for an interview.\nHowever, Eliyahu's son, Shmuel Eliyahu, who is chief rabbi of Safed,\nsaid his father opposed a ground troop incursion into Gaza that would\nendanger IDF soldiers. Rather, he advocated carpet bombing the general\narea from which the Kassams were launched, regardless of the price in\nPalestinian life. \"If they don't stop after we kill 100, then we must\nkill a thousand,\" said Shmuel Eliyahu. \"And if they do not stop after\n1,000 then we must kill 10,000. If they still don't stop we must kill\n100,000, even a million. Whatever it takes to make them stop.\" In the\nletter, Eliyahu quoted from Psalms. \"I will pursue my enemies and\napprehend them and I will not desist until I have eradicated them.\"\nEliyahu wrote that \"This is a message to all leaders of the Jewish\npeople not to be compassionate with those who shoot [rockets] at\ncivilians in their houses.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Eliyahu-advocates-carpet-bombing-Gaza\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Eliyahu-advocates-carpet-bombing-Gaza</a></p>\n\n\n",

Among these are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Pirush Rabbeinu Yonah – Rabbeinu Yonah of Gerona</strong> (c.1180-1263)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>HaChasid Ya’avetz – Rav Yosef Ya’avetz</strong> (d. 1507). Rav Yosef Yaavetz\nalso wrote a commentary on book of Tehillim (Psalms), and several\nbooks on Jewish belief.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Nachalas Avos – Rav Don Yitzchak Abarbanel</strong> (1437-1508)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Medrash Shmuel – Rav Shmuel di Uzeda</strong> (1538-1602). One of the most\ncomprehensive commentaries on Pirkei Avos, the Medrash Shmuel is both\na collection of earlier commentaries and an original commentary. Rav\nShmuel di Uzeda was a disciple of the Arizal and Rav Chaim Vital. He\nalso wrote commentaries on Megillas Rus and Megillas Eicha.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ruach Chaim – Rav Chaim of Volozhin</strong> (1749-1821).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Avos D’Rebbi Noson</strong>, a Talmudic work which expands upon the themes of Pirkei Avos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chovos HaLevovos – Rabbeinu Bachya ibn Paquda</strong> (Early 11th Century). Arguably the most important mussar work of all time, the Chovos HaLevovos is divided into ten Shearim (“Gates”). In each section, Rabbeinu Bachya precisely defines each concept and the principles related to it. These ten sections are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar HaYichud (“Gate of Unity”)</strong> – a philosophical discourse on the importance of proving to oneself that God exists, and the proper means by which to achieve this.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar HaBechina (“Gate of Discernment”)</strong> – on perceiving God’s wisdom and control in the world around us.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar Avodas HaElokim (“Gate of the Service of God”)</strong> – on our obligation to serve God.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar HaBitachon (“Gate of Trust”)</strong> – on our obligation to trust God.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar Yichud HaMaaseh (“Gate of Unity of Action”)</strong> – on the principle of devoting all one’s actions only to the service of God, and how to achieve this.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar HaKeniah (“Gate of Humility”)</strong> – on the principle of humility.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar HaTeshuva (“Gate of Repentance”)</strong> – on repentance.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar Cheshbon HaNefesh (“Gate of Self-Accounting”)</strong> – on the importance of introspection and self-examination and the proper ways to do this.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar HaPrishus (“Gate of Abstinence”)</strong> – on the value of separating oneself from physical and worldly pleasures, and the proper way to do so.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shaar Ahavas HaShem (“Gate of Love of God”)</strong> – on loving God.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Sefer HaYashar – Ascribed to Rabbeinu Tam – Rav Yaakov ben Meir</strong> (1100-1171). A philosophical mussar work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sefer Chasidim – Rabbeinu Yehuda HaChasid</strong> (c.1150-1217). A very influential mussar work with substantial kabalistic input.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shaarei Teshuva – Rabbeinu Yonah of Gerona</strong> (c.1180-1263). One of the most important and influential mussar works, the Shaarei Teshuva is considered the basic work on teshuva (repentance).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Igeres HaRamban – Rav Moshe ben Nachman (Ramban)</strong> (1195-1270). An extremely brief letter – only two or three pages long – the Igeres HaRamban was written by the Ramban to his son. Despite its brevity, this letter is considered a major mussar classic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Orchos Tzadikkim – Anonymous</strong> (c.13th Century). An extremely popular work, the Orchos Tzadikkim is divided into twenty-eight Shearim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Orchos Chaim L’Ha’Rosh - Rabbeinu Asher ben Yechiel (Rosh)</strong> (c.1250-1327). A very brief work consisting of admonishments to proper behavior and observance. Traditionally divided into seven sections for daily study.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maalos HaMiddos – Rabbeinu Yechiel</strong> (13th Century) – A classic work of mussar that discusses in depth twenty-four middos and their opposites:</p>\n\n<p>• Knowing God</p>\n\n<p>• Loving God & One’s Fellow</p>\n\n<p>• Fear of God & Parents</p>\n\n<p>• Torah Study & the Fulfilment of the Mitzvos</p>\n\n<p>• Kindness</p>\n\n<p>• Charity</p>\n\n<p>• Prayer</p>\n\n<p>• Humility vs. Pride</p>\n\n<p>• Modesty vs. Immorality</p>\n\n<p>• Shame vs. Arrogance</p>\n\n<p>• Faithfulness vs. Theft</p>\n\n<p>• Honesty vs. Deceitfulness</p>\n\n<p>• Compassion vs. Cruelty</p>\n\n<p>• Amicability vs. Anger</p>\n\n<p>• “A Good Name”</p>\n\n<p>• Yetzer Tov vs. Yetzer Hara</p>\n\n<p>• Teshuva (Repentance)</p>\n\n<p>• Wisdom vs. Foolishness</p>\n\n<p>• Wealth</p>\n\n<p>• Diligence vs. Laziness</p>\n\n<p>• Easily Satisfied vs. Gluttony</p>\n\n<p>• Generosity vs. Stinginess</p>\n\n<p>• Derech Eretz</p>\n\n<p>• Peace vs. Contention & Gossip</p>\n\n<p><strong>Menoras HaMe’or – Rav Yitzchak Aboav</strong> (c.14th Century). An extremely popular work, the Menoras HaMe’or was translated into numerous languages including Spanish/Ladino, Yiddish, German, and, most recently, English. Much of the Menoras HaMe’or is made up of extensive selections from the Talmud and Midrashim with commentary by the author.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You can try Orchot Chayim (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/mekorot/orhot-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>) written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_ben_Jehiel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosh</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>Sefer Chasidim</strong>, by Rabbi Yehudah HaChasid.</p>\n\n\n",

Conversely, when we recite this posuk at Mussaf, Mincha (and Neilah) it is when there is no issue of Semichus of Geulah L’Tefillah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before saying, Tehillos le'eil elyon, you should stand and prepare yourself for the prayer of Shemoneh Esrei [Amidah]. You should rid yourself of phlegm and saliva, and anything that may distract your thoughts; then walk back three steps and say: tehillos le'eil elyon, and continue till [Ga'al Yisrael], then return [to your position] by walking three steps forward in the manner of one approaching a king. <strong>You should not make any interruption between Ga'al Yisrael and Shemoneh Esrei, not even [in response] to Kaddish, Kedusha, or Barechu, because [the prayer of] redemption must be joined to the [Amidah] prayer</strong>. It is best to be precise in concluding the berachah of Ga'al Yisrael simultaneously with the chazzan, because should you finish first and the chazzan afterwards, there is a question whether to answer Amein to the berachah of the chazzan; but when you conclude the berachah with him, you are certainly not required to answer Amein, because you do not answer Amein to your own berachah. (See Chapter Six, paragraph eleven.) In the ma'ariv service, since the berachah preceding the Shemoneh Esrei [does not] end with Ga'al Yisrael, an interruption is permitted, as it is permitted at any place between one chapter and another. [See Chapter 16 paragraph 2] Before praying Shemoneh Esrei, we say the verse: \"Hashem, sefasai tiftach\" [My Master open my lips]. <strong>This is not [considered] an interruption because it is relevant to the prayer; but the verse: \"Ki Sheim Hashem ekra,\" etc. should not be said [before the Amidah], except at musaf and minchah prayers, before saying, Hashem, sefasai tiftach</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as why specifically this verse is chosen. I came across the forum thread of the dafyomi.co.il <a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/discuss_daf.php?gid=1&sid=20&daf=45&n=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which links it to a piece from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.29.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Shocher Tov / Midrash Tehillim 29</a>.</p>\n<p>The thread reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See the siddur of R'Shabsai Sofer, second volume, page 117, where R' Satz discusses the minhag of saying ki shem before shemona esra.

Midrash Tehilim (Socher Tov) 29:2 says the following. First it equates the verse \"Havu l'Hashem Kavod v'Oz\" that King David said with the verse of \"Ki Shem Hashem Ekra\" -- in both cases Moshe and King David were calling on others to give honor to Hashem, and to pray to Hashem. The Midrash continues that David tells us, in this Mizmor, how to pray: Havu l'Hashem... i.e., to mention Avos, Gevuros, Kedushas Hashem (as the Gemara learns from this Mizmor in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.32a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 32a</a>; Rashi Berachos 28b DH Havu).</p>\n<p>It seems from this <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.29.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash</a> that the words Ki SHem, and Havu l'Hashem, are a source for the prayer of Shemoneh Esreh that we pray. It is still not clear how this can be seen from the words Ki SHem... . Perhaps the \"Ki\" means not \"when,\" but \"just as.\" Moshe tells us to praise Hashem in Tefilah by following his lead. (In fact, the verses following the verse Ki Shem, in Haazinu, can be roughly formulating the same pattern of Avos, gevuros, Kedushas Hashem.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone else then points out a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Deuteronomy.32.3.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> on the verse which helps strengthen the claim just made above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The SFORNO indeed says that the words \"Ki Shem Hashem Ekra\" mean, \"When I pray\" (since the words \"Korei Hashem\" often refer to prayer, see his proofs).</p>\n<p>This may indeed be the source for the Midrash that we quoted in our earlier mailing, which asserts that Moshe was asking the Jews to pray. As I mentioned then, the word \"Ki\" may mean, \"just as I\" pray, so too should you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

So why is a search for “Jew” different? One reason is that the word “Jew” is often used in an anti-Semitic context. Jewish organizations are more likely to use the word “Jewish” when talking about members of their faith. The word has become somewhat charged linguistically, as noted on websites devoted to Jewish topics such as these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/jonah081500.asp\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/jonah081500.asp</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Someone searching for information on Jewish people would be more likely to enter terms like “Judaism,” “Jewish people,” or “Jews” than the single word “Jew” In fact, prior to this incident, the word “Jew” only appeared about once in every 10 million search queries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With that background, does the Jewish community generally encourage the rehabilitation of the word \"Jew\" by it being used in non-anti-Semitic contexts?

In any case, this is not a term I've seen used much at all in my experience. It's probably best avoided.

Whenever a noun is used as an adjective for the purpose of emphasizing an individual's or a group's \"other\"ness, that use is offensive, as it is intended to be.</p>\n\n<p>I will depart from The American Heritage Dictionary's assessment, however, about \"Jewess\" being insulting, and Isaac's advice to avoid it. I don't think it's offensive unless it is meant to be. It is a proper term for a female Jew. If someone means to insult me by emphasizing \"<em>Seth</em>\" with a glaring look or a sneer in a context of insulting or accusing language, I will be offended, but not because they used my name. \"Jewess\" is not widely used, but that's because it feels awkward. It's stuffy and uncomfortable in everyday English speech. But in Hebrew or, indeed, in any language with gender specification, the equivalent term is used.</p>\n\n<p>When referring to national events, it is appropriate to use the term \"the Jewish people\" or \"the Jews\", but in the context of ancient history, I think it is more accurate, especially in the post-Exodus Biblical period, to use \"Israelites\".</p>\n\n<p>Please note that the use of the word \"Jew\" as a verb (usually meaning \"cheat\" or \"steal\", as in, \"Don't try to Jew me.

(Shut MiMa'amakim (lit. \"from the depths\", cf Psalms 130:1) are the responsa of Rabbi Ephraim Oshri written between 1941 and 1945 in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kovno_ghetto\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kovno Ghetto</a>.)

For no matter if one actually ends up dying they were 'moser' themselves to Gd at that moment and therefore it is not a blessing in vain.</p>\n\n\n",

On one of the days that he was found in the South, his son was suppose to have his Bris. He was unable to make it to the actual Bris.

I heard this shailo was actually asked by the Beis Horah of R' Wosner and the Rabbonim there said he may not make the bracha. However I heard that other poskim argued on this and said that since he knows that at that time the bris was happening, he could therefore make the bracha. </p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows. In any case where the Father wasn't able to make the Bracha at the time of his son's bris (and he was the one who appointed the mohel to be the shliach to make the Bris), how long after the bris happens may he make the bracha? Must it be made right when the mitzvah is done? What about if he's not there; can he make the bracha when he hears about it happening (through the phone)? What about if he knew the Bris was supposed to be on a certain day and he didn't find out that it actually happened until a few days later; may the bracha be made then?</p>\n\n\n",

From this it is evident that before marriage it is easier to involve oneself in \"Maasim Tovim\" for then he has free time to learn Torah, and Chazal say (Kiddush 30) that \"I created the Yetzer Horah, and I created the Torah as an antidote. If you involve yourselves in Torah you will not be given over to it.\" Since the obstacle to \"Maasim Tovim\" is the Yetzer Horah, and before marriage he had the Torah to protect him it was not so difficult to practise \"Massim Tovim\". However, after one gets married and assumes the yoke of supporting his family he is now susceptible to the Yetzer Horah who attempts to stop him from performing good deeds and he no longer has Torah to help.

Yitzchok is the idea of severity, and the Torah was given on Shavuos \"Mipi Hagevura\", and Yaakov whose idea was Torah signifies the holiday of Sukkos (as Torah creates a \"shade\"- sukkah - for the soul).</p>\n\n<p>We can similarly connect these three concepts to the three blessings of \"Torah\", \"Chuppah\" and \"Massim Tovim\". Avraham - kindness and charity - is \"Massim Tovim\". Yitzchok who is connected to Shavous, the marriage day between Hashem and the Jewish people, corresponds to \"Chuppa\", and Yaakov is the idea of \"Torah\".</p>\n\n<p>In our personal G-dly service we need to emulate the actions of the three forefathers and thus must incorporate these three ideas. However, the balancing act between kindness and severity is often difficult - too much kindness can be inappropriate as can too much harshness. We balance the two by preceding the Chesed with Gevurah insuring that the kindness is directed to the proper channels. Thus the ideal order is to base ones actions on the directive of \"Torah\", which instructs us how and when to have the idea of \"Chuppah\" (Gevura) first, and then \"Massim Tovim\" (Chesed).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Likkutey Levi Yitzchok (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31612&st=&pgnum=66\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ha'aros to Sefer Hazohar, Breishis pg. 60</a>, written by R' Levi Yitzchok Shnuerson, father of the Lubavitcher Rebbe) explains that Bris Milah corresponds to Rosh Hashana (a central theme of Rosh Hashana is the Zichronos of the \"bris\" between the Jewish people and Hashem commemorated by the blowing of the Shofar [see there for more connections between Rosh Hashana and Milah]). \"Torah\" corresponds to Yom Kippur when the second Luchos were given. The schach of Sukkos resembles the \"Chuppah\", and \"Maasim Tovim\" corresponds to Shmini Atzeres (he does not explain why).</p>\n\n\n",

This is the oldest version of the ten sephirot as we know them. In the Zohar we find that Man was created from the four elements: fire and wind and dust and water (Zohar -- Secrets of the Torah volume 1(Genesis), portion of Lech Lecha page 80a; see also Zohar Chadash volume 2 on the Scroll of Ruth, page 41a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=j3gYwJhTVQYC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=nachmanides%20four%20elements&source=bl&ots=jtzLRbm4XA&sig=YrxyGehOnppoVHU2jP-whzkYOXY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pv27UKfMDI690QHt24CQCQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=nachmanides%20four%20elements&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramban and Seforno</a>, who added a fifth element, from which the heavens were formed.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the Greeks believed in the four elements.

The theory of the\"four elements\" was first suggested by Empedocles, a Greek philosopher who lived in the fifth century BCE. According to this theory, thephysical (material) world is made up of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. These elements cannot be dismantled, and the various materials in the world are different from each other in the relative amounts of the four elements which comprise them. The Greek philosopher Aristotle, who lived in the fourth century BCE, adopted the theory of the four elements and added a fifth,\"ether,\" the sacred element from which, he believed, the heavens are formed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What we see here is borrowing of the contemporary science, and adaptation and assimilation into (fundamental) Jewish beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, once something enters the realm of theology, it no longer has to assume its most literal interpretation. Certainly many kabbalistically-oriented people today*  don't deny that there is a periodic table of the elements.

    "content": "# No More Zechuth Avoth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=shabbos&daf=55a\">Gemara (Bab. Shab. 55a)</a> discusses when Zechuth Avoth ceased. I am aware of several opinions in Tosafoth that it ended for wicked people, or it ended for everyone but the very righteous or it ended but Berith Avoth didn't end - whatever that means.  But - what <em>does</em> that mean?  So much of our religious culture seems to assume that we are still in G-d's good graces because of the merits of our forefathers!  What does it mean if we've used up that merit?!  On what basis are we waiting for redemption, for one thing?  On what basis do we pray for mercy and favor, for another thing?  But my question is broader - generally, what does it mean for us not to have that merit in our favor?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>This question is part of the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/q/1325/5\">Daf Yomi Challenge</a></strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><em>Meshech Chochmah</em> (Parashat Bechukotai) explains the difference between Zechut Avot (s.v. באופן <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_14061_237.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) and Brit Avot (in the top-left paragraph <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_14061_238.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) as follows:</p>\n\n<p>If one invests in his friend's business, and subsequently sees his friend's children carrying on the business in the same good way as the father, he will be inclined to continue investing in the business since he sees the same positive qualities that caused him to invest in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>If, however, the investor sees that the children are failing in the business, he will be inclined to intervene and ensure that his initial investment is not squandered, and will reinvest so as not to let the business die.</p>\n\n<p>So it is for us. If we are walking in the ways of our forefathers - doing chesed and following the path - then we remind God of why he initially invested in the Jewish people and, in turn, He will deal with us on the level of Zechut.</p>\n\n<p>If, instead, we are not following the path, then He will deal with us on the level of Brit (i.e. covenant) to prevent all He did for our forefathers going to waste. In doing so, He gives us time to regain our footing and return to the path).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>One approach is that of the Ri (Tos. ad loc., s.v. <em>uSh'muel</em>), who maintains that <em>z'chus avos</em> was suspended only for the wicked. The Zohar also takes this position (זוהר - רעיא מהימנא כרך ג פרשת שלח). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One of the basic principles in the kabbalah of the Ramchal is the need to rectify (m'takein) the female aspect of the presence of God (the shechina) which is currently in exile among the husks (klipot). Furthermore it is basic to all kabbalistic systems that there are a multiplicity of worlds, each of a more spiritually refined nature then the next, with our own world being the least connected to divinity.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51292&pgnum=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tikkunim Chadashim</a> (also known as Shivim Tikkunim) the Ramchal explains that the idea that zechus avos is no longer available means that while in the times of the avos the rectification of the shechina was achieved above (in the supernal realms/worlds) with the ramifications issuing downward evetually into our existence, that is no longer possible. Hence any new rectification (which according to the Ramchal would come through the 2 moshiachs and Moshe) must be instigated from below and raised to the higher realms. See further <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/829646/The_Circle_of_Moshe_Hayyim_Luzzatto_in_Its_Eighteenth-Century_Context\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jonathan Garb's article</a> pg 191 and note 19.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize: The Ramchal sees the termination of zechus avos as a special quality of the avos which enabled them to to achieve unique spiritual feats which can no longer be replicated in the same fashion.</p>\n\n<p>Thus to address your questions I would extrapolate two things 1) the merit of the achievements of the avos may still very well exist and benefit their descendants and 2)when we pray and invoke the avos we are noting both their accomplishment and the fact that we seek to achieve similar ends (a tikkun of the shechina) in our own way.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why does Rashi say דבתם refers to the children of Leah?",
    "content": "# Why does Rashi say דבתם refers to the children of Leah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?tdate=12/2/2012\">Bereshis 37:2 sv את דבתם רעה</a>) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל רעה שהיה רואה באחיו <strong>בני לאה</strong> היה מגיד לאביו - Any evil he saw in his brothers, <strong>the sons of Leah</strong>, he would tell his father</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However it would seem that the plain meaning is that Yosef told his father about the deeds of the children of Bilah and Zilpah who are referenced earlier in the same pasuk. Furthermore, without Rashi's comment the sequence of events would be easier to understand. First the pasuk tells us Yosef spent time with the children of Bilah and Zilpah who were spurned by the other Shevatim and then it tells us that he spoke about them to his father. This could be perceived by the children of Bilah and Zilpah as an act of repudiation by the one person who was seemingly their friend. Hence when the brothers collectively plotted against Yosef it would make sense for the children of Bilah and Zilpah to be in cahoots. </p>\n\n<p>However, taking Rashi's pshat, it would seem strange for the children of Bilah and Zilpah to suddenly turn on the one brother who was kind to them and join with the brothers who acted poorly toward them initially. </p>\n\n<p>What forced Rashi to say a peshat in the word דבתם that obfuscates the simple meaning of the pasuk?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One important thing to realize about Rashi's commentary is how often he is citing midrash. He may very well believe that these midrashim were historical. And he cites them as אגדה המיישבת דברי המקרא דבר דבור על אופניו, as he states in his commentary to Bereishit 3:8. That is, midrash which works with peshat, and answers to peshat concerns.</p>\n\n<p>In this instance, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39937&st=&pgnum=475\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekorei Rashi</a> states that Rashi is getting this from Tanachuma Aleph, ot 6. Tanchuma Aleph is a variant text of Midrash Tanchuma than we have, which Rashi often cites. So it seems quite possible that in the text of the midrash before Rashi, the ones whom Yosef told negative reports were explicitly identified as the sons of Leah.</p>\n\n<p>If so, it may be simple respect for the sanctity of the tradition of the midrash that causes Rashi to repeat the detail. That is, he repeats the midrash because it fills in the content of the dibba raa, and indeed deduces it from cues in the text. (See Yishai's answer.) But he is not about to change the midrash and strip out that detail, even if it would smooth the flow of the narrative according to the potential plot hole you identified. </p>\n\n<p>And recall that not every detail of a midrash needs to be absolute peshat. It is midrash. But it is brought, in its entirety, to address a peshat concern.</p>\n\n<p>As to why specifically the sons of Leah, we can think locally rather than globally. The precise content of the dibba was the subject of a three-way dispute of Tannaim, according to the midrash (as we see <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=1&mefaresh=raba&perek=37\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). Rabbi Meir said it was ever min hachai; Rabbi Shimon said it was arayos; and Rabbi Yehuda said they denigrated the sons of the shefachot. Then, Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon combined all three. That is, he assumed all three were simultaneously true, and showed how Yosef was punished for this lashon hara.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the third opinion (designated Rabbi Yehuda) <strong>has to be</strong> about the sons of Leah, who were denigrating the sons of the concubines. If so, that could be the cause of attributing all three to the sons of Leah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It seems to me that Rashi wants to find the meaning of דבתם in the verse itself. This is what the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31964/lubavitcher-rebbes-view-on-rashi/31978#31978\">idea of Pshat</a> is.</p>\n\n<p>So he lists those three things, because they are in the verse.</p>\n\n<p>רעה את אחיו בצאן - he they were shepherds, and shepherds eat sheep, so he said they didn't wait until they were properly dead to eat them.</p>\n\n<p>את בני בלהה ואת בני זלפה <strong>נשי אביו</strong> - The children of those two mothers were wives - but they called them slaves.</p>\n\n<p>והוא נער - he made himself look good, so he complained about sexual behavior (note that the same thing happens later on, when Potiphar's wife comes after him).</p>\n\n\n",

And he himself can't\npossibly know this because it is easy to make a mistake in this, with\nit appearing to him as if he is reading from the Torah while in truth\nhe is reading from his memory of what he saw in the Chumash. It is\nbetter to hear [the reading] from a second reader who really reads it\nfrom the Tora even though he does not know the cantillations, as long\nas he properly splits up the verses such that the ends of the verses\nare recognizable, for it is forbidden to stop in a place that Moshe\ndid not stop and it is forbidden to join together what Moshe\nseparated.

And if it is within toch k'dei dibbur\nit is logical that it would certainly not help because toch k'dei\ndibbur is like actual speech for the entire Torah. There is a leniency\nfrom this that if he saw it in the Sefer Torah and for some reason\nneeded to close his eyes, it would be considered as reading it from\nthe Sefer Torah, and within toch k'dei dibbur it is logical that he\ncan certainly read, and this requires more analysis for the actual\nlaw.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why isn't נִצָּבָה redundant?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Bereshis 37:7 we read:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהִנֵּה אֲנַחְנוּ מְאַלְּמִים אֲלֻמִּים בְּתוֹךְ הַשָּׂדֶה וְהִנֵּה <strong>קָמָה</strong> אֲלֻמָּתִי וְגַם <strong>נִצָּבָה</strong> - Behold, we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field, and behold, my sheaf <strong>arose</strong> and also <strong>stood upright</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The meforshim explain the difference in meaning between קָמָה and נִצָּבָה but none that I have seen explain the conceptual redundancy. Meaning, why do we need to know that Yosef's sheaf both arose and stood upright? It doesn't seem to have any practical ramifications in terms of the dream or otherwise. Why then isn't the word נִצָּבָה redundant?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>If the verse omitted either one of the two actions (to rise and to remaining standing upright) we would not get the full picture of the dream Yosef is describing. If the verse omitted \"rose up,\" one might think the sheaf was already standing and that it could have been placed in that position by human agency. Therefore, the verse tells us that it \"rose up\" specifically at that time and by its own agency. </p>\n\n<p>The word נִצָּבָה indicates further that the sheaf remained standing from its own agency, that is, it did not fall down, and it did not lean against anything, and it did not require a human hand to hold it up.  The verb נִצָּבָה also connotes endurance in standing upright, perhaps as a hint to Yosef's enduring preeminency among the tribes. If the verse ommitted נִצָּבָה , this element would be missing.</p>\n\n<p>The two words together magnify the prophecy and the miraculous nature of it. It is a double miracle that the sheaf both rose up and remained standing (even though it was 'just a dream'). Yosef had to \"rise up\" from being despised by his brothers, sold, and imprisoned and then \"remain standing upright\" in a new rank and status within the tribes. For example, many (but not all) of the elements of being the first-born (bachor) are ultimately transferred to Yosef and it is this new, elevated status that endured.</p>\n\n<p>All this is simply what I understand from knowing the difference between the two words (as Rashi explains) and from knowing the narrative context.   </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Malbim <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32825&st=&pgnum=327\" rel=\"nofollow\">explains</a> that the difference between עמד and יצב is that עמד just means the position of standing, as opposed to sitting or walking etc. whereas יצב is where you are <em>actively</em> standing, i.e. standing intentionally and against adversary.</p>\n\n<p>One could be standing because they were standing a moment ago and nothing has changed, or could be standing because they are purposefully staying that way.  Yosef was being told that his remaining standing would not just be the incidental result of the fact that he got up, but he would remain standing despite the challenges that would come.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The sefer Arvei Nachal <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19050&st=&pgnum=131\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> on this parsha explains that a rise to power and wealth can sometimes lead to a person becoming arrogant and thus neglect his observance of Torah and mitzvos, and so the rise in fortune can be the cause of a person's downfall. But if Hashem makes a person powerful or wealthy as a reward for a mitzvah that he has done, then he can be sure that it will not be the cause of his downfall, because then it would be a punishment and not a reward.<br><br>\nTherefore, in Yosef's dream he was assured that he would rise up and remain standing, because his rise in fortune was a reward for his righteousness in the incident of the wife of Potiphera and so would not lead to his downfall.</p>\n\n\n",

He literally interprets the passage\n  “and Midianite men passed by, merchants, and they drew Yosef up out of\n  the pit; and they sold Yosef to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of\n  silver…” as follows: The brothers were eating at a distance from the\n  pit…and waiting for the arrival of the Ishmaelites whom they had\n  observed approaching.

    "content": "# Were our symbols for trope and nekudos created by the Masoretes, or transmitted by them?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is commonly said in secular sources that the shapes of the trope and nekudos we use today were invented by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretes\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Masoretes</a> (7th to 11th Century CE), but I cannot find any source in our mesorah to this effect. </p>\n\n<p>Is it based solely on the archaeological premise that we do not see them documented historically until then, or are they affirmed by a halachic source to have been invented at that time?</p>\n\n<p>Could it not be an older tradition transmitted and documented by the Masoretes?</p>\n\n<p>The most obvious ramification here is these systems' presence in the Zohar Hakadosh (eg Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 69 pg 107a) traditionally attributed to Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai (d. 2nd Century CE).  Either these systems were in existence at that time, are present in the Zohar  as a product of ruach hakodesh, or represent later additions to the text.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>I linked in the comments to the question to <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%202%20Rabinowitz.pdf\">an article</a> by Dan Rabinowitz published by <em>Hakirah</em> journal regarding Jewish sources pertaining to the origin of the <em>nekudos</em>. [Note that although the <em>taamim</em> of the Tanach are not mentioned throughout the article, it seems implicit in most of the sources (and in the main source, actually explicit) that the same applies to the <em>taamim</em>.] The gist of it is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The earliest sources to be found are those that address why our Torah scrolls lack the vowel symbols. The split begins here.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Machzor Vitri (11th Century) cites an anonymous <em>\"t'shuvas hagaon\"</em> who writes that the original Torah scrolls did not have vowels for the <em>nekudos</em> did not exist at the time. Even when they were later invented, we keep our official Torah scrolls emulating the originals.</li>\n<li>Radbaz (16th Century) believes that the <em>nekudos</em> were received as part of the oral tradition at Sinai, but were not included in the main text to allow for mystical and esoteric readings of the text that often rely on attributing different vowels to various words.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first source to directly address the history of the <em>nekudos</em> after the above citations was R' Eliyahu HaBachur in <em>Mesoras HaMasores</em> (16th Century). He demonstrated that <em>nekudos</em> in the Hebrew language did not exist until after the close of the Talmudic era. Certainly not \"Sinaitic\". (It is worth noting that HaBachur explicitly claims that he finds no contradictions between this view and any statements of Chazal or the Zohar.)</p>\n\n<p>After that, it becomes a matter of who agrees with HaBachur and who (often vehemently) disagrees. The Zohar here becomes a central issue, being that it clearly employs the use of the <em>nekudos</em>. If one agrees with HaBachur, they must admit that parts of the Zohar are at the very least post-Talmudic. Indeed, the sources that agree are found in anti-Zoharic works (by which I mean sources arguing the late dating of the Zohar).\nOn the other hand, those disagreeing with HaBachur use the Zohar as their main argument, taking as a given that it was composed in the Tannaitic era.</p>\n\n<p>Those who agreed with R' Eliyahu HaBachur as to the late origins of the <em>nekudos</em>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>R' Yaakov Emden (<em>Mitpachas Sefarim</em>)</li>\n<li>R' Samuel David Luzzatto (<em>Vikuach al Chochmas HaKabbala</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those who disagreed and maintained that the <em>nekudos</em> were received at Sinai (i.e. existed at the time of <em>Matan Torah</em>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>R' Azariah de Rossi (<em>Meor Einayim</em>)</li>\n<li>Chida (<em>Shem HaG'dolim</em>)</li>\n<li>R' Moses Mendelssohn (Introduction to the <em>Biur</em>)</li>\n<li>R' Moses Kunitz (<em>Ben Yochai</em>)</li>\n<li>R' Shlomo Schick (<em>Torah Sh'leimah</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rashi on Berachot 62A says that people used to use hand signs to indicate the proper vocalization of the words as the Torah was read. I have heard from several different people, but not seen in writing, that the nekudot and taamim that are printed today are attempts to pictographically represent these hand gestures. This would explain why earlier texts such as the Zohar could refer to the symbols before they were formalized in writing, and why many sources discussing the subject don't see it as a contradiction.

R Chiya went and taught children different parts of the chumash and mishna and then told them to teach each other.

The Aruch HaShulchan (YD 289:4) rules this way as well, as does the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (11:7) and Mishneh Halachot (7:186). However, Rav Ovadiah Yosef (Yabia Omer OC 3:17:11) distinguishes the cases because by the Tallit, the obligation to wear Tzitzit vanishes as soon as one stops wearing the piece of clothing. On the other hand, the obligation to have a Mezuzah on the door remains in place even after the Mezuzah itself fell. Accordingly, he rules not to recite a new blessing.

Someone on their porch has a wooden beam structure that has on it metal rings that one can attach a swing to by the way of a hook. The swing can be easily attached and detached. Is it <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/591\">muter</a> to \"hang\" up the swing on Shabbos by attaching the hook to the ring? Is this a problem of \"binyan\" (building)? Does it depend how long it'll be there fore? Nothing is screwed in or attached with a similar more \"permanent\" method, rather you press down on the hook and latch it onto the ring.</p>\n\n<p>Update: The following is an image of an eye bolt that is used to hang the swing from. <img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V2mNI.jpg\" alt=\"image of eye bolts of different sizes\"></p>\n\n<p>There is a chain that has on the end of it a sort of \"hook\" that will be attached to the eye bolt. The following I'll use as an example however not necessarily this exact thing: <img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iQgbg.jpg\" alt=\"image of carabiner\"></p>\n\n<p>So again we have a swing with a chain on with sides. At the end of the chain there is the clamp/hook/whatever it's called that will be attached to the eye bolt. I realize the one pictured here sometimes has an option to \"screw\" it into place, let's say this will be done without screwing (or that it doesn't have that option. From the picture here there doesn't appear to be any \"screwing\" option. Is this swing muter to hang up on Shabbos? Would it make a difference on how much time it'll be there for?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would say could be <em>Boneh</em> because as you state it is being attached to something that is mounted into the ground.

To let you know the reward of the righteous, for it is\n  customary for Arabs to carry only naphtha and tar, whose odor is foul,\n  but for this one (Joseph) it was arranged [that they should be\n  carrying] spices, so that he should not be afflicted by a foul odor.\n  [Mechilta Beshallach, treatise 2, section 5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How is it that Joseph was considered a Tzaddik at this moment? Isn’t his righteousness discovered only in the later encounter with Mrs Potifar? See <a href=\"http://rabbishimon.com/tzadikim/showz.php?p=yosef.htm&nm=Yosef\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> where the Zohar is quoted to say, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Rabbi Shimon says, prior to the occurrence of that test to Yosef,\n  [he] was not called a tzaddik.

What comes out of the discussion is that there is one level of Tzadik attained simply by virtue of having a bris (\"ועמך כולם צדיקים\"), and a higher level merited through safeguarding the bris. This later level of Tzadik is what Yosef obtained through the incident with Pitofar's wife, but it does not negate him being considered a Tzadik even before.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Alternatively, the הגהות מהרצ\"א דינוב to an almost identical statement in Zohar (2:23a) writes as follows (my own loose translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הן אמת שכן מרגלא בפומייהו דרבנן לקרוא יוסף הצדיק, אבל לא ידעתי שחר\n  מקומו במקרא, ואפשר כן נמסר להם בתורה שבע\"פ\n  Indeed we find that the Sages commonly refer to Yosef as \"Yosef Hatzadik\", however I am not aware of the Scriptural source for this. It is possible that was an oral tradition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems he is learning that the meaning of being called a Tzadik in the Zohar is that this became is title. Although he was considered righteous already when being taken down to Egypt, it was only after passing the test with Eshes Potifar that he merited the unique title of \"Yosef Hatzadik\".

The advertisers only pay if someone actually clicks on their ad. It seems \"pashut\" to me that clicking an ad if you know you're not going to buy anything from the site is tantamount to gezel. A friend of mine, however, claims that the advertiser is willing to pay the xyz amount in order to get you to his online store and have a chance at convincing you. Especially since the advertiser goes into this knowing that people may click ads but not buy.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone think of any sources to prove this one way or another?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is similar to a door-to-door salesmen knocking on your private property. He will knock and attempt to entice you to buy a magazine subscription, but you have no intention of buying. He however came on your private property (your computer which you own, the IP which you pay monthly for from your internet service provider, and the browser you downloaded) So at that point that the magazine salesman decides to \"pop up\" at your doorstep and even though you \"browse\" through a magazine with no intention of buying, he still came to you. </p>\n\n<p>When you go on YouTube or type a search on Google or see a sidebar that bombards you with contextual ads, you have to watch the commercial in order to view the video. You are essentially paying to watch the YouTube video by watching the commercial. If you have an ad-blocker, you aren't essentially preventing the advertisement from running in background. The advertisement is still running, just prevented to be shown on your browser. Just like a door is preventing a salesman from just walking into your home.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1:1.

The Torah\n  requires a thief to compensate the party from whom he stole, whether\n  he be a Jew or a gentile, an adult or a minor. 1:2. The Torah\n  prohibits stealing even the slightest amount. It is forbidden to steal\n  as a jest, to steal with the intent to return, or to steal with the\n  intent to pay.

I can't always determine the variables or the environment that will prevent me; or not, to buy something.

You compete with other companies.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You ask for sources to help decide one way or another which is important since this is not a clear-cut situation.</p>\n\n<p>The classical halachic case closest to this case that I can think of is the question of whether one can enter a shop to browse with no intention of buying (more precisely, knowing full well in advance one doesn't want to buy anything, e.g., to check prices).</p>\n\n<p>It is an example of <em>onaat devarim</em> (hurting with words) and is forbidden (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.228?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA CM 228</a> based on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.17?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vayikra 25:17</a> <em>lo tonu ish et amito</em> and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.58b?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baba Metzia 58b</a>) to avoid disappointing the seller. It is of course fine to enter the shop, browse and leave if one didn't find something interesting, as long as there was a real possibility one could have bought something.</p>\n\n<p>The rationale for the interdiction is not entirely defined. <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Hurting_Others%27_Feelings#cite_note-27\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halachipedia mentions</a> that the Meiri gives two reasons for the prohibition: (1) other potential customers who observe one’s decision to refrain from purchasing the item would conclude that the item is overpriced and would consequently only buy it for less, causing the seller financial pain and (2) one’s decision to refrain from buying the item, having appeared to be interested, causes the seller to feel dejected.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://matzav.com/business-halacha-browsing-a-store-to-buy-online/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R Meir Orlian</a> mentions one is taking time from the seller that he could invest to serve other customers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think the analogy with clicking on contextual ads holds</strong> when building on the latter explanation. <strong>If one is sure one will not buy, then clicking is taking resources (money) away from the seller which he could have invested to sell to others.</strong> Advertisers will often buy a finite amount of ad impressions so one is taking away a finite resource knowing full well one will not buy. On the other side if there is a small but non nil chance one might buy then it is of course perfectly acceptable to click.</p>\n\n<p><strong>An important limitation of <em>onaat devarim</em> is that it applies primarily to Jews</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.228.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rama CM 228:1</a>, one reason is that non-Jews don't have this sort of laws so we don't need to go beyond their law in our relations with them). This has very practical implications when clicking on ads from non-Jewish sellers and outside of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://matzav.com/business-halacha-browsing-a-store-to-buy-online/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/vbm/english/archive/chavero2/06chavero.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/business-halacha/5757/vol2no32.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">there</a> for relevant discussions of these sources.

Rabbi Feinstein asserts that just as the Sages did not want, and therefore forbade our asking, non-Jews to perform work on our behalf on Shabbat for fear that this would disrupt the Shabbat atmosphere (see Rambam, Hilchot Shabbat 6:1) so too the Sages would not want machines to do work on our behalf during Shabbat. Rabbi Feinstein appears to be the lone authority to adopt this approach. <a href=\"http://torahmusings.com/2010/09/timers-on-shabbat-and-yom-tov/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The consensus of authorities permits setting timers before Shabbat.

However, the use of a robot on Shabbat may still be forbidden for other reasons. For example, if it employs a microphone to listen for instructions, there are cases when use of a microphone is allowed, such as in hearing aids (Shemirat Shabbat Kehilchato, vol. 1, 34), and other cases in which it is forbidden, such as for recording or amplifying a performance (ibid.  vol. 1, 28).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Robots exist now that can act based on voice instructions. You can't tell such a robot to do melacha for you just like you can't indirectly cause any melacha.

If the case by kinyan is parallel to shabbos, it should be assur to cause (through speech) animals or robots to do melacha on shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>Also, it would definitely go against the spirit of shabbos, but probably is not included in amirah l'akum. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Robots have no free will (just like animals) and I remember seeing a Teshuva which says you can't tell animals to do Melacha for you on Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n",

There is a temple in India, dubbed the \"Richest temple in the World\" where pilgrims shave their heads as offerings to their god. This temple supplies the top wig and hair extension manufacturers. If it is not kosher to eat food sacrificed to an idol, is it permissible or not to wear hair sacrificed to an idol since you're not ingesting it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>This was a very hot topic several years ago when some it became known that many wigs from India have hair that comes from idol worship.

They say 'no one said its prohibited.' But we do tell them its assur. That's what the sages said they banned wigs. The great sages, the vilna gaon, the yaabets, the chatam sofer, maharatz chajes and other gedolim as well the all said its assur. So they say, ‘no so how come this Rabbi is quiet about it? He sees his daughter going out like that and doesn’t say anything. How come that Rabbi is silent, his wife wears a sheitel’<br/>\nThey fool themselves. They do it lechatchila they think its allowed. And if someone doesn’t wear a sheitel they actually make fun of them. If so their sin is double and triple as great! Where is the Yirat Shamayim? What about a person having to listen to the words of the sages. Who wrote this in their sefarim? Am I making this up? I brought this all down from the poskim! All of them one after another, they all wrote it’s prohibited. I didn’t just make this up they all say its assur. Why should we transgress their words? For what? Just to look a little ‘prettier’? Is there any prettiness lacking in fancy hats and tichels? Silk, embroidered. Just wear one of those. Its also better in terms of tzniut. This is the way of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nor does Chief Rabbi Rav Yitzchak Yosef Shlita, apparently due to the concern brought in your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All this madness of wigs (sheitels) for women, Hashem have mercy. The sephardim have never had such a thing. I looked into this issue and found out that virtually ALL of the hair being used for wigs/sheitels is sourced from idolatry (Avodah Zarah).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, wigs have become a very popular trend in modern day orthodoxy. Most B’not Yisrael (Jewish women) that use sheitels have no idea where these beautiful “hair coverings” really come from. The truth is that over 98% of all wigs in the market today come from places of Avodah Zarah (i.e. the idol worshipping temples of India). Yes, this is the case despite having a Kosher certification saying that they were “Made in Europe/Brazil or other countries”. This is the only part of the Jewish industry that has a single entity certifying Kashrut, as everyone knows there is no way to kosher Avodah Zarah without lying.   Over 25 million men and women in India sacrifice their hair (tonsure) to their deities in idolatrous temples each year, creating an unlimited market supply of top quality hair.  The temples then take this hair they received for free and sell it to European, Brazilian, American, etc.  companies, which thereby use it to make the very same sheitels carried by your local sheitel machers.\nRemember that the Torah strictly forbids ever benefitting from Avodah Zarah, and that there is no way to make is Kosher. A hair that was tonsured and sacrificed is then absolutely forbidden by the Torah, since it’s considered as a benefit of an act of Avodah Zarah.  This literally means that even if a wig has only a single strand of hair from these idol worshipping temples in India, the wig is now considered a benefit of Avodah Zarah.  As a secondary note, we all know that even in the absence of idolatry, the wigs being marketed today are completely immodest and forbidden even by the Poskim that permitted wigs (before the discovery of their Avodah Zarah roots).

(Indeed, it is common practice that one recites \"<em>Alenu</em>\" when the congregation does even if he is not at that point in the service or is not praying at all.) In what sense are the latter two considered prayers that are recited communally (more so than most of the rest of the prayer service), that the <em>Mishna B'rura</em> mentions them as communally-recited prayers?

This is a reference to those that come to the Bet Midrash and to shuls. The Gemarah states that people would spend time meditating in the shul prior to the start of davening.

Originally, Psalm 83 followed the Chazzan's Kaddish (<em>Kadish Titkabel</em>) and *aleinu was considered an \"extra\" tefillah recited by the individual, similar to what is commonly done now regarding the 6 Remembrances, 13 principles of Ramba\"m, etc.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/2008-08-15_Tefila_Newsletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> indicates that the communal concept of Aleinu began during the Crusade period. The main purpose was to implant the concept of unity of G-d  in the people's minds esp. during the time that the Crusaders where trying to deter our beliefs. Because of this concept of unity of G-d, many connected the requirement to say Aleinu only during those tefillot that had Shema, as they saw a relationship of the two. Thus, since Mincha had no Shema, they did not recite Aleinu at the end of Mincha.</p>\n\n<p>Note that Eliyahu Rabba 237:4 says that even if one has said Aleinu individually, one who joins a congregation later on, must say Aleinu with the congregation.</p>\n\n<p>So, it seems that we are following the latest custom, and it would seem that reciting Aleinu is definitely \"communal\". </p>\n\n\n",

It should have said, \"שהי' חתום\" - \"that was <em>sealed</em>?\" From this we may deduce that when the Hasmoneans entered the Beit Hamikdash, their eyes beheld a fascinating phenomenon. They saw one cruse of oil, and it was lying together with the precious golden signet ring of the Kohen Gadol.

Normally, the oil used for this offering would be of lower quality than that used for the kindling of the Menorah. However, the Kohen Gadol in that time was a highly distinguished spiritual personality, and a mehader bemitzvot — scrupulous in mitzvot — who used pure olive oil for his daily sacrifice. When the Hasmoneans entered the Beit Hamikdash, they did not find any oil to kindle the Menorah.

It must be that they returned it to the Beis HaBad (the place where they pressed the oil) to have it refilled. To avoid those drops becoming Tamei on the way, he, the Kohen Godol, sealed the jug <strong>with his seal</strong>. It was such a jug which they found and miraculously the menorah burned the first night from those drops. (This of course also answers the famous question of the Beis Yosef as to why there are 8 days Chanuka if the miracle only took place 7 days).

Why did it take 8 days to make new oil for the menorah? The normal process for making oil doesn't take that long. Furthermore the talmud (peah) discusses olive trees who's produce is so full that oil literally leaks out. Couldn't they have accessed usable oil more quickly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>There are two explanations provided for the eight day delay in getting new ritually pure oil.</p>\n\n<p>One opinion is that the oil was produced in a region that was a four day journey from Jerusalem. This is the explanation of the Ran on Shabbos 21b. The Meiri identifies the oil producing region as Tekoa. </p>\n\n<p>The other opinion is that the delay was because they were all in a state of <em>tumas meis</em> - ritual impurity resulting from contact with a dead body, and it takes seven days to be purified from such <em>tumah</em>. Only after they were <em>tahor</em> - ritually pure - would they be able to produce ritually pure oil.

Nevertheless, they were obligated to immediately restore normal production of pure oil taken from where they normally got the most choice oil, which took eight days for the reasons mentioned in the previous answer.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the miracle of the oil of Chanukah was that they did not have to resort to a second best lighting of the menorah because the oil miraculously burned long enough until the production of the best oil was restored.</p>\n\n\n",

This is even better since once you've done one Mitzvah with this Ner, another Mitzvah should also be done with it. </p>\n\n<p>If they are speaking about the normal candle used for Havdallah which is supposed to be \"avukah\" (like a torch -- See OC Siman 298 Sif 2) then how could this be used for Channukah afterwards? The Ner channukah shouldn't be like a torch -- or like the wording of the poskim over here in Hilchos Channukah, like a madurah. (See Siman 671 Sif 4 in the Rema.) I'm assuming whether this candle would be called avukah or a madurah for the same reason it wouldn't be good for Ner Channukah.</p>\n\n<p>Seemingly the language that the Mishneh Brurah in Hilchos Channukah Siman 681 uses that one is allowed to first light the \"Ner Channukah\" for Havdallah is telling us that this is a \"normal Ner\", kosher to use for Channukah. However if that's the case (and there is no difficulty with how a avukah candle is being used for Ner Channukah) why would the Bach and Ateres Zakanim want to give up the milah of avukah by the ner for Havdallah in order to get the advantage of using one ner for 2 mitzvos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See Pri Chadash 671:4 that distinguishes between an אבוקה (torch) and a מדורה (bonfire) - Shulchan Aruch 671:4 only invalidates a מדורה and therefore an אבוקה of just two wicks is permitted (see also Magen Avraham S\"K 4).

He should allow them to partake of all the food and drink he serves. This was the practice of the Sages of the first generations who would give their slaves from every dish of which they themselves would partake. And they would provide food for their animals and slaves before partaking of their own meals.

If not, can one enter a non-kosher restaurant to use their restroom or sit down at a meeting without eating anything?</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein <em>zt\"l</em><sup>[41]</sup> was asked if it is permitted to eat kosher food in a non-kosher dairy restaurant. [<em>Igros Moshe</em> O.C. 2:40; see the final paragraph in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=918&st=&pgnum=229\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the original Hebrew</a> or <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22622/what-does-r-feinstein-say-about-eating-kosher-food-in-a-non-kosher-restaurant#22704\">translation</a>.] His unequivocal response was to [usually] forbid \"going into the restaurant to eat even food that is known to be kosher\". Some have understood that Rav Moshe intended to prohibit even going into a non-kosher restaurant, perhaps even to use the restroom.<sup>[42]</sup> [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>A careful reading of Rav Moshe's response indicates that he did not forbid entering into the restaurant. Rather, he is addressing a scenario where someone is ordering food from the non-kosher establishment and eating it. In that case, the onlooker would perceive that he was being served [non-kosher] food by the restaurant. It is not clear that Rav Moshe would forbid entering the restaurant or even sitting down to eat one's own food or even pre-packaged food that is served by the restaurant since there is a clear differentiation between your food and the regular non-kosher food. Furthermore, pre-packaged kosher meals have become a popular item in the kosher catering industry. Perhaps this new phenomenon alleviates to concern of maris ayin since it is now well-known that this option is available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In an article entitled <a href=\"http://www.waybackmachine.org/web/www.nishmat.net/article.php?id=4&heading=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Keeping Kosher – Eating Out\"</a>, a disciple of R' Yehuda Herzl Henkin named <a href=\"http://www.english.machonmeir.net/torah-lessons-archive?view=rabi&id=18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' David Sperling</a> adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I heard from Rav Y.H. Henkin, <em>shlitah</em>, that even according to the opinion of Rav Feinstein, one could enter a non-kosher restaurant to use the bathroom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hmmm. Rav Feinstein told the hungry querent to normally not even enter non-kosher restaurants. Personally, I suspect that the querent wasn't very religious; maybe Rav Feinstein said this in order to keep the querent away from temptation.</p>\n\n<p>R' Heber is right. Some rabbis seem to understand the responsum's last sentence to be telling the whole world \"One normally should not enter a non-kosher restaurant\". For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>R' Yirmiyohu Kaganoff. <a href=\"http://e.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/shiur.asp?id=6425\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Marit Ayin\"</a>.

Summer 2009. Sub voce: \"It would seem that\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How could these rabbis take a responsum written to an individual and generalize the answer to apply to the whole world? Might they be doing so because they feel it's less risky to be strict? Might it be less effort for them to be strict? Might there be some other reason?</p>\n\n<p>As always, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">CYLOR</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How was Saul a Tzadik if he wiped out Nov?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've read many commentaries that argue that despite losing the kingdom, Saul is a righteous guy.</p>\n\n<p>But how, after he mass murdered priests (Samuel 1 <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a21.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">21</a>-22)? To be more exact, he ordered priests to be mass murdered for giving aid to David. He didn't do it himself, but he ordered it. Isn't that a major capital crime?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>To begin with, Saul only ordered the execution of Achimelekh's <em>Beit Av</em>( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a22.htm#16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Samuel I 22:16</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר המלך, מות תמות אחימלך:  אתה, וכל-בית אביך<br>\n  And the king said: 'Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The massacre at Nov was Doeg's own initiative( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a22.htm#18\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid. 22:18-19</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר המלך, לדויג (לדואג), סב אתה, ופגע בכהנים; ויסב דויג (דואג) האדמי, ויפגע-הוא בכהנים, וימת ביום ההוא שמנים וחמשה איש, נשא אפוד בד<br>\n  And the king said to Doeg: 'Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.' And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and he slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.<br>\n  ואת נב עיר-הכהנים, הכה לפי-חרב, מאיש ועד-אשה, מעולל ועד-יונק; ושור וחמור ושה, לפי-חרב<br>\n  And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as executing Achimelekh's <em>Beit Av</em>( \"father's house\") itself goes, two others played major roles in bringing it about:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Doeg the Edomite, who fearing Saul's rage after the latter accusing his men - even his fellow tribesmen - of conspiring against him with his son Jonathan( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a22.htm#6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid 22:6-8</a>), especially after he'd seen David at Nov( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a21.htm#8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid 21:8</a>), and didn't mention it at the time, decided to shift the accusation to Achimelekh, even falsely accusing him of having \"inquired of the LORD\" for David( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a22.htm#9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid 22:9-10</a>). Based on his testimony, Saul judged and executed the priests.</li>\n<li>David, when he arrived at Nov, lied to Achimelekh, saying that he is on the king's mission( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a21.htm#3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid 21:3</a>), and in asking for food and a sword, made Achimelekh an accessory to his \"crime\". He latter even admitted his complicency in the affair to Abiathar, who escaped the massacre( <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08a22.htm#22\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ibid 22:22</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So Saul's actual crime here was accepting Doeg's testimony over Achimelekh's.</p>\n\n<p>As such, his evil deeds are usually reconciled with him being under the influence of the <em>Ru'ach Ra'ah</em>, and not fully responsible for his actions( see <a href=\"http://www.kipa.co.il/ask/show/189666-%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9A\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/shiur.asp?id=5146\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It may be worth mentioning that <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25a10.htm#13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chronicles I 10:13-14</a> mentions only Saul's failure to fulfill God's command in the war against <em>Amaleq</em>, and especially him inquiring in <em>Ov</em> and not in <em>ha-Shem</em>, as the transgressions for which he died, but does not mention the massacre at Nov.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=3&daf=53b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eiruvin 53b</a> on the top of the page, R' Yochanan says that Hashem forgave Shaul for the crime of killing Nov the city of Kohanim. </p>\n\n<p>All the previous comments saying he was a tsadik and was allowed to kill them are not upheld by this Gemoro. I haven't seen a comment mentioning this. It seems his death in the battle was his atonement. Will give a much longer post about this later, exactly what sin he was being forgiven for. His sins included not killing Amalek, and going to the sorcerer, how does rashi know which one it is? And also we see in the time of David's kingship his sin was not yet forgiven since David had to kill many of Saul's children to appease the Givonim. He was forgiven because he went to war knowing he would be killed. The midrash vayikro 27:6 seems to imply this.</p>\n\n<p>I will go into it in quite some detail. It is very interesting but possibly written too briefly.\nThe rdak says like rashi that it was the sin of NOV but asks that we never find it mentioned in the posuk that it was considered a sin against him. Only that he killed the givonim not the kohanim. And he says that most likely the kohanim deserved death although the posuk doesnt tell us why.</p>\n\n<p>The maharsha says it must have been the sin of NOV because he has already been punished for not killing amalek by having David made king instead of his son.\nIn midrash vayikra 26:7 and the meforshim it says that saul had five or six sins including killing the kohanim and not waiting for shmuel for seven days.\nThe ben yehoyodo says it carries on from the earlier gemoro that saul made 'mistakes' in learning and halocho. That was referring to not killing the animals of amalek saying they hadnt sinned, therefore this is the sin involved not like rashi.</p>\n\n<p>The gaon yaakov in a similar vein also says it carries on from the earlier gemoro that he made mistakes in halacha. Therefore david became king, therefore he had to run away from him therefore NOV gave him to eat and therefore he killed NOV. And the sin being NOV.</p>\n\n<p>The chida in  <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40654&st=&pgnum=184\" rel=\"nofollow\">pesach einaim</a> has it much simpler. Again a mistake in halacha but a different one. When david went to NOV he used the urim v'tumim which saul held are only allowed to be used by a king therefore he killed NOV. But this was a mistake in halacha since they can be used by others at certain times. So the sin was NOV and the previous gemoro also NOV.\nWhy the gemoro says he was forgiven when his children has still to suffer and be killed, they say he wasnt totally forgiven only enough to be able to join shmuel in heaven. Or one can say he was only forgiven for the kohanim but not the givonim.</p>\n\n<p>This post  is of course quite a shortened version of what ought to be a comprehensive daf yomi shiur.\nI must add that I dont understand the rdak properly. One of his proofs that the kohanim 'deserved' it and saul was not to blame is since we dont see that their death was avenged like with the givonim. But the reason for that is because he was forgiven, because he went into battle knowing he would be killed. Maybe he means that if it was a real sin that wouldnt be enough.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Ralbag explains that Saul is not considered to have sinned here, since he was merely fulfilling God’s promised punishment to the house of Eli:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה מה׳ ית׳ היתה נסבה להביא העונש אשר יעד לבית עלי ולזה לא מצאנו שנענש שאול על הריגתם ולא נזכר לו זה הענין כשנזכרו עוונותיו</p>\n<p>And behold this was arranged by God may He be exalted to bring the punishment that He had promised to the house of Eli. And for this [reason] we don’t find that Saul was punished for their killing, and this event is not mentioned as a sin when his sins are mentioned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולזה לא מצאנו שנענש שאול בהריגת נוב עיר הכהנים ואף על פי שלא היתה שם סיבה תביא להורגם בזה האופן כי גם אחימלך לא חטא כלל כנגד שאול כמו שספר לו כל שכן שלא חטאו לו כל בית אביו שהרג עמו ולזה תמצא שלא נזכר זה החטא עם יתר חטאי שאול כי ה׳ הסיתהו בו לקיים יעודו</p>\n<p>And for this [reason] we do not find that Saul was punished for killing Nov the city of priests, and even though there was no cause for killing them in this manner — even Achimelech did not sin at all against Saul, as he told him, [and] certainly the entire house of his father that [Saul] killed with him did not sin to [Saul]. And for this [reason] you find that this sin is not mentioned with the other sins of Saul, for God incited him to fulfill His promise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Therefore, if two ordinary Jews marry each other, the child takes the father’s status. Ex: if a Kohen marries the daughter of a Yisrael, the child is a Kohen. \n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>If the marriage is binding according to Jewish law, but there is a sin in the union, the child’s status follows the one whose status causes the sin. Ex: if a Mamzer marries an ordinary Jew, the child is a Mamzer, regardless of whether it’s the father or the mother who’s a Mamzer. </li>\n<li>If the marriage is not binding according to Jewish law, but it would be binding if each spouse married someone else, the child is a Mamzer. Ex: if a man married his sister, the child is a Mamzer, because each one can marry other ordinary Jews legally. </li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The one relevant to the question is the fourth category: where marriage is not binding according to Jewish law <em>no matter which Jew one of the spouses marries.</em> In such a case, the child’s status follows the <em>mother,</em> not the father. One example brought in the Mishnah is if a non-Jewish woman has a union a Jewish man.</p>\n\n<p>As such, the child is fully Jewish if born from any of the first three types of unions, but he would potentially have a stigma on his lineage depending on the case. In the fourth type of union, though, the child is not Jewish since his mother isn’t Jewish. If he’s not Jewish, there’s no commandment to circumcise him!</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Making a Seudah into a \"Seudas Mitzvah\"",
    "content": "# Making a Seudah into a \"Seudas Mitzvah\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rema in Hilchos Channukah <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&st=&pgnum=274\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siman 670 Sif 2</a> writes that if zemiros and shvachos (songs and praise) are said by a Seudah on Channukah it becomes a \"Seudas Mitzvah\" (without this it only has in it \"katzas mitzvah\" according to the Rema. Or according to the Machaber is a seudas reshus.) The M\"A there in Sif-Katan Daled says so to by the marriage of a bas Talmud Chacham to an Am HaAretz if shiras are said then it becomes a seudas mitzvah. What about a seudah in general that is made in the middle of the week, at no special time of the year. If I get a few friends together and sing zemiros v'shvachos does the seudah become a seudas mitzvah? Or is it only when there is an \"additional factor\" or reason that in and of itself doesn't make the seuda a seudas mitzvah, only together with the singing would it become a seudas mitzvah that the status of the seudah can be turned over.</p>\n\n<p>If it's yes only when there is an additional factor, then what would be more examples and what are the requirements exactly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>After introducing the basic reasons for Chanukah, the <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכן י\"א שמצוה להרבות קצת בסעודה בחנוכה, ועוד מפני שמלאכת המשכן נגמר בימים אלו, ויש לספר לב\"ב ענין הניסים שנעשו לאבותנו בימים האלו, <strong>ומ\"מ לא הוי סעודת מצוה אא\"כ אומרים בסעודה שירות ותשבחות</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore, some say that there is a <em>mitzva</em> to increase somewhat in feasting, and also because the work of the <em>mishkan</em> was completed at this time. A person should tell over to his household the miracles that happened for our ancestors during these days. <strong>Nevertheless, it is not a <em>seudas mitzva</em> unless songs and praises are said by the meal.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To me, this language seems to indicate that the \"<em>songs and praises</em>\" only serve as the final condition. Meaning, given all of the previously stated reasons for why a Chanuka <em>seudah</em> should be a <em>mitzva</em>, the \"songs and praises\" are what close the deal. However, without all of those previous reasons, an ordinary meal with \"songs and praises\" would not qualify as a <em>seudas mitzva</em>.</p>\n<p>This conclusion also appears to be explicit in the <em>Mishneh Berurah</em> (670:9), in his comment on the Remah's statement that if the meal is accompanied with songs and praises \"אז הוי סעודת מצוה\" - \"then it is a <em>seudas mitzva</em>\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואז הוי סעודת מצוה - <strong>ר\"ל בצרוף זה</strong>. ... וכתב הרש\"ל שכל שעושה כדי ליתן שבח למקום או לפרסם הנס או המצוה הכל סעודת מצוה</p>\n<p>\"And this is is a <em>seudas mitva</em>\" - Meaning, <strong>in combination with this</strong>. ... And the Maharshal writes that any [<em>seuda</em>] made to give praise to God, or to publicize the miracle, or to publicize the <em>mitzva</em>, is a <em>seudas mitzva</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The statement, \"in combination with this\", seems to clearly indicate that songs and praises by themselves cannot make a meal into a <em>seudas mitzva</em>. It is only when they are combined with other factors.</p>\n<p>As for the underlying reasoning behind this, it seems that the basic definition of a <em>seudas mitzva</em> is a meal that one is specifically supposed to eat in fulfillment of a <em>mitzva</em>. This includes all Shabbos and Yom Tov meals, as well as meals associated with other <em>mitzvos</em>, such as a <em>bris</em>, a <em>chasuna</em>, or a <em>siyum</em>. In all of these cases, there is a <em>mitzva</em>, and often an outright obligation, to participate in the <em>seudah</em>. In other words, for a meal to be a true <em>seudas mitzva</em>, the seudah must qualify intrinsically as a <em>mitzva</em> (i.e. the <em>mitzva</em> is to eat).</p>\n<p>By this definition, it is obvious that an ordinary meal with friends cannot become a <em>seudas mitzva</em> simply by adding \"songs and praises\". While singing songs and praises of God at an ordinary meal may be a very praiseworthy, they would not make the meal itself into a <em>mitzva</em>.</p>\n<p>Chanuka, however, is a rather ambiguous case. Since there is apparently no actual obligation to make a <em>seuda</em> on Chanuka, all Chanuka meals would be considered <em>seudas reshus</em>. However, being that there are sources that indicate it <em>is</em> a <em>mitzva</em> to feast on Chanuka, when a Chanuka meal is combined with other factors (i.e. publicizing the miracle and singing praises to God), we do consider it a <em>seudas mitzva</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>I just looked up the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40932&st=&pgnum=150&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharshal in <em>Yam Shel Shlomo</em> (<em>Bava Kama</em> 7:37)</a>. The Maharshal writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא נראה כל סעודה שאדם עושה שלא כדרך מריעות ושמחה, אלא כדי ליתן שבח למקום או לפרסם המצוה או לפרסם הנס קרוי סעודת מצוה, כגון פדיון הבן לפרסם המצוה</p>\n<p>Rather, it seems that any <em>seudah</em> that a person makes, not in the manner of friendship and rejoicing, but for the purpose of giving praise to God, or to publicize [the performance of] a <em>mitzva</em>, or to publicize a miracle, is called a <em>seudas mitzva</em>, such as [the <em>seuda</em> by] a <em>pidyon haben</em>, which is to publicize a <em>mitzva</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maharshal appears to be saying that everything depends on the purpose of the meal. This is not fully in agreement with the approach I presented above. I argued that there needs to be some intrinsic aspect of <em>mitzva</em> in the meal, but the Maharshal is saying that one can indeed simply create a <em>seudas mitzva</em>. However, even according to the Maharshal, the purpose of the meal must be the <em>mitzva</em>. One cannot simply convert an ordinary meal into a <em>seudas mitzva</em> by including praises of God.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, the Maharshal also states, later in the same discussion, that there is a <em>mitzva</em> of <em>seudah</em> on Chanuka, and the <em>seudos</em> of Chanuka are <em>seudos mitzva</em> in their own right.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49628&st=&pgnum=274\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishnah Brurah 9</a> says in the name of Maharshal that any meal made for the purpose of publicizing a mitzvah or to give praise to Hashem is a se'udas mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the rabbis and the Rav that I learned from, one cannot simply declare a seudat mitzvah by including praises of HaShem. We praise HaShem anyways when we bentsch. Even Rosh Chodesh meals are not considered seudat mitzvot according to my Rav.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the Mesillas Yesharim so popular and accepted?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>To overgeneralize, I bet there is a copy of the mesillas yesharim in almost every orthodox home, shul and beis medrash. I'm wondering why this work is so popular and accepted.</p>\n\n<p>My wondering is prompted by two possible objections to this work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The author, the Ramchal, has been the subject of controversy, including suspicion of having sympathies to Shabbtai Tzvi (see <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/luzzatto.html\">paragraph 5</a> for a concise summary) and for believing that he was the messiah (see, for example <a href=\"http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2010/06/02/isaiah-tishby-messianic-mysticism-moses-hayim-luzzatto-and-the-padua-school/\">his ketubah</a>). </p></li>\n<li><p>The content itself may be difficult to use as a tool for personal development. Any reader would be hard pressed to believe that he has progressed past the first few stages outlined in this work. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What is it about the Messilas Yesharim that makes it so universally accepted as a classic work?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>The <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> is certainly one of the most influential and popular <em>seforim</em> ever written. It is considered a basic text in most <em>yeshivos</em> and is widely studied by Jews throughout the world (both in the original language and in translation).</p>\n\n<p>Before we can address the reasons for the immense popularity of this work, we first need to address one of the specific concerns mentioned in question. The question mentions that accusations were made against the Ramchal (R' Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, author of <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em>) in his lifetime that for improper involvement in mystical practices and even Sabbatianism (adherence to one of the heretical cults based on the false messiah, Sabbatai Zvi). The question asks how it can be that a work from such a controversial figure could have become so widely accepted within the traditional/Orthodox community.</p>\n\n<p>The reality is, however, that the Jewish community has accepted that these accusations were incorrect. The fact that major figures such as the Vilna Gaon strongly endorsed the Ramchal and his works served to completely clear any suspicion from his name. The conventional opinion within the Orthodox community is that, as is often the case with complex figures (and the Ramchal was certainly a complex figure), especially those deeply involved with kabbalah and mysticism, the Ramchal was simply misunderstood. (The Ramchal was not unique in this regard; R' Yonason Eibshutz is another example of a major figure accused of Sabbatianism, whose works are fully accepted today, and for largely the same reason.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the accusations against the Ramchal have not been given any credence within the religious Jewish world for well over two centuries, and are simply considered an unfortunate aspect of history.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the fact that the Ramchal is not viewed as a controversial figure does not, in of itself, explain why the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> became so popular. In fact, the Ramchal himself wrote many works, and while some are fairly popular, none of them comes close to the extraordinary popularity that the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> has enjoyed for more than two centuries.</p>\n\n<p>I don't believe there are any definite answers to this question. Clearly, the fact that the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> was enthusiastically endorsed by numerous major rabbinic figures over the years has played a large role in its general popularity. However, asides from the fact that this does not explain why the book received such enthusiastic endorsements, it also fails to really explain the work's general popularity as well. There have been many works over the years that have been enthusiastically endorsed by major figures, that failed to really gain general popularity. The main reason people are aware of the endorsements given to the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> is that people are reading and talking about the book.</p>\n\n<p>So what was it about the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> that set it apart from all the other classic <em>mussar</em> works, none of which enjoys a popularity that even approaches that of the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em>? In my opinion, there is one major factor, above and beyond all others, that made the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> a truly unique work in its time, and which continues to contribute to its immense popularity.</p>\n\n<p>This factor is that, unlike virtually all previous <em>mussar</em> works, the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> refrains entirely from both harsh, condemnatory language directed at the reader, and also refrains from lengthy technical discussions. On the contrary, the work continually stresses that every positive step, no matter how small, is actually a major achievement, and that even one who attains to only the lowest of the levels described in the book has done something extraordinary. </p>\n\n<p>With many earlier works, one can walk away with a sense of despair or even fear. (An very religious elderly woman once told me that she could never read <em>Shaarei Teshuva</em> because it was too frightening.) Other works, such as the <em>Chovos Halevovos</em>, are written more in the style of philosophical works than as guides to self-improvement. In both cases, what the reader does not get is the sense of a supportive and understanding mentor that clearly comes through with the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In writing the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> in this manner, the Ramchal demonstrated a deep sensitivity to the changes that were taking place in society (both Jewish society and society at large). While earlier generations apparently found the older style <em>mussar seforim</em> effective, in the modern world a very different approach was necessary. The <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> was thus, in many ways, the first modern Hebrew work. (Indeed, the early maskilim were great admirers of the Ramchal, and the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em>, for this very reason.)</p>\n\n<p>Given this, it is not surprising that the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> was a huge \"hit\" and became the most popular <em>mussar</em> work of all time.</p>\n\n<p>There is one more issue that is raised in the question that needs to be addressed. Anyone who has studied the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> will quickly recognize that, of the nine levels he describes, few people ever attain much beyond the first two. That being so, what is the point of studying the later sections?</p>\n\n<p>I recently discussed this topic with my <em>rebbi</em>, who is himself a long-time student of the <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em>. In the discussion, we came to three basic reasons why the later sections of <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em> are relevant to every Jew.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\"You can't begin a journey if you don't know where you are going.\" Meaning, even when you are still on a lower levels, the knowledge of what you are working to eventually achieve on the higher levels still has a major impact.</li>\n<li>Spiritual growth is often uneven. There are always some areas in which we are stronger than in other areas. Thus, it is possible that while a person may have only achieved the first or second level in certain regards, he is nevertheless on level 5 or 6 in other areas. A person should not restrict his spiritual growth in one area, while he waits for his weakest areas to \"catch up\".</li>\n<li>It is important for us to understand what true spirituality is, so that we will be able to recognize it (or its absence) in the people around us. Even if we have not achieved the highest levels described in <em>Mesillas Yesharim</em>, if we study them we will at least be able to recognize such greatness when we encounter it in another person, and we will also be able to recognize its absence in those who put on false pretenses of holiness.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Many great Tzadikim have praised the Mesilas Yesharim and have said that all they attained was due to learning from it. This includes the Vilna Gaon, Bnei Yissochor, Rabbi Chaim Volozhin, Koznitzer Maggid, and the Opter Maggid. (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51471&hilite=864b56d1-e4bd-414c-9a5e-75680daef083&st=%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%AA+%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D&pgnum=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.) The fact that it was accepted by all, Misnagdim and Chasidim, attests to the greatness of this sefer. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think it's popularity and endorsement by the Rabbis is greatly due to two factors.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>it shows each person exactly where he is in the road map of spiritual progress and also who are the real tzadikim and who are not (yet) tzadikim.</p></li>\n<li><p>it describes the correct order to take in the spiritual journey.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This latter point is also extremely important. There is a danger in trying to reach lofty levels of piety without having firm foundations in the basic levels.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, it is a book you can recommend to anyone without fear that he will mistakenly try to jump rungs on the ladder and wind up crashing down or worse that he will float away in the clouds of false \"piety\" or emotional highs.</p>\n\n<p>These two points are essential foundations for everyone, hence its popularity.</p>\n\n\n",

If someone would rather avoid the painkillers because their side effects (e.g. constipation) are worse than the pain, that's one thing. If there are theoretically no side effects and someone just wants to suffer, that's more of a philosophical question. Recall that Judaism is not a faith that values suffering per se -- we value strong commitments, and an ability to overcome suffering is a sign of great commitment. (Rabbi Shalom Carmy has an essay about this in regards to the \"December dilemma\" -- I don't want my kids to feel one iota of deprivation for being Jews, so I'll shower them with consumer junk every December and call it \"Hanukah celebration.\" Then my kids never learn that Judaism can be worth it even if it's not always so easy.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hershel Schachter is of the opinion that decisions whether to pursue medical treatment are left up to the patient, within a range of what's considered reasonable.

A 20-year-old will live to 70 if he has a limb amputated now, or else he'll die within a year? There's only one \"reasonable\" choice here.

Responsa Yaskil Avdi Yoreh Deah 20 says that k'li gever isn't violated unless the clothes is distinctly made for one gender.</p>\n\n<p>Also I can't remember the exact source (it might be from the Gemara or a Rishon) but I think there was a rabbi who had a shawl that would be worn both by him and his wife, and the reason they were both allowed to wear the same thing was that it was gender-neutral clothing.</p>\n\n\n",

As discussed at <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/weekly_torah.php?id=19\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/weekly_torah.php?id=19</a>, there are differing views as to what to do if you have no hat, some holding that you should daven alone if you can't find a hat (and you can't use someone else's hat without permission).  Assuming that that is the rationale for wearing a hat on weekdays during prayer, kal v'homer (how much more so) must it be true that a nicer, special hat should be worn for Shabbos, just as you would wear nicer clothes on Shabbos to be kavod haShabbos.  Some Hasidim take this a little further and wear streimels (fur-brimmed hats) because in the 18th and 19th centuries in Eastern Europe, that was very impressive.</p>\n\n\n",

The Holy One, blessed be He, said: <strong>I am alone in My world and this one (Adam) also is alone in his world</strong>. There is no propagation before Me and this one (Adam) has no propagation in his life; hereafter all the creatures will say: Since there was no propagation in his life, it is he who has created us. It is not good for man to be alone, as it is said, \"And the Lord God said, It is not good for man to be alone; I will make him an help meet for him …\" (Gen. 2:18).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After Adam sinned, both he and his wife Chava were punished with having a finite life (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.19?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 3:19</a>). Furthermore, Chava was punished with 9 month pregnancy instead of giving birth immediately (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.16?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 3:16</a>). Consequently, Adam had a finite number of descendads and all of them had a finite life. As a result, only a finite number of people can exist now.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Why was Adam created alone? Why a woman was not created along with but separately from a man?

One who honors his/her parents fulfills the saying of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.97.11?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 97:11</a> Light is sown for the righteous, radiance for the upright. And one who does not honor parents let him/her be enlightenment (מאירה) from what's is fitting for him/her as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.3.33?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 3:33</a> <em>the curse (מארת) of the LORD is on the house of the wicked, but He blesses the abode of the righteous</em>. Another explanation: for a man his Father and Mother are likened to celestial lights (because they illuminate his path in life) as it is written in Yosef's dream <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.37.9?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 37:9</a>: <em>And this time, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In connection with the Sun and the Moon, gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.60b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chulin 60b</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi raises a contradiction between two verses. It is written: “And God made the two great lights” (Genesis 1:16), and it is also written in the same verse: “The greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night,” indicating that only one was great. Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi explains: When God first created the sun and the moon, they were equally bright. Then, the moon said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, is it possible for two kings to serve with one crown? One of us must be subservient to the other. God therefore said to her, i.e., the moon: If so, go and diminish yourself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus we see, that just like there cannot be two kings serving with one crown in the sky (which was clarified on day 4), there cannot be two kings serving with one crown on the Earth (which became apparent on day 6). Thus Hashem created a single Adam who was both male and female, but the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/144920/36610\">female component was suppressed</a> like the Moon. It was later separated.

Some say it diminishes the Divine Image, as it is stated: “Because He created man in the image of God” (Genesis 9:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

These names refer to five different levels and types of revelation within the soul of a person, with the highest level being the Yechida. This level of the soul is totally united with G-d. With the coming of Shabbos, this deepest level of a person's soul, the Yechida, is revealed within the person. This is the Additional Soul we are given on Shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>It is not felt as an increase in physical life, but rather, an increase in the spiritual life force of a person: There are two types of love for G-d; one type of love is born out of contemplation of the greatness and oneness of G-d. The second is a love that is not born out of contemplation and intellect. Rather, it is a love for G-d that transcends intellect. This deep and unbounded love for G-d is the experience of our Additional Soul on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>neshama yeterah doesn't literally mean \"an extra soul\", it means \"extra soul\" as if the amount of soul that you have is continuous.  the conceptualization is for example that you have less soul when you are tired or angry and more soul when you are at rest.  see footnote 5 on neshama yeterah in the tenth chapter of The Sabbath by Heschel <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/31h0C.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

If someone had a <em>shailo</em> they went to the <em>beis medresh</em>. Nowadays, <em>batei medreshim</em> are filled with either <em>avreichim</em> in kollel, <em>yeshiva bachurim</em>, or <em>baalei batim</em> that spend some of their time learning. Generally no one in these groups of people would be qualified (or \"certified\") to answer <em>shailos</em> in <em>halacha</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this is why things changed? Along with the fact that a city used to have maybe one <em>rov</em> or each <em>kehillah</em> had a <em>rov</em> for themselves.

Mashiach will \"smell and judge,\" (Sanhedrin 93b above).

Countless commentaries and volumes have been written on finding the Rambam's sources. A contemporary example is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Kanievsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky</a>'s קרית מלך. It's a small volume, and very concise, so it takes some work to figure why he considers a particular text the source for a halacha in the Mishneh Torah. In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49930&st=&pgnum=42\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that volume</a> he points to the end of the <a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/tanhuma/toldot.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma in Toldot</a> and comments \"צריך עיון\" which indicates that even that source is not so clear.</p>\n<p>That Midrash lists the virtues of the Messiah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונשא ממשה שאמר (במדבר יא) כי תאמר אלי שאהו בחיקך</p>\n<p>\"[And he'll be] loftier than Moses, as it's written (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%99%D7%90_%D7%99%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num. 11:12</a>) \"[Did I conceive this entire people? Did I give birth to them,] that You say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom [as the nurse carries the suckling,' to the Land You promised their forefathers?]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(It seems to me, that the Midrash is indicating that the Messiah is greater that Moses in that he will bring Israel into the Promised Land- something that Moses did not do.)\nBut it's not clear what this verse has to do with prophecy. (And that's probably why R' Kanievsky writes \"צריך עיון\"- the Midrash contrasts Moses' greatness with the Messiah, but not necessarily in regards to prophecy.)</p>\n<p>Indeed this very question is dealt with by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Tzvi Hirsch Chajes</a> in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1023&pgnum=458\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אגרת בקורת</a>. Here too he struggles to find a source. He also mentions the above cited Midrash as a possibility, but rejects it for the reason I mentioned above: the Midrash is referring to some virtue that the Messiah has above Moses- but it can't be prophecy for we know that וְלֹא קָם נָבִיא עוֹד .בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל כְּמֹשֶׁה (Indeed the Rambam repeats this principle in his commentary on Tractate Sanhedrin and in Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah.)\nThe מהרי\"ץ חיות then states that he's unaware of any source that states that the Messiah will be a prophet, rather he will be Divinely inspired as stated in Isaiah (cited in the question) and other verses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>באמת לא אדע המקום אשר מפורש בו שמלך המשיח יהי׳ גם כן נביא, רק שרוח\nהקודש תנוח עליו ויתיחסו על פיו,\nוזה מבואר בפסוק ישעיה ו׳, ונחה עליו רוח ד', ובפסוקים אחרים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The מהרי\"ץ חיות then cites the Rambam in the <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp132.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Guide For the Perplexed</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second degree [of prophecy] is this: A person feels as if\nsomething came upon him, and as if he had received a new power that\nencourages him to speak. He treats of science, or composes hymns,\nexhorts his fellow-men, discusses political and theological problems;\nall this he does while awake, and in the full possession of his\nsenses. Such a person is said to speak by the holy spirit. David\ncomposed the Psalms, and Solomon the Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,\nand the Song of Solomon by this spirit; also Daniel, Job, Chronicles,\nand the rest of the Hagiographa were written in this holy spirit;\ntherefore they are called ketubim (Writings, or Written), i.e.,\nwritten by men inspired by the holy spirit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם יקרא בקצת העתים נביא הוא לקצת כללות להיותו קרוב לנביאים מאוד אשר\nמפני זה גם סדר דניאל וכתובים היו רק בעלי רוח הקודש אבל בכל זאת נקרא\nנביאים בכלל יש לומר באמת כי משיח לא יהיה נביא ומש״כ הרמב״ם נביא פי׳\nשרוח הקודש יהיה עליו ובמעלה הזאת יהיה קרוב למשה אבל לא נביא ממש</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, these individuals (David, Solomon & Daniel) are called prophets because that have achieved a level that is very close to real prophecy. Perhaps, R' Chajes concludes, Moshiach need not be a prophet, but must reach a level close to prophecy through his attainment of Divine inspiration- and thus approaches the level of Moses, while still not technically being a prophet. (i.e. when the Rambam writes \"prophet\" in the Laws of Repentance, he's using the term loosely.)</p>\n<p>Return to your original question, it would appear that the verse in Isaiah could not necessarily prove that the Messiah will be a prophet, rather it shows that he will attain the lesser \"prophecy\" of Divine inspiration.</p>\n\n\n",

When the Chosson came to purchase the ring, the store owner made a mistake and gave him a ring that was a size smaller (7 in the example). He was m'kadesh his Kallah with this ring, which she later noticed was not the ring she had picked out because it was too small. Is there any problem with the Kiddushin since this in fact is not the ring that the Chosson had intended on buying or wanted to buy? Was there any halachic problem with the sale that would tell me that the ring in fact didn't belong to the Chosson and thus there would be a problem with the Kedushin?

Nor, given church-state separation, could any chief rabbi expect governmental recognition, much less the kind of authority that some European chief rabbis wielded. Finally, many Americans of the day, Jews among them, were deeply suspicious of strong central authority. The \"tyranny of the majority,\" they feared, would soon come trampling down on the rights of the minority, be they southerners or religious reformers. As a result, all efforts aimed at electing a chief rabbi ended in failure, and the decentralized congregationalist polity that characterized American Judaism since the Revolution remained in place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There were a number of US cities that had Chief Rabbis, but the last one, Rabbi Shalom Rivkin of St Louis, MO, passed away in October of 2011 (<a href=\"http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_ef8f9ff4-edee-11e0-823c-0019bb30f31a.html#ixzz1dQ7spM2E\" rel=\"noreferrer\">source</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Similar <a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/no-place-for-a-chief-rabbi/2012/12/26/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sentiment</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The point is that most Jews have not shown much interest in surrendering even a wit of their religious autonomy to their clergy.

In the interwar period, Rabbi Tobias Geffen of Atlanta was revered both in that city and all over the South. In more recent times, Rabbi Pinchas Teitz, who unquestionably held sway among his minions in Elizabeth, N.J., comes to mind.

However, there is another Halacha along the same premise that says if Roiv (a majority) of the food is Kosher, then the Unkosher food is nullified.

This <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18469/honor-parents-who-want-you-to-violate-halacha\">does not apply</a> when fulfilling their requests violates halacha.  I suspect that many parents of converts, who are not knowledgable in halacha and probably don't care to be, would not really understand or accept a halachic response.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Christian or nominally-Christian parents, there can be tensions in late December.  Whether Christianity is avodah zarah is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89/is-christianity-avodah-zara\">controversial</a>.  One seemingly-non-religious aspect of their holiday is giving gifts, which is typically done at family gatherings (not privately).  <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12219/472\">Leniencies appear to exist in the workplace</a>, so one might say \"if so, how much the moreso for parents?\".  While we are not supposed to give gentiles gifts before their holiday, it <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12220/472\">has been argued</a> that we aren't necessarily concerned about prompting their worship by giving gifts (they don't tend to see the gifts as religious).  On the other hand, and as noted there, there is also the consideration of imitating the ways of non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the converts I know are stumped at this time of year.  Strict halacha seems to say they shouldn't participate in these family gift exchanges, but refusing to do so can cause upset (concerns of <em>shalom bayit</em>).  In some families deferring to a different time of year (e.g. Purim, or emphasizing birthdays instead) is not acceptable to the parents.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: beyond consulting his rabbi (which he should of course do, though the rabbi probably doesn't know the family members), how should a convert weigh these various factors?  How should he decide when to say \"sorry it upsets you Mom, but no\" versus going along with it?  I am looking for practical answers moreso than halachic explanations.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You might be able to preempt the whole thing by linking the gifts to Channukah. Both requesting that you receive gifts <em>only</em> then, and giving them then. (This will be easier when Channukah comes first, so maybe wait for a year when that happens, and then make it a known thing for future years.)</p>\n\n<p>In my local school they suggest giving annual gifts to teachers on Purim instead of Channukah, to avoid it looking like non-Jewish holiday gifts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I almost hate to mention this as it may cause more problems for some, but a convert's parents not no longer considered their halachic parents. (Yevamot, 22a). A convert is, for example, called up to the torah as ploni-ben-avraham or ploni-bat-sarah.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, the people who raised you clearly deserve respect and consideration, even if they don't fall under the law of kavod av v'eim. The principle of kavod habriyot and darchei shalom still implore you to maintain a positive relationship with them, even though it may be somewhat tricky. Life is often a balancing act, and every person will have to figure out for themselves how to balance their parents, their family, their kids (if there are any), and their faith. A lot depends on the individuals involved and it's very hard to give blanket answers beyond the bland statements like \"be mindful of everyone's feelings\".</p>\n\n\n",

Did the river dry up? </p>\n\n<p>I am looking for sources that discuss this concept.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vilna Gaon</a> explains (full text <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Other-Books/Kol-Eliyohu/Mikeitz.html#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) that the reason why each set of cows are described with two descriptions is because there are two different types of famine - רעב and כפן. The former word refers to a time when the fields are not producing good produce, whereas the latter is when the fields are producing good produce but Hashem does not place in the produce the ability to satiate the appetite, like the posuk in Vayikra (26,26) says - “and you shall eat and not be satisfied”.</p>\n\n<p>This is what our posuk means: “handsome appearance”, that is, the appearance of the produce is good, and “robust flesh”, that it satisfies, because the ability to satiate has not been taken from it. But with regard to the bad cows both these qualities are reversed - “bad appearance” and also “lean of flesh”. Thus the famine which was being shown to Pharaoh was to contain both types of famine.</p>\n\n<p>So, the issue was not crop quantity but crop quality, which could be caused by factors other than sufficiency of water.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ancient Egyptain civilization heavily relied on the Nile for sustenance. This included flooding of the Nile river and the various irrigation systems (redirecting water, sometimes 'far') that were built to support agriculture in and around the Nile basin. The river was also used as a transport channel, eventually bridging Lower and Upper Egypt in the 'unification'. Since the reliance on the Nile was so pervasive in all walks of life, changes in conditions could considerably hamper efforts at maintaining a stable harvest and distributing it throughout Egypt.</p>\n<p>If rainfall was low in one particular year (or several years) this could impact transport of crops along the Nile, irrigation of surrounding fields, crop yields, etc. and also lead to conflict. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gea.10065\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> is one example where the authors suggest that a decrease in rainfall led to the fall of the Old Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, different pharaohs and rulers in ancient Egypt had vastly different temperaments. This impacted their social policy. Poor planning together with unexpected climate conditions (and more) could certainly have caused or contributed towards widespread famine or even local famine due poor to distribution.</p>\n<p>Aside: In the modern age, conflicts arising from water disputes are widespread. In one National Geographic (April 2010) edition on Water the authors attributed 30+ wars in the middle-east to be water related in the 20th century. Just for interest: note that Yaakov (and family) came to Egypt and lived in the land of Goshen (partly in the Nile delta) with enough grazing land to support their livestock (despised but tolerated by Egypt, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.46.34?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 46:31-34</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is \"blood that moved from one place to another\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm learning laws of salting in the Shulchan Aruch.  One concept I'm battling to understand is \"דם שפירש ממקום למקום\" - blood that moved from one place to another.  Here's a good example of my confusion: see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9145&st=&pgnum=311\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YD 69:18</a>.  The Shach in ע\"ד says that blood in the flesh that did not move is permitted, but that's only \"if it didn't move at all from its place\".  A simple reading of this seems to imply that the Shach (and most other Rishonim and Acharonim) did not understand the concept of a circulatory system, since they seem to have a concept of a <em>fixed place</em> where each drop of blood belongs, and where it is permitted to eat it - but as soon as that blood moves out of its place, it becomes prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the Mechaber disagrees with this interpretation of דם שפירש ממקום למקום, applying it only to blood the moved between two separate pieces of meat, or at least that exited this piece of meat and was later re-absorbed?  In the argument over whether salting is supposed to remove <em>all</em> the blood or <em>most of</em> the blood, the Rambam comes down on the latter side, which is why he requires <em>chalita</em>, to seal the blood in so that it doesn't leak out when you later cook it.  If that's the case, then he surely cannot agree with the way the Shach understands it, because whatever blood didn't come out with the salting has surely \"moved\" during the process - yet the Rambam permits it!</p>\n\n<p>How do you understand this concept?

The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9732&st=&pgnum=547\">YD 329:3</a>) rules that thick dough kneaded to be boiled (which is what deep frying is) is exempt from Challah. The Shach notes that some opinions don't care what his intentions are when kneading, and if it is a thick bread-like dough it is obligated in Challah from the time of kneading. The Pitchei Teshuva there also notes a possible opinion of Rabbeinu Tam who argues on the Shulchan Aruch. Thus both recommend separating Challah anyway out of doubt, but to refrain from saying the bracha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Take a look at challah 1.4 -1.5. A deep fried dough is not lechem I.e. a bread product. The Torah only obligates bread products in the chiyuv of challah however the chiyuv of challah takes effect at N earlier stage - during the kneading process. So there is a machlokes between rabeinu tam (sefer hayashar and pesachim (38b) )and rash on the type of dough. Rabeinu tam holds that kneading effects effects a chiyuv chalah and as soon as the obligation is effective it cannot be released so in order for such a dough to be exempt it must be a batter( batters are not kneaded) and deep fried thus there was never a point during the baking process that a chiyuv was effective. The rash holds that you can even knead a dough and this will dough will remain exempt providing that when you are kneading this dough you intend to bake into a non challah liable item. The rash holds in hilchos chalah that any time you intend (during the kneading process)to make a dough into a non chalah liable item the chiyuv will not be efective although the dough is kneaded.</p>\n\n\n",

As we are obligated to obey a prophet, it would seem that the fact that the prophecy was conveyed through an angel is not a problem. This would include a temporary command to violate a Biblical commandment (with the exception of idolatry). (<em>Hil.

The Rambam discusses the rules for determining when a person is a full-fledged prophet in <em>Hil.

If the prophecy is not a full-fledged prophecy, then one certainly would not be <em>obligated</em> - in the full sense - to obey, especially if the supposed command was in violation of <em>halacha</em> (in which case one would be forbidden from obeying the command). </p>\n\n<p>Whether such a revelation could be used to help resolve a halachic question, or whether - in the absence of any halachic issues - one would be best advised to follow such instructions, is a far more complex question. In this regard I would recommend reading R' Reuven Margolios' introduction to his edition of שו\"ת מן השמים (printed by Mossad HaRav Kook), where he discusses the various lower forms of <em>ruach hakodesh</em> that have existed in the generation since the end of prophecy, and how much authority they are given in halachic matters.</p>\n\n\n",

In my experience, American Jews do not use and are mostly not familiar with the expression \"I wish you a long life.\"</p>\n\n\n",

The thieves did not keep it in the original casks, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/business/arrests-made-in-maple-syrup-theft-from-quebec-warehouse.html\">transfered it into their own containers</a>. Now the syrup has been recovered, and presumably the owner will transfer it back to the normal storage area (although I don't actually know that).</p>\n\n<p>Is this going to be a kashrus problem? We have no way to know what the thieves did with the product while they had it. And the Canadian cartel keeps the product in storage for several years.</p>\n\n<p>Can you make a product batel if some containers are treif, other are not, but they are not actually mixed together, just stored together?</p>\n\n<p>More than the halachic question, I'm curious if Kashrus agencies are/will check into this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the answer is probably going to depend on the facts. But there's an important point OP and the other responses do not mention, which is that we usually don't assume something is asur just because it was out of sight and \"We have no way to know what the thieves did with the product while they had it. This is the concept of שאחזוקי איסורא לא מחזקינן. See טוש\"ע אורח חיים תסז ג and עבודה זרה יא ב-ויב א for sources and some examples. See also Yore Deah 118 for foods that are an exception to this general rule. So the most important question is whether there are indicia under the circumstances that raise a safek treif was put into the syrup. For example, OP says they found kettles with the stolen syrup. What was in them, are they the kind that would be used for other things, do the thieves have a financial incentive to adulterate the syrup with something nonkosher? All of these are fact questions and questions for a posek whether they make a difference.</p>\n<p>As for the second part of your question, yes, in principle you can have bitul where you have some items that are 100% treif and some are 100% kosher and they get mixed up but not mixed together. For example if someone injected pork into an apple and threw it into a box of apples you apples remain mutar. However there are exceptions to this rule including for things that are \"chashuv,\" like living animals. It's conceivable that a barrel of syrup would be in that category.</p>\n<p>I have no idea what in practice was done with the syrup either from a business perspective or a kashrut perspective.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Shalom u'vracha! It is permitted. The thieves intended to re-sell the maple syrup and likely kept it clean throughout transport and storage. If it was dirtied in any way, or mixed with something else, the original owners would dispose of it and not sell it to the public for fear of local law enforcement requiring notification of ingredients or court cases in the event of sickness or contamination. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding kashrut, there is no problem as long as we don't know of any issur mixed into it and taste only maple syrup. If there was a non-kosher ingredient mixed into it during the care of the thieves, it would be batel b'shishim if the non-kosher ingredients is 1/60th of the orginal maple syrup, in which case it would probably be disposed of.</p>\n\n\n",

I don't recall exactly what my melamed taught, but essentially it's this:</p>\n\n<p>As is known from Tanya, the 4th klippah is Nogah. </p>\n\n<p>Treif meat is forbidden to eat, but the Torah allows us to give them to dogs and goyim and I believe we're allowed to cook it. This would be indicative of the third klippah. </p>\n\n<p>There are actually three discrete prohibitions regarding milk-and-meat combinations: (1) not to cook them together; (2) not to eat such a mixture; (3) not to benefit from such a mixture. However, a Jew can have such in his possession, though this usually happens inadvertently. This would indicative of the second klippah. </p>\n\n<p>But on Pesach, one cannot own, cook, benefit, or eat chametz. This is clearly the first klippah. </p>\n\n<p>However, even this seemingly opaque husk has a degree of permissibility.\nThe Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 442:4) rules: “Regarding a food item which has Chametz mixed into it but is completely inedible for human beings, although it is permissible to retain it in one’s possession, one may not eat it until after Pesach.” The Poskim explain that it is likewise permissible to benefit from this Chametz mixture (Mishnah Berurah 442:22 and Chazon Ish Orach Chaim 116:8). The Rambam (Hilchot Chametz U’Matzah 4:8) and other Rishonim that the Bet Yosef quotes (in the beginning of the aforementioned chapter) rule accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>This is not surprising as the Gemara (Ketubot 110b and elsewhere) teaches “Shinui Veset Techilat Choli,” changing one’s routine triggers illness. The difficulty animals experience when their eating routine is changed in reflected in Rashi to Bereishit 7:24 s.v. Ach No’ach, which describes how the lion on No’ach’s Teivah bit him when the lion’s food was served late. Many animals will regurgitate frequently and suffer considerably when their food regime is altered.</p>\n\n<p>This comes down to Chametz Gamur vs. Ta’arovet Chametz. </p>\n\n<p>A “Chametz mixture” (Ta’arovet Chametz) refers to a food which is not actual Chametz (such as bread) but merely has a Chametz ingredient mixed into it (and this food item does not have the ability to leaven other foods), such as cheese which has some flour mixed into it. Chametz mixtures share the same law as actual Chametz, in that if one retains Chametz mixtures in his possession on Pesach, he has transgressed the prohibition of “Lo Yeira’eh Lecha Chametz”, do not let Chametz be seen or found in your possession.</p>\n\n<p>There is nevertheless a basic underlying distinction between pure Chametz and Chametz mixtures: Whereas actual Chametz may not be retained in one’s possession on Pesach unless it becomes inedible for a dog, a Chametz mixture may be retained in one’s possession as long as a human being would not eat it (even if a dog would).</p>\n\n<p>Chametz food which becomes inedible, such as bread which was burnt to ashes, may be retained in a Jew’s possession and used for benefit on Pesach. However, this only applies to food that even a dog wouldn’t eat (Nifsal Mei’Achilat Kelev; Pesachim 21b and Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 442:2 and 445:2). <em>E.g</em>., tropical fish food, which both Chacham Ben Tzion Abba Sha’ul and Chacham Ovadia Yosef permit to be fed to fish even though it is assur to feed dogs due to its putridity. </p>\n\n<p>Thus we see that there truly is no evil. And anyone who teitsch's klippot these as satanic are sorely mistook. Learn well. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do Jewish people celebrate Christmas?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Do Jewish people celebrate Christmas like Christians?</p>\n\n<p>What do they do on Christmas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>First, it should be noted that you are asking a very broad question, as, unfortunately, there certainly are many Jews who celebrate it as a secular, cultural holiday, and many Christians who classify themselves as Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Mainstream Judaism, however, rejects Jesus.  Adamantly, decisively, and without qualification.  We do not believe he was a prophet, a leader, or any sort of deity.  In fact, <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesusnarr.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the things that we do believe about him range</a> from some rejecting the idea that he even existed (at least in the sense that Christians believe - one person with one message), to the idea that he was a bastard (in the biblical sense, a son of an illicit relationship), to his being a rabble-rouser (in a negative sense), to his being a false prophet,  all the way to his being a practitioner of dark magic and a purely evil person.</p>\n\n<p>So, depending how extreme you want to get, no, Jews do not celebrate Christmas for any or all of the reasons above.</p>\n\n<p>Some things we do on Christmas (this list ranges from the serious to the silly, so forgive me):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Abstain from studying Torah the night of December 24th, because Torah study strengthens spiritual forces in the world, even evil forces, and the evil forces are at their strongest on that night (this is over-simplified for the sake of this answer - more <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/4878/3\">here</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Work extra hours to take advantage of a quiet office, and/or to swap a holiday with a non-Jewish colleague so as to have time off for a Jewish holiday.</p></li>\n<li><p>Participate in organized community mitzvah projects (like <a href=\"http://thejewishchronicle.net/view/full_story/21191735/article-Jewish-Federation-Mitzvah-Day-2012-to-Engage-650--?instance=secondary_stories_left_column\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Go to the movies.</p></li>\n<li><p>Eat Chinese food.</p></li>\n<li><p>Watch <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/97189077\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Christmas time for the Jews\"</a> over and over again because it's pretty darn funny.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>No we do not. We do not consider him a deity and therefore we have nothing to celebrate on that day. Some [mainly Chassidim] have the custom to abstain from learning the Torah on that day so as not to give strength to the Evil forces that are around on that day. <a href=\"http://hirhurim.blogspot.co.il/2007/12/nittel-nacht-christmas-eve.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Read more here.</a></p>\n\n\n",

If so, how can you say he was always free of sin?</p>\n\n<p>Rather, Avraham did Teshuva out of love. The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=86&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 86A</a>) says that when one does Teshuva out of love, his sins are uprooted, and considered as if they never happened. So Avraham was able to be considered as if he had never sinned because he did Teshuva out of Love.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, explains the Maskil LeDavid, once Rashi (Bereshit 25:9) explains that Yishmael did Teshuva, there is no need for him to explain what the repetition of Shana indicates by Yishmael. We understand that all of Yishmael's years were retroactively considered free of sin, since he did Teshuva.</p>\n\n<p>So Rashi implicitly makes the same limud by Yishmael as he explicitly makes by Avraham. </p>\n\n\n",

It was originally published in the periodical <em>Baderech</em>. The author uses the pseudonym מחר הלוי.</p>\n\n<p>The following is the version of the story printed there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על הגר\"א מוולנא יסופר, כי הוא פנה פעם למוכיח-בשער ידוע בימיו: הטף לי דברי מוסר! המוכיח הזדעזע: האם הטף אטיף דברי תוכחה להגאון מוולנא?! אני גוזר עליך שתעשה את זה - צוה הגר\"א. ופתח המוכיח ואמר דברים אלה: הוי, אליהו, אליהו, עובד אתה את בורא-העולם בהיקף מוגבל, בסתר חדרך הצר ובד' אמות שלך, - צא נא לאויר העולם, לשוק החיים והמעשה, ועמוד שם בנסיונות יום יום, ועבוד שם את האלקים מתוך כשלונות היצר הרע ומלכודותיו על כל צעד ושעל...  התחיל הגר\"א בוכה ואומר: להיות עושה נפלאות ומהלך על חבל נטוי על פני ים זועף - אני ירא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Informal translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is told of the Vilna Gaon (Rabbi Elijah of Vilna), that he once turned to a <em>mochiach</em> (literally, \"admonisher\", referring to a rabbi who would give public speeches admonishing the people) who was well-known in his day and said, \"Tell me some words of <em>mussar</em> (moral admonishment)!\" The <em>mochiach</em> was shocked, \"Shall I give <em>mussar</em> to the Gaon of Vilna?!\" \"I decree upon you that you do this!\", commanded the Vilna Gaon. The <em>mochiach</em> began and spoke these words, \"Woe, Elijah, Elijah! You serve the Creator in a very limited manner, hidden in your room and within your own four cubits. Go out into the world, into the public arena of life and action, and withstand the challenges of daily life, and there serve God amidst the setbacks and traps of the evil inclination at every step... The Vilna Gaon began to cry and said, \"To do wonders and walk on a rope stretched out over an angry sea - I am afraid!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, while not exactly the same in every detail (esp. in the fact that the <em>baal mussar</em> is not identified), this is clearly the same basic story. Personally, I suspect the story is either entirely fictional, or has changed substantially from its original form.</p>\n\n\n",

We learn and study and follow God's commands and pray, but how do we know God (as opposed to what God wants)?</p>\n\n<p>What is a true way to know GOD better?  Which commands in Torah are related to my question?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Like anything in a relationship, it can only be partially captured or described in words. We still learn a lot from others before and around us in the way that they've known Him, so here are some thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>The essence of your question seems to come from the fact that God is not part of creation, nor truly comparable to anything else in our experience of nature. We can't define His essence and we can't perceive with our minds or our senses the fulness of who He is. We know how to have a relationship with other humans, but how can we truly know someone who is not at all human; not even a part of the world around us, but in fact its Creator? He is not abstract or vague or senseless in who He actually is, but in our eyes He is beyond all our categories and imagination.</p>\n\n<p>In the book <em><a href=\"http://bilvavi.net/content/category/8/49/57/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Building a Sanctuary in the Heart</a></em> (available online at <a href=\"http://bilvavi.net/content/view/12/57/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bilvavi.net</a>), there's a quote that struck me when I read it: \"He is hidden from their intellects, yet revealed in their hearts.\" I asked a rabbi about this and he replied that even though our minds and senses can't perceive God's 'essence', we perceive His actions and can grow to understand them. And as the rabbi understood it, when we think about His actions our hearts get to know Him. A lot of the strongest, most tangible metaphors of God's actions in Judaism and in our everyday lives stand to this effect. Not in the sense of defining Him, but in the sense of His love for us. When people study His Torah, and step out into living it in real life, their hearts get to feel His holiness. When you accept His blessings in creation, from each breath, to everything you eat and drink, to the ability to trust and thank Him for His wisdom in every part of life (as in Psalm 139), you strengthen your knowledge of who you are as a creation and of who He is as Creator and giver.</p>\n\n<p>Even though we can't understand the process of creation in general, we can see that it exists. In the same way, we can't understand how humans could have a relationship with God, but Tanach and the Jewish testimony about God narrate the creation of such a relationship in the world. If you can accept this testimony, you find that obedience to God is another way of knowing Him: using our ability to choose His ways allows us to draw closer to Him in both love and experience. The cause and effect of such a thing is beyond our speculation, but the reality is something we experience. Righteousness, justice, purity, kindness, and obedience that is either natural or costly to us; every connection with these things is an immediate connection with God.</p>\n\n<p>So in both thankfulness for His actions and obedience to His ways in wisdom, Judaism spends a lot of energy and focus on the belief that God has made ways for humanity to know Him. He is hidden to our minds, but His actions aren't, and He is known by heart. Knowledge itself is a wide and varied thing: you can have intellectual knowledge, but also relational knowledge; you can know something distantly as a fact, or you can be deeply aware of it often. These kinds of knowing are connected in our experience. And kind of like in a human relationship, where we know some things about the other and there's a lot left to learn about them, we can still say it is them that we love and connect with. From God, this is a gift.</p>\n\n<p>I'll note that I'm not Jewish and don't know a lot about Judaism, so I never post comments on this site... but these are some things that relate closely to the question and that I think are valuable.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I heard a six year old Jewish boy recently tell me that your neshama can see God.

In the following year Yosef acquired ownership of all the land in Egypt (except the priests') for Paro, but it says nothing about land beyond Egypt.  If those in Canaan had already spent all their money and the famine continued for several more years, what did they do?  Did they all leave (or die)?  Did they find some other way to eat and, if so, what was it?</p>\n\n<p>Rashi on v19 <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/showrashi/true/aid/8242/jewish/Chapter-47.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">says</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>and give [us] seed-: [with which] to sow the soil.

Here's a summary:</p>\n<p>The Netziv's answer is difficult because the Torah literally <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.43.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>: \"But the famine in the land was <strong>severe</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>Instead he suggests that an answer may be found in the differences of climate between the two countries:</p>\n<p>Rain comes to Canaan (what is now Israel) mostly from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Low\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Icelandic Low</a>. The winds carry the cold air and reach this area around wintertime, which is why it rains here in the winter. Egypt, on the other hand, barely gets any rain year-round. The primary water source in Egypt, to this day, is the Nile. Egyptian farming is based on canals that are ready to lead water during the rise of water levels from the Nile to the fields. It was only when the fields were soaked in water that the Egyptians sowed their seeds.</p>\n<p>Summer monsoon rains in Ethiopia are what cause the Nile to overflow and water the fields. The rise in water levels typically happens around fall, circa Elul-time. During Tishrei and Cheshvan the water flows to the fields and soaks them, and only then are the locals able to sow their fields.</p>\n<p>Having explained this, we can now understand what happened during the famine:</p>\n<p>The famine started in Canaan because rain didn't fall in the winter. Meanwhile, in Egypt there was still produce because Egyptian farming was based on rain from the previous summer. It was only when the next summer's monsoons didn't come and the Nile didn't overflow during the fall and early winter of the next year that the famine came to Egypt as well. This can be seen in the verses as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And the seven years of famine set in, just as Joseph had foretold. There was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was bread.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.41.54?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet 41:54</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And only after does it say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And when all the land of Egypt felt the hunger, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; whatever he tells you, you shall do.”\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.41.55?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 55</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the famine first began in the lands around Egypt, and only a later did it arrive in Egypt as well. That means that the famine <em>ended</em> in the same order, too:</p>\n<p>During the winter, rains began falling in Canaan, while in Egypt the monsoons would only come the following summer. So only a year after Canaan once again had crops could the Egyptians eat their own crops. In the time between the end of the Canaanite famine and the end of the Egyptian famine, the Egyptians were forced to sell their land.</p>\n<p>This explanation helps in understanding the following verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Let us not perish before your eyes, both we and our land. Take us and our land in exchange for bread, and we with our land will be serfs to Pharaoh; provide the seed, that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become a waste.”\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.47.19?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 47:19</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What good would sowing seeds be if there was no water? Rather, we may say that at this point the Egyptians heard that the rain had returned to Canaan and they knew that in year's time they'd also get monsoon water from the Nile and wished to ready the land.</p>\n\n\n",

Archeology?</p>\n<p>Moreover, how do they know that the graves are Jewish?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I've been studying archeology for over three years now and I'm familiar with some of the workings between the Ultra-Orthodox organization in charge of protecting Jewish cemeteries known as Atra Kadisha (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asra_Kadisha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אתרא קדישא</a>), and the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).</p>\n<p>Israeli law requires every construction company about to break ground to do so under the supervision of an IAA field supervisor. Often, this leads to finding archeological artifacts, or even entire archeological sites. The supervisor's job is to halt the work to minimize the damage to the artifacts or sites. The supervisor, or sometimes a more experienced archeologist, examines the findings and decides how to proceed. If an entire site has been discovered, or many artifacts, the construction work may be halted for days, weeks, months or even years (the latter was fairly recently the case at Tel Beit Shemesh when an unknown second half of the tel was found, halting work on a new road).</p>\n<p>Sometimes a grave, or several graves may be found. In this case Atra Kadisha is alerted. Official policy is that any time a grave is found during archeological work, Atra Kadisha is summoned to the field. Atra Kadisha works under the assumption that any grave found in Eretz Yisrael may potentially be a Jewish tomb (unless there are clear signs marking it as a non-Jewish grave, e.g., a cross), and so every grave found must be dealt with under that assumption.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>The actual manner in which the grave is dealt with differs depending on what exactly the construction project is supposed to be. For example, if the project was supposed to be building a new neighborhood and a whole cemetery has been found, the cemetery would probably be excavated and then covered with concrete. But if it's a minor project, such as setting new electricity cables in the ground, the grave(s) might be left as-is, while the route of the cables will be altered slightly to avoid desecrating the grave(s). In other cases, the body might be removed from the grave and buried elsewhere (a famous <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/newspapers/ahr/1969/07/08/01/article/45\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">case</a> was that of the bodies found in Masada in the 60s, assumed to have been those of Jewish rebels, and were reburied in a grand military funeral elsewhere).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> This is a point of contention between the IAA and Atra Kadisha, as Atra Kadisha have the ability to cordon off parts of and even shut down entire excavation projects even if the chances of the graves being Jewish are very low to impossible (e.g., a tomb found at a clearly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chalcolithic</a> site) (and in fact, do exercise their power in some such cases). On the other side of the aisle, some may argue that the IAA, because advancing research is one of their main goals and are a secular governmental organization, don't handle bodies and/or graves in a halachically befitting manner. To sum up, there are politics involved.</p>\n\n\n",

Let's say it's a fish bone that is stuck in the person's throat. May they take a fish bone (either from a plate or from the trash) and use it for the segulah? Seemingly the fish bone is muktzeh (not like bones from meat or chicken that may be given to the dogs so are not muktzeh — see OC Siman 308 Sif 27). However, perhaps one could find a <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/585\">heter</a> to pick up and move the fish bone for this purpose?

My Rav, Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer, zt\"l, said it was forbidden to enter the sanctuary of a church.  Rabbi Maurice Lamm, in his book Becoming A Jew, also does not allow any leniency.  </p>\n\n<p>When my father died, I brought up the issue because I was asked to speak at the memorial service.  Another Orthodox rabbi, Rabbi Bertram Leff, shlita, suggested that I do it like a kohen in a different room other than the sanctuary; I rejected that because it would be unexplainable to the non-Jews, and my mother would have been embarrassed.  Holding firm to my position, my mother agreed to hold the service in the non-denominational chapel at the funeral home, which just happened to be next door to my parents' church, and I agreed to go to the reception afterwards in the church's social hall because it was in a separate building than the sanctuary. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But I have seen examples of Orthodox rabbis who did go to churches.  The Chief Rabbi of England attended the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana in Westminster Abbey, but that was permitted on the basis of kavod hamelek (honor to the king).  A more troubling issue has been the case of Orthodox Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, founder and president of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.  Rabbi Eckstein's visits to churches has raised millions of dollars for Jewish social services in Israel.  But I feared that if my mother knew of him, she would want to know why I couldn't have her funeral in her church.  </p>\n\n<p>I wrote to Rabbi Eckstein by e-mail, told him of my dilemma, and asked on whose heter did he rely upon to go into churches.  Thinking I was asking him for permission, he first said, \"I don't poskin shailos\" (i.e. he doesn't decide legal issues).  But pushed to answer my question, he admitted that he was relying on his own, unprecedented, legal opinion because what he is doing is good for Israel.

There would be very little issue, as far as I know, of attending a friend's Muslim or Bahai wedding, for instance. Rabbi Yehuda Herzl Henkin allows one to enter a Unitarian church, though I doubt attending a worship service there is a good idea. (I don't know how much of a \"worship service\" the wedding entails.) Moving along the spectrum of Christian denominations towards Catholicism and then Eastern Orthodox, where there are more and more \"physical symbols\", the issue becomes increasingly thorny. </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that rabbis assume Hinduism is given the same treatment that Greek paganism was in the Talmud; it's debatable whether Buddhism is viewed by Judaism as \"paganism\" or \"atheism.\" </p>\n\n\n",

Would indirect attainment of such food b'dieved (receiving a scoop as a gift) be forbidden?</p>\n\n<p>Sources would be gleefully appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is forbidden to eat food that was produced by non-Jews or non-observant Jews (i.e. a Jew who is not fully observant of the laws of Shabbos) because it cannot be assumed to have been produced in accordance with the laws of kashrus. (This is true regardless of the producers assertions to the contrary. We cannot rely on the testimony of a non-Jew or non-observant Jew that the food is actually kosher.)</p>\n\n<p>In such a case, the absence of a <em>hechsher</em> means that the food must be assumed to be non-kosher, even if \"all the ingredients\" are (supposedly) kosher. </p>\n\n<p>This has nothing to do with <em>ma'aris ayin</em> (which only comes into affect when there is not actual halachic problem) or \"boycotting non-religious establishments\" (which I have never even heard of).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, nowadays we effectively require a <em>hechsher</em> even if the restaraunt is owned and run by a fully observant Jew. Even though, strictly speaking, in such a case supervision may not be required, in practical terms it is often necessary for several reasons. One reason is that, unless we know the owner ourselves (or live in their community), we have no way of knowing whether they are religious (or even Jewish), thus we would not be able to use their products. The hechsher, which is provided by a recognized entity in the Jewish world, solves this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the modern food industry is extraordinarily complex and any food production establishment that operates on a larger scale than a home kitchen requires knowledgeable supervision to ensure that no mistakes are made.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, under normal circumstances, if a restaurant does not have a hechsher, the food must be assumed to be non-kosher, especially if the owners are not Shabbos observant Jews.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If the restaurant is open on Shabbos, is the Shabbos being publicly and knowingly violated there? </p>\n\n<p>If it is, then the transgressors have the law of non-Jews.

    "content": "# A woman with dreadlocks going to the mikveh\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In regards to the dinim of chatzitza by the tevillah of a Niddah the SA (Rema) in YD Siman 198 Sif 6 speaks about an interesting situation where a woman's hair was tied together by a Shin-Daled (\"Demon\") and that it's a danger for her to remove this and therefore can be toveled  as it is and is not considered a chatzitzah.</p>\n\n<p>A woman who has dreadlocks in her hair and doesn't want to remove them, may she go to the mikveh like this? Although the reason why the case of the Rema is not a problem is because it's a danger to remove the dreadlocks the makor for this din is in the Mordechai who gives other reasons as well which may be applicable in our case. One reason is that since the hair is stuck together so much it comes like \"chaticha achas\" (one thing) that the hair on the inside is considered to be \"baluah\" (swallowed) and doesn't need that the water of the mikveh should get to it at the time of the tevillah. Perhaps this could be a heter for the woman to be tovelled without removing the dreadlocks. </p>\n\n<p>What other reasons or heterim (if any) could there be? Or perhaps she simply must remove the dreadlocks. Do the later poskim discuss this issue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Tevilah with dreadlocks is acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>The Rema cited by @Yehoshua is coming from the Beis Yosef ad loc., who is quoting the Mordechai in Shavuos §751, who is quoting a Ra’avyah in Teshuva 991. The Ra’avyah gives three reasons why these plaits (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_plait\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for background) are not a problem of chatzitza:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The halacha (see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=37&daf=67&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Niddah 67a</a>, Shulchan Aruch YD 198:5) is that one hair tied in a knot is tight enough to be considered a chatzitza. More than one hair is not. This is more than one hair.</li>\n<li>Even if it is tight; since whatever it naturally covers is\nconsidered “swallowed up” regarding technical laws of tum’ah, one\ncould posit that this also has bearing on the laws of tevilah in\nthat it is not necessary for that area to undergo tevilah.</li>\n<li>Since the assumed danger involved in the removal of these locks will\ncause this woman to want them to remain there, we say “that is the\nway it grows”; a line of reasoning which says that anything which is\nintended to be there (not just that one doesn’t mind it’s presence)\nis considered part of the body itself regarding tevilah.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is a fourth reason which is really much more basic: Anything which a person does not intend to remove is not a chatzitza unless it covers most of the body, and even then it is only a chatzitza mid’rabannan (see Niddah ibid.). One who examines the words of the Ra’avyah inside will notice that this is a sufficient reason which he only ignored because of the opinion that most of the head is just as bad as most of the body, rendering this point moot.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, we have at least three reasons why the braids are not a chatzitza, and all of them apply to dreadlocks. Even though the third reason – that “that’s the way it grows” – was clearly said because of the assumed danger in removing it, we find the exact concept applied when something is done for beauty; namely further on in the Shulchan Aruch (s’if 17) where hair dye is not considered a chatzitza for this very reason.</p>\n\n<p>There is a Rema in the first se'if which says that the custom is to remove all interfering items; even ones which would not be considered chatzitzos. However, see the Sidrei Tahara there who writes that this is only an extra stringency, and the Aruch Hashulchan similarly writes that if there is any need whatsoever one should not be stringent about this. So although it is a laudable custom, one should certainly be aware of the letter-of-the-law.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm not familiar with any poskim discussing this issue. There are, however, contemporary teshuvot that allow women to go to the mikveh with dreadlocks. For example, <a href=\"http://www.kipa.co.il/ask/show.asp?id=90947\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Benayahu Broner answered such a dreadlock question</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>את יכולה לטבול עם הראסטות, עליך לנקות את השיער במידת האפשר, ובנוסף רצוי לגזור את השערות הבולטות. בצורה שבה את היום מטפלת בשערות כך את יכולה לטבול.</p>\n  \n  <p>You can immerse with dreadlocks; you must clean your hair as much as possible, and should additionally cut any protruding hairs. In the way you care for your hair these days, so can you immerse. (My translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second sentence is strange Hebrew, which makes the English sound stranger. But the idea seems to offer another idea for going to the mikveh with dreadlocks: This is the fixed state of your hair, so it is considered permanently attached to your body. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this is a kula not every contemporary rabbi follows, as can be seen in this <a href=\"http://www.moreshet.co.il/web/shut/shut2.asp?id=93656\" rel=\"nofollow\">psak</a>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>First of all, thank you for an interesting question.</p>\n<p>According to the answer:</p>\n<p>Usually, in chatsitsot we look if most women do pay attention at them (מקפידות) or not. See Ch.O. Yore Dea, 198:1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפילו אינה מקפדת עליו לעולם כיון שדרך בני אדם להקפיד עליו חוצץ</p>\n<p>Even if it is never matters for her if to leave or remove the chatsitsa, because for most of women it does matters - it is chotsets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In case of Ramo, that you cited, most of women would leave the hair stucked because of danger, but in case of dreadlocks I think most women do not leave them at hairs.</p>\n<p>In addition, if most of the <em>body</em> is covered with chatsitsa we have a problem from the torah (חציצה דאוריתא) and <em>hair</em> is taught as a different body for that matter (like we see from Gemora Nida 67:1-2), so that most hair must always remain revealed during the tvila. From this I conclude that it is much more difficult to find heter is this case, since this is דאוריתא.</p>\n\n\n",

(There are many more.)  It therefore seems more logical that the <em>g'mara</em> is talking about Jewish kings, not kings from the other nations whose practices we are generally told to avoid.  Why, as you ask in the question, should we learn <em>halacha</em> from gentile kings?</p>\n\n<p>If you will say that the oral torah, being from Sinai, couldn't be referring to kings we had not yet had, then consider that the written torah itself tells us that we will have kings (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0517.htm#15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 17:15</a>).  It is reasonable to conclude that the Author who tells us in advance about having kings can give us laws tied to their conventions about arising in the morning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Monica's answer is one I would endorse, and this is along the lines of the position of the Chazon Ish and something I heard in Rav Schachter's shiur, that it is based on reality at the time of the Mishnah.</p>\n<p>To quote <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2012/08/berachot-10-college-students-and-sof.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">myself</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The position of the Chazon Ish is that reality at the time of the Talmud defines halachic practice. Thus [<a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/science.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quoting</a> Rabbi Gil Student]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Should the halachot of treifot then change to fit the current reality? The Chazon Ish explains, based on the Gemara in Avodah Zarah 9a, that the world was divided into three periods - two thousand years of tohu, two thousand years of Torah, and two thousand years of Mashiach. The full explanation of this passage is fascinating but will take us well off topic. However, the Chazon Ish explained that the halachot of treifot were based on nature as it was during the time of Torah, the two thousand years between Avraham and approximately the close of the Mishna. Since at that time the treifot as described in the Talmud caused an animal to die within a year, we are still forbidden to eat such animals even if they can now survive for over a year. [end quote]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So too (Rav Schachter mentioned in shiur), it might be that we must be koveah the sof zman krias Shema based on when people rose at the time of the gemara.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To explain this idea further, it is not that the Torah wanted to say 6:30 AM or some other specific time celestial time, and used <em>uvkumecha</em> as a convenient way of designating that. Rather, it is fluid, such that any time people are getting up is considered <em>uvkumecha</em>. And, since at the time of the Mishna or Gemara, kings were getting up at that point, that was a fulfillment of the Biblical time. Had there been college students in those days, even until noon would be <em>uvkumecha</em>. But we can add to that the theory that <em>halacha</em> was still fixed at the time defined by the gemara (rather than reevaluating for our days) based on this idea of the Chazon Ish.</p>\n\n\n",

Here's the summary.</p>\n<p>Rashi uses the following rules in the Tanakh syntax:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the narrative tells us of the transpiration of events in chronological order, it takes verbs  in the form of the future tense, such as יֵדע, and has them denote actions in the past by adding the conversive <em>vav</em> prefix to the verb and placing the verb ahead of the subject, such as ויֵדֵע אָדָם וגו.</li>\n<li>When the subject appears first and is followed by a verb in the past or present tense,  such as in Bereshis 4:1: וְהָאָדָם יָדַע וגו, it indicatse that the narrative goes back in time to refer to an event which took place before those that had been earlier discussed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rule is applied to the case of verses <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.12?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 47:12-13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְכַלְכֵּ֤ל יוֹסֵף֙ אֶת־אָבִ֣יו וְאֶת־אֶחָ֔יו וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑יו לֶ֖חֶם לְפִ֥י הַטָּֽף׃ וְלֶ֤חֶם אֵין֙ בְּכׇל־הָאָ֔רֶץ כִּֽי־כָבֵ֥ד הָרָעָ֖ב מְאֹ֑ד וַתֵּ֜לַהּ אֶ֤רֶץ מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ וְאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן מִפְּנֵ֖י הָרָעָֽב׃</p>\n<p>Joseph sustained his father, and his brothers, and all his father’s household with bread, down to the little ones. Now there was no bread in all the world, for the famine was very severe; both the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.13?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 47:13</a>, Rashi says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scripture reverts now to the original subject, viz, to the account of the beginning of the years of famine (i.e. prior to arrival of Yaakov).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How does Rashi know about this? Based on the above rule, if the events were sequential, the verse would have to say ולא היה לחם בכל הארץ with the verb in the past tense preceeding the subject. But the verse says that the subject לחם is ahead of the verb, thus the Torah indicates that the whole section is dealing with the earlier event.</p>\n<p>Because of this nuance in grammar, Rashi makes first an indication that famine ended with the arrival of Yaakov in the comment to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.10?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 47:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And from the time when Jacob blessed him and henceforth, whenever Pharaoh came to the Nile it rose at his coming, overflowed its banks and watered the land.

They wept for him during so long a period because a blessing had come to them on his arrival in Egypt for the famine then ceased and the waters of the Nile again increased (Midrash Tanchuma, Nasso 26).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, Rashi says so in the comment to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.29.11?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 29:11</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Neither shall it be inhabited for forty years.</strong> Forty-two years of famine were decreed in Pharaoh’s dream, corresponding to the three times the dream is written. He saw seven bad cows and seven bad ears of grain (Gen. 41) and he told it to Joseph; hence we have [it mentioned] twice, and Joseph said to him, “The seven thin and bad cows and the seven empty ears,” totaling forty-two for the famine. But they had only two, as it is stated (ibid. 45:6): “For it is two years now that the famine has been on earth,” and when Jacob came down to Egypt, the famine ceased, for behold in the third year they sowed, as it is stated (ibid. 47:19): “and then you give us seed that we may live etc.,” and the forty years were paid to them now: “neither shall it be inhabited for forty years.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the next sequential verse to Bereshis 47:12 is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.19?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 47:19</a>, where Rashi says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GIVE US SEED — to sow in the ground. Although Joseph had said (Genesis 45:6) “And there are yet five years when there will be no plowing and sowing”, as soon as Jacob came to Egypt a blessing came with his arrival: they began to sow and the famine came to an end. Thus do we read in the Tosefta of Sotah (Tosefta Sotah 10:3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of these comments, as pointed in the essay by R' Herczeg, Rashi made based on applying the above syntax rule.</p>\n\n\n",

I think there is definitely a midrashic connection (whereas an etymological connection would exist not for Ye'or-or, but probably for nahar-nahara).</p>\n\n<p>Melila Hellner-Eshed's phenomenal book \"<a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=EYqu1TCqfyAC&pg=PA237\" rel=\"nofollow\">A River Flows from Eden</a>\" explores the significance of that verse (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0102.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 2:10</a>) in Qabbalistic thought, and discusses throughout her book the thematic connection between rivers and light — an especially prominent concern in the Zohar, whose very name means 'light'. She argues that the \"river\" that flows from \"Eden\" to \"the garden\", for the Qabbalists, was the flow of divine blessing from the divine reality into our world. She cites on pp. 237-238 a section of Zohar linking Genesis 2:10 to <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3412.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daniel 12:3</a>, \"the wise will shine as the brightness [<em>zohar</em>] of the firmament\". The radiance, the Zohar says, is \"the shining [nehiru] and sparkling of the river [nahara]\". Hellner-Eshed explains that \"'the radiance of the sky' is in fact the river that flows from Eden, sparkling as a stream of light. This streaming light is that which radiates from the kabbalists... The radiance, so important to the work that bears this name, is in fact the streaming of the river... They view the entire sky as a kind of river (perhaps because of the ever-changing position of the stars) and within this sky they identify a river of light [nahar dinur], the Milky Way, a river that flows from the depths of the sky and pours fourth its plenty on the world.

(ושלשת ימים האחרונים הם התפתחות אור הגשמי והבעלי חיים שיש להם דעת של עצמם השייכים לזה.) אבל להבין את זה צריך מתחלה להבין למה הגשמים ושאר מימות נקראים בלשון אורה, ואיך זה קשור למהות האור ותיקון המים שבשלשת הימים.\nראה ברמב\"ן ראש פרשת מקץ שנתקשה למה המטר נקרא אור, והאב\"ע על הפסוק באיוב לו ל הן פרש עליו אורו ושרשי הים כסה הביא הפירוש שזה חוזר על הגשמים (וכדברי רבי יוחנן, וכן פירש רש\"י שם), והוא חולק על פירוש זה משום שאינו מסכים אל הקשר הזה בין המטר לאור ע\"ש. אבל מ\"מ גם האב\"ע יודה שנהר ויאר שייכים לאורה.\nהבה נבין הקשר בין מטר לאור- בדרך אפשר.\nוחשך על פני תהום. אפשר להבין את זה כמהות המים בעצם. דהיינו שהמים, הבלתי מתוקנים, הנקוים ביחד במקום אחד, עושים תהום עם חשכת התהום. כן הבינו בשמות רבה פט\"ו כ\"ב המים קדמה לעולם וכו' המים הרו וילדו אפלה- דהיינו שתולדות המים, בלי תיקון, היא אפלה. במציאות הדברים הפירוש הוא שריבוי מים עושים תהום, הכרוך עם אפלה. עומק משמעות הדבר עוד יבואר.\nאפשר להבין גם שהמים הם יסוד של כל המציאות והחיים. כתוב (ירמיה ב יג) כי אתי עזבו מקור מים חיים וגו'. המים הם אלו שעושים אפשרות של חיים. אם כן פסוק ב' של פרשת בראשית פירושו כך- הארץ היתה תהו ובהו- בלי צורה, כי המים לא נתקנו להביא חיים אל העולם, כי השמים (מקום המים) היו חלוקים, חלק התחתון היה תהום וחשכו, וחלק העליון האלקי לא נתקנה עדיין, כי רוח אלקים מרחפת על פני המים (וכמש\"ב). המים הבלתי מתוקנים הביאו את חשכת התהום, ולכן הארץ נשאר תהו ובהו.\nאם כנים הדברים, המים הבלתי מתוקנים מביאים את החשך, דהיינו שהשפעת המציאות בלי תיקון מביאה את החשך, דהיינו ביטול ההשגה. לכן תיקונו של המציאות, דהיינו המים, הוא עשיית אפשרות שיהיה אור ביחד עם המציאות. המציאות הבלתי מתוקנת ומוגבלת היא חשך, ולכן תיקונו נקרא בלשון אור.\nראה זכריה יד ז והיה לעת ערב יהיה אור והיה ביום ההוא יצאו מים חיים מירושלים וגו', תהלים לו ט מנחל עדניך תשקם כי עמך מקור חיים באורך נראה אור, יחזקאל מג ב כבוד אלקי ישראל בא מדרך הקדים וקולו כקול מים רבים והארץ האירה מכבודו. בשלשת מקומות אלו מוזכר אור ה' עם מי ה'.\nעל הלויתין כתוב (איוב מא כד) אחריו יאיר נתיב יחשב תהום לשיבה, דהיינו שהלויתן עושה את התהום לבן כאיש זקן. התהום חשך, דהיינו המציאות הבלתי מוגבלת מביא לידי הפסק השגת האמת. לויתן הוא תיקונו של כל המציאות בכללו, דהיינו שריבוי שפע המציאות לא יסתיר את האמת וההשגה. התהום שהוא חשך בראשיתו, לבסוף יאיר.\nוהענין שאם יש ריבוי השפעה בלי מיעוט, נשכח ה' המשפיע. רק על ידי מיעוט ההשפעה והכרת חסרון ההשפעה יבינו האנשים שכל ההשפעה אינה אלא רצון ה'.\nככל היסוד הזה נמצא בספר אוצרות רמח\"ל. ז\"ל על הפסוק יקוו המים וגו'\nבתחלה היו המים שטוחים על הארץ כולה ולבסוף נקוו אל מקום אחד. סוד הענין, הארץ היא סוד מלכות (דהיינו האפשרות לקבלת השפעה), ובתחלה היו המים על כולה, וזה היה רומז שכל חלקי המלכות היו מלאים שפע להביא לעולם, ובזה לא היו הנבראים יכולים לעמוד, שכשם שאי אפשר לעולם לעמוד על הרע כך אי אפשר לקיים על רוב הטובה, ולכך חלק אחד של המלכות נמלא ממים דהיינו סוד ההשפעה, שלא תהיה חסרה לעולם, וחלק אחד של המלכות תהיה יבשה דהיינו שאורותיה יהיו סתומים, כדי שהעולם יתקיים. אבל עכ\"פ גם זה היובש, אם היה לעולם, לא היה אפשר להתקיים, ולכך צריך שגם זה החלק יבוא בו לפעמים השפע, וזה סוד הגשמים הבאים בארץ. ועכ\"פ גשמים הרבה למלאות כל העולם זה אינו טוב, שהעולם לא היה יכול לעמוד בו, וזה סוד המבול, שמרוב השפע נולד חרבן. עכ\"ל\nזכינו להבין שהמים איננו אלא יסוד של כל המציאות וההשפעה של חיים. התהום הוא מקום המים המרובים הבלתי מתוקנים, מה שמביא לידי חשך. ריבוי השפעה ומציאות מחשיך את ידיעת סבת המציאות. תיקונו של המים איננו אלא עשיית המציאות הבלתי מתוקנת, החשוך, למציאות מאירה. לכן המים המתוקנים נקראים אור. שלשת הימים הראשונים הם תיקון האור במציאות, ותיקון מה שנאמר וחשך על פני תהום.\nפסוק ו\nיהי רקיע וגו'\nביארנו כי ויקרא אלקים לאור יום וגו' הוא האופן איך הבדיל אלקים בין אור לחשך. על ידי קביעת התחומים האלו הוא הבדיל ביניהם. גם קריאת השמות ביום השלישי היא הבדלה בין הים ליבשה (פסחים קד.). ביום שני אין אלקים קורא שמות מיוחדים למים העליונים ולמים התחתונים. הטעם לזה פשוט משום שהרקיע הוא המבדיל ביניהם. גם ההבדל איננו אלא זה שיש מים מתחת לרקיע ויש מים מעל לרקיע. היינו כל ההבדל הוא בגדר יחס המים אל הרקיע.\nמהו מים ממעל לרקיע. ראה תהלים קד עטה אור כשלמה נטה שמים כיריעה המקרה במים עליותיו השם עבים רכובו המהלך על כנפי רוח עשה מלאכיו רוחות משרתיו אש להט. מים, עבים, רוחות, ואש להט (ברק). אלו הם תיאור הגשמים ומה שמתלוה אליהם. המים אשר מעל לרקיע איננו אלא המטר. ולמטה מן הרקיע ישנו שאר המים, דהיינו נהר יאר ותהום הים.\nנראה איך ראיית יחזקאל בפרק א היא ראיית רקיע זה. לשון רקיע אינו מצוי בתנ\"ך, אלא לשון שמים. אבל ביחזקאל א, כאשר נפתחו השמים וראה יחזקאל מראות אלקים, מוזכר לשון רקיע תמיד. </p>\n\n<p>כב ודמות על-ראשי החיה, רקיע, כעין, הקרח הנורא--נטוי על-ראשיהם, מלמעלה.  כג ותחת, הרקיע, כנפיהם ישרות, אשה אל-אחותה:  לאיש, שתים מכסות להנה, ולאיש שתים מכסות להנה, את גויתיהם.  כד ואשמע את-קול כנפיהם כקול מים רבים כקול-שדי, בלכתם--קול המלה, כקול מחנה;

It's connected to the words in Deuteronomy to remember the commandments when you're lying down and getting up. I can see the connection. I can also see how this helps both individuals and the community to remember and fulfil the commandment. I also understand why it's good to follow the community in such matters.</p>\n<p>What I don't get is the stretch from simply saying it whenever you go to bed, to this whole concern of deciding what time is appropriate to do so every day. The Gemara asks why the question 'from what time' was brought, but the answer isn't given on the level that I'm wondering about.</p>\n<p>Is this interest in times a 'fence' measure, to make sure an original (oral) Torah law to say Shema is kept? (Similarly to the statement in the mishnah about why the sages said 'until midnight'.) Or perhaps the practice of saying Shema itself emerged not from a Torah law per se. Perhaps the Sages wanted to create a tradition that would help us remember the things Deuteronomy discusses; and then times were also given. Or do you think that Shema was said at particular times from the days of Moses, and that the Mishnah here was recording something original to the oral Torah?</p>\n<p>I'd value hearing more about how rabbinic tradition handles such things, to come to the decisions you have before you today, with reference to this particular question. In this case, what is the connection between what is written in the verses and what is passed down through the generations? Is it even possible for us to know why it matters to specify times for saying it?</p>\n<h1>Edit</h1>\n<p>I'm not challenging the validity of the Talmud or the binding nature of practice about this point, within the context of Judaism. I'm just wondering if there's anything else in rabbinic writings about how the Shema came to be said in this way. Or, if it <em>did</em> happen to be a case of rabbinic tradition and fences: How might it hypothetically have happened within the processes of Jewish law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What I'm confused about is the stretch from simply saying it whenever you go to bed to this whole concern of deciding what time is appropriate to do so every day. ... Do you think this interest with times is a 'fence' measure to make sure an original (oral) Torah law to say Shema is kept, similarly to the statement in the mishnah about why the sages said 'until midnight'?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As is explained in the mentioned mishnah, the time of midnight is a fence. However, the concept of having times at all is from the Torah, which specifies (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0506.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>) \"When you lie down and when you get up.\" We learn from this that there are specified times; according to Rabbi Eli'ezer the time of lying down is until the end of the first watch, and according to the rabbis is the whole night; after this time it can no longer be described as a time of lying down according to the respective opinions. So to answer this part of the question, no, the times were not a fence, other than the midnight time.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this, I have previously <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/18287/1569\">written</a> that according to Rabbi Eli'ezer, the time for saying Shema is entirely subjective: When each individual goes to sleep and wakes up.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of fences is learned from the verse (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0318.htm#30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 18:30</a>) which literally means \"And you should guard my guardings\" — make a fence around the commandments (Bartenura, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0318.htm#30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 1:1</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the connection between what is written in the verses and what is passed down through the generations, here?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is explained at the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22101&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end of the first chapter of Mevo HaTalmud</a> of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharatz Chayus</a>. The written part was given independently of the oral part. The written part contains hints to the oral part that can be used as memory devices. Before the time of the writing of the Mishnah, it was <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/7870/1569\">forbidden to write down the oral Torah</a>. To start, there are about 3,000 two-sided pages in the Talmud; barring that, the author of the Chafetz Chayim (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35254&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">footnote in Shem Olam 1:12</a>) quotes sources that say that the original mishnah contained 600 sdarim (compared to the current 6) tractate Avodah Zarah was 400 chapters long (the current one is 5 chapters) — assuming consistency in chapter abbreviation for all tractates and same seder length, that's 240,000 times as long, what would be if written (again assuming consistency) 720 million double-sided pages. So having a short, written source to find memorization devices would have been extremely important. But reading the written section alone obviously won't teach you all the laws (I have heard it compared to notes written in shorthand, comprehensible only to one who has previously heard the lecture on which the notes were based).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The answer to your questions lies in understanding what the Oral Torah is.  It is not just fences and interpretations of the rabbis, but it was given together with the written Torah at Sinai as Rambam states in the Beginning of his Introduction to Mishne Torah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All the commandments that were given to Moshe at Sinai were given together with their interpretation, as it is written \"and I will give thee the Tables of Stone, and the Law, and the Commandment\" (Exodus 24,12).  \"Law\" is the Written Law; and \"Commandment\" is its interpretation:  We were commanded to fulfill the Law, according to the Commandment.  And this Commandment is what is called the Oral Law\".<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/e0000.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/e0000.htm</a>) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the fact that there does not seem to be a clear connection between the verse where the Mitzvah of Shema is derived and how the Mitvah is performed from does not matter.  The Oral Torah contains all the details of how the mitzvah is performed and that comes directly from the Torah as is was given at Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>As for the fences like saying Shema before before Chatzos (Rambam, Mishne Torah, Sefer Ahava, 1:10 <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2101.htm</a>), that is an institution of the Rabbis after the giving of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>this is a very good question. the way the Talmud today is set up was a reaction to preserving the laws and how the written Torah is to be understood. As such there were two aspects of the Torah that were given at mount sinai to the Jewish people which were the oral Torah and the written Torah. The discussions of the Rabbis in the Talmud are about the oral Torah that was given to Moses and the Jewish people. As such there are many aspects of the written Torah which can only be fully understood within the context of the whole Torah which includes the oral tradition as well.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, the Torah is like multi-faceted painting and cannot be fully grasped without stepping back and looking at the larger picture. </p>\n\n\n",

As such, one should take great care before assuming any late ascription to be correct.</p>\n<p>To cite <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>His attitude toward the Kabbalah is determined by his conservative standpoint. Its elements, as far as they can be traced back to the Talmud, he considered to be true. When the inhabitants of Fez made inquiries regarding the proportions of God,[37] he answered, as one of the signers of the responsum, that God is above any corporeal qualification and that the Talmud forbids the public discussion of these things.[38] His answer to the question regarding the interpretation of the Talmudic tradition that four men entered paradise is interesting, and has caused much discussion.[39] He refers to the opinion of various scholars that specially favored persons could attain, by means of castigation and the reciting of psalms, to an ecstatic state in which they might behold the heavenly halls (\"hekalot\") as vividly as if they really had entered them. Contrary to his father-in-law, Samuel ben Hofni, gaon of Sura, he followed former scholars in deeming it not impossible that God should reveal the marvels of heaven to the pious while in this state of ecstasy.[40] But all the elements of the later Kabbalah not found in Talmudic tradition, as the belief that miracles could be performed with the names of God, he designated as foolishness not credited by any sensible man.</p>\n<p>The best characterization of Hai is given by Steinschneider;[41]: \"Certain Kabbalistic pieces were ascribed to him; but in truth he was no mystic in the usual sense of the word. In fact he fought against superstition. He was an orthodox Jew, in possession of general culture, but hostile to deeper philosophical research.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of the Sefer HaKemitza, ascribed to Rav Hai Gaon in the accepted answer, see this thread at <a href=\"http://www.bhol.co.il/forum/topic.asp?cat_id=38&topic_id=2962373&forum_id=19616\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechadrei Chareidim</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בויקיפדיה מובא כי רב האי גאון חיבר ספר בקבלה הנקרא \" ספר הקמיצה \" . אך מחיפוש בגוגל מצאתי מאמר בספר היובל לר\"ב לוין בו כתוב שציטוטים המובאים אצל ר\"מ בוטריל בשם \"ספר הקמיצה\" הם בדויים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My translation:</p>\n<p>\"In Wikipedia is brought that Rav Hai Gaon composed a kabbalah sefer called Sefer HaKemitza.

    "title": "Non-Jews learning or being taught Torah",
    "content": "# Non-Jews learning or being taught Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read on Mi Yodeya, and elsewhere on the Internet, that <strong>the Gemara (Chagigah 13a) says that Jews can't teach Torah to gentiles, and that according to Tosefot (Chagigah 13a sv. ein) this is because the Torah belongs to the Jewish people</strong> as part of your national uniqueness. Studying Torah is something that shouldn't be stolen by gentiles so as to blur the lines of and lessen the distinctness of the calling you've been given in the world and in the kingdom of God. <strong>The Rambam held (in Mishneh Torah) that gentiles can do many Jewish practices out of curiosity or as an optional mitzvah, but absolutely not Torah study</strong> or keeping Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure what the connection is here between oral Torah and written Torah. I know that some rabbis have made distinctions between Torah that is relevant to all humanity and that which is only instructive for Jewish practice (and forbidden to gentiles). I also assume that there are some levels and methods of passed on tradition that may have been held more closely to the identity of Jewish Torah learning than other widely known things.</p>\n\n<p>This brings me to two questions: one is personal, the other is in the context of Jewish community. The situation is made unclear by a number of things. Many gentiles who are interested in Judaism have grown up with a form of Tanach and of actual faith in it (though this was already an issue for the Tosafists), and so feel both entitled and connected to it. Specific examples might also be helpful for answering confusion about the oral Law. Second, Jews have wanted to share the light of who God is, and also to avoid persecution and unpleasant relationships, by making a space for gentiles to hear Torah and Judaism. Third, there are gentiles who want either to convert or to be connected with the Jewish community through belief (these are two quite separate cases in a question like this), and so deliberately spend time with and learn from (and with) the community.</p>\n\n<p>So personally, <strong>if I make the choice to honour the opinions of the leaders of Judaism about what is appropriate for gentiles to do and about what is most honouring to the program that God has set out for Israel... how do I know what to read, both out of devotion (not to practice Judaism but to recognise the light it sheds on the human relationship with God) and out of curiosity (academic or in understanding the community I'm in relationship with)? It seems basic, but at a foundational level, is it appropriate for gentiles to read (all of) Tanach? If so, how about reading books about Jewish law, or the Talmud itself; issues pertaining to gentiles directly, or laws pertaining only to Jews that are still meaningful to read? Listening to yeshiva-type classes about these things online, if I chose to? How about reading Kabbalistic works, or Jewish devotional literature? Listening to people talking with their kids about Torah on Shabbos, or coming to shiurim (which I've been allowed to do)? I recognise that there are many opinions that would allow some or all of these things, but I haven't learnt about how I'm meant to deal with a multiplicity of authorities that allowed and prohibited the one thing.</strong> Surely I can't just glean and put together opinions to rely on that are most convenient to me, such as the idea that gentiles are fine reading what we want to out of curiosity and that we can be in a mixed group of Jews and gentiles learning, or that we can be taught certain material. If I take those views, then what about the original concern that something might be diminished from the Jewish testimony by allowing gentiles in freely to its circles? What does God want people like me to be doing, and on what basis does the Jewish community give me a unified decision about what is considered appropriate by you with the things you guard? This is important to me both in my relationship with God and in my decisions regarding study at uni. (It's already complicated with knowing how to engage with secular and other religions' material in a healthy way, both for enjoyment of and identification with those things and with my own culture, and for studying them as literature.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>The other question is not about what I should do, but rather what Jewish leaders are comfortable with people doing in your own community.</strong> Some of the situations written about in the paragraph above are relevant in this way. It doesn't matter what is convenient or polite or 'done everywhere', it matters what is really right and good in the bigger context, with precedents appropriately translated across. I have asked some rabbis what they think about this as well, and I'll see what they think, but I wouldn't mind hearing as many angles, thoughts, and sources about this as could be found through Mi Yodeya.</p>\n\n<p>This is related to the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/23024/non-jews-praying-with-the-jewish-community\">question</a> I posted yesterday. In both of these, if I know what is open to me and what is closed, in a way that best serves and guards the Jewish relationship with Hashem, then I can find breadth in relationship with Him and with your community within that space that is left.</p>\n\n<p>It comes down both to what is instructed in a binding way, and to what is most honouring to God (and to people in Judaism) in His plan and His ways. This is difficult for me because my foundations have been shaken a lot this year in being challenged by Judaism not to hold to Christianity, so on the one hand I'm walking near to God's heart and wanting to honour Him according to what is revealed in the sphere of Judaism as well as the things I sense naturally; on the other hand, I wonder how much of this He really revealed, and how much is human traditions that I'm merely involved with and abiding by because of habit, community, stability, and things like that. That's hard to deal with in the choice to live in faith and faithfulness. Anyway. It's an important conversation, answers are welcome :)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>Your question, as I understand it, boils down to: (a) how do I sort out the conflicting sources on what I'm allowed to study so I don't cross a boundary?  and (b) how do I comply with community norms?</p>\n\n<p>These are challenges faced by outsiders to any community, and ours doesn't make it easy.  One esteemed source will say \"the halacha is X\" and another will say \"the halacha is not X\" and a third will say \"the first guy is right but you shouldn't do X anyway\" -- how do you navigate that on your own?  In an ideal world you don't; Judaism exists in a <em>community</em> as part of a <em>tradition</em>, and we weren't meant to figure it out alone.  Pirke Avot teaches us \"make for yourself a rav\", meaning to find yourself a (singular, consistent) teacher.  Doing your own research is certainly encouraged too, but it'll only get you so far and eventually you need to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">consult a rabbi</a>.  In your case it sounds like you already have some sort of a relationship with a rabbi, so you can seek his guidance.  Don't be afraid of \"bothering him\" with questions.</p>\n\n<p>An additional thought (no source, just my opinion): if somebody is putting something out there for the world (or the town, or whatever), on a web site or in a public lecture or the like, then it is probably ok for \"just anybody\" to read, and if it's not the transgression is really on the part of the person doing the teaching/publishing.  Gentiles are bound by the seven Noachide laws and \"don't study torah\" isn't one of them.  As you've found, some would restrict this more than others, but it isn't clear-cut the way some other laws are.  Now I'm talking here about \"public\" teaching; if somebody is offering a small, private class on some topic you should inquire, of your rabbi and/or of the teacher, if you may attend.  Make your inquiry privately, not in front of the class, so there's no implicit pressure on the teacher.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Shalom Annelise. It is a pleasure to meet an enlightened gentile who has much respect for Hashem and His Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Many opinions allow you to learn the Written Law (Tanach) and the commentaries to gain clarity of its message, but try not to go too in depth if it is not necessary for your relationship with Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>I've heard from a few esteemed Rabbis that non-Jews are allowed to learn Jewish ethics based on the Oral Law because it will help you become a better servant of Hashem and deepen your faith in Him. I don't believe this extends to the deeper teachings which are based on mysticism (Kaballa). There are innumerable texts on ethics available.  </p>\n\n<p>However, if you have doubts concerning theology and related matters that bother you and which naturally have answers in Kaballa, then Jews may help answer your questions as necessary for your quest for clarity, although it is prudent on their part not to reveal too much of the secrets to Noahides. </p>\n\n<p>As for Oral laws, the Talmud (according to many authorities) allows you to learn those laws which are applicable to you (i.e., those that relate to the 7 categories of Noahide law). Some authorities allow Noahides to voluntarily do certain rituals (mitzvoth); therefore, you will be able to learn the laws for those practices. Also, Jewish ethics may include the laws of lashon hara (evil speech), and charity. It is unclear if you are bound to the letter of those laws; however, you should be able to voluntarily uphold them and other ethical or financially related laws, especially if your society has evolved to keep some forms of ethics (e.g., anti-slander, charity, interest restrictions etc.), whether it be law or merely social norms.</p>\n\n<p>Note that there are different opinions on what Noahides cannot learn and an early source even limits that strictly to Kaballa (mainly because of its intimate nature). Yet, I just wrote what some Rabbis have told me how to actually practice. There is no High Court in Judaism yet, so there will be different opinions until the court is established.</p>\n\n<p>As for the rest of the Torah which is unnecessary for your relationship with Hashem, don't worry if you accidentally learn it. You mean well and Hashem understands you. The most important aspect is your heart's pure intent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>R' Moshe Weiner brings an answer in the <a href=\"https://asknoah.org/books/sheva-mitzvot-hashem\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Sefer Sheva Mitzvot</em></a> (translated into English as <em>The Divine Code</em>).</p>\n\n<p>He distinguishes two ways of learning: One might delve deep into the reasons for the rulings, trace the derivations, engage in pilpul.

Does it matter if the abused party denies the allegation? What if the abused party requests that nothing be done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This question does not have an easy answer and it certainly depends upon which community you belong (e.g. Hasidic, Modern Orthodox, etc.).  As an attorney and an officer of the court (in Pennsylavania and the District of Columbia), I have to first tell you that a witness to a crime has an on-going responsibility to report the crime.  Failure to report could subject you to criminal penalties or civil suit.  Be that as it may, in many of the Chasidic camps, a witness would be required to ask a rav (most likely the rebbe).  The rav then would focus his questions to determine whether the abuser is a continuing threat.  If so, then he would authorize you to report the crime to the authorities; he may even order you to do so.  But given the Biblical injunction to judge others charitably (Vayikra 19:15), and the reluctance of chassidic scholars to recognize any secular governments as sufficiently fair to permit application of the concept of <em>dina d'malkusa dina</em>, it is very possible he will instruct you to keep it to yourself.  Then, if you report the crime without a rebbe's permission, then you might be considered a <em>moser</em> (informer) and subject to shunning or worse.  Oy!  AFAIK, the non-Chasidic authorities today would not require you to go to a rav before going to the police.  They rely, in part, on the position of the Aruch HaShulchan which said that the laws of fair and democratic states should be honored under <em>dina d'malkusa dina</em>.  Chasidim reject that: they argue that, because the Aruch HaShulchan gave England and Tsarist Russia as two examples of such \"fair\" legal systems, the entire ruling is suspect as a censor's edit.  Rabbi Yitzhok Breitowitz, shlita, however, makes the interesting point that it is not a censor's edit.  He argues that had the censor written the ruling, he would not have mentioned England.  He believes that the Aruch HaShulchan believed he would be censored if he only mentioned England and not Tsarist Russia as examples, and that he added Russia in order to avoid problems with the censor.  That makes sense to me.  </p>\n\n<p>As for your question about reporting a crime when the victim asks you not to, I suspect that you are talking about spousal abuse.  When I was in college, I worked on a crisis intervention hotline.  I remember taking a call from a woman who needed the number for the women's shelter and having to hang up the phone before I could give her the number.  I had this terrible image of the woman being beaten by her jealous husband shortly after hanging up with me.  I can't give you a halachic view on this issue.  But I would urge you to contact your local chapter of the <a href=\"http://jcada.org/www\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Coalition Against Domestic Abuse</a> (JCADA) for more practical assistance.  You should also discuss this with your rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

They may have different reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Most societies (agreed, not all) have held these two acts to be contemptuous or taboo, which may mean that it's an area of morality which should be self-evident, and if it isn't obvious, then you should check your moral intuition. I personally am not inclined to such a view (though I may be guilty of tainting myself by taking college courses in ethics). However, I believe that <strong>R. Yitzchak Arama</strong> (Vayikra Shaar 64), R. Moshe Feinstein (see Y.D. 3:115 where he discusses homosexuality) do think so, as well as other great Rabbis. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Ramban</strong> (Vayikra 18:6 and 18:29) alludes to a 'hidden' reason, but says that ultimately, these prohibitions are <em>gezairos melekh</em>, but unintelligible to humans. His 'hidden' reason is probably something along the lines of <strong>Rabbeinu Bachya</strong>'s mystical explanation (ibid.) because the Ramban seems to use similar terminology regarding kilayim.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rambam</strong> in Moreh Nevuchim 3:49 states that the reason for sexual prohibitions are to limit indulgence in said act. While this may not be so satisfying an answer as to why it should be punished so severely, bear in mind that the Rambam believed in asceticism as a prerequisite to intellectual growth, which is the point of the entire Torah. The main point of asceticism is that a person should not even think about these matters at all, to keep his mind focused on lofty things. Therefore, he writes, the Torah gave <em>arayos</em> penalty of death to stop a person from even thinking of committing these sins. <strong>Ibn Ezra</strong> to Vayikra 18:6 seems to allude to this as the reason as well.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Rambam</strong> in the same passage there states that the prohibitions of incest and adultery also prevent one from acting brazenly towards the women whom he should respect. <strong>Sefer HaChinuch</strong> (Mitzvah 35) believes that this is a separate reason and likes it better than the first. See below for further elaboration. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Rav Saadia Gaon</strong> (Emunos Vedeios 3:2) begins with a similar reason as the Rambam, but adds that incest is prohibited because if men were allowed to marry their sisters, then men would marry only their most beautiful sisters while the other girls would be shunned by all other men because even their own brothers didn't like them enough to marry them. His explanation may sound a bit odd and far-fetched to the modern ear though, but reading this gave me an idea.  </p>\n\n<p>If I may elaborate on and modernize these Medieval approaches, and combine it with the sense that I get from <strong>Maharal</strong> (Nesiv Hateshuvah 2) as well as the commentary of <strong>R. S. R. Hirsch</strong> (Vayikra 18:6), I think the picture that emerges is as follows. The most important social institutions for all aspects of moral and religious development is the family. Violations of both adultery and incest violate this familial structure. Marriage is a sacred partnership, where two people help each other fulfill God's role for humankind, and one that necessitates exclusivity (polygamy notwithstanding). On a different level, Rambam and R. Saadia Gaon  point to the fact that family members need to act a certain way towards each other, and if they don't, if they taint their family structure, they lose their ability to relate to <em>all</em> of humanity with the proper dignity. These structures that are at the core of a person's relationships create the framework for treating both man and God as necessary. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Hirsch</a> notes that the Big Three are echoed in the laws for the Altar that God gives as an \"epilogue\" to the Assembly at Sinai in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881#v19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 20:19-23</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Whatever v. 20 comes to prohibit, (according to the Midrash <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881/showrashi/true#v20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cited by Rashi</a>, various misuses of angelic icons are included) it clearly echoes idol worship.</p></li>\n<li><p>Not making the Altar of cut stones (v. 22) \"lest you wield your sword upon it and desecrate it\" echoes murder.</p></li>\n<li><p>Not ascending steps to the Altar (v. 23) \"so that your nakedness shall not be exposed upon it\" echoes immorality (and even uses a form of the term \"gilui 'arayot\").</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He says that the point of these laws is to tell us that the central symbol of our service of God, the Altar, has to represent the fundamentals of our actual service - our adherence to the three fundamental laws.

This is His למינו-Law [\"according to its species\" i.e. natural law with respect to propagation of species - IM] for the human race, which in the sphere of plant and animal sexes is carried out immutably by the almighty power of His Word at their creation, but which His one creature with moral free will, His Adam, His Man, is to accept from His Mouth to carry it out with his moral free will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>(my bracketed comments where indicated)</em></p>\n\n<p>To our purpose, I think what he's saying is that sexual morality is the paradigm of human adherence to God's Law through choice. A person who violates this Law turns his back on his mission as a human being, just as an apple tree that somehow decided to produce grapes instead would be turning its back on its mission as an apple tree.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>there is a chazal that arayot and kedusha (holiness) cannot co-exist.</p>\n\n<p>since the purpose of torah is to induce a person to sanctify himself, then transgressing arayot is becoming the diametrical opposite of what God wants.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, this is why the gedolim are so scared about the internet and have labeled it the greatest problem of all time - due to all the pritzut one can easily access, and this ruins a person from the inside.</p>\n\n<p>one who gets involved in such things can become irreparably corrupt as we saw by the flood whose main sin was arayot.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus these people posses very rarefied souls who are extremely close to their ultimate tikkun.

It is one of my favorites. I believe that those that are imperfect are here in order for us to perfect ourselves. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A young boy, Shaya, attends a special school during the week, Chush,\n  for learning-disabled children. He loves baseball, but because of his\n  lack of coordination isn't often chosen to play. One time Shaya came\n  to Yeshiva Darchei Torah, where he learned on Sundays, as his\n  classmates were playing ball. His father asks if Shaya can play. Being\n  six runs behind and in the eighth inning, they figured, \"Why not?\" and\n  Shaya went out to play short center field. I will now let the master\n  story teller, Rabbi Krohn, take over the telling of the story:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shaya's team scored a few runs,\n  but was still behind by three. In the bottom of the ninth inning,\n  Shaya's team scored again and now with two outs and the bases loaded\n  and the potential winning runs on base, Shaya was scheduled to be up.\n  Would the team actually let Shaya bat at this juncture and give away\n  their chance to win the game? \"Surprisingly, Shaya was told to take a\n  bat and try to get a hit. Everyone knew that it was all but\n  impossible, for Shaya didn't even know how to hold the bat properly,\n  let alone hit with it. However, as Shaya stepped up to the plate, the\n  pitcher moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so that Shaya\n  should at least be able to make contact. \"The first pitch came in and\n  Shaya swung clumsily and missed. One of Shaya's teammates came up to\n  Shaya and together they held the bat and faced the pitcher waiting for\n  the next pitch. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the\n  ball softly towards Shaya. \"As the next pitch came in, Shaya and his\n  teammate swung the bat and together they hit a slow ground ball to the\n  pitcher. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have\n  thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and\n  that would have ended the game. \"Instead, the pitcher took the ball\n  and threw it on a high arc to right field, far and wide beyond the\n  first baseman's reach. Everyone started yelling, 'Shaya, run to first!\n  Shaya, run to first!' Never in his life had Shaya run to first. \"He\n  scampered down the baseline wide-eyed and startled. By the time he\n  reached first base, the right fielder had the ball. He could have\n  thrown the ball to the second baseman who would tag out Shaya, who was\n  still running. But the rightfielder understood what the pitcher's\n  intentions were, so he threw the ball high and far over the head of\n  the third baseman's head, as everyone yelled, 'Shaya, run to second!\n  Shaya run to second!' \"Shaya ran towards second base as the runners\n  ahead of him deliriously circled the bases towards home. As Shaya\n  reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran towards him, turned\n  him toward the direction of third base and shouted, 'Shay, run to\n  third!' \"As Shaya rounded third, the boys from both teams ran behind\n  screaming, 'Shaya, run home! Shaya, run home!\" \"Shaya ran home,\n  stepped on home plate and all 18 boys lifted him on their shoulders\n  and made him the hero, as he had just hit the 'grand slam' and won the\n  game for his team.\" Concludes Rabbi Krohn about the lesson of this\n  story, \"Too often we seek to find favor and give honor to those who\n  have more than us. But there are people who have fewer friends than\n  we, less money, and less prestige. Those people especially need\n  attention and recognition. We should try to achieve the level of\n  perfection in human relationships which the boys on the ballfield at\n  Yeshiva Darchei Torah achieved. Because if children can do it, we\n  adults should certainly be able to accomplish it as well.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>None of G-d's creations exist for no reason.  As Rabbi Akiva's teacher, Rabbi Nachum Ish Gam Zu, taught him, <em>gam zu l'tovah</em> -- everything is for the (Divine) Good.  What that is, we don't always know.  When trouble happens to us, individually, it may be a message from G-d.  Talmud Bavli Berachot 5a tells us that when hard times falls on us, individually, we should first look at our deeds.  If they are lacking, then we should reform.  If not our deeds, then perhaps our Torah study.  But if not that, one may be a righteous person whom G-d has placed the burden of punishment that others would have received for their sins, but for G-d's understanding that further punishment would push those people away from Him.  These are called \"Afflictions of Love.\"  We are forbidden, however, to assume that the suffering others receive was punishment for their sins.  We don't know and cannot assume, as we learn from the Book of Job.  </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Benjamin Blech, in his book <em>If G-d is Good Why is the World So Bad</em>, addresses this issue head-on pointing out that at all times we have to recognize that (1) G-d is good; (2) G-d is all-powerful; and (3) G-d, in giving us free will, decided to not control our lives as if we were puppets and therefore allows people who choose evil to challenge those who chose good.</p>\n\n<p>So what of the case you raised -- a child suffering from mental or physical ailments?  They clearly didn't do anything to merit punishment.  No, they didn't.  But there may be a Big Picture we don't understand.  It is said that G-d created the insane in King David's days so that he could learn by their example and pretend to be insane in order to escape capture.  The child might be an opportunity for a young volunteer to learn about helping others and caring more about the needs of others besiders herself.  This was my daughter's experience as a teen when she (and many other boys and girls) took care of a boy who had been permanently brain-damaged in a swimming pool accident.  My daughter gained so much from that experience that it almost seems that the boy was sent there by G-d for her and others.  Rabbi Blech explains that G-d repays the souls of those who had to live such lives.  My Rav explained that the boy gained credit for all of the mitzvas done by his young aides and all of their future mitzvas that he inspired them to do, even indirectly.</p>\n\n\n",

However there's  an issur d'rabonon in both cases. In the case of putting something into the oven, the food has to reach \"ochel Ben deurso\". Which is about 1/3 cooked in order to  violate shabbos. In the case of the seed it's trickier aside from the rabbinic prohibition of handling the seed (because it's muktzeh)  it can be more severe. If your intent was to take it out before it sprouted roots, then you wouldn't be obligated to bring a sin offering (meaning it's only a rabbinical prohibition which is under not doing half melachos.) however If your intention was for it to sprout roots then you WOULD have indeed been mechallel shabbos. Because the normal way to seed is to plant seeds into the ground and wait past that day for it to sprout roots.</p>\n\n\n",

David Bleich (in the first class of of his Ishut series in 2010, which alas YUtorah.org does not have. Here is the first class the next year, which hopefully includes him saying that <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/761178/Rabbi_Dr_J_David_Bleich/Ishus_#1_of_3_5771\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>), the value of naming after a relative is Kabbalistic. He went on to say that this Kabbalistic benefit* only takes effect if in fact the name is identical. So if I name my child Moshe because it was my grandfather's name, or Chaim because it was my other grandfather's name, some sort of benefit goes to those relatives. If I name him Moshe Chaim, no such benefit goes to either of them.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rabbi Bleich thinks the value of making family happy is greater than the value of Kabbalistic benefit. So, naming with an initial, or a gender-flipped equivalent, or a translation, or such does not achieve Kabbalistic benefit. It does achieve happiness of family (presumably), and as such is of value for that reason.</p>\n\n<p>*(This benefit may be to the deceased who get some form of extra credit from their namesake's mitzvot over and above the credit the relative would ge for descendant's mitzvot. Alternatively, it might be that the baby gets extra doses of good midot from the deceased (which frankly could work without Kabbalah, and merely through psychology). Or it could be both.

    "content": "# How can I make my Judaism more enjoyable?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I really enjoy being Jewish, most of the time, but let's be honest, sometimes it can be difficult to enjoy Judaism. Sometimes it's the little things, like having to wait those extra minutes to eat dairy, and sometimes it's the big things, like not wanting to abide by a million rules every single day. Furthermore, as a parent, I know it's important to model exciting and enthusiastic Judaism for my kids, not just bland rule adherence. Not to mention my fear of Devarim 28:47 -  תַּחַת, אֲשֶׁר לֹא-עָבַדְתָּ אֶת-יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ, בְּשִׂמְחָה, וּבְטוּב לֵבָב--מֵרֹב, כֹּל.</p>\n\n<p>Rolling all these things up I realize how important it is to enthusiastically enjoy Judaism. But I'm also finding it harder and harder to do. What are some tried-and-true suggestions for how to combat this based on your own expertise or sourced statements from our tradition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>That reminds me of the anecdote from Rabbi Emanuel Feldman's book, Tales Out of Shul. A woman once told him, \"Rabbi, I'm really not enjoying this week of mourning.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not everything in life (or Judaism) has to be enjoyable. Nor is it meant to be. <em>At least not in the immediate gratification, self-centered sense of the word.</em> Sometimes your enjoyment should not be based on your enjoyment, but on someone else's enjoyment.</p>\n\n<p>Really, enjoyment of life (or Judaism) depends on your outlook. You can think \"Oy, I've got jury duty\" or you can think \"Thank G-d I live in a country where there are juries, and not a country where the courts are a sham or even nonexistent.\" You can think \"Oy,  I can't eat that tasty chazzer\" or you can think \"Wait a second, G-d recreates me every moment. He's given me a mission and hence, a purpose. I'm an essential part of the greatest achievement humankind will ever be part of! And all I have to do is not eat the ham and have a steak instead? Score!\"</p>\n\n<p>Also, shop around. Different flavors of Judaism have different perspectives on things. Listen to a mussar shiur, or a chassidus shiur. Ask a Sephardi, an Ashkenazi a Yemenite, etc., what perspectives their traditions give on things that annoy you. Don't be afraid to learn more about different perspectives.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br>\nThis is not a Judaism issue, it's a life issue. It's all about perspective. Everything that appears to be non-enjoyable is really a matter of looking at it the wrong way. Learn positive perspectives from others.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I changed my views on how I see Judaism. I find Judaism exciting and interesting because I went to a completely new place with it. If you can find a Jewish practice that gets you excited then go and do it. I found that participating in Shabbat activities with my host family got me more excited. I joined a program that teaches Jewish value through sisterhood and arts and crafts. I made learning and my religion more exciting. I infused my Jewish life with something that I love and enjoy doing like arts and crafts. </p>\n\n<p>Another great way is to put the excitement with your kids. That little wait to eat dairy, think about how you are letting that meat you ate recently digest and you won't feel sluggish when your child asks you to play. Keep that bit in mind. I love child activities that make it simpler. I don't talk down to kids. They are really capable. I put the spin of the ultimate superhero with G-d in mind when teaching my cousin about Judaism. Now whenever I think about G-d I think of that character that can do anything and I will start laughing, no matter how many times I have done it, I will. I love the dancing and I love putting the positive on the laws. That is another thing that can help. There is the negative and positive side to each law. Instead of I can't... put I can only do... This is just what worked for me when I needed a spark in Judaism. I had to become a kid again.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>B\"H\nIt's a privilege to be Jewish. Think about what our ancestors gave up, including their very lives, so that you could live to do these mitzvos. Think how much nachas and satisfaction they would derive from watching you do even one trivial and boring and tedious mitzva. How much more pleasure, then, does G-d take from watching it?</p>\n\n<p>The \"ultimate accounting\" thing seems bizarre, since the world is apparently unjust. But I have no doubt that there is a secret accounting that goes on above and below our knowledge. The pleasure for your mitzvos is somewhere else, but it really exists. If you can believe that, it is yours. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How, if at all, can \"frum\" Jewish men justify their consorting with prostitutes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A friend of mine is a part-time magistrate in Sullivan County, New York.  He often hears cases of hasidic men being caught with prostitutes.  Moreover, he tells me that the cases of STDs among hasidim in Sullivan County is surprisingly consistent with county-wide infections overall.  I was shocked.  Many in the frum community are unaware of this, which is unfortunate because it is a serious public health issue.  My question:  How can these men -- who wouldn't dream of having relations with their wives while nidah -- consort with non-Jewish prostitutes?  Isn't a non-Jewish woman also in the class of a nidah?  Are they thinking, \"if Yehudah could go to a prostitute, it's OK?\". I believe that their behavior is 100% wrong, but I understand that some offer a \"halachic\" rationale for their illicit behavior.  What, if anything, could they possibly argue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>The premise of your question seems to be that ostensibly religious people never sin, which is obviously absurd. These men are sinners, who are acting in violation of Jewish law, and if their behavior ever became public knowledge, it would scandalize their communities.</p>\n\n<p>The simple reality is that sexual immorality is not, and never has been, exceptional or unusual. Sexual sin exists in every human society, and the Orthodox Jewish world is no exception. Maimonides writes (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960670/jewish/Chapter-Twenty-Two.htm\"><em>Hil. Issurei Biah</em> 22:18-19</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is nothing in the entire Torah that is more difficult for the majority of people to separate themselves from than sexual misconduct and forbidden relationships. ... <strong>You will never find a community that does not have some people who are promiscuous regarding forbidden relationships and prohibited sexual conduct.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>First of all: the behavior you describe is <strong>wrong</strong>. Let's make that entirely clear.</p>\n\n<p>I can think of two-and-a-half justifications people may use, to better understand the phenomenon (if it truly is a phenomenon).</p>\n\n<p>1a: Halachically speaking, the Biblical prohibition of \"nida\" per se only applies to Jewish women. (See Rambam Issurei Biah 4:4). (Rabbinically, <em>all</em> gentile women are automatically <em>nida</em> as well, but that's at the rabbinic level.) It would appear that the Torah was focused on conduct within the Jewish community; it was so crazy for someone to go outside it that it never bothered to apply these prohibitions there.</p>\n\n<p>1b: As a corollary, this could (if read sideways through a giant ton of personal bias) lead someone to believe that Judaism only cares about how you deal with other Jews; anything to do with a non-Jew somehow \"doesn't count for real.\" G-d forbid! But I could see how someone could think that.</p>\n\n<p>2: Rabbi Aaron Rakkefet-Rothkoff has suggested that in certain circles of certain Hassidic communities, there is little legitimate room for honest intimacy (at the emotional or physical level) between a husband and wife, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/11942/sources-for-hassidic-views-on-marital-celibacy-asceticism\">due to ideas of \"modesty\" and \"holiness\" taken to some rather sharp extremes</a>. Just as the Talmud discusses (with horror) a lifestyle whereby one wife is \"for procreation\" and one is sterilized and used \"for pleasure\", a misguided individual could conclude that his respectable, publicly-appropriate wife gives him no opportunity whatsoever for physical enjoyment -- and nor could or should she; therefore he goes for something \"on the side.\"</p>\n\n<p>The remedy for this, obviously, is for the community to validate a strong, two-way relationship (emotional, spiritual, and yes, physical) between spouses. When the Talmud applies \"love your peer as yourself\" to your spouse, that's a subtle reminder that while that person of the opposite gender has some different laws in Judaism, she is still a human being, and she is still your peer.</p>\n\n<p>Once again I can't begin to defend any such actions (which I hope are rare); but I think this may explain the mentality behind them. And of course, humans are very complex creatures and their desires can lead them into some very strange thinking and behaviors.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Were there any other religions before Judaism that their followers should convert to Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>You could imagine that with the advent of a new religion, any followers of the last religion would be required to convert to the new religion.</p>\n\n<p>Which followers of which religion converted to Judaism, when Judaism came on the scene?</p>\n\n<p>How did they know that they had to convert to Judaism? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Your question implies that when a new religion shows up everyone switches to it like it's the latest new technology.</p>\n\n<p>That is NOT the case. Some people did convert (a notable example is Yitro AKA Jethro), plus some Egyptians (the erev rav) and Canaanites. But the vast majority of the world did not convert.</p>\n\n<p>And on top of that, Judaism does not ask them to. A non-Jew does not need to convert in order to have a meaningful relationship with God.</p>\n\n<p>In general when Judaism \"came on the scene\" as you call it, its members were all descendants of Abraham.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>No such \"switch\" happened. According to the simplest understanding of Jewish history, Judaism started with one man, Avraham, who recognized the creator of the world. He came to this realization himself, independent of anyone else. G-d blessed him that his descendants would be numerous, and they were. Several hundred years later, his descendants stood at Mount Sinai and received the Torah from G-d. </p>\n\n<p>Every Jew today is either a descendant of those people, descended from people who converted somewhere along the way, or are converts themselves. Judaism does not claim to \"inherit\" from any other religion as I understand Christianity and Islam claim to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>i'm only going to post this answer because i didn't see anyone else cover these topics.</p>\n\n<p>Many people think that before Abraham, no one worshipped God. But this isn't true, because we have Melkhitzedek who was a priest of God. If there is a priest of God, then more than likely there is some sort of formalized religion, or at the very least, a tradition passed down regarding God. Not much is said about Melchitzedek, so we can only speculate. But it can deifnitely be said that Avraham was successful where Melchitzedek failed, since Melchitzedek didn't spread monotheism throughout the world or convert any followers (that we know of). We also have the example of Bilaam knowing about God and being a valid prophet, another sign that this \"Jewish religion\" wasn't unique to the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>So even though most of the world had varying pagan religions, there were a few monotheistic strains around. These were probably remnants of oral traditions brought down by the descendants of Noah, and throughout time much of that knowledge was probably lost due to lack of writing and lack of reading ability. Once one of the oral tradition transmitters dies, the information can never be brought back.</p>\n\n<p>So the answer to your question was no, there wasn't any systemized religion that  needed to \"upgrade to Judaism.\" Even when people say the other religions were \"paganism,\" it wasn't like there was an official pagan religion that everyone belonged to. There were hundreds if not thousands of different gods, or even differing beliefs on the same gods. There were even ancestral gods that belonged to families/clans. But what is clear is that the Biblical text makes note that there were other monotheists around, but that they didn't take any action to spread it as a religion.</p>\n\n\n",

God is sure to grant you special providence and bring you out of this land, to the land that he swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.' Joseph then bound the Israelites by an oath: 'When God grants you [this] special providence, you must bring my remains out of this place.' Joseph died at the age of 110 years.

Midrash Mishlai 16 says בא ולמד מיוסף הצדיק, שמתוך שעמד ונתחזק בכבוד אביו במצרים זכה לעטרת שיבה, however Pirkai D'Rav Eliezer 39 says  נתקצרו מחייו של יוסף י' שנים בגלל י' פעמים אמרו בני יעקב ליוסף עבדך אבינו ושמע יוסף את הדבר ושתק. The Lubavitcher rabbi explains that the two Midrashim are consistent with each other. In comparison to his brothers he lived a short life, however in comparison to most other people he lived a long life. He goes on to say there is a difference between Braishis 50:22 where it says ויחי יוסף and Yosef lived 110 years to Braishis 50:26 where it says וימת יוסף and Yosef died at 110 years. The first Posuk where it says Yosef lived 110 years is indicating Yosef's long life compared to most others. Therefore immediately afterwards it says that he saw even Efraim's great grandchildren and Menashe's grandchildren.

(See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9727&st=&pgnum=37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch EH 5</a>:8,10.)</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=76&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 76a</a>) discusses whether a Kohein who is a Petzua Dakah can marry a convert. (Note that generally a Petzua Daka can marry a convert, while a Kohein cannot.) It hinges the question on whether בקדושתיה קאי he retains his holy status. The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5116.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Issurei Biah 16:1-2</a>) rules that he may marry a convert because he has lost his holy status, but he still may not marry a Mamzer. The Raavad argues on the Rambam and permits a Petzua Dakah to marry even a Mamzer. The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9727&st=&pgnum=37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 5:1</a>) rules like the Rambam, while the Rama and Gra rule like the Raavad.</p>\n\n<p>Chelkat Mechokek (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9727&st=&pgnum=37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 5:1</a>) explains that when the Kohein loses his holy status by becoming a Petzua Daka, he loses it entirely and can now visit cemeteries but can no longer bless the people. Keren Orah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37763&st=&pgnum=104\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 76a sv Hen</a>) rejects this thesis and suggests that they only lose their holy status with respect to forbidden relationships. It would seem Bet Shemuel (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9727&st=&pgnum=37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 5:1</a>) agrees, because he maintains that a Kohein Petzua Dakah retains the prohibition to divorcees and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22495/prohibition-of-a-kohen-marrying-a-zonah\">Zonot</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I'll note that the fact that he has a physical deformity does not alone prevent him from blessing the people as the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%9B%D7%97#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 128:30</a>) rules that only external visible deformities are problematic in this regard.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/758/ariel\">Ariel</a> correctly points out that many vasectomies are reversible.

That said some (see Shu\"t Chatam Sofer <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9218&st=&pgnum=24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 1:14</a>) argue that were this to be possible in a given man, then it will turn out he has always been a Kosher Jew. Accordingly, if there is a chance of reversal of the vasectomy, the Kohein Petzua Dakah shouldn't marry a convert or Mamzer lest it be reversible, nor should he marry a regular Jewess lest it not be reversible.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is what the Rabbis Answeredabout Marrying with a Vasectomy\nThe vasectomy procedure is done on the vas deferens (many, if not most times) inside the body cavity (as opposed to the sexual organ extremities).  The person is therefore not considered a “Petzuah Dakah” of the Torah, and may marrry or remain with his wife if they had a proper orthodox marriage – (source: “Chazon Ish” E.H. 12:7). If the vasectomy was done on the outer organs, then if reconstruction surgery repairs the vasectomy damage, he may marry or remain with his wife (if he was married).  If the reconstruction surgery is not successful, but the majority of the people who have the reconstruction surgery are able to procreate, then even the person who did not have successful reconstruction surgery is still allowed to marry, or remain with his wife (if they had a proper orthodox marriage) – (source: “Igrot Moshe” by R’ M.Feinstein, E.H.

So, he instructed Shelomo to find a way to do so.</p>\n\n<p>According to Malbim's interpretation, Shime'i was not to be put to death( for his crime against David), but his loyalty was not to be trusted, and David forgiving him was not to be considered a precedent for any subsequent crimes. So, he instructed Shelomo to test Shime'i, and only if he found him guilty to execute him, and to not absolve him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39923&st=&pgnum=36\" rel=\"nofollow\">Targum to Esther 2:5</a> says that Mordechai was descended from Shimei ben Geira, as was Esther, and that David's attitude toward Shimei initially was due to his prophetic knowledge of the two saviors of Israel that were to come from him. Once David saw that Shimei had stopped having children, he knew that Mordechai and Esther were accounted for, so he had Solomon kill Shimei.</p>\n\n\n",

The Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9732&st=&pgnum=407\">YD 246:9</a>) codifies this, ruling that a teacher of Torah should not sit on a chair while his students sit on the floor.

Are there no places in the whole world higher than the origins of the Euphrates, that don't draw at all from the Euphrates? - Of course, there are, and the meaning of the phrase \"all the waters of the world\" clearly is: in the whole area, in the whole Middle East.

The truth is, we don't really know what it means. And whatever it is, studying it is dangerous! Some of you may recall the story in BT Hagiga 13a, where a child is studying Ezekiel, ponders over the meaning of <em>hashmal</em>, and was consumed by fire. You have been warned...</p>\n<p>From the context, it appears to be some kind of shining substance. Elsewhere in the pereq we see <em>ke'ein nehoshet</em>, \"like [the colour] of copper\", and in Ezek. 8:2 <em>hashmal</em> is connected to <em>zohar</em>, brightness of some sort. According to Gesenius, <em>hashmal</em> refers to polished bronze: the etymology being [n.]h.sh., \"copper or bronze\" (like <em>nehoshet</em>) + m.l., \"to soften or polish\". Contemporary scholarship (e.g. Brettler's commentary in the Jewish Study Bible, and Bodi's work <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=-nqX8UJNm9sC&pg=PA1&dq=akkadian%20amber\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) seems to argue that it is more likely to be derived from an Akkadian word which is ambiguous in referring both to the substance of amber and to some kind of shining metal.</p>\n<p>Now, the Septuagint translates <em>hashmal</em> as <em>elektron</em>, which (like the Akkadian mentioned above) has two meanings in Greek: a shiny, bronze-coloured metal alloy made from gold and silver (also known as <em>electrum</em> in Latin), and amber, which has the same colour. (By the way, <em>elektron</em> as amber is the root of the word electricity, since the first experiments with electric properties were done with static electricity produced by rubbing pieces of amber. The Hebrew poet Yehuda Leb Gordon therefore <a href=\"http://onthemainline.blogspot.ca/2011/02/what-does-chashmal-mean.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">proposed the word <em>hashmal</em></a> to mean electricity in the late 1800s, which meaning it still has in Modern Hebrew today).</p>\n<p>There are certainly differing interpretations: in Hagiga 13b the rabbis understand it as a <em>notarikon</em>/ acronym for <em>hayyot esh memallelot</em>, \"speaking Beings of fire\", (and thus Rambam puts <em>Hashmallim</em> as the fourth level of angelic being in his classification in <em>Yesodei haTorah</em> 2:7), and other rabbis and <em>mepharshim</em> give other explanations, as the other answers to this question show. But at least on the <em>peshat</em> level, I would say that <em>hashmal</em> appears to refer to a warm shining color, similar to amber and/or a metal like bronze or electrum.</p>\n<p>Edit: Edward Greenstein's work in Holtz's \"Back to the Sources\" directed me to <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/34568\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the beautiful commentary of Rabbi Eliezer of Beaugency</a>, a 12th century French exegete, who writes on the <em>hashmal</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כעין החשמל: בדבר הנראה לנו הנביא מדמה, כענין תרשיש, כמראה הלפידים, כעין הקרח הנורא, כמראה הבזק, כעין נחשת קלל, כמראה הקשת. כלם בנראה לעולם, אף כעין החשמל דבר הוא בעולם, אבל אין אנו בקיאין בלשון המקרא ברוב דברים ואין לנו אלא הענין. וענינו יורה עליו כי זוהר צח וברור במאד מאד הוא כזוהר ברירות החמה שנראית נעה ונדה כגלי מים.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ke'ein hahashmal</strong></em>: the prophet [Ezekiel] uses comparisons to things visible in the world, such as \"the [stones of] Tarshish\", \"like the appearance of torches\", \"like the colour of the dreadful ice\", \"like the appearance of a lightning bolt\", \"like the colour of burnished copper\", \"like the appearance of a rainbow\". All these things are visible in the world, and so \"like the colour of <em>hashmal</em>\" [must be] something in the world; however, we are not proficient in the language of Scripture in many things and we have nothing but the context [to go by]. The context here indicates that [<em>hashmal</em>] is a very, very clear and bright radiance, like the radiance of the brightness of the sun, which appears to ebb and flow, like waves of water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love this, both for his prescience in understanding <em>hashmal</em> as a shining bright colour, and for his honesty in acknowledging that when it comes to Biblical language, we often simply do not know what precisely it is referring to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The commentary <em>M'tzudas Tziyon</em> says it means a clear, smokeless fire.</p>\n\n<p>The commentary <em>Mahari [=R.

    "content": "# How can angels \"give permission\" to each other?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As I understood it, angels have no free will and strictly do those things G-d instructs them to do.  But in the brachas preceding krias Shema, we say that the angels \"all accept upon themselves the yoke of heavenly sovereignty from one another, and grant permission to one another to sanctify the One Who formed them . . . .\"  If an angel has no free will, what power does it have to grant permission to another angel to do anything?  Isn't it G-d that gives them whatever authority they have?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Tosfos to <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=13&daf=13b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chagiga 13b</a> explains as follows (translation my own):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מזיעתן של חיות. ויוצאים ממנו מלאכים ואומרים שירה ומיד נטרדים והכי\n  מצינו במדרש (איכה ג) חדשים לבקרים שבורא מלאכים בכל יום ואומרים שירה\n  ונטרדין להן כדאמר בסמוך משום שיש אות במלאכים הקבועים שממתינים זה לזה\n  לומר שירה ואלו החדשים שאינם יודעים הדת ממהרין לשורר ונתחייבו כליה\n  והיינו אשר תקנו ויסדו אנשי כנסת הגדולה ביוצר ונותנין רשות זה לזה קדושה\n  כולם כאחד עונין ואומרים </p>\n  \n  <p>Angels come out of [the sweat of the Chayos] that sing praise to Hashem and immediately cease to exist. We thus find in the Midrash \"They are new every morning\" - Hashem creates new angles each day, and they sing praise to Him and then cease to exist. This is because there is a sign by the permanent angels who wait for each other to sing praise, and these new ones are unaware of this protocol and sing before their turn and are liable to be destroyed. This is the meaning of the prayer established by the Anshei Knesses Hagedola \"And with love grant permission to each other etc.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tosfos quotes a Midrash which explains that there are two different types of angels. Some angels are permanent, while others exist for a split second and then cease to exist. Their essence then drops into the river Dinar, which flows into Gehinom and stokes the fires over the heads of the evil \"residents\" there. The permanent angels wait to offer praise to HaShem until they are given permission to do so; whereas the temporal ones achieve reality and immediately give praise to HaShem without waiting for permission, and this causes their early demise into the river Dinar.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>After searching around, I found something that somewhat contradicts what I said in my earlier comment where I suggested that r'shut simply means \"making space,\" that is, non-interference. It seems that there is an understanding that r'shut actually does mean giving permission, but the permission seems to have been ordained from a source higher than regular angels -- either a very top tier angel or actually from Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>I found a discussion of this on the website Beurei Ha-Tefila compiled by Abe Katz:  <a href=\"http://beureihatefila.com/files/Reconciling_the_Multiple_Themes_of_Yotzer_Ohr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://beureihatefila.com/files/Reconciling_the_Multiple_Themes_of_Yotzer_Ohr.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>There, he mentions a source in Mesechet Chullin 92b. The relevent text begins with these words: \"And the angel said: (Breishit 35) Let me go, for the day breaks. Jacob said to him, ‘Are you a thief or a rogue that you are afraid of the morning?’ He replied: ‘I am an angel, and from the day that I was created my time to sing praises to the Lord had not come until now’. This supports the statement of R. Hananel in the name of Rab. For R. Hananel said in the name of Rab: Three divisions of ministering angels sing praises to the Lord daily; one proclaims: Holy, the other proclaims: Holy, and the third\nproclaims: Holy is the Lord of hosts.\"</p>\n\n<p>The discussion in Chullin goes on for some time and talks about how angels cannot perform their praises until they have permission to do so. The angels are organised into legions and types, and each type of angel must wait its turn before it can begin to sing. (There is also an issue of all angels having to wait until B'nei Yisrael sing their praises, but that's another matter.)  </p>\n\n<p>On the same Beurei Ha-Tefilah link mentioned above, the compiler provides two extended quotes from collections of Merkavah literature (P'sikta Rabati and Otzer Ha-Midrashim, the Einshtein edition). These quotes give detailed accounts of the divisions of angels singing praises in turn. There, it uses the language of r'shut, permission. As one division of angels finishes their praises, they \"give r'shut\" to the next division of angels to begin. </p>\n\n<p>As to the question of free will among angels which the original question raised, I still think their \"permission giving\" is more of a formalized \"making space\" for the next division to begin at a preordained time rather than a free will decision to now allow others to have a chance to sing. If you read the Merkavah quotes, it sounds much more like a ritualized military change of guards than an open mic night where performers can decide and control when they will step aside for another performer. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The commentaries on Kedusha of shemoneh esrei (Avudarham among others) say that the angels are requesting permission from each other in order to start together.  It therefore seems that they do not need the permission because they can't praise Hashem were it not for another angel allowing them to, rather the permission is a way of expressing that they make sure everyone is ready to begin at the same time.</p>\n\n\n",

One question is in parsha vayeshev, where we read how Joseph was sold by his brothers to the \"Ishmaelites\".  I have always taken that to be the descendants of Ishmael.  Isaac and Ishmael were half brothers.  Which means that Isaac’s sons, Jacob and Esau were first cousins to Ishmael’s sons, which in turn means that Jacobs twelve sons were second cousins to Ishmael’s grandchildren.  Didn’t the Ishmaelites know they were buying their second cousin?  I would certainly know if my second cousins tried to sell me another second cousin as a slave!

(That's 14 until Yitzchak is born, 60 more until Yaakov is born, and Yaakov is 130 when he stands before Par'oh after 22 years of Yosef being away = 182 years.) Just because Yitzchak and Yaakov waited a long time to have kids doesn't mean Yishmael or his decendants did. If Yishmael and all his descendants each had 5 kids by the age of 30, that means Yishmael had at least 5^6 = 15625 great-great-great-great-grandchildren running around at the time Yosef was sold.

Gen. 49:1.  He never gets to that, however, because, according to Rashi, the Divine Spirit left him at that moment.  The Midrash, Breshis Rabbah 98:2 tells us that when he lost that prophecy, Yaakov assumed that he was prevented from disclosing what would occur because of a spiritual deficiency in one or more of his sons.</p>\n\n<p>While the Midrash explains Yaakov's thinking at the time, it does not explain if that was the actual reason that the prophecy was obscured from Yaakov.</p>\n\n<p>I heard another reason, but I'm not sure who brought it down or even if I heard it correctly.  What I heard was that Yaakov was going to explain about how the Moshiach will come after the War on Gog v'Magog.  However, Yaakov was not going to explain the other option -- that the Messianic Era could come about without the war if Klal Yisroel achieved holiness before the end of days.  Because Yaakov made the assumption that his descendants were incapable of that level of holiness, Hashem withdrew the Shekinah to prevent Yaakov from committing loshon hara against the entire Jewish people yet to be born.</p>\n\n<p>It sounds persuasive, but I have no idea of the source.

Being that the time of Moshiach's coming is at the height of Hester Panim in this Galus, it was impossible for him to finish the nevu'ah; at the very moment his spiritual essence connected to the right time, it also connected to Hester Panim of that time, and hence Ruach HaKodesh became impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Kind of a catch 22!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains as follows (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16077&st=&pgnum=243&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Likkutey Sichos vol. 20 pg. 228</a>):</p>\n\n<p>When Yaakov's sons would hear that Moshiach was not scheduled to come for a long time, they would have realised that some considerable additional effort was needed to bring him sooner - as the Talmud states that through additional merit the Redemption comes earlier (Sanhedrin 98a). Thus, Yaakov hoped that by revealing that the end of days was a long way off, it would motivate his children to add substantially in Divine Service, so as to bring Moshiach sooner.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, despite his good intentions the Shechina departed from him, and Yaakov found himself unable to reveal the End of Days.

Please note that kosher drinks do not include kosher wine seeing as wine opened by a goy is not kosher, and most poskim give that same judgment to wine served by a non religious person, therefor one must not drink wine served at weddings even in Israel, unless they have opened the bottle themselves and pored it as well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eretzhemdah.org/Data/UploadedFiles/FtpUserFiles/Books/shotBemarehH/6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"link to volume\">link to volume</a></p>\n\n<h2> סא. השתתפות בטקסי שאלה: בני דתות  ע  ג  תרבותיי  טבעי קשרי תרבותית באופייה, ולבני הקהילה היהודית באופ  החברה באוסטרליה היא רב ?  והינדוניסטיי  בודהיסטיי  ומקדשי  : כנסיות, מסגדי  מותר להיכנס לבתי תפילה שלה  ובאיזה תנאי  אחרות. הא אוכל כשר?  שלה  מותר לאכול באירועי  , והא  פסיבית בטקסיה  מותר להשתת  הא תשובה:  : שאלת הכניסה לבתי תפילה של דתות אחרות, ושאלת הנוכחות וההשתתפות בטקסי  נחלקת לב' חלקי  התשובה לשאלת .  שלה . של פיקוח נפש 3  איבה 2, למעט במקרי  לא משו  מטרה 1, וא  להיכנס לבית עבודה זרה לשו א. 1. אי .6 5 והינדוניסטיי  בודהיסטיי  מקדשי כנסיות נוצריות 4, וכ  2. בגדר בית עבודה זרה נכללי בזה בעיה של דרכי , כשאי  מכ  שראוי להימנע ג  בית עבודה זרה 7, ויש אומרי  בו משו 3. מותר להיכנס למסגד, ואי .8 שלו  א  הטבלה לנצרות וכדו', א של עבודה זרה, כגו  אלמנטי  של דתות אחרות הכוללי  או לצפות בטקסי  להשתת ב. 1. אי . בפועל בטקס 9  משתתפי אי . של עבודה זרה 10  בו אלמנטי דת אחרת, כאשר אי מניעה להיות נוכח באירוע שמחה או אבל של ב 2. אי  במקו  אוכל כשר. וג  מביא את האוכל מהבית או שיש ש  א  לאכול בסעודת חתונה של גוי, וא 3. בכל מקרה, אי . איבה 12  חשש כשרות מותר במקו  בה שאי  לשתות משקי  איבה אסור הדבר 11 , א תקופת הגלות גזרו גזרות  תקופת הכנסת הגדולה ולאור  בשולי התשובה כי גדולי ישראל, החל מאבות האומה דר  נוסי , כתריס כנגד ההתבוללות. מנהיגי הקהילות בימינו  ישראל לאומות העול להבדיל חברתית בי ותיקנו תקנות שמטרת . שיקול חשוב זה בכל החלטה שכזו 13  ג לקחת בחשבו  צריכי מבאר בפירוש  נפסק להלכה בשו\"ע (יו\"ד סי' קמט סע' א). המשנה עוסקת בעיר שיש בה עבודה זרה, והרמב\"  1 משנה (עבודה זרה יא ע\"ב), וכ  סי' קנ סע' א) שמצווה להתרחק מדר  נפסק בשו\"ע (ש  להיכנס לבית עבודה זרה ודאי שאסור, וכ  לגור בעיר כזאת, א  המשניות שאנו אנוסי בתשובה הבאה.  עיי  ס; ג תשובות קיב, קיד; ה תשובה עה). וכ  . וראה עוד בשו\"ת \"במראה הבזק\" (א תשובות נט  אלילי עוד בשו\"ת \"במראה הבזק\" (ג תשובה קיד).  2 שו\"ת \"יביע אומר\" (ב יו\"ד סי' יא) ושו\"ת \"יחוה דעת\" (ד סי' מה). ועיי 3 סי' קנ סע' ג).  הרמ\"א (שו\"ע ש 4 בשו\"ת  ); ועיי  ז יו\"ד סי' יב) וה\"יחוה דעת\" (ש  וכ  אליעזר\" (יד סי' צא), ה\"יביע אומר\" (ש  ה\"אגרות משה\" (יו\"ד ג סי' קכט סע' ו), ה\"צי .  אסור להיכנס לבתי תפילת  , עדיי  עובדי עבודה זרה גמורי  די  לנוצרי  אי  א  \"במראה הבזק\" (א תשובה נט), שג – מפי  את פסל מייסד דת  עובדי  בלבד, בפועל ההמוני  עבודה זרה אלא אורח חיי  בה פולח  שאי  פי שיש ממאמיני דת זו הטועני  על  5 א כרב בהונג קונג ומשמש עכשיו ברבנות בניו יורק.  הרב יעקב קרמאייר, שכיה גמורה – מפי הרב קרמאייר הנ\"ל.  6 דת זו הנה עבודת אלילי  (מאכלות אסורות פרק יא הל' ז) שהישמעאלי  בדברי הרמב\"  יצחק\" (או\"ח סי' יא) ושו\"ת \"יביע אומר\" (ז יו\"ד סי' יב), ויסוד  7 שו\"ת \"עי אליעזר\" (יד סי'  סע' ה). וה\"צי  סי' קמו) והרמ\"א (ש  \" (ש  המחבר ב\"בית יוס  פסקו הטור (יו\"ד סי' קכד), מר  עובדי עבודה זרה; וכ  אינ כבר השיג עליו ב\"יביע  עובדי עבודה זרה. א  יש די  למוסלמי  סא ע\"ב) שג  (סנהדרי  להיכנס למסגד, ויסודו בדברי הר\"  צא) פסק שאי  נכנסי  כ פי  על  מסגד, וא  מערת המכפלה הקימו הערבי  שהמציאות היא שבתו  , והוסי  ולא כר\"  ), שנפסק להלכה כרמב\"  אומר\" (ש פסק להיתר הגרח\"ד הלוי בשו\"ת \"עשה  זה עיקר ראייתו. וכ  אי  שיש לחלק, א  מראיה זו, שייתכ  עיו  להתפלל. וצרי  וצדיקי  גאוני  לש רב\" (א סי' נט).  ל  שאינה עבודה זרה, כיוו  בית תפילה של דת הכופרת בתורה, א  להיכנס לשו  \" עח, א, 11 ) שאי  ההר (מובאת בספר \"צידה לדר  8 דעת הרב מ ראיה ממערת המכפלה,  לתת כבוד לדת הכופרת בתורה. ולפי דבריו אי  לה כבוד, ואי  שיסוד האיסור להיכנס לבית עבודה זרה הוא מצד שנות .  המקודש ליהודי  כבוד למסגד, אלא כניסה למקו  בכניסה מת  אי  שש 9 בשו\"ת \"במראה הבזק\" (א תשובה ס).  ועיי  , וא  מתיה  לנח  \". והובא בשו\"ע (יו\"ד סי' קנא סע' יב) שמותר א  עניי ישראל מפני דרכי שלו  ע  עניי גויי  (סא ע\"א): \"קוברי  10 גיטי בשו\"ת  , משמע שלהיות נוכח מותר. לגבי תפילה משותפת עיי  שאסרו רק לאכול בסעודת חתונת  עניי ישראל, ולגבי שמחה ראה לקמ  כשאי .  שונה מגויי  דינ  לפי דבריו ש  , א  (סי' נז) לגבי קראי  בשו\"ת הרא\"  \"במראה הבזק\" (ג תשובה קיב). ועיי )  (ש  ) והש\"  שה\"פרישה\" (ש  איבה אסור, וא  ) שאפילו במקו  11 עבודה זרה (ח ע\"א), ונפסק בשו\"ע (יו\"ד סי' קנב סע' א). ודעת הט\"ז (ש שהתיר  איבה ה\"אגרות משה\" (יו\"ד ב סי' קיז) – מכ  במקו  הכריעו לאסור א  לא הכריעו להיתר. וכ  ה  איבה, ג  במקו  נסתפקו מה הדי רק שתייה, שהיא עראי, וה\"משנה הלכות\" (ז סי' קיח). 12 איבה.  ), שהשתייה נחשבת לעראי ולא נאסרה במקו  ה\"אגרות משה\" (ש 13 חכמה\" (ויקרא כו, מד).  במסתו החשובה של בעל ה\"מש  עיי</h2>\n\n\n",

    "title": "May we intervene with Religious OCD sufferers?",
    "content": "# May we intervene with Religious OCD sufferers?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On what level may we (or may we not) intervene with OCD sufferers when they are not related to you in any way?</p>\n\n<p>I am referring to a sizable demographic of religious OCD sufferers, who don't necessarily know what OCD is, and surely have not been diagnosed or treated for their anxiety disorder.</p>\n\n<p>Within the religious context and practice it's very easy to spot OCD sufferers.\nAt Synagogue they may spend more time than any other congregant pronouncing the words of prayer carefully or repeating the words many times. I'm in no way referring to the congregants that spend time truly meditating on the words with proper intent, or repeating words that have been pronounced correctly. I am referring to practices that catch the average person's attention. Repeating words 10 or 20 times, starting over from the beginning of a particular prayer repeatedly, or creating buzzing or clicking sounds in the misguided attempt to \"pronounce the words properly\". To the unfamiliar eye, this may appear to be religious fervor and zest. Unfortunately it's far from this, the sufferer is struggling with compulsions, intrusive thoughts, fear, and worry.</p>\n\n<p>These behaviors can be treated. The question is how to approach the suffering individual.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not religion breeds or fosters OCD behavior is a separate argument, but a large number of religious sufferers simply believe they are acting in accordance with their religion. By repeating \"Poseach Es Yadecha\" in the \"Ashrei\" prayer 10 or 20 times for example, or repeatedly washing their hands, to get it \"right\" for \"Netilat Yadayim\" the sufferer believes he or she is merely following \"Halacha\" more strictly than anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>On what level may we intervene to try and help the sufferer?\nCan we make them aware that their suffering is unnecessary and can be corrected?\nSurely outright confrontation wouldn't be advisable, What would be some other methods of intervention (or confrontation) that conform with \"Halacha\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It seems that many OCD sufferers' (regardless of what they obsess over)  don't realize that they OCD'ing. They will usually give many 'excuses' and 'hidden reasons' for why it's not OCD.</p>\n\n<p>When someone that we care about has a problem we try to help them, but the problem gets compounded when the person doesn't even realize that anything is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>In this case (OCD) it would probably be most advisable to bring it up with a relative or friend who has considerable influence on him (obviously with the sensitivity it deserves).</p>\n\n<p>Many times relatives and friends don't know where to get the professional help / advice, so it might be a good idea to do some research of professionals in your area (that are Frum, and have experience in this specific area - if possible), and to pass it on to the friend / relative (if it seems appropriate at the time)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><em><strong>Introductory Note of Clarification:\nParts of the answer (below) that are critical, are not directed at the questioner, but rather to some people who jump to conclusions about whether another person has (or likely has) OCD - often based on faulty premises or a lack of context concerning the other individuals behaviors or perceived behaviors:</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>It is good that you note in your question examples that really stand out. There are halachos that require the individual to pronounce words a certain way and make the proper pauses so as not to change the meaning of what they are saying (see Hilchos K'riyas Shema, for example - Siman 61). An individual who had, in the past, been less familiar with the halachos concerning pronunciation, kavanah..., may be working on themselves to become accustomed to davening in accordance with halacha. For some people, this may take time and added energy. However, you would expect that the individual would get it right after a certain period of time. Another factor to consider is that in some minyanim, it is harder to have proper kavanah and pronounce the davening correctly due to other individuals in the minyan who daven loudly, in a way that really detracts from the kavanah of some congregants. If the person who \"repeats\" parts of the davening a-lot does not have such problems when davening alone in a quiet place, it may be better for that individual to daven in private. This is in accordance with the Sha'arei Teshuvah (Orach Chaim: 52: 1) who notes that if a person has difficulty with kavanah when davening with a minyan, they may daven alone.</p>\n\n<p>Another matter to consider is that some people easily come to the conclusion that someone has OCD simply because they don't daven in the 25 minutes (or 45 minutes) that the minyan takes to complete Shacharis. If, as you note correctly, the person takes longer for reasons of kavanah or halacha, that certainly would not be a problem and assuming such a person has a problem of OCD would be incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>There are some individuals who claim that a person who davens Shacharis for a substantially longer period than 25 minutes has OCD. This claim, for example, does not address tefillos that are recommended but that many people do not do (Ketores, Karbanos, Parshas HaMan...) as well as the halachos governing pronunciation and the fact that a person should daven slowly (rather than quickly) - b'nachas. In other words, the individual is not regularly repeating pesukim many times (as you noted), but is rather davening at a slower pace.</p>\n\n<p>The main point is that some people recognize OCD for what it is, while others seem to jump at the \"conclusion\" that an individual is OCD if he does things that are viewed as OCD-like. Before speaking to people about a person \"having OCD\", it is important that this outside individual not have inappropriate criteria for what is and is not OCD. A person who is careful/scrupulous to follow halacha is certainly not OCD - that's absolutely absurd (even if he/she is following halacha where most other people are unaware of the halacha in the given case). First, make sure you are not incorrectly assuming an individual has OCD - as telling others about someone having OCD, when they do not could be Motzi Shem Ra (though unintended). If you want to help the person, the first step should be to not compulsively assume a person has OCD - in other words, make sure that you have truly objective criteria to determine whether OCD is involved AND that you understand the other person's situation properly - not coming to an incorrect conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>If a person truly has OCD, try to help them in a way that avoids problems associated with Lashon Hara and Motzi Shem Ra - make sure you know the halachos as they apply directly to the specific situation you are trying to address.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It's important to distinguish between someone who is suffering from OCD and someone who is being religiously meticulous. Someone repeating words in prayer over and over again is not fulfilling the requirement to pray, and such a person is very likely violating the prohibition of saying G-d's name in vain.  Someone who is washing over and over again is in danger of hurting his or her hands and could possibly put him or herself at risk of infection due to dried out and broken skin.  While it is always a good idea to take into account a person's overall mental health and religious sensitivities, as well as general personality and how one might react to suggestions of seeking mental health services, there is no special need to be sensitive to a person's scrupulous observance of religious rules when the actions in question are not in accordance with the rules or are not improving upon the observance of the rules.  If someone needs help, then the person needs help.  Period.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Treating obsessive compulsive scrupulosity without ignoring genuine conscience",
    "content": "# Treating obsessive compulsive scrupulosity without ignoring genuine conscience\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read a psychological paper that was linked to in a comment <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/23234/may-we-intervene-with-religious-ocd-sufferers#comment54360_23234\">here</a>, dealing with how obsessive-compulsive scrupulosity can be treated specifically for Orthodox Jews.</p>\n\n<p>The paper gives a helpful and illuminating perspective about how this treatment would be affected, and yet possible, within the framework of an observant Jew's life and values. It comments that OCD is not caused or increased by religion, but instead that people who already suffer from it tend to have it manifest in the areas of their lives that matter most to them. Certain aspects specific to Judaism, like the care taken with mitzvot and the ability to seek rabbinic reassurance, should be healthy, fulfilling, and joyful overall; yet they can be taken as part of the obsession or compulsion. So the paper goes through numerous issues that psychologists might need to understand regarding normal behaviour in the Jewish community. Another focus is the fact that in many other situations, OCD sufferers can be treated by being exposed to their phobia in controlled settings or in mental imagination, but for Orthodox Jews it isn't appropriate to deliberately transgress a commandment in order to regain balance. Certain ways around this, and ways of framing the treatment in a meaningful way, are considered through the article.</p>\n\n<p>Even though it contains some great content and observations about deeply important issues, I'd like to ask people's thoughts about this paper's discussion regarding deliberate exposure to unwanted thoughts. There are a few other problems in what was written, but this was the one that stood out to me. Even though the authors considered this issue and how such treatment may be inappropriate, I think that their suggestions still push the boundaries. I don't think it's ever okay to deliberately imagine or mentally verbalise doing sins, or to deliberately allow tempting thoughts into your consciousness. These would often intrude out of fear, rather than desire, for someone struggling with obsession, and the sense of guilt and avoidance makes that worse. Still, inviting them or considering them is inherently a real thing to avoid in honouring God, caring about others and the integrity of our relationships with them, and learning to live amidst what is truly valuable.</p>\n\n<p>So <strong>this is my question, in practical terms</strong>. If a person dealing with internal stimuli of obsession is unwilling to accept or linger on certain thoughts (even purely for treatment), whether it be a mental imagination of going against ritual commandments (as would be the fear for some OCD sufferers) or an allowing of idolatrous, violent, rebellious, or (inappropriate) sexual thoughts to be pondered so as to neutralise obsessive fear of them... then imaginal exposure treatment will not be possible or desirable. It transgresses a person's core values. Some thoughts are destructive, even when they aren't actions. I'm wondering how else these obsessive fears, linked with intrusive thoughts, could get to the healthy stage of being ignored or absent rather than suppressed.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe just gaining the ability to distinguish between obsessive avoidance and moral avoidance would be a helpful starting point. Asking Hashem for help and learning to rest in that help, and that relationship, are also important. A greater awareness of one's thought process and an acceptance that some fears or guilt are misplaced, unhelpful in life, even destructive to faith, might also inherently help. None of these things involve 'exposure' to the feared transgression, but they would help to disentangle obsessiveness from conscience.</p>\n\n<p>I know that most of the people here are more familiar with matters of Judaism than they are in psychology. But from Jewish understanding and personal experience, does anyone have wisdom regarding this issue? Careful obedience and joyful wellbeing should be part of the one experience of life in relationship with God; they don't have to oppose each other in real life, nor should they.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Not sure if this answers your question, but here are a few anecdotes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A central thesis of the Tanya is that a \"super-righteous person\" will never even have thoughts occurring to them to do bad things. A \"normal\" person will occasionally have such thoughts, and then not act on them. It's acknowledged that not everyone's role is to be a \"super-righteous person.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>A young Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin once sought out his mentor, Rabbi Elijah the Gaon of Vilna, and complained that he occasionally had improper thoughts, what was wrong with him?! The Gaon replied -- \"you're trying to push for too much spiritual progress too far, too fast, and you're not getting G-d's help with it.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>The Talmud says that sexuality (yes I know it's a dirty word) is one of those things that you have to push away with one hand but pull back in with the other. Rashi explains that while it can't go unchecked, it's still a part of our humanity.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>BSD</p>\n\n<p>Firstly I wrote a piece for those with peers who may or may not have OCD <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/40677/4502\">here</a>, which could prove helpful.</p>\n\n<p>This is from my own experience so I am not paskening for anyone what to do. But I feel the only reason I went through these experiences are to help those who are in the same boat. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, the treatment you speak of is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Its the most effective tool in treating OCD. In a nutshell, it means exposing those with OCD to their triggers in a mild step by step process. This brings up one's tolerance and assuages the fear. </p>\n\n<p>Also obsessions arent the issue in OCD. Actually the compulsions are the issue because they invoke the obsessions. You cant stop obsessions but you can stop compulsions. Through that the obsessions come up less. This is because you are fearful of these obsessions so really you're body is always thinking about them. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, </p>\n\n<p>From my experience</p>\n\n<p>When I was being treated I worked with a Rav and therapist in tandem. The only thing I would have done differently would be to have a the Rav actually speak with the therapist, but as most therapists refuse to do this, it can be hard. </p>\n\n<p>But when I spoke to my Rav we set down guidelines. I would concentrate firstly and mainly on positive commandments. Now the main thing is to consult a Rav, as there are certain positive things one cannot ignore, but we mainly dealt with prayer. I would often times repeat prayers to a tiring degree, a trigger for my OCD. So one exposure exercise would be to only say Shema and Amida everyday. Or do things that arent forbidden but seem forbidden. Like I would go to the market and hold pork or even in certain instances put the package to my mouth. Now this seems weird but as long as their isnt any pork juice on the cover there isnt any prohibition. As for maris ayin, I never asked a Rav about that issue so maybe you should ask. But really you have to get creative in exploring other avenues. We never really got to the exercises where I would be transgressing a negative commandment because we came up with so many inventive exercises.</p>\n\n<p>As for initiating the improper thoughts and avodah zara thoughts, seek a Rav's psak. I once asked my Rav about improper thoughts and he told me that it doesnt invalidate the Shema and to just proceed. I guess its a matter of just waiting for those instances to come up in order to be exposed to them and not be fearful or repeat. But as for initiating those thoughts seek a Rav's advice. </p>\n\n\n",

The role of the rabbi straddles many different biblical \"positions\" including judge, advisor, and interpreter of law.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure what you mean by \"find truth.\" If you mean a finding of fact in certain legal cases, we can go to a rabbinic court. In other cases, we go to a civil/criminal court. In some, we read the texts and speak with each other about understandings of the text. Or we seek guidance from those who have studied texts and who can help us understand. We might ask for the truth of the application of law and for that we would go to someone who is of the knowledge and experience and authority to establish a supported and persuasive opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The requirements for a rabbi depend on what you mean by \"rabbi.\" In the olden days, the most basic form of \"rabbi\" was someone who served as a community leader and teacher. But there are other levels of ordination, with each one requiring specific study and testing on particular areas of law. But simple ordination does not confer on anyone the magical ability to state infallibly \"the truth.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>An addendum as the question has slightly shifted -- re: why are there no prophets today. From the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/84902/jewish/What-is-Prophecy.htm\">chabad</a> website:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nevertheless, the principle that \"G-d communicates to mankind through prophecy\" remains a foundation of the Jewish faith. A lesser form of prophecy, known as ruach hakodesh (divine inspiration), remains the province of the tzaddikim, the righteous men and women of all generations. According to tradition, one of the greatest prophets, Elijah, never died, and will herald the coming of the Moshiach. Moshiach himself is a prophet (\"approaching the prophecy of Moses\" according to Maimonides), and in the messianic era, prophecy will become a universal phenomenon -- in the words of the prophet Joel, \"And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and daughters shall prophecy; your elders shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.\" And in a letter to the Jews of Yemen, Maimonides recounts an age-old tradition that \"shortly before the messianic era, prophecy will return to the Jewish people.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-11.html\">this</a> site which is, I believe, too long to copy and paste. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Naftaali Elfenbein of Mercaz Hatorah in Talpiot Jerusalem said that the Shemona Esrei, composed by the Men of the Great Assembly with the aid the last of our prophets, Haggai, Zeharia, and Malachi, is our prophecy in this age. I believe his source was <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=megilah&daf=17b&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">Megilla 17b</a>, as he mentioned the phrase 'and among them a number of prophets'.</p>\n\n<p>So the replacement for prophets is ourselves, hopefully every time we pray.</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, an individual who is usually unqualified to be a judge can be accepted as one for a special reason if both sides of a dispute agree.  In a rare case, even a family member of one of the sides, or a shepherd, who most consider unfit can serve as a judge in monetary (but not halachic) matters (Sanhedrin 24 and Chiddushei Ha-Ran on Shavuot 30a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Many shoftim (in sefer shoftim) were chosen by Hashem, or an angel, or by becoming a prophet.

(Everyone agrees that the direction of rolling is from left to right (Menachot 31b) and thus the word Shema is not in the middle of the tube.)</p>\n\n<p>For Rabbeinu Tam (see Tosfot Menachot 33a sv Hah), who understands that the Mezuzah should be placed horizontally, the Yerushalmi is interpreted to mean that not just the word 'Shema' but the top of the writing (ie the whole first line) should be towards the inside of the house, because the Gemara earlier (Menachot 32b) ruled that the in a deep doorway, the Mezuzah should be placed in the Tefach closest to the outside. (For the vertical opinion, it is obvious that the top of the writing should be at the top, and not to have the writing upside down.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus when following one of the two \"compromise\" opinions (such as having the mezuzah on a slant or Maharam of Rothenburg's original compromise: placing it bent in an L shape), the Terumat haDeshen (#52) concludes that the Shema should be tilted inward (or in the case of an L the bottom leg should be bent outward) to satisfy Rabbeinu Tam's understanding of the Yerushalmi. (It's worth noting that the Terumat haDeshen claims he wrote this Teshuva to oppose the practice of many Talmidei Chachamim who had the tops of their Mezuzot angled outwards.)</p>\n\n<p>The Terumat haDeshen also suggests another reason for having the top inwards. He compares the case to that of Tefillin, which the Talmud (Menachot 34b) requires to be placed in order as if one was reading them. (Speaking of cryptic gemaras, feel free to see a famous Machloket between Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam over there :D). The Terumat haDeshen suggests that the reason the Shema in a Mezuzah is placed on the inside is so that someone entering the door (and our reference point for Mezuzah is always someone entering (eg. placing on the right side)) would be able to read the Mezuzah (if it was unrolled). If the top of the writing were tilted towards the outside, someone entering would have to contort themselves to read it (yes, the Terumat haDeshen actually says that). Thus the Mezuzah may only be placed between vertical and top-inwards horizontal, independent of if you hold vertical or horizontal is the ideal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The reason a Mezuza is placed on an angle is due to a Machlokes - <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9732&st=&pgnum=480\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Taz - Yorah Deah 289:6</a> between Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam. Rashi holds it should be placed vertically and Rabbeinu Tam holds it should be placed horizontally. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37365&st=&pgnum=90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Per Sefer Yashar V'Tov quoting the Rosh in Menachos 33</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל ברא\"ש פירוש דלר\"ת אתי לאשמועינן שתהא שיטה אחרונה לצד רשות הרבים\nוראשונה לצד פנים כדי שתהא שיטת שמע לצד אויר הפתח לפנים</p>\n<p>But the Rosh explains that according to the Rabbeinu Tam, it's coming to tell us that the last line should be toward the street and the first toward the inside, so that the line of \"Shema\" will be toward the space that opens inward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>(Mi Yodeya user's translation)</em></p>\n<p>The Rosh says that per Rabbeinu Tam it is placed horizontally with the words facing the inside of the door.

    "content": "# Working in a non kosher yogurt store\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was asked a question this afternoon and I don't know a good answer (yet) so I'm posting it.</p>\n\n<p>I have been asked in the past whether a Jewish person may work in a non-Kosher restaurant that serves meat. The answer I have heard and read is that one may not and one reason is because you may not serve a Jewish customer a treif meal. (this is a gloss but I can't find the source sheets for the shiur about it).</p>\n\n<p>But what about a yogurt place which has no hashgocha and the patrons effectively serve themselves. Sure, the store has gummy this and marshmallow that and I know that they are of a treif brand, but I am not serving anything. Is this more like being a cashier in Shoprite where I don't control what people put in their baskets, I just collect money? Or is this still a restaurant and I can't facilitate someone's choice to eat non Kosher food?</p>\n\n<p>I know this overlaps with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1157/giving-away-coupon-to-non-kosher-restraurant\">this</a> question but it isn't exact because the person is eating right then and there. And if I find my source sheet, I will try to give the basis for my assumption that one should not work in a treif restaurant.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, I intend to ask the LOR when I see him but I'd like to amass as much info as I can beforehand.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit -- the LOR didn't come in today with any sources but I looked in The laws of Kashrus (Forst) and on page 182, under the heading of \"beneficial use\" it reads (unless someone can find the text online, my copy job will have to do - I moved footnotes to parentheticals and omitted unnecessary commentary)</p>\n\n<p>\"One may not engage in any commerce involving basar b'chalav. One who owns a restaurant with a non-Jewish clientele, may not serve basar b'chalav. Incidentally, one may not engage in commerce involving any foodstuffs Biblically forbidden to eat (...see Y.D. 117...) lest one inadvertently come to eat some of the prohibited food himself. (Shach §2 and Taz §1 citing Rashba) In addition, it may be problematic selling any forbidden food to the public since non-observant Jews may also purchase food. (See <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4698&st=&pgnum=87\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Darcei Tshuva 117:65</a>)\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Working in a restaurant which serves gummy bears which are treif seems to fall under the second clause (the \"incidentally\") even if the place is self serve, as the food is out and available and workers often eat the food in their own restaurants. Yes, I see that the broad application of the third clause (\"In addition\") is VERY broad but I'm simply pointing out that there is a background logic to this question. And I happen to be unable to read the tiny D\"T letters so if someone can transcribe it without going blind, feel free.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>See Aruch HaShulchan YD 117:27 where he makes clear that people can rely on the kula to operate a store in which they sell some non-kosher products, since the majority of their business is with kosher things, and the only reason they are selling the non-kosher things also is because they would lose business if they didn't have these things available also. And that is talking about the owner of the store who profits directly from the sale. All the more so for an employee, who is not profiting directly from the sale (in most cases, unless he is on commission, which is unheard of in a food store), but rather is simply being paid for his time, in which case the whole din against sechora should not apply to the employee at all.</p>\n\n<p>And, regarding basar b'chalev problems, in the Aruch HaShulchan 87:10, he allows even frying basar b'chalev in case of great financial need, since the prohibition of frying and roasting is only d'rabanan anyway. And he writes that this question is relevant to inns, where Jews would work and cook on behalf of their non-Jewish guests. So we see here even a leniency for short order chefs frying on a griddle or grilling on a BBQ to cook basar b'chalav, if their livelihood depended on it.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the question does not get off the ground. For centuries Jews have worked as employees for non-Jewish businesses dealing in all manner of non-kosher products, and there is no suggestion whatsoever that an employee would be violating the prohibition on sechora. And as we see from the Aruch HaShulchan, most poskim have been exceedingly lenient even for the businesses owners themselves, since they understood that livelihood was at stake.</p>\n\n<p>(However, to temper my original comments slightly: I did see that the Pischei Tshuva on YD 117:6 is strict about being a \"shaliach\" of a non-Jew to profit from forbidden things, but I assume that case is talking more about a commission relationship, as opposed to a standard hourly employee. Yabia Omer YD 4:6 discusses the entire question in great detail, about a Jew offered a job as a cook in a non-kosher restaurant, and comes out leniently in the end)</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, those like the אבודרהם have put much effort into figuring out which pesukei Tanach were the source-influence for phrases in our tefila.</p>\n<p>I imagine the explanation of the אבודרהם (<em>mentioned here in an earlier answer</em>) is based upon the wording in  ירמיהו ג:טו - וְרָע֥וּ אֶתְכֶ֖ם <strong>דֵּעָ֥ה וְהַשְׂכֵּֽיל</strong> having an <strong>exact, in-sequence match on two of the three words</strong> in the nusach of <strong>דעה בינה והשכל</strong>.</p>\n<p>For further insights, if we look to Tanach for a linkage between <strong>all three of these terms</strong>, we can find the following four examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>(ישעיהו מד:יח) לֹ֥א <strong>יָדְע֖וּ</strong> וְלֹ֣א <strong>יָבִ֑ינוּ</strong> כִּ֣י טַ֤ח מֵֽרְאוֹת֙ עֵינֵיהֶ֔ם <strong>מֵהַשְׂכִּ֖יל</strong> לִבֹּתָֽם</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>(דניאל א:ד) יְלָדִ֣ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֵֽין בָּהֶ֣ם כׇּל מאוּם֩ וְטוֹבֵ֨י מַרְאֶ֜ה <strong>וּמַשְׂכִּלִ֣ים</strong> בְּכׇל חׇכְמָ֗ה <strong>וְיֹ֤דְעֵי דַ֙עַת֙ וּמְבִינֵ֣י מַדָּ֔ע</strong> וַאֲשֶׁר֙ כֹּ֣חַ בָּהֶ֔ם לַעֲמֹ֖ד בְּהֵיכַ֣ל הַמֶּ֑לֶךְ וּֽלְלַמְּדָ֥ם סֵ֖פֶר וּלְשׁ֥וֹן כַּשְׂדִּֽים</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>(דניאל א:יז) וְהַיְלָדִ֤ים הָאֵ֙לֶּה֙ אַרְבַּעְתָּ֔ם <strong>נָתַ֨ן לָהֶ֧ם הָֽאֱלֹהִ֛ים</strong> <strong>מַדָּ֥ע וְהַשְׂכֵּ֖ל</strong> בְּכׇל סֵ֣פֶר וְחׇכְמָ֑ה וְדָנִיֵּ֣אל <strong>הֵבִ֔ין</strong> בְּכׇל חָז֖וֹן וַחֲלֹמֽוֹת</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>(דברי הימים ב ב:יא) וַיֹּ֘אמֶר֮ חוּרָם֒ <strong>בָּר֤וּךְ ה֙' אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל</strong> אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֔ה אֶת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֶת הָאָ֑רֶץ <strong>אֲשֶׁ֣ר נָתַן֩</strong> לְדָוִ֨יד הַמֶּ֜לֶךְ בֵּ֣ן חָכָ֗ם <strong>יוֹדֵ֙עַ֙ שֵׂ֣כֶל וּבִינָ֔ה</strong> אֲשֶׁ֤ר יִבְנֶה בַּ֙יִת֙ לַה֔' וּבַ֖יִת לְמַלְכוּתֽוֹ</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the final two examples, we have the added bonus of the notion of someone recognizing דעה בינה והשכל being <strong>granted by G-d</strong> which is something we highlight in our bracha of אתה חונן לאדם דעת.

See also Hilchos Korban Pesach 9:7, where the Rambam explains the expression ben neichar (literally, \"son of a stranger\") as meaning, \"one who serves a strange god.\"  </p>\n\n<p>Given the fact that Christian censors often changed or removed phrases and sentences they deemed offensive to Christians, I would not be surprised if Onkelos was more specific and applied the term to Jews who converted to Christianity in his day.  Is there any proof of this? Can we know from other sources if Christians were forbidden to register for the Korbon Pesach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I really doubt that picking a specific application of the halacha would have been Onkelos' job, not to mention he's estimated to have lived around the year 110, so Christianity per se was just barely getting off the ground.</p>\n\n<p>All Onkelos is doing is rendering the Talmudic interpretation of the verse, as close to the wording as possible. The phrase is \"ben nechar\", \"a foreign person.\" The Talmud's interpretation is that one who has become a foreigner from Judaism is included; thus Onkelos translates \"one who has adopted a different faith.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Although he was one of the most learned of the Tannaim, he made many tragically bad decisions in his life.  Rashi brings down a tradition, in his comment to Avodah Zara 18b, that Rabbi Meir arranged the seduction of his wife by one of his pupils in order to prove the validity of the Talmudic claim that women are \"light-minded.\" After many refusals, Beruriah finally yielded to the student's sexual advances. When she realized that her husband had set the trap for her, she hanged herself and Rabbi Meir ran away out of shame into self-imposed exile.  </p>\n\n<p>In another story, told at Horayos 13b to 14a, Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel (Rebbe's grandfather) was the Nasi and Rabbi Noson was the Av Bais Din. Rabbi Meir plotted to depose Rabbi Shimon by suggesting that Rabbi Noson call on him to teach Uktzein, which he knew Rabbi Shimon had never learned.  If Rabbi Shimon was effectively sandbagged, then he would be shamed and have to step down as Nasi, to be replaced by Rabbi Noson, and allowing Rabbi Meir to become the Av Bais Din.  Rabbi Yaakov ben Kodshi got wind of the plot and warned Rabbi Shimon, who crammed during the night and successfully gave the lecture the next day.  Rabbi Shimon expelled Rabbi Noson and Rabbi Meir from the bais midrash and instructed that any questions that those inside could not answer would be taken to the two rabbis outside.  Rabbi Shimon eventually let them back in, but decreed that they be fined and that after that date, none of their subsequent teachings could be quoted in their own names, but would Rabbi Meir's statements would be cited to \"Some say\" and Rabbi Nosson would be cited as \"Others say.\" Rebbe (Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi) followed this rule when he established the Mishnah.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot speculate whether these shocking stories were a product of Rabbi Meir's association with Acher (Rabbi Elisha ben Avuyah), but it is clear from the story you cite in Chagigah 15b that Acher had lost his own moral compass already.  There, the story is told that Rabbi Meir tried to bring Acher back to the beis midrash even though Acher stated that he had \"heard from the other side\" that his repentence would not be accepted.  They come across a young boy and Acher either (a) butchered the boy or else (b) said that he would have killed the boy if he had a knife. </p>\n\n<p>All in all, I don't think the relationship of Rabbi Meir and Acher is an appropriate case from which to learn that it is permissible to study with an apostate.</p>\n\n\n",

The only reason why we still continue this ban today is because the Rishonim who lived at the time that the ban was to expire decided to extend it indefinitely, as is stated by the Rema (Even HaEzer 1:10)....</p>\n<p>The Cherem that we are discussing in our case, i.e. not to read another person's private information, was also instituted by Rabbeinu Gershom to be effective indefinitely, and was also accepted and embraced universally by all Jewish communities. Additionally, it was created as a \"fence\" so that people not transgress Torah prohibitions, i.e. the prohibitions of Loshon Hara (slander) and Rechilus (gossip) that would result from people knowing other's private business, and harm and damage that may befall people whose information becomes public knowledge, including informing (Mesira). This was evidently a prevalent problem in the times of Rabbeinu Gershom. Therefore, this Cherem must also be considered a \"Cherem D'Oraysoh\", and one must be stringent regarding it even in a case of doubt, as stated above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This, he says, is the length of the lunar month.</p>\n\n<p>But later, after making the point in 6:5 that dividing a lunar month into groups of seven (i.e. weeks) yields a remainder of 1 day, 12 hours, and 793 units, he then goes on to say (6:6) that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you know the time of the conjunction [of the sun and the moon] for any particular month, and add 1 - 12 - 793, you will arrive at the time of the conjunction of the following month.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, I think I'm missing something basic here: why do you have to add that remainder to calculate the next molad? I don't understand, why, in the first place we're dividing a lunar month into groups of seven? Seems arbitrary to me. So, if the interval from one molad to the next is 29 full days, 12 hours of the 30th day, and 793 units of the 13th hour, then why does he later to say to add 1 - 12 - 793? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Rambam here is giving an easy way to calculate the moment of conjunction for future months. A (lunar synodic) month, as you stated, is 29 days 12 hours and 793/1080 hours. Since 28 days is exactly 4 weeks (bringing us back to the same point in the week), the next conjunction will occur 1 day 12 hours and 793/1080 hours later in the week relative to the previous conjunction. This is useful because usually you can know approximately when the next conjunction will be. By adding 1-12-793 to a given conjunction time repeatedly, one can easily calculate a later conjunction time without constantly canceling out 7 days.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/3806.htm#5\">Kiddush HaChodesh 6:5</a>) also gives similar mnemonics for figuring out the conjunction of a given month in later years. For calculating conjunction after 12 months (a regular year) add 4 days 8 hours and 876/1080 hours. For calculating conjunction after 13 months (a leap year) add 5 days 21 hours and 589/1080 hours. (And you can check by finding the difference between those two to be exactly 1 day 12 hours and 793/1080 hours which is from the addition of 1 extra month.) He also gives a mnemonic for the passage of 19 years (the Machzor -- cycle of leap years) to be 2 days 16 hours and 595/1080 hours.</p>\n\n\n",

The rear limbs are not kosher.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What is really kosher food that is meat? I am asking this question with respect to animal meat only.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>To get Kosher meat takes three main steps: choosing the right animal, killing it in the proper way, and removing non-kosher parts from it. (This is all an oversimplification, of course.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Choosing the right animal</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Kosher land mammals are those who chew their cud and have split hooves. Kosher birds are those that aren't one of the ones listed as not kosher <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0514.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in the Bible</a>. Note some avoid species of birds that we don't have a tradition are kosher, lest they be one of the non-kosher ones. Kosher fish have fins and scales. Kosher locusts...well, who wants to eat those anyway? Oh, and the animals can't be terminally ill; for certain species that often have issues in this regard, a post-mortem inspection is performed.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Killing it in the proper way</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Fish and locusts can be killed in any way. Mammals and birds are killed by slicing the throat with a sharp, perfectly non-serrated knife using a slicing motion not a chopping motion. This is done by Jews who are experts trained in the specifics of the laws of slaughtering, known as Shochtim. A short blessing is recited prior to killing the animal as before all Mitzvot, but it is not an essential part of the process.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Removing non-kosher parts from it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are three parts of an animal which may be non-kosher. In birds and land mammals, the blood is not kosher so it is drained, and further removed by salting or roasting the meat to draw out the blood. In land mammals, the sciatic nerves are not kosher. In domesticated land mammals, certain fats in the rear of the animal are not kosher as well. These last two problems can be removed, but it takes a lot of time and effort so in countries with a sizable non-kosher meat market, the back half of domesticated mammals is often just sold away.</p>\n\n<p>For everything else, bon appétit!</p>\n\n\n",

Today, Rabbi Berel Wein, <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/m/pb/Mincha_-_The_Afternoon_Prayer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">argues</a> that Mincha is \"perhaps the most important and meaningful prayer service of the day\" precisely because it is inconvenient, must be done in a narrow window of time, and interrupts the work day. Because it comes in the middle of the work day, it \"is an oasis of spiritual time in a tough workday.\" Shachris and Maariv, however, are possible to be prayed outside of difficult time constraints.  </p>\n\n<p>One could argue that Maariv is least in importance because it doesn't have a direct connection to the daily Tamid offering.

Any ideas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Here are some thoughts. I'm not familiar with the process of Jewish law (I'm not Jewish), so I'm not writing with authority. These are just answers to questions that I've asked in my own desire to understand where I can hear that God is speaking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Questioning rabbinical law</strong></p>\n\n<p>In order to find some common ground, it would be helpful to listen to what his real concerns and reasons are. How did he come to this position, and why does he find it important to stay there? I would especially wonder how he knows what reasoning to apply to the written Torah without taking part in the wider rabbinic conversation and its traditions regarding that process. But there may also be some very important issues to consider from his point of view.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism is a revealed religion and the commandments you follow are from God, so you can't just put words or commandments into His mouth. Sometimes your integrity before Him in prayer is directly at stake, as in brachot where you thank Him for giving particular mitzvot. There's also the objection that rabbinic law is much more detailed than the written Torah, so that sometimes a mountain of halacha is hung from a single thread from Torah; and that the Pharisaic approach to Judaism isn't reflected clearly in the earlier records of Tanach. The question arises about how much is new. Historically, why should a Jew believe that much of the oral Torah can be directly traced to the community in Moses' time, or that until the last part of the Second Temple period there was hardly any disagreement between rabbis? And how can you separate the commandments of God from human customs and traditions that are valid but not binding, when the two are presented to you inseparably? What about the issues of social dynamics, controlling attitudes from leadership, and the willingness of some crowds to follow like sheep? Or the fact that some decisions by trusted Jewish leaders are wrong, and it can take a long time for these things to become clearer to the community? How do you keep your personal responsibility in the short term?</p>\n\n<p>Your friend needs to understand that God has preserved His words and a testimony about Himself, and His Law, among all the generations of Israel, but the reality is that not just any group can claim that they uniquely hold such truth and authority. Even among diverse groups who recognise each other's legitimacy but hold carefully to their own rulings, the differences might bring unnecessary divisions. And because of the many fences that have been instituted to protect and preserve both the letter and the spirit of Torah amidst Israel, it needs to be known that every stringency inherently holds a leniency, at least in the ability to be close to the reality of Torah and to have the peace of mind that is needed for following God according to the holiness and blessing of this covenant.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reasons why rabbinic law is binding</strong></p>\n\n<p>That said, I don't believe that Jews can keep the Torah truly and completely without doing so in accordance with community, honouring the huge conversation of Judaism about how to keep and honour Torah, and submitting to the things that are agreed upon in the Talmud. As one who can't comment too much, I still believe that it's important in light of how God created His relationship with you as a nation, together, and the particular role that you have in His program for humanity. Here are some reasons.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>God gave the Torah as a living testimony, to be held by a nation together in all the intricacies of human lives, culture, and conversations. The question is, what method did He put in place to preserve it? The Law given orally was written down, as an authority to keep it in memory and to check against corruption. But this can't be all. Why does anyone believe that those laws and narratives are from God at all, any more than any other book? The people who keep Shabbos and the festivals, kashrut, and other laws of various kinds, and have been shaped by living them, claim to be the ones to whom God said \"You are my witnesses\" in a unique continuity; that He set aside a nation of priests, so to speak, and promised that His words would never leave the mouths of their descendants. It's they who recognised the prophets, brought together and preserved the canon of Tanach. <em>Belief in the overriding authority of the written Torah is actually an aspect of the tradition as well.</em></p></li>\n<li><p><em>There are many laws given in passing in the Torah, where extra information is needed.</em> Presumably the community had already been taught how to keep them, because you can't give a law in point form or brief allusions on the first occasion when it is communicated. There are also some areas where not enough detail is given in the written Torah to keep some of the laws that it contains. Most significantly with Shabbos: you need to rest from your work, and there is a death penalty for ignoring it. But in what situations should it be said that someone has violated Shabbos and is liable for such a huge penalty? Not only that, but <em>it is given not merely to individuals for obedience, but to a whole community as a collective sign. It matters to keep these commandments together, not alone.</em> These points lead to the fact that some aspects of the oral Law (i.e. the law lived out and passed on) must have come from the time of the writing of the Torah, and that they are considered very important. They also give authority to leaders in the community to keep the observance unified on a collective level.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Tanach mentions the authority of judges, priests, and teachers in applying the Law and making rulings in a community context.</em> Of course it needs to be discussed in what cases the enactments of these authorities remain binding for later generations or for other communities; also, whether rabbis now are in the same category. But among the many references to this in the Torah, Deuteronomy 17:8-13 stands out in giving a death penalty to anyone who is in contempt of decisions brought to the Levitical priests. It's a serious issue, and shows that 'written Torah alone' was not the original intention.</p></li>\n<li><p>Both the Torah and the realities of everyday life are very complex. <em>A lot of these fences exist to make everyday applications easier for the community, so that there will be no confusion</em> (which can be crippling in itself) about whether the Torah is being guarded as regards the innumerable questions that come up and are important in a legal covenant setting. This allows the community to focus on your commitment to holiness, and ensures the continuity of this observance by making the passing down of living Torah easier and stronger. Even though any unnecessary stringency to rabbinic customs is very damaging, there are also times where experience (perhaps over a few generations) has shown how needed it is.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can still ask what makes the Orthodox Jewish process of halacha more legitimate than any other group's, and what to do in the case where rabbinic authority is over-stated. But <em>deferring to professionals and to the insight of the larger community is important, because there are always people who have studied the Law in much greater detail, and whose knowledge of God is deeper and closer.</em> As a collective, Israel has passed on many understandings that are relevant to your life today but that you couldn't adequately figure out from scratch in a whole lifetime. Not only in terms of the quantity of knowledge, but also the spirit and application of Torah. The example of Aaron explaining why he seemingly broke a commandment from Moses in Leviticus 10:8-20 shows how the commandments need to be understood in a careful interaction, which demands high integrity, understanding, and even authority. There is no breakaway movement or individual who could build up such complex understanding alone about things that are binding, even just from the written Torah.</p></li>\n<li><p>So, when the testimony and authority of the community and its appointed leadership is over-emphasised, how to correct that? Because it takes a long time to properly discuss individual matters, there should be direct continuity in Judaism, relying on the conversation that has been bigger than yourself. <em>The constant evaluation and reformation of Orthodox traditions to be closer to Torah has to happen in a community context.</em> Often it does come out of the questions of individual people, but often also it's the individual who can learn from the others around them and is corrected. Only in a case of suspected injustice in the particular application of a judgment would there really be a reason to go against the community. When that relationship is properly understood and lived, it seems to still allow for a lot of diversity and freedom.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my observation, it seems like the tradition is most commonly ignored when the truth and original intention of the written Torah is doubted as well. It's so clear in Tanach and in our own experiences that God has given a unique kind of witness to Israel as a nation, in collective observance and preserving of the Torah. You are kept by the Torah and you keep pointing back to it, to the knowledge of God in our world. It's true that aspects of Judaism in each generation are wrong and need to be corrected; it's also true that such correction can take time to spread throughout Judaism, and that the discussions, arguments, and decisions can be painfully divided and complex. But in the generations before us and in our own generation, <em>every Jew will find that there are others around them who have so much deeper familiarity with the spirit and details of the Law, and greater love and dedication for the Law, than their own</em>. And finally, there's the quality of being able to make decisions concerning the law on the level of the eternal community, weighing out the ramifications of your decisions across the generations: a quality which each individual alone possesses none of.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Firstly, I don't know that you necessarily <i>can</i> convince your friend, but he might wish to consider the insufficiency of the Torah without any form of additional, correlative instruction. For example, how might he deal with contradictions within the text? How might he deal with passages that go into insufficient detail for their laws to be put into practice? And how might he deal with passages so horrendously barbaric that they are literally crying out to be expounded?</p>\n\n<p>For some specific examples, consider the following three:</p>\n\n<p>• Exodus 12:5 makes it clear that one may only use a lamb or a goat as the Pesach sacrifice, but Deuteronomy 16:2 allows one to also sacrifice cattle. The rabbis understood the second of these passages to be referring to the Chagigah instead (Sifrei §171, Mishna Menachot 7:6 [82a], etc). How does your friend reconcile these passages without recourse to the Oral Law?</p>\n\n<p>• Deuteronomy 12:20-21 allows for the slaughter of animals in order to eat meat, but demands that they be slaughtered in the manner \"that I have shown you\". Given that nowhere else within the Torah is that method even alluded to, what might it have been? As the Rambam points out (Hilkhot Shechitah 1:4), the specific practices that we follow are entirely rabbinic - which is to say, entirely expounded in the rabbinic literature. How does your friend construe the passage from Deuteronomy without recourse to the rabbinic tradition?</p>\n\n<p>• Deuteronomy 21:18-21 <i>mandates</i> of parents that they take their stubborn and rebellious son outside of the city and stone him for his gluttony. The Mishna (Sanhedrin 8) goes into great detail, interpreting this passage in such a fashion that it cannot ever be put into practice, without at all abrogating the actual law that it describes. How does your friend, without recourse to such a tradition, see fit to nullify or explain this particular law away?</p>\n\n<p>These are only three examples; there are abundantly more for all three types of problems. But be aware: none of these arguments specifically justifies the rabbinic tradition. They speak to the fact that there absolutely has to be something more than just the written Torah, if your intentions are to live your life (and moreso, run a state) in accordance with its principles. Whether or not your friend chooses to embrace the idea that the rabbinic traditions are from Sinai, he must reckon with the fact that the written Torah alone is insufficient, and with the fact that all groups who have argued in favour of its sufficiency have, in time, developed their own correlative legislation anyway.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here is another source:  In Deut. 12:21, it says \"Then [when Israel enters the Land] you may slaughter of your herd and flock . . . as I have commanded you.\"  Ask your friend to find the commandment described in the verse.  It cannot be found, this was one of the instructions on performing the commandments that was given ORALLY to Moses.</p>\n\n<p>Also, he might refer to the story at Num. 15:32-36, where a man was found gathering sticks on the Sabbath.  The congregation all knew he had violated the Sabbath.  But where, in the Torah, is there a commandment about gathering sticks?  It says you shall do no work, but the Torah really doesn't define the term.  And yet, the people all knew that part of the law (they didn't know the method of execution though), and knew that the law-breaker also should have known better.  Where did they hear the details?  Moses got it from the Oral law given by Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>However, these verses only help define those laws which the rabbis have concluded came directly from G-d in an oral tradition.  It does not explain their authority to enact rules to help us avoid violating Torah laws.  However, at Deut. 30:16, we have a Biblical commandment to keep G-d's commandments, statutes and ordinances.  How are commandments, statutes and ordinances different.  Commandments refers to the easily-found \"Thou shalt...\" commandments in the Torah.  The statutes would refer to the Orally-transmitted laws such as I referenced above, or those we learned from the Naviim (prophets), such as the rule that no kohen can marry a convert.  That leaves ordinances.  These, I would submit (and -- others can help with a good citation I can't find right now -- I believe the rabbis agree) are the rabbinic rules necessary to apply Torah to an ever changing world.  Their authority comes from Deut. 17:11 (\"According to the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall not turn aside from the sentence, which they shall declare to you, to the right hand nor to the left\").  </p>\n\n<p>You might also want to check out Moshe Koppel's 1997 book \"Meta-Halacha: Logic, Intuition and the Unfolding of Jewish Law (Jason Aronson 1997) which whether rabbinic law is intuitive or Biblically based.  I have not personally read it, but my Rav's father-in-law was giving me a review of it this past Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

Over there it's speaking about cheese made in the skin of the kevah of a nevilah of treifah. The Rema explains that because it is an issur for itself and a \"mamid\" (an integral ingredient in making this cheese that without it it wouldn't come to be) is therefore not buttel even in 1000 parts.</p>\n\n<p>What about if there would be mixed in some sort of ingredient that is also \"issur\" however is not used as a \"mamid\" but rather used as a preservative that would help sustain the the product that it should stay fresh longer. Would this also be considered a \"mamid\"? Or perhaps since it doesn't affect the main part of the food that it wouldn't have the din of a mamid (the food can be made without this preservative however it does help to extend the life of it.)</p>\n\n<p>The Rema does add in over there that if there are 2 ingredients (one issur and one heter) that are both an integral part then it would be muter if there is 60 parts against the issur. However the preservatives are seemingly not an \"integral\" part (which it in and of itself could be the answer to the question.)

You can't pretend the non-kosher rennet isn't there when if it wasn't, this wouldn't look anything like cheese!

He offered to buy it for a certain amount of money and Rav Safra didn't answer (since he was in  the middle of Krias Shema) the person thought then that he wanted more money for it so he offered to buy it at a higher price. When Rav Safra finished Krias Shema he told the person to buy it at the price he said first since that is what I had in mind to sell it to you for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This story (as far as I know) is not brought down anywhere in Sifrei Halacha or Poskim. However, my question is, is it? Should a person be nohag (behave) this way? <em>Must</em> a person be nohag this way if such a situation were to happen? Or perhaps it is only a \"middas chassidus\" (pious attribute) for those with \"more\" Yiras Shamayim (fear of heaven). I'm looking for any sources in the realm of halacha that speak about this sort of situation and how one should be nohag and if it's \"m'ikar hadin\" (required according to law) or only middos chassidus (or the like.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein actually cites this story in a responsum (CM 1:58) regarding joining a labor union. He says that a non-oath commitment made to a union is of very strong religious value; any \"G-d fearing person\", even if he's not \"pious\", should make good on his verbal commitments. If Rav Safra made good on his mental commitments, certainly we should make good on our verbal ones.</p>\n\n<p>My impression, though, is that a case actually like Rav Safra's is considered a measure of great piety and is not demanded of an average person. Ask your rabbi if being like Rav Safra is right for you.</p>\n\n<p>As further proof, there's a discussion in Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 204:17) of <em>mechusrei amanah</em> (breach of faith); if someone said \"I'll buy a hundred widgets from you at fair market value\", to renege on that commitment is ethically shameful (though technically legal). There were opinions that if the market value of widgets changes it is completely ethical to go back on the commitment; while we don't rule that way, no one there seems to mention Rav Safra, to the best of my knowledge (other than the above responsum from Rabbi Feinstein).</p>\n\n\n",

However <strong>most poskim rule that the name of God written in any language other than Hebrew has no holiness and can be erased</strong>. (Shach Y.D. 179:11; Mishnah Berurah 85:10). There should therefore be no halakhic prohibition to write it.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless as mentioned <a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/god-or-g-d.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> some poskim rule to be extra careful with names of God (e.g., the Aruch Hashulchan CM 27:3). This is likely going beyond the minimum law (similar to the Geonim quoted in commentaries to Nedarim 7) who have a chumra (stringency) to refrain from even saying a divine <strong>nickname</strong> in vain). See bottom of <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2015/07/swear-to-g-d/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/83/when-blogging-emailing-etc-do-i-use-god-or-g-d/86#86\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36675/why-are-jews-so-meticulous-about-not-saying-writing-god/59268#59268\">here</a> for more sources from MiYodeya.

I like the story about Rav Soloveitchik z\"l intentionally writing GOD on the board while teaching a class and then just as deliberately and intentionally erasing it, so as to demonstrate by his own example that this was not halakhically a problem. But I couldn't find a source for it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was Hosea acceptable to the people if he took his adulterous wife back?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Hosea is described by Rabbi Yochanan in Pesachim 87a as the greatest of the four major prophets.  At G-d's command (Hosea 1:2), he married a prostitute, Gomer, and fathered children, although there was some doubt as to whether they were all his.  His wife continues her harlotry even after they are married, but Hosea refuses to divorce her.  This is turned into a beautiful metaphor for G-d's refusal to divorce Israel, although it, too, had strayed.  I understand it to be black-letter halacha that a husband must at least divorce his wife if she admitting to having sex with another man.  (Of course, in Temple times, she and her lovers would have been subject to a criminal trial if two witnesses could testify they saw her commit adultery.)  </p>\n\n<p>My question is: how could Hosea's prophecy be accepted if he refused to follow one commandment?  Also, couldn't his prophecy that G-d told him to take Gomer back (Hosea 3:1; Pesachim 87b) be considered self-serving?  Rabbi Barry Fruendel suggested to me that Hosea got a \"pass\" because he was a prophet.  What is the basis for that?

There the issue concerns whether a son, who is a dentist, may do dental work on his father in order to save the father a substantial amount of money.  The article includes numerous sources which speak to the general halacha, which asserts that: (a) it is forbidden to hit or wound any Jew -- more so if you cause him to bleed, with the exception being that a doctor can cause his patient to bleed for medical purposes; and (b) there is a separate commandment that prevents a son from hitting his parent and causing the parent to bleed.  (See רמ\"א יו\"ד סי' רמא סעי') The article cites the Chidah and others for the position that if there is another doctor available, then it is forbidden for the child to do so.  </p>\n\n<p>However, the Minchas Chinuch (מנחת חינוך מצוה מח), rules that if the parent gives his or her permission, then the child could even hit the parent and cause bleeding!  The article cites former Israeli Chief Rabbi Yitzhok HaLevi Herzog and Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, among others, who would follow the Minchas Chinuch in medical situations.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible that the opinion of the Minchas Chinuch might open the door for a rabbinic ruling that a father and son could practice martial arts together, even if that meant that the child could cause his father to bleed.  If I were to take this question to my local Orthodox rabbi, I might stipulate that both father and son will be fully padded, to make bleeding less likely.  Still, local Orthodox rabbi might ask whether there is anyone else who can practice with father and son.  Also, local Orthodox rabbi might very well decide that the opinion of the Minchas Chinuch is limited to medical necessity issues and that the father cannot give permission to son to hit him -- at least not hard enough to cause bleeding.</p>\n\n\n",

The commentaries (eg Kesef Mishnah) to the Rambam's citation of this law (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=90194&rid=14697\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mamrim 6:11</a>) make this point as well.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna there says any son a man has, even a Mamzer (see how the Gemara derives this on the next page), counts as a son for laws like Chalitza/Yibbum, cursing, hitting etc. unless that son is from a non-Jewess.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems the Shulchan Aruch and Rambam are just following the Mishna in this regard. As for why the Mishna had to say it, see the Gemara there which asks why the Mishna had to specify that a Mamzer counts as a brother for purposes of Yibbum. It answers that you might have thought the obligations only apply to Kosher relatives not Pasul ones. Perhaps a similar logic applies in the second case of the Mamzer son.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# May we genetically engineer stuff?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The possibilities of genetic engineering continue to grow. May a Jewish scientist genetically engineer things? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Genetic engineering has been cited by some as both halachically acceptable and problematic in several respects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stem Cell Research</strong> -- Unlike some other religions, Judaism does not define a fetus as a human being with full rights until after 40 days of gestation.  Yevamos 69a; Nidda 30b.  But see Rebbe's position at Sanhedrin 91a (holding that the soul is created at gestation).  Accordingly, most poskim permit Jewish scientists to do research on embryo stem cells that are less than 40 days since gestation. Sources: <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100553\" rel=\"nofollow\">RCA Statement</a> and a lecture I heard from Rabbi Dr. Barry Fruendel.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloning</strong> -- Research indicates that, subject to more safety improvements, it will be possible for a woman to take her own skin or bone-marrow cells and create a gamete-like cells with only 23 chromosomes that could be attached to the woman's own egg cell to create a perfect copy of herself.  This could be a violation of the concept raised in Niddah 30 that there are three partners to the creation of a new soul, a man, a woman and Hashem.  Cloning would appear to intentionally by-pass part of this Divine process.  To my knowledge, this has only been studied by our sages from the perspective of unmarried women using in vitro fertilization to have children without having relations.  But the decisions of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, zt'l, Nishmat Avraham, vol. 4, Even haezer 1:3, and Rav Moshe Feinstein, zt'l, cited in R.V. Grazi and J.B. Wolowelsky, “Parenthood from the Grave,” The Jewish Spectator 65:4 (Spring 2001, Aviv 5761), appear more concerned that the sperm donor might not be Jewish.  So I am unaware of a precedential decision that is directly on point here.</li>\n<li><strong>Transgenic Species</strong> -- Already we are seeing the use of DNA material from foreign species injected into the cellular structures of animals and plants to alter those species into what is called a transgenic species -- and also the enhancement of an animal's DNA with the DNA of other creatures of its species, a process called cisgenic.  While cisgenic animals and plants are not problematic, the creation of transgenic species crosses into the area of kilayim.  Leviticus 19:19 states: \"You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your animal mate with a different species; you shall not sow your field with different species of plants.\" Most sages appear to agree that, with respect to animals, the prohibition only applies to actual inter-breeding of mixed species.  Taking the genetic material of different animal species and making transfers on the cellular level is generally accepted.  Akiva Wolff, \"<a href=\"http://jcpa.org/art/jep2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Perspectives on Genetic Engineering</a>,\" Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (Oct. 2001).  However, there are differing opinions about transgenic plant species.  Id.</li>\n<li><strong>Transgenic Animals With Human DNA</strong> -- Some scientists believe that research on brain diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's requires using stem cells to creating lab animals (apes in particular) with genetically human brains.  Beyond the ethical considerations raised in the science fiction movie, Planet of the Apes, some commentators have suggested that the rabbis' current view that transgenic animals are not subject to kilayim should be reconsidered if their view is based on the assumption that the animals will be sterile.  If they can be made to reproduce with human-type gonads, writes <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/760423/Perlow,__Leora\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leora Perlow</a> and <a href=\"http://jcpa.org/article/halachic-challenges-emerging-from-stem-cell-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John D. Loike</a> (separately), it may be possible that in a few generations the grandchildren of the original transgenic ape could mate with a human.  Whereas the species of cross-bred animals was always decided by the mother of the animal (Bechoros 5b), what do we call the product of a transgenic advanced ape male and a human female?  And what halachic status will the product have?  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From: <a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/ramban/10ramban.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vbm-torah.org/archive/ramban/10ramban.htm</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the reason for kilayim is that God created the different species in the world for all the different kinds of souls, in plants and in those that have the animative soul, and he gave them the power of reproduction, that the species should exist for eternity, for as long as He should desire the existence of the world, and He ordered that that power should reproduce the species and never ever change, as is written (in Bereishit) concerning each (species), \"l'mineihu\" (for its species). And this is the reason that we breed animals in order to preserve the species, just as men come unto women for (the purpose of) reproduction. But one who intermixes two species changes and negates the act of creation, as though he thinks that God did not complete His world sufficiently, and he wishes to assist creation by adding creatures to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Genetic engineering is even worse in this regard since you are completely changing the organism.</p>\n\n<p>But this needs to be tempered with the knowledge that virtually nothing we eat today is like Hashem made it. The wheat we eat today is completely different from what they ate in ancient times. (They ate what we call wild Emmer wheat, we eat durum wheat hybridized with goat grass.) The wheat has changed to the point that it can not even self propagate - it requires humans to plant it. (This change is why ancient Matzah was soft like pita, and ours is hard.)</p>\n\n<p>Our cows are much much larger than theirs, same for chickens and turkeys. (Interestingly modern turkeys also can not reproduce on their own.)</p>\n\n<p>The soft corn we eat did not exist in the past. (And to continue the theme, soft corn also can not propagate on its own.)</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I feel pretty confident in the saying that not a single vegetable in the supermarket is like Hashem made it - and not minor changes either. Major differences in the taste, size, how long it takes to grow.</p>\n\n<p>But, all this needs to understood in light of the question of how much change is called change.</p>\n\n<p>After all, <a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/m/article_cdo/aid/986692\" rel=\"nofollow\">it is permitted to graft</a> together plants together if they are of similar species. For example the wheat hybridization I mentioned above is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>So, in that light the plants and animals we eat have not changed enough to be called new species. And genetic engineering usually limits itself to small changes, which are not enough to make a new species.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Not at all. As the Yerushalmi (Nedarim 9:1) asks rhetorically:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא דייך מה שאסרה תורה אלא שאתה אוסר עליך דברים אחרים</p>\n  \n  <p>Is what the Torah forbade not enough for you, that you [seek to]\n  forbid other things upon yourself?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for the reason for the prohibition on <em>kil'ayim</em>, no one claims to have the definitive answer. It is not considered a moral imperative, but rather a <em>chok</em>; a rule without a known reason. We can speculate from here till tomorrow - as Maimonides does in his guide - but it's only speculation. When it comes to deciding halachic matters, such speculation without proof has no place.</p>\n\n\n",

Coincidentally however, I have thought of a comparable precedent which demonstrates how it is permissible to travel through time. </p>\n\n<p>Whenever we move, we inevitably alter time imperceptibly because of time dilation, according to the theory of relativity. And there is no halacha issue with movement, so it follows that there is no halacha issue of altering time. Perhaps according to the same logic, altering your position in time in the backward direction would not be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>However, another issue can be at play. If one travels gradually backward in a machine of sorts and passes through the time of Shabbat or Yom Tov, it would seem that the familiar issues with operating machinery on these days would apply, even though one would be moving backward in time. If one could somehow skip from one moment to another though, he/she may be able to circumvent this problem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Talmud in Tractate Menachot (29b) says Moshe Rabeinu was transported in time to Rabbi Akiva's torah class and couldn't follow it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torahtots.com/torah/tagin.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torahtots.com/torah/tagin.htm</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The mishna in Chagigah (2:1) mentions some things which man cannot delve into:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל המסתכל בארבעה דברים, ראוי לו כאילו לא בא לעולם--מה למעלה, מה למטה, מה לפנים, מה לאחור.  וכל שלא חס על כבוד קונו, ראוי לו כאילו לא בא לעולם.</p>\n  \n  <p>\" Whoever looks at four things, it would have been better for him if\n  he had never come into the world: 1) what is above [the sky], 2) what\n  is below [the earth], 3) what was before [the Creation] and 4) what\n  will be after [in the end of days]. And whoever takes no account of\n  the honor of his Maker [see the following section in the Gemara], it\n  would have been better for him if he had never come into the world.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These appear to refer to Hashem's realm of space ('above' and 'below') and time ('before' and 'after'). There are those things which are inherently incomprehensible to us. Although this isn't directly related to time travel, it Bartenura writes how it related to unknowable epochs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה לפנים? קודם שנברא העולם. מה לאחור? בסוף העולם לאחרית הימים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Bartenura knowledge of 'pre-Earth' as well as 'acharit hayamim' (a specific point in time in the future) would be problematic.</p>\n\n<p>The Kehati gives further explanation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולכן אסור לו לחקור בהם, כי עלול הוא לבוא לידי טעויות ולידי מבוכה בענייני האמונה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having said all this, this is in reference to <em>learning</em> about these topics.

    "content": "# Do angels have jealousy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a famous Midrash in Shab. 87a-b, the angels object to the Torah being given to humans, until Moshe proves that it is only relevant to humans because of their nature. In one example, he asks rhetorically, \"Do you (angels) have jealousy (that might lead you to kill or covet)?\"</p>\n\n<p>Well, to be honest, they were acting rather jealous. So, <em>do</em> angels have jealousy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>It is clear that angels have jealousy towards humans from <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14308&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfiyos Brachos 3a</a> that says that some say that we say certain prayers in Aramaic in order that the angels should not be jealous of us, and Tosfiyos does not say there is no jealousy, only that we say other prayers in Lashon Kodesh so that can not be the reason. Also <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=44&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Braishis 1:26</a> indicates that angels have jealousy towards humans. </p>\n\n<p>Per <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14294&st=&pgnum=20&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifsei Chachamim Breishis 1:26</a> the angels do not have jealousy among themselves, however they do have jealousy towards human beings. (Thanks to IsraelReader for the source).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Berachos 16b-17a implies that angels do fight with each other (see top Rashi on 17a), and Rabbeinu Bechaye (Bereishis 18:2) writes that the posuk that we say in davening עושה שלום במרומיו (Job 25) means that Hashem gives distinct tasks to each angel so that they dont end up encroaching upon each other's roles and fighting. So we see that angels arent really flawless.</p>\n\n<p>I once heard Rabbi Shafier explain that angels have free will but dont sin because they see Hashem so clearly that for them, the choice to sin would be idiotic, comparable to a man sticking his hand in a fiery furnace to win a bet. Does he have the free choice to do so? Certainly, we have the free choice to injure ourselves, but it is an easy choice not to make. So too with angels: jealousy is something we feel when are insecure if what we have is best suited for us, or perhaps if the possessions of someone else more appropriately belong to me! Ibn Ezra on Lo sachmod (Yisro) explains that the way to avoid feeling jealous is to recognize that Hashem runs the world and knows what He is doing, and therefore I really do have the wife/car/house/life that is best for me. But man has a difficult time keeping this is mind and so he comes to murder, theft, and even adultery. But what Moshe was telling the angels was that mal'achim see Hashem so clearly that they have no reason to be envious of each other to the extent of murder and robbery.</p>\n\n<p>However when it came to Hashem's decision to give the Torah to mankind, the angels were less understanding of why Hashem wanted to give His special Laws to imperfect man.

(Interestingly, the case they discuss is where some guy forced his wife to dip in snow and he wants to know now if it worked; you'd think he should have asked before forcing his wife to do that...)</p>\n\n<p>The Beit Yosef (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14272&&pgnum=215\">YD 201</a>) writes that the majority opinion and Halacha is in accordance with Rabbeinu Shemarya, but out of deference to the other two he recommends relying on this only for Rabbinic immersions (this would seem to include Netillat Yadayim, glass dishes, and certainly Tevillat Ezra (perhaps also a Niddah who found a rabbinic Chatzitza after immersing in a regular Mikvah)). However in his Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40530&hilite=4b93ae83-3da1-49c9-a1a4-94a8b78f3984&st=%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%20%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9C%20%D7%91%D7%9B%D7%9C%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%A2%D7%93&pgnum=272\">YD 201:30</a>) he rules straight-up like Rabbeinu Shemarya, with the Rama noting that others argue and one should be stringent <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/702/759\">Lechatchila</a>. The Rama does not make a distinction between Biblical or rabbinic obligations.</p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A1#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.99.D7.91\">OC 160:12</a>) also rules that one can only do Netillat Yadayim in snow if one has ground it up until it is liquid. While the Magen Avraham and Gra there interpret this as referring to if one plans on picking up the snow and pouring it with a cup (as opposed to dipping one's hands into snow on the ground), the Shach (YD 201 sk 71) says that the Beit Yosef in YD 201 misunderstood multiple Rishonim, and really no Rishon except Rabbeinu Shemarya holds that one can dip straight into snow. He rules like the simple reading of OC 160:12 that one can never do Tevillah in snow.</p>\n\n<p>From the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch you cite who only permits Netillat Yadayim in snow in a time of need, it would seem he is ruling like the Rama that one should be stringent about dipping in snow only Lechatchila. So you can accordingly tovel glass dishes (a rabbinic requirement just like Netillat Yadayim) in snow as well, in a time of need. I would hesitate before extending the Kitzur's ruling to Biblical requirements (such as the need to tovel metal dishes, cf <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9106&pgnum=614\">Aruch haShulchan YD 120:4</a>) without an explicit source to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Yitzchak Abadi(Ohr Yitzchak chelek 2 YD 17:12) quotes the ShuLchan Aruch YD 201:30 that collected water is pasul for mikvah but not snow... and even if one uses a whole mikvah full of snow it is good.Even though the Rama writes we should be machmir and wait until it melts this is talking in the case of a niddah but one would not have to be stringent  by utensils(this includes d'oraisas as well),and bsahas hadchak even a niddah can be tovel in snow.</p>\n\n<p>However,he brings the Chazon Ish YD 133:3 who writes that although snow can be used al pi din we should be worried that the snow did not touch all areas of the utensil.This is how Rav Abadi goes lmaase  (he writes this at the end in the summary of the siman)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the practical ramifications of Emunah being a mitzvah or not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a machlokes Rishonim whether emunah in Hashem is a mitzvah or not. The Rambam and Ramban sayig that it is. The Bahag (a Gaon), R' Kreskas, Tashbetz and others saying that it's not or that it can't be.\nWhat nafkah minah comes out of this machlokes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First of all, the question of which mitzvos make up the 613 quota might not have <em>any</em> practical ramification. The Rambam writes in his introduction that his motivation for setting down the 613 commandments is just a means to keep the Torah's laws organized. However, most commentaries printed on the Sefer Hamitzvos believe otherwise, so I'll answer the question specifically regarding \"emunah\". </p>\n\n<p>The most important difference is due to a question asked by R. Crescas, R. Albo, Abarbanel, and so many others on the Rambam, who count \"Anochi\" as a mitzvah. They ask, how can one command someone to believe? First of all, it's useless, because either someone already believes in God, and if he doesn't, a 'mitzvah' to do so won't help. Additionally, it doesn't make sense to have a mitzvah for something that is outside of one's control; these rishonim thought that <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-belief/#BelCon\" rel=\"nofollow\">a person can't just <em>will</em> himself to believe that something is true if he already believes it to be false</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In order to address this question, some have explained that when the Rambam writes that the mitzvah is to 'believe', he is actually referring to something other than mere 'belief'. Thus, the Malbim (Shemos 20:2), Maharam Schik (Mitzvah 26), Abarbanel (Rosh Amanah ch. 17) and Seforno (beginning of Ohr Amim) all explain that the commandment of אנכי ה' אלוקיך, believing in God, is actually a command to justify those beliefs, either philosophically or otherwise. (The Rambam himself discusses this in Moreh Nevuchim, specifically 1:50 where he states that in order to fulfill the mitzvah one has to be absolutely certain that God's existence is true, even though one does <strong>not</strong> have to be able to prove it). If this is not be counted as a mitzvah, perhaps there would be no requirement to justify one's belief, and can be left simply as 'belief'.</p>\n\n<p>Shut Shoel U'Meishiv (Tinyana 1:51, \"l'maskil echad\") takes the opposite position. He also asks if there's a practical difference between the Rambam and Behag in this regard, and concludes that while according to the Behag, one can come to belief in God through philosophical justification or the like, the Rambam holds that one must belief because it is a mitzvah to do so, and no other reason. (!)</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, because it's unreasonable to think that there's a command to simply 'believe that God exists', the commandment is to believe that the One God is He Who revealed Himself to our forefathers at Sinai and gave them the Torah. (See Semak Aseh 1, Sefer HaIkkarim 1:14, Drashos Haran no. 9). I would imagine, however, that this is not a nafka minah and Rav Crescas would imagine that someone would have to believe in this as well. </p>\n\n<p>Another possibility raised by R. Elchanan Wasserman is that the mitzvah as counted by the Rambam is not referring to an intellectual belief so much as it is a command to be reasonable not to be 'bribed' by the temptations that would be associated with denying God's existence. (I find this difficult for many reasons, though, and I'd love for someone to explain it to me)</p>\n\n<p>Another actual difference might be regarding non-Jews, or Noahites. If one assumes that Jews are commanded to believe in God as a separate commandment instead of the foundation for observance, than this requirement might apply differently to non-Jews. While few would say that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18628/is-it-permitted-for-a-ben-noach-be-an-atheist/48957#48957\">non-Jews are allowed to be atheists</a>, but if one were to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89/is-christianity-avodah-zara/134#134\">differentiate between the laws of idolatry for Jews and non-Jews</a>, that would be the reason (this is stated explicitly in Shu\"t Shoel U'Meishiv T'lisaah 2:29). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Maybe a nafka mina can be whether emuna is axiomatic-and you will have to come to it if you're honest, or its a mitzvah and therefore maybe in some way harder to achieve?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One practical difference is whether there is another mitzvah to take its place in order to have 613. According the the opinion that it is not a mitzvah, there must be another mitzvah that is Biblical.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Would most Jews deem a tattoo containing the tetragrammaton offensive?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that this question involves a measure of subjectivity, but I am curious to hear people's opinions. I understand that getting a (real) tattoo is forbidden by Jewish law. I also know that the name of G-d/Hashem is very holy and not spoken. When I was younger, far less concerned about offending others, and not a follower of any religion, I tattooed קֹ֖דֶשׁ לַֽיהוה on my left hand as a wedding band. I am now in the process of getting this tattoo removed (my marriage is still going strong, in case you were wondering).</p>\n\n<p>I am curious, however, if this would actually be deemed offensive to most Jews or not. Also, if there are any sources where this has been dealt with in the past I would love to hear them. Either way, I am still getting it removed.</p>\n\n<p>I ask because I intend to soon attend Hebrew school as a Gentile observer, but I am debating whether or not I should conceal my tattoo.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>The Talmud (in Masekhet Shabbat 120b) directly discusses this issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דתניא: הרי שהיה שם כתוב לו על בשרו - הרי זה לא ירחוץ ולא יסוך ולא יעמוד במקום הטינופת. נזדמנה לו טבילה של מצוה - כורך עליה גמי ויורד וטובל. רבי יוסי אומר: לעולם יורד וטובל כדרכו, ובלבד שלא ישפשף </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>As it was taught</strong> in a <em>baraita</em>: <strong>If</strong> one <strong>had a</strong> sacred <strong>name</strong> of God <strong>written on his skin he may neither wash</strong> it in water lest it be erased, <strong>nor may he smear</strong> it with oil, <strong>nor may he stand in a place of filth</strong> because it is disrespectful of God's name. <strong>If an immersion of mitzvah happened to</strong> present itself, <strong>he wraps a reed over</strong> God's name <strong>and</strong> then <strong>descends and immerses</strong>. <strong>Rabbi Yosei says: Actually, he descends and immerses in his</strong> usual <strong>manner</strong>, even if it is not an immersion of mitzva, <strong>provided that he does not rub</strong> the spot and erase the name. Apparently, Rabbi Yosei's opinion is more lenient than that of the Sages with regard to indirectly causing a prohibited outcome. \n  (Koren Talmud Bavli Steinsaltz translation - bolded words are the translated Hebrew text). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The law, as the Rambam in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39979&st=&pgnum=33\">Yesodei HaTorah 6:6</a> records, is according to the Sages: that the person must wrap a reed around the name because one may not be naked before God's name. </p>\n\n<p>Since you are asking about personal opinions, I would find it offensive to see a tattoo of God's name regardless if the person was Jewish or not. There is a visceral reaction, probably because Judaism treats the name (i.e., how it is written out, how it is not pronounced, etc.) with such reverence. I could further question the underpinnings of such emotions, but I think it is fair to say that many observant Jews would feel uncomfortable seeing such a tattoo</p>\n\n<p>So out of respect to others, I would find it more appropriate to conceal the tattoo when visiting a Hebrew school.    </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It's one thing to break laws; it's another to explicitly acknowledge the lawgiver in the process of doing so. One would generally only do so if one <em>intended</em> to offend, so if there are those who take offense one can hardly be surprised.</p>\n\n<p>Even if in your particular case it was done in ignorance, people tend not to assume that. Which is understandable, weighing the knowledge it takes to understand the significance of the Hebrew letters you used against the ignorance it takes not to know that the Torah is against tattoos.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I am not sure about my own response because by normative halacha it is not prohibited for a non-Jew to have a tattoo; only a Jew. However, the question is whether it would come off as offensive, and I don't think people will necessarily make this distinction.</p>\n\n<p>So I would say to conceal it.</p>\n\n\n",

In addition to the names listed in the question, he adds the following 2 names:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Y-ah</li>\n<li>E-hyey</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These names may not be erased because they refer to G-d himself, and not to his actions/attributes (as is apparent from the second half of the paragraph in the Kesset HaSofer). This then, seems to be the general rule. If the name refers to G-d himself it is forbidden to erase it.</p>\n\n<p>If we say that any name that is forbidden to erase is also forbidden to pronounce, then these 10 names would be forbidden to pronounce. [Note that the prohibition against erasing Names is learned from a different verse (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8303&pgnum=44\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesset HaSofer 11:1</a>) than the verses which teach us not to pronounce G-d's names (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 6:3)]</p>\n\n<p>With regards to pronouncing words, note the Kaf HaChayim mentioned in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28072/may-one-say-the-letters-of-hashems-name-i-e-yud-hei-vov-hei/28098#28098\">this answer</a>, who says that the Arizal wouldn't even say the letters of G-d's name as it was written, but would instead break it up. As I pointed out in the comment, the Kaf HaChayim doesn't say to say Kay, but that seems to be the way I always heard it growing up (may be Chabad specific). So much so that in the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16091&pgnum=74\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">new Kehot Siddur</a>, the instructions are that it is to be pronounced <em>\"‪Pronounced \"Yud Kay b'Vov Kay.‬‬\"</em> </p>\n\n<p>Besides that, I haven't seen a written source that instructs G-d's names to be altered with a Kay, but that seems to be way I always heard it growing up. so this is the way we always pronounced it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>E-l == Kel</p></li>\n<li><p>Elo-ah == Elokah</p></li>\n<li><p>Elo-him == Elokim</p></li>\n<li><p>Elo-hai == Elokai</p></li>\n<li><p>Sha-ddai == Shakkai</p></li>\n<li><p>Tz-vaot == Tzevakot</p></li>\n<li><p>Y-ah == Kah</p></li>\n<li><p>E-hyeh == I don't seem to remember people pronouncing this one Ekyeh (perhaps because the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40534&pgnum=266\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 276:9)</a> only brings this as a possible name that may not be erased), but the Kaf Hachaim explicitly brings this as a name the AriZal would alter, even when spelling.</p></li>\n<li><p>Y-H-V--H == in Chabad, this is pronounced <em>Havayeh</em>. <em>Hashem</em> is also used.</p></li>\n<li><p>A-D-ON-AI == in Chabad, this is pronounced <em>Ad'nai</em>. <em>Hashem</em> is also used.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's an example, a song composed by Chabad Chassidim in honor of the Lubavitcher Rebbe's 79th birthday (see <a href=\"http://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php?title=%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%99_%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%95%22%D7%A8_%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%98%22%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for background information), using verses from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16301#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim Chapter 80</a>.

This was Moshe's argument, that if Yisrael were not able to hear us because we were speaking together, even though we were telling something that they really wanted to hear, how is it possible that Pharaoh will hear us, \"seeing that I am of closed lips\". That is, since Moshe had a speech impediment and thus always spoke together with Aharon as per his understanding of Hashem's instructions, if Yisrael were not able to hear them, all the more so Pharaoh would not be able to hear them. Therefore, Hashem now clarified to Moshe that he was to speak first and then Aharon by himself.</p>\n\n<p>Full text in English can be found <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Other-Books/Binyan-Ariel/Vaeira.html#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>[A friend of mine suggested this answer to me and it seems right: (no source though)]</p>\n\n<p>The dialogue in Shemot 4:10-15 deals with Moshe's apprehension in speaking with the <em>Jewish people</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly Hashem tells Moshe in Passuk 16 that Aharon will be his interpreter- to the <em>Jewish people</em>.\nShemot 4:16:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And he will speak for you <strong>to the people</strong>, and it will be that he will\n  be your speaker, and you will be his leader.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So , until instructed explicitly, it would follow that Moshe would be speaking straight to Pharoh ( without Aharon as interpreter) which is why Moshe tells Hashem in Shemot 6:12 that he is \"of closed lips\".</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the earliest commentary we have that recognized Hell as a place for cleansing the soul?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to determine the most ancient extant source for the concept of Hell as a place of spiritual cleansing. Regardless of what term you use for it (etc. ,גיא בן הינום, שְׁאוֹל), I understand that most Jews teach that Hell is a place of spiritual cleansing prior to entering the world to come (גַּן עֵדֶן \"heaven,\" העולם הבא, etc.). What I am wondering is how far back this teaching can be substantiated. Who is the most ancient source making this claim and approximately what time period was it made? For instance, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7413/1257\">another user mentioned Nachmanides in Sha'ar HaGemul quoting Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer concerning שְׁאוֹל as well as some other sources</a>, when would these have been written (approximately)? Are there any older sources?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Pirkei deRabbi Eli'ezer is a compilation of midrashim [rabbinic allegory and exegesis], and the dating is questionable but scholars generally assign it to the eighth or ninth century. My reading of that source, though, doesn't say anything about Sheol as a place of cleansing the soul, but simply that Sheol is the lowest of the seven levels of Gehinnom.</p>\n\n<p>As for your question, one of the earliest Jewish sources in my mind would be the (Babylonian) Talmud (completed circa 500 CE). The (Hebrew) Bible doesn't mention anything about She'ol as a place of cleansing — in the TaNaKh, She'ol is simply the place where a person's life-force goes when they die. In the Talmud, however, we read (Rosh haShana 16b-17a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The entirely righteous will be inscribed and sealed definitively for everlasting life, the entirely wicked will be inscribed and sealed definitively for Gehinnom... But the average people [beinonim] will go down to Gehinnom, [until they] cry out [in prayer - the word here is <em>metsaphtsephin</em>, and the meaning is not entirely clear], and then they will rise up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later on this same page, the rabbis discuss the different kinds of people who go to Gehinnom and the lengths of time they need to spend there.</p>\n\n<p>I'm far from a Talmudic scholar, so I'm sure the other knowledgeable users on this site will have additional, illuminating comments to add.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The belief in reward and punishment in the afterlife is a fundamental tenet of the Jewish faith (11th Principle of Rambam's 13 Principles of Faith). The earliest references I know of are various references in the Babylonian Talmud.  Rosh Hashana 16b-17a attributes the view to Bais Shammai (ca 1st Century C.E.).  Rabbi Akiva (ca 40 CE - ca 137 CE) is a bit more specific about how the non-wicked but less than righteous would be cleansed in Gehinnom for not more than 12 months.  Mishna, Eduyos 2:10.  </p>\n\n<p>Although the books of the Tanach (i.e. the Hebrew Bible) allude to the afterlife, as the Talmudic citations above reveal, it is not very specific which is one reason the Sadducee sect refused to recognize the concept.  See Josephus, <a href=\"http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Antiquities of the Jews, Book 18 Chapter 1</a>.  Our sages of the late Second Temple (sometimes known as the Pharisees), held to the belief in reward and punishment after death as a lesson of the Oral Torah -- the unwritten detailing of laws given by G-d to Moses and passed down generation to generation thereafter.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=13&daf=15b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chagigah 15B</a>  - <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Chagigah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soncino translation</a> - (emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Aher died, they said: Let him not be judged, nor let him enter the world to come.

David Bleich (Tradition 42:4), in which a pseudo-Kabbalist directed a woman to get a tattoo containing the Divine Name. The question of removing it was brought to Sephardic Chief Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron and printed in <em>Or ha-Torah</em> Shevat 5762. R. Bleich's summarizes R. Bakshi-Doron's teshuvah that permitted such a removal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Teshuvot Havvot Yair</em> [no. 16] rules that a Divine Name written expressly for a mundane purpose may be erased...Rabbi Bakshi-Doron assumes that, in the case presented to him, the Divine Name was written for a mundane purpose [and can be removed]. </p>\n  \n  <p>[...] R. Moshe Sefer, <em>Teshuvot Hatam Sofer</em>, VI, no. 8, discusses the\n  case of a properly written biblical verse that was subsequently pasted\n  on the wall of a privy...in the event that a non-Jew is not available\n  to do so, <em>Hatam Sofer</em> permits a Jew to scratch off the writing in\n  order to prevent ongoing desecration of the Divine Name. Rabbi\n  Bakshi-Doron regards removal of a tattoo containing the Divine Name to\n  be comparable.</p>\n  \n  <p>There may be additional operative consideration as well. Rambam <em>Hilkhot Tefillin</em> 1:13, followed by <em>Shulchan Arukh</em> 281:1, rules that a Torah scroll written by a Jewish \"<em>apikores</em>\" must be burned...Rambam, <em>Hilkhot Yesodei ha-Torah</em> 6:8, defines the term \"<em>apikores</em>\" as used in this context in the more general sense of \"heretic\" and comments that a Torah scroll written by an <em>apikores</em> \"is to be burned together with its Divine Names because [the heretic] does not believe in the sanctity of the Name...Since such is his opinion the Name does not become sanctified and it is a <em>mitzvah</em> to burn it in order that there be left neither a name to the heretics nor to their deeds.\" Rabbi Bakshi-Doron concludes that, according to the Rambam, not only may a Divine Name tattooed by a heretic be destroyed but that it is a <em>mitzvah</em> to do so. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the only responsa I have found that deals with erasing a modern tattoo containing the Divine Name. This does not necessarily answer the original question, since </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The original question (from Dan) involved a gentile</li>\n<li>In the article, R. Bleich disregards R. Bakshi-Doron's first explanation, and I just don't understand how any similar tattoo could be explained as \"for a mundane purpose\" (remember that the original question had the tattoo of \"Holy to the Lord\")</li>\n<li>If the tattoo was not a heretic's design, but rather the wearer's, e.g., a gentile or a non-observant Jew, it is not clear that there is any <em>mitzvah</em> to remove it. </li>\n<li>A tattoo is not necessarily like a verse in a privy, since it can avoid ongoing desecration (simple covering would prevent the Name from exposure to nakedness/filth and would prevent anyone else from seeing it). </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Furthermore, this teshuva was for a particular case with its own story, not a blanket statement allowing removal of the Divine Name on a tattoo.  </p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>As I wrote in Dan's question:</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (in Masekhet Shabbat 120b) directly discusses this issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דתניא: הרי שהיה שם כתוב לו על בשרו - הרי זה לא ירחוץ ולא יסוך ולא\n  יעמוד במקום הטינופת. נזדמנה לו טבילה של מצוה - כורך עליה גמי ויורד\n  וטובל. רבי יוסי אומר: לעולם יורד וטובל כדרכו, ובלבד שלא ישפשף</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>As it was taught</strong> in a <em>baraita</em>: <strong>If</strong> one <strong>had a</strong> sacred <strong>name</strong> of God <strong>written on his skin he may neither wash</strong> it in water lest it be erased, <strong>nor may he smear</strong> it with oil, <strong>nor may he stand in a place of filth</strong> because it is disrespectful of God's name. <strong>If an immersion of mitzvah happened to</strong> present itself, <strong>he wraps a reed over</strong> God's name <strong>and</strong> then <strong>descends and immerses</strong>. <strong>Rabbi Yosei says: Actually, he descends and immerses in his</strong> usual <strong>manner</strong>, even if it is not an immersion of mitzva, <strong>provided that he does not rub</strong> the spot and erase the name. Apparently, Rabbi Yosei's opinion is more lenient than that of the Sages with regard to indirectly causing a prohibited outcome. \n  (Koren Talmud Bavli Steinsaltz translation - bolded words are the translated Hebrew text).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The law, as the Rambam in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39979&st=&pgnum=33\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yesodei HaTorah 6:6</a> records, is according to the Sages: that the person must wrap a reed around the name because one may not be naked before God's name. This is the starting point for a Jew who already has such a tattoo.  </p>\n\n<p>I don't know the halachot of a Gentile. What came to mind is the Rambam on cursing God's name (Melachim 9:3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בן נח שבירך את השם. בין שבירך בשם המיוחד. בין שבירך בכינוי בכל לשון חייב. מה שאין כן בישראל</p>\n  \n  <p>A gentile who curses God's Name, whether he uses God's unique name or\n  one of His other names, in any language, is liable. This law does not\n  apply with regard to Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't know if a tattoo would be like cursing (desecration?), and this needs more research.</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>It has been suggested that perhaps a needle inserting dots (i.e., a tattoo) would not constitute writing and so perhaps permissible to remove. To argue against this, I refer to the <em>Keset Hasofer</em>, arguably the most authoritative legal code regarding the laws of safrut, written by R. Ganzfried (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch). In the chapter forbidding erasure of the tetragrammaton (11:2), <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41270&st=&pgnum=47\" rel=\"noreferrer\">he writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even a name that was written by accident, that was written in a place where it shouldn't have been, or even if it wasn't written for a holy purpose, or even if it was formed through chok tochot [carving out a letter from a block of ink] and wasn't written for tefillin or a mezuzah, and even if it wasn't written in the <em>Ashurit</em> script but rather in a foreign script, and even if it was formed through sewing or weaving or with various colors: <strong>No matter how the Name was made, on anything or anywhere -- anything that was made with the intention that it is the Name</strong>, that he who wrote it or made knew that it was the Name of the Blessed Holy One - anyone who spoils one letter from it transgresses a prohibition and deserves lashes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, even if the letters of the Holy Name were comprised of connected dots made from a needle, since it was made knowing that it was the Name, it cannot be removed. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/14-21%20Permanent%20and%20Semi-Permanent%20Makeup%20-%20Cosmetic%20Tattooing%203.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Rav Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron (Techumin 22:387)...recommends removing the tattoo to avoid the constant reminder of an earlier sin.

    "content": "# Listening to Music during learning\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there any \"chisaran\" (is there something \"lacking\") in one's fulfillment of the Mitzvah of Talmud Torah if they listen to soft, slow paced, instrumental music (no vocals or lyrics) while learning in order to focus better or drown out background noise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The best way to learn Torah is <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/142436/jewish/Eternalize-Your-Mind.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">aloud</a>. That means that we should be listening to our learning. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder whether you can learn aloud if there is background music. In my experience background music is useful if you are studying quietly. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>The question of whether listening to instrumental music while learning Torah introduces any \"chisaran\" (deficiency) in one's fulfillment of the mitzvah of Talmud Torah depends on several factors, and it is worth exploring the issue from both halachic and hashkafic (philosophical) perspectives.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>1. <strong>The Purpose and Nature of Talmud Torah</strong></h3>\n<p>The mitzvah of Talmud Torah involves engaging one's mind and focus in learning Torah, which is a deeply intellectual and spiritual activity. The primary goal is to connect with Hashem's wisdom, understand His Torah, and internalize its teachings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus and Kavanah (Intention):</strong> A fundamental aspect of Talmud Torah is studying with concentration and proper intention. Anything that enhances focus and helps one better connect with the Torah may not inherently detract from the mitzvah.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>2. <strong>Music as a Tool for Concentration</strong></h3>\n<p>If instrumental music helps you concentrate by blocking out distracting noise or creating a calm environment conducive to learning, it may be seen as a practical aid rather than a hindrance. This is particularly true if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The music is purely instrumental (no vocals or lyrics).</li>\n<li>The volume is low and non-intrusive.</li>\n<li>It genuinely enhances focus rather than serving as a distraction.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>3. <strong>Halachic Considerations</strong></h3>\n<p>There is no explicit halacha that prohibits listening to instrumental music while learning Torah. However, some considerations might arise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Distraction:</strong> If the music becomes a distraction or occupies one's mind to the point that it diminishes the quality or depth of learning, this could be seen as a chisaran.</li>\n<li><strong>Simcha Shel Torah:</strong> Some sources emphasize that Torah learning itself should be a source of joy and fulfillment (simcha shel Torah). If one relies on external stimuli like music for joy during learning, it might suggest a deficiency in one's relationship with Torah.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>4. <strong>Hashkafic and Ethical Considerations</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Personal Needs and Adaptations:</strong> Everyone learns differently. If music genuinely helps a person focus and engage with Torah more effectively, it may be considered a reasonable adaptation to their needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Elevating the Experience:</strong> Some argue that listening to music with an appropriate tone and tempo can elevate the learning experience, as long as it aligns with the seriousness and sanctity of Torah study.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>5. <strong>Customs and Perspectives</strong></h3>\n<p>Different communities and individuals have varying approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some may be stringent and prefer to avoid any external distractions during learning, viewing Torah study as a sacred activity that should stand alone.</li>\n<li>Others may adopt a more lenient approach, especially in cases where music clearly enhances concentration or blocks out disruptive background noise.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>6. <strong>Practical Advice</strong></h3>\n<p>To avoid any potential chisaran in the mitzvah:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure the music is a tool, not the focus. It should fade into the background and not compete for attention.</li>\n<li>Regularly evaluate whether the music genuinely helps your learning or if it risks becoming a crutch or distraction.</li>\n<li>Consider consulting a trusted Rav or mentor, especially if you feel conflicted about the practice.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Listening to soft, slow-paced instrumental music while learning Torah is generally not considered a chisaran if it enhances focus and drowns out distractions. However, one must ensure that it serves as a tool for concentration rather than a competing influence, and the sanctity and seriousness of Talmud Torah should remain central.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a convert become a synagogue president? Why or why not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I understand that the National Council of Young Israel has a rule that women and converts may not be elected president of a Young Israel synagogue.  I think I saw a gemara -- or a comment to a gemara -- in Shabbos that said as much.  What are the sources, pro and con, for the position that converts should not be shul presidents?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I can simply tell you that it is commonly done ... though there is discussion about it ... just as RIETS admits converts to its rabbinical school. (Ask me who's more likely to \"rule with an iron fist\", the rabbi or synagogue president ... )</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Sanhedrin implies a Ger shouldn't stand in judgement over a native-born Jew (which doesn't sit well with me, but what do I know) ... similarly, if we derive guidelines for all positions of \"dominating authority\" (<em>serara</em>) from the Torah's laws for monarchs (as Rambam seems to do; while it doesn't appear in the Talmud it is in the <em>Sifrei</em>, Rambam isn't making it up himself based on his antique-Islamic-era sensibilities, as one blogger suggested), then <em>serara</em> would be limited to male, native-born Jews. To what extent we follow this position today, and what positions are called \"dominating authority\", are big questions. I recall Rabbi JD Bleich had a piece years ago in Tradition about female synagogue presidents, where I think he discussed [male] converts as well. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff reports an oral discussion with his mentor, Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik, in which Rabbi Soloveichik was uncomfortable with having female synagogue presidents out of modesty concerns; he felt the \"dominating authority\" argument was stretched quite thin in this context as the synagogue president gets stepped on by everyone! (But in a recent discussion on female presidents, Rabbi Mordechai Willig observed that the president's power can vary drastically between congregations.) If so I presume a male convert would pose no problem. (Well everyone who screams at and walks all over the shul president would be getting an extra sin of offending a convert, but what can we do ...)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Young Israel's position is based on a pasuk (verse) in Deuteronomy 17:15, as interpreted in the Gemara, and codified as law by Rambam (Maimonedes).  I will provide these sources and the opposing position.</p>\n\n<p>Devarim (Deuteronomy) 17:15 states: \"Then you shall appoint a king over you, whom the Lord your G-d will choose: <strong>one from among your brethren</strong> shall you set as king over you, but you shall <strong>not set over you a stranger</strong> who is <strong>not your brother</strong>.\" Notice that the verse has some redundencies.  If the rule is only that we cannot appoint a gentile king to rule over us, then the first highlighted phrase should be enough. Sifri, Shoftim, ¶ 157.  The Midrash HaGadol brings down that the second highlighted phrase comes to exclude a convert.  </p>\n\n<p>The third redundant statement appears (although I haven't found a source exactly on point) to enlarge the halacha from not just from excluding gentiles and converts from being kings, but also from being communal leaders.  Whether the rabbis learned it from the third redundancy or not, Kiddushin 76b states: \"We have learned: 'Then you shall appoint a king over you from among your brethren,' all appointments of authority that you make should not be [made] except from among your brethren.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rambam in Hilchos Melachim 1:4 similarly states: \"We do not appoint a king from amongst the converts, even after several generations, until his mother is [one born] Jewish, as it is written, 'You will not set over you a stranger who is not your brother.' Not only for kingship, but also for any position of authority in Israel, neither a general nor chief over fifty people, nor chief over ten people, nor even a person appointed to verify that the water is distributed to the fields. It is superfluous to talk about a judge or a nasi, who may not be other than [one born] a Jew, as is written, 'one from among your brethren shall you set as king over you'--all the people whom you give positions of authority shall not be from other than your brethren.\"</p>\n\n<p>With respect to whether a convert can sit on a beis din to judge his fellow Jews, there is disagreement.  Rashi, in his commentary to Shabbos 102a, says a convert is allowed to judge a Jew on property matters, but not concerning capital laws (see also on Kiddushin 76b, s.v. kol mesimos.)  However, numerous commentators caused Rambam to conclude, in Hilchos Sanhendrin 2:9 that \"[a] Beit Din of three [judges], one of them being a convert, is disqualified until his mother is [one born] Jewish.\"  C.f.  Rif at the end of chapter 4 of Sanhedrin; Tosaphot to Yevamos 45b s.v. keivan and to Sanhedrin 36b s.v. chada; Nimukei Yosef at the beginning of chapter 12 of Yevamos; and the Ran on the Rif, end of chapter 4 of Sanhedrin.  A convert can judge a fellow convert, however.  E.g. Yevamos 102; Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah Hilchot Gerim Siman 269 si'if 11.</p>\n\n<p>The key word in the analysis is \"position of authority\" or in Hebrew \"serara.\"  On this point, some argue that this is a weakness in Young Israel's position.  Some cite Rav Moshe Feinstein's position that a convert can be a rosh yeshiva or a mashgiach ruchani of a yeshiva.  In Iggros Moshe 4:26, he states \"... it seems, that these are not considered authority positions in our times, that it triggers a situation of sererah, since in essence the purpose of a yeshiva is to teach to the students that which they want. And that which there is power to the leaders and the Roshei Yeshiva over the students to throw them out or to not receive them originally and similar, this is only like the authority of the master of a house over his workers, and there is not in this any matter of appointing to authority\n[minui l'serarah] at all....\"  Rav Feinstein's position in this case, I think, is not directly applicable to that of a shul president. In other cases where he discussed \"serara,\" with respect to a (non-convert) rabbi of a shul and the head of a kashrut-certifying organization, he held that the rabbi position is a position of honor and not one of control, whereas the kashrut position was one of authority since he could overrule the business owner.  Compare Id. and Iggros Moshe, Choshen Mishpat, 2:34.</p>\n\n<p>Where Young Israel's position is weakest is the introduction of two factors.  One is the halacha to love the convert (Deut. 10:19) which, Rav Moshe notes \"obligates us\nto draw them close and to be lenient in all these matters.\"  Second is a point raised in the Tzitz Eliezer 19:47 to the extent that, if the litigants concented to have a convert as a judge, then the prohibition is waived.  If that is true, then community acceptance of converts, or particular converts, could also waive the prohibition against converts being president, a position that the Tzitz Eliezer adopts in the next ruling, 19:48, in the case of a convert becoming a shul gabbai.</p>\n\n<p>I've been a shul gabbai.  It is a position with neither honor nor power.  One may argue that this is even more true of a shul president.  Perhaps.  But since first learning the halacha that a convert can't be a leader of a group of Jews, I have been quite machmir in applying that halacha to the position of shul presidency.  So far, it has (bli ayin hara) kept me from being elected to that position, and I don't want to see a reversal in the Young Israel position (I go to a YI shul).  </p>\n\n\n",

Also, even though Elijah was leaving behind his protégé Elisha, nevertheless, prophecy would certainly be lessened by his parting. This was especially true since Jezebel had recently killed many prophets.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, G-d commanded Elijah to visit the two remaining groups of prophets on the day that he was to die, fifty in Beis El and fifty in Jericho, in order to elevate them spiritually with his own specially elevated level of holiness.</p>\n\n<p>He was then to proceed to the other side of the Jordan where he was to ascend to heaven together with his body.

Although the exact particulars of to apply this din will depend on individual circumstance (and from the Taz there #4 it appears that this might be limited to the case of chametz). But here too, the question is about benefiting from work done on Shabbos, which is also a rabbinic \"fine\" like benefiting from chametz.</p>\n\n<p>The Sheilas David OH #5 writes that lifnei iver only applies to regular Jews or sinning Jews who might do tshuva, but not to a mumar (apostate Jew) who has no expectation of doing tshuva. For such a person, in a case of an issur d'rabanan, he writes that we can rely on the view that there is no problem of lifnei iver, because there never was a gezera of \"aiding sinners\" for such an apostate.</p>\n\n<p>(Layman's summary: One cannot benefit from leavened food that was owned by a Jew during Passover. But according to some authorities, if the Jew in question was an apostate, then one can benefit from that leavened food. The reason is that the prohibition on benefiting was established as a fine to prevent people from sinning and keeping their leavened food, but an apostate is already sinning anyway, so the fine was never applied to such a person, and thus others can benefit from leavened food owned by the apostate. Extending this rule about Passover to other cases is not a simple matter, but may be possible)</p>\n\n\n",

Generally the rule of thumb is that you make the most specific Berachah that you know will capture the essence of that food.  For example, if you aren't sure whether a particular fruit you want to eat is a \"tree\" fruit or a \"ground\" fruit, you would make a Borei Peri HaAdamah, which is generally said on \"earth\" fruit, since, even if the fruit is a \"tree\" fruit, the tree grew from the earth.  You wouldn't force a Borei Peri Ha'Etz, which is said on \"tree\" fruit, because if you did you would be at risk of making a Berachah that doesn't apply to the fruit, which would leave you eating a food without having given proper thanks.  You also wouldn't necessarily automatically say SheHaKol NiHyeh BiDvaro, which is said on all foods that don't fit in a more focused category (such as most drinks), because you know that this fruit is, at least, a fruit that grew from the earth.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, if a fruit, even a \"tree\" fruit, is cooked or ground (as in reduced/pulverized), it loses its \"fruit\" status altogether and falls into the catch-all category whose Berachah is SheHaKol.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, generally speaking, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/30063/5\">some say</a> you ought to make a Berachah on a solid food before a liquid beverage.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>What if:</strong> you are about to eat a fruit, that is definitely a fruit, but it's somewhat ground up and you just aren't sure whether it retains its fruit status or has lost that status, and you intend to make a SheHaKol on that food just to be safe.  You also have a cup of tea or coffee that you intend to drink.  This drink <em>definitely</em> gets a SheHaKol.  But now if you make a SheHaKol on the food, will that exempt the drink?

Therefore, he writes, one should have specific intention that the <em>b'racha</em> cover the doubtful food:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואני מסופק בפרי האדמה ודבר שיש בה ספק לפניו ובירך פרי האדמה בסתמא, אם פוטר הספק, דשמא דינו פרי העץ ובעי כוונה, או דילמא הואיל וספק הוה פרי האדמה ואין צריך כוונה, כי הוה כמו ברכותיהן שוות. על כן יזהר כהאי גוונא לכוין בפירוש</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elsewhere, the <em>P'ri M'gadim</em> rules that one need not prioritize a <em>b'racha</em> on solid food over a <em>b'racha</em> on a drink (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1111\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mishb'tzos Zahav</em> 211:6</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואכילה לשתיה אין בו קדימה אם ברכותיהן שוות רק בחביב ורוצה עתה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, according to the <em>P'ri M'gadim</em>, it would be acceptable to recite a <em>shehakol</em> on the coffee or tea with the intent that the <em>b'racha</em> cover the food as well.</p>\n<h2>Blessing on doubtful food exempting food with a known blessing</h2>\n<p>R' Ben Tzion Abba Shaul (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19979&st=&pgnum=141\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Or L'tziyon</em> 2:14:15</a>) writes that if someone recited a more general <em>b'racha</em> on a food that should have a more specific <em>b'racha</em>, the general <em>b'racha</em> that was recited exempts other foods that require that general <em>b'racha</em> (subject to the person having intent to cover those other foods when he recited the <em>b'racha</em>). For example, if someone recited <em>ha'adama</em> on a pear and intended to also eat a potato, his <em>b'racha</em> covers both foods:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם טעה ובירך בורא פרי האדמה משום שחשב שפרי זה ברכתו בורא פרי האדמה, יכול לאכול שאר פירות האדמה שבדעתו היה לאוכלם כעת, אבל שאר פירות העץ לא יאכל בלא ברכה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Note: This only applies if the <em>b'racha</em> was made intentionally; if <em>ha'adama</em> was recited due to a slip of the tongue, and the person meant to recite <em>ha'eitz</em>, he may eat other <em>ha'eitz</em> fruits that he had been planning on eating, but \"it is better that he not eat <em>ha'adama</em> vegetables unless he first exempts them with a blessing on a <em>ha'adama</em> food he did not originally intend to eat.\")</p>\n<p>בנידון דידן : In terms of whether a <em>shehakol</em> on the doubtful food would cover a drink like coffee, if the food is clearly solid, you would require specific intent anyway for the <em>b'racha</em> to cover the coffee since the items are two distinct types (שני מינים מחולקים). It seems to me that this would be sufficient to cover both items even though the appropriate <em>b'racha</em> on the food is doubtful, a fortiori since there is reason to permit reciting <em>shehakol l'chatchila</em>.</p>\n<p>(Consider, for example, the case of a banana, about which the proper <em>beracha</em> is doubtful.

I know this has something to do with the laws of Shabbat, and possibly something to do with unintended consequences that are allowed, but what exactly is it, and in what kinds of situations is it applicable?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Psik Reishei refers to an inevitable consequence of an action. Literally \"cutting off its head\", the original example (see Rambam Shabbos 1:6) is someone who wants to give his child a chicken head to play with on Shabbos (don't ask, I guess they did those things back then). The problem is killing a chicken on Shabbos is forbidden. </p>\n\n<p>Now, on Shabbos it is sometimes permitted to do an action that <em>might</em> have a forbidden consequence, if it is not one's intent to cause the forbidden consequence. This is not the case with psik reishei. If you cut off the chicken's head, the unintended consequence (the chicken's death) is inevitable, and so - forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of psik reishei that I've heard include dragging a very heavy object through dirt (guaranteed to cause a groove in the ground = plowing). A lighter object would not be psik reishei since it's not certain that it will create a groove. (Magen Avraham to OC 337:1)</p>\n\n<p>In a case where the inevitable consequence is an undesired one, it is called psik reishei d'lo nicha leih:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[O]n Shabbos, where the resulting consequence is neither wanted nor intended, it is classified as a psik reisha d’lo nicha leih, which is permitted by Torah law but prohibited by Rabbinic law. -<a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/kosher-appliances/476/oven-kashrus-for-shabbos-use/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Star-K.org</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Jewish interpretations of the Psalm identify the individual in the Psalm with a royal figure, alternatively interpreted as King David, King Hezekiah, or Queen Esther.\" She discusses several early Jewish and Christian sources, including the ones cited above: </p>\n\n<p>Megillah 15b (her translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>And stood in the inner court of the king’s house</em> (Esther 5:1). R. Levi said: When she reached the chamber of the idols,the Divine Presence left her. She said, <em>My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?</em> (Ps. 22:2). Is it possible that You punish the inadvertent sin like the presumptuous one, or one done under compulsion like one committed willingly? Or is it because I called [Ahasuerus] “dog,” as it says <em>Save my soul from the sword, my only one from the power of the dog?</em> (Ps. 22:21). She immediately retracted and called him “lion,” as it says, <em>Save me from the lion’s mouth</em> (Ps. 22:22).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She discusses many others, including Midrash Tehillim and its interpretation of this psalm as referring to David's life as a shepherd (which is too lengthy to type out here but you can read it in Esther Menn's article <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=RnlzffenyEQC&pg=PA78&dq=midrash+tehillim+psalm+22\">here</a>), as well as how this psalm is (mis)translated and utilized in the Christian tradition.

But according to Christian philosophy, Jesus wanted to go down to earth in flesh and blood in order to save all the sinners from hell through his death. If he really wanted to die in order to atone for mankind, why was he crying out why G-d abandoned him? Would he really say \"I will call out but I am not answered\" if <em>he didn't want or intend to be answered</em>? Furthermore, he refers to \"our fathers\" (v. 5) — but Christians claim he is the son of G-d, and if so how could he have multiple fathers? Would a representation of G-d on earth call himself a \"worm\" (v. 7; read תולעת for תועלת in the book)? How can he refer to his brothers (v. 23) if an only son of G-d has no brothers? Why does he praise the descendants of Ya'akov and Yisra'el for <em>honoring</em> G-d (v. 24) if they were the ones killing him, the son of G-d?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bdld.info/2013/01/31/kimhi-on-christianity/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This blog post</a> quotes the Radak as challenging the Christian interpretations in pretty much the same words.

Ovadia Yosef's permissive attitude. In Yalkut Yosef Yoreh Deah 89:65-66, it is written:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם אוכלים באמצעות כלים ולא באופן ישיר על השלחן, אין הדבר מעכב ליתן מפה על השלחן, ואפשר לאכול על אותו שלחן מאכלי בשר, ובערב מאכלי חלב בלי מפה, [לאחר שינקו את השלחן משיירי המאכל]. ויש שנהגו להחמיר בכל אופן, לייחד מפה למאכלי בשר, ומפה למאכלי חלב, שחוששין שמא נשארו על המפה שיורי בשר, ואחר כך כשיעמיד שם לחם וגבינה ושאר מאכלי חלב, ידבקו זה בזה, ויאכל בשר וחלב בבת אחת. ואמנם מעיקר הדין אם אוכלים את הבשר ואת הגבינה בתוך צלחות, ולא על השלחן ממש, אין איסור לאכול על אותה מפה, ודי להסיר את הפתיתים.</p>\n  \n  <p>מפה שעוונית או ניילון שעל ידי ניגוב היטב יוצא כל הלכלוך הדבוק בה, יש להקל לאכול עליה בשר אחר גבינה, וכן להיפך לאחר המתנת שש שעות, אפילו אם המאכלים עצמם מונחים על המפה [ולאו דוקא שמונחים בצלחות], ובלבד שינקה היטב את המפה במטלית לחה להסיר את כל הנדבק, ואחר כך ינגב במטלית יבשה. וכל שכן אם אוכל באמצעות צלחות. ובשבת ויום טוב יש ליזהר שלא לנגב בחוזק במטלית לחה. ומפה שאפשר להשתמש בה בשני צדדים, וניכר הבדל בין הצדדים כדי שלא יתחלף, מותר להשתמש בה לבשר ולחלב. </p>\n  \n  <p>If you eat using dishes, and not directly on the table, then there is no need to place a tablecloth on the table, and you can eat meat directly on the table and then dairy foods in the evening without a tablecloth [after cleaning the table of leftover food]. There are those who are stringent in any case and separate meat tablecloths from dairy tablecloths out of concern  that residual meat will remain and later, when they place bread and cheese and other dairy products [on the tablecloth], they will get stuck to each other and the person will eat meat together with dairy. But actually, the letter of the law is that if you eat meat and cheese inside plates, and not on the actual table, <strong>there is no prohibition to eat on the same tablecloth.</strong> It is enough to remove the crumbs off.  </p>\n  \n  <p>If an oilcloth or nylon tablecloth was wiped off well, clearing any\n  filth stuck to it, there is room to permit eating meat after cheese on\n  it and vice-versa (after waiting six hours). Even if the foods\n  themselves are resting on the tablecloth [and not actually on the\n  plates], as long as the tablecloth was well cleaned with a damp cloth\n  to remove anything that got stuck and then wiped with a dry cloth [it\n  is permissible]. And all the more so, if one is eating using plates.\n  On Shabbat and Yom Tov one must be careful not to wipe strongly with a\n  damp cloth. If a tablecloth can be used on both its sides and you\n  recognize the difference between the sides, in order to not have to\n  switch tablecloths, it is permissible to use it for meat and dairy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Badei Hashulchan (87:102) brings an opinion (the Radbaz, quoted by Pishchey Teshuva - brought in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/25618/1535\">Aryeh's answer</a>) that if one eats on plates he may use the same tablecloth for meat and milk. However, he notes that others argue (the Minchas Yaakov based on a Bach) and forbid using the same tablecloth for meat and milk even if he uses plates.

If they \"revert\" to something other than Judaism, they may be sinning, but that is between them and G-d now. </p>\n\n<p>As far as punishment, they are no different than any other Jew. That is to say, Jewish courts today no longer have the power to punish people for sins against G-d.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/23547/5\">HodofHod mentioned</a>, once a person converts to Judaism, mentally and bodily, the conversion is full and effective spiritually and legally (meaning within Jewish law).</p>\n\n<p>Aside from a few cases of very strict rabbinic interpretations of what is considered a \"full and effective\" conversion (and attempts, thereby, to retroactively invalidate a person's conversion), and different standards among different denominations, nobody disputes that once someone has effectively converted they remain Jewish, in the eyes of Jewish law, forever.</p>\n\n<p>Just to add to that answer and clarify/expand a bit, there is no specific sin against \"reverting\", because no such thing is recognized.  However, any time a convert engages in any act that is forbidden to Jews, the convert is sinning <em>as a Jew</em> by not upholding the commandments in the Torah - not because the convert has \"reverted\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Three details that weren't addressed by the other (well-written) answers:</p>\n\n<p>1) The Talmud in Kesubos 11a says that a child who converts has the ability to turn back at the time of their coming of age</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב יוסף הגדילו יכולין למחות</p>\n  \n  <p>When they grow up, they may protest [their conversion].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is age 13 for a boy, and 12 for a girl, although see the Tosefos HaRi\"D there who says that it is even earlier than that. The Chasam Sofer also entertains that it would be an earlier age.</p>\n\n<p>Such a convert may change their mind on their conversion at that point.</p>\n\n<p>Many commentaries assume this to mean that the conversion of a child is not a done deal until such point, not that they are a full-fledged Jew who can change their mind.  However, Tosefos in Sanhedrin 68b s.v. קטן אי אתה צריך לחזור implies that he/she is a full-fledged Jew who becomes not a Jew at the point of their refusal.</p>\n\n<p>2) If a non-Jew converts without having been properly vetted by a valid Jewish court to determine his/her sincerity, there are opinions that say that even though we do not disregard their conversion, we treat them as a questionable convert until their pure intentions have been made clear (see Responsa Achiezer 3:26:3 - חיישינן לחומרא עד שתתברר צדקתו), as the validity of their acceptance of Mitzvos is questionable (I assume this means that we would treat them as a non-Jew as far as counting them for Minyan or marrying a Jew and the like). Your question gave the case of \"tomorrow they return back\" - the very next day. That would presumably be sufficient reason to doubt the sincerity of their acceptance, and if they had not been vetted by a Rabbinical court, it would cast doubt upon the validity of their conversion.</p>\n\n<p>3) As far as the source of the statements of the other answers, it is the Talmud in Yevamos 47b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טבל ועלה - הרי הוא כישראל לכל דבריו.\n  למאי הלכתא דאי הדר ביה ומקדש בת ישראל ישראל מומר קרינא ביה וקידושיו קידושין</p>\n  \n  <p>Once he immerses and comes up, he is a Yisrael for all purposes.  What Halacha does this come to tell us?  That if he reverts [to his old ways] and then marries a Jewess, he is a rebellious Jew, and the marriage is binding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It had four questions on it, and, on the reverse side, their answers. One question was (if I recall the wording precisely):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Who was the strongest person in the Bible?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer given was <em>Shimshon</em>.</p>\n\n<p>He is, of course, described as strong (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/T0714\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Shof'tim</em> 14</a>–16).

Do we have any tradition, or is there any evidence, as to who was strongest?</p>\n\n<p>(I assume physical strength was meant by the game manufacturer: at any rate, that's what I'm referring to. Not, for example, strength of character.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p><strong>Concerning Og</strong>, see <a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/midrashraba/hukat.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers Raba Hukat</a> 32: <em>... that no strong one in the world arose that that was more fierce than he</em>, (קשה הימנו‏)<em>... And he remained from the mighty ones who were killed by Amrafel and his friends, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0114.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen 14</a>)... And he was a husk of them, like peels of olives in the olive waste.</em></p>\n\n<p>So from this saying, it would seem that <strong>Og</strong> was the strongest, and even he was put to shame by the mighty <strong>Refaim</strong> he hailed from.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another</strong> instance can bee seen in <a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/tanhuma/matot.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanhuma Mattos</a> 5: <em>Two strong ones arose in the world. Samson from Israel and Goliath from the nations of the world. And both of them were lost from the world, etc... Why? Because their gift was not from Gd, rather they seized it for themselves.</em></p>\n\n<p>Notice that the 'And' separates the two statements. In other words, the midrash is not saying that \"there were two strong people who were lost from the world\", It is saying \"(1) There were two strong people in the world, AND (2) both of them were lost from the world.\"</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that either <strong>Samsom</strong> or <strong>Goliath</strong> was the strongest person from this saying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To offer a resolution of these conflicting Midrashim</strong>, perhaps <em>all</em> of the above mentioned were \"the strongest\" at one point in time. The <em>Refaim</em> were the strongest until they were killed in Abraham's time. Then <em>Og</em> took the title until Moses killed him. Then <em>Samson</em> was strongest, until he sacrificed himself to destroy the Philistines. Finally, <em>Goliath</em> was strongest until he was killed by David.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In any event</strong>, one can see that referring to someone as <em>\"the strongest\"</em> in rabbinic sayings is not meant in an absolute sense. Even if you reject my understanding of Samson and Goliath, you must accept the very plain inferiority given to Og as opposed to the Refaim, alongside Og's being called <em>\"the strongest\"</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I think that as far as finding an absolute winner goes, at best we have specific anecdotes to examine.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using the above premise, <strong>Samson seems to be the winner thus far</strong>. See <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/sotah/sotah_9.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 9a</a>, where Rav Asi says that He uprooted the two great mountains, Tzorah and Eshta'ol and ground them together. Even Og only lifted one mountain, as seen on <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=brachos&daf=54b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 54b</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/midrashraba/vayechi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis Rabah Vayehi</a> 99:11, is also worth mentioning, though it may be less conclusive. It quotes Dan's blessing in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0149.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 49</a>:16, <em>...like one of the tribes of Israel, like the One of the world. Just as the One of the world needs no aid in war, so did Samson who arose from Dan need no others to help him, without a sword, rather with a donkey's jawbone</em>. </p>\n\n<p>So Samson essentially founded the term 'one man army', requiring neither outside assistance, nor sufficient arms to defeat overwhelming odds.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The gemarah in <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/sotah/sotah_10.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sotah 10a</a> describes Shimshon's strength as was in the likeness of God, so I would go with that.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>He fulfilled the verse in the torah \"one of you will destroy 1000\" (Joshua 23:10) when he slew 1000 plishtim in one battle</p>\n\n<p>no one else in the tanach was able to do this.even the elite of David as mentioned in Shmuel II 23, only managed to reach 800 plishtim in one battle</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Kissing the hand to catch a cold?",
    "content": "# Kissing the hand to catch a cold?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a popular custom in Israel to shake a person's hand and then kiss your own. In every single Sephardic and Mizrachi synagogue I've ever been to in the country this is the standard way of greeting (which looks related to touching the sefer Torah with your hand or tallit and then kissing said hand/tallit). Obviously, this custom precedes modern hygienic education.</p>\n\n<p>Last Shabbat I was in a troubling situation. The rabbi was complaining of being sick and kept coughing throughout the morning service. When he comes to greet me, he naturally extended his hand. After he shook my hand, he kissed his own and looked at me. At this point I wasn't sure what was the correct approach:</p>\n\n<p>Should I follow the custom of shaking hands and kissing mine -- with the risk of infecting myself with his germs? Or should I have made an excuse to avoid the potential cold -- thereby potentially embarrassing him? </p>\n\n<p>Health vs. Embarrassment?</p>\n\n<p>Of course, sources are always rosy. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>We learn from Tamar's refusal to identify Yehudah outright that it would be better for a person to be exposed to a fiery furnace than for him to humiliate someone else in public: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=10b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sotah 10b</a>; </p>\n\n<p>Getting a cold is less of a problem than a fiery furnace so the first answer is to kiss your hand and hope avoiding embarrassing the Rav is a merit for you to avoid infection.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could have tried some innovative ruse to avoid shaking hands. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>My advice (which is practical, rather than halakhic) is to not shake his hand if it is obvious that he is unwell. The fact that he is coughing and sneezing means that it is obvious to him too, and he shouldn't have extended his hand in the first place. Now that he has, the only way to save face is to decline shaking it on the grounds that <i>you</i> have a cold. Just apologise and tell him that you're not well.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all, nowadays it is obvious that colds (and many other sicknesses) are transferred by shaking one's hand with someone who is sick and then kissing the hand. This fact is almost universally known (especially in places like Israel and the U.S.).</p>\n\n<p>It is far from clear that the rabbi would be embarrassed, considering that it was obvious to the congregants that he was sick (since he was coughing through the Shabbat tefillot). It is also common that people wish to avoid getting sick by shaking hands with someone who is sick. It is the rabbi's responsibility to avoid behaviors that can cause others to become sick as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Further, perhaps you should explain that you are not shaking his hand because you don't want to risk catching a cold and then wish him to feel better (<em>Shabbat hee miliz'ok</em>), and/or make a kissing motion towards your hand but don't actually make contact. </p>\n\n<p>Remember, <em>hakol biydei shamayim chutz mitzinim upachim</em> (Kes. 30a). See Tosafos there who point out that people catch colds/flu out of negligence. Further, if you catch a cold you could potentially expose other people, causing them damage (and you should probably avoid shaking other hands subsequently for the same reason).</p>\n\n<p>The Tosafot and Shevut Ya'akov say that public humiliation is not literally tantamount to murder and the implication from that would be that the gemara in Sotah 10b, according to these opinions, should not be taken literally <a href=\"http://koltorah.org/ravj/13-17%20Emotional%20Homicide%20-%20Part%201.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kol Torah - Rabbi Jachter</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, nevertheless, if it is possible, a person should avoid embarrassing someone, all the more so in public, a person should avoid it. However, it should be done in a way that avoids causing others harm.</p>\n\n<p>Especially now with the cold (and the flu) going around. If one, due to carelessness, causes others to get sick, it would cause those other people tza'ar and to lose valuable time due to their sickness. If the sickness that is spread is more harmful to one's health (e.g., causing an elderly or weak person to catch the flu, pneumonia, etc.), it can put other people's lives at risk, possibly all because of the carelessness of one individual - a clear instance of pikuach nefesh. People have an obligation to avoid being negligent and causing damage to other people.</p>\n\n<p>To reiterate, a person should try to be sensitive to other people's feelings when they take necessary measures to avoid spreading disease (as described in the third paragraph).</p>\n\n<p>I would recommend speaking to the rabbi in private afterwards and explain to him that it is important that he avoid behaviors (including as you noted in your question) that can cause others to become sick (as it is a type of harm) and that he, as the rav, inform congregants that they should act in kind.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps he will take a\n  fancy to my mother.” So he went ahead of her, <strong>stretching his height\n  to conceal her</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is:</p>\n\n<p>Being that Yosef was a <strong>6 year old boy</strong> at the time (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/showrashi/true/aid/8225/jewish/Chapter-30.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bershit 30:25</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/showrashi/true/aid/8226/jewish/Chapter-31.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">31:41</a> ) how could he conceal Rachel?</p>\n\n<p>Was he really tall? Was Rachel short?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I have no source for this answer, and I may very well be wrong, but here goes anyway:</p>\n\n<p>Look at the expression Rashi brings: \"<strong>ושרבב</strong> קומתו\"</p>\n\n<p>Now this word \"ושרבב\" rang a bell to me. Where is it used in other places?</p>\n\n<p>1) Regarding the daughter of Pharoh who stretched out her hand - <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9863/showrashi/true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi on Shemot 2:5</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והם דרשו את אמתה את ידה, <strong>שנשתרבבה</strong> אמתה אמות הרבה:</p>\n  \n  <p>They, however, interpreted אֶתאֲמָתָהּ to mean her hand, [that she\n  stretched out her hand,] and <strong>her arm grew</strong> many cubits (אַמוֹת) [so\n  that she could reach the basket].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>2) Regarding the punishment of the 10 spies - <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9942/showrashi/true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi on Bamidbar 14:37</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באותה מיתה ההגונה להם מדה כנגד מדה. הם חטאו בלשון, <strong>ונשתרבב</strong> לשונם עד\n  טבורם </p>\n  \n  <p>Through that death which was fitting for them-measure for measure;\n  they had sinned with the tongue and now [in retribution] their tongues\n  <strong>extended</strong> to their navels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems to me that the word \"שרבב\" denotes growing/extending.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if we take the incident of the daughter of Pharoh:</p>\n\n<p>We see that when someone has a good intention about something - even though it may be physically impossible - you should do your bit, and if Hashem Wills - He will cause you to succeed (via a miracle say)....</p>\n\n<p>So too I could say about Yosef - Hashem make a miracle - and he grew tall to hide his mother from Eisav.</p>\n\n<p>(again, no source, but I think it's a good pshat)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It occurs to me that Esau would have wanted to know where Rachel was had he not seen her at all, since the rumor at the time was Yaacov was the intended of Rachel he knew she existed. Secondly, why did Rachel bow at all if she was hidden from site. </p>\n\n<p>Based on that perhaps he only hid her main  figure and did not totally cover her but it was enough to stop Esau from enjoying the beauty.</p>\n\n\n",

Are there more?</p>\n\n<p>From a scholarly perspective, the increased use of the participle in place of the narrative waw-consecutive imperfect (wayiqtol) form is a classic feature of Late Biblical Hebrew (LBH). </p>\n\n<p>To unpack that a bit... What Modern Hebrew treats as the \"present tense\" (words like <em>molekh</em>, <em>yoshev</em>, <em>maggedeth</em>) are in Biblical Hebrew technically (present) participles. That's why they behave like nouns as well as verbs: they have only singular/plural, like nouns (and not like verbs, which have first/second/third person), and they can take the definite article (like the first example you gave: <em>hammolekh</em>, \"the ruling one\" or \"the one who rules\").</p>\n\n<p>\"Normally\", in classical Biblical Hebrew, when you're telling a story you use a narrative verb with something called the waw-consecutive. That means the verbs all have a waw (vav) which shows that they are consecutive actions: they follow one after the other. So for example, ויאכל וישת ויקם וילך, <em>wayyo'khal wayyesht wayyaqom wayyelekh</em> means: \"He ate, then he drank, then he got up, then he left\".</p>\n\n<p>As Hebrew evolved into LBH, which led into Mishnaic Hebrew (MH), the waw-consecutive form began to be replaced with other verbal forms, especially the participles, which became more and more prominently used as verbs.</p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/448887/midrashim_based_on_changes_within_Hebrew_from_the_Bible_to_the_Rabbis\">this article</a> by Aaron Koller, for example, who writes (pg. 269): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It will suffice to say here that there are many examples of (especially pre-dicative) participles in which the participle is fully verbal. In Late Biblical Hebrew such usage increases; there are examples in which yiqtol forms from Standard Biblical Hebrew are replaced in Late Biblical Hebrew by participles. This pattern of increasingly verbal use of the participle continues in Qumran Hebrew and perhaps the Hebrew of Bar Koseba. Within Mishnaic Hebrew, the participle is a major component of the verbal system, serving for present and future tenses as well as other uses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later in the article, he actually analyzes some midrashim on Esther, which pick up on the use of participles to derive fascinating reads. So I guess the conclusion is that there are multiple layers here, and while there may be a simple historical-linguistic-grammatical explanation, that doesn't prevent us from being able to derive plenty of meaning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps this can be explained by the teaching of the Baal Shem Tov quoted in the beginning of this <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org.il/Magazines/Article.asp?ArticleID=5950&CategoryID=1293\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"הקורא את המגילה למפרע לא יצא\", שכאשר קורא את המגילה באופן שחושב שזהו מאורע שאירע בעבר, למפרע, אזי לא יצא, כיוון שהתורה היא נצחית, וכל ענייניה ישנם גם בהווה.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>One who reads the Megilla out of order does not fulfill his obligation.  Meaning that one who reads the Megilla in a way that he thinks that this is something that <em>happened in the past</em>  (L'Mafrea) he has not fulfilled his obligation.  Since the Torah is eternal and <strong>everything is happening presently</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In his understanding, the fact that they thought that simply letting them have their way for a 3 day vacation would fix everything is the part that shows that their heart was still hardened, and in fact, Or Hachaim says that when Moshe asked to take everyone with (i.e. no guarantee that they would return) the slaves also agreed with his refusal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד מתי יהי׳ וגו׳ – לא שהסכימו לשלח ישראל בהחלט כי הנבואה שאמר ה׳ למשה הכבדתי וגו׳ תכחיש זה אלא שרצו שילכו באופן שיחזרו ודאי ולזה תמצא כשאמר משה בנערינו ובזקנינו וגו׳ וגרש׳ פרעה לא יספו דבר עוד בדבר הזה גם פיהם ענה בם כי לא האמינו בסדר המעשה כי אלהי העברים הגדול הגבור והנורא נטה ידו בהם לשלוח ישראל אלא שהיו יוקשים בהם ואין לך כפירה באמיתות הענין כזה.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/10.1#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra to Shemos 10:1</a> explains that it was only <strong>up until now</strong> that Hashem had hardened Pharaoh's servants hearts (and that was the reason why they did not send them out during/after Barad, see for example, Rashbam and others). However, now that Moshe had come forward threatening Arbeh, they snapped to their senses, and were softened.  (Note that he mentions this issue directly in his second Perush there.)</p>\n\n<p>Chizkuni (10:7, above link) says that the hardening of the hearts was that they only wanted to send out the men (Shalach es Haanashim), and not everybody:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמרו עבדי פרעה אליו – ומה שכתוב למעלה הוא ועבדיו הם אותם שהשיאו עצה שלא לשלח רק את הגברים.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>3) Ibn Caspi to 10:1 and 10:7 (above links) says that Avadim here means his top, honorable advisors and officers.  I would assume that this is what others take for granted.  (Note that the Avadim are involved throughout the entire story, during the Maakos, and even when the snake/staff trick was performed, amking this very likely.)  Edit: Malbim to Bereishis 20:40 says this as well.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is that it refers to a large portion of Egypt's population, and that the populace, even though they were slaves to the king, still had a say.

If you want to see more books translated, you can contribute small amounts, or sponsor an entire book or series, as the Schottenstein family, for example has done.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there is a pressing need to find and republish lost books of learning still in Hebrew, and money is needed for that.  </p>\n\n\n",

This was to help support the fact that it wasn't Moshe and Aaron that were bringing about the Plagues, but rather it was Hashem.  Moshe and Aaron needed to initiate the Plague otherwise people would say it was just a coincidence.  By marking exactly the beginning and end it showed that it was brought about by Hashem.

In Eruvin 54, much advice is given on the topic, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learn out-loud</strong> -- Rabbi Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: \"Open your mouth when you learn written or oral Torah, in order that you will remember it and live a long time.\"  Also, Rabbi Yitzhok said, \"Torah is close to you when it is [audible] in your mouth and your heart [intends to fulfill it; alt. Maharsha - if it is audible in your mouth, you will remember it and be able to fulfill it].\"</li>\n<li><strong>Approach your learning with humility</strong> -- As Rava, citing the verse \"Umi'Midbar Matanah umi'Matanah Nachli'el umi'Nachli'el Bamos...\", taught: \"When a person makes himself Hefker to all like a Midbar (wilderness), Torah is given to him as a gift; after this, it is like a Nachalah (inheritance) to him; then, he is elevated (Bamos); If he raises himself (becomes haughty), Hash-m lowers him - \"Umi'Bamos ha'Gai (the canyon)\"; if he repents [from his haughtiness], Hash-m raises him - \"Kol Ge Yinasei\". </li>\n<li><strong>Repetition and Review</strong> -- G-d taught the Torah to Moses completely through four times; Moses then taught the Torah to just Aaron, then to Aaron and Elazar, then to Aaron, Elazar and the Elders, and then to Aaron, Elazar, the Elders and all of Israel.  So Aaron learned it four times from Moses, Elazar learned it three times from Moses, the Elders heard it twice from Moses, and the congregation heard it once from him.  Then Moses left  and Aaron took over.  Each group heard the Torah four times and taught it four times.  RAbbi Eliezer learned from this that a student will retain his Torah if he hears it four times.  While the Gemara doesn't go further, I would add that we can also learn from this that teaching the subject four times further solidifies the knowledge in one's own brain.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Tif'eres Yisra'el (Bo'az, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37946&st=&pgnum=311\">Avos 1:15</a>) gives five points for success in learning and improving the memory:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Not to learn lazily (lying down, leaning, or eating when learning), and not to concentrate on things other than learning.

He shouldn't be extremely happy or sad, excluding the joy he feels because of the learning.</p></li>\n<li><p>A person should be calm while learning. There should be no distractions in the room in which he is learning. The room should be spacy and have windows. The book from which he is learning should have a clear print.</p></li>\n<li><p>A person shouldn't take breaks in the middle of learning one thing. A person also shouldn't switch from learning one thing to another so quickly; he should learn a maximum of three things a day.

    "content": "# Does God benefit from our keeping of the Mitzvos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does Hashem benefit from mankind doing the commandments of the Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Deuteronomy.22.6.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Ramban</strong> states in Devorim (Perek Kof Beis, Pasuk Vov)</a> that \"there is no benefit in our keeping of mitzvos to the Holy One blessed be He.\"  One cannot \"benefit Him\" or \"harm Him\" through the keeping or not keeping of mitzvos.  He states further that our \"words of praise and remembrances of his miracles are considered as nothingness and emptiness to him.  All these [mitzvos] are for our benefit alone.  This is something agreed upon by all our Rabbis.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Rambam</strong> states in the Moreh Nevuchim, Book I, Chapter 55 that no change or emotion can ever be predicated of Hashem.  As the Novie states in Malachi Perek Gimmel, Pasuk Vov,  \"I, G-d, do not change.\"\nRambam states in the Yad, Laws Concerning the Fundamentals of our Faith, Perek Alef, Halacha Yud Alef, \"and He does not change, for there is nothing that can cause change in him.  There does not exist in him... anger or laughter, happiness or sadness…\"  It is certainly clear from the Rambam and Ramban that we cannot say of the Creator that he is at one time sad, and at another happy.  He, being perfect, does not change ever.  We cannot effect him or change him no matter what we do, whether we are righteous or evil, whether we pray or don't pray.</p>\n<p>Based on the above two Rishonim, it would seem that we cannot in any way benefit or change God with the performance of the commandments in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Baal Hatanya explains in Torah Ohr <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/toraor/13/55d.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">(נה,ד)</a> that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישראל מפרנסין לאביהם שבשמים</p>\n  \n  <p>Israel are <strong>providers</strong> to their father in heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which he brings from The Midrash Rabbah Shir Hashirim 1:9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רעיתי מהו רעיתי אמר רבי יונתן מפרנסתי הן</p>\n  \n  <p>What does \"My Beloved\" mean?  Rabbi Yonasan says they are my <strong>provider</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to chassidus, this is an analogy to understand the benefit so to speak that Hashem gets from our divine service.  Although on one hand Hashem does not lack anything, He has made it His ultimate will to have a dwelling place in the lower worlds (Dira B'Tachtonim), and it is His will that this be achieved through the work of a Jew.  When a Jew serves Hashem in the proper way he provides this dwelling place for Hashem in the world.  So in this way Hashem so to speak benefits from Jews doing mitzvos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No. G-d gets nothing from a person doing good: \"If you sin, how will you affect Him? And if your sins multiplied, what will you have done to Him? If you have been righteous, what can you give Him, or what will He accept from your hand?\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2735.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 35:6-7</a>).</p>\n<p>If so, why do we serve G-d?</p>\n<p>From <em>Rav Schwab on Prayer</em> (by Rabbi Shim'on Schwab), pp. 416-417:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since we are at a loss to adequately express our gratitude to <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>, we declare וקונה הכל, meaning, \"We have nothing to offer You, for You own everything; we are therefore Your servants.\"</p>\n<p>There is an interesting illustration of this in <em>Parashas Vayigash</em> (<em>Bereishis</em> 47:13-23) in the narrative of how Yosef managed the distribution of the stored grain and food in Egypt during the famine. The Torah tells us there that in the first year of the famine alone, the Egyptians and Canaanites used all of their money and traded all of their livestock to buy enough grain and food to sustain themselves. And in the second year, with no wherewithal to buy food, the populace approached Yosef and offered to exchange themselves, together with their land, to Pharaoh for food. This offer was accepted by Yosef on behalf of Pharaoh. The result was that, in exchange for feeding the Egyptian population, Pharaoh acquired all their money, livestock, land, and even their bodies as indentured slaves, in exchange for their sustenance.</p>\n<p>The reason the Torah relates this piece of Egyptian history — which, on the surface, has no connection with the development of the Jewish people in Egypt — is to illustrate for us how we are to approach the concept of gratitude to <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> when we are utterly devoid of the means to do so. Just as the Egyptians of old declared, ונהיה ... עבדים לפרעה, <em>and we will become slaves to Pharaoh</em> (<em>Bereishis</em> 47:19), when they lacked any other means of repayment for their sustenance, we too say to <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em>, we offer ourselves as Your servants: וקונה הכל, \"You own everything — even ourselves.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/30037\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> which basically reinforces the concept: The commandments are not for G-d; they are for <em>us</em> to improve ourselves.</p>\n\n\n",

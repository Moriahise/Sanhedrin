Midrash Tanchuma, Bereishit 12. Seforno to Genesis 8:22 say that the world preceding the Flood was marked by abundance, health, and prosperity. The average human lifespan lasted many hundreds of years, and the climate across the globe was temperate and pleasant.</p>\n<p>Rashi on the other hand says in Bereshit Chapter 5, pasuk 29:\n'... And the land was producing thorns and thistles when they sowed wheat, because of the curse of the first man (Adam), but in Noah’s time, it [the curse] subsided.'</p>\n<p>So what was the status of the world before the flood? Was it a good place like the first paragrapah above mentions, or was it a bad place like Rashi mentions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>So basically, Rashi says that the name \"Noach\" means \"rest\" and he also says that Noach was the one who came up with farming equipment. Without this invention, the land would get all messed up with thorns and stuff, and it would be really hard to work on. But even though Rashi says this, it doesn't go against what the Midrash says about people living long and happy lives with lots of good things. What Rashi is trying to explain is that with the farming equipment, it made working the land a whole lot easier.</p>\n\n\n",

The item I was reading was talking about how Shlomo HaMelech was very wise and his wisdom was greater than the Astronomy wisdom of the people of the east etc etc.</p>\n<p>After Shabbath, I wanted to know more about that pasuk.\nSo I typed 'solomon wisdom egypt east' in google's search box.</p>\n<p>All the results were linking to me to goyish websites. I clicked on the first hit from a goyish website that said that those search terms were in '<strong>1 Kings 4:30</strong>'.\n( I always assumed that the goyim followed the same pasuk rules as Yidden did; or vice versa' )</p>\n<p>When I went to Chabad to find <strong>1 Kings 4:30</strong>, I noticed that in the 'NaCh', 1 Kings, Chapter 4 has only 20 pesukim!\nThe pasuk that I was looking for is actually <strong>1 Kings 5:10</strong> according to the Jewish way of splitting Chapters/ Pesukim!</p>\n<p>Long story short, I wanted to share that the way we split up chapters is obviously not how goyyim split it up.\nThis changed my opinion I always had ( and was obviously told ) that the Jewish way of splitting chapters was exactly how the goyyim split their chapters.</p>\n<p><em>Does anyone know if this incongruency is common or is this a one shot occurrence?</em></p>\n<p>p.s. I am aware that splitting our books into chapters and individual pesukim is a medieval goyish doing and we never split our Parshioth.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As a follow up to my comments to this intriguing question, I want to highlight the <strong>critical issue</strong> regarding one of these divisions. As mentioned by the OP, the divisions of chapters is NOT a Jewish invention, however has been considered mainstream and for the most part accepted.</p>\n<p>Although this is the case today, there <strong>DOES EXIST</strong> some differences in chapter divisions in Tanach versus a christian translation.\nThis is for 3 reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some for the sake of readability for Non-Jews</li>\n<li>Some beginning verses, for example in Psalms, are counted as “titles” and verse 1 in the christian translation would actually be verse 2 in the Tanach</li>\n<li>And others were purposeful distortions for the sake of deception, as I will attempt to elucidate below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Tanach, Isaiah chapter 8 ends with verse 23.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(22) And he shall look to the land, and behold, distress and darkness, weariness of oppression, and to the darkness he is lost. (23) For there is no weariness to the one who oppresses her; like the first time, he dealt mildly, [exiling only] the land of Zebulun and the land of Naftali, and the last one he dealt harshly, the way of the sea, and the other side of the Jordan, the attraction of the nations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within the context of chapters 7 and 8 of Isaiah, the Prophet is discussing the 2 waves of exile as a result of the Assyrian Empire. Here the first one (exile of Northern Israel) is mentioned as “mild”, being that the second wave (of Southern Israel, also known as Judah) ALTHOUGH NOT A COMPLETE EXILE, would be much harsher. Knowing the context of chapter 7 and 8 is important as we find the Prophet initially speaking to King Ahaz because of his fear of having his kingdom thwarted by the Assyrians who allied with Northern Israel to go against Judah. (They allied but eventually Assyria would also drive out the Northern Israel).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And you shall say to him, \"Feel secure and calm yourself, do not fear, and let your heart not be faint because of these two smoking stubs of firebrands, because of the raging anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah. (Isaiah 7:4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason God even is telling Isaiah to speak to Ahaz is due to the promise He made with King David, that the Davidic Dynasty would not be abrogated (even though Ahaz did not merit this). Therefore in Isaiah chapter 7, it is clear that a particular individual would be the vehicle in which God would use to save Ahaz and Judah (Judah being the loyal branch and the remnant of the Davidic covenant, this individual is Hezekiah who WAS righteous and faithful to God and to the Davidic dynasty). What we see at the END of Isaiah 8 is that even though it seems that God’s promise is not being fulfilled and the kingdom of Assyria WILL come to exile part of Judah, eventually OUT OF NO WHERE, they will cease attacking Judah and leave. (This happened in 2 Chronicles 32). The beginning of Isaiah 9 denotes an “interruption” in time from the first wave of exile to now discuss the second wave and how salvation will miraculously come.</p>\n<p><strong>BUT</strong>, the older christian church did <strong>NOT</strong> approve of this message. They wanted to fit their theology into this prophecy and make it about an <strong>EVEN FURTHER IN THE FUTURE</strong> salvation (so that it wouldn’t be within Ahaz’s lifetime):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Isaiah 9:1) But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He will make it glorious, by the way of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. (2) The people who walk in darkness will see a great light;\nThose who live in a dark land,\nThe light will shine on them. (christian translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here, the clear interruption of time is now hidden and it may even seem as though that the ENTIRE chapter 9 speaks in FUTURE TENSE. To prove that this is a deceitful manipulation, compare <em><strong>YOURSELF</strong></em> Isaiah 9:6 (any christian translation) to Isaiah 9:5 from Chabad or any Tanach. <strong>NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FUTURE TENSE AND PAST TENSE.</strong></p>\n<p>It was not enough to put 8:23 in front of 9:1, they even went as far as <strong>CHANGING</strong> the tense of the verbiage used to mask this deceit.</p>\n<p>The answer: It is clear and obvious, for example, that ‘vayikra’ is not future tense. It should be noted that Isaiah chapter 7 also speaks of the birth of a child whom BEFORE he matures into bar mitzvah age (knowing to choose good and reject evil) the two kingdoms that go against Ahaz will perish:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For, when the lad does not yet know to reject bad and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread, shall be abandoned.\" (Isaiah 7:16)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore this child, ALREADY WAS BORN (during the first period of time of Isaiah 7 and 8) and only during the period of chapter 9 did the child <strong>finally</strong> reach the age close to maturity. Proving this <strong>DOES NOT</strong> correlate to the prophecy of jesus who was approximately born 500-700 YEARS after Isaiah passed away, which would bear no significance to King Ahaz either..</p>\n<p>I hope this has been clear, unfortunately this tactic of deception is the same used by christian missionaries to hide the truth and beauty of Tanach. Thank you for your question and for taking the time to read this.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is fear of G_d separate from him?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a question that is built on the Chassidic school's teaching that G_d is everything. Absolutely everything. There is nothing but him. ( It is based on deep Lubavitch Hasidic Principles that, respectfully,  might confuse students who don't learn it.

Right now, we are only <em>seemingly</em> separated. To see someone, I have to leave my own realm, and look \"out\" and all I get is a vision of their externalities, but they are unreachable to me. In time, it won't be like that at all, I will instead get knowledge of them from \"gaining knowledge\" about myself, because the fact that we are separated won't be noticeable anymore.</p>\n<p>What I am trying to illustrate with this is that</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The higher we go in the ladder to understanding Hashem, the more abstract and disconnected from human reason they become. I.e. to understand these things, it doesn't help to be smarter, <em>more</em> logical, or have bigger, broader knowledge. There certainly is a direct route from <strong>The Truth about how \"our fear is apart, but still part of, but not <em>a part</em> of Hashem\"</strong> makes perfect sense, to the <strong>\"logical explanation\"</strong> of how it makes sense, but ultimately that logical explanation is a hundred layers deep in \"mashal\", and can merely invite a person to try and climb <strong>higher</strong>.</li>\n<li>The way things are now, (especially) including the fact that there are \"parts\", is just a concealment. However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27ar_HaEmunah_VeYesod_HaChasidut%2C_Entrance_to_the_Gate_of_Beit_Yaakov.4.2?vhe=Shaar_HaEmunah_Ve%27Yesod_HaChassidut,_1996.&lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">we have been very deliberately designed</a> so we <em>can't</em> understand that. We can't see it any other way.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a result of 1, you will end up with a lot of different explanations, some better, some worse, sometimes contradicting each other, some that appeal to you and some that make zero sense or sound heretical to you, even if sourced in Torah opinions you might otherwise deeply respect. Kabbalah does indeed confirm that we are זולתו, we are other to Him, but we also know that He has absolutely no help in making us whatsoever. We are working with a paradox, and ideas that we can't comprehend.</p>\n<p>As a result of 2, you can see that free will is essential. This whole thing, that we are separate, is so we can have free will, and what is free will except our fear of heaven? This is what Chazal are teaching us with the statement you bring: Hashem's guiding hands of Hashgacha leave your \"fear of heaven\" alone. Hashem wants to ensure that you feel otherly enough to Him to be able to actually freely choose with your <em>own</em> being whether you fear and love Him or not.</p>\n<p>The accomplishment of free will generally is one of those items in theology that are relegated to <em><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3051/jewish/The-Free-Will-Problem-in-Judaism.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">paradox</a></em>, for reasons very related to your question of <em>separateness vs oneness</em>. That means the logical mechanics of how it can work are so beyond us we can't actually solve it at all, and are simply left with contradictions by logic. Yet we know <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from mesorah</a> that we have it, even though it is a paradox, so we believe in it b'emunah. We also try to deepen our understanding despite this, in any way that we can.</p>\n<p>Lubavitch Chassidus does have a lot to say on free will (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3909393/jewish/Free-Will.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for example</a>), and this subject in general. It is heavily based on Rambam, what he writes in Mishneh Torah and Moreh Nevuchim. In this subject of Lubavitch ideas on free will, a key issue is that Hashem created us so that He could have us, and that having us has to be real, not forced. Which means, we have to consent and, furthermore, choose to be with Him wholeheartedly. To accomplish this, He has taken us to the lowest world, which is a world that has stripped away every last drop of <em>force</em> (including the true fact that there is no separation), so we are able to make a real choice to love and fear Him</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldThqpY-Pu4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Lubavitcher Rebbe really had a strong innovation on this point</a> (this answer will be based on this shiur), in that he taught us that the realm of a real Divine <em>someone</em> is beyond the paradox. It is a realm beyond logic itself, so when we talk about what's going on in that realm, we can only use metaphors.</p>\n<p>The standard metaphor of free will is choosing between options using a rational brain. This is only a metaphor, and doesn't really make sense anyway (the rational \"choice\" is what it is, it's not something we can <em>choose</em> i.e. <em>logic</em> and <em>reason</em> are <em>influential</em>). But it teaches us that high up in our soul there is a real version of free will, which is Divine. It's not a choice between options, but, as far as we can say in words, it is <em>choosing</em> another someone, with one's own self, one's own someone-hood, or to put it in the original language, with one's essence. Take something superficial to you, external to you, and make it you.</p>\n<p>The deeper mashal of free will in <em>ruchnius</em> is that we don't choose between options, but we choose who we are. This is closer to the real Divine version of free choice, because it's taking some <em>thing</em>, like a personality trait, or a subject, or a cause, and making it part of our identity. Choosing as in, making it <em>yours</em>. This is close but not quite the same as real free choice, because the closer to your real essence you go, the more removed we are from all \"things\", and all that there is is us, which is perfect because when you remove all things, which includes all external influences, then you are completely free to be <em>you</em>. We have the power on that level to wholeheartedly accept and make Him ours, or actually, make Him us, and become one by choice. Choice and self become one because, when there's no influence, then you are free to just be you. There's no option, but there's no force, it's true freedom, and true you.</p>\n<p>The purpose of free choice, then, <em>really</em> is making some <em>one</em> else, you, by <strong>only</strong> your own <em>choice</em> (which is you) and nothing else, and doing away with all this \"parts\" business in the first place! Our essence and our choice are identical and this incredible power to become one like this comes from our Divine souls.</p>\n<p>The appearance of separateness that exists in the world of Asiya will no longer be needed and will fall away to where we don't notice that anymore, and we will see only how we are one, and He is more infinitely One than we can have imagined, and there is no true separation between us, and hopefully by then, you will get an answer to your question!</p>\n<p>For now it seems best we don't understand much about this yet, as it will make it less of a <em>free</em> choice to fear Him!</p>\n\n\n",

However, Israel (the Northern Kingdom) had been destroyed for over ~100 years. Take chapter 5 vs 11 for instance, For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously with Me,” says the Lord.</p>\n<p>Then in a couple verses down, it says the following: Behold, I will bring a nation against you from afar,\nO house of Israel,” says the Lord.\n“It is a mighty nation,\nIt is an ancient nation,\nA nation whose language you do not know,\nNor can you understand what they say.</p>\n<p>So we can see, within the same chapter, Yirmiyahu makes a distinction between both houses; however, in a few verses down, he speaks as if the house of Israel had not been destroyed yet. Why does Yirmiyahu speak as if Israel had not yet fallen? What am I not understanding?

It is an illusion based on a lack of self-awareness. One interrupts one’s learning in thinking one has, chas v’shalom, lost the spiritual ability to comprehend the Torah, as you put it.</p>\n<p>There are situations in the Torah where G-d “hardens” or makes heavy the hearts of leaders, such as Pharaoh, who are engaged in evil acts. The solution to the hardening of the heart is to open the heart, and this is why some translations refer to a “<a href=\"https://aish.com/321172521/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">circumcision</a>” of the heart, which is possible through tzedakah. Gittin 7a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a person sees that his sustenance is limited he should use it for\ncharity, and all the more so when it is plentiful. In other words, if\nhis livelihood has finished [nishlam] he should perform charity, and\nhe should certainly act in this manner if his means are plentiful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4203668/jewish/What-Is-Tzedakah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sages</a> teach us that even a poor person who subsists on the charity\nof others should perform acts of charity. Each of us has something to\ncontribute to others: time, expertise, attention, or even a simple\nsmile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A beginner’s learning is as legitimate and valuable as anyone else’s. When babies hear language, their learning has an immense value precisely because their minds are open and lack basic assumptions. Similarly, if your sins have caused you great suffering, you may be in an opportune place to finally learn, separate from the illusions of temporal power that you had before the suffering.</p>\n<p>When one attains <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesillat_Yesharim.25.7?lang=bi&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fear of sin</a>, as the Mesilat Yesharim explains, one understands that “hindsight is 20/20,” one can learn by reflecting on any situation.</p>\n<p>True learning is knowing that each mistake, each “brain clog,” is a breakthrough, not a breakdown. An internal combustion engine functions by constant explosions. The embarrassment, fear, and self-doubt of sin should be an explosion that can drive the vehicle forward towards Teshuva.</p>\n\n\n",

Can anyone assist?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Basically, the answer is that although Avraham circumcised himself before he circumcised his household members, nevertheless  being that Avraham’s Geirus wasn’t yet completed at the time that he circumcised them, being that we don’t find anywhere that he immersed himself, therefore his own circumcision only took affect once the circumcision of his household members was performed by him, which, according to the Rogachover, is considered the “final blow” which makes it a complete conversion - even without immersion - being that the conversion can be completed by performing a Mitzvah that is done only by a Jew</p>\n<p>The analogy from the “hammer’s blow” is that just as Avraham’s circumcision took affect through the act of circumcising his household members, we find something similar to the Gemara, regarding Shabbos, that by banging a hammer against against a tree stump is considered “fixing” the hammer, being that it becomes more smooth by doing so</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are several details in what the Rogatchover is pointing out that are not so simple.</p>\n<p>He emphasizes that unlike Yitzchok whose circumcision was for the mitzvah of Milah of a Yisrael, Avraham's circumcision was for conversion.</p>\n<p>This is indicated because Avraham performed his circumcision at dawn, in contrast to Yitzchok's circumscision being performed after sunrise.</p>\n<p>He then points out that there appears to be a conflict in the text of the Torah as to who was circumcised first, Avraham or <em>Yishmael and those from Avraham's household</em> (meaning those Avraham acquired as servants/slaves and those offspring born to those servants).</p>\n<p>But in the final version of Tzaphnat Paneach, he discusses in regard to circumcision and immersion that even though immersion in the mikvah is the completion of the conversion process, one becomes a convert retroactively (<em>meaning back to when the cicumcision was actually performed</em>). Further on, he explains that a non-Jew cannot circumcise a Jew, even though Avraham circumcised the members of his household prior to immersion and after his milah.</p>\n<p>The Rogatchaver then brings a concept from Rambam to resolve the issue from Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah, Chapter 13:9, that one who conducts themselves completely according to Jewish practice has a presumption of being a <em>Righteous Convert</em>. (In this context, it is worth noting that the Patriachs and Matriachs kept all the commandments even before they were given at Sinai.)</p>\n<p>That this would apply to Avraham when he assisted the members of his household with their circumcisions. By <em>assisting</em> them, which is in general a Jewish practice, Avraham completed his conversion (<em>the so called <strong>striking of the final hammer blow</strong></em>) and he brings Isaiah 41:6 as proof of this which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אִ֥ישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵ֖הוּ יַעְזֹ֑רוּ</strong> וּלְאָחִ֖יו יֹאמַ֥ר חֲזָֽק׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then adds an additional, seemingly unnecessary, detail here that this pertains to a female convert who conducts herself according to Jewish practice, like immersing in a mikvah following her period or to a man who immerses  following nocturnal emission.</p>\n<p>And in this context, the Rogatchover seems to be pointing to at least the possibility that Avraham was circumcised by his wife, Sarah, like is understood from Bereshit 2:18 which also says concerning the creation of the wife of Adam:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים לֹא־ט֛וֹב הֱי֥וֹת הָֽאָדָ֖ם לְבַדּ֑וֹ <strong>אֶֽעֱשֶׂהּ־לּ֥וֹ עֵ֖זֶר כְּנֶגְדּֽוֹ</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That ones wife is also referred to as ones <em>assistant</em> and thus, Sarah had a presumption of being a Righteous Convert because like her husband, she too kept all the commandments before they were given including Taharat HaMishpacha.</p>\n<p>And like her, the circumcisions performed by Avraham on the members of his household were valid because he followed Jewish practice before the commandments were given and was presumed a Righteous Convert immediately upon himself being circumcised.</p>\n<p>And this same paradigm also seems to be the basis of the action of Moshe's wife, Tzipporah like is found in Shemot 4:25-26 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתִּקַּ֨ח צִפֹּרָ֜ה צֹ֗ר וַתִּכְרֹת֙ אֶת־עׇרְלַ֣ת בְּנָ֔הּ וַתַּגַּ֖ע לְרַגְלָ֑יו וַתֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֧י חֲתַן־דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽי׃\nוַיִּ֖רֶף מִמֶּ֑נּוּ אָ֚ז אָֽמְרָ֔ה חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים לַמּוּלֹֽת׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Unfortunately it is one of the sections that is poorly footnoted, so you may have to dig further. However it should give you some context (pp. 160-161):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Salt was another such substance which figured prominently in the\nfolklore of European peoples, Thus it was believed that salt is never\nfound at the witches’ Sabbat feast, and the Inquisitor and his\nassistants at a witch-trial were warned to wear bags containing\nconsecrated salt for protection against the accused, Jewish folklore\ncredited salt with an equally high potency. In Ezek. 16:4 we learn,\nthat new-born babes were rubbed with salt, a practice sill current in\nthe Orient. According to medieval authorities, salt must be set on a\ntable before a meal is begun \"because it protects one against Satan’s\ndenunciations.” The Kabbalists were more outspoken: “It drives off the\nspirits,” they wrote, \"because it is the mathematical equivalent of\nthree Y-H-V-H's; therefore one should dip the piece of bread over\nwhich the Benediction is recited, three times into salt.” “After each\nmeal eat some salt and you will not be harmed.” For this reason, salt\nwas used in many rites connected with birth, marriage, and death, and\nin medicine. Very often salt and bread were jointly prescribed to\ndefeat the stratagems of spirits and magicians, When a witch assaults\na man, he can bring about her death by forcing her to give him some of\nher bread and salt. Murderers ate bread and salt immediately after\ntheir crime to prevent the return of their victim’s spirit to wreak\nvengeance upon them. Schudt reports that a Jewish woman advised, him\nto hang bread and salt on his daughter’s neck to protect her from\nharm; “she had done this to all her children and in consequence they\nhad all prospered.” The common practice of bringing salt and bread\ninto a new home before moving in, usually explained as symbolic of the\nhope that food may never be lacking there, was probably also in origin\na means of securing the house against the spirits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's the Jewish attitude towards work and unionizing?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a very personal question and open ended question, and I am not sure if it is really right to give this much personal context. But I believe it is something that most people experience.</p>\n<p>I have lived in 4 countries. And their work ethic commonly seems mutually unnatural and immoral. I believe Jewish work ethic is ideally one where workers are not supposed to complain, you work incredibly hard, but not on Sabbath, you work smart, building wealth is admirable, you are always honest in your dealings, and the work is to help bring about mitzvot and should not violate any of them, but work for the sake of work is not a Jewish thing. But I don't think there is really a country that follows Jewish work ethic.</p>\n<p>I am an American that has lived overseas for awhile. And confronting the rise and grind attitude here, where I have heard colleagues brag about struggling to not be able to afford medical treatment and stratification is an accepted norm and to not question about anything that keeps stratification in place. For example, hearing aggressive responses like, \"It is their fault for living in Cahokia that their children have a bad education.\" But when I lived in China, while people might work longer hours and still struggle to get ahead, it is not a badge of honor like in America. Rich people in China will actually dress up in pajamas to brag about not having to work. And there is a talk of common prosperity even though it is elusive because of rampant corruption in China. There is a similar phenomena in Thailand, albeit the infrastructure and access to quality education is dismal there compared to China. And there is a common belief that where you are in life is your fault because of a past life. Also in Thailand, unlike in China, there is often a common attitude of just accepting things the way they are, don't be a hero and try to improve the world around you but work is most certainly not the center of one's life like in America. And finally, in South Korea, I would meet so many students and employees that were uncontrollably suicidal. I got fired from a position for telling a student (10 year old girl) in South Korea that she should take a break from the Hagwon after she started cutting herself . And the manager at that Hagwon would always brag about how much stress she had. None of these seems like Torah workplace ideals.</p>\n<p>When I study the Torah, I always get this deep sense to get where G-d wants us to follow Him and it is supposed to bring about a prosperity for everyone. Like the world is enough, all life is valued and to be cherished, and any scarcity is artificial due to humans.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, complaining seems frowned upon by the Torah. An example about the Hebrews complaining about the manna. And I would argue, there are many times in life it seems that it is best to just suck it up and accept things until you get somewhere better.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are a lot of strikes taking place in America, and I am trying to figure out a Jewish way of thinking about what is going on and how to cope with studying the Torah and living with what we have now. And is unionizing acceptable since there is a sense of complaining?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>We do not glorify poverty, but we do view work as ennobling. G-d could have <em>poof</em>! given the people a Tabernacle in the desert, but the <em>process</em> of everyone working together to build one (and it was nice, but its dimensions were eminently doable) helped the people cohere, and start thinking of themselves as a people.</p>\n<p>The \"how\" matters.</p>\n<p>The late Rabbi Aaron Lichteinstein notes that when the Bible describes Jewish projects, we hear a lot about the \"how\" -- for instance, the diplomacy and labor draft that Solomon used to build the First Temple. In contrast, when the Persian emperor throws a massive bash at the beginning of the Book of Esther, we just hear about luxury upon luxury appearing piled on high, royalty doesn't care how it got there... the idea was that this notion is (and should be) foreign to us.</p>\n<p>The Talmud describes how in a typical marital arrangement 1800 years ago, the husband would provide for the wife, while she was expected to do certain labor in the house. \"What if she's so rich that she brought her own staff to do all the household work?\" Doing <em>nothing</em> is not good, mentally or spiritually. One opinion there is that she needs hobbies; the other is that she still should at least do some wool spinning.</p>\n<p>The Torah speaks in terms of <em>obligations</em>, not <em>rights.</em> An employer is prohibited from paying his employees late, or restricting his harvesters from eating some on the job, and the Talmud in fact has a whole chapter dedicated to an employer's obligations to his workers.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the Talmud will conclude -- \"whatever the norm is for that industry in that location.\" Which leaves a lot of leeway, and may therefore vary by locale today too.</p>\n<p>So while \"let's complain our way out of any work at all\" isn't right, an exploitative employer is also not right. At which point it's reasonable for the employee to speak up. They recently found a First Temple era Hebrew letter from some worker to the local mayor/governor -- \"I did a good job working the field; ask any of the other workers. But the owner claims I didn't, and took my coat; I want my coat back!\"</p>\n<p>Of course, one person's \"plea for justice against exploitation\" is another person's \"entitled whining.\" That's why mediation, or having an outside authority make a call, is critical. A rabbinic group like <a href=\"https://bethdin.org/decisions/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Beth Din of America</a> will routinely hear civil cases of employment obligations.\n(Even synagogues and religious schools will routinely face claims about what's owed to their staff; bringing such a suit before a proper rabbinic panel is considered perfectly reasonable, provided they go through the right channels.)</p>\n<p>(And, of course, if an employer gives so much to the staff that the employer goes bankrupt, who's being helped? But that's a consideration for the experts.)</p>\n<p>If teachers in a religious school have not been paid for two months, are they allowed to go on strike? It's a serious and difficult question; the answer can't simply be \"oh you should just work hard and stop whining.\"</p>\n<p>In the mid-20th Century, several of the greatest authorities in America on Jewish law were Russian-born; they tended to be sympathetic to unions and their ability to strike (nonviolently) for reasonable causes. But there's no one-size-fits-all.</p>\n<p>In conclusion -- we are the People of the Book ... and we have a whole lot of books about this stuff!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Summary: there is slight theological support towards the concept of a union but nothing really concrete.</p>\n<p>Most orthodox Jews today (not necessarily the enlightenment ones who hang out on this forum) are politically 'right' and view the labor movement as communist, anti semitic and anti Zionist.</p>\n<p>In the early part of the 20th century, many immigrant Jews suffered from bad employers who would not let them observe Shabbat or try to stir antisemitism to distract workers from the actual controllers of their poor conditions.Many Jews, including the founders of the state of Israel were part of the labor movement. But this is a circumstantial thing, not part of the religion.</p>\n<p>On purely religious terms, unionizing is reflected in our religion. Forming a minyan, a zimmun, or a group of 600k makes our prayers more impactful. We are collectively bargaining for rain.</p>\n\n\n",

As you've pointed out in the question, and a lot of people would express similar sentiments, that we don't connect to the <em>Tehillim</em>, meaning our heart isn't in it. Even though we are aware of the reward and the fact that it fixes the world, this also doesn't seem to inspire us; our soul isn't in it either. So we are left with our might.</p>\n<p>If we are not thinking of the reward, or following our heart, then we are simply doing it for Him. No ulterior motive, and that is our might, and indeed sometimes we need to not be in the mood to expose that diamond in us, which is that we truly do it for our Master, not our personal gain. It has been said<sup>3</sup> that our generation only has access to this type of service, which corresponds to the highest service of all, the service of the <em>ben aliyah</em><sup>4</sup>, who is motivated not at all by his own gain or fulfilment, but by the fact that this what his Master needs of him<sup>5</sup>, and is therefore doing it Lishma<sup>6</sup>.</p>\n<p>The only thing many people of this \"lowly\" generation need to know is, <em>is this truly needed of me, or not</em>. Indeed, it is.  In the <em>leshem yichud</em> we say before reciting <em>Tehillim</em> (<a href=\"https://imgur.com/sofmSUr\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">e.g.</a>), we explain what the purpose of saying them is: to unite the Holy One Above with the Shechina down here, we aren't doing it for reward or ourselves at all*, we are doing it for Him<sup>7</sup>. This particular job, the Lubavitcher Rebbe says, is <em>tzorchei gvoha</em><sup>8</sup>, the needs of Heaven, and it is צרך גמור הוא, absolutely essential<sup>9</sup>. Of course it is, Torah is essential.</p>\n<p>A mentsch is someone who, even though he doesn't necessarily understand why he should, nor sees personal gain in doing so, and even at times when he is not even in the mood, is always happy to give his family, community and God what they need; tell them the words and praises that <em>they need to hear</em>, and that his essential relationship with them needs in order to be thrive in holiness and health. <strong>To take this idea from general to specifically about <em>Tehillim</em>, we can now say that Hashem waits expectantly for us to say <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/136020/31534\">His words</a>, the heartfelt poetry written by His beloved people (the King represents all of the nation<sup>10</sup>), which are filled with many loving praises and secrets.

May we be blessed that in doing so, we find the promised <em>simcha</em><sup>13</sup> that is found in our might, in the joy of giving to others what <em>they need</em> (just because we are lowly, does not mean we do not have a real <em>mentsch</em> on the inside - <em>based on the works of the Arizal, especially Shaar HaGilgulim</em>), and that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135675/31534\"><em>simcha</em> should <em>poretz gedarim</em></a>, and bring our heart and our soul back in to our service as well, which will create a momentum to learn more, and delve more into the general and specific themes, commentaries and secrets of <em>Tehillim</em><sup>14</sup>, and give us a <em>tayva</em> to sing them joyously each day.</p>\n<p>I hope this helps discover our own connection and fire in saying <em>Tehillim</em>.</p>\n<p>tl;dr: Sometimes, the only reason we are not in the mood is because we are feeling it is <em>about us</em>, our <em>segula</em> etc, and realising otherwise is all it takes to feel at home again.</p>\n<p><sup>* This is a Divine relationship of \"I am for my Beloved, and My Beloved is for me\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.6.3?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שיר השירים ו׳:ג</a>) where we both seek this dwelling, and indeed we will find that He will look after us, for instance we will find a lot of timeless relevance to our lives in the Tehillim, and those words will become prayers that He answers, B'EH!</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.1.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משנה תורה, הלכות תפילה וברכת כהנים א׳:א</a><br />\n2 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.5?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דברים ו׳:ה</a><br />\n3 - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k46ynNtzts4&ab_channel=RabbiYoniKatz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">For example</a>.<br />\n4 - <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7889/jewish/Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya Chapter 10</a><br />\n5 - As in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.3?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משנה אבות א׳:ג</a><br />\n6 - See Rambam on ibid; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.10.4?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משנה תורה, הלכות תשובה י׳:ד-ה</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim.18.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מסילת ישרים י״ח</a><br />\n7 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sulam_on_Zohar%2C_Bereshit_I.181.1?vhe=Zohar_with_Sulam_commentary,_Jerusalem_1945&lang=bi&with=Zohar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הסולם על ספר הזהר א׳ כב</a><br />\n8 - <a href=\"https://he.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4279908\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בשעה שהקדימו, יום ב' דחג השבועות, ה'תשי\"ב</a><br />\n9 - <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/4280211/jewish/page.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">לא תהי' משכלה, ש\"פ משפטים, פרשת שקלים, מבה\"ח אדר, ה'תשי\"ב</a><br />\n10 - <em>שלבו הוא לב כל קהל ישראל</em>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.3.6?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">משנה תורה, הלכות מלכים ומלחמות ג׳:ו</a>; <em>תלי בעולם כמלך על כסאו גלגל בשנה כמלך במדינה לב בנפש כמלך במלחמה</em>, ספר יצירה, פרק ו<br />\n11 - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1?lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רש\"י על בראשית א׳:א׳</a>; See also footnote 8; Based on various midrashim, cited in Tanya Likkutei Amarim, explanations there.<br />\n12 - ואהבת את ה׳ אלקי<em>ך</em><br />\n13 - Based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.100.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תהילים ק׳:ב</a><br />\n14 - I found this <a href=\"https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/why-say-tehillim#post-1016480\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hidden gem of a comment</a>, with a wide spectrum of sources to pursue, in the yeshiva world coffee room <a href=\"https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/why-say-tehillim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">topic on this same question</a></p>\n</sup>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Tehillim is one of the books of the Bible, and as such, it has all the meaning and holiness of the Bible.

In the Foundations of Modern Science in the Medieval Era (pp. 109-110) Edward Grant explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The celestial spheres, as we saw, were assumed to be composed of an\nincorruptible ether whose properties contrasted radically with those\nof the incessantly changing four elements of the terrestrial region.\nIn Aristotle's scheme, change was unrealizable in the heavens because\nof an absence of contrary qualities, so that no pair of such qualities\ncould act on the same celestial body or in the same portion of\ncelestial ether. But if the heavenly ether lacked contrary qualities,\nwhy did natural philosophers and astrologers attribute contrary\nqualities to celestial bodies? For example, why did they describe\nSaturn as cold and dry, Mars as hot and dry, the Moon as cold and wet,\nand so on for the other planets? If these qualities were really absent\nfrom celestial bodies, why did astrologers and natural philosophers\nspeak as if they were present? The standard medieval reply to such a\nquestion would have been that <strong>the celestial ether possesses these\nqualities only virtually (virtualiter), not formally (formaliter), or\nactually. That is, a celestial body is said to \"possess\" qualities\nlike hotness or coldness only in the sense that it can somehow cause\nchanges in the hotness or coldness in bodies below the Moon, even\nthough that celestial body does not actually possess the qualities\nthat it allegedly produces in terrestrial bodies.</strong> To say, for example,\nthat Saturn is cold is not to say that the quality \"coldness\" actually\ninheres in Saturn's ethereal matter - indeed, it does not - but rather\nthat Saturn has the capacity to produce the effect of coldness in the\nterrestrial region. Again, <strong>the Sun is not actually hot, but it has the\ncapacity to cause hotness in objects in the terrestrial region.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This notion is similarly found in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kuzari.4.3?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9E%D6%B0%D7%97%D6%B7%D7%9E%D6%BC%D6%B5&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kuzari (4:3)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ – נִרְאֶה אוֹתָהּ עִגּוּל פָּשׁוּט כְּשִׁעוּר הַצִּנָּה\nוּבְתָאֳרָה: מַזְהִירָה, חַמָּה, נָחָה, וְהַשֵּׂכֶל גּוֹזֵר כִּי הוּא\nכַדּוּר גָּדוֹל מִכַּדּוּר הָאָרֶץ בְּמֵאָה וְשִׁשִּׁים וְשֵׁשׁ\nפְּעָמִים, וְ<strong>שֶׁאֵינָהּ חַמָּה</strong> וְלֹא נָחָה, אַךְ הִיא מִתְנוֹעַעַת\nשְׁתֵּי תְנוּעוֹת מִתְהַפְּכוֹת</p>\n<p>Another instance is offered by the sun, which we see as a round, flat\nbody, resembling a shield and giving forth light and heat, being in\nrepose.

    "content": "# Spelling mismatch between ketubah and gett\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Without going into the whole Gantsah Geshichta, my sister is trying to convince me of the critical importance of the spelling of a person's name. She points to a local Rabbi who is an \"expert in the spelling of names\". She says that he's often consulted when a ketubah or a gett is written.</p>\n<p>Okay, I understand the importance, and I can see him being consulted for a ketubah. But a gett?? What if someone's name is written one way on the ketubah and then it's decided that there's a \"more correct\" way to spell it and this spelling is used on the gett thereby creating a mismatch between these documents.</p>\n<p>In a case like this, does the gett really do what its supposed to? Is this simply an open invitation to create mamzerim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As stated above, a discrepancy in spelling isn't a problem; it's having the wrong name in a Gett that's a problem.</p>\n<p>There are some names where the halacha says \"multiple spellings are acceptable, so follow what you commonly use\"; but there are others where the halacha is: \"there is one right way to do it.\"</p>\n<p>Pinchas is a case of the latter; the proper way is always with a Yud. Even if he normally writes it without a yud, and if he wrote it without a Yud in the Kesubah. When it comes to the Gett, they spell it the \"right\" way. (There is a whole lot more wiggle room with spellings in a Kesubah than a Gett!) If someone compared the documents they would say -- <em>ah, the kesubah was done by a run-of-the-mill pulpit rabbi, while the Gett was done consulting an expert.</em> No problem.</p>\n<p>The only scenario that could cause headaches is if the kesubah says \"Pinchas\" and the Gett says \"Moshe.\" (Not \"Moshe also known as Pinchas\" or anything like that. Just \"Moshe.\") Then -- you need to talk to a serious posek ...</p>\n\n\n",

I have a particular interest in the siddur of Rabbi Shabtai of Rashkov and Rabbi Asher Margaliot (both of whom were well acquainted with the Besht, the Baal Shem Tov-the founder of the Chassidic movement) mostly because I am very fond of Chassidus in general. I also have an interest in the siddur and kavanot of Rabbi Shalom Sharabi.</p>\n<p>These siddurim are pretty much like any other siddur, with the exception that they contain many elaborate and often-times complicated kavanot and special meditations for the different parts of the prayer service. I am already familiar with some kabbalistic concepts and terminology (such as the sefirot/partzufim, gilgul, the four worlds, gematria, etc.) but my primary interest is in how one is actually supposed to incorporate these concepts in the kavanot and yichudim while praying.</p>\n<p>For example, in the first verse of the Shema, each one of the words has a particular correspondence to one of the sefirot or partzufim (such as Chokhma or Zeir Anpin). While saying the Shema, are we supposed to just keep these Sefirot in mind as we say each of the words or is there something else we are supposed to do while saying each of the words?</p>\n<p>There are also many other kavanot and meditations for the rituals and activities that we do throughout the day, such as for washing the hands, putting on the tallit and tefillin, making kiddush, immersing in the mikvah, even eating and drinking!</p>\n<p>How does one actually use these kavanot in the prayers, practically speaking? Does anyone here actually use any of these siddurim on a day-to-day basis?</p>\n<p>Thanks for the help!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Because of the sensitivity of this topic, I would simply recommend learning the Komarna sefer, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/67683\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nesiv Mitzvosecha</a> by Rabbi Yitzchak Eizik Yehuda Yechiel Safrin.  That book will give you background and some exercises in yichudim that you can then apply to tefilla if you so wish.\nThe most recent edition has a fantastic peirush explaining difficult concepts and providing practical context.

It struck the Philistine in the forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>David was charging toward Goliat who was also advancing towards him. Based on simple physics when Goliat was struck the force of the impact should have impeded his motion and knocked him backwards, yet the pasuk is explicit that Goliat fell forwards onto his face. Do any commentaries explain why the Plishti didn't fall backwards?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Purely from a physics perspective, the mass of the stone, even when moving at speed, is not significant enough to reverse Goliath's forward momentum.</p>\n<p>There are many movies where people are shown to fly backwards after being shot.  Those are entirely the product of what the director thinks looks cool rather than being a reflection of what would actually happen.</p>\n<p>If Goliath were standing still, with his feet side-by-side, it is possible that an impact on the forehead would cause a backwards fall.  With a stance with one foot forward of the other (and likely leaning forward) a forward fall becomes almost assured.  Include walking, rushing, or running forward, and falling forward is completely expected.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the energy of the stone was primarily expended in penetrating the skull.  Little energy remained to counter the forward momentum anyway.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Rashi addresses this. From Sefaria:</p>\n<p>And he fell face downward.

This teaches that the sun itself will burn and consume the wicked in the future. And the righteous will be healed by it, as it is written in the next verse: “But to you that fear My Name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings” (Malachi 3:20). And moreover, not only will they be healed by it, but they will even be rejuvenated by it, as it is stated in the continuation of that verse: “And you shall go forth and leap as calves of the stall.” [end quote from the Gemarra]</p>\n<p>This Gemarra appears to imply that a process similar to what we perceive as global warming may actually be extremely beneficial.</p>\n<p>Both groups clearly have solid textual suport for their positions, and both groups have rabbis big and small in their camps.</p>\n\n\n",

It is considered to be the thing that made Parah Adumah inexplicable even to Shlomo Hamelech.<br />\nI was wondering why the exact same thing is not said to be happening with the laws of Negaim, tzoraas. One din of tzoraas is מחיה - a place where there <em>is</em> no tzoraas. Paradoxically, that healthy skin is a sign of tumah.<br />\nAlso, the whole <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Negaim.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8th perek</a> is about the din of פורח, where the person becomes completely covered with tzoraas.

[That itself is an example of a seeming self-contradiction, see Zarka's answer.]<br />\nHowever, the mishnah makes clear that this is only true if the person was already tamei (or at least confined). Here's the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Negaim.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first mishnah</a> there, but it's repeated throughout the perek:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַפּוֹרֵחַ מִן הַטָּמֵא, טָהוֹר. חָזְרוּ בוֹ רָאשֵׁי אֵבָרִים, טָמֵא,\nעַד שֶׁתִּתְמַעֵט בַּהַרְתּוֹ מִכַּגְּרִיס. מִן הַטָּהוֹר, טָמֵא.\nחָזְרוּ בוֹ רָאשֵׁי אֵבָרִים, טָמֵא, עַד שֶׁתַּחֲזֹר בַּהַרְתּוֹ\nלִכְמוֹת שֶׁהָיְתָה:<br />\nIf a nega broke out completely upon one who was unclean, he becomes\nclean.

The Rebbe answered based on the pasuk which says that it is natural for a Jew to serve Hashem with his heart, i.e. with love and fear. People were effectively asking</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"why does it not feel natural to love and fear Hashem, and bring that\ndevotion into my service, despite the fact the Torah claims that these\nthings <em>should</em> be natural?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Rebbe wrote Tanya, to help people get to the source of the issue. If a person is finding it hard to love Hashem, there are 2 potential causes. Either the person doesn't understand himself well enough, or he doesn't understand Hashem well enough, as if both of these are in place the love indeed will be natural.</p>\n<p>So the Tanya contains two main sections, Likkutei Amarim, which is also called \"Sefer Shel Benoni\", which aims at introducing a Jew to his soul, and his true potential, and what such a soul and potential's mission in this world is. In this section, we also learn lots about Hashem, as well His personal purpose in creating.</p>\n<p>The other main section is Shaar HaYichud VeHaEmuna, which is all about Hashem. If a person doesn't love Hashem, it's because the picture one has of Him is an unlovable one, so the Rebbe reintroduces us to Hashem, bringing into down to earth language everything the philosophers and kabbalists debated and ironed out over the preceding 1,000 years about Hashem, how great He is, how close He is, how much He loves us, and as Rabbi Friedman shows many times over his lectures, how much He needs us.</p>\n<p>There are two more sections to the Tanya as well, if the above is not enough, that take things even deeper and answer even more amazing questions about Hashem and our souls.</p>\n<p>I would recommend learning all of Tanya with some sort of class that connects to you, rather than just trying to read it for yourself. There's so much more to get out of it when it is taught by a loving student of the Chabad school who can bring it all together, as well as fill in gaps and give context and add additional teachings and developments from the 7 generations of Chabad Rebbeim who have discussed it.</p>\n<p><sup>* Rabbi Manis Friedman.

    "content": "# How to learn Tosefta\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>For those that do, could you share how you learn(ed) Tosefta? How do you fit it into your learning program of Mishna/Gemara?</p>\n<p>Also, what edition of the Tosefta do you use? The ones published at the end of the masechet of gemara (many publications)? If not, what are you using? Which would you recommend?</p>\n<p>Any other thoughts in this matter are more than welcome.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As a preface, I have never made a full study of Tosafta on its own. The way I have learned it was to simply look up every single ברייתא that the Gemara quotes. This methodology leads one to have an intimate knowledge of מדרש הלכה and Tosefta. Since every quote has its context, you would then need to learn the surrounding Toseftas and/or מדרשי הלכה. The direct result of this is that you will A) learn Tosefta and B) you will see <em>much more</em> how the Gemara was constructed (sometimes there is an entire amud of Gemara which is simply a block quote of מדרש הלכה, which is the basis for the ensuing discussion).</p>\n<p>As for editions: The Vilna edition, which morphed into the Oz Vehadar edition, is fine. But that is all it is. There are better ones than that. One of the classics is the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/21360\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חסדי דוד</a>, Rav David Pardo (he also wrote a commentary on Sifrei). Another classic, written slightly more recently, is <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/47526\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חזון יחזקאל</a>, by Rav Yechezkel Abramsky. This commentary is split into the \"girsaos\" section and the \"Tosafos style\" commentary. Highly recommended.</p>\n<p>However, the absolute best Tosefta BY FAR is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Lieberman#External_links\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta KiFshuta, by Saul Lieberman</a>. (I am aware that he was a faculty member at JTS, and many people have remarked that such a Talmid Chacham would work there. There's even a book entitled \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1589661230\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Saul Lieberman and the Orthodox</a>\" by Marc Shapiro. However. קבל את האמת ממי שאמרו.) There is no better commentary on Tosefta.</p>\n<p>This sefer is split in two - The \"Tosefta\" section, which follows the Vienna Manuscript (with emendations from \"כתב יד ערפרט\"). It includes brief textual emendations (aka שינוי נוסחות), a brief commentary, and מראה מקומות. Each seder is one volume. The next section is the \"תוספתא כפשוטה\" part. This is an <em>extremely</em> thorough commentary on every single line of Tosefta, which perforce is a commentary on how both the Bavli and Yerushalmi quote them.</p>\n<p>This commentary, as well as the edition of the Tosefta edited by Saul Lieberman, ends at Maseches Bava Basra. The edition of Tosefta, but not the commentary, was completed by <a href=\"https://www.hamadaf-y.co.il/%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%92%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%90-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%93-%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%92%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%90-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%AA%D7%90-%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91-%D7%99%D7%93-%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%92-%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9D/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machon Mishor</a>, who printed Tosefta from Maseches Makkos until the end, based on כ׳׳י וינה. (For some reason, the volume on the second half of Seder Nezikin is impossible to find.)</p>\n<p>One last edition of Tosefta worth mentioning is the <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/20419\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zukermandl</a>. This was the first \"critical edition\", based mostly on כ׳׳י ערפרט, with some <em>very</em> brief הגהות. One benefit to this edition is that it is just one volume, and includes all of Tosefta.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I have just found out that <a href=\"https://tosefta.alhatorah.org/Full/Berakhot/1.1#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta K'Fshuta</a> can be found in digital form on alhatorah.org.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I find learning the Tosefta in conjunction with the Mishnah to be an extremely rewarding experience. The Tosefta often preserves the \"raw materials\" from which the Mishnah was edited (and these passages can be seen as the earliest recorded version of the oral tradition), and also contains many of the explanations of the terse verbiage of the Mishnah that are incorporated as building blocks into the two Talmudim. Studying the two together heightens both the appreciation of the Mishnah as a literary masterpiece and Rebbi's genius as its compiler, and also allows one to peer beneath the Mishnah's veil, as it were, to uncover many treasures that would have been lost had the Tosefta not been passed down. It is in fact a minor miracle that the Tosefta has survived at all.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend Oz Vehadar's Murcheves edition, which contains a beautiful and user-friendly edition of the Tosefta in the back of every volume. It is arranged in Tzuras HaDaf style, with major commentaries surrounding the Tosefta, and additional commentaries (such as Chisdei David) on the margins. It also features Masorat HaTosefta (cross-referencing all of Chazal), Ein Mishpat (cross-referencing the major codes of halacha), and most valuably (for me), variant manuscript readings and the GR\"A's emendations. Considering how few people really delve into the Tosefta (sadly), the fact that Oz Vehadar made such a supreme effort to prepare an attractive Tosefta is worth applauding.</p>\n<p>In your case, since you already have your own set of Shas, you may want to consider purchasing just the <a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Oz-Vehadar-Edition-Talmud-Yerushalmi-Murchevet--Volume-25-Seder-Zeraim__p-14847.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeraim</a> and/or Taharos volumes of Murcheves, which contain all of the Mishnayos and Toseftas for those orders (except Berachos and Niddah). What I do is go through the Mishnah at my pace (generally 2 a day) and then once I finish the tractate and it is relatively fresh in my mind, I flip to the back and do the Tosefta for that tractate.</p>\n<p>It also is enjoyable to do this in preparation for learning a masechta of Gemara, as you can sometimes predict which direction the discussion will go if you know where the ambiguities in the Mishnah lie, and where the Tosefta clarifies or adds layers to a question arising from the Mishnah.</p>\n<p>I do think it's best to learn the Tosefta sequentially, rather than in a subordinate manner (i.e., as though the Tosefta were merely footnotes to the Mishnah), because there is a clear thought process associated with it, and it is very much its \"own\" work -- Rabbi Chiyya and Rabbi Oshaiah (who are credited with its redaction not only by Chazal but also by the weight of modern scholarship) had their own methodology and flair for juxtaposition, which is easily lost if not read in sequence. And although it can get tedious at times, given its length, there are many gems scattered throughout that will surprise and delight you if you do stick with it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rebbi Abbahu descended to Tiberias. The students of Rebbi Joḥanan saw that his face was shiny. They said before Rebbi Joḥanan, Rebbi Abbahu found a treasure. He asked them, why? They told him, his face is shiny. He said to them, maybe he understood a new teaching. He came to visit him. He asked him, what new teaching did you hear? He said, an old Tosephta.

This is likely due to the second vowel (after the /l/) having been elided at some point after Aramaic ceased being spoken, but before the Tiberian Masoretes vocalized the Kaddish prayer. According to the rules of Shva, either the elision shouldn't have occured, or the preceding Kamatz should have been converted to a Patach, or even to a Kamatz Kattan! Yet, such is not the case.

However, is there any information as to what vegetables Adam was permitted to eat, specifically whether Adam was allowed to eat root and underground vegetables such as potatoes, garlic, onions etc.?</p>\n<p>EDIT: Found <a href=\"https://www.bayrobertssda.org/Gods_appointed_diet.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one non-Jewish website</a> which says (no sources though):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let us understand what it was. \"Behold, I have given you every herb [a plant without a strong woody stem or trunk] bearing seed\" is generally understood to mean grains (wheat, oats, corn, rice, rye, barley, millet, etc.), seeds (sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, sesame, flax, etc.), legumes (soybeans, kidney beans, lentils, split peas, peanuts, etc.), and other foods containing seed, some of which we call vegetables today (eggplant, bell pepper, pumpkins, cucumbers, tomatoes, okra, squash, melons, etc.). \". . . and every tree [plant with a strong woody stem such as a shrub, bush, or tree], in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed.\" This is generally understood to mean fruits (oranges, lemons, cranberries, apples, pears, mangos, strawberries, dates, cherries, blueberries, bananas, coconut, avocados, olives, etc.), and nuts (almonds, pecans, cashews, walnuts, chestnuts, pine nuts, brazil, etc.). The green plants of the field were the food for the animals and birds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then after the sin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After Adam and Eve sinned God told them, \"Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb [plants] of the field.\" Gen. 3:18. Now God instructed man to also eat of the plants of the field, which originally was given for the animals to eat. This is generally understood to mean leafy, flower, and root vegetables (lettuce, spinach, parsley, fennel, beets, brussels sprouts, watercress, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, turnips, potatoes, garlic, onions, etc.). This was very wise on God's part because many of the vegetables contain medicinal properties that are necessary to sustain us in a sinful, polluted world. This new diet was God's appointed diet for man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wonder if this can be verified from Jewish texts.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.29?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.1.29.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> provides examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>את כל עשב זרע זרע <strong>כגון תבואה וקטנית</strong> ופירות האילן אלו הן למאכל אדם אבל לכל חית השדה נתתי את כל ירק עשב כגון כרוב תרדין וכיוצא בהן וכשחטא אדם נגזר עליו לאכול עשב שנאמר וקוץ ודרדר וגו׳‎ ואכלת את עשב השדה הוא שנאמר נמשל כבהמות נדמו שאם הותר לו בשר אם כן מצינו חוטא נשכר</p>\n<p>את כל עשב זורע זרע, “all the herbs that perpetuate themselves by shedding their seed.” <strong>Examples are grains and vegetables such as peas and beans (lit. legumes)</strong>, etc; as well as the fruit of the trees which contain stones or pips. All these were intended as food for the human race. The beasts of the field were assigned only simpler herbs, i.e. grass that did not perpetuate itself by shedding their seeds. As a result of man’s sin, G-d decreed that they would be limited to eating the same kind of food as did the animals. This is the deeper meaning of the verse in Genesis 3,18: קוץ ודרדר תצמיח לך ואכלת את עשב השדה, “the earth will grow thorns and thistles in (response to your efforts) so that you will be reduced to eating the grass of the field.” This is also reflected in Psalms 49,21: “he is like the beasts (that perish)”. If G-d had permitted man at that stage to eat meat, it would have been viewed as man being rewarded for having sinned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.29?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Malbim_on_Genesis.1.29.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> echoes this sentiment also saying \"כגון התבואה והקטניות\".</p>\n\n\n",

[Deut. 8:16]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We heard that earlier [Ex. 16:4].  Rashi says the test was whether the Israelites would follow the directions about gathering manna: First, not storing any of it for the next day, and second, collecting a double portion before Shabbat, but none on Shabbat.  Sforno says that the test is: Will the Jews still follow the Torah when they do not have to worry about their livelihood?  The Ramban says the opposite: God wanted to force them to live from day to day, to see if they would keep their faith even under conditions of uncertainty about the next day.</p>\n<p>But if the manna “test” is really whether we would still be observant when our needs are met (or are uncertain), one would expect the phrase “to test you” to be repeated every time God gave us something: Water in the desert, freedom from slavery, a guide to the Promised Land, victory in battle, etc.  But it is not repeated.

In particular, <strong>the basis</strong> for the commentary we received must always be established (in this case, the Divrei Hayamim account would put Achazyahu older than his father, so the Torah is in no uncertain terms <em>telling us</em> that there is a commentary to go with this verse), and held up against logic and the rest of the body of Torah and commentary in totality.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/136243/more-contradictions-in-the-torah#comment453677_136244\">Assumption 2</a></strong>: <strong>The Torah is concerned people might think it is false so it tries to ensure no contradictions.</strong></p>\n<p>Also generally false. הָרוֹצֶה לִטְעוֹת יִטְעֶה - let those who wish to err, err (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.8.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabba 8:8</a>) The Torah is not in the business of proving itself. It could have told us exactly what date Mt. Vesuvius was going to erupt, or predict a comet, or tell us how many moons Neptune has, or a billion other things. The Torah takes care to be consistent and thoroughly <em>true</em> in everything it says (including a lot of prophecies), but it's clear that it is written and addressed to those who already believe it is Divine, and makes little effort to capture people who don't believe that with proofs etc. As to why this is, you'd have to ask in a separate question, but note well from this that just because there are puzzling verses in the Torah, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/136243/more-contradictions-in-the-torah#comment453684_136244\">it doesn't mean that the Torah is not perfect</a>, and instead this means that it wants us to think about it, as well as engage with the Oral Tradition to find out more. One of the reasons the commentary was left as an Oral Tradition, and the Written Torah is so impenetrable by itself is indeed in order to foster a more active and hands-on relationship with the Torah.</p>\n<p>After thinking about it and studying further, we will resolve our contradictions. As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/136236/contradiction-in-the-torah-please-explain-this-i-have-heard-many-times-that-a/136248#comment453694_136248\">MichoelR points out</a>, we have a rule:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(יג) וְכֵן (נ\"א וְכַאן) שְׁנֵי כְתוּבִים הַמַּכְחִישִׁים זֶה אֶת זֶה, עַד שֶׁיָּבֹא הַכָּתוּב הַשְּׁלִישִׁי וְיַכְרִֽיעַ בֵּינֵיהֶם. \"When two verses contradict each another, one should seek a third verse that reconciles them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As with any field of logical study, if we are seeing a contradiction in a system that is supposed to not have contradictions, the answer is we have not got enough information yet to reconcile the contradictions. Take the example of Newton's belief that his rules of gravity would not stabilise the orbits of the planets - Jupiter should pull planets out of their orbits every time they pass it. He thought <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Isaac_Newton#God_as_masterful_creator\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">G-d must be keeping things stable through Divine intervention</a>. Laplace brought in the \"third\" idea to reconcile this contradiction: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance#Laplace_resonance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">orbital resonance</a>. The same applies to Torah of course, which Truth.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/136243/31534\">Assumption 3</a></strong>: <strong>The Torah is (at least where relevant) a factual history book.</strong></p>\n<p>Again, generally false. If you read Torah, Prophets and Writings, especially with Rashi, you'll get a feel for what this Divine work is trying to do. It's <strong>not</strong> trying to be a history book, and again, you don't need a Rabbi or commentary to tell you this. Just read Bereshit and see how it's not telling us a history, with so much skipped; so much context left out; note the switches in chronological order without mention; note the brevity of everything (yet lots of odd repetition and interesting phraseology, a clear sign that there is a supplemental tradition). It is clear that the Torah is being very selective in its wisdom. Everything written is something we need to know for some timeless reason, and the commentary is there to give us that reason.</p>\n<p>This is even true of Kings and Chronicles, which ostensibly come across as attempts at historical accounts. They are only to the degree of what parts of our history, morally, need to be preserved for timeless reasons. Therefore, if left out information from a story will make it sound like a contradiction, it won't mind so much, because it expects you to realise that there might be missing information (because it contains no timeless lesson), and it expects you to go and look in the Oral Tradition.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally, the assumption of</strong> \"I have heard many times that a divine book can not contradict\". This, really, is what you should be asking as its own question. We generally hold that a divine book should be <strong>true</strong> (which is why the basis is important). Even that statement, as well as the one about not contradicting, is something that requires in-depth discussion to see what it means. These are lofty philosophical concepts and are dealt with at length <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/136243/more-contradictions-in-the-torah#comment453689_136244\">in countless places</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Any discrepancy in the Torah must have a commentary alongside it that explains it, and the explanation itself must hold up with some sort of logical basis, which has been traced back to Sinai, as well as analysed by our generational scholars. Indeed if there were any critical contradiction in Torah that had no commentary, or a commentary that had zero basis (which involves a trace of where it originates, logical analysis, grammatical rules, limited and consistent traditional exegetical rules i.e. extremely sound scholarship), we'd have more of a problem. However, asking to resolve a contradiction in the Torah without any reference to commentary is not in keeping with the Torah's own expectations of validity.</p>\n<p>This, by the way makes this question off topic for Mi Yodeya, as it is expecting Mi Yodeya to conform to a standard that is not in keeping with general traditional Judaism, and answer based on that standard. This is why your first question got upvoted, but the next two have since been downvoted, because by that point it became clear you do not wish to hear an answer referencing commentaries. It would be better to simply ask as its own question <strong>What does Judaism say about what I've heard in that \"a divine book can not contradict\"</strong>. You can mention these 3 contradictions there and how they prompted you to ask this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Metzudat_David_on_II_Kings.8.26.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meztudas Dovid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ralbag_on_II_Kings.8.26.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Ralbag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_II_Kings.8.26.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Malbim</a> and others all quote the Seder Olam that explains that he was 22 years old.

Some features that commentaries often include are regarding resolution of alleged contradictions by drawing from multiple texts as a totality, trying to highlight important and interesting facts from the text that often get missed by many and have implications in certain contexts, and much more. I don't think that, for example, Rashi is adding any new meaning or text here, G-d forbid, but is instead is highlighting what is often implicit within the context of the Torah and the Jewish tradition. In the long run, I think that a good commentary can only be of help and enrich your understanding, and Rashi's and Radak's commentaries have a high reputation in Jewish circles so it wouldn't be bad to get acquainted with them.</p>\n\n\n",

However, a small drop has been revealed to us by the Ari Hakodesh T'zl through his student R' Chaim Vital T'zl, in Shaar Hagilgulim, and the souls of the less worthy are able to become attached to the souls of the wholly righteous, thus attaining eternal life through them.

    "content": "# Do the sages explain why humans and land animals were created after birds and fish?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Genesis states that on the 5th day, G-d created all sea creatures and flying birds.</p>\n<p>After this, G-d creates all land animals and then Adam, who is given the responsibility of overseeing the whole of creation as a tender.</p>\n<p><strong>Do the sages explain why G-d distinguished the animals that fly and swim from land animals and Adam?</strong></p>\n<p>From a human perspective, animals are animals. While they all have different traits and qualities, the fact that G-d created a separate day for creating those of the sea and air makes me think it was meant to send a specific message regarding their natures and their qualities.</p>\n<p>Could it be related to the fact that humans cannot fly or breathe underwater? Is G-d essentially categorizing each to a domain of their natures, hence why humans were grouped with other land animals with whom we share a habitat?</p>\n<p>I have a second question as well: How could Adam have had true ability to oversee animals that fly and swim if he existed in a domain separate from them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It seems that you have two questions: First, \"Why weren't all types of animals (mammals/birds/fish/swarming creatures) created on the same day, and the creation of humans reserved for a day of its own?\" Second, \"How can humans control birds and fish if we occupy different domains?\"</p>\n<p>As for question one, as you hint, the answer can be explained by the fact that humans and animals both occupy the land. This is expressed by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Radak_on_Genesis.1.24.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a>, who says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויאמר אלהים תוצא הארץ, ביום הששי נבראו חיות היבשה עם האדם, כי שניהם ביבשה. \"And God said, Let the earth bring forth [living creatures] (Gen. 1:24)\": On the sixth day both the mammals and man were created, seeing both of them inhabit the dry land on the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah groups \"like\" with \"like,\" and given the order of creation, in which the major separations involve the division of the heavens from the earth and the dry land from seas, so too the Biblical creation of animals follows these divisions.</p>\n<p>And we see elsewhere that the Torah often applies similar rules to humans and land animals -- for example, in redemption of the first born (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ex. 13:12-15</a>), in the disqualification of sacrifices as well as Kohanim with blemishes (both treated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.22.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev. 22</a>), and in the juxtaposition of <em>arayos</em> involving humans and animals (as well as kilayim with animals) in Lev. 18-20, see esp. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev. 18:23-24</a>. In all of these cases, humans and land animals belong to the same classification.</p>\n<p>As for the second question, how can humans have dominion over the fish and the birds, this statement comes immediately after God says, \"Let us make man in our image\" -- just as God has dominion over all creatures, so is man imbued with that capacity (albeit to a lesser degree) (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.1.26.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or HaChaim</a>). However, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kli_Yakar_on_Genesis.1.26.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kli Yakar</a> notes that the verse is nuanced such that the dominion over the air/sea is less than that over the land, and also points out that the root of <em>dominion</em> (\"veyirdu\") is the same as <em>descent</em> (\"yeridah\"), such that humans can merit to have more control, or less control, over the these domains, based upon their actions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Even better, at least one sage says we don't need to take this part of the Scripture literally in the first place. In Guide to the Perplexed Part 2.17 Maimonides (Rambam) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We therefore do not reject as impossible the opinion of those who say\nthat the heavens were produced before the earth, or the reverse, or\nthat the heavens have existed without stars, or that certain species\nof animals have been in existence, and others not. For the state of\nthe whole Universe when it came into existence may be compared with\nthat of animals when their existence begins; the heart evidently\nprecedes the testicles, the veins are in existence before the bones;\nalthough, when the animal is fully developed, none of the parts is\nmissing which is essential to its existence. This remark is not\nsuperfluous, if the Scriptural account of the Creation be taken\nliterally; in reality, it cannot be taken literally, as will be shown\nwhen we shall treat of this subject.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>If I may be permitted a pun, Rambam said that that the order of creation, although written in the Torah, is not exactly written in stone.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to Rabbenu Bachaya on 1:24, based on Bereshit Rabba 7:7, man was created on the same day as the land animals because the phrase \"נפש חיה\" (living soul) on the 6th day, in pasuk 24, is not the same as the phrase \"נפש חיה\" in from the 5th day in pasuk 20. Flying and sea creatures, it seems, are not the same level of life force as land animals. They are one step closer to plant life, and the חיה is referring predominantly to the fact that they can move. חיה regarding land animals is referring to a more complex life form, and one of the differences brought by our Rabbi is that it has a connotation of <em>intelligent</em> life. To put it simply, birds and fish are not considered fully fledged <em>animals</em>, and the collective living soul of animals, of which humans have a share, was created on the 6th day.</p>\n<p>However, this is not enough of an understanding as the truth is, humans may share a part of themselves with the animal world, but they are their own category altogether, and were made in the second half of the day. Indeed, man is \"made\" by God, <em>together</em> with the earth, whereas the animals, fish and birds were \"brought forth\" from the earth.</p>\n\n\n",

(after weight loss)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While compliments like this might seem harmless at face value, would it also be problematic from the mindset it may cause someone to become more aware or obsessed with their physical appearance?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Based on this Dvar Torah <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oc6PJ35BEXmDwD337XUNv42RymaNGMiO/view?usp=drive_link\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I wrote</a>, with ideas and sources there, I would conclude that the problem you mention is real, and there is a solution.</p>\n<p>The root cause that this would make them feel self conscious is because it carries the message that the superficial parts of them are all people care about. This implies that they themself are irrelevant, and that makes them feel alone.</p>\n<p>The solution is to give the compliment in a way that does not imply that. This might not need to be overt: if the person you are talking to knows that <em>they themself</em> are unconditionally important to you, then it would be rare that they would feel self conscious from a compliment from you. If they don't have that impression, then one will need to find a way to show them that they are what matters, not the \"things about them\", and thus <em>because</em> <strong>they</strong> matter to you, the things about them <em>thus</em> matter to you too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You’ve got lots of nice things about you, because you are amazing,\nbut it’s not those things that I like about you. I just like you!”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the Dvar Torah for more discussion and examples of this, but generally speaking this is an art that each person should develop, and the first step in that is to solidify in their mind that people are someones, not somethings, and develop a sensitivity to the infinite preciousness of people, and the infinite vanity of \"things\".</p>\n<p>I.e. study lots of Torah. Rabbi Manis Friedman also teaches this message a lot, and if one watches many of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkB28NTo_OxXTYjCUv7m5Q\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his lectures</a> alongside their learning, one will certainly absorb the point deeply.

This is a reference to the entire Eretz Yisrael</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wouldn't necessarily pin these passages on a particular event. It is a general principle, and this comes out in the commentaries on this verse which I will bring: <strong>that explain that the fulfilment is that generally when Benei Yisrael are in the land, it is a land flowing with milk and honey; fertile, arable etc. When they are ejected from the land for their sins, the land becomes basically a big desert</strong> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kedushat_Levi%2C_Deuteronomy%2C_Megillat_Eicha.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kedushat Levi</a>).</p>\n<p>Indeed this is the case. It is legend that when the Jews returned to Israel in the last century or so, they reclaimed the desert and made it fertile again, and the result is this flush of green that is notable from space (see below), in comparison to the surrounding area (I heard this directly from Astronaut <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_A._Hoffman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jeff Hoffman</a> as a child). Before the Jews came back and brought their blessing, as well as hard work in draining the swamps, it was indeed not unlike the rest of the surrounding area of Jordan etc, <em>not</em> green, but quite desolate, a very tough place to live.

For\nif the food is bad, murky, and thick, then the drop will be filthy,\nthick, and murky. Accordingly, it emerges that the food which is\nconsumed before the composition [of the fetus] is its cause, it is a\npreparation for it [the fetus] to be wise or foolish, righteous, or\nwicked. So here into your hands are an instruction that is a great\nkey. Know that since the matter is as we have stated, Hashem may He be\nblessed juxtaposed in His holy Torah the portion of <em>isha ki tazri'a</em>\n(“when a woman conceives”) to <em>maakhaloth assuroth</em> (forbidden foods)\nand said (Leviticus 11) to separate between the pure and impure and\nbetween the <em>hayah</em> (non-domesticated animal) which may be consumed and\nthe <em>hayah</em> which ought not be consumed, and juxtaposed it to <em>isha ki\ntazri'a</em>, and juxtaposed after it the portion of <em>neg'aim</em>\n(blemishes/plagues). And these three portions [correspond] to a\nwonderous secret. And the portion of <em>ki tazri'a</em> is in the middle in\norder to inform you that if a person separates himself from bad foods,\nhe will have children that are proper holy and pure, and if not then\nbehold <em>neg'aim</em> will be anew upon them from the aspect of the drop of\nseed that was from those forbidden and detestable foods. And by means\nof this it comes to inform you that a person needs to also sanctify\nhimself with proper foods close to [the time when one conducts]\nrelations so that his seed will be clean and pure and intermediate\nbetween north and south, as we have said. And here we have informed\nyou that according to the food [one has consumed] will be the blood\nthat contributes to birth, and according to the blood will be the\nseed, and according to the seed will be the fetus born from it. And\nyou already know what I have told you, that an eagle will not come\nfrom a horse and lentils will not come from wheat, and similarly it\nought be said that nothing is born from murky and bad seed except\nblood that is tainted and abominable, as was stated “the wicked are\nastray from the womb” (Psalms 58:4).

    "content": "# Torah Study and Tzitzit\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Sages have said \"The study of Torah is equivalent to all of them [613 Mitzvot].\" (<em>Kedushin 39b</em>)</p>\n<p>I assume that means the reward of Torah study is equal to the reward of doing each individual mitzvah.</p>\n<p>It is stated in regards to Tzitzit in <em>Sefer Bamidbar 15:39</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This shall be fringes for you, and when you see it, you will remember all the commandments of the Lord <strong>to perform them</strong>, and you shall not wander after your hearts and after your eyes after which you are going astray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that reward for Torah study apparently includes the reward for wearing tzitzit.</p>\n<p>But if wearing tzitzit accumulates reward every second, and let’s say that gazing upon tzitzit will cause one to study Torah, <strong>shouldn’t this make the merit/reward of tzitzit greater as it leads one to fulfill all commandments (and refrain from transgressing)?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Shelomo Wolbe zt\"l has a sefer called HaMitzvos haShqulus (The Mitzvos that are Equal\" [in value to all the rest]. In it he looks at the 7 mitzvos that are described as \"keneged kulam -- equal to them all\" and some such, and finds that each epitomizes one of the Torah's primary values.</p>\n<p>On pages 3-5, he lists them:</p>\n<p><strong>1- Denying avodah zarah</strong> (idolatry and other alien worship): \"Whomever denies avodah zarah ascents to the entire Torah. (Sifrei, Shelach)</p>\n<p>This mitzvah teaches the importance of setting values.</p>\n<p><strong>2- Tzitzis</strong>: \"Tzitzis is equal to all the mitzvos.\" (Rashi, Shelach; R Wolbe knew Rashi was quoting a Chazal, I don't know where)</p>\n<p>Tzitzis is typical of the mitzvos that exist to remind us of fundamental truths.</p>\n<p><strong>3- Shabbos</strong>: Why is the portion [in the Torah] of the wood cutter [who cut wood on Shabbos] adjacent to a portion about avodah zarah? TO tell you that someone who [routinely] desocrates the Shabbos [in public] is like an idolater. Because it too is equal to all the mitzvos.\" (Ibid.)</p>\n<p>The sanctity of time. (See #7, Settling Israel)</p>\n<p><strong>4- Torah study</strong>: \"Even all the mitzvos of the Torah are not equal to one concept from the Torah. (Yerushalmi Pei'ah 1:1)</p>\n<p>The importance of wisdom.</p>\n<p><strong>5- Beris Milah</strong>: \"Great is Milah because it is equal to all the mitzvos of the Torah.\" (Nedarim 32a)</p>\n<p>Teaching the importance of mastery and sanctity of the body.</p>\n<p><strong>6- Tzedaqah</strong>: \"And Rav Asi said, 'Tzedaqah is equal to all the mitzvos of the Torah.\" (Bava Basra 9a)</p>\n<p>Demonstrates the importance of the power of giving to living according to the Torah.</p>\n<p><strong>7- Settling the Land of Israel</strong>: \"There was an event involving Rabbi Yehudah ben Beseira, Rabbi Masia ben Chereish, Rabbi Chanina ben Achi, Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Yonasan than they were leaving the Land. They reach Platos, and remembered the Land of Israel. They raised their eyes, shed tears, tore their clothes [in morning], and read the scripture, '...and you will inherit it and dwell and it, and be observant to do...' They said, 'Living in the Land of Israel is equal to all the mitzvos in the Torah.'\" (Sifrei on Devarim 12:99, Yalqut Shim'oni)</p>\n<p>The sanctity of space. (See also #2, Shabbos. Time and space are a pair.)</p>\n<p>Rav Wolbe teaches that the seven combine to give us a complete outline of the Torah's form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn wisdom,</li>\n<li>commit to its values,</li>\n<li>internalize that wisdom and keep it alive in your mind through a discipline of rituals, and</li>\n<li>make your body,</li>\n<li>space and</li>\n<li>time holy by</li>\n<li>consecrating them all to giving to the other.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

I am personally most interested in the last, weakest case and will award the bounty to whoever can answer, but would also be keen to see answers for the other cases.</p>\n<h4>Strong case of immoral conduct</h4>\n<p>A typical example would be a company that is known to use terrible working conditions in what is effectively <a href=\"https://www.antislavery.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/products_of_slavery_and_child_labour_2016.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">slavery</a>. A pretty uncontroversial example is the <a href=\"https://antislavery.ac.uk/items/show/51\" rel=\"noreferrer\">granite counter-top industry</a>, or the <a href=\"https://hir.harvard.edu/taken-hostage-in-the-uae/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">construction industry in Dubai</a>.</p>\n<h4>Case of conduct antithetical to Torah hashkafa</h4>\n<p>Another example might be a company who donates to causes that are not aligned with Torah, such as gay marriage, late term abortion, transition surgery for minors.</p>\n<h4>More subtle cases of political issues</h4>\n<p>More subtle examples might be companies that support a political party that is anti-Israel, or in favour of anti-Torah policies, or who deplatform Jewish or Torah-aligned speakers (for their alignment with Torah) or who themselves boycott Jewish institutions or Israel; companies that pollute and wreck the climate or don't pay tax, or it has been claimed that they discriminate against race and sex etc. I.e. things that can get quite political, and we can't really be completely sure what is really going on, in today's crazy political confusion.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>What is the halacha for doing legitimate business with such companies? How exactly should we arrive at the conclusion of which companies are aligned with Torah and which are not?</p>\n<p>NOTE: I am not looking for an itemized list of all possible evils a company can partake in and a yes/no for each - the examples given are just to help explain the question. I am looking for general support/lack of support and discussion regarding the principles of doing business with immoral businesses, to whatever level of detail is available.

Basically regarding money in general one ought to consider where the money comes from, which is a pure, clear, light, and consequently where it goes to, and be conscientious to the extent possible. And this not possible unless one repairs his Berit, sexual craving, which is the root of the the cravings: reproduction, income, and food.</p>\n<p>Likutei Etzot - Mamon u'parnasah</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>\"There is also another <strong>rectification for the craving (taavah) for money</strong>, which is <strong>to look at the root from which all money and its influences come.</strong> Through contemplating this, one's desire is nullified, for there in its root, all the influx is pure, clear light, and spiritual pleasure, and there is no desire except for that which is connected to holiness. And who is foolish enough to abandon spiritual pleasure and take material pleasure in its place? But this contemplation is impossible to achieve until one rectifies their covenant, as it is written, 'And from my flesh, I behold my God,' for at the outset, one must rectify the holy flesh, and then they can look upon Godliness. And for this reason, the essence of the rectification of the craving for money is through the covenant, and when one rectifies their covenant, it is impossible to fall back into the craving for money\" (Likutei Moharan, 23:5).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

The Rama says that today since we do not have proper kavana anyway, we do not go back:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המתפלל צריך שיכוין בכל הברכות ואם אינו יכול לכוין בכולם לפחות יכוין באבות אם לא כיון באבות אע\"פ שכיון בכל השאר יחזור ויתפלל: הגה (והאידנא אין חוזרין בשביל חסרון כוונה שאף בחזרה קרוב הוא שלא יכוין אם כן למה יחזור) (טור):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Biur Halacha (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.101.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vs “haidnah”</a>) wonders if the person is still before the end of the second bracha, if he should go back or continue. Since according to the letter of the law he isn’t yotzei, by continuing he’s making a bracha lvatala, however he says the Chaya Adam seems to disagree with this issue. He then concludes that the best solution is to wait for the chazzan repetition, listen and have kavana, and then proceed. Perhaps this idea can work in your case as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאידנא אין חוזרין וכו' -  לכאורה כונתו אם סיים השמ\"ע ולא כיון באבות אבל אם עומד אצל אתה גבור ונזכר שלא כיון באבות כיון דמצד הדין לא יצא בזה האיך נאמר לו שיברך עוד ברכות שלא יצא בהם אחרי דחסר לו ברכת אבות וכי מפני שקרוב שלא יכוין נאמר לו שיברך עוד ברכות שבודאי לא יצא בהם כן היה נראה לי אבל מדברי הח\"א כלל כ\"ד דין ב' משמע דאינו חוזר אפילו עומד אצל אתה גבור ויותר נ\"ל עצה אחרת באופן זה שלא יאמר עוד עתה כלל וימתין על הש\"ץ שיאמר ברכת אבות ויכוין לצאת וכשיגיע הש\"ץ לברכת אתה גבור יתחיל בעצמו דהלא בתפלה קי\"ל דאינו מוציא אלא דוקא מי שאינו בקי משא\"כ באבות כיון שאינו יכול לברך אותה בעצמו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your idea of retroactive kavana is mentioned by R’ Chaim Kanievski in Siach Sadeh (vol 3, Brachos 13B) where he says in the name of the Chazon Ish that if he didn’t start yet the second bracha he should have kavana without repeating the words and that is counted as well. However, he says it is apparent from the Biur Halacha that he didn’t agree with this solution, since he didn’t mention it.</p>\n<p>It would seem from all this, that having retroactive kavana is a machlokes if it works. However, even those who say it works, it is only before he started the next bracha. Once you are beyond that, it seems that it wouldn’t work even according to the Chazon Ish.</p>\n<p>This is also discussed in a case where someone didn’t have kavana in the first passuk of Shema. In that instance, R’ Chaim Kanievski (in Daas Noteh page 198) says that the same machlokes would apply, and he clearly says that the Chazon Ish only allows it before starting the next passuk. (Interestingly, in that case, R’ Shmuel Wosner in Shevet Halevi 10:16 says retroactive kavana can work from the end of a passuk or bracha to the beginning, but not once you finish)</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes,see Halichos Shlomo (psakim of Rav Shlomo Zalmen Aurbach) pages 98,99,& 100. He explains that if one forgot to have kavana for Avos and remembers in the midst of shmoneh esrei ,even though we do not go back and daven,nevertheless ,since from the din perspective one should go back to the beginning they should be noheg like the Chazon Ish who held one should have kavana in their mind from what they missed and then continue on .</p>\n\n\n",

In other words can I write a cheque with my left hand on Shabbos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Torah prohibited labor done in a normal way. Violating that, someone would have to bring a sacrifice. (Thus, \"liable.\") If someone did it in an abnormal way, they are thus \"exempt\" from the sacrifice.</p>\n<p>The Rabbis (about 2200 years ago, very loosely) realized that if people thought <em>hooray, I'll spend all of Sabbath with loopholes, doing all sorts of labor in abnormal fashions!</em>, then the spirit of the day would be lost, and what's more, people would eventually do labor the normal way too. Therefore they prohibited labor in an abnormal fashion.</p>\n<p>If you spend some more time with Maimonides' code, you'll see there are actually three levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Liable.\" - Prohibited by the Torah.</li>\n<li>\"Exempt.\" - Not prohibited by the Torah, so no sacrifice is incurred for violation, but the Rabbis prohibited it.</li>\n<li>\"Permitted\" - Actually allowed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(If you hop over to his laws on divorce, he uses a similar shorthand. The divorce ritual could be <em>void</em>, meaning it doesn't even meet the Torah's definition of a proper divorce; or merely <em>flawed</em>, that it didn't meet the higher standard imposed by the Rabbis.)</p>\n<p>So no, don't go about writing checks with your non-dominant hand.</p>\n<p>Where it <em>does</em> come up is a situation where someone has to write because of a matter of life and death -- say you show up at the emergency room, and they demand you sign some paperwork. (They don't care how sloppily you sign.) Then signing with your non-dominant hand would be vastly preferable to doing so with your dominant hand, as the prohibition is a lesser one.</p>\n<p>A famous rabbi's son was preparing to be drafted into Czarist Russia's army. His father had him study Maimonides' Code, precisely because it helps delineate between the minor and major violations. There was no way the fellow would be able to keep \"normal civilian Sabbath\" in the army, but this way he'd be able to keep his violations to the minimum.</p>\n\n\n",

Those thinking about, or planning to, convert to Judaism.</p>\n<p>b.) Attending a Jewish colleague's lifecycle event (e.g. their kid's bar mitzvah).</p>\n<p>c.)

(This is not in his formal responsa, but the notes from his personal secretary.) He replied that if we tell them <strong>NO YOU MAY NOT!!</strong>, it will only cause more intrigue (or enmity, or both). He suggested to tell them \"there's really not that much to see\", but if they really want to show up, eh, fine whatever.</p>\n<p>(He's right, by the way. It's not that exciting. Check out a Hebrew/English prayer book such as the Artscroll <a href=\"https://worldcat.org/title/29178099\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> [black</a> or <a href=\"https://worldcat.org/title/32151932\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brown</a> edition, essentially the same] or <a href=\"https://worldcat.org/title/988622163\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Koren</a> translations; if you don't want to buy one, many libraries have them. Most of the service will be people reading quietly out of those, in Hebrew. Then find a Jewish translation of the Five Books of Moses; we read about a hundred verses of that per week in the Hebrew.)</p>\n<p>Noahides -- non-Jews who follow Judaism's prescriptions for them -- can pray anywhere. The whole point of a synagogue is communal prayer, which requires ten Jews (so it's not really something Noahides need), and reading Jewish Scripture (again, not really something Noahides need). Noahides would certainly praise God for sustaining life, but not for sanctifying the Sabbath (as that's something they actually should not be keeping).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Jewish prayer is often modeled on precedents from the sacrificial system described in the Bible. One can see in Numbers 15:14 the idea of a non-Israelite bringing a burnt offering as a sacrifice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And when, throughout the ages, a stranger who has taken up residence with you, or one who lives among you, would present an offering by fire of pleasing odor to the LORD - as you do, so shall it be done by the rest of the congregation. There shall be one law for you and for the resident stranger; it shall be a law for all time throughout the ages. You and the stranger shall be alike before the LORD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today, we no longer offer sacrifices of meat or grain, but instead we offer up prayers from our hearts. In this endeavor, it is also appropriate to allow a Gentile of honest intentions to join us in praying to G-d.</p>\n<p>As to whether it is encouraged or discouraged, this is more of a sociological question and the answer will vary according to the community you are in. Some synagogues go out of their way to welcome Gentiles and to facilitate their praying with a Jewish congregation. Other synagogues are indifferent to the matter and may allow a visitor, but will not particularly encourage them. At other places, a Gentile might feel actively discouraged from participating or even viewing.</p>\n<p>This range of responses has to do more with history, intercommunity relations, and who makes up a particular community than it does with formal legal standards or theology. I can only recommend that if you want to observe or participate with a Jewish congregation at prayer, you try to find one who finds your presence at a minimum to be tolerable.</p>\n\n\n",

A specific belief / midrash is that Eliyahu is present at a brit milah. Yet, I look and I don't see him. How can this midrash be literally true, when it contradicts our senses?</p>\n<p>A ready answer is that within the framework of this midrash, Eliyahu is invisible, despite possessing a physical body. You can listen to this short shiur by Rabbi Stuart Halpern about <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/902407\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pinchas as an invisible spy</a>.</p>\n<p>As background, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.2.4?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 2:4</a> states about Rachav hiding the spies, who midrashically are Pinchas and Kalev:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תִּקַּ֧ח הָאִשָּׁ֛ה אֶת־שְׁנֵ֥י הָאֲנָשִׁ֖ים וַֽתִּצְפְּנ֑וֹ וַתֹּ֣אמֶר ׀ כֵּ֗ן בָּ֤אוּ אֵלַי֙ הָאֲנָשִׁ֔ים וְלֹ֥א יָדַ֖עְתִּי מֵאַ֥יִן הֵֽמָּה׃\nAnd the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I know not from where they were:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The language is strange because vatitzpino is the singular, she hid <strong>him</strong>, rather than them. Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And she hid them. There are scriptural verses that speak of the plural as if it were singular. Since she was in a hurry to hide them and she hid them in a narrow place it was as though they were one person. The Midrash of Rabbi Tanchuma states ‘That these two men were Pinchos and Caleiv, and Pinchos stood before them but they did not see him because he was [invisible] like an angel.’ Another interpretation: She hid each of them separately. We find a similar verse: ‘Oil and incense gladden the heart’ and it does not say יְשַׂמְחוּ לֵב, in the plural.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we know that Pinchas can make himself invisible. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/parsha/is-pinchas-really-eliyahu/2014/07/11/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">many midrashim</a> say that Pinchas and Eliyahu are the same person. When Pinchas was rewarded with <em>berit kehunat olam</em>, that was not dying and indeed becoming Eliyahu HaNavi.</p>\n<p>So, a physical Eliyahu can be present, just not visible.</p>\n\n\n",

But I cannot fathom how we could apply this concept when we have so many Dead Sea Scrolls with so many variants.

I have no objection to that methodology, I sometimes will read the Samaritan Torah to see what insights might be gained. But if the community of Qumran believed in having and preserving multiple variants of texts, it means that you can't extract a single authoritative text from the variants.

The list can go on and on.</p>\n<p>But after the exile we see a whole new level of religiosity and classes of people such as Ezra the scribe. Suddenly we can't intermingle with the Samaritans and we have to be separate from them. Now for the first time we are instituting public readings of scripture for Holidays and it's not clear the people hearing it have heard these words before. And if I had to guess, the censoring of the divine name started with Ezra and these public readings. And my further guess would be that both Pharisees and Sadduccees would inherit their traditions from here.</p>\n<p>Note: This answer is opinion based and unsourced.</p>\n\n\n",

This is the secret by which a person’s sons wear it after him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's also dive deeper into this subject on why clothing influences the person wearing it.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Pesach Eliyahu Falk in his sefer <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0873068742\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oz Vehadar Levusha: Modesty: An Adornment for Life</a> writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In contrast, bad clothes have a detrimental and injurious effect on their wearer. They diffuse an impurity which is transmitted to the person wearing them. The Chasam Sofer writes that Yaakov, who always only the truth, would have found it very difficult if not impossible to deviate from the truth and say אָנֹכִי֙ עֵשָׂ֣ו בְּכֹרֶ֔ךָ - \"I am Esav, your firstborn\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bereishis 27:19)</a>. To help him overcome this difficulty, Rivka advised him to dress in the clothes of his wicked brother Esav.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Falk goes on to explain that a person is aware at all times, of the clothes he wears and is reminded by them of the allegiance that is implied by the clothes he wears. If a person wears clothes that are refined, that person is reminded that he/she has undertaken to conduct him/herself in a tznius way.</p>\n<p>The same idea can be found in the way the Kohanim cloth themselves during their avoda in the Beis HaMikdash. Rabbi Falk quotes the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.17b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 17b</a> that says that when the Kohanim don't wear their special clothing, there is a lack of kedusha of kehunah. When they wear them, they have it in fullest.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The verse indicates that when their vestments are on them, their priesthood is upon them, but if their vestments are not on them, their priesthood is not upon them and their rites are disqualified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://books.google.nl/books?id=MY4xtbRlxWIC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=clothing%20influence%20one%E2%80%99s%20behavior%20chasam%20sofer&source=bl&ots=gJXHiEZsxY&sig=ACfU3U0Lj-R3NVpAucQ_H3e236SVLwKJDA&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjew4mSotqAAxVf1QIHHSbdDCcQ6AF6BAglEAM#v=onepage&q=clothing%20influence%20one%E2%80%99s%20behavior%20chasam%20sofer&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this edition</a> of the sefer online.</p>\n\n\n",

It would be wonderful if my kids could (re-)direct their time to reading books which are compelling and interesting but also have a strong Jewish message.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts and/or suggestions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are a plethora of options available courtesy of the Jewish publishers, you just need to know where to look.</p>\n<p>Feldheim have a section for 13-18 year olds <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/jewish-books-for-children/young-adults.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> featuring fiction (e.g <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/no-186\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>No. 186</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/a-tale-of-two-sisters\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>A Tale of Two Sisters</em></a>) and historical fiction (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/akiva\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Akiva</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/bustenai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Bustenai</em></a>) etc.</p>\n<p>On the Artscroll site you can also filter books for older kids <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Items.aspx?hierId=CHI&rewrite=165&facet=%7CAGE%3AYoung%20Adult\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p>Mosaica Press you can likewise filter <a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/bookshop/?swoof=1&product_cat=young-adults\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> including a historical novel of <a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/jonah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yonah</a> and fictional novel entitled <em><a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/royal-challenge/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Royal Challenge</a></em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I highly recommend <a href=\"https://meiradrazin.com/books/honey-and-me/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Honey and Me by Meira Drazin</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Meira Drazin is a prolific freelance writer who has published dozens\nof articles about parenting and topics of Jewish interest.

Evidently, the term liable is used in the baraita.

The case brought in Hilchot Melachim uMilchamot, with the Kessef Mishneh, refers to the Egyptian who was killed by Moshe Rabbeinu.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A gentile who gave a Jew a blow etc. There (Sanhedrin 54b) [it says]:\n'Rabbi Ḥanina says: A gentile who struck a Jew is liable to receive\nthe death penalty, as it is stated (Exodus 2:12): “And he turned this\nway and that way\" etc.' Our teacher holds that even though he is\nliable to death in hands of Heaven, he is not executed. [We can bring]\nproof for this from the back-and-forth in \"Eilu Hein Hagolin\" (Makkot\n9a) as to whether a ger toshav (resident alien) who [unintentionally]\nkilled a Jew is exiled or executed. Surely it should debate about one\nwho damaged a Jew! Rather, it is certain that even though he is liable\nto receive the death penalty, he is not executed, and the verse \"And\nhe turned this way and that way\" is only an asmachta.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.10.6?lang=bi&with=Kessef%20Mishneh&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.10.6?lang=bi&with=Kessef%20Mishneh&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>What I don't get myself is how a gentile who would strike a Jew is not executed, but I'm pretty sure in Beit Shammai he would indeed be executed.</p>\n<p>Notice that we don't know whether this \"gentile\" is part of the 70 nations or of the nations \"Nogah\" such as Ishmael or Edom. The 70 nations represented in the Gibeonites who deceived Yehoshua were just spared as long as they accept undefined servitude, but biblical law commands actually to eradicate the Canaanites, so more or less I hope you have many hints to understand why a regular \"gentile\" who is killed by an Israelite does not constitute a capital offense for the Israelite.</p>\n<p>Now, what happens if the \"gentile\" is a chassid umot haOlam, that of course came from the nations of Klippat Nogah that are not part of the 70? Yehi Munach ad Sheyabo Eliyahu, Elijah the prophet will tell!</p>\n<p>Bottom line, it should be taken into account, very important, Which kind of gentile is being talked about? because not all gentiles are equal, such as Edomim and Ishmaelim (part of the avrahamic seed). This differentiation is stated in Deut. 23:8 with Kabbalah (Shaarei Orah):</p>\n<p>Hebrew:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר: מוטב שאתן לעשו בני ברכת העולם הזה, הבא על ידי מאכל ומשתה, כדי\nשימשול על ישראל; מאחר שיחטאו ישראל יפלו בגלות, יותר טוב הוא שיפלו\nבגלות עשו אחיהם משיפלו בגלות אחרים נכרים שהם שבעים אומות. ואמר יצחק:\nמאחר שאי אפשר שלא תגבה מידת הדין החוב שלה מישראל, יותר טוב הוא שתגבה\nהחוב על ידי אחיהם משיגבה אותו על ידי נכרי, וזהו סוד: לא תתעב אדומי כי\nאחיך הוא (דברים כג, ח).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[He thus said, “It is better that I give my son Esav the blessings of this world, which come through food and drink, so that once the Jewish people sin and become subject to exile, he will rule over them. Better that they be in the exile with their brother Esav, than to be in exile amongst nations of heathens.” Yitzchak therefore said, “Since it is not possible that the quality of judgment-Din-דין will not exact its debt from the Jewish people, it is better that their debt be exacted at the hands of their brother, rather than at the hands of heathen.” This is the secret of the verse, “You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother.”] —Translation provided by Sefaria</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.8?lang=bi&with=Sha%27arei%20Orah&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.8?lang=bi&with=Sha%27arei%20Orah&lang2=he</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do Rabbis say that HaShem was mistaken and HaShem states that He was defeated and that He must obey the Rabbis?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been reading an article on an <a href=\"https://muslimskeptic.com/2021/11/22/the-genius-of-islam-episode-3-the-curse-of-polytheism/#post-8403-footnote-ref-3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Islamic website called Muslim Skeptic</a> and came across the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The way that Jews depict God, they celebrate the notion of debating with God, winning arguments against God, even triumphing over God. This comes from the traditional Jewish doctrine of “The Torah is not in heaven,” which means that Rabbis have ultimate authority in determining religious laws and even God himself cannot overrule them. In the Talmud story of the Oven of Akhnai, God himself states a legal position by miraculously speaking to a group of Rabbis directly from heaven, but the Rabbis disagree with God’s position and argue that God is mistaken. By the end of the story, God admits: “My children have defeated Me.” [Talmud, Bava Metzia 59a-b] In this way, in Judaism, the Rabbis are ultimate lawmakers above even God. And this principle is allegedly acknowledged by God Himself. According to the Talmud, God admits, “Even I must obey the decree of the Rabbis.” [Pesikta Rabbati 3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think I need to say that this characterization and interpretation is deeply problematic. Since G-d, blessed be He, is all-powerful, He can overrule anything He wants particularly if say an evil decree were made by Rabbis (G-d, blessed be He, forbid). Even if this was being used by HaShem for teaching purposes, since He is all-good and always truthful, He always speaks the truth. If He stated “My children have defeated Me.” and “Even I must obey the decree of the Rabbis.”, then that would lead to a major contradiction, which cannot be possible as HaShem cannot be mistaken.</p>\n<p>How has this been understood? Are the passages being taken out of context?</p>\n<p>EDIT: Found an <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/89476/32692\">answer on mi yodeya</a> which references this and states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hashem gave Moshe a process for humans to work. This is why, in the tanur shel akhnai story (Bava Metzia 59a-b), even though R' Eliezer is capable of invoking miracles \"if I am correct\", the law still follows the majority against him. Halakhah follows the process given, the kelalei hapesaq -- the rules of decisionmaking, not revalation of Divine Truth. The debate concludes by quoting the verse \"lo bashamayim hi -- it is not in heaven\", because Hashem didn't intend to give us answers. And the story concludes with us learning that at that moment Hashem laughed (so to speak) \"Nitzchuni banai -- My children have bested Me / My children have eternalized Me\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This helps to partially clarify Bava Metzia 59a-b. I guess the way it was framed in the Islamic article was a mistranslation and likely also out of context and I assume \"My children have eternalized Me\" seems to mean something akin to saying that one's children have made one feel proud or something like that (correct me if I'm wrong).</p>\n<p>I've searched for Pesikta Rabbati 3 on here, but didn't find anything that could be of help here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Let's break it down. Firstly, it seems the question is unaware of something fairly standard in traditional Judaism, which is Hashem gave the authority to make halachic rulings to the Sages of each generation. He defined what they decree <em>as His will</em>. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nasso.29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma Nasso 29</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A person should not say, \"I will not fulfill the commandments of the\nelders (rabbis), since they are not from the Torah.\" The Holy One,\nblessed be He, said to them, \"My children, you are not allowed to say\nthis. Rather, observe anything that they decree upon you, as it is\nstated (Deuteronomy 17:10-11), 'And you shall do according to [...]\nthe law that they shall instruct you.'\" Why? Because I also agree\nwith their words, as it is stated (Job 22:28), \"You will decree and\nit will be fulfilled for you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Generally, not only does He agree, but He finds their halachic \"innovations\" more precious to Him than His own laws. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.11.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sanhedrin 11:3</a> and discussion there.</p>\n<p>It is codified as an actual mitzva of the 613 mitzvot based on the explicit verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 17:10</a> and onwards; the mitzva for us to listen to the Rabbis. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.495\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaChinuch 495</a> for example. Note how this creates a logical identity between \"Torah law\" and \"Rabbinic law\".</p>\n<p>This is the true meaning of Hashem \"partnering with man\" in the creation of the world. The Chachamim are given permission to take Hashem's Will, and bring it down into the physical world by deciding how His will applies in every detail of the world. The wider discussion behind this would make for its own question, but see \"Halachic Man\" by Rabbi Soloveitchik for further reading, for example.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To proceed with understanding how this process of Hashem's will being brought into the world can be a flawed process, let's ask a bigger question first. How is it possible for us to sin in the first place? Hashem doesn't want us to sin, it is against His Supreme Will. How can something <em>against His will</em> happen? Did He make a mistake?</p>\n<p>The angels certainly accused Him of making a mistake, creating mankind, in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.16.178\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar 1:23a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Aza and Azael also opposed (man's creation). When the Shechinah said\n... \"Let Us make man,\" they responded,\n\"What is man that You take knowledge of him?\" (Tehilim 144:3). Why do\nYou wish to create man when You know that he shall definitely sin\nbefore You</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The short answer is that Hashem's higher/inner will is that we refrain from sin <em>by our own choice</em>, not by force of His will. Us being realistically able to sin is therefore necessary for His <em>inner will</em> (see the rest of that Zohar), no mistakes but exactly what Hashem needed.</p>\n<p>It's the same answer here with regards to our case. Hashem wants a relationship with us, and gave us the hands-on study, of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.6.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">learning in order to perform</a> His will. I'll note here that this anecdote is seemingly telling us that it's not Hashem who made a mistake (He doesn't know what He wants?), but our beloved holy sages, which we wouldn't dare say had this story not implied it.</p>\n<p>This partnership is <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3676643/jewish/Meditation-on-an-Embrace.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a marriage</a>, which means it must be realistically possible for us to make a mistake regarding the correct opinion on a particular halacha, debate it, and end up with a majority wrong, otherwise they are robots, clones of Him, and that's not a marriage, and He is still alone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/856/do-we-really-have-free-choice/114432#114432\">Further reading</a> on the nature of free will, and the purpose of it, would be excellent in further understanding the above points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It would also be prudent for the reader to look into the <a href=\"https://aish.com/48932007/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halachic process</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/901656/jewish/Introduction-to-Mishneh-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">history of the Oral Transmission</a> at this point. How can such errors and mistakes arise, how severe are they, what does it mean in terms of whether we are performing Hashem's will or not.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that for the sake of this answer, whatever the sages decide is more precious and beloved to Hashem than what He would have decided Himself, at least in regards to this halachic decision. This is true even if it is a \"mistake\", given that the Chachamim are following protocol, and are sincerely trying their best with what they've been given.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <em>chassidic</em> definition of \"good\" means \"what is important to you\nmatters more to me than what is important to me\", and Hashem is the\nultimate good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"what if they made an evil decision\" question is a bit more complex. It is theoretically possible, but the systems that Hashem put into place ensure that this is unlikely. The criteria for deciding our judges, the system of giving authority to older generations over newer ones, the adverserial nature of deciding halacha... This is also a huge topic out of scope for this answer that would be worth reading up on separately.</p>\n<p>It also seems, historically speaking, that when the corruption of exile became too much of a problem, the halachic process became more rarefied and less innovative, in order to avoid our knowledge of Hashem's will becoming corrupted too. This occurred thanks to the check and balances given at Sinai, applied by the last of our truly great leaders, and guided by Hashem's Hand of Hashgacha*.</p>\n<p>The last point about Hashem's Hashgacha is important too. We follow His protocol and try our best, and then say in our prayer \"we are fallible and prone to make mistakes, please help us and ensure that we don't destroy Your world with the huge responsibility You've given us\" and that prayer has been answered. We have made it 3335 years since Sinai, and Hashem has indeed listened to the Rabbis on these matters, yet here we are, keeping Torah and Mitzvot faithfully until this day.</p>\n<p><sup>* see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_David%2C_Miketz?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Chida</a>, regarding <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.59a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the dispute about \"that which is seen and rejected cannot be seen again\"</a>. Hoshea made a mistake in his ruling on this matter, holding like Rabbi Yochanan. He thought this was correct, and therefore told Hashem to transfer the rejected Jews to another nation. Hashem then changed his mind, and he retracted his ruling and ruled differently. Hashem is ultimately in control.</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: This aggadah does not raise the point of Hashem making mistakes, and certainly doesn't imply that He makes one here. Hashem saying \"My children defeated Me\" comes with a laugh because it is out of the delight of His <em>inner will</em>, that we precious yet fallible people of His are sincerely trying to know, get close, and fulfil the mission of our God, with our own free will. Definitely not a mistake, but the whole point of creation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Let me summarize the topic for you:</p>\n<p>1, The passage itself is NOT brought to teach that rabbis overcame the existing tradition or God's will. Read the whole 59a and see that the Talmud discusses paying respect to people, e.g. the preceding statement is \"<em>And Rabbi Ḥelbo says: A person must always be careful about sustaining the honor of his wife, as blessing is found in a person’s house only because of his wife</em>\".</p>\n<p>Also, the statement that follows the story reads: \"<em>The Sages taught: One who verbally mistreats the convert violates three prohibitions, and one who oppresses him in other ways violates two.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Therefore, <strong>the Tannaitic story around Tanuro Shel Akhnai is about the respect one should pay to Jewish Sages</strong>. In the story, R\"G (as is pretty typical of him) wished to gain political influence and asked R\"Y to <em><strong>artificially and baselessly</strong></em> oppose R\"E, even though he had no chance, because R\"E was the wisest and the most adherent to the existing tradition, as witnessed by the miracles and God Himself.</p>\n<p>The point of R\"Y was to get R\"E (often associated with the tradition of Beys Shammay) banned as the Halachic power and pave the way to . This is why the argument turned so ugly. Read the ending of this passage where R\"G dies. This doesn't look like God actually liked the show:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"R\"E's eyes shed tears, and as a result, the entire world was afflicted: One-third of its olives were afflicted, and one-third of its wheat, and one-third of its barley. And some say that even dough kneaded in a woman’s hands spoiled. The Sages taught: There was great anger on that day, as any place that Rabbi Eliezer fixed his gaze was burned.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When [R\"E's wife and R\"G's sister] returned, she found him and saw that he had lowered his head in Tahanun prayer. She said to him: Arise, you already killed my brother. Meanwhile, the sound of a shofar emerged from the house of Rabban Gamliel to announce that the Nasi had died. Rabbi Eliezer said to her: From where did you know that your brother would die? She said to him: This is the tradition that I received from the house of the father of my father: All the gates of Heaven are apt to be locked, <strong>except for the gates of prayer for victims of verbal mistreatment</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>If you read carefully, \"My sons overpowered me\" is NOT an integral part of the story; it is stated by an Amora, Rabbi Natan. That means that some 200 years later, this passage was used to support (a posteriori) rabbinic rulings that depart from the existing tradition.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Anyways, R\"G already established (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.9?ven=hebrew%7CTorat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna R\"H 2.9</a>) that the Halachah should not follow the tradition, but political power (or physical, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.17a.6?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat.17a</a>). However, there was no Talmudic Asmachta for that. Tanuro Shel Akhnai emerged as the de facto approval for later rabbis, overriding existing rulings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is why we Pasken the Babylonian Talmud over the Jerusalem Talmud, as if God Himself allowed rabbis to change the tradition.</p>\n<p>Hope it helps.</p>\n\n\n",

They are against excessive talking to women. What is excessive?</p>\n<p>The Mishna in Avot 1:5 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַל תַּרְבֶּה שִׂיחָה עִם <strong>הָ</strong>אִשָּׁה</p>\n<p>Don't speak excessively to <strong>the</strong> woman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is an interesting הָ/\"the\" in line. Ostensibly, it comes to mean \"wife\" rather than any woman, which would seem to go with the rest of the Mishna, but that הָ still isn't necessary for that.</p>\n<p>I once heard an interesting <em>diyuk</em> on it. The Mishna is teaching us how to be a <em>mentsch</em> (this is Avot after-all). How does a <em>mentsch</em> talk to a woman?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A man flies from NYC to Boston for business. On the way out, he sits next to a man. The whole flight, the only thing he says to the man is \"excuse me\" when he needs to get out to go to the bathroom.</p>\n<p>On the way back to NYC, he is sat next to a woman. This flight is very different, because he strikes up a conversation with her from the get go, and keeps it going whenever he can think of something new to say.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What's the difference? Both cases should be the same: he had nothing to say to the man and no reason to strike up any conversation, so he didn't. The same should have been true for the woman, but it's not so. The difference is, she is <em>the woman</em>.</p>\n<p>The Mishna is explaining that this man isn't viewing her as a <em>mentsch</em>, a dignified human being. If he did, he wouldn't say anything to her unless he had a reason to do so, just like he does with men. However, he doesn't view her as a <em>mentsch</em>, he views her as \"the woman\". He's not talking to <em>her</em>, he's talking to \"the woman\". Therefore, he talks \"excessively\"; he finds extra, unnecessary things to say simply on account of her womanhood, and this is very silly, and not something a <em>mentsch</em> should be doing.</p>\n<p>So, I think there is a misunderstanding in the premise of the question. Being a woman doesn't default preclude a man from talking to her, although there is definitely reason to not talk to her <em>just because she is a woman</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>May I recommend that you look up if it is <em>mutar</em> for a man to compliment a woman's looks, halachically, and if not ask why this is an exception?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Prishah (Even Ha'ezer, Siman 65, note 1) adds another possible explanation of the term כלה נאה, that it's meant to reference not the kallah's external beauty, but נאה במעשה, or \"beautiful in her deeds.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Those close to him knew his opinion, but he never came out in public about it. Until once, someone wrote in the newspaper “Hameilitz” that by speaking Hebrew, one can be considered Jewish even without Torah and mitzvohs.

The Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 1:1 explains that Hashem</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מַבִּיט בַּתּוֹרָה וּבוֹרֵא אֶת הָעוֹלָם</p>\n<p>looked into the Torah and created the world</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The verses this is based on and how it is derived is explained there. The Midrash Tanchuma 1:1 explains on the similar point that if a single letter is changed in the Torah it ruins everything:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כֵּיצַד? כָּתוּב בָּהּ, וְלֹא תְחַלְּלוּ אֶת שֵׁם קָדְשִׁי (ויקרא כב,\nלב), אִם אַתָּה עוֹשֶׂה חֵי״‎ת הֵ״‎א, אַתָּה מַחֲרִיב אֶת הָעוֹלָם</p>\n<p>For example, it is written in the Torah: Profane not My Holy Name\n(Lev. 22:2); but if you should change the het in the word yehallelu\n(“profane”) into a heh, the word would read “praise,” and you would\nthereby destroy the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first lessons in 2 of the most ancient and important Midrashic works, penned in the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/901656/jewish/Introduction-to-Mishneh-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">courts of the unbroken chain of Torah teachers back to Moshe</a>; all the <em>gematriot</em> and kabbalistic explanations of the points you are asking about are elaborating on this point: <strong>that the Torah is the blueprint of the world, designed by the Artist of the world.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>See Rabbi Tatz's <em>Worldmask</em>, which elaborates in great detail in Chapter 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah is the cause and the world is the result</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Quoting the same tradition, with the Zohar as his source:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קוּדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא אִסְתָּכַּל בְּאוֹרַיְיתָא, וּבָרָא עָלְמָא</p>\n<p>Hashem looked into the Torah and created the world</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He explains that the existence of the entire world and every one of its details is created from Hashem's word, which is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>the means, the mechanism of Creation</em>. Each word spoken by Hashem in\ncreating the world crystallized into the object it described</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He extends this to not just the Written Torah, but the Oral Torah. Quoting the Talmudic story of \"<em>lo bashamayim hee\"</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And now we can open a startling new awareness: if Torah lives in the\nminds and personalities of its Sages, <em>that is where the causative,\nprimary energy of the world is to be found.</em> This most profound idea\nmeans that Hashem's Torah <em>is</em> the consciousness of the Sages of\n<em>Torah she'b'al peh</em>. It has been given to us; it is no longer in Heaven, so to speak, and we are partners in Creation in the deepest\nsense possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So he has made our case, that the entire existence of reality is rooted in the Torah, based on the ancient sources quoted here. The reason why this idea gets more technical after the enlightenment is because it was the enlightenment that changed the way we view <em>the world</em>, not the way we view the Torah. We began to see that the world itself has many secrets; physical laws, distant galaxies, unbeknownst phenomena like inflation and speciation - there are many things we discovered that are not written <em>explicitly</em> in the Torah.</p>\n<p>However, this ancient and most fundamental Torah principle that the Torah is the blueprint of creation means that these matters are all in the Torah too, and the fact that we cannot see them means they are encoded/encrypted. Gematria is one possibility, but generally speaking it is a secret matter, so not much more can be said.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Asher Ben Bachya in the 13th century was the first to mention.</p>\n<p>Then later, Rabbi Moshe Cordevero.</p>\n<p>Here below is my translation of Cordevero’s words (it will be proposed here that the phenomenon of extrapolated “skip distance (d) text strings” (as discussed by Edwin R.

For example, if one of a person's sins is lashon hara (truthful slandering), he should occupy himself with the study of Torah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27arei_Teshuvah.1.35?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shaarei Teshuvah, 1:35)</a>.</p>\n<p>Rav Dessler, in Michtav Me'Eliyahu (A shortcut to teshuva, p. 115) explains that there are four \"shortcuts\" to doing teshuva. One of these is Torah-learning.

Is learning Torah a pre-requisite to do teshuva from the start? Surely, studying Torah is knowing how to act, and thus knowing how not to act. But is a successful teshuva dependent on it? Why does Rabbeinu Yonah not write that Torah study is the first principle, or another principle?

They (the creations) received the Divine Light and Vitality through many garments which cover and conceal His Light</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All in all, I think the issue lies in your confusion between G-d's essence and G-d's effects. These are two different things. If you have any questions, I hope to answer them further.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Sources don't say that God is not \"perfect\", but one can be forgiven for inferring that from them on occasion.  First, the Midrash says that God created many worlds and destroyed them because he \"didn't like them\", implying something He made was not perfect. [Gen. R. 3:7]  Second, the Talmud says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was taught in a baraita: For two-and-a-half years the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel argued. The first said: It would have been better if man had never been created. And the second said: It is better that man has been created. They took a vote and decided: It would have been better for man never to have been created; but now that he has been created, he should be careful about his behavior. [Eruvin 13b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Shammai won.  Obviously the majority thought the creation of Man was not a \"perfect\" act.  But, they concluded, now that we are here, let's make the best of a bad situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have recently come across <a href=\"https://he.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5899070\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a ma'amar</a> that goes to a lot of trouble to help us understand a lot of theological ideas like this. Here is the summary of the Alter Rebbe's description of Tzimtzum and how it did not involve any change whatsoever in Hashem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנפש מתלבשת ממש בגוף אבל למעלה אפילו ושמך קדוש וכ״ש אתה קדוש והצמצום\nהיה רק בחי׳ האור. ואינו הסתלקות כ״א בהעלם ועד״מ באדם יש העלם וגילוי\nכמו כשלמד איזה מסכת ושגורה אצלו בע״פ. ובעידנא דלא עסיק בה הוא בהעלם\nאצלו ונכלל במוח החכמה מוח  הזכרון. ועד״ז יובן למעלה פי׳ הצמצום שנכלל\nגילוי האור בהעצמיות שלמעלה מהגילוי. ענין הגילוי עכ״ה</p>\n<p>The soul is truly enclothed within the body, but above, even regarding\n\"And Your Name is holy,\" and certainly regarding \"You are holy,\", the\ntzimtzum occurred only in the light, and <strong>it is not a\nwithdrawal, but rather a concealment</strong>. For example, in a person,\nthere is a state of concealment and revelation: When one has studied a\nparticular tractate and knows it fluently by heart,   at the time that\nhe is not actively engaged in it, that knowledge remains concealed\nwithin him, i.e. i is included within the faculty of wisdom, within\nthe faculty of memory, likewise, this helps us understand the concept\nof tzimtzum above, that the revelation of light became included within\nthe essence, which is beyond revelation. This is the concept of\nrevelation and concealment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. there is no literal contraction, just a concealment. The very essence of our intellect is called \"memory\", and is unchanging. What changes is <em>what we are focussing on right now</em>, i.e. our <em>revealed intellect</em>. Hashem has \"receded from our revealed intellect\", and it is our job to find Him, and remember Him at all times.</p>\n<p>The bit about \"it occured only in the light\" is also something that needs understanding. The Alter Rebbe gives an example of the soul. Our soul itself doesn't actually literally fill our body, because that would imply that our soul is composed of various parts that slot in to our organs and faculties. Rather, the soul is alive, and it is this life that fills the body, like a light.</p>\n<p>The difference between our soul and Hashem is that our soul is affected by our body, but He is not affected by the world, similar to how the earth does not affect the sun, even though the sun's light fills the world. If our body is cold, the soul is affected, but if the earth is cold, the sun is not affected. It still radiates the exact same amount of light at the same intensity forever, without any change.</p>\n\n\n",

However, this is actually an old Christian trope, going back to at least Marcion of Sinope, and has a horrible history of being invoked in the prelude to horrific abuse of the Jewish community. As such I've voted to close it, as I am not sure Mi Yodeya is here to provide response to such things.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wf8I2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wf8I2.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p><sup><em>Answer: Marcion of Sinope</em>: try our new bible! Tyrant free. <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/641/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></sup></p>\n<p>Given that this misconception is so widespread by now (Rabbi Sacks AH had to mention that this was an antisemitic trope to a very surprised Richard Dawkins, a complete atheist, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ad3rVRdgbI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">their debate</a>, and Stephen Fry, another atheist, has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKuvoHitExo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">made this point viral</a> recently), and is therefore <em>almost</em> a legitimate question, I'll give it an answer if I may.</p>\n<p>Well 2 answers: the first is just go and read the entire Tanach, or even 50% of it; that would be the minimum level of prerequisite research required to bring to a question like this, ideally! I will give a couple of quotes at the end, but putting Hashem in the full context the Tanach offers will go a long way towards educating oneself on what He is like, and dispelling this myth.</p>\n<p>The main answer I would like to give, is that the Torah reveals Hashem to be real. Not simply in the sense of \"existing\" (when it comes to that, the philosophical understandings of Hashem are very rich and deep, but not really the main thing we discuss), but in the sense of being a real <em>someone</em>. He may not have a body, but He is there and He is in a very close and personal relationship with us, and He needs that relationship and us infinitely. This is <em>His</em> project, people and desire.</p>\n<p>So He is real, we are real, and therefore this relationship we are in with Him is <strong>real</strong>. A real relationship has anger sometimes. It has demands. It has consequences, <em>which come from the relationship</em>, rather than self-centeredness. He Himself defines goodness as \"considering you more important to Me than I am to Myself\".</p>\n<p>The western idea of Hashem is quite Aristotelean, and this view can lead us to think of Him as a perfect infinite unchanging rock, who is aloof and unaffected by us, and therefore the key context to understanding Hashem is missing. The reader will miss that Hashem is real and actually cares. We are made in His Image, as the Torah tells us at the very beginning, and therefore we shouldn't have fallen into this trap of viewing His heartfelt dynamic relationship with us as depicting some sort of uncaring tyrant, ch'v, in the same ways we shouldn't view our parents, or our spouses, as being tyrannically in their love and closeness to us. Alas, we are easily impressed by silly, cynical tropes, especially under the influence of Greek thinking...</p>\n<p>How deeply He cares is actually quite a personal, private matter, and as the Tanach progresses, it gets more and more revealed. The Tanach is indeed the full story of a relationship between God and His people, and at the beginning, the closeness is less obvious as the relationship is still new... Indeed, in any close and personal relationship, there is a lot of mystery, especially when it is new and they are still figuring each other out (how much more so when you are in a relationship with Hashem).</p>\n<p>Jewish Tradition is now a nearly-4000 year story of everything we have got to know about Hashem through alacritous study, and can't possibly be squeezed into 30,000 characters of a Stack Exchange answer. There's so much to know, and now that you know that OP's point is just a trope, you won't be surprised to find out what should indeed really be true: that He is absolutely wonderful in every way, the source of all goodness (everyone likes goodness, right?), and there is an endless amount of study to get to know Him properly.</p>\n<p>Here are some quotes from Tanach, followed by a quote from the Talmud.</p>\n<h4>From Torah:</h4>\n<p>Shemot 34:6-7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויעבר יהוה  על־פניו ויקרא ה  ה אל רחום וחנון ארך אפים ורב־חסד\nואמת  נצר חסד לאלפים נשא עון ופשע וחטאה ונקה לא ינקה</p>\n<p>And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord,\nmighty, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in love and\ntruth, keeping love to thousands, forgiving iniquity, and\ntransgression, and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our tradition records that this is the highest name of Hashem, the Tetragrammaton, and this name is when we want to describe who He is in essence.  Basically, this verse in a nutshell: \"I love you with my very being and therefore I have very high expectations of you which are no joke, however I know that it's very very hard so I will be extremely understanding and patient with you, and help you get there with all my love\"</p>\n<h4>From Prophets:</h4>\n<p>Hashem cries over our suffering (Yirmiyahu 13:17):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאִם לֹא תִשְׁמָעוּהָ בְּמִסְתָּרִים תִּבְכֶּה־נַפְשִׁי מִפְּנֵי\nגֵוָה וְדָמֹעַ תִּדְמַע וְתֵרַד עֵינִי דִּמְעָה כִּי נִשְׁבָּה עֵדֶר\nה׃          </p>\n<p>But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in\nsecret for your pride; and my eye shall weep sore, and run down with\ntears, because the Lord’s flock is carried away captive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hashem is in a real relationship with us, with its ups and downs, but the love is the real \"face\" of Hashem (Yishayahu 4-8):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אל־תיראי כי־לא תבושי ואל־תכלמי כי לא תחפירי כי בשת עלומיך תשכחי וחרפת\nאלמנותיך לא תזכרי־עוד כי בעליך עשיך ה צבאות שמו וגאלך קדוש ישראל אלהי\nכל־הארץ יקרא כי־כאשה עזובה ועצובת רוח קראך ה ואשת נעורים כי תמאס אמר\nאלקיך ברגע קטן עזבתיך וברחמים גדלים אקבצך בשצף קצף הסתרתי פני רגע ממך\nובחסד עולם רחמתיך אמר גאלך ה</p>\n<p>Fear not; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be confounded; for you\nshall not be put to shame: but you will forget the shame of your\nyouth, and will not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.\nFor your Maker is your Husband: the Lord of hosts is His name; and\nyour redeemer is the Holy One of Yisrael; The God of the whole earth\nHe is called. For the Lord has called you as a woman forsaken and\ngrieved in spirit; but a wife of youth, can she be cast off? says your\nGod. For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies\nwill I gather you. In the overflowing of anger I hid my face from you\nfor a moment; but with everlasting faithful love will I have mercy on\nyou, says your redeemer, the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>From Writings</h4>\n<p>This is a basic tenant of Judaism (Tehillim 23:6):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אך  טוב וחסד ירדפוני כל־ימי חיי ושבתי בבית־ה לארך ימים </p>\n<p>Only goodness and steadfast love shall pursue me all the days of my\nlife, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for many long years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hashem is intimate and deeply, passionately loving (Shir HaShirim 7:7, 11, 8:6-7):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מה־יפית ומה־נעמת אהבה בתענוגים</p>\n<p>How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</p>\n<p>אני לדודי ועלי תשוקתו         </p>\n<p>I am my Beloved’s, and His desire is towards me.</p>\n<p>שימני כחותם על־לבך כחותם על־זרועך כי־עזה כמות אהבה קשה כשאול קנאה\nרשפיה רשפי אש שלהבתיה מים רבים לא יוכלו לכבות את־האהבה ונהרות לא\nישטפוה אם־יתן איש את־כל־הון ביתו באהבה בוז יבוזו לו</p>\n<p>Set Me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm: for love is\nstrong as death; jealousy is cruel as She᾽ol: the coals thereof are\ncoals of fire, which have a most vehement flame. Many waters cannot\nquench love, nor can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the\nsubstance of his house for love, it would be utterly scorned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we learn that such an intense love, such a passionate <em>real</em> relationship is \"strong as death\" and involves \"jealousy as cruel as hell\". We have this in the west; we view parental love as \"controlling\", martial bonding as \"stifling\", jealousy as a \"red flag\". Indeed if such a jealous love is as hot as hell, it's no wonder that hearing of a new testament that tells us that God's love is cool (so much so that He wouldn't mind if you go to hell forever if you don't love Him back) would be appealing. The Jews would rather withstand the temporary \"hell\" of this intensely real, vulnerable love, than the eternal hell of His love not being real, and wish everyone else would have the strength and courage to do so as well, in their personal lives and in their relationship with God.</p>\n<h4>From Talmud</h4>\n<p>Chagiga 5b (with Steinsaltz translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״וארא והנה רוח סערה באה מן הצפון ענן גדול ואש מתלקחת ונוגה לו סביב\nומתוכה כעין החשמל מתוך האש״. להיכן אזל? אמר רב יהודה אמר רב: שהלך\nלכבוש את כל העולם כולו תחת נבוכדנצר הרשע. וכל כך למה? שלא יאמרו אומות\nהעולם: ביד אומה שפלה מסר הקדוש ברוך הוא את בניו. אמר הקדוש ברוך הוא:\nמי גרם לי שאהיה שמש לעובדי פסילים — עונותיהן של ישראל הן גרמו לי.</p>\n<p>The verse states: “And I looked and, behold, a stormy wind came out of\nthe north, a great cloud, with a fire flashing up, so that a\nbrightness was round about it; and out of its midst was like the color\nof electrum, out of the midst of the fire” (Ezekiel 1:4). The Gemara\nposes a question: Where did that wind go? Rav Yehuda said that Rav\nsaid: It went to conquer the entire world under the wicked\nNebuchadnezzar. And why was all of this necessary? Why was it\nnecessary that the entire world be subjected to his dominion? So that\nthe nations of the world would not say: The Holy One, Blessed be He,\ndelivered His children into the hands of a lowly nation. Since it was\nalready decreed that the kingdom of Israel would fall into the hands\nof Nebuchadnezzar, God made him into a great conqueror, so that Israel\nwould not be ashamed of being defeated by him. The Holy One, Blessed\nbe He, said with regard to this: Who caused Me to be an attendant to\nworshippers of molten images, forcing Me to wage their wars? It was\nthe sins of Israel that led Me to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This really answers your question most directly. It clearly demonstrates that all acts of suffering inflicted upon us by Hashem are only for our own very best good, and do not reflect any cruel feelings on His part. On the contrary, it goes against His very being, so much so that He goes to the trouble of actually helping idolators for the \"small\" concern of His people's dignity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There is much endless further reading in the Jewish tradition on the subject of who is Hashem and what is He like/about. Rabbi Heschel (God in Search of Man) and Rabbi Sacks (Covenant and Conversation) come to mind. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad Chassidus</a> is a recommendation of mine, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@manisfriedman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Manis Friedman's lectures</a> especially.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The only Jewish tradition of God that has those characteristics is those whose concept of God is limited to just the Biblical text. As far as I know all Rabbinate and Karaite Jews interpret God through traditions that do not teach God as having negative characteristics. Portions of the Torah that may not show God in a positive light are reinterpreted and validated with outside traditions to not make God \"look so bad.\"</p>\n<p>Thats the thing about the Jews though. They aren't going to censor their books because of problematic verses. And so yes, if you treat certain Biblical verses as devoid of any outside tradition you can come away with the impression that the Biblical God may resemble such negative characteristics.</p>\n\n\n",

If we agree that Islam is objectively better than Christianity and we agree that the idolatry of Christianity is a non-starter for living in accordance to God's will, does it not make sense to encourage non-Jews to choose one over the other simply for the sake of pointing them in a better direction?</p>\n<p>The fact is we aren't going to create a new structure for non-Jews. Our resources are necessary for keeping Jews observant and perfecting our own community observances. If we have no plans of helping these people, should we not direct them to a faith which can?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>TL;DR: No, it's not a positive act. You'd still be leading people to sin, which is forbidden.</p>\n<p>Let's take this up piece by piece. Why this is not allowed is explained mostly at the end.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Islam is considered a pure monotheism according to Judaism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is highly debatable. To cite just some examples, during the 11th-12th century CE, the R”i Migash, as quoted by the Meiri, ruled that the Muslims continued in the practices of the pre-Islamic pagans.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra wrote in his commentary to the Book of Daniel (11:30) that, “The men of Mecca did not turn to his [Muhammad’s] religion until he swore to them that he would not remove the Markolis worship, and it is not necessary to elaborate.”</p>\n<p>According to such interpretations, Muslims might practice a covert form of idolatry and their religion isn't pure monotheism. Also there are different sects of Islam, some of which are idolatrous or very close to being idolatrous.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's famously the only religion a Jew can convert to in the name of their survival because it doesn't require idolatry to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once again, debatable. Depends on who you ask.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Contrast that to Christianity and you're told it's better to die than be converted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>True, although some claim that Universalism might not be idolatry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Would encouraging Christians to convert to Islam be considered a positive act because you're encouraging people to transition from an idol based religion to a non-idol based one?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Absolutely not. Explanation at the end.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Judaism doesn't seek out or encourage conversion. This can leave Christians who exit their religion empty of the community aspect of their faith.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, debatable. Some Jews in more recent times (and certainly in Ancient times) were much more open to proseltyzing. There is almost never \"Judaism does X\". But I understand what you're saying. Conversion is long and hard, and Judaism is much more obscure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Noahidism is lacking. While Noahidism is a movement for non-Jews who acknowledge Torah and Judaism as truth, it isn't a cohesive movement with the same level of community structure. It's a very niche thing not many know about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'd strongly contest this. Even still, it would be much better if Noahides were to go out and proseltyze the truth and build their own communities, perhaps with the help of Jews, than do otherwise. Additionally, many Rabbis are opening up to having Noahides present at their Jewish communities, so Noahides can still experience communal events. Lastly, with the trends shifting from physical to digital, many online Noahide communities are popping up and this can also help to obtain a strong community structure. There is more cohesiveness than one may think.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Islam is a pure faith compared to Christianity. Obviously, Judaism is right but Islam is doing things correctly even if it's rooted in incorrect claims. (Rejection of Idolatry, Religious Court System, Charity As a Tool For Sin Forgiveness, Ritual Fasting, Ritual Purity, Clean slaughter of Animals, Reverence for Jewish Prophets, etc.) Compared to Christianity, Islam is arguably as close as a non-Jew can get to Judaism without converting to Judaism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Pure faith\" is contested and subjective as I said. I'd argue Islam can't do things correctly if its not compatible with the Torah. It has incorrect claims, but more importantly, it contradicts with what B'nei Noach are supposed to do. Citing <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.92a.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 92a</a>, the website <a href=\"https://noahide.org/the-thirty-mitzvot-of-the-bnei-noah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noahide.com claims</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ulla said: This verse refers to the thirty commandments which the Noachites have accepted. But they keep only three of them. One, they do not draw up marriage contracts for homosexuals. Two, they do not merchandize (human) flesh in the marketplace. <strong>Three, they do have respect for the Torah (and for Torah scholars).’</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I place emphasis on the bolded part. As Muslims generally claim either that the Torah has been corrupted or things like that, Muslims cannot be said to respect Torah scholars and their abilities to preserve their own texts. Moreover, <a href=\"https://asknoah.org/books/the-divine-code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according to Rabbi Moshe Weiner and colleagues in his nominal book \"The Divine Code\"</a>, gentiles are absolutely not allowed to create new religions, which is what Islam was.</p>\n<p>The point is that you would be leading Christians from committing horrifying sins of one kind, so committing sins of other kind. But this would still be leading them to committing sin, and you would be encouraging someone to commit sin, which is forbidden in Judaism as seen in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot 5:18</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And whoever causes the multitudes to sin, they do not give him the ability to repent</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All in all, even if Islam on the surface seems close to Judaism, it is still wrong. By doing something like that, you'd be leading people to sin, which is forbidden. As such, one cannot do what you have suggested. It would be much better to educate and teach Noahides about community organizing and the like, than converting them to a false religion. Ultimately, leading people to goodness is what's best for them. Giving them a substitute isn't the solution.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Difference between positive and negative Mitzvos when it comes to Chinuch\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah (343:3) writes that when it comes to positive Mitzvos, Chinuch begins from when the child is able to understand the purpose of that specific Mitzvah, but when it comes to negative Mitzvos, Chinuch begins as soon as he understands what it means when he is told that something is forbidden - even if he doesn’t understand the reason for the prohibition.</p>\n<p>The question is: why is there a difference in this case between positive and negative Mitzvos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Because in both instances they serve a different purpose.</p>\n<p>In the case of the asei (the positive commandment) that is something that a child will learn to perform properly with all its details as they continue to grow up and therefore there has to be a degree of intellect there to understand the mechanics of the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>Refer to the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.42a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Succah 42a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: קָטָן הַיּוֹדֵעַ לְנַעְנֵעַ — חַיָּיב בְּלוּלָב, לְהִתְעַטֵּף — חַיָּיב בְּצִיצִית, לִשְׁמוֹר תְּפִילִּין — אָבִיו לוֹקֵחַ לוֹ תְּפִילִּין, יוֹדֵעַ לְדַבֵּר — אָבִיו מְלַמְּדוֹ תּוֹרָה וּקְרִיאַת שְׁמַע</p>\n<p>Our Rabbis taught: A minor who knows how to wave a lulav is obligated in (the mitzvah) of lulav, (how) to wrap himself is obligated in tzitzis, (how) to preserve (the sanctity) of tefillin – his father is obligated to buy him tefillin, if he knows how to speak his father should teach him Torah and Shema.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So once there is a degree of understanding behind the action, the child can be carefully trained to perform the act more readily, harnessing the excitement etc for the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>Conversely, with the lo saasei (negative commandment) it is about creating a habit. Namely, to inculcate from the get-go a simple awareness that we don't do certain actions. As the adage goes (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Shmuel_on_Avot.1.14.7?vhe=Midrash_Shmuel,_Warsaw,_1876&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Shmuel on Pirkei Avos 1:14</a> who quotes ר\"י ן' שושן ז\"ל):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ההרגל על כל דבר שלטון</p>\n<p>The habit of something holds sway</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Creating good habits early on will hopefully withstand the test of time. For example, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.40b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eiruvin 40b</a> speaks about making kiddush in shul on Yom Kippur night. It notes that one cannot recite kiddush on a cup of wine without tasting it immediately after the bracha has been said. In fact <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.40b.15?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Eruvin.40b.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> adds that to do so is a גנאי, a disgrace. Due to the fact that it is a fast day we obviously would not be able to drink from the cup. Thus, the Gemara suggests offering it to a minor to drink, thereby allowing for the potential to say it. However, the Gemara concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דילמא אתי למסרך</p>\n<p>Perhaps he (the child) might become used to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.40b.15?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Eruvin.40b.15.3&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains, should the child drink the wine, he might become acclimatised to such a practise even after he becomes Bar Mitzvah. Therefore, we see from this Gemara that anything that might come to create a negative inclination in the child must be avoided.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do Charedi rabbis allow Charedi Jews to change and become Modern Orthodox?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>You were born into a Hareidi family, but you decide to make a change and become Modern Orthodox.</p>\n<p>According to Charedi authorities, is it halachically allowed for a Haredi Jew to change and become Modern Orthodox?  Or is it forbidden?  And, if so, why?</p>\n<p>(In case it matters:  Please assume that the Chareidi Jew's new rabbi will be an average Modern Orthodox rabbi who graduated from the Yeshiva University rabbinical school).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It depends on the Charedi rabbi. It's not actually that monolithic, when you look carefully.</p>\n<p>It also depends on what you mean by \"become Modern Orthodox.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein allowed immigrants who'd worn Hassidic garb to shift to American-style clothing (provided it was modest), shave with an electric shaver, switch their siddur text from the Hassidic one to the non-Hassidic Ashkenazi one... at the same time, when no one was left wanting to be the Boyan Hassidic Rebbe, Rabbi Feinstein begged the father of the heir-apparent to encourage his son to take on the mantle. Presumably (and this is my read on it) not because Rabbi Feinstein felt that Boyan Hassidism was the best thing ever, but what would it mean to all of its followers if nobody wanted to be the leader anymore? (It's not practical to expect the masses to change over to something else.)</p>\n<p>Let's go back to what may be a similar scenario, the deep schism between Hassidim and Mitnagdim a few centuries ago. Rabbi Shlomo Eiger sat shiva when his son Leibl went Hassidic; the grandfather, Rabbi Akiva Eiger, did not. Often the greater people have the broadest perspective.</p>\n<p>(I recall discussing R' Yosef Eliyahu Henkin's family with historian Rabbi Dovid Katz of Baltimore. Not all of the Henkin kids went into the rabbinate. <em>The attitude at the time was if you can get shomer shabbos, it's a win!</em>)</p>\n<p>In very broad terms, the Charedi world is concerned about the negative influences of the outside world. If a competent rabbi feels that a particular individual both needs more exposure to the outside world and won't throw out the baby with the bathwater (i.e. abandon halacha) while doing so, then they may <em>quietly</em> approve -- or at least not condemn -- that individual's choice. But the leadership has to be careful as they don't want to endorse that for the masses.</p>\n<p>Think of something like this whole fight over whether Halacha demands that we read Genesis Ch. 1 as not including evolution. One very great \"Haredi\" rabbi was asked, shrugged, and said <em>I wasn't there.</em> But to the communal gatekeepers, it's too dangerous sociologically to be seen as giving in to modernity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It really would depend on the exact life style change. Both the Charedi and the Modern Orthodox (MO) world are too large and too diverse to give a clear definitive answer. There are certain sects, ostensibly Charedi, that are controversial enough that most Charedi rabbis would far prefer their child become MO rather than join one of those sects.</p>\n<p>There would also be a general question of changing customs, that would apply to a switch even within the Charedi world.</p>\n<p>In a general sense, however, as long as the MO group is not doing anything and does not have any hashkafic beliefs that the Charedi world considers outside the realm of Orthodox Judaism, there would be no halachic issue of making such a switch. Obviously they don't consider it to be ideal: otherwise the Charedi rabbis being asked would join that group themselves.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If we Jews don’t believe that we do not suffer from the sins of our fathers\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m going to preface this first by writing a question:  The Christians believe that Jesus died for our sins of the world- to which i personally do not believe that at all- the Christians believe that the fathers can bear the sins of their sons and the sons can bear the sins of their fathers</p>\n<p>Essentially, the misquote and miss interpretations of Isaiah chapter 53 paragraph 7.</p>\n<p>Now we as jews do not believe that and we learn it from Ezekiel 18:10</p>\n<p>That the son does not bear the iniquity of father and father does not bear the iniquity of the son-</p>\n<p>But now how do i explain and how does the Torah reconcile the fact that we all in the world today bear the sin of Adam and chava?</p>\n<p>Wouldn’t this be a contradiction to Ezekiel 18:10?</p>\n<p>I’m having trouble with this one.</p>\n<p>Does anybody have any explanations to this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The title of this question actually hints to this major problem: Judaism <em>does</em> believe that mankind CAN suffer <strong>FROM</strong>, or as a result of, another persons mistake, but CANNOT suffer <strong>FOR</strong> them. Therefore:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>how does the Torah reconcile the fact that we all in the world today <strong>bear</strong> the sin of Adam and chava?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We don't suffer FOR Adam and Eve, to exonerate them. We undergo tikkunim and battling our evil inclination as a RESULT OF them, but for OUR OWN benefit (which is how I personally view why God would have even let this occur in the first place).</p>\n<p>As an ex-christian, I will attempt to elucidate this <strong>for</strong>/<strong>from</strong> matter.</p>\n<p>Christian theology teaches: Due to humanity's depraved/sinful state by the fall of Adam and Eve, human beings have lost hope in attaining complete repentance on their own. They believe their deity <em>had</em> to intervene on our behalf, and only their deity in the form/mode of messiah, could <em>bear</em> the sins of anyone. They interpret \"bearing\" in a <em>vicarious</em> manner. Hence, all punishments each \"<em><strong>sinful</strong></em>\" human deserves, befalls this \"<em><strong>innocent</strong></em>\" individual <em>instead</em>, to rid them of their guilt, to make humanity innocent in God's eyes. <strong>Note:</strong> According to them, the suffering can only be rendered effective if one believes in that deity/messiah suffering. This will be important to note for Isaiah 53.</p>\n<p>Judaism does NOT subscribe to this <em>substitution</em> technique, most eloquently stated by King Solomon in <em>Proverbs 17:15</em>. Prophet Ezekiel teachings the same (Ezekiel 18:20) that, even if your dearest family members cannot \"take on\" your guilt in order to make you innocent, then nobody can. A sinful/guilty person <strong>CAN</strong> receive complete repentance through their own efforts, listed right after in <em><strong>Ezekiel 18:21-23</strong></em>! (Which instantly dismantles the christian's claim of needing God to intervene for us).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, christains claim <em>Isaiah 53:4-8</em> demonstrates the servant suffering <em>vicariously</em>. Upon a brief examination, we can determine that is NOT the case from 2 verses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(4) Indeed, <em>he bore</em> our illnesses/transgressions, and our pains-he carried them, yet we accounted him as plagued, smitten by God and oppressed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the speaker in Isaiah 53:1-9, here we see the non-Jewish nations dumbfounded. Throughout history their claim was that Israel suffered tremendously because God was punishing them for their own sins. Rather verse 10 is their realization that God actually never forsook Israel, but wanted to elevate them at the end of days (since this chapter takes place at the end of days).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(11) From the toil of his soul he would see, he would be satisfied; with his knowledge My servant would vindicate the just for many, and their iniquities he would bear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here, we see what bearing really means. Israel suffered <strong>as a result of</strong> the nation's iniquitous actions toward Jews and their ideologies in thinking God abandoned Israel. We also know this cannot be the nations claiming \"they suffered INSTEAD OF us\", because since this takes place at the end of days, <em>Zechariah 13-14</em> recounts the moments <strong>before</strong> Israel is firmly elevated and established, in which nations will rise against Israel and will actually punished for doing so. (If Israel suffered as a substitute, God exacting retribution on the nations wouldn't make sense, rather we know God delayed in punishing the nations throughout history).</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore <em>my</em> take is:</strong> These non-Jews are witnessing the unfolding of the end of days, how Israel is being saved and elevated by God. In seeing these prophecies come true (interestingly they seem to know about them as in verse 1 they claim \"who would've believed us [if we told them that Israel was correct in everything all along]?\"), they no longer can say Israel was wrong, but rather it was all part of God's plan. Therefore, right before the culmination, they are repenting and realizing that if God exacted retribution on the non-Jewish nations any second sooner:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>They would not know why they were being punished</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They probably would not have repented</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thereby, they declare verses 5 and 6, that by God allowing Israel to take the nations' beatings, the miracles of the end of days brings remorse to these non-Jews. (Take <strong>note</strong> how this won't require faith how christians demand it). They are also instilled with awe and admiration for Israel never being a hate-mongering, revenge-seeking nation. Only now in our days have non-Jews been exposed to Judaism in full, not just by seeing the Jewish example, but their ability to learn with Jews, have access to their Tanakh in the original language, and etc. Just how the prophecies of the messianic era will be universal and all will <strong>KNOW</strong>, so too it is the knowledge that Israel possesses and shares that will bring the world into recognition of the One True God.</p>\n<p>I myself, bear witness, that ever since I started learning Judaism through honorable Rabbis and sources, and with you all, \"their <strong>knowledge</strong>\" (verse 11) has brought me out of my idolatrous ways and implanted within me love and fear of the God of Israel. I hope to merit to complete my conversion to Orthodox Judaism soon to join this beloved nation.</p>\n\n\n",

I am curious as to whether Noahides have the same obligation, so if a Rabbi of a local community accepts a Noahide and they move in and are allowed to be in the synagogue and everything else, do they also halachically have to do whatever local custom is set, like e.g. monogamy in Ashkenazi communities?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes and no. A good Jewish way for a Noahide to answer that, right?</p>\n<p>No, Noahides are not obligated to take on the community customs in the same manner as Jews. The Noahide's scale and scope of participation in Jewish lifecycle events will always be different that the Jew's.</p>\n<p>However, the practical side of it is that yes, the Noahide does have to take on some of the community customs, in so far as he wishes to be a proper part of that community. For example, I studied with a rabbi in a community that uses the Sephard siddur from Artscroll and that is what I had to use while I learned from him. I wasn't obligated, per se.</p>\n<p>It's important for Noahides to be sensitive and respectful of the community they're in. And if a Noahide doesn't want to follow the customs, he should not involve himself in the community.</p>\n<p>Monogamy and other issues of such scale would be case-by-case, I'm sure, with the community.

Rambam teaches that only Hashem knows  the relative weights of the good and bad deeds. Hashem wants  to be kind to the Jewish people so He in His love will minimise the weight of the misdeeeds so that the merits will outweigh them. That's what the piyyut says, when there is no accuser to weigh the misdeeds heavily, ( באין מליץ יושר מול מגיד פשע) tell the Jews  תגיד ליעקב דבר חק something without reason ( חק) that is unreasoning love and then apply the judgment and through that we will be justified in judgment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The second cheilek (volume) of <a href=\"https://zbermanbooks.com/%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%9C%D7%99-%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9-%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%9B\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talelai Oros</a> on Rosh Hashanah (starting on page רלה) provides several explanations.</p>\n<p><strong>1) Torah acts as a protection against the Satan</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּאֵין מֵלִיץ יֽשֶׁר מוּל מַגִּיד פֶּֽשַׁע - When there is no one to plead [our] righteousness against the testimony of the accuser</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that if G-d forbid there is no one who will positively guide us against the <em>kitrug</em> (the accusation/prosecution) of the Satan, then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תַּגִּיד לְיַעֲקֹב דְּבַר חֹק וּמִשְׁפָּט - Speak on behalf of Yaakov regarding the statute and law</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a reference to the Torah and Kedusha (holiness).

This is the meaning of how Torah is \"מַגְּנָא\", it first \"protects\" against the accusation of the Satan who descends and tries to tempt us to sin. Then Torah is \"וּמַצְּלָא\" in that it saves from the accusation, upon the Satan's return.</p>\n<p><strong>2) The merit of Yaakov is our last line of defence</strong></p>\n<p>It writes in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=412&st=&pgnum=437&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Tzion</a> (Left column 2nd paragraph) from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj71OPz84SBAxU3VkEAHeNsDe0QFnoECBYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshl2gur.tripod.com%2FChislavichi%2FSternfeld.htm&usg=AOvVaw25iyJe-X5dpsqpDF2KBOSf&opi=89978449\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ben Zion Sternfeld, Av Beis Din of Bielsk</a> that when the prosecutor brings to trial a sin (חטא) that the person committed by mistake, there is an advocate that says that the sin was inadvertent. Similarly, if the person sins on purpose, but it was not to anger but merely to satisfy his desire, even still, there is an advocate that argues that his taavah (his overwhelming desire) caused him to sin and his heart was swayed accordingly.</p>\n<p>But when the prosecutor brings to trial a rebellious sin (פשע) of the person, such as an offense that the person sinned to provoke, e.g. there's some meat of nevelah (i.e. a non-shechted carcass) before him and he eats it, in such a case there is no advocate who can plead and defend the man's act.</p>\n<p>In such a case, this is what is meant by:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּאֵין מֵלִיץ יֽשֶׁר מוּל מַגִּיד פֶּֽשַׁע - When there is no one to plead [our] righteousness against the testimony of the accuser</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Namely, there is an opening here to exonerate the person in judgement. However,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תַּגִּיד לְיַעֲקֹב דְּבַר חֹק וּמִשְׁפָּט - Speak on behalf of Yaakov regarding the statute and law</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, that G-d promised Yaakov that He would save his sons in their time of trouble, even though they would have no right of their own at all, and that their salvation would come to them thanks to Yaakov Avinu. As it says in (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.20.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 20:2</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יַֽעַנְךָ֣ יְ֭הֹוָה בְּי֣וֹם צָרָ֑ה יְ֝שַׂגֶּבְךָ֗ שֵׁ֤ם ׀ אֱלֹהֵ֬י יַעֲקֹֽב</p>\n<p>May the LORD answer you in time of trouble, the name of Jacob’s God keep you safe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=412&st=&pgnum=437&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Tzion</a> (Left column 3rd paragraph) concludes that this is the explanation of the piyut we say on the first day of Rosh Hashanah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם יצאה גזירה דחוקה ומבולקה, לחבל את כל יושבי ארקא תביט בתבנית אשר בכסא חקוקה</p>\n<p>If a pressing and destructive decree is issued, to bind all dwellers of earth, look at the shape of the carved throne.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the image of Yaakov is engraved on G-d's Kisei HaKavod (heavenly throne) and by gazing at it, it will trigger the memory of Yaakov who Hashem promised would keep his children safe in his merit.</p>\n<p><strong>3) The measure-for-measure insurance policy</strong></p>\n<p>The Drashos Chasam Sofer explains that only a few of our prayers are intentional but most are unintentional. The Satan thus comes and prosecutes against all those prayers that came out unintentionally. So instead of being helpful, these tefillos actually prove harmful.</p>\n<p>As Jews we must observe the mitzvos and laws i.e. those that have logic, as if they were chukim, which are without reason and understanding, simply because Hashem commanded so. And on the other hand, the chukim of the Torah must be observed as if they were intellectually understandable. So much so, that it would be as despicable and abominable for a person to wear/plant kilayim as if he were killing someone or eating bugs.</p>\n<p>If we act like this, then Hashem acts measure for measure, and He accepts the prayers that lack concentration etc. as if they were uttered with complete and overflowing intent.</p>\n<p>This is what it means:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּאֵין מֵלִיץ יֽשֶׁר מוּל מַגִּיד פֶּֽשַׁע - When there is no one to plead [our] righteousness against the testimony of the accuser</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>i.e. If a person is not focused on their prayer and does not pray with heartfelt intent, the Satan will prosecute accordingly and retell their sins, and there is no one who will do good for them.</p>\n<p>And yet,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תַּגִּיד לְיַעֲקֹב דְּבַר חֹק וּמִשְׁפָּט - Speak on behalf of Yaakov regarding the statute and law</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>i.e. the chok (the statute) will be in their eyes like a mishpat (a law) and vice versa, and thus it is guaranteed that...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְצַדְּקֵֽנוּ בַּמִּשְׁפָּט - And make us righteous with justice</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>i.e. Hashem will resultantly view us in a positive light - measure for measure</p>\n<p>A similar approach is taken by the Chavos Yair and Rabbi Elazar Kalir...</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.702.8?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Yechezkel</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאלו לחכמה חוטא מה עונשו, א\"ל חטאים תרדף רעה, שאלו לנבואה חוטא מה עונשו א\"ל הנפש החוטאת היא תמות. שאלו לתורה חוטא מה עונשו א\"ל (סה) יביא אשם ויתכפר לו. שאלו להקב\"ה חוטא מה עונשו, א\"ל יעשה תשובה ויתכפר לו</p>\n<p>They asked wisdom - what is a sinner's punishment? He said, sins will pursue evil. The asked prophecy - what is a sinner's punishment? He said, the soul that sins will die. They asked Torah - what is a sinner's punishment? He said, he should bring a guilt offering and it will atone for him. They asked Hashem - what is a sinner's punishment? He said he will do Teshuva and that will repent for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The whole foundation of teshuvah is a great innovation, because according to the intelligent, teshuvah does not help, and as they said by wisdom and prophecy, there is no remedy for sin. Indeed, it is the way of the world that when a person rebels against a king, his ruling is to die and all his pleas and expressions of remorse will not be of any use.</p>\n<p>And yet, the power of teshuva is given only to Israel and not to the other nations of the world. This is due to the premise of measure-for-measure. Just as Jews fulfill the mitzvos of Hashem, so too they fulfill chukim for which they don't know the reason. Similarly, G-d provided Teshuva which is like a chok, in that it helps without any reason.</p>\n<p>This is why it says \"מַגִּ֣יד דְּבָרָ֣ו לְיַעֲקֹ֑ב\" as Hashem provides the Jews with this medium of repentance which allows them to be atoned simply because \"חֻקָּ֥יו וּ֝מִשְׁפָּטָ֗יו לְיִשְׂרָאֵֽל\" - that they keep the statutes and laws as one, and they don't discern between knowing the reason and not. Thus, \"לֹ֘א עָ֤שָׂה כֵ֨ן ׀ לְכׇל־גּ֗וֹי\" (\"He did not do so for any other nation\") - the non-Jews don't have these statues and are only commanded on matters that are intellectually comprehensible.</p>\n<p>(In addition refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bnei_Yissaschar%2C_Kislev_and_Tevet.4.62.4?vhe=Bnei_Yisaschar,_Piotrkow_1883&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bnei Yissascher</a> and also note the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Yechiel_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ozharover Rebbe</a> in his Be'er Moshe on Parshas Mishpatim which brings the custom of the Maharil to say \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Machzor_Rosh_Hashanah_Ashkenaz%2C_Musaf%2C_First_Day_of_Rosh_Hashana%2C_Kedushah.14-15?vhe=The_Metsudah_Machzor._Metsudah_Publications,_New_York_--_he_(paragraph_ed.)&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">וצדקנו במשפט המלך המשפט - האוחז ביד מדת משפט</a>\" all in one breath which hints at the fact that despite Hashem acting as the King of judgement, it is nevertheless done with the \"middas\" - \"the attribute\" of judgment - a play on words alluding to מדה כנגד מדה).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Four Tzaddikim died only because of Snake's advice and never commited a sin!\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Shabbos 55b and Bava Basra 17a quotes a baraisa that says:</p>\n<p>There were four who died because of the advice of the snake and never commited a sin. They are the following: Binyamin the son of Yaakov, Amram the father of Moshe, Yishai the father of David, and Kilav the son of David.</p>\n<p>Amram- Heard a story from Midrash, when Pharoah passed a decree to kill all male babies when they were born, Amram divorced Yocheved in fear of giving brith to a male baby and he would be killed, since he was a leader at that time, his followers too did the same thing. Later by Miriam's advice he remarried Yocheved. So is this act of Amram - giving divorce - the seperation of husband and wife - wasn't considered a sin? Did he not lack faith in Hashem and did so?</p>\n<p>Yishai - Coming to Yishai father of David, there was a long story regarding Kind David's birth. Due to the unawareness of Nitzevet's pregnancy of David, but having compassion on her, Yishai ordered his sons not to touch her. “Do not kill her! Instead, let the child that will be born be treated as a lowly, and despised servant.\nHow come a Tzaddik like Yishai order a harsh decree on an innocent child, who was not born yet? As we can see in the Psalm 69, the agony of King David, he passionately gives voice to the heaviest burdens of His soul, he says \"he has become a stranger to his brothers\", why was Yishai silent when the innocent David is being treated so ruthless, is this not considered a sin for Yishai? Being in a such higher level how could he do this?</p>\n<p>Binyamin- The Talmud lists seven people whose deaths were not due to sin, but from G‑d Himself, and as such, their bodies do not rot in their graves. Elsewhere, we are told of four people whose deaths were solely due to the Primordial Sin and not to any shortcoming of their own. Benjamin is on both lists.</p>\n<p>I was just curious to know about Binyamin...coz i cannot find any stories regarding him...want to know why he was considered so righteous? Can i find anything about his character from Oral Torah?</p>\n<p>Kilav - Nothing much said about him...he was identified as a son born to David and Abigael. Berakhot 4a:11-13 - \"He was exceedingly wise\".\nI got a question here...If he was wise and sinless why did Solomnon become King after David and not him. So then i got to know that he died very young...and there is an opinion may be he died before his Father.\nMy question is if Kilav was innocent and blameless why didn't he live a long life? What made him to die so young?\nOne might answer \"may be God wanted to take him to the Gan Eden because of his merit!\" - But my opinion is - Olam Haze needs the light of the righteous and not Olam Haba...it would be good to remain righteous live in this world a long term of life so that they can bring more light and enlighten many people.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>So with regard to Binyamin there are a few source that speak of his greatness...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.15.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehillim/Shocher Tov 15</a> - \"לא רגל על לשונו. זה בנימין שהיה יודע במכירתו של יוסף \"ולא גילה לאביו - \"And to not speak ill of one's neighbor.

The phrase “covers it” is understood to mean that Binyamin is continually focused upon that site. Therefore, Benjamin was privileged by becoming the host [ushpizekhan] of the Divine Presence, as the Holy of Holies was built in his portion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here is a principle we can use, according to Rabbi Yochanan:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.108a.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 108a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(בראשית ו, ט) אלה תולדות נח [נח איש צדיק תמים היה בדורותיו] א\"ר יוחנן\nבדורותיו ולא בדורות אחרים וריש לקיש אמר בדורותיו כ\"ש בדורות אחרים</p>\n<p>“These are the generations of Noah; Noah was a righteous man, and\nwholehearted in his generations” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.9?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 6:9</a>), Rabbi Yoḥanan\nsays: of his generation, but not of other generations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah is just, and justice demands that we judge people correctly, taking all extenuating circumstances into account. One important extenuating circumstance, brought here by Rabbi Yochanan, is the extenuating circumstance of judging someone according to the standards of his own generation, not the standards of future generations. Therefore, in this case, Noach was a Tzaddik compared to the generation of the flood, not Abraham's generation.</p>\n<p>A stronger question is that Amram committed bona fide sins. He married his aunt, and when they were briefly divorced, she remarried in the interim, which is forbidden. So the answer brought to this supports the answer we are giving: it is brought by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.26.5.1?ven=Commentary_on_the_Torah_by_Ramban_(Nachmanides)._Translated_and_annotated_by_Charles_B._Chavel._New_York,_Shilo_Pub._House,_1971-1976&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Exodus.6.20.1?ven=Chizkuni,_translated_and_annotated_by_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> et al. that that was before the Torah was given, so those sins are not taken into account.</p>\n<p>If so, why were there not more than 4 on this list?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.55b.3?lang=bi&with=Penei%20Yehoshua&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Penei Yehoshua</a> answers that it's not that they didn't sin at all in their life, but any sin they committed, they atoned for and therefore didn't need to die for.</p>\n\n\n",

This is the time period which spans the current 6,000 year window, when a soul is dressed in a physical and material body for the purpose of <em>labor</em> or <em>work</em>.</p>\n<p>At the end of ones lifespan (however long that term may be), their soul departs from that physical and material body and ceases to be enclothed within it.</p>\n<p>That process is what is described as death (being dead). What are described as the five elements of the soul (Nefesh (or Living Soul, because it is the interface between the material, physical world and the Spiritual realm), Ruach, Neshamah, Chayah and Yechidah) separate for most people and enter into what is called the <em>World of Souls</em> (עולם הנשמות). When the Nefesh separates from the other soul elements, that individual loses the ability to interact with <em>This World</em> (עולם הזה). This is what is truly meant in Torah literature by the term death. This is discussed in detail by Rabbi Elazar Roke'ach in his commentary to the Mishnah, Ma'aseh Roke'ach, parshat Yitro 119 and also by the Vilna Ga'on, Sefer Orot HaGra, Adam, 15.</p>\n<p>In this context, it is worth noting that there are a select few individuals who, because of their unique soul quality, do not experience this separation of their five soul elements when it separates from their physical, material body. Even after their soul leaves their material body, entering the World of Souls (עולם הנשמות), they continue to have the ability to interact and affect This (physical and material) World (עולם הזה). These are the individuals who are said to <em>never die</em> or to <em>ascend alive</em>, like Chanoch ben Yered, Yaacov Avinu and Eliyahu HaNavi.</p>\n<p>In the initial (12 month period of that first) year when the soul separates from the physical, material body, there is a process of judgement or assessment, which determines the next stage of spiritual development for that individual. The completion of that judgement process can be very quick, even like the blink of an eye or extend over the majority of that first year.</p>\n<p>If the lifespan of that individual (the time when that soul was dressed within its physical, material body) is judged meritorious, that soul ascends within the World of Souls to what is called Gan Eden (<em>characterized by peace, tranquility, harmony, pleasure and non-violence</em>) and its various stages.</p>\n<p>There are broad, general categories referred to as the Lower Gan Eden and the Upper Gan Eden, but in texts that discuss this in more detail, it refers to 3,000 levels which correspond to the 3,000 allegories of Shlomo HaMelech. That each allegory is a level and kind of concealment of the true nature of G-d, a <em>Hiding of His Face</em>, so to speak. By ascending from level to level in Gan Eden within the World of Souls, referred to by the Hebrew phrase לך מחיל אל חיל, the individual achieves greater merit,  removes the garment associated with that particular, lower level and achieves a more clear and undistorted perception of G-d. These different levels of clarity are often referred to by the terms אספקלריא המאירא and אספקלריא שאינו מאירא.</p>\n<p>If the lifespan of that individual is judged lacking, that soul descends within the World of Souls to what is called Gehinom (גיהנם) (which has a connotation of <em>violence</em> (חמס). <strong>This is the first descent to Gehinom.</strong> It is also associated with the ideas of humiliation and embarrassment over realization of the wasted opportunity to achieve closeness to G-d which are connected with the heat from the <em>allegorical</em> flames of fire. It is worth noting that this is not speaking about actual violence or physical fire, but is a consequence of the quality of the lifespan that was lived by that individual while dressed in their physical, material body.</p>\n<p>According to the teaching of some, there are five general levels to this domain in the World of Souls (which derive from those letters which have a final form (כ׳ך, מ׳ם, נ׳ן, פ׳ף, צ׳ץ), the five Gevurot and the five Chassadim). According to others (like Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabbai and Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla) there are seven general levels to Hell, corresponding to the seven levels of Heaven (and which derive from the seven doubling letters (ב,ג,ד,כ,פ,ר,ת) in the Aleph-Beit, meaning whether the letter has a dagesh or not). For detailed discussion of this subject, see Sha'ar HaGemul by Ramban and also Sefer Avodat HaKodesh by Rabbi Meir Ibn Gabbai.</p>\n<p>Both the Gan Eden consequence and the Gehinom consequence are the proper and appropriate result from the assessment of that particular soul at the conclusion of its lifespan, measure for measure. That consequence is intended by the Creator only for the good of that particular soul and to its benefit and ultimate improvement.</p>\n<p>The Torah sorts these individuals of the Human Race into two general groups, those who are called the Children of Israel and those who are called The Children of Noach.</p>\n<p>The Torah says that in general, the Children of Israel, for a variety of reasons, conclude their individual lifespans with an assessment of overall  merit. As a consequence, those souls ascend to some level of Gan Eden. This is why, for example, that Kaddish is not recited for a full 12 months for any Jew. Because their lifetime assessment is found to be meritorious by the 11th month at the latest.</p>\n<p>Among the Children of Noach, there are some whose individual lifespan is assessed as meritorious. They are called the Righteous of the Gentile Nations (חסידי אומות העולם) and similar to the Children of Israel, ascend to their appropriate levels of Gan Eden. Some from this category are assessed as lacking and descend to Gehinom in this World of Souls for an additional process of soul refinement. (It is important to note that as used here, ascent and descent are describing the experience of individual closeness to the Creator.) This is what is referred to in some places within Torah as <em>Immersion in a River of Fire</em>, similar to the idea of smelting and refining metal. This is what is discussed, for example, in the prophesy of Daniel, chapter 2.</p>\n<p>Toward the end of the 6,000 year time period the Torah teaches that there is a spiritual reassessment which is called <em>the Great and Awesome Day of Judgement</em>. (Joel 3:4, Malachi 3:23)</p>\n<p>At this time is the period of the general resurrection (which includes both those still called <em>living</em>, like Eliyahu HaNavi and also of the dead, when both those who were initially judged as meritorious and those who were judged lacking will be resurrected. This period of resurrection includes both the Children of Israel and the Children of Noach, both those who were elevated to Gan Eden and those who descended to Gehinom.</p>\n<p>All those who were initially assessed as meritorious will remain meritorious, but will be assessed for their spiritual, soul accomplishments that have occurred in Gan Eden. Additional accomplishments from this will be rewarded  with increased elevation and closeness to the Creator. This is discussed in great detail by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in Derech HaShem.</p>\n<p>For the Children of Israel, their final assessment will included both a reward for the soul and a reward for their bodies. This is because of the nature of the commandments that they were tasked with, both <em>positive and negative commandments</em>. Their <em><strong>positive commandments pertain the their bodies</strong></em>, while their <em><strong>negative commandments pertain to the soul</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>For the Children of Noach, their elevation and final assessment is for their soul only. This is because the quality and nature of their <em>commandments</em> are only negative/prohibitive. There are positive acts, like charity and acts of kindness that they can perform for their final benefit, but they are not commandments, so the nature of their benefit is different and spiritual only, not bodily.</p>\n<p>Among the Children of Noach who were originally assessed as lacking and judged to descend to the state of Gehinom (the Smelting/Refinement Process), they will have a final assessment over their efforts during that  continued refining period. It will be determined what they have achieved toward additional, individual refinement, improvement and elevation and whether their best ultimate reward is to remain in a state of eternal refinement and improvement or an elevation to some mixture of the Gan Eden level.</p>\n<p>Each individuals final assessment is only for their good and their ultimate closeness to the Creator. For some, their best and eternal final reward state will be one in the state of Gehinom, perpetual and continuous refinement. <strong>Those who are judged this way return a second time to Gehinom.</strong> That is how they best experience a closeness to the Creator.</p>\n\n\n",

The Midrash as repeated by Rav Ovadiah ztl. described an elder who came to Avraham’s tent and, after receiving free hospitality took out his idol in order to offer thanks. Avraham demurred and tried to show him the error of his ways. After the conversation—of numerous hours-- the man again took out his idol. For the lack of respect, Avraham asked him to leave. Hashem appeared to Avraham and told him that He was waiting 90 years for the chance to have this man influenced by Avraham in order to have him see the error of his ways. Avraham sent for the man and encouraged the man to return. After extended conversation and a refill on the provisions, the man took out the idol and instead of praying to it, smashed it noting that the extended hospitality clearly demonstrated a higher belief system than the idol. Rav Ovadiah added that we clearly see the importance of not giving up on someone – even at 90 – and that Hashem still waits for him....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone know where this Midrash is?</p>\n\n\n",

He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הגדתי היום לה' אלוקיך, “I have declared today to the Lord your G’d, etc.” The word “your G’d,” instead of “our G’d,” seems incomprehensible here. How could the person making this declaration be allowed to exclude himself from the community by using such wording (grammar)? It appears as if he did not share the same belief in G’d as his compatriots! However, consider that if the wording had been לה' אלוקינו, it would not have been clear whom he considered as the Lord. <strong>Now that he uses the wording written by the Torah it is clear that when he addresses the High Priest he speaks of the Lord on whose behalf this Priest officiates. The moment he associates the Lord with the one in whose service the Priest serves, there can be no doubt that the donor also serves the same Lord, else why present the gift to the High Priest of that G’d? It is clear now that whoever is the G’d of the High Priest is also the G’d of the person bringing the bikkurim.</strong> (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Hakohen Rabinowicz, the Tiferes Shlomo, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Tiferet_Shlomo%2C_on_Torah%2C_Ki_Tavo.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes (Ki Tavo)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is known that the tzaddik has the ability to raise the prayers to Hashem and through the tzaddik everything can be raised</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the posuk is telling us to bring the bikkurim to the Kohen.

It says that if someone important accepts a gift, it is as if the important person had given a present to the giver because of the pleasure the acceptance of the gift affords the giver by accepting the present. [...] The Torah uses the verb \"take\" in this sense with reference to the bikkurim. It implies that those making the offering thereby \"take\" or accept from G-d a gift [...] (Maayanah Shel Torah, parashas Ki Savo, p. 300).</p>\n<p>The Novominsker Rebbe quotes the Ishbitzer Rebbe in his Mei HaShiloach. The Ishbitzer Rebbe <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.26.3?lang=bi&with=Mei%20HaShiloach&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Telling” or hagada in Hebrew, hints at difficult things. With this he will say difficult things before the Cohen. He hints to him that even though the Cohen works in the Holy Temple and he works in the fields, nevertheless, when this farmer reaches the Temple in Jerusalem and brings bikkurim, first-fruit offerings, then it becomes perfectly clear that any place any action that was done with Kedusha (sanctity), no matter how simple, was like the service of the Cohen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Novominsker goes on to say that there is a difference between the work of a Kohen and that of a farmer. The work of a farmer seems to be non-spiritual, not as a Kohen's \"job\", whose essence is avodas Hashem. But.... \"the farmer's hands may be dirtied with soil, his face wet with perspiration, but his aspiration is kirvas Elokim\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is why the Kohen and the Yisrael lift the basket together. Now the two are on the same level, serving Hashem equally. The Yisrael tells the Kohen: \"Today I come to tell Hashem, <strong>your</strong> G-d, the G-d that <strong>you</strong> serve here each and every day, that I too have reached that level of kedusha\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Novominsker ends with saying that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The goal of bikkurim was to raise the mundane activities of the farmer to kedusha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://judaicaplaza.com/products/noc2h\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Novominsk on Chumash, vol. 2 (by Rabbi Yecheskel Ostreicher)</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Not naming a child \"Akiva\" - minhag?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently spoke to a person who said that their rabbi advised them against naming their child \"Akiva\" because of his ill-fated death; it was some sort of negative omen. Regardless, the couple liked the name Akiva and settled on keeping it, but only as a second name.</p>\n<p>I have never heard of such a (can we call it) custom. Does anyone know of a source for such a thing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>So firstly, by way of introduction, it is important to note the power of a name. The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.7b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 7b</a> famously notes that a name can affect the child's future.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, HaRav Moshe Sternbach shlita in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20026&st=&pgnum=415&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvos Vehanhagos, Vol 2, YD #501</a> when asked about whether one can name after a relative who was irreligious, makes a point of mentioning the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה שהנולד <strong>קשור למזל</strong> ומדות של הנפטר ולא קשור למעשיו</p>\n<p>And it appears that the child <strong>is connected to the mazal (luck/destiny)</strong> and the character attributes of the departed but not connected to his actions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As such, if the dead relative had a life marred by bad occurrences, who had a bad \"mazal\" - naming the child with the same name forms a similar type mazal. Which in this context, would be advisable to avoid.</p>\n<p>When digging further I came across the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Chasidim.244.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chasidim 244</a> which says outright that a person should not name after a relative that suffered etc.:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועוד אומר דברי' שהש' גורם לטובה או לרעה לטובה יש אדם שכל הנקראין בשמו יצליחו לגדולה זהו ויקרא בהם שמי ושם אבותי. וכתיב (ישעיהו סו כב) כי כאשר השמי' החדשי' והארץ החדשה אשר אני עושה עומדי' לפני אמר ה' כן יעמוד זרעכם ושמכם. וכתיב (ישעיהו מג א) קראתי בשמך לי אתה. הרי שיש אדם שכל אותם הנקראים על שמו יחיו ויהיו בניו קיימי' ויעמידו תולדות ויש שכל אלה להם להפך שנאמר (ישעיהו סה טו) והנחת' שמכם לשבועה לבחירי והמיתך ה' ולעבדיו יקרא שם אחר וכתיב (ישעיהו יד כב) והכרתי לבבל שם ושאר ונין ונכד וכתיב (איוב יח יט) לא נין ולא נכד בעמו ואין שריד במגוריו. וכתיב (איוב יח יז) ולא שם לו על פני חוץ. לכן יתפלל אדם שכל הנקראי' בשמו יהיו בהם מדות טובות האלה ולא אחת מן המדות הרעות ושלא יקראו זרעו על אותן שמדות הרעות תלויות בהן. כיצד יראה אדם כשיש שני אחי' וקראו שם בניהם ובנותיהם אחר שם פלוני אפילו אחר צדיק ומתו בלא תולדות. <strong>או שהיו הכתובים למעלה לרעה בהם אל יקראו יותר באותו השם ר\"ל</strong> שקראו לו שם בגורל מתוך הספר כאשר עושין לחולה או בשני אחי' נתקיי' למאן דאמ' שני' לחזקה ולמאן דאמר שלשה לחזק' פעמים שהאחי' קוראי' בשם אותו האיש ונכשלים זרעו או האחים קראו את בניהם אחר אביהם ומתו והבנו' קראו בניהן וחיו ויש שם פלוני שכל המשפחה שלו אם קראו זרעם בשמם מתו בלא תולדות ולא האריכו ימיהם ובכל ענינים האלו לנקבות ובשם שירא' החכם שכך הוא אל יאמר אקיי' לאבותי שם שלא ישכח והוא רואה שנקראים אחרים ונכשלו הרי הוא נושא אל נפשו עון. ואין אלו הדברים משום ניחוש שהרי הראשונים היו קוראים את בניהם על שם המאורע ולא מתו. אא\"כ חטאו בער ואונן לכך יהיו צדיקים שזרעם מתים ולא מחמת עון. אלא שאלו הדברים הזיקו ואע\"פ כן יש לאדם לחשוב שמא בעונו הוא וכל שמתים בניו ואחרים קראו אחר פלוני וזה קראו כמו כן ומתו הרי נגזר עליו לפי שכינו אחרים שם כמוהו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n<p>I came across this link <a href=\"https://www.bvkkosher.com/naming---halacha-and-hashkafa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (see Part II) which has several sources.

In other words, that there was a physical man, and physical worlds, which were later destroyed. Only afterwards was our world created, which is now 5716 years old. This interpretation is indeed offered in several books, as well as in the works of some of the early Kabbalists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In areas of Kabbala, as in all areas of Torah, there is only validity to opposing views until a ruling is reached and issued in accordance with the parameters of Torah discussion. Once a ruling is issued according to one opinion, only this opinion is considered true and valid with regard to practical decisions and actions. The same is true in this regard:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until the Arizal, there was a discussion and debate. The Arizal, however, is considered authoritative on Kabbala by world Jewry, including both Ashkenazim (such as the Alter Rebbe and the Gaon of Vilna) and Sephardim. He clearly expressed his deciding view by saying that the intent was never that there was a physical world similar to the one that now exists, as a physical cosmos came about only in the current “Shemita cycle.”7 From the Torah’s perspective, one may no longer attempt to explain events (such as how Creation actually happened, etc.) in any manner at odds with his view.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Footnote 7 there points to <a href=\"https://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/toraor/12/51d.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Ohr of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, 51d</a>.

The non-Jews I study with keep insisting they are Jews, because they feel that studying Kabbalah makes them Jewish. I try to accept their identity, but sooner or later I find myself upset by it. I feel that it’s somehow insulting my grandparents and ancestors for all they experienced, and for continuing to keep Torah and mitzvot through it all.<br />\nBut there is something more than that inside me that I don't understand. It makes me angry and, even more than that, like I want to cry. It goes away for a while and then it comes back up. Is this just a personal issue or could there be some reason from our history that I can't shake this disturbing feeling?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Jews are a family. Imagine some random stranger walks into your house and tells you that if you don't adopt them, you're a bigoted supremacist. It's insane. Similarly, if a non-Jew claims to be a Jew, feeling that they're wrong is not only normal, but indicative of mature emotional understanding. In fact, it would be entirely rational to feel anger, not just displeasure. (This is a major provocational point for reform and conservative “converts”).</li>\n<li>The few people who actually understand Kabbalah also know that Kabbalah is an intimate secret that isn't shared freely with everyone, nor with all Jews, nor even with all Rabbis. Rather, Kabbalah is reserved only for the most naturally intelligent, good-willed, trustworthy, humble, experienced, extensively knowledgeable, adult Rabbis, and only in small groups where each student can be taught precisely and clearly with no mistakes whatsoever. Therefore, you are ABSOLUTELY <strong>NOT</strong> learning Kabbalah.<br />\nThere are dozens of fake organizations out there that make up a bunch of pseudo-magical ideas and slap words like “Keter” and “Elyon” on them, then market themselves as teaching Kabbalah for a hefty price. They’re basically a more organized version of those guys who sell “Cabala charms” on the street. It’s all a giant scam. Stop being scammed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The deep “disturbing” feeling you’ve been experiencing comes from being expected to accept these random strangers as part of the Jewish people, simply because they identify as such. As a Jew, it doesn’t matter how strongly you are convinced that they’re right; in the deepest part of your soul, you know that they’re not your brothers. You’re feeling the conflict between what you’re trying to accept and what you know in your soul. To resolve the conflict, understand that their identification with the Jewish people is completely wrong, and stop giving your money to that “organization”.</p>\n<p>Don't let anyone pressure you into validating non-Jewish appropriation of not just Jewish culture, but Jewish status itself. We have enough crazies in the world already. You have enough critical thought to ask this question; don't lose that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>One of the reasons a Jew will get upset when gentiles claim to be Jews is similar to the case mentioned below.</p>\n<p>A veteran of the US military, let's say a navy Seal, who went through war/conflict  and saw it all, goes to the mall and sees a faker with a navy seal badge walking around. That will infuriate the veteran. It is common sense why it will infuriate him and I will not go through the psychological aspects of it.\nThis concept is known as '<strong>Stolen Valor</strong>'.</p>\n<p>The same concept applies here. When a goy claims he is a Yid, then that is <strong>stolen valor</strong>. Not cool to do that! Either go through boot camp and prove yourself in battle or just leave it alone. (Boot camp and proving yourself in battle in this case would be going through an orthodox conversion and living every moment according to the Torah).</p>\n<p>Edit: You don't have to prove anything after conversion. I don’t want to sound like converts have a special mitzvah or obligation to prove themselves. They are just as Jewish as anyone. If they excel then fine, if they are mediocre that’s fine too. That’s a different topic. But you get the point.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If a non-Jew transgresses halacha while claiming to be a Jew, other Jews may be misled by his actions.

The Satmar Rav quotes the sefer Zera Kodesh and says that through Torah study and mitzvos, they uplifted the holy sparks and these places would have the same kedusha as a Beis Midrash.</p>\n<p>This seems to contradict the teaching of the Har Tzvi Frank, who explains that in one of these places, they were far off from Torah. They were fallen into the hands of earthly desires.</p>\n<p><strong>How to resolve this?</strong> Are there sources that explain that in all of these places, the Jewish people would study Torah? From the one source, it would seem that they have fallen prey to the earthly desires, and from that it can be concluded they weren't involved the way the Satmar Rav explains they were..</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>My understanding of this is based off of the Lubavitcher Rebbe's explanation of sin, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMD-i-qFmkU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this sicha</a>.</p>\n<p>The answer is that there are two ways to rescue a spark. The first is to be tempted by an aveira, and resist. This is inevitable, part and parcel of life in this lowest world.</p>\n<p>The second way is to actually perform the aveira, ch'v, and do teshuva from ahava. This second way is where we can resolve your contradiction: As the Rebbe explains, the word \"אסור\" means \"bound\", i.e. the spark in the aveira is tied up and we can't access it. The practical of this is we are not allowed to perform a sin <em>lechatchila to rescue a spark</em>. That doesn't work.</p>\n<p>However, if the sin is performed \"lishma\", i.e. the person gives in to temptation, and then they do teshuva, this is indeed a very powerful way to rescue the spark, and is therefore, from Hashem's eternal point of view - the point of view of the cosmic plan - what was meant to happen, and a net good.</p>\n<p>Therefore, when it is described as terrible, and we must seek a remedy, that's right. From our point of view, we are meant to flee from sin at all costs. When it is described as \"a rectification that needed to occur\", this is also true. That is generally \"none of our business\", but BH Hashem tell us many spiritual secrets that we should treat with awe and respect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Is there any contradiction? I don't think so. Kivrot Hata'avah means coming into the grip of our earthy lustful desires. This happens when we learn less, and this is what Rav Tzvi Pesach Frank is teaching us: <em>what</em> happens when we learn less. Rav Yoel Teitelbaum is adding <em>why</em> there are ta'avot in the first place, and explains our mission with regards to them. As the former explains (and I've mentioned in this answer), we aren't, <em>lechatchila</em> supposed to go to Kivrot Hata'avah, but one way or another, it is our mission in life to rescue the sparks there, as taught by the latter. How? Both tell us: strengthening Torah study.</p>\n\n\n",

[Deuteronomy 26:2-11]  The Rambam says that all donations for the sake of God should be of the best goods we possess:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything given for the sake of the Almighty should be of the most attractive and highest quality. If one builds a house of prayer, it should be more attractive than his own dwelling. If he feeds a hungry person, he should feed him from the best and most tasty foods of his table. If he clothes one who is naked, he should clothe him with his attractive garments. Whenever one designates something for a holy purpose, he should sanctify the finest of his possessions; as [Leviticus 3:16] states: \"All of the choicest quality should be given to God.\" [Mishneh Torah, Things Forbidden on the Altar 7:11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe includes in this rule: (1) sacred studies before secular studies in school and (2) if you have two occupations, one to pay the bills and another to benefit the community, give priority to the second.</p>\n<p>Both seem to expand \"for the sake of God\" quite liberally, and don't appear to specify a limit.  That bothers me.</p>\n<p>My question: Does \"giving to God\" really apply this far?  What if you don't give of the best?  It's better than giving nothing.  Charity is charity, no?

He talks there about the\ngreat men of our past who were chosen by Hakadosh\nBaruch Hu. 'Now, it really is worthwhile to study the\nfollowing subject,' he says, 'the subject of why\nHakadosh Baruch Hu favored these great\npersonalities.'</p>\n<p>It’s a subject we should investigate. What was\nthe reason Hakadosh Baruch Hu loved Avraham so\ngreatly? Why did He love Moshe Rabbeinu so greatly?\nWe think we know. We know that Avraham had ten\ntrials, asarah nisyonos, and he passed them all\nsuccessfully, and so on. Moshe Rabbeinu was\ndevoted to his people, and he was a servant of\nHashem with all his heart; an eved ne’eman. So we think we know what made them great. But we’re\nmaking a big error. We don’t understand at all the\ngreatness of our great men.</p>\n<p>Now listen to what the Mesillas Yesharim says.\nI’ll read it in English: He says, 'This, in truth, is the\ntest that the servants of Hashem were tested with,\nand this is what set apart each one according to his\ndegree of greatness. What was the test? It was a test\nof who was capable of purifying his heart more — he\nwas the one who was closer to Hashem and more\nbeloved to Him.' What does that mean? So, he\nexplains: 'When they did their ordinary deeds — not\nthe great deeds that are written about in the Torah,\nthe heroic deeds of self-sacrifice that we always\nspeak about — but even their daily deeds, they were\ndone with the intention of serving Hakadosh Baruch\nHu.'</p>\n<p>When Avraham Avinu was busy managing his\nsheep and his cattle — that was his business: raising\nlivestock — he was thinking always about serving\nHakadosh Baruch Hu. When Avraham was in his tent\nwith Sarah, or Sarah was in the tent with Avraham,\neach one was thinking about how to talk in a way\nthat would serve Hakadosh Baruch Hu.

They lived\nl’sheim Shamayim.\"</p>\n<p>He goes on further, but I'll leave it with that. I know I quoted a lot here but I think every word is very important. I believe that this is what truly separated Avraham and the rest of the Avos from the rest of the world and made them so worthy of Hashem's love.</p>\n<p>We also see written in the Kuzari (1:47): \"'Four thousand and five hundred. The years detailed in our Torah [by chronicling the generations of man],  starting from the time of Adam, Shes, and Enosh, and down to Noach; then to Shem and Ever; then down to Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, and then down to Moshe. These people were the heart and elite of mankind. Each had many children, [but the Torah does not list all of them by name]. Most of these children were like the peel of a fruit, not attaining their fathers' level, since they did not possess the same divine qualities. The Torah therefore only chronicles those descendants who maintained this divine quality, who were the minority of the individual's progeny. This was true until Yaakov, who fathered twelve tribes. Unlike the previous pattern, now each and every son was worthy of this divine quality. It was in this nation of twelve tribes that divinity settled, and this nation preserved the chronicling of mankind...'\"</p>\n<p>We see from here that not all of us are so special and worthy of Hashems love to be the chosen people, and that the ones that <strong>were</strong> worthy were <strong>so</strong> great that they were deserving of the Torah. When the time came that the twelve tribes were born, Hashem rested the Shechina on the and made a nation out of the twelve tribes in their merit and the merit of their divine forefathers.</p>\n<p>I beleive this answers questions 1 and 2, no nation deserved the Torah like the Jewish nation and this is why they were chosen.</p>\n<p>Now as for question 3, I have thought about it, and I may be wrong, but here is something that I thought of: There is a well known <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nitzavim.3.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">midrash</a> that we were all by Har Sinai and accepted the Torah, we knew what we were getting into and accepted anyway. As for the non-Jews, I think it may have been something like this, and I hope someone corrects me if I am mistaken: We know that if a non-Jew wants to convert, we highly discourage it, and one of the simple reasons is because it is extremely difficult to follow all of the mitzvos, especially if someone wasn't raised that way. If someone can't follow the mitzvos well and is a Jew, he is punished for that. A non-Jew must only follow the seven Noachide laws. We also know that humans are dumb and make many bad decisions, and I can imagine that Hashem would ask our souls rather than us literally because the soul truly knows what it is accepting upon itself. The soul would also see it as a gamble. It is highly more likely for a goy to keep the Noachide laws than a Jew to keep all the mitzvos (need proof? what percentage of the Jews today in the world are religious, observant Jews?). So, if the soul has a much higher chance of getting into heaven as a goy (or at least avoid a lot of punishment or even kares), it will most of the time choose that. True, the reward for being a good Jew is immensely higher, but it's combined with a greater risk and probability of being a Jew who is not observant.</p>\n<p>I know this is a long winded response, but hopefully I have made a good point. I really want people to point out any flaws in my logic and reasoning and if this answer gets at least 5 likes I'll accept it as a valid answer. Thank you for reading!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If the Jewish nation was better than other nations, then there's no choice - what, is Hashem going to choose anything but the best? No, and also, that's not what Divine choice means.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Hashem never changes<sup>1</sup>, and can't be affected<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, there are no \"options\" for Him.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At the same time, Hashem is ultimately free. Nobody tells the God of Avraham what to do<sup>3</sup>! He is not limited in any way<sup>4</sup>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how do we resolve this paradox?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have a sibling, who I didn't choose. There is a bond between us due to how destiny brought us together, but also I didn't choose her so there is no romance. I have a wife, who I did choose. I could have chosen any woman on the planet, but I chose her, and therefore the bond we share is very personal, but as it was not destined, there is a boundary between us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Torah teaches us that even though we choose our spouse, the choice is also destined<sup>5</sup>. Hashem guides people to their soul mate.</p>\n<p>This gives us a chance to do something Godly, which is choose <em>that which is destined</em>.</p>\n<p>The resolution to the paradox<sup>6</sup> is, a truly \"free\" choice means a choice completely uninfluenced by anything other than oneself - this is Divine Free Will. It's got nothing to do with \"options\". There is no option to those who are \"destined\". Yet, in Godliness, it is possible to still <em>choose</em>. One way to think about it in finite terms is saying \"even if they are not my destiny, I would have chosen them\". How is this possible? How does it work? There's no way to describe it, it is <em>beyond reason</em>.</p>\n<p>It's the best of both worlds. This person is my other half, yet I choose them, and my heart can't tell the difference. The way I feel about them is romantic and <em>personal</em> even though they were destined, and the bond is solid and eternal.</p>\n<p>So no, the Jewish nation were not chosen because they were better, or any other <em>reason</em>. He chose them because that's who He is<sup>7</sup>.</p>\n<p>As Dr. Mizrachi <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/136692/31534\">put it</a>, love doesn't need a reason!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - See Torah Ohr Megilat Ester 99B and sources there.<br />\n2 - Moreh Nevuchim 1:52<br />\n3 - Mishneh Torah Laws of Idolatry 1:2<br />\n4 - Avodat Hakodesh 1:8, Gevurot Hashem Hakdama 2<br />\n5 - Moed Katan 18b<br />\n6 - Based on the teachings of the last Lubavitcher Rebbe. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldThqpY-Pu4&pp=ygUYZnJlZSB3aWxsIG1hbmlzIGZyaWVkbWFuhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldThqpY-Pu4&pp=ygUYZnJlZSB3aWxsIG1hbmlzIGZyaWVkbWFu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> is a good introduction to the topic of Divine Free Will<br />\n7 - Hashem and His will are identical - Moreh Nevuchim, e.g. 3:13</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Why Choose Us?<br/>\nOur relationship with Hashem is based on the fact that Hashem chose us because we chose Him.\nAs the Torah tells us, “Now if you obey Me and keep My covenant, you shall be My special treasure among all nations, even though all the world is Mine. You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation to Me.”<br/>\nWhy did Hashem choose us in the first place? It was not in our own merit, though we did have merit. Hashem chose us because He had made a promise to our forefathers.<br/>\nAs the Torah says:<br/></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are a nation consecrated to Hashem your G-d. Hashem your G-d chose you to be His special people among all the nations on the face of the earth. It was not because you had greater numbers than all the other nations that Hashem embraced you and chose you; you are among the smallest of all the nations. It was because of Hashem’s love for you, and because He was keeping the oath that He made to your fathers. Hashem therefore brought you out with a mighty hand, liberating you from the slave house, and from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. You must realize that Hashem your G-d is the Supreme Being. He is the faithful G-d, who keeps in mind His covenant and love for a thousand generations when it comes to those who love Him and keep His commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it was not only because we accepted Hashem as our G-d. That is a part of it, but it was also, or perhaps primarily, because of the Patriarchs. The promise Hashem made to them will last for at least one thousand generations, which is 20 thousand years, even when we sin. So far, it’s been only 4,000 years since the Patriarchs, not 20,000. Therefore, Hashem’s promise is still in effect. So since our merit was not the reason Hashem chose us, our sins and lack of merit can’t take it away. Hashem made a promise, and Hashem will never break that promise.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the foreigners who attach themselves to Hashem to serve Him and to love Hashem’s Name, to be His servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath and doesn’t profane it and who holds fast to My covenant; I will bring them to My holy mountain, and will let them rejoice in My house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted favorably on My altar, for My Temple shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Its also the verb used in Genesis 30: 27 when Laban says: \"And Laban said to him, “Please stay, if I have found favor in your eyes, for I have learned by experience that the Lord has blessed me for your sake\". The words 'learned by experience' is the English translation of nachash.</p>\n<p>How does this then explain what the nachash was in Genesis 3? Was Eve 'learning by experience' that the fruit of the tree was desirable? Or was there indeed a physical presence of another kind there persuading her to eat of the fruit? Or is the yetser hara the nachash? Was this conversation between Eve and this nachash one between two beings or a conversation she was having with herself?</p>\n<p>The word used for 'said' in this conversation is 'amar' which differs from 'debar'.

There were study halls and the men would be there often, learning what we are learning now, but in oral form, directly from the mouths of the teachers (the teachers would keep written notes, and students would make their own personal notes). Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבינו הקדוש חיבר המשנה. ומימות משה רבינו ועד רבינו הקדוש לא חיברו חבור\nשמלמדין אותו ברבים בתורה שבעל פה. אלא בכל דור ודור ראש בית דין או נביא\nשהיה באותו הדור כותב לעצמו זכרון השמועות ששמע מרבותיו והוא מלמד על פה\nברבים. וכן כל אחד ואחד כותב לעצמו כפי כחו מביאור התורה ומהלכותיה כמו\nששמע. ומדברים שנתחדשו בכל דור ודור בדינים שלא למדום מפי השמועה אלא\nבמדה משלש עשרה מדות והסכימו עליהם בית דין הגדול.</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Hakadosh composed the Mishnah.

Instead, in each\ngeneration, the head of the court or the prophet of that generation\nwould take notes of the teachings which he received from his masters\nfor himself, and teach them verbally in public. Similarly, according\nto his own potential, each individual would write notes for himself of\nwhat he heard regarding the explanation of the Torah, its laws, and\nthe new concepts that were deduced in each generation concerning laws\nthat were not communicated by the oral tradition, but rather deduced\nusing one of the thirteen principles of Biblical exegesis and accepted\nby the high court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our tradition is replete with references to Torah study halls all the way back in time. An example would be the story of Hillel in Yoma 35b, who would attend the study hall of Shamaya and Avtalyon (and the famous story of how he could not afford entry one day and almost died in the snow on the roof, because he climbed up there to look through the skylight).</p>\n<p>Another example is from the days of King Chizkiyahu, who issued a strong decree for people to remain in the study hall (Sanhedrin 94b)</p>\n<p>Note, we have a principle of \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/83068/31534\">yeridat hadorot</a>\". The rest of the world scoffs at this idea \"people have been saying the youth are degenerate for all time, ignore it...\" is the cynical take of this fact. We take this fact literally - every generation has become more debased, the holiness and strength of the human being in general has declined over time. The reason I mention this is to explain that the study of Torah was on a much higher level back then, even among the simple folk, not on a lower level as the question seems to think is more reasonable.</p>\n<p>E.g.

    "content": "# Is addiction mutar?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How are the addictive properties of coffee different than other addictive substances which I assume is frowned upon in Judaism.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein Zt\"l writes in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&st=&pgnum=271&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe Yoreh Deah 3, 35</a> about the prohibition of smoking marijuana.\n“It is obviously forbidden to smoke marijuana, as this violates many basic laws of our Torah. First of all, it physically injures the person. Even if there are people who are not physically affected by this, it mentally affects the person as it destroys his mind, and prevents him from understanding things properly. This is a terrible thing, since not only can the individual not properly study Torah, he also can not pray and properly perform Mitzvos (commandments), since doing them mindlessly is considered as if they were not done at all. Furthermore, he is creating within himself a very strong desire (addiction?), which is much stronger than the desire to eat, etc. which are necessary for a person to live. There are many that can not control and withstand this desire. This is a very grave prohibition, as we find that a Ben Sorer U’Moreh [is killed] (See Deut. 21:18) for creating within himself a very strong desire, even though it is to eat Kosher food! How much more so it is forbidden for a person to bring upon himself an even greater desire, especially for something that a person does not need at all…\nAdditionally, the parents of the person smoking certainly are disturbed by his actions, in which case he is violating the Mitzvah of Kibbud Av V’Em (respect for parents). He is also violating the Mitzvah of “Kedoshim Ti’Hiyu”(be holy), as explained by the Ramban in his commentary on the Chumash (5 Books of Moses). This also leads him to transgress other prohibitions, besides the actual prohibition of taking drugs. The bottom line is that it is clear and obvious that this is one of the grave prohibitions, and everyone must try with all of their strength to remove this impurity (Tuma’ah) from all Children of Israel.”</p>\n<p>Accordingly, seeing as caffeine has not got any of these issues therefore it is not frowned upon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would hazard to guess from a purely logical perspective that the main reason is because whilst increased amounts of caffeine are not great for the person, they do not pose the same physical danger that alcohol, cigarettes and drugs do, and for that reason are not an issue.</p>\n<p>(Although, if it is having an adverse effect, I imagine both the medical and rabbinic advice would be to avoid it.)</p>\n<p>This is all based on the principal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 4:15</a> -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְנִשְׁמַרְתֶּ֥ם מְאֹ֖ד לְנַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶ֑ם</p>\n<p>“You shall guard your soul very well”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This injunction is understood to take care of one’s body and avoid taking any risks that might jeopardise one’s physical wellbeing.</p>\n<p>Note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.32.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 32:1</a> which encapsulates this requirement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הואיל והיות הגוף בריא ושלם מדרכי השם הוא שהרי אי אפשר שיבין או ידע דבר מידיעת הבורא והוא חולה לפיכך צריך האדם להרחיק את עצמו מדברים המאבדין את הגוף ולהנהיג את עצמו בדברים המברין והמחלימים את הגוף וכן הוא אומר ונשמרתם מאד לנפשותיכם</p>\n<p>Because the maintenance of a complete and healthy body is a G-dly path – since it is impossible to understand or apprehend any knowledge of the Creator when one is sick – therefore you must keep away from things that damage the body, and develop habits that improve the body and heal it. Similarly, it is said: “You shall guard your soul very well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly enough, since coffee is a stimulant, it is actually brought down in halacha as potentially a good thing. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.89.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 89:22</a> speaks about having it before davening if by consuming it, will enhance  a person's prayers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וטיי\"א וקאפ\"ע מותר לשתותו קודם תפלה כדי שיוכל לכוין דעתו ולהתפלל ובפרט בהמקומות שרגילין בהם ואין מתיישב הדעת בלתם...</p>\n<p>Tea and coffee are permitted to be drunk before prayer in order that one will be able to concentrate, especially in the places where he is used to and the mind does not settle down without it...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Coffee is beneficial for your liver. I'm sure there's a point of too much but so far the usual correlation of too much coffee and adverse health effects is from also smoking cigarettes. So the main difference is while too much coffee might be bad for you. Just enough is beneficial and that is not the case with addictive illegal drugs which are damaging at any amount</p>\n\n\n",

Ḥiyya bar Rav says: He first observes one day as Shabbat and then he counts six weekdays. (Source: Sefaria)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is according to Rav Huna, should the person who starts by assuming the current day is Sunday also make the blessing of Havdala to indicate that the previous day which s/he is treating as having been Shabbat is now concluded? Do any sources discuss this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First off, his assumption that it is Sunday does not mean the previous day was shabbat. So my initial thought would be that he wouldn't say havdala being that everything is a safek and this havdala would only be said as a remembrance.</p>\n<p>Though, if his assumption was correct, and it actually is Sunday, the question becomes whether shabbos is defined as you keeping shabbat or the day itself. Following the former reason, since he didn't keep that shabbat (This is a machloket rishonim whether one who unintentionally breaks shabbat is considered a mechalel.) I think he wouldn't have any reason to say havdala since he wasn't \"shomer shabbat\" (according to some rishonim). Or, on the flip side, is there kedusha inherently on the day and therefore whether he kept shabbat or not he would still have to make havdala.</p>\n<p>Regarding your title question, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.344.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shulchan aruch</a> says to make kiddush then havdala.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ההולך במדבר ואינו יודע מתי הוא שבת מונה שבעה ימים מיום שנתן אל לבו שכחתו ומקדש השביעי בקידוש והבדלה ואם יש לו ממה להתפרנס אסור לו לעשות מלאכה כלל עד שיכלה מה שיש לו ואז יעשה מלאכה בכל יום אפילו ביום שמקדש בו כדי פרנסתו מצומצמת ומותר לילך בו בכל יום אפי' ביום שמקדש בו:<br />\nOne who is wandering in the desert and does not know when is Shabbat, counts seven days from the day he realized he did not know, and sanctifies the seventh day with Kiddush and Havdalah. If one has sustenance, one is forbidden from doing any work whatsoever until he uses what he has, and thereafter one should do work each day, even on the day he sanctifies, to achieve minimal sustenance. One is permitted to walk every day, even on the day he sanctifies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is explicit in the כסף משנה on the rambam.</p>\n<p>The question at hand is if he gives permission. What essentially is being asked are there situations that a noachide is forbidden to do something although he is not חייב מיתה.\nThe source for forbidden sexual <em>related</em> actions that are the act of sexual relations itself is sourced from ויקרא פרק יח פסוק ו.\nאִ֥ישׁ אִישׁ֙ אֶל־כׇּל־שְׁאֵ֣ר בְּשָׂר֔וֹ לֹ֥א תִקְרְב֖וּ לְגַלּ֣וֹת עֶרְוָ֑ה אֲנִ֖י יְהֹוָֽה׃ {ס} \nThis is brought in numerous Rishonim like the  הר\"ן על עבודה זרה ט, א, בדפי הרי\"ף  and the rambam as well amongst others that claim this pasuk is the source that forbids to touch, stare, hug, kiss any woman who is forbidden as ערוה. Eventhough this would seemingly be a source that would forbid a non-jew with any sexually <em>related</em> acts(see <a href=\"https://wiki.jewishbooks.org.il/mediawiki/wiki/%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%90/%D7%A4%D7%91/%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תוספת יום כיפורים</a>), according to the כסף משנה and others this is limited to ערוה only, a married non-jewish woman is not forbidden as ערוה, since the source is from \"ודבק באשתו והיו לבשר אחד\" and not from \"איש איש\". See סנהדרין נח' ע\"ב.</p>\n<p>The only other source I found that might allude to a prohibition of לא תקרבו  would be from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.12a.19?lang=he&p2=Rashi_on_Megillah.12b.1.1&lang2=he&w2=all&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רשי מגילה יב ע\"ב</a>, which Rashi says Achashverosh and Vashti were committing adultery when he asked her to appear nude in his party. But I couldn't find anyone who sources from here explicitly.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, there is no issur in the context of the given question, however I believe chazal held if a non-jew delivers his wife to another man even for ביאה שלא כדרכה, there is no greater act of divorce possible, as a non-jew who only needs to \"send her from his home\" according to the Rambam in order to divorce her. And in this scenarios she is no definitely  no longer his wife to even consider this an act of adultery.</p>\n<p>I have a strong proof from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.82a.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 82</a>. There is an argument regarding  one of the reasons of a decree of the court of Hashmonaim prohibiting relations with a non-jew. רב דימי holds relations with a non-jew is like (and leads to ) אישות - relations with a married woman, and רבין disagrees because אישות לית להו. As Rashi explains \"שסתם כותית מופקרת ולא מיוחדת לבעלה ולא דמי לאשת איש\".<br />\nרב דימי holds \"ודאי נשייהו לא מפקרי\". This clearly indicates in both opinions that if they would be מפקיר their wives, they would not be considered married.\n    </p>\n\n\n",

That being said, the Babylonian Talmud was only recently completed c. 500 CE and was still undergoing some minor revisions afterwards. However, the Jerusalem Talmud was completed c. 300 CE.</p>\n<p>Having said that, my question is: a) Did the Himyarite Kingdom have access to the Oral Torah and thus follow the relevant procedures for conversion and understanding of the Tanakh and b) <em>If</em> not, then would their conversion be valid in the first place (though I am aware that there were obviously Roman converts before the Oral Torah was formally put down, but I am specifically asking in the context of the Himyarite Kingdom because its a bit distant from the rest of Judea and the Roman Empire)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As the Himyarites continues to practice pagan rituals and even worship the arabian sun goddess Shams, I doubt they were sincere converts, that is if they even converted bechlal.

Most people I know start with the apple in honey, but there are some who start with the date or pomegranate if they don’t have a date.</p>\n<p>From Halachapedia:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Halichot Shlomo (1:17) writes that one should make the HaEitz upon the dates because they’re from the seven species with which Eretz Yisrael was praised and they come before pomegranates on that list (see Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 211:4). Ben Ish Chai (Nitzavim #4) and Nitei Gavriel 29:4 agree. Kaf HaChaim 583:13 records the practice of some people to make a HaEitz on the apple to exempt the dates. He explains that perhaps they brought out the apple first, and in such a case, one need not wait for the dates to come out to make the bracha upon them. Rav Mordechai Lebhar (Magen Avot, Orach Chaim 583:1 fn. 472) reports how the Moroccan custom is to have the apples first and recite HaEtz on them, and that all the Machzorim list the Simanim that way. He argues that it's not an issue of Kedimah, because one doesn't really want to eat both the apple and the dates right now. This, he says, resolves Rav Shlomo Zalman's issue. Rivevot Efraim 8:558:3 writes that after making HaEitz on the dates, one may eat the apples prior to the pomegranates because the rules of precedence apply only regarding the Bracha, not regarding when each food should be eaten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Back in the Sephardic community of Egypt, the apple came first.

You'll also only find one person in a thousand who would do such a thing.</p>\n<p>What does the Torah say about such a person? Is it <em>bittul zman</em>, or is he just being silly, because there's no halachic issue? Is it fine, but nothing special? Is it considered a small or even great act of loving kindness even if 99 times in 100 someone just as fit as him (or nobody at all) ends up grabbing the spot anyway?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Is there a guiding principle that can help us here? Does this case translate to all walks of life? Are there sources that praise a person who doesn't run to always be the first in a line? Who doesn't always claim every legal/tax benefit he is entitled to if he doesn't need it? Who waits at a kiddush to let everyone else get what they want and then see if there is anything left for him? Not as a matter of personal growth and <em>perishut</em>, but in the context of <em>chesed</em>. [Let's leave out extreme examples that involve distracting factors such as <em>pikuach nefesh</em> etc]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a related principal that may be applied here. By leaving the parking spot/kiddush cake/spot in line, he has the potential that someone else who really needs it, might receive it. Although he has no control over that, if indeed someone who needs it does receive it, he gets credit. This idea is found in the Tosefta on Peah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כדאיתא בתוספתא דפאה (ת״כ דבורא דחובה פרשתא י״ב סי' י״ג) דאפילו איבד מעות ומצאן עני ג״כ מתברך מזה כיון דסוף סוף נהנה העני מזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, if someone lost money by mistake, and a needy person found it and used it, he gets the mitzvah of tzedaka since it came about from his money.</p>\n<p>Although in this case it was his money, while in your case he left it for others and never took ownership for himself and then give it away, logic should say that it’s the same idea. If a chesed is derived as an outcome of something you did, even though you didn’t control it directly, it is still considered a Mitzvah on your part.</p>\n<p>This doesn’t mean people should go about losing money in the hope that a poor person might find it. So too, a person doesn’t have to pass up on something that he’s entitled to in the hope that a needier person might get it. However if they do, and a needy person gets it, they’ll get credit. So each person can decide if it’s worth the chance.</p>\n<p>By the way, what chesed is done by passing up on tax breaks? That Uncle Sam should have extra money??</p>\n\n\n",

Although he lost the case, he has benefited from justice being served. Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: A verse is written with regard to Yitro’s advice for judiciary reforms that conveys the message of this aphorism: “And all these people shall also go to their place in peace” (Exodus 18:23). If justice is served, all the litigants, not only those who emerge victorious, can leave in peace.

I would love to hear comments and suggestions - web design is not my core skill at all.<br />\nA few points about using it:<br />\na) You can set the molad for This ר\"ה by hand, either by entering the values at the bottom or pulling the green pointer. The other molads for last year, next year, the year after that, all follow.<br />\nb) You can click on one of the year types, like מפ\"פ, and the arrows will move to that column. The pointers on the left also adjust, so that the molads continue to be correctly linked to This ר\"ה though the length of the years just changed.<br />\nc) In combination, the molad of \"This ר\"ה\" and the year type column give you the green and red arrows that point to the correct calendar for the year, which is marked on the right.<br />\nd) If you click on one of the molad triplets in the Molad Tishrei column, it will set the molad in This ר\"ה to that value (and maybe move the year type if needed). A tooltip also appears over each of the triplets, explaining why that molad changes the calendar and where you should look to see it (I've now added a little animation to make the right place to look easier to find). Also, the tooltip text appears below the charts in the Stories section. It always corresponds to a pointer reaching exactly ?d 18h 0ch on <i>one</i> of the calendars, because that's when calendars change.<br />\nUpdated: For this option it also shows you colored vertical bars to the left of the rulers, which show when Rosh Hashana was <em>going</em> to be, and where it ended up.<br />\ne) You can now also enter in the <em>year</em> on the top right, and it will pick the correct column and set the correct molad for you, picking that year's calendar instantly.<br />\nUpdate: I made a brief PowerPoint on how to use this, here <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nneOHFxS-16TQ-d_xXt9hXLoD--qTQNz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108360675515039678488&rtpof=true&sd=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nneOHFxS-16TQ-d_xXt9hXLoD--qTQNz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108360675515039678488&rtpof=true&sd=true</a> I'd suggest downloading it rather than opening it in your browser, unless you have a pretty smart browser.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A four gates table can be found in the appendix in the back of encyclopedia talmudit erech \"luach\".

But there is one, and you must discover it.  Rav Nachman of Breslov used to say: \"The day that you were born is the day God decided the world could not continue without you.\"  Chances are it's not as simple as in your example and you may not know it even at time of death, but it was there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Everything that exists has a purpose. Every person could play a critical role in Hashem's Plan.</p>\n<p>R Shimon Shkop writes in the introduction to Shaarei Yosher (tr. mine from Widen Your Tent, Mosaica Press, 2019):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If his feelings are broader and include [all of] Creation, that he is a great person and also like a small limb in this great body, then he is lofty and of great worth. In a great machine, even the smallest screw is important if it even serves the smallest role in the machine. For the whole is made of parts, and no more than the sum of its parts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of a small screw holding together the casing of an engine. If that screw is too loose, the casing will leak oil, the engine will overheat, and melt itself into a useless lump of metal. A little looser, the engine can shake itself apart. That screw is just as critical to the engine as the parts that come up in driver's ed on engine repair, like the pistons or the spark plugs. The machine is useless without either.</p>\n<p>The problem most of us have is a lack of <em>anavah</em> and <em>tzeni'us</em>, a healthy level of self-esteem and not needing to grab the spotlight. We all want to be flashy spark plugs, and are unhappy if all we will accomplish in life is quietly holding the engine casing together.</p>\n<p>If Hashem created a human being for the sake of holding open the door for an older woman, rest assured that is a critical part of the Ddivine Plan. Otherwise, He could have addressed the woman's need without making a person, a whole Tzelem Elokim (\"image\" of the Divine) to do this job. The engine of history couldn't run without it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Zohar states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דודאי לא ברא קודשא בריך הוא מלתא דלאו איהו צריך</p>\n<p>It's certain that The Holy One blessed be He didn't make anything He\ndidn't need.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone is needed; <em><strong>everything has an infinitely significant purpose</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>Note the subtle point here. If a person was created <em>for their own need</em>, that's circular<sup>1</sup>, arbitrary<sup>2</sup>, and pathetic; it means their life is ultimately meaningless, and they are needy - a bit like a pet, ch'v. This is the root of much if not <em>all</em> neuroticism. See <a href=\"https://www.sie.org/templates/sie/article_cdo/aid/2631293\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chassidic Discourses Vol 1:18.</a> for an in depth discussion of why a human is an intrinsically purposeful creature.</p>\n<p>This purpose breathes life and vitality into everything else, otherwise it would all just be הבל הבלים, vanity. The pursuit of happiness, pleasure, satisfaction, self determination and mastery of one's life will fall hollow and empty in the end, without it.</p>\n<p><strong>It is infinitely better, morally and mentally, to be needed, vs being needy.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note that we all have a general purpose (fulfilment of the Mitzvot), as well as more specific ones as well, such as our <em>tikun</em>, our <em>yiud</em> etc. Statements of \"you were created to open that one door for that one lady\" do not imply you are <strong>not</strong> <em>intrinsically necessary</em> in and of yourself. As Rambam says in Moreh Nevuchim 3:13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שלא באר כלל בדבר מהם שיהיה בעבור דבר אחר, אלא כל חלק וחלק מחלקי העולם\n– זכר שהוא המציאו ושמציאותו היה נאות לכונה</p>\n<p>For no part of the creation is described as being in existence for the\nsake of another part, but each part is declared to be the product of\nGod’s will, and to satisfy by its existence the intention [of the\nCreator]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See ספר השיחות - ה׳תנש״א on כי תבוא for an exquisite explanation of how Hashem desires us, ourselves, rather than as a means to an end.</p>\n<p>So, statements like the one you've brought about the old lady need to be given their proper context, as they can't mean that you are otherwise unnecessary - you are. So what they really mean is that, <em>even if you waste your whole life, except that one small act of kindness, it still was worth it for you to be born</em> because it was significant, and only you could have done it. Worth it for you, for her, for all of Klal Yisrael, and above all: for Him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - Pirkei Avot 4:22: \"you didn't choose to be made\"<br />\n2 - See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/135010/who-is-amalek-in-2023/135459#135459\">this answer</a> for discussion on the evil of arbitrariness</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we have many teachings from Hillel and Shammai, but very few of earlier zugot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We venerate our previous generations, and have a principle of <em>yeridat hadorot</em>. Therefore <em>I would imagine</em> that the Torah of Samaya and Avtalyon, for example, would be pure gold for us, and threaded throughout Mishna and Shas to an even larger degree than the Torah of Hillel and Shammai. Yet it is not, we have only a handful of halachot in their name, and they hardly appear anywhere in any Talmudic-era works such as Midrash, Sifrei, Braitot and Tosefta.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the exact historical or legal reasons</strong> that this is actually not the case? For some, we haven't got a single halachic record or teaching, e.g. Mattai/Nittai of Arbela.</p>\n<p>Contrast this to the point that we have, for example, a <a href=\"http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">huge amount of work from Philo</a>, who was alive at the time of Shamaya and Avtalyon, which demonstrates that the leading Rabbis of the time were writing extensively, and that it's certainly possible to have preserved such writings from that time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Per @RabbiKaii's request:</p>\n<p>The reason that the teachings of the Zugot have been lost seems largely based on the reality of classic tannaitic and amoraic texts not including much of any of their teachings. Thus, while these works became more and more popular, other teachings were largely lost with time. Why these texts hardly included these teachings is a matter still heavily debated among academic scholars, though unless we uncover some lost works with clearer explanations (and I wouldn't lose hope for the possibility, every now and then we discover valuable lost works), or else wait for techiyat ha'metim, it seems like we'll never truly know for sure.</p>\n<p>However, we do have a hint that a mishnaic compilation authored by personnel connected to the Chashmonaim or at least living in their time was still known circa the 4th-5th centuries. The Church Father Epiphanius, who was born a Jew in a small village near Beit Guvrin (Eleutheropolis), wrote in his book <a href=\"https://www.google.co.il/books/edition/The_Panarion_of_Epiphanius_of_Salamis/IKyxt9kyys8C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=aqiba&pg=PA42&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Panarion, I, 15</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Scribes had four \"repetitions.\" One  in the name of the prophet Moses, a second in that of their teacher called Aqiba or Bar Aqiba, another in the name of Addan or Annan, also called Judas, and another in the name of the sons of Hasmonaeus. Whatever customs they derive from these four traditions under the impression that they are wisdom - they are unwisdom mostly - are boasted of and praised, and celebrated and acclaimed as the teaching to be given first place.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Prof. Y. N. Epstein in his book Introductions to the Tannaitic Literature, p. 17, the \"recitations\" are mishnaic compilations (the word mishna comes from שנה, recite) and Epiphanius is speaking about four mishnaic compilations revered by the Jews: The first is Sefer Devarim, or Mishneh Torah, authored by Moshe. The second is by Rabbi Akiva, the third is by Rebbi (Rabbi Yehudah Ha'Nasi, the other two names are mistaken versions of the variants יודה and יודן) and the last one is from \"the sons of the Chasmonaim\".</p>\n<p>Prof. Epstein mentions two relevant sources that may be related to the Mishnaic compilation from the time of the Chashmonaim:</p>\n<p>Two mentions of a halachic ruling of a \"beit din of Chashmonai\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.36b.11?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&lang=bi&p2=Sanhedrin.82a.7&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 36b and Sanhedrin 82a</a>), and a tradition brought in some versions of Halachot Gedolot which states that the elders of Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai wrote something called \"the Scroll of the House of the Chashmonaim\" (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21295&st=&pgnum=793\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>, and see n. 9).</p>\n<p>From all of these sources, it seems that traditions of teachings and rulings from at least some of the Zugot or their contemporaries disappeared at least a couple of centuries after the creation of Rebbi's Mishna.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>As a side-note, I will add that a Kabbalistic work that was preserved in at least two places, one at the <a href=\"https://manuscripts.sefaria.org/munich-manuscript/munich-manuscript-95Cod.hebr.95pg.0314.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end of Brachot</a> in the Munich 95 MS of the Bavli and another in a Kabbalistic compilation manuscript that had been owned for a time by my great-great-grandfather R' David Frankel and his partner and relative R' Lipa Schwager as part of a collection of rare books and manuscripts they sold in their bookshop in Husiatyn, Austria,<sup>2</sup>, mentions that part or all of this particular text had been transmitted thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"זה השם} מיכאל/מיכאל המלאך מסרו ליהודה ויהודה לבני חשמונאי}\" ({This Name} Michael/Michael the Angel transmitted it to Yehudah and Yehudah to the Sons of Chashmonai).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <strong>Edit:</strong> Something interesting I came across is what appears to be (I don't speak French) a long (translated) passage from the Mamluk-period Egyptian historian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Maqrizi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Al-Maqrizi</a> describing the origins of the Mishna (French <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/chrestomathiear01sacygoog/page/292/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, pp. 293-296). According to him, Moshe wrote down the very first Mishna, which was an explanation of the Written Torah (not Devarim/Mishneh Torah!). This was copied again and again through the ages by his successors, until there were hundreds of copies. Notably (according to Maqrizi), every king of Yehudah commanded a copy of Moshe's Mishna be made for him. All of these copies were taken into the Babylonian exile and returned to Yerushalayim during Shivat Tzion. But they were lost during the destruction of the Second Temple. A new Mishna was authored by Hillel and Shammai in Teveryah after the destruction and completed by Rebbi.</p>\n<p>Of course, Maqrizi's chronology following the destruction of the Second Temple is incorrect, but it's possible that he preserved here a remnant of another tradition regarding older mishnaic compilations, as well as a memory of how the other mishnaic compilations were lost: During the destruction of the Second Temple. While it doesn't explain why the sages who assisted in authoring our Mishna did not include more older sources preserved in memory, it is a plausible suggestion (hinted at by several other sources and even argued in some recent academic studies) that many texts were lost during the destruction of Yerushalayim.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> This compilation, including quoting the relevant passage, is mentioned in one of Frankel & Schwager's catalogues. On Otzar Hachochmah it's called \"רשימת ספרים ישנים גם חדשים - 40 - 7\", p. 21:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/B23bZWzu.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/B23bZWzu.png\" alt=\"Passage from book catalogue\" /></a></p>\n<p>I haven't not yet managed to discover whether this manuscript was preserved in some library or collection.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Because in those days there was very little to no machlokes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בראשונה לא היתה מחלוקת בישראל, אלא על הסמיכה בלבד</p>\n<p>In the beginning there was no disagreement in Israel, except regarding\nsmicha (Yerushalmi Chagigah 2:2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So no halachos had to be recorded in the names of individual sages.</p>\n\n\n",

He (the kid but it was Hashem speaking through him) also reprimanded them for something and that's why it was only a few people instead of the whole nation meriting to be there. Also afterwards the kid got annoyed and started to leave, but someone (presumably Hashem?) said in Hebrew, it doesn't matter because he'll return eventually (\"shuvu\" something, I can't remember the rest).

Shouldn't that be enough reason to observe the mitzvos?</p>\n<p>Why does Rashi says that we need to \"lay up these words in our hearts\", in order that, when we arrive in Eretz Yisroel when Moshiach comes, we know what to do, we know how to put on tefillin etc...</p>\n<p>The question is whether Rashi's reasons for observing these mitzvos invalidate doing them for the obvious reasons mentioned above.</p>\n<p>On a side note, the Piaseczno Rebbe in <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/637563/p/51/t/0.82505802009428941234/fs/7oVeDCX8w2HLXM0t49drPmkv6jbRc2zJC9Rzw1O4er6i/start/78/end/130/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish Kodesh</a> writes that the reason why the Torah was not given in Eretz Yisrael was to give the message that the Torah can be observed everywhere, not only in Eretz Yisroel, hence it was given in the dessert.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לכן אילו קבלו ישראל את התורה בארצם בארץ ישראל היו חושבים שרק במקומם ובביתם אפשר להם לקיים אותה ולא כשהם בגולה ומטורדים לכן נתן ד' להם התורה במדבר בדרך וטלטול שידעו שבכל מקום צריכים לקיימה כנאמר לעיל שלא יהא לבך חלוק על המקום</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This all made me wondering if this Rashi does not contradict the fact that we keep mitzvos is because Hashem said that we need to observe them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Devarim.11.18.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gur aryeh</a> asks and answers your questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף לאחר שתגלו. דאם לא כן, מאי ענין \"ושמתם\" אל \"ואבדתם מהרה\" (פסוק יז), אלא 'אף אחר שתגלו וכו''. והא דכתיב (פסוק כא) \"למען ירבו ימיכם על האדמה\", יש לומר כמו שפירש הרמב\"ן, שתהיו שבים אל הארץ, ותאריכו ימים שם. ולי נראה דהאי קרא \"ושמתם את דברי\" בכל זמן איירי, לעולם אתם חייבים במצות האלו, אלא שלכך סמך אל \"ואבדתם\" לומר שאף אחר שתגלו תהיו חייבים במצות, וכן פירש הרא\"ם:\nאבל מה שכתב (רש\"י) 'כדי שלא יהא דומים אליכם כחדשים', קשה, דהרי בלא טעם זה חייבים, דהא כל מצוה שהיא חובת הגוף חייבים בין בארץ בין בחוצה לארץ (קידושין לו ע\"ב). ויש מפרשים, כי כאשר גלו בין האומות, ואין לישראל מקומות ובתים בפני עצמם, רק על דרך שאלה ושכירות, ואם כן לא יקיימו ישראל מצות מזוזה בגלות, שאין להם בתים מיוחדים. וכן תפילין, מפני שצריך שלא יסיח דעתו מן התפילין (מנחות לו ע\"ב), דבימיהם דאגת וטרדת הגלות יותר, וגורם היה היסח הדעת. ובגלות גדול כמו שהיה להם, ראוי שיהיה פטורים מתפילין, כי איך לא יהיה להם היסח הדעת. ואם כן יהיו המצות עליהם חדשים כשיחזרו (לברך) [לארץ]. לכך אמר שאף בחוצה לארץ יקנו להם בתים, כדי שיעשו מזוזה. וגם בגלות יסירו הטרדות ויתחייבו בתפילין, כדי שלא יהיו נראים חדשים מזוזה ותפילין עליהם:\nBut what (Rashi) wrote, 'so that they will not be to you as new', is difficult, since without this reason it is obligatory, for isn't it that every mitzvah which is the duty of the body obligatory both in the land and outside of the land i.e. israel (Kiddoshin 36b). There are those who answer, because when they were exiled among the nations, and Israel does not have places and houses of their own, only by way of borrowing and renting, and if so Israel will not observe the mitzvah of mezuzah in exile, since they do not have their own houses. As well as tefillin, because it is necessary that one's mind not be distracted from the tefillin (menachot 36b), because in that time the exile was more burdensome, and was the cause of distraction. And in an exile as great as they had, it is appropriate that they be exempted from tefillin, because how would they not be distracted. And if so, the mizvot will be new to them when they return to Israel. Therefore he said that even when in exile they will buy houses for them, so that they can make mezuzah. And in exile they will remove harassment and commit themselves to tefillin, so that they will not be seen as new with mezuzah and tefillin on them:\nוהרמב\"ן נתעורר בזה ואמר שיש לזה סוד עמוק81. ואני אגלה הסוד. כתב הרמב\"ן בפרשת תולדות (בראשית כו, ה) כי התורה היא \"משפט אלקי הארץ\" (מ\"ב יז, כו), ולפיכך היו האבות שומרים את התורה דוקא בארץ, לא בחוצה לארץ, לפי שלא נצטוו בה. אבל ישראל, כל מצוה שהיא חובת הגוף חייב לעשות, ולא היה ראוי שישראל ישמרו המצות בחוצה לארץ, כיון שהם \"משפט אלקי הארץ\", אבל אם לא נתן השם יתברך שישמרו המצות בחוצה לארץ ושיקיימו אותם כמו בארץ, היה בבואם לארץ אחר כך נתינה חדשה, כיון שכבר נתבטלו המצות חס ושלום. ואין כאן נתינה חדשה, ולכך אמר שלכך יקיימו המצות בחוצה לארץ גם כן, שאם לא כן היה צריך שיהיו המצות בבואם לארץ חדשים, ואין כאן דבר חדש כלל, שפעם אחת נתנה התורה מן השם יתברך, ולא שתי פעמים. ולפיכך כל מצות שהם חובת הגוף חייבין בחוצה לארץ. ומה שאמר 'כדי שלא יהיו חדשים עליכם', הוא בעצמו טעם הכתוב שחייב כל מצות שהם חובת הגוף, וחייבים עליהם בחוצה לארץ כמו בארץ, שהרי אין כאן מצות חדשות, וחיוב הראשון לא נתבטל, כדי שלא יהיו חדשים כשיחזרו לארץ. ונכון הוא מאד:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(I'm working on the English translation)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ramban_on_Leviticus.18.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban to Vayikra 18:25</a> addresses the <em>midrash</em> upon which this Rashi is based. The key line is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ופירשו בהן כדי שלא יהו חדשים עלינו כשנחזור לארץ <strong>כי עיקר כל המצות ליושבים בארץ ה</strong>'‏</p>\n<p>[T]he Rabbis [in the above text of the Sifre] explained [that we must observe them] so that they shall not be novelties to us when we return to the Land, <strong>for the main [fulfillment] of the commandments is [to be kept] when dwelling in the Land of G-d</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to Ramban, the <em>midrash</em> is explaining to us why Hashem commanded us to follow <em>mitzvot</em> in <em>chutz laaretz</em>. The reason for doing so is to make sure that eventually we will be able to observe them in <em>eretz yisrael</em>, because that is where and how they are meant to be fulfilled.</p>\n\n\n",

(The \"Yuchasin\" brings the matter regarding Rabbi Judah the Pious's father, see further Tzemach David Part 1 1:448) They are all completely righteous ones, and wise, and great Torah scholars. And they said about Rabbi Zeria and Rav Papa that they never once spoke of worldly matters; and never slept in the Hall of Study, neither fully sleeping nor napping; and nobody ever showed up to the Hall of Study earlier than they did; and nobody ever found them sitting quietly instead of sitting and reciting Torah; and they never missed Kiddush; and they never gave their friends nasty nicknames; and never took honor from their friends' shame; and never even cursed their friends from their beds; and never looked at the image of an evil person; and didn't accept gifts; and these two both fulfill what is said: (Proverbs 8:22)  \"I endow those who love me with substance; I will fill their treasuries.\"  (The Talmud lists these qualities about other Sages, see further in Megillah 27b-28a.) And how did their mothers give birth without husbands? They said: Once they went to the bathhouse, and some seed from an Israelite entered their bellies, and they conceived and gave birth from this, without knowing who their fathers were. But Ben Sira's father was known to him! How did his mother give birth without a husband's intercourse? They said about her that she was the daughter of Yirmiyahu. Once, Yirmiyahu went to the bathhouse, and found there evildoers from the tribe of Ephraim, and he saw that they were all wasting their seed, because the whole tribe of Ephraim in that generation were evildoers, as it is written about them that they did what was wrong in God's eyes. And when he saw them, he began to rebuke them. Immediately, they rose up against him, and said, \"Why are you rebuking us? We swear by the road to Bethlehem that you will not leave here until you do what we are doing.\" He said to them, \"Leave me alone and I will swear to you that I will never reveal this situation.\" They said to him, \"Didn't Tzidkiyahu see Nevuchadnetzar eating a live rabbit, and swear to him in God's name that he would not reveal his secret, and then nullify that oath? (Nedarim 65b, Eicha Rabbah s.v.: \"they sit on the ground\") You will do the same thing! But now, if you do what we are doing, good, and not, we will do the Sodomite act to you, like our ancestors did for idolatrous purposes. If they did it for idolatry, how much more so should we do it to you!\" Immediately, he did it, out of great terror and fear of them. When he began leaving there, he started to curse his birthday, saying (Jeremiah 20:14)  \"Accursed be the day That I was born!\"  He left there, and fasted for this incident 248 fasts, parallel to all the organs of a man. And the drop that came from that righteous man was guarded until that righteous man's own daughter came to the bathhouse, and it entered her belly. At seven months, she gave birth to a son who had teeth and could speak, and once she gave birth, she developed shame around people, because they would say that she gave birth through promiscuity. The child opened his mouth and said to his mother, \"Why are you ashamed around people? I am the son of Sira.\" She said, \"Who is Sira?\" He said, \"Yirmiyahu, and the reason he is called Sira is because he is the officer (sar) over all officers, and because he will ultimately name all officers and kings, and when you calculate 'Sira' and 'Yirmiyahu' in numerical values, they are equal.\" She said to him, \"My son, if this is true, you should have said, 'I am the son of Yirmiyahu.'\" He said to her, \"I would have wanted to say that, but it is a shameful thing, saying that Yirmiyahu has had sex with his daughter.\" She said to him, \"My son, is it not written (Ecclesiastes 1:9)  \"Only that shall happen Which has happened,\"  and who has ever seen a daughter have a child by her father?\" He said to her, \"My mother, (Ecclesiastes 1:9)  'There is nothing new Beneath the sun!'  Just as Lot was a completely righteous man, my father is also a completely righteous man. Just like Lot did it under compulsion, my father also had this done under compulsion.\" She said to him, \"I am stunned by you. How do you know these things?\" He said to her, \"Do not be stunned by me, because there is nothing new beneath the sun. The same thing occurred with my father Yirmiyahu when his mother was kneeling to give birth- he opened his mouth, and my father called from his mother's innards, and said, 'I will not leave until you tell me my name.' His father opened his mouth and said, 'Come out, and your name will be Avraham' and he said, 'That is not my name.' He said, 'Come out, and your name will be Yitzchak...' and then Yaakov and all the tribes, and all the men of that generation, and he kept saying, 'That is not my name.' Until Eliyahu of Blessed Memory arrived there, and said, 'Your name will be Yirmiyah, because in your days the Holy Blessed One will establish an enemy to raise (yarim) his hand against Jerusalem.' He said, 'That is my name. And you, who told me my name, let your name be my name- let me have \"yahu\" from your name, and call me Yirmi-yahu.' Just as he was emerged speaking, I also emerged speaking; just as he emerged with prophecy from his mother's innards, as it is said, (Jeremiah 1:5)  'Before I created you in the womb, I selected you' ; just as he wrote an alphabetical acrostic book (Eicha), I also will write an alphabetical acrostic book, so not do not but stunned by my speech.\" She said, \"My son, do not say it, so the Evil Eye will not reign over you!\" He said to her, \"The Evil Eye has no permission to reign over me, so now do not keep talking to me, for I am going to do what my father did. It is about me that it is said, (Ketubot 63a) 'One ewe follows another,' and a son follows his father's deeds.\" She said to him, \"My son, why are you stopping me from talking?\" He said, \"Because you know that I am hungry, and you do not let me eat anything.\" She said to him, \"Here are breasts for you- eat your food and drink your drink.\" He said to her, \"I have no interest in your breasts. Rather, go and sift through flour like a hen, knead fine bread and fatty meat, and old wine, and you must eat together with me.\" She said to him, \"But how could I buy things like this?\" He said to her, \"Make clothes and sell them, and the verse will be upheld for you: (Proverbs 31:24)  'She makes cloth and sells it.'  and if you support me, the verse (Proverbs 31:29), 'Many women have done well, But you surpass them all' will be true.\" She began to make clothes and sell them, and she would bring him bread and fatty meat, and old wine, and she supported him for one year. And after that year, he said to her, \"Bring me to the synagogue,\" so she brought him to the house of one educator who had seven daughters. He sat beside him, and said to him, \"Rabbi, teach me Torah!\" He said to him, \"You are not yet eligible to study, because you are so small, and our Sages z\"l said (Pirkei Avot 5:21): 'A child of five should study Written Torah.'\" Ben Sira said to him, \"And have you not learned that (Pirkei Avot 2:15) 'the day is short, and the work is plentiful'? And you are telling me 'Sit and do not learn yet because you are so small,' while I see in the cemetery those smaller than me who have died, and who knows what will be, whether I will live or I will die?\" The educator said to him, \"What, are you my teacher? Haven't our Sages z\"l said: \"Anyone who teaches halacha in front of their Rabbi is liable for the death penalty'?\" He said to him, \"So far, you are not my Rabbi and so far, I have learned nothing from you.\" The educator said to Ben Sira, \"Say, 'Aleph.'\" He responded to him, saying:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Would it make a difference if it were open vs. concealed carry?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>1]</strong> There are several passages in Nakh that indicate that weapons were indeed present in the Miqdash.</p>\n<p>2 Kings 11:10</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויתן הכהן לשרי המאיות [המאות] את החנית ואת השלטים אשר למלך דוד אשר\nבבית ה</p>\n<p>And the priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spear and\nshields that had been king David's, which were in the house of the\nLORD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and 2 Chronicles 23:9</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויתן יהוידע הכהן לשרי המאות את החניתים ואת המגנות ואת השלטים אשר למלך\nדויד אשר בית האלהים</p>\n<p>And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the\nspears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which\nwere in the house of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>both openly indicate that King David stored hundreds of spears and shields in the Beth ha-Miqdash. There are no sources to my knowledge that condemn this. This would indicate similarly that the presence of a weapon on Har ha-Bayith (the Temple Mount) is either not an offense against Mora Miqdash (the commanded reverence for the Temple), or that the security needs of the site supersede it.</p>\n<p><strong>2]</strong> R. Yehudah Leon Templo in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46823&st=&pgnum=41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tabhnith Hekhal</a> lists various chambers of the Temple complex whose precise location is unknown. One of the chambers was the לשכת המגינים (defenses chamber). He describes it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לשכה נודעת היתה שם בתוך הלשכות הנזכרות אשר שמה נתן דוד המלך במשמר את\nכלי המלחמה הרבה מאוד להגין על המקדש לעת הצורך מפני אויב ומתנקם ועל כן\nהלשכה הזאת היתה נקראת לשכת המגינים</p>\n<p>There is a chamber that is known of among the aforementioned chambers\nthat King David designated to guard a great magnitude of weapons to\nprotect the Temple in a time of need against its enemies and its\nvengeful, accordingly it was called <em>lishkath hamaginim</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3]</strong> Josephus (though non-canonical and not a source of halakhah) corroborates this (Antiquities of the Jews, Book 9, ch. 7):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jehoiada also opened that armory which David had made in the temple, and distributed to the captains of hundreds, as also to the Priests,\nand Levites, all the spears and quivers, and what kind of weapons\nsoever it contained; and set them armed in a circle round about the\ntemple, so as to touch one another's hands: and by that means\nexcluding those from entering that ought not to enter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here Josephus attests that King David had established an armory (presumably the same לשכת המגינים that R. Templo refers to above) within the Temple and that it stored all kinds of weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>4]</strong> I believe that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/136814/2394\">Shababnik's inference</a> is incorrect.</p>\n<p>The miswa of mora miqdash (reverence for the Temple) establishes a code of conduct that regulates behavior and dress on the Temple Mount. Indeed, items such as a staff (which is functionally a weapon) is generally prohibited to be carried thereon. However it cannot be extrapolated therefrom that weapons per se would have been considered an offense under mora miqdash. We know that there were exceptions.</p>\n<p>There is a miswah d'oraitha to guard the Miqdash (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%95_%D7%A1%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer ha-Miswoth, Negative Commandment 67</a>). This task of shemirath hamiqdash (guarding the Temple) was performed by Kohanim/Lewiim who were stationed at 24 different stations throughout the complex. If during the night-watch, a guard was caught sleeping by the chief officer, then the guard would be struck with his <strong>staff</strong> (חובטו במקלו). See <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/i/8108.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">H. Beth ha-Behira 8:10</a>.</p>\n<p>This indicates that an exception to the general rule against carrying a staff on the Temple Mount was in place, in order to facilitate the miswah of guarding the Temple. We see from this that the needs of shemirath ha-miqdash supercede those of mora miqdash.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This all seems to indicate, that indeed <strong>weapons were permitted in the Miqdash</strong>.</p>\n<p>As for who was permitted to  carry said weapons, there may have been a practical distinction to be made between the average pilgrim on the one hand and the Lewiim/Kohanim/officers/soldiers on the other. I have not however seen any source explicitly make this distinction (but I'll keep digging).</p>\n<p>As for what regulations will be in place in the future Temple (guns, concealed carry, etc.) that would be purely speculative. One presumes however that our leaders will attempt to balance tradition with contemporary security and social conditions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.62b.23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brachot 62b</a> relates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דְּתַנְיָא לֹא יִכָּנֵס אָדָם לְהַר הַבַּיִת לֹא בְּמַקְלוֹ שֶׁבְּיָדוֹ, וְלֹא בְּמִנְעָלוֹ שֶׁבְּרַגְלוֹ, וְלֹא בְּמָעוֹת הַצְּרוּרִים לוֹ בִּסְדִינוֹ, וּבְפוּנְדָּתוֹ מוּפְשֶׁלֶת לַאֲחוֹרָיו, וְלֹא יַעֲשֶׂנָּה קַפֶּנְדַּרְיָא. וּרְקִיקָה מִקַּל וָחוֹמֶר מִמִּנְעָל: וּמָה מִנְעָל, שֶׁאֵין בּוֹ דֶּרֶךְ בִּזָּיוֹן, אָמְרָה תּוֹרָה: ״שַׁל נְעָלֶיךָ מֵעַל רַגְלֶיךָ״. רְקִיקָה, שֶׁהִיא דֶּרֶךְ בִּזָּיוֹן — לֹא כׇּל שֶׁכֵּן?!\nAs it was taught in a baraita: One may neither enter the Temple Mount with his staff in his hand, nor with his shoes on his feet, nor with money tied in his cloth and with his money-belt slung behind him, nor should one make it a shortcut. All the more so, spitting is prohibited a fortiori from the halakha with regard to wearing a shoe. Just as with regard to a shoe, which is generally not considered contemptuous, the Torah said: “Put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place upon which you stand is holy ground” (Exodus 3:5), all the more so spitting, which is considered contemptuous, should be prohibited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One might infer from this gemara that guns which are not the nicest objects shouldn't be allowed in to the makom hamikdash.\nNot sure what the idf does nowadays.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, she can immerse and purify herself on the night of the eleventh, and engage in intercourse with her husband on the eleventh and twelfth days. These are the only two days on which she is permitted to engage in intercourse with her husband, as afterward she will experience bleeding for three days during the days of the flow of the zava, and is thereby rendered a greater zava.

The peculiar constitution of the organs, indispensable for the conservation of their particular forms and for the performance of their primary functions, produces, whilst it serves its special purpose, according to the nature of the substance, other things, such as the hair and the complexion of the body. Being mere accessories, they are not formed according to a fixed rule: some are altogether absent in many individuals; and vary considerably in others. This is not the case with the organs of the body. You never find that the liver of one person is ten times larger than that of another person, but you may find a person without a beard, or without hair on certain parts of his body, or with a beard ten times longer than that of another man. Instances of this phenomenon, viz., great variation as regards hair and colour, are not rare. The same differences occur in the constitution of the Universe. Some species exist as an integral part of the whole system: these are constant and follow a fixed law; though they vary as far as their nature permits, this variation is insignificant in quantity and quality. Other species do not serve any purpose: they are the mere result of the general nature of transient things, as, e.g., the various insects which are generated in dunghills, the animals generated in rotten fruit, or in fetid liquids, and worms generated in the intestines, etc. In short, everything devoid of the power of generation belongs to this class. You will, therefore, find that these things do not follow a fixed law, although their entire absence is just as impossible as the absence of different complexions and of different kinds of hair amongst human beings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in other places, Rambam seems to presuppose PSR in one of his proofs for the existence of G-d, blessed be He, which has been <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/philosophy/issues-jewish-thought/issues-mussar-and-faith/belief-god-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">summarized by Rabbi Assaf Bednarsh</a> goes like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam presents a slightly different version of the cosmological argument, which is valid even if one were to postulate the eternity of the universe. He argues that all movement must be caused by some force, and therefore, since there is movement in the universe, there must be some prime mover who moves the highest sphere, which then moves the lower spheres, and ultimately the physical objects in our world. That prime mover is God. [Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Yesodei Ha-Torah 1:5; Moreh Nevukhim 2:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it's not quite clear to me whether Rambam affirms (in some form) or rejects PSR? Does he ever state anything like that explicitly or perhaps I'm just misunderstanding the <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp082.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevukhim 1:72</a>?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did people in biblical times live for so long?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Tanakh records many instances in which people lived exceptionally long lifespans, some even nearing 1,000 years old.</p>\n<p>There tends to be a trend in the recorded ages, in that the earlier generations recorded in the first chapters of the Book of Genesis lived for a long time, and as the generations went on, lifespans became shorter. For example: Adam lived to be 930, Abraham 175, Moses 120, and King David 70.</p>\n<p>While throughout history the average lifespan has fluctuated back and forth depending on the era, humans tend to live no more than around 70 years, on average. (Longer lifespans are of course, possible, but they are outliers in the data.) What about the early generations enabled them to live for so long? What do traditional Jewish sources have to say concerning the long lifespans recorded in the Tanakh?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>A little kabbalistic/deep, but refer to the Or HaChaim on Bereishis 47:29:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Originally, G'd assigned great tasks to the antediluvian generations and at the same time equipped them with commensurately greater souls, each one of which consisted of many \"sparks.\" He assigned a single day to each \"spark.\" This is alluded to in Exodus 16,4 when the Torah speaks about people collecting the manna on a daily basis, i.e. דבר יום ביומו. The word יום may be understood as ענף, a branch or sprout of each soul. G'd granted each human being a certain number of days, i.e. He allocated to them approximately 300.000 such gemstones as mentioned in the parable. After the failure which resulted in the deluge, all of this was restructured in order to help us achieve what is expected of us in a lifespan averaging seventy years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The basic idea of this is that prior to the sin of man, the soul consisted of a lot of sparks. There was a lot of \"work\" to do in this world, and hence, as the Or HaChaim says, the lifespan was much bigger than after the flood.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Dovid Rosenfeld wrote <a href=\"https://aish.com/long-lifespans-and-late-childbearing-in-genesis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an article</a> on this topic and explains that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] when man became sinful, G-d began shortening his lifespan – in a gradual process which was not completed until the time of the Exodus. G-d did this so that man would be more strongly aware of his mortality. He would be forced to live his years knowing his soul would soon be returned to his Creator for judgment, and he would have to live with that awareness throughout his life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.3?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This Chizkuni</a> is also interesting, although it does not answer your question, it does deal with the subject of lifespan being shortened after the flood.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Maimonides suggests that even in biblical days long life spans were unusual and may well have been isolated \"miracles\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>About the length of man's life in those days [before the Flood], I say that only the persons named lived so long, while other people enjoyed the ordinary length of life. The men named were exceptions, either in consequence of different causes, such as their food or mode of living; or by way of miracles, which admits of no analogy.

The specific purpose is described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.6.18-20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melakhim A 6:18-20</a>. Ezra also used cedar trees in building the second Temple, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.3.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 3:7</a>.</p>\n<p>To understand why, let's recall that in the 3rd blessing of Bil'am <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'midbar 24:6</a> Jewish people are compared to cedars rising over water. Bil'am seeks to compare Jews in the desert with the merit of Abraham who achieved a lofty spiritual status, as stated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.14.9?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi&with=Or%20HaChaim&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr haChaim on Vayikra 14:9</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The words ועץ ארז ושני חולעת ואזב, \"and the cedar-wood and the scarlet and the hyssop,\" are allusions to the merits of the three patriarchs. <strong>Abraham is represented by the word עץ ארז</strong>; He was a man of gigantic spiritual stature. Jacob is represented by the words ושני תולעת, seeing he is called by that \"nickname\" in Isaiah 41,14 i.e. אל תירא תולעז יעקב, \"do not be afraid O worm Jacob;\" Isaac is represented by the word אזוב, seeing Isaac symbolises the attribute of גבורה, strength, heroism. The Messiah will have to combine all those attributes within himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is the kind of the cedar meant for the Temple symbolizing an ideal to strive for. The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.20a.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 20a</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: לְעוֹלָם יְהֵא אָדָם רַךְ כְּקָנֶה וְאַל יְהֵא קָשֶׁה כְּאֶרֶז.</p>\n<p>The Sages further taught in praise of the reed: A person should always be soft like a reed, and he should not be stiff like a cedar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is not talking about greatenes of cedar but a different quality of the cedar wood - its inflexibility. For a person striving to achieve an ideal, inflexibility in the areas of growth is inappropriate. <em>A person achieving an ideal has to show inflexibility at keeping it.</em></p>\n<p>Also the same allusion to inflexibility of cedar can be implied when it forbids using cedar bast for a wick used for Shabbos candles Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 2:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בַּמֶּה מַדְלִיקִין וּבַמָּה אֵין מַדְלִיקִין. אֵין מַדְלִיקִין <strong>לֹא בְלֶכֶשׁ</strong>, וְלֹא בְחֹסֶן, וְלֹא בְכָלָךְ, וְלֹא בִפְתִילַת הָאִידָן, וְלֹא בִפְתִילַת הַמִּדְבָּר, וְלֹא בִירוֹקָה שֶׁעַל פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם.</p>\n<p>With what may one light the Shabbat lamp, and with what may one not light it?

If, however it is made of spelt, rye or oats, then it does not need to be covered, as it does not precede the blessing of Hagafen.<sup>8</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, I saw in Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchaso 47, he'arah 125, that Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach paskens that those who hold that we cover the mezonos products, is only relevant to the person making Kiddush (and others who are partaking of the wine). All other participants would not need to cover their mezonos, since they are not “shaming” the mezonos by listening to Kiddush.</p>\n<hr />\n<sup>\n<blockquote>\n<p><sup>1</sup> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41247&st=&pgnum=171&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peri Megadim 271 A”A 7</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.55.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur SHU”A 55:5</a>; Levushei Mordechaiy 1:46; Shvilei David 271; Orchos Rabbeinu See Piskeiy Teshuvos 271 footnote 184; 194</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> The reason: As the blessing of Mezonos foods precede that of Hagafen [See Admur in Seder Birchas Hanehnin 10:13-14], and hence its shame is to be covered just as by bread. [Levushei Mordechai ibid based on 3rd reason recorded in Admur and Poskim ibid] Likewise, as one of the reasons behind covering the bread is to show that the food was brought to the table for the sake of Shabbos [i.e. Yikra Deashabbasa]. Now, initially the custom was not to bring the food at all to the table prior to Kiddush due to this [see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh_HaRav%2C_Orach_Chayim.271.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Admur 271/17</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.271.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur 271</a>; Tosafus Pesachim 100b; Sheilasos Yisro 54; Rashbam Pesachim ibid], and now that we bring it to the table, at the very least one must cover it, and there is no difference between the Challah and the other foods. [P”M ibid] Practically, this later reason seems to be negated by Admur, as in his conclusion he writes “The custom is to bring it initially before Kiddush and cover the bread until after Kiddush”;</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> See wording in Kitzur SHU”A ibid; See Piskeiy Teshuvos 271:19</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> Birchas Habayis 46:50; Shut Rav Akiva Yosef Shlezinger 95; Taamei Haminhagim Kuntrus Achron 365; See Ashel Avraham 271</p>\n<p><sup>5</sup> The reason: As the concept of shame only really applies to bread which is the ehad of the emal, and not to Mezonos, even though technically its blessing precedes.

Now, if it was already established in the previous Halacha that even Mezonos of the 5 grains has precedence to wine, then certainly Hamotzi would have precedence to wine and thus what would be the novelty of this ruling.

But was there such a rule in the past? If yes, what is the source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Not quite. They would only write one get but the writing and signing was made a complicated affair. Since a Kohen is not allowed to marry a divorcee, he couldn't remarry his former wife once the get was given. As Kohanim were known to be \"hotheads\", the danger was that they would give their wife a get on impulse, and later regret it. [Non Kohanim could also be hot-heads :-), but they could remarry their ex-wives afterwards]. In order to enable the Kohen to cool down, the Sages instituted a very much drawn-out procedure of the writing of the get. This involved writing one line, folding over the paper and stitching it down, with witnesses signing on the fold, then writing the second line, fold it over etc etc. So, the only thing that was done many times, was the signing of the witnesses. Today this isn't done anymore, although the reason for that isn't exactly clear. It has been suggested that the Sages only instituted it for their days. See Tosafot Bave Batra 160b \"Tiknu\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.160b.10?lang=he&p2=Tosafot_on_Bava_Batra.160b.10.1&lang2=he&w2=About&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.160b.10?lang=he&p2=Tosafot_on_Bava_Batra.160b.10.1&lang2=he&w2=About&lang3=he</a>\nNeither the Rambam, nor the Shulchan Aruch bring the laws of the so-called Get Mekushar.

Rather he found an allusion to it in the writings of R. Ya'aqobh 'Emden.</p>\n<p>R. 'Emden (בירת מגדל עוז:בית מדות: עליית הלשון פ\"ב) wrote pretty much verbatim as quoted in the Yad Efraim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ואמרו</strong> שאם יגדל הילד ולא ישמע לשונות אחרים, אז יתחיל לדבר לשון הקודש מעצמו בלי למוד שהוא לשונו המוטבע בו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the only relevant contextual addition being the word being \"ואמרו\" - \"and they say/said\". Unfortunately this does not tell us who the anonymous \"they\" is. Which IMHO suggests that this was a bit of folk-wisdom in circulation, rather than something received by tradition.</p>\n<p>R. 'Emden later retracted his opinion on this altogether in his commentary on the Mishnah (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/22309\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">לחם שמים</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאינו לא שומע ולא מדבר שנולד חרש וכיון שלא שמע מעולם אי אפשר שידבר זה\nלא כמו שכתבתי שאם יושם הילד במקום שלא ישמע שם מדברים אז יפתח פיו לדבר\nבלשון הקודש מעצמו אלא צריך לומר שהדיבור קשור בחוש השמע</p>\n<p>That he is unable to hear and cannot speak: for he was born as a\n<em>heresh</em> and since he never heard anything in his life it is not possible for him to speak. And it is not as I have previously written\nthat if a child is left alone in a place where he doesn’t hear\nanything he will begin to speak the sacred language [Hebrew] by\nhimself, rather you must say that his speech will be bound [i.e.\nincapacitated].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His comment here is based on the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Terumot.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Terumoth 1:2</a> about which the Bertenura also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכיון שלא שמע מעולם מה שמדברים לו א\"א לו שידבר</p>\n<p>Since [the heresh] has never heard anything spoken to him, he is not\nable to speak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems likely that this notion, that a child left to their own devices will develop Hebrew, was a bit of popular-knowledge/folk-wisdom in circulation and not something from an authoritative source. Which would explain why R. 'Emden had no compunction about retracting and disagreeing with it. Indeed, he seems convinced that traditional rabbinic sentiment overtly contradicts such a notion.</p>\n<p>So to summarize, it seems like bit of a mystery about how this notion originated and how it came to be attributed to the Rambam. However one of the earliest to articulate this idea, R. 'Emden, did not himself attribute it to the Rambam but rather generically quoted the notion as \"they say\". Indeed he later retracted his opinion on the credibility of this idea, as he found it to be in contradiction to the Mishnah.</p>\n\n\n",

Jewish Publication Society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>כדשָֽׁבֻעִ֨ים שִׁבְעִ֜ים נֶחְתַּ֥ךְ עַל־עַמְּךָ֣ | וְעַל־עִ֣יר קָדְשֶׁ֗ךָ לְכַלֵּ֨א הַפֶּ֜שַׁע וּלְהָתֵ֚ם (כתיב וּלְחָתֵ֚ם) חַטָּאוֹת֙ וּלְכַפֵּ֣ר עָו‍ֹ֔ן וּלְהָבִ֖יא צֶ֣דֶק עֹֽלָמִ֑ים וְלַחְתֹּם֙ חָז֣וֹן וְנָבִ֔יא וְלִמְשֹׁ֖חַ קֹ֥דֶשׁ קָֽדָשִֽׁים:</p>\n<p>Rashi does not seem to address the part about prophecy and I'm not sure what he's saying about the exile of Titus. I thought that Daniel 9:24 was commonly read as referring to the building of the second Temple, not its destruction (?):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to terminate the transgression and to end sin: so that Israel should receive their complete retribution <strong>in the exile of Titus</strong> and his subjugation, in order that their transgressions should terminate, their sins should end, and their iniquities should be expiated, in order to bring upon them eternal righteousness and to anoint upon them (sic) the Holy of Holies: the Ark, the altars, and the holy vessels, which they will bring to them through the king Messiah. The number of seventy weeks is four hundred and ninety years. <strong>The Babylonian exile was seventy [years] and the Second Temple stood four hundred and twenty [years].</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that the interpretation of Daniel 9:24 hangs on the meaning of the words ולהביא צדק עלמים might mean in this context.</p>\n<p>Moving a few chapters ahead, we get another time statement and indicator:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Daniel 12 1“At that time, the great prince, Michael, who stands beside the sons of your people, will appear. <strong>It will be a time of trouble, the like of which has never been since the nation came into being. At that time, your people will be rescued, all who are found inscribed in the book. 2Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, others to reproaches, to everlasting abhorrence.</strong> 3And the knowledgeable will be radiant like the bright expanse of sky, and those who lead the many to righteousness will be like the stars forever and ever.\n4“But you, Daniel, keep the words secret, <strong>and seal the book until the time of the end. Many will range far and wide and knowledge will increase.”</strong>\n5Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others standing, one on one bank of the river, the other on the other bank of the river. 6One said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the water of the river, “How long until the end of these awful things?” <strong>7Then I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the water of the river, swear by the Ever-Living One as he lifted his right hand and his left hand to heaven: “For a time, times, and half a time; and when the breaking of the power of the holy people comes to an end, then shall all these things be fulfilled.”</strong>\n8I heard and did not understand, so I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?” 9He said, “Go, Daniel, for these words are secret and sealed to the time of the end. 10Many will be purified and purged and refined; the wicked will act wickedly and none of the wicked will understand; but the knowledgeable will understand. (11From the time the regular offering is abolished, and an appalling abomination is set up—it will be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Happy the one who waits and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.) 12But you, go on to the end; you shall rest, and arise to your destiny at the end of the days.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jewish Publication Society. (1985). Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures (Da 12). Jewish Publication Society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If this timetable applies to Daniel 9:24 (which I think it does), then doesn't that peg the end of the age of prophecy to the destruction of the Temple, the end of the sacrificial system, the Sanhedrin, the Sinai covenant, a great many Jews, and the end of Jerusalem as a theocracy c. 70 CE?</p>\n\n\n",

If the local population treats this person like a royal, then you should a.) show respect accordingly, to get along better with the locals; and b.) perhaps even make an effort to see how royalty is treated. (The latter is an interesting halachic point for some other time.) Both of those points are about <em>de facto</em>, who is regarded as king. The person's technical halachic lineage really shouldn't matter.</p>\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Pahlavi,_Crown_Prince_of_Iran\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">eldest son of the Last Shah of Iran</a>. He's a Pahlavi, he lives in Virginia. There is no halacha that says \"respect all Pahlavis.\" The halacha says \"respect whoever the locals say should be respected!\"</p>\n<p>If we went with strict halachic definitions of lineage, for instance, then His Majesty Charles III is a Mountbatten (his father's side), not a Windsor (his mother's side), as non-Jews' lineage is strictly patrilineal. The royal family are the Windsors. Does that make him any less king? Absolutely not! If the UK says he's the king, then he's the king!</p>\n<p>The one interesting case that would come up is what <em>bracha</em> you say upon seeing them. A non-Jewish head of state warrants the blessing \"[G-d, who] gave of His honor to flesh and blood.\" A Jewish head of state gets \"[G-d, who] shared some of His honor with those who revere Him.\" The halacha here does note that the latter phrasing applies to any observant, G-d fearing Jew who is a head of state. It doesn't matter that their state is nowhere near Israel, nor that their subjects are mostly non-Jewish. (E.g. in some alternate reality where Joe Lieberman became the US President.) But on this last point, the blessing is reserved for the head of state, so a prince or the like wouldn't trigger it regardless.</p>\n\n\n",

This is the case of a regular person. But the second case – “or\nhis house is next door to the shul.” So, the question is – if his\nhouse is right next to the synagogue, why is he not coming to shul on\nRosh Hashanah? What is he doing listening to the shofar from his\nhouse? The answer is that we are speaking about someone who has no\ninterest in going to shul. This person is so far removed from Rosh\nHashanah that when he hears the shofar blast, he thinks it might be a\ndonkey braying. What kind of a Jew can think such a thing? The answer\nis we are speaking of a Jew who is that far away from proper behavior\nand thoughts on this holy day. Nevertheless, the Mishna is teaching us\nthat “No!” If in one minute, he says “Hey! That is a shofar” then that\nrecognition can lift him out of the dungeon. In that one minute, he\ncan experience “from the trash heaps, He lifts up the destitute.”\n[Tehllim 113:7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone know where this teaching comes from and where I can find the original?

The prophet would set up an interpreter before him, and\nwhen he perceived a prophecy coming upon him, he would recite the\nprophecy to the interpreter, who would make it heard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This reflects the earlier statement of the Sages where they said (Pes. 117a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every Psalm in which “maskil” is mentioned was said through an\ninterpreter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My pshat understanding of this comment is that there is an interpreter between the prophet and the listener.</p>\n<p>For somebody to interpret something, there is a source language and a target language. So, if Hebrew was the target language, as this Psalm is in the Hebrew language, what was the source language, for which an interpreter is needed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Ohr ha-Hamah (R. Zundel Kroizer) on Psalms 88:1 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ע\"י תורגמן אמרו ואין מבואר מה ענינו של תורגמן בזה ואפשר דכל מזמור שהוא\nחשוב לכל העם ורצה שכולם ישמעוהו העמיד מתורגמן שישמיע את המזמור הזה\nלרבים וכדוגמא מה שהיה נהוג בימי האמוראים שכל רב שהיה רוצה להשמיע העמיד\nאמורא לפניו מה שהוא לחש לו בשקט</p>\n<p>By means of a <em>turgeman</em> they [i.e. the Sages] said. And it isn't\nentirely evident what the purpose of this <em>turgeman</em> was. It could be\nthat each psalm that was important for the nation, he wanted everyone\nto hear it, so he appointed a <em>meturgeman</em> to cause it to be heard by\nthe masses. Similarly, during the Amoraic era if a Rabh wanted to be\nheard, he appointed a <em>meturgeman</em> before the Amora to cause to be\nheard what he had whispered quietly to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ohr ha-Hamah here suggests that the meturgeman is utilized as an amplifier and interpreter of the original speaker. He analogizes it to the Amoraic institution of the meturgeman which the <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10742-meturgeman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Encyclopedia</a> describes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The head of the academy, while seated, would tell him in Hebrew and in\na low voice the outline of his lecture; and the meturgeman would in a\nlengthy popular discourse explain it in the vernacular to the\naudience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Adin Steinsaltz takes a similar tact, and explains <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Steinsaltz_on_Pesachim.117a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesahim 117a</a> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם המזמור מתחיל בלשון \"משכיל\" — כוונתו שאמרו על ידי תורגמן, שנאמר\nלרבים כעין דרשה. שהוא אמרו כדרשן הדורש בלחש, והמתורגמן אמרו ופירשו\nברבים</p>\n<p>If a psalm begins with the language of \"maskil\" - the intention is\nthat it was said by means of an interpreter (meturgeman) that was said\nto the masses like a homily. And it is said by the homiletician as a\nwhispered homily and the interpreter says and explains it to the\nmasses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this understanding, the source language is a technical language accessible to the wise and their adepts, and the target language is the common vernacular of the masses. It isn't quite that Hebrew was being translated into an altogether different language (such as Aramaic), rather it was being translated from a less accessible form to a more accessible one. By analogy, different professions have their own \"lingo\" - they aren't exactly speaking a different language, but it may as well be if one isn't initiated to the respective field. Its kind of like the meturgeman gives the TED-Talk version of the psalm for the benefit of the masses.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ben_Yehoyada_on_Pesachim.117a.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ben yeoyada</a> explains as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה שאמרו 'מַשְׂכִּיל', עַל יְדֵי תֻּרְגְּמָן, נראה לי בס\"ד 'מַשְׂכִּיל' אותיות שם כלי דהמתורגמן הוא כלי של הדרשן שבו משקה מים של הדרשה לרבים.\nWhen it says \"maskil\" [it means] via an interpreter.

Not for the reasons you suggest, which I think are more an area of personal preference, but because the time between sunset and tzeis hacochavim is questionably nightime, and Mariv should be said when it is certainly nightime.</p>\n<p>However, I do remember seeing someplace which ruled more leniently (but I can't manage to find that source right now).</p>\n<p>I did ask my Rabbi about this once, and he said that the custom is to be lenient and therefore he wouldn't tell anyone not to do it, but since I was asking (presumably, he said, because I was looking to do what's <em>lechatchila</em>), he would tell me it is better to say Mariv in a minyan that waits until after tzeis hacochavim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>EDIT: @DoubleAA Granted the minhag during the time of the Rishonim was to daven very close to Tzeis 1, as proven from the R\"i, but the OP said davening maariv after Shkia.

Also, the Gemara in Berachos 29b says it is a mitzvah to daven Minchah as close as possible to Sh'kia, because of the pasuk (Tehillim 72:5) Let them fear you with the sun, which Rashi says refers to Krias Shema.</p>\n<p>THe only kasha you might have is regarding the fact that it seems that you are treating it as a load, rather than a privilege, which the Gemara Berachos ibid. does mention. That most likely refers to davening very quickly, hanging out near the door to be the first to leave etc. not specifically davening at these times, which the Gemara and Rishonim explicitly state are the best!</p>\n<p>For further reading see the following:</p>\n<pre><code>Gemara Berachos 2a, BErachos 27a.\nRashi Berachos 2a D\"H Ad Sof.\nTosafos Berachos 2a D\"H ma'aimasai\nRabbeinu Yonah Berachos 2a.\nRashb\"a BErachos 2a.\nTur Orach Chaim Siman 235.\nShulchan Aruch 235.\nShagas Aryeh Siman 3.\n</code></pre>\n<p>1 I don't know how to do footnotes, but by tzeis I mean 13.5 minutes after the start of Bein HaShmashos, not the chumra of calling the seventy-two minutes between shkia of the gra and tzeis of rabbeinu tam bein hashmashos...</p>\n\n\n",

I want to know if anyone discusses the halacha regarding shalom bayit and/or the obligation to be with your family versus a man going alone to Uman.</p>\n<p>In practice, whole families are not going to Uman. In most cases, the man will leave his wife and children to make the pilgrimage alone. To me, this seems unthinkable on such an important day. Which is why I am interested in whether someone has written about this.</p>\n<p>Part of me thinks that if the wife accepts it, then that's their choice: fine. But part of me thinks whether it is ok if tens (hundreds?) of thousands of families won't have the father figure there with them on an important day, which is a big loss. I am not a Breslov, or a person in this situation, so I don't know the family dynamics and potential pressures of ensuring that the husband goes to Uman.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You are 100% correct, @bondonk.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nishmat_Adam.68.3?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chayei Adam</a> has a long discussion of a man who lives in a city with no shofar: should he travel to another city to fulfill the Biblical obligation of Shofar and leave his family behind. His conclusion is that there is also a Biblical obligation for a man to be with his wife on Holidays, so ultimately he would gain nothing by hearing Shofar and leaving his wife, so he should stay home.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>נ\"ל דא\"צ לעקור מביתו לילך לעיר אחרת לקיים המצוה אפילו מצוה דאורייתא והוא עוברות כתקיעת שופר ולולב</strong> וראיה מהא דר\"ה דף ל\"ד וש\"ע סימן תקצ\"ה. היו לפניו ב' עיירות באחת תוקעין ובאחת מברכין כו' ואי ס\"ד שצריך לעקור ממקומו קשה היאך ימצא עיר שמברכין ולא תוקעין והלא צריכין לעקור ממקומן לילך לעיר שתוקעין אע\"כ דא\"צ לעקור ומיהו נ\"ל דבמקום דאזיל ואתי ביומיה מחוייב לילך וכדאיתא בסוכה כ\"ו ע\"ב ועיין ריש סימן קס\"ג במ\"א וצ\"ע <strong>ומ\"מ במי שיש לו אשה או בנים נ\"ל דודאי א\"צ לעקור דירתו שהרי שמחה הוא ג\"כ מ\"ט מה\"ת וקיי\"ל אשה בעלה משמחה.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have heard Rabbanim apply this to say that according to the Chayei Adam one should definitely not leave his family to go to Uman. After all, would anyone in their right mind go to Uman if that would mean missing out on Shofar? And even Shofar is not enough of a reason to leave one's wife or children on Rosh Hashanah.</p>\n<p>Rav Ovadya Yosef is also widely quoted as saying not to go. He says no Jew with \"da'at\" (intelligence) would go, because a man belongs with his family on Rosh Hashana.

    "content": "# How did G-d bring creation into the world without changing? Did He not have to decide to create at some point? How did He bring creation without time?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So the question is something like this: If G-d, blessed be He, willed creation into being, then</p>\n<p>a) He either underwent change (deciding to create) [Impossible]</p>\n<p>b) He always knew that He was going to create something but time didn't exist then so it couldn't have been Him deciding at any X point to create something and He couldn't have thus always decided to do something in the future or in the intervals and hence this is also: [Impossible]</p>\n<p>According to the above two, creation is a change from nothing to something - but its still a change which posits the question - where would this change occur? It can't be within G-d, blessed be He, for His essence can't change, so it must be somewhere external to G-d, blessed be He.</p>\n<p>c) The only  solution to this that I've heard is that G-d, blessed be He, has always been creating something, i.e. an eternal creation or eternal creations. Since the material world is not eternal, this creation or these creations are eternal (but in a different way from G-d, blessed be He, for He is eternal by His intrinsic essence while these creations would be eternal only contingently i.e. by virtue of being eternally created and sustained by G-d, blessed be He, and completely subject to His infinite and perfect will) and transcedental. This can also be phrased like this: \"G-d, blessed be He, is infinitely good, and a part of goodness entails sharing that goodness. Hence, G-d, blessed be He, by eternally aligning Himself with His perfect essence necessarily creates something in order to share goodness.\"</p>\n<p>Also I don't think this is problematic, (someone could say that this implies that G-d, blessed be He, is in some ways dependent on creation). But I disagree and would posit that G-d, blessed be He, might be \"dependent\" on His <em>act</em> of creation (i.e. on Himself) in order to bring about absolute perfection in every way. Thus He is not contingent on the creation itself, but rather on the act of creating, which is to say that He is contingent on His will which is just to say that He is contingent on Himself (His essence) or in other words, that He is wholly unto Himself (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.3.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 3:14</a>). If He is eternally willing something due to His goodness, then He is also eternally perfect and good.</p>\n<p>And this is not an unusual idea per se. For example, in the following chapter of a book <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198843252.003.0002\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Principles of Judaism\"</a>, it states as a summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This chapter explores the medieval debate about the nature of creation. It compares and contrasts arguments of three major schools. <strong>The first school suggests that the universe had no start, and that God’s work of creation is, accordingly, continuous and with no beginning.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, I argue that it can't be the universe, but the idea of something being eternally created and sustained is not new or strange in Jewish thought. It would be a different type of eternity however, for there is nothing comparable to G-d, blessed be He.</p>\n<p>Actually one could even perhaps say that Heaven/Heavens itself is such an eternal creation, a \"throne\" or an \"abode\" for G-d, blessed be He. Since Rambam argued that the proper view in Judaism is eternal souls, and since souls can't literally \"reunify\" <em>inside</em> G-d's essence (can't have change or multiplicity), then the only other option is if there is some eternal realm where such a reunion can happen, like a Heaven. So one may understand Heaven(s) to be eternally created and sustained at every imaginable moment of existence. And Heavens can have multiplicity of course.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'd appreciate some help with regards to this topic. I think that a lot of people on this site don't really like these types of questions, or consider them nonsensical or something else (when I ask them, they're rarely answered, and often downvoted or given improper treatment), but these are quite important so I hope this question will be taken seriously. Perhaps Kabbalistic insights may be of use here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<hr />\n<p>Definition of \"essence\" in this context:</p>\n<p><em>the truest description of an entity as it exists by itself, without adjustment for relationship or comparison</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>A very small addendum to <strong>a)</strong>, and a modest redefinition of something you said in <strong>b)</strong> will clarify things.</p>\n<p>One of the most relevant Divine powers to us, and certainly one of the most incredible, is the ability to be present in all perspectives. This is, to many non believers, the most difficult religious precept to understand. They are puzzled at why Omnipotent Divinity would care about the actions of mortals, and why it would be interesting, or worthwhile, to punish and reward, to protect and instruct, and to otherwise run the world. However, we understand this literally Divine level of humility to be the bedrock of our relationship, that <strong>despite our relative insignificance, G-d experiences the world from our perspective</strong>, and cares about the world that we share.</p>\n<p>So when we refer to G-d, what perspective should we use? It depends on the context, certainly, but oftentimes we will adopt the perspective that you used in <strong>a)</strong>, which is Divine essence, which never changes. However, there are Divine perspectives in which creation <em><strong>did</strong></em> cause changes! So we can add to <strong>a)</strong> that we are talking about <strong>the Divine in\nessence , where creation never happened, because that perspective shows how really everything that appears to have adopted independent definitions and identities within the world, is truly just Divinity, without any separate definition whatsoever.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Definition</strong> and <strong>independent identity</strong> are features of creations that correlate to increased distance from the perspective of root Divinity. To introduce this idea, it's worth going back to kabbalistic creation. There's a lot to say on that, but here's the summary: <em>Divinity is ultimately unlimited, and as such there are no adjectives, definitions or measures that are fully appropriate, because they are all limiting Divinity in some way. Even 'unlimited' is limiting, because it denotes that the features of infinity are binding in a detrimental way (such as being unable to fit in a finite space). From that complete lack of binding definition, creation began to gradually add definition, beginning with spiritual concepts. A famous example is \"male\" as \"giver\", originally applied to Hashem as the provider of creative energy. Those concepts continued to take on more and more specific features until they could fit into the confines of time and space, which also were creations that began as concepts.</em> This demonstrates how definition is correlated with distance from Divinity. Likewise, since earlier stages of creation are less defined and therefore more Divine, the potential for independent identity is less available. The perception of one's independence from Divinity becomes possible when one's self and surroundings are many stages of abstraction away from unlimited, unbound Divinity. If all one knows and sees are things that exist in space and time, one can imagine that there is nothing beyond the scope of space and time, and in fact will find it difficult to imagine otherwise. Yet all the stages of creation coexist, so at root Divinity all concepts are still undefined and unbound, and effectively creation never happened. Perception at this stage does not view mortals as independent beings, nor their decisions as anything but Divine will, because the progression of the stages of creation demonstrates how everything is molded from Divinity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now to <strong>b)</strong>, where we can point out that <em>time is a creation too (!)</em>. In the perspective above creation, time is no constraint.This is tough to wrap our minds around, but we can try:</p>\n<p>Time as we know it represents a choice for which actions to postpone for later, time prevents the total reversal of actions, and time creates distance between the present and past. For a perspective where everything can be done simultaneously, any reversal is possible, and nothing is forgotten, time effectively doesn't exist.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Of course, this is all an attempt to explain from a time bound perspective; what would timelessness look like to us if we saw a being with that power in our world? \"Simultaneously\" from a Divine perspective just means that time does not impose an order to actions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ok, we tried. Now if we can redefine time as a creation that doesn't actually dictate anything to Divine essence, then <em>there is no before and after</em>. In fact, there is no creation at all (as explained before, that all creation is really still Divinity). However, to the lower perspectives, there is both time and change.</p>\n<p>So what's still confusing? <em><strong>All the perspectives are one, not separate in any way.</strong></em> This is a principle that is above human comprehension, and to that end, the other answer does deserve some merit, even if it seems unsatisfying at first. Noahides are not commanded to believe in this extreme level of unity, because it is wildly illogical, a matter of faith alone. For Jews however, this is a mitzvah. See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4094433/jewish/Mitzvas-Haamanas-Elokus-Prologue.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Mitzvosecha</a> for a more precise explanation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The perspective at each stage of creation is dependent on the evolution of concepts at that stage. But eventually, all the concepts progress to the same end of evolution (our physical world), and therefore all pertain to the same plan. That plan is the result of a desire from the Divine essence to be recognized by choice, which is only possible in our world (since concepts at the angelic stages are too abstract, similar to Divinity, so angels have a perspective that recognizes Divinity without contemplation). If every stage of creation is really enacting that plan which is in Divine essence, then the concepts within each stage are just a different way of viewing what is happening. Since Hashem creates all the stages, he knows what the plan looks like to each stage. That's what the perspectives are. However, \"before\" creating them, he knew what they could look like, so it's not increased knowledge.</p>\n<p>Excellent questions like these also motivate the idea of <a href=\"https://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php/%D7%A0%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%A2_%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נמנע הנמנעות</a>. It's worth mentioning that part of belief in unlimited Divinity is a belief that even the rules of logic do not create a limit for Hashem, since they are in fact, concepts that remain created. Support for this idea also comes from the ark, which is described as simultaneously having defined space and not taking up space at all.

We can only relate to G-d through being His creations, therefore anything \"before\" creation is beyond our understanding. In fact the Talmud (Chagiga 11b) specifically forbids us from considering these questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יכול ישאל אדם קודם שנברא העולם, תלמוד לומר: ״למן היום אשר ברא אלהים אדם על הארץ״.<br />\nOne might have thought that a person may ask questions with regard to matters preceding the creation of the world. Therefore, the continuation of the verse states: “Since the day that God created man upon the earth,” but not earlier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna (Chagiga 2:1) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין דורשין בעריות בשלשה. ולא במעשה בראשית בשנים. ולא במרכבה ביחיד, אלא אם כן היה חכם ומבין מדעתו. <strong>כל המסתכל בארבעה דברים, ראוי לו כאלו לא בא לעולם, מה למעלה, מה למטה, מה לפנים, ומה לאחור. וכל שלא חס על כבוד קונו, ראוי לו שלא בא לעולם:</strong><br />\nOne may not expound the topic of forbidden sexual relations before three or more individuals; nor may one expound the act of Creation and the secrets of the beginning of the world before two or more individuals; nor may one expound by oneself the Design of the Divine Chariot, a mystical teaching with regard to the ways God conducts the world, unless he is wise and understands most matters on his own. The mishna continues in the same vein: Whoever looks at four matters, it would have been better for him had he never entered the world: <strong>Anyone who reflects upon what is above the firmament and what is below the earth, what was before Creation, and what will be after the end of the world. And anyone who has no concern for the honor of his Maker, who inquires into and deals with matters not permitted to him, deserves to have never come to the world.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Maimonides in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Foundations_of_the_Torah.1.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book of Knowledge (foundations of Torah 1, 11)</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"He (God) is not found within time, so that He would possess a\nbeginning, an end, or age. He does not change, for there is nothing\nthat can cause Him to change.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Conscious will necessarily implies change. If God has conscious will and decides to create the universe, then this is change. Prior to this decision God did not intend to create the universe, implying change in deciding to do so - and, God did not create the universe until doing so implying change in doing so. God, in Maimonides' conception, has no conscious will and cannot change.</p>\n<p>There is another approach. It is possible that matter existed as long as God. God did not make it. God formed the world out of pre-existing matter that existed for all eternity. Maimonides uses the analogy of the sun emanating light. The universe is emanated from God (as light is emanated from the sun). Maimonides also uses the analogy of a spring to explain the notion of emanation in the Guide 2, 12, and he uses the image of the sun in the Guide 2, 21. This is also the view of Aristotle.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a conversion be deemed invalid because of something a rabbi on the beit-din once said?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've read a post where a person's conversion was deemed inappropriate because one of the Rabbis once said, when asked, 'would you officiate a mixed marriage?' The Rabbi, a distinguished knowledgeable learned man, said, 'I'll think about.'  According to the converting man, he was told his conversion was not kosher because 'that' Rabbi sat on his beit din.</p>\n<p>I understood the purpose of the rabbis on the beit din were measuring up the converting person. How does a Rabbi's statement change this?</p>\n<p>It's important to note that the \"I'll think about it,\" comment could just mean \"I will think about it. What are the ramifications, what negatives, are there positives.\"  Someone else interpreted it as, \"Yes, sure I'll check my diary and call you.\"</p>\n<p>This is a true story.  It's a bit like the thought-police listen. Or, more to the point, the thought-judges, as their actions affect others hurting them at the core of their spirit.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I can't write long because the Chag starts soon, but the question is based on a misunderstanding. The purpose of the court is much more fundamental than assessing the convert; it is Biblically required in order for the conversion to be valid (Yevamos 46b and 47a). So if this \"rabbi\" is not qualified to be on the court -and if he would officiate an intermarriage, he would be- then the court itself is invalid and unable to effect a conversion. It has nothing to do with the poor convert, who may have been totally sincere. It is the fact that the Biblically required court was invalid.</p>\n<p>I'll just add, which courts are qualified to accept converts is a very  important issue for potential converts to be aware of. The Israeli Rabbinate only accepts converts from certain courts in America, so someone who converts in other courts might not be recognized as Jewish by the State of Israel. Similarly, Orthodox courts don't recognize conversions performed by non-Orthodox denominations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't think there is enough information here to speak to a specific case, however there are halakhoth that govern the invalidation of members of a beth-din.</p>\n<p>In general the rules for who is invalidated from being a dayan on beth-din follows the same disqualifications for a witness (Niddah 49b): 1) whether he engages in financial improprieties (Sanhedrin 27a) or 2) he is iniquitous as demonstrated by the fact that he violates transgressions that incur lashes (H. Eduth 10:1, SA:HM 34:2).</p>\n<p>It can get quite a bit more detailed than that (i.e. distinctions between biblical and rabbinic lashes, whether the offense was public, whether the person was warned, whether they were themselves witnessed in the act by kosher witnesses, etc.), however these are the general contours.</p>\n<p>There is also the matter of when the transgression has occurred. Has it occurred before or after their giving of testimony/rendering of judgement? The general consensus seems to be that if one engages in behavior that invalidates their ability to continue to sit on a beth-din, it does not invalidate their prior actions on the beth-din when they were in good standing (SA HM 34:23). Indeed if it is unclear when their transgression began, the presumption is that it was after they gave testimony/judgement - leaving the judgement standing (Rema ad. loc.).</p>\n<p>If one is interested in exploring this topic further, there is an informative analysis in ch. 12 of R. Yona Reiss's Kanfei Yonah.</p>\n<p>Of course, any real case of concern concerning halakhic identity and status within the larger community ought be presented to appropriately competent rabbinic authorities to adjudicate over the particular case with its own peculiar details. This is just a general summary of how such cases proceed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Potent and relevant question that points out how difficult being a convert can be, even long after the conversion process.</p>\n<p>Since your question was \"What are your thoughts?\", I'll point out that a technicality of accepting a conversion is that the converting person must accept the mitzvos according to the understanding of the Beis Din. This is so that there is a record that they have accepted the mitzvos according to the interpretations that religious Jews use. In order to establish this record, we need a Beis Din of people who both know those Mitzvos and interpret them according to accepted modes of interpretation.</p>\n<p>Since intermarriage is forbidden by Torah law, and officiating an intermarriage is encouraging/enabling a Jew to transgress a Torah law according to all accepted interpretations, the statement \"I'll think about it\", suggests that he <em>might</em> be considering alternative interpretations to Jewish law than the accepted ones. That would throw suspicion on whether or not there was a kosher Beis Din to administer the intent of the acceptance of the Mitzvos when the conversion was performed.</p>\n<p>(Again, since you asked for our thoughts I'll note that officiating an intermarriage is not a neutral stance at all. It's an extremely clear divide which requires a change in core, fundamental beliefs to be able to cross. Likewise, thousands of older folks who have given up virtually all religious practice hang on to that one precept, imploring their children and grandchildren to marry Jewish. Those Jews, who may not be wildly knowledgeable or faithful, and who often have had to give up so much of their former practice because of war and pain, still recognize this as the one Jewish value they cannot compromise on. For a Rabbi who claims to be religious to even suggest crossing that line, requires a total dissimilarity of outlook.)</p>\n<p>That kind of suspicion can be very damaging to a person, because the consequences of its potential confirmation can be quite far reaching, as I'm sure you know. As a result,\nI can understand why it might be suggested for someone who converted in earnest and had something patently unfair like this happen to them, to perform a second conversion.</p>\n<p>I'm no expert in conversion, just sharing some thoughts.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Pergola - Kosher scach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This pergola was originally put up a around 2 weeks before Sukkos 5783. The shade that this makes is at least 50/50 (if not more.)</p>\n<p>So several questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is this kosher scach by itself? If yes, what about now a year later, the person would have to lift up and put down every small piece of wood to be able to machshir it for this year?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If it's not kosher scach by itself, why? And if a person wants to put up a bamboo sheet (or anything that is yes \"kosher scach\") on top of it does it \"make trouble\" the fact that it's there (the beams that are \"not kosher\" -- for whatever reason.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If it's kosher scach as it is and the person does not lift up every beam and puts kosher scach on top of it is it a problem?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OlOuQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OlOuQ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The amount of shade is likely sufficient. The amount of shade is measured at the schach level: if the schach is more than the empty space <a href=\"https://shulchanarukh.alhatorah.org/Full/Orach_Chayyim/631.1#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the schach is kosher</a>. It certainly appears from your picture that you have more schach than empty space. Even if you don't have enough schach coverage now, a few pieces of bamboo on top would provide enough total coverage. While the amount of schach is probably fine, there's another problem here, as follows.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It's hard to tell from your picture, but generally pergola boards are finished boards (as opposed to rough pieces of wood). Large boards (4 tefachim - approximately 36cm wide) are posul mdrabbanan even when placed on the narrow end. This is called the \"gezairas tikrah\", a Rabbinic psul due to the similarity with the roof of a house. The Rama says the minhag is to refrain from using finished boards that are even smaller than the four tefach shuir. See Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://shulchanarukh.alhatorah.org/Full/Orach_Chayyim/629.18#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HERE</a> .\nIf it's unfinished pieces of wood then this problem would not apply and your succah would be fine.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I don't know if it is a problem or not to put kosher schach on top of boards that provide more shade than sun on their own. This may depend on if your boards are four tefachim wide and therefore posul mdrabannan or less than that and not truly posul. (Putting kosher schach on top of pasul schach generally doesn't help.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the schach is kosher, your question about lifting them up again this year is based on the problem of \"succah yeshana\", an old succah. Roofing that is kosher schach but was not put up to be used for the mitzvah of succah should be refreshed for the <a href=\"https://shulchanarukh.alhatorah.org/Full/Orach_Chayyim/636.1#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mitzvah</a>.  The Mishna Berurah ad loc. paskens that schach that was put up to be used as a succah last year also needs to be refreshed for this year's succah. The Shulchan Aruch, ad loc. states that only a small portion of the schach needs to be lifted.\nYour case may be slightly worse than a regular succah yeshana since you were living in the pergola the whole year. The Mishna Berura ad loc. points out that a roof you were living under the whole year <em>must</em> be refreshed. <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/an-old-sukkah-using-a-sukkah-that-remains-intact-throughout-the-year-i-e-pergolas/#_ftn15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This thorough article</a> (footnote 16) has a proof from the Mishna Berura <a href=\"https://shulchanarukh.alhatorah.org/Full/Orach_Chayyim/636.2#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that in such cases all the schach must be lifted up and put back down.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>One additional point to keep in mind is that many pergolas have only a roof and no walls. Even the most kosher schach that is placed before the walls are erected is pasul because of \"t'aseh vlo min ha'assuy\". If this is the case, the schach must be lifted up and replaced after the walls are erected. See Rama <a href=\"https://shulchanarukh.alhatorah.org/Full/Orach_Chayyim/635.1#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HERE.</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nothing written here should be relied on halachically, but I think this covers the basics on your question.</p>\n\n\n",

But, to whatever degree they are not flesh like, they would not have been included in the general description of 'from all the flesh', and the Torah had to use the description 'from all that lives', to include the shades.</p>\n<p>As to why save them, first answer why Hashem would why save any of the carnivores and destructive creatures (man included, see there 8:21), and apply that to shades.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Biological sample from the ancient dead\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there any halachic justification, or permission, to take a biological sample from a dead person in an ancient site? For example, in Israel there are many archeological digs which sometimes result in the findings of human remains. Should such remains be left where they are, buried properly, etc. and/or can fragments of the remains be taken for analysis? Such analyses are regularly done to date the remains rather than to solve some dispute.</p>\n<p>This is different from discussions around <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/53674/can-an-autopsy-be-performed-on-a-jewish-body\">autopsies</a> which have more relevant application to people who are still alive e.g., cause of death, solving a murder.</p>\n<p>For those that would permit taking biological samples from a dead person, what would be the reasons for allowing it, and how? Is taking a tissue sample different from a hair or bone sample? From what I understand several grams are needed for biological analyses of ancient remains (although it obviously depends on the age of the remains, what it actually is and the level of decay).</p>\n<p>For example, if there is an unmarked burial site somewhere in central Europe from the 17th century and there is a question-mark over whether it is a Jewish burial site, can DNA samples be taken to verify to the authorities that it is indeed Jewish (if that is even possible), so that Jewish groups could better advocate for the Jewish burial site to be protected?</p>\n<p>Another example: if it would ever be permitted, can biological samples be taken from places like Me'arat HaMachpelah? There have not been many studies of the cave itself (<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/43636436/Iron_Age_Pottery_from_the_Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_at_Hebron\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). This could be for pure interest, but there could be a time in the future (unlikely!) that some DNA analysis of the contents of the cave could be used to solve some land dispute.</p>\n<p>I would be interested to hear general discussion regarding this, but if you have specific examples, that would also be of interest.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First off, halacha does not recognize dna testing to be a valid means of proving that someone is jewish.\nThe halachic concept which I believe would apply is called nibul hamet, desecration of the dead. This is relevant for non-Jewish as well as jewish corpses. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Noda_BiYhudah_II,_Yoreh_Deah_210.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noda beyehuda</a> on this topic writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד הביא כבוד מעלתו ראיה מסוגיא דחולין דף י\"א ע\"ב וכ\"ת משום איבוד נשמה דהאי נינווליה כו' הרי דלהציל הרוצח היה מותר לנוול ההרוג וכ\"ת דשם ודאי הצלה הוא וכאן ספק הוא שירפאו הרופאים פעם אחרת ע\"י כן, שם ג\"כ ספק הוא שמא ימצא טריפה ועוד דגם ספק פיקוח נפש דוחה כל איסורין שבתורה חוץ מתלת. והאריך מעלתו בדבר זה. והנה בזה אמינא דלכאורה דברי הגמרא תמוהים דאיך קאמר משום איבוד נשמה דהאי נינווליה דאדרבה ע\"י הניוול אנו רוצים להמית הרוצח ואם לא ננוולנו ינצל הרוצח דאמרינן טריפה הרג. ואמנם פירוש הדברים הם כך דאם אתה אומר שלא התירה התורה לנוולו א\"כ על כרחך צותה להמיתו בלי בדיקה ולא לחוש כלל לשמא טריפה הרג יותר נכון לומר שהתורה צותה והצילו העדה לחוש שמא טריפה הרג ולא להרגו בלי בדיקה ולינוול שאם התורה התירה לנוולו אין לנו לחוש לניוולו, הא חדא. ועוד דאי אמרינן שלעולם לא יהרג הרוצח בלי בדיקת הנהרג א\"כ ניוול זה הוא לכבודו של הנרצח וכל מה שהוא לכבודו אין בו משום ניוול.</p>\n<p>Your Excellency also cited a prooftext from Hullin 11b: “if you say: let us desecrate this [victim] to save the life of that [murderer]”—that is, it should be permissible to desecrate the murder victim in order to save the murderer [from punishment, if the victim was found to be terminally ill in any case]. And if you say that in that case it is certain that a life will be saved, whereas in the present case it is uncertain that the doctors will cure someone next time due to this autopsy, the response is that there, too, it is uncertain that the victim will be found to have been terminally ill. Moreover, even if it uncertain that a life will be saved, all of the prohibitions of the Torah are superseded, except for three. Your excellency wrote about this at length. Regarding this, I say that the Talmud’s statements are puzzling. How could it say that we desecrate [the victim’s corpse] in order to save a life? On the contrary. The desecration serves to kill the murderer, for if we do not desecrate, the murderer will be saved, because we will say that he killed someone with a terminal illness. Rather, this is the interpretation of these words. If you suggest that the Torah does not permit desecration, perforce it commands us to put [a murderer] to death without examining and without any concern that the murder victim has a terminal illness, it would make more sense to say that the Torah commands “the congregation shall save”—namely, that we must be concerned lest he killed someone with a terminal illness, and therefore [the murderer] should not be put to death without an examination. And let there be desecration, for if the Torah permitted desecration, there is no reason to be concerned about desecration. Moreover, if we say that the murderer can never be put to death unless the victim is examined, this desecration is for the honor of the victim, and anything for his honor does not constitute desecration.</p>\n<p>את כל אלה כתבתי לפי דבריכם שאתם קורים זה פיקוח והצלת נפש. אבל אני תמה הלא אם זה יקרא אפילו ספק הצלת נפשות א\"כ למה לכם כל הפלפול והלא זה הוא דין ערוך ומפורש שאפילו ספק דוחה שבת החמורה ומשנה מפורשת ביומא דף פ\"ג וכל ספק נפשות דוחה שבת ושם דף פ\"ד ע\"ב ולא ספק שבת זו אלא אפילו ספק שבת אחרת ע\"ש. ואמנם כ\"ז ביש ספק סכנת נפשות לפנינו כגון חולה או נפילת גל, וכן במס' חולין שם גבי רוצח הפיקוח נפש לפנינו וכן אפילו לענין ממון שם במס' ב\"ב ההיזק לפנינו אבל בנדון דידן אין כאן שום חולה הצריך לזה רק שרוצים ללמוד חכמה זו אולי יזדמן חולה שיהיה צריך לזה ודאי דלא דחינן משום חששא קלה זו שום איסור תורה או אפילו איסור דרבנן שאם אתה קורא לחששא זו ספק נפשות א\"כ יהיה כל מלאכת הרפואות שחיקת ובישול סמנים והכנת כלי איזמל להקזה מותר בשבת שמא יזדמן היום או בלילה חולה שיהיה צורך לזה ולחלק בין חששא לזמן קרוב לחששא לזמן רחוק קשה לחלק. וחלילה להתיר דבר זה ואפילו רופאי האומות אינן עושים נסיון בחכמת הניתוח ע\"י שום מת כי אם בהרוגים ע\"פ משפט או במי שהסכים בעצמו בחייו לכך ואם אנו ח\"ו מקילים בדבר זה א\"כ ינתחו כל המתים כדי ללמוד סידור אברים הפנימים ומהותן כדי שידעו לעשות רפואות להחיים. ולכן האריכות בזה הוא ללא צורך ואין בזה שום צד להתיר. ולדעתי שגגה יצאה מלפני כבוד מעלתו שמיהר להשיב להקל.</p>\n<p>I have written all of this in accordance with your words, for you call this saving lives. But I am puzzled. If this is considered even a questionable case of saving lives, why must you engage in all of these mental gymnastics? It is clear and explicit that even an uncertainty supersedes the severity of Shabbat, and there is an explicit mishna on Yoma 83 that the possibility of saving a life supersedes Shabbat. And there on 84b it states that not only an uncertainty concerning the present Shabbat, but even an uncertainty concerning a different Shabbat [supersedes]. However, this all applies when there is a present case of uncertainty concerning a risk to life—such as a sick person or collapsed building. Similarly, in the case in Hullin regarding a murderer, the risk to life is present. So too in the monetary case in Bava Batra, the potential damage is present. But in our case, there is no ill person who needs this. Rather, they want to study this discipline in case they encounter a sick person who requires it. We certainly do not supersede any Torah prohibition or even a rabbinic prohibition due to such a slight concern. For if you call this concern “an uncertainty pertaining to a life,” then any task related to healing—grinding and cooking medicine or preparing a scalpel for bloodletting—will be permitted on Shabbat, perhaps they will encounter a sick person who requires it that night or the next day. It is also difficult to distinguish between concern for the need arising in the near future and concern for the need arising in the distant future. Heaven forfend that such a thing should be permitted. Even gentile physicians do not gain surgical experience with just any corpse, but only with those put to death by the law or with those who themselves consented to it while living. If we, God forbid, are lax in this matter, they will operate on every corpse to learn anatomy and physiology, so that they may know how to cure the living. Therefore, this is all unnecessarily lengthy, and there is no lenient approach whatsoever. In my opinion, your Excellency was mistaken in rushing to respond leniently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Translation from Sefaria)</p>\n<p>From this reponsa we derive that we would ignore the law of ניבול המת for pikuach nefesh, such a purpose would not be a desecration of the body, but rather a kavod for the meis. However, this only applies if it's a real case of pikuach nefesh that is at hand currently. Thus, this excludes scientific research such as your question.</p>\n\n\n",

Goneniia na zhenskie golovye ubory, (1853)”\nEvreiskaia starina 8 (1915): 400–401.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Zhitomir city police, without announcing the state order that is\nthe basis for their actions, demand that Jewish women appear in public\nwith uncovered heads, and they accompany this requirement with every\nkind of coercion and unprecedented violence. Thus the district\nsupervisor and policemen tear off the wigs, bonnets, and other\nheaddresses of Jewish women; they drag them by the hair to the police\nstation or guardhouse, pour several buckets full of cold water over\ntheir heads, keep them under arrest for several days, and finally\nforce them to sweep the streets. They drove the merchants’ wives from\nthe theater with humiliating mockery and personal insults for\nappearing in wigs rather than in their own uncovered hair. These\npublic insults and torture of the weaker sex—women—without\ndistinction, without the smallest respect for age and status, have had\nvery harsh consequences: some have fallen gravely ill from shame and\nfear, and they have also paid with their health and perhaps their\nlives to observe their [religious] law, without committing any civil\ncrime.</p>\n<p>Jewish law absolutely forbids women to display their hair, and we see\nthe manifest mercy of our Sovereign Emperor, the All Gracious Monarch,\nin his imperial law of 12 April 1851: he only prohibited Jewish women\nfrom shaving their heads, but without ordering that they appear in\npublic with uncovered heads. In other words, His Majesty does not want\nus to violate our law. We piously obey His Majesty’s will: all of our\nwomen wear their hair; they do not have it shaved and cut.1</p>\n<p>However, they do cover their hair with wigs or other headdresses when\nappearing in public and do not differ from local Christian women of\nvarious ranks. However, to evaluate the unfairness of the Zhitomir\npolice, one should note another imperial directive from 19 August\n1852, which ordered that Jewish women who shave their heads despite\nthe prohibition be fined five silver rubles. Hence, for violating the\nsovereign’s will, His Imperial Majesty established only a monetary\nfine. But the Zhitomir city police, for ignoring its whim, subject\nthem [women] to public insult and torture without a trial (to which no\ncriminal is subject and for which there is not even a designation in\nthe Code of Punishment) and compels our women to violate their own\n[religious] law. What is more, by insulting women publicly, the police\nthemselves are committing a criminal act for what is not even a mere\nmisdemeanor in any law or decree. Our extremely difficult position\ngives us no choice but to seek the protection and patronage of Your\nExcellency, as the chairman of the Committee for the Organization of\nJewish Life. We humbly ask you to issue the appropriate order to end\nthe capricious demand of the Zhitomir city police (which has no basis\nin the exact meaning of the Imperial injunction promulgated by a\ndecree from the State Senate on 12 April 1851) and to protect us from\nthe violent coercion and torture to which our women are subjected for\nobserving their law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Gemara asks that there are only nine time where Hashem prefaces a creation with the words ״ויאמר״ and not ten. The Gemara answers that ״בְּרֵאשִׁית״ נָמֵי מַאֲמָר הוּא, דִּכְתִיב: ״בִּדְבַר ה׳ שָׁמַיִם נַעֲשׂוּ וּבְרוּחַ פִּיו כׇּל צְבָאָם״ - \"The word \"Bereshit\" is also an utterance (even though it's not prefaced with ״ויאמר״) as it states (Psalms, 33;6) “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth”\".</p>\n<p>By all nine creations mentioned there in parshat Bereshit it is clear as to what Hashem created, however the Gemara doesn't clarify as to what Hashem created with the word \"Bereshit\". The Seforno (Bereishit, 1;1) explains that utterance of Bereshit created the concept of time:</p>\n<p>.״בראשית. בתחלת הזמן והוא רגע ראשון בלתי מתחלק שלא היה זמן קודם לו״</p>\n<p>\"Bereshit - at the beginning of time; this is the first moment which is indivisible into shorter periods.

If somebody collapses on the street, a bystander automatically feels for the victim's pulse. Early physicians paid great attention to the character of the pulse in health and disease. For thousands of years, books on the pulse and how important it is have been written, with Galen the most prolific and who has written volumes on the pulse. Many of his descriptions are still being used today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the 18th century (1707) with the invention of the “Physician's Pulse Watch” (a watch with a second hand that could be stopped), changes in pulse rate in health and disease could be accurately assessed. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was invented in 1895 so that analysis of the pulse’ contours advanced further. In the 1960s, digital signal processing techniques proliferated so that now physicians have only to look at the screen display by the patient's bedside to assess a patient's clinical condition. Many doctors feel that feeling the pulse of a patient is no longer necessary and many physicians ignore the arterial pressure tracings displayed on cathode ray tubes in intensive care unit and consider only the numeric display of blood pressure worthy of attention. However, examination of the arterial pressure contour is a clinical tool capable of sometimes providing important information on cardiovascular function. Hence, besides the pulse rate, its regularity and volume are noted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In halacha however, there's a debate whether to follow the ability of breathing or whether we feel a pulse. <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/chapter-1-illness-end-of-life-preparations/#_ftn137\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(See Admur 329:3 [follow breath]; Michaber 329:4; Yuma Mishneh 83a; Gemara 84a for a Machlokes if we follow the heart/pulse or the breath)</a>.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Care_of_the_Critically_Ill%2C_Responsa_of_Rav_Moshe_Feinstein%2C_Iggeros_Moshe%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah_III_132.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quoted</a> in saying that \"a victim may not be breathing because of temporary nerve damage\".

And some a shva na.</p>\n<p>Same thing for וְגַם כָּל הַיְצוּר לֹא נִכְחַד מִמֶּךָּ and כִּי זֵכֶר כָּל הַיְצוּר לְפָנֶיךָ בָּא (musaf of Rosh Hashana, bracha of <em>zichronos</em>).</p>\n<p>As can be gathered from the answers to the above referenced question (and other questions on this site) the shva following הַ (meaning \"the\"), when the following letter does not have a dagesh, should be shva na only when the הַ has a meteg according the biblical mesorah. However, in this case, I have not found that word in tanach, so there would be no way of verifying that rule for this word.</p>\n<p>My question is not which way is correct, but rather what consideration would the siddur editor take for such a word that is not found in tanach, and why would some editors conclude it's nach and some na?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Usually, a letter after the definite article has a dagesh hazak (unless it is a gutteral, or resh). Thus, a sheva under the initial letter of a noun with a definite article would be na.</p>\n<p>In many (though not all) words that start with a sheva under a mem, yod, lamed, etc. the dagesh disappears. The rules of the sheva would normally dictate that in such a syllable, the sheva is nach.</p>\n<p>Evidence for the pronunciation of the sheva na in at least some cases in (early?) masoretic Hebrew exists in words like הַיְבֵשֹׁות, which have a rafe on the letter after the first letter of the noun. The rafe may exist from a time when the dagesh appeared in the yod, which would have demanded a sheva na anyways.</p>\n<p>In short: the late disappearance of the dagesh from the definite article in letters that have a sheva resulted in various opinions and confusion about the proper pronunciation of the sheva today.</p>\n\n\n",

The highest point would be the sky. Wherever one stands on earth seems to him to be the highest point, for when he looks to the horizon it curves downward, making everything approaching him seem to come up toward him. Rather, there's only a central point. A place where everyone turns to.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיינו דאמרי' בספרי הנ\"ל וקמת ועלית וקשה לו ומאי פסקא הלא אפשר שהזקן ממרא וב\"ד יושבים בהר חרמון שמשם יורדים לירושלים ולא עולים אלא מכאן שב\"המק גבוה מכל א\"י שהוא משתיתו של עולם מתחלת יצירה והוא מרכז ונקודה האמצעי שבכדור וא\"כ כל הבאים לשם עולים ולא יורדים כנלע\"ד מ\"מ א\"א לומר כן על מקום אחר או על צפת ויעקב אע\"ה אמר זה שער השמים ואין ב' שערים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This central point is the beit hamikdash and Israel, which is the foundation of the world. It is the central, and by our new definition highest, point because from there is the gateway to heaven (and there aren't two gateways), and provides for the rest of the world. So following the logic previously stated, Israel is physically, and spiritually the highest point on earth.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the difference in pronunciation between ח and the guttural כ\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the difference in pronunciation between ח (khet) and the guttural כ (khaf)? And when do you know which one to use in a word?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>From my experience, in modern Ashkenazi non-Israeli pronunciation they are the same. In Sefardi pronunciation, the chet is produced lower in the throat, whereas the chaf is produced in the back of the mouth.</p>\n<p>An interesting proof that the Sefardi pronunciation may be more true to the historical practice is the following phenomena. When a shoresh has a gutteral in the final position, such as פתח, \"opening\", we find the introduction of a second vowel sound before the gutteral in forms such as the participle, eg פּוֹתֵחַ, <em>pote-ach</em>, \"opens\". This is as opposed to the normal vowelization of the participle, eg כּוֹתֵב <em>kotev</em>, which just has a single \"e\"/\"ei\" sound. This switch however does not occur for shorushim that end in chaf, eg הולך, <em>holech</em>, \"walking\" (ie, it isn't <em>hole-ach</em>.)</p>\n<p>One explanation of this is that the ches sound was produced so low in the throat that it isn't possible to go from a \"sere\", which has the mouth in a horizontal semi-smile, directly to a chet, which has the mouth and throat open vertically, in one step. Verb forms like פָּתַח which have a patach before the chet don't display this phenomena, perhaps because the patach \"ah\" sound has the mouth already open vertically making it easy to transition to a deep-gutteral.</p>\n<p>One potential reason for the cultural difference is that Ashkenazim lived in countries without deep gutterals, making the pronunciation of the original forms uncomfortable, whereas Sefardim lived in Arabic-speaking countries where deep and varied gutterals are very common.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't have the sefer I had on pronunciation any more (can anyone tell me the name for such a sefer?), but here's what I remember:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The kadmonim refer to both ches and ayin as \"גרוני\", gutterals in the back of the throat. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Yetzirah.2.3?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Yetzirah</a> for its list of where different letters are pronounced. See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.23?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban on Parshas Devarim</a> on the verse about the \"עוים\", where he explains how the ayin and ches often interchange (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/miyminimichoel/home/ches-ayin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">something I wrote</a> on this btw). There were Jews in old times who had trouble pronouncing them differently, as comments here from @Harel13 mention.</li>\n<li>Unlike Arab countries, where Arabic has both these sounds (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for</a> their pronunciation - ches is not voiced [hummed], ayin is), European countries generally could not pronounce these gutterals. Jews in those countries had trouble, and ayin drifted into not being pronounced at all.</li>\n<li>Ches was more complicated, because it is unvoiced like an H, countries around Russia can't say an H sound. Ask any Russian speaker about H: the closest they have is their \"X\", pronounced like a chaf: Cheh, cheh, cheh. So Russian and Polish Jews drifted into pronouncing a ches more like a chaf.</li>\n<li>German Jews have a H sound, so ches wasn't such a problem. Up till recently that's how they pronounced it, so that the common spelling of חנוכה in English and German was always \"<em>H</em>anukkah\" till recently. More recently they began to pronounce it more like Polish Jews, and pretty much all Ashkenazim now say an ches like a chaf.</li>\n<li>Note that Yemenites still use the original/Arab pronounciation, in the back of the throat - <em>unlike</em> most Sefardim who say the ches in the soft palate, farther back than the chaf in the hard palate, not as far back as the throat. I have been told that official Israeli protocol was to use Yemenite pronunciation on news stations and the like, till fairly recently; they held it was more accurate.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Firstly, כ is not a guttural letter, but simply a soft letter. \"Guttural\" in the context of Hebrew means pronounced in the throat.</p>\n<p>In Modern Hebrew, they are pronounced the same, like a harsh scratching noise at the back of the mouth.<br/>\nIn the original pronunciation (preserved by many Jews today), כ is pronounced in the same area of the mouth as hard kaf, with air hissed through a narrow opening. ח is pronounced by squeezing the throat muscles and exhaling, which is difficult for many English speakers to replicate.</p>\n<p>When you read Hebrew texts often, you begin to develop a sense for when כ is used and when ח is used. To help you begin developing this sense, כ is used very often in prefixes and suffixes, while ח is only used as part of a <em>shoresh</em> (root word).</p>\n\n\n",

I corrected the student's milra accentuation and said it should be read with mil'eil accentuation. But on examination of the text, I started to doubt myself upon noting the position of the cantillation as shown in these two sources:\n<a href=\"https://www.blueletterbible.org/wlc/gen/2/4/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.blueletterbible.org/wlc/gen/2/4/</a>\nand:\n<a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/cu0101.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/cu0101.htm</a>\nBoth of them seem to suggest that it is milra, but I was convinced that it should be read with mil'eil accentuation, as this very good reader reads it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/mp3/t0102.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mechon-mamre.org/mp3/t0102.mp3</a></p>\n<p>I then looked it up in the Artscroll tikkun kor'im and saw something that is missing from the above two texts:</p>\n<p>In the tikkun, the cantillation note that appears on the extreme left of the last letter (ר) is REPEATED above the second letter (ִי), which is where I expected the syllabic stress to be. The note is a Telisha Ketanah and the repetition of it is a mesorah device used to indicate the correct syllabic stress for several notes that are look-alikes of other notes and it is therefore not easy to distinguish them from their look-alikes visually. In most cases, one of the members of the look-alike pair is a conjunctive note, like this Telisha ketana and the other one is a pausal note, like Telisha gedola. Often, conjunctives lean or curve forwards, while pausal notes are vertical or they lean or curve backwards, but this is only a rule of thumb and it is not universally true.</p>\n<p>For notes that have look-alikes, there is another visual distinction that is employed in the mesorah for notes that have look-alikes to eliminate ambiguity as to which note it is. The practice is to position the note at the far left extremity of the word if it is a conjunctive note or at the far right extremity of the word if it is a pausal note. In both cases, if its position does not coincide with the stressed syllable, it is repeated on the stressed syllable so that it can also perform its function of indicating the correct syllabic stress.</p>\n<p>A frequently occurring example is the pair Kadma and Pashta, but they are an exception to the above positioning rule. Pashta, a pausal note, is always positioned at the extreme left of the word and is repeated, if necessary, on the stressed syllable (See Gen 2:17, second word, and the first word of 2:18.) Many Torah readers, even experienced ones, are unaware of the true reason for the repetition and think of it as a variation of the normal tune of Pashta and they mistakenly read the word with a doubled tune as though it was a word with two notes on it.</p>\n<p>Does anyone disagree with any of the above?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Of the many ideas put forward by the OP, one that I feel is wrong is that stress helper trope marks serve not only to mark stress, but also to distinguish look-alike (or near-look-alike) marks.</p>\n<p>It is true that a word with a <em>pashta</em> stress helper, viewed as a whole word, looks quite different from a word with only a <em>qadma</em>, and thus <em>pashta</em> stress helpers do perhaps, accidentally, help distinguish two usually-same-shaped marks: <em>pashta</em> and <em>qadma</em>. But I could also argue the opposite: a <em>pashta</em> stress helper is easy to confuse with a <em>qadma</em> unless you look forward for the \"real\" <em>pashta</em>, i.e. unless you view the word as a whole. So I could argue that <em>pashta</em> stress helpers in fact make it harder to distinguish two usually-same-shaped marks: <em>pashta</em> and <em>qadma</em>.</p>\n<p>So, in the <em>pashta</em> case, the OP's speculation isn't clearly wrong: arguments could be made either way.</p>\n<p>Where the speculation falls apart is with respect to the other three postpositive accents.</p>\n<p>A <em>telisha qetana</em> stress helper doesn't help distinguish from <em>telisha gedola</em> because editions using stress helpers for one type of <em>telisha</em> will use it for both!</p>\n<p><em>Segol</em> and <em>zarqa</em> have no look-alike or near-look-alike marks, so the only reason for their stress helpers to exist is to mark stress. (There is an ambiguity regarding <em>zarqa</em>-shaped marks in the poetic cantillation system, but I assume we are limiting ourselves to the prose cantillation system here.)</p>\n<p>To be charitable, perhaps I have misunderstood the OP and the speculation was just limited to <em>pashta</em> and <em>telisha qetana</em> stress helpers. In that case, the speculation still doesn't make sense for <em>telisha qetana</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# THE NEW YEAR: Rosh hashanah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why is the first feast of the Jewish 7th month called Rosh Hashanah which means the 'Head of the year', i.e. the New Year, when those words were never used by YHWH in Vayikra (Leviticus) chapter 23? Those words were used by YHWH in Exodus (Sefer Shemot) chapter 12 when YHWH told Moses that this month shall be the first month of the year to you - The words YHWH uses are Rosh hachodesh and Hashanah. So I am curious. If YHWH started the Jewish calendar in the month of Nisan, why do Jews celebrate the New Year in the month of Tishrei? As Far as I can see, the first day of Tishrei is called a memorial of trumpets by YHWH, not the beginning of the year. And what does YHWH mean when HE refers to a memorial of Trumpets?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Exodus.12.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> on Exodus 12:2 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now the purport of the expression, This month shall be unto you the beginning of months, is that Israel is to count this as the first of the months, and from it they are to count all months — second, third, etc., until a year of twelve months is completed — in order that there be through this enumeration a remembrance of the great miracle, [i.e., the exodus from Egypt, which occurred in the first month]. Whenever we will mention the months, the miracle will be remembered. It is for this reason that the months have no individual names in the Torah. Instead, Scripture says: In the third month; And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month … that the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle of the Testimony; And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, etc., and so in all cases. Just as in counting the weekdays we always remember the Sabbath-day since the weekdays have no specific name of their own, but instead are called “one day in the Sabbath,” “the second day in the Sabbath,” as I will explain, so we remember the exodus from Egypt in our counting “the first month,” “the second month,” “the third month,” etc., to our redemption.This order of the counting of the months is not in regard to the years, for the beginning of our years is from Tishri, [the seventh month], as it is written, And the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year (Exodus 34:22), and it is further written, And the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year (Exodus 23:16). If so, when we call the month of Nisan the first of the months and Tishri the seventh, the meaning thereof is “the first [month] to the redemption” and “the seventh month” thereto. This then is the intent of the expression, it shall be the first month to you, meaning that it is not the first in regard to the year but it is the first “to you,” i.e., that it be called “the first” for the purpose of remembering our redemption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why that word? The point is that His Divine Essence, the Ohr Ein Sof, was all that there was. It was <em>out of this</em> that Hashem \"carved out\" or <em>engraved</em> a Chalal, a Vacated Space<sup>1</sup>. This process took place <em>before</em> creation, as this is the order of the words in this passage of Sefer Yetzira. The Zohar says on this (1:15a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הורמנותא דמלכא<br />\n<strong>גליף גלופי</strong><br />\nבטהירו עלאה בוצינא דקרדינותא</p>\n<p>In the beginning of the desire of the King<br />\n<strong>Engraved</strong><br />\nThe Lamp of Darkness, in the Supernal Light</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The later Kabbalists<sup>2</sup> referred to this process of engraving as \"tzimtzum\"<sup>3</sup>, a word that had been used to describe Hashem constricting Himself, so to speak, in many Midrashim in many places e.g. Vayikra Rabbah 29</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מה הקדוש ברוך הוא עושה מניח סנקליטין שלו מלמעלן ויורד <strong>ומצמצם</strong> שכינתו\nביניהם מלמטן</p>\n<p>What does the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He leaves His court above\nand descends and <strong>contracts</strong> His Divine Presence among them below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Shir HaShirim Rabba 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם את עושה לזה של מעלה למטה אני מניח סנקליטון שלי של מעלה ויורד\n<strong>ומצמצם</strong> שכינתי ביניכם למטה</p>\n<p>If you craft below that is like that which is On High, I will abandon\nMy heavenly council and descend and <strong>restrict</strong> My Divine Presence in\nyour midst below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - Note, this is not referring to geographic space, but conceptual space (see R Aryeh Kaplan's 'Sefer Yetzira - In Theory and In Practice' p.14 and the footnote there, which have contributed to this answer; see also 'The Bahir' p.xxiii, citing Shomer Emunim 2:43 and Kalach Pitchei Chochma 24).

Shouldn't it rather be: the man has become like one <strong>from</strong> (as in distinct) us? The reason for my question is that the Hebrew places a kaf in front of the word 'one/echad' which I understand means 'like' and a mem as a suffix for the word ' מִן\" which I understand means 'from'. Therefore, I understand the verse as God saying that the man (adam) has become like one separate from us. Am I understanding this correctly? It makes sense in a way as man was already 'like' God because God said let us make man in our image and likeness. Therefore, eating from the forbidden tree shouldn't in effect have made adam like God?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>thanks for being here and asking questions that help you come closer to the God of Israel.

They base it on the hebrew word היה, which is past tense, so they read it \"behold Adam <em>was</em> like one of Us [and he is no longer]\".</p>\n<p>Generally though, the commentaries interpret the words to mean that Adam has indeed become like God, because he knows good and evil, which animals and other forms of life do not share. E.g. Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה כאחד ממנו  IS BECOME LIKE ONE OF US (or, like the Being who is\nOne, Unique amongst us) — Lo, he is unique among the terrestrial ones,\neven as I am unique among the celestial ones.

In knowing good and evil, which is not so in the\ncase of cattle and beasts (Genesis Rabbah 21:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The phrase כאחד ממנו doesn't translate the way you have proposed. It is literally translated as \"like one from us\", or in more technical logic: \"He is similar to one from the category of those that we count ourselves among\". This category is \"those who know good and evil\".</p>\n<p>If you are quite technical with your understanding of the hebrew language and grammar, you might find <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.3.22.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Ibn Ezra</a> a good read into understanding how this pasuk is working, and it deals with all the words you question.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: there is a tradition that this means we lost our status as being \"similar to Him\", but also a a tradition that we became <em>more</em> similar to Him. The way we resolve that is to realise that both are true. On the one hand, we developed the ability to internally appreciate good and evil, which is a status only shared with Hashem, but on the other hand, having that appreciation of evil in a physical body activates an urge to do evil, and cause him to chase the material rather than the spiritual aims set for Him when God made him in the Divine Image.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - e.g. Sforno, Rabbeinu Bachaye  </sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Refer to the commentaries there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.22?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.3.22.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה כאחד ממנו. הֲרֵי הוּא יָחִיד בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים כְּמוֹ שֶׁאֲנִי יָחִיד בָּעֶלְיוֹנִים, וּמַה הִיא יְחִידוּתוֹ? לָדַעַת טוֹב וָרָע, מַה שֶּׁאֵין כֵּן בִּבְהֵמָה וְחַיָּה</p>\n<p>היה כאחד ממנו  IS BECOME LIKE ONE OF US (or, like the Being who is One, Unique amongst us) — Lo, he is unique among the terrestrial ones, even as I am unique among the celestial ones.

    "content": "# The reason for the evil in the world today\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have read a book by Dr Michael Heiser that stated if you asked this question to a Christian audience, they would say, the fall of Adam in the garden is the cause of evil in the world today. But if you would ask this question to a Jewish person, they would say there were 3 reasons: the garden (where the evil came to man from a spiritual being), the angels choosing daughters of men and creating a mixed race of individuals called the Nephilim,(again spiritual beings involved) and the sin of the tower of Babel. 3 rebellions against Elohim.</p>\n<p>I have also read in many Jewish sites that there is also a belief that we are all born with two inclinations, a good one and an evil one: the yetser hara and yetser tov. Was Adam then created with these two, or did the yetser hara form after he ate the fruit of the forbidden tree? And is it rather this that is the reason for this much evil in the world today.</p>\n<p>I guess the question is; is the evil human or is the evil supernatural?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The sages teach that there are two kinds of evil inclinations - one that is spiritual, and was created by G-d before the sin of Adam, and one that stems from the physical body, as a result of the sin of Adam.</p>\n<p>The Ben Yehoyada brings this idea in various places in his commentary on the Talmud, and explains (In his commentary on Arachin 8b) that it is for this reason that two goats are brought on the day of atonement - one for G-d, and the other goes to Azazel - each goat representing one of these two evils.</p>\n<p>However, the sages teach (Shabbos 146b) that when the Torah was given to the Jewish people, the evil that came from the sin of Adam left them, and although it returned as a result of the sin of the golden calf, it never fully returned to them.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Talmud says (Sanhedrin 64a) that the sages living at the time of the second Holy Temple managed to get rid of the inclination towards idolatry.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The reason there is evil in the world is so that the choice of doing good is meaningful. If a person were not given the opportunity to do bad, and decline it and do something good instead, then that good is forced, to some degree. Either way, the reward for doing that good is lessened, and this is against Hashem's will. So in order that man should truly become the owner and master of his own good, Hashem made in him a pull towards both evil and good (see Derech Hashem 1:3:1).</p>\n<p>This is really a pull towards the physical vs a pull towards the spiritual, as Ramchal writes (ibid 1:2:3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And behold that any true perfection is surely His existence, may He be\nblessed; and any deficiency is only the absence of His goodness, may\nHe be blessed, and the hiding of His face. So it comes out that the\nshining of His face, may He be blessed, and His closeness are the root\nand the cause of all perfection that will be; and the hiding of His\nface is the root and the cause of all the deficiency - such that\naccording to the measure of the hiding, is the measure of the\ndeficiency that results from it. Therefore when this creature - that\nstands evenly between the perfections and the deficiencies that are\noutgrowths of the shining and the hiding - strengthens itself with\nperfections and acquires them for itself on its own; behold, it\nattaches [itself] to Him, may He be blessed, who is their root and\ntheir source. And according to that which it increases perfection, so\ndoes it increase in attachment to Him; until when it reaches the end\nof the acquisition of perfection, behold it reaches the end of\nattachment and cleaving to Him, may He be blessed. So it benefits from\nHis good and perfects itself in Him and becomes, itself, the owner of\nits good and its perfection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This equal pull towards both directions was changed greatly when Adam and Eve ate the fruit. Before, they just had a distracting pull towards the material, which is the natural state for a living physical creature. However, once they ate from the fruit, that pull towards the material became more than a temptation, it became personal, and internal, and this caused mankind to actually desire things that were not simply material, but <em>forbidden</em> (1:3:8):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With his sin, however, deficiencies were added; and they grew in the\nessence of man and in all of the entire creation. Moreover the redress\nbecame more difficult than before. The explanation of this is that\nsurely at the beginning it was easy for [man] to go away from the\ndeficiency planted in him and to acquire perfection. For the Supreme\nWisdom set up the things like this according to the traits of good and\nfairness. And since man was not the cause of the evil and the\ndeficiency within him - but it was rather planted in him in his\ncreation - when he removed himself from the evil and turned to the\ngood, he was surely immediately able to go away from deficiency and\nacquire perfection. However with his sin - since it was through him\nthat perfection became more hidden than it was and the deficiencies\ngrew, and he was the one that caused evil to himself - it would no\nlonger be as easy for him to return and to go away from deficiency and\nacquire perfection as it was at the time that he was not the cause of\nhis deficiency, but was rather [just] created like that from his\nbeginning, as I have written. All the more so [would it be harder], as\nthe striving required of him now to reach perfection would perforce be\ndoubled: For he would first need that man and the world return to the\ncondition that existed at the beginning before the sin; and then\nafterwards to rise above that condition to a condition of perfection\nto which it was fit for man to rise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, Adam and Eve developed a great pleasure in doing good and evil, and passed this on to their children. The goal of the children now is to conquer this, so that they refrain from doing evil, even if it is pleasureable and tempting, and thereby fix this pollution, and cleanse it so that mankind can be indeed unique in this world - made in the Image of Hashem.</p>\n<p>This lowly state could have been climbed out of by every nation right up until the Tower of Bavel (see Derech Hashem 2:2), and the door was finally sealed when the Torah was given. At that point it became clear that only Abraham's children were going to be able to take up the mantle of fulfilling God's will of acquiring spiritual perfection and raising the world up with them, on a national level. Nations could not elevate themselves as a whole to the stature of man before the sin, but individuals in those nations could by attaching to the Torah through the people of Israel.</p>\n<p>Until Israel finishes the job, there will continue to be this very great darkness in the world, Hashem's face hidden, and therefore a world where it seems like evil is a real force that is always gaining the upper hand.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If you asked Maimonides he would tell you that what we perceive as evil has a good point to it. For example, hurricanes cleanse the earth.[1]</p>\n<p>Maimonides says that evil is the result of one of three things: people harm themselves, harm others, or natural laws, such as a hurricane that may kill people who are nearby but it cleanse the earth. Thus, God is not the source of evil. God only does good.</p>\n<p>Earthquakes, volcanoes, lightning, and inundations are all the result of the operation of the laws of nature. A lion killing a zebra is not evil, it is nature. The lion lives by hunting its prey. God did not make the world only for zebras.</p>\n<p>In essence, Maimonides' point is that all creation is good. We simply do not understand it well enough.</p>\n<p>As for the yetser hare. I do not think it exists. It is a metaphore.</p>\n<p>[1] See his discussion on Job.</p>\n\n\n",

Isaac, for instance, married at the age of 40. Given the societal norms and the cultural backdrop of those times:</p>\n<p>Is there any indication or evidence in traditional sources that figures like Isaac abstained from intimate relations until they were officially married?

In Genesis, the word adam is used until the woman is brought to him and then he calls her 'Ishah' and refers to himself as 'Ish'. In Psalm 49;2 it refers to the sons of Adam and the sons of Ish. Who would then be the sons of Ish? Why this distinction? And in Genesis 18;16 the angels that visited Abraham are referred to as enosh in this verse.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Torah generally uses 4 names for mankind, and <em>Adam</em> is the highest. There are 3 others that are gradually lower in stature (and therefore less of a compliment!):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ish</em></li>\n<li><em>Gever</em></li>\n<li><em>Enosh</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe explains that <em>Adam</em> is the highest (it is based on the fact that it is similar to the hebrew word \"<em>adame</em>\" which means \"similar to [God]\" and sometimes represents mankind in relation to his or her intellect), whereas <em>Ish</em> is lower (and conotes the emotions). Still, these two terms are lofty terms referring to mankind as a lofty entity in or even the pinnacle of creation.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn explains that <em>gever</em> means a man who is accomplishing his tasks, a man of strength and mastery, but not in a spiritual sense, so this term is not a very lofty one. An <em>enosh</em> literally just means \"mortal\", someone whose biggest compliment is that they are alive... otherwise they are not contributing very much.</p>\n<p>He also explains that <em>Adam</em> is indeed the pinncale of creation, in that he can relate to God better than angels, even the most lofty of angels, who - in their raw abstract intellects - are unable to conceive of a dwelling place for Hashem in a time bound, space bound, physical reality. Only <em>Adam</em> is able to conceive of this and make it happen.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Zohar (III, 48a) explains that <em>Adam</em> represents the complete human being, male and female (so it can be used to describe man before Hashem split them, or a married couple who have achieved true intimacy). Once they are split apart, they are referred to as <em>Ish</em> and <em>Isha</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I will see if I can find an answer as to why the angels are called <em>enosh.</em> That (and the rest) is a great question! Maybe it's because they were being described how they were meant to look - like vagabonds.</p>\n\n\n",

It should have said: A lament of Dovid? Rabbi Shimon ben Avishalom said a parable: To what is this similar? (It is similar) to a person about whom a promissory note was issued stating that he must repay a debt to the lender. Before he repaid it, he was despondent, worried how he will manage to repay the debt. After he repaid it, he was glad. So too was the case with Dovid. When the Holy One, Blessed be He, told him, (through Nosson the prophet, after the incident with BasSheva), “Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your house” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.12.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Samuel 12:11</a>), Dovid was despondent. He said: Perhaps it will be a slave or a mamzer (who will rise up in my house, a person of such lowly status,) who will have no pity on me. But once Dovid saw that it was Avshalom (i.e. that he was the one through whom the prophecy was to be fulfilled,) he rejoiced, (as he was certain that Absalom would show him mercy.) Therefore, it is called a psalm. (i.e. And not a lament, thanking G-d for punishing him in the least severe manner possible.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is this Jewish Neoplatonic idea heresy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Context:</strong><br />\nI've noticed before that whenever I post anything about Neoplatonism in a Jewish context, such posts usually tend to get <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/136747/is-ruach-ha-kodesh-eternal-or-does-it-have-a-timespan-is-it-even-the-first-perf\">downvoted to oblivion</a>, and in general, such views are not very well received among most frum Jewish people that I've talked to.</p>\n<p>However, it is well known that Neoplatonism had a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism#:%7E:text=Jewish%20thought,-Main%20article%3A%20Jewish&text=In%20the%20Middle%20Ages%2C%20neoplatonist,light%20of%20their%20own%20monotheism.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">strong influence on Kabbalah</a> and there were many Jewish philosophers who were Neoplatonists (e.g. Avicebron or Isaac Israeli ben Solomon). Of course, I think that for example, Avicebron's Neoplatonism is nonsensical (e.g. he believed that G-d, blessed be He, eternally and \"unconsciously\" emanates His own will through which He creates through many layers of emanation) - \"Neoplatonism\" is not a uniform philosophy and there are many differing views that all get grouped under the term \"Neoplatonism\".</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Formal question:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Is there anything heretical in Neoplatonic views? To be more specific, the idea that seems to get me the most flack is:</strong> that G-d, blessed be He, can only directly produce one effect/creation which is necessarily the most perfect creation through which He creates everything else (the so-called \"rule of one\", which really comes from Islamic Neoplatonism (<a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/orie/48/1-2/article-p123_5.xml?language=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">qāʿidat al-wāḥid</a>) <strong>NOTE</strong>: These ideas also have a parallel in Jewish thought - refer to Jewish Neoplatonism - Being above Being and divine emanation in Solomon ibn Gabirol and Isaac Israeli (2006, Cambridge University Press)). Are these ideas heretical?</p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION:</strong></p>\n<p>G-d, blessed be He, can only directly produce one only creation which is necessarily the most perfect creation through which He creates everything else. Hence, G-d, blessed be He, does not directly create a tree. He is eternally creating the most perfect creation and through this most perfect creation, He directs the creation of trees.</p>\n<p>Consider the following:</p>\n<p>G-d<br />\n↓  eternally creates most perfect creation<br />\nFirst Intellect (an intelligent and willful most perfect first creation)<br />\n↓  from this point on, it mimics G-d to create another singular creation<br />\nUniversal Soul<br />\n↓  (at this point, things can at least theoretically branch out according to some views, so the chain is no longer singularly linear)\n......</p>\n<p>So there is a chain of creation just like this. I provided some explanation for why this is the case in my link above where I talk about getting downvoted to oblivion.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I found a more direct answer to this in Derech Mitzvotecha Haamanut Elokut 5 (Mahadura Batra)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The principle that only oneness can come into being from oneness is true regarding natural beings that have no choice for their actions, but act according to the nature created in them. So something which only has one nature can only produce one result [or a result of oneness]... Hashem may He be blessed, on the other hand is truly One and acts willfully and with choice, so even though He is simple Oneness, He can produce many different types of influence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He explains that Hashem's Oneness does not define Him. His Oneness is not a limiting property or something that separates Him, but rather He is not defined in any given way and nothing is separate from Him. Based on Maharal in Gevurot Hashem</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>First</strong> there are different types and levels of \"heresy\". For example אפיקורס usually has one meaning (see סנהדרדין י:א) and the word מין might have another meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, the obvious problem with your statement is whether you can limit what Hashem can do. It might be one thing to say that הקדוש ברוך הוא \"decided\" to create a creation that is somewhat perfect and from that to create creation.</p>\n<p>You could argue a number of commentaries say exactly this for creation (or at least most things). See Hiyuli and Ramban Genesis 1:1. Nevertheless, I am not necessarily convinced this is a clear proof, since he considers a Spiritual substrate and Physical substrate being created - it is also unclear if these are \"perfect\" or rather hardly \"physical\" (which you can argue are more \"perfect\" or \"one\").</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your response (I'd like to focus on):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perfection is identical to Him, all-knowing is identical to Him, etc. and they're all identical to each other, with distinctions being mainly formal/virtual. Hence, if He has free will, which He does, His free will necessarily must also be perfect. Hence, He cannot actualize anything other than the most perfect creation because it would be a contradiction.</p>\n<p>If He had multiple choices, then either a) That would introduce composition within His essence, and hence, contingency, thus making Him not necessary existence and making something else be that (G-d forbid). or b) That would imply brute contingency which would contradict the principle of sufficient reason. Hence, He only makes one creation, and this creation is eternal and most perfect contingent creation</p>\n<p>This is not a limitation of power. Think of it this way: What would it mean that G-d, blessed be He, just arbitrary and randomly chooses to create whatever? If He can just bring imperfection when He could bring perfection, then how would in Jewish views He be all-good?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wouldn't say that Hashem and his perfection are identical exactly, more like that we describe Hashem as perfect, but that attribution is actually limiting and therefore incorrect. I similarly wonder if \"free-choice\" in regard to Hashem is even close to a correct attribution.</p>\n<p>Assuming there is some \"choice\" (as we envision it) - out of pure logic, his unlimited ability would allow him to create everything and anything. Ie: he cannot be limited because then there is no true free-choice and similarly, no true unlimited ability. It is standard Jewish thought to understand that Hashem could do everything and uses Angels and intermediaries for our benefit and for us to learn from; not because he is limited in some way.</p>\n<p>Also what is created is here. Is it perfect or imperfect. According to you he created a perfect creation first, that created an imperfect one for us? If he is unlimited why can't he create a creation that must create something with no imperfections, or just create our universe perfect directly? Is that impossible? On the other hand, if this world is perfect there is no issue.</p>\n<p>In Judaism there is a general idea that Hashem had a purpose for creation, and created the most perfect creation for that specific purpose. Ie: <strong>The purpose was determinative of what was created more then Hashem's essence as you are stating</strong>. Similarly the \"imperfections\" can serve that ultimate purpose, and are usually explained as only potentially there (ie: it is part of the system), and are actualized by man's free choice. **This is part of the mechanics and purpose of the world and therefore, part of the perfect creation. **</p>\n<p>The heresy, if it exists, likely lies in the area where you are requiring this to be the only thing Hashem could create. That sounds quite problematic. Why do you need that component? I don't see any reason why that would be necessary. Similarly, <strong>the anthropomorphic way you are describing Hashem as being perfect or how he chooses is not obvious to me in Judaism</strong>, but once again not obvious to me that it is heresy.</p>\n<p>For example: Why don't you state that this \"perfect\" creation served the purpose of creation for example, even if it means so we can understand his power, uniqueness and perfection? I prefer the Jewish version personally.</p>\n<p>I am not an expert at heresy, it is possibly not heresy, but I think that your idea is not standard Jewish thinking. At least the way phrased here. Obvious heresy are things like: Multiple deities, The Torah not being given by Hashem etc....</p>\n<p>I do suggest breaking the argument into components and re-asking it as separate questions if you want to know whether any component might be heresy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I can't tell you if it is heretical, but I can give you some information from the chassidic approach that might help you determine how to proceed with the question, and what is needed to find the answer.</p>\n<p>The chassidic teachings record that the great Torah leaders of each generation passed on an esoteric tradition. There are many notable events in this tradition but the key ones are Adam Harishon received the secrets of creation from an angel, the Avot were in the chain that received that and added more, then Moshe was taught where it all is in the Torah when he received it at Sinai, and R Shimon Bar Yochai completed it, seeing with a \"clear lens\" and becoming the final and greatest teacher of the full secrets of the Torah.</p>\n<p>After he passed, the knowledge went underground and was only passed among the selected few. We have works from the Geonim and the chassidic masters teach us that they recorded their knowledge in very encrypted form in these works. The subsequent generations enclothed the teachings in <em>philosophy</em>.</p>\n<p>This is where I am getting to. The philosophical teachings we have, such as Maimonides, according to the chassidic view, contain within them, <em>secretly</em>, the esoteric teachings. The Rambam \"hid and scattered the teachings in pieces throughout his writing\", in the form of Aristotelian philosophy, and the mystical tradition he was working from might have even been partial. Many great chassidic Rebbeim, including from Chabad and Ishbitz, who were all great and holy Kabbalists, spilled a lot of ink showing how Rambam's teachings contain these ideas.</p>\n<p>R Gershon Henoch writes in his introduction to Beit Yaacov (from chapter 15 there are a few chapters on showing Kabbalah in Rambam) that someone trying to understand the secrets of the Torah from philosophy is akin to someone trying to work backwards from the effect to the cause; a task that is impossible to do completely, if even partially (and uses derivation from argument, which is the exact opposite of <em>Kabbalah</em>, I.e. <em>received</em> wisdom). In the case of philosophy, it's even harder because philosophy, especially the type of Grecian rational philosophies we are talking about, aren't able and aren't even trying to convey anything of the superrational, which is of course where you need to go when you are discussing things that come <em>before</em> intellect! Thus, the only way to learn the secrets of the Torah today is to do so through the teachings of the Zohar, which is the work of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai who as we said is the greatest and final teacher of the complete mysteries of Torah. The Zohar is the cause, rather than one of the \"effects\", going by the above analogy.</p>\n<p>R Henoch also points out that the mysteries of creation that are hidden in the teachings of philosophy are muddled with non authentic traditions. In today's day when we have the Zohar and hundreds of works based on it, elucidating the inheritance of Yaacov: the secrets of the Torah, by great holy Chachamim and Rebbeim, including the Arizal, and all the Chassidic Rebbes and great Kabbalists of the last 500 years, there are only very few who seriously still try to unpack the esoteric teachings of the Kabbalah from the enigmatic works of the period when Kabbalah was \"underground\", including the philosophical works. Still fewer who would allow it, let alone recommend it.</p>\n<p>So, according to this traditional approach I have brought, the recommendation would be that if you want to understand the secrets of the Divine, you should <em>start</em> with authentic teachings based on the Zohar, and nowadays there are many options and styles that might suit you, if you are diligent in your search (you said the Neoplatonic ideas help you understand these things and speak to you, which might imply that you've not had such an experience studying the esoteric from traditional Zoharic sources).</p>\n<p>It would be very nice if a very learned person will come and just answer your question with a yes/no and neat explanation but I think from what I've laid out here, it seems that there are a number of barriers that might prevent that happening, including the point that rational philosophies are often <em>just not enough and not fully capable of</em> containing complete Divine truths, as well as being a very controversial and dangerous way to approach gaining this Divine knowledge in a \"clear lens\" way. Philosophy is a tainted and muddled, inadequate esoteric source, and is at best a clothing of encoded information about Divine truth and therefore yes, there are many barriers that may make this question \"off topic\" in the traditional approach :) As I said, a lot of writing has been written on the Rambam's ways of enclothing Divine esoteric wisdom in philosophy, it might be of interest to you to follow that up, but it is unlikely you'll find the same amount and the same calibre of work done on the Neoplatonic works. You've citied so far only contemporary scholars in a single academic work making that claim. Surely their work would cite some traditional sources who spoke about the Neoplatonic theory? If so, you should go and learn those, of course! Or cite them in the question for us. If there aren't any, then all the more you should consider the recommendations I am laying out here.</p>\n<p>I recommend reading his whole introduction to Beit Yaacov, but especially chapters 13 onwards for a few chapters. It is in his work Sha'ar HaEmuna VeYesod HaChassidut, and can be found in English on sefaria. Hatzlacha.</p>\n\n\n",

However, today, when all Kohanim are accustomed to covering their faces with a tallit, a defect on one’s face or hands does not prevent a Kohen from reciting the blessing. Nevertheless, even today, if the Kohen has a noticeable deformity on his leg, he should not ascend the duchan to bless the people, for it might distract the minds of the listeners. However, if he is a permanent resident of the community, such that his defect no longer makes people curious, he may ascend to bless the nation, for it most likely will not distract the listeners (Shulchan Aruch 128:30 and 31).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the Kohen's hand position during birkat Kohanim is supposed to symbolize the keruvim of the aron and Hashem's word emanating from between the keruvim.

    "content": "# Reconiciling Statements Rav Kook made about other Religions\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The introduction to the book \"Abraham Isaac Kook - The Lights of Penitence, Lights of Holiness, The Moral Principles, Essays, Letters, and Poems\", states that Rav Kook was positive toward other religions, and includes direct quotes in support of this. These include:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must clarify the common elements of all religion, according to the degree of their development, and not be afraid of the customary disdain and deep hostility that lurks in the soul against everything alien (<em>Igrot Harayah</em>, Vol. I, Agudah Lehotzoat Sifre Harayah Kook, Jerusalem, 1943, Letter 194)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The brotherly love of Esau and Jacob [meaning Judaism and Edom], of Isaac and Ishmael [Judaism and Islam], will reise above the confusions fostered by the evil emanating from our creaturely character; it will rise above them and turn them to light and compassion without end (<em>Igrot</em>, Vol. II, Letter 355)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, his book Orot says something very different as regards idolatry, and especially Christianity. I unfortunately do not have a direct quote, as it was being read to me and translated real-time from Hebrew, so I am working from a combination of memory and my hastily written notes, but I recall quotes that drastically attacked Christianity, calling it \"worse than the worst idolatry\", \"a spiritual blight upon the world\", and other similar statements about how it will be destroyed and come to an end. The section of the book also spoke negatively of other religions, but held Christianity especially in contempt.</p>\n<p>I struggle to reconcile the above quotes with such statements about Christianity. Let us put aside which of the two views is \"correct\" for the moment, as that is not my question. Were either set of quotations taken out of context/translated improperly? Was Rav Kook a believer in bringing together most religions but held disdain for Christianity in particular (I will note that it was not mentioned above, though Edom could mean Christianity it is unclear)? Were they written at different times in his life and reflect a changing opinion? Or is there some other way in which these disparate statements may be reconciled?</p>\n\n\n",

There are two main opinions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>THe opinion of Rabbeinu Tam, who states it is 72 minutes after sunset (what we consider sunset)</li>\n<li>and the opinion of the Gr\"a, Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna, who states it is 13 minutes and 30 seconds after sunset.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, my question is like this:</p>\n<p>It is obvious from the words of Rabbeinu Tam (Berachos Daf 2a Tosafos D\"H Mai'aimasai) that they (i.e. the people during the times of the Rishonim) recited Krias Shema after Plag Hamincha. This means they prayed at some point after 75 minutes before Rabbeinu Tam's tzeis [1], meaning that the prayed sometime after 5:57 PM.</p>\n<p>Now, Rash\"i says (Berachos Daf 2a D\"H Ad Sof) that the people prayed before tzeis. This fits with both shitos (i.e. Rabbeinu Tam and Gr\"a), because if he held like the Gr\"a they davened sometime before 6:13 and a half, and if he held like Rabbeinu Tam they davened sometime before 7:12. This fits with what we said earlier that they for sure davened after 5:57.</p>\n<p>Now, the R\"i (Berachos Daf 2a Tosafos D\"H Mai'aimasai) states that they prayed after the start of Bein HaShmashos [2] and before Tzeis. This cannot fit with both the Gr\"a (for whom the time period would be 6:00 - 6:13:30) and Rabbeinu Tam (for whom it would be 6:58:30 - 7:12).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now, we cannot prove whom Rashi held like, however we can assume that the R\"i held like his Rebbi Rabbeinu Tam, and thus thought that Bein HaShmashos started at 6:58:30. Therefore, the people davened after 6:58, and yet Rashi still states that it is before Tzeis Hakokhavim, therefore seeming to be a proof that Rashi holds like Rabbeinu Tam and not like the Gr\"a.</p>\n<p>However, it is not a complete proof because it could be that R\"i disagrees with Rabbeinu Tam.</p>\n<p>Thus, my question is as follows:</p>\n<h1>Do either Rash\"i or R\"i either hold like Rabbeinu Tam?</h1>\n<p>Either way, please back up your answer with sources...</p>\n<hr />\n<p>1 It could be that they prayed even earlier if we assume that a sha'ah zemania is calculated from alos until tzeis, but for the purposes of simplicity I will assume from neitz till shekia.</p>\n<p>2 He says that they said Shema acc to R' Eliezer in the Braisa on Berachos 2b, who says from Bein HaShmashos</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is not an issue just of the Gra.

Could someone explain this principle to me?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the gemara chullin (108A), Rav says that if a משהו - a minimal piece of something forbidden to eat, falls into a pot with numerous whole pieces of food (חתיכות) that are the same type of food (מיו במינו), even though it just touched one piece, everything in the pot is forbidden. This is in accordance with Rebbi Yehuda who hold one item which is forbidden mixed with other items of the same type cannot be nullified and everything is forbidden.</p>\n<p>The Shach and Taz argue about the next step in the same case, when a piece of food from the pot (explained above) which itself became forbidden from one piece that touched a piece within it, now a random piece from the pot, extracted from the pot and fell into another pot of the exact same scenario - i.e. it touched one piece in the pot when everything of the pot is the same type. This is תרי משהו, loosely translated as '2 somethings', meaning a double case of משהו.</p>\n<p>The Taz is of the opinion that the 2nd pot is permitted, however this is on condition that the piece of food that was touched was removed from the pot, and that there is 60 times the amount of permissible food in the pot more than the forbidden, otherwise everything in the 2nd is forbidden.   The Chazon Ish explains this that the piece which was touched only becomes חתיכה של נבילה with regards to itself, but not regards to the other pieces, and that's why 60 times permissible amount would permit the rest of the pieces in the pot.</p>\n<p>The Shach is of the opinion in the scenario described, the rest of the pieces in the pot are permitted even without removing the infected piece as long as there is 60 times of permissible pieces more than forbidden which will in effect nullify the forbidden. The understanding is that the infected piece is not considered חתיכה של נבילה , rather as as an item that something else (כח אחר) was merely mixed into it, and when that piece is mixed with other pieces in the pot its considered of a different type than the other pieces (מין בשאינו מינו), and suffices with  בטל בששים.</p>\n<p>There is a case which exemplifies this argument very well regarding חמץ בפסח which is not nullified when mixed with its own type or a different type. According the Shach, in a scenario when there was a double משהו like described earlier, when that משהו  was חמץ, since the infected piece is considered מין בשאינו מינו, nothing can permit the entire pot/mixture. But according to the Taz, the infected piece is considered חתיכה של נבילה and the reason why the other pieces are permitted has nothing to do with מין במינו or not, rather its a leniency in חתיכה של נבילה, therefor regarding חמץ  it would also be permitted with ששים של היתר כנגדו.</p>\n\n\n",

They believe\nthat each of the five fingers has been assigned a task corresponding\nto one of our five senses, which between them account for most of\nman’s activities. The powers of the soul [invisible life-force, Ed.]\nare revealed by means of these five fingers. <strong>The first finger is meant\nto clean out the mouth, i.e. it corresponds to the sense of taste. The\nsecond one which is used in the nostrils corresponds to the sense of\nsmell. The third one is used to touch things, i.e. to identify objects\nand people by means of the sense of touch. The fourth finger is\ndesigned to clean one’s eyes; in other words it corresponds to the\nsense of sight, whereas the fifth finger is designed to clean one’s\nears, i.e. it corresponds to the sense of hearing.</strong> According to this\ntheory G’d created man with five different senses and provided each of\nthese senses with a specific outlet, i.e. one of his fingers. This is\nall part of the concept of the completeness of nature, i.e. a world in\nwhich everything has been assigned a specific function. We observe\nthat each one of the five fingers performs its functions almost\nautomatically, as if it were simply a reflex movement giving\nexpression to the directives issuing from the respective senses.\nBlessed be the Lord, Creator, who has created man using so much\nintelligence in doing so (compare Berachot 60).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the only source I could find and he even states that this is a claim by \"the scientists\", so not necessarily a traditional source, but he seems to like it and go with it, based on his Torah belief that everything in creation reflects Hashem's wisdom, and Hashem created everything with meaning and purpose.</p>\n\n\n",

There's some evidence that mules were used in ancient times both as mounts for important people and as war steeds and even chariot-animals. See <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4013980/#:%7E:text=The%20mule%20is,by%20the%20troops.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for example. According to the article in the link, the advantage of the ancient mule was that it could sometimes be bred to be significantly taller (and thus, more prominent and imposing) than the average horse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...There is also speculation, however, that the Hittites used mules earlier than the Third Century as riding animals for war leaders and standard bearers [...]. This was because the hybrid vigour of the ass-horse cross resulted in animals that at 14 hands high (142 cm) were possibly more than one hand (10 cm) taller than the local horse and therefore generals and standard bearers could be more easily seen by the troops.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another advantage was <a href=\"https://brill.com/display/book/9789004411722/BP000018.xml#:%7E:text=Mules%20would%20have,fit%20for%20royalty.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">stated</a> by Virginia Miller:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Mules would have been a better choice for this battle as their dietary needs are easier to meet, and they are more surefooted than horses on uneven terrain. The terrain was known to be difficult as it is stated that the forest claimed more lives than the sword did (18:8). It might also be said that Auld’s observation that the princes fled from Amnon’s assassination on mules re-enforces the idea that mules were thought to be special animals fit for royalty.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, given that Avshalom made a chariot for a royal procession seems to show that the chariot was not a key component of the Israelite military. His chariot may have been more clunkier and not as streamlined as a war chariot.</p>\n<p>More symbolically, Rabbi Eliezer Kashtiel suggested in <a href=\"https://www.hatanakh.com/node/53014\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this class</a> [in Hebrew] that the mule, called 'pered' in Hebrew, symbolizes the split of the kingdom (pirud - פירוד) caused by Avshalom.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In I Melachim 1:33 David commands that Shlomo ride to be anointed on “the mule which is mine”, in response to Adoniyahu claiming the kingship for himself. Evidently, the mule was deemed as fitting for royalty as the horse.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Abarbenel states that horses symbolize war, whereas the mule represents peace. Thus Shlomo was ridden on a mule to symbolize a peaceful reign, while Adoniyahu rode on horseback (ibid 1:5).</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah cycle still starts with Bereishit each year on Simchat Torah, but almost every Shabbat morning aliyah is shortened (weekdays, festivals and roshei hadashim are unaffected). The weeks that they fall on match the standard parsha expected for either Eretz Yisrael or for the diaspora, \"doubling\" the weekly parsha as needed according to the calendar except it is often not a real doubling as you will see.</p>\n<p>If one is trying to match it up to the conventional breaks marked in a Chumash, on the first year of the cycle, it will start at the beginning of the parsha, but Cohen will end sooner, Levi will start shifted forward, etc. until you get to shvee/maftir at roughly the 1/3 point.  The new stopping points are standardized and can be found in a luach intended for a Conservative synagogue.  They usually fall on what would be a paragraph break in English or a similar conceptual ending (e.g. \"Ani Hashem\" or similar).  <a href=\"https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19861990/eisenberg_triennial.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This file</a> lists all the breaks in detail if you want to study them and see if there are any errors in my description.</p>\n<p>For the second year of the cycle, the reading and Cohen Aliyah will start at the 1/3 point where it had ended one year before and go to the roughly 2/3 point.  For the third year, it will start at 2/3 and go to the end, with maftir then being the same as the traditional one.</p>\n<p>It is often said that the entire Torah gets read out-of-order over the course of three years with this system, but that is not strictly true.  Because the calendar often causes us to combine certain parshiot (e.g Mattot and Masei), there will usually be at least one \"second parsha\" that does not get read during the three year cycle.</p>\n<p>I do not have a source of how the Conservative movement reasoned that this was an acceptable system to use, but I believe its benefits are purely to accommodate the Torah reader and the congregants.  You will often find the Torah reader moving at a slower pace in a Conservative synagogue because there are simply 2/3 fewer syllables to say on any given week. This is easier to speak correctly out loud than the rapid style that I have seen in many Orthodox synagogues, and it is also easier for the congregation to follow, who may have a lower level of Hebrew-reading ability, having learned it as children after public school rather than in a Orthodox day school setting. The elapsed time of the Torah reading may be slightly less and that may accommodate impatient congregants too, but I find that the total elapsed time does not really seem that different, given the adjusted reading rate and the time that it takes for other aspects of an aliyah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.hebcal.com/sedrot/</a></p>\n<p>Scroll down to terrenial.<br />\nYou can download the text file and see how it works.</p>\n\n\n",

The commentaries seem silent regarding this question too, suggesting the same.</p>\n<p><strong>However,</strong> see the commentary from <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=24459&rid=5358\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חיל המלך on Haflaah, Shvuos, 6:18</a>. It's not a super tough read, so I suggest checking it out yourself, but I'll write out my cursory read just in case it helps:</p>\n<p>The Rambam over there sets the precedent that in a case where one violated a <em>shvuas bitui</em> (promise dictating behavior in the future) and then asked for release from the vow from a court, that would be effective retroactively. The חיל המלך brings out two relevant points to this question. First, the Rambam believes that <strong>even in a case where the original vow can no longer incur a penalty, such as if someone promised not to eat a specific loaf of bread, ate the whole thing, and then asked for release from a court, that release is effective.</strong> That seems a lot like our case, where the woman can no longer incur a penalty anyways because of her husband's cancellation.</p>\n<p>The second point he makes is that this appears to <strong>only apply if the judgement would actually be carried out. Therefore, nowadays, since penalties of lashes and sacrifices would not actually be applied, this is not effective.</strong> He ends off by saying that we should do more research on the opinion of the Rambam on this final matter.</p>\n<p>If you want to do more research, I'd check out the gemarah he quotes, then look for נר משפט on that page. If that doesn't make it into Shulchan Aruch because it discusses sacrifices, Likkutei Halachos from the Chofetz Chaim probably does rule on it.</p>\n\n\n",

Does this mean that his righteousness will be considered on our behalf, so that we who have not merited deliverance will still receive it?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous shoot, and he shall reign as king and prosper, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called, The LORD is our righteousness.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-Jeremiah 23:5-6 JPS 1917</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"his name that he shall be called He will then be called ‘the Lord is our righteousness’ because our righteousness is the Lord, as it says “…O God of my righteousness…” (Tehillim 4:2) meaning that my righteousness will come from God – just as He exists so too Israel will be righteous and saved by God. This prophecy is repeated further on in 33:15, with some changes. It says ‘I will cause to grow for David a plant of righteousness’ but does not mention ‘and he shall reign a king and prosper.’ There it is written ‘In those days, Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell securely and this is the name that He shall call it, the Lord is our righteousness.’ This is because there are two manners of redemption. If it comes through our merit ‘I will hurry it,’ if it is not through our merit ‘in its time’ (see Isaiah 60:22 and gem. Sanhedrin 98a). It further says there in the gemara: if it is through our merit ‘and behold with the clouds (ananei) of the heaven, one like a man was coming’ (Daniel 7:13) and if not ‘humble (ani), and riding a donkey.’ (Zechariah 9:9) Here in chapter 23 the prophet is speaking about redemption that comes through merit, which is why it says ‘I will set up of David a righteous shoot,’ meaning that he will be righteous through his merit. In chapter 33 the prophet is speaking about redemption which comes not through our merit, which is why it says ‘In those days and in that time I will cause to grow for David a plant of righteousness,’ because the supernal righteousness will not look at the acts of righteousness and merit, but rather will act out of generous kindness and through an arousal from above, as I explained in Yeshayahu 29. Therefore it does not say ‘I will set up of David,’ but rather ‘I will cause to grow for David,’ because it will be a new growth. This is not the case for redemption brought on through merit, there it says ‘I will set up’ because the growth will exist already through the merit of his actions and God will simply lift it up from its fallen state. Further in chapter 33 the prophet adds ‘In those days and in that time’ because if it is not through merit we will have to wait until the appointed time. This is not the case here in chapter 23, it does not say ‘in that time’ because ‘I will hurry it.’ So too it does not say in chapter 33 ‘and he shall reign a king and prosper’ because\nif it is not through merit then he will not reign right away, but rather he will be ‘humble, and riding a donkey.’ Further, it doesn’t say there ‘and Israel shall dwell safely’ because if we do not merit the tribes will not be gathered in right away, rather only Yehudah and Jerusalem will be saved. The ingathering will be delayed until Jerusalem is rebuilt first. It does not say in chapter 33 ‘and this is its name’ in reference to Jerusalem because it will not have this name already due to our lack of merit, ‘this is the name that He shall call it’ Jerusalem from now forward. But here in chapter 23 where it describes redemption through our merit it says ‘and this is his name’ because he will have already acquired this name through his merit.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.23.6?lang=bi&with=Commentary\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.23.6?lang=bi&with=Commentary</a></p>\n\n\n",

Like we have a few announcements before shofar explaining the halachot as well as local Minhag, but when it comes to this i.e. Arba minim, it seems in all the dozens of orthodox shuls I've been to, there is no announcement but everyone still manages to collectively settle on a certain order together..</p>\n<p>It's not something like a sefardi Ashkenazi divide that I am simply being \"dyslexic\" about either.

The shul where I daven people just do it both ways, with the people not separated at all. The same is certainly true about davening Nusach Ashkenaz/Nasuch Sefard - people do whatever they do.

Does this mean that everything that Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar said about who G-d is, and what G-d does is not truth and we should not rely on that to inform us about G-d? That would mean that passages like <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2721.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 21: 21-30</a> and <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2704.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 4</a> are not to be considered truth.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.42.7?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Job.42.7?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>Anytime you'd like the Jewish perspective on a Bible verse, please start with the Jerusalem translation, and Rashi's commentary -- all available in English, for free, on Sefaria.org. As seen above.</p>\n<p>\"truth\" is a poor translation; the word here is not <em>emet</em>, but <em>nachon</em>, which is more like \"proper.\"</p>\n<p>Rashi explains that the trio had blamed Job for his own suffering when he was down, which was \"improper\"; Elihu hadn't done so. The Talmud stresses that someone in pain should be given a lot more slack for what they, and most of the Jewish commentaries apply that here -- Job was hurting, so we can't blame him, but for you to kick him when he was down was <em>improper</em>!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>because you did not speak Because you did not speak to Me with a correct argument as did My servant Job, for he did not rebel against Me except for what he said (above 9:22), “He destroys both the innocent and the wicked,” and through the Adversary who denounces the world, as it is stated (ibid. verse 23): “If the scourge kills suddenly etc.” And if he continued to speak, he spoke because of the severity of the pains that burdened him and overwhelmed him; but you rebelled by condemning him, saying (4: 6), “Behold, your fear was your foolishness,” and you held him to be a wicked man, and at the end when you were silenced and defeated before him, you should have consoled him as Elihu did. Was it not enough for Job with his trouble and his sufferings, that you added rebellion to your sins to provoke him?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other commentaries (Metzudas David) actually read the phrasing differently -- <em>just like Job, none of you spoke properly</em> -- i.e. <em>everyone's</em> musings missed the mark, but at least Job is \"My servant\" and only saying this out of the pain.</p>\n<p>Malbim takes a fascinating different approach: Job knew the right thing in his heart, but the pain made him shout out all sorts of complaints. His buddies didn't truly believe, but were spouting platitudes. Thus, G-d calls them out. (While it's certainly not Scripture, a similar point comes up to readers of Shakespeare, whether to read <a href=\"https://nosweatshakespeare.com/quotes/famous/to-thine-own-self-be-true/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Polonius' advice to Laertes</a> (<em>to thine own self be true</em>) as sincere, or is he just shallowly reciting some common morals lines everyone said at the time, and doesn't really mean it.)</p>\n\n\n",

The verse you mention from Vayikra (23:40) beautifully illustrates the dual nature of the mitzvah of lulav: the physical act of taking the four species (וּלְקַחְתֶּם) and the spiritual joy and elevation it brings (וּשְׂמַחְתֶּם).</p>\n<p>The act of taking the four species in our hands reflects our ability and responsibility to harness the physical world for a spiritual purpose. The Talmudic distinction you brought, where the lulav is taken for all seven days in the Beis Hamikdash but only on the first day elsewhere, hints at the elevated spiritual status of the Mikdash. It is a place where the Divine presence is palpably felt, and thus, every action there resonates with a heightened spiritual significance.</p>\n<p>The distinction you've heard, that וּלְקַחְתֶּם refers to the physical act of taking the species while וּשְׂמַחְתֶּם alludes to the shaking, is deeply insightful. Our Sages have always found profound layers of meaning in every nuance of the Torah. By this reading, the act of shaking the lulav becomes not just a physical motion, but an expression of inner joy, a dance of the soul.</p>\n<p>However, regarding the halachic implications of this interpretation, it's crucial to approach with caution. The idea that the shaking of the lulav might be a biblical command is indeed not the mainstream view. Yet, Chassidus teaches us to seek deeper meanings and intentions in our actions, beyond just the halachic requirements. Perhaps this interpretation, while not necessarily halachic in nature, can inspire us to approach the mitzvah of lulav with greater enthusiasm and intention.</p>\n<p>It's always commendable to delve into the deeper layers of Torah and mitzvot. Still, for practical halacha, one should always consult a reliable halachic authority. The true beauty of Torah is that it seamlessly blends the heavenly with the earthly, the esoteric with the practical. By taking the lulav and etrog, shaking them, and rejoicing before Hashem, we connect with the Divine and draw down blessings for the entire year.</p>\n\n\n",

It's an infinite regress, and ultimately the answer seems to always end up along the lines of \"It is beyond our understanding, we can not fathom or ask questions about the Will of G-d and why He desired something\".

Sometimes this is answered with 'so that so people don't feel ashamed for getting a free gift', but obviously you can simply ask 'why couldn't G-d make a world without such a shame for free gifts?'. Or e.g. if He wanted a dwelling place below, why not just create it? Why did there need to be a system of Divine laws and human history, and humans tasked with building this dwelling place by following those laws?

In other words, we were given a paradigm that is analogous to the Divine sense of justice so that we can relate better to Divinity. While our reality can be manipulated so that anything works to accomplish Divine will, that will itself does not change. So while G-d could make it so that when a person receives lashes, they experience no pain, yet receive atonement, the will is that the pain atones. Those details, when we look into them, spell out a certain logic that would be counterproductive to change, because each step of the process is part and parcel of the Divine plan and will. This is reflected in statements like \"Gam Zu L'tovah\". So why should there be a world where we did not need to be good to deserve goodness, when being good to deserve goodness is a Divine preference? All of the details are part of that same will, which does not change. The Torah tells us some of the immutable beliefs that G-d holds. Likewise, we did not need to be created at all, and the dwelling place could have been made by Divine power, in full recognition of G-d. But then, that would be less reflective of Divinity, because according to the Torah (i.e. Divine belief) it is fitting that G-d be accepted through free will even without extremely apparent revelation (i.e. dwelling place in the lower world), so why would G-d need to effect that by Divine manipulation of logic, or even want to?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>These are great questions that I hope I don't ruin by answering, but indeed there are answers in the sources. The first stop we take is to prove that indeed there is an end to the whys. Hashem's ratzon is absolute, and therefore what He wants, He wants for it and not for a secondary reason. This is brought in the Guide to the Perplexed 3:13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יהיו ... הנמצאות כולם מכוונות לעצמם לא מפני דבר אחר</p>\n<p>Each and every being exists for its own sake, and not because of some\nother thing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Manis Friedman, after his own teachers, puts it rather bluntly<sup>1</sup>: if you ask Hashem why He wants a particular mitzvah, He will tell you He doesn't know! It's not a \"<em>knowledge</em>\" thing, it's on a level altogether above that.</p>\n<p>Next, the list you have given is not a list of equals. The Dira Betachton reason, and the desire to have a relationship are actually one and the same (and intertwined with the notion of wanting to do good to His other, too!), and this is the highest reason, and actually is relevant to Him Himself (see the midrashim this is taught from<sup>2</sup>). When the sources ask why He wants that, they conclude the same as above, that He wants it not to solve a higher problem; that <em>is</em> what He wants. That's why Chazal call it a ta'avah.</p>\n<p>The reason we can't ask why on that is because there is no why. Or rather, the only answer you can give is \"because that's Him\". If you try to play the why game here, you hit a genuine dead end; why is He the way He is and not another way is a nonsense (and probably forbidden) question.</p>\n<p>You should note that it was explained in 1952 in a maamer called \"B'sha'a Shehikdimu\"<sup>3</sup> by the Lubavitcher Rebbe that there is a hidden inner reason we learn from the Kabbalah as to why He wants a relationship, and the answer is, He wants a relationship with Nishmat Yisrael specifically. To speak in the way of man, He never wanted to get married until He met her. So truly, the \"reason\" for creation is at least as elusive, and infinitely more so still, than trying to ask a man why he married his wife. Going to the world of reason to find the answer is inappropriate, and insensitive.</p>\n<p>This is a very beautiful and Divine way to have a relationship; to tell one's spouse that there's no reason for their relationship. He doesn't want us in order to achieve something or because of something <em>about</em> us. He just wants us, for us, because it's us.</p>\n<p>This answers one of your smaller questions. Why does doing good require the good to be earned and the Ramchal gives our answer in Derech Hashem 1:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה איננו שלימות אמיתי אלא יקרא שלימות בערך אל ענין חסר ממנו אך\nהשלימות בהחלט אינו אלא שלימותו ית׳‎ וע״כ בהיות חפצו ית׳‎ להטיב לזולתו\nלא יספיק לו בהיותו מטיב קצת טוב אלא בהיותו מטיב תכלית הטוב שאפשר\nלברואים שיקבלו ובהיותו הוא לבדו ית׳‎ הטוב האמיתי לא יסתפק חפצו הטוב\nאלא בהיותו מהנה לזולתו בטוב ההוא עצמו שהוא בו ית׳‎ מצד עצמו שהוא הטוב\nהשלם והאמיתי</p>\n<p>And therefore since His desire, may He be blessed, was to do good to\nothers, it would not be sufficient for Him to do a little good, but\nrather [only] in giving the full goodness that is possible for the\ncreatures to receive. And in His alone, may He be blessed, being the\ntrue good, His good desire would only be satisfied by giving others\nthat very good that is within Him, may He be blessed, from the angle\nof Himself - which is the truly perfect good...</p>\n<p>כי אלו היה מוכרח במעשיו להיות בוחר עכ״פ בשלימות לא היה נקרא באמת בעל\nשלימותו כי איננו בעליו כיון שהוכרח מאחר לקנות והמקנהו הוא בעל שלימותו\nולא היתה הכונה העליונה מתקיימת</p>\n<p>...For if he were forced in his actions to choose perfection no matter\nwhat, he would not truthfully be called the master of his perfection;\nas since he is forced to acquire [it] by another, he is not its\nmaster. [Rather] it is the one who makes him acquire it that is the\nmaster of his perfection. So [God's] intention would not have been\nfulfilled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>i.e. it's because that's the way <em>He</em> is; master of His own good, therefore to give us that level of good we have to be like Him and master our own good. To put it in terms of relationships, in order to be in a holy relationship, there must be consent as well as an opportunity to truly express <em>ourselves</em> in our love and connection with our God (by making the Dira for Him and inviting Him in ourselves).

Yet, this very notion is a created understanding.\nFrom the point of view of God’s Sovereignty, there really is a King\nwithout a people, who can reign before any of the creation was formed,\nsince God is all-powerful (from the great summary by translator R'\nBetzalel Edwards)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(something I also heard, give or take, from R YY Jacobson) which is that He doesn't really need a people to be King, and that's only something true from our perspective, but not from His.

    "content": "# Why is tzitzis treated as an obligation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Following up on the question asked here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12366/why-do-people-feel-that-there-is-a-need-to-wear-tzitzit\">Why do people feel that there is a NEED to wear tzitzit?</a></p>\n<p>It seems like the answer is that we wear it to remind us about all the mitzvos.</p>\n<p>First of all, what is it about tzitzis that reminds us about mitzvos, what if I want to wear a red string on my finger as a reminder?</p>\n<p>Second of all, what if it just isn't, then why am I wearing tzitzis. Meaning inherently there is no obligation to wear it, the only reason to wear it is to remind me about the mitzvos, but I have been wearing it my entire life and have never once thought about the mitzvos so why bother continuing to wear it?</p>\n<p>And if you say 'Because it's a mitzva so just to do it to get reward', I guess that is a reason to do it, but there are many things we can do at all times to get reward and we don't treat them like obligations that we need to do at all moments (i.e. 6 constant mitzvos).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Tzitzit became an always-obligation on the advice of Chazal, in Menachot 41a, who brought the story of the angel who warned us against an attitude of not seeking to do positive mitzvot even when one doesn't need to, and also explained that this attitude elicits punishment from Hashem at times of Divine anger.</p>\n<p>So we developed a very strong minhag to always wear it when awake. The fact that it reminds us to keep all the mitzvot adds to this but is not the main reason (note Sefer Hachinuch describes it as the shoresh of the general mitzva, and hints at what the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.8.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur paskens</a>: it is not a benefit but an <em>obligation</em> to remember the rest of the mitzvot when donning tzitzit!). The same gemara gives a story designed to help us understand that side of things: the man who almost slept with a prostitute, in a very premeditated way was saved at the last minute when his tzitzit hit him in the face when he was getting undressed.</p>\n<p>The tzitzit are holy, and Jewish, and a mitzvah. Even if a red string works better for you, the tzitzit are still valuable and mystical, and their sanctity will protect you in ways that go deeper than the mere superficial reminder of the mitzvot.</p>\n<p>On that point, it is worth reading through the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.386.2?lang=bi&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Hachinuch</a> on its explanations on the way the tzitzit remind us of the mitzvot. Apart from the more \"miraculous\" benefits I brought above, the Torah works best when it is studied with effort, so it's cures and remedies can work. As Ramban <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.2?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=en&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>, the Torah only makes us good people if we want it to, and we work hard.</p>\n<p>Still, we don't wear tzitzit for any reminders. We wear them for the reasons listed above.</p>\n\n\n",

I have seen, however, those who are stringent not to perform any kind of labour, even though it has become very, very dark, and their practice is fitting and proper — for the permissive ruling follows the community in all matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then in siman 1062 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמנהג להתחיל להכריז המצות בליל שמחת תורה סמוך לחשיכה, ונראה לי הטעם דצררי ההיתר שכתוב במהרי,\"ל אינם כראי אלא דוקא ביום טוב שני שאינו אסור מדינא רק מנהג אבותינו בידינו ראנו בקיאין בקביעא דירחא אבל ביום טוב ראשון שאיסורא מדורייתא לא רצו קדמונינו להתיר הכרזות המצות לימות השנה שאף שבכל שבת ויום טוב מכריזין צורך שעתא עכשיו שאני. לכן עתה מקרוב שהתחילו הגבאי צדקה להקרים המצות בעוד יום הסכילו עשות בעיני</p>\n<p>The custom is to begin announcing the mitzvos (i.e., auctioning the kibbudim etc.) on the night of Simchas Torah, close to nightfall. It seems to me that the basis for the permissibility (“the bundles of the heter”) written by the Maharil are not a blanket license, but apply only on the second day of Yom Tov, which is not biblically prohibited, but rather observed by virtue of the custom of our ancestors, since we are no longer expert in calendar calculations. However, on the first day of Yom Tov, which is a Torah-level prohibition, our early sages did not wish to permit the announcements and auctioning of the mitzvos for the coming year, even though on every Shabbos and festival it is customary to announce such matters when needed, because this situation is different. Therefore, in recent times, when the charity officers (gabba’ei tzedakah) have begun auctioning the mitzvos while it is still daytime, they have acted wisely in my eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_Maharik.9.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvos Maharik #9</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Colon_Trabotto\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Colon Trabotto</a>, 15th century, Italy–Germany) also makes mention of the practise.</p>\n<p>Among the Loazim (French- or Italian-speaking communities), it was their practice that on Shabbos Bereshis one member of the congregation donates money for the lighting of the shul lamps, so that he may be called for the first aliyah, to begin the Torah anew. Ordinarily, if a Kohen was present, one of two things would happen: Either the Kohen himself would buy the mitzvah, thereby fulfilling both his priestly precedence and the communal custom, or he would waive his right to the first aliyah, leave the shul, allowing the purchaser to receive it instead. On one occasion, a certain Kohen refused both options (i.e. he would not purchase the mitzvah (he didn’t want to pay) and he would not waive his honour or leave the shul. He also refused to attend another shul where the custom was not practiced. The community was actually willing to let him be called first as a Kohen, if that would preserve peace — but the townspeople at large insisted that this would undermine their cherished custom.\nTherefore, to uphold the communal honour and their ancestral tradition, they barred him from entering the shul, even enlisting the civil magistrate to enforce the ban. The question presented to the Maharik was did they act justly according to halacha.</p>\n<p>The full answer he presents is beyond the scope of this answer but some cool takeaways are as follows:</p>\n<p>He notes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכ\"ש במנהג הזה שהוא כבוד התורה ועלויה דפשיטא שהיא מתעלה כשקופצים לקרות קריאת פתיחתה בדמים אין לך חביב התורה גדול מזה גם מתוך כך שמן למאור מצוי יותר בריוח וכן נהגו בכל קהילות הקודש בצרפת ואשכנז לעשות כיוצא בזה בשמחת התורה ואלו ואלו לשם שמים נתכוונו אלא שאלו עושים בזה שמסיימים התורה ואלו ביום שמתחילים התורה ויש בזה מה שאין בזה ונהרא נהרא</p>\n<p>Indeed, in this custom, which is an honour to the Torah and an elevation [of its sanctity], it is clear that it is exalted: when they leap to read its opening aliyah, there is no greater delight in the Torah than this. Moreover, because oil for the lamps is more readily available, and so it was the custom in all the holy communities in France and Ashkenaz to do likewise on Simchas Torah. Both of these practices — those who do it when finishing the Torah and those who do it when beginning it — are intended for the sake of Heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fascinatingly, he concludes that a local custom, especially one that honours the Torah or strengthens communal observance, is binding and should not be overridden, even if it appears contrary to halacha, out of concern for respect, tradition, and public order.</p>\n<p>One final mention, I saw b'derech agav in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaTashbetz%2C_Part_III.156.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tashbetz, cheilek gimmel, siman 156</a>.</p>\n<p>There the question was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והראן. שאלת קהל בררו עשרה בני אדם לעשות המצות וקריאת ס\"ת <strong>בכללם שדרכם למכרם יום שמחת התורה</strong> ונתנו להם בחנם שנה א' ועמדו כך כמו חצי שנה ואח\"כ אמרו להם תתנו לנו שכר מצות שעשיתם או צאו לכם ממה שאתם עושי' אם יכולין להוציאם תוך שנתם ואם יש עליהם שום תביעת ממון בשכירתו</p>\n<p>And this was the question that was asked: A congregation chose ten men to perform the religious duties (“the mitzvos”) and among them also the reading of the Torah — <strong>a position that includes selling (i.e. auctioning) the honors of Simchas Torah</strong>. They granted (these ten men) this appointment for free for one year, and they continued in this role for about half a year. Afterwards, the community (or its leaders) said to them: “Either you shall give us payment for the mitzvos (i.e. for the privileges/benefits you have performed or received), or you must remove yourselves from the position you hold.” The question is:\nAre they permitted to remove them (the ten men) from their position in the middle of the year, before the term is complete? And, is there any monetary claim upon them regarding the ‘rental’ (or the granting) of this position — i.e., are the men obligated to pay anything for having served or held this appointment?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It is unclear the\nprohibition. See Ra''n at end of R''H on Baal Hamaor... See Taz 592:2\nand the answers are forced. The Ran concludes since the Rif says this\nin the name of the Reish Mesivta we must be careful with this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Moshe continues:\nIt appears even if someone intentionally speaks it is not a prohibition literally - however, once it is announced it <strong>might</strong> be come one, since the listener thinks there is a prohibition.</p>\n<p>See Taz quoted there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(ב) לא ישיח לא התוקע כו׳ – בטור כתוב א״צ לחזור ולברך ומיהו יש לגעור\nבמי שמסיח כו׳ וכ״כ הר״ן בשם ריש מתיבת׳ שראוי לגעור ותמה הר״ן שהרי אין\nבשיחה זו הפסק מידי דהוי אמדבר באמצע הסעוד׳ דא״צ לחזור ולברך המוציא.\nולעד״נ לתרץ דזה הוי כמי שלא התחיל עדיין במצו׳ וכגון שלא אכל עדיין כלל\nדהא בשעת הברכה מתכוין על עיקר קיום המצו׳ שהיא על סדר הברכות כמ״ש סי׳\nתקע״ה למה תוקעין כשהן יושבין וחוזרים ותוקעין בשעת מוסף כדי לערבב השטן\nפי׳ בתקיע׳ הראשונ׳ מתערבב קודם התפל׳ כדי שלא יקטרג בשעת התפלה כו׳ הרי\nשעיקר התקיעה של מצוה היא על סדר הברכות אלא שהתקיעות שמיושב לערבב השטן\nבעת קיום המצוה שהיא אח״כ ונהי שא״צ לחזור ולברך כיון שעכ״פ התחיל בעשיית\nמצוה והצורך לה מ״מ כ״ז שהוא לא קיים עדיין העיקר אינו יכול להפסיק ולא\nעוד אלא שבכל מצוה שהוא עוסק ואינו רשאי להפרד משם עד שיקיי׳ כולה איסור\nיש בהפסקתו ובבדיק׳ חמץ מצינו ג״כ איסור כמ״ש סי׳ תל״ב. ואין זה דומה\nלמדבר באמצע הסעוד׳ או בישיבתו בסוכ׳ דשם אי בעי פסיק והולך לו משא״כ\nבמקום שלא גמר עדיין המצו׳ וכמו הכא שעיקר המצוה עדיין לפניו פשוט שיש\nאיסור להשיח ומה לי שיחה שבין התקיעות עצמן של מיושב דודאי יש איסור שם\nלהפסיק בשיחה ומה לי אחריהם כל שלא קיים עדיין מה ששייך להמצוה הזאת\nובסי׳ תל״ב כתבתי עוד מזה ע״ש כנלע״ד דיש איסור בהפסק׳ זו בשיח׳ מדינא\nודוגמא לזה מצינו בפ׳ ע״פ דף ק״כ לענין ברכת מצה וז״ל ואפי׳ אם עיקר\nהמצו׳ באחרונה אין זה תימה אם מברכין על הראשונה כדי לפטור האחרונה כו׳\nעכ״ל ואע״ג דהתם שרי להשיח בין אכילה ראשונ׳ לאחרונ׳ התם חד ענין הם אלא\nשא׳ מהם עיקר משא״כ כאן ראשונה ואחרונה כל א׳ מצוה מיוחדת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here he incidentally deals with your issue. The Beracha is intended on all of the Shofar. <strong>The first set is different then the second set, the main focus is the second set, which the beracha is primarily for</strong>. Unlike Succah, a person can stop and leave any time. Matzah which even if the beracha focuses on the latter Matzah is the same unlike the blasts.</p>\n<p>Imo here are a number of additional reasons upon my own logic:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Talking does not only interrupt the Beracha, but also ruins the Mitzvah by not being able to hear.</p>\n<p>a. This might interfere with the Mitzvah of you or another, practically. Unlike Lulav, all can shake while someone else is speaking.</p>\n<p>b. Since this is not just an interruption between Bracha and action but in fact counter to the Mitzvah it might be considered more than an interruption, almost like a decision to separate one's self (ie: deciding to be done eating after making a beracha would require a new Bracha). Placing the lulav down one could argue - since like Tallis you have in mind to pick it up again etc.... I personally assume the Mitzvah has been completed when it comes to picking up or shaking the Lulav once; otherwise, there would be similar issues like Tallis.</p>\n<p>c. Perhaps the Baal Tokeah only has in mind those listening in his Beracha and you might separate yourself from his intention/berahca when you speak.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Similarly, at the very least an announcement must be made to not interrupt for Shofar blasts since due to the variations, the Mitzvah is not completed on one blast, or even one set, but in fact after a number of variations. It is simple to announce to not interrupt at all, especially if one of the set might have a problem and one needs to redo them etc....</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

As it says in the Torah: \"These are the appointed festivals of Hashem, which you shall proclaim as times of sacred assembly\" (Vayikra 23:37). Chazal (our sages) expound upon this to discuss the unique character of Chol Ha'moed, which, while not carrying the full restrictions of Yom Tov, nonetheless retains a special sanctity. This sanctity requires us to avoid unnecessary work and engage in activities befitting the holiday spirit.</p>\n<p>The primary issue at hand is the nature of melacha (work) on Chol Ha'moed. The Gemara in Moed Katan (12a) discusses various melachot and their permissibility during this period. One principle that emerges is that of \"davar ha'avud\" - a situation where a loss would occur if one abstains from a particular activity. In such cases, leniency is generally allowed.</p>\n<p>Attending college or university classes, especially those which are essential for one's academic progress or are mandated by the curriculum, might be comparable to situations of \"davar ha'avud\". Missing crucial classes could result in academic or financial repercussions, which can be seen as a loss.</p>\n<p>However, it's essential to differentiate between classes that are truly critical and those which are not. As Rashi notes on Moed Katan 12a, \"any melacha that can be done after the festival without a loss should be postponed\". If one can reasonably reschedule or make up for missed classes without detriment, it would be fitting to avoid attending during Chol Ha'moed.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Rambam in Hilchot Yom Tov (7:1) discusses the prohibition of doing unnecessary work on Chol Ha'moed, emphasizing that the goal is to focus on the joy of the festival and not be preoccupied with mundane tasks. Thus, even if attending classes is technically allowed, the spirit of Chol Ha'moed should still be a consideration.</p>\n<p>Yet, as the original post wisely noted, \"Please ask your rabbi instead of trusting what you read here.\" Every individual's situation is unique, and only a competent halachic authority, familiar with the nuances of both the situation and the halacha, can provide a definitive answer.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Conversion therapy and Halacha\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I wanted to know what the Halacha is of conversion therapy being necessary. In the Torah, the biblical prohibition is “Do not lie with a male as one lies with a woman; it is an abhorrence.” Leviticus 18:22, meaning the Torah level prohibition is on gay sex. However, the other part of this is “it is an abhorrence”, meaning it seems on top if it being immoral to do gay acts, being gay attracted may be a separate part of the prohibition (since something being abhorrent generally means something to avoid), does this mean that organizations like Hod are wrong in their opposition of conversion therapy,(I would imagine their view is closer to modern orthodoxy than haredi/hasidic)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Peninei Halacha* (Simchat Habayit 4:13 onwards, and matches what I've learned since forever, e.g. see Rabbi David Gottlieb's \"Alternative Lifestyles\" lecture), explains that nobody should be criticised for saying homosexuality is innate, and also that we shouldn't assume that all cases are innate either - in fact it proves that social and moral climate are highly relevant to the discussion. It writes into halacha that the act is always forbidden in either case, and that heaven takes into account the norms of society in passing judgement (4:14). Also, in either case, the halacha is to avoid sexual thoughts.</p>\n<p>He presents in his halachic work a lot of various, nuanced ideas about what might cause homosexuality that any level headed person should consider, but ultimately concludes that we don't truly know.</p>\n<p>He explains that the only possibility of considering a homosexual in a negative way compared to any other sin, is if that person is being homosexual in a defiant way (4:15), just to anger God - which it level headedly acknowledges is very rare, but certainly possible. So that really does rule out any dabbling with the word \"abhorrent\" in the normative contexts you've brought in the question (a word which is generally referring to how this practice frustrates the continuation of the species, as well as makes it harder for people to join with their soul mates - male and female, a key Torah principle - and achieve true Torah intimacy). In fact, dehumanising homosexuals is <strong>nonexistent</strong> in Torah, and in these contexts would be considered as evil as dehumanising heterosexuals (4:17), and a breach of Ahavat Yisrael.</p>\n<p>It doesn't explicitly mention conversion therapy, but it does encourage people to talk to their family and wise rabbonim who can guide them. It leaves the door open for simply coping, or if the person wants (and it can be life or death for some people), work towards whatever they can that helps them pursue the mitzvot of Pru urvu and onah in a healthy way. It does not permit in any case what the Torah forbids, and not out of any agenda against our beloved homosexual brethren, God forbid, but purely out of the same acknowledgement that all experiences, pleasures and pursuits are created and belong to Hashem, and <strong>all</strong> is forbidden unless He explicitly permits it, including sex before marriage, for example.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is said that it is forbidden to get married and pursue these mitzvot if one is not going to be attracted to one's spouse no matter what, e.g. one is homosexual and the other heterosexual. But as we said, not everyone falls into this category so the subject of helping people discover and kindle heterosexual feelings, if that's what they want, should definitely not be taboo (not that that precludes being sensitive about it in any way).</p>\n<p>This is realistic wisdom that acknowledges the complexities of life, the limitations of our knowledge, the fact that all belongs to Hashem, and is grounded in the honest pursuit of truth with the aim of making the world better for everyone. It takes as axiomatic the Torah as being the word of Hashem, and understandably therefore might be upsetting or offensive to anyone who does not hold that axiom, so I am sorry for any upset caused. Please bare in mind that we truly believe the Torah's advice and law are purely for the maximum benefit of not just society as a whole, but of each and every individual personally, <strong>all</strong> of whom are considered Hashem's children.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><Sup>* very adjacent to Hasidism, as per your <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/137269/conversion-therapy-and-halacha#comment457572_137269\">comment</a></sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it commendable to be fearful of God's wrath?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the daily recitation of the Shema, we mention God's anger (וחרה אף) as a potential motivation for adhering to the Torah. However, there seems to be a concern that some individuals might overemphasize or overly focus on God's wrath, potentially hindering their commitment to Torah observance. This perspective is arguably imbalanced or misguided.</p>\n<p>For example, I recall a lecture by Rabbi Moshe Weinberger from years ago, where he recounted an incident involving a couple who had tragically lost a child. They were worried that this loss might be a punishment from Hashem for speaking ill of a family member. Rabbi Weinberger, to the best of my recollection, dismissed this notion and expressed surprise that people view Hashem as a punitive or vindictive figure.</p>\n<p>On one hand, Rabbi Weinberger's viewpoint resonates with me strongly. On the other hand, classical Jewish texts and teachings, include statements like \"בעון נדרים בנים מתים,\" and works such as \"ראשית חכמה\" and \"יסוד ושרש העבודה,\" convey a sense of a pervasive and potent attribute of divine justice, מדת הדין.</p>\n<p>Specifically in Rabbi Weinberger's example and in life in general, is there a limit to how one should interpret challenging situations as an expression of God's wrath?

And indeed the Rambam himself explicitly warns the reader in his <em>Introduction</em> that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any inconsistency discovered in the present work will be found to arise in consequence of the fifth cause or the seventh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fifth cause being <em>the use of a certain method adopted in teaching and expounding profound problems</em>, and the seventh <em>concealing the fact as much as possible, to prevent the uneducated reader from perceiving the contradiction.</em></p>\n<p>With that in mind, let us turn our attention to what Maimonides writes in <a href=\"https://sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp185.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Guide to the Perplexed</em></a> about circumcision:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Circumcision is not like an incision on the leg, or a burning in the arm, but a very difficult operation;</li>\n<li>Circumcision is [to be] performed when the child is very young [for] when a child is very young, the parents do not think much of him; because the image of the child, that leads the parents to love him, has not yet taken a firm root in their minds;</li>\n<li>[Circumcision] gives to all members of the same faith, i.e., to all believers in the Unity of God, a common bodily sign, so that it is impossible for any one that is a stranger, to say that he belongs to them; and</li>\n<li>It is hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him, [and] in [his] opinion this is the strongest of the reasons for circumcision.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Could it be that he is covertly condemning it in between the lines? Firstly, he is saying that circumcision is a \"very difficult\", i.e. risky, operation (and here one must not forget that Maimonides was a physician!).</p>\n<p>Secondly, his explanation for <em>brit milah</em> being performed on the 8th day of life has no relationship at all to scripture, but simply an opportunistic exploitation of the child's parents lack of compassion for him (especially the father's, as he points out).</p>\n<p>Thirdly, the defense of circumcision as a mark of religious identity makes little sense for someone who lived his entire life amongst Muslims, who were also circumcised.</p>\n<p>Lastly, and most critically, how is it that uncircumcised men being irresistible to women is a defense of circumcision? At all?? Did he not want Jewish men and women to marry? Did he not want them to stay married? Of course he did.</p>\n<p>So what gives? It sounds like to me he is <em>explaining</em> circumcision, he is giving <em>reasons</em> for it, but not actually justifying it. In fact, much to the contrary! He is covertly condemning it by giving reasons that are in stark contradiction to the ethics he so eloquently advocates in <em>Pirkei Avot</em>.</p>\n<p>As a final note, some may notice I did not include above Maimonides' statements that circumcision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>is</em> painful, and</li>\n<li>dulls sexual pleasure.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While these aspects may be in contradiction with modern Western ethic, they not necessarily are with the ethic Maimonides articulated and advocated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rambam himself tells us in the introduction that he is weaving secrets into his work that only the clever will aduce. He also says that only one in a thousand will get what he is saying <em>in general</em>, let alone how few will get the <em>secrets</em>. Therefore it is highly inappropriate and dangerous for one to freely try to understand \"hidden meaning\" in Rambam, especially to prove one's own biased hypothesis.</p>\n<p>To answer your four points, all you have to do is read the context:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 is in a section that is acknowledging the pain involved - in this case the psychological pain to the parents - and what\nwe do to successfully avoid that to be humane (a subject that is very important in\nTorah thought and is even discussed in the Tanach).</li>\n<li>1 and 3 are discussing some of the meaning behind the mitzva (something Rambam does a lot in his writings, especially the guide - the mitzvot are replete with meaning and it is our duty to study that). I.e. in\n3 there is meaning in the togetherness generated, and in 1, he shows\nhow that togetherness is secure because it's highly unlikely someone\nwill go through such a strong operation to \"infiltrate\" the holy\nTorah community.</li>\n<li>4 is demonstrating an important Torah principle: we avoid excessive\nlust, and circumcision helps both men and women with this, the latter of which is being proven by this single point you've brought. Note: we hold\n<em>excessive</em> lust to be very dangerous to marriage and holiness. It ruins intimacy and relationships, rather than makes them more refined and close.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course he was a big halachist and wrote the first comprehensive collection of all halachot in Torah and is considered a great authority on halacha. The mitzva of circumcision is one of Judaism's most important mitzvot (they are all equally important but there is a large disproportionate emphasis placed on this mitzva throughout all Torah writings and for this reason the Torah community will certainly never abandon it even under great pressure or threat). It is unthinkable that he would be against it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Logical issues with your reading:</p>\n<p>\"convey their proper meaning\" does not equal \"adapt to the moral views of their time\".</p>\n<p>(Point 1 is quoted out of context, and it's really part of point 3. It clearly says that because it's so difficult, it creates a barrier to pretending to be Jewish, as well as creates a feeling of unity. But even if you quote it out of context as you did, ) describing a surgical procedure as difficult is not even a covert condemnation. It's just a description of medical fact.</p>\n<p>Point 2 is also taken out of context, plus you clearly didn't read the link you quoted that carefully, or you would have seen that it <strong>is in fact supported by Scripture</strong>. He did not say that the father doesn't care about his son very much when he is 8 days old. What he said (very clearly, if you read the context) was that the father loves his son more every day, so the best time to have to inflict a necessarily painful procedure would be just after birth, but since the Torah informs us that until a week of life, a birthed creature doesn't really have vitality, it would not be safe to do so. He quotes Lev. xxii. 27 to make this point.</p>\n<p>You also skipped the part where he said that the child will not be in much pain because of a baby's soft skin.</p>\n<p>You also skipped the part where he said that because the baby has not been conditioned to fear pain, he won't suffer the dread of oncoming pain.</p>\n<p>The fact that he lived in Muslim territories doesn't mean that should change the reason for the commandment given in the Torah, long before Muslims existed!</p>\n<p>Point 4 is also taken out of context. He says in that paragraph that circumcision counters excessive lust. Then he says that that (countering excessive lust) is the intention of the Midrash when it says that it is hard for the woman to separate ... So the part you quoted is interpreted by Maimonides to mean that circumcision is intended to limit excessive lust, and that is the best reason for the commandment. Then he says that it is relevant that this commandment was first displayed with Abraham, who feared this type of sin greatly , even with regards to his own wife.</p>\n<p>Besides, why would non-excessive lust prevent Jews from getting married or staying married? Jews get married before intimacy, so a Jewish woman should never experience the challenge of excessive lust before meeting and marrying her husband.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Controversies about eruvin\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was curious why an eruv is often extremely controversial (not in terms of the secular world, I mean within the Frum world), it seems anytime a new Eruv is built there’s always a chorus rabbinic voices preaching against, at least in the 21st century. The Manhattan eruv is a great example, but I was curious why this is? The halachic concept of an Eruv seem simple enough, there has to be an enclosed area of at least 4 corners connected. So why are they so controversial?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Although there are many reasons for this I will list what I think are the main three.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>An Eruv can only be made in a Karmelis (a non-biblical Reshus HaRabim) and not a Reshus HaRabim Min haTorah.\nMany Rishonim understand that a Reshus HaRabim Min haTorah is any street which is 16 amos wide (approx. 8m). Accordingly this would call into question many Eruvin.\nEven according to the opinion of Rashi in Eruvin 6b that one needs 600,000 people in the city to make it a Reshus HaRabim Min haTorah, Rav Moshe Feinstein in Igros Moshe OC 1,139 understands this that if there are 600,000 people travelling through the city not just a specific road this would make it a Reshus HaRabim Min haTorah. This would invalidate all Eruvin in cities with very large populations.\nThere are those that rely on the Chazon Ish who says if the city is mainly fenced (Omed Meruba Al haParutz) and has no breaches which invalidate an eruv etc., one could make an Eruv with doors. However not all Poskim rely on this.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Sechirus. In order to make an Eruv, there cannot be any non-Jews living inside the Eruv area as this invalidates the Eruv. Because this rental is only a rabbinic , the requirements for rental are low. The Gemara allows a weak rental (sechirus re’u’ah) and permits rental of even just the right of a worker to place items on the gentile owner’s property.\nWhat most Eruvin do is rent permission from a worker such or police/fire department who has some rights to enter the land without the knowledge or consent from the owner.\nSome disagree with this with method as the police don't have a right to go into your house at anytime, there is protocol, to obtain a warrant etc so therefore that it is not considered sechirus reshus.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Upkeep of the eruv. An eruv is a vast area and some are concerned that not all parts of the eruv are thoroughly checked enough.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think in addition that there are many different opinions of what might constitute a wall or not and how to construct it.</p>\n<p>Since an Eruv is a Rabbinic measure there might be room to be lenient; however, we like to uphold as many opinions as possible. On your front lawn this is quite straightforward, but in a city this can be quite difficult.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>Using a telephone wire as the eiruv (like many cities), well what happens when the stick that lies below it (it must be below) is crooked? It can become crooked because the telephone pole it's attached to leans or from wear and tear.</p>\n<p>Some say it does not work and some are lenient (like Rav Aharon Kotler).</p>\n<p>Or perhaps an Eiruv uses a body of water (ie: an intense slope or drop off). Well there is disagreement about this since it can erode etc...</p>\n<p>When many will not use a city wide Eiruv (because it doesn't follow most opinions), that adds to the controversy. I know a Rav in Eiruvin who will pretty much never use an Eiruv except for very very few city wide Eiruvin. He hates being shown an Eiruv when he visits, because he usually sees flaws.</p>\n\n\n",

Ramak gives a very abbreviated explanation, so it is better to look at the actual original from Rabbi Yitzchok to understand the concept. It can be found at <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20635&st=&pgnum=170\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Meirat Einayim beginning with the words למען יובן אל המורגש כו׳</a>. The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20635&st=&pgnum=171\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">actual diagram appears here</a>.</p>\n<p>Please take note that the commentary at the bottom of the page called יפה עינים is not from Rabbi Yitzchok, but written by a well-meaning person in the 1970's who, like you, got some things wrong. He also misinterprets the form of the letters in the diagram because he doesn't understand what Rabbi Yitzchok writes.</p>\n<p>The beginning of Rabbi Yitzchok's explanation presents the general idea that the final act of Creation is what arose first in G-d's mind, so to speak סוף מעשה מה שעלה במחשבה תחילה. And in that context, even though in general Adam HaRishon was the last thing created (which would imply man/male), the final act was the building of the woman, his wife, who would be the mother of his children, like is found in Bereshit 2:22-25.</p>\n<p>That means that the first thought was about the concept of Mother אימא or אם. And in Rabbi Yitzchok's <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20635&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to the ways of Kabbalah at the beginning of his supercommentary</a>, he explains that Mother, אם, is another expression for the Sefirah of Binah, because from the Mother, the whole world עולם is drawn forth. This follows the text of Mishlei 2:3 which says:\nכי <strong>אם לבינה תקרא</strong> לתבונה תתן קולך</p>\n<p>Continuing in his introduction, he explains that <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20635&st=&pgnum=35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one of the alternate terms for the Sefirah of Malchut is El Elyon אל עליון.</a> The term Elyon is referring to G-d's name related to <em>a woman who has become engaged to be married but prior to initial relations with her husband</em>. That intermediate name is צלמו, which is gematria Elyon.</p>\n<p>The significance of this name is that it is the name of G-d related to Sarah, our Matriarch, the wife of Avraham, our Patriarch שרה אשת אברהם.</p>\n<p>Sarah’s original name was Sarai שרי which forms the root of the name of the Jewish people, Israel ישראל (That Israel preceded the Creation by 2000 years. <em>See the commentary of Rashi to Bereshit 1:1</em>).</p>\n<p>That when G-d made His eternal covenant with Avraham, our Patriarch, He signed and sealed that covenant with a specific mark by dividing the letter Yud from Sarai's name (the Yud י, pronounced יו״ד, became two letter Heh's ה-ה, the Vav ו and Dalet ד from the pronunciation, became ה-ה.). G-d sealed that agreement with them both in their names. Avram אברם became Avraham אברהם and Sarai שרי became Sarah שרה, both together with a completely new destiny to be the sole inheritors of that possession (<em>to be called Israel</em>) from Adam HaRishon אדם and his wife חוה, and transmitters to the future, of that possession, to be the source of Israel ישראל. And Israel ישראל refers to the name of G-d associated with Sarai (Sarah) אל שרי, which is צלמו.</p>\n<p>In keeping with Rabbi Yitzchok’s description of the chart that like the skins of an onion, the Sefirot are nested from the outermost, meaning Keter, to the innermost, meaning Malchut. That is why the center  of the diagram contains the name צלמו. The letters Tzadi צ (which pertains to the Sefirah of Yesod as related to the <em>Wife</em>) and Mem מ (at the chart center meaning Malchut מלכות) are obvious and to the immediate left of the Mem is the letter Vav ו, which also comprises the left leg of the letter Heh ה for the Sefirah of Hod הוד. And to the left of the Vav is the top of the letter Lamed ל from the name צלמו which is associated with Malchut מלכות.</p>\n<p>Several points to note are that the letter Tzadi is not in its final form, but plain. So too with the letter Mem. That means that it refers specifically to this intermediate stage of maturity for a woman, when she is engaged but has not had relations yet with her husband nor born any children. That is why the name is specifically צלמו.</p>\n<p>The reason why the letters move to the left is because they are all from the left side, the side of Gevurah, meaning Binah, Gevurah and Hod.</p>\n<p>Looking again at the diagram, preceding from the outermost letter inward is found Kaf כ for Keter כתר, Chet ח for Chochmah חכמה, Beit ב for Binah בינה Chet ח for Chesed, and then we arrive at what should be Gimel ג for Gevurah גבורה. But instead, it is replaced with the letter Tet ט, which as he explained in his introduction stands for Atarah עטרה. And as he explains on the diagram, it is the <em>Immature</em> form meaning קטן whose middle letter is also the letter Tet ט. And like he explains in his introduction in regard to the concept of <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20635&st=&pgnum=30\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amuk Tachat</a> עמק תחת which is associated with Atarah, this represents the question, \"How will I give you children?\", meaning it is not mature yet.</p>\n<p>This means that in terms of the arrangements of the letters, Tet, Tzadi pashut and Tzadi Sofit ט-צ-ץ are from the immature form to the intermediate form to the mature form. Similarly, their corresponding numerical values are 9, 90 and 900.</p>\n<p>This is actually the inner meaning from Iyov 33:23 and 33:33. That one from one thousand אחד מני-אלף is 999 and that this one is the מליץ טוב, the Advocate for Good who will overturn מגברת any negative judgement. That מליץ is referring to the change in the name like is referenced in Bereshit 1:27, that צלמו becomes צלם or מלץ after having relations with the husband and bearing children.</p>\n<p>And like Rabbi Yitzchok explains in his introduction, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20635&st=&pgnum=33\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malchut is also the idea of <em>Softened</em> or <em>Sweetened</em> judgement</a>. And so this is the association to the left side, the side of Gevurah to the letter Tet ט of עטרה.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, relying on his introduction to the ways of kabbalah discussing alternate terms which relate to the Sefirah of Gevurah, he mentions Pachad Yitzchok פחד יצחק, which begins with the letter Peh פ. But this is not the primary explanation.</p>\n<p>And as he states explicitly about the diagram, if you count from the right side of the diagram inward toward the left, there are ten distinct Sefirot indicated on that right side.</p>\n<p>But in addition to this, continuing inward from the letter Tet which is assigned to the Sefirah of Gevurah, the form of the letter Lamed can also be seen as a letter Tav for Tiferet תפארת followed by the Nun for the Sefirah of Netzach נצח and the Heh for the Sefirah of Hod הוד which also includes the Vav from the name צלמו. But then the next letter is the letter Tzaddi from the name צלמו, but here it can also be understood as Tzaddik as in Tzaddik is the Foundation of the World. צ״דיק י״סוד ע״ולם (that like mentioned above, the founding of the world  is drawn out from the Mother.</p>\n<p>That the Sefirah of Yesod is here represented not by the letter Yud (or the letter Vav which is present in the diagram but opposite the letter Tzaddi, <em>that the end of the letter Vav corresponds to Yesod of the Zachar</em>), but by the letter Tzaddi which corresponds to the Yesod of Nukva, which is the letter Tzaddi from the name צלמו in its intermediate form. That Tzaddi and Vav together form the word Tzav צו which means connected. And the very center of the diagram is the letter Mem from the name צלמו which stands for Malchut מלכות.</p>\n<p>In the context of your specific question and how one of the alternate teachings relates the Sefirah of Gevurah גבורה to the expression of Pachad Yitzchok פחד יצחק (the <em><strong>Dread of Yitzchok</strong></em>), it brings to mind a timely and appropriate thought to reflect upon in light of current events, namely the closing words said by many of the Jewish people at the close of prayers each day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אַל־תִּירָא מִפַּחַד פִּתאֹם, וּמִשֹׁאַת רְשָׁעִים כִּי תָבֹא:</strong> עֻֽצוּ עֵצָה וְתֻפָר, דַּבְּרוּ דָבָר וְלֹא יָקוּם כִּי עִמָּנוּ אֵל: וְעַד זִקְנָה אֲנִי הוּא, וְעַד שֵׂיבָה אֲנִי אֶסְבֹּל: אֲנִי עָשִֽׂיתִי וַאֲנִי אֶשָׂא וַאֲנִי אֶסְבֹּל וַאֲמַלֵּט: אַךְ צַדִּיקִים יוֹדוּ לִשְׁמֶךָ יֵשְׁבוּ יְשָׁרִים אֶת־פָּנֶיךָ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Do not fear</strong></em> from the <em>sudden manifestation of <strong>dreadful judgement</strong></em> and from the <em><strong>holocaust of the evil ones</strong> when <strong>it will come</strong></em> <em>(Keeping in mind that <strong>the entire people Israel are Saints and Righteous</strong>.)</em>.</p>\n<p><em>They</em>, <strong>the evil ones</strong>, conceive a plot; it will be foiled. <em>They</em> agree upon action; it will not succeed. <em><strong>For God is with us!</strong></em></p>\n<p>Till you grow old, <strong>I</strong> (God) will still be the same. When you turn gray; it is <strong>I</strong> who will carry you. <em><strong>I</strong> did this</em>. <em><strong>I</strong> will elevate it and <strong>I</strong> will subject <strong>Myself</strong> to bear it; and <strong>I</strong> will carry and rescue <strong>you</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>the Righteous</strong> <em>(who have been subjected to this dread,)</em> will <em>acknowledge, thank and praise <strong>Your name</strong></em>; the upright, <em>(alluding to Israel)</em>, will dwell in Your presence.</p>\n<p>Blessings for good and for life to you all. <strong>עם ישראל חי</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Pharisees came from all economic classes but were distinguished by their rigid adherence to specific behavior prescriptions arising from their interpretation of the ambiguities in the Torah. I have read that after the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundational, liturgical, and ritualistic basis for Rabbinic Judaism.</p>\n<p>With regard to “who came first”, the Pharisees claimed Mosaic authority for their interpretation of Jewish religious law, while Sadducees represented the authority of the priestly privileges and prerogatives established since the days of Solomon, when Zadok, their ancestor, officiated as high priest.</p>\n<p>What I would like to know is who came first - the Pharisees or the Sadducees, and how far back can their origins be traced?</p>\n<p>Edit: With regard to the Tzedukim (mentioned in comments below) I understand that they were named after its founder Tzadok. There was a Tzeduki Sanhedrin in the times of Shimon ben Shatach, but this was a different Sanhedrin, separate from the mainstream Sanhedrin.</p>\n<p>P.S.

I have searched on-line for additional information and found a helpful (albeit simplistic) article that gives an overview of the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes, who emerged under Hasmonean rule.  Part of it says this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The most important of the three were the Pharisees because they are the spiritual fathers of modern Judaism.  Their main distinguishing characteristic was a belief in an Oral Law that God gave to Moses at Sinai along with the Torah.  The Pharisees believed that God also gave Moses the knowledge of what these laws meant and how they should be applied. This oral tradition was codified and written down roughly three centuries later in what is known as the Talmud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sadducees were elitists who wanted to maintain the priestly caste, but they were also liberal in their willingness to incorporate Hellenism into their lives, something the Pharisees opposed. The Sadducees rejected the idea of the Oral Law and insisted on a literal interpretation of the Written Law; consequently, they did not believe in an afterlife, since it is not mentioned in the Torah. The focus of Sadducee life was rituals associated with the Temple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sadducees disappeared around 70 A.D., after the destruction of the Second Temple. None of the writings of the Sadducees has survived, so the little we know about them comes from their Pharisaic opponents.  These two “parties” served in the Great Sanhedrin, a kind of Jewish Supreme Court made up of 71 members whose responsibility was to interpret civil and religious laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/pharisees-sadducees-and-essenes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/pharisees-sadducees-and-essenes</a></p>\n\n\n",

He noted a midrash that says how in the dor (generation) of Dovid HaMelech, even the youngest child knew how to learn Torah at a very high level, and yet the soldiers lost in war.

He spoke to a soldier who was in a very dangerous area and not in a situation where he can put Tefillin on. The soldier requested that the boys put on tefillin with him in mind - \"Do a mitzvah for me!\". The soldier then told the Rosh Yeshiva, \"You guys in the Beis Hamedrash are fighting this war\". Rabbi Wiesenfeld responded - \"No we're partners - we're doing our hishtadlus, you are doing your hishtadlus - the rest is up to the Ribono Shel Olam.\"</li>\n<li>Another soldier asked that the boys of the yeshiva daven. We cannot underestimate the strength of tefillah. There is a very limited amount of things we can do from a physical perspective, but there is a lot we can do from a spiritual and emotional perspective. It is a distinct wakeup call that the events unfolded specifically on Shemini Atzeres when Hashem says, \"קָשָׁה עָלַי פְּרֵדַתְכֶם\" - \"It is so hard for me to part with you!” (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Leviticus.23.36.1?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi Vayikra 23:36</a>)</li>\n<li>We have to strengthen our Emunah - even the most difficult trials and tribulations come from G-d.

Hashem chose the day - not our enemies. The Aruch LaNer writes that Shabbos is more powerful than Shofar, more powerful than the Arba Minim (i.e. it overrides the mitzvah). Thus, when you have a day as powerful as Shabbos, a day that is me'ein olam habah, and it falls out on Simchas Torah - this is a call to be mechazeik (strengthen) ourselves in Shabbos. The avoda has to be to make the day more kadosh (holy) - what can we do to elevate the day more? Make our meals, our tefillos more kadosh? Can we perhaps introduce more elevated levels of kedusha into our Shabbos.</li>\n<li>It was specifically on Shabbos <em>Simchas Torah</em> - not on Shavuos which is Zman Kabbalas HaTorah. Simchas Torah is where the emphasis is happiness. It is a reminder to recognise the pure joy that we have to our Torah and our attitude towards all our Torah institutions.</li>\n<li>Simchas Torah marks the end of our journey from the beginning of Elul where we made commitments to improve ourselves and fix things. If there is something that we honed in on - we have to ask ourselves, is it time to be mechazek ourselves further.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>HaGaon HaRav Moshe Shternbuch spoke about the recent events to his talmidims.

Olat Tamid Siman 193:5</strong> says a max of l 1 hour and 15 minutes (see Shu\"t Even Yisrael 7:14 for an explanation of this).</p>\n<p><strong>4. In the מור וקציעה סימן תרפא</strong> he says a max of 2 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>5. In Shulchan Hatahor Siman 188:15</strong> he says a max of 3 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>6. However, the Piskei Teshuvot Orach Chaim Siman 193:2 with footnote 12</strong> at the end quotes many poskim (the Bach at the beginning of Siman 293, Levush Siman 263:17, Pri Megadim Eshel Avraham beginning of Siman 296 and Menorah Hatehora Siman 263:3), who say that the halacha nowadays (in his opinion) is that as long as one doesn't have היסח הדעת from Shabbat, then he is still in Shabbat and must treat it like Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I will add to Mordechai's answer: While Plag seems to be the generally accepted opinion among the Achronim for the earliest Tosefes Shabbos on Erev Shabbos, in regards to the latest Tosefes Shabbos on Motzei Shabbos, there's a machlokes.</p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham (Orach Chayim 188:18) says (regarding what to say in Bentching if one started the meal on Shabbos/ Rosh Chodesh and ended it after the day ended):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושל\"ה פסק דבאלו [ר\"ח, פורים וחנוכה] כיון שאין מצוה בתוספתן לא יזכיר ע\"ש... ואנו אין לנו אלא דברי הרב\"י... דאזלינן בתר התחלת הסעודה... ועמ\"ש שם דלא כע\"ת שכתב משום תוס' שבת דליתא... ועמ\"ש דרך פשרה דשעה ורביעית תוך הלילה הוי מתוספת שבת לא דק דדוקא בע\"ש אמרינן כן כיון דלר\"י מפלג המנחה ואילך הוי לילה לענין ערבית מה שא\"כ במ\"ש דסגי במשהו... דאם היה מצוה בתוספתו היו המדקדקים נזהרים בדבר כמו בע\"ש.</p>\n<p>The Shl\"ah paskened that on Rosh Chodesh, Purim and Chanukah, <strong>because there's no Mitzvah of Tosefes</strong>, he shouldn't say [Ya'aleh v'Yavo/ Al HaNissim]. However we can only say like the Beis Yosef... <strong>That we go according to the beginning of the seuda [regardless of Tosefes Shabbos]</strong>... And see what he said, unlike the Olas Tamid who wrote that [we say R'tzei on Motzei Shabbos] because of Tosefes Shabbos, which cannot be... <strong>And see what he said as a compromise, that an hour and a quarter into the night is Tosefes Shabbos</strong>, which isn't precise, because specifically on Erev Shabbos we say that, because according to Rabbi Yehuda from Plag Mincha and on is night for Maariv purposes, which is not true on Motzei Shabbos, where even a little bit is enough [for Tosefes Shabbos]... Because if there was a mitzvah to add [beyond the \"little bit\"], then the Medakdekim would be careful regarding it like they are regarding Erev Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, there are three opinions quoted here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Shl\"ah, who holds that there's a mitzvah of Tosefes Shabbos on Motzei Shabbos with an indefinite timeframe (I unfortunately couldn't find anywhere where he mentions a latest time, but presumably there is one).</li>\n<li>The Magen Avraham, who holds that there isn't a Mitzvah beyond a \"mashehu\", which might be the \"three adjacent stars\" mentioned in Mordechai's answer.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21386&st=&pgnum=101\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Olas Tamid</a>, who holds that Tosefes Shabbos is an hour and a quarter after Shabbos ends, like Tosefes Shabbos on Erev Shabbos.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because this is all in regards to Benching after a Seuda that started on Shabbos, and similar Halachos apply to a meal on Motzei Yom Tov (in addition to the fact that I couldn't find any opinion that differeniates between the two in the part of Shulchan Baruch that talks about Tosefes Yom Kippur, Shabbos and Yom Tov), I think that the same opinions would apply for Motzei Yom Tov as well.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Shmiras Shabbos KeHilchasa also says (perek 44 s\"k 2) that according to those that hold that Tosefes Shabbos is de'Oraysa, so is Tosefes Yom Tov, which strengthens the claim that they have the same timeframe.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is clear from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Torat_HaAdam%2C_The_Gate_of_Mourning%2C_The_Matter_of_Old_Mourning.8?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban in Toras Haadom (Avel yishona)</a> that the latest time for Tosefes Yom Kippur is when three stars \"adjacent in one place\" appear:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובכאן הביא הענין לפרש דבר נעלם מדעת רבים שהראשונים לא הרחיבו בפירושו, והוא זמן התוספת הזה שמוסיפין ביום הכפורים ובשבתות וימים טובים מחול על הקדש, דודאי קודם בין השמשות הוא, דהא תוספת עשה, ובין השמשות ספק לעונש כרת ומיתה וחייב ידי אשם תלוי, ובשני בין השמשות חייב חטאת שמנה, אלא קודם בין השמשות הוא. ושיעור בין השמשות איפליגו עליה אמוראי בפרק במה מדליקין, ומסקנא משתשקע החמה הוי בין השמשות עד צאת הכוכבים, ואם כן התוספת הזה קודם שקיעת החמה הוא, וזה דבר גדול של תימה שתהא חמה זורחת כנגדו וחייב בעינוי ואסור במלאכה, ...</p>\n<p>וכן ביציאתו לאחר צאת הכוכבים לילה גמור הוא ומותר  בכל מלאכה, ועוד הזמן הזה ספק של בין השמשות הוא, ומהו הזמן הזה שעשתה אותו תורה תוספת והזהירה עליו בעשה.</p>\n<p>וראיתי לרבינו תם בספר הישר שלו פירוש נכון בסוגיא ההיא בפרק במה מדליקין, שהוא ז\"ל פירש דמשתשקע החמה דאיתמר הכא שהוא בין השמשות, היינו מסוף שקיעת החמה כלומר משעה שנשקעה ברקיע והיא עדיין כנגד חלונה, ולפי שלא עברה חלונה ועדיין אינה מהלכת אחורי כיפה פני הרקיע מאדימין כנגד מקומה של חמה, וזהו כל זמן שפני חמה מאדימין איתמר בגמרא, אבל תחלת שקיעת החמה שהיא השעה שהתחילה ליכנס ברקיע ונסתלקה זריחתה מן הארץ קודם לזמן הזה הוא.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>ולפי דבריו ופשטו זה אני אומר דמשעה שהתחיל השמש להשתקע עד זמן ביאת השמשות, והוא הזמן הנזכר בפרק במה מדליקין, הוא בכלל תוספת מחול על הקדש מהלך שלשת מילין ורביע מיל, רצה להוסיף כל הזמן הזה מחול על הקדש מוסיף, ואם רצה לעשות מקצתו חול ומקצתו תוספת עושה, ובלבד שיוסיף ממנו, ...</p>\n<p>הא כל זמן שהחמה זורחת בארץ יום גמור הוא אינו בכלל תוספת ולא בכלל ספק, ואע\"פ שפלג המנחה מוסיף על מהלך ארבעה מילין האמור בפסחים כשיעור שאמרנו, אין ביניהם אלא זמן מועט, וכשמתפלל בו של שבת קודם גמר תפלה מתחיל שמש לשקוע והגיע שעת התוספת, ...</p>\n<p>ומיהו תוספת מלאכה ועינוי דיום הכפורים ביציאתן אינה מתחוורת אצלי עדיין, דודאי משעת צאת הכוכבים לילה גמור הוא וקודם לכן בין השמשות, ובאיזה זמן הוא התוספת הזו, ובשלמא אליבא דרבי יהודה לא קשיא לי דאמר השחיר העליון והשוה לתחתון לילה, וזו השעה ודאי אינה צאת הכוכבים דאם כן היכי אמר רבי יוחנן דלא אכלי כהני בתרומה עד דשלים בין השמשות דרבי יוסי, הא כי שלים בין השמשות בצאת הכוכבים שלים, אלא שמע מינה משעה שהשחיר העליון והשוה לתחתון מופלג מעט מזמן צאת הכוכבים, והוא בין השמשות דר' יוסי,\nואליבא דידיה תנן משעה שהכהנים נכנסין לאכול בתרומתן סימן לדבר צאת הכוכבים. והא דאמרינן דשלים בין השמשות דר' יהודה והדר מתחיל בין השמשות דר' יוסי לאחר זמן, בהפלגה קאמר, שאם היה מתחיל מיל אינו מוסיף לנו אלא כהרף עין, דבר שאי אפשר לעמוד עליו, וכיון שכן משכחת לה לתוספת דר' יהודה משיכסוף העליון והשוה לתחתון עד צאת הכוכבים, אלא לר' יוסי תוספת יציאת קדש מאי ניהו.</p>\n<p>ויש לומר בהן שהן כוכבים גדולים, אי נמי כעין שאמרו בירושלמי בברכות ובלבד דתחמון תלתא כוכבים כד מן חדא כוכבתא כלומר רצופין במקום אחד הא מפוזרין אסור בעשיית מלאכה משום תוספת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize, the Ramban is bothered how Tosefes Shabbos could be while it is still broad daylight, and how at the end of Shabbos there could be Tosefes when it is fully night. He answers based upon Rabbenu Tam that the time \"when the stars come out\" is four mil after sunset (commonly referred to as 72 minutes, but if you examine the Ramban here you will see that he holds 90 minutes). He explains that Tosefes Shabbos is only during theses four mil. He then wonders what the equivalent period of time after Shabbos would be according to Rebbi Yosi who holds that Bein Hashemashos is until the stars come out. He suggests two solutions, either that the end of Bein Hashemashos is at the appearance of \"large stars\" (and Tosefes Shabbos is until smaller stars appear), or that the end of Bein Hashemashos is when three scattered stars appear, and Tosefes is until three adjacent stars appear in on place.</p>\n<p>The Ramban goes on to say that it would seem that this applies also to Tisha B'av. So while he does not say anything about Yom Tov other than Yom Kippur explicitly, there would seem to be no room to differentiate.</p>\n<p>This is the source for the ruling of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.293.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchon Aruch (293:2)</a>. The Ran, cited in the Beir Hagolah, is quoting from this Ramban.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.293.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Brurah (5)</a> points out that this is <em>not</em> the minimum time for Tosefes Shabbos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(ה) אלא רצופים - משום תוספת שבת. וה\"ה כשרואה ג' כוכבים קטנים שאינם רצופים וממתין מעט אחרי כן מותר לעשות מלאכה דעיקר טעם הרצופין משום תוספת וכיון שהמתין מעט הרי הוסיף [דגול מרבבה]:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the Rama (261:2) says that Tosefes Shabbos at the begining of Shabbos can begin at Plag Hamincha, and the Mishna Brurah (25) points out that according to many authorities (and this is the general practice today) this is an hour and a quarter before sunset. This is not like the Ramban. (See Beiur Halacha.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who are Gog and Magog?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been through all question titles here but nobody asks directly <strong>who are Gog uMagog</strong> (might be answered in some of them though)?</p>\n<p><strong>Specifically, in the context of Moshiach, rather than the original men/nations with this name (unless that's pertinent)</strong>. Feel free to give your opinon on which sources that discuss this are the most thorough/accepted/sensible, but any sources and what they say is the main thrust of this question, thank you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The first thing to keep in mind when considering the identities of Gog and Magog is to remember that their explicit mention is found primarily in the Prophets (Yechezkel chapter 38 and 39 and Zechariah chapter 14). Their genealogical root is also listed in Bereshit 10:2 as being descendants of Yaphet ben Noach.</p>\n<p>The importance of this idea is that the books of the Prophets were chosen by the men of the Great Assembly from among many other prophetical books because those prophecies were relevant to and applicable to each and every generation. Like with the book of Bereshit, they are paradigms and not simply historical records.</p>\n<p>So in that context, the identities of Gog and Magog can be different throughout history.</p>\n<p>This answer will be limited to the perspective of where we stand today, in terms of current events and the scope of history as explained in the Torah.</p>\n<p>Torah tradition lays out a framework for history that follows the general paradigm from the six days of Creation mentioned in Bereshit chapters 1 through 3. Like is explained in Tehillim, chapter 90 following the teaching of Moshe Rabbeinu, that framework establishes 1,000 years for each of the 6 days of Creation. That means that our current time cycle, the focus of our current state of being, is anticipated to cover 6,000 years.</p>\n<p>We currently stand in the year 5,784, which corresponds to Friday afternoon of the 6th day of Creation, erev Shabbat. Like is taught  in Bereshit, the 24 hour cycle of a single day begins from the 12 hour cycle of night and the second half of each day, meaning from sunrise, is 12 hours of daylight. So the first 500 years of each millennium is associated with night and the second 500 years with daylight. Each hour is equated with approximately 41.66 years.</p>\n<p>The complete and final redemption is equated with the onset of that first Shabbat and the <em>coming of Moshiach</em> corresponds with the 6th hour of daylight of the sixth day and the blowing of the soul into the nostrils of the already formed body of Adam HaRishon (<em>Meaning our species of human, there were other species prior to our own.</em>) which had been formed in the preceding hours of the sixth day. That hour corresponds to the year 5,750.</p>\n<p>Moshiach is destined to correct or beautify what transpired with Adam, his wife and the Nachash (a prior species of humanoid) in regard to the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and its opposite; to bring in Shabbat correctly and to celebrate it in accordance with G-d's will and commandments. In this context, it should be noted that according to the text of the written Torah (Bereshit 2:9, 2:16-17, 3:1-6) <em><strong>the specific species of the Tree of Knowledge is unknown</strong></em>. It is simply referred to as a tree.</p>\n<p>One of the best  sources for a compendium and concise discussion of this process and the details of Moshiach's coming, the events and conflicts of <strong>Gog and Magog</strong> and also <strong>Armilus HaRasha, the Prosecutor השטן הזה</strong>, <em>who is called by the non-Jewish people the Anti-Christ</em>, is <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21524&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Avkat Rochel</a> by the Rishon, Rabbeinu Makir ben Abba Mori of Lunel, Provence in southern France. This is actually a three volume book, but the first volume can also be found in almost complete form in Midrash Talpiot.</p>\n<p>Avkat Rochel lays out 10 signs or events that Torah tradition teaches on this subject that cover the first appearance of Moshiach until the complete and final redemption.</p>\n<p>The first of those signs is called <em>the period of the birth pangs of Moshiach</em> חבלי משיח, because it is compared to the pain and suffering associated with childbirth.</p>\n<p>In context, these birth pains are the tikkun made by Moshiach and his generation and are the consequence from the transgressions from Adam's wife, Chava enumerated in Bereshit 3:16. This period is also the beginning of the Wars of Gog and Magog.</p>\n<p>That the War of Gog and Magog is divided into 3 stages or time periods. In the context of the allegory of the labor pains, this corresponds to <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/stages-of-labor/art-20046545\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the 3 general stages of labor in the delivery of a human child</a>. This is like is found in Midrash Shocher Tov and elsewhere to Tehillim chapter 118:10-12 which mentions all the nations surrounding me to make war with me and afflict me, three times. This idea of being surrounded by those that want to afflict me also corresponds to <em>the physical manifestation of the contractions experienced during labor and delivery</em>, which often originate from behind and encircle the abdomen of the mother.</p>\n<p>That first stage (<em>What is called the Stage of Early and Active Labor.</em>) is described in the first 3 signs of Avkat Rochel. It describes the rise of the 3 leaders of the Axis Powers in World War II, Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito, the condition of the Jewish people at that time and their increasing level of suffering and anxiety, and the events of the Holocaust itself in detail.</p>\n<p>The second and third signs describes in graphic detail the detonation of the nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki to conclude the war in the Pacific and the resulting  black rain and severe radiation sickness that kills hundreds of thousands when they drink that rainwater to quench their parched throats from the effects of the blast. The 3rd sign explicitly connects this event to Yoel the Prophet 3:3 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְנָֽתַתִּי֙ מֽוֹפְתִ֔ים בַּשָּׁמַ֖יִם וּבָאָ֑רֶץ דָּ֣ם וָאֵ֔שׁ וְתִֽימְר֖וֹת עָשָֽׁן׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That the <strong>Pillars of Smoke</strong> are pillars in the shape of Date Palm trees דקל תמרים, which can also be described as the form as a mushroom cloud.</p>\n<p>These pillars of smoke in the shape of Date Palm trees, signaling the beginning of the Wars of Gog and Magog, harken back to the unnamed Tree(s) of Knowledge of Good and its opposite. That in keeping with the teachings of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pardes_Rimonim.25.6.2?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pardes Rimonim, Sha'ar 25, Chapter 6</a> quoting Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai in Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 51, the expression <em>the Tree of Knowledge of Good and its opposite</em> is actually referring to <strong>two distinct trees</strong>, <em>one pertains to Good (and its supervising Angel)</em> and <em>the second pertaining to <strong>the opposite of Good (and its supervising Angel)</strong></em>. Therefore, there are two bombs detonated, one at each of two locations and two separate clouds.</p>\n<p>This is also discussed in detail by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in his Tikkunim Chadashim (תיקונים חדשים לרמח״ל, תיקונא שיתין, ד״ה בשעתא דייתי גוג כו׳) which says that the light and fire of the sun (<em>a literal description of a nuclear explosion</em>) will be seen between the heavens and the earth. According to Ramchal, both Moshiach (ben Yosef) and Gog are present in the world at that time.</p>\n<p>Those bombs were detonated on August 6 and August 9, 1945. So in that historical context, you can now look for actual historical figures.</p>\n<p>As a reference point for later discussion, <strong>George H. W. Bush</strong>, the future 41st President of the United States was serving as a Naval Aviator from June 1942 through September 1945 and in the Pacific theater, where those bombs were detonated, starting in May 1945.</p>\n<p>He was released from active duty in September 1945 and enrolled at Yale University completing his Bachelors Degree in 2 and 1/2 years in 1948. It was during that time that he was initiated into the Skull and Bones secret society at Yale and assigned the secret name, <strong>Magog</strong>, which is given to the initiate considered to have the most extensive sexual experience within the society as reported in an article from Atlantic Monthly and also mentioned at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Skull_and_Bones_members\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>. It is in this sense that the Prophet adds the description of <strong>Presiding Head of Meshech and Tuval</strong>. (Yechezkel 38:1-2) נשיא ראש משך ותבל</p>\n<p>That Meshech and Tuval have a connotation of both great wealth and sexual defilement and perversion like VaYikra 20:13.</p>\n<p>His first born son, George W. Bush, who was destined to be the 43rd President of the United States, was born July 6, 1946 which means that he was conceived in October 1945, the same year that the atomic bombs were detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>\n<p>It is at this point that it is relevant to point out that linguistically in Hebrew, the letter Gimmel ג is included in the grouping known as the seven <em>Doubling Letters</em>. They are comprised of: בגדכפר״ת.</p>\n<p>This means they can either have a dagesh (a point) applied or not. When the letter has a dagesh, it has a <em>hard</em> plosive or <em>doubled</em> sound and when the dagesh is absent, the letter has a <em>soft</em> fricative sound. The Jews of Teiman still have the tradition for pronunciation of a soft fricative Gimmel. It is pronounced like the \"G\" in the name George or like the letter \"J\" in modern English. In that context, it should be noted that Gog and Magog גוג מגוג are all written with the soft Gimmel in the books of the Prophets.</p>\n<p>Returning to Avkat Rochel, the 6th sign discusses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the rise and fall of Josef Stalin and his treatment of the Jewish people</a>. With the fall of Stalin comes the revelation of Moshiach ben Yosef to the whole world.</p>\n<p>Following the analogy of the Stages of Labor, the transition from the first stage, active labor, to the second stage, the delivery of the baby, is characterized in the Torah to the special sign given to Shifra and Puah, the Hebrew Midwives, for an indication of the imminent birth of a child. That the thighs of the pregnant Mother in labor would cool, indicating danger to her physical life and her drawing close to death.</p>\n<p>The 7th sign discusses the rise of the political leader of the Jews in Israel called Armilus HaRasha. It also details the <em>second stage of the War of Gog and Magog</em> which describes Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm during 1991 which concluded on Purim.</p>\n<p>The President of the United States at that time was George H. W. Bush. It was during this time that the Lubavitcher Rebbe publicized the now famous Yalkut Shimoni on Isaiah recounting how the entire world would be drawn into a war between the King of Persia (at  that time, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Saddam Hussein</a>, the leader of Iraq who was rebuilding the ancient city of Babylon), the King of Arabia (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaber_Al-Ahmad_Al-Sabah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the leader of Kuwait</a>) and <em>Aram</em>, which the Rebbe said indicated the Super Power (רוממות) of that day (the United States) and which would be directed toward the Jews in Israel and that Moshiach would announce from the roof of the Beit HaMikdash, the message from G-d to the Jewish people to not be afraid because the time of the redemption had come!</p>\n<p>It also states that an agent from Armilus tries to murder Moshiach ben Yosef and in fact, Moshiach ben Yosef dies during this period.</p>\n<p>This attempt to murder Moshiach ben Yosef is related to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Brooklyn_Bridge_shooting\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">murder  of the Lubavitcher Yeshiva Bachur, Ari Halberstam, HY\"D</a> by the Palestinian terrorist <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2012/03/26/killer-jews-my-target/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashid Baz on the Prospect Park Bridge in Brooklyn following the Purim massacre</a> in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebron by Baruch Goldstein</a>. The passing of Moshiach be Yosef is associated with the passing of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Lubavitcher Rebbe on 3 Tammuz, 5754 (1994)</a>.</p>\n<p>In relation to the stages of labor, this is the second stage which is the period when the actual delivery of the baby occurs. The head crowns and the baby takes its first breath of life. The Torah says it is at this moment that the soul dresses within the physical body paralleling the description of the creation of Adam HaRishon in Bereshit. From this point forward chronologically, is considered <em><strong>the Days of Moshiach</strong></em> according to the Torah.</p>\n<p>This moment, when the soul (of Moshiach), which is described in kabbalistic sources, like <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21490&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Ohr HaChama by Rabbi Avaraham Azulai (Volume 2 on the Zohar, parshat Shemot 7b, beginning with the words, Rabbi Shimon stood, etc. ר״ש זקף וגו׳)</a> as the fifth level of soul, Yechidah or the Neshamah of the Neshamah, dresses in the body of Moshiach ben Yosef (who is also called Ephraim, like Ephraim ben Yosef), he becomes aware of who he is. This episode which describes  what would be called today <em>experiencing a stroke</em>, is actually detailed in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%AA%D7%90_%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%99/%D7%9C%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesikta Rabbati, chapter 36</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התחיל הקב\"ה מתנה עמו ואומר הללו שגנוזים הם אצלך עונותיהם עתידים להכניסך בעול ברזל ועושים אותך (כעול) [כעגל] הזה <strong>שכהו עיניו ומשנקים את רוחך בעול ובעונותיהם של אילו עתיד לשונך לידבק בחיכך</strong> רצונך בכך אמר משיח לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא שמא אותו צער שנים רבות הם אמר לו הקדוש ברוך הוא חייך וחיי ראשי שבוע (את) [אחת] שגזרתי עליך אם נפשך עציבה אני טורדן מעכשיו <strong>אמר לפניו רבון העולמים בגילת נפשי ובשמחת לבי אני מקבל עלי על מנת שלא יאבד אחד מישראל</strong> ולא חיים בלבד (יושיע) [יושעו] בימי [אלא אף אותם שגנוזים בעפר ולא מתים בלבד יושעו בימי <strong>אלא אף אותם מתים שמתו מימות אדם הראשון עד עכשיו] ולא אילו בלבד אלא אף נפלים [יושעו בימי] ולא אילו בלבד יושעו בימי אלא (למי) [כל מי] שעלתה על דעתך להבראות ולא נבראו (בהם) בכך אני רוצה בכך אני מקבל עלי</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The 8th and 9th signs deals with the transition from the second stage to the third and final stage of the Wars of Gog and Magog. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.97a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This transition from the 7th to the 8th sign would begin from the day of the passing of the Lubavitcher Rebbe and spans the 7 year cycle (the Shemittah cycle) which is the subject of Sanhedrin 97a</a>.</p>\n<p>In the analogy to the process of labor, this is the delivery of the placenta, the afterbirth, following the actual delivery of the child. There are still mild contractions which push the placenta out of the birth canal. This process helps to eliminate risk of infection to the Mother. In Sefer Avkat Rochel it says this is the blowing of the Great Shofar mentioned in Isaiah 27:13.</p>\n<p>It is completion of this transition that we experienced September 11, 2,001 and the bombing of the World Trade Centers in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington DC, which corresponds with the Hebrew year 5,761 exactly 7 years following the passing of the Lubavitcher Rebbe. This began under the Presidency of George W. Bush, the 43rd President of the United States. These events are recounted in the Zohar, parshat Balak 212b and the commentary Ohr Yakar of Rabbi Moshe Cordevero. As a consequence of this bombing, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began on Hoshanna Rabbah. This event, the beginning of these wars is mentioned explicitly in the Tur Shulchan Aruch. For related information, see here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/64279/7303\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/64279/7303</a></p>\n<p>This is also discussed explicitly in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chesed_LeAvraham%2C_Even_Shetiya%2C_Maayan_2.59.1?vhe=Chesed_le-Avraham_--_grimoar&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chesed l'Avraham (by Rabbeinu Avraham Azulai), section Sod HaMikvah (Ma'ayan 2: Nahar 59)</a> which states that this occurs in the year following 5,760, once the Mikvah is full and fit to eliminate the condition of Tumah (<em>similar to the effects from the delivery of the placenta in the the third stage of labor</em>). Rabbi Avraham says this time point is what is referred to in the Prophets as the time when Tumah will pass from the land (Zechariah 13:2).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָיָה֩ בַיּ֨וֹם הַה֜וּא נְאֻ֣ם ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה צְבָא֗וֹת אַכְרִ֞ית אֶת־שְׁמ֤וֹת הָֽעֲצַבִּים֙ מִן־הָאָ֔רֶץ וְלֹ֥א יִזָּכְר֖וּ ע֑וֹד וְגַ֧ם אֶת־הַנְּבִיאִ֛ים <strong>וְאֶת־ר֥וּחַ הַטֻּמְאָ֖ה אַעֲבִ֥יר מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like his father, George W. Bush continued many of the policies of his father including efforts to pressure the government of Israel to relinquish territory to the Palestinians in order to establish <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the two-state solution</a>, even dividing the Capitol city, Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>It should be noted the Heavenly response to this that occurred in 2003 with the <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/node/228017\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explosion of the Space Shuttle Columbia</a>, one of the symbols of United States wealth, power and global leadership, <a href=\"https://juchre.org/nor/columbia.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">as its trajectory passed over Palestine, Texas near the Texas home of then President Bush</a>.</p>\n<p>Avkat Rochel alludes to, among other things the expulsion of Gush Katif in 2005 (which also harkens back to <em>Pillars of Smoke</em> and <em>the Tree of Knowledge of Good and its opposite</em> through the settlements of Neve Dekalim נוה דקלים, Tel Katifa תל קטיפא and Katif קטיף) and the consequences afterward, which is what we are experiencing now. Armilus also dies during this time period and once again the entire world surrounds Israel to try to divide Israel and Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>It is in this final context that George W. Bush, the son of George H.W. Bush came to Jerusalem in 2008 trying to coerce then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert into agreeing to a two-state solution with the Palestinian Authority and dividing Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. It was during this trip that the now famous <a href=\"https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/124831\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillat Bush</a> was written and signed by the <a href=\"http://www.thesanhedrin.org/en/index.php?title=The_Nascent_Sanhedrin&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nasi of the Nascent Sanhedrin, Rabbi Adin Even-Yisroel Steinsaltz</a>, Rabbi Chaim Richman and others and presented to President Bush. It is in this scroll that President George W. Bush was specifically identified with Gog from Yechezkel the Prophet 38:1. For details of this content of this scroll, watch the following <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItuMOxMLX7s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">video from Rabbi Richman</a>.</p>\n<p>In the context of this scroll which was presented to President George W.Bush as the embodiment of Gog and Magog when he came with intent to divide the Land of Israel and its Capitol, Jerusalem, he was given a choice to be like Cyrus, King of Persia to unite the people Israel, its land and its Capitol or the opposite. He chose the opposite path and continued to pursue dividing Israel with the establishment of <strong>the Two-State Solution</strong> for the Palestinians. The consequence of that choice, as specified in the scroll, would determine both his fate and the fate of those with him, meaning his nation.</p>\n<p>The close of his Presidency in 2008 witnessed the economy of the United States plunged into one of the deepest economic collapses since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Politically speaking, the country was overturned with the election the next year of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-xTZyHTODJQ?si=btcUEg2QcYTJFvfK\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Barack Obama (who, together with his Vice-President, Joseph Biden, extended a public and open invitation to the leadership of Iran in the way of his address celebrating Nowruz</a> and its principal character, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajji_Firuz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haaji Firuz</a>, a perversion of the story in Megillat Esther and another enemy of the people Israel, Haman, the Agagite. The evil one, <em>who while leading Mordechai through Shushan, had the chamberpot filled with his wife's excrement dumped on him from the rooftop above, mistakenly, by his wife, Zeresh.</em>) who was directly responsible for the strengthening of Iran and its nuclear ambitions together with the weakening of the United States leadership globally and domestically.</p>\n<p>Only with the election of President Donald Trump and his efforts to unify the entire land of Israel and its Capitol (<em>even moving the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem</em>), did the economy and global influence of the United States improve. It is no accident that the government of Israel minted commemorative coins honoring President Trump for his help to Israel and comparing him to Cyrus, King of Persia exactly as outlined in Megillat Bush for a possible positive destiny for Gog, Presiding Head of Meshech and Tuval. In that context, it should be noted that Gog is ultimately to be given a fitting burial place in the land of Israel like it states in Yechezkel 39:11.</p>\n<p>For those who are more interested in listening to a discussion of this subject from a contemporary and prominent Rabbi who possesses great depth in Torah, this is a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ihyxHNkBlkQ?si=4H9qoud7UAzMTVAb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link to Rabbi Isser Zalman Weisberg discussing specifically the subject of the identity of Gog and Magog today</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HndlY.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HndlY.jpg\" alt=\"Megillat Bush\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If the nation of Magog in Gog uMagog is infact one and the same as the nation of the Son of Yefeth, then some sources identify them as the nation of גּוֹתִייָא, which seems to indicate the Gothics\nYerushalmi Megillah 1:9</p>\n<p>בְּנֵ֣י יֶ֔פֶת גּוֹמֶר וּמָג֔וֹג וְיָוָ֣ן וְתוּבָל וּמֶ֖שֶׁךְ וְתִירָֽס׃ גוֹמֶר גֶּרְמַמְייָה. מָגוֹג גּוֹתִייָא. מָדַי כִּשְׁמוּעָהּ. יָווָן אֱווֶסוּס</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There's an article by Rabbi Eliyahu Bahbout called <a href=\"https://meshiv.co.il/en/shelot_vetshuvot/can-russias-war-against-ukraine-evolve-into-a-gog-and-magog-war/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Can Russia’s war against Ukraine evolve into a Gog and Magog war?\"</a> where it explains, using a plethora of sources, that Russia could be Gog Magog.

I seem to recall a similar story in a kinnah describing an interruption by Crusaders (?) in the middle of Hallel on Shavuos, and was wondering if there's any connection to the Maharam's psak.  Is there any possibility that the Maharam was making a zeicher to the story and trying to emphasize the kedusha of the martyrs' unfinished Hallel?</p>\n<p>(With obvious parallels to soldiers who interrupted their Hallel to fight...)</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once permission has been granted to an angel to destroy, it does not distinguish between righteous and wicked. [Bava Kamma 60a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the default position is that the innocent perish with the guilty.

Also, Abraham had to ask God to save Sodom and Gomorrah for the sake of the righteous in it. [Gen. 18:23-32]  It was not an automatic thing.  Finally, the Talmud says, “kill him first”, without adding “but with no collateral damage”.  The Maharal concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah allows war when we are attacked, and in responding, we are allowed to not distinguish between the guilty and the innocent. [Gur Aryeh to Gen. 34:13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, warning may be given.  The Torah says: When you approach a town to attack it, you shall offer it terms of peace.[Deuteronomy 20:10] In commenting, the Midrash tells us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Shmuel bar Naḥman said: What did Joshua do [when he was about to enter the Promised Land]? He would publish an edict in every place [of the Land of Canaan] he went to conquer, on which he wrote: “Whoever wants to go, let him go; whoever wants to make peace with us, let him make peace; and whoever wants to make war shall make war.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>-The Girgashites vacated and departed from there, and the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them a land as beautiful as their native land, namely Africa.</p>\n<p>-The Gibeonites desired to make peace with Israel, and Joshua made peace with them.</p>\n<p>-However, the 31 Canaanite kings came to battle with Joshua, and the Holy One blessed be He caused them to fall.  [Deut. R. 5:14]</p>\n<p>Likewise, King Saul advised the Kenites to leave their homes to avoid being harmed in the war with Amalek:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, otherwise I might destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the people of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.”  So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites... And Saul defeated the Amalekites... [1 Samuel 15:6-7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Saul was prepared to endanger civilians in the course of war, and he was not censured for this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Not a full answer but we can infer from the <strong>Mizrachi</strong> his opinion on this matter.</p>\n<p>The Torah tells us that Yaakov was very afraid of Eisav (<strong>Genesis</strong> 32:8). <strong>Rashi</strong> (ad loc.) explains that he was afraid that he would kill, or be killed. The <strong>Mizrachi</strong> (ad loc.) is bothered, that why was he afraid to kill? He's allowed to kill in self-defense!</p>\n<p>He suggests that Yaakov was afraid of killing the 400 men that were with Eisav. He says if they were being forced by Eisav to accompany him, they were innocent civilians. Yaakov was afraid of killing them in self-defense, for it would be forbidden to kill them, as they were being forced against their will to attack Yaakov.</p>\n<p>He ends up rejecting this approach, for if the men were being forced to attack Yaakov, they should have given up their lives rather than kill someone to save their own life. Since they were unjustified in \"innocently\" attacking Yaakov, he would have been allowed to kill them in self-defense.</p>\n<p>I heard from <strong>Rav Tzvi Berkowitz</strong> of Ner Yisroel that if it were a situation where they were passively endangering someone's life, like a human shield, we can infer from the <strong>Mizrachi</strong> that it would be forbidden to kill them, even in self-defense.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Gur Aryeh</strong> ad loc. says similar to the <strong>Mizrachi</strong>, but the <strong>Yefeh Toar</strong> to <strong>Bereishis Rabbah</strong> 76:2 questions the <strong>Mizrachi</strong>'s premise.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The only rules in the Torah about treatment of the enemy are</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don't cut down fruit trees while besieging.</li>\n<li>Offer the enemy the opportunity to flee or surrender and be enserfed.</li>\n<li>Special rules about capturing a woman but there is a dispute about what they actually are.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is no Geneva convention or anything like it.</p>\n\n\n",

Intellectually, I know that Hashem has a reason and we have to accept it, but after the recent horrors that Hamas have perpetrated, these fears have suddenly been brought much closer to home.</p>\n<p>I look at my family and think about the victims. Any illusions of security have been shattered. We can't know that any of us is safe anywhere. We can daven and do teshuva and give tzedakah and do other mitzvos, but it isn't long since Yom Kippur and many of the recent victims will have done a lot of that.  Ultimately, we sometimes have to accept that Hashem's plan includes things that seem horrific to us even if we can't understand why, but I find that so difficult to do in practice.</p>\n<p>Have we messed things up so badly that Hashem is going to take away the incredible gift of Israel again?</p>\n<p>Just to clarify, this is not so much a problem of emunah in Hashem as practically being able to accept Hashem's plan.

And when they reached the point where the tefillin is placed on the head, the angels screamed out, \"Stop - זו תורה, וזו שכרה? (such Torah, such reward?)\" (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.61b.10?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 61b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.29b.5?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos 29b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Machzor_Yom_Kippur_Ashkenaz%2C_Musaf_for_Yom_Kippur%2C_The_Ten_Martyrs.16?vhe=The_Metsudah_Machzor._Metsudah_Publications,_New_York_-_Heb_(paragraph_ed.)&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machzor Yom Kippur</a>) Hashem responded by telling the malachim to cease with their protests, explaining that if He were to stop, He would have to turn the world back to nothing, to uncreate it!</p>\n<p>The Vilna Gaon explains what this response means through a mashal - a parable. Imagine a very wealthy man hires the best tailor to make him a bespoke suit. He buys the most luxurious roll of silk, and the tailor starts taking his measurements. The tailor tells him to return in two weeks, and he works day and night to make something truly special. The man returns and sees the most magnificent suit. When he tries it on, it fits like a glove. Upon arriving home, he shows his wife with a proud smile. Yet, whilst his wife commends him on a truly beautiful suit, she irately comments, \"You paid all that money, and the tailor has only used a fraction of the material!! He's going to sell on the rest of it and make a fortune!!\" Seeing the truth to his wife's words, he storms back to the tailor, calling him a cheat and liar. When the tirade is over, the tailor calmly takes back the suit and starts ripping the seams. As the man watches on in despair, he begins to see the additional folds that were not visible in the finished suit. It was only when the tailor completely ruined the suit, did the man see that all the material that was supplied had been used in the making of the suit.</p>\n<p>Explains the Vilna Gaon, Hashem was telling the malachim and ultimately us, if we want to understand why G-d acts why He does - you simply won't understand. It would mean ripping the world apart just to show you why. Sadly, there are no answers, it is part of a much bigger plan.</p>\n<p>The Chofetz Chaim brings down that when the brothers came to Egypt, they could not understand how their situation had descended to such a degree, how dire the scenario had become. However, the Viceroy then responds, \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.45.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אני יוסף</a>\" and it all became clear. They could see how and why everything played out as it did. In much the same way, the Chofetz Chaim writes, there will be a point in time when we will all hear, \"I am Hashem\" and it will all become clear. All those situations in our lives, which we have struggled with, will now make sense.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.3.1?vhe=Daat_Shemot_Rabbah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah</a> notes how Moshe Rabbeinu struggled with this concept. He cries out, \"הראני נא את כבודך\" - \"Please show me Your Honour\" - why is it that good people have to suffer or have bad lives? It is tragic it doesn't make sense?!</p>\n<p>Hashem responds by explaining (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.33.20?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 33:20</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹ֥א תוּכַ֖ל לִרְאֹ֣ת אֶת־פָּנָ֑י כִּ֛י לֹֽא־יִרְאַ֥נִי הָאָדָ֖ם וָחָֽי</p>\n<p>You cannot see My face, for a human being may not see Me and live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it is impossible to truly understand. Not even someone as holy as Moshe can comprehend why G-d acts as He does.</p>\n<p>And G-d says further (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.33.23?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 33:23</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַהֲסִרֹתִי֙ אֶת־כַּפִּ֔י וְרָאִ֖יתָ אֶת־אֲחֹרָ֑י וּפָנַ֖י לֹ֥א יֵרָאֽוּ</p>\n<p>Then I will take My hand away and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chofetz Chaim says that sometimes G-d brings such unspeakable suffering, and we simply cannot understand why. However, there will be a time when it will all make sense, and our job is to have emunah in the Ribono Shel Olam. Our job is to recognise where everything comes from.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jewishlink.news/rabbi-elimelech-biderman-belongs-to-us-all/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaRav Elimelech Biderman</a> shita in his <a href=\"https://sephardic.org/weekly-perasha/hashem-leads-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Torah Wellsprings</em> (Bereishis 5784)</a> provides a very beautiful <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Exodus.22.6.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim HaKadosh</a> on the verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 22:6</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאין לך שעה ורגע שאין ה' עושה פעולה עם האדם בין בבחינת גופו בין בבחינת צרכיו</p>\n<p>There isn't an hour or a minute that Hashem isn't doing something for man:\neither for his body or for his needs.\" Hashem is with us, always, and therefore, we need not be afraid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then adds a beautiful mashal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A story is told of a person who was walking through a forest, frightened from the wild animals, and he sees two sets of footprints beneath him.

    "content": "# Halacha of national mourning\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After the recent tragedy in Israel, I feel like every day is like how I should feel on Tisha B'Av.  Most of the day I can feel tears close to the surface, thinking about the victims, remembering the stories I've read of what happened and the pictures of the families, individuals, children.  It feels wrong for life to continue, to sit and eat a meal, to relax and find enjoyment.  Intellectually, I know that life must go on and the Rabbonim haven't decreed a fast day or anything, but it feels broken and I feel like I don't know what the process is, what's appropriate now and what isn't.</p>\n<p>After my father passed away a few years ago, I followed the halachos of aveilus, including shiva, shloshim and the 11 months of kaddish and restrictions.  I knew what to do and what not to do, what was considered appropriate and not.  I feel like with this situation, I need something similar, a halachic framework to process it in.  I know that we should look for what we can do positively in terms of practical help, mitzvos, introspection, teshuva etc, and I'm trying to, but I'm thinking more in terms of whether there should be restrictions on normal life and what is appropriate to feel at this time.  This kind of event is not new in our history, so what sources are there for how to deal with this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If you haven't already, please see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/137334/what-should-one-do-to-help-israel-during-war\">What should one do to help Israel during war?</a>.</p>\n<p>We are all dazed and struggling to find the words. We also don't want to just say nothing, so I guess I will make an attempt, for me, and if it happens to speak to anyone else...</p>\n<p>Did you know that we are not allowed to ever listen to any music<sup>1</sup>? This is part of a series of halachot that we are commanded in to ensure that we are always mourning.</p>\n<p>So, we are already always mourning, for the recent tragedies and those that are past. If our leaders ask us to take upon ourselves extra mourning like fasting and <em>teshuva</em>, then that is our <em>avodah</em>. As you have said, they have not done so (some Rabbonim have been organising <em>selichot</em>). This might be because they are looking back at the Yom Kippur War, and our leadership at the time told us to not fast, but rather to continue doing the <em>avodah</em> of Tishrei: be <em>b'simcha</em>.</p>\n<p>Being <em>b'simcha</em> is a real <em>avodah</em> right now, because it is so hard<sup>2</sup> - yet it is so vital. Your opening paragraph captures the feelings of all of the nation and that proves how hard it is. In the merit of this <em>avodah</em>, and the <em>tzara</em> it takes to perform this <em>avodah</em>, as well as the additional learning, mitzvot, prayer, tzeddaka and chesed, we can tangibly help the situation. Literally, a learning a pasuk can save a life! I would argue that being b'simcha can also save a life. If everyone you know is crying, what can make you have hope? But if there is even one person who is able to be positive, optimistic, unwavering and reassuring, they will light up everyone around them and that also can literally save lives.</p>\n<p>This is anecdotal but I will say I've heard it dozens of times now from Jews everywhere around the world. The very moment they stood up and started helping each other was the moment they were able to cope and deal with the trauma. For some the chesed will be going and packing food, or helping someone with their baby, or shopping for batteries and blankets for the IDF. For others it is additional Torah and mitzvot, <em>kavana</em> and tefillot. We are all obligated to inspire each other, especially our bretheren in Eretz Yisrael, with courage and hope.</p>\n<p>We are not victims<sup>3</sup>, we don't rot in <em>yi'ush</em>, and we feel the fear without letting it paralyse us, so let's keep the mourning in our hearts and carry on, until our leaders tell us otherwise. Let's just get up and do what our nation does best: <em>serve</em>. Time to serve each other, our brothers in danger, our family and friends, and our God. This will accomplish more than any amount of mourning can accomplish, and will show the world how bright a light unto the nations we really are, who never give up hope that the mourning will end forever.</p>\n<p>Chazak Ve'Amatz!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

And this is right: it is absurd. We are a miraculous nation, who Hashem describes <em>every individual</em> as to Him like the only child to elderly parents. We are not learning and saying tehillim out of begging, but out of the conviction that we are mighty, and we are giving our might through learning and davening to tangibly helping our nation, and the world.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I read your question just after I saw the announcement for a TA'ANIT TZIBBUR: A DAY OF COMMUNAL FASTING.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://info.hadar.org/taanit-tzibbur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://info.hadar.org/taanit-tzibbur</a></p>\n<p>As you will see, those involved have an array of halachic outlooks.</p>\n<p>And if you were already inclined to fast, then doing so together with members of the broader Jewish community can only be for the better.</p>\n\n\n",

Or to stay awake learning Torah so we become weak the next day.</p>\n<p>An excited \"Baal Tshuvah\" might be experiencing this Yetzer Hara. They should know what is \"too much\", but also don't do \"too little\". It is a hard balance.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong></p>\n<p>The Rambam and many others explain that to find the \"middle road\" which is desirable (ie: to not be extreme) one (who is accustomed already to an extreme) sometimes must push themselves beyond the middle and relax into the middle road. For example a stingy person might need to spread too much money (beyond the normal charity) to accustom himself, and then to stop and relax into the middle road.

See for example Yirmiyahu 29:14.</p>\n<p>The Rambam rules clearly, that it will be Moshiach who will gather us, and that we are not the ones who will do that. Refer to Hilchos Melachum U'Milchamos, chapter 11:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the future, the Messianic king will arise and renew the Davidic dynasty, restoring it to its initial sovereignty. He will build the Temple and gather the dispersed of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yitzchok Weiss, the Spinker Rebbe quotes the Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 56:2), which quotes the posuk in zecharyah 9:9. The Spinker Rebbe comments on this Midrash that we need to \"sit\" in exile, e.g. We are not meant to hasten the geulah. We are not meant to force the end so to speak. Why not? Because Moshiach is the one who we are waiting for (Chakal Yitzchak, Parashas Vayeira, p. 40). We are not to go up without the donkey, e.g. Melech HaMoshiach, who will come and gather in the Jewish people from exile.</p>\n<p>See also the newspaper called HaPardes <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=12083&st=&pgnum=9&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(HaPardes No.11, v. 5 1937, p. 9)</a> where some great rabbi's of that time warned that the ingathering during 1948 would be not in line what the Torah teaches us, and that it goes straight against our belief that Moshiach will take us back.</p>\n<p>Refer to Uvdos VeHanhagos Lebeis Brisk (vol. 4, p. 195) where it says that we must hold on to our faith that it is Moshiach who will pick us up and bring us to EY.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צריך להתחזק ולהאמין שהגלות נגזרה עלינו מאת השי\"ת ולחכות בסבלנות שהוא\nיתברך יגאלנו ויושיענו ע\"י משיח צדקנו ולעמוד בנסיונות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chofetz Chaim, Chofetz Chaim Al HaTorah, Parashas Bo, p. 99, said, according to what his son Rabbi Leib Kagan heard, that when the English Government signed the Balfour Declaration, there was an awakening for the Geulah in Shamayim, but the opportunity was taken away by the people involved in it. Says the Chofetz Chaim \"they don't wait for G-d anymore\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‎ליותר הם לא מחכים אוי מה הי' לנו והמשיך לבכות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cited in Uvdos Vehanhagos Leveis Brisk, vol. 4, p. 207 but I have a physical copy of Chofetz Chaim Al HaTorah here in front of me (p. 100, footnote).</p>\n<p>So according to the above, it will be Moshiach who will gather us and not otherwise around. We are not meant to force the end and \"do the job for G-d\". We are meant to, to cite the Midrash and the Spinker Rav, sit in exile until Hashem takes us out of here and returns us to Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n<p>The Rambam rules clearly about this, but this could also be found in <a href=\"https://www.truetorahjews.org/qanda/sources\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a plethora of locations throughout the Tanach</a> and Talmud/Midrash.</p>\n\n\n",

There was a monastic sect called the Essenes.  There were Christians and followers of other would-be Messiahs.  Many Jews were Hellenized or Romanized, secular in their outlook, while others exhibited very intense religious fervor.  There were Jews who opposed an uprising against the Roman occupiers, and among them were spies and collaborators.  And there were many Jews who encouraged an uprising, among whom three different factions of Zealots, or <em>kana-im</em>.</p>\n<p>The difference between what caused the fall of the First Temple and what caused the fall of the Second Temple is that in First Temple days, the people sinned out in the open, then repented.  In Second Temple days, the people sinned in their hearts, and did not repent.  Rashi says that the Second Temple sinners practiced wickedness clandestinely.  The Maharsha adds that they harbored senseless hatred in their heart, but in public they ate and drank in a congenial manner with those they hated.</p>\n<p>The Sources also offer definitions.  Rashi says that “senseless hatred” is hatred of people who have not committed any action justifying the hatred. [Rashi on Shabbat 32b]  So when does the hatred make sense?  You may bear ill will towards someone if you witnessed him engaging in an act forbidden by the Torah. [Pesaḥim 113b]  However, you must assist him quickly, before assisting those you love [so that the ill will does not turn to hatred.] [Bava Metzia 32b] Now, how do you know that you have reached the point of hatred?

Especially in the beginning. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Abarbanel_on_Zechariah.14.16.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">posuk 16</a>, it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All who survive of all those nations that came up against Jerusalem\nshall make a pilgrimage year by year to bow low to the Supreme G-d of\nHosts and to observe the Feast of Booths.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Abarbanel_on_Zechariah.14.16.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel (ad loc.)</a> and the Mashmiah Yeshua (ad loc.).</p>\n<p>HaRav Moshe Lichtenstein wrote an detailled article explaining the connection between the Haftara of Shabbos Chol HaMoed and Sukkos. He <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/holidays/sukkot/war-god-and-magog-haftara-shabbat-chol-ha-moed-sukkot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In light of this, let us go back and discuss the connection between the haftara and the festival of Sukkot. Just as the deliverance of Israel in the war to be fought in the end of days is presented in the two prophecies from two different perspectives, so too the sukka can be understood as protecting Israel from two different perspectives. On the one hand, the sukka provides an answer to the human problem of a person in need of protection and shelter from heat, cold, and rain. It provides shade and cover to one who needs them, and in this way it protects the person in need of protection. From the time of the exodus at the beginning of Jewish history and until the war to be fought in the end of days, G-d spreads His protection over His people and shields them by way of the sukka. \"For in the day of evil He shall hide me in His sukka; in the covert of His tent He shall hide me\" (Tehillim 27:5). Man is in need of protection and the sukka given to him by G-d provides him with the required shelter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, the sukka is the site of the Shekhina's presence in the world, whether as a place protected by God as His own space, like the clouds of Glory that shielded Israel by way of the Shekhina's presence within them, or by the very presence of God in this world, which finds expression in the sukka. \"In Shalem also is His sukka, and His dwelling place is in Zion\" (Tehillim 76:3). The Torah readings for Shabbat Chol Ha-mo’ed focus on the idea of God's appearance to man, just as the essence of the festivals lies in the idea of standing before God. For this reason, the prophecy dealing with the war to be fought against Gog and Magog, in which God will reveal Himself as He fights against the wicked, fits in well with this system and reflects another dimension of the war to be fought in the end of days that is connected to the festival of Sukkot</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My understanding of this is that the reason why Sukkos is connected to Gog uMagog, is that in the \"final war\", G-d will give us shelter, a protection, like the clouds of glory in the midbar.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.625.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Orach Chaim, siman 625:1. See also the Tur, ad loc.)</a> explains the deeper meaning behind this shelter of the sukkah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Succot we shall dwell for 7 days etc. Because on Succot I protected the children of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another reason why Sukkos is connected with Gog uMagog, might be because both will fall in the month of Tishrei, as the Alter Rebbe writes in his <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4685156/jewish/Shulchan-Aruch-Chapter-490-The-Order-of-the-Prayers-Recited-on-the-Second-Day-of-Pesach-the-Prayers-Recited-on-Chol-HaMoed-Pesach.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav (490:16)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Shabbos falls during Chol HaMoed Pesach, [Yechezkel’s vision of] the dried bones should be read as the Haftarah. On the Shabbos of Chol HaMoed Sukkos, [the prophecy of] the war of Gog and Magog should be read as the Haftarah. [These readings were chosen] because the Resurrection of the Dead will take place in Nissan and the war of Gog and Magog will take place in Tishrei.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Refer also to the sefer <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53226&st=&pgnum=34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Zeman Simchateinu\" (Maamar 2, p. 28):</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכיון דנתבאר בדברי הגר\"א שהובא לעיל מאמר א אות ב רכל תוכן ענינו של חג הסוכות הוא כנגד בנין המשכן שכתב בביאורו לשיה\"ש והג' הוא נגד סוכות שהוא זכר להיקף ענני כבוד שהיה תלוי בבנין המשכן כידוע' א\"כ כמו שבנין המשכן הוא יום שמחת לבו של הקב\"ה כיון שהוא בחינת החופה שבין הקב\"ה לישראל גם המועד של סוכות שהוא כנגד בנין המשכן הוא זמן שמחתנו' ונתיחד בשמחה יתירה כמו שבנין המשכן הוא יום שמחת לבו של הקב\"ה וזה באמת עצמו של יום זה שהוא זמן שמחתנו' כיון שהוא הזמן שנקבע כנגד יום שמחת לבו' של הקב\"ה בהשראת השכינה במשכן ולפיכך נתיחד חג הסוכות בשמחה יתירה יותר מכל המועדים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, this doesn’t yet explain why the אד that came down didn’t help to make everything grow?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I just heard a nice dvar Torah related to this:</p>\n<p>The point is, Gd wanted Adam to pray for the grass. But first, what grass was he praying for?</p>\n<p>Do you think Adam was “spawned” into Gan Eden and it was a barren wasteland and desert? Did it really have no trees or plants, and he had to pray for it? No, of course it had vegetation, this was the <em>garden</em> of Eden remember. The Torah explicitly says rivers were flowing in and out of the garden, so clearly it didn’t need rain. So what was Adam praying for if the garden had vegetation?</p>\n<p>He was praying for <em>outside</em> of the garden which had no plant life. Gd gave Adam the ability of speech, and his first words were praying for outside of the garden. He wasn’t praying for himself, he was praying for other people as if. And as the Maharsha writes regarding the story of Rabbi Chanina Ben Dosa praying for Ribaz’s son in Berachot, “sometimes other people’s prayers are more powerful than your own.” Man’s whole ability of speech was davka to be able to do chesed for others, to pray for other people.</p>\n<p>So I think to answer your question, the אד didn’t water the plants so that this lesson could be demonstrated. So that the first words spoken by man would be for chesed, for helping others but himself</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>So, my Rebbi from Yeshivas Bais Yisroel, HaRav Moshe Lehrfeld shlita answered as follows:</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.2a.11?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis</a> tells us on the Posuk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ולעבדו בכל לבבכם\"</p>\n<p>And serve him with all you heart (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 11:13</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a reference to prayer and that's why the next verse continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְנָתַתִּ֧י מְטַֽר־אַרְצְכֶ֛ם בְּעִתּ֖וֹ יוֹרֶ֣ה וּמַלְק֑וֹשׁ</p>\n<p>I will grant the rain for your land in season, the early rain and the late.

However, since rain is always unexpected, the only key to bring it is with tefilla.</p>\n<p>With this, we can understand that there was rain before Adam was created but it simply wasn’t capable of making everything grow. Which rain contains that power? Rain that comes through tefilla. That’s why Rashi explains that Adam had to recognize the importance of rain to be able to bring it through his tefilla.</p>\n\n\n",

Why was this so? Because they did not have informers (a negative term suggesting that they denounced others) amongst them. Therefore, they went out to war and won.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Peah.1.1.46?vhe=Mechon-Mamre&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Peah 1:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי אבא בר כהנא דורו של דוד כולם צדיקים היו וע\"י שהיה להן דילטורים היו יוצאים במלחמה והיו נופלים...אבל דורו של אחאב עובדי ע\"ז היו וע\"י שלא היה להן דילטורין היו יורדים למלחמה ונוצחין</p>\n<p>Rabbi Abbah son of Kahana said, the generation of Dovid were all righteous, but because there were informers among them, they went to war and were falling...But the generation of Achav who were idol worshippers did not have informers, descended to war and were triumphant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How does specifically not speaking lashon hara act as a protection?</p>\n<p>Is it literally the case, that when a person speaks lashon hara it creates a קָטֵיגוֹר (a prosecutor) in shamayim (heaven) against that person?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I don't have a source for this, and this is perhaps more of a practical answer than a spiritual one, but lashon hara is particularly divisive - it creates hatred and distrust between people and sinas chinam, which is the opposite of what we need, especially during a war.  Soldiers require trust in each other to function effectively as a unit/army, and to feel very positive about the nation who they are defending to have the motivation to put their lives on the line to save others.</p>\n<p>What we're seeing now is a sudden reduction in sinas chinam and a massive improvement of ahavas chinam and achdus.  The sad thing is that it has taken an event like this for us to achieve it, but I do think that it is middah k'neged middah in a way as we were attacking each other and now we have been attacked.  IY\"H this improvement in our behaviour will be a merit for success in rescuing the captives, utterly destroying our enemies and achieving a lasting peace, and that this should be a permanent change rather than us going back to fighting internally when things calm down again.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yaarot_Devash_I.15.10?vhe=Yaarot_Devash_--_OYW&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yaaros Devash, Drush 15</a> explains how it works, and starts by bringing the midrash cited in the question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בדורו של שאול היו צדיקים אלא שהיו בעלי לשון הרע ולא הצליחו במלחמה אבל בדורו של אחאב היו בעלי עבירה ועבודה זרה רק לא היו בעלי לשון הרע ולכך הלכו במלחמה ונצחו וא\"כ א\"ש דאמר לו מפיבושת לא עליך אני כועס כי אתה באת בשלום וא\"כ הוכחת דע\"כ לא קבלת לה\"ר דאל\"כ לא היית מצליח במלחמה דזהו עונש לה\"ר להיות נופל בחרב מלחמה אמנם על מי אני כועס על מי שהביאך בשלום דהוא יודע כי באמת קבלת לה\"ר וא\"כ לא היה לו להצליח כעונש בעל לה\"ר ראו כמה גדול עון לה\"ר אפילו בעלי עבירות כדורו של אחאב לא היה דבר שהיה להרשיע המלחמה כי אם לשון הרע ו<strong>הטעם כי בהסתת הנחש היה נעשה להט חרב המתהפכת לרוע ולטוב ולכך בשומרם עקב רב מבלי לעשות ואינם בעלי לשון הרע ואז חרב נהפכת עליהם לטובה לעשות באויביהם נקמה ואם תפשו מעשה נחש אזי החרב נהפכת לרעה לעשות בהם כלייה ולכך נצחון המלחמה תלוי בלשון הרע וכל השומר פיו מלשון הרע כובש החרב המתהפכת ולכך נאמר (תהלים קמט ו) רוממות אל בגרונם וחרב פיפיות בידם לעשות נקמה כו'</strong> וכבר אמרו כל דיבור שיוצא מפי אדם עושה רושם ובעו\"ה אדם מפטפט כל היום בדברים ואינו מרגיש שבכל דבר עושה רושם עד שאמרו חז\"ל (סנהדרין קב ע\"ב וכן במו\"ק י\"ח) <strong>ברית כרותה לשפתים</strong> ואיך לא ישמור אדם מבטא שפתיו על כל דבר פשע</p>\n<p>In the generation of Shaul they were righteous but they spoke lashon hara and were not successful in war, but the generation of Achav were sinners and idol worshippers however they did not speak lashon hara and therefore they went to war and were successful. Indeed, didn't Mefiboshes say, \"I am not angry with you because you came in peace, and if so, you have proven that you did not accept slander, because if not, you would not have succeeded in the war since this is the punishment for slander - to fall by the sword of war. However, who am I angry with? The one who brought you in peace, since he knows the truth about accepting slander, and if so, he would not have succeeded as a punishment for slander, see how great the sin of lashon hara is, even for those who are sinners like the generation of Achav, there was nothing to condemn the war other than lashon hara. <strong>And the reason is that by inciting the snake (i.e. speaking lashon hara), a sword would become flaming that turns to evil and good, And for this reason, their safekeeping has a lot to do without doing it; and if they are not slanderous - then the sword turns to good for them to take revenge on their enemies, and if they caught the act of a snake (i.e. they speak lashon hara), then the sword turns to evil to wreak destruction, and thus the victory of the war depends on lashon hara, and anyone who guards his mouth from lashon hara conquers the overturned sword and this is why it is said (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.149.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 149:6</a>) \"The lofty praises of G-d are in their throats, and a double-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance etc.\"</strong> And they have already said that every word that comes out of a person's mouth makes an impression. And nowadays a person chatters all day about things and does not feel that he is making an impression in anything - until the sages said (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.102a.2?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 102a</a> and similarly <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.18a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moed Kattan 18a</a>) - <strong>\"A covenant is made from the lips\" (i.e. what one say impacts on future events)</strong> and how can a person not keep his lips from uttering anything sinful?!...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it appears from Rav Yehonasan Eibshitz that the act of saying lashon hara effectively sways the balance of war. If G-d decrees that one side is due to succeed but lashon hara is spoken, then the \"sword\" of war, so to speak, reverses and has the opposite effect. We can't underestimate the power of words, especially as he brings from Chazal, that it can huge ramifications in future events.

    "content": "# Why is the akeida called - the akeida of Yitzchak (named after Yitzchak)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why is the akeida called - the \"akeida of Yitzchak\", after Yitzchak (and not, for example, the akeida of the son of Avraham) even though Avraham was the active one, he received the commandment and it was his experience, and it is possible that Yitzchak did not even know that he was going to be sacrificed and in fact was not active in the akeida?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First of all, the term \"עקידה\" - \"Akeida\" means \"binding\". Whilst it was indeed Avraham's nisayon (test), practically, Yitzchak was the one who was bound.</p>\n<p>Secondly, Yitzchak was not a child at the time - he was 37 years old (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.25.20.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi - Bereishis 25:20</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=enhttps://www.sefaria.org/Seder_Olam_Rabbah.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Olam Rabbah 1</a>), as such he was able to intuit what was going on and was then fully aware and submitted himself to both his father and G-d.</p>\n<p>According to the Midrash - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.56.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 56:8</a>, the binding was a request that came straight from Yitzchak as he was worried that if he would move, he might render the sacrifice invalid:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דָּבָר אַחֵר, אָמַר רַבִּי יִצְחָק בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁבִּקֵּשׁ אַבְרָהָם לַעֲקֹד יִצְחָק בְּנוֹ, אָמַר לוֹ אַבָּא בָּחוּר אֲנִי וְחוֹשֵׁשַׁנִי שֶׁמָּא יִזְדַּעֲזַע גּוּפִי מִפַּחֲדָהּ שֶׁל סַכִּין וַאֲצַעֲרֶךָ, וְשֶׁמָּא תִּפָּסֵל הַשְּׁחִיטָה וְלֹא תַעֲלֶה לְךָ לְקָרְבָּן, אֶלָּא כָּפְתֵנִי יָפֶה יָפֶה, מִיָּד וַיַּעֲקֹד אֶת יִצְחָק, כְּלוּם</p>\n<p>Another matter, Rabbi Yitzcḥak said: When Avraham sought to bind Yitzchak his son, he (Yitzchak) said to him (Avraham): ‘Father, I am a young man, and I am concerned that my body will tremble due to fear of the knife, and I will [thereby] upset you, or perhaps the slaughter will [thereby] be rendered unfit and it will not be counted for you as a valid offering. Therefore, bind me very well.’ Thereupon, “he bound Isaac his son.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

They said to Him: ‘This man, what is his nature?’ He said to them: ‘His wisdom is greater than yours.’ He brought the animals, the beasts, and the birds before them and said to them: ‘What is its name of this one?’ And they did not know. He passed them before Adam and said to him: ‘What is the name of this one?’ <strong>He said: ‘This is an ox; this is a donkey; this is a horse; this is a camel.’ [He then asked:] ‘And you, what is your name?’ He said to Him: ‘It is appropriate that I be called Adam, as I was created from the ground [adama].’ [He asked further:] ‘And I, what is My name?’ He said to Him: ‘It is appropriate to call you my Lord [adonai], as You are the Lord [adon] over all your creatures.’</strong> Rabbi Aḥa said: “I am the Lord, that is My name” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.42.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 42:8</a>) – that is My name that Adam the first man called Me.

This is bewildering; why, in fact, did He not create her for him at the outset? The explanation is that the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that he [Adam] would complain about her in the future; therefore, He did not create her until he requested her explicitly. After that, “the Lord God cast a deep slumber…” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 2:21</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The first <em>recorded</em> words of Adam are found in the Torah, Genesis 2:23:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Adam said, “At last, this one is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.

The discussion that follows is for hydroponics grown solely in a liquid.)</p>\n<p>As others pointed out, the mainstream halachic approach is that it is forbidden. Rav Falk, in the Machzeh Eliyahu @dov linked to above is an excellent approach to the sugya. That being said, it's clearly not classic harvesting. What follows are some highlights from the sugya.</p>\n<p>The gemara in Shabbos appears to address this question, and provides a unique source for a prohibition on harvesting from liquid: Abaya taught (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.108a.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 108a</a>) that pulling a mushroom from a moist surface is prohibited because he is being עוֹקֵר דָּבָר מִגִּידּוּלוֹ. (Uprooting something from its place of growth). The continuation of the gemara makes clear that this is only a problem because mushrooms naturally grow on moist surfaces (הַיְינוּ רְבִיתֵיהּ )\nThe gemara there juxtaposes three types of actions and includes them under the same category of עוֹקֵר דָּבָר מִגִּידּוּלוֹ. First, aborting a cow fetus, Second, harvesting hops (a parasitic plant) and finally harvesting mushrooms. The Ramban in shabbos has an explantion of the gemara that explains these are all not \"classic harvesting\" but forbidden under the broader category of \"uprooting.\" [But see the Meiri there who understands this as a broad definition of \"classic harvesting\"]. If I recall correctly, based on this Ramban, Rav Shlomo Miller has a teshuva limiting the prohibition to plants that naturally grow in damp (like mushrooms or sprouts). That being said, most poskim take this prohibition so far as to prohibit pulling flowers out of a vase. They argue that the water/plant food is nurturing the flowers and pulling them out is harvesting (See e.g. Nishmas Shabbos 241).\nIn summary, harvesting hydroponics is forbidden. However (according to the Ramban and most others), it's never classic harvesting \"kotzer\", it's a sub-prohibition of kotzer called עוֹקֵר דָּבָר מִגִּידּוּלוֹ\nwhich has different rules.  The only heter that I would rely on is that if you have plants in a nutrient bath, and the flow of the water is stopped before shabbos and the water drains by itself, picking up the plants would not be a prohibited act.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone have a source for this information?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Far be it for this Brit to criticise his favourite country after Israel: USA. Rather, this is something I heard from my American Rabbonim in Yeshiva, and have expanded slightly to fit with my own learning since.</p>\n<p>They taught me that (and yes, it's a bit of a joke, but we all know Whose joke it is) America, transliterated into Hebrew (אומה ריקה) translates as \"empty nation\". What does that mean?</p>\n<p>The answer is that they are the spiritual inheritors of Esav, whose <em>klipa</em> is the <em>klipa</em> of attraction to superficiality; the most basic function of the <em>yeitzer hara</em> (indeed <em>Sar shel Esav</em> is the same angel).</p>\n<p>It's not that they are evil, not at all. It's just that Esav's way of approaching everything, even holiness, is to be superficial about it. In <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58836&st=&pgnum=102\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chassidus</a> (as explained <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCk_AAIu-E8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), we learn this difference between Esav and Yaacov. Esav wanted to bring Moshiach quickly, by \"sweeping all the dirt under the rug so the place looks clean\". Yaacov said, you can't do that. The dirt is still there, on the inside, behind the superficial, where you can't see it, but the world is still unholy and the only way to make it holy is to take the time and hard work over millennia to make the world and it's inhabitants holy down to the essence.</p>\n<p>Esav's ideological legacy is inherited by the West according to a few sources, and America is the center. In Torah, we say that the superficial is only there to serve the essential. We marry our spouse because of our spouse, not their looks. Once we are into the person, then, <em>because <strong>they</strong> are important</em>, everything about them becomes important <em>as a result</em>. Every hair on their head.</p>\n<p>Esav's <em>klipa</em> (literally \"peel\", the most superficial part of the fruit), is that there may or may not be an \"essential\" side to things; an unseen depth that is the reality at the core, but their focus is on the superficial.</p>\n<p>For example, a Torah true Jew will never find \"fashion\" interesting, it's so nakedly superficial, so the children of Israel have never put any importance into it at all, and in fact distance themselves from it to a large degree. Esav on the other hand is absolutely fine with it. If a person wants to make fashion mega important or even dedicate their whole life to it; <em>power to them</em>! he says. <em>It's your <em>right</em>, it's a <em>free country</em>, there's nothing wrong with it, go nuts! Don't let anyone tell you that you can't be a good person because of that!</em></p>\n<p>It's funny, because sometimes you can see the incoherence of this. <em>Racism is an evil of the superficial: a person is judged by their superficial traits and that's considered absolute abhorrent! Why? Because it's superficial!</em> A person is more than his skin colour, says Esav (as you can see, his <em>klipa</em> isn't opposed to goodness or Moshiach - is very much in favour actually)! However, without realising it, they will then take the victim of racism they just defended and the perpetrators they just educated and encourage them all to just go ahead and follow their heart and find one of the many \"not evil\" superficialities to make into their god. <em>Become a movie star, or a collector of video games, or just settle for a nice house in a nice neighborhood and that's your whole life accomplished. #YOLO; be obsessed with external beauty, sex, parties, money, cars, vacations, superficial love and relationships, entertainment, tasty food, etc etc they say, just don't be racist or sexist! Those are superficial!</em></p>\n<p>In Torah, we make the deep and the essential the main, and unashamedly define superficiality as \"emptiness\". It's the only way to fix the world. The body has a soul and it is more real than the body. The soul is delicate and sensitive and must be carefully focused on, in a very personal intimate way, to protect it and cultivate it. It can take a lot of time and effort and usually involves self regulation and denial, limited distractions by the superficialities of life; exposure to them in a controlled way after being raised to appreciate them in their correct context - which is never one that is simply following the heart.</p>\n<p>Now, does this apply to America and the west? Well, it's too simple and narrow an explanation to account for the huge diversity of nations, states and individuals in this huge region, but perhaps we can see that there's more than a kernel of truth in it, in the bigger picture.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The 10th Month Is Obviously Teves!\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.13a.20?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilah 13a</a> - we bring down a פסוק from the מגילה which says:</p>\n<p>“So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tevet” (Esther 2:16).</p>\n<p>Why did the פסוק have to mention \"tenth month\" & \"Teves\"?</p>\n<p>Couldn't it just have said one!?!?!</p>\n<p>These are extra words!!!!!!!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The sefer <em>Yesha Elohim</em> asks your question, and brings the answer that it was meant from shamayim that Esther should be taken to Achashverosh in the 10th month because the 10th month is Teves, in which <em>haguf nehene min haguf</em> - i.e. that the body has pleasure from the warmth of another body. This concept is brought by the Gemara itself in Megillah 13a, and Rashi there (d\"h שהגוף נהנה מן הגוף) explains that the hana'ah is the body heat from another body. So the <em>Yesha Elohim</em> is saying that the ribuy of \"<em>הוא חודש טבת</em>\" comes to tell us that Esther was taken specifically in the month of Teves in order to have her find favor in Achashverosh's eyes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>במסכת מגילה (מגילה יג.) אמר רב חסדא ירח שהגוף נהנה מן הגוף ע״כ הנה שהוקשה לו כי אחר שאמר בחודש העשירי <strong>מאי אתא לאשמועינן שהוא חדש טבת</strong> דזיל קרי בי רב הוא. אלא <strong>בא ללמדנו שמן השמי׳ כוונו שאסתר תלקח בחדש העשירי למה בשביל שהוא חדש טבת ויש טובה והנא׳ בירח זה במה שהגוף נהנה מן הגוף</strong> בו והוא לסיבה שבכל החדשים האחרי׳ ישתנו מזגי וטבעי האנשים כי יש אנשים שטבעם חם או קר ולא יהנו מן הגוף ההפכי לו אדרבא יצרו צעדי אונם אבל בירח הזה אפי׳ שיהיו גופים הפכיים ונגדיים זה לזה נהנים זה מזה כ״ש ירח שהגוף נהנה מן הגוף יר׳ איזה גוף שיהיה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning To Say: If the pasuk had said just \"בחודש העשירי\", you would think it just happened to be in the 10th month = Teves, that the pasuk is just telling you when it occurred. The ribuy of \"הוא חודש טבת\" is to tell you that it wasn't stam that it happened in the 10th month, and to emphasize that the reason for it happening davka in the 10th month is because the month of Teves being a month in which הגוף נהנה מן הגוף.</p>\n\n\n",

They blast the sound in the way it sounds like a wailing, instead of the accepted practice of short sounds that sound like crying.</p>\n<p><strong>Shofar blast sound</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The accepted practice of the teruah shofar blast is like the sound of crying, i.e., short, broken sounds. The Yemenite custom is like wailing, such that the sound is not truncated but trembles and rattles, and all the tremors are considered one sound. Upon examining we find that the teruah in Ashkenaz and Sephard is similar to an outburst of crying, which is truncated uncontrollably, whereas the teruah in Yemen is like a wailing which is done as an expression of crying and mourning in a controlled manner, as is customary among Yemenite immigrants, to have greater control over emotions (Peninei Halakha: Yamim Nora’im 4: 11).</p>\n<p>The Yemenite immigrants also are accustomed to raise the tekiah and\nthe teruah at the end, and one who pays attention understands the\nintention is to express in the tekiah the height of joy, and in the\nteruah, the height of sorrow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Kosher Grasshopper</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flying insects are forbidden to eat, including all species that have three pairs of legs and wings, including wasps, bees, flies, crickets, mantis and grasshoppers. Only four species of grasshoppers are permitted by the Torah, and they have two signs from the Torah, and two signs from the words of our Sages (Leviticus 11:20-21; Chulin, 59a). However, in all the communities the tradition was lost with regards to grasshoppers, and only in Yemen and Morocco, where grasshoppers were prevalent, was the tradition maintained regarding the kosher grasshopper, which is the locust that multiplies in huge flocks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Torah reading on Shabbos and the weekday</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When our Sages enacted that seven people be called up to the Torah on Shabbat, and three on a weekday (Megillah 21a), they intended that each person called to the Torah would read the Torah himself. However, since the days of the Rishonim, in order to prevent embarrassment and unpleasantness of those who do not know how to read well, the custom is to appoint a “baal koreh” who would read the Torah for everyone, and the called-up person would only recite a bracha on his aliyah.</p>\n<p>However, the Yemenite immigrants, to this day, still practice the\nancient custom in which every person reads the portion when he is\ncalled-up to the Torah. The observance of this custom is one of the\nreasons for the proficiency of many Yemenite immigrants in Torah and\ngrammar (Peninei Halakha 22: 5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Taken from the <a href=\"https://en.yhb.org.il/the-customs-that-survived-thanks-to-yemenite-jews/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article \"The Customs that Survived Thanks to Yemenite Jews\"</a></p>\n\n\n",

Thanks, sources for claims are very valuable and appreciated</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I would recommend the sefer called \"The Divine Commandment\" by Rabbi Moshe Weiner. I have been told for Chabad, it is considered \"The Shulchan Aruch for Noahides\" .</p>\n<p>To answer your question what a Noahide cannot observe, refer to what Rabbi Weiner <a href=\"https://asknoah.org/faq/going_beyond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gentiles are especially forbidden to perform commandments that require the holiness of a Jew, such as writing a scroll of the Torah or a mezuzah or phylacteries (tefillin in Hebrew).\nThe general rule is that any Jewish mitzvah between man and man, or between man and G-d, which has a reason and a logical benefit for a person or society, is permitted for Gentiles to perform. But this does not apply for any commandment that does not have a logical, natural benefit, but is rather a sign for the Jews (e.g., wearing ritual fringes [tzitzit] or phylacteries, or affixing a mezuzah on a doorpost), or is a G-dly statute for the Jews without reason or benefit understood to a person [as to logically how and why the ritual would bring any natural benefit]. A Gentile should be prevented from performing such commandments and should be taught that it is improper for him to observe them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara also explains that a Noahide can study Torah in-depth, but only with regard to subjects on the seven Noahide laws. Also, Shabbos is one of the mitzvos, they should not observe.</p>\n<p>Besides that, as @Dov wrote in his answer, Noahides have the seven Noahide laws which they should observe.</p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https://asknoah.org/faq/going_beyond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">summarize</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In summary, Gentiles should first and foremost understand and follow their Seven Noahide Commandments that G-d requires of them, for which the reward granted to the Torah-faithful pious Noahides is a place in the future eternal World to Come. With this commitment, a Gentile should start learning and keeping the Seven Noahide Commandments in the proper way, as they are explained within the Torah Law received by Moses from G-d at Mount Sinai. Under the guidance of an Orthodox Rabbi or mentor, this can certainly include the study of Chassidic discourses and teachings that are relevant to the Noahide Code. A good additional observance to begin following is to give properly directed charity, and to give often [even daily, and even if it is only a small amount that is dropped into a charity can or box in one’s home].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the famous question regarding Torah study and being a Noahide, please see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/97340/27180\">this</a> question and the answer(s) there. In the Hebrew equivalent of \"The Divine Code\", sefer  שבע מצות השם (Chapter 3, p. 36 sv. איסור חידוש דרג והוספת מצוה) the basis for this prohibiton is that Torah is the \"morasha kehilas Yaakov\", the inheritance of the Jewish people. It is forbidden to teach a Noahide Torah that is not about the Seven Noahide Laws. Refer to <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/gentiles-learning-torah-may-one-teach-torah-to-a-gentile/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>With regard to saying berachos - blessings - the sefer Sheva Mitzos Hashem (Chapter 6, sv. עבודת השם תפלה וברכת המזון , p. 74) says that although Noahides are not obligated to say a beracha, there is nevertheless no objection in thanking G-d for granting him food to eat, or to drink. He should thank G-d that he can partake in the meal etc..</p>\n<p>Furthermore it says that it is appropriate to request from G-d that what he eats or drinks, will sustain him and be good for him. So yes, in some sense, a beracha could be made by a Noahide.</p>\n<p>The Hebrew version is available on <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/143243/p/1/t/2476287881234/fs/xzuZxqrmNFDibzdchHyutjgRx5FwJvdywu7w8jTsc6X0/start/0/end/14/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otzar HaChochmah</a>.

(By the way, if you are a fan of practically embedding mussar - it's a really good read!)</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hakhsharat_HaAvrekhim.9.51?ven=The_preparation_of_the_Avreichim,_translated_and_Annotated_by_Betzalel_Edwards,_2022&lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">9th perek</a> he first talks about how to wield mastery over your soul. This starts by</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בהסתכלות אודות הרגש שנתעורר לך</p>\n<p>By looking at the emotion that will arise in you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, he says, imagine two plates of meat are brought out - one you absolutely love and find really delicious, and the other you're not so fond of. He says to go with the meat you don't really want as a means to train your soul to overpower the lust/craving from the yetzer hara.</p>\n<p>He then goes on to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hakhsharat_HaAvrekhim.9.52?ven=The_preparation_of_the_Avreichim,_translated_and_Annotated_by_Betzalel_Edwards,_2022&lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">say</a> if a person is so incredibly gripped with a desire for certain foods, he needs to train himself in how to beat this lusting, and it all stems from the mind. He recommends that you take yourself out of the scenario and look at it from an outside perspective. You have to reason with your mind that you are not about to die from starvation, and you will continue to function just fine without it. It is about learning to mentally fight the desire. If one repeatedly practices this rhetoric it trains the mind to withstand the temptation of food:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הבט עלי׳, וחזור דברים הללו פעם ושתים וכו׳, ותראה ותתפלא איך בעזהשי״ת תתחלש תאוותך אף תמס לגמרי. כה תעשה בעניני אכילה וכה תעשה גם בשאר תאוותיך, אף בדיבור איזה ענין אף של רשות שאינו עבירה, אבל טוב יותר שלא תדבר אותו, ומ״מ מתגרה אתה לדבר אותו, הבט עליך ועל גרויתך באופן כזה</p>\n<p>Look at me, and repeat these words once, twice, etc., and you will see and be amazed how in the end, with Hashem's help, your lust will weaken and even melt away completely. This is how you act in matters of eating, and this is how you do in the rest of your desires as well, even in idle speech, which is not a sin, but it is better not to do it. Such idle speech is something unnecessary that irks and compels you, so look at it and its temptations with this method.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>I am also reminded of the Taanis Raavad which is similarly about learning how to wean oneself off an inherent desire for food.</p>\n<p>He suggests a stage-by-stage process. Firstly, to leave over a little bit of one food on your plate. After mastering this, try and do it with two foods on your plate, until you can do it with every item on the plate. Once mastered, you then need to aim for leaving over the favourite part of the given food e.g. the cherry on the top of the cake, the most cheesey patch of the pizza etc. The idea being that you become a master over food and not the other way round.</p>\n\n\n",

In truth, it was not he who set the goal. Rabbi Schneur Zalman, executed the project that his own teacher, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dov_Ber_of_Mezeritch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi DovBer “the Maggid” of Mezeritch</a>, had charted for him. The following passage—which appears in the introduction to the Shulchan Aruch ha-Rav, signed by Rabbi Schneur Zalman’s three sons —is illuminating:</p>\n<p>Since the needs of the Jewish people are many, especially in these difficult times, with rising expenses and the encumbrance of earning a livelihood burdening each individual—with his soul he acquires bread—and they have little mind to engage in lengthy study of the sea of Talmudic and legislative sources, to know the source of the law and specifically rulings with their justification. Even great scholars who have ability and fame for their knowledge of the Talmud have difficulty arbitrating between the various legislative authorities when studying to derive a final ruling in agreement . . . for in most areas there are divided opinions . . .</p>\n<p>Therefore, from heaven it was decided, via the aforementioned holy rabbi [Rabbi DovBer, the Maggid of Mezeritch], to search assiduously amongst his disciples to find an individual with the spirit of G‑d within him and the capacity to understand and to ordain clear legislation . . . to organize all the established laws that are recorded in the Shulchan Aruch and all the later authorities in concise language, with reasoned justification. He chose his honor, our holy master and father [Rabbi Schneur Zalman], and urged and persuaded him, saying, “There is no one with understanding and wisdom like you, able to descend to the depth of the halachah and do this work, a work of holiness, to bring to light the concise essence of the reasons for the rulings mentioned, including all the words of the earlier and later authorities, refined sevenfold, each matter in its correct place without confusion and muddle, arriving at the conclusive ruling that becomes clear and emerges from the words of all the legislators until the scholars of today . . .</p>\n<p><strong>In short, there are three fundamentals that Rabbi Schneur Zalman had in mind as he set to work on his Shulchan Aruch: organization (“without confusion and muddle”), explanation (“the reasons for the rulings mentioned”) and arbitration (“the conclusive ruling that emerges from the words of all the legislators”)</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>See more there for further detail</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

If someone were to rip open a potato chip bag, for example, this would be permitted because the cutting is destructive in nature and because one is not doing so for the sake of cutting, but rather to access the food inside. If one cuts paper for a constructive purpose, however, the Mishna Berura (O.H. 340:41) explains that one would be liable for both acts of Kore’a (tearing) and Mechatech. Thus, cutting aluminum foil or plastic wrap is not permitted on Shabbat, and certainly not cutting precise sizes or shapes so as to properly cover food.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It also serves the purpose of saving (the woman) from a state of Agunah. But it is good that the bride and groom see and get to know them better, if there is a worry that from their nature, such a condition will cause discord and quarrels between them G-d forbid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So essentially, this clause bestows authority upon a Beis Din, enabling the implementation of its judgments within the realm of civil law. Therefore, if a Beis Din determines that a husband must provide a גט, the wife has the option to approach the civil court to compel her husband to fulfill his commitment to the arbitration agreement. This procedure should not be considered undue pressure, as the civil court is merely upholding the Beis Din's decision.</p>\n\n\n",

I have <a href=\"https://www.eichlers.com/karyana-deigrata-3-volumes-hs29434.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> volume of Kiryana D'Igarta, is it included in here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Steipler spends a good part of the first section on the third volume discussing voting.</p>\n<p>Refer to the third volume <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/162779/p/16/t/0.46243899611147521234/fs/WSKXnBsMXQDwa2diGye6UNHWE2jCWXaltXCsghgOrrpS/start/0/end/7/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which addresses the notion of voting in Knesset elections in general.</p>\n<p>There he mentions that by voting for the chareidi parties it is a big mitzvah, and it is an obligation, as it is both public and beneficial to the existence of the religion - all of which are echoed in the extract you bring:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בעיקר הדבר כך דעתי העניי' נוטה שמצוה רבה להצביע לרשימה החרדית ושיש בזה ממש הצלת הדת לפי המצב כעת כי בעניני שמירת התורה לא שייך בטחון בלא השתדלות והחובה לעשות כל הנראה באופן טבעי טוב ומועיל לקיום הדת</p>\n<p>Mainly this is the way it is, in my opinion, the matter tends to be very commanding to vote for the Chareidi (ultra-Orthodox) list and that there is actually a saving of the religion according to the current situation because in matters of keeping the Torah there is no security without effort and the duty to do what is apparently good and beneficial to the existence of the religion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Because the entire generation of the flood did not survive and Noah was in the ark and if he had opened the door would his ark have been flooded.</p>\n<p>And also that he didn't have the leisure to watch the beam outside since he had to feed all the animals throughout the day.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who could testify to these situations?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your question deals with one of the \"ikkarim\" of our faith. One of the principles of the Jewish faith. What is it? Well, the Rambam (Maimonides) says that we need to believe in the divine origin of the Torah and that G-d gave it to us. Refer to <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/332555/jewish/Maimonides-13-Principles-of-Faith.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his introduction to perek Cheilek</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, refer to the famous introduction of the Ramban (Nachmanides) on the Torah. He <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis,_Foreword.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משה רבנו כתב הספר הזה עם התורה כולה מפיו של הקב\"ה. והקרוב שכתב זה בהר סיני, כי שם נאמר לו: \"עלה אלי ההרה והיה שם, ואתנה לך את לוחות האבן והתורה והמצוה אשר כתבתי להורותם\". כי 'לוחות האבן' – יכלול הלוחות והמכתב, כלומר עשרת הדברות, ו'המצוה' – מספר המצות כולן, עשה ולא תעשה. אם כן, 'והתורה' – יכלול הספורים מתחילת בראשית, כי הוא מורה אנשים בדרך בענין האמונה.\nMoses our teacher wrote this book of Genesis together with the whole Torah from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He. It is likely that he wrote it on Mount Sinai for there it was said to him, Come up to Me unto the mount, and be there; and I will give thee the tablets of stone and the Torah and the commandment which I have written, to teach them. The tablets of stone include the tablets and the writing that are the ten commandments. The commandment includes the number of all the commandments, positive and negative. If so, the expression and the Torah includes the stories from the beginning of Genesis [and is called Torah — teaching] because it teaches people the ways of faith.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, to summarize, how do we know that the mountains were covered with the water? Well, simply put, because G-d told Moshe that it happened, and we must believe that this is the divine truth.</p>\n\n\n",

From regular people on the street, to news organizations, to government officials, it is present in all layers of society. I don't think there's any other ethnic/national/religious minority on Earth that this can be compared to, making the Jewish people unique in this regard. There is also no rational explanation that would account for the scope, ferocity, and how innate and deep seated this hatred seems to be.</p>\n<p>Personally I find this to be an even stronger argument/proof for Judaism than the Kuzari argument and others. This phenomenon of \"Eisav soneh l'Yaakov\" just doesn't really \"make sense\", and can only be explained in a suprarational and supernatural way, and it's openly observable by anyone (who's willing to look around without bias).</p>\n<p>Have there been emunah arguments of this sort made historically in Rabbinic literature?</p>\n\n\n",

If this is the case, wouldn't that mean that when we daven for Moshiach we are davening for extremely difficult times? (Granted they are followed by the salvation of everyone). We see from other places that the final war will be devastating like Zechariah 14 (talking about gog umagog):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָסַפְתִּ֨י אֶת־כׇּל־הַגּוֹיִ֥ם ׀ אֶֽל־יְרוּשָׁלַ֘͏ִם֮ לַמִּלְחָמָה֒\nוְנִלְכְּדָ֣ה הָעִ֗יר וְנָשַׁ֙סּוּ֙ הַבָּ֣תִּ֔ים וְהַנָּשִׁ֖ים\n(תשגלנה) [תִּשָּׁכַ֑בְנָה] וְיָצָ֞א חֲצִ֤י הָעִיר֙ בַּגּוֹלָ֔ה\nוְיֶ֣תֶר הָעָ֔ם לֹ֥א יִכָּרֵ֖ת מִן־הָעִֽיר׃  For I will gather all the\nnations to Jerusalem for war: The city shall be captured, the houses\nplundered, and the women violated; and a part of the city shall go\ninto exile.

But now I'm asking a practical question: Is there anything wrong with making matzah in home in your regular oven? Here's one description of what I've tried, how it would look:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First run my oven on self-cleaning cycle, which seems to be acceptable to prepare it for (regular) Pesach use, according to the Star-K and perhaps others.</li>\n<li>My oven goes up to 550 F (288 C). (Igros Moshe (OH 153) says that the cooking surface needs to be ליבון קל, which is < 500 F which burns paper, and that the cooking device should surround the matzah, not just be on the bottom. The oven seems to meet those requirements.)</li>\n<li>Take out the bottom grate inside to make room. Preheat it to that temperature. Put a wide (18\") piece of tinfoil on the bottom of the oven so that it is hot already when the matzah goes in.</li>\n<li>Take shemurah matzah flour and מים שלנו. (Of course, when I'm practicing it's with (probably chametz) flour off the shelf and water from the sink.)</li>\n<li>Knead one single cup of flour and around 5 tbsp water, quick as I can, roll it out with a clean rolling pin.</li>\n<li>Use a fork to make holes in the matzah (there are better faster tools available).</li>\n<li>Put it on another piece of tinfoil to help carry it, and put that on top of the hot tinfoil in the oven. (The poskim discuss baking matzah on paper which will burn up, and say that the paper not being hot won't matter, it's too thin and too quick. I assume the same is true of tinfoil.) It is now doubly separated from the oven floor in case something goes wrong.

Jews did that for centuries. Kudos for thinking this through a bit. A few tips from many years of baking at home:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I suggest buying firebrick from a masonry supply store and after kashering the oven, line the bottom of the oven with them. These will hold heat much better than the thin metal on the bottom of an oven</li>\n<li>I'd practice at least once with shmurah flour. It behaves very differently than supermarket flour.</li>\n<li>Weigh your ingredients. Crispy matzah typically has very low hydration (last year's flour required 46% -- meaning that 100g of flour only needed 46g of water).</li>\n<li>Parchment paper is your friend. Roll out on parchment paper and/or between pieces of parchment paper. It will help reduce sticking to the rollers and rolling surface.</li>\n<li>A fork works great.</li>\n<li>For transfer to the oven, buy a thin wooden dowel from a hardware store. Drape the matzah on the dowel and \"unroll\" it onto the firebrick.</li>\n<li>Suggest using disposable for nearly everything (bowls, plastic table surfaces, forks, etc.). Except for the rolling pins (and dowels). These worked well: <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B082WF6MG2\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082WF6MG2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1</a> Be sure to sand, rinse, and dry thoroughly.</li>\n<li>Matzot will bake in much fewer than 10 mins (4-5 min in a home oven IIRC)</li>\n<li>Review all halachot ahead of time. Little things like \"don't bake near windows/sunlight\" and \"prepare dough in a different room than the oven\" and things like that.</li>\n<li>Make a \"pre-flight\" checklist. It's easy to forget a critical step, and a checklist prepared ahead of time is helpful for making sure you're not missing a step.</li>\n<li>Involve a friend or two. It's a lot of work, and it can be easier with helpers.</li>\n<li>Involve children in halachically permissible ways. Under bar/bat mitzvah are more limited in what they can do, but it is an amazing experience for them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm not a Rabbi, but I've been cooking matzah for half a decade now. I also have a strong bias AGAINST using things that are disposable. Most of our people for most of our history could never afford disposable cookware or cutlery. So if they were able to make matzah without it, then it shouldn't be considered an extreme opinion that we should be able to as well.</p>\n<p>Everything you've stated is fine but I think you are still over-complicating things. Matzah was never supposed to be complicated, it was supposed to be the easiest and quickest of breads. In Europe and the Middle East they used to pay out of work women, elderly, and children to bake matzah because of how simple it is. Now we've reversed and say only the most learned of us should ever even attempt. So I'll go through your points one by one to see if I can add anything useful to the discussion and simplify things.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>First run my oven on self-cleaning cycle, which seems to be acceptable\nto prepare it for (regular) Pesach use, according to the Star-K and\nperhaps others.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds great. Everything should be kashered for Pesah</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>My oven goes up to 550 F (288 C). (Igros Moshe (OH 153) says that\nthe cooking surface needs to be ליבון קל, which is < 500 F which burns\npaper, and that the cooking device should surround the matzah, not\njust be on the bottom. The oven seems to meet those requirements.)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no minimum temperature for ovens. Actually one does not need an oven, one can cook directly on the coals of a fire or on a ceiling tile heated by a fire. In my experience matzah is simpler to make on a hot cooking surface such as a saj (overturned wok), or cast iron skillet, pizza stone, etc. Pizza Ovens are also great and even Nusach Teiman sells a double sided electric oven with bread pillow they recommend for matzah at home.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IYiPCH1W.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IYiPCH1W.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Relying only on hot air moving around in a European oven to cook matzah dries it out.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Take out the bottom grate inside to make room. Preheat it to that\ntemperature. Put a wide (18\") piece of tinfoil on the bottom of the\noven so that it is hot already when the matzah goes in.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As others have mentioned I would recommend a pizza stone. I think tinfoil will be too thin to adequately hold and pass on heat to make matzah cook faster</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Take shemurah matzah flour and מים שלנו. (Of course, when I'm\npracticing it's with (probably chametz) flour off the shelf and water\nfrom the sink.)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I disagree that regular flour is \"probably\" chameitz. At best I'd call it \"doubtful\" or \"questionable\" hameitz. The \"tempering\" done in our days is raising humidity in huge silos, a far cry from boiling wheat berries as was the practice of everyone during the times of the Gemera and poskim.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A second reason is offered by Rabbi Moshe Heinemann, STAR-K’s Rabbinic\nAdministrator. He posits that there is an ironclad scientific basis\nfor considering tempered grain to be safek [not actual] chometz.\nMillers need the grain to be dry enough to mill efficiently and they\ntherefore set the moisture level of incoming wheat to no more than\n14%. Mr. Dengler points out that wheat that arrives at their mill with\na higher moisture content is routinely rejected. When wheat has been\nproperly dried, either in bins at grain elevators or at the farm, it\nis very stable and can be stored for very long periods of time without\nany germination – in some cases, even for years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/13298/controlling-your-temper/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/13298/controlling-your-temper/</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Knead one single cup of flour and around 5 tbsp water, quick as I\ncan, roll it out with a clean rolling pin.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do not recommend kneading as quick as you can. This leads to halakhic complications such as gebrochts and other issues down the line. One should knead the dough until it's ready and has enough water. Do NOT add additional flour to make it nonstick. For making matzah you can always add water, you can't always add flour. Every batch of flour comes with differing levels of hydration so the amount of water needed will always vary slightly</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Use a fork to make holes in the matzah (there are better faster\ntools available).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Completely unnecessary and I believe takes away from \"this is the matzah we ate...\" we originally made matzah in haste, and definitely didn't take time to poke holes in it. We also no longer use molds to make matzah decorative even though it doesn't add much time for the same reason of we are supposed to make it in haste. For those worried about \"swelling/נפוח\" please see the comments</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Put it on another piece of tinfoil to help carry it, and put that\non top of the hot tinfoil in the oven. (The poskim discuss baking\nmatzah on paper which will burn up, and say that the paper not being\nhot won't matter, it's too thin and too quick. I assume the same is\ntrue of tinfoil.) It is now doubly separated from the oven floor in\ncase something goes wrong. [Addendum - they allow paper <em>b'dieved</em> for\nthat reason, but don't seem to allow it lechatchilah.]</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most sepharadim cook on a hot surface and use a bread pillow for transporting the dough such as this: <a href=\"https://karoutexpress.com/product/bread-pillow-for-saj/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://karoutexpress.com/product/bread-pillow-for-saj/</a></p>\n<p>When I first started making matzah I built my own tandoori oven and made my own bread pillow using some rags rolled up, covered them by a 100% cotton cloth. you put the bread on the pillow and you can slap it onto your hard surface. To \"kasher the pillow\" you then touch the pillow to some other part of your hot surface to burn up/cook whatever microscopic bits of dough that stick to the cotton. Then after you're done baking for the day you take off the cotton cloth and throw in the washing machine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>At this point around 10 minutes have passed, since I'm not so\ncompetent.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if you spent all day kneading it would not reflect on your competency. When I teach others to bake I always have them work in pairs, one person always kneading and the other does the baking. This satisfies all opinions and helps prevent accidents. But often the kneader is kneading for well over 10 minutes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>It now takes around 10 minutes to bake. See the linked discussion\nabove that that time should not matter.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>10 minutes to bake seems like a long time. I wonder if your tin foil is not \"thick enough\" to hold and transfer the heat well to reduce cooking time. I return to the suggestion for a pizza stone. Not that you need to cook faster, but you would probably also get more consistent cooking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Pull the matzah out using the tinfoil.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds fine</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Clean everything thoroughly. Add new tinfoil in oven if you want\nto make another matzah.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems quite wasteful but it'll work. People often want to start with a new fresh clean surface for each matzah, but as long as your pizza stone/saj/oven maintains its temperature then any crumbs or leftover bits of matzah won't be hameitz.</p>\n\n\n",

This would be distinct from someone working on Boeing airliners when Boeing also makes warplanes - I assume this would be entirely permissible. Let's also say that this is a field such as engineering or design that is critical to the operation of military devices. This would be distinct from something like human resources which doesn't directly impact the technologies at all.</p>\n<p>What, if any, halachic concerns would arise from someone working in such an industry? I can think of some areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working on offensive weaponry (and therefore possible complicity in murder?)</li>\n<li>Using your talents to support warfare instead of doing good for the world</li>\n<li>Ethics of the (US?) defense industry in general</li>\n<li>Chilul HaShem maybe?</li>\n<li>Any issues with getting security clearance?</li>\n<li>Would things change if I was working for the IDF/an Israeli contractor?</li>\n<li>Would things change if I was a lot more tangential to the process, such as working in HR or office maintenance?</li>\n<li>What if these weapons were to be used against Jews? Do I need to be concerned with the potential of opposing military groups to have Jewish soldiers? How far removed do I have to be from this, e.g. if the US is fighting a proxy war? (For example, if there are Jews in the Russian army and the US is fighting them, or aiding the Ukrainian army in doing so)</li>\n<li>Do I have to be concerned about collateral damage?</li>\n<li>What happens if this technology gets into the hands of our enemies?

What if it's peacetime for the US but not for Israel, such as the situation as of posting time?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now I have seen answers that one could fight for their country in a war, so I am assuming that would apply to this as well, especially since I wouldn't be risking my life here. If one could risk their life and actively kill for a non-Jewish country, then kal v'chomer one could merely be a bit player in weapons manufacturing.</p>\n<p>But I am curious what practical things would apply in this case.</p>\n\n\n",

But it also holds out a remedy that all those who are <em>written in the book</em> will find refuge.</p>\n<p>The three year break between the Akeidah of Yitzchok and his marriage to Rivkah was to allow for a necessary period of maturation. This corresponds to the three year break between the beginning of the final redemption and <em>Days of Moshiach</em>, which coincided with the first Gulf War in 5751 and the <em>histalkut</em> of the Rebbe and murder of Ari Halberstam in 5754.</p>\n<p>The different terms for refinement used in the Zohar have connotations of both refinement, improvement and unification.

<strong>gazelle</strong> or a young stag,\nover the hills of spices!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That the term דּוֹדִ֗י is understood to be a reference to Moshiach ben David with the full spelling being דויד. This unusual spelling is alluding to the point when Moshiach ben David and Moshiach ben Yosef are made one, like is mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.37.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 37:19</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דַּבֵּ֣ר אֲלֵהֶ֗ם כֹּה־אָמַר֮ אֲדֹנָ֣י יֱהֹוִה֒ הִנֵּה֩ <strong>אֲנִ֨י לֹקֵ֜חַ אֶת־עֵ֤ץ יוֹסֵף֙</strong> אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּיַד־אֶפְרַ֔יִם וְשִׁבְטֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חֲבֵרָ֑ו <strong>וְנָתַתִּי֩ אוֹתָ֨ם עָלָ֜יו אֶת־עֵ֣ץ יְהוּדָ֗ה</strong> וַֽעֲשִׂיתִם֙ לְעֵ֣ץ אֶחָ֔ד <strong>וְהָי֥וּ אֶחָ֖ד בְּיָדִֽי</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This also follows the teaching of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_ben_Pesah_Ostropoli\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimshon of Ostropoli</a> in his commentary to Sefer Karnayim, chapter 14 as well as the teaching of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vilna Gaon</a> from Sefer Kol HaTor who explains that the gematria of משיח בן יוסף משיח בן דויד is 1000.

And this is with the intention we’re merely trying to have them accept Orthodox theology and be mildly more observant, full observance not being immediately expected.</p>\n<p>Which points should generally be brought up, because often when I’ve been to Reform and Conservative synagogues they seem to not understand almost anything about what Orthodox Jews believe and think.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>From my personal experience, discussion with others and much reading, I find that the crucial turning point is when a Jew realizes that \"Torah is actually and entirely true\",  i.e., it comes from God, has an unbroken chain of transmission to us through generations of interpreters, contains instructions/commands for all Jews, and needs to be taken seriously. Many serious non-observant Jews don't really see it this way, they see the Torah as a wise text that needs to be modernized or can be picked from.</p>\n<p>Once someone shifts towards \"this is all true, I need to observe all of it, and even if I'm not there today, I need to work to learn and observe more\", then the person starts on a journey towards observance.</p>\n<p>But these journeys are highly personal and often the product of long reflection & learning. They don't occur as a flash following one discussion. As such, you need to moderate your hopes to \"switch on\" people in one go. The most one can do is plant a few good questions, suggest further reading or discussions with experienced outreach professionals and be an attentive ear and supportive friend on the journey.</p>\n<p>You also need to realize that people are frightened of change, wary of giving up things they like, worried of how they will look towards family and friends. These are very high obstacles to conquer.</p>\n<p>I find that suggesting or offering books is an effective non-threatening starter on a journey of <em>tshuva</em>. Here are a few suggestions.

    "content": "# Jews attending feast of Achashverosh\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is well known that Mordechai had warned the jewish people not to attend the feast of King Achashverosh, and nevertheless, many did attend.</p>\n<p>Under what permission did those Jews attend? Is this discussed anywhere? Were there rabbis who did permit the Jews to attend?\nSeemingly, if there was kosher food for the Jewish attendees, they had some concern for halacha, does this mean they had found a loophole or a heter in allowing themselves to attend?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Under what permission did those Jews attend?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The simple answer - they did not have permission...</p>\n<p>The whole thing was orchestrated by Achashveirosh - It was a ruse to show the people he cared about them and valued both the high-ranking and low placed civilians of Shushan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.1.5?lang=bi&p2=Malbim_on_Esther.1.5.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim 1:5</a>), but really it was motivated to lead the Jewish people to sin. (e.g. see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.12a.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 12a</a>)</p>\n<p>Once they arrived, he ensured that things like wine were bountiful especially due to the Persian custom to drink quite heavily out of big goblets - nothing was forced etc. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther_Rabbah.2.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther Rabbah 2:13</a>).</p>\n<p>As far as food, the Yad Hamelech (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Valerio\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Shmuel Valerio</a>) suggests the Jews ate both non-kosher food and wine. It did not come from a place of coercion as Achashveirosh wanted the Jews to sin of their own volition - i.e. it had to be set up as a scenario of \"אין אונס\" - non-coerced sin and thus liable to punishment (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6929&st=&pgnum=19&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). Also see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.7.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim Rabbah 7:8</a> which writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִם כֵּן לָמָּה בָּאוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּסָפֵק בִּימֵי הָמָן, רַבָּנָן וְרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן יוֹחָאי, רַבָּנָן אָמְרֵי עַל שֶׁעָבְדוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים, וְרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן אָמַר עַל שֶׁאָכְלוּ מִתַּבְשִׁיל הַגּוֹיִם.</p>\n<p>If so, why did Israel’s existence become uncertain during the days of Haman? The Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, the Rabbis say: Because Israel engaged in idol worship. Rabbi Shimon said: Because they ate from the cooked dishes of the gentiles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as what you ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Were there rabbis who did permit the Jews to attend?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Gallico\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Elisha Gallico</a> in his peirush on the Megillah <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11835&st=&pgnum=35&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (starting top line) suggests that Mordechai was the only Jew in Shushan not to participate in the feast - in other words the Megillah takes pains to introduce Mordechai as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִ֣ישׁ יְהוּדִ֔י הָיָ֖ה בְּשׁוּשַׁ֣ן הַבִּירָ֑ה</p>\n<p>There was a Jewish man in Shushan the capital (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.2.5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther 2:5</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to teach you that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שלא נשאר ביהדותו וכשרותו שלא נהנה מסעודתו של אותו רשע</p>\n<p>There did not remain anyone who in his Judaism and Kosher-state that did not benefit from the meal (feast) of that evil one (i.e. Achashveirosh)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like you say, he warned them not to attend, but his exhortations fell on deaf ears.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Meaning of \"Atarah\" in Sefer HaKana Chapter 45\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sefer HaKana contains the following excerpt (selected from Chapter 45, Paragraph 8). Hebrew text is from Sefaria, translation is myself and my chavrusa, parentheses are our commentary and translation notes. Emphasis mine. Disclaimer: neither my chavrusa nor I are especially qualified to write this translation and we will be seeking experienced individuals to help us refine it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לתקוע ב' תקיעות ולהכניס הקשה והרפה ביניהם לבל יכה שרב ושמש, כי התרועות\nבמקום א' עולות והם של כסף לרמוז בהם עמה ברחמים, אבל בר\"ה צריכין לעמוד\nבדין ולהזכיר כל עונותיהן ואם לא יעשו בפועל ג' תרועות בזה ובזה לכוללן\nברחמים והם פחד והוד ועטרה א\"כ לא יניחו התפילות לעלות,</p>\n<p>You are required to blow two tekiyah blasts, and to bring in the harsh\nand the soft (presumably the teruah and shevarim blasts) between them,\nlest they hit a heat wave(?) or sun, because the teruah blasts go up\nin one place, and they (the shofars) are of silver, to hint with them\nthat their nation is with mercy. (The relationship between the color\nsilver and mercy is not clear to us.) But on Rosh Hashanah, we must\nstand in Din to recall all of our sins, and if they do not do actively three\nteruah blasts, and in this and in this (the \"this\" is not entirely\nclear, but we think it means each tekiyah) to include them\nin mercy. They are <strong>Pachad and Hod and Atarah</strong>. If so, it will not\nallow the prayers to rise up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The meaning of the bolded text is uncertain to us, especially Atarah, and we struggled with  this section for some time. (Note that this triad appears again later in the same chapter). Here is what we have pieced together so far:</p>\n<p>Pachad (lit. dread, fear): Pachad is not a common name for Netzach,\nbut I believe I have heard them associated in the past. According to\nour local Chabad rabbi, whom I have relied on for help with\nsome challenging terminology in this text, the name fits because\nPachad is associated with judgement and fear of judgement.</p>\n<p>That's odd, and leads to an odd side note given by the Chabad rabbi about this: Netzach is on the right\nline and Hod is on the left line, which means one might believe\nNetzach is of compassion and Hod is of judgement. However, this is not\nso, as Netzach and Hod each have characteristics of the line they are\n<strong>not</strong> on.</p>\n<p>Hod (lit. splendor): Here for completeness. This is straightforwardly\nthe sefirah of Hod.</p>\n<p>Atarah (lit. crown, can also be euphemistic for genitals): I have never heard the word Atarah used in a\nkabbalistic context before. There are several possibilities for its\nmeaning (the below assumes Pachad is indeed Netzach).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Yesod, because it fits contextually with Netzach and Hod above and\ncompletes the triad, as was done several times so far in this\nsection. This seems reasonable, except that I can find no case in\nwhich Atarah has <em>ever</em> been used for Yesod. I briefly suggested the\npossibility that it is used for its euphemistic meaning, as Yesod is\nalso associated with the genitals, but everyone I have talked to\nabout this agrees the euphemistic meaning is unlikely.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://blog.nli.org.il/en/micrography/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Micrography Article</a>According to this article\n(<a href=\"https://blog.nli.org.il/en/micrography/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://blog.nli.org.il/en/micrography/</a>), Ramban and his students\nused Atarah to refer to the Shekhinah. This associates it with\nMalchut, and logically checks out because crowns and kingdoms are\nclosely associated. This is readily possible, but it leaves the\nquestion of why it is being associated with Netzach and Hod in this\ncontext. Note that the article is from a historical and non-religious perspective and also mentions Christian and Muslim texts.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>According to the local Chabad rabbi, Atarah is typically used in Chasidic\ntexts to refer to Keter (also meaning \"crown\"). This is very simple\nlinguistically, but it makes no sense in context why Keter would come\nup here.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Keter <em>and</em> Malchut: The Malchut of Atzilut is the Keter of\nBeriyah, and so too is the Malchut of Beriyah the Keter of Yetzirah\nand the Keter of Yetzirah the Malchut of Assiyah. This unites two of the above but is still odd in context, especially since we are most likely\ntalking about the Malchut of Assiyah, which is not Keter of any\nworld.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all the evidence here, I have tentatively concluded that\nAtarah here refers to Yesod and Malchut as one unit, but that's at best an educated guess. This resolves the\nquestion of why it appears in the triad, brings in the word's usage by\nRamban, and has at least some vestigial connection to the Chasidic\nmeaning.</p>\n<p>My question is: How sound is this conclusion? What other texts discuss this word, and which of the above possibilities (if any) are supported by those texts? Is there another possibility listed above that is more likely the case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/perceptions-5764-eikev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the period of time referred to as Yemos HaMoshiach, which incorporates the moment of time that Moshiach finally arrives until the year 6000 (thereby also including Techiyas HaMeisim – Resurrection of the Dead) is referred to in Kabbalah by the very same name to where Bris Milah occurs: <strong>Atarah HaYesod – Crown of Yesod</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>The [ninth sefirah, when we also include Keser, Chochmah and Binah, called] Yesod divided into two “kings” (i.e., into two independent sefiros called) “Yesod” and “Atarah” (crown). The Atarah is relevant to Malchus (the tenth and final sefirah), since it is her crown, which is why it is called Atarah. Therefore, the Yesod and the Atarah became two [independent sections of the overall sefirah referred to as Yesod]; however, after the tikun (i.e., Creation itself), the Yesod and the Atarah became one [once again] in order to join together Zehr Anpin (i.e., Chesed, Gevurah, Tifferes, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod) and the Nukveh (i.e., Malchus) forever</strong>. This is the reason why Yemos HaMoshiach – Period of Moshiach – is at the end of the sixth millennium, when the Atarah governs and gives off light for Yemos HaMoshiach, whereas Yesod itself governs the time of exile until Yemos HaMoshiach. Since . . . the Yesod divided into two, the sixth millennium, which corresponds to Yesod, divides into two. During the time that corresponds to the Yesod there will still be destruction and exile. However, the time that corresponds to the Atarah will be Yemos HaMoshiach.

Everything depends on this. Someone whose\nheart possesses him and can not completely control his desires is\ncalled a “rasha” (evil one). But still, there are precious souls,\nsweet young men, “Chasidishe Yungelait,” (newly married Chassidic\nyeshiva students) who have worldly desires and are, “not in possession\nof their hearts.” But they do battle with their evil inclinations and\nemerge victorious in that they do not actually fall into sin, God\nforbid. Furthermore, God sends them an awakening of the divine soul\nwithin them and they yearn to be Chasidim, and then at times they\nbring about the arousal to avodas Hashem. And yet, if they are not in\npossession of their hearts to the point when they can will the arousal\nat the time when the thought arises, if they cannot feel excitement at\na time when such excitement is warranted, then even they will not\nreach any great level even if they follow the path of Chasidus. Such\nstudents could also be “<strong>caught in the sling</strong>” of the erratic\nreligious personality who wavers in his dedication to serving God with\nsoul. Therefore we beg Hashem to allow us to see and to show the\nangels how man can also have the ability to arouse his desire which\nthen awakens the soul, as the Zohar teaches us. Master of the World!\nLet us be able to will the arousal at the time when the thought\narises, and to feel excitement at a time when such excitement is\nwarranted. I promise you, in the name of the God of Israel Who\nilluminates their souls, and goes ever before them in a pillar of fire\nto light His own way so that they may travel by it day and night, that\nwhen we provide man with the path and the means with which to\nwillingly shake his soul even in the slightest, even as little as the\ndecision to shake the tips of her feathers, then the student will\ntruly be able to follow the path of Chassidus. Then he will not only\nremain in this state, but even reach the pinnacle of avodas Hashem,\narriving at God’s heavenly chamber with its holy ones, making the\nGarden of Eden here on earth.</p>\n<p>(Translation by Betzalel Edwards)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have never heard of the concept of a כף הקלע while alive.

But when he is naturally generous, and gives out of love and kindness, he immediately arouses the kindness of Hashem upon him, who bestows an abundance of blessing and life without limit. Surely he will not become poor, and surely he will become wealthy.\"</p>\n<p>Worthy to mention that there are sevaral cases in which one could and should give more than a fifth, and one would get the guarntee of wealth in those cases since that is Hashem's will.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can (or must) a nazir return a lost object found in a cemetery?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A Kohen may not perform the mitzvah of returning a lost object if it requires entering a cemetery. Bava Metzia 32a. What about a nazir? The nazir has two negative commandments (per sefer haChinuch) against becoming tamei meis, but no positive commandment to stay tahor/kadosh. So could (or even should) a nazir enter a cemetery to return a lost object?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As a continuation of @Joel K's comment about looking at the Minchat Chinuch (Mitzvah 539), I'll try my best to paraphrase and summarize what the Minchat Chinuch is saying:</p>\n<p>\"In Bava Metzia 30a the Gemera gives two reasons why a kohen does not become impure to return a lost item. One is that אין עשה דוחה ל\"ת ועשה (a positive commandment does not override a positive and a negative commandment), and the other is לא דחינן איסורא מקמי ממונא (we do not push aside a prohibition for the sake of monetary gain). According to the reason of אין עשה דוחה ל\"ת ועשה , there is a machloket Rishonim. The opinion of the Riva in Chullin (פרק שילוח הקן) is that <strong>one does not receive lashes</strong> because the positive commandment overrides the negative commandment, leaving only the positive commandment. According to the Rambam <strong>one does receive lashes</strong> even according to this reason and transgresses both a positive and a negative commandment. There is no difference between the two reasons; therefore, the Rambam cites the first reason.</p>\n<p>According to this reasoning, a Nazir should be similar. The Rambam in Hilchot Nezirut 1:3, writes that there is a positive commandment of \"כְּכָל הַיֹּצֵא מִפִּיו יַעֲשֶׂה\" and a negative commandment (Halacha 5:18) of \"לא יטמא.\" However, there is a Gemera in Yevamot 25 (don't see it there) that says that בשאלה דוחה עשה אף ל\"ת ועשה, meaning that based on Nazir 58b, שאלה means a Nazir can release his neizrut through a certain process, so even something בשאלה can push off an עשה and לא תעשה. Yet, the Rambam in Hilchot Nezirut Chapter 7:15 (he says chapter 6, but it wasn't there), writes that the positive commandment of shaving overrides the negative and positive commandments of the Nazir because the days of his confirmed leprosy do not count. He does not mention the דבר בשאילה, indicating he does not agree with it. Thus, there is no difference here, even a Nazir is prohibited, because a positive commandment does not override a positive and a negative commandment even if if its a דבר בשאילה.\"</p>\n<p><strong>To sumarize:</strong> the Minchat Chinuch presents the answer as a machloket between the Rambam and Riva. If we hold like the Riva who says that says that something בשאלה <strong>can</strong> push off an עשה and לא תעשה, which is the case by a Nazir than a Nazir can do hashavat Aveidah in the cemetery. But if we hold like what the Rambam seemingly implies, that something בשאלה <strong>cannot</strong> push off an עשה and לא תעשה with regards to a Nazir the Nazir caanot do hashavat Aveidah in the cemetery.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The parallel of 6000 years and the six days of creation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have read in the Yalkut Biurim-section of the Mesivta Gemara Sanhedrin (p. 98 of the Yalkut Biurim), that the six days of creation are intertwined with the teaching that the world will exist for 6000 years (Sanhedrin 97a and Avodah Zarah 9a). This explanation seems to be based on the comments of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.2.3.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> (Thanks Rabbi Kaii!).</p>\n<p>The Yalkut Biurim brings that the third day corresponds to the generation of Avraham Avinu. Avraham Avinu was like the flowers and the trees that sprouted from the earth, that is to mean that he did bring Torah into the nations and learned them about G-d.</p>\n<p>However, the other days are described as follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First day: G-d seperated light and darkness</li>\n<li>Second day: G-d created the firmanent that separated the waters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Yalkut Biurim says the second day corresponds to the generation of Noach, in which, by means of the flood, good was separated from evil. But, wouldn't it be more logical to say that this happened when G-d separated light from darkness?</p>\n<p>Are there any commentaries, meforshim, seforim that explain this list the Yalkut Biurim brings, in which the days of creation corresponds to the generations in which we live and why this specifical order is used, or is this an chiddush on itself?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yxujd.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yxujd.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban is mentioned as the source for the idea in your sefer above, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe goes through it (see \"Keeping in Touch Vol 4: Parashat Noach\" for example).</p>\n<p>Firstly, what's left out from the above explanation that illuminates your question is that each day <em>corresponds to the revelation of one of the Sefirot</em>. Here's the quick break down, let me know if it answers your question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Chesed</strong>. Chesed is the sefira of giving. It is an indiscriminate giving; the desire that everyone should have everything. The light Hashem created was too much and had to be hidden away under the Throne of Glory for the future times. It corresponds to the first 1000 years in that they were years where there was no punishment, people lived for 900+ years, were huge, animals were huge, plants were huge, the weather was great.</li>\n<li><strong>Gevura</strong>. This is where punishment and judgement are introduced, starting with the punishment of the flood, and the dispersion (separation) of the people. Good and evil was indeed separated so Avraham could emerge \"on the other side\".</li>\n<li><strong>Tiferet</strong>. Beauty; trees and plants. Harmony and peace - a world that, <em>despite its barrenness and evil</em>, received some mercy and peace i.e. Torah. Trees bear fruits, and finally Hashems' creation was bearing fruit; Avraham and his children were doing mitzvot.</li>\n<li><strong>Netzach</strong>. The support of chesed, which is reduced chesed; light in the form of sun and moon, more tolerable and stable (and the ability to persevere despite the fact that the Great Light doesn't shine anymore - victory). The great luminaries, the sun and the moon, correspond to the two Batei HaMikdash.</li>\n<li><strong>Hod</strong>. The support of severity. Reduced judgement and punishment. The small unkosher creatures. Was a time of exile and middle ages, under lots of little tyrants and dictators - the evil landlords who made our lives hell for 1000 years...</li>\n<li><strong>Yesod</strong>. First half of the day saw the \"big beasts\" get created - the Stalins and the Hitlers. Second half of the day \"Adam\" was created, which corresponds to the latter half of the 1000 years where there have been a lot of tzaddikim, culminating in Moshiach (the afternoon), the tzaddik and \"foundation\" of the world!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To answer your question about the separation of good and evil, this does not correspond to the creation of light because the light wasn't taken out of the darkness, it was created from \"nothing\". It's just the emergence of good. It is pure <strong>chesed</strong>.</p>\n<p>For more information, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NijGDqLgIhI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here's a good shiur</a> on the topic.</p>\n\n\n",

(I don't know which additional Meforshim your Oz V'Hadar edition adds.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Maharsha This is a go-to. It mostly explains difficulties in Tosafot. (the small print explains the aggadata).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Below Maharsha you will find Maharam. And afterwards, Maharamshif. They are somewhat like Maharsha.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There are two basic Rishonim who wrote \"Halacha books\" included in the back of the Gemora. Rosh, and Rif.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Rif follows the exact text of the Gemora, but leaves out all the opinions we do not follow at the end of the day. The standard pagination of the Rif is different than the page numbers in the Gemora, but the corresponding daf of Gemara is usually indicated on top. (I don't know about your edition. Some Oz vehadar editions change the entire format of Rif). The commentaries on the Rif vary by Mesechta, but you can find a version of Rashi on the inside margin (different than the Rashi in our Gemora), and the outside margin for most Mesechta is Ran. The Ran will comment even on portions of the Gemora the Rif left out. This commentary can be involved.</li>\n<li>Below the text of the Rif you will find Meor (called Ba'al Hamaor) commentary, and the Milchamas Hashem, written by Ramban. These often dispute each other, and are considered advanced.</li>\n<li>Many editions include a \"collection of Meforshim\" ordered by Daf, of various Achronim (later commentaries). (I think older Gemaras list each commentary separately.) Scan through this if Maharsha does not address your issue. Especially look for Rashash.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>The Rambam's commentary on the Mishna. It does not comment on the Gemora.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Likewise Tosefta is not a commentary.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, if you are looking to take your Gemora learning beyond Rashi and Tosafos, I would suggest choosing one of the basic Rishonim. (not each Rishon writes on each Mesechta.) They are not typically included in the back of the Gemora, but some thicker editions may include some.</p>\n<p>A. Rashba is often chosen in \"yeshivish\" circles.</p>\n<p>B. Some prefer Ramban</p>\n<p>C. I think you may find Ritva easier especially if you want something somewhat 'like Rashi\".</p>\n<p>There is also the \"Tosafos HaRosh\" (as well as Tosafos Rid, and other Tosafos depending on the Mesechta). This is a version of Tosafos written by the Rosh. It sometimes includes discussions similar to our Tosafos but with different wording, so it may be helpful in understanding Tosafos. This is included in the back of the thicker editions of Gemara.</p>\n\n\n",

What right or justification did they have to do this? Or was this a sin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban (Vayikra 27:29) describes the behavior of Yaveish Gilead as a transgression of the commandment to follow the leaders of Israel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומצינו אנשי יבש גלעד שעברו על שבועת הקהל ולא באו אל המצפה וכתיב (שופטים כא י) וישלחו שם העדה שנים עשר אלף איש מבני החיל ויצוו אותם לאמר לכו והכיתם את יושבי יבש גלעד לפי חרב ואין הסברא נותנת שעשו כל העדה רעה כזאת להמית אנשים רבים מישראל שאינם חייבים מיתה ופנחס היה שם ועל פיו נעשה כל הענין ההוא ועוד מצאתי באגדה בילמדנו תניא רבי עקיבא אומר החרם הוא השבועה והשבועה הוא החרם אנשי יבש עברו על החרם ונתחייבו מיתה ולכך אני אומר כי מן הכתוב הזה יצא להם הדין הזה שכל מלך בישראל או סנהדרי גדולה במעמד כל ישראל שיש להם רשות במשפטים אם יחרימו על עיר להלחם עליה וכן אם יחרימו על דבר העובר עליו חייב מיתה והוא חיובן של אנשי יבש גלעד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus we find in the case of the men of Jabesh-gilead who transgressed the oath of the assembly by not coming to Mitzpah [to take part in the battle against Gibeah for the outrage they had committed], that it is written, And the congregation sent thither ten thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them saying: ‘Go and smite the inhabitants with the edge of the sword’. And common sense does not allow [us to say] that the whole congregation perpetrated such an evil deed, killing many people of Israel who were not guilty of death! And Phinehas was there, and by word of his mouth the whole affair was done! I have further found in the Agadah, in the [Midrash] Yelamdeinu: “We have been taught: Rabbi Akiba says, Cheirem (‘doomed to destruction’) is an oath, and an oath is cheirem. The men of Jabesh transgressed the cheirem, and thus they became liable to the death penalty.”Therefore I say that it was from this verse [before us] that they deduced this law — that if any king of Israel, or the Great Sanhedrin [of seventy-one judges] in the presence of all Israel, who have the authority to institute ordinances [for the good of the people], if they declare a certain city cheirem, to be warred on, and likewise if they declare a certain matter cheirem, he who violates it is liable to the death-penalty. This indeed was the guilt of the men of Jabesh-gilead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ibn Ezra takes a different approach, placing it under the prohibition of taking G-d’s name in vain. In Shemos 20:7 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה ראינו בעבור שנשבעו בנ\"י ברבים על דבר פלגש בגבעה. ושם היה פינחם הכהן. ומצאנו שנהרגו העוברים על השבועה. וכן אנשי יבש גלעד. אנשים ונשים וטף. וכן לא יעשה אפילו במחללי שבת…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now Scripture tells us that Israel publicly took an oath because of the incident involving the concubine at Gibeah. We find that those who violated the oath were put to death. It should be noted that Phineas the priest was there. Similarly with the people of Jabesh-gilead, men, women, and children. Even those who desecrate the Sabbath are not dealt with in this manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to explain why the sin of swearing falsely is more severe than other sins.</p>\n\n\n",

This is the meaning of (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.97.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 97:11</a>) \"Light is sown for the righteous, and happiness for the upright.\" The letters of the Torah are chambers of the Blessed One, who fills them with the emanations of divine light. This is written too in the Holy Zohar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Yitro.28.497?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II:85b</a>), that the Holy Blessed One and the Torah are essentially one. Into these chambers you must direct your attuned self, which is the soul. This is the act of cleaving, and as such, the Holy Blessed One and Torah and Israel are all one. This is what is meant by removing yourself from materiality, namely, that your soul is removed from your body, and rather have it clothed in the thoughts that are being spoken. Then you will surely see many supernal worlds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>2) Clear your mind</strong></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shem_MiShmuel%2C_Vaetchanan.5.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shem MiShmuel</a> on Voeschanan explains that it is natural for a person to be full of competing and confusing thoughts. The trick is to try and remove foreign thoughts before you daven, so you then have the headspace to pray with the right concentration.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאחר שהאדם מתאמץ בכל יכלתו ועושה כל מה שביכלתו לסלק ממנו כל מחשבת חוץ, אז מן השמים מרחמין עליו ומכינים את לבו שיהי' ביכלתו לכוון</p>\n<p>After the person exerts himself with all his might and does everything in his power to remove from him every extraneous thought, then heaven has mercy on him and prepares his heart to be able to concentrate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>3) To recognise the Shechinah (Divine Presence) speaks through you</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Baal_Shem_Tov%2C_Noach.96.1?vhe=Sefer_Baal_Shem_Tov._Lodz,_1938&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baal Shem Tov, Parshas Noach 96</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כאשר מתחיל האדם להתפלל מיד כשאומר אדני שפתי תפתח השכינה מתלבשת בו ומדברת הדיבורים, וכשיהיה לו האמונה שהשכינה מדברת אלו הדיבורים בוודאי תפול עליו אימה ויראה וגם הקדוש ברוך הוא כביכול מצמצם את עצמו ושורה אצלו כמו שנאמר (שיר השירים ב׳:ט׳) מציץ מן החרכים מהאותיות שהם היכלות והוא הולך מהיכל להיכל, ובכל היכל דנין אותו אם אם הוא ראוי לכנוס, ואם היה האדם משים אל לבו שדנין אותו בעת שנפלה לו מחשבה זרה בוודאי היה מתפלל בכוונה, רק שהוא שוכח שדנין אותו כו':</p>\n<p>(ליקוטי אמרים ד\"א ע\"ב)</p>\n<p>When you begin to pray, as soon as you utter the words \"Adonai Sefatai Tiftach, God, open my lips\" - in this moment the Shechina adorns you and speaks through you. If you truly trust that it is the Shechina speaking these words, surely great dread and fear will fall upon you. Even the Holy One, in a way, constricts God's being and dwells with you. This is as it says (Song of Songs 2:9) \"Peeking through the lattice,\" - these are the letters, which are chambers, and you journey from one chamber to the other, and in each chamber you are judged whether you are worthy to enter. If you would notice that you are being judged at every instance when a foreign thought enters your mind, you would certainly pray with fierce attunement. But some time you forget that you are being judged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>4) Engage fully in tefilla</strong></h2>\n<p>The Noam Elimelech in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Noam_Elimelech%2C_Introduction%2C_The_Tzetel_Katan.11?vhe=_Noam_Elimelech,_Lvov,_1788.&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hakdomo - The Tzetel Katan 11</a> lists numerous tips, talking very practically about how to maintain kavanna and to stay tuned into the davening:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יא. ירגיל את עצמו להתפלל בכל כחו, ובקול המעורר הכוונה להדבק המחשבה לדיבור, ופניו אל הכותל בתוך סידור התפילה בבוקר ובערב, ולא יסתכל לצדדין מתחילת התפילה עד סופה, ובחזרת הש\"ץ השמונה עשרה יעיין בסידור לענות אמן בכל כחו על כל ברכה וברכה, ובשעת קריאת התורה להטות אזנו על כל דיבור ודיבור מהקורא כקורא את המגילה, ולעשות עצמו כאילם בבית הכנסת, אפילו קודם התפלה ואחריה עד הליכתו לביתו</p>\n<p>One should accustom oneself to pray with full strength, and with a voice that arouses the intention to attach thought to speech, and with one's face toward the wall inside the Siddur, both morning and evening. One should not look to the side from the beginning of prayer to the end, and during the Chazan's repetition one should attend to the Siddur, to answer \"Amen\" with full strength to every single blessing. And during the Torah reading, one should listen for every single statement from the reader, similar to Megillah reading. One should act like a mute person in the synagogue, even before or after the prayer, until leaving to go home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short he points to:\n(i) Daven with a voice that channels the speech in a meaningful way\n(ii) Focus on looking at the siddur - i.e. prevents distraction\n(iii) Respond to the tefillos so you're fully engaged e.g. say \"Amen\"\n(iv) Listen carefully\n(v) Stay quiet (other than davening of course)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is much. May I recommend learning Hachsharat Avreichim. Here is an excerpt from Chapter 9 that summarises what you'll have learned if you go through it properly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואגב עוד דבר הנחוץ לך הרווחת בדברינו אלו, כי גם את סתם זרם המחשבות לא\nשל תאוות רק של רשות השוטפות בך בתפילתך ומבלבלות אותך תוכל במטאטא זה\nלטאטאה וממך להרחיק. כשאתה עומד בתפילה והפראות הללו, מחשבותיך, מהוללות\nבך לבלי לעצרן, אז אם בחזקה תרצה להסירן מסופקני אם תוכל להן ולפעמים עוד\nתתאמצנה להתגרות בך יותר. לכן הפסק על איזה זמן מתפילתך והרגיע א״ע\n[בערוהיג דיך], אם רשאי אתה לשבת בפרק הזה בתפילה שב, ואם לאו השען על\nאיזה דבר ובמנוחת לב הסתכל על מחשבותיך, והתבונן עם מחשבתך על פחזות\nהפראות האלה, איך מחשבה אחת מתחברת בחברתה, וזו קופצת על זו. ופתאום\nמחשבה שמלפני כמה שנים מיהרה לבא אליך וכו׳, ממש כפראים בהוללותם וכחיות\nבפחזותן תתפלא על אמצעי הזה, מתחילה תכהנה ובכל רגע תקלשנה יותר עד שממש\nכנ״ל כמו במטאטא נקית את מוחך.<br />\nThere is another ability which is\ncrucial to you that you have gained from our discussion. Now you have\na broom with which to sweep away unwanted thoughts, not unwarranted\ndesires, but permitted, everyday thoughts that flow through your mind\nand confuse you when you are trying to pray. When you stand to pray\nand the rowdy gang of thoughts comes to incessantly harass you, I am\ndoubtful whether the sheer force of your mind can drive them away.\nSometimes this only strengthens them to irk you even more. Therefore,\nyou are advised to pause momentarily from your davening and collect\nyourself. If you are permitted at this point of the davening to sit,\nthen by all means, sit. And if not, lean against something and relax\nso you can calmly observe your thoughts. Use your power of thought to\ncontemplate the rowdy gang that has come upon your mind, how one\nthought leads and flows into the next, and one jumps upon the other.\nThen suddenly a thought or memory from years ago comes to you, exactly\nlike a mob of looters or a pack of stampeding beasts. You will be\namazed at the effectiveness of this method. At first it is dulled, and\never moment it gets weaker, until, just as we said, you feel as if you\nhave swept your mind clean.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is available with a reliable translation on Sefaria and you can purchase it on Amazon:\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1536982261?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Spiritual Growth: The Step-by-Step Guide of a Hasidic Master</a></p>\n<p>It is written by a very contemporary tzaddik who was a young man in WW2 (and sadly was martyred in the Warsaw Ghetto), but a genius and a prime student of 300 years of Chassidut (he quotes Tanya a lot). It has a modern air about it that speaks to our generation very well and helps us find our Neshama in a coarse, secular world. In chapter 9 he teaches about an ancient Jewish practice of using our mind as a powerful tool to become the masters of our entire being, in a way that echoes similarities with modern mindfulness.</p>\n<p><strong>The simplest thing you can do, according to him and many other Torah teachings is to not immediately daven, but take a few minutes to put effort into clearing your mind before (and during) davening.</strong> There's a lot more to it than that so again, let me recommend reading the sefer in full.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is not useful to you personally as I am not sure based on the brevity of your question what exactly is bothering you but hopefully this is a valuable answer to some.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is this idea (dictation model of Torah) by Rambam heretical/blasphemous/idolatrous?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bigman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi David Bigman</a> in his article <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/the-dictation-model-of-torah-revelation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Dictation Model of Torah Revelation\n</a> convincingly argues that the idea of Torah being entirely dictated to Moses, and then preserved over the generations (labelled as the \"dictation model\") is not an idea that is actually authentic in the Talmud or practically any writings before Rishonim I think. Rav Bigman traces the idea back to Rambam who was the originator of the dictation model, most likely as a response to the intellectual climate of the time, especially also with the Islamic idea of the corruption of the Torah that Maimonedes felt the need to defend, and promote the most literal view (this type of understanding is also promoted by other scholars like Rabbi Dr. Joshua Berman, though not in this particular context or at least I never heard him speak about this). But this seems to be an innovation and is not an authentic idea.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that the Torah is not Divine. Rather, it is to say that the method of transmission wasn't through perfect dictation. This need not mean that what we have is inauthentic or incorrect, with the exception to Maimonedes.</p>\n<p>The question I have is this: Is this idea of the Torah being dictated and perfectly preserved without changes idolatrous/blasphemous/heretical. Here is my reasoning:</p>\n<p>Let's say that we follow Rambam and believe that the Torah was dictated and perfectly preserved. But in reality, we have evidence that there likely were later insertions and possible scribal mistakes in copying. Having said that, if we believe that it was all dictated by G-d, blessed be He, then we are ascribing G-dly capcities and G-d's attributes onto a mere human being who was doing this work. If we consider every single Torah passage to be equally Divine (an innovative idea by Rambam, which was not known by previous sages), then we are de-facto possibly elevating a human being to the status of the Divine.</p>\n<p>Hence, to subscribe to the idea that the Torah was perfectly dictated, rather than some parts were dictated by G-d, blessed be He, while others were merely Divinely inspired and would not have been allowed to continue should they have corrupted G-d's word as He would correct it, the former would be considered false and possibly heretical/blasphemous/idolatrous.</p>\n<p>Is there anything wrong with this reasoning or would Rambam's idea not be considered heretical/blasphemous/idolatrous?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT (and potential summary)</strong>: I wrote this as a reply in the comments to someone, and I think it might be a useful summary of the idea, so I'm also pasting it here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You misunderstood me. I'm saying that if Rambam was indeed the one who came up with the dictation model of the Torah, while in reality the Torah was only partially dictated & some other portion of it contains human writings (I think that this is the position of Rav Obadiah Sforno, ie the idea that the \"Torah\" that Moses received is only a certain number of teachings or even just a single teaching), then if we view the entire Torah as the literal, dictated word of G-d, we are viewing human writing as G-dly, thus elevating the humans who wrote it to G-d's status & that's blasphemous</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, see the following chat between me and Shmuel where I explain some of the relevant views on this: <a href=\"https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/149482/discussion-between-shmuel-and-setszu\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

However, there is no fear of it being pretentious if the corners of the Tzitzis are worn under other clothes. Because it might seem pretentious to have 2 holes on both the Tzitzis and the Tallis Gadol. Which leads us to bring out that if the Tzitzis corners were under other clothes, it is okay to have a Tallis Gadol with 2 holes as well (Orach Chayim, Bach).\nHowever, I might have to look into this Halacha more in order to give a better answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Mishna Berura indicates a priori whether in tying or after tying, they should hang in the kind side of the garment. With the two hole style you cannot drape the tzitzith on the long side at all.</p>\n<p>And it may be less durable. Those two holes are like 1cm apart or less. Personally I find it spooky because it looks like snake eyes, so that might be a consideration as well, so if you have a personal aesthetic that clashes with that then that might be an issue for you.</p>\n<p>Also it's not \"on the wings of your garment\" like how those who are careful swing the tzitziyoth to the lateral sides of the garment and not in the bottom edges of the garment.</p>\n<p>Here is the Yalkut Yossef:</p>\n<p>Y. Yossef. Din chutei hatzitzit #18 There are those who say that you have to be precise and hang the tsisit on the long side of the tallit and not on its short edge because we need the tsisis to be hanging on the wings of the tallit. But after the fact you don't have to make it an issue. But anyway to be careful that it's not hung diagonally.</p>\n<p>YY bottom notes: SAOC 11:15. And the opinion of the MB is whether it's while tying them or whether it's afterwards, if they moved to the bottom he should bring them back. But all this is a priori but ex post facto you do not have to make it an issue. But in the Tehila l'David volume 1, page 11 he writes, that all the making an issue is during the tying, but afterwards one does not make an issue to move it back. And the MB adds that in any case be very careful that the tzitzith you do not hang diagonally on the corner, because it's a custom of the Karaites who do that as their practice, and if they're hanging it's a mitzva to move them back in their place. And see there in Beer Halakha which explains what is the long side of the tallit.</p>\n<p>Ben Ish Hai Year 1 Noach #15: Rabbeinu Haim Vital testifies about the Arizal that on his tallit katan specifically there were two small holes close together resembling the nekuda Tzere on all four corners and his tzitzis would hang out from there going in and out on the same side of the garment. But the Ramak himself didn't do that and he or his son understood it's just because the Ari held on to that custom on his tallit katan from his Ashkenazi lands, therefore R' Chaim did not do it.</p>\n<p>Lekh Lkha Year one #1: the braid you have to make it loops and loops each loop of three windings but first tie two knots close to the Kanaf [wing of the garment, not the bottom] and wind 7 windings and then tie another two knots..</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we follow matrilineal descent of Judaism when there's evidence to suggest that it used to be patrilineal? How to resolve the contradiction?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the contemporary scholarship, even though modern Orthodox Judaism follows matrilineal descent, there is evidence to suggest that this was a shift that occurred during the second century, and that pre-diaspora Judaism was patrilineal <a href=\"https://www.templeemanuel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cohen_Origins_Matrilineal_Principle_1985.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Cohen, 1985)</a>.

Outside of scholarship, others offer <a href=\"https://wanderinghebrew.com/2013/01/14/anyone-with-one-jewish-parent-has-a-right-to-call-himself-jewish-why-patrilineal-descent-is-the-more-authentic-tradition\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">examples and arguments</a> such as saying that \"the oldest historical way of identifying Jewishly was through the father. Just look in the Torah. Who is Jewish? Moses is Jewish, but his wife is not. Would anyone say Moses’ grandchildren weren’t Jewish? Of course not. What a crazy thought! What about King David? According to Jewish tradition, one of his descendants will be the messiah — not a descendant of his wife. Would anyone today say HIS children aren’t Jewish? Of course not! So, why then, would we say that the child of a Jewish man living today is not Jewish, if that person is choosing to identify Jewishly?\" and \"the shift from patrilineal to matrilineal descent happened around the year zero\" and that the Rabbis encouraged the exclusive-matrilineal system in order to discourage conversions due to Roman persecutions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jewishbelief.com/was-matrilineality-always-the-factor-in-determining-jewishness-a-historical-study\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Others</a> also say things like this: \"Many people mistakenly believe that the criteria were laid out clearly at Sinai and have ever since been based on matrilineality, but that doesn’t seem to fan out with biblical and historical texts. This is also essentially baseless as no Mishnaic or Talmudic texts claim matrilineality to be a tradition from Sinai.[1]\" and also \"While it cannot be stated with certainty, it does still seem that Jewishness was determined by patrilineal descent even after Sinai into the biblical era. The Israelites were essentially the “sons of Jacob,” known as the 12 tribes of Israel. Tribalism was defined by the father’s tribe (l’bet avotam – Num. 1:2) since in those times the wife would join the husband’s household. Perhaps the most explicit verse referencing patrilineality is from Ezra 2:59 (also in Neh. 7:61) “The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer—they were unable to tell whether their father’s house and descent were Israelite.”</p>\n<p>King Solomon is said to have married foreign women of all stripes. If we take the biblical number literally, he had one thousand wives and probably thousands of children as a result. These children, of non-Jewish mothers, were absorbed into the Israelite community with King Rehoboam also being the son of an Ammonite wife of Solomon.[5] This would suggest patrilineality in this era. It is unlikely that these wives of Solomon converted, since they were pagan-worshippers and eventually caused Solomon to stray from God (I Kings 11).[6]\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rabbionanarrowbridge.blogspot.com/2021/07/the-principle-that-wasnt-re-evaluation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Some even say that the Talmudic attempt at providing evidence of matrilineal descent tracing back to Mt. Sinai is unconvincing</a>: \"A number of verses are cited by the Talmud (B. Kiddushin 68b) in an attempt to show that the matrilineal principle has Biblical origin, but from a historical perspective none is entirely convincing.\" along with \"Indeed all evidence points instead to a strong patrilineal principle.\" and \"We have seen that there is no explicit ‘matrilineal principle’ in Biblical or Rabbinic Judaism. Rather Biblical and Rabbinic Judaism (and even proto-Christianity) consider patrilineal inheritance to be the proper way for a Jew to receive their status\".</p>\n<p>All this is quite problematic because to follow a matrilineal principle for something as important as Jewish descent is to a) possibly overrule a G-d's word and b) claim that what the sages taught was highly incorrect in halachic matters.</p>\n<p>One solution is to push the <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/about/broader-social-impacts-committee/members-member-resources/elliot-dorff#:%7E:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20Rabbis%20assert%20that,be%20interpreted%20in%20multiple%20ways.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers Rabbah 13:15-16</a> and say that there are 70 different ways to interpreting the Torah (\"Shiv'im panim la-Torah\", basically meaning something like \"70 faces of Torah\"). Since research shows that matrilineal descent is a late Rabbinic post-exile invention, and is not necessarily from Mt. Sinai directly, then one can also use this principle of 70 ways of looking at the Torah to also interpret the heredity of rules to also work for both matrilineal and patrilineal descent. This is the only solution if we don't want to open the can of worms and say that the sages were wrong with such an important halacha or could completely overrule a Divine decree. In this way, we can say that its okay to follow patrilineal descent, but it was superior to follow matrilineal descent especially in times when it would be uncertain if the father was Jewish, so the Rabbis were merely shifting focus rather than throwing overruling G-d's Divine Law.</p>\n<p>This is also not to mention that there are certain groups of Jews, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaifeng_Jews\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kaifeng Jews</a> (who were formed as a Jewish community in China during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty#Culture_and_society\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Song Dynasty</a>, sometime between 960 and 1279 CE), who traditionally (particularly early on) follow the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zera_Yisrael#Patrilineal_Jews\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">patrilineal descent of Judaism</a> despite having both the Tanakh and the Talmud. There were <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/kaifeng-torah-chinese-torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Kaifeng Torah scrolls\"</a> whose content is identical to the mainstream Torah. They followed all the standard Jewish practices like abstinence from pork (rare in Ancient China), circumcision, and more. Unfortunately by 1800s, they were completely unable to read their texts with their last Rabbi dying in early 1800s and the community being fully integrated into mainstream Chinese culture before emerging back today. According to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-29904-4_53\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Xu, 2005)</a>, there is evidence to suggest that the community did have a Talmud. Despite all this, they somehow understood that the proper halachic way is to follow the patrilineal descent according to their interpretation of the scripture.</p>\n<p>Is there any other way to reconcile the evidence to suggest that the original Jewish practice was to follow patrilineal descent according to research, and that some Jewish groups interpreted traditional scriptures to follow patrilineal descent and that mainstread \"Rabbinic\" Orthodox Judaism today follows matrilineal descent?</p>\n<p>EDIT: As a note, I'm not presenting a doctoral thesis in the question, I am saying that there is evidence suggesting patrilineal descent for early Judaism and even some post-Talmudic Jewish groups, and I presented some of the scholarly evidence here, and based on that, I'm asking how to reconcile that with the mainstream understanding of halacha.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your point about identifying lineage through the father is faulty and based on a misunderstanding. There is a difference between lineage to make someone a Jew, and lineage for the purposes of tribal membership, kingship, or inheritance.</p>\n<p>The Tanach generally deriving lineage through the father is due to one's tribe passing from one's father. Indeed, a simply proof against your position is the מקלל who cursed Hashem in parshas Emor:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 24:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֵּצֵא בֶּן אִשָּׁה יִשְׂרְאֵלִית וְהוּא בֶּן אִישׁ מִצְרִי בְּתוֹךְ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל וַיִּנָּצוּ בַּמַּחֲנֶה בֶּן הַיִּשְׂרְאֵלִית וְאִישׁ הַיִּשְׂרְאֵלִי'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There came out among the Israelites a man whose mother was Israelite and whose father was Egyptian. And a fight broke out in the camp between the son of the Israelite woman and a certain Israelite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The מקלל is the son of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian man. When he tried to set up his tent with the encampment of the Tribe of Dan, due to it being his mother's tribe, he was rebuked as he was not a part of the Tribe of Dan - as tribal membership goes by the father. However, he was clearly Jewish, despite his father being an Egyptian. This proves very simply that 1) Jewishness passes matrilineally, and 2) tribal membership passes patrilineally.</p>\n<p>Now, if you want to say that this is a proof only that a Jewish mother makes one a Jew, and not a proof that having only a Jewish father (and a non-Jewish mother) does not make one a Jew - see another simple proof from parhas VoEschanan<</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 7:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי יָסִיר אֶת בִּנְךָ מֵאַחֲרַי וְעָבְדוּ אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים וְחָרָה אַף יְהוָה בָּכֶם וְהִשְׁמִידְךָ מַהֵר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For they will turn your children away from Me to worship other gods, and Hashem's anger will blaze forth against you, promptly wiping you out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.7.4.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on this pasuk</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּנוֹ שֶׁל גוֹי כְּשֶׁיִּשָּׂא אֶת בִּתְּךָ יָסִיר אֶת בִּנְךָ אֲשֶׁר תֵּלֵד לוֹ בִתְּךָ מֵאַחֲרַי, לִמְּדָנוּ שֶׁבֶּן בִּתְּךָ הַבָּא מִן הַגּוֹי קָרוּי בִּנְךָ, אֲבָל בֶּן בִּנְךָ הַבָּא מִן הַגּוֹיָה אֵינוֹ קָרוּי בִּנְךָ אֶלָּא בְּנָהּ, שֶׁהֲרֵי לֹא נֶאֱמַר עַל בִּתּוֹ לֹא תִקַּח כִּי תָסִיר אֶת בִּנְךָ מֵאַחֲרַי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I.e., the son of the non-Jew when he marries your daughter, will turn away your son (grandson) whom your daughter will bear unto him from following Me. This teaches us, that your daughter's son who is born of a non-Jew is termed your son, but your son’s son, who is born of a non-Jewish woman, is not termed your son, but her son, for, you see, in regard to the statement: “his daughter you shall not take [to your son]\" it does not add “For she will turn away your son (grandson) from following Me\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are simple logical proofs from the written Torah itself. In addition, it is obvious that the principle of matrilinearity in Jewishness was taken completely for granted in all segments of the Talmud, and is never questioned. This itself is a fairly strong proof that this was always a universal tenet of Torah-true Judaism. The various heretical sects that accept patrilinearity, such as Karaism, Saduceeism or Reform, are all new movements that arose well after well-documented Torah Judaism.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>There is no contradiction.\nLots of things change and sometimes they even change back.  The sanhedrin once voted to forbid one's property from working on shabbat, even if the work was set in motion before. They then voted to repeal it because it was too burdensome.</p>\n\n\n",

Shmuli noticed, however, that the\ncover of the pitcher had a \"filter\" to hold back the ice. \"Abba – but\nyou taught me that we can‘t use a <em>kli</em> to do <em>Borer</em> even if we are\nselecting 'good' from 'bad' for immediate usage.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>:  Can this pitcher be used?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>:  Yes. However, once the ice cubes have become small (i.e. to a degree where it is no longer very easy to remove them), it is\nbetter to pour the water when the ice cubes are settled at the bottom\nof the pitcher. If the ice cubes are small and the water level is very\nlow, where it does not rise above the ice cubes, it‘s best then to add\nmore water to the pitcher.</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:  We have learned in the last few articles that the <em>melacha</em> of <em>Borer</em> is not applicable in a case where a large item is\ninside a liquid, whereby it does not require effort to identify and\nremove the item from the liquid. There, the item is already considered\nas 'selected' - i.e., it is lacking the status of \"mixed-in\" [1].</p>\n<p>An example of such is a case where the eggs are inside the water.\nSpilling out the water or removing the eggs from the water—even for\nlater use—is permitted. Since the eggs are large and don‘t require\neffort to identify and remove them, they are not considered as \"mixed\nin\" with the water [2].</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchosa rules that due to their\nconsiderably large size, ice cubes inside a drink* are not considered\nas mixed in with the liquid [3]. Since there is no \"mixture\", then\neven a <em>kli</em> (i.e., the cover which holds back the ice) may be used in\nthis case [3]. <em>(The second part of the \"Answer\" – what to do once the\nice cubes in the pitcher become small – is similar to a case of \"a tea\npot with essence and tea leaves.\" The explanation of these cases needs\nto be discussed in a separate article.)</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1] Shevisas HaShabbos (Borer, 25).  [2] ibid.  [3] Shemiras Shabbos\nKehilchosa 3:63.</p>\n<p>* From the fact that the Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchosa (3:4) taught\nthat one may remove a large piece of meat from a <strong>clear</strong> soup (since it\ndoes not take effort to identify the meat there), it appears that\nin a case of ice cubes, the “drink” that Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchosa\nis referring to is also a type of drink in which one could see the ice\ncubes (e.g., water, apple juice).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where is the desert of the nations?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a Vayoel Moshe shiur on Youtube, recently I was introduced to the <a href=\"https://www.truetorahjews.org/siman22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">notion</a> that the ingathering of the Jews will not initially be to the land of Israel but to \"the desert of the nations\".</p>\n<p>I have been trying to figure out what this desert could be. The first thing that came to mind was the Sahara desert. Being a desert that straddles many African nations it seemed like an interesting candidate. The idea that the whole world could witness the miracles that the land of Israel would return to being a desolate desert when we abandon its territory and that fact that we will turn the desert into a fertile land which is not only able to sustain us but provide surplus food to other nations in the world would be indisputable signs that there is a Creator who is blessing and protecting the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>Then after some searching I found that Antarctica (the South Pole) is considered to be the largest desert in the world. Also interesting is the fact that there are international agreements regarding Antarctica that could qualify it as being the \"desert of the nations\". Antarctica has abundant supplies of fresh water. There are many unexplored natural resources under the ground which is under the ice. Could it be that Antarctica is the desert of the nations that Israelis would be advised to retreat to when Iran successfully invades Israel as per Sanhedrin 98?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The original idea from the Satmar Rav comes from <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=66383&st=&pgnum=36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siman 22 in his Vayoel Moshe</a>. There, the Rebbe writes that, and quotes the Raavad, that the initial gathering will be \"to a wilderness\". See <a href=\"https://www.truetorahjews.org/siman22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The Raavad on Mishnah Eduyos 2:9 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Raavad_on_Mishnah_Eduyot.2.9.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> that in every exile, there are two times of a redemption: 1) number of time, 2) number of generations. This is why the generation of the Exodus needed to wait for 40 years in the desert, before they could enter the Land. Similar, after the Jewish people were being freed from Bavel, after 70 years, Yerushalayim wasn't rebuild for the next 30 years. So to with the generation in which Moshiach comes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the future as well, we will be gathered from all the lands of our exile to an intermediate place called “the wilderness of the nations,” and when the right generation arrives we will go from there to Eretz Yisroel. This intermediate place is described by Yechezkel: “And I will take you out from the nations, and I will gather you from the lands where you were dispersed, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm and poured out wrath. And I will bring you to the wilderness of the nations, and I will contend with you there face to face. As I contended with your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will contend with you, said Hashem G-d. And I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into My covenant. And I will filter out from you the rebellious and the sinners against Me; from the land of their sojourn I will remove them, but to the Land of Israel they will not come, and you shall know that I am Hashem.” (Yechezkel 20:34-38) <a href=\"https://www.truetorahjews.org/parsha-pearls/parah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(see the Parsha Pears for Parshas Parah)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You ask \"where is this desert\". Well, the Satmar Rav in his Vayoel Moshe, explains that the deeper meaning behind this wording is that we must understand the message that we will not be allowed, according to the three oaths, to return to Eretz Yisrael en masse, with force.</p>\n<p>My own thought is: a desert connotes wandering, wandering around until G-d provides us with permission to return to the Land, after Moshiach comes. We are not meant to nestle ourselves in the Land, but we must wander around in the desert of the nations until Moshiach comes and brings us back (see: Efes Biltecha Goaleinu, p. 179).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please note: of course there will be people that don't comply with the teachings of the Satmar Rav, but that is not the point of this answer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In context I would not take the phrase literally as a barrens/desert/wilderness of the nations (as some Rishonim do), but rather as an epithet for the lands of exile (as I recall the Rambam understands it - I'll try to update later with a source).</p>\n<p>That said, is also of note that traditionally we have homiletical readings of the phrase. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yissachar_Shlomo_Teichtal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yisakhar Shelomo Teichtal</a>, who was raised as a staunch anti-Zionist Hasid of the Munkatscher Rebbe but later enthusiastically supported Jewish settlement of the Land of Israel, wrote in his <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=53692&st=&pgnum=222&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eim ha-Banim Semeikhah (Ch. 3, sec. 19)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזה שאמר הכתוב [יחזקאל כ, לה] \"והבאתי אתכם אל מדבר העמים\", 'מדבר' הוא\nלשון דיבור, כדאיתא בשמות רבה [ב, ד] אין 'מדבר' אלא דיבור, שנאמר [שה\"ש\nד, ג] \"ומדברך נאוה\", ר\"ל אביא אתכם אל דיבור העמים, שיהיו נידונים\nומדברים ביניהם על אורך גלותנו. כאשר שמעתי אומרים שהכהן הגדול במדינת\nהונגארן, הנקרא בלשונם פרימאס ירום הודו, פיו פתח בחכמה לפני מלך ושרים\nואמר: לא שמענו ולא ראינו שיהיה חבוש בבית האסורים שמונה עשר מאות שנה,\nכאשר היהודים האומללים האלה דוויים וסחופים תחת יד מלך ושרים, ואעפ\"י כן\nהם מתנהגים כהוגן וכשורה.</p>\n<p>This is the meaning of the verse \"And I will bring you to the\nwilderness (מדבר) of the nations\" (Ezekiel 20:35). The Midrash states\n(Shemoth Rabbah 2:4): \"מדבר (wilderness) connotes speech (דיבור), as\nit says, \"And your speech (ומדברך) is comely\" (Song of Songs 4:3).\"\nThus, our verse means, I will bring you to the \"speech\" of the\nnations, for they will consider and discuss the lengthiness of our\nexile.

This I add to my lentils to make dal fry, would this be kosher?</p>\n<p>I know meat and dairy should not mix, but what vegetables and dairy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Those ingredients are totally kosher. People cook dairy with vegetables all the time.</p>\n<p>Check out this <a href=\"http://ammaskitchen.com/cincinnati/AmmasMenuJan2022.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">menu from a vegetarian Indian restaurant in Cincinnati</a>, certified kosher by the rabbis there. Plenty of butter-and-legumes combinations.</p>\n<p>Of course, a dish is only actually kosher if the equipment used to make it is kosher. So if you make your own dal fry and bring it to the office, don't expect your more-observant Jewish colleagues to eat it. (Though there are some who are less meticulous who would say \"eh the ingredients are okay, good enough.\")</p>\n<p>(Just thinking here ... lentils are described as a dietary staple throughout the Talmud; and there was some sort of dairy condiment that was also very common in the Talmud ... but I can't think of a place where it happens to mention both together. But anyhow -- it's perfectly kosher, even if we don't have documentation that they ate that particular combination.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>No problem at all with dairy and vegetables or with meat and vegetables. Any vegetables cooked with dairy (as opposed to mixed together when cold) will generally cause the pots used to become dairy (same for meat) and therefore have limitations on using those same pots with meat (or dairy in the reverse) or for pareve - not meat or dairy - to be eaten together with meat (or dairy).</p>\n<p>However, the question is not as strange as some others might think. There is a rule about not baking <em>bread</em> that is either meat or dairy. Because bread is eaten frequently with all kinds of other foods, bread itself is normally baked 100% pareve. There are certain exceptions, but generally most mainstream supervising organizations will not certify bread that is meat or (more commonly for non-kosher bread) dairy. That actually limits some bakeries - for example, my local Costco has a OK certified bakery but the bagels are not marked as kosher because the entire bakery is treated as dairy and there is no supervision or strict division of equipment to ensure that the bagels are always pareve, though my understanding is that they almost certainly are actually pareve. (I had a customer once with a much larger mostly dairy bakery and the Kof-K did certify that the bagels were kosher and pareve, as the factory had entirely separate ovens and other equipment for bagels.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Based on Taz (97:1), the tadkha could be prohibited due to the risk of eating them together with meat – specifically if we assume that tadhka is typically eaten with meat dishes. We see this concept in the Gemara that prohibits consuming bread kneaded with milk. However, there are opinions that limit this stringency only to bread, which is the dietary staple of man.</p>\n\n\n",

However, answer 4 seems to be unsourced.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any sources (commentaries) that say that the nations of the world, especially in the generation in which Moshiach comes, will try to \"lure us away from G-ds path\"?</strong> We have the false prophets discussed in Devarim, but this is not specifically linked to ikvesa d'meshicha.</p>\n<p>I found the Divrei Yoel, <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21045&st=&pgnum=474\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshas Chayei Sarah</a> who says something similair, but I am still looking for other reliable sources.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XxpL9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/XxpL9.jpg\" alt=\"Shu\"t Yad Mordechai\" /></a></p>\n<p>Refer to here: <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1654&st=&pgnum=118\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1654&st=&pgnum=118</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The author is not referring to the nations of the world, but to Jews in power who do not follow the Torah. This is extremely well documented in the Biblical accounts of the First Temple period, when kings who worshiped idols led the citizens astray, and the people did not listen to the prophets. Read the book of Kings and the latter prophets.</p>\n<p>Also, the idea of a tzadik leading the redemption is the idea of Mashiach.</p>\n\n\n",

The term לשון כנען for Slavic languages was already <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.3.9?ven=hebrew%7CMiqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.3.9.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">used</a> by Rashi (mid-11th-early 12th centuries).

Another early attestation of the term שפת כנען, this time a reference to the language of the Russians, appears in a Genizah letter variably dated between the 10th and 13th centuries CE (see <a href=\"https://www.persee.fr/doc/rjuiv_0484-8616_1921_num_73_145_6180\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, p. 95.

Canaanites were also commonly associated by Jews with slaves (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.9.25-26?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet 9:25-26</a>, as well as the commonality of the term עבד כנעני). There has long been a Jewish tradition of using biblical names for various diaspora countries, and so the usage of the term Canaan for the Slavs appears quite natural/logical. Jakobson and Halle, however, believed that the term was used by Jews also as a kind of term of endearment, because the word כנען also evokes associations with the Promised Land, the original Canaan.</p>\n\n\n",

Just as the date palm has only one heart, (as branches do not grow from its trunk but rather the trunk rises and branches emerge only at the top,) so too, the Jewish people have only one heart directed toward their Father in Heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, when the Jewish people are united we form a much stronger channel towards G-d.</p>\n<p>Along this thinking, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.346.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Devarim 346</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(ה) ויהי בישורון מלך, <strong>כשישראל שוים בעצה אחת מלמטה שמו הגדול משתבח מלמעלה</strong> שנאמר ויהי בישורון מלך, אימתי בהתאסף ראשי עם ואין אסיפה אלא ראשי עם שנאמר (במדבר כה ד) ויאמר ה' אל משה קח את כל ראשי העם. דבר אחר כשהנשיא מושיב זקנים בישיבה של מטה שמו הגדול משתבח מלמעלה שנאמר ויהי בישורון מלך אימתי בהתאסף ראשי עם ואין אסיפה אלא זקינים שנאמר (במדבר יא טז) אספה לי שבעים איש מזקני ישראל.</p>\n<p>(Devarim 33:5) \"And He was a King in Yeshurun\": <strong>When Israel are of one counsel below, His great name is exalted above</strong>, viz. \"And He was a King in Yeshurun\" — When? \"when the heads of the people gathered.\" And there is no \"gathering\" but that of the elders, as it is written (Bamidbar 11:16) \"Gather unto Me seventy men from the elders of Israel.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This concept is amplified by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefat_Emet%2C_Genesis%2C_Noach.16.4?vhe=Sefat_emet,_Piotrk%C3%B3w,_1905-1908&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sfas Emes</a> when explaining Migdal Bavel (The Tower of Babel):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שבאמת כח האחדות גדול מאוד לעורר כח השורש מן השמים.דור הפלגה התאספו כולם ולא עלתה בידם</p>\n<p>That in truth, the power of unity is really great to awaken the power of the root from heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another crucial element of maintaining achdus is both the individual and national sense of responsibility it creates for fellow Jews:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shevuot.39a.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shevuos 39a</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל עבירות שבתורה מכל העולם לא והכתיב (ויקרא כו, לז) וכשלו איש באחיו איש בעון אחיו מלמד <strong>שכל ישראל ערבים זה בזה</strong></p>\n<p>And with regard to all of the other transgressions in the Torah, is punishment not exacted from the entire world? But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another” (Leviticus 26:37)? This verse is homiletically interpreted to mean that they shall stumble spiritually, one due to the iniquity of another, which teaches that <strong>the entire Jewish people are considered guarantors for one another</strong>. Apparently, any transgression makes the entire world liable to be punished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now the benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>1) A reason for our longevity</strong></p>\n<p>In times of trouble, it is when we group together, we are able to withstand the trials and tribulations and emerge as one.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nitzavim.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma - Nitzavim 1:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַתֶּם נִצָּבִים הַיּוֹם. זֶה שֶׁאָמַר הַכָּתוּב: הָפוֹךְ רְשָׁעִים וְאֵינָם, וּבֵית צַדִּיקִים יַעֲמֹד (משלי יב, ז). כָּל זְמַן שֶׁהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מִסְתַּכֵּל בְּמַעֲשֵׂיהֶם שֶׁל רְשָׁעִים וּמְהַפֵּךְ בָּהֶם, אֵין לָהֶם תְּקוּמָה. הָפַךְ בְּמַעֲשֵׂיהֶם שֶׁל דּוֹר הַמַּבּוּל, לֹא הָיְתָה לָהֶם תְּקוּמָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וַיִּמַּח אֶת כָּל הַיְקוּם (בראשית ז, כג). הָפַךְ בְּמַעֲשֵׂיהֶם שֶׁל אַנְשֵׁי סְדוֹם, וְלֹא הָיְתָה בָהֶן תְּקוּמָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וַיַּהֲפֹךְ אֶת הֶעָרִים הָאֵל (שם יט, כה). הָפַךְ בְּמַעֲשֵׂיהֶם שֶׁל מִצְרִים, וְלֹא הָיְתָה לָהֶן תְּקוּמָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: לֹא נִשְׁאַר בָּהֶם עַד אֶחָד (שמות יד, כח). הָפַךְ בַּמַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁל בָּבֶל וְלֹא הָיְתָה לָהּ תְּקוּמָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וְהִכְרַתִּי לְבָבֶל שֵׁם וּשְׁאָר וְנִין וָנֶכֶד (ישעיה יד, כב). וְעַל כֻּלָּם אָמַר דָּוִד, שָׁם נָפְלוּ פּוֹעֲלֵי אָוֶן וְגוֹ' (תהלים לו, יג). <strong>אֲבָל יִשְׂרָאֵל, נוֹפְלִין וְעוֹמְדִין</strong>. וְכֵן הוּא אוֹמֵר, אַל תִּשְׂמְחִי אוֹיַבְתִּי לִי כִּי נָפַלְתִּי קָמְתִּי וְגוֹ' (מיכה ז, ח).</p>\n<p>(Deut. 29:9:) “You are standing today.” This text is related (to Prov. 12:7), “The wicked are overturned (rt.: hpk) and are no more, but the house of the righteous shall stand.” Every time that the Holy One, blessed be He, looks at the works of the wicked and turns (rt.: hpk) them over (examines them), there is no recovery for them.

Why was the Torah not given in the Holy Land, Eretz Yisrael?  The answer lies, tells the Midrash, in the fact that a midbar has no ownership on itself. A midbar belongs to no one. So too, everyone has an equal claim to the Torah (see also Midrash Tanchuma, Chukas 21:1)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rabbisacks.org/covenant-conversation/bamidbar/wilderness-and-revelation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Elsewhere</a>, Rabbi Sacks explains the deeper meaning behind the reason why the Torah was given in the midbar:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The giving of the Torah in the wilderness is an essential feature of Jewish history. Had the Israelites received the Torah in the land, it would be indissolubly associated with the land. Exile would mean the end of the covenant. It would make no more sense to keep Torah while in exile than to obey the laws of Russia while living in Spain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What made the G-d of Israel different was the fact that He was sovereign of the universe, not a local deity. That is why the Jewish people survived dispersion. Only the G-d of everywhere can be found and worshipped anywhere.</p>\n<p>I would strongly recommend this article, to further grasp the essence of the word \"midbar\" and the relationship between the giving of the Torah and us being in exile.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rabbisacks.org/covenant-conversation/bamidbar/wilderness-and-revelation/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.rabbisacks.org/covenant-conversation/bamidbar/wilderness-and-revelation/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The noun <strong>Midbar</strong> is best translated as <em>wilderness</em>, not necessarily <em>desert</em>.</p>\n<p>The distinction being that a wilderness is a place devoid of human habitation and settlements.</p>\n<p>The term <em>desert</em>, although coincidentally usually not conducive to human settlement, is only about a lack of precipitation, rainfall or snowfall. And to emphasize, it doesn’t necessarily imply a lack of availability of water. A desert can be filled with wellsprings, underground aquifers or like the continent of Antarctica can be covered with ice and snow because whatever precipitation has ever fallen there over the millennia has not evaporated because of the extreme and continuous cold.</p>\n<p>So returning to the subject of wilderness being devoid of human settlement, the Torah, in its categorization of different types of creations, has four general categories of: inanimate objects דומם (things which are silent and do not have their own power of locomotion), plants צומח (things which sprout, usually, but not limited to <em>sprouting from</em> the ground), animals חיות (meaning things which do not sprout and which possess the power of self-locomotion. They may also be able to make noises and even possess some form of communication other than speech.) and humanoids מדבר (beings which have the power of speech, either oral or written or both).</p>\n<p>And this underlines the association of wilderness מדבר (pronounced Midbar) and humanoid מדבר (pronounced M’Daber, meaning speak or speech) settlement. That a wilderness can be profusely filled with all kinds of life, but is devoid of speech.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do the halakhot relating to stealing apply to people’s chokhmah / daas too?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom.</p>\n<p>I have been wondering if it is considered theft / stealing / robbery if one tries to acquire another’s chokhmah / daas without being honest about what one is doing. E.g. Asking questions with the wholly selfish motive of acquiring chokhmah / daas from a person. An example: one is desirous for chokhmah / daas and treats another person’s store of chokhmah / daas as a well to take from, so to speak, without regard for a person’s feelings. I suppose what I am asking is if a person’s knowledge etc. should be treated as their property, like any other property, and thus whether the halakhot relating to property apply here.</p>\n<p>I am aware that such actions are not loving one’s fellow as oneself. But is this kind of thing considered stealing / robbery? Have any commentators addressed this matter?</p>\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n<p>EDIT - a more tangible example provided here, in response to a query:</p>\n<p>Jim knows that chokhmah / daas preserves life. He thus sets about acquiring it wherever he can. He shares lunch with Bob and makes an effort to extract all the chokhmah / daas he can from Bob in the time he has with him. He does not tell Bob that this is his intention. His pursuit of chokhmah / daas here is general, not pertaining to any particular problem or issue. His motive is also completely selfish.</p>\n<p>I have been informed, since the original posting, that this is geneivat daas. Is it some other type of theft as well?</p>\n\n\n",

Many Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Taz in that respect while e.g., Chabad Hassidim often follow the Shulchan Aruch Harav / Admur Hazaken.

Soloveitchik’s Halakhic Man\"</a> by Rabbi Reuven Ziegler. It could be considered a thorough summary of the famous sefer \"The Halakhic Man\" from Rav Soloveitchik zt\"l. In it, the author explains different approaches to different (European) philosophical approaches to religion. For example, he quotes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Immanuel Kant</a>, a German philosopher and one of the most controversial figures in Western philosophy.</p>\n<p>For example, Kant says that Judaism is considered <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronomy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">heteronomous</a>, e.g. being influenced/ forced by the force outside an individual. To this, Rav Soloveitchik zt\"l responded in two ways, says the author (p. 298)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First, he shows that there is broad autonomy within Judaism (at least for the master of halakhic study). Halakha is the product of divine revelation; but once halakha was given at Sinai, human reason is its final arbiter both on the level of study (lomdus) and application (pesak). Second, he shows that heteronomy is also important and has its place. In fact, more than the Rav addresses the technical philosophical issue of autonomy, he fosters an ethic of autonomy, a positive evaluation of halakhic man’s sense of freedom, individuality, and self-worth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are there other sources that explicitly deal with the refutement of the philosophical ideas of Immanuel Kant? Rav Soloveitchik zt\"l is one of them, but I was wondering if there are other works (preferably in English) that give an detailled reaction to these ideas.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to reconcile Rashi's view/logic with Rabbi Ulla's three Noahide commandments? Who is correct?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=59&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 59a</a>, Rashi writes (s.v. לזה ולזה נאמרה):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי יהיב קודשא בריך הוא תורה לישראל לא שקלינהו להנך מבני נח וכדקיימי להו קיימי<br />\nWhen Hakadosh Baruch Hu gave the Torah to Yisroel, he did not take those [Noahide laws] from Bnei Noach, and they remain as they were</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi states that the Noahide commandments that were given to Noah were unchanged.</p>\n<p>However, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.92a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 92a</a>, Rabbi Ulla states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This verse refers to the thirty commandments which the Noachites have accepted. But they keep only three of them. One, they do not draw up marriage contracts for  homosexuals. Two, they do not merchandize (human) flesh in the marketplace. <strong>Three, they do have respect for the Torah (and for Torah scholars)</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this, two questions arise: a) Why do Noahides allegedly only keep three commandments <strong>and more importantly</strong> b) Why is a commandment to respect Torah scholars included in the Noahide commandments when the Torah wasn't even given at the time, not to mention that depending on how we define Torah scholars, even <em>after</em> the Torah was given, proper Torah scholarship didn't emerge until centuries later.</p>\n<p>Basically, why three and why that specific one. Most codifications of Noahide laws have much more than three, and they include the respecting-the-Torah commandment.</p>\n<p>According to Rashi's logic, it would make no sense to have a commandment to respect Torah scholars to Noahides if the Torah wasn't even given and so Torah scholars didn't even exist (assuming that we're referring to human Torah scholars), not to mention that the universal and eternal Noahide commandments cannot change as G-d, blessed be He, Himself cannot change.</p>\n<p>So how to reconcile this? Is there a commandment for Noahides to respect Torah scholars or not? Logic would say no, but Rabbi Ulla says yes.</p>\n<p>Please refrain from referring to Rambam on this matter since there is some debate about the interpretation here.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>So I looked into this myself, and I think I arrived at an answer.</p>\n<p>a) According to <a href=\"https://www.markfoster.net/dcf/Seven_Laws_of_Noah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this website</a>, it states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>According to Ulla, while the Gentiles were given thirty commandments, in reality they do none of them. The notice that they “observe” three of the thirty is tongue-in-cheek, for the manner in which they “observe” them is in reality proof of their paganism.</strong> Thus, though they engage in homosexual relations,they do not sanctify such relationships with a marriage contract (ketubbah). Likewise, even though they eat dead meat (and some would understand this even to include human flesh), they do not sell it openly in the markets (they don’t weigh it out).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so on. Basically, it states that Rabbi Ulla is saying that there are 30 mitzvot given, but that the non-Jews are really doing none of them except for three which they are \"technically\" observing. So there is no issue with Rabbi Ulla's statement according to this as its merely stating what the non-Jews were doing. Rabbi Ulla was still maintaining the thirty mitzvot statement. In reality, non-Jews are supposed to be keeping all of the thirty mitzvot that Rabbi Ulla is thinking of, but they're actually performing only three unfortunately. It does not refer to the idea that the other 27 mitzvot were abrogated or anything like that.</p>\n<p>b) According to Rabbi Moshe Weiner in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35230401\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Divine Code: The Guide to Observing the Noahide Code, Revealed from Mount Sinai in the Torah of Moses </a>, which is dubbed as the \"Shulchan Aruch\" of the Noahide laws, having been given a \"stamp of approval\" by numerous halachic authorities and Rabbis, including I believe two former Chief Rabbis of Israel, he states at the beginning of the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rambam explains in Laws of Kings 8:11: “...The Holy One, blessed be He, commanded them [the Seven Noahide Commandments] in the Torah, and informed us through Moses our teacher that Noaĥ’s descendants had been previously commanded to fulfill them.” <strong>This means that even though Noaĥ’s descendants were previously commanded to fulfill them – and this Divine command was not nullified in legal terms, and Gentiles are still obligated by the power of the original commands – nevertheless, there were more details added by God through Moses at the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Clearly, the Noahide Commandments were commanded to Moses, because even though they were commanded previously to Adam and Noaĥ, they were never written down as Torah before Mount Sinai.</strong> Their recording in the Written Torah was through Moses, and their explanations and details as transmitted in the Oral Torah were given to Moses, as will be explained. According to his above-cited ruling, Rambam explains that (a) the descendants of Noaĥ are obligated to observe their Seven Commandments because these were commanded to them by God through Moses, and (b) when the Torah was given by God through Moses, there was a spiritual dimension that He added for the Gentiles as well as for the Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So basically the reconciliation is that despite Noah and his descendants being commanded to fulfil the original mitzvot, at the time the Torah was given at Mt. Sinai, additional laws were added (and as far as I can recall, even some non-Israelites/people who didn't go on to become Israelites, like some Egyptians were there, so it makes sense for the Noahide mitzvot to get expanded so that they'd hear it for themselves too in my view), hence why we find the mitzvot of respecting the Torah scholars in there because Torah scholarship (studying the Torah that was given) begins immediately after Mt. Sinai revelation.</p>\n<p>In summary, there are more than three Noahide commandments, and Rabbi Ulla was simply listing the three that the non-Jews were performing instead of doing the full thirty that Rabbi Ulla was stating, and respecting the Torah scholars is a Noahide commandment because Noahide commandments despite never being abrogated, were added upon after the revelation at Mt. Sinai. According to Rabbi Moshe Weiner who cites Rambam, this is one of the reasons why its necessary to acknowledge that one is following the Noahide mitzvot <em>because</em> they come from the revelation and not merely from one's personal reason/rational deduction.</p>\n\n\n",

Who is it, then, that will curse him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Many Rishonim observe a nuanced distinction in the text. They highlight that \"וּמְקַלֶּלְךָ֖\" is expressed in the singular form, whereas \"מְבָ֣רְכֶ֔יךָ\" is written in the plural. From this grammatical distinction, they draw an interpretation that those who curse Avraham are relatively few, while those who bless him are numerous. In the Targum Yonason's interpretation, the verse is taken quite literally, suggesting that only one individual, Bilam, will be the one to curse Avraham. (see Baal Hatorim that explains: ומקללך אאור – בגימטריא זה בלעם הבא לקלל בניך.) Rabeinu Bichayeh, on the other hand, identifies this individual as Nimrod.</p>\n<p>However, it doesn't seem like everyone liked Avraham at the time of this blessing, especially since we know that he was thrown into a furnace of fire.

According to Baal Hamaor, the only way Temple Vessels are desecrated is through the process of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me%27ilah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">meilah</a></em> [loosely: the misuse of consecrated items, through which they become desecrated]. Accordingly, it would only be if used by Jews, and are subject to a list of criteria beyond the scope of this answer [See <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam Hil. Meilah]</a>. Notably, it would not apply to most Temple Vessels which had <em>kedushas haguf</em>.</p>\n<p>The Ramban disagrees with Baal Hamaor - primarily because the Temple Vessels have <em>kedushas haguf</em> status, which is not subject to desecration through <em>meilah</em>; adittionally, desecration through <em>meilah</em> is specifically through inadvertent use; furthermore, the walls of the Temple itself are not subject to <em>meilah</em>, and they too were desecrated through the Temple invasion.</p>\n<p>Ramban argues that 'באו פריצים וחללוה' is not through the process of <em>meilah</em>, but a totally separate halachic clause that when captured by gentiles, the Temple Vessels lose their <em>kedushah</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא ודאי על ידי עובדי כוכבים יצאו לחולין, דקרא בעובדי כוכבים כתיב,\nשהרי נביא מתנבא על המקדש שיחרב, ואמר שיצא לחולין על ידם, וגזירת הכתוב\nהיה הכל, אע\"פ שאין מעילה בקרקעות ואע\"פ שאינם בני מעילה, והיינו דכתיב\nנמי (יחזקאל ז, כא) 'ונתתיו ביד הזרים לבז ולרשעי הארץ לשלל וחללוהו',\nוכלים דאחז לא יצאו לחולין, דלא בישראל כתיב קרא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, it would seem that Rashi and Ramban would consider the vessels captured by the Romans as devoid of any <em>kedushah</em> and therefore not subject to the general laws of consecrated Temple Vessels.</p>\n<p>However, many commentators have posed numerous difficulties with the opinion of the Ramban*, and have been forced to suggest various alternative interpretations of the Ramban.</p>\n<p>According to some**, the Ramban only proposes a temporary desecration - in the duration of the Vessels' captivity under Gentile authority, they lose their holiness. This holiness is automatically reinstated upon return to Jewish hands.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*For example, how after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabean_Revolt\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maccabean Revolt</a> did the Temple regain it's <em>kedusha</em>. According to Ramban that the Temple itself is also subject to the desecration of ובאו פריצים וחללוה, it should have lost any <em>kedusha</em> with the conquest of the Greeks. See Sheilas David (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1110&st=&pgnum=46\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 3</a>), .</p>\n<p>** Beis Yitzchak (OC <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=626&pgnum=99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">27</a>), Afikei Mayim (R' Moshe Shapira, Chanuka pg 81)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Regarding the lose of holiness, see below:</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shita_Mekubetzet_on_Bava_Metzia.24b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shita Mekubetzes (Bava Metzia 24b)</a>, if the vessels were taken by force, they would lose their status of kedusha (holiness). If an army took the vessels, e.g. the Greek or someone else, and it was considered \"looting\", the vessels would lose their holiness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובתשובת שאלה להרמב\"ם כתוב וזה לשונו: מועתק מלשון ערבי. שאלת מי שקנו מן השוללים ספרי קדש לקצת בתי כנסיות שבמדינות אם נאמר שקנה או אם נכפהו על לקיחתו ממנו ואם נאמר שילקח ממנו בעל כרחו אם ינתן לו הסך שקנהו בו ואם יחזיר לאותו בית כנסת עצמה או לזולתו. תשובה אם ביזה זו היתה במצות המלך קנה ובטל דין הקדש ואפילו כלי המקדש כשנשללו בטלה קדושתן אמרו ובאו בה פריצים וחללוה. אמנם אם שללו בלי רשות המלך או נגנבו ישבע בנקיטת חפץ כמה הוציא ויטול ויחזור זה הספר למקומו כדין מי שנתברר לנו בו שנגנבו לו כליו וספריו. וכתב משמע עד כאן. ומה שכתב אמרו ובאו בה פריצים וחללוה הוא בעבודה זרה פרק רבי ישמעאל (עבודה זרה דף נב) ועיין לעיל בדבור המתחיל לא צריכא לאהדורי לצורבא מרבנן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The vessels were taken from the Beis HaMikdash, without permission, so it could be considered stealing, and according to the Shita Mekubetzes, that is also a reason why vessels could lose their kedusha-status.</p>\n\n\n",

He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sages, of blessed memory, frequently allude to persecutions in the following manner: \"once the wicked government passed the following decree of persecution,\" or, \"they decreed so and so.\" After a while G-d would make the decree null and void by destroying the power which issued it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this, and based on the Gemara you quoted, the Rebbe explains that this means that in order for Moshiach to come, the State of Israel, which is no by no means a Torah-state, must lose its powers.</p>\n<p>In the translated hakdama to Vayoel Moshe, it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have also quoted <sub>75</sub>the words of the Gemara in Sanhedrin 98a: “The son of Dovid will not come until the lowly kingdom departs from Israel.” Rashi explains: “Until Israel has no form of government, even an unimportant and weak one.”<sub>76</sub> So we see that before the coming of moshiach that lowly state will disappear, since his coming is impossible otherwise, and the state is delaying the true redemption. And a similar thing is explicit in the words of the Rambam in Igeres Teiman. <sub>77</sub>But we need Heavenly mercy so that that state should come to an end only through power from above, from Hashem, not through the nations, because if it happens through the nations, Heaven forbid, it would obviously be a tremendous danger to the Jewish people.

Refer to Efes Biltecha Goaleinu (p. 303), where the Rambam is quoted and it explains that only after the coming of Moshiach, there will be a Government in Eretz Yisrael. And thus, says the Rebbe, the State that is now ruling, must make way.</p>\n<p>He will cut the branches with pruning shears” (Yeshayahu 18:5) - This posuk, which the Satmar Rebbe quotes in the hakdama, but also in siman 68, has a lot of meforshim that say it refers to the power of the nations. See also the Targum there. But the Rebbe offers another insight. Refer to the siman.</p>\n<p>This seems also be the language of Rabbi Yisroel of Shklov, in his work פאת השלחן (Hilchos Eretz Yisrael, Chapter 1:3). He says that restoring the Jewish kingdom would be not allowed.</p>\n<p>In another footnote, the translator of Vayoel Moshe hakdama, writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“When the gentiles think that this people will never have their own government and state, and they will never be redeemed from their exile, and all the sages of the world say this unanimously, including the sorcerers and those who understand the powers, Hashem will annul their thoughts and their false logic, and then moshiach will be revealed. This is what Yishaya (44:25-26) said, ‘Who frustrates the signs of imposters, and diviners He makes mad; He turns the wise backwards, and makes their knowledge foolish. He fulfills the word of His servant, and the counsel of His messenger He completes; Who says of Jerusalem, “It shall be settled,” and of the cities of Judah, “They shall be built, and its ruins I will erect.”’ That is the correct belief that Jews should hold.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Edit: This Shabbos, I was reading the Yalkut Biurim section of the Oz VeHadar Gemara in Sanhedrin. There, on page 105, it explains the Gemara. It says that it refers to the kingdom that is in Yisrael, that is by no means a Torah driven kingdom. Not even the 7 Noahide laws. And that is why, according to that explanation, the kingdom must be removed in order for Moshiach to come. The Yalkut Biurim refers to this as the \"unworthy leaders\", e.g. leaders that drive people away from Torah.</p>\n<p>Footnotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>75 Siman 68</p>\n<p>76 The Gemara cites a verse in support of this: “He will cut the\nbranches with pruning shears” (Yishaya 18:5). Rashi on Yishaya, as\nwell as the Targum and the Radak, say that it means Hashem will cut\ndown the non-Jewish nations. Accordingly, the Gemara would mean, “The\nson of Dovid will not come until the lowly non-Jewish kingdom is no\nlonger in power over Israel.” But Rashi on the Gemara clearly\ninterprets it to mean that the Jews will not have a kingdom. Possibly\nRashi on Yishaya represents an alternative interpretation of the\nGemara, or perhaps Rashi held that although this is the simple meaning\nof the verse, the Gemara could not have understood it that way,\nbecause if so the Gemara would be saying that before moshiach the Jews\nwill be free from non-Jewish rule, which would contradict the\nprinciple that \"there is no difference between this world and the days\nof moshiach except for the subjugation of the nations\" (Shabbos 63a).</p>\n<p>77 “When the gentiles think that this people will never have their own\ngovernment and state, and they will never be redeemed from their\nexile, and all the sages of the world say this unanimously, including\nthe sorcerers and those who understand the powers, Hashem will annul\ntheir thoughts and their false logic, and then moshiach will be\nrevealed.

    "content": "# How can Ramban give this reason?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Nedarim 32a gives 3 reasons for why the Jews were put into slavery in Egypt because of Abraham (one is because he made his students fight in the war against the kings, the other is that he asked Gd how he will know that his children will inherit the land, and the third possibility is because he allowed the king of Sodom to keep the people he saved, thereby preventing them from being brought under the Shchinah).</p>\n<p>The Ramban however, on the pasuk when Abraham goes down to Egypt, gives the fact that Abraham went down to Egypt on his own as the reason for the Jews’ slavery and even goes as far to call Abraham a sinner. How can Ramban give this new reason that’s not found in the gemara?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ramban's viewpoint is supported by a passage from the <a href=\"https://%5BZohar:%5D%5B1%5D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a>, a significant work in Jewish mysticism. In this text, Rabbi Yehuda explains that because Abraham went to Egypt without a clear divine command, his descendants endured four hundred years of slavery. The key phrase is, \"and Abram went down to Egypt.\" Notably, it doesn't say that God told him to 'Go down to Egypt.' This passage from the Zohar provides strong backing for Ramban's perspective, emphasizing that Abraham's independent journey to Egypt, without clear divine guidance, played a crucial role in the subsequent enslavement of the Jewish people. This affirms the validity and relevance of the Ramban's perspective.</p>\n<p>However, Likkutei Sichos<sup>1</sup> offers a more nuanced perspective, explaining that, even according to the Ramban, Abraham, one of our forefathers and a Tzadik (righteous person), couldn't have sinned conventionally due to his lack of a Yetzer Harah (evil inclination). Instead, his \"sin\" is better understood as a \"חטא,\" derived from the term \"חסרון,\" symbolizing a lack of holiness. This interpretation highlights Abraham's inherent holiness, a concept in harmony with references in both Shabbos 63a and Yerushalmi Brachos 9:5.</p>\n<p><sub>1 [<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wEkqagro-adRh98PBmKNi-2ZCVkH6J0W/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Original</a>. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tkKqdeFG23g5bC08kC67TkkEzD9LBIDu/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew Translation</a>.\n<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2474711/jewish/Torah-Studies-Lech-Lecha.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Jonathan Sack's English Adapdation</a>]</sub></p>\n\n\n",

And he explained to me in Yiddish - \"after the foreign gods in their midst, in the land\" does not mean that they will not pray Shacharis, but rather according to the simple explanation, they will worship idolatry, and if that is not enough, the verse continues, \"they will forsake me\", it does not mean that they will not pray Minchah, but that they will not worship me, even in partnership, and if that is not enough, then the continuation of the verse, \"And break my covenant\", does not mean that they will not pray Maariv, but that they will not face it, and also He continued in the verse, \"And I left them, and I hid my face from them etc.\"</p>\n<p>\"Nu\", Maran raised his head to me and said, \"Of course you will agree that this is a worse situation than what you are describing to me, but we will study further and now write this song for you and teach the Bnei Yisrael the study of the Torah will be a cure for all deterioration even to the point of idolatry and breaking the covenant and will return the Bnei Yisrael to Hashem's Torah.

One can feed dogs before one eats<sup>1</sup>, and then if a person would - after they have eaten - eat in front of them, the dogs would still desire the food just as much. It's almost impossible to eat in front of the dog without causing the dog a lot of distress and hunger pangs. Anyone who has ever had a dog would know! It is actually <em>assur</em> to give one's animals human food that is still good<sup>2</sup>, so one can't feed them. Even if one can find a solution to that<sup>3</sup>, one would still not be solving the problem. They will continue to want more and more and no amount of offers of food would satisfy them.</p>\n<p>So I am just wondering if there is any discussion about whether it is allowed to eat in front of (well fed) dogs?

Once Melchizedek, traditionally identified as Shem, placed the blessing of Abraham before the blessing of the Omnipresent, He had the priesthood emerge from Abraham in particular, and not from any other descendant of Shem.

Abraham said to him: And does one place the blessing of the servant before the blessing of his master? You should have blessed God first. Immediately the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave the priesthood to Abraham, as it is stated: “The Lord says to my lord: Sit at My right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.110.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 110:1</a>), and afterward it is written: “The Lord has sworn, and will not repent: you shall be a priest forever, because you are a king of righteousness [al divrati malki tzedek]” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.110.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 110:4</a>), which is explained homiletically to mean: Due to the improper words [divrati] of Melchizedek, the offspring of Abraham shall be priests of God forever.

This has already been discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/53085/did-pharaoh-himself-drown-at-yam-suf\">here</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The following is from <em>Gods & Myths of Ancient Egypt</em> by Lucia Gahlin: In ancient Egypt, starting from the Old Kingdom (c. 2686-c.2181 BCE), the Pharaohs were identified with divinity. Two names given <em>Hor</em> and <em>Hor Nebw</em> would be given to all Pharaohs, a clear indication they were considered part of the divine.</p>\n<p>In the New Kingdom (c.1505-c.1069 BCE), rules claimed to be the children of <em>Amun</em>. It seems that during the period of the Exodus, Egypt was in the middle of a long decline in how divine they view their leaders. It seems it was never dropped that they are divine, but the human side to their nature stood out more.</p>\n<p>Following this, there seems to be a turn in the leadership. Akhenaten (c.1352-c.1336 BCE, see <em>Akhenaten's New Religion</em>) elevated himself and his family to the status of a divine royal family, whose members were worshipped at shrines throughout the city of Achetaten. Ramesses II (c.1279-c.1213 BCE) had a cult worshipping him and all the statues of himself he put throughout the land.</p>\n<p>So yes, there's no reason to doubt that Pharaoh of the Exodus believed he was a diety (although this was clearly a shallow belief, given the midrash brought in Dov's answer that he would hide the fact that he needed to relieve himself from the people). This point is very relevant to the story and is mentioned in many places in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/137804/31534\">our tradition</a>.</p>\n<p>What did Moshe do to eliminate Pharaoh? I think the answer is very simple: he listened to Hashem in all that Hashem told him to do:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּעַשׂ מֹשֶׁה וְאַהֲרֹן כַּאֲשֶׁר צִוָּה ה' אֹתָם כֵּן עָשׂוּ׃</p>\n<p>And Moshe and Aharon did as Hashem commanded them, so they did (Shemot 7:6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hashem is the one who eliminated Pharaoh, and that is the theme of the recounting of the Exodus in our tradition. Moshe's role was to be Hashem's mouth piece and actor in obeying Hashem's instructions, all of which would eventually lead to the elimination of Pharoah, and all his power, and all his false gods and beliefs. May I recommend <em>Let My Nation Go</em> by Yosef Deutsch that brings the midrashim together in a long detailed recounting, that thoroughly explains this point. Tit for tat, Hashem disarms every claim to divinty that Pharaoh had. See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIZ-zLZKvrM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a> for a good explanation.</p>\n\n\n",

Such, indeed, is the method of the Holy One, blessed be He: He brings punishment upon the nations so that Israel may hear of it and fear Him.\".</p>\n<p>This seems problematic, since should it be obvious that G-d gives us the ability to truly return to Him? Why did G-d did not give Pharaoh this option?</p>\n<p>I then cite the Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters.8.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemonah Perakim (chapter 8)</a> in which he says that all that happened to B'nei Yisrael in Mitzrayim was done with the free will of pharaoh:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This they did through the dictates of their own free will and the evil passions of their hearts, without any external constraint forcing them thereto. The punishment which G-d then inflicted upon them was that He withheld from them the power of repentance, so that there should fall upon them that punishment which justice declared should he meted out to them. The fact that they were prevented from repenting manifested itself by Pharaoh's not dismissing them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Siftei Chakhamim on Rashi explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is better for Me that his heart be hardened. . . In other words, if I do not harden Pharaoh’s heart he will surely repent. <strong>But it is revealed to Me that he will not really repent wholeheartedly.</strong> And then, if I smite him with plagues and punish him, people will say that Hashem brings punishment upon repenters — for they will not know that Pharaoh’s repentance was not wholehearted. Therefore I will harden his heart so that he will not repent at all, and then I will be able to increase My wonders and punish him for all to see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.7.3?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban (Shemos 7:3)</a> asks a famous question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If G-d hardened Pharaoh’s heart, what then was his transgression [since he had no choice]?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramban answers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two answers, which both hold true: First, Pharaoh, in his wickedness, had unjustifiably treated the Jews terribly, so he was punished with the withdrawal of the path of repentance, and there are many verses regarding this in the Torah and the Writings, and he was punished by his original deeds. Secondly, only the second half of the [ten] plagues were brought upon Egypt due to Pharaoh’s transgressions, as the Torah states, And Pharaoh’s heart was strengthened, (Shemot 7:13, 26; 8:15), and Pharaoh hardened his heart (ibid. 8:28, 9:7). He did not want to send the Jews out of Egypt for the glory of God; rather, when the plagues increased and he was becoming too worn out to withstand them, his heart softened and he decided to send them out because of the severity of the plagues themselves, but not in order to do the will of his Creator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So based on these meforshim, it would seem that Pharaoh, even by the tenth plague, never truly repented, he just wanted to \"get it over with\".</p>\n<p>The Tur, Rabbi Yaakov ben Asher, in his commentary Tur HaAroch on Shemos 9:12 explains that Gd had to harden Pharaoh's heart to prevent Pharaoh from letting the Jewish people go sooner. This, the Tur explains, is to ensure that the full range of plagues were exposed to Mitzrayim.</p>\n<p>The Malbim says that G-d hardened the heart of pharaoh because then, the Jewish people wouldn't be let go by him, so that pharaoh and the Egyptians could see G-ds existence and to let them see that G-d rules the world.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Darash Moshe al HaTorah, parashas Vaera, p. 106)  explains that after the 6 plagues, pharaoh only wanted to let the Jewish people go out of fear for further plagues, not because he acknowledged G-d.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.13.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah 13:3</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Starting about the time of Rabeenu Tam and his nephew R\"I Hazaken -R Yitzchak of Dampierre, many of the senior talmidim of the great tosafists in france compiled their masters \"tosafos\" on various tractates, often adding their own remarks as well. These were variously referred to as tosafos of the master or the pupil. Some of the later Tosafists (such as Mahr\"M RoSh and R eliezer mtuch) compiled versions of Tosafos themselves, with the purpose of giving over the teachings of the R\"I and his great talmidim, their own comments only added \"אגב\".</p>\n<p>When tosfos was added to the page of early editions of the talmud, the particualr tosfos printed depended mostly on what was available to the publisher.\nLater Achronim often had other versions of Tosfos in manuscript. These were sometimes referred as \"Tosfos Yeshonim\" as in old manuscript of tosfos.\nThere is no connection between tosfos yeshanim for one tractate and tosfos yeshanim on another. Authorship must be determined for each one individually(often there isn't an easy way for it to be determined definitively).\nSome of the tosfos yeshanim manuscripts were eventually printed on the margins of later editions of the talmud. While the tosfos yeshanim were originally a full version of tosafos on that tractate, the printers often only included small glosses which they consided to be substantially different than the tosfos already printed on the page, which is what you are seeing on the margins in the Vilna Shas.</p>\n<p>Hope this was helpful.</p>\n\n\n",

Please refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.2.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> Mishnah</a>, which says that for the daily offering, nine priests were involved.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daily offering is sacrificed and its limbs are carried by nine priests, as mentioned in a previous mishna. These nine carry the limbs and the accompanying libations and meal-offerings. Occasionally, the service is performed by ten priests, occasionally by eleven, and sometimes by twelve priests; no fewer than nine and no more than twelve. How so? The daily offering itself is sacrificed by nine priests, as explained earlier. On the festival of Sukkot a priest in whose hand is a jug of water for the water libation is added, and there are ten priests. On Sukkot, a water libation is poured on the altar in addition to the standard wine libation. In the daily afternoon offering, eleven priests participate in the service. How so? The daily offering itself is sacrificed by nine, and there are an additional two priests in whose hands are two logs that are placed on the altar. The mitzva of placing the two logs in the morning was assigned in the first lottery, as the Gemara explained earlier. On Shabbat, eleven priests participate. How so? The daily morning offering itself is performed by nine, and there are an additional two priests in whose hands are two vessels of frankincense that accompany the shewbread. This frankincense is burned on Shabbat. And on Shabbat that occurs within the festival of Sukkot there is an additional priest in whose hand is a jug of water for the water libation, for a total of twelve priests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara says that no more than 12, and no fewer than 9 priests where involved in the performance of the daily service.</p>\n<p>The Bartenura also says something interesting on that Mishnah. He explains that these 9 priests were divided over different parts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עצמו. בכל יום תשעה. ששה לאברים ולקרבים, כדאמרינן לעיל, ואחד לסולת. ואחד לחביתין ואחד ליין:\nעצמו – on every day, nine [priests]; six for the limbs and the innards, as we stated above (Mishnah 3) and one for the fine flour, and one for the baked cakes and one for the wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A bull was offered by 24 priests, as the Mishnah a bit further explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A bull is sacrificed by twenty-four priests. How so? The head and the right leg are sacrificed first, but due to its size the head is carried by one priest and the leg by two. The tail and the left leg are carried as follows: The tail is sacrificed by two and the leg by two. The breast and the neck are carried as follows: The breast is offered by one and the neck by three priests. The two forelegs are carried by two priests, and the two flanks are carried by two. The intestines and the fine flour and the wine are carried by three each, because the meal-offering and wine libation that accompany a bull are larger than those that accompany a ram.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, an individual could also \"handle\" the bull-service by himself. Refer also to the Bartenura.</p>\n<p>I am not going to describe the full list, but I would highly recommend reading it yourself, including the Gemara on that Mishnayos.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.2.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.2.5</a></p>\n<p>Orthodox Union also has a nice summary. <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/life/torah/masechet_yoma_23a29b/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Mishnayot on today’s daf focus on the number of kohanim needed to perform the various tasks that made up the daily Temple service. Obviously, any “special events” that were going on on a given day would affect the number of kohanim that were needed. The Mishnah teaches, for example, that the korban tamid, which was the first sacrifice brought every day, was brought by nine, ten, eleven or twelve kohanim, depending on the day.</p>\n<p>The korban tamid itself needed nine kohanim. On Sukkot, when there\nalso was a water libation, an extra kohen was needed to carry the jug\nof water.</p>\n<p>The afternoon korban tamid needed eleven kohanim; the additional two\nkohanim carried extra wood to the altar.</p>\n<p>On Shabbat there were eleven kohanim involved, two of whom carried the\nlevona (frankincense) for the Lechem HaPanim (show bread).

The outer side of the retzuos are what is necessary to be black since that is a halacha L'Moshe M'sinai. The Rambam does note that it is beautiful for all of the teffilin to be completely black .</p>\n<p>Text of Rambam :</p>\n<p>וְלֹא יִהְיֶה אֲחוֹרֵי הָרְצוּעָה לְעוֹלָם אֶלָּא כְּעֵין הַקְּצִיצָה אִם יְרֻקָּה יְרֻקִּין וְאִם לְבָנָה לְבָנִים. וְנוֹי הוּא לַתְּפִלִּין שֶׁיִּהְיוּ כֻּלָּן שְׁחוֹרוֹת הַקְּצִיצָה וְהָרְצוּעָה כֻּלָּהּ:</p>\n<p>Chabad Translation :</p>\n<p>The back of the straps should be the same color as the compartment; if it is green, they should be green; if it is white, they should be white. It is attractive for tefillin to be entirely black, the compartments and the entire strap.</p>\n<p>However, in the very next halacha the Rambam explains that if one covers his teffilin with gold they aren't acceptable.  This is based off the Mishna in megillah. Some meforshim learn that the invaildiation is the material isn't from an animal. While other learn that it's a color issue and black must be used (pshat in the Yerushalmi ,not like the Rambam).</p>\n<p>In conclusion, it would be rather odd that Mordechai would do something that is considered invalid by the Mishna.</p>\n<p>Text of Rambam 15:</p>\n<p>\"If, however, leather from a non-kosher species was used or if they were covered with gold, they are not acceptable.\"</p>\n\n\n",

If\none applies ointment and smoothes its surface to spread it, he\nviolates Torah law, as Memare’aĥ is a tolada of Memaĥek (Shabbat 75b;\nabove, 18:6). It is also forbidden to place the ointment onto the body\nor the bandage without spreading it, out of concern that one will end\nup spreading it. Even if the bandage was prepared with ointment before\nShabbat, one may not place it on the wound on Shabbat, out of concern\nthat he will end up spreading it (SA 328:25).</p>\n<p><strong>However, to alleviate or prevent pain, the Sages allow one to place\nointment directly on a wound or bandage, though one who does so must\nbe careful to avoid spreading it</strong>. If the ointment was in a tube, he\nshould place the tube directly on the wound. If it is in a container,\none may apply the ointment using a tongue depressor or a spoon. The\nprimary concern is that it should not be spread. When the bandage is\nplaced on the wound, the cream will spread out along the sides.\nNevertheless, as long as one does not smooth the surface\nintentionally, this is not prohibited (SSK 33:14; above, section 5).</p>\n<p><strong>Similarly, if one is in pain, he may place medicated cream on his skin\nand rub it in until it is completely absorbed. This is because as long\nas one wants all the cream to be absorbed, it is not considered\nMemare’aĥ</strong>. However, if one wants part of the cream to remain on the\nsurface of the skin to make it smooth, applying the cream is\nprohibited by Torah law (Da’at Torah 328:26; R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach\ncited in SSK ch. 33 n. 64; based on MA 316:24 and MB ad loc. 49; see\nabove, 14:5, and Harĥavot).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2017/05/18/applying-aloe-vero-on-burn-on-shabbos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Question:\nIs it permissible to apply aloe vero on a burn on Shabbos?</p>\n<p>Answer: The halacha is that a person that has a minor ailment may not put medication on it. The reason is because he may come to chop up other herbs etc., which is meleches tochain. I am assuming that the burn is not so bad that the person is bedridden as a result. If he would be bedridden as a result, then he would be considered a choleh kol gufo, and he would be allowed to apply the aloe vera gel in a permitted way, but this doesn’t seem applicable to your case.</p>\n<p>Sources:\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.53b.6?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Shabbat.53b.6.3&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Shabbos 53b D:H Meshum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.328.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O:CH 328-1</a>, 20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The standard answer is that it's somehow part of God's plan, whether we understand it or not.  OK, what are possible good reasons why we were enslaved in Egypt for 210 years?  Here are 8 possible answers.</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong>, we were enslaved for our protection.  In the Land of Israel, Jacob's small clan was an easy target for its neighbors.  In Egypt, a superpower protected us, albeit to exploit us.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, slavery allowed us to build up our numbers in safety.  If 210 years equal ten generations, and if numbers double with each generation, assuming four children per couple, the original number would be multiplied a thousandfold:  2^10 is 1024.  To get to the 3 million people the Talmud speculates were at Sinai for the giving of the Torah, we have to assume six children per couple, which is not unreasonable for the time.</p>\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, slavery allowed us to build up our identity and community spirit.  We were all in the same boat and followed the same customs.  The Midrash says that the Jews deserved redemption from Egypt because they kept their distinct names, dress and language. [Lev. R. 32:5 has names and language; Minor Pesikta, Devarim on Ki Tavo 41a has clothing and food]</p>\n<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, slavery minimized contact with the outside world.  Such contact might have led to idolatry and other practices later forbidden by the Torah.</p>\n<p><strong>Fifth</strong>, slavery eliminated the possibility of intermarriage.  Egyptians wouldn't want to marry slaves, and Israelite women raped by Egyptians would raise their children as Israelites.</p>\n<p><strong>Sixth</strong>, slavery created a scenario that allowed God to show the Jews and the whole world Who was in charge, with miracles and wonders that make a big impression.  God did so when He freed the Jews.</p>\n<p><strong>Seventh</strong>, the gratitude we felt when we were liberated made it easier for us to accept the Torah.  Indeed, the first thing God said at Sinai was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt, the House of Bondage. [Ex. 20:2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A commentator said that the purpose of our suffering in Egypt was to break our attachment to this world, as suffering makes people more spiritually inclined.</p>\n<p><strong>Eighth</strong>, the slave mentality made it easier for us to accept the Torah.  Indeed, after being a slave for so many generations, the first instinctive response when given a command is to say “Yes, sir!”  However, once we accepted the Torah, the slave mentality became a burden, so God waited until the generation of the Exodus died out in the desert before letting us into the Promised Land.  In fact, the Maharal went so far as to say that Pessah is not the time of true freedom, but rather the time when we changed masters from Pharaoh to God.  However, it must be pointed out that the first “slavery” was for the benefit of the master, while the “second” was for our own benefit.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Ramban links the start of the 400 years referred to in Avraham's nevu'ah foretelling of Galus Mitzrayim to Yitzchaq's birth and thereby to when Sarah started oppressing Hagar.

This is something that will not happen in Egypt. Moses recalls this in his parting speech to the nation in Deut. 26,5</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(See <a href=\"https://musingsonthetorah.blogspot.com/2023/12/why-shibud-mitzrayim.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> where this thought is built upon [along the lines of @MauriceMizrahi] to potentially necessitate the enslavement as well.)</p>\n\n\n",

Later\nauthorities, however, disagree since people typically do eat and\nsometimes nap or sleep in their offices. <strong>As a result, today the\npractice is to put a mezuzah up in an office, but without a blessing.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2023/08/18/mezuzah-part-iii/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dinonline</a> brings the halachic reasoning</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (YD 286:11) rules that a store in the marketplace\ndoes not require a mezuzah. The Levush (YD 286:11) and Shach (ibid 21)\nexplain this is because a store is a temporary dwelling, and the Torah\nrequires a mezuzah only on permanent residences. The Shulchan Aruch\ncompares a store to a succah on Succos and a ship’s cabin in their\n(non)-mezuzah obligation.</p>\n<p>This halacha puzzles contemporary poskim since we are required to\naffix a mezuzah on storage room doorposts, and if comparing their\ndoorpost’s volume of traffic, stores rate much higher. Besides, a\nstore is also used to “store” merchandise both when open, and closed.\nWhy, therefore, should a store require a mezuzah less than a storage\nspace?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Taz maintains (YD 286:10) that a store is only used during the day and not at night, and in order for a space to be considered\ninhabited it has to be used for its designated purpose both day and\nnight. Although it also serves to store merchandise, the space is not\nintended for storage. Rather, its main purpose is commercial, and\nstorage is only a secondary use.</li>\n<li>The Yad Haketana (Mezuzah 2:21, quoted in Pischei Teshuva footnote 10) disagrees with the Taz’s explanation. In his opinion, the Shulchan\nAruch refers here to a storefront from which merchandise is removed\nevery night, or a stall in the marketplace that is used only on market\ndays. This is the kind of store for which a mezuza not required, but\nother stores do require a mezuzah. (This opinion is also mentioned in\nthe Ben Ish Chai [Rav Pe’alim II YD 36:3). [...]</li>\n<li>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe YD I, 178) rules that if a business is not active every day it is certainly exempted from\nmezuzah. Apparently, he follows the Taz’s opinion that exempts every\nstore and business from affixing a mezuzah despite serving as a\nstorage for merchandise or business tools. He does, nevertheless, take\nin account the Yad Haketana’s opinion, and therefore requires a\nmezuzah affixed on a business doorpost, albeit without a bracha.</li>\n<li>Rav Elyashiv, though (Shvus Yitzchak chapter 2:2) requires a  mezuzah affixed on a store with a bracha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Many poskim rule differently in this matter, depending upon various factors such as if there is a coffee room or not, and how a business\nis used.

These stearate ingredients may be derived from either animal or vegetable sources. However, under normal circumstances, enough lubrication will be provided with less than 1.6% stearates, making them batel b’shishim and permissible.

Middot Vshiurei Torah p. 232 (Rav Chaim Beinish) agrees that this is the minhag Yerushalayim to take challah with a bracha for 3.67 pounds. Shevet Halevi 11:253:3 holds that the minhag in Yerushalayim is to take challah with a bracha for 1.75kg (3.86lb) of flour. Rav Elyashiv (Haarot Pesachim 48b) also said the minhag Yerushalayim is like Rav Chaim Noeh for taking off challah with a bracha and to separate without a bracha for 1 kg. However, Steipler in Shiurin Shel Torah (5716, p. 86) writes that one should take off challah without a bracha for flour of a bit more than 1200 grams, like Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. A bracha is only recited if using more than 2.25 kg of flour, like Rav Henkin.</p>\n<h2>Sephardic custom</h2>\n<p>According to some Sephardim, one should take off Challah with a Bracha when making a dough with 3.44 pounds (1560 grams) or more of flour and it is a pious practice to remove Challah without a Bracha when making a dough with 2.65 pounds (1200 grams) or more of flour. <sub>13</sub></p>\n<p>However, some say that one should only remove Challah with a Bracha for flour that is 5.14 pounds (2332 grams) and without a Bracha for flour that is 3.67 pounds (1666 grams).<sub>14</sub></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sub>13</sub> Yalkut Yosef YD 324:6.

(Because of this prediction,) she did not let him wander bareheaded, saying \"cover your head, so the fear of heaven will be upon you, and ask for mercy (that you will not fall to the evil inclination). Rav Nachman didn't understand why his mother told him this. One day, Rav Nachman was learning under a palm tree, and his head covering fell off his head. He looked up and saw the tree, and his evil inclination attacked him (making him want to steal dates). He got up and (because of the strength of his desire) cut the dates with his teeth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From these Gemaras, we can see that a head covering is supposed to be a reminder of God's presence, as well as of his greatness (presumably because it being on one's head symbolises God's dominion over and control of us, showing that 'God is above our heads' in the hierarchy of power, or something along those lines).\nIt is interesting to note that this is the same reason given by Rashi for the obligation of judges and people visiting the sick to wear a head covering (source needed).</p>\n<p>We can also see that a head covering is a sign of respect for God (in the first gemara mentioned) and a head covering is needed to separate between God's presence and our own. (Not to say that we are separate from God and not under his control, of course. Rather that we are not holy enough to interact with Shechina (divine Presence) at all times.)</p>\n<p>There seems to be some discussion in the rishonim about whether this is a halachic obligation or a good mincha, but the shulchan aruch (Orach Chayim 2:6) says it's an obligation.</p>\n\n\n",

The thing is of no avail whatsoever, but, since he is in danger, he is permitted to do it, so he won't feel troubled.  Those who whisper upon a wound a charm, consisting of verses from the Torah, or who read such verses over a child to save it from fear, or who place beside an infant a Torah scroll or tefillin to make him sleep, are not only guilty of superstition, but are amongst those who deny the Torah.

Friedlander, because it's in the Public Domain and well, good enough):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the truth is undoubtedly as we have said, that every one of the six hundred and thirteen precepts serves to inculcate some truth, to remove some erroneous opinion, to establish proper relations in society, to diminish evil, to train in good manners or to warn against bad habits. All this depends on three things: opinions, morals, and social conduct. We do not count words, because precepts, whether positive or negative, if they relate to speech, belong to those precepts which regulate our social conduct, or to those which spread truth, or to those which teach morals. Thus these three principles suffice for assigning a reason for every one of the Divine commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So he doesn't just say that is is assur (prohibited) to believe in foolish things, but that issurim and chiyuvin (prohibitions and obligations) can <strong>all</strong> be explained as ways to get one away from foolishness and to Truth.</p>\n<p>(Although we will see later,in the last part of the last chapter, that the need to embrace the Truth is to act as Hashem appears to us as acting out of an awareness that one is following His Ways.)</p>\n\n\n",

Nationalism is built only on the ruins of the holy Torah, belief in G-d, His prophets, and the Talmudic Sages.

I can show them all the proofs of the incoherence of the topic of trinity and everything, but they absolutely refuse to abandon Christianity due to cultural reasons, personal reasons or whatever else and don't want to become a B'nei Noach fully (in the sense of recognizing the Talmud, etc.) or become a Jew. However, there are people like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_ibn_Adi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yahya ibn Adi</a> (893 - 974 CE) historically, or contemporary sects like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_unitarianism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biblical Unitarians</a> and the like, who embrace absolute monotheism, question the notion of bodily incarnation, etc. Now, in this scenario, would it be advisable to push them more towards the non-Trinitarian models which would get them closer to our position or just stop engaging?</p>\n<p>The reason why I'm asking this is because I know that leading others to other religions is considered sinful. However, leading someone towards a sect of the same religion which they're already practicing which is closer to the Noahide code might be permissible/advisable if not recommended, but I'm not sure so I wanted to get input here.</p>\n<p>So is this halachically allowed, and according to Jewish sources, is this a recommended course of action to reaching out to someone?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I'm not sure as to why this question was closed, but I'm adding this just to clarify: I am using the example of Christianity just for the hypothetical's sake because there would likely be more information about this case in the Jewish texts (but in theory, any other similar religion can be substituted), and I'm simply asking whether pushing someone from a less monotheistic sect within the same religion to a more monotheistic sect would be permitted and whether such a course of action is recommended according to different Rabbinical rulings or views.</p>\n<p>So I'm not sure how this is off-topic because the question is about halacha and Rabbinical views of the action and not about anything outside of Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

Their children were, of course, members of Avraham’s household who had been of service to Avraham and who had adopted his lifestyle. He gave them gifts consisting of silver and gold and livestock according to his own evaluation of who deserved how much. He most certainly gave even more valuable gifts to Ishmael and to the sons of Keturah even though the Torah does not specifically mentions this.

    "content": "# Learning principles of software development from the Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I suspect that like myself, a lot of other users on this site are software developers and are also on Stack Overflow, so hopefully this isn't considered too off topic/niche...</p>\n<p>When Hashem creates Adam, Adam is described as being <em>betzelem elokim</em> - in Hashem's image.  I think that different professions can relate to this in different ways.  A judge may relate to Hashem's aspect of justice and a social worker may relate to His aspect of mercy/kindness.  I feel that software developers relate to Hashem's aspect of creativity - we're probably the only job where we give a command and something is brought into existence just from the command itself.  We also probably relate to the aspect of justice as well as we focus a lot on rules, and perhaps if we want to ensure a system that does the job well for users, we need to focus on mercy/kindness.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I've been thinking about what we can learn from the Torah in terms of software development.  When Hashem created the universe, He did it in multiple steps, even though He could have just brought it into being fully formed.  We can learn the importance of building a system in small iterations from this.</p>\n<p>When Avraham's three visitors arrive, Rashi explains that these are <em>malachim</em> - angels - messengers of Hashem.  According to that opinion, I think this is probably one of the best times in the Torah that we get insight into the way that the universe is run day to day as the <em>malachim</em> are entities who have an essential role in the functioning of the universe.  Rashi explains that each messenger only has a single mission.  Hashem could easily have made <em>malachim</em> be capable of multiple functions, but each one has a distinct role.  I suggest that we can learn the Single Responsibility Principle from here.</p>\n<p>From the same incident, we might have thought that if a single <em>malach</em> was sent just to tell Avraham that he would have a son, the destruction of Sodom would require multiple <em>malachim</em> given the difference in scale of the 2 tasks, but only 1 <em>malach</em> seems to have been sent for that role.  Perhaps we can say that we can learn the KISS/DRY principles from here (that's probably a weaker argument).</p>\n<p>Finally getting to the actual question... what other principles of software development can we learn from the Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is a relevant book which I saw once on the topic: <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1735021709\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah && Tech: Discussions at the Intersection of Torah and Technology</a></p>\n<p>It is a selection of <em>divrei Torah</em> on the <em>parasha</em> with relevant applications to technology.</p>\n<p>The book's blurb says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Torah && Tech is a discussion at the intersection of one of the\nworld's oldest wisdom traditions and the modern technological world.</p>\n<p>How do we understand artificial intelligence?

    "content": "# Why don't we customarily say a Psalm before Birkot ha-Shachar?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems like there is a usual practice of saying a psalm or a fragment of a psalm before starting into a set of blessings. I have been taught that this is to mentally prepare yourself before the main prayer service starts. Some examples would be Ashrei before Minchah (and Selichot?), V'hu Rachum before Ma'ariv, and maybe Psalm 30 before Baruch She'amar or in an expanded view the whole of P'sukei d'Zimra before Shacharit.</p>\n<p>With this as background, it seems notable that before the morning blessings, therefore before the main public service the way we do things today in Ashkenazi custom, there is no psalm. People say Modeh Ani earlier and perhaps Ma Tovu and some Torah or Talmud verses after the early morning Torah blessing as personal preparation, but I don't remember seeing a psalm in this section in any siddurim.</p>\n<p>I don't know if this was ever a conscious choice on the part of any rabbis or if the practice just happened to evolve this way, but the difference is notable and perhaps someone has written on the topic. Does any one try to explain why there is customarily no psalm early in the morning?</p>\n\n\n",

I'm not sure that you will find a definitive answer on whether that will necessarily be a reward in this world (as opposed to the afterlife) or more specifically whether it will affect your business.  However, it would make sense that it should do so, because we know that God rewards people in-kind for the type of good deeds that they do, so if you are trying to improve your financial position, helping others financially makes sense if you are trying to be rewarded in that way.  You are also demonstrating that you are using the resources that God has given you in a positive way, which may also help you be rewarded with more.</p>\n<p>I don't think it necessarily needs to be a Jewish charity for it to work, but there may be extra reward for that.  There are other factors to bear in mind as well.  For Jewish people, there is a whole <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/109043/2642\">hierarchy</a> of these.  I'm not sure if they also affect non-Jews giving, but it makes sense that they should do so.  The way in which you give may also be a factor - giving in person generously in a way that makes the recipient feel good about themselves is considered to be ideal.  In fact, one of the best forms of charity is to help someone become more financially self-sufficient rather than needing to rely on charity.  This can take the form of things like an interest-free loan to help them start a business - in some situations it may be kinder to someone to lend them money than to give it to them as this is often better for their self-esteem.</p>\n<p>There may be other things that are worth considering as well.  Charity is not limited to money, but you can give your time as well - eg. volunteering or other acts of kindness that help people or improve the world in some way.  Praying is also something that is not limited to Jews - you can ask God for whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you are, and this is a good thing to get into the habit of doing, even if you are asking for something fairly trivial.  There are no special words that you need for this - just ask in your own language.</p>\n<p>With all of these things, your intent is likely to be an important factor.  There is nothing wrong with doing something for the reward, but it is even better if you have in mind that you want it to have the effect of making you a better person and bringing you closer to God.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Soul of an Animal\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A man has freewill and is judged according to his deeds, his own actions decide his position. This is simple to understand. So here comes my question: \"Animals too have souls but their level is so degraded compared to Man. They have no freewill and they do what Hashem decides them to do. So, how does Hashem decide that this soul should be in this specific animal? If they are no merits/demerits for animals why some are Kosher and some Non-Kosher? In Torah we see specific animals have a major role, to give a perfect example: the Donkey of Bilaam, and also there is a tradition that tells us Mashiach comes on Donkey, what was so special with these animals?\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You are asking 3 questions that come up when you consider that animals don't have free will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why does Hashem make this animal soul go into the body of this animal species?</li>\n<li>How can some animals be kosher, and some not?</li>\n<li>What is special about those animals with special roles, like Bilaam's Donkey?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is indeed a single answer to these questions. As the Zohar says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לָא בְרָא קוּדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא מִלְּתָא דְּלָאו אִיהוּ צָרִיךְ</p>\n<p>Hashem didn't make anything that He didn't need</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Rambam explains in Moreh Nevuchim 3:13, all of Hashem's decisions and everything He created, is exactly as He needs it. This animal soul is put in that animal body because Hashem made it to go into that body, to fulfil His Ratzon. Hashem's plan needs both Kosher and Non-Kosher animals, neither is redundant or better or worse. Both fulfil His desire! Hashem's plan required special animals, like Bilaam's Donkey. None of these animals \"merited\" anything (you are right, they don't have free will). They were brought into existence and designed to follow Hashem's blueprint, the Torah, and all of that is to fulfil His desire, and nothing else.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the board game \"Snakes and Ladders\" kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It appears to be a game based on the Hindu religion. Here is an excerpt from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders#History\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The game was popular in ancient India by the name Moksha Patam. It was\nalso associated with traditional Hindu philosophy contrasting karma\nand kama, or destiny and desire. It emphasized destiny, as opposed to\ngames such as pachisi, which focused on life as a mixture of skill\n(free will) and luck. The underlying ideals of the game inspired a\nversion introduced in Victorian England in 1892. The game has also\nbeen interpreted and used as a tool for teaching the effects of good\ndeeds versus bad. The board was covered with symbolic images used in\nancient India, the top featuring gods, angels, and majestic beings,\nwhile the rest of the board was covered with pictures of animals,\nflowers and people. The ladders represented virtues such as\ngenerosity, faith, and humility, while the snakes represented vices\nsuch as lust, anger, murder, and theft. The morality lesson of the\ngame was that a person can attain liberation (Moksha) through doing\ngood, whereas by doing evil one will be reborn as lower forms of life.\nThe number of ladders was less than the number of snakes as a reminder\nthat a path of good is much more difficult to tread than a path of\nsins. Presumably, reaching the last square (number 100) represented\nthe attainment of Moksha (spiritual liberation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, is it kosher to play this game according to Jewish law?</p>\n\n\n",

If yes what’s the meaning of Geulah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Shabbos 21a says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only difference between this world and the messianic era is subjugation of the exiles to other kingdoms, from which the Jewish people will be released.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Satmar Rebbe wanted very much to live in Eretz Yisrael, but he left because he wanted to give tzedakah and raise money, and he could not do that in the State. So, \"what defines exile\"?</p>\n<p>According to Chassidic thought, galus, e.g. exile, is defined as \"the absence of the presence of G-d\", as the verse in Devarim (31:18) says: \"I will hide My face\". See also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2321750/jewish/Introduction.htm#footnote1a2321750\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>.</p>\n<p>You ask if it is still exile if the majority of the Jewish people are living in the land of Israel. Well, the Satmar Rebbe, in his magnus opus \"Vayoel Moshe\" (Siman 14), explains to us <a href=\"https://www.truetorahjews.org/images/vayoelmosheenglish.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with a small portion of the Jewish people living in Eretz Yisroel. As long as the majority of the Jewish people is in the land of their enemies, bearing the decree of exile, Hashem's promise to protect the entire Jewish people from destruction - even those living in Eretz Yisroel - is in effect. The Ramban only means that there will be danger if the majority of the Jewish people ascend as a wall against the will of Hashem, who made the decree of exile. So it comes out the fact that most of the Jewish people lives in exile, in accordance with Hashem's decree, is what saves even the Jews of Eretz Yisroel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if the Jews are living in the land of Israel, is the exile over? There is a famous story of the Chazon Ish, Rabbi Avraham Yishaya Karelitz (1878-1953).</p>\n<p>Reb Tzvi Dov Abraham, rav of Kedushas Levi in Monsey was once sitting in a room with the Chazon Ish when suddenly a man came into the room. The man was full of joy and spoke with great enthousiasm about the State of Israel. \"We see with our own eyes that this is the beginning of the redemption) [e.g. that the Jews are now massively living in the Land of Israel]. To this, the Chazon Ish told \"Bring me a Gemara of Kesubos\", he did, and the Chazon Ish looked up Kesubos 111a. The Chazon Ish hold his finger upon <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.111a.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the words of the Gemara (the three oaths and their punishment for violation them)</a>, and told this person:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Es shteit az men vet azoy ton vet azoy kumen, men hot azoy geton un es iz azoy gekumen, un ir zogt az es iz aschalta degeulah!” (It says that if we do this, this will happen. They did it, and it happened. And you say it’s the beginning of the redemption!) (Mishkenos HaRo\"im, p. 1195)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rqM00.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rqM00.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.truetorahjews.org/images/chazonish.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ליקוט דברי החזון איש זצ\"ל p. 3</a></p>\n<p>So, is it still considered galus if we live in the State of Israel? Yes.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Shternbuch actually cited the same Gemara I cited at the beginning of this answer (Teshuvos VeHanhagos). He wrote, in the name of the Brisker Rav that, a) we have no Jewish king appointed to us [that rules according to halacha], b) there was no official, halachic kibbutz galiyot- e.g. gathering of the people, since Moshiach did not do that yet.</p>\n<p>So, even if we are living in the State of Israel, this does by no means mean that the exile is over.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UZmvV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/UZmvV.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

So would this be an issue of doing something on Shabbat which will have benefit throughout the week, even if one gets immediate benefit?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I see three major concerns with cleaning windows on Shabbat</p>\n<ul>\n<li>putting water on a rag or sponge will generally lead to <em><strong>Sechitah</strong></em> (squeezing) which is a Torah prohibition, we are therefore very careful not get close to it (see e.g., <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/51208/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</li>\n<li><em><strong>uvdin d'chol</strong></em>, there is a mitzva to preserve the atmosphere of Shabbat and avoid work commonly done during the week. Its criteria are not extremely clearly defined (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/95872/what-criteria-determine-what-is-or-isnt-uvdin-dechol\">here</a> on MY) but cleaning windows is not a common Shabbat activity and therefore very likely prohibited just for this (see <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/01-22-01/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a long list of prohibited activities due to *uvdin d'chol)</li>\n<li>preparing for the week (<em><strong>hachana</strong></em>), unless windows are so dirty than one cannot see, it looks at least to an outsider that one cleaning the windows is preparing for the week to come which is forbidden</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found an explicit source (Star-K) which <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/5880/notes-from-the-star-k-bais-medrash-govoha-halacha-chaburah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any melachah that is degrading when done on Shabbos is forbidden\n(e.g., garden work, washing windows, etc.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Participants can attend whichever sessions they like. One can choose to listen to an Orthodox speaker giving traditional interpretations or to a Liberal denying essential principles of Orthodox Judaism and justifying practices forbidden by Orthodox halakha. <strong>The implication is that every one of the perspectives presented is equally valid. But for Orthodoxy they are not and cannot be.</strong> Orthodoxy recognises a range of different but acceptable views, but it cannot accept views outside that range as legitimate. As the Chief Rabbi wrote the L’eyla in 1990 ‘Either the Torah is the unmediated word of God or it is not. Either halachah commands every Jew or it does not. Either God speaks to us through history or He does not.’</p>\n<p>To say that all views are equally valid is not just non-Orthodox, it is anti-Orthodox, it is a denial of Orthodoxy. Orthodoxy does not and cannot accept that it is one option among many. It is the single authentic Jewish view (or range of views). <strong>As the Chief Rabbi wrote in 1990: ‘Orthodoxy stakes its being on the existence of some truth that transcends the relativities of man’. By giving an equal platform for all opinions Limmud effectively endorses this anti-Orthodox position.</strong> Pluralism is based on the assumption that there is no absolute truth, Orthodoxy makes just that claim, and it claims that Orthodoxy alone possesses that truth. Again the Chief Rabbi: ‘pluralism proceeds on the explicit or hidden premise that Orthodoxy is false. It could not be otherwise, for if Orthodoxy is true, pluralism would be false.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The result creates an awkward dilemma...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We therefore find ourselves in a stalemate. <strong>If an Orthodox rabbi attends Limmud it appears as though he is diminishing authentic Judaism into just one of a range of\nlegitimate options, a position that Limmud implicitly asserts but which is a denial of Orthodoxy, and in Orthodox terms is a denial of Torah itself</strong>. On the other hand, there are two and a half thousand Jews who want to learn Torah, and if all Orthodox speakers followed the logic I have set out, there would be no one to teach them. They would be forced to attend sessions which deny Torah and mitzvot as Orthodoxy understands them.

As far as I've researched, no meforshim discuss this topic.</p>\n<p>Hashem commanded Noach to build the Teivah 3 stories high (Bereishis 6 16). Rashi (there, based on Sanhedrin 108b) explains that the top floor was for the humans, the middle floor for the animals, and the bottom for the waste.</p>\n<p>What my sister and I are struggling with is why do we need an entire floor to save the waste? Why not just dump it outside? The world was one big trash can!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Good question.</p>\n<p><strong>There are a few possibilities:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>On a simple level we can say as @Dov commented bringing the answer from the Radak Beresheit 6:16 which says that there was a trap door in which Noach would shove out the garbage.</li>\n<li>A practical answer that I saw written by רב אליעזר דוד פאל was that the floodwaters destroyed the face of the earth, and the vast amount of garbage was necessary so that Noach could fertilize his fields after leaving the teivah. In this way, he would be able to continue life after leaving the teivah by sowing and planting. Through the manure, they could return some of the vitality to the land that was lost due to the flood, and it would be able to grow what is sown in it. Now although the Ralbag in Bereshit 6:9 says that Noach brought seeds with him on the teivah to replant things afterward, it still helps to have more and it can be used for the right purposes instead of tossing it out for no usage.</li>\n<li>The third idea is more of a כלל that Hashem wants to teach us. The Zohar (3:53b) teaches us that the Torah is מלשון הרואה  (instructions), the Torah is an instruction manual for life. The Zohar (2:161a) says, הסתכל באורייתא וברא עלמא, Hashem looked in the Torah and created the world. Thus I think the message the Torah is trying to teach us here, is to have derech eretz and work on being good people. The Midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kohelet_Rabbah.7.13.1?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kohelet Rabah</a> (7:13) teaches us that Hashem created everything for us, and He wants us to pay attention and not corrupt and destroy the world (one way being to not throw garbage everywhere). Now although they could have just thrown it out the window, Hashem wants us to teach us and also get us into the habit of taking care of the environment and be good people. In our life even when it seems like the environment is going down the drain (with global warming, plastic being found in the ocean), we can  all help fix this, and at that same time help us work on our midot of being good people and preserving the beautiful world Hashem has given us (which is done out of הכרת הטוב).</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>The last message which I heard from רב יצחק פנגר, is that it's very easy and simple to just throw out garbage! But Hashem wants us to deal and cope with the garbage, sometimes there are times in life that feel like \"garbage\" but we need to deal with it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(These answers are just points that can potentially be fully developed)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Just a theory I heard was that it was done for convenience, that there were abundant holes between middle and bottom floors to be able to just drop the waste down. Obviously Noach was very busy on the teivah and so minimizing effort for waste disposal would have been ideal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If we go against <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40230&st=&pgnum=42&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak's answer</a> suggested by @Dov in the comments, we can suggest that some of the garbage was necessary as an environment for worms and creeping creatures, which provided the food for birds and reptiles. To prove it the gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.108b.19?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 108b</a> tells the story about feeding a chameleon in the ark:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says: Eliezer, servant of Abraham, said to Shem the Great, son of Noah: It is written: “After their kinds, they emerged from the ark,” indicating that the different types of animals were not intermingled while in the ark. Where were you and what did you do to care for them while they were in the ark? Shem said to him: We experienced great suffering in the ark caring for the animals. Where there was a creature that one typically feeds during the day, we fed it during the day, and where there was a creature that one typically feeds at night, we fed it at night. With regard to that chameleon, my father did not know what it eats. One day, my father was sitting and peeling a pomegranate. A worm fell from it and the chameleon ate it. From that point forward my father would knead bran with water, and when it became overrun with worms, the chameleon would eat it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is related to the notion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">biome</a> in biology.</p>\n\n\n",

Then you offer anyone from the enemy who wishes to flee to be able to flee, and let them - both of these are for the sake of being compassionate and humanitarian (see Sefer HaChinuch 527)*.</p>\n<p>We, who have learned Torah for 3000 years and have absorbed its unique lessons in the infinite value of human life, do indeed have a deep seated fear that we will end up killing someone innocent (see Tanchuma Lech Lecha 19), which should lead us to be a compassionate nation who tries to minimise the death of the enemy population in any way we can, <em>so long as those are not ways that will increase the risk or sacrifice to our own population in any way.</em> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/121196/is-there-a-jewish-way-of-war#comment460031_121196\">Some say</a> that we are bound by international law when it comes to wars in galus, so note that this is indeed something that would go above and beyond that.</p>\n<p>However, once all of the above is done and the enemy has not surrendered or fled, you go to war, and <strong>you do so in order to win, in a way that brings back peace, which is a decisive win that totally subjugates the enemy to put them off trying again</strong>. This is the only moral way to fight a defensive war, as anything less than this will lead to escalating violence and entire generations growing up knowing nothing but war, leading to far more destroyed lives and death than a single, decisive victory.</p>\n<p>The only thing that may be relevant is what to do with the enemy women and children.</p>\n<p>Note, this halacha about sparing the women and children (Rambam Melachim 6:4) is presented in the same halacha the one that says one should kill every adult male. <strong>Note how the halachot do not make a distinction between \"combatant\" and \"civilian\"</strong>. It makes 3 distinctions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Those who wish to flee.</li>\n<li>Men.</li>\n<li>Women and children.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is pretty clear from the context then, that the Rambam is not saying that one should sacrifice one's own in order to protect the enemy, even the women and children. One should keep the women and children alive <em>lechatchila</em>, when there is no reason (quick and lasting peace, or protecting one's own) to kill them. A defensive war by definition is there to defend one's own nation! (and therefore is not to do with viewing one's own side as inherently more valuable). An even more compelling reason to accept this (logical) argument is by looking at the <em>pasukim</em> in Devarim 20:13-14 which reveal that we are talking about a situation where ונתנה ה' אלקיך בידך, <em>Hashem gives them over to your hand</em>, i.e. we have already won and are dealing with the survivors.</p>\n<p><sup>Everyone knows this, not a single nation in the world will command their soldiers to lay down their arms and let them or their civilians get slaughtered by an enemy combatant because he is hiding behind children, nor would they expect the soldiers to retreat and allow the enemy escape to fight another day.</sup></p>\n<p>Torah never makes a distinction between soldier and civilian because doing so is evil: every human being is infinitely valuable, and we never make any human beings \"expendable\", which is what this false dichotomy of \"soldier\" and \"civilian\" implies - the soldiers are somehow fair game and expendable <em>ch'v</em>. It is nation against nation in a war, not army against army, and the law is one fights in order to win and bring peace, as has been said. The calculations of who to kill are centered around this principle, rather than comparing the value of human lives, therefore one does this in whatever way will be the quickest, and involve the least bloodshed to both sides, but with veto priority to one's own side.</p>\n<p>Who makes this calculation? The halacha is very clear: the military commanders, and not the political leaders (and kal vechomer not the civilians, no matter how opinionated and passionate). [source to follow bli neder, I must go get ready for Shabbat now]</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> The basic rule is this: the goal of the defensive war is to eliminate the threat to peace. Therefore the victory must be swift and decisive, and not a single person more <em>or less</em> than necessarily is allowed to be killed in order to achieve that goal. There's no distinction between combatants and non-combatants in terms of human value, so the only real consideration is what will bring the most effective <em>peace</em>, at the <em>minimial cost</em> to one's <em>own</em> side first, and the other side <em>second</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* This is debatable, according to Rav Shlomo Goren from his letters in 1982, the Ramban and the Sefer HaChinuch imply that a defensive war is similar in this regard to a \"permitted\" war, rather than an \"obligatory\" war.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Torah has very specific rules about <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">besieging an enemy city</a>- how to offer peace to the inhabitants, not to destroy the fruit trees around the city, etc.</p>\n<p>A city- not a military\nbase or a fort, but davka a <em>city</em>, which by its very nature contains civilians. The very fact that these halachot exist prove that it is permisible to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This probably depends on whether a war is considered מלחמת מצווה - a war that <em>must</em> be fought, or מלחמת רשות - a war that <em>may</em> be fought.\nA war fought to protect Am Yisrael is considered a מלחמת מצווה, as the Rambam says (Mishna Torah, Hilchos Melachim U'Milchamos 5:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואי זו היא מלחמת מצוה זו מלחמת שבעה עממין ומלחמת עמלק ועזרת ישראל מיד צר שבא עליהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And which is a war that must be fought? This is a war against the seven nations, a war against Amalek, and helping Yisrael against an oppressor who comes against them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even assuming the current war <em>is</em> a מלחמת מצווה, there are a few obligations that must be met. Later in the same set of halachos (6:1), the Rambam says that peace must be offered first, on condition that the nation accepts Israeli sovereignty (i.e. they will not hold positions of power, they will pay taxes, they will do the 7 mitzvot of Bnei Noach, and they will serve the king). Seeing as Israel has offered peace on better terms than that, and was refused, I'd say this condition has been met.</p>\n<p>However, even then the Rambam doesn't give the all clear. He says (6:4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והורגין כל הזכרים הגדולים... ואין הורגין אשה ולא קטן שנאמר \"והנשים והטף\"... במה דברים אמורים במלחמת הרשות שהוא עם שאר האומות. אבל שבעה עממין ועמלק שלא השלימו אין מניחים מהן נשמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And all the adult males are killed... But the women and children aren't killed, as it says \"the women and children\"... This is in the case of a war of choice which is with other nations. But in a war against the seven nations or Amalek who haven't made peace, no one is left alive</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam doesn't specify what to do in a case of מלחמת מצווה against other nations (when they attack), however, he seems to imply that only males may be killed [I didn't see any mefarshim on the Rambam who addressed this case specifically]. So it seems as though it would be prohibited to kill <em>any</em> women or children, but <em>all</em> men can (and should) be killed.</p>\n<p>The Rambam also says that when a city is being besieged, one side must be left open for people to escape. This is being done by the Israeli army, which has opened a humanitarian corridor for multiple hours a day in order to help Palestinians escape the fighting. (Though technically it should, according to the Rambam, be open at all times).</p>\n<p>So, there seem to be two halachic problems. Killing women and children, and not leaving an escape route at all times.</p>\n<p>Of course, today the situation is slightly different for two reasons: some of the women, and even some of the children are actively fighting; and without killing women and children, killing the men will be impossible or cost many Israeli soldiers' lives.</p>\n<p>I couldn't find any responsa in light of that, but seemingly the reason that we would generally kill all the men would be to neutralise any threat, presumably killing any women and children who are actively fighting can be killed. Killing non-combatants still seems to be a problem, though.</p>\n\n\n",

There is a dispute however as to what this means when inspecting the lungs of the animal to be sure they are free of lesions (this is specific to red meat, not chicken or fish).

    "content": "# Waking up too late for shacharit\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone wakes up too late for shacharit, does he still wash netilat yedayim and recite the morning blessings?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In regards to washing netilat yadayim, the Mishna Berura (Orach Chayim 4:1:1) says that there are two reasons given to wash netilat yadayim in the morning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש על זה שני טעמים. הרא\"ש כתב, לפי שידים של אדם עסקניות הן, ואי אפשר שלא יגע בבשר המטונף בלילה; לזה תיקנו חז\"ל ברכה על הנטילה לקריאת שמע ולתפילה. והרשב\"א כתב: לפי שבשחר אחר השינה אנו נעשים כבריה חדשה... צריכין אנו להודות לו יתברך... ועל דבר זה תיקנו בשחר כל אותן הברכות שאנו מברכין בכל בוקר; לכן גם דבר זה תיקנו בשחר, להתקדש בקדושתו וליטול ידינו מן הכלי, ככהן שמקדש ידיו מן הכיור קודם עבודתו. ולהלכה אנו תופסים כשני הטעמים לחומרא לעניין נטילה, וכדלקמן בזה הסימן. ואם לא בירך \"על נטילת ידים\" קודם התפילה, שוב לא יברך אחר התפילה לכולי עלמא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two reasons for this, the Ra\"sh says, since man's hands are 'busy', it is impossible to not touch the dirty skin at night [i.e. any skin that is generally covered, source needed]. For this reason Chaza\"l made the bracha of Netilat yadayim <strong>for Kriat shema and tfila</strong>. And the Rashb\"a wrote that because in the morning we are like new creations... We must thank HaShem... And for this purpose all of the morning blessings were written, and for this reason this was a takana for the morning, to become holy with HaShems holiness and wash his hands from a vessel, like a Kohen sanctifying his hands <strong>prior to his service</strong>. We hold by both opinions L'Halacha, as we see later [that we only make a bracha when both reasons are applicable - one has slept, and the night has passed]. <strong>But if he hasn't said the bracha of \"Al netilat yadayim\" before tfila, then everyone holds he no longer blesses after tfila</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, the reasons for <em>washing</em> are still applicable: if one was asleep, overnight, then everyone holds his hands need washing (in fact, the shulchan aruch says later on (4:3) that he shouldn't touch any orifices before washing). However, both the Ra\"sh and the Rashb\"a, as well as the mishna brura himself, seem to imply that the bracha is specifically said <em>before</em> tfila. So if one is no longer able to pray, then seemingly the blessing is no longer applicable, even though he should wash his hands.</p>\n<p>By the blessings on learning, the shulchan aruch says (47:2)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צריך לברך בין למקרא בין למשנה בין לגמרא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One must bless [before learning] Tanach, Mishna or Gemara</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which seemingly means that they must be said before learning for the first time each day, even if one won't be praying shacharit.</p>\n<p>\"Asher Yatzar\" is said any time one uses the bathroom.</p>\n<p>In regards to all other blessings, the Mishna Berura (Orach Chayim 52:1:10) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועיין בספר מאמר מרדכי ובספר נהר שלום דזמן כל הברכות הוא כל היום בדיעבד וכן כתב בספר מעשה רב להגר\"א ז\"ל והוסיף שם עוד יותר דאפילו בלילה עד שעת השינה הוא חיובן אם שכח לאומרן קודם ונ\"ל דאם חוטפתו שינה לכו\"ע לא יכול תו לברך ברכת המעביר שינה [דוגמת בהמ\"ז בסימן קפ\"ד ס\"ה עי\"ש] ומ\"מ לכתחלה צריך ליזהר שלא לאחר הברכות יותר מד' שעות על היום אך בדיעבד עכ\"פ יכול לברך אותם עד חצות כי כן מוכח מהרבה אחרונים שלא הפסיד הברכות אחר ד' שעות והמקיל לסמוך בדיעבד על הגדולים הנ\"ל ולברך אותם אחר חצות אין למחות בידו</p>\n<p>And see the Seforim 'Maamar Mordechai and Nahar Shalom, that <strong>all the blessings can be said the entire day, <em>bedieved</em></strong>, the Gr\"a said the same in his Sefer, Maaseh Rav, and added that they can even be said at night before sleep if he forgot to say them. And I think that if sleep takes him [meaning, if he fell asleep for a little bit, but didn't 'go to sleep'], then he can no longer say the blessing of \"the one who passes the sleep from my eyes\" (like we see by bircat hamazon 184:5 in Orach Chayim). Even so, <strong><em>lechatchila</em>, one should be careful to not say the blessings past four hours into the day</strong> [which is the same as when one should pray shacharis, lechatchila], however, <strong><em>bedieved</em>, he can say the blessings until midday</strong> as many Achronim say that he hasn't missed the blessings after four hours. And if one relies on the previously mentioned Achronim to make the blessings bedieved after midday, we do not tell him to stop.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, in short, the blessings <em>should</em> be made up to four hours into the day, bedieved they <em>can</em> be made until midday, and if one makes the blessings after midday we don't tell him to stop (implying that one shouldn't make the blessings then, but if he does there are Poskim to rely on).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rabbi Dovid Tzvi Hoffmann: The tree of knowledge of good and evil and morality\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rabbi Dovid Tzvi Hoffmann in his commentary to Bereishis 2:7 explains (thanks to <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/SP/R.%20David%20Zvi%20Hoffmann/Bereshit/2.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AlHaTorah</a> for making this available) that originally, it was the will of Hashem that man was going to learn knowledge of good and evil from Hashem directly. He was going to teach Adam and Chava that by Himself, as a tutor, says Rabbi Hoffmann.</p>\n<p>However, G-d foresaw that humankind wouldn't obey G-d in every single detail, and thus gave them free will. He also says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] Therefore He created the tree of knowledge, that eating from it would bring to man at least a partial knowledge of good and evil, so that he would not endanger the entire creation like this predatory animal. In the creation of man, two ways were therefore placed before him, <strong>one</strong> - that he allows himself to be guided by the will of G-d and fulfills the commandments of his Creator, <strong>and the other</strong> - that he allows himself to be guided by his own will or by desires that are contrary to the will of G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Hoffmann goes on to say that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For these two roads, the two trees in the garden were also planted - the tree of life for the first case, and the tree of knowledge - for the second case [...] But in the event that man is tempted - by his own will or by other forces - to do against his will, for this case the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was created, so that there would at least be some knowledge of good and evil even for a person who turned from G-d, knowledge that would come to him in another, natural way , and for him to do the will of his creator at least indirectly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What got my interest were the following words: <em>\"for this case the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was created, so that there would at least be some knowledge of good and evil even for a person who turned from G-d, knowledge that would come to him in another, natural way , and for him to do the will of his creator at least indirectly\"</em> - this somewhat means that if the human chose for getting knowledge by means of the tree of knowledge, instead of learning it directly from it's Creator, they would still learn some morallity, albeit indirectly from G-d.</p>\n<p>Original words, partly, from Rabbi Hoffmann:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התשובה נמצאת בפרשתנו. בתחילה נברא האדם בלי דעת טוב ורע. אפילו הבושה להתהלך ערום, שהיתה סגולתם של כל בני קדם הידועים לנו, אף אותה לא ידעוה אדם וחוה. רצון הבורא היה, שהאדם יקבל ידיעה נכונה ושלמה על כל הטוב וכל הרע על ידי הוראה מאתו ית' בלבד, כי רק בדרך זו תובטח נכונות הידיעה ושלמותה. אך עם זאת ניתן לו לאדם חופש הבחירה לציית לצווי האלהי או לאו.\nברם, משום שה' ידע מראש כי לא תמיד יציית האדם לציוויו, משום כך ברא הוא ית' את עץ הדעת, שהאכילה ממנו תביא לאדם לפחות ידיעה חלקית של טוב ורע, כדי שלא יסכן את הבריאה כולה כמו חיה טורפת זו. בבריאתו של האדם הושמו איפוא לפניו שתי דרכים, האחת — שהוא מניח להנהיגו על ידי רצת האלהי ויקיים מצוות בוראו, והשניה — שהוא מניח להנהיג עצמו על ידי רצונו הוא או על ידי רצונות המנוגדים לרצונו של ה'.\nבשביל שתי דרכים אלה גם נטעו שני העצים שבתוך הגן — עץ החיים למקרה הראשון, ועץ הדעת — למקרה השני. אילו היה האדם מסכים להיות מונהג כולו על ידי רצון הבורא, אילו היה — על אף חופש הבחירה שלו — הולך בדרך שהראהו בוראו, מבלי לסטות ממנה, כמו כוכבי לכת אלה שאינם סוטים ממסלולם, כך שיהיה למוד דעת טוב ורע מפי הגבורה ומודרך על ידי בחירתו החופשית, נצב כיצור יחיד העושה את רצון בוראו מתוך רצונו החופשי, או אז היה עץ החיים מזונו, מזון שהיה מעניק חיי נצח גם לחומר שבו, לגופו. אבל למקרה שהאדם יתפתה — על ידי רצונו שלו או על ידי כוחות אחרים — לעשות נגד רצון קונו, למקרה זה נברא עץ הדעת טוב ורע, כדי שתהא לפחות ידיעת־מה של טוב ורע גם לאדם שפנה מאת האלהים, ידיעה שתגיע אליו בדרך אחרת, טבעית, ולמען יעשה את רצון בוראו לפחות בעקיפין</p>\n<p>The answer is found in our parasha: In the beginning, man was created without knowledge of good and evil.\nEven the sense of shame in walking naked - known to have been a trait of\nall the ancient peoples known to us - was unknown to Adam and Eve. It\nwas the Creator's will that man would acquire correct and complete\nknowledge of all good and evil solely through instruction from Him,\nblessed be He, for only in this way would the accuracy and\ncompleteness of that knowledge be ensured. Nevertheless, man was\ngranted free will to choose whether or not to obey the Divine command.</p>\n<p>However, since God knew in advance that man would not always obey His\ncommand, He therefore created the Tree of Knowledge, from which eating\nwould at least impart to man partial knowledge of good and evil, so\nthat he would not endanger all of creation like a wild predatory\nbeast. Thus, in the creation of man, two paths were set before him:\none—that he would allow himself to be guided by the divine will and\nfulfill the commandments of his Creator; the other—that he would\nchoose to be guided by his own will or by desires contrary to the will\nof God.</p>\n<p>For these two paths, the two trees were planted in the garden: the\nTree of Life for the first case, and the Tree of Knowledge for the\nsecond. Had man agreed to be entirely guided by the will of the\nCreator; had he, despite his free will, followed the path shown to him\nby his Creator without deviating from it, like those celestial bodies\nthat do not stray from their course, he would have acquired knowledge\nof good and evil directly from Hashem, guided by his own free\nwill, and would have stood as a unique being who fulfills his\nCreator's will out of his own free choice. In that case, the Tree of\nLife would have been his sustenance - a sustenance that would have\ngranted eternal life even to his physical body.</p>\n<p>But in the event that man would be tempted - by his own will or by other\nforces - to act against the will of his Maker, in that case, the\nTree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was created, so that at least some\nknowledge of good and evil would reach him, even in the case where he turned away\nfrom God. This knowledge would come to him through another, natural\npath, in order that he might at least fulfill the will of his Creator\nindirectly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When G-d said to Adam and Chava \"Who told you that you were naked?\" (Bereishis 3:11), <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Sforno_on_Genesis.3.11.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי הגיד לך, who revealed to you the difference between good and evil?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this comment, G-d was not amused that they got this knowledge at all, even <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.25?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.2.25.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">some meforshim</a> say this wisdom refers to the yetzer hara (evil inclination). It seems logical that G-d did not wanted the humans to have the evil inclination, but I find it hard to understand why the tree of knowledge of evil and good was forbidden for that particular reason. Even with the comments of Rabbi Hoffmann in mind, who said that the tree was to make sure that, if we deviate from Hashem's path (G-d forbid), we would still have some morallity in us.</p>\n<p>So, what exactly was wrong with this tree and why did G-d forbid us to discern knowledge of good and evil?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think Rabbi Hoffman answers the closing questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Firstly, He created free will for the sake of <em>both paths</em></strong> (not sure if I misunderstood you). This solves the problem.</p>\n<h3>Path 1</h3>\n<p><strong>What Hashem wanted</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רצון הבורא היה, שהאדם יקבל ידיעה נכונה ושלמה על כל הטוב וכל הרע על ידי\nהוראה מאתו ית' בלבד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And says that this will produce this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אילו היה האדם מסכים להיות מונהג כולו על ידי רצון הבורא, אילו היה — על\nאף חופש הבחירה שלו — הולך בדרך שהראהו בוראו, מבלי לסטות ממנה, כמו\nכוכבי לכת אלה שאינם סוטים ממסלולם, כך שיהיה למוד דעת טוב ורע מפי\nהגבורה ומודרך על ידי בחירתו החופשית, נצב כיצור יחיד העושה את רצון\nבוראו מתוך רצונו החופשי, או אז היה עץ החיים מזונו, מזון שהיה מעניק חיי\nנצח גם לחומר שבו, לגופו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He equates this path with the <strong>Tree of Life</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Path 2</h3>\n<p>Hashem foresaw that Adam <strong>wouldn't do what Hashem wanted</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה' ידע מראש כי לא תמיד יציית האדם לציוויו, משום כך ברא הוא ית' את עץ\nהדעת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So for that He created the <strong>Tree of Knowledge</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: So therefore, the reason why it is <strong>forbidden</strong> to eat the <strong>Tree of Knowledge</strong> is because that's associated with going down the path that Hashem didn't want, <strong>Path 2</strong> and is an overall ban on taking away Hashem's Will of teaching us Good and Evil Himself. <strong>Going against His Will in general</strong>. It's a very unified concept, thanks for enlightening us with it. I hope Hashem will let us go back to learning Torah just from Him very soon!</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p>As for your question about Yetzer Hara, I don't see it really come up in this text (I haven't read all of it, apologies) so I find it hard to know what Rav Hoffman would say about it in this context. However, indirectly, he brings up your example about nakedness, and says that it was a wonderful trait that we were always going to learn. We see that the tree of knowledge gave us the ability to know about that nakedness just by instinct, not having been taught it. I'm not sure it's the Yetzer Hara that causes us to feel ashamed that we are naked, although I am asking about that myself in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/134628/is-it-to-our-credit-or-our-discredit-if-we-feel-ashamed-and-in-awe-of-the-grea\">this question</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

So how can Chazal tell us this one one hand, but on the other hand the Talmud is littered with stories about sexuality, sometimes even illicit relations committed by rabbis? These stories about taboo topics would clearly spark anyone to begin to fantasize about said topics. Plus, Aggada aside, even any halachic discussions that have to do with let’s say niddahs or all random cases involving women and sexual acts- these would obviously speak the imagination and desire of any Ben Torah.</p>\n<p>In short, how can a main part of Judaism be straying away from inappropriate thoughts and desires if a big corpus of our law+stories in the Talmud are centered around sexuality and illicit relationships and whatnot?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Eating reduces spritual sensitivity and Yitzchak Avinu wanting a meal before giving his berachot - contradiction?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a principle in mussar that overeating desensitises/spoils our mood for learning and davening with kavana (see Hachsharat HaAvrechim ch.9 for example). E.g. if one is very into one's learning, enjoying it, desiring it and concentrating well, but then has an indulgent meal, he/she will often find that the mood is gone and he/she can't find the passion or even the interest to learn anymore.</p>\n<p>This makes me wonder why Yitzchak asked for a meal before giving the <em>berachot</em> to Esav (etc). I understand that the general explanation for that (e.g. Rabbeinu Bachaye) is that he was looking to be in a pleasant, joyful mood, and was using his favourite food as a trigger/anchor for that.</p>\n<p>So I wonder if there is any <em>kashe</em> here? Was Yitzchak not afraid that the succulent meal would have a negative effect and, while perhaps making him happy, would also suck away his spiritual mood and negatively impact the <em>beracha</em>? If not, why not? What's different?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Two points:</p>\n<p>Firstly, on a basic level...what makes you assume that just because he asked for a tasty meal he would end up overeating? Surely someone of Yitzchak's righteousness was in control of his physical desires especially if they impacted negatively on his spiritual endeavours?</p>\n<p>Secondly, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Genesis.27.4.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> who explains that this meal was designed purely to provide a greater merit for Esav who was otherwise undeserving of any brochos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועשה לי מטעמים. רצה במטעמים כדי שיתעסק בכבוד אב ובזה תחול עליו הברכה כי גם שלא הכיר בגודל רשעו של עשו מכל מקום לא חשב אותו לראוי שתחול עליו אותה הברכה שהיה בלבו לברכו ולכן כשברך יעקב אחר כך שידע בו שהוא ראוי לברכה לא שאל מטעמים ולא בקש דבר וברכו תכף באמרו ואל שדי יברך אותך:</p>\n<p>Made it into a tasty dish. Yitzchok knew that Eisov was not worthy of the blessing that he wished to confer upon him. For this reason, he instructed him to perform an act of honor towards him to give him merit. By contrast when he blessed Yaakov (28:3) he knew that he needed no additional merit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Refer also to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.4?ven=The_Five_Books_of_Moses,_by_Everett_Fox._New_York,_Schocken_Books,_1995&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.27.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Reggio_on_Torah%2C_Genesis.27.4.1?lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reggio</a> for a similar approach.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, in line with the view of Rabbeinu Bachya that notes how it was designed to put him into a more pleasant mood, refer to Radak who notes how the type of food was selected in order to help an ageing man's more unsatisfied diet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועשה לי מטעמים, לא היה שואל הציד לחסרון שהיה לו ממאכל, כי עשיר גדול היה ומקנה רב היה לו, <strong>אלא שהזקנים נפשם קצה בהם ומתאוים המאכלים ומבקשים דבר חדש מוטעם במאכלם</strong>, ובשר הציד הוא מאכל חדש שאינו מזדמן תמיד כבשר הצאן והבקר והעופות הגדלים בבית, לפיכך שאל יצחק מעשו בנו להביא ציד וייטב לבו בו ויברכנו, כי ידע כי צריך הוא לברכתו כי לא היה איש הגון וטוב, אבל יעקב לא היה צריך לברכה, כי ידע יצחק כי ברכת אברהם לו תהיה וברית קיום הזרע המיוחד לאברהם, ובניו ירשו את הארץ; ואברהם גם כן לא ברך את יצחק:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ועשה, he did not ask for venison because there was shortage of food in his home, for he was exceedingly wealthy. <strong>We observe that aged people progressively get tired of the food they are used to, and they crave something new to give them an incentive to eat and enjoy their food.</strong> Venison is a different kind of meat, not comparable in taste to the meat of sheep or goats or beef. Therefore Yitzchok asked Esau to bring him something which would put him in a pleasant frame of mind, the kind of good feeling which is a necessary prelude to bestowing a blessing with one’s entire heart. He was well aware that he needed something to put him into the right frame of mind as Esau’s general conduct was not one that commended itself to his father so that he would gladly volunteer such a blessing as he felt he was obligated to dispense. There would be no need to send Yaakov on such an errand prior to blessing him, as his righteousness made blessing him something natural.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One point is it is the overeating is what causes this spiritual insensitivity rather than eating. The point being that when you over indulge. Another point is in the kavana behind the eating as well regardless of the amount. The Apter Rav was known as a great tzadik yet he also ate enormous amounts of food everyday. This wasn't about indulging for the personal pleasure of eating and was part of his avoda. (What exactly the nature of his avoda was is not something I can explain.)</p>\n\n\n",

[Gen. 25:6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another explanation is: all that he had received as gifts because of Sarah — and other gifts that people had given him — all these he gave to them because he did not wish to derive any benefit from these.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He gives no source.  Who are these gift-givers and why didn't Abraham want to derive benefit from these gifts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One angle that the mefarshim explain explicitly, is that these \"gifts\" were not gifts in the literal sense but relating to the names of G-d or pagan deities. In other words, they came from Avraham's wider understanding of the world and the various areas of knowledge he had accrued over time.</p>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daat_Zkenim_on_Genesis.25.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Zekeinim</a> notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נתן אברהם מתנות, “Avraham had already given gifts.” According to the Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin folio 91, <strong>these “gifts” were the ability to utter the names of the holy name of the Lord without thereby incurring severe harm.</strong> Even nowadays, according to our author, the Moslems who are trained in theology are able to do this without coming to any harm thereby. It was difficult for Rabbi Moses to understand how Avraham a great and devout man could possibly have taught the holy Name of the Lord to wicked people. <strong>In view of this problem, Rabbi Yaakov, son of Rabbi Nachman, interpreted that line in the Talmud differently by saying that the word טומאה used in the Talmud there refers to the names of certain demons.</strong> The names of these demons are associated with the evil spirits making their homes in certain ruins, or certain cemeteries as described by the Talmud in tractate Chagigah folio 3. This is alluded to by the fact that the spelling of the word “matanot” is spelled as if it were a singular, the letter ו having been omitted. As spelled in the Torah here, the numerical value of the letters in the words נתן אברהם מתנת equals the numerical value of למדם להשביע השדים. [I have not quite figured this out. At any rate, the idea is that Avraham taught these sons of his how, when they used the names of deities when swearing an oath, they could do it in such a way as not to be guilty of violating the third of the Ten Commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we go with the second p'shat it would answer your question as to why Avraham didn't want to derive benefit from such gifts as they are based on impure / evil foundations.</p>\n<p>Refer also to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.25.6.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> for a similar approach.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/HaKtav_VeHaKabalah%2C_Genesis.25.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaKesav Vehakabbalah</a> explains why Avraham acted as he did:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הודיע להם שמות אלה כדי ליתן אל לבם לדעת להשתמר מהם ולא יבואו להחליף שם טומאה בטהרה ולעבדם בלתי ידיעה</p>\n<p>He informed them of these names in order to let their hearts know to guard against them and they would not come to replace impurity with purity and serve them without knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we build on this approach, we can answer why Rashi gives no source. They were not gifts in the literal sense (although there are some commentaries that suggest they were indeed of monetary value - e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Genesis.25.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a>) and thus Avraham only had knowledge to pass on. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siftei_Chakhamim%2C_Genesis.25.6.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifsei Chachomim</a> makes the logical deduction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שם טומאה מסר להם. והא כבר נתן ליצחק כל ממונו:</p>\n<p>He transmitted to them impure names. [Rashi knows this] because Avraham had already given all his possessions to Yitzchok.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As such, logically, it did not have to state where they came from, as they were of a tangible/material nature as it was just forwarding knowledge.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I thougt they were the gifts given to Avraham for the marraige of Sarah. Like when pharoh and avimelech kidnapped her. He didn't want to benefit from them because he didn't receive them 100% kosher. By pharoh he got some because they wanted to marry sarah. Taima dikra said he was allowed to keep them because of taos accum.\nAlso they might not have been given wholeheartedly,  just to appease Sarah.\nWe find Amoraim didn't wish to benefit from things that weren't 100% kosher eventhough it was permissible to benefit from them by the letter of the law.</p>\n\n\n",

However, they are also subtly definable in their own right.</p>\n<h2><strong>Gilgul - Reincarnation</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27ar_HaGilgulim.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaar HaGilgulim</a> begins by outlining that there 5 different types/level of soul - Nefesh, Ruach, Neshama, Chaya and Yechida (each one regarded as a higher level of consciousness etc.). As a person grows and develops, he gains a different one of these souls. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27ar_HaGilgulim.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">second chapter</a> explains that when a human is first created his Nefesh enters his body. Providing that person acts correctly, the Ruach will enter at the end of their 13th year when they have become more \"complete\". The Neshama only follows suit upon the individual turning 20. These three initial souls are a required part of the person. If that person fails to rectify themselves in each instance, they won't receive the next soul up. If a person fails to rectify his Nefesh and goes on to die, then his Nefesh will have to reincarnate until it is suitably \"fixed\". The Shaar HaGilgulim goes on to explain all the different levels and what will happen if not rectified and the resulting ramifications. Either way, the notion of Gilgulim is to reincarnate a part of one of the souls in order to rectify it.</p>\n<p>So in the context of this question, to say Mordechai was a gilgul of Moshe would mean a past of soul that once inhabited Moshe.</p>\n<h2><strong>Nitzos - Spark</strong></h2>\n<p>This is a concept that was developed off the Arizal and furthered in Chassidish circles. It represents a spark of the Divine that every human being is made up of which links to their soul and influences their actions. To say someone has a spark of another person that lived means that they share the same G-dly spark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27ar_HaGilgulim.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> it brings the following which will serve as a good introduction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In line with the kabbalistic tradition, R. Israel Ba'al Shem Tov (the Besht), the founder of Hasidism, perceived everything to be infused with Divine sparks: \"It is a great principle that there are holy sparks in all there is in the world. Nothing is void of sparks, even trees and stones.\" (As related in Besht, Zava'at ha-Rivash, photocopy (Brooklyn: Otsar Hahasidim, 1991), section 141, p. 54 (Hebrew). Many of the sayings in this book are probably not attributable to the Besht but to R. Dov Ber, the Maggid of Mezeritch, his main disciple.) He further taught that such sparks are also in \"all of man's actions. Even in man's sins there are sparks resulting from the breaking of the vessels.\" This panentheistic worldview, which sees elements of the Divine in everything, should not be confused with the panthe-istic doctrine that G-d and nature are identical.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/gilgul\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for its context within reincarnation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Safed, especially in the Lurianic Kabbalah, the idea of niẓoẓot ha-neshamot (\"sparks of the souls\") was highly developed. Each \"main\" soul is built in the spiritual structure of \"mystical limbs\" (parallel to the limbs of the body), from which many sparks spread, each of which can serve as a soul or as life in a human body. The gilgulim of all the sparks together are aimed at the restitution of the hidden spiritual structure of the \"root\" of the principal soul; it is possible for one man to possess several different sparks belonging to one \"root.\" All the roots of the souls were in fact contained in Adam's soul, but they fell and were scattered with the first sin; the souls must be reassembled in the course of their gilgulim which they and their sparks undergo and through which they are afforded the opportunity to restitute their true and original structure. The later Kabbalah developed much further the idea of the affinity of those souls which belong to a common root.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As is clear, this segues/overlaps into the next one...</p>\n<h2><strong>Shoresh - Root</strong></h2>\n<p>As already explained <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/138096/what-does-shoresh-neshama-mean\">here</a> there is a concept known as \"Shoresh Haneshama\" - lit. the root of the soul. This is not reincarnation as we know it, rather it represents the combination of a person's nefesh, ruach and neshama and the resulting spiritual core of each individual.</p>\n<p>@RabbiKai explains it nicely <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/138097/22152\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each combination is a potential soul root, which will impact the personality, mission and various other aspects of the person. All of the roots devolve from the proto-soul of Adam HaRishon. Every person will come from a particular root in his soul. Some people can be from the same or very similar roots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, in the context of Moshe/Mordechai the choice of the word \"shoresh\" would mean that Mordechai was not necessarily a reincarnation, but rather they stemmed from the same root.</p>\n<h2><strong>Sod - Secret</strong></h2>\n<p>In the context of this topic - sod is best understood as the notion of \"Sod HaIbbur\" - literally \"the secret of the embryonic state\". Whilst the Gemara uses this term in relation to the \"Secret of the Intercalation\" (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.20b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 20b</a>) it also has its place within our discussion and is spoken about in Shaar HaGilgulim in several places.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Aseret_HaDibrot%2C_Pesachim%2C_Matzah_Ashirah.1.22?vhe=Shenei_Luchot_HaBrit,_based_on_Amsterdam,_1698_ed._Part_II&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelah HaKodosh (Aseres Hadibros, Pesachim, Matzah Ashira 1)</a> also mentions this concept in relation to souls:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וסוד העיבור שהזכירו רז\"ל תמיד בדבריהם, רצו לומר סוד עיבור הנשמות. ושם אדנ\"י מקור ישראל, כדכתיב (תהלים סח, כז) במקהלות ברכו אלהים אדני ממקור ישראל...</p>\n<p>And the \"Sod HaIbbur\" that our Rabbis of blessed memories mentioned always in their words, they want to say the secret of the embryonic stage of the souls. And there is Hashem, the source of Israel, like it writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.68.27?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 68:27</a> \"In assemblies bless G-d, the LORD, O you who are from the fountain of Israel\"...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unlike Gilgulim which are reincarnated souls that have already lived before, Sod HaIbbur happens when a righteous soul occupies a living person's body for a time / spiritually \"impregnates\" the existing soul. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Pinchas.12.71?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9B%D6%BC%D6%B7%D7%93&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Pinchas 12</a> famously notes that when Nadav and Avihu died following their unauthorised fire before Hashem, their souls joined with Pinchas following his killing of Zimri. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mikdash_Melekh_on_Zohar.3.217a.1?vhe=Zholkva,_1864&lang=bi&with=Zohar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mikdash Melech</a> on the Zohar there explains it as being a direct example of Sod HaIbbur.</p>\n<p>So according to the Megaleh Amukos choice of words, he would understand it that Mordechai was alive with his own soul, that was joined with that of Moshe's soul.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a Coursera for learning Halacha and Gemara?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am a Baal Tshuva and I never had a proper Jewish education. I have come a long way but I am still unable to learn independently (directly from early text). I've been considering some online courses but they all require the ability to learn from sources as a prerequisite (I got a sample pre-shiur pdf with 20 pages of sources ranging from the Talmud to Rishonim to Acharonim, Shulchan Aruch, Ran, Rif, Mishna Brura, Rashi, GRA, Feinstein, you name it).</p>\n<p>I wouldn't be able to keep up with these kinds of courses because the load would just pile up every week and the learning curve for me would be very steep.</p>\n<p>I've searched all over the internet for softer introductions to learning and haven't found much.</p>\n<p>I'm obviously aware of resources like Sefaria but it's only about as helpful as a dictionary is in learning a language.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I've been there so I know exactly how you feel. I can share some learnings from experience and a number of resources that helped me a lot to become much more independent.</p>\n<p>First, since halacha and gemara don't start anywhere, and assume you know everything else, it is important to cover once, even superficially, all topics so you have a broad understanding. You can do this through the Mishna with a good commentary (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/MEL.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Schottenstein Edition of the Mishna</a>, see what I wrote <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/90718/the-new-artscroll-mishnayos-product-recommendation/90722#90722\">here</a>). This can be done in English but if you can cover some of the mishnayot in Hebrew this will help with vocabulary. For halacha, use e.g., <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Categories/KIT.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</a> as a base text, or if not too heavy for you <a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/rambam-mishneh-torah-sethardcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishne Torah</a>. All are written in clear Hebrew.</p>\n<p>Then at some point, you need to break the barrier of learning the Hebrew and Aramaic. This is hard but despite the breadth of resources in English, there is no way to get into the world of halacha without it. I think the easiest is to first learn by heart all the keywords the gemara uses. Three good resources for this are the following small brochures with lists of the most frequently used terminology</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R Aryeh Carmell's <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0873064283\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aiding Talmud Study</a></li>\n<li>R Yitzhak Frank's <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1592644546\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Card</a></li>\n<li>R Dovid Kaplan's <a href=\"https://judaicaplaza.com/products/tp-ohrg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Ohr Somayach Gemara companion</a> (the easiest to use but might be harder to find)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then it would be best if you learned halachic texts with someone fluent in the language so he can teach you. The best is to write down all the words you don't know, learn them and repeat. Two ways to keep this interesting are to either pick a sugya in gemara and take it down all the way to practical halacha through <em>rishonim</em> and <em>acharonim</em>, or alternatively to study halachic <em>teshuvot</em> (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135887/11501\">this answer</a> for ideas of halachic teshuvot to start with).</p>\n<p>If you learn more visually, you might want to experiment with flashcards, e.g., through an app like <a href=\"https://quizlet.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Quizlet</a>, which has lots of existing flashcards with Hebrew and Aramaic vocabulary (search for <em>gemara</em>). If you don't already have a learning partner, or want to find more, you could go to an organization such as <a href=\"https://www.partnersintorah.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Partners in Torah</a> which will match you with someone.</p>\n<p>There is one book (500$ on amazon as of today or free <a href=\"https://touroscholar.touro.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=lcas_books\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) that takes one chapter of Baba Metzia and walks you through it methodically, giving you all the vocabulary you need to go through it piece by piece, with questions to check your understanding all along. Very well done.</p>\n<p>It is very important to realize this is a multi-year endeavor and not to get frustrated. It is by far the hardest thing I have learned in my life but highly rewarding once you get cracking.</p>\n<p>Finally, reference works I found extremely helpful are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R Yitzhak Frank's <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0873065883\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Practical Talmud Dictionary</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0692072527\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmudo Beyado</a> which is a dictionary organized by page of gemara which lists all more complicated/new words on this page. It also has an excellent appendix of many talmudic concepts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PS. There are more helpful books on how to learn gemara as a beginner or baal tshuva; some of them extremely helpful. You can ask a separate question if you wish to hear more but here's <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/99413/11501\">a start</a>.</p>\n<p>PPS. I just see now you are based in Tel Aviv, so forget what I said about Hebrew, I still leave it for the benefit of others who might not be fluent yet.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Try <a href=\"https://webyeshiva.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">webyeshiva</a>.

If there is no Levite present, then a kohen reads in his place. [An objection was raised.] Is that so? Has not Rabbi Yoḥanan said that one kohen should not read after another kohen, because this might cast suspicion on the [legitimacy of the] first kohen? ...\n[Abaye said:] What I meant to say was that the same kohen [should read in place of the Levite].\n[Gittin 59b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for leaving to avoid being called for an aliyah, it is a mitzvah to hear the Torah being read.  So much so that the only musical instrument allowed (other than the Torah-mandated shofar) is the rimonim (bells) on top of the scroll, because their jingle during the processional announces a mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

The place of my mother's conversion was Conservative I would say and it took my mother 2 years to convert and then she went to the Mikvah. They would go to Shul most weekends, keep kosher, and light candles for Shabbat. A few years after I was born my parents got divorced and my mother quickly became non-observant and my dad slowly became less observant to the point of Reform. I grew up eating pork and not following any Jewish law. I had my bar mitzvah at the age of 14 and did read from both torah and haftorah. I remained non-observant after until the age of 15 when I went to a Reform Shul and had questions that couldn’t be answered so I went to a Conservative Shul. I went almost every Saturday for about a year and didn’t feel exactly connected yet became more and more observant. Then I went to an Orthodox Shul and felt like home and now am fully Shomar Shabbos, wrap tefillen, wash before bread etc… this addition of religion comes with added knowledge and I don’t know if my mother's conversion is accepted by Orthodox and thus if I should convert. Really weighing down on me. Am I Jewish?</p>\n\n\n",

Bachya ibn Paquda states <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart%2C_Fourth_Treatise_on_Trust%2C_Introduction.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Chovos Halevavos, Shaar Habitachon, Pesicha)</a>:</p>\n<p>ואם יבטח על חכמתו ותחבולותיו וכח גופו והשתדלותו <strong>ייגע לריק ויחלש כחו ותקצר תחבולתו מהשיג חפצו</strong></p>\n<p>Taken literally, this implies that a person will never achieve success if he places trust in his own efforts.</p>\n<p>Yet, isn't it commonplace for people to trust in their own efforts and still, at least occasionally, achieve success?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi on the gemara in sanhedrin on page <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Sanhedrin.26b.9.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">26b</a> explains that if one relies on one's own ability to accomplish something and doesn't recognize G.ods role in every action one performs, even in regards to Torah, G.od will make you fail.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מפר מחשבות ערומים - נותן להם מזונות ומבטל מחשבות מלבם שלא היו מניחין אותן לעשות תושיה ל\"א מחשבה שאדם מחשב כך וכך אעשה כך וכך תעלה בידי מועלת להשבית הדבר שאין מחשבתו מתקיימת אפילו לדבר תורה כגון האומר עד יום פלוני אסיים כך וכך מסכתות בגירסא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding your question of exceptions to this statement — G.od works in mysterious ways. It could be something along the lines of how G.od doesn't punish the wicked right away in order to allow time for repentance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To understand this point, you have to get to the root of what motivates us to do the things we do in life. Generally speaking, the flow of motivation in a <em>neshama</em> starts with desire, which activates the intellect, which activates the <em>middot</em>, which produce an action. <strong>So, everything starts with desire.</strong></p>\n<p>Desires come in different ranks. We have secondary desires, and primary desires. For example, the desire for money is not a primary desire. We don't <em>actually</em> want money (especially nowadays when it's just a piece of ugly paper or a number in an online bank account); it is a <em>secondary</em> desire: we want it <em>for the sake of something else</em> - comfort, safety, resources etc. This can lead to more secondary desires, until we get to primary desires. <strong>A primary desire is a חפץ</strong>.</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with having a חפץ, as we generally do have noble desires, such as a desire to find someone else, to have a purposeful life, and to live a long productive life. <strong>Shaar Habitachon's purpose here is to help guide us in how we should approach the fulfilment of these noble desires.</strong> There's the intended way, and the wrong way.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart%2C_Fourth_Treatise_on_Trust.2.1?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pat Lechem</a> indeed brings this point: we pursue our goals (secondary desires) in order to achieve our חפץ, our deep desire. <strong>He is basically explaining that the overall message of <em>bitachon</em> is that you should trust that your desire will be met and fulfilled by Hashem and following His ways alone</strong> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart%2C_Fourth_Treatise_on_Trust.2.1?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 2</a> and the 7 traits of trustworthiness).</p>\n<p>If one is distrustful, and pursues achieving one's desire out of distrust that Hashem will take care of it for him, thinking that Hashem's ways will not get him what he wants, and therefore <strong>puts his trust <em>in these pursuits instead</em></strong>, he will find that he never fulfills his desire in the end, <strong>guaranteed</strong>. As the passage continues:  <em>his strength will weaken, and his tactics will fall short of accomplishing his desire</em>.</p>\n<h4>Examples:</h4>\n<p><strong>Money</strong>: This is one Rabbenu Bachaye himself brings further on (the example of the alchemist for e.g.). Our (holy) desire for money is rooted in our desire to be able to live a stable life that is tranquil, safe and that our needs should be met, so we can pursue our purpose in being created. If we don't trust that Hashem will take care of that for us, and we have to make sure of it ourselves by pursuing a career, under stress and anxiety, <em>it means we are putting our trust in ourselves, and our own enterprise</em>. We will end up working too hard, pursuing work that is not conducive to a tranquil and holy life, and having a life in constant anxiety that something will go wrong. In the end, even if we do achieve material comfort, we will not be able to actually enjoy it, and thus our actual חפץ will go unfulfilled. Only if we put our trust in Hashem, as the Rebbi explains, will we find those things.</p>\n<p><strong>Intimacy</strong>: People are born with a healthy desire for closeness and intimacy with someone else, which comes from when Hashem created the condition of it not being good to be alone, and it is a reunion between two halves of a soul (can't get more primary than that!). He commands us to channel this desire into marriage, and follow the laws such as controlling our eyes and heart, being <em>shomer negia</em>, refining one's character to make one a good spouse etc. Some people feel that if they follow Hashem's guidance in achieving the fulfilment of this desire, they will lose out, so they indulge in various degrees of promiscuity in their distrust. In the end, this path leads to tragic failure. They never achieve the true fulfilment of this holy impulse in their promiscuity, and the promiscuity itself damages and numbs them in many many ways, precluding them from fulfilling this desire even in the intended way.</p>\n\n\n",

But for theory's sake ... I will point out that Rabbi Moshe Feinstein zt\"l was not a big fan of Nusach Sefard, and basically gave license for any Ashkenazi to switch over to \"Nusach Ashkenaz.\" I think it's pretty simple that if someone who <em>knew</em> their family was Hassidic is allowed to switch over to Nusach Ashkenaz should they so choose, then certainly someone who's not certain what they were can do so! He writes in Igros Moshe OC2:24:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the matter of your father being from a family of Hassidim who pray\nwith the text that they call Nusach Sfard, however as your father\nlives in a place where they pray Nusach Ashkenaz, and you learned in\nyour youth to pray Ashkenaz ... and your father didn’t want to confuse\nyou ... and now that you’ve grown, you are unsure whether you are\nobligated to go back to praying with Nusach Sfard, as your father\ndoes; or are you obligated to continue praying with Nusach Ashkenaz as\nhas become your habit.    It is known that all the people of Poland,\nHungary, and Russia -- other than some distant places like the\nCaucuses ... are Ashkenazi Jews, even the Hassidim. Until the\nprinciple of Hassidism spread, they all prayed N. Ashkenaz, however\nlater the Hassidic leaders began to instruct to pray with a different\ntext, with some changes. Therefore it is not a “change in custom” that\nyou began praying N.A., even though your father plus 2,3 generations\nbegan praying with the new text -- contrarywise! They changed the\ncustom of their ancestors, and that of our mighty rabbis the sages of\nFrance and Germany. No clear reason is known how they allowed to\nchange the fixed text ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regardless\n-- we don’t contest those who changed, as they certainly had a reason that authorized it. But if one wants to go back and pray N.A., which\nis the text of our ancestors and teachers, he is certainly allowed, as\nhe is returning to his original status.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is basically what Rabbi Feinstein's father himself did -- the Feinsteins had been Koidanov Chasidim (not too far from Minsk), but a shidduch was proposed with a significant, non-Hassidic family. The agreement was that young Dovid would go study at the Volozhin yeshiva -- the \"mother lode\" of non-Hassidism -- and switch everything over. This stuff happened. A lot.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Correct pronunciation of the word הרהורים in the Hamapil bracha\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have seen two different ways to pronounce the word הרהורים in the Hamapil bracha said before sleep.</p>\n<p>One have the vowels like this: וְאַל יְבַהֲלוּנִי רַעְיוֹנַי וַחֲלוֹמוֹת רָעִים <strong>וְהִרְהוּרִים</strong> רָעִים\ni.e. ve'hirhurim</p>\n<p>The other way is like this: וְאַל יְבַהֲלוּנִי רַעֲיוֹנַי וַחֲלוֹמוֹת רָעִים <strong>וְהַרְהוֹרִים</strong> רָעִים i.e. ve'harhorim</p>\n<p>My question is- which is the correct pronunciation (nikud) and why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The word הרהור (and its plural) are the verbal noun of the verb הרהר, meaning to think, or to ponder. הרהר is in the verb form פיעל, meaning it has two syllables - a chirik under the first (root) letter, and a segol under the second to last (root) letter. (In short, הרהר is pronounced hirher).</p>\n<p>Verbal nouns of this verb form keep the chirik sound, and replace the segol with a  וּ. So הרהר=hirher, becomes הרהור=hirhur.</p>\n<p>An example of this in tanach (since the word itself doesn't appear) is the word כפר (kiper-atoned) (see Vayikra 16:18) which becomes כיפור (kippur-atonement) (for example Vayikra 23:27).</p>\n<p>Therefore it should be pronounced hirhurim.</p>\n<p>['Harhur' would not be the verbal noun of any verbal form, there are too many to write here but you can find them all here, among other places: https://milimilim.co.il/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%94]</p>\n<p>Another sign that it's pronounced 'hirhur' is the many places where mepharshim write the word as הירהור (which must be pronounced hirhur). For example, yerushalmi sh'vuos (1:6)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>העולה מכפרת על הירהור הלב\nthe Olah [Korban] atones for thoughts of the heart</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As well as a couple more talmudic sources, Jastrow, and many rishonim and Achronim. (The Smag, shulchan aruch, Targum yerushalmi, sfat emet, machzor vitry, another yerushalmi, and others, just from a quick search of sefaria).</p>\n<p>After a look through the Cambridge Cairo Geniza manuscripts available online, I also managed to find one which used the spelling הירהורים:\n<a href=\"https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-TS-NS-00121-00045/2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-TS-NS-00121-00045/2</a></p>\n<p>Another manuscript I saw spelled it הִרהוּרִים: <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/resource/amedscd.2018757847/?sp=10&st=image&r=0.242,-0.161,0.731,1.099,0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.loc.gov/resource/amedscd.2018757847/?sp=10&st=image&r=0.242,-0.161,0.731,1.099,0</a>\n(There were a few that spelled it הרהורים, but since they are not vowelized, it still makes it impossible to tell how they meant for it to be pronounced).</p>\n<p>And even though in Daniel (4:2) it says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהַרְהֹרִין֙ עַֽל־מִשְׁכְּבִ֔י</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to be a rare case, in addition to it being in aramaic. Almost all of the other sources that I saw were either spelled with a yud or vowelized with a chirik (at least by sefaria).</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, both pronunciations seem to have at least some sources that support them. However, the manuscripts which use the hirhurim pronunciation , as well as the general rule of פיעל verbal nouns, in addition to the list of rishonim and Achronim who spell it הירהור in other places, makes והרהורים as 'v'hirhurim' more likely.</p>\n\n\n",

Sure, we could say that reward and punishment are just natural consequences of ones' actions, but they aren't. It would be like saying that a criminal going to jail is a natural consequence of his actions, when in fact it's an intentional and measured response by the justice system. Now here on earth it happens to be that it's important to send people to jail even without the concept of free will, simply as a deterrent. But G-d doesn't need deterrents to stop people from doing bad things. Clearly, this is why the Rambam writes that the existence of reward and punishment proves free will; there is no point in punishing people for doing things they had no choice in, when G-d can simply remove their ability to do bad things!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Judgment can be used synonymously as consequence of the actions, however judgment is concerned with justice due to free choices, not for accidents and deterministic consequences. The ancient people believed more about the consequence of our actions in this life, hence, the ancient Wisdom literature is full of similar teachings as the Indian Karma theory of consequence/justice received in this life itself. The righteous does not suffer and enjoys prosperity and multitude of descendants. The concept of deeper wisdom of the eternal afterlife developed later. Determinism or the denial of freewill is a depressing philosophy of either the unbelieving naturalist or a naive legalistic believer who follow the ancient Gnostic fatalism such as Manichaeism, as believed by Augustin of Hippo, Muhammad, John Calvin.</p>\n<p>Sleepwalking crimes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatism_(law)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">automatism</a> are not punished by the law.</p>\n<p>Quoting from Dr Craig of <a href=\"https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/calvinism-and-the-unliveability-of-determinism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reasonablefaith</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A determinist cannot live consistently as though everything he thinks and does is causally determined—especially his choice to believe that determinism is true! Thinking that you’re determined to believe that everything you believe is determined produces a kind of vertigo. Nobody can live as though all that he thinks and does is determined by causes outside himself. Even determinists recognize that we have to act “as if” we had free will and so weigh our options and decide on what course of action to take, even though at the end of the day we are determined to take the choices we do. Determinism is thus an unliveable view.</p>\n<p>This presents a real problem not just for the Calvinist, but for the naturalist. For insofar as naturalism implies that all our thoughts and actions are determined by natural causes outside ourselves, free will is an illusion. But we cannot escape this illusion and so must go on making choices as though we had free will, even though we don’t. Naturalism is thus an unliveable worldview.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is codified by Rambam (<a href=\"https://rambam.alhatorah.org/Full/Avadim/9.4#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avadim 9:4</a>) and Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"https://shulchanarukh.alhatorah.org/Full/Yoreh_Deah/267.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 267:18</a>).</p>\n<p>The exact terms of this conquest is subject to a large debate in the commentaries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some Rishonim say that <em>kibbush milchamah</em> works through the regular\nmechanism of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeiush\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">yeiush</a></em> [unique only that <em>yiush</em> usually doesn't\nwork on land, and is only effective in war situations (Ramban, Gittin\n38)].</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Other Rishonim understand this as a mechanism specific to war, in\nwhich conquests of war legitimately belong to the the victors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A third opinion considers this an extension of <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Abiding_by_Civilian_Law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>dina dmalchusa dina</em></a>\n(see Radvaz 3:533, Shulchan Aruch Harav, Hefker KA #3}), or alternatively, the source for <em>dina dmalchusa dina</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An important caveat to this is: Some authorities (see, for example, Dvar Avraham 11:9, explaining the view of Rashba and Ra'avad) consider the conquest valid only as long as the victors remain in the land. At any point when they relinquish their control, the land automatically returns to the original owners.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This above is a very general approach to a largely technical sugya that is beyond the scope of this answer to do real justice. For further halachic analysis, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Duber_Kahana_Shapiro\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dvar Avraham</a> (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=695&pgnum=81\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">V1, Siman 11</a>).

This is Likutei Moharan II:66-67 iirc plus numerous places in Likutei Halakhot. R' Nathan reminds us like R' Nachman said however, only the student, only the Joshua can fight for his master's name, a prisoner can't free himself.</p>\n<p>As long as ancient Yisrael honored Moshe Rabbeinu they did right in their conquests and were successful and if not not.</p>\n<p>The people of Rashbi were under too much Roman brutality to do anything. But wasn't Rashbi a superb general?🤔</p>\n<p>The Arizal's people were too busy with his dank Torah to care about colonizing.</p>\n<p>The Besht colonized the east, and Rabbi Nachman had his followers and one time made a secret trip into a city where Jews were not allowed to stay overnight. He stayed there, no one knows how, and then Jews were allowed after that, so he \"colonized\" it. Plus his big trip to Zaslov, Brod and Lemberg, Rabbi Nathan in Chayey Moharan says no one knows the purpose or what he accomplished on that trip, but I'd say there was definitely some kind of colonization to his name and purposes.  Many of his Sefarim were printed in Lemberg or is it Lviv.</p>\n<p>Saba colonized Eretz Yisrael look every where you go you see his name on every rock, house, head and automobile. His followers colonized it.</p>\n<p>Edit:\nאֲשֶׁר קָרְךָ בַּדֶּרֶךְ, וַיְזַנֵּב בְּךָ כָּל-הַנֶּחֱשָׁלִים אַחֲרֶיךָ--וְאַתָּה, עָיֵף וְיָגֵעַ; וְלֹא יָרֵא, אֱלֹהִים.</p>\n<p>Deut. 25:18 How he cooled thee by the way and made you mediocre, by character assassinating the head, Moshe, and raising the hindmost of thee to positions of authority and false pride, all those weak meagre wannabees in thy rear, making you faint and weary; having no fear of God whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Source: Rashi there and Sifrei Breslev</p>\n\n\n",

Between two points, light takes the path it can cross in the least time.  Soap bubbles form so as to minimize surface area. When an object is subjected to various forces and follows an odd path as a result, that path is the one that minimizes a function called the “action”. Nature gradually makes changes in the make-up of living things to maximize their chances for survival in their environment.  In addition, conservation laws tell us that no matter what changes a system undertakes, some things remain invariant: mass-energy, linear and angular momentum, electric charge, other properties of elementary particles, etc.</p>\n<p>So why not assume nature optimizes absolutely everything, including matters where human beings are involved?  This is where the word “optimism” comes from.  It is the belief that everything that happens is somehow for the best.  In the Talmud, Rabbi Nachum ish Gamzu always said “Gam zu l'tovah -- This, too, is for the good”.  [Taanit 21a] His student Rabbi Akiva preached the same: \"כׇּל דְּעָבֵיד רַחֲמָנָא לְטָב עָבֵיד -- Everything God does is for the good.\" [Berakhot 60b]</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore if one can reach the minyan in 18 minutes, there would still be an obligation to pray with that minyan. Others learn that it is referring to actual distance (See Shevet HaLevi 8:19).</p>\n<p>The amount that one has to travel is the amount of time it takes to travel 4 milin — which is 72 minutes of travel time in front of him [in the direction one is traveling in], and 18 minutes (1 mil) to the sides or back [of the direction of travel]. This is calculated by time; and not dependent on the mode of travel.</p>\n<p>Sources:\nSee Biur Halachah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.163.1.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">163:2</a>; Mishnah Berurah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.92.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">92:17</a>; Az Nidberu <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=880&st=&pgnum=107\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:66</a>; Ishei Yisrael, chap. 8, footnote 70.</p>\n<p>Mishnah Berurah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.90.52\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">90:52</a> explains that if one is sitting at home is considered as one who has to travel backwards. He also warns against those who are at home and are lazy to go pray the noon and evening prayers.</p>\n<p>Even though many learn that the 18 minutes time is measured from one's current location; the Kaf HaChaim <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kaf_HaChayim_on_Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.90.107.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">90:107</a> considers it like the tekhoum shabbat i.e. the time (distance) of 18 minutes only starts from outside the city.</p>\n<p>My own addendum: I'm assuming the time one has to travel was only placed due to travel being difficult historically; nowadays, being that it's easier to travel,  one should probably make an effort to go even further than 18 minutes out of the way.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm pretty sure that was the standard practice at the time Rabbi Feinstein wrote his responsum.

Do any sources talk about this dichotomy, of how we believe we’ll be punished yet we still sin?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Answer number 2, with a few more points.</p>\n<p>One of the main things that got us up in the morning for thousands of years is the peril of life. If we didn't get up early and milk the cows, collect the eggs, draw the water, and work on the crops for 12 hours, we were in grave danger of death. This attitude of \"you have to do it otherwise you will die\" was real, and convincing, and that motivation was something that we had available in our religious life as well.</p>\n<p>In today's day and age a lot of people are far less convinced. Get up early or I will die? I won't die, I'll just miss the school bus, who cares? A day off never killed anyone and some abstract \"you won't be able to pay your future mortgage if you continue to fail school and then you'll end up on the street and you might die!\" argument makes no impression at all.</p>\n<p>People being told that they \"have to not sin!\" doesn't make sense anymore. They tried it, it felt great and nothing bad happened, and being told it is abstractly bad for them in terms of nonspecific blessing or some future life doesn't make any psychological impact. Good, because it is not true.</p>\n<p>In fact, being told that we have all these spiritual needs is the source of depression. Chassidus teaches us that the big mistake of some modern psychology is that it burdens us with more needs. Our mother never loved us and we hate our brother and we need to this and we have to that, and pile that on top of our religious needs and we can't breathe. Chassidus teaches us \"hey, Hashem created the world, not you, despite what everyone is telling you. You didn't ask to be born because you didn't need to be born. Someone else needed you to be born\".</p>\n<p>Being told we must, we have to, we need to is making us mentally unwell and it is simply not true. Being needy is terrible for people, it's so closely associated with self centeredness and doesn't do well except when our situation is so dire that it gets us out of bed so we won't die. Above all, it is not true. We don't need anything.</p>\n<p>The noble human soul knows the truth. It is on a mission and it is not needy, it is needed. Many people are taught the opposite: \"you think Hashem needs you or your mitzvot? That's heresy! Of course He doesn't, it's for you. Don't you want Olam Haba? And blessings?\" so they say, you know what, I've thought about it, and I don't really need it either. I tried it, didn't like it, and I don't really care.</p>\n<p>The truth is that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/108779/does-god-need-us/136415?r=SearchResults&s=1%7C98.1630#136415\">Hashem does need us</a>, and He is real and wasn't created. This means that Him needing us to do the mitzvot is a real need. If people were told this, they would be excited to get up in the morning to <em>serve</em> Him, finding every moment of life a precious treasure of an opportunity to do something for Him. If Hashem needs me to not sin, then I can do it. I can let go of it for Him, if not for me, because it's true, He needs me to stop, and I don't need to sin.</p>\n<p>We find a parallel in this in terms of other people too. We don't see how other people need us to stop sinning. We don't see or feel the consequences we have on others. A typical teenager is not thinking about his future wife and kids. He doesn't see how every sin he does is damaging his self control, his character, his strength, and squandering valuable preparation time, all of which his future wife and kids desperately need from him. Once he marries her and has kids, it is often too late. He has lost his empathy, his ability to love vulnerably, has gained a temper and bad habits, and can't teach them any Torah or good character because he didn't learn it himself.</p>\n<p>If people knew in their youth how much they will one day be needed, and felt that pang of loving, noble, vulnerable responsibility in their heart as a dose of reality, they wouldn't sin. However, if they are not taught this, but are taught that sinning is bad for them, and their selfish neediness is appealed to, it won't make much of a dent, if any, on their psychology.</p>\n<p>Being told that no, they are needed, by Hashem who made them, by their parents who made them, by their siblings and friends, by the whole world, all of whom are waiting desperately for them to stop sinning, it can't be ignored. The face of Yaacov appeared to Yosef when he was about to sin, and he couldn't do it. He couldn't let down his father. He couldn't abandon his mission. If a person thinks that nobody needs him to not sin, then nobody's face will come to them when they do it, and they will be stuck in the dark and the sin will be guiltless for them and become even something they are deeply fond of, and why not? It might be their only escape from the depression of all the \"needs\" they are \"burdened\" with by their religion, their parents and their psychologist...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Apart from the obvious answer which is that they don't believe it is true, the comments have brought some good answers that show that this is a multi-faceted issue as the world of \"sin\" is very complex. I'd like to take what Ethan Leonard said and expand a little and connect it to <em>tzimtzum</em>.</p>\n<p>I remember very well the impressionable story Rabbi Akiva Tatz brings in one of his books about how he had a patient who had a certain disease that meant when he smoked, his capillaries would get damaged, and prolonged smoking was forcing him to have his limbs amputated. He recalls wondering what that man was thinking, before lighting that cigarette and enjoying those 60 seconds of mild pleasure, and weighing that against the possibility of being able to hold and play with his children, as he saw the man being wheeled in to have his final limb removed.</p>\n<p>What is going on? The man <em>clearly</em> has the desire to quit. Even people who are not in such grave danger generally <em>want</em> to quit. They know it stinks, it is a crux, expensive, and doesn't really even feel that good. They see the warnings on every packet with the graphic pictures of how they are destined to die.</p>\n<p>The answer is that they are convinced that smoking will kill them, but they aren't convinced that <em>this</em> cigarette will kill them. A very similar thing happens with positive mitzvot, and is a general lesson we learn from <em>tzimtzum</em>: too much desire, raw desire that hasn't been put into a vessel, destroys the very project that it is desirous of.</p>\n<p>A person is very inspired to learn. He just heard a great shiur that got him really motivated to learn and he runs to the <em>beit midrash</em>, but then finds he is paralysed. Why? Because he opens a gemara, and starts to learn and it's too slow! Why <em>davka</em> this <em>daf</em>? It kills it. A person is meant to be <em>metzamtzem</em> his ratzon; constrict his desire; put it to the background leaving behind nothing but an impression of the original desire, and fill the space with a concentrated, refined desire that is specific and targetted to what needs to be done in the moment. Once the project is finished, the desire comes back in full force to <em>enjoy</em> the fruits of the labour.</p>\n<p>So one of the biggest reasons we sin is that even if we are convinced we will damage ourselves, and hurt people, and be punished, we don't believe that <em>this</em> sin will bring all that. This sin we can get away with. Our desire to be better people and stop sinning and hurting people is so strong, and raw, and unfocussed that it doesn't leave room in our heart to be able to concentrate on small minor details. <strong>The small minor details don't satisfy our desire to change and be heroes, so we continue to do small sins and it doesn't go against our psychological desire to be better people</strong> - <strong>we don't see how this one cigarette makes us a bad person.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBumqen42jI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is a wonderful shiur</a> that explains this concept from first principles for the first 30-45 minutes, then spends the next 45-60 minutes giving practical examples.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, Hagar returned to her \"pressured\" life (i.e., profoundly meaningful, rather than misguided freedom to \"do what I feel like\") in order to give Yishmael the opportunity to grow in a loving, uplifting, and disciplined environment to curb his inclination from being a פֶּרֶא אָדָם\nto one who could (and would) eventually do teshuva at the end of his life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Ramban explains that Hagar would've never become free from her mistress.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>RETURN TO YOUR MISTRESS, AND SUBMIT YOURSELF TO HER. [The angel] commanded her to return and accept the dominion of her mistress. A hint that [Hagar] would never become freed from her, because the children of Sarah would rule over her descendants forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Refer also to the Sforno, for a similair approach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והתעני, the additional comment after telling Hagar to return to her mistress, was an allusion to the future; it would be Hagar's destiny, as well as that of her offspring to submit to the authority of the Jewish people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the Tur in Tur HaAroch.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שובי אל גברתך והתענו תחת ידיה, “go back to your mistress and submit to her oppression” The angel hinted to her that she would not regain her status as a free woman, and that the descendants of Sarai would rule over her descendants into the distant future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the Midrash of Philo where it goes a little bit deeper into the concept of obeying a mistress in this case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why did the angel say to her, \"Return to thy mistress and be humbled beneath her hands?\" (Genesis 16:8).\nAs the letter is plain, we must rather investigate its inner meaning. The word of God corrects that soul which is able to be lured, and instructs it, and converts it, leading it to wisdom as its mistress, that it may not, through being abandoned by its mistress, rush at once into absurd folly. But it warns it, not only to return to virtue, but also to be humbled beneath its hands, that is to say, beneath its several excellencies. But there are two kinds of humiliation; one, in accordance with defect, which arises from spiritual infirmity, which it is easy to overcome, seize upon, and reprove. But there is another kind which the word of the Lord enjoins, proceeding from reverence and modesty; such as that humility which children exhibit to their fathers, pupils to their masters, and young men to the aged; since it is very advantageous to be obedient, and to be subject to those who are better than one's self; for he who has learnt to be under authority is in a moment imbued with a power which he alone may exercise; for, although any one were to be clothed with the authority of all the earth and sea, yet he would not be able to possess the royal supremacy of virtue, unless he had first been instructed and taught to obey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Chaim Volozhin also didn’t say it, for this exact reason (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31446&st=&pgnum=14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orchot Chaim: Keter Rosh 93</a>, see also <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58364&st=&pgnum=50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefet Ma’aseh Rav</a> as the view of the Vilna Ga’on; see also Iggerot Moshe 5:43:6).</p>\n<p>This prayer originated in the 17th century, in a work called Tikunei Shabbat. R’ Chaim Liberman in Kiryat Sefer 38 401-414 \"Sefer Tikkunei Shabbat\" attributes this to an unknown student of the Arizal, so it is clear it was composed by the Arizal’s circle.</p>\n<p>The truth is that this prayer appeared along side another prayer, which you may have in your bentcher at home – Ribon Kol HaOlamin. By now, these prayers seem totally separate, but the truth is, they were never meant to be recited separately! If one realises that they work as one prayer, the issue goes away.</p>\n<p>The Ribon Kol HaOlamin prayer references two aggadot in Gemara Shabbat (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.119b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">119b</a>): one in the name of Rav Chisda who explains that the two angels who accompany someone bless them if they daven and say Vayechulu on Friday night “and your sin will be remove, and your error will be forgiven” (Yeshayahu 6:7). Another is in the name of Rebbi Yosi Ben Yehuda that two angels come home with you on Friday night, one good and one bad, and if the bed is made, the table set and candles lit, the good one says “may it be like this next week” and the bad one says amen, as well as the opposite.</p>\n<p>This therefore is the inspiration for Shalom Alechem, the second one actually referenced by it.</p>\n<p>So, the issue is, are we attributing free will to angels? Are they capable of providing blessings of their own accord? To remedy this, we say Ribon Kol HaOlamin, which is preceded by כִּי מַלְאָכָיו יְצַוֶּה־לָּךְ לִשְׁמׇרְךָ בְּכׇל־דְּרָכֶיךָ (Tehillim 91:11). Hashem is יְצַוֶּה־לָּךְ – He commands the angels concerning you, and they are merely His messengers. Then in Ribon Kol HaOlamin, we say אָנָּא מֶלֶךְ מַלְכֵי הַמְּלָכִים צ<strong>ַוֵּה לְמַלְאָכֶיךָ</strong> מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת מְשָׁרְתֵי עֶלְיון שֶׁיִּפְקְדוּנִי…, framing the whole of Shalom Alechem and the Aggadah from Shabbat through the lens of Psalm 91. We are not praying to angels to bless us, but praying to Hashem to command His angels to bless us! As we say further:  וּבְרוּכִים הֵם מַלְאָכֶיךָ הַקְּדוֹשִׁים וְהַטְּהוֹרִים שֶׁעֹשִׂים רְצוֹנֶךָ . It also includes all the preparations mentioned in the Aggadah – כִּי הִדְלַקְתִּי נֵרותַי וְהִצַּעְתִּי מִטָּתִי and later on וְאִמְרוּ בָּרוּךְ לְשֵׁלְחָנִי הֶעָרוּךְ. We even mention the 3 times we are supposed to say Vayechulu as per the first Aggada . וּבַאתִי לְבֵיתְךָ לְהַפִּיל תְּחִנָתִי לְפָנִיךָ שֶׁתַּעֲבִיר אַנְחָתִי. <em><strong>וָאָעִיד</strong></em> אֲשֶׁר בָּרָאתָ בְּשִׁשָּׁה יָמִים כָּל הַיְּצוּר <em><strong>וָאָשְׁנָה</strong></em>. <em><strong>וָאֲשַׁלַּשׁ עוֹד לְהָעִיד עַל כּוֹסִי בְּתוֹךְ שִמְחָתִי</strong></em></p>\n\n\n",

The 'כלה' is the 'missing link' in her husband's family. She is included in their family and completes it by creating a new unit within their family through her marriage to their son. My addition: She is נכללת within her husband, like אשתו כגופו, her last name also changes to her husband's last name etc.\nSimilarly, the terms 'חם' (father-in-law) and 'חמות’' (mother-in-law) are likened to a 'חומה' (wall) for her: just as a wall surrounds and includes everything within it and accepts those who enter, so do they accept the bride into their family and 'surround her like a wall', as the saying goes.</p>\n<p>The root ח'ת'נ', on the other hand, indicates the connection made between the two families, and thus it is shared by both the groom and the bride's family, who marry together.

Rabbi Hirsch explains that the meaning of the root ח'ת'נ' is the delicate, harmonious connection between the two families through their children's marriage. Alternatively, it can be explained that the root ח'ת'נ' is related to the word 'תחת' (underneath), as the fundamental letters of both words are ח'ת', indicating that there is a new level established 'תחת (under)' the two families from which it is founded. In any case, since the essence of the root is to denote the union created between the two families, it applies to both the groom and his in-laws.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# הפה שאסר הוא הפה שהתיר\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On Bava Metzia 3a, it talks about a concept that if a plaintiff claims Bob owes him 100 and Bob says no I don’t, nothing is done, but if Bob admits and says “I only only you 50, not 100,” (or if witnesses say he owes at least 50) then Bob has to swear that he doesn’t owe the other 50.</p>\n<p>In mishnayot Ketubot, there’s this concept of הפה שאסר הוא הפה שהתיר. For example, if a woman says “I was taken captive but am pure,” we believe her because she gave herself the thought of being impure by telling us she was a captive, so therefore the latter half of her statement is believable (otherwise if she was impure, she wouldn’t have mentioned being captive in the first place to take away suspicion). But if witnesses say “she was taken captive” and she says “no I’m pure,” we now don’t believe her because she didn’t אסר herself.</p>\n<p>Anyway, while these two things don’t exactly line up, my question is why in the case of when Bob admits he owes 50 do we not believe him about the other 50 and we make him swear? Him admitting to owing 50 seems to be a case of הפה שאסר and you would think that we believe he doesn’t actually owe the other 50, because otherwise he would’ve just said he owes nothing and then he’d be fine and have no suspicion against him. So why doesn’t the concept of הפה שאסר apply to the Bava Metzia case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While it's a little more complicated than this (and is, if I remember correctly, a machlokes Rishonim in how to understand both of these rules), this is more or less the difference.</p>\n<p>\"הפה שאסר הוא הפה שהתיר\" is said in a case where we would have no reason to be suspicious of the defendant. This is caused through a מיגו, meaning we say \"if the defendant had wanted to lie, he could have done/ said xyz, which would be more advantageous for him\" (more or less. Again, argument in the rishonim).</p>\n<p>For example, if a woman says \"I was taken captive but I am pure\" we believe her; because she is the one that caused us to be suspicious in the first place, she can alleive that suspicion with her own words (in other words, if she were going to lie in order to get out of the situation, she wouldn't have said anything at all. This is called a מיגו דאי בעיה שתיק, meaning \"from the fact that he could have been quiet had he wanted to\").</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we <em>do</em> have reason to be suspicious of the defendant (Bob, as per OP's example) in the case in Bava Metzia. Firstly, because he is being sued and not himself raising the suspicion (though tosafos on Kesubos 15b says this doesn't affect the ruling, either way הפה שאסר should be applicable, Rashi there disagrees). And secondly, more importantly, in Bava Metzia 3a - 3b the defendant has no מיגו. We are suspicious of him, because this is <em>exactly</em> what he would say if he were lying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאמר רבה: מפני מה אמרה תורה מודה מקצת הטענה ישבע חזקה אין אדם מעיז פניו בפני בעל חובו והאי בכוליה בעי דנכפריה והא דלא כפריה משום שאין אדם מעיז פניו בפני בעל חובו</p>\n<p>As Rabbah said: why did the Torah say that one who admits to owing part of the claim must swear? We have a Chazaka that a man doesn't brazenly lie in front of his lender. And really he would like to deny owing anything, and the fact that he didn't is because a man doesn't brazenly lie in front of his lender</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The translation is mine, sorry for any bad grammar etc.)</p>\n<p>In essence, he is too scared or embarrassed to completely deny his debt, so he admits to owing half (the gemara discusses in the next line or so why he isn't too embarrassed to only admit to half). Which means, that since there is no more advantageous lie he could feasibly claim, we entertain the possibility that he is lying, and we don't say \"הפה שאסר הוא הפה שהתיר\"</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, it got so bad that Rome banned Jews from seeking converts. Everyone was proselytizing; there were even Buddhist in the city of Alexandria.</p>\n<p>Nothing in Judaism is against proselytizing. So, why don’t Jews seek converts today? One reason is that  Jews are taught that one not need to be Jewish to have a share in world to come. This is true. However, Maimonides makes it clear that non-Jews must observe the Noahide laws and, for the right reasons. There is another reason why Jews stopped making converts. Once mysticism was introduced into Judaism some Jews began to fancy that they were biologically superior to non-Jews. They feared bringing in non-Jews into their community may dilute the “blood.” Lastly, Jews didn't proselvtize out of fear. Not because not allowed.</p>\n<p>My own personal view is that Jews should activity be seeking converts purely for academic reasons. Academically, you will agree that 2+2=4, and not 5. It is the same with the Torah. If your convinced that the Torah is true then why not share that wisdom with everyone else? If you found the cure to cancer you would publish it for all. It behooves you to want to share God’s Torah with the world.</p>\n<p>Judaism is not a race. Judaism is a religion. The Torah is clear that there is one law for the convert and the born Jew. Abraham was a Gentile. Abraham was not a Jew, but a Noahide. God never \"recreated\" man since Adam (making a superior one called the Jew); all humans are identical. We all come from Adam and Eve. We are all identical. Both King David and the messiah descend from Ruth the convert. Ruth was a gentile who converted and Kings David and Solomon, as well as the Messiah descend from her. We see from here that gentiles have the same capacity to become the greatest leaders as those who are born to Jewish parents. We are all identical.</p>\n<p>Thus, Jews should proselytize. Put differently, we are never commanded not to proselytize. There is no Torah law or rabbinical law barring us from proselytizing non-Jews.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# (how) does מיגו still work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A מיגו is a logical argument used multiple times throughout the Rishonim and Achronim (for example, the Sha\"Ch has a very long discussion about it here: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Siftei_Kohen_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat%2C_Dinei_Migo?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org.il/Siftei_Kohen_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat%2C_Dinei_Migo?lang=he</a>)</p>\n<p>The way the argument works is basically like this: if a claimant claims one thing, and he could have claimed something else that would have been advantageous to him, without any downside, then I believe him, seeing as if he had wanted to lie he could have lied in a 'better' way.</p>\n<p>One example of a Migo is in Bava Basra (32b) in which a man goes to Rabbah Bar Nachmani with a bill. When the defendant claims it's forged, the man agrees, but claims he had a real bill beforehand and it had gotten lost. Rabbah Bar Nachmani said the man gets the money, Migo that he could have lied and said \"it's not forged\".</p>\n<p>Seeing as some specific examples of Migos are readily available, and in theory a cheater or thief could learn them and use one to his advantage and claim the worse claim in order to remove any suspicion from himself, would we still use Migos today?</p>\n<p>For example, in the gemara mentioned above, if the man had knowledge of Migos, we might worry that he actually had never had a bill, and now he's lying by saying that it was forged but he had a real one that got lost (knowing he'll be believed because of Migo). And he won't claim the 'better' lie, that it's a real bill, for any number of secondary reasons, which in classical Migo-rules wouldn't cancel the Migo (maybe he's worried that at some point in the future the bill will be revealed as a forgery, and he'd like to circumvent that, for example).</p>\n<p>I've seen this potential problem discussed, I don't remember where. Does anybody know where this can be found, and what the mefarshim answer?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I don't know how to tag this, suggestions/ edits are appreciated.</p>\n\n\n",

Immediately after this was complete, Haman was executed. Within a few months, the decree was officially reversed (Sivan 23) and a counter-decree was sent.</p>\n<p>Therefore it is conceivable that nobody ran away because the whole thing was over very quickly. It wasn't \"completely over\" until Adar 13 3405, but the danger was effectively over and it was merely a concern that some people might go against the new orders and kill anyway. I doubt that was the kind of mortal danger that would compel people to run away, as the original decree might have been.</p>\n<p>Also note that there is plenty in the sources that the Jews fully accepted that this decree was from heaven and not a mortal \"happening\". They would have realised that running away would have done no good in the face of a decree from heaven. Instead they focussed on teshuva, as mentioned.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In Mechilta D'Rashbi, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין לך כל אומה ומלכות שנשתעבדה בהן בישראל ולא שלטה מסוף העולם ועד סופו מפני כבודן של ישראל... במלכות מדי הוא אומר... ושם המלך אחשוורוש מס על הארץ ואיי הים</p>\n<p>There is no nation or kingdom which enslaved Israel which didn't control the entire world, for the dignity of Israel... By the kingdom of Media it says... \"And king Achashverosh placed a tax on the land and on the islands\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(A similar sentiment can be found in the gemara of megilla)</p>\n<p>So we see that Achashverosh ruled the entire world. Of course, according to history, this isn't accurate. However, it's possible the meaning is that Achashverosh ruled over the known, or at least civilized, world. Either way, the meaning is pretty clear: the Jews had nowhere to go.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It's an interesting question.</p>\n<p>The story of purim takes place 57 years after the destruction of the first beis hamikdash. Jerusalem was decimated and destroyed, even the effort to rebuild the beis hamikdash was halted, by haman and his sons, and signed off by King achashverosh, which seemingly shows that Achashverosh had influence even in jerusalem.</p>\n<p>Practically, Achashverosh had dominion over majority of the known world, it doesn't seem like there was an actual place for the jews to flee to - which also shows the magnitude of the decree.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Are we supposed to live in the matrix?",
    "content": "# Are we supposed to live in the matrix?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachaya, while discussing why Hashem requires us to work so hard for our livelihood and in our service of Him says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart%2C_Fourth_Treatise_on_Trust.3.37?vhe=Chovat_Halevavot,_Warsaw_1875.&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaar Habitachon ch. 4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיה מחמלת הבורא יתעלה על האדם שהטרידו בעניני עולמו ואחריתו להתעסק כל\nימי חייו בזה ולא יבקש מה שאינו צריך לו ולא יוכל להשיגו בשכלו כמו עניני\nההתחלה והתכלה כמו שאמר החכם (קהלת ג יא) גם את העולם נתן בלבם מבלי אשר\nלא ימצא האדם את המעשה אשר עשה האלהים מראש ועד סוף.</p>\n<p>It was out of compassion for man that G-d has compelled him to be\noccupied with matters of this world and the next for all of his days,\nand so that he does not seek that which he does not need and which he\ncannot understand with his limited intellect, such as matters of what\nwas before the creation and of the final end, as the wise man said\n\"also the the world He has set into their hearts, so that man should\nnot seek the deed which G-d did, from beginning to end.\" (Koheles\n3:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I first learned this, I had to turn it over dozens of times in my head. It doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility that what Rabbeinu Bachaye is saying is that the reason we are not meant to enquire about what came before and what came after is because Hashem commands us to live in this world, and not try to raise our awareness. A mashal to help explain my point would be the famous scene in the movie The Matrix.</p>\n<p>In this movie, the character Neo (as well as much of humanity) thinks that he is living in the normal real world, until he encounters Morpheus, who shows him that this is not true, and offers him a choice between two pills:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Morpheus says \"You take the blue pill... the story ends, you wake up\nin your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red\npill... you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit\nhole goes.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Neo proceeds to take the red pill, and finds out that he is actually in some alien simulation chamber, with his brain wired up to the \"matrix\", which is a computer simulation. He is shown that his whole world has not been real.</p>\n<p>The writers of this movie claimed that they based it on Kabbalistic concepts, fwiw. However, please be aware that I do not want to take anything more from the movie beyond the point made that the reality we see as filtered through our physical bodies is an incomplete picture, and we learn about what else there is to reality beyond that, by studying Torah. Examples would include that there is a spiritual world, that Hashem runs everything and not nature, that the physical gets its reality from Hashem rather than in and of itself, etc.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the point I am trying to ask about is that it seems that, given the pasuk he brings and the way he words things, and the wider context, that it could be that our Rebbi is teaching us that the reason why we are forbidden from \"seeking that which was before creation and that which will be after\" is because Hashem doesn't want us to take the red pill! We are meant to take the blue pill and live in this \"worldly world\". Any raising of our awareness is forbidden.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples off the top of my head</strong> that may or may not be what Rabbeinu Bachaya is talking about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A person who views everything as the will of Hashem, and therefore hurts people and blames Hashem for causing that to happen.</li>\n<li>A person who views the physical as not real, so doesn't really mourn when someone passes away because they see the person as being in a \"better place now\".</li>\n<li>A person doesn't run away from danger because they think that they should instead just pray to Hashem, who is the one causing the danger and the only source of salvation.</li>\n<li>The excellent point made by user9806 in the comments: we are meant to hate the yeitzer hara, but we also learn that the yeitzer hara is a faithful servent of Hashem that is necessary for His plan and our wellbeing. If we get our head too much into the latter, we will find it hard to do the former.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Basically, the type of thinking and behaviour that we'd imagine a person might end up with if they spend too much time thinking about the reality that is above creation, so that this world is no longer \"embedded in their heart\".</p>\n<p><strong>Examples from sources:</strong></p>\n<p>Nefesh Hachaim (3:3) also explains that the reason we are not meant to learn Kabbalah is because it is forbidden and dangerous for us to raise our awareness like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכמה זהירות יתירה צריך האדם להזהר בזה ולשמור את נפשו מאד במשמרת\nלמשמרת. שאם ח״ו יקחנו לבנו לקבוע לנו מחשבה זו להתיר לעצמנו להתנהג גם\nבמעשה לפי המחשבה זו. הלא יוכל להולד מזה ח״ו הריסת כמה יסודות התוה״ק\nר״ל. ובנקל יוכל להלכד ח״ו ברשת היצר שיראה לו היתרא עפ״י מחשבה זו דרך\nמשל להרהר בד״ת בשאט נפש אף במקומות המטונפי'. אחר שיוקבע אצלו תחלה שהכל\nאלהות גמור. ורז״ל הפליגו בזה מאד וכרתוהו ברוח קדשם מהיות לו חלק לעה״ב\nר״ל. כמ״ש (ברכות כ״ד ב') שבכלל כי דבר ה' בזה הוא גם המהרהר ד״ת במבואות\nהמטונפים. וממילא נשמע סיפי' דהאי קרא הכרת תכרת וכו' ופירשוהו ז״ל בפ'\nחלק (סנהדרין צ' ע״ב) הכרת בעה״ז תכרת לעה״ב. ועוד כמה טעיות שיוכל לצא'\nח״ו אם היה נקבע ההנהגה במעשה עפ״י זה הדרך.</p>\n<p>A person must exercise extreme caution in this matter and constantly\nguard his soul-Nefesh. For if (heaven forefend) our heart/mind would\nfixate on this idea, to permit ourselves to act based on this idea,\nit’s possible for the effect of this (heaven forefend) to be the\ndestruction of many of the holy Torah’s basic principles (may the\nMerciful save us). And with ease he would be trapped (heaven forefend)\nin the snare of the inclination who will demonstrate to him\nthat it is permitted based on this idea, for example, to ponder the\nwords of Torah when in a state of disgust, even in filthy places,\nafter he’s first determined for himself that everything is absolute\nGodliness. And our sages strongly opposed this, and employing\ntheir holy spirit, cut him off from having a share in the\nworld-to-come (may the Merciful save us), as is written (Berakhot 24b)\nthat included in the category of “for he has denigrated God’s word” is\nalso one who ponders words of Torah in filthy alley ways. And in any\ncase, the last part of that text says “he shall be cut off\n[emphatically]”, and the sages explained it to mean that he will\nbe cut off both from this world and the world-to-come. And many more\nerrors could be caused (heaven forefend) if one determines active\nbehavior in that way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By getting our head out of \"the matrix\" and into \"wonderland\", we will end up not taking this world seriously anymore. A smelly bathroom will lose it's disgust because we won't see it that way, we will just see \"Godliness permeating the universe\" etc.</p>\n<p>Another related issue that comes from having \"too much Emunah\" in our sources is the answer from Rav Kook to why Hashem created Atheists:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Sometimes we who believe, believe too much. We see the cruelty, the\nsuffering, the injustice in the world and we say: ‘This is the will of\nGod.’ We accept what we should not accept. That is when God sends us\natheists to remind us that what passes for religion is not always\nreligion. Sometimes what we accept in the name of God is what we\nshould be fighting against in the name of God.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10130/looking-for-more-information-about-a-story-of-positive-atheism-heresy\">this answer</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>So is this what Rabbeinu Bachaye is saying? Is this one of the answers to this question: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/133588/not-inquiring-about-pre-creation-why\">Not inquiring about pre-creation - why?</a>. Is there a general injuction in Torah Law against \"taking the red pill\"? Does it apply to today? If so, is there any reason for it beyond that we might accidentally make a bracha in the bathroom and the like (which can just be interpreted as immaturity and foolishness)? The best answer would be bringing a source that discusses this very point at length (it doesn't have to quote The Matrix though).</strong></p>\n<p>Note: presenting alternative explanations of this Rabbeinu Bachaya - no matter how valid and well sourced - doesn't technically answer my question because there might be multiple interpretations, so therefore that wouldn't prove the negative.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, as here, when the verse states they each had six wings, it is referring to the time when the Temple is standing, while there, where four wings are described, it is referring to the time when the Temple is not standing, for it is as if the number of the wings of the animals were diminished so that they now have only four.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the melachim who only had four wings were present in the time of exile, a time of churban, post the Beis Hamikdash (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.13b.8?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Chagigah.13b.8.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi</a>).</p>\n<p>The Gemara continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֵי מִינַּיְיהוּ אִימַּעוּט? אָמַר רַב חֲנַנְאֵל אָמַר רַב: אוֹתָן שֶׁאוֹמְרוֹת שִׁירָה בָּהֶן.</p>\n<p>Which of the wings were diminished?

And they answer it's the ones they fly with.</p>\n<p>Explained Rav Farhi, even angels, spiritual beings, when they experience churban they lose the ability to fly.</p>\n<p>Applying this to the case of Yaakov. Yaakov was in the middle of immense trauma. He was fleeing to the unknown, from his twin who was hell-bent on murdering him.

As Jews, we have to set the standard and example for others.</p>\n<p>Indeed, this was the difference between Yaakov and Eisav. The Zohar on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Toldot.19.158?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Parshas Toldos</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּעַשׂ גַּם הוּא מַטְעַמִּים וְגו'. (בראשית כ״ז:ל״א) יָקוּם אָבִי, דִּבּוּרֵיהּ הֲוָה בְּעַזּוּת, בִּתְקִיפוּ רוּחָא, מִלָּה דְּלֵית בָּהּ טַעֲמָא, יָקוּם אָבִי. תָּא חֲזֵי, מַה בֵּין יַעֲקֹב לְעֵשָׂו, יַעֲקֹב אָמַר בִּכְסִיפוּ דְּאֲבוֹי, בַּעֲנָוָה, מַה כְּתִיב, (בראשית כ״ז:י״ח) וַיָּבֹא אֶל אָבִיו וַיֹּאמֶר אָבִי. מַה בֵּין הַאי לְהַאי, אֶלָּא, דְּלָא בָעָא לְאִזְדַּעְזְעָא לֵיהּ, מַלִּיל בְּלָשׁוֹן תַּחֲנוּנִים, (בראשית כ״ז:י״ט) קוּם נָא שְׁבָה וְאָכְלָה מִצֵּידִי. וְעֵשָׂו אָמַר, יָקוּם אָבִי, כְּמַאן דְּלָא מַלִּיל עִמֵּיהּ.</p>\n<p>\"And he also had made savory food...Let my father arise\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.31?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishis 27:31</a>). His speech was impertinent, rough, and impolite. Come and behold the difference between Yaakov and Eisav. Yaakov talked to his father humbly, with humility. It is written, \"And he came to his father, and said, My father\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ibid. 18</a>). The difference between the language of Eisav and Yaakov is that Yaakov did not want to frighten him. Thus, he spoke humbly, saying \"arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison.\" Eisav, however, said \"Let my father arise,\" as if he was not speaking to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, even if the person being spoken to is not particularly nice, or acts in an incorrect way that warrants a reaction, it is still not right to take a rude tone.</p>\n<p>Refer to the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.7a.19?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Brochos 7a</a> where a known heretic would regularly upset Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, by challenging him on the legitimacy of certain verses. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, had enough and planned to curse him at the point in the day where G-d's anger, as it were, flares, thus making it more potent. However, at the desired time he fell asleep. From there he concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁמַע מִינַּהּ, לָאו אוֹרַח אַרְעָא לְמֶעְבַּד הָכִי. ״וְרַחֲמָיו עַל כָּל מַעֲשָׂיו״ כְּתִיב</p>\n<p>Conclude from the fact that I nodded off that it is not proper conduct to do so, to curse people, even if they are wicked. “His mercy is over all His creations” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.145.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Psalms 145:9</a>) is written even with regard to sinners. (William Davidson translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A final point to note is that not only is it incorrect to be rude or impolite but it also has an adverse effect.</p>\n<p>Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.16?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eruvin 54a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(סִימָן: ״עֲנָקִים״ ״לְחָיָיו״ ״לוּחוֹת״ ״חָרוּת״). אָמַר רַבִּי (אֱלִיעֶזֶר): מַאי דִּכְתִיב ״וַעֲנָקִים לְגַרְגְּרוֹתֶיךָ״, אִם מֵשִׂים אָדָם עַצְמוֹ כַּעֲנָק זֶה שֶׁרָף עַל הַצַּוָּאר וְנִרְאֶה וְאֵינוֹ נִרְאֶה — תַּלְמוּדוֹ מִתְקַיֵּים בְּיָדוֹ. וְאִם לָאו — אֵין תַּלְמוּדוֹ מִתְקַיֵּים בְּיָדוֹ</p>\n<p>In light of the previous discussion, the Gemara cites several expositions of verses proposed by Rabbi Eliezer, while first providing them with a mnemonic: Chains, cheeks, tablets, engraved. Rabbi Eliezer said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “And chains about your neck” (Proverbs 1:9)? If a person makes himself like a chain that hangs loosely on the neck, i.e., if a scholar is not pushy and disruptive to others, and he is also seen but not seen, i.e., just as a chain is covered by clothes and hair, so too, the scholar does not let himself be seen, his Torah study will endure. But if not, if he acts in a rude and arrogant manner, his Torah study will not endure. (William Davidson translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Ramban advises in his Iggeres Haramban (Sefaria translation taken from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Iggeret_HaRamban.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Accustom yourself to always speak all of your words calmly, to every\nman and at every time. In doing so you will prevent your anger from\nflaring, which is a bad attribute in a man which may cause him to sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is only one situation where one is allowed to be rude, and that is when mocking idolatry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב נחמן: כל ליצנותא אסירא, בר מליצנותא דעבודה זרה — דשריא.</p>\n<p>Rav Nachman says: All mockery is forbidden, except the mockery of idol worship, which is\npermitted [Megilla 25b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Ashi also says one is allowed to publicly mock a person who has a reputation of being a philanderer (following Rashi, R Steinsaltz).</p>\n<p>Nowadays we don't have idolatry like in the gemara, and what we consider normal in today's society for a majority of people would be considered \"promiscuous\" by Rav Ashi's standards, so it's a question of if this still applies. I heard in a shiur that nowadays we would apply this to selfishness, which is a form of self-worship, as mocking the selfishness is a great way to highlight to a person how silly and childish they are being. CYLOR before applying this though!</p>\n<p>Mockery is an insanely overpowered weapon - an extremely destructive one at that - so it must be weilded with extreme care in any permissible circumstances (which are few, if any), and generally avoided like we would avoid keeping a bomb in our possession.</p>\n<p>Either way, none of this applies to your examples. Other answers have already explained at length that being rude is categorically forbidden in all such circumstances. The comments have raised that it might be ok to be rude to a corporation, but we wouldn't agree. A corporation is made up of valuable human beings who are just doing their job, and being rude to them is just as sacreligious as anything else (and generally doesn't help, it just makes the world a more sad, and stubbornly-angry place).</p>\n\n\n",

In order to do this, a tzaddik sometimes needs to \"descend to a lower level than his own\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Noam_Elimelech%2C_Sefer_Bereshit%2C_Toldot.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Noam Elimelech, Parshas Toldos 5)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אך הענין הוא, דהנה כשיש רשעים בדור שהם מעכבים ההשפעות, אזי הצדיק הרוצה להשפיע לעולם צריך לירד ממדריגתו עד סוף מדריגתו תחתונה ע\"ד שאמר הכתוב ממעמקים קראתיך, ולכן בימי אברהם שהיה דורו רשעים והיה צריך לירד ממדריגתו לגמרי, לכן הוכרח לירד מצרימה ששם הוא מקום עב ומגושם ביותר כדי שיטה עצמו גם הוא ממדריגתו העליונה, שיהא יוכל להשפיע ע\"י תפילתו, תפילה לעני כו', דהמתפלל צריך להיות כעני עומד על הפתח, אבל יצחק הגם שהיה דורו רשעים לא היה צריך לירד מצרימה כדי לגשם עצמו, דהנה ידוע דאותו דבר אשר כבר תיקן איזה צדיק בתפילתו, אזי אח\"כ אם יארע לצדיק שיהיה אחריו ג\"כ אותו הדבר, בקל הוא לו לפעול הדבר הזה מחמת שכבר תיקן הצדיק הקודם לו, ולטעם הזה אמר הכתוב \"מלבד הרעב הראשון\", כדי לתת טעם לזה שלא היה צריך יצחק לירד מצרים. וק\"ל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Refer to the section \"sources\" in the Peer Mikdoshim-version of the Noam Elimelech, where it says this idea (p. 84). See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/133141/27180\">my question here</a> on \"raising the sparks\". Refer also the <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/14359/p/29/t/0.84092812602724171234/fs/KOd0rOlWDSuNbIotR03UORQapabLIXX8BK5mU1Tesy78/start/2148/end/2155/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Or Torah\" by the Maggid of Mezritch (Parashas Vayeishev)</a>.</p>\n<p>With the holiness of the tzadik, the \"light of the Tzadik\" as the Noam Elimelech calls it <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Noam_Elimelech%2C_Sefer_Bereshit%2C_Toldot.6.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Toldos 6)</a>, he can influence the wicked.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויזרע יצחק בארץ ההיא כו'. דהנה דוד המלך ע\"ה אמר \"אור זרוע לצדיק כו'\", יש לפרש דאור הוא זרוע אצל הצדיק, דהיינו הקדושה והאור שבו הוא כמו זריעה שעושה פירות, שהוא גורם בקדושתו התעוררות יראה על כל העולם וזורע בבני אדם האור הקדושה, \"ולישרי לב שמחה\" ר\"ל ואותם שאינם רק ישרי לב, יש להם מדרגת שמחה, דהיינו שבני אדם שמחים עמהם בראותם אותם, אבל אינם יכולים להזריע אורות קדושות באחרים. וזהו \"ויזרע יצחק בארץ ההיא\" כנ\"ל, שהזריע בבני אדם יראה וקדושה, \"וימצא בשנה ההיא מאה שערים\", דחייב אדם לברך מאה ברכות בכל יום. והם נתקנו נגד מאה נפשות שהיו מתים בכל יום ותיקן דוד המלך ע\"ה נגדם מאה ברכות, והצדיק הזה המזריע קדושה ויראה בבני אדם הרי הוא כאילו מחיה אותם, ועל ידי זה הוא גורם תיקון למאה שערים הידועים, כי לכל איש ואיש יש שער מיוחד לו, והמקיימו הוא מתקן אותו השער המיוחד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, this got me thinking of something I rembembered reading. The Satmar Rav in his <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/641603/p/70/t/0.82883384917911811234/fs/oyYY1zUkeOvlQEHerFCfphLFk74oizNNEmovnvw0tcbp/start/18/end/42/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chiddushei Torah (תשט\"ז 1956) on parshas Chayei Sarah</a> explains that although Avraham Avinu prayed for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, he never wanted to associate with them. Why not? Because one should not associate with the wicked.</p>\n<p>Avraham Avinu wanted to bring people closer to G-d and His Torah, as is said in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D%27Rabbi_Natan.12.8?ven=Avot_DeRabbi_Natan,_trans._by_David_Kasher,_2019&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos D'Rabi Noson (12:8)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And bring them closer to Torah. How so? This teaches us that a person should prevail upon others and bring them under the wings of the Divine Presence, just as Abraham prevailed upon those around him and brought them under the wings of the

For tucking under your head:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Gen 28:10-22 ESV] [10] Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran. [11] And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. <strong>Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. [12] And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!</strong> [13] And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, \"I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. [14] Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. [15] Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.\" [16] Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, \"Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.\" [17] And he was afraid and said, \"How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\" [18] So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. [19] He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. [20] Then Jacob made a vow, saying, \"If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, [21] so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God, [22] and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or a huge ziggurat, like in <a href=\"https://smarthistory.org/ziggurat-of-ur/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ur</a>, <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yoHbS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">with prominent staircases</a>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It seems that you're conflating the stone that Jacob put under his head (v. 11) and later annointed (v. 18) with the ladder he saw in his dream (v. 12). It seems clear that the former is a real object, while the latter is a figment of his dream.</p>\n<p>It also seems clear that the stone was small enough to move around and to fit under Jacob's head, so it was probably too small to survive for thousands of years without special care. I have never heard of a tradition identifying it with an extant structure.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone hold that you judge kashrut based on ingredient lists with no actual supervision of the making of the product?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Basically, it depends on the product. Meat has to be slaughtered and prepared by observant Jews. Grape juice or wine can only be touched by observant Jews before pasteurization. Certain cooked foods require an observant Jew to perform the cooking (or according to Ashkenazi custom, to turn on the fire before cooking), etc. In these cases, knowing the ingredients is not enough, one also needs to know that the proper rules were followed.</p>\n<p>Some foods do not have these requirements, and one just needs to ensure that all the ingredients are kosher. However, many foods have ingredients that are not listed explicitly on the label (often in the context of catch-all terms like \"flavorings\"). Some ingredients (e.g. glycerin) can be made from both kosher and non-kosher sources. It requires expertise in kashrus to know which kinds of foods can be determined to be kosher from the label and which can't.</p>\n<p>In my personal experience, rabbis involved in kashrus are willing to look at a label. Sometimes they say the product is kosher, and sometimes they tell you to verify some information with the company that makes it. And sometimes they tell you you need to get product with a hechsher.</p>\n<p>Certain products are known to not be problematic and require no hechsher, such as unflavored water and seltzer, extra-virgin olive oil, etc.</p>\n<p>And some products might not need a hechser but require examination at home, such as many vegetables that need to be checked for insect infestation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>The simple answer giving by kashrut organizations is no.</strong> Many industrially-manufactured products go through complex production processes, at times unexpected. For instance R Elefant, the COO of <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kosher-lists/3502/no-hechsher-required/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OU Kosher</a>, said that in some cases, the same steam pipe is used to heat vegetables in one industrial pot, and pork and beans in another, with the hot steam pipe connecting the two !

Thus, Mizrahim, Sephardim, and Israeli speakers transliterate Kamatz Gadol as “a”.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The linked discussion is discussing spelling, rather than pronunciation. While it is true that the\ntraditional way to pronounce it is Matzoh (mah-tzaw), there is an epidemic of sorts in the US of people pronouncing it Matzah (mah-tzah). This\nstems from the way that American English enunciation works.\nThe correct way to pronounce the Komatz is as an open-mid-back-rounded vowel (click on this link for a recording <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/File:PR-open-mid_back_rounded_vowel.ogg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/File:PR-open-mid_back_rounded_vowel.ogg</a>). This sound is produced by making an o-shape with the lips while vocalizing. This kind of enunciation is not  common in American English (it can be seen in words like “thought” in some parts of the US), and as such, Americans typically substitute the nearest common vowel. In European languages (such as German or French), this vowel is found more frequently, and thus nationals of these countries have an easier time differentiating the sounds. In American pronunciations, the vowel which is substituted is an open-mid-back-unrounded vowel (sound here: <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/File:PR-open-mid_back_unrounded_vowel2.ogg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/File:PR-open-mid_back_unrounded_vowel2.ogg</a>). This is produced in the same part of the mouth as the previous pronunciation, but without rounding the lips into an O shape. In some communities, this has devolved even further, becoming a near-open central vowel (<a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/File:Near-open_central_unrounded_vowel.ogg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.wikiwand.com/en/File:Near-open_central_unrounded_vowel.ogg</a>).\nWhen it comes to spelling, there are several factors in play. There is a debate about whether to use an A, an O, or (less commonly) a U, as the Komatz sound. The reason for this debate is that there is a general consensus that none of the aforementioned letters perfectly match the sound of <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TXksA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/TXksA.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>the Komatz. Another factor being considered is that each of these letters also represents another Neqqudoh (A for Passach, O for Cholam, U for Shuruk). I think the\nreason that A is most commonly used is that the phonetic sound for Komatz is more similar to that of the Passach than it is to the Cholam or Shuruk, and using one of the others is therefore more likely to cause confusion. (A good example of where this can get confusing is the word Cholent/Chulent. Both are pronounced the same, but the latter one looks like it might say “choo-lent.”) Another factor to be considered is the culture one comes from. As is mentioned by the second reply in the Mi Yodeya forum, it is common for people to transliterate words according to how they pronounce them. The poster also brings up the use of T vs S in words like Brit/Bris, and this would likely go together with how one would transliterate the Komatz.\nA third factor to consider is the conventions of the language being used to transliterate. In\nGermanic languages (e.g. German, English etc.), a Komatz is generally transliterated with an A.\nIn German communities, the standard conventions of transliteration are very unusual, to say the least. Komatz is almost always an A, and a ssof (ת (is always transliterated with a T, even though it is never pronounced as such. You can still see this in many Yekkishe communities, such as Washington Heights.\nI was recently exchanging emails with the Chazzan of the Yekke shul in Lakewood (he’s from\nWashington Heights) about the spelling of a certain word, and he mentioned that he believes the correct niqud is a “pattach [sic].” However, when I was discussing the same matter with him in person a week later, he pronounced it as “passach.” A similar theme is seen with Bris/Brit and Shabbos/Sabbath (the latter one is pronounced “Shabbat” if read in German, and some people write it as such), to name a few.Interestingly, there is a movement now in Washington Heights and other Yekkishe communities to switch from using an A to using an O (I think this is wrong; more on this below). This highlights the cultural effect on the way people transliterate words; not necessarily how they are pronounced, but how it is widely accepted to spell them.\nIf you look at Ashkenazi siddurim printed in the US in recent times, you will come across words that have had their English transliteration standardized, such as:\n• Mincha (or Minchah [the added H represents the ה at the end of the word in Hebrew])\n• Aleinu\n• Shabbos\n• Shalosh Regalim\n• Birkas HaMazzon (or HaMazon; the former accounts for the dagesh in the zayin, while the\nlatter does not)\n• Asher Yatzar\n• Chanukah\n• Amidah\n• Torah\n• Avinu Malkeinu\n• Mussaf\n• Chazzan\n• Shavuos\nThese words have mostly been accepted as being spelled like this. Many people (likely most) will have become accustomed to seeing them spelled as such and would likely be confused if they came across them spelled differently. For some people, the difference in spelling might even make the\nword unintelligible. I’ve listed the same examples here, but changed all occurrences of Komatz to an O:\n• Mincho (or Minchoh)\n• Oleinu\n• Shabbos\n• Sholosh Regolim\n• Birkas HaMozzon (or HaMozon)\n• Asher Yotzar\n• Chanukoh\n• Amidoh\n• Toroh\n• Ovinu Malkeinu\n• Mussof\n• Chazzon\n• Shovuos\nSome of these examples look fine to me (e.g. Asher Yotzar, Amidoh, etc.), but others look\ncompletely wrong (e.g. Toroh, Ovinu Malkeinu, Sholosh, etc.).\nIn the following image (taken of the Roth Machzor Shivchei Yeshurun), we can see some such\napplications and the kind of problems that can arise from it.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PcyAJ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PcyAJ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>On this page, we can see that the author used the accepted conventions for Amida and Pinchas, but used the alternate spelling for Chazzon and Yochonon (to mention a few). Each of these two examples has a problem that arises from using this spelling:\n• Chazzon (חזן  (can be mistaken for Chazon (חזון] (as in Shabbas Chazon]. In Hebrew, a\nKomatz is switched with a Passach at the end of the word if there is a link (סמיכות (between\nit and the next word (e.g. חזן ראשונה  .(This is not the case with a Cholam (at least not when\ndiscussing a Komatz Gadol, which this is).\n• Yochonon appears at first glance to read יוחונון) enough said, I think).</p>\n<p>You can see from my own spelling two lines ago that I don’t stick to one vowel or the other, but\nrather I use them contextually. In the word “komatz,” there is a passach in the word next to the\nkomatz, so I use an O to separate them. In the next word “Gadol,” there a cholam and no passach, so I switch and use an A for the komatz. When there is both a cholam and a passach (e.g הושענא רבה  ,(I use an A, as it is not as confusing (as I mentioned previously) (e.g. Hosha’na Rabboh). I think this is the most objectively clear way to transliterate a komatz. However, if there is clearly\nan accepted convention for how to write something (e.g. Amidah), I think it is more important to\nfollow the convention than to change it for logical reasons.\nIf you look in the Siddur Safah Yesharah, you can see this method applied to the instructions. I’ve attached an image with some examples underlined:</p>\n<p>One notable place with I digress from the accepted convention is the word ,ברכו ,which I always\ntransliterate as Borachu, even though it is generally written as Barchu. The reason for this is that the komatz is a komatz gadol, which causes the Sh’va to be a Sh’va Noh (This is why Yekkes have a Chataf Passach instead of a Sh’va. The two are inherently the same Nekkudoh, but the Passach is used here to avoid people reading it as a Sh’va Nach [this is not actually the reason it is used\nhere, but I’m going to pretend that it is for the purpose of this monologue]).\nThe spelling “Barchu” seems to indicate both that the Komatz is a Komatz Koton (which\nincidentally is traditionally pronounced how the Americans pronounce every Komatz), and also\nthat the ר has a Sh’va Nach. Both of these points are incorrect, and I’ve therefore strayed from the accepted convention to avoid these mistakes.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Ashkenazi Jewery adopted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberian_Hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiberian vocalization</a>, where kamatz is /ɔ/ and hataf-kamatz is /ɔ̆/, with changed length, not the vowel. Sephardi Jewery originally adopted the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_vocalization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Babylonian vocalization</a>, where kamatz is also /ɔ/. However in Spain the pronunciation got further modified with kamatz being split into a long kamatz pronounced as /a/ and kamatz katan (unstressed kamatz) pronounced like short /o/. The hataf-kamatz is also pronounced like short /o/.</p>\n<p>According to comments in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/mikhlol\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">David Kimִchi's Hebrew Grammar Sefer Mikhlol</a> comment 14 on page 32-34, the difference between kamatz and patach has origins in the older vowel terminology, where kamatz denoted vowels with mouth partially closed as opposed to patach where the mouth was widely open. While the described Sepharadi pronunciation is common, Ibn Ezra maintained that Jews of Tiberia, Egypt, and Africa pronounced kamatz <em>correctly</em>, namely /ɔ/ compared to Jews of Spain. Several other authors, such as Ibn Janach and Kuzari, also maintain a similar position.</p>\n<p>It is quite obvious that the masoretes did not differentiate the pronunciation of the long and short kamatz. Ben Asher has given extra care to every vowel, but he did not give any distinction between a long and short kamatz. The difference between kamatz and patach seems to be still present in the first century as seen in the works of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Josephus</a>. It started breaking by the 4th century as one can see in the translation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulgate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vulgate</a>. The difference is entirely absent in modern Hebrew. Since the edition of <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899060149.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artscroll Chumash</a> many authors adopted a cross with modern Sephardi vowel and modern Ashkenazi consonant pronunciation. Hence one can get occasionally an ashkenazi mAtzoh, a sephardi matzAh, and an ashkefardi mAtzah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Pronunciation of ויכולו in Friday night davening\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the accurate pronunciation of word ויכולו which we say in shul Friday night? I've encountered both \"Vaychulu\" and \"Va-yichulu.\" I've been informed about a scholarly dispute (machlokes) regarding the use of sheva Na/Nach in this word, but I'm unsure about the specifics.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Firstly, the word is וַיְ<strong>כֻלּ</strong>וּ, not וַיְ<strong>כוּל</strong>וּ.</p>\n<p>This word begins with Vav Hahippukh. This is the same prefix as in the words ויאמר, ויקרא, ויחל, ויהי, and others. In a feminine word, the י is replaced with ת, like in ותהינה, ותאמר, etc.</p>\n<p>In the default form of Vav Hahippukh, the second letter takes a dagesh, indicating that it is geminated (doubled). For example, see the words וַיֹּאמֶר, וַיִּקְרָא, וַיַּעַל, and any instance of a feminine word with Vav Hahippukh (like וַתֹּאמֶר).</p>\n<p>The tradition for niqqud that we have today comes from the Tiberian Masoretes. They invented the niqqud symbols in order to record the pronunciation of תנ״ך, so that no vowels or gemination would be mixed up or lost. However, by the time they came around, many natural changes had already taken place over the millennia between them and הר סיני. One of these changes was that, probably due to normal quickness of speech, some “weak” letters that used to have gemination, had lost their gemination.</p>\n<p>One such example is that, on a masculine word, if the vowel under the י in Vav Hahippukh has a Shva, the dagesh is removed. Thus, words like וַיְהִי, וַיְחִי, וַיְחַל, and <strong>וַיְכֻלּוּ</strong> do <em>not</em> have a dagesh on the י, and the י is <em>not</em> doubled.</p>\n<p>Shva is only pronounced if it comes under a letter with Dagesh, or if it comes after a long vowel (usually). In this case, neither point is true: The י comes after a Patach, which is a short vowel, and the י lacks a dagesh. Therefore, <strong>the Shva is silent, and the word is pronounced /väy-chul-LU/.</strong></p>\n<p>This does not mean, however, that pronouncing the Shva as na` would be halachically wrong:<br />\nFirstly, Shva is only pronounced in some cases because of tradition, remnants of another vowel that was lost to time, or because pronouncing the word would be difficult otherwise. But really, both the pronounced and silent Shva mark the <em>lack</em> of a vowel. Pronouncing a Shva or keeping it silent won’t (usually) change a word’s meaning.<br />\nSecondly, as stated above, historically the י <em>was</em> geminated, so pronouncing it as such cannot be considered incorrect (this is especially true since in other cases, the י retains the dagesh even to this day). So if you forget that this י doesn’t have a dagesh, then realize your mistake after you read it, it’s completely fine. There’s no point in re-reading the word.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all there is misspeling of the word וַיְכֻלּ֛וּ in the question asked, there is no shuruk, but kubutz. Also the reading vayichulu is not possible, since there is no <em>hirik</em> under yud.</p>\n<p>It seems the argument is about whether the <em>sh'wa</em> on the י - <em>yud</em> is <em>na</em> or <em>nach</em>. Artscroll interprets it as <em>nach</em>, because the vowel under ו - <em>vav</em> is <em>patach</em>, so it's natural to assign the yud as a closure of the 1st syllable וַיְ - <em>vay</em>.</p>\n<p>The other opinion believes that <em>yud</em> should be assigned to the second syllable יְכֻ - y'chu, i.e. that there should be either dagesh chazak in the yud or metheg on vav, separating it from yud, as in ויעשו in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.39.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 39:20</a>. However, as ponted by magicker72, in exceptional cases before yud ויהי and ויחי the metheg does not separate the syllable (Jacobson \"Chanting the Hebrew Bible, Second Edition: The Art of Cantillation, 2nd ed.\" p. 292).</p>\n<p>The <em>Chumash</em> does not have <em>dagesh chazak</em> and it does not have <em>metheg</em>, i.e. there is a contraction resulting from adjoining the ו-ההיפוך as Artscroll has it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does Rashi say that Lavan covered 7 days worth of distance in one day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshas Vayeitze, Rashi comments on the words דרך שבעת ימים, quoting a midrash, saying</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל אותן ג' ימים שהלך המגיד להגיד ללבן הלך יעקב לדרכו, נמצא יעקב רחוק מלבן ששה ימים, ובשביעי השיגו לבן. למדנו שכל מה שהלך יעקב בשבעה ימים הלך לבן ביום אחד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He explains that Yaakov started three days away from Lavan and he had a three day head start on him as he was walking away from him, so Yaakov was 6 days ahead. And Lavan caught up to him on the seventh day, implying that Lavan covered in one day what Yaakov covered in 7 days.</p>\n<p>This doesn't seem to make sense to me. Lavan left on the fourth day, so it seems to me he was walking not 1, but rather 4 days by the time he caught up to Yaakov. That would mean he was moving roughly twice as fast as Yaakov, which seems completely reasonable since he wasn't laden with children and animals in his pursuit. How does Rashi's statement that Lavan was moving 7 times as fast as Yaakov work?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>דרך שבעת ימים doesn't mean \"after Yaakov had fled for 7 days.\" If it was describing the length of time, it would have said שבעה ימים (or ארבעה ימים, starting from Lavan's departure). <strong>דרך</strong> שבעת ימים means Lavan traveled \"7 days' <strong>distance</strong>,\" i.e., the distance normally covered in 7 days. Rashi is saying that if Lavan only had to travel 7 days' distance to reach Yaakov, he must have covered it in a single day, because Yaakov was already 6 days away when Lavan set out.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If lavan was 3 days to (for example) the north of Yaakov, and Yaakov was traveling to the south, then this would be the timeline:</p>\n<p>During the first three days:</p>\n<p>Yaakov is traveling south, a messanger goes north to Lavan and tells him that Yaakov left.</p>\n<p>During the next three days:</p>\n<p>Yaakov is now 6 (slow) days to the south of his original camp, and Lavan reaches Yaakov's camp.</p>\n<p>On the seventh day:</p>\n<p>Yaakov reaches Har Hagil'ad, and so does Lavan.</p>\n<p>Meaning, Lavan traveled from Yaakov's camp to Har Hagil'ad in 1 day, a trip that took Yaakov (+ family, slaves, and cattle) 7 days to make.</p>\n\n\n",

He created new melodies specifically for camp. Bardin and Helfman decided not to use melodies traditionally associated with the Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox movements, a decision that helped keep camp nonsectarian. In addition, by using brand-new melodies composed by Helfman himself, and sung at Alonim to this day, they ensured that all participants would be on an even playing field.

    "content": "# Original version of Radak on borders of Eretz Yisrael after Moshiach comes\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sefaria offers a translation of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Genesis.26.23.1?vhe=Presburg_:_A._Schmid,_1842&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak's commentary to Bereishis 26:23</a>. The translation of that Radak says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויעל משם באר שבע. This was not far away from Gerar as we already\nexplained. As to the reason for the expression ויעל, “he went up,” the\nreason for this is that the part of the Land of Israel which is known\nas the traditional Land of Israel was on a spiritually higher level\nthan the part occupied by the Philistines. This is also why we find\nthe expression ויעלו פלשתים in Judges 15,9 (against Shimshon) as well\nas the phrase uttered by King Sha-ul in Samuel I 14,36 נרדה אחרי\nפלשתים, “Let us pursue the Philistines by descending.” This expression\noccurs again and again. [this seems unnecessary as any student of the\ntopography of Eretz Yisrael knows that the Philistines lived in the\ncoastal strip, i.e. the topographically lowest region of the country,\nso that considerations distinguishing between areas of higher sanctity\nand lesser sanctity are hardly needed to help us understand the\nwording of the Torah here. Ed.] All these stories about the digging of\nthe wells and the names they were called by were intended to inform us\nthat in the part of Eretz Yisrael traditionally promised to Avraham,\nhis son Yitzchok was digging according to his undisputed right. In\nthose areas he also did not encounter opposition when naming these\nwells. All of this was an indication to them of which parts of Eretz\nYisrael G’d had meant for them to plant seed in, i.e. the part of the\nland that G’d would give to the Israelites in the first instance.\n(under Joshua).The regions in which the Philistines dwelled did not\nreally come under full control of the Israelites until many hundreds\nof years later. This accounts for the ongoing wars at intervals\nbetween the Israelites and the Philistines. These skirmishes were\nbasically border-wars, neither side planning to conquer the territory\nof the other permanently. [according to the author the problem would\nbe permanently settled only in Messianic times. Ed.] It is an\noutstanding issue similar to the territory of three Canaanite tribes,\nthe Kenite, Knizite and Kadmoni, which formed part of G’d’s promise to\nAvraham in chapter 15 at the covenant between the pieces but has never\nyet been under Jewish sovereignty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The translation/interpretation seems to be from Eliyahu Munk, HaChut Hameshulash. I was wondering, this piece on Sefaria has an addition that says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This accounts for the ongoing wars at intervals between the Israelites and the Philistines. These skirmishes were basically border-wars, neither side planning to conquer the territory of the other permanently. <strong>[according to the author the problem would be permanently settled only in Messianic times.

Are there maybe manuscripts, original translations etc.. that say this, or is this just an addition from Eliyahu Munk?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Jewish Renewal and patrilineality\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism recognize as Jews by birth children of a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother who were raised exclusively in Judaism. What does Jewish Renewal say about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It's a bit difficult to say because Jewish Renewal isn't organized as one coherent group, so decisions are typically left to individual congregations and Rabbis as the <a href=\"https://halfjewishnetwork.wordpress.com/who-is-a-jew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Half-Jewish Network states</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Jewish Renewal movement does not have an official position on the Jewish status of children of intermarriage. Decisions on Jewish status are left up to the individual rabbis. The Renewal community has a large number of interfaith families. We have received only one complaint about discrimination against patrilineals within a Jewish Renewal community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having said that, if you take a look at some Jewish Renewal-affiliated synagogues such as the <a href=\"https://www.orshalom.ca/patrilineal-descent-or-shalom-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or Shalom synagogue, their Patrillineal descent policy on their website states</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After reviewing the Vaad’s report, and after considerable G-d-wrestling, Or Shalom’s Board concluded that we should adopt the following policy decisions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Or Shalom affirms that people of patrilineal Jewish descent have a claim on Jewish identity. That means we at Or Shalom will not question their own sense of belonging and attachment to the Jewish people and Jewish life.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the same time however, they say (this is what they mean by full participation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>For full participation as a Jew at Or Shalom, people of patrilineal Jewish descent will require mikvah*, and additionally for men, brith mila** or hatafat dam***. There will be no further eligibility requirements for individuals of patrilineal Jewish descent with their own sense of belonging and attachment to the Jewish people and Jewish life. The practical implications for those of patrilineal descent would be the following:</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a) Or Shalom continues the practice that we have had throughout our history. As a community we are open to all that are interested in sharing with us and we will continue to welcome everyone.\nb) While everyone is most welcome to share in our community, it is important that someone who acts and speaks for the community in religious context be someone who is accepted in that role by the whole community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>There are two particular roles where this acceptance is important.</strong> One is <strong>serving the community as shaliah tsibbur, which means, in effect, being the one chosen from among the community by the community to stand before us and lead us all in davvening.</strong> The <strong>other role is being called to an aliya</strong> (including Bar or Bat Mitzvah). This means saying the brachot for a Torah reading on behalf of the entire community gathered together at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, generally speaking (even on the Half-Jewish Network website), Jewish Renewal for almost all of the affiliated synagogues recognizes patrillineal descent. As long as one feels as a part of the Jewish people, they are not questions. And keep in mind that Or Shalom is a synagogue officially affiliated with <a href=\"https://aleph.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aleph</a>, the umbrella organization of Jewish Renewal communities, so they do have some authority within this realm. But do understand that a lot of them might require the standard Jewish protocols to be performed in order to be able to conduct all of the actions fully in the synagogue, even though they might see you as a Jew by merely having patrillineal descent.</p>\n<p>All in all, it is best that you consult Rabbis and synagogues in the Jewish Renewal movement on a case by case basis in order to find out what they think about patrillineal descent and belonging in Judaism, but for almost all of them, it seems that they recognize patrillineal descent and are accepting as long as one feels a part of the Jewish people. In here, I just wanted to demonstrate what it would look like for one synagogue for example.</p>\n\n\n",

Since the laws of Shabbat are very extensive, it is unlikely you can cover all these laws in a structured way outside of books. And only books can be studied on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>The classic exposition in English of the laws of Shabbat in a structured way is <strong><a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/shemirath-shabbath\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemirath Shabbath k'Hilcheta</a></strong> from R Yehoshua Neuwirth, it was first published in 1984 and updated/republished many times since. It covers all laws of Shabbat in a somewhat terse format, and serves as an excellent reference work.</p>\n<p>More pedagogical and recent is R Daniel Braude's <strong><a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/learn-shabbos-in-just-3-minutes-a-day\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Learn Shabbos In Just 3 Minutes A Day</a></strong>. It is meant to learn and review the laws of Shabbat frequently and is broken down in daily one- or two-page chunks to make it easier to absorb. It also covers all laws, includes frequent modern illustrations, plenty of references and is very pedagogical. Highly recommended.</p>\n<p>The more extensive but still user-friendy option is <strong><a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422615072.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Simcha Bunim Cohen's exposition of the laws of Shabbat</a></strong>. It covers all laws in English with extensive Hebrew footnotes for further study. It is a 7-volume set and represents a good mix of depth and user-friendliness. This is the closest to your requirement of \"tying halacha with Talmud\" as it frequently describes Talmudic disputes and how they translate into halachic opinions. It has an extension in the same format for the <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578191628.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">laws of Yom Tov</a>.</p>\n<p>Since many of the halachic references you will find in the above works will be to Shulchan Aruch and Mishna Brura, if you wish to go in more depth you will need an edition of SA/MB. An excellent one, with additional digests of the laws of Shabbat as they apply to modern times, is the <strong><a href=\"https://ohr-olam.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Olam edition</a></strong>. It is an <a href=\"https://www.shopeichlers.com/products/mishna-berurah-ohr-olam-hilchos-shabbos-8-volume-set/43763?Size=Standard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8-volume set</a> and exists in <a href=\"https://zbermanbooks.com/seforim-books/halachah/mishnah-berurah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">large and medium format</a>.

Tosafot cites as a proof for this assertion\nanother passage that teaches that when a pregnant woman converts, her\nson who is born thereafter is considered to be Jewish, and tevila is\nnot required. Since the child is not circumcised until after he is\nborn, clearly the order of the mila and tevila does not matter.

But the priests strengthened themselves, and - through them - [the other Jews] came back to the Torah and the [divine] service, especially that of the Menorah according to its practices, about which there were accusers; whereas the priests brought it back to its propriety. And Purim concerns the matter of the salvation of Israel during the Babylonian exile; and the accepting of the Torah again. For they then accepted it again forever, as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 88a), \"They went back and accepted it at the time of Achashveirosh.\" And the details of their content are according to the details of the refinement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sefas Emes you seek is <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=59600&st=&pgnum=86&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (The column on the left, second paragraph) with the key quote being:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי חנוכה ופורים הם מחזיקים אותנו בגלות כי הם מאירים (בגלות) תוך החושך</p>\n<p>Because Chanukah and Purim strengthen us - because they illuminate (in exile) in the darkness...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=66549&st=&pgnum=19&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Simcha Here</a> (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=66549&st=&pgnum=35&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English Here)</a> mentions four similarities and connections between Purim and Chanukah.</p>\n<p>Although he does not mention the Shelah which you quoted, he does provide his own connections between the two holidays.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2515444/jewish/Shabbos-Parshas-Mikeitz-27th-Day-of-Kislev-5744-1983.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shabbos Parshas Mikeitz 27th Day of Kislev 5744)</a> explained that Purim represents the body, e.g. mitzvos, and Chanukah represents the soul, e.g. Torah.</p>\n<p>On Purim, we \"accepted the Torah again\". The Ohev Yisroel <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135034/27180\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But even so, they accepted it in the days of Achashveirosh, which was a time of great pain and distance from G-d, and even so, they accepted it upon their souls, even though they were in a very lowly state, and committed to do all that was written in the holy Torah. And so we find that there was no longer any mitigating claim about the acceptance of the Torah after they accepted it out of the desire of their hearts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>During Chanukkah, the Greeks <a href=\"https://torah.org/learning/maharal-chanukah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">forbade</a> to study the Torah, especially the oral law, they forbade studying. But nevertheless, the light of Torah could not be diminished. Rabbi Pinchas Stopler (Hidden Lights: Chanukah and the Jewish/Greek Conflict) quotes Rav Hutner and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The determined decication of the Jews who confronted the Greeks in order to preserve the Torah initiated a fundamental change in the method of Torah transmission (p. 273 The Torah Became the Possession of Each Jew).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So maybe this is what Purim and Chanukah have in common, the renewal of Torah and the re-kindling of the \"inner flame\" of Creation.</p>\n\n\n",

One of the thrusts in the commentaries (Rashi, Rav Hirsch etc.) is that she stole them to wean her father off idolatry, by demonstrating that they were powerless.</p>\n<p>The most direct answer to your question would be along these lines, and in the words of Rabbeinu Channanel (brought by Rabbeinu Bachaye):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותגנב רחל את התרפים אשר לאביה; she stole them in order that he would reconsider his actions, saying to himself that any deity which allows itself to be stolen surely cannot be much good to anyone. The same argument had been used by Yoash who said if baal was really capable of avenging himself, he should do so himself instead of letting his human worshippers become his defender (Judges 6,31). Similar arguments are reflected in Ezekiel 28,9 where the prophet predicts the downfall of the King of Tzor (Tyre) who had declared himself a god. He ridicules this “god” as saying to his murderer: “I am a god!” (quoted by Rabbeinu Bachya).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>It seems that he is saying that if they were destroyed, then fine - there are ways of accomplishing that would have made sense to Lavan.

    "content": "# Work and Talmud Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot 4:5</a> records the statement that one shouldn’t make Torah study into something for worldly benefit. I was curious then, how do the haredim that do full time Torah study en masse like in many yeshivas and kollels in Israel reconcile this with their attitude that full time Torah study can be a job en masse for Jewish communities? This statement seems like it’s Saying the opposite, Torah study isn’t something to make worldly benefit from\n(ie mass stipends, or Tzedakah from working donors) and in it’s not something to make living with.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This question would be more of a question on rabbis than those who are learn in kollel. Those who are learning in kollel and are being supported are closer to  making a Yissocher-Zevulan deal (an agreement where one person learns and the other person supports him and they split the reward in the next world) than they are to  making money off learning.</p>\n<p>As far as rabbis are concerned, technically they are indeed not allowed to be paid for teaching Torah. They are paid in the (case of elementary school rebbeim) for watching children and in the case of an adult rabbi or teacher  for the fact that their preoccupation with teaching and other rabbinic functions does not allow them to have time to earn a living.</p>\n<p>In all cases it is correct that Torah is not (or at least should not be) a \"business\" with an intrinsic  profit motive. The type of person who is successful as a rabbi is usually talented enough that he could be making a lot more money were he to devote himself to a career.</p>\n<p>The above is assuming one may never make get paid for learning. The Chasam Sofer (שו\"ת חתם סופר חלק חושן משפט סימן קס\"ד) and Rav Moshe Feinstein (שו\"ת אגרות משה יו\"ד חלק ב' סימן קט\"ז) writes that because the Torah will be lost unless people will get paid to learn one may do so in todays times. The  Mishnah Berurah, in  Biur Halacha (אורח חיים סימן רל\"א בד\"ה בכל),  notes that under certain conditions, even the Rambam despite his general strong  opposition to doing do  would agree that one may get paid for learning Torah.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Ramba\"m, based on this mishna (Avos 4:5), paskened that learning without working, and relying on tzedaka is not allowed (Hilchos Talmud Torah 3:10):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל המשים על ליבו שיעסוק בתורה ולא יעשה מלאכה, ויתפרנס מן הצדקה – הרי זה חילל את השם, וביזה את התורה, וכיבה מאור הדת, וגרם רעה לעצמו, ונטל חייו מן העולם הבא; לפי שאסור ליהנות בדברי תורה בעולם הזה...</p>\n<p>Anyone who decides to learn Torah and not work, and get payed from charity, has desecrated HaShem's name, shamed the Torah, put out the light of the religion, caused bad to himself, removed his life from the world to come; because it is prohibited to use the Torah for his own worldly enjoyment...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Rambam's explanation of the Mishna in Avos (4:5) he brings multiple proofs from all over Shas for what he holds, though he mentions that many chachamim won't agree with him.</p>\n<p>The Kesef Mishna, on the quoted Ramba\"m, gives a <em>very</em> lengthy explanation of why the Ramba\"m's proofs aren't proofs, and brings his own proofs from Shas that the Ramba\"m is wrong. I won't quote him, but he explains the mishna in Pirkei Avos in the following way</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not make them as a crown to make yourself great, or as a shovel to dig with. Meaning, although Rabbi Yishmael said earlier that if one learns in order to teach (i.e. to gain respect as a Rosh Yeshiva, or to treat it as a job, like a professor), he will be provided for with enough to learn and to teach, Rabbi Tzadok says that these ideals are Assur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, per the Kesef Mishna, the Mishna in Avos is only teaching us that it is prohibited to learn for <em>the purpose</em> of making money. But, the Kesef Mishna continues, learning for a good purpose, and being payed to do so (assuming he doesn't have the money to support himself), is allowed. And he says that they must fulfill one of three conditions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>They teach children, and are being paid to do so as 'babysitters' (as schmerel mentioned)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They are being paid to learn so they can provide guidance for the community, which would otherwise be lacking</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Being paid to judge.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, the Kesef Mishna posits that what the Ramba\"m means is that one should not rely completely on charity. Rather he should learn a profession, and then if that is not enough to support himself while also teaching Torah (or whatever position he has), he may rely on charity.</p>\n<p>He also brings another explanation, being that even if <em>Me'ikar Hadin</em> one shouldn't rely on charity while learning, since \"עת לעשות להשם הפרו תורתיך\" - A time to act for HaShem, the Torah is nullified. In other words, if we didn't have people who would learn Torah and not work, the Torah would be forgotten Ch\"V.</p>\n<p>The Ba\"ch says that Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, the Tashbe\"tz and the Aruch all argued with the Ramba\"m, though the Tur agreed with him. The Abarbanel also disagrees with the Rambam.</p>\n<p>Some of the claims made, as to why it is allowed nowadays (in addition to the ones already quoted):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>It is no longer a <em>Chillul HaShem</em> not to work; rather, it is considered more respectable to learn than to work. (Tashbetz chelek 1:142)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If Talmidei Chachamim work, they will not be given the respect that they need in order to teach Torah and have the congregation listen (Tashbetz 1:148)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They are not getting payed to learn or teach, they are getting paid שכר ביטולן - 'unemployment wages', which is allowed (even the Ramba\"m agrees that in such a case it's allowed).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Ma'ase Roke'ach claims that nowadays even the Ramba\"m would admit that it's allowed, because otherwise the torah would be lost.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Yoreh De'ah B 116) wrote in the conclusion of his teshuva:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דין ברור ופשוט שנתקבל בכל הדורות אם מדינא [=שכר בטלה דמוכח], אם מתקנה ד\"עת לעשות לה' הפרו תורתך\", שמותר לעסוק בתורה ולהתפרנס מקבלת פרס או ממה שהוא מלמד תורה לאחרים או שהוא רב ומורה הוראה, ואין להמנע מזה אפילו ממדת חסידות.</p>\n<p>It is a clear and simple rule that was accepted throughout the generations, whether because of the letter of the law (that it's unemployment wages, as was proven), or because of the rule of 'a time to act for HaShem, the Torah is nullified', one is allowed fo learn Torah and be paid by sponsor, or by teaching others, or by beign a Rabbi or a posek, and one shouldn't stay away from this, even as a Middas Chassidus (beyond the letter of the law).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So, in short</strong>, the Ramba\"m says that it's not allowed, and some Rishonim and Achronim agree with him. Many other Rishonim and Achronim disagree, for various reasons, and explain the Mishna in Avos, as well as all other proofs, in various ways (as brought in the Kesef Mishna, or because it's no longer applicable because עת לעשות להשם). The general consensus is: it's allowed, especially if he is planning on learning in order to fill a position that is/ will be needed in the community (Rabbi, teacher, Posek, etc.)</p>\n\n\n",

Still your question goes beyond, and you note the issue of marking a specific place on the page.</p>\n<p>The best solution I found for this are <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00685DVSO\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">book darts</a> - these are small metal arrows which pince the page at a specific location and can be removed without any trace. R Gil Student researched them (<a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2023/09/are-book-darts-kosher/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) and found them to be <em>mutar</em> to use on Shabbat. He goes through the sources and concludes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems that most authorities would allow the use of book darts and\nbookmarks on Shabbos because it does not constitute preparation for\nafter Shabbos. Additionally, when I use bookmarks on Shabbos, I often\nrefer back to the book on Shabbos. In other words, placing the\nbookmark or book dart is for Shabbos itself and not (just) preparation\nfor after Shabbos. This would allow even more room for leniency.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have very positive experiences with <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00685DVSO\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this specific product</a> which exists in a <a href=\"https://www.bookdarts.com/shop/pc/18Forty-org-30-Count-Tin-p143.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">version</a> called \"I read this over Shabbos\" (for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShabbosReads\" rel=\"noreferrer\">movement</a> of those who post on twitter after Shabbat  what they read that day).</p>\n\n\n",

And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"you must surely annihilate them\" (Deuteronomy 20:17). And He explained to us in many verses that the reason for this is so that we do not learn from their heresy. And many verses come to hint about this - meaning their killing - to strengthen it; and the war against them is a commanded war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The war of the 7 nations is the quintessential Milchemet mitzvah! It is a war that God literally commanded us explicitly to wage. We think of a Milchemet Mitzvah as a war that we decide to wage, for a proper purpose, that meets certain criteria, such as having a king. But it also certainly includes a war that is an explicit mitzvah in the Torah.</p>\n<p>Now, not all the wars in sefer shoftim are with the 7 nations. But I am unsure as to why there is an asumption those were a milchemet mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Nazir benefiting from grapes/wine\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If somebody vows to be a Nazir, are they still allowed to benefit from wine and grapes? Like would they be able to sell wine and grapes to non Nazir people? Or is it like milk and meat or chametz on Passover where you are forbidden from benefiting, not just eating it. Sources appreciated please</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>A Nazir is allowed to benefit from wine, as the gemara (pesachim 21b-23a) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ופליגי דרבי אבהו דאמר רבי אבהו כל מקום שנאמר לא יאכל לא תאכל לא תאכלו אחד איסור אכילה ואחד איסור הנאה עד שיפרט לך הכתוב כדרך שפרט לך בנבילה... (23.) והרי נזיר דרחמנא אמר \"מחרצנים ועד זג לא יאכלו ותנן \"מערבין לנזיר ביין\" אמר מר זוטרא שאני התם דאמר קרא \"נזרו\" שלו יהא</p>\n<p>And this argued with Rabbi Abahu, as Rabbi Abahu says, anywhere that \"it shall not be eaten\", \"you shall not eat\" or \"you (plu.) should not eat\" is written, it means both a prohibition of eating and a prohibition of benefitting, until the passuk says outright, like by <em>neveila</em>... (23b) [the gemara questions Rabbi Abahu] but by a Nazir it says \"they shall eat nothing from the seeds to the grape skin\", yet we learned in a mishna \"we make an eiruv (techumin) for a Nazir with wine\"! <strong>Mar Zutra answers: there it is different, as the Passuk says \"his Nazir-hood\" - it shall be his. (Meaning, even though he isn't allowed to eat or drink the grape products, he is allowed to benefit from them, as they are still considered his, as the Passuk calls it <em>his</em> Nazir-hood)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that a Nazir may derive benefit from grape products. However, it's slightly more complicated than that, as the Ramba'm (Nazir 5:10) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מדברי סופרים שאסור לנזיר לעמוד במושב שותי יין ויתרחק ממנו הרבה שהרי מכשול לפניו. אמרו חכמים סביב לכרם לא יקרב</p>\n<p>Mid'rabannan, it is prohibited for a Nazir to stand in a place of wine-drinkers, and he should distance himself from it a lot, as it is a stumbling block for him. Chachamim said that he should not walk in the vicinity of a vineyard</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(This is based on a gemara in Avoda Zara 59)</p>\n<p>So we see that a Nazir should not deal with wine or grapes in any form, even when they're not his own, as he may come to eat/ drink them. In short, a Nazir may get benefit from grape products, so long as he is not in the direct surroundings of the grapes. For example, he can't sell grapes, but he can have someone else sell grapes for him.</p>\n\n\n",

As \"Palace of the King\", e.g G-d? Midrashim, Chassidus etc.. are very welcome.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are several instances.</p>\n<p>Firstly, note <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Devarim.32.43.3?vhe=Midrash_Rabbeinu_Bachya_%5Bben_Asher%5D._Warsaw,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachaye</a> on Devarim 32:43 on the words \"וְכִפֶּ֥ר אַדְמָת֖וֹ עַמּֽוֹ\" - \"And atone His people’s land\" writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכפר אדמתו עמו. פירוש אדמתו ועמו. ובמדרש וכפר אדמתו על עמו. ובסוף כתובות דרשו רז\"ל וכפר אדמתו עמו, כל הקבור בארץ ישראל כאלו קבור תחת המזבח, כתיב הכא וכפר אדמתו עמו, וכתיב התם (שמות כ׳:כ״א) מזבח אדמה תעשה לי. וזה היה מסוד יצירת האדם שבראו יתברך ממקום כפרתו, שכן כתיב בו (בראשית ב׳:ז׳) עפר מן האדמה, <strong>וזהו מעלת הארץ שהיא פלטין של מלך ונקראת ארץ ה' ונחלת ה'</strong>, וכל שהוא חוצה לה נקראת בלשון הכתוב תוצאות ואהלי רשע, ובלשון רז\"ל ארץ העמים, והנה היא טמאה ומטמאת מצד עפרה ואוירה, וכן אמרו בפרק קמא דגטין, ארץ העמים גזרו בה טומאה על גושה ועל אוירה, אבל סוריא על גושה גזרו על אוירה לא גזרו, וכבר הזכרתי מזה בפסוק (דברים ל״א:ט״ז) אלהי נכר הארץ.</p>\n<p>וכפר אדמתו עמו, “and He will appease His land and His people.” According to both Onkelos, Ibn Ezra, and Rashi, the words אדמתו עמו are to be understood as אדמתו ועמו, “His land and His people.” The Midrash (Sifri on our verse) understands the words as if the Torah had written וכפר אדמתו על עמו, “its land will be atonement for its people.” According to Kesubos 111 the meaning is that if a Jew is buried in the land of Israel, his sins will be transferred to the soil, i.e. the land of Israel will act as a Mikveh, a ritual bath, cleansing him from his impurities. The wording there is “that being buried in the land of Israel is equivalent to being buried beneath the Holy Altar.” This is an extension of the verse “You shall build an altar of earth for me” (Exodus 20:24). This is also understood to be the meaning of the sages’ comment that the reason G-d created Adam out of earth was that the place which would serve as the means of his atonement was his origin. <strong>This is the advantage of ארץ ישראל, that it is the palace of the King (G-d) and therefore is also known as ארץ ה', (Joshua 22:19). It is also known as נחלת ה', “the Lord’s heritage.”</strong> Anything outside the boundaries of the land of Israel is always referred to as something “outside, external.” The Scriptures refer to such countries as חוצות, (compare Proverbs 8,26 where the word ארץ and חוצות appear side by side to make this distinction and is even called אהלי רשע “tents of the wicked,” in Psalms 84:11). In the parlance of our sages in Gittin 8, any land outside the land of Israel is referred to as ארץ העמים. To make the distinction crystal clear, the sages decreed ritual impurity on any produce imported from these countries and even its airspace was considered as ritually impure, so that by having traversed it one needs to purify oneself. The only exception to this ruling was Syria because it adjoins the land of Israel. I have already mentioned this in connection with 31:16 אלוהי נכר הארץ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shem_MiShmuel%2C_Behar.5.5?vhe=Sefer_Shem_Mishmuel,_Piotrkow,_1927-1934&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shem Mishmuel</a> on Parshas Behar when discussing the mitzvah of shemittah in Eretz Yisroel brings a mashal that also talks of a palace of a king. In essence, it bemoans what happens when we are gifted the land of Israel but fail to perform Shemitta, thereby representing a lost opportunity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולפי האמור יובן דעון שמיטה גורם גלות הארץ דכל מדתו של הקב\"ה מדה במדה שכאשר לא שבתו בשביעית והיו מראים כאלו חטפו הארץ והחזיקו בה לעולם, ע\"כ לא חזר ה' ליתן להם עוד לשבע שנים, והוא כענין שבמדרש בראשית פ' ה' <strong>משל למלך שבנה פלטרין</strong> וכו' והושיב בה המלך דיורין פקחים עמדו והחזיקו בפלטרין אמרו אין פלטין זו של מלך שלנו היא אמר המלך תחזור פלטין לכמו שהיתה וכו' עיי\"ש, זה נאות גם לעניננו לפי דרכנו, ויש לומר דהיינו הך שאמרו ז\"ל בש\"ס תענית (כ\"ט) כשחרב הבית בראשונה אותו היום וכו' ומוצאי שביעית היתה, היינו אחר שכלתה המתנה לשבע שנים שעברו, ולא ניתן להם מחדש ע\"כ נחרב הבית וגלו גלות שלימה</p>\n<p>And according to what has been said, it will be understood and known that shemitta causes the land's exile because of every attribute of Hashem is measure for measure, that when they did not rest during the Shemittah, they made it appear as if they seized the land and held it forever. As a result, Hashem did not return to give them another seven years, and it is like the Midrash in Bereishis, chapter 5, <strong>a parable for the king who built a palace</strong> etc. and the King dwelt there in it. The officers that lived there stood in the palace and asserted that this was not the palace of their king. The king responded' 'let the palace be restored to the way it was' etc. This can also be applied nicely to our matter, and is indeed what is brought in Shas (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.29a.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 29</a>) \"When the Temple was destroyed for the first time, that day was the Ninth of Av...and it was after the Shemitta year\" - (in other words), we were after the gift of the past seven years, and we did not give it to them again because the Beis Hamikdash was destroyed and they found a complete exile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Refer also to the Chidah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_David%2C_Beha%27alotcha.3?vhe=Rosh_David,_Mantova_1776&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh David</a> on Behaalosecha - he writes there, \"ארץ ישראל מקודשת מכל הארצות\" - \"the land of Israel is the holiest of all the lands\". There is no Torah like the Torah of the Land of Israel, nor wisdom like the wisdom of the Land of Israel. He then goes on to fill in the gaps between the conversation between Moshe Rabbeinu and his father-in-law Yisro upon them parting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויאמר לא אלך והיה טעמו כי אל ארצי שאני מארץ טמאה ואל מולדתי שהם גוים והטבע מחייב לחטוא מצד ארצי ומולדתי <strong>וירא אנכי לחטוא בפלטין של מלך</strong>, ויאמר משה אל נא תעזוב אותנו כי על כן ידעת חנותנו במדבר אשר שם הסטרא אחרא</p>\n<p>And he (Yisro to Moshe) said, \"I will not go (with you to Eretz Yisroel\", (...but will return to my native land\" - see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.10.30?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 10:30</a>) and his reason was because to my country, which is an impure land, and to my homeland, which belongs to non-Jews, and the nature requires me to sin on the part of my country and my homeland and <strong>I am afraid to sin in the palace of a king</strong>. And Moshe responded, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.10.31?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 10:31</a>) \"Please do not leave us, inasmuch as you know where we should camp in the wilderness\" which is where the Sitra Achra (Satan) will be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Blessing on an Aveira?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Would one make the birchas Ha'airusin and Sheva brachos if one was mesader kiddushin for a couple that were prohibited to marry by a negative prohibition in the Torah, but where kiddushin does take effect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Generally speaking, one does not make a bracha on a mitzvah that is done through an aveirah, so this case of Birchat Ha'airusin and Sheva brachot would not be any different.</p>\n<p>The sources for this concept appear in a few different places:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bava Kamma 94a says:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דְּתַנְיָא, רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר בֶּן יַעֲקֹב אוֹמֵר: הֲרֵי שֶׁגָּזַל סְאָה שֶׁל חִטִּין, טְחָנָהּ, לָשָׁהּ וַאֲפָאָהּ, וְהִפְרִישׁ מִמֶּנָּה חַלָּה, כֵּיצַד מְבָרֵךְ? אֵין זֶה מְבָרֵךְ אֶלָּא מְנָאֵץ! וְעַל זֶה נֶאֱמַר: ״בֹּצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ ה׳״.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"As it is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: In the case of one who robbed another of a se’a of wheat, then ground it, kneaded it, and baked it, and he then separated ḥalla from it, i.e., he separated the portion of the dough that one is required to separate and then give to a priest, how can he recite the blessing over the separation of ḥalla? This individual is not reciting a blessing, but rather he is blaspheming. And with regard to this it is stated: “The robber who recites a blessing blasphemes the Lord” (Psalms 10:3).\"</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Challah.1.5.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Challah 1:5</a> says:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. אָמַר רִבִּי הוֹשַׁעְיָה עַל שֵׁם וּבוֹצֵעַ בֵּרֵךְ נִאֵץ יי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"It was stated: It is forbidden to recite a benediction over a robbed maẓẓah. Rebbi Hoshaia said, because of (Ps. 10:3): “He who recites the blessing over a piece of bread blasphemes.\"</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Rambam Hilchot Brachot 1:19 says:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הָאוֹכֵל דָּבָר הָאָסוּר בֵּין בְּזָדוֹן בֵּין בִּשְׁגָגָה אֵינוֹ מְבָרֵךְ עָלָיו לֹא בַּתְּחִלָּה וְלֹא בַּסּוֹף. כֵּיצַד. הֲרֵי שֶׁאָכַל טֶבֶל שֶׁל דִּבְרֵיהֶם אוֹ שֶׁאָכַל מַעֲשֵׂר רִאשׁוֹן שֶׁלֹּא נִטְּלוּ תְּרוּמוֹתָיו אוֹ מַעֲשֵׂר שֵׁנִי וְהֶקְדֵּשׁ שֶׁלֹּא נִפְדּוּ כְּהִלְכָתָן אֵינוֹ מְבָרֵךְ. וְאֵין צָרִיךְ לוֹמַר אִם אָכַל נְבֵלוֹת וּטְרֵפוֹת אוֹ שָׁתָה יֵין נֶסֶךְ וְכַיּוֹצֵא בּוֹ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"When a person eats a forbidden food - whether consciously or inadvertently - he should not recite a blessing beforehand or afterward.\nWhat is implied? If one eats tevel - even food that is classified as tevel by Rabbinical decree, the first tithe from which terumah was not separated, or the second tithe or sanctified foods that were not redeemed in the proper manner, one should not recite a blessing. Needless to say, this applies if one ate meat from an animal that was not ritually slaughtered or was trefah or if one drank wine used as a libation for idol worship.\"</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Shulchan Aruch O.C Siman 649:1 says:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל ארבעה המינים פסולים בגזול ובגנוב בין לפני יאוש בין לאחר יאוש אבל גזול וקנאו בלא סיוע המצוה כגון גזל לולב ושיפהו כשר דקנייה בשינוי מעשה ומיהו לא יברך עליו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"All of the four species are rendered invalid if they are obtained by theft or robbery, whether the owners have not yet given up hope of recovering or whether they have. However if one stole it and then established ownership of it by means other than doing the mitzvah, like one who stole a lulav and then improved it, it is valid, as he acquired it with this changing action. However, he should not bless on it.\"</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Reshimot_Shiurim_on_Berakhot.45a.29?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reshimot Shiurim on Brachot 45a</a> he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש להסתפק בשיטת הרמב\"ם שאין מברכין ברכת הנהנין על דבר האסור, האם הוא דין מסוים בהלכות ברכות שאין מברכין על דבר אסור, או דילמא דאין מברכין על דבר האסור משום דהוי מצוה הבאה בעבירה, וחל מדין מצוה הבאה בעבירה דעלמא כבכל התורה כולה. ועיין ברמב\"ם (פ\"ו מהל' חמץ ומצה ה\"ז) וז\"ל אין אדם יוצא ידי חובתו באכילת מצה שהיא אסורה לו כגון שאכל טבל או מעשר ראשון שלא נטלה תרומתו או שגזלה, זה הכלל כל שמברכין עליו ברכת המוציא יוצא בו ידי חובתו, וכל שאין מברכין עליו אין יוצא בו ידי חובתו עכ\"ל. והנה הרמב\"ם תלה דין מצה שיוצא בו ידי חובתו בדין ברכת המזון, דמצה שמברכין עליה יוצא בו ידי חובתו, ומצה שאין מברכין עליה אין יוצאים בה ידי חובת מצה. ולכאורה אי נימא שהדין דאין מברכין על דבר האסור הוא דין מסוים בהלכות ברכות, צ\"ע איך נלמד מזה שאין יוצאים בו ידי חובת מצה, ולמה תולה הרמב\"ם דין המצה בדין ברכת המזון. ועוד צ\"ע דאם נאמר שהרמב\"ם סובר שחל דין מסוים שאין מברכין בתחילה ולבסוף על מאכלות אסורות אמאי כלל הרמב\"ם (פ\"ו מהל' חמץ ומצה ה\"ז) מצה גזולה בהדי מצה של טבל ומעשר ראשון שלא נטלה תרומתו, והרי אין לחם גזול חפצא דמאכלות אסורות, דלכאורה גזילה הוי איסור גברא. <strong>ומשמע מכאן דהרמב\"ם סובר דאין מברכין על דבר האסור משום דהוי מצוה הבאה בעבירה, דהיינו שהמצוה נתקיימה ע\"י עבירה, ולכן פסק שאין מברכין על מצה גזולה משום דהוי מצוה הבאה בעבירה, ולכן הרמב\"ם נמי משווה מצה אסורה שאין מברכין עליה משום דהויא מצוה הבאה בעבירה</strong> דכמו\"כ אין יוצאים בה נמי ידי חובת מצות אכילת מצה משום דהוי מצוה הבאה בעבירה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"One may deliberate on the Rambam's opinion that one does not recite a blessing over something prohibited. Is this a specific rule within the laws of brachot that one does not say a bracha on something forbidden, or perhaps one does not bless over something prohibited because it is considered a מצוה הבאה בעבירה, and this principle applies throughout the entire Torah. The Rambam in Hilchot Chametz and Matzah 6:7 writes: \"A person does not fulfill their obligation of eating matzah if it is prohibited to them, such as if they ate tevel (untithed produce) or first tithe from which its terumah (priestly portion) has not been taken, or if it was stolen. This is the rule: Anything over which one can recite the bracha of hamotzi fulfills the obligation, and anything over which one does not recite the blessing does not fulfill the obligation.\" The Rambam links the law of matzah with the law of blessing, stating that matzah over which one recites a blessing fulfills the obligation, and matzah over which one does not recite a blessing does not fulfill the obligation of eating matzah.</p>\n<p>Seemingly, if we say that the rule of not saying a bracha on something prohibited is a specific rule within the laws of brachot, it is difficult to understand how it can be inferred that one does not fulfill the obligation of matzah with it, and why the Rambam connects the law of matzah with the law of brachot. Moreover, if we say that the Rambam holds there is a specific rule that one does not make a bracha before or after eating prohibited foods, why did the Rambam include (in Hilchot Chametz and Matzah 6:7) stolen matzah along with matzah that is tevel or first tithe from which terumah has not been taken? Stolen bread is not considered a forbidden food item, as seemingly theft is a personal prohibition (issur gavra). <strong>From here, it appears that the Rambam believes one does not say a bracha on something prohibited because it is considered a מצוה הבאה בעבירה. That is, the mitzvah is fulfilled through a transgression, and therefore, he ruled that one does not bless over stolen matzah because it is a מצוה הבאה בעבירה.</strong> Thus, the Rambam equates prohibited matzah, over which one does not bless because it is a מצוה הבאה בעבירה with not fulfilling the obligation of eating matzah, because it is a \"mitzvah performed through a transgression.\"</p>\n<p>So according to the Reshimot Shiurim there is a possible thing to say that according to the Rambam one does not say a bracha on something prohibited because it is considered a מצוה הבאה בעבירה which would apply to כל התורה כולה.</p>\n\n\n",
